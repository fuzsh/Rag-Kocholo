        "text": "As I mentioned in the previous review, Halloween 5 wrote out checks on the mysterious appearance of a Man in Black and his relationship to white-masked killer Michael Myers. Those checks were intended to be cashed in by the sixth Halloween movie. Except the writers for Halloween 5 did not end up coming back for that sixth movie and a ridiculously protracted development history – partly spurred on by Moustapha Akkad finding the reception for Halloween 5 disappointing and trying to figure out the best way to right the ship – that eventually landed on franchise super-fan Daniel Farrands to construct ten different screenplay drafts. The one that stuck involved an extensive supernatural mythology surrounding Michael that would make up the spine of that sixth Halloween movie. A dreadfully malformed spine that couldn’t possibly support any movie, let alone the two that essentially would have to make up our current subject.\n\nFor you see, there’s the rub in discussing the sixth Halloween: throughout the production, Bob Weinstein (as head of Dimension Films, which had partnered with Akkad’s Nightfall in producing the film) and Akkad butt heads a lot over the direction of the picture and this climaxed after the movie’s initial NYC test screening in which audience members responded to a lot of the plot developments with derision and confusion. From there, Weinstein went above Akkad’s head to have an entirely new final act drafted by an unknown replacement writer and then had it reshot and cut into the picture with absolutely no grace whatsoever. The subsequent legal battle between Akkad and Weinstein landed on Weinstein being able to release his new cut in theaters in 1995 and Akkad’s cut – subsequently called The Producer’s Cut – became a bootleg item until its first official public screening in 2013.\n\nSo we have two versions of the sixth Halloween picture available for all: the 87-minute theatrical cut (which features the title card referring to itself as Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers) and the 95-minute “producer’s cut” (which features a title card Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers, with the “a”s made in the form of a familiar rune). Despite mostly following the same plot thread for the majority of their runtimes, they are radically different movies beyond their divergent final acts and it’ll take more than a bit of housekeeping to discuss the two of them thoroughly.\n\nBut let’s start with what they DO have in common, which begins in a horrible place for us to revisit our heroine Jamie Lloyd in the 6 years since we left her: she’s been kidnapped by that mysterious Man in Black alongside Michael, has somehow been impregnated within the custody of their evil underground cult, had the child removed from her care upon birth, and worst of all… she is not played by Danielle Harris. No, Harris dared to ask a $5 million dollar budget production for a $5,000 payment and was balked at, so now Jamie is played by J.C. Brandy*. Probably just as well since it’s already upsetting enough to imagine the young traumatized child being carted off to be raped without having to recognize her in adulthood. Either way, the treatment of Jamie as a character within this film is a level of mean-spiritedness on par with Rachel’s disposal in the previous film. And I know that cruelty is an essential part of this subgenre, but it feels like the degree of suffering and targeting a character who basically acted as our emotional anchor for the last two movies feels unnecessarily punishing in a way that cuts out the fun of the subgenre, y’know?\n\nBut I digress: Jamie is aided by an ill-fated nurse to retrieve her baby and escape as Michael follows her relentlessly through the dark and stormy night (George P. Wilbur returning to the role officially after Halloween 4, even though he still performed stunts for the character in Halloween 5). He catches up and violently attacks her, but Jamie manages to hide her child beyond Michael’s grasp and make a wide call for help on a radio broadcast before meeting her fate.\n\nA call heard by not only Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence in his final outing with the role, passing away months before the movie’s release) and his colleague Dr. Terence Wynn (Mitch Ryan), but another individual who has history with Michael: Tommy Doyle, the young boy who Laurie Strode babysat that fateful night in 1978. He’s now grown up, obsessed with his childhood near-death experience, and played by a fresh-faced actor known as Paul Rudd who would notoriously retain that boyish look into his 50s. Undoubtedly the subsequent stardom Rudd experienced left him not missing this production one bit. Anyway, Tommy deduces Jamie made her call at the local bus station and finds the baby there, bringing it back to his home right across the street from the Myers house itself.\n\nA house populated by another strand of the Strodes it turns out, headed by Laurie’s until-now-unseen uncle John (Bradford English). John appears to be a complete piece of shit to everyone under that roof, especially his daughter Kara (Marianne Hagan) and her out-of-wedlock son Danny (Devin Gardner) as she tries to rebuild her life moving in with her parents and going back to school. Also there is Kim Darby of all actors playing John’s long-suffering wife, surpassing Pleasence as the most overqualified actor in the picture. Loomis tries and fails to convince the Strodes to vacate the home, whose history was shadily known only to John. Kara and Danny are at least brought out of harm’s way by Tommy, who begins to unwrap the mystery behind why Michael does what he does as the Man in Black and his cult tightens in on our protagonists.\n\nI think that gets about as far as the two cuts come before splitting entirely into their different movies, but already by this point watching one yields unalike experiences from the other. The best summary one can give about the two cuts’ distinctions is how clearly jumpy and jagged the theatrical version is. It feels like Weinstein saw the patient breathing room that Akkad, Farrands, and director Joe Chappelle brought to each thriller setpiece and thought “why is it taking so long?” because it’s very clearly the same material but the space between incidents is fully removed so everything is high impact. Added to that is the increased amount of gore shots crafted by the legendary John Carl Buechler (who also the designed the film’s mask and therefore supplied Michael with his best look in any of the sequels), some of which is much appreciated like how the most unlikable character has his head explode. And there’s a heinous musical score that Alan Howarth and Paul Rabjohns forced upon the viewer by pasting hair metal guitar and drums over the Producer Cut’s moodier synthesizer music. In general, the theatrical cut leans into an incoherent amount of aesthetic excess that underline all the things wrong with the disorienting visual choices Chappelle and cinematographer Billy Dickson dig in. Farrands considered the resultant version with its continuous flashes and bombastic sounds to be “more of an MTV music video and a Halloween movie” and he’s right. The Producer’s cut is still not an elegant little thing with added material that makes it feel denser in the way that forcing a lid on an overfilled jar also feels denser. And I haven’t determined whether I find the dispatching of Jamie as a character in the theatrical cut is less contemptible than Akkad/Farrands’ version (the theatrical cut is of course gorier, but the Producer’s cut feels more miserable in its prolonging). But at least the Producer’s cut allows itself a coherence and legibility that the Weinsteins’ version willfully neglects.\n\nThere is are at least two major saving graces that are consistent regardless of the cut you’re watching, at least in terms of the recent Scream! Factory release through which I watched these. One of them is Pleasence, who makes his final go-round count and treats every development with a whole lot more dignity than it deserves. The other is the exterior photography, especially in the daytime, which grasps hard to every red, yellow, and brown that appears in frame and stresses the autumnal atmosphere of this Haddonfield Halloween, ending up the closest these never-shot-in-the-Midwest movies felt to being Midwestern late Octobers. Granting this was retained in both cuts I watched, my understanding is that the originally bootlegged Producer’s Cut – which was more workprint than official release and therefore more unfinished – had ENTIRELY different color grading from the theatrical. That’s not really the case with the Scream! Factory 2022 releases so I must assume the change occurred at least before then (I do own the 2014 blu-ray release and am curious if that has the original coloring, but am in no rush to rewatch this. I’m sure y’all understand).\n\nBut really when reckoning with how there are two unalike movies under the guise of being the sixth Halloween, one truly has to acknowledge the contrasting final acts of both because… it’s really something. They both maintain the production’s desperation to ride on that latest X-Files craze that was rolling in the mid-1990s with a determination that Michael is driven by the Druid curse of the rune þ (pronounced “Thorn”) and that rune is being controlled by the mysterious Man in Black and… goddamn is that some doofy fan fiction out of Farrands (ostensibly this was pulled from the novelization of the original 1978 film and that’s why books are obviously evil).\n\nBut then there’s the Producer’s cut, which at least revisits the opening sequence with as a cyclical structural decision for the film’s climax. It even tries to make a resolution out of the Man in Black reveal (because of course his identity is revealed) and Tommy’s knowledge of Druid runes. It’s just that it’s all so blatantly stupid and impossible for me to take seriously despite Pleasence’s best efforts.\n\nAnd it’s still more satisfying on its own merits than the theatrical cut of the final act. First off, it is so disinterested in clarity that it took me refreshing myself with Wikipedia JUST AFTER watching that version to get what happened. Then there’s the further flop sweat behind the movie’s aping of X-Files by setting itself in a location that stresses science fiction and medical conspiracies over the primitivism of how the Producer’s Cut presents Thorn cult’s lair. And then there’s the blustering way it transforms into a Michael Myers ex machina AND back to a generic slasher chase sequence, except at a level of incoherent shot assembly that completely collapses the theatrical cut into a work of anti-art. The final moments of Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers as released to paying audiences in 1995 is fully illegible and outright disorienting, with a repetition of same-scale and composition shots of Paul Rudd going toe-to-toe with Michael Myers at inhuman velocity and assaultive flash cuts that suggest you are literally dying as you watch the film and instead of your life flashing before your eyes, it’s one of the worst fucking movies of the 1990s. And then to top it off, it rips out the context for Pleasence’s last acting beat in the entire franchise, maintaining the pained scream he delivers but making it feel like it just generated out of thin air and like he… idk… just Ben Kenobi’d his way out of Halloween forever?\n\nHalloween 6 – the Producer’s cut – is undeniably more functional than Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers – the theatrical cut – as the latter’s method of reconstructing the film and shoveling both new material and a re-assemblage of the same material gives the impression of performing a heart surgery by removing the intestines and lungs and kidneys and deliberately neglecting to put that shit back after inserting a pipe bomb where the heart should be. It’s honestly fascinating in a way: both because the formal wrongness of the theatrical cut just invites more awe in how Hollywood men can fuck something up with their money on the line, but also in how the ways it fails are so evidently “corrected” effortlessly with the Producer’s cut that the sole value of the picture is illustrating the difference between function and dysfunction in all aspects of post-production. Still, even for academic reasons, I couldn’t bring myself to recommend a version to watch, but that’s largely because I couldn’t bring myself to recommend the sixth Halloween movie at all. It’s all the same shitty movie, just served differently in a manner where the poisons you pick are either one of the worst Halloween movies (Producer’s cut) or one of the worst movies ever made (theatrical cut).\n\n*This shan’t however be the last we see of Harris in the Halloween franchise, of course.\n\nIt’s tough to write about as a masterpiece where everything said has already been said, as is the case with the 1978 original Halloween. Almost as tough is trying to write about a movie that is such an empty nothing and provokes virtually no response from you. Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers* is that nothing, a movie that it’s hard to even muster hatred for.\n\nLet’s start with observing that the screenplay written by Michael Jacobs, Shem Bitterman, & Dominique Othenin-Girard – the last of whom is also the director – embodies the sort of contempt for its immediate predecessor that ALIEN³ has for Aliens and by the same means. Fortunately, Jamie (Danielle Harris) is alive. Not well, mind you, as the final beat of Halloween 4 saw her attack her adoptive mother in the aftermath of Michael Myers’ chase and she’s been admitted into a clinic accordingly with enough trauma from her non-lethal actions to go completely mute. But she’s alive one year later and she’s being visited with lots of love by her sister Rachel (Ellie Cornell) and their friend Tina (Wendy Kaplan) right up until Michael (now played by the appropriately-named Don Shanks wearing I think the same mask from Halloween 4, but worse for the wear and completely loose at the neck. Which I suppose makes sense given what we watch the killer go through, but it’s hideously unintimidating in how thin it it makes his face look) goes and stabs Rachel to death in a characteristic “vulnerable girl who just got out of the shower” slasher sequence whose prolonging fizzles out any tension when Rachel is trying to figure out what that uneasy sound is in the house. It’s also where we meet two intolerable comic relief police officers (Frank Como and David Ursin) and their musical cue that sounds like an off-brand version of the “Bulk and Skull” theme from the Power Rangers franchise.\n\nTurns out Michael has survived his ostensible death at the hands of the posse in Halloween 4 by diving out of the open mine he was blasted into and landing in a river just as they tried to finish the job with dynamite, giving us the single most hilarious image of the entire franchise as we watch Michael float through the river as the franchise’s theme music tinkles along. Also turns out Jamie’s nightmares of Michael from that film have developed into full-on Eyes–of–Laura–Mars-level real-time visions from his point of view, leading to her watching Rachel’s death without being able to do anything. Understandably, such an experience has her retreating further from the interactions of others, especially that of Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence). After learning of Jamie’s psychic connection, Loomis has been trying to coerce her into assisting him to find Michael and put him away once and for all. His insistent speechifying leads to the most exciting and engaged acting Pleasence has given since the first Halloween, but it’s also definitely the sort of shit that would intimidate a traumatized child into inaction.\n\nMost of all, since Jamie is psychologically and emotionally out of commission for the time-being, the only protagonist left for us to latch onto is Tina and… she is just… the worst. She’s somehow the least obnoxious of the party teens that make up her friend circle and therefore the early body count of Michael’s violent return to Haddonfield (the worst is her greaser boyfriend Mike, performed by Jonathan Chapin like a future domestic abuser). But she’s still absolutely the worst protagonist I can think of in the franchise: doomed to exemplify everything about the 1980s that damn well should have stayed dead in the 1980s from the garish wardrobe design (where her first outfit is some unholy cross between a goth corsette and a loud purple lace boa that is sewn on to look like it’s the worst flotation device ever) to her shallow party girl attitude that can’t even convincingly segue into her character’s ostensible concern for Jamie’s well-being without feeling like Kaplan’s playing it as a small joke. It’s a dive down in quality from the work Cornell did in the previous film and in that context the amount of time we have to spend with Tina is torture.\n\nThe good news is – and forgive me as I will acknowledge this is a vague SPOILER ALERT but I strongly suspect anyone who was that invested in the plot of Halloween 5 has seen it by this point – but Tina is NOT our final girl and she’s forced to carry only 2/3 of the picture at most. Michael’s terrorizing of her eventually catalyzes Jamie to help Loomis and Sheriff Meeker (Beau Starr being the fourth returning actor from the last film) to set up a trap in the old Myers home for Michael, which leads to a mildly satisfying chase sequence for Jamie.\n\nThe mechanics of that final girl sequence is not the only satisfying element of the protagonist switch, but simply the fact that Harris – with the challenge that Jamie brings as a role in refusing to speak and requiring expressiveness through other means – has enhanced her already incredible work in Halloween 4 while Pleasence allows himself a chance to strategically map around Loomis’ raves and desperate appeals into maybe the most emotionally accessible version of the character he’s ever provided.\n\nBut their efforts are for naught when put in the context of a movie directed by Othenin-Giraud, recommended to franchise producer Moustapha Akkad by former co-producer Debra Hill in an act that I must assume was vengeful sabotage on her part**. He seems to just be demanding Charles Tetoni and Jerry Brady at the editing chairs construct the movie out of shots that merely happen to have the characters in them performing the script’s directions rather than any conscious progression that could be determined from the sequence or any desire to establish the spaces in which the incidents take place. This is most horrid in the disastrous cutting for a talent show at the clinic, but it’s also film-destroying for crucial thriller moments like Michael interrupting a roll in the hay by having one of his victims run through the barn in mediums that establish no direction to her flee or a critical moment in the above mentioned chase where Jamie slides down a chute to escape Michael’s grasp, climbs back up as Michael races down to meet her at the end, and makes her way back to the ground floor. And that latter one ostensibly should be straight forward in ups and downs, but Othenin-Giraud clearly hasn’t met any angle in such a closed space that he didn’t love.\n\nMost vital (at least for me), Othenin-Giraud has not done any work with cinematographer Robert Draper to give this the characteristic atmosphere that the first four Halloween movies aimed for. Returning to Salt Lake City as a filming location, the two neglect color-correction so hard that the movie ends up looking in its bright greens more like California than the entries that were ACTUALLY shot in California and the night sequence just feel so flat and matter-of-fact with no sense of chill or dreaminess or anything. It’s a movie fully lacking in visual personality, probably the greatest backbone to making even the bad Halloween movies watchable in some capacity.\n\nHalloween 5 is not alone in its company of slasher films for the absurdly terrible year that 1989 – when it was released – turned out to be, with A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child and Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan each heralding the first death of the slasher genre’s heyday. But it feels like the entry with the least to offer, everything about it basically going through slasher movie motions without the slightest bit of inspiration. The most engaged the film seems to be with itself is the suggestive presence of a mysterious Man in Black (also played by Shanks) hanging around in the background and watching over the proceedings with a menace that leads itself into the movie’s exhausting sequel hook final beat. But that in itself seems to reveal what makes Halloween 5 feel so much like an obligation: it was a movie made to act as a trailer for its next entry, like a proto-MCU movie that’s trying to shovel in a mythos for a character like Michael Myers who did not invite any reason to explore what makes him such an impactful entity. If only the movie in and of itself promised any excitement to come.\n\n*Mind you that subtitle is missing from the actual in-film title card.\n\n**The originally targeted director was Jeff Burr, who went on after losing the job to direct another major slasher sequel Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III. That movie’s not very good either, but compared to this disaster, it makes me think of what could have been.\n\nSo Halloween III made less money than expected? That was enough to make Dino de Laurentiis jump ship. And audiences apparently demanded to see more of Michael Myers and nothing else? Well, that wasn’t exactly enough to convince John Carpenter and Debra Hill to disembark, but their early struggles in development to determine a suitable premise in agreement with Moustapha Akkad led eventually to them just deciding to wash their hands of the franchise by selling their rights to it*. So now the entire franchise was left in the hands of the moneyman to just arbitrarily write-off the deaths of not only Michael Myers but also Donald Pleasence’s zealous psychiatric adversary Dr. Sam Loomis after they pretty conclusively got sucked into a fireball at the end of Halloween II. And to top it all off, the screenplay Akkad seemed satisfied enough to move forward with production on was written by Alan B. McElroy, a scribe who we have the foresight in 2022 for recognizing over such exemplary dramaturgy as Spawn, Left Behind, and Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever. All for the sake of maintaining some credibility with the franchise name. Halloween is basically doomed, isn’t it?\n\nWell it is, but surprisingly Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers was not a nail in its coffin. In fact, it tore off a couple of those nails. The production gave Halloween a new lifeline despite the absence of Carpenter, Hill, cinematographer Dean Cundey, or star Jamie Lee Curtis (who was too deep in the momentum of her post-slasher stardom to go back to that well just yet…). All four of those are pretty critical shoes to fill as causes for the first movie’s success as a work of art, but if I was to pick the most essential one to Halloween 4‘s accomplishment, it’s probably Curtis’ replacement. Instead of simply one actor for the role of final girl, Halloween 4 saw the adequate substitute to be two: Ellie Cornell was cast as the teenage Rachel Carruthers while Rachel’s adopted little sister Jamie Lloyd was played by Danielle Harris.\n\nJamie Lloyd is central in the fixations of a surviving Michael Myers (this go-round being played by Tom Morga or his mid-production replacement George P. Wilbur and donning a new mask whose eyebrows and cheeks make it tougher to take seriously as he looks more like… shall we say… Teddy Perkins?). This is because she is in fact his niece – the orphaned daughter of a deceased Laurie. And Jamie herself has got her own fixations on Michael with continuous nightmares of a masked man rolling up and killing her, which is enough to make her uneasy within a foster family that is as benign as one could hope. The only real tension comes from Rachel being volun-told to babysit Jamie over her Halloween boyfriend plans. Once Myers decides to fulfill these nightmares by escaping a custody transfer, Dr. Loomis races right back into Haddonfield to catch the attention of the current Sheriff Ben Meeker (Beau Starr) and get Jamie and Rachel holed up in Meeker’s barricaded home with a set of officers. As Michael finds his way into the home, Rachel finds herself the one person between her sister and her living doom.\n\nAs you can tell, this is a sparse narrative almost as worthy of Carpenter and Hill’s original screenplay. And while it’s not particularly a swift movie even with the below-90-minute runtime it has – there’s a subplot involving Rachel’s unscrupulous boyfriend Brady (Sasha Jenson) finding his way into the Sheriff’s home ahead of time to answer a booty call by Meeker’s daughter Kelly (Kathleen Kinmont), ostensibly existent only to answer the tawdry demands of the slasher genre and pad the body count – but the simplicity in the three-pronged conflict between Rachel, Jamie, and Michael is an appreciated manner of refocusing what this franchise’s strengths were in thriller fundamentals. And the locked house scenario at the latter half acts as a horror movie remake of Rio Bravo the way that you’d expect Carpenter to indulge (and he did).\n\nReally though, Halloween 4‘s winning strategy ends up being its focus on Rachel and Jamie’s relationship as sisters, which is given good enough bones from the screenplay but truly enhanced by Cornell and Harris as actors. The two of them give here the two best performances the franchise would see since the original film and arguably the remainder of the franchise save for one final return by Curtis, certainly outshining Pleasence’s frustratingly sedate outing as Loomis until the ending beat allows him to shout like we want him to. Harris handles a complex mix between unrelenting dread that escalates into terror but then transforms that into fascination with finally meeting the figure from her worst dreams. By that merit, her psychologically sophisticated performance is single-handedly justifying Halloween II‘s infamous twist more than any other non-Rob Zombie follow-up. Cornell is more down-to-earth and conventional as a slasher film heroine comes, but her chemistry with Harris grounds the conflict with a recognizable desire to protect your younger sibling and deepens the most essential stakes of this film.\n\nThat’s a lot of words without even acknowledging the director Dwight H. Little and that’s mostly because he stays out of the way of the parts that make it work, acting as a much more functional journeyman than Rosenthal in Halloween II in that he’s not interested in mimicking the long takes and color grading of the 1978 film. That makes things a little less stylish and visually interesting but Little does bring one boon to the proceedings: he is the first director in the franchise to come from the Midwest and the Ohio-born director works exceptionally well with cinematographer Peter Lyons Collister to transform the springtime Salt Lake City into a believable Illinois in the middle of autumn, starting the movie at its peak of gorgeousness with magic hour fields against the opening credits. Collister goes even further to distinguish this from his predecessor Cundey’s work when it comes to ignoring all the nighttime blues (which remain present in outdoor scenes) for heavy blacks that weigh down the interiors of that Sheriff’s house, bringing a different flavor of visual intensity from the dreaminess of the first two Myers entries.\n\nNobody will ever mistake Halloween 4 for a masterful work of art, but its ambitions were never such and that does plant a hard ceiling on how well it works. But all the ingredients introduced to replace the best components of the 1978 masterpiece end up resulting in something that is more than the sum of its parts. The outcome is an entry that is satisfying enough as a middle-of-the-road slasher thriller, but also brings a lot more promise in its two young heroines and the direction they can take things story-wise. No way the franchise could possibly undercut them after saving Halloween, is there?\n\n(Also this has a personal place of esteem for yours truly as one of two movies that most inspired my favorite contemporary musician of all, guitarist Brian “Buckethead” Carroll. So, y’know, extra love for that even if the other movie is the shrill Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2).\n\n*Carpenter, once again in characteristic fanboy fashion, fought hard alongside Debra Hill to get a greenlight on a draft they commissioned from another genre literature heavyweight: Dennis Etchison.\n\nOstensibly part of John Carpenter and Debra Hill’s unwillingness in their participation with Halloween II is that they wanted to continue the Halloween franchise, they just didn’t want to have to do it with Michael Myers. In fact, they had long visualized it as an anthology film themed around the holiday and after ostensibly closing the book on Myers, they finally got the opportunity to realize that with Halloween III: Season of the Witch. They convinced their old friend and art director Tommy Lee Wallace to jump on-board as director (although this time Wallace was the second choice after Joe Dante dropped out close to the last second) and Carpenter got his fanboy dreams recognized by having iconic sci-fi horror author Nigel Kneale write the initial draft of the screenplay (but he found the process working with Dante and executive producer Dino de Laurentiis so deflating that he requested to be uncredited, the final screenplay credit is to Wallace for his revisions).\n\nTo the dismay of all, the movie was released to critical failure (not commercial failure, though it performed disappointingly enough that de Laurentiis decided to jump off the Halloween train after this). The 4 decades since have found this movie receiving a revisionist reclamation for its value as a horror picture and a view into a possibly different direction for the entire franchise. Some of that comes with the not-terribly-well-founded claims that the movie got its bad rap because outside of a diegetic usage of the 1978 film as a plot point, Michael Myers is nowhere to be seen.\n\nI think the record should be set straight: Halloween III does not suck due to an absence of Michael Myers.\n\nHalloween III does suck, though.\n\nPlaying entirely fair, there are good parts of Halloween III but they are severely backloaded and that makes the watch a painful waiting game. So it only makes sense to start from the beginning: we open in on a very distressed old man (Al Berry) being chased by men in suits, one of whom he manages to dispatch of in a very unnatural way, before being taken by a good Samaritan to a hospital*. The hospital calls in their best doctor, Dr. Dan Challis (Tom Atkins), whose work ethic seems strongly driven by a desire to be in a different room than his kids and ex-wife. In any case, the new patient is murdered before the sun comes up and identified by his daughter Ellie (Stacey Nelkin) to be a local toy store owner Harry Grimbridge. Which seems to explain why the only thing he had on him was a novelty jack-o-lantern mask made by a mysterious toy company on the Northern coast of California named Silver Shamrock. Ellie happens to have been re-examining the circumstances behind her father’s death and recruits Dr. Challis to come with her to the related company town of Santa Mira** and see what precisely goes on up there.\n\nThat gets us about halfway through the movie and probably a good point to confess something on why I find Halloween III such a major bore. It’s easy to understand the appeal of an 80s movie where some cool action movie-faced guy is such a stud that all the ladies want to get at him, including of course the grieving daughter of a man who died in this stud’s care (for the cover story Ellie gives is that they are newlyweds and far be it from any red-blooded man to object to playing the part with Nelkin). And so while I understand the cult of Tom Atkins that almost certainly feels a contingent of the cult following turning this movie’s reception around, I am not a member of it. I simply cannot find that guy appealing as a lead in any factor. It’s not as huge a problem when he’s a member of an ensemble like in his earlier collaboration with Carpenter, The Fog, but him alone to carry a movie? Sorry but he just doesn’t have any charisma. It just feels like an taxman was recruited to play a Chuck Norris role.\n\nSo that was honestly always going to be something of a dealbreaker and it doesn’t help that the mystery plotting Atkins feels so blatantly pro forma just to get us on our way to Santa Mira. Virtually every clue that guides them to that place is already brought in hand by Ellie’s introduction as a character and the direction it’s pointing to is flashing right in front of our eyes every second of the epileptic commercial for Silver Shamrock including an earwormy theme song that’s recognizably “London Bridge”. I’m willing to bet a quarter of the runtime is dedicated to that commercial and burning it into the viewer’s brain by the end, which I’m going to consider a plus in the interest of generosity and the knowledge of what the movie does with that material. But it makes for a slow investigation that follows characters who are not at all interesting to begin with – at least Dr. Challis has character traits, Ellie has none to speak of – and the ridiculous skipping of the title cards declaring the dates from October 25th to October 29th doesn’t help things (was there absolutely no way they couldn’t just have the movie start later? It was ONLY the title cards declaring the chronology).\n\nBesides that, Santa Mira as a location itself has three traits, two of which I already mentioned and the last one is enervating to the point of destroying any tension: it’s populated by Irish stereotypes hoarier than The Quiet Man and only slightly less hoary than a Lucky Charms commercial, brogues a plenty. I can see a manner in which its low activity, its isolation, and its closeness to a foreboding industrial edifice like the Silver Shamrock factory could give way to a strong eeriness but the cartoon voice coming out of the motel owner just detaches the entire space from any threat it could give.\n\nStill the arrival of the two in Santa Mira mean that our waiting game is almost over: by the time they finagle their way into a private tour of Shamrock’s facilities hosted gregariously by the founder Conal Cochran (Dan O’Herlihy), the men in suits are surrounding our duotagonists and the car of Ellie’s father is found at the facility. That’s discovered just in between witnessing the making of the amusing masks that Shamrock is taking the Trick-or-Treaters by storm with and that’s a sequence I find personally fascinating in depicting the process of creating latex masks. In addition to the jack o’ lantern, we have a witch and a skull and all three of them are especially vibrant and fun to look at with their thick caricature lines and solid colors that I confess if I had the opportunity to have one of each (designed by none other than the legendary Don Post company), I’d take it in a heartbeat. So the desirability of these masks, to the point that Dr. Challis’ own kids roast his ass in an early sequence for getting them lame ass masks while their mom won the night for getting them Silver Shamrock masks, is very credible here.\n\nAnd this is part of the biggest trouble I have with Halloween III, which requires I work very hard not to involve spoilers: it becomes a better movie, but on the basis of plot revelations that are fully incompatible with the cheap paranoid thriller that preceded it. I suppose one could already guess based on Nigel Kneale’s involvement that this will eventually have to do with folklore and be declared in mystic menace by the character easiest to guess is behind all this. But it still tries to tie itself particularly to the grounded industrial mystery and specifically leans into the science fiction in a manner that absolutely makes the film a wreckage of tone and atmosphere. There’s weird movies where you’re astounded by how far they went and there’s weird movies where you end up wondering how did anyone sign off on these components without checking if they fit together. This is sadly the latter.\n\nAnd yet there’s still a momentary reveal of what the endgame is for the villains that is as absolutely unnerving in its implication of violence, its invocation of creeping gross-out creature imagery, and its disorienting undercutting of nuclear domesticity (targeted at a family that up until this scene was part of the grating humor, which only adds brutality of the moment). And there’s the dispatching of the mysterious henchmen in suits surrounding our protagonists that brings hallucinatory bodily dysfunction involving fluids totally incongruous with our knowledge of what those henchmen are, by this point.\n\nMost of all, our regular MVP of the franchise up to this point, cinematographer Dean Cundey, returns for his final time in the Halloween franchise to comfortably play with the California landscape’s greens rather than against it now that we have a movie actually set in that state. And his control over the thick blacks of the night are no less en force here than they were in that film, this time allowing him the opportunity for a montage during the climax of the picture portraying children as playful autumnal silhouettes on the hills of North California against an illogically red sunset. Any retaining sense of Halloween verve and atmosphere is almost entirely pulled onto the film by Cundey’s expertise with color and shadow in a manner that plays within Halloween III‘s goals rather than feel separate from the film.\n\nI admire the cult trying to salvage this movie’s reputation, I really do. One certainly has to admire Carpenter and Hill’s desire to switch things up after they went about as far as they felt they could go with the Michael Myers story and there’s absolutely great stuff here. But that stuff sticks out against a movie that feels like a madlibs exercise of various genre ideals stacked into a desperation to prove this franchise doesn’t need Myers. The humor, the plot, the casting, and the atmosphere are all doing that thing where they are functioning for an entirely different movie from one another. That discordancy in the movie ends up quite exhausting to watch to the point that when it finally gets itself together within the darkened halls of that Silver Shamrock factory (right down to an excellent doom-heavy final beat), it’s too little too late.. I’m sorry to Michael Margetis if he’s reading this, but shots of Tom Atkins’ ass are simply not enough.\n\n*Currently I’m in the middle of rewatching this whole franchise with my cousin (who is encountering these films for the first time) and he recognized that the hospital where Dr. Challis works appears to be the exact same set as the hospital where most of Halloween II takes place.\n\n**Another instance of John Carpenter showing his fanboyishness, given that Santa Mira is the central location of Don Siegel’s 1956 classic Invasion of the Body Snatchers.\n\nI’ll be honest: my attempt to write about Halloween felt like a daunting task, maybe the most daunting in all my reviews. Not simply in a “what is there to say that’s new” kind of way or in a “I have already failed with my first review to satisfy myself” (though those were both active anxieties) but in a “how do I comprehensively put into words the deep and unique pleasure I have watching this thing work”. I’ll let time decide whether or not I have sufficiently represented my intense feelings on that movie’s workings, which is not as certain as fellow horror masterpiece mulligan review subjects Suspiria or Night of the Living Dead, both of which made me feel like I said what I needed to say and could make peace. It just got to the point where I had to click “publish” and move on with my life.\n\nFortunately, Halloween II – the 1981 sequel to the 1978 masterpiece, mind you – doesn’t seem like it needs that kind of apprehensiveness at all: it graces me with a film that came out just as Friday the 13th kick-started the explosive slasher overglut of the 1980s (specifically in the year I’d identify as the best for the subgenre). In that Halloween represents the quintessence of that subgenre’s blunt force potential, Halloween II is merely another 1980s slasher picture.\n\nYou can hardly blame Moustapha Akkad – after executive producing the first Halloween – for jumping on the new hot movie thing in the 1980s, that’s just savvy business mind. Who wouldn’t expect the sequel to the previous most profitable budget-to-earning picture of all time* to make some more dime, especially after Friday the 13th‘s overnight success blew the floodgates wide open? And you also couldn’t expect anything less of his new partner in funding this picture: the legendary Dino de Laurentiis, no stranger at all to mercenary pursuits in cinematic moneymaking. And hey, they even did the smart thing of re-involving the people responsible for Halloween being such an impactful masterpiece: stars Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence, cinematographer Dean Cundey, producer and co-writer Debra Hill and of course the director/producer/composer/co-writer John Carpenter. Except this time around Carpenter opted to remove himself from the director’s chair and hand it over to the original film’s production designer Tommy Lee Wallace, who declined (and yet this shan’t be the last time we refer to Wallace in this franchise run, faith and begorra!). From there, the production settled on Rick Rosenthal, a television journeyman.\n\nIn any case, de Laurentiis’ involvement meant more budget money than the humble beginnings of Halloween and therefore a more impressive and well put-together work, wouldn’t it?\n\nWell… as it turned out, that was only the case for Cundey.\n\nAnd wouldn’t you know it, part of the fault of Halloween II‘s failings lay specifically at Carpenter’s feet as its co-writer. It’s fairly easy for someone such as I and others who consider the essential terror of Michael Myers as a figure to be his mystique to declare this movie’s notorious twist as its fatal flaw. And it is, to be fair, a terrible twist: probably my least favorite in all of cinema, one that recontextualizes its predecessor with a logic pat enough to suffocate everything good about that movie. But it does not do to forget that the movie leading up to that moment had terrible bones to begin with, ostensibly the result of Carpenter and Hill – by the former’s admission – writing a sequel they didn’t even want to exist**: our heroine Laurie Strode (Curtis) is relegated to a virtual non-entity and the flippancy embodied by Dr. Sam Loomis (Pleasence) and Sheriff Leigh Brackett (Charles Cyphers, the one other return from the original cast) lead to a teenage boy being killed by the police with no faze whatsoever to their consciences. Mind you, that death occurs in a explosive ball of fire (because that’s Dino de Laurentiis for you) and requires the identification of the boy through dental records (because that’s what the actual fuck).\n\nBut all of that is getting ahead of discussing what Halloween II is actually portraying: Hill and Carpenter’s screenplay opts to take place on the same Halloween night as the first movie, beginning at the very last moments of the previous film just as Laurie evacuates the children she’s babysitting. Michael (Dick Warlock in whatever shots are not Nick Castle and Tony Moran from the first film) attempts to attack her once more and Loomis appears just in time to shoot Michael right over a balcony. Yet when Loomis attempts to confirm his kill, the body is gone.\n\nQuite honestly, this opening sequence is the earliest point where you can tell something is wrong: it’s mostly the same footage as in the first movie, but the shots that are new feel like they’re using entirely perfunctory angles that mute any expressiveness and it adds the weird choice to have Loomis look down from the balcony (a la the ending of the first film which confirmed he was looking at an empty patch), run downstairs, look again from outside at the blank spot, and NOW HE’S SHOCKED. Even outside of the abrupt shift that the new shots bring, there’s a complete disconnect from what Loomis is doing and thinking per each shot so I’m not sure Rosenthal and editor Mike Goldblatt had that mapped out.\n\nAnyway, after Loomis goes back on alert mode and scoffs to an annoyed neighbor “you don’t know what death is”, he runs into the night as Carpenter’s iconic theme plays… in this truly warped thicker pop music tone that feels more disarming than the re-cutting of the opening sequence. It’s probably the second most fatal element of this movie’s source of tension right behind that twist, which only further ensures that giving John Carpenter more money doomed the hell out of this project because if there’s one musical score that did not need a polished remix, it’s the Halloween theme.\n\nAs Loomis continues his hunt for Myers with Deputy Gary Hunt (Hunter von Leer), whom Sheriff Brackett tapped out for so he can grieve his daughter as a victim of Myers’ rampage, Laurie is admitted into Haddonfield Memorial Hospital with Michael in a strict tow to finish off the teenage trio he terrorized hours ago. Her only apparent ally in her certainty that Michael is still coming for her is a paramedic named Jimmy (Lance Guest) as the remaining staff find themselves going straight from the graveyard shift to the grave. Jimmy turns out to do most of the leg work while Laurie mostly has to crawl her way out of bed and out of frame for most of the runtime. So we have material that has Pleasence amping up his histrionics to a level beyond the relatively collected but still nervy work he did in the masterpiece prior and we have Curtis having virtually nothing to do except lay on a bed or limp around. And I’m sorry but Jimmy just ain’t cutting it as a human presence.\n\nOn top of the extra gaudiness that the plot ensures – complete with a nurse hot tub sex scene interrupted by a murder because de Laurentiis KNEW what kids went to slashers in the 80s for – this is all delivered in a painfully perfunctory manner by Rosenthal’s blunt summary direction. Carpenter is not particularly a filmmaker who is given to “artistic flourishes” for their sake, he’s there to make the most efficient thriller but he also crafted a unique atmosphere out of less tools than this production. Rosenthal is connecting the plot threads and calling it a day on almost anything else.\n\nIt’s not a complete wash craft-wise. I mentioned Cundey up above as a triumphant return and it’s true: the extra money meant he could be more deliberate and deeper with his usage of shadows and blues that results in some beautiful images like Jimmy finding an exsanguinated corpse in a high-angle single spotlight where the blood on the floor relegates it a theatrical red splash in an abyss. Or a close-up of Michael’s mask with a single trail of red running down his white mask from each eyehole. These are among the few poetic images that feel aligned with the giallo roots of the slasher genre to begin with (which is also apparent in how one death is ripped from Deep Red).\n\nBut mostly that money is not going to artistry – even elements of Cundey’s work like the increased amount of long-takes that are impressive but don’t have either the ambition or psychological cache of the steadicam shots of the first film – and Halloween II ends up feeling like the antithesis of everything that made Halloween work. It seems, even though the objective to make money with this is no different than what conjured the initial masterpiece to begin with, everything wrong comes from Dino de Laurentiis giving too much money and no challenges: we have explosions and a bouncy score and a whole lot of idiot plot convolutions to justify itself. Sometimes you’re George Miller and expand your palette from such freedom. This isn’t that. John Carpenter – much as it burned him out of filmmaking in the long run – was at his best when under the wire.\n\n*That record was broken the year immediately after Halloween‘s success by Mad Max.\n\n** “Mainly dealt with a lot of beer, sitting in front of a typewriter saying ‘What the fuck am I doing? I don’t know.'” is a direct quote from Carpenter according to Murray Leeder’s writing on the franchise and it only goes to remind me that interviews from someone as no-nonsense as Carpenter are kind of my favorite thing and I would definitely encourage anyone to seek out as many as possible for their reading and listening pleasure.\n\nIf I made a mulligan on every review here that I think does not hold up, this blog would be going nowhere at all, even by the standards of how much my posting here has slowed to a crawl. Nevertheless, there’s been no movie previously reviewed that I found more deserving of a second go at than John Carpenter’s 1978 classic horror film Halloween – 8 years after having shared an insufficient split-post with fellow mulligan’d horror masterpiece Night of the Living Dead. This is partially because Halloween is one of the movies I think about most often, a point of intersection between my love for slasher cinema, for movies that make minimal resources feel properly big, and as an example of peak fundamental form.\n\nAnd I guess the only better context to revisit this classic than Shout! Factory’s current 4K re-release of the original franchise is the imminent “finale” of at least the recent David Gordon Green trilogy, Halloween Ends, a title which makes promises certainly not going to be kept as long as it keeps money in Carpenter and Malek Akkad’s pockets. And it’s a context that compels me to review the full feature film franchise from 1978 all the way to 2022.\n\nBut let’s start from the beginning: obviously not the beginning of slasher cinema as we know it, given how Halloween is preceded by The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and Black Christmas alone (and if you’re even snootier about the starting line, there’s Psycho, Peeping Tom, Blood and Black Lace, and Bay of Blood but I don’t think those are correct), but the starting line of addressing what Halloween is outside of the legacy it made as the most profitable picture of its time, as a recognizable horror brand, and as a foundational blueprint for the slasher boom in the 1980s. Because you take away all that context – including the developments that the sequels provide to the characters, which we will complain about when we get to them – and what you have…\n\n… is a simple straightforward yarn: One Halloween in the sleepy Illinois town of Haddonfield, an indistinct shape of a man (Nick Castle) is following a young babysitter with stoic obsessive focus. That nutshell summary is basically all the essence needed for this movie, a stripped-down elemental tale scripted by Carpenter and his long-time producer Debra Hill of predator and prey and the dread that is pulled out of such a random and evil occurrence. Given that that man is the subject of his own frantic chase by his doctor Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence), we have the context to know this man is Michael, who 15 years earlier as a child (Will Sandin) murdered the teenage Judith Myers (Sandy Johnson) before being institutionalized and escaping the night of 30 October 1978. And that context is probably more information than we should want to maintain this story’s mystique except for two things in its favor…\n\nTo begin with, that murder is portrayed to us from the very first scene with a miraculous first-person Steadicam shot (made up of two, but there’s an extremely well-disguised cut) as we watch Judith make out with her boyfriend from outside through a window, enter the house after her boyfriend has been satisfied by like… 3 minutes of action it seems (teenagers…), follow the stairs up to her room, stab her to death (with an awkward stare at the stabbing hand at one point), and exit the home in time to have his mask removed in a chilling cut that reveals him staring off absently into the night. And the uninterrupted smoothness of that ambitious camera movement is more than just Carpenter and cinematographer Dean Cundey showing off how much they can get done in a take: it’s a very cinematic way to portray the fixation of a patient assailant to just have the camera lock onto a character and never waver or cant. It’s a discomfort putting us in the headspace of that violent individual and feels no less alien seeing things through Michael’s eyes than watching in horror from the third-person. Compare that to the brilliant hypnotic low-level shots of fellow Steadicam exemplar The Shining and it’s fair to say horror cinema exhausted the capabilities of that game-changing tool.\n\nBut the other thing is that this cold turkey open into an act of random violence feels no more explicable than Michael’s sudden stalking of Laurie in the movie itself proper. There’s no explanation, no motivation, barely any discernable dialogue and only the smallest identifiers of the characters. It is fully impossible to comprehend the thoughts behind Sandin’s vacant stare as the camera hovers away and above the scene.\n\nAnd that’s the launchpad for Michael Myers as character and performance, at least in terms of the 1978 film. He’s fully unknowable. Nick Castle’s performance of the character as adult is an understated masterstroke of minimizing any motion that could betray the possibility of relating to this giant figure, to the point that the famous moment where he stares at a body he just pinned to the wall and cants his head back and forth only furthers the distance between the viewer and this force of evil, daring us to figure out what thought process is communicated by that shift. Certainly it helps prevent reality from interfering with Loomis’s doom-laden monologues on how Michael was identified by him as “pure evil” since childhood and making him look like a terrible psychiatrist. You can’t dehumanize a figure that the movie treats as inhuman, even when Michael appears otherwise grounded. We can’t see him as flesh and blood for most of the film: just his characteristic all-white William Shatner mask and faded dark boiler suit. Hell, even his actions don’t seem corporeal as – outside of Judith’s killing with a large splotch of stageblood – none of the kills are particularly bloody. The production explanation is probably based on the limitations of this admirably low-budget picture, the contextual basis is probably in how most of the deaths are by Michael’s firm hand rather than a knife and the one on-screen knife kill is bathed in darkness. Whatever the case, the aftermath is nevertheless dissonant from the vicious brutality performed.\n\nSo, everything vague about Halloween as a situation is anchored to Michael himself and that’s something the movie wields gloriously. But that vagueness especially cuts deep when dropped into the specificity of a plausible real-world town targeting plausible human characters. Which is where the cast comes in: I’ve mentioned Pleasence’s heightened alarmist take on Dr. Loomis but he seems more like an urgent element than a source of naturalism in the cast (though his screen partner for the latter half, Charles Cyphers, reacts to him with due skepticism of an everyman). It is in Curtis’ exemplary example of a horror movie final girl in Laurie Strode – the babysitter Michael locks into his sightlines – with her down-to-earth personality and intelligence that provides that anchor to reality as she plays into a lengthy wariness at the figure she sees in the distance. And aiding that even with their stock type characterizations are PJ Soles, Nancy Kyes, and Brian Andrews portraying believably clumsy sex-obsessed teenagers. We’re not talking about 1:1 psychological realism here, merely characters we’d buy as a first impression walking by them on the sidewalk.\n\nAnd the city they populate is just as well something we’d recognize as a small town, the arena in which Carpenter and cinematographer Dean Cundey show their best hand. First, there’s the application of Panavision’s anamorphic width to stress the depth and distance of that shape staring at us from behind the hedge or beyond the window. In the lines of the hedge, windows, and streets through those “Michael watching” shots, we have perfect visual parallels to the frame’s length or height so that the interruption of that far-off figure stands out and captures our eye, aligning with Laurie’s suspicions so the viewer feels eerie too.\n\nAnd then there’s the coloring, which is probably the most fun thing to talk about. The story of Carpenter and Cundey’s problem-solving is endearing to me: having to shoot summertime Pasadena for autumnal Illinois and inspired allegedly by one of the great cinematographic representations of midwestern Halloween Meet Me in St. Louis, they decided to color correct the shit out of the daytime scenes to orange and the nighttime scenes to the deepest blues which doesn’t make Haddonfield more recognizable but does make it moodier in a strong way reconciles the realism of the setting with the mythic element of Michael, especially during the night scenes that Carpenter openly confessed were inspired by Suspiria. Halloween‘s colors aren’t illogical the way Suspiria‘s are, but the blues are affective with a profound spookiness. And I guess the 44 years of home video releases since have given Cundey multiple chances to just continue playing around with the sharpness or color tones of those visuals (the variety has to be deliberate at this point, since there never seems to be an exact match to what played in 1978) and this excites me when a new release comes. In this recent 4K Shout! Factory release’s case, Cundey opted to wash out the daylight oranges with whites which is extraordinarily different from any other version and actually starts to resemble the pre-winter chilliness I feel when I walk my dog on the street as I close up my 2nd year living in Chicago.\n\nWhen it’s shots that Michael and his prey get to share together, it’s even stronger in expressing the relationships between the teenagers and the unknown: a two-shot of a frightened Laurie in a darkened blue hallway with a doorframe filled with black before a key light illuminates Michael watching in the darkness, just enough to recognize him without separating him from that inky abyss. Another two-shot of Laurie completely shaken in the foreground as Michael sits upright after being prone in the background. A shot of a woman strangled through the haziness of a dark car windshield in a garage. A single bedsheet ghost standing upright in a doorway staring directly at us as we sit in the perspective of his next victim. All of which gets stronger in the context of indoor sequences that call attention to the walls and their angles against the frame trapping these characters with Myers in dreadful fatalism.\n\nAnd of course – even at the risk of derailing my train of momentum – one can’t possibly close out an accolade of Halloween as a work without acknowledging Carpenter’s immediately iconic score and what it does for the movie’s suspicious tension, a result of how strange it is: minimalist in its reliance on a synthesizer’s high tones, abnormal with its odd 5/4 time signature, fast-tempo’d in a manner that influences the heartbeat of one who hears it, and particularly used in a sharp way to stress Michael’s appearance as an audible premonition of an evil deed to come. It’s a properly uncanny accompaniment to the Shape (as Castle is to be credited as in the cast) and the final layer to connecting the spare storytelling to the specifics of who and where that is to be forever marked by this grave presence.\n\nSo that’s the power of Halloween put together by the cast and crew behind it: a bedtime story monster brought into a setting that could reasonably be identified for the street right outside your door and attacking people that your could have bumped past a few days ago without realizing. An “it happened in your neighborhood” sort of fable of mysterious doom fixating on otherwise unexceptional people. All of these brought together by poetic technique applied to mundane real-world lives. None of this is particularly innovative in the wake of Hitchcock or Black Christmas or the endless gialli and Carpenter never pretended otherwise. But like Citizen Kane – a movie that wasn’t the first to do the things it did but instead found the most exhaustive ways to use the tools it was adopting – so too did Halloween basically give final form to what the quintessential slasher movie is by simply knowing the vocabulary of tension and violence and fear from those influences and getting the best mixture of those ingredients to never be surpassed again. And as Laurie and Loomis confirm when their paths finally converge in the final minutes of the film, the end creation is the boogeyman.\n\nThis morning, Jean-Luc Godard was announced by his family as having passed away at the age of 91.\n\nHe’s a figure who shouldn’t necessitate introduction, so it’s merely the compulsion in me to acknowledge that his death feels like the last line to an entirely distant world of cinema has been disconnected from our time. Not only in that he was the last surviving figure of the groundbreaking French New Wave movement that held up a mirror to the medium, but in that I can’t think of any other filmmaker who was working at a time before “modern cinema” as we consider it was established. And part of that was his own fault as his debut 1960 feature Breathless in its casual vogue and aggressive slicing of the tendons we consider in the portrayal of action and behavior in movies did just as well to demolish and rebuild our sensibilities with how films and narratives are meant to function as the same year’s Psycho and L’Avventura. In the career since he would use that artform as an extension of his interest in reflexively critiquing not only cinema past, and not only cinema to come, but how the world exists and is captured within those 24 frames per second. And this was done comfortably through his own perspective as a Marxist, anti-Zionist, a humanist, and an existentialist, consistently finding means to balance his playfulness towards the building blocks of movies in the function of communicating ideals, some benign (A Woman Is a Woman is easily his most accessible film) and some lacerating (Contempt feels like his angriest of the ones I’ve seen and yet is also my favorite) but always lingering long in my brain and forcing me to re-examine artistic and social conventions in a manner that felt like my imagination was freed up. The result is an easily canonized set of masterpieces in through the 1960s: A Woman Is A Woman, Contempt, Vivre sa Vie, Le Petit Soldat, Band of Outsiders, Alphaville, Pierrot le Fou, Masculin Féminin: 15 Faits Précis, La Chinoise, and Week-end all being movies that I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend as necessary viewings for anyone who wants to be serious about movies.\n\nBut there’s also the late career perspective that he lost his relevance, his ability to capture the zeitgeist, and his energy that indicates a joyous love for the movie and I have long been somebody who called horseshit to all of that personally. Goodbye to Language remains one of the most critical experiences I’ve had watching a movie in the theater and I cannot imagine somebody who didn’t have a bleeding heart for film making something as sprawling an attempt at containing it as Histoire(s) du Cinéma nor someone who has lost sight of what humanity brings to the world in Film Socialisme. Some of you guys may recall my list of the Top 10 Most Valuable Players to Cinema in the 2010s (to say nothing of how both Film Socialisme and Goodbye to Language were among my favorite movies of the decade) and that Godard was on there: he’s a Most Valuable Player to the artform in and of itself, regardless of the time period. Most of all, he and fellow 2022 death Peter Bogdanovich were instances of the film-critic-to-filmmaker pipeline that make a fool like me foolishly hopeful (even though I’m barely writing on here anymore).\n\nAnyway it is, to me, a shame that the last cinematic element through which I think most people would be exposed to him – given how underseen his final film The Image Book is – is his unseen presence over the penultimate film by a fellow French New Wave figure, Agnès Varda’s Faces Places (co-directed with JR). If you have not seen Faces Places, I do encourage you do so before reading the rest of this (and similarly encourage you watch all of the films I’ve noted up above as well as the general works of Varda… Cléo de 5 à 7 is my favorite) as I’m about to poke and prod at a significant spoiler to that. But near the end of that wonderful movie is a sad sequence that displays the characteristic way in which Godard regrettably alienated most of the people in his life, including his contemporaries like Varda. In the sequence as you will see in the video below, Varda and JR both arrive at the home of Godard after a long journey in which they occasionally discuss the history the two of them had together as collaborators [since Godard acted in an early short of Varda, the very amusing Les Fiancés du Pont Mac Donald ou (Méfiez-Vous des Lunettes Noires)] and even being excited enough to compare JR’s fashion to Godard’s. At the time of this movie, Godard and Varda had not spoken since the death of Varda’s husband fellow French New Wave icon Jacques Demy in 1990 (whose movies you should also watch if you love joy and pain in life: The Umbrellas of Cherbourg and The Young Girls of Rochefort is the ideal musical double feature for that).\n\nFaces Places does not reunite the two unfortunately. They arrive to an empty home with only a small message written on the front door’s window: “A la Ville de Douarnenez. Du Côté de la Côte”. And this, in addition to being stood up by her long-time friend, is something she finds upsetting for reasons she explains in such a manner: “A la Ville de Douarnenez” refers to a regular place where Varda, Demy, and Godard would dine together. It also happened to be his only form of communication to Varda when Demy passed away. Having Godard’s absence be compounded by being reminded of the absence of her husband incites her to tearfully decry Godard while graciously leaving bread she bought him for the occasion and leaving behind a message (at least acerbically including “…pas merci d’avoir tenu ta porte fermée”, translated to “… no thanks for keeping your door closed”) before leaving into the very lovely final sequence.\n\nAs far as I know, Varda and Godard never reconciled before Varda herself passed away in 2019.\n\nBefore I move forward, I want to make clear that the unfortunate truth is that Varda was hurt by what Godard wrote. That’s simply the result of the matter. What I say is not to excuse the action or to devalue Varda’s feelings on meeting a closed door that brought back painful memories – not only of her late husband, but on the last word from somebody who was pretty much estranged as Varda seems to have found this message unsatisfactory and not sufficiently comforting when mourning Demy – but simply to discuss what this moment suggested in the complexity of Godard’s unconscious antagonism. Because when I first saw Faces Places, I joined the same kneejerk condemnation of Godard’s behavior as virtually everyone performed (to the frustrating degree that it ended up being more often discussed than Faces Places itself as a movie). But in the 5 years since, I find I no longer think Godard performed this act to affront Varda. I think it was as much an attempt to square with himself as Contempt was.\n\nWhen Godard sent that note to Varda 27 years prior, it seemed to invite the revisiting of a time the three of them shared together an act of sincerity and on the face of it, Godard appears to want to invite that pleasant memory once again. But one has to assume Godard was aware that Varda was frustrated by the minimal communication Godard offered in condolences given the lengthy silence between them before Varda reached out about visiting with JR. Nevertheless, bringing it up at the door feels like maybe an extended attempt at apologism for his early communication while still trying to invoke a time and place that one has to assume was pleasant for all parties.\n\nIn regards to Godard’s absence… well, I’m not sure such a reunion would be something that most people – especially a filmmaker – would want to have performed on camera. There’s no reason to suppose that Varda would not have had the camera turned off if he had been present and asked, but Godard was not there to request it and I honestly can’t find myself begrudging a man his privacy… only the way he failed to properly correspond with someone who was genuinely excited to reunite with her friend. At the very least, the most cryptic part of his message – “Du Côté de la Côte” which translates to “along the coast” and references an early short Varda made (that everybody should also go watch) – feels to me like an acknowledgement of the journey Varda and JR took rather than just simply considering it a small task.\n\nMaybe I’m being overly generous. Maybe I’m a little bit frustrated also that this single scene was more often used by the internet as a cudgel to talk shit on Godard rather than an anchor to praise Varda’s ability to turn the moment into a launchpad for a touching ending at Faces Places. It certainly was not outside of the norm for Godard to act as a heel to others, even beyond the passionate combativeness with which he stood for his politics and expressed his views on the world circa now (though I do feel there are comments of his that are undeniably antisemitic in divorce from his public decrying of fascism, Nazism, and his long-time defense of Palestine). Both of his ex-wives and former collaborators Anna Karina and Anne Wiazemsky have established his coldness as a person towards them at the end of their time together (hell, Contempt is again basically just dramatizing Godard’s breakdown from Karina). Fellow French New Wave contemporary François Truffaut had his own long and public falling out with Godard through the 60s that met a hard crash after a pair of letters sent since Truffaut’s 1973 film Day for Night (another movie you all must watch) asking for funding to make a film together while calling Day for Night fraudulent as a picture (and asking actor and frequent Truffaut collaborator Jean-Pierre Léaud for money too, which REALLY pissed Truffaut off and brought him to dress Godard down from all angles).\n\nOn the special features of the Criterion release for Day for Night, Dudley Andrew argues however based on film references within the letter and postage that as characteristically standoffish as Godard’s communication to Truffaut was… it was an attempt to reconcile as co-workers trying to make movies together. At first glance at this interview, I found it similarly generous for somebody as regularly tough to deal as Godard is. But reading deeper into the matter causes me to consider that Godard as a person was probably as non-straightforward as his films are and while understanding how that became something that certain people formerly in his life decided to wash their hands clean of… why it can be tough to just come right out with asking for your friend to work together again or to have a private moment of remembering your friendship. In particular, the envelope’s return address of “From: a former admirer of J. Daniel-Norman” feels similar to “A la Ville de Douarnenez”: Godard is naming a filmmaker that Truffaut bonded in love for, Jacques Daniel-Norman, and it feels like another attempt to recall memories of camaraderie with Truffaut working in Cahiers du Cinéma.\n\nAnyway, I have no doubt that I’d sooner prefer to be friends with Varda and Demy than Godard (Truffaut… probably, but I would have to think on it knowing his own tempers). But Godard does strike me as somebody who spent his life trying to fight a good fight. He was another human being: extraordinary in areas, unacceptable in others, full of contradictions. And I find the two following quotes give something of a window on what happened to his former friendship with Truffaut:\n\n““If we tore each other apart, little by little, it was for fear of being the first to be eaten alive.”\n\nAnd why his devotion for the one artform he’s changed irrevocably has transformed into such an easy man to make enemies:\n\n“I think there is something that seems to have stayed with me from the days of the New Wave, even though it no longer exists in this form: arguing about cinema. Because the beautiful thing about cinema is that it still always allows us to argue.”\n\nI don’t know. This is something that’s been swimming in my head for the past several years and Godard’s passing and the shockwave it brings to me knowing that he was one of the last old-school movie giants who lived in the same world as me (last time I had this sense of tremor in me was Ingmar Bergman and Michelangelo Antonioni both dying on the same day) made me want to re-evaluate how I could occasionally find his behavior beyond the screen affrontive. I’m feeling old already at 30 and, I think, growing out of the sort of triggered young combativeness I once had as an animating edge and that he seems to have never lost even through his age of 91. Maybe it’s just envy? Or it’s admiration at how his edge ended up aimed at the complacency of the artform and produced films unlike anything anyone ever made. Anyway… no more French New Wave giants. May they all rest in peace.\n\nYesterday’s gap has broken my streak of doing one of these a day until I run out of summer editions of the quizzes for Sergio Leone and the Infield Fly Rule, but I’m still powering through them anyway. Today’s edition comes from August of 2016 and is titled after a very novel looking fellow from Roman Polanski’s horror-comedy The Fearless Vampire Killers, famously the production in which he met his first wife Sharon Tate. I actually do wonder why I never got around to seeing it and hope to sometime soon, even though I haven’t been in a rush to watch a film by him since 2013 for obvious reasons (I also never caught the soundtrack to the musical adaptation Dance of the Vampires for the reason that I wanted to see this movie).\n\nAnyway, with nothing to say about the namesake, let us move forward on his quiz.\n\n1) Name the last 10 movies you’ve seen, either theatrically or at home\n\n1 – The Wizard of Oz at the Siskel Center in 35mm\n\n2 – Tombs of the Blind Dead off the new Synapse blu-ray\n\n3 – Pontypool at home\n\n4 – Smoking, the 1966 Joe Jones short film, at home\n\n5 – Millennium Actress off the recent Shout! blu-ray\n\n6 – Nope in IMAX\n\n7 – Kwaidan at the Logan Theatre\n\n8 – James and the Giant Peach at the Music Box\n\n9 – Ring at the Logan Theatre\n\n10 – Ju-On: The Grudge at the Logan Theatre\n\n2) Favorite movie feast\n\nBabette’s, baby! Would love to one day recreate it in the kitchen.\n\n3) Dial M for Murder (1954) or Rear Window (1954)?\n\nRear Window\n\n4) Favorite song or individual performance from a concert film\n\nThe Who stealing the fucking show from the Rolling Stones’ Rock and Roll Circus with the most explosive rendition of “A Quick One, While He’s Away” one can imagine without the use of their usual pyrotechnics, provided in their documentary The Kids Are Alright which feels like it fits enough as a concert film to not be cheating (if you think it is… I’ll go with Hendrix doing “Wild Thing” in Monterey Pop).\n\nExcluding another film from the same director, if you were programming a double feature what would you pair with:\n\n5) Alex Cox’s Straight to Hell (1986)?\n\nWoof, I’m expecting a lot of these to be made up of movies I haven’t yet seen and Straight to Hell is particularly embarrassing because I’ve had this on DVD for 8 years now as a gift. Good thing “another film from the same director” is forbidden because my kneejerk was Walker, but with that eliminated… I guess Six-String Samurai, maybe.\n\n6) Benjamin Christensen’s Haxan: Witchcraft Throughout the Ages (1922)?\n\nThe Love Witch, fully aware I’m invoking the work of Anna Biller within 24 hours of her showing her ass for the millionth fucking time.\n\n7) Federico Fellini’s I vitteloni (1953)?\n\nEasily Everybody Wants Some!!, like this is the laziest answer outta me for this one.\n\n8) Vincente Minnelli’s The Long, Long Trailer (1953)?\n\nStanley Donen’s Two for the Road (I have not seen The Long, Long Trailer)\n\n9) Sam Peckinpah’s The Ballad of Cable Hogue (1970)?\n\nMcCabe & Mrs. Miller (I have not seen The Ballad of Cable Hogue and in fact missed a Chicago Film Society screening of it this year)\n\n10) George Englund’s Zachariah (1971)?\n\nThe toughest one because I haven’t even HEARD of this movie. Going off the letterboxd summary of its plot… I guess El Topo?\n\n11) Favorite movie fairy tale\n\nIs it really as basic as The Wizard of Oz? So soon after rewatching it? Probably.\n\n12) What is the sport that you think has most eluded filmmakers in terms of capturing either its essence or excitement?\n\nWrestling, and I mean legit Olympic wrestling. Not pro-wrestling. Can you imagine the gay porn opportunities? I haven’t seen Vision Quest, is that gay enough?\n\n13) The Seventh Seal (1957) or Wild Strawberries (1957)?\n\nWild Strawberries\n\n14) Your favorite Criterion Collection release\n\nTough call, I’ll go with the Brazil box set just for how exhaustive it is: the amount of on-set material, the laying about on what a fucking nightmarish battle it was to get released, the willingness to include the much-compromised cut by the studio, and on top of it all… you get to watch Brazil!\n\n15) In the tradition of the Batley Townswomen’s Guild’s staging of the Battle of Pearl Harbor and Camp on Blood Island, who would be the featured players (individual or tag-team) in your Classic Film Star Free-for-all Fight?\n\nRobert Mitchum and Marlene Dietrich, they both seem like people who could throw the fuck down.\n\n16) Throne of Blood (1957) or The Lower Depths (1957)?\n\nI have not yet seen The Lower Depths so while Throne of Blood is one of my favorite movies, you definitely do not want to underestimate any post-war Kurosawa picture.\n\n17) Your favorite movie snack\n\nI’ve moved away from movie snacks lately, but perhaps Jelly Belly jellybeans? Those are really the ones I’m willing to snack on in a movie theater these days.\n\n18) Robert Altman’s Quintet— yes or no?\n\nThe closest I come yet to a hard no, that movie sucks. But I guess Altman had to get it out of his system somehow so I guess still gotta be my “every movie deserves to exist” yes.\n\n19) Name the documentarian whose work you find most valuable.\n\nFrederick Wiseman, just find his massive institutional fly-on-the-walls very inviting in structure and insightful in comprehensiveness.\n\n20) The Conversation (1974) or The Godfather Part II (1974)?\n\nThe Conversation\n\n21) Favorite movie location you’ve visited in person.\n\nThird time I have to answer this this summer. I guess I’ll go with Woodstock, IL – shooting location of Groundhog Day – where I took my dog one summer day.\n\n22) If you could have directed a scene from any movie in the hope of improving it, what scene would it be, and what direction would you give the actor(s) in it? (question submitted by Patrick Robbins)\n\nGoddamn, this is a tough question to ask because honestly I try to approach movies as is and even when I criticize them, not be like “oh the director shoulda done this to fix it”. It’s like how if I see a painting I don’t like, I’m not gonna say the artist should have used a different style of paint, it just doesn’t speak to me.\n\nIn the spirit of the spot, I’ll go with a much too easy one: I woulda stopped Brando mid-sentence on the set of Superman and told his ass to pronounce “Krypton” correctly.\n\n23) The Doors (1991) or JFK (1991)?\n\nI never finished The Doors, a fact I’m sure my brother would disown me for if he was aware.\n\n24) What is your greatest film blasphemy or strongest evidence of your status as a contrarian? (H/T Larry Aydlette)\n\nEverything I hear about Marlon Brando off-screen suggests he was a fascinating human being, everything I see on-screen outside of On the Waterfront emboldens my attitude he was a terrible actor.\n\n25) Favorite pre-1970 one-sheet\n\n26) Favorite post-1970 one-sheet\n\n27) WarGames (1983) or Blue Thunder (1983)?\n\nI have not seen Blue Thunder.\n\n28) Your candidate for best remake ever made\n\nSome Like It Hot\n\n29) Give us a good story, or your favorite memory, about attending a drive-in movie\n\nShout out to J.A.B., K.C., and Houston (whose last name I keep forgetting) about that time mid-2020 during the early points of the pandemic when the Thunderbird Drive-In in Ft. Lauderdale where we went to see Mad Max: Fury Road. If I were emperor of the universe, only road movies would play at drive-ins.\n\n30) Favorite non-horror Hammer film\n\nOne Million Years B.C.\n\n31) Favorite movie with the word/number “seven” in the title (question submitted by Patrick Robbins)\n\nI’m basic as fuck, cause it’s Seven Samurai.\n\n32) Is there a movie disagreement you can think of which would cause you to reconsider the status of a personal relationship?\n\nIf somebody told me they did not consider Triumph of the Will or The Birth of a Nation to be evil films. I mean, I find absolute aesthetic pleasure in the former and it’s fair to try to approach them both academically but someone who thinks they are not evil works of art is probably somebody I do not want to have in my life.\n\n33) Erin Brockovich (2000) or Traffic (2000)?\n\nErin Brockovich\n\n34) Your thoughts on the recent online petition demanding that Turner Classic Movies cease showing all movies made after 1960.\n\nWack. I’m perfectly willing to admit cinema peaked with the silent era, but you don’t hear me demanding those are the only movies publicly exhibited. I just think it loudly.\n\n(Seriously, though, any metric that does not consider The Sound of Music or Night of the Living Dead classic movies needs to be reconsidered).\n\nOnward with our run down the summer quizzes from Sergio Leone and the Infield Fly Rule, we encounter this April 2015 post (which is not even summer to me, come on! But it IS saying summer in the title) that also doubled as a celebratory 10th anniversary summary post that has been nice enough to function as my primary map to how many quizzes I have left to indulge in. We’re still a long way from the end (assuming Collazzo’s last post from January of this year is unceremoniously his last, but hey… I took forever to post this year too so hope springs eternal…) so let’s keep rolling and avoid me having to acknowledge what a weirdly boring disappointment I found Bad Teacher and Diaz’s performance in it.\n\n1) Name a line from a movie that should’ve become a catch phrase but didn’t *\n\nWe need more and more opportunities to use the phrase “Negative, I am a meat popsicle” or we fail as a society.\n\n2) Your second favorite William Wellman film\n\nDodsworth\n\n3) Viggo Mortensen or Javier Bardem?\n\nMortensen. Sure, the dude has Green Book to blame but he’s so fucking weird in Green Book that I think he’s the only dude that makes it watchable. He is tied to all of Cronenberg’s best 21st Century works and he hangs out with fucking Buckethead. I do love Bardem, but not a contest.\n\n4) Favorite first line from a movie.\n\n“If they move, kill ’em!”\n\n5) The most disappointing/superfluous “director’s cut” or otherwise extended edition of a movie you’ve seen? *\n\nI know I just praised Mortensen to the high heavens, but easily easily easily… The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. Sorry, nerds.\n\n6) What is the movie you feel was most enhanced by a variant version? *\n\nBlade Runner is the easiest go-to (and one could also say the same about Once Upon a Time in America, except I’ve never seen that said by someone who saw the theatrical cut so that feels a bit disingenuous even while I’m sure it’s worse), but I will go ahead and state The Abyss feels like whichever cut you choose, you are getting a much different movie in a way I find truly fascinating… even while I prefer the extended cut.\n\n7) Eve Arden or Una Merkel?\n\nLeaning to Eve Arden just because she sticks around in my brain more.\n\n8) What was the last DVD/Blu-ray/streaming film you saw? The last theatrical screening?\n\nLast blu-ray was a rewatch of 2009’s Sweetgrass, last streaming watch was a Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode of Teenagers from Outer Space, DVD and theater remain unchanged: Chaplin shorts from the former, Nope from the latter.\n\n9) Second favorite Michael Mann film\n\nThe Insider\n\n10) Name a favorite director’s most egregious misstep\n\nJohn Ford deciding he was too thirsty for Katharine Hepburn to leave the set of Mary of Scotland.\n\n11) Alain Delon or Marcello Mastroianni?\n\nI would have picked Alain Delon before he turned out to be a raging fascist over the last decade. Wasn’t that dude supposed to submit himself to euthanasia? A cool fucking screen presence who is involved in many of my favorite films, but Marcello Mastroianni exemplified the sort of cool I wanted to be even at his sloppiest.\n\n12) Jean-Luc Godard famously stated that “all you need for a movie is a girl and a gun.” Name one other essential element that you’d add to the mix.\n\nA cut.\n\n13) Favorite one-sheet that you own, or just your favorite one-sheet (please provide a link to an image if you can)\n\nI own a poster of Elle autographed by Paul Verhoeven and Isabelle Huppert (gracias to Nathaniel at The Film Experience for that, please support that site!) and yet still the position of privilege is given to the one-sheet of my favorite movie of the 2010s. Maybe the poster will be dethroned when that Who Killed Captain Alex? poster arrives in the mail, though.\n\n14) Catherine Spaak or Daniela Giordano?\n\nI’ve only seen one movie with either actor, but Spaak had more to do in The Cat o’ Nine Tails so I guess she wins by fiat.\n\n15) Director who most readily makes you think “Whatever happened to…?”\n\nJoel Anderson of Lake Mungo fame. It’s pretty obvious the dude has been so burnt out by filmmaking that he didn’t even contribute to the Second Sight release but I do genuinely wonder what was the breaking point for that dude. Such a huge talent and he just disappeared for good.\n\n16) Now that some time has passed… The Interview, yes or no?\n\nYes to its existence, no to the movie being worth a damn.\n\n17) Second favorite Alberto Calvalcanti film\n\nI haven’t seen a single movie of his.\n\n18) Though both displayed strong documentary influence in their early films, Wim Wenders and Werner Herzog have focused heavily on the documentary form late in their filmmaking careers. If he had lived, what kind of films do you think Rainer Werner Fassbinder, their partner in the German New Wave of the ‘70s, would be making now?\n\nI can actually see Fassbinder moving into adaptations of theatre classics, based in his background with Munich Action-Theater. I definitely don’t see that guy making documentaries like his contemporaries.\n\n19) Name a DVD you’ve replaced with a Blu-ray. Name another that you decided not to replace. *\n\nI have replaced so many DVDs with Blu-Rays in the year of our lord 2022. I guess the latest is that I finally after all these years upgraded my Brazil Criterion DVD set to the Blu-Ray, but I’m still keeping the DVD set just cause I like how chonky it looks. One I did not replace and probably never will is 28 Days Later… or also The Blair Witch Project. They’d have to come with a lot of special features for me to upgrade them, otherwise there’s no ability to upgrade that sort of DV visual material.\n\n20) Don Rickles or Rodney Dangerfield?\n\nDangerfield, he just seems like he would have been so much fun to hang out with.\n\n21) Director who you wish would hurry up and make another film\n\nPanos Cosmatos, come on! Every movie he makes is a movie I wish I made.\n\n22) Second favorite Michael Bay film\n\n13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi\n\n23) Name a movie that, for whatever reason, you think of as your own\n\nJammin’ the Blues, which feels so directly like the thing that clicked most to me about intersecting visuals and sounds into a ball of excitement that one can’t but be infected by witnessing. Certainly I’ve found myself more stimulated since by short film material like Begone Dull Care, The Heart of the World, and The Wizard of Speed and Time but you never forget your first and I mean… I was a lover of jazz drumming before I was a lover of on-camera effects and animation, frankly.\n\n24) Your favorite movie AI (however loosely you care to define the term)\n\nRoy Batty, unless having a body is a cheat in which case I’ll go with the most basic answer that is HAL-9000.\n\n25) Your favorite existing DVD commentary track *\n\nI find more and more I thrive on the conflict that is at the center of the Limey commentary. Soderbergh and Dobbs truly went at each other there.\n\n26) The double bill you’d program on the last night of your own revival theater\n\nDragon Inn and Goodbye, Dragon Inn\n\n27) Catherine Deneuve or Claudia Cardinale?\n\nI know I just talked shit about Alain Delon being a fascist and it’s not like Catherine Deneuve isn’t herself majorly racist towards Arabic people like me but… y’all can not underestimate how often I think down there instead of up here. Like I mentioned about Vivien Leigh in an earlier quiz, the Larry David quote remains true to me “Here you have some one who, not only doesn’t want you, doesn’t even acknowledge your right to exist, wants your destruction… that’s a turn-on.” Sorry, Claudia, you’re gorgeous and an excellent actor too.\n\n(* Questions provided by long-time SLIFR reader and quiz participant Robert Fiore. Thanks, Bob!)\n\nRolling right along on this summer run through my personal TeenBeat magazine quizzes, the stuff of Dennis Collazo’s blog Sergio Leone and the Infield Fly Rule. This quiz is dated from June of 2011 and named after the lead character in Nicholas Ray’s rather excellent Bigger Than Life, embodied by a performance from James Mason using his effete personality as a disorienting vehicle to his character’s growing toxic masculinity, amplified by Ray and his crew’s utilization of the widescreen format to make him bigger and smaller as needed. If you have not seen Bigger Than Life, I much recommend it but this ain’t a review of that movie because that’d make me tired. Gonna go with the quiz stuff instead. Let’s rock!\n\n1) Depending on your mood, your favorite or least-loved movie cliché.\n\nLeast loved is easy: daddy issues in writing. Go to fucking therapy, maybe it’ll make you a better writer.\n\nFavorite is a little tougher but… when they be using flowing window curtains to imply a couple have banged.\n\n2) Regardless of whether or not you eventually caught up with it, which film classic have you lied about seeing in the past?\n\nI’ve since seen them both, but I’m sure I’ve previously said in elementary school I saw either Grease or The Goonies to be cool or whatever.\n\n3) Roland Young or Edward Everett Horton?\n\nExtremely tough call. I think I might pick Horton just ’cause I feel more familiar with him in succession of those Astaire/Rogers musicals he did.\n\n4) Second favorite Frank Tashlin movie\n\nThe Girl Can’t Help It, assuming we are disqualifying Tashlin’s Looney Tunes work.\n\n5) Clockwork Orange— yes or no?\n\nYes and unlike previous encounters of this type of question for Salo and Human Centipede where I can get some personality throwing them down as filth (though I think that’s an immense discredit), I’m actually confused as to why this is a question.\n\n6) Best/favorite use of gender dysphoria in a horror film (Ariel Schudson)\n\nThis is absolutely the sort of thing y’all want to hear a cis man talk about, given that cis people are the world’s biggest experts on this matter. But in the spirit of this, I’ll probably go with the final shots of Sleepaway Camp, which have seldom left my brain in the 7 years since I first watched that movie.\n\n7) Melanie Laurent or Blake Lively?\n\nBlake Lively, I think she’s proven one of the more interesting actors of the 21st Century and I’ve yet to see a performance out of her that I don’t enjoy. Laurent is great in Inglourious Basterds, but I honestly can’t think of anything else where she’s made an impression to me (and I think her directing in Mustang is good, but I’m not writing home about it).\n\n8) Best movie of 2011 (so far…)\n\nlol at “so far…”. Since this quiz was posted on 1 June 2011, it was probably The Tree of Life and it remains The Tree of Life over 11 years later.\n\n9) Favorite screen performer with a noticeable facial deformity (Peg Aloi)\n\nMichael Berryman is my default pick, although Robert Z’Dar is somehow challenging that in my brain now. I’ll stick to Berryman, that man is such a good sport and knows precisely how to play into horror exploitation cinema in a manner that’s effectively creepy.\n\n10) Lars von Trier: shithead or misunderstood comic savant? (Dean Treadway)\n\nShithead. Inspired shithead, but shithead nonetheless and I have no time to play his games anymore.\n\n11) Timothy Carey or Henry Silva?\n\nHenry Silva. I’m not fond enough of either actor to determine a superior, but Silva’s in Megaforce so that’s all I need.\n\n12) Low-profile writer who deserves more attention from critics and /or audiences\n\nAssuming we’re talking screenwriter, Dan O’Bannon.\n\n13) Movie most recently viewed theatrically, and on DVD, Blu-ray or streaming\n\nJust watched Nope this afternoon at Woodridge’s Cinemark IMAX 15/70. DVD and Blu-Ray are the same answers as this question got a few days ago, some Chaplin shorts and L’Avventura. Streaming, I caught Stuart Gordon’s last movie Stuck on Tubi.\n\n14) Favorite film noir villain.\n\nPhyllis Dietrichson in Double Indemnity\n\n15) Best thing about streaming movies?\n\nLol, you are asking the wrong motherfucker here, streaming is the bane of cinema in my eyes. I guess a nice thing is that I can have my Roku set-up in my bedroom and catch a quick Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode before I sleep.\n\n16) Fay Spain or France Nuyen? (Peter Nellhaus)\n\nI barely know who they are. I guess I’ll give it to Spain.\n\n17) Favorite Kirk Douglas movie that isn’t called Spartacus (Peter Nellhaus)\n\nAce in the Hole. Spartacus is not my favorite Kirk Douglas movie, it’s not even my favorite Kirk Douglas movie directed by Stanley Kubrick.\n\n18) Favorite movie about cars.\n\nDoes Mad Max 2 count? Obviously Fury Road is post-2011. If neither count, maybe Le Mans.\n\n19) Audrey Totter or Marie Windsor?\n\nWindsor.\n\n20) Existing Stephen King movie adaptation that could use an remake/reboot/overhaul.\n\nOoff, y’know if I did this quiz back when it was posted, my answer would have been Pet Sematary with better actors but then the remake happened in 2019 and that turned out to be a mistake. In 2022, The Dark Tower seems the most obvious pick, but that’s cheating in my view. I suspect Cycle of the Werewolf might qualify but I have not seen Silver Bullet, so for all I know that’s a good movie (plus I haven’t read Cycle). I guess I’ll go with Dreamcatcher for right now, I think that’s a salvageable premise.\n\n21) Low-profile director who deserves more attention from critics and/or audiences.\n\nJulie Dash.\n\n22) What actor that you previously enjoyed has become distracting or a self-parody? (Adam Ross)\n\nTaika Waititi is the easy pick, Chris Pratt is another easy pick, and Sacha Baron Cohen is also such a pick. But that’s all 2022 picks, so I guess going by 2011… Zach Galifinakis maybe? We all thought he was hot shit after the first Hangover but by the time the second one rolled by, he felt like a one-trick pony.\n\n23) Best place in the world to see a movie.\n\nFrom personal experience, definitely the Music Box but I’ve always wanted to watch a movie at the Cine Thisio in Greece.\n\n24) Charles McGraw or Sterling Hayden?\n\nSterling Hayden, I barely know McGraw exists next to Hayden.\n\n25) Second favorite Yasujiro Ozu film\n\nLate Spring\n\n26) Most memorable horror movie father figure.\n\nBecause this is asking for “most memorable” is why I’m picking Jack Torrance in The Shining and not like… an actually good dad.\n\n27) Name a non-action-oriented movie that would be fun to see in Sensurround.\n\nThe Annihilation of Fish, which I suspect is where James Earl Jones speaks the most.\n\n28) Chris Evans or Ryan Reynolds?\n\nWow, between asking me to say a nice thing about streaming and this question, it’s extremely clear that this quiz comes from 2011 and not from 2022 where Evans, Reynolds, and streaming have all become forces of evil in my eye. That said, I’ll pick Evans since he has the most performances I like and my annoyance with him is more his off-screen bullshit while Reynolds has been stuck on Deadpool-mode for the rest of his life.\n\nIsn’t it crazy I’m talking shit about Reynolds here after praising his wife several answers ago?\n\n29) Favorite relatively unknown supporting player, from either or both the classic and the modern era.\n\nI guess Edie McClurg for the modern era, Thelma Ritter for the classic era.\n\n30) Real-life movie location you most recently visited or saw.\n\nI just talked about the Third Man and Before Sunrise locations from my trip to Vienna in May, so I guess I’ll pick from one of the four slasher film haunts I’ve checked out through 2019. My favorite was probably the Texas Chainsaw Massacre spots ’round Austin, but the nicest picture is definitely this one from Pasadena looking at spots from Halloween.\n\n31) Second favorite Budd Boetticher movie\n\nI have seen a grand total of two, so The Killer Is Loose.\n\n32) Mara Corday or Julie Adams?\n\nJulie Adams in that one-piece in Creature from the Black Lagoon ensures her win forever and ever.\n\n33) Favorite Universal-International western.\n\nEither The Beguiled or High Plains Drifter, either way Clint Eastwood is there.\n\n34) What’s the biggest “gimmick” that’s drawn you out to see a movie? (Sal Gomez)\n\nWatch Crispin Glover be weird in person prior to a screening of It Is Fine! Everything Is Fine.\n\n35) Favorite actress of the silent era.\n\nMaybe I’m just still hung-up on Show People a year after seeing it for the first time, but Marion Davies is right there.\n\n36) Best Eugene Pallette performance (Larry Aydlette)\n\nThe Pops in My Man Godfrey, a straight man to his family who is absurd enough to be a believable patriarch towards them. I will however say that my deep affinity for Pallette’s Friar Tuck was close to derailing that answer.\n\n37) Best/worst remake of the 21st century so far? (Dan Aloi)\n\nCan’t use Point Break since that’s 2015. I’ll select the 2005 remake of The Fog.\n\n38) What could multiplex owners do right now to improve the theatrical viewing experience for moviegoers? What could moviegoers do?\n\nMultiplex Owners? Continue making their movie theater experiences more accessible for people with disabilities, we at the bare minimum up in here for them. Plus one could also shoot for proper maintenance in bulb replacement, screen cleaning, and screen masking.\n\nMoviegoers? Shut the fuck up when the movie up and if you must use a cell phone, go outside the auditorium."
