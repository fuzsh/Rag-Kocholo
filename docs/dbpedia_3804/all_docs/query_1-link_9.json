        "text": "1985 American comedy film by Carl Reiner\n\nSummer RentalDirected byCarl ReinerWritten byMark Reisman\n\nJeremy StevensProduced byGeorge ShapiroStarringCinematographyRic WaiteEdited byBud MolinMusic byAlan SilvestriDistributed byParamount Pictures\n\nRelease date\n\nRunning time\n\n87 minutesCountryUnited StatesLanguageEnglishBox office$24,689,703 (US)[1]\n\nSummer Rental is a 1985 American comedy film directed by Carl Reiner, written by Mark Reisman and Jeremy Stevens, and starring John Candy and Richard Crenna with supporting roles by Rip Torn, Karen Austin, Kerri Green, John Larroquette, Joey Lawrence, Aubrey Jene, Dick Anthony Williams, Richard Herd, Carmine Caridi, Lois Hamilton, Frank McCarthy, Santos Morales, Pierrino Mascarino, Harry Yorku, and Bob Wells. It tells the story of an overworked air traffic controller who is put on a five weeks' paid leave and takes his family to the fictional resort town of Citrus Cove, Florida as he experiences hilarious mishaps and contends with an arrogant sailing champion. An original music score was composed for the film by Alan Silvestri. The film was released on August 9, 1985, by Paramount Pictures.[2][3]\n\nThe film was met with negative reviews.[4]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nOverworked air traffic controller Jack Chester is given five weeks' paid leave as an alternative to being fired after nearly causing a mid-air collision on the job and having an outburst over a fly covering a radar blip. He uses this time off to take his wife Sandy and their children; 14-year-old Jennifer, 8-year-old Bobby, and 3-year-old Laurie, on a summer vacation from Atlanta to the fictional Gulf Coast resort town of Citrus Cove, Florida, where they are beset by a barrage of problems.\n\nThey are first bumped out of the line of an upscale seafood restaurant in favor of arrogant local sailing champion Al Pellet who becomes Jack's main nemesis. This leads to them dining at a pirate ship-themed restaurant called The Barnacle run by Scully. The family then misreads the address, moves into the wrong house, and are forced to leave in the middle of the night ending up in a decrepit shack on a public beach with a constant stream of beach-goers passing through and its landlord being in the ICU.\n\nWhen Jack attempts to take Bobby sailing, he suffers a leg injury from a collision with Al that prevents him from spending time with his family. As Jack hasn't sailed for many years, he befriends Scully who volunteers to help.\n\nAfter the rental's original landlord dies, Al assumes the role, and Jack gives him a check for $1,000 to cover the rent for the next two weeks. Al spitefully tears up the check and orders him to leave the house when their first two weeks expire, threatening to personally throw them out should they fail. To avoid early eviction, Jack challenges Al to a race at the upcoming Citrus Cove Regatta: if Al wins, Jack will pay him the $1,000 rent and take his family home; if Jack wins, he keeps the money and earns the right to stay in the house for two additional weeks rent-free. Al scoffs at the notion that Jack could defeat him in a race, but accepts the challenge.\n\nThe bored Chesters come to life by helping Jack, Scully, and the Sanders refurbish The Barnacle and make it seaworthy while Scully's subordinate Angus finds the right size sails. On the day of the race, The Barnacle is at first no match for Al or anybody else in the race, but tossing useless garbage overboard, a strong breeze, and Jack's large pair of pants enable The Barnacle to achieve a victory against Pellet at sea.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nJohn Candy as Jack Chester, an air traffic controller who takes his family on a vacation to Citrus Cove, Florida.\n\nRichard Crenna as Al Pellet, a rich arrogant sailing champion in Citrus Cove who antagonizes Jack.\n\nRip Torn as Richard Scully, the proprietor of a restaurant boat with a pirate mentality who Jack befriends.\n\nKaren Austin as Sandy Chester, the wife of Jack.\n\nKerri Green as Jennifer Chester, the oldest daughter of Jack and Sandy.\n\nJoey Lawrence as Bobby Chester, the middle child and only son of Jack and Sandy.\n\nAubrey Jene as Laurie Chester, the youngest daughter of Jack and Sandy who has a tendency to repeat certain things said by her older siblings.\n\nJohn Larroquette as Don Moore, a man who the Chester family befriends.\n\nTom Blackwell as Gregg Moore, the son of Don who becomes Jennifer's love interest.\n\nRichard Herd as Angus MacLachlan, a Scottish man who works for Richard.\n\nSanto Morales as Cortez, a Mexican man working for Richard who Al nearly had deported once.\n\nPierrino Mascarino as the Maitre'd of the seafood restaurant.\n\nHarry Yorku as Yorku, a pirate musician who works for Richard.\n\nLois Hamilton as Vicki Sanders, the neighbor of the Chester family's rental that Jack befriends.\n\nCarmine Caridi as Ed Sanders, the husband of Vicki who is an expert carpenter.\n\nFrank McCarthy as Hal, Jack Chester's supervisor at the airport.\n\nBob Wells as Stan Greene, an attorney who is Pellet’s co-captain of the Incisor.\n\nDick Anthony Williams as Dan Gardner, a man whose house the Chester family unknowingly settle in until he returns home and helps clear up the address error.\n\nScot Samis as Russ, one of the lifeguards that lives next door to the Chester family's rental.\n\nRoger Perkovich as a fat man who enjoys watching The Smurfs.\n\nMurphy Dunne as Announcer\n\nLeigh French as Announcer\n\nReni Santoni as Announcer\n\nJack G.

Being heavy on the beach is worse. The house on the left was occupied by two elderly sisters, one of whom had a 6-foot-4 inch mentally challenged son who was out of Arsenic and Old Lace. The house on the right was out of Death in Venice, occupied by a chic group of homosexuals who had 28 inch waists and wore peach sweaters.\"[6]\n\nIt became a starring vehicle for John Candy. Director Carl Reiner said \"Like a small, beautiful painting in a large frame, John is a handsome guy in a larger frame than is necessary.\"[6] The film was developed at Paramount by the team of Barry Diller, Michael Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg. They all ended up leaving the studio before the film was made.[7][8] Brillstein expected the film to be cancelled. However, Paramount's new studio president Ned Tanen greenlit the film. \"It was quite a good script, and we had no product,\" said Tanen. \"There was a vacant spot of about six months on our release schedule. When all the geniuses are through, that's as good a reason as any to make a movie.\"[6]\n\nCandy and Reiner got along so well that they planned to make another film together at Paramount, titled The Last Holiday, but it never was made.[6] In a 1986 interview, Candy stated he was paid $800,000 for the role.[9]\n\nLocations\n\n[edit]\n\nSummer Rental was filmed in St. Pete Beach, near St. Petersburg, Florida.[5] Several local landmarks can be seen throughout the movie, including the St. Petersburg Pier during the final leg of the Regatta. Other landmarks include the old drawbridge on US19/I-275 north of the old Sunshine Skyway as well as shots of Egmont Key in the distance.\n\nThe air traffic control, radar room scene was filmed on location at the FAA Atlanta Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC ZTL) in Hampton, Georgia.[5]\n\nMusic\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2014, Alan Silvestri's score was released on a limited edition CD album in Spain by Quartet Records, twinned with his score for the 1987 film Critical Condition.[10][11] In 2023, the soundtrack was released by 1984 publishing for the first time on gatefold vinyl for Record Store Day, with a limited edition CD version the same year.[12]\n\nJimmy Buffett's \"Turning Around\" plays during the closing credits. It is also played when the Chesters are fixing their boat, the Barnacle. The soundtrack is the only legitimate release of the song.\n\nRelease\n\n[edit]\n\nSummer Rental was released in the United States on August 9, 1985, and was Candy’s first starring role in a feature film.[5]\n\nHome media\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film originally was released in the United States by Paramount on VHS on February 26, 1986.[13] It was released on DVD in April 2001 on widescreen with a theatrical trailer as the sole special feature. It was reissued on DVD three more times.[14] The United Kingdom released it on DVD in 2004 with the same extra feature. The film is scheduled for release on blu-ray with a new 4K scan by Kino Lorber in the United States.[15][16]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nBox office\n\n[edit]\n\nSummer Rental opened in 1,584 theatres on August 9, 1985, with a domestic total of $24.7 million.[1]\n\nIn the United States and Canada, it made $5,754,259 in its first weekend, ranking second at the box office. On its second weekend, it grossed $3,708,812 in 1,595 theaters, a 35% decrease over the previous week, ranking sixth. By the third weekend, it made $2.3 million and on its fourth $1.9 million over Labor Day weekend, ranking tenth.[17] On the fifth weekend, it made over $1 million for a box-office total of $21,579,838. It made another $2.8 million on its sixth and final weekend, with an increase of 171%, climbing to second place behind Back to the Future.[1]\n\nCritical response\n\n[edit]\n\nJanet Maslin of The New York Times called it \"a wan but good-natured hot-weather comedy, with a big debt to National Lampoon's Vacation plus a few nice touches of its own.\"[18] Variety described the film as \"more a collection of bits about taking the family to the shore for the summer than a coherent story\" and noted that its appeal lays in John Candy's elevation of certain segments.[19]\n\nCandy told Gene Siskel in 1986, \"We shot it too fast,...We were trying to fill a time slot for Paramount.\"[20]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
