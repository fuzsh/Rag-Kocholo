        "text": "When Alfred Hitchcock, interviewed by François Truffaut, lamented the \"photographs of people talking\" that passed for movies, he was voicing an old commonplace. Even before the coming of sound Anthony Asquith, the director with whom Hitchcock was then routinely compared (both were young, promising, stylistically similar, socially distinct) complained of films comprising \"alternate close-ups of two men talking across a table with subtitles giving their conversation sandwiched in between. That is not a real film, but a photographed play.\"\n\nFor the cognoscenti cinema meant movement, rhythm, Battleship Potemkin. In a word, montage. Asquith was there in February 1929 when Vsevolod Pudovkin, in front of an English audience after the London debut of The End of St Petersburg, described the \"Kuleshov experiment\". Its inspirational conclusion, in Asquith's paraphrase, was that \"an actor's face was just part of the raw material from which the director with camera and scissors created his visual effects\".\n\nSound threatened to put a stop to all that, and the first line of dialogue in an Asquith film, made later that year, was \"this is no time for talking\". Yet today he is probably best known for filming The Importance of Being Earnest (1952), and maligned by David Thomson as a \"dull, journeyman supervisor of the transfer to the screen of proven theatrical properties\" – most of them written by Terence Rattigan, subject of a BFI Southbank retrospective this month. How did he get there?\n\nIn the early 1930s \"Puffin\", as Asquith was known, was hired by Michael Balcon to work alongside Hitchcock at the Gaumont-British studio in Shepherd's Bush. But while \"Hitch\", having made his share of stage adaptations, came into his own with The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934) and The 39 Steps (1935), Asquith was demoted to second-unit work and remakes, and eventually inaction. He struggled to make his peace with sound – and only did so by directing a film that could never have been made silent.\n\nPygmalion (1938) was a career-saving smash, and was shot, in Asquith's phrase, \"the legato cantabile way\". Group compositions imperceptibly become close-ups; the camera is in a constant dance with star, and co-director Leslie Howard, ducking in and out of frame; the cutting, courtesy of David Lean, is whip-smart. Asquith's follow-up was the first of his 10 films with Rattigan. Of French Without Tears (1939), Graham Greene said \"it is the padding that is memorable\"; and from a certain angle one might see the plays as tryouts for the films.\n\nWriter and director became close friends, and their collaboration – which ended only with Asquith's death in 1968 – was not confined to the cinema. Asquith directed the first run of Rattigan's RAF story Flare Path in 1942; but rather than merely supervise its transfer on to celluloid, the pair of them wove its threads into The Way to the Stars (1945). They replaced the play's love-triangle plot and back-from-the-dead ending with a less conventional structure, meant to illuminate the changing character of the English middle class over the course of the second world war.\n\nThe Winslow Boy (1948) had similarly tangled roots. It is a superb fictionalisation of the Archer-Shee case, in which a banker's family and their barrister sacrifice health, finances, prospects and romantic arrangements over a trifling incident but in principled defiance of \"the monstrous assumption that the king can do no wrong\". It is set during the turbulent premiership of Asquith's father. (Though more effectively acted, David Mamet's version, on show at BFI Southbank, stints on the historical context.)\n\nRattigan, who had originally envisaged the project as a film, confined the play's action to a suburban drawing-room as part of a bet with Asquith fils, who felt the playwright would not be able to do the story justice without lavish courtroom sets. Though Rattigan won, theatre critics agreed with Asquith, and the required scenes were added, or reinstated, for the film; inevitably, Asquith was accused by film critics of unwarranted \"opening out\"."
