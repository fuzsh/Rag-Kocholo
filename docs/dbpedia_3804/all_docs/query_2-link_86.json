The intention is to provide books which are up-to-date in terms of information and critical approach, but not bound to any one theoretical methodology. Though all books in the series will have certain elements in common – comprehensive filmographies, annotated bibliographies, appropriate illustration – the actual critical tools employed will be the responsibility of the individual authors.\n\nNevertheless, an important recurring element will be a concern for how the oeuvre of each film-maker does or does not fit certain critical and industrial contexts, as well as for the wider social contexts which helped to shape not just that particular film-maker but the course of British cinema at large.\n\nAlthough the series is director-orientated, the editors believe that reference to a variety of stances and contexts is more likely to reconceptualise and reappraise the phenomenon of British cinema as a complex, shifting field of production. All the texts in the series will engage in detailed discussion of major works of the film-makers involved, but they all consider as well the importance of other key collaborators, of studio organisation, of audience reception, of recurring themes and structures: all those other aspects which go towards the construction of a national cinema.\n\nThe series explores and charts a field which is more than ripe for serious excavation. The acknowledged leaders of the field will be reappraised; just as important, though, will be the bringing to light of those who have not so far received any serious attention. They are all part of the very rich texture of British cinema, and it will be the work of this series to give them all their due.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nI should like to thank Chas Critcher and the Film, Media and Communications Research Centre at Sheffield Hallam University, and Sylvia Harvey and the Humanities Research Board Centre for British Film and Television Studies for financing the periods of study leave during which this book was written.

(Dilys Powell)¹\n\nDilys Powell’s acknowledgement of Asquith’s significance to the British cinema was written as part of a tribute to the director and published in 1968 by the British Film Institute shortly after his death. The tribute, understandably effusive in the context of a commemorative publication, has not quite been echoed by those who have written about the history of British cinema in the years since Asquith’s death in 1968. One film historian has suggested that he is ‘perhaps the most underrated director in British film history’;² yet it may be closer to the mark to suggest that Asquith has not really received the critical attention that would enable a rating of his work in terms of the British cinema as yet. Although not ignored by scholars and critics, his work has certainly not had anything like the attention enjoyed by his most distinguished contemporary, Alfred Hitchcock, and neither has it had the consideration devoted to figures such as Michael Powell and David Lean. The riposte to that, of course, may be that his achievement is not as great as Hitchcock, Powell, and others, and, indeed, with a handful of exceptions, his work has not been highly regarded in the context of modern Film Studies. At best, his films have inspired local admiration for specific titles as in Raymond Durgnat’s comment that Asquith’s ‘best films aren’t vaporized by the sternest comparison – with Ophuls’.³ At worst he has been dismissed in somewhat harsh terms as in David Thomson’s caustic entry in his biographical dictionary of cinema, where Asquith is characterised as ‘a dull journeyman supervisor of the transfer to the screen of proven theatrical properties’.⁴ In the context of critical neglect, one of the aims of this study is simply to fill a gap, to provide an account of Asquith’s films – thirty-five features and a handful of shorter films – and to draw attention to the varied body of work with which he is associated. The study also aims to position the work in relation to the various directions taken by the British film during the period of his career. Asquith was a film director in the British cinema for almost forty years, serving his apprenticeship in the last years of the silent period and making his final film, The Yellow Rolls-Royce (1964), during the ‘swinging sixties’. The remainder of this chapter is devoted to a career overview as a preparation for the subsequent more detailed attention to the various phases in his career.\n\nEarly years\n\nAsquith entered the film industry in the mid-1920s, towards the end of the troubled silent period when the production industry in Britain was in decline in the face of competition from the American film. Hollywood dominated the British screen and its films were highly popular with the British public but the domestic industry struggled to find a position in the market and seemed to many on the brink of extinction. There was considerable pressure for government action to halt the decline and this resulted in the quota legislation of the late 1920s. The 1928 Cinematograph Films Act effectively laid the foundations for a British production industry by, amongst other provisions, requiring exhibitors to screen a number of British films as part of their annual schedules. Asquith’s early films were made during a period of optimism generated by the quota arrangements; new companies were starting up, new studios were being built, and British films had an assured place on the nation’s cinema screens. It was also a period marked by ‘a lively engagement with issues of film criticism and aesthetics’.⁵ This engagement was stimulated in part by the new adventurous films from Germany, France, the Scandinavian countries, and the Soviet Union, and it formed the basis for the development of a thriving intellectual film culture in Britain manifested in the formation of film societies and specialist cinemas, and the development of serious reflection on the medium in journals such as Close Up.\n\nAsquith was one of what Rachael Low refers to as ‘the new generation of well-connected, well-educated young men, who, unlike their parents, were prepared to take films seriously’.⁶ He was eminently well-connected as the son of the former Liberal Prime Minister, Herbert Asquith, and his mother, Margot, was a ‘writer and brilliant society figure’,⁷ a prominent member of the metropolitan social and cultural circles. Asquith had a traditional upper-middle-class education at Winchester public school and Oxford University, which was where he began to take an interest in the cinema. After graduating he spent a short time in Hollywood ‘as a guest of Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford, and watched some of the great directors of the American silent cinema at work’.⁸ His American experience left its mark; in particular, he met and befriended Charles Chaplin who provided him with a potent and influential sounding board for his developing views on the art of cinema. Writing about his experiences some years later he was to recollect: ‘I realise now, far more than I did at the time, what a tremendous experience it was for me – a green, filmstruck undergraduate – to be able to talk for hours on end with the greatest artist the cinema has produced.’⁹\n\nIn 1926 he joined Harry Bruce Woolfe’s British Instructional Films, then part of the Stoll organisation, the largest British producer of the early 1920s. This began his practical apprenticeship, providing him with a varied experience of film production. For example, on Sinclair Hill’s Boadicea (1926), in addition to contributing to the scenario, he also acted as ‘Property Master, Assistant make-up Man, Assistant Cutter and Stunt Man’.¹⁰ He was also involved in a film called Thou Fool (1928), mainly as an editor. However, in Asquith’s own words, ‘I even directed a shot for it, taken from Chelsea Bridge. It was of Lotts Road Power Station, shot on a misty November afternoon.’¹¹ In a sense this was a minor rehearsal of sorts for a subsequent film – Underground (1928) – which featured more extensive location shooting at the power station as the backdrop for its dramatic denouement.\n\nAsquith had joined British Instructional at a time when the company was rethinking its production strategies and responding, no doubt, to the new opportunities for British films anticipated as a consequence of the forthcoming quota legislation. The company was best known for its documentary reconstructions of the First World War battles with films such as The Battle of Jutland (1921) and Zeebrugge (1924), and had also developed the celebrated Secrets of Nature natural history series. However, the firm was reorganised and relaunched as a public company in 1927 and fiction films were to be central to its future plans. In fact, the first film announced in this change of direction was an adaptation of Tell England, a best-selling novel set in the First World War, written by Ernest Raymond and published in 1921.¹² In the event, the Tell England project was delayed, and the first venture into fiction film by the company was to be Shooting Stars (1928). The film, based upon an original Asquith scenario, is usually regarded as his first picture as director, though it is credited to A. V. Bramble, an experienced director brought in by British Instructional to work with the novice film-maker. Asquith was then promoted to sole directing credit on his next films – Underground (1928) and The Runaway Princess (1928). Both had romantic themes though in somewhat contrasting social settings. Underground is a story of romance set in a working-class milieu whereas in The Runaway Princess, an Anglo-German co-production shot mainly in Berlin, the romance is set in a royal milieu. Both films, however, used London-based location sequences and those in The Runaway Princess prompted one reviewer to suggest that ‘the London settings are used to much more advantage than most British directors have yet put them’.¹³ Asquith’s final silent film was A Cottage on Dartmoor (1930) though, as with many films in production in 1929, a sound-on-disc musical component was provided together with some dialogue sequences. Indeed, its importance as a film on the boundary between the silent and sound eras has been compared to Hitchcock’s much-venerated Blackmail (1929).¹⁴ Though an Anglo-Swedish co-production, the film was made at British Instructional’s newly completed Welwyn studios.\n\nTell England (1931), the much-delayed project about the Gallipoli campaign during the First World War, was to be Asquith’s first sound film proper, though, as with Shooting Stars, he was to work in collaboration with another experienced figure. His co-director, Geoffrey Barkas, was brought in for his specialist expertise in location shooting as a good deal of the film was to be shot abroad with Malta standing in for the Dardanelles. Inevitably, its status as a sound film was somewhat compromised by its long gestation from the initial silent project. British Instructional had acquired the screen rights to the novel in 1925 and, according to Asquith:\n\nIt was bought as a picture subject for Walter Summers who made the ‘Battles of Coronel and Falkland Islands.’ When he was due to commence turning the Raymond story into a picture the powers that be felt that war films were no longer doing well at the box office. So the project was shelved for the time being.¹⁵\n\nIn fact, the film had been advertised in the trade press late in 1927 with a release date of September 1928, and the project ‘launched’ at a dinner at the Savoy addressed by the novelist John Buchan, a member of the British Instructional board.¹⁶ The film betrayed its silent roots; the location work in particular was filmed silent with sound added later, and it also retained the use of intertitles from the silent period. Yet the film which finally emerged prompted comparisons with distinguished war pictures such as Pudovkin’s The End of St. Petersburg (1926) and Milestone’s All Quiet on the Western Front (1930). Paul Rotha selected the landing and battle sequences shot by Barkas and edited by Asquith for special praise though he was critical of the fictional story element of the film;¹⁷ the Evening News critic judged the film to be ‘one of the two or three outstanding British talkies made so far’;¹⁸ and, in a much later assessment, Peter Cowie suggests that ‘the massacre on the Gallipoli beaches has taken its place as one of the most compelling and cinematic war sequences ever made’.¹⁹ In one sense Tell England marked the end of Asquith’s apprenticeship; he had established a reputation as an inventive silent film-maker with two films from his own screenplays and he had also adapted the work of others; he had worked abroad on a co-production and he had made the transition to the sound film. The subject matter of his first five films was diverse – the world of filmmaking, working-class life, middle-European royalty, the First World War – and the tone of the films varied from the gravity of Tell England to the frivolous world of The Runaway Princess, and from the reflexiveness of Shooting Stars to the realism of Underground. Though the films were made in the context of the commercial film industry, Asquith’s keen interest in the art and aesthetics of the film, and his involvement with the Film Society, meant that he brought to his work a knowledge of the various directions taken by the international cinema in the 1920s, from the classical narrative of the American film to the experimental cinemas from Germany, France, and the Soviet Union. In addition, he had achieved a degree of public recognition; as Charles Drazin has suggested, his critical standing was such that, ‘by the last days of the silent cinema he would be mentioned with Hitchcock as one of Britain’s two leading film directors’.²⁰\n\nAsquith was to make one more film for British Instructional, an adaptation of the Compton Mackenzie novel Carnival (1912), the story of a ballet dancer set in Edwardian times and featuring dance sequences performed by the Marie Rambert company. The film – Dance Pretty Lady (1931) – did not perform well at the box office though it impressed both John Grierson and Robert Flaherty.²¹ There were press reports of a further project entitled The Window Cleaner based on an original story by Asquith,²² but he was to leave British Instructional early in 1932. Dance Pretty Lady was his last film for the company which was shortly to be absorbed by the rather more commercially orientated British International Pictures. British Instructional had proved to be a congenial context for the start of a career in film-making; the next phase of Asquith’s career was to prove somewhat more problematic.\n\nThe 1930s: the barren years\n\nOn the face of it, the prospects for Asquith should have been good as he left a small, though enterprising, company for a much larger one. He joined Gainsborough Pictures, which had merged with the Gaumont-British company in the late 1920s to become one of the most powerful of the British vertically integrated combines. In addition to this, Asquith was joining the company during an expansionary production phase, and was to be working under the supervision of Michael Balcon, ‘the only producer in Britain of Hollywood calibre apart from Korda’.²³ Gaumont-British was an ambitious studio which during the decade was to recruit an impressive array of stars, directors and technicians drawn from both indigenous talent (Jessie Matthews, Alfred Hitchcock, Victor Saville) and from the increasing flow of émigrés from Europe (Conrad Veidt, Alfred Junge), supplemented from time to time with American directors such as Tim Whelan and Raoul Walsh. However, things did not quite work out for the director and Asquith effectively got lost in such a context, as a letter written by studio boss Balcon some years later indicates:\n\nWhen Asquith joined us at Gaumont-British we already employed several well-known directors, among them Walter Forde, Alfred Hitchcock, Anatole Litvak, Victor Saville, William Thiele, Berthold Viertel, etc., and I suppose they had the first choice of subjects … it must be remembered that our policy was somewhat different then. I was called upon to make a large number of specialised comedies with well-known comedians, and these films would hardly have been in Asquith’s line. Also there was a period when we were carried away by the possibility of the Anglo-American type of subject, with American stars, and I do not think that these were suitable for Asquith, either.²⁴\n\nAsquith spent around two years at Gaumont-British and directed just one film – The Lucky Number (1933) – a ‘Cockney romance’ in the words of Kine Weekly,²⁵ and, like Underground and A Cottage on Dartmoor, another foray into the ‘lower depths’ for the aristocratic director. Critics such as John Grierson had previously noted some affinities between his work and that of the French director, René Clair, and The Lucky Number, which revolved around a lost lottery ticket, prompted direct comparisons with the French film-maker’s similarly themed Le Million (1931).²⁶\n\nAsquith’s other work during this period was confined to working for or with other directors: he wrote the screenplay for a musical comedy, Marry Me (1932), a remake of a German film directed by William Thiele; he acted as co-director on the English version of a bilingual film, The Unfinished Symphony (1934), based on the life of Schubert and shot partly in Vienna; and he was also responsible for supervising the second unit work on Forever England (1934), which was directed by one of Gaumont-British’s top film-makers, Walter Forde. It was a mixed and largely unsatisfying experience. He was reluctant to engage fully with Marry Me and wrote to Balcon expressing his willingness to help on the script and the preparation for the film but also saying that he would prefer not to go ‘onto the floor’.²⁷ As a lover of classical music, he was more interested in The Unfinished Symphony, due, no doubt, to its subject matter – the life of Schubert – Asquith’s favourite composer.²⁸ His second unit work on Forever England was subsequently praised by the Observer’s film critic though it was a somewhat back-handed compliment included as part of a critical dismissal of his film Moscow Nights:\n\nMuch against my will, I promised Mr Asquith at the time that I would not mention his share in ‘Forever England.’ He was anxious you see, not to destroy one jot of Walter Forde’s credit for the film. Now, in view of ‘Moscow Nights,’ I have no compunction in breaking my promise. There are pretty things in ‘Moscow Nights,’ but it is obviously unfair to judge Mr Asquith’s work by this derivative French melodrama, when some of his best original work in ‘Forever England’ is going the rounds of the country this week.²⁹\n\nMoscow Nights (1936), the ostensible subject of the review, was made for Alexander Korda’s ambitious internationally-orientated London Films to which Asquith had moved following his disappointing stint at Gaumont-British. Initially, he had been assigned to another Korda. project – a feature-length film to mark the Silver Jubilee of King George V in 1936 from a script to be written by Winston Churchill. Indeed, it has been suggested that Asquith’s appeal to Korda, though partly professional – he was a relatively experienced film director – was also to do with his superior social status and connections which made him ideal for enterprises such as the Jubilee project.³⁰ Korda had planned to make a series of short educational films with Churchill but, after an unfavourable exhibitor response to the idea, he suggested the Jubilee film as an alternative.³¹ Churchill was to provide the scenario – dramatic reconstructions of the key events of the King’s reign – and Asquith was to direct. However, the project was abandoned and Asquith was assigned to direct Moscow Nights, a remake of a French film released in 1934. Press reception of the film was mixed with Sunday Times critic Sidney Carroll suggesting that Asquith’s direction of the picture ‘denotes a master director of films’.³² In stark contrast to this, Graham Greene, writing in The Spectator, dismissed the film as ‘completely bogus’ and commented that Asquith’s ‘direction is puerile’.³³ Asquith’s time with Korda was brief and in addition to the abandoned Jubilee film there was also a project based upon the life of Queen Elizabeth I which failed to materialise.³⁴ Asquith had not managed to make a significant mark in a large combine, Gaumont-British, and he now failed to make a mark in the smaller but still high-profile and prestigious London Films run by the flamboyant Hungarian-born Korda. Although his standing had been high at the beginning of the sound period, this was not reflected in the way his career developed, or failed to develop, as the British film industry moved into a prolific production phase towards the middle of the 1930s. As a Picturegoer feature was to put it, ‘British film production was enjoying a boom, but producers forgot to employ Asquith … No British producer … had yet troubled to avail himself of Asquith’s full talent.’³⁵"
