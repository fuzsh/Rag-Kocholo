        "text": "The Homeowners Collection is awesome. When we arrived, there was an adorable beach tote and welcome kit waiting for us, and during our stay, they even hosted a cocktail reception with hors d'oeuvres and live music. You usually don’t get this sort of care and attention from a property management company. Our cottage was also clean and updated with everything we needed.\n\nDune House is a true hidden gem. We loved everything about our stay! The ocean view from the den and back deck are unbeatable. We had coffee every morning under the pergola and it was so peaceful listening to the morning waves. The house and grounds are as gorgeous as the photos and we felt right at home immediately. It was clean and well appointed and so close to everything you need in terms of eating|drinking|socializing. We will definitely be back.\n\nYou can never go wrong renting a property through the Homeowner’s Collection! They go above and beyond to make sure your experience is fantastic. We have rented Blue Suede Shoes several times and it never disappoints. From the huge comfy couches and beds to the gorgeous kitchen, It stays beautifully updated with every amenity you could ever want while on vacation. You can’t beat the location either. With a 3 minute walk to the beach or shopping, it’s so easy to get around. We love it there!\n\nFrom the moment we stepped into our cottage, we felt at home. The cottage itself was beautiful and yet comfortable. The location was perfect. We were both close to the central square and also steps from the beach. Walking around and enjoying the sights of the tree-lined streets with their white picket fences was a favorite pastime. Property management was super friendly, helpful, and professional. I have never dealt with such a fine group of people and had such a \"personal experience\"."
