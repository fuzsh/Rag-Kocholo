        "text": "English film director (1902–1968)\n\nAnthony Asquith ( ; 9 November 1902 – 20 February 1968) was an English film director. He collaborated successfully with playwright Terence Rattigan on The Winslow Boy (1948) and The Browning Version (1951), among other adaptations. His other notable films include Pygmalion (1938), French Without Tears (1940), The Way to the Stars (1945) and a 1952 adaptation of Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest.\n\nLife and career\n\n[edit]\n\nBorn in London, he was the son of H. H. Asquith, the Prime Minister from 1908 to 1916, and Margot Asquith, who was responsible for 'Puffin' as his family nickname.[1] He was educated at Eaton House,[2] Winchester College and Balliol College, Oxford.\n\nThe film industry was viewed as disreputable when Asquith was young, and according to the actor Jonathan Cecil, a family friend, Asquith entered this profession in order to escape his background.[3] At the end of the 1920s, he began his career with the direction of four silent films, the last of which, A Cottage on Dartmoor, established his reputation with its meticulous and often emotionally moving frame composition.[1] Pygmalion (1938) was based on the George Bernard Shaw play featuring Leslie Howard and Wendy Hiller.\n\nAsquith was a longtime friend and colleague of Terence Rattigan (they collaborated on ten films) and producer Anatole de Grunwald. His later films included Rattigan's The Winslow Boy (1948) and The Browning Version (1951), and Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest (1952).\n\nAsquith was an alcoholic and, according to actor Jonathan Cecil, a repressed homosexual. He died in 1968.[3] He was buried at All Saints Churchyard, Sutton Courtenay, Berkshire, England.[4]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFeature film\n\n[edit]\n\nShooting Stars (1927)\n\nUnderground (1928)\n\nThe Runaway Princess (1929)\n\nA Cottage on Dartmoor (1929)\n\nTell England (1931)\n\nDance Pretty Lady (1932)\n\nThe Lucky Number (1933)\n\nLetting in the Sunshine (1933)\n\nUnfinished Symphony (1934)\n\nMoscow Nights (1935)\n\nPygmalion (1938)\n\nFrench Without Tears (1940)\n\nFreedom Radio (1941)\n\nQuiet Wedding (1941)\n\nCottage to Let (1941)\n\nUncensored (1942)\n\nWe Dive at Dawn (1943)\n\nThe Demi-Paradise (1943)\n\nFanny by Gaslight (1944)\n\nThe Way to the Stars (1945)\n\nWhile the Sun Shines (1947)\n\nThe Winslow Boy (1948)\n\nThe Woman in Question (1950)\n\nThe Browning Version (1951)\n\nThe Importance of Being Earnest (1952)\n\nThe Final Test (1953)\n\nThe Net (1953)\n\nThe Young Lovers (1954)\n\nCarrington V.C.
