Nick Jonas is more than just a great voice or a teenage boy band prodigy. He's proven that he's got some fierce acting chops, and in the wake of his role on Scream Queens, he's taking on a whole new endeavor — but he's still returning to the frat house.

His new film is called Goat, and is one of the highly anticipated films taking this year's Sundance festival by storm. The film takes a cold, hard look at the brotherhood and brutality of U.S. college fraternities — groups that have made many headlines over the past few years. Nick weighed in on what it was like to play a college kid who begins to question the ethics of the group when his brother (played by Ben Schnetzer) pledges.

The story is a true one: the main character's name comes from memoirist Brad Land. His book is about his desire to fit in with the crowd, and his decision to join a fraternity in an effort to become a "man."

“The film, at its core, is really about a lot of things, but especially this idea of brotherhood and masculinity,” Nick told Entertainment Weekly in an interview. “It’s the desire to feel accepted by these young men — and the lengths they’re willing to go to.”

He then added how much he relates to the story: “It’s an interesting dynamic, for sure, and it’s something I obviously relate to in a big way...I have my real blood brothers, but we also had the same band and management team for years, and that bond, that brotherhood, is within that as well. There’s a camaraderie there, and it’s been a big theme in my life.”

But it delves into much darker themes as it progresses: “I found myself on the ride home from set every day needing a bit of a decompress,” Nick added. “Luckily, the set was about 40 minutes from the hotel, so there was about 40 minutes to just take a deep breath and break from the intensity of the day.”
