(NEW YORK) — Nick Jonas is a nominee at Monday night’s MTV Movie & TV Awards, and he’s also performing on the show.

Jonas spoke to ABC News and says his nomination for his role in the hit movie Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is like “a cherry on top” of the whole experience of the exciting evening.

“I feel honored,” he said. “I’m nominated alongside my cast mates for [Best] On-Screen Team, and it’s great … it’s fun to be recognized for your work.”

While he says he doesn’t act and sing for the award shows, “when it happens, it’s kind of a cherry on top.”

“You do it for the art, or the fun of making a project like this,” he added.

“Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,” a sequel to the original 1995 film, starred Jonas, Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black and Karen Gillan. It was a massive hit, grossing over $962 million worldwide, and the young actor has some theories about why it did so well.

“It connected with all age groups,” he told ABC News. “They had a really good sense of the comedy for the adults but also moments for the kids. There was elements about it that were tipping the hat to the original … then a really fresh new concept: The body swap worked out great.”
