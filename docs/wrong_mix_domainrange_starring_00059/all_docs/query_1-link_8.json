        "text": "Nick Jonas first burst onto the entertainment scene as a teen heartthrob in the 2000s with his two brothers, Joe and Kevin. Since then, he's made waves both as a solo Artist and Coach on The Voice. Below, read everything you need to know about Nick Jonas’ career, from the Jonas Brothers to today.\n\nNick Jonas breaks through with the Jonas Brothers\n\nHow to Watch\n\nWatch the Season 26 premiere of The Voice on Monday, September 23 at 8/7c on NBC and next day on Peacock.\n\nRaised in New Jersey, Jonas originally rose to fame alongside his older brothers, Joe and Kevin, in the pop-rock band the Jonas Brothers. They released their debut album, titled It’s About Time, in 2005, and toured with Artists such as Kelly Clarkson, Jesse McCartney, the Backstreet Boys, Aly & AJ, and the Cheetah Girls. They gained recognition on Disney Channel when they covered the song “Year 3000,” originally by the band Busted.\n\nThey released their second album, titled Jonas Brothers, in 2007, which rose to the number-five position on the Billboard 200 and contained the song “S.O.S.”\n\nA year later, their third studio album, A Little Bit Longer, was released, which included their single “Burnin’ Up,” their biggest hit at the time. This was around the time they all starred in the original Disney Channel movie Camp Rock. While Joe had the lead male role, Nick starred as one of the members of the fictional band Connect 3.\n\nThe Jonas Brothers were also nominated for a Grammy for Best New Artist in 2009.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5KNEZJ6KkLI\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nTheir next endeavor was starring in the Disney Channel original series, Jonas, which ran from 2008-2010. The show saw a fictionalized version of the three brothers trying to live their lives while navigating fame.\n\nAround this time, they released their fourth studio album, Lines, Vines and Trying Times, before taking a hiatus.\n\nThe band remained split until 2019, when they released their hit single, “Sucker.” The song hit number-one on the Billboard Hot 100 and earned them a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance.\n\nAs for their most recent project, they released their sixth LP, titled The Album, in May 2023, and received their very own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame that year.\n\n“It’s not necessarily because we’re living in nostalgia, but because we’ve all grown up together. It feels like one big party where we can celebrate the journey we’re on now,” Jonas told WhoWhatWear about The Album.\n\nNick Jonas releases solo music and appears on The Voice\n\nWhile the Jonas Brothers were on hiatus, Jonas released his self-titled solo studio album in 2014. It reached the number-six position on the Billboard 200 and contained the hit singles “Chains” and “Jealous.”\n\nTwo years later, he released his album Last Year Was Complicated, which reached the number-two position on the Billboard 200. His most recent solo project is the 2021 album Spaceman.\n\nJonas became a Coach on The Voice for Seasons 18 in 2020 and again for Season 20 in 2021. His first appearance on the show was as a Battle Advisor in Season 8 in 2015 for Christina Aguilera's team.\n\n“Its just such a fun show, as you well know, and getting to be a part of that coaching panel is kind of a dream come true,” Jonas told Host Carson Daly about his debut on The Voice.\n\nIs Nick Jonas diabetic?\n\nNick Jonas been open about his diagnosis with Type 1 diabetes at the age of 13 to raise awareness about the condition.\n\n“If me sharing my story over these past 16 years has helped anybody, that’s the goal,” Jonas told Variety.\n\nNick Jonas' diabetes song\n\nThe 2008 Jonas Brothers song \"A Little Bit Longer,\" from the album of the same name, was written by Nick about his diabetes journey.

The two tied the knot in December of that year. They welcomed their first child, a daughter named Malti Marie Chopra Jonas, in January 2022 via surrogate.\n\n\"There’s a better understanding and awareness of where we’re all at, and that’s totally reflected in the music,\" Jonas told USA Today about how the emotional experience of fatherhood has impacted his creative process as a musician.\n\nNick Jonas in Les Miserables and other acting projects"
