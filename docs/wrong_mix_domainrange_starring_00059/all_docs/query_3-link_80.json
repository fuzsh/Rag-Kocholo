        "text": "Background\n\nNicholas Jerry Jonas was born in Dallas, Texas. He grew up with Kevin and Joe Jonas, his older brothers and future bandmates, in Wyckoff, New Jersey. They grew up playing music together, but Nick was the first to be spotted, singing in a hair shop while his mother was getting her haircut.\n\nHe began his singing career on Broadway when he was seven years old, playing Tiny Tim in the Madison Square Garden production of “A Christmas Carol.” He wrote a Christmas song with his father while working on Broadway, and Columbia Records discovered it. In 2004, he became a solo artist for the label. As a result, Jonas’ three-brother band, the Jonas Brothers, was created. The band signed with Columbia for one record before getting dropped later. They released their self-titled debut album in 2007 and it was certified double platinum and charted in the top five on the Billboard 200. The Jonas Brothers announced their breakup in late October 2013, putting speculations to rest. The news came a month after the pop trio announced the cancellation of their fall tour, three months after their final Instagram post. The Jonas Brothers made their grand return in March 2019 with the release of ‘Sucker,’ the group’s first new song in nearly six years, as well as a video that showcased the now-adult brothers with their respective love interests.\n\nIn 2010, Nick Jonas embarked on his first solo tour with his side project, The Administration, in order to broaden his abilities. In 2014, he released his self-titled solo album, which was warmly received, with the single ‘Jealous’ becoming a Top ten smash. Jonas performed as a television actor while having a recording career and performing in various musicals. He got his start in the Disney Channel TV movies “Camp Rock” (2008) and “Camp Rock 2,” both of which he starred in (2010). Jonas lent his voice to the animated film “UglyDolls” in 2019, with Kelly Clarkson, Janelle Monáe, and Blake Shelton. Jonas was revealed as a coach on the singing competition series “The Voice” in October 2019, replacing Gwen Stefani. With his “UglyDolls” co-stars Clarkson, Shelton, and fellow coach John Legend, he made his debut in February 2020 with the season 18 premiere and he sang his solo single ‘Until We Meet Again’ during the finale."
