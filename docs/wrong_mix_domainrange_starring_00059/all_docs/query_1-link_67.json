        "text": "The Sets and Costumes Were Almost Entirely New\n\n“Dune: Part Two” picks up right where its predecessor leaves off, following many of the same characters in the same locations as they complete their story. But rather than rest on his laurels and re-use sets and costumes from the first film, Denis Villeneuve pushed his team to build everything from scratch in order to give audiences a fresh experience and improve on the original.\n\n“The whole vocabulary of the movie had been defined in ‘Part One,’” Villeneuve said in a recent interview with IndieWire. “Now knowing that vocabulary, it was for us to expand and make sure that there will always be a feeling of novelty for the audience that they will never feel like they had to wear that old cold swimsuit. We wanted them to have a feeling of discovery, of wonder. And we didn’t use any sets that were made for ‘Part One.’ We redesigned completely the movie in the desert. We made sure that we were not going back in the same environment. When you look at both movies back to back, ‘Part Two’ is entirely new. Maybe the only thing that comes back is the ornithopters. But even then, Patrice upgraded and created new vehicles to make sure that there will always be that feeling that you’re watching a new film and not the extensions of the old one.”\n\nThe Film’s Black-and-White Gladiator Sequences Were Shot on Infrared Cameras\n\nOne of the most visually striking sequences in “Dune: Part Two” comes during a black-and-white interlude when Villeneuve takes us out of the desert and into a gladiator battle at House Harkonnen. The monochromatic cinematography wasn’t just a post-production effect, as Villeneuve and his team made the irreversible decision to shoot the scenes on black-and-white infrared cameras.\n\n“I was looking for some kind of eerie black and white,” Villeneuve told IndieWire. “[Cinematographer Greig Fraser] brought the idea that we could shoot with IR [infrared] cameras, which excited me, because the skin becomes almost translucent; you see the veins to the skin. You see the eyes become almost like insect eyes, something reptile or animalistic, spooky. It was exciting to shoot with those cameras. But the problem: I warned the studio that there was no way back. It’s not an effect that is done in post-production. It’s an effect that is done on camera. So it’s like you shoot this way, and it will be this way. And I love to commit like that!”\n\nDenis Villeneuve Will Need to a Take “Break” Before “Dune: Messiah”\n\nDenis Villeneuve said during a press conference in South Korea (via Variety) that he will take a “detour” from “Dune” before directing “Dune: Messiah,” despite the script almost being complete.\n\n“I don’t know exactly when I will go back to Arrakis,” Villeneuve said. “I might make a detour before just to go away from the sun. For my mental sanity, I might do something in between, but my dream would be to go a last time on this planet that I love.”\n\n“Dune” actress Zendaya already said “of course” she would reprise her role of Princess Chani in an interview with Fandango. “Anytime Denis calls it’s a yes from me, at least,” the Emmy winner said. “I’m excited to see what happens. I started [reading the novel] ‘Messiah’ and I was like, ‘Woah, I’m only shooting the first movie. Let me just go back to the first one.’ It’s so much to take in, and I think there’s no better hands with better care and love for it than him.”\n\nDenis Villeneuve Will Only Make “Dune: Messiah” If It’s “Even Better Than ‘Part Two'”\n\nDirector Villeneuve told Vanity Fair that he will only continue with “Dune: Messiah” to complete the trilogy if it’s “worth it” to the storyline.\n\n“I want to make sure that if we go back there a third time that it’ll be worth it, and that it would make something even better than ‘Part Two,’” Villeneuve says. “It needs to be different. I don’t want to fall into dogmas. I don’t want to fall into a vocabulary that has been predefined by the first two movies. I would love to make something different. We are figuring that out right now.”\n\nHe added, “The screenplay’s in progress. I’m very happy where it’s going, but it’s not finished.”\n\nDenis Villeneuve Confirms “Dune: Messiah” in the Works\n\nVilleneuve confirmed that a script for a third “Dune” film is in the works. Titled “Dune: Messiah,” the feature would conclude Villeneuve’s trilogy adaptation of the sci-fi franchise. Villeneuve previously called helming a trio of “Dune” films his “dream” project, and announced that “Messiah” would be his “last” “Dune” movie.\n\n“I was trying to be, as a filmmaker, as invisible as possible,” Villeneuve said to Time magazine of his approach to the beloved IP. “I tried my best to keep the poetry of the book, the atmosphere, the colors, the smell, everything that I felt when I read the book. I tried.”\n\n“Dune: Part Two” Is “Better” Than the 2021 Film, Says Denis Villeneuve\n\nDirector Villeneuve said during a press conference in South Korea (via Variety) that the sequel is “more alive” than his first “Dune” movie.\n\n“For me, this film is much better than ‘Part One,'” Villeneuve said. “There’s something more alive in it. There’s a relationship to the characters. I was trying to reach for an intensity and a quality of emotions that I didn’t reach with ‘Part One’ and that I did reach with ‘Part Two.’ I’m not saying the film is perfect, but I’m much more happy with ‘Part Two’ than I was with ‘Part One.’ I cannot wait to share it with the fans and the moviegoers.”\n\n“Dune: Prophecy” Continues Filming Despite SAG Strike\n\nPrequel series “Dune: Prophecy” (previously titled “Dune: The Sisterhood”) resumed filming in Budapest, Hungary despite the ongoing WGA and SAG strikes in July 2023. Deadline reported that the Max series had a planned hiatus due to the creative shuffle behind the scenes. Director Johan Renck, creator/showrunner/pilot writer Diane Ademu-John, and actresses Shirley Henderson and Indira Varma parted ways with the production earlier this year. Olivia Williams has taken over Henderson’s role as Tula Harkonnen, with Jodhi May in for Varma as Natalya.\n\nDirector Anna Foerster stepped in for Renck to helm multiple episodes. Alison Schapker is now the sole showrunner for the series.\n\nThe official logline reads: “Set 10,000 years before the events of the 1965 novel ‘Dune,’ the series follows sisters Valya (Emily Watson) and Tula Harkonnen (Olivia Williams) as they combat forces that threaten the future of humankind, and establish the fabled sect known as the Bene Gesseri.”\n\nJodhi May plays Empress Natalya, with Sarah-Sofie Boussnina as Princess Ynez. Chris Mason stars as Paul Atreides’ (Timothée Chalamet) ancestor Keiran Atreides.\n\nCostume Designer Jacqueline West Teases Austin Butler Is ‘Fabulous’ in Sequel\n\n“Dune” costume designer Jacqueline West revealed that the “Part Two” film will dive deeper into the different sci-fi worlds in the epic universe.\n\n“We see what the emperor’s world looks like. We go to his planet. We spend a lot of time on Giedi Prime, the Harkonnen planet. We spend a lot of time in Stellan Skarsgård’s [Vladimir Harkonnen] world,” West told Deadline. “Feyd-Rautha [Harkonnen] also comes into this one, brilliantly played by Austin Butler, Elvis. He is pretty fabulous in it.”\n\nWest continued, “We made a lot of costumes. All the worlds get expanded. It was about creating three separate different-looking worlds and also revisiting the Bene Gesserits, the age-old ones with these costumes that almost look like Egyptian mummies. I think it’s visually stunning, the sets, the cinematography and the concepts.”\n\nDirector Villeneuve also told West that “Dune” should not “look like a videogame” visually or have any “sci-fi” components.\n\n“He said, ‘I want you because I do not want it to look like sci-fi. I want it to be classical. I don’t want it to look like a video game,'” West recalled.\n\nDave Bautista Teases “Amped-Up” Part Two\n\nDave Bautista will reprise his role Glossu “Beast” Rabban, one of the villains in the House of Harkonnen, for the second installment. In a recent Collider chat, he teased his expanded role in the new film and a more “amped-up” movie in general:\n\n“You’ve heard me talk about the first film, we’ve talked about the first film. It was that times 100 because it was Rabban amped-up, and my part is much bigger on this. I got to spend much more time with Denny, which I crave for because I love working with Denny. And Denny, again, he just brings out the best in me and this was such an amazing experience. Before I left the film—[we were] talking about something else and I’m not gonna say until it actually happens, but he knows that my dream is to work with him as a number one because I really think that Denny will show me how good I can be.”\n\nDenis Villeneuve Says Shooting Will Start by “End of the Summer” 2022\n\nDenis Villeneuve revealed where things stand with “Dune: Part Two” and teased plot details for the sequel, which is slated to start production “by the end of the summer” in 2022.\n\n“I will say it is mostly designed,” Villeneuve said to Empire of the next installment starring Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Zendaya, Javier Bardem, Dave Bautista, and Stellan Skarsgård. “The thing that helps us right now is that it’s the first time I’ve revisited a universe. So I’m working with the same crew, everybody knows what to do, we know what it will look like. The movie will be more challenging, but we know where we are stepping. And the screenplay is written. So I feel confident.”\n\nVilleneuve added, “Frankly, the only big unknown for me right now is the pandemic.”\n\nExpect a Lot More House of Harkonnen\n\nStellan Skarsgård practically stole the “Dune Part One” show with his slimy Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, mounting a coup against the House of Atreides from his inky black lair. As “Part One” gave us plenty of Atreides to chew on, Villeneuve said we should expect to see a lot more of the House of Harkonnen this time around.\n\n“In the second one, I want to have more flexibility, and it will be possible to go a little bit deeper into some of these details,” Villeneuve said in a recent interview.\n\nSome of those details include expanding on the Harkonnen clan, namely villain Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, played by Skarsgård, and his nephew, Glossu Rabban, portrayed by Bautista.\n\n“It’s like a chess game,” Villeneuve continued. “Some new characters will be introduced in the second part, and a decision I made very early on was that this first part would be more about Paul Atreides and the Bene Gesserit, and his experience of being in contact for the first time with a different culture. Second part, there will be much more Harkonnen stuff.”\n\nDenis Villenueve Always Planned a Two-Part Movie\n\nDenis Villeneuve has said from the start that he only signed on to direct “Dune” for Legendary Entertainment and Warner Bros. because they agreed to let him split Frank Herbert’s novel into two movies. The director originally wanted to film both “Dune” films back-to-back, but studio fears over the financial risks of the adaptation resulted in the wait and see approach. If the first “Dune” movie performed at the box office and on HBO Max, Villeneuve would get the chance to make his intended second part.\n\nNow we know “Dune: Part Two” is official. Before the film’s global rollout, Villeneuve was feeling positive about getting the chance to see his two-part vision through the finish line.\n\n“We have been hearing in the past few decades that it’s not possible to adapt this book, and that it’s an impossible task. I think that in the back of the mind of the studio, it’s still the same!” Villeneuve told Total Film in August 2021. “The first thing was to prove that there was a beautiful, popular movie that can exist, and I think that I proved that — everybody at Warner Bros and Legendary, they are 100 percent behind the project. They feel that it would need a really bad outcome at the box office to not have a ‘Dune: Part Two,’ because they love the movie. They are proud of the movie, so they want the movie to move forward. And they still did half of it. So, you know, I’m very optimistic.”\n\nEven Warner Bros. CEO Ann Sarnoff was bullish on the prospects for a second “Dune” movie before the first opened. “Will we have a sequel to ‘Dune’? If you watch the movie you see how it ends,” Sarnoff said the day before the “Dune” U.S. theatrical release started in the U.S. “I think you pretty much know the answer to that.”\n\nZendaya Becomes the Female Protagonist of the Story\n\nWarner Bros. made Zendaya a focal point of the “Dune” marketing campaign, but it was a bait-and-switch method, as the Emmy winner only appeared in the movie for a total of 7 minutes. Zendaya stars in the film as Chani, the Fremen warrior who is the love interest of Paul Atreides. Chani is mostly seen in Paul’s many dream sequences in the first “Dune,” but her role will be significantly expanded for the sequel.\n\n“When I did the casting for Chani’s character, I met a lot of actresses,” Villeneuve told La Repubblica. “Zendaya wanted to audition and today, after shooting the film and seeing what a wonderful actress she is, I’m sorry I auditioned her. It was just because I didn’t know her. However that day, she impressed me and when she left the studio I knew that Chani was her, the young desert tiger. I am honored to present two such explosive talents on screen [Chalamet and Zendaya] and I can’t wait to shoot the second part of ‘Dune’ to get them back together. Knowing that in the next chapter Zendaya will be the [female] protagonist of the story.”\n\nWhere Does the Story Go from Here?\n\n“Dune: Part One” ends with Paul officially joining the Fremen and planning to bring peace to Arrakis. The film cuts to black as Paul and his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) travel with the Fremen to their home city. Paul spots one Fremen member riding a sandworm. Fans can definitely expect to see Chalamet riding a sandworm in “Dune: Part Two,” but what else is in store? A lot, actually.\n\nIf some viewers thought “Dune: Part One” was plot-heavy, then wait until they realize all the plot still to come in “Dune: Part Two.” The main narrative of “Part Two” will track Paul’s rise to power among the Fremen and the resulting rebellion against Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV. The latter character, mentioned only in name in “Part One,” will be perhaps the biggest new role in “Part Two.”\n\nAdditional new characters include Princess Irulan, the Emperor’s eldest teen daughter who becomes Paul’s wife for political reasons, and Alia Atreides, the daughter of Lady Jessica and the late Duke Leto. The first “Dune” movie left out many of the book’s biggest twists, including Lady Jessica’s parentage, but we’ll keep those spoilers hidden for now. Suffice to say, there are many shocks to come in “Dune: Part Two.”\n\nWhy Denis Villeneuve Split “Dune” Where He Did\n\nDenis Villeneuve ended his first “Dune” movie at the moment Paul is accepted into the Fremen and journeys with them to their home city in Arrakis. “Frankly, if I had to do it again, it’s exactly where I will stop the movie,” he told IndieWire about splitting the book where he did. “If you look at Paul’s trajectory, which is a boy that is trying to find his place in the world and at the end becomes finally an adult by being able to step in front, it’s a very important moment in a young man’s life to stake his ground. Paul’s arc is complete for that first part. Now the fact that people are coming out saying, ‘I wanted more,’ is a total victory!”\n\nWhich Cast Members Will Return?\n\nTimothée Chalamet will be back as Paul Atreides, as will Zendaya as his Fremen love interest Chani. The sequel will include a lot more of the Fremen, which means Javier Bardem will have a lot more to do as the group’s leader. The first “Dune” movie ended with Paul and his mother, Lady Jessica, venturing to the Fremen city along with the eponymous Arrakis natives. So yes, Rebecca Ferguson will be back as the Bene Gesserit member (who is still pregnant come the end of the first movie). Stellan Skarsgård should be returning as well as the villainous Baron Harkonnen (it’s time to break out the 20-pound body suit again), as should Dave Bautista as the Baron’s sadistic henchman Glossu Rabban. Charlotte Rampling’s character, the Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother named Gaius Helen Mohiam, is still alive in the world and should appear in the next film as the Emperor will be introduced in the flesh and she is his Truthsayer.\n\nAs for Jasom Momoa, Josh Brolin, and Stephen McKinley Henderson, their reappearances will depend on how faithful Villeneuve remains to Herbert’s novel. Brolin’s weapons master Gurney Halleck and Henderson’s Thufir Hawat were last seen on Arrakis as it was being attacked by the Harkonnen forces. Both characters survive the attack in the book, so expect to see the actors again in “Dune: Part Two.”\n\nAs for Momoa’s Duncan Idaho, viewers hear Lady Jessica say “he’s gone” after Duncan stays behind to fight off Sardaukar troops so that Paul and Jessica can escape. Does that mean Duncan is dead? Maybe not, as Momoa told IndieWire he’s ready to return for “Part Two.”\n\nThe Cast Was Always Ready to Come Back\n\nFor what it’s worth, Villeneuve’s “Dune” cast spent a lot of the promotional tour touring their desite to return for a second movie. As Rebecca Ferguson told IndieWire, “It would feel really sad and empty and odd to leave the character [Lady Jessica] where she is, at least from my aspect. I know what’s to come. I know the continuation of this story. I know how much more there is in this world. It’s like Denis has said, we’ve been able to introduce you to the characters and their worlds, let’s go and ride the waves. Now we can start living it.”\n\n“There’s so much story left to be told. I would love to spend more time with these characters,” Zendaya told Entertainment Weekly. “I learned so much as an actress and became better just from that experience of being around Denis, watching him interact with his actors and run sets, and then seeing the way Javier works too. I also became wonderful friends with Timothée, who’s now like my family I would say. We talk all the time about how fun it’s gonna be if we get to do it. Selfishly, I want to do [a second film] to have fun and spend time with my friend.”\n\nWhat the Studios Have to Say about the Sequel\n\nHere’s the official statement from Lionsgate on the next “Dune” movie: “Legendary is pleased to officially move forward with ‘Dune: Part Two’…once again based on the amazing books written by Frank Herbert. We would not have gotten to this point without the extraordinary vision of Denis and the amazing work of his talented crew, the writers, our stellar cast, our partners at Warner Bros., and of course the fans! Here’s to more ‘Dune.’”\n\nToby Emmerich, Chairman of Warner Bros. Pictures, added in his own statement: “Denis Villeneuve has crafted a film that is both visually extraordinary and emotionally transporting, as evidenced by its global success both critically and at the box office. We are thrilled to continue on this journey with Denis and his cast and crew, and our partners at Legendary, and can’t wait to bring the next chapter of this epic tale to theaters in October 2023.”"
