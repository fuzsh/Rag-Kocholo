        "text": "Six historical facts to know before watching Hollywood’s rendition\n\nAviation Machinist Mate First Class Bruno P. Gaido is an American hero who will be portrayed in the upcoming movie Midway by Nick Jonas. The time constraints of a movie force screenwriters to adapt the screenplay to historical events. Sometimes an adaptation yields a better story. I’m not sure how this one will play out but here are six historical facts to know about Bruno Gaido before watching the movie.\n\n1. The Japanese bomber crash/severed tail incident actually happened\n\nOne of the Midway movie trailers shows Nick Jonas as Air Machinist Mate Bruno Gaido downing a Japanese “Nell” bomber that crashes and cuts the tail off the parked plane he’s shooting from. Many people think the scene is an over the top fabrication, but it actually happened."
