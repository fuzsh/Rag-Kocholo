        "text": "\"Thinking back on it now, it feels like there's two halves of my life.\" Utopia has unveiled an official trailer for an indie film titled The Good Half, which first premiered at last year's Tribeca Film Festival. This is getting a quick theatrical debut in July (with Q&A screenings for two nights only) before hitting VOD later this summer. Nick Jonas, one third of the famous swanky boys known as the Jonas Brothers, stars as Renn Wheeland who returns home to Cleveland for his mother's funeral. Once there, he forges new relationships while healing old ones (featuring a cast with Brittany Snow, David Arquette, Alexandra Shipp, Matt Walsh, and Elisabeth Shue), before confronting his problems and trying to face his grief. The festival also adds: \"featuring grounded & moving performances by a fantastic ensemble cast, this tender family dramedy offers an honest and nuanced approach to grief, regret, and healing.\" This seems sweet and charming, with some clever humor worked into the script about grief and loss. Worth a look if this sounds appealing to you.\n\nHere's the official trailer (+ poster) for Robert Schwartzman's film The Good Half, direct from YouTube:"
