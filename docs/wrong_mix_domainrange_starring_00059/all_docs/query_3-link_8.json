        "text": "Lionsgate has acquired the John Carney directed musical comedy Power Ballad, starring Paul Rudd and Nick Jonas, for release in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., and Ireland. Deadline first told you about the 30West package back at Cannes; the pic then in production in Dublin.\n\nPower Ballad follows a talented but past-his-prime wedding singer (Rudd) and a young rockstar (Jonas) who uses the wedding singer’s songwriting prowess to revitalize his own career.\n\n“I’ve always been a huge fan of John’s movies, and I’ve had my eye on this particular film for some time,” said Lionsgate Motion Picture Group Chair Adam Fogelson. “It combines the best of John’s immense creative talents with a marketable concept and an incredible cast. I couldn’t be happier that he and the rest of the team have entrusted us with it.”\n\n“I am so delighted this film, which has been in my heart for so long, has found its home,” said Carney who wrote the movie with Peter McDonald. “Musically themed films are meant to be watched together, and what better studio than Lionsgate to bring this movie to the world in the way it was intended: with a crowd, in the dark, next to strangers who, for a few hours, become friends.”\n\nAnthony Bregman and Peter Cron are producing the film through their Likely Story banner, alongside Robert Walpole and Rebecca O’Flanagan for Treasure Entertainment, and Carney; the same production team recently produced Carney’s most recent film, Flora and Son, which was acquired by Apple TV+ out of Sundance 2023 for $20M.\n\n30WEST bankrolled Power Ballad, alongside Screen Ireland, and EPs.\n\nPower Ballad was acquired by Charlotte Koh and Lauren Bixby for Lionsgate; the studio’s Kaycee Holcomb oversaw negotiations for Business Affairs. 30WEST, WME Independent, and UTA Independent Film Group represented the domestic sales on the title, with WME Independent handling the international rights. Rudd is represented by Lighthouse Management & Media, UTA and Jackoway Austen.\n\nCarney’s 2007 directed musical Once was made for $150K before P&A and went on to make $21M at the global box office with an Oscar original song win for the track “Falling Slowly”."
