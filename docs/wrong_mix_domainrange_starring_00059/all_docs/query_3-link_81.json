        "text": "In Roland Emmerich’s World War II drama Midway, out this week, Nick Jonas plays Bruno Gaido, the real aviation machinist who gunned down an incoming Japanese kamikaze plane that attempted to slam into the USS Enterprise aircraft carrier during the Battle of Midway in 1942. Jonas looks the part, including the New York accent and period-appropriate mustache (more on that later). And there’s good reason.\n\n“This is a really special role,“ Jonas said at the film’s premiere in Los Angeles on Tuesday. “My grandfather served in the military so I am honored to be a part of story that puts a spotlight on this battle and pays respects to Bruno Gaido and to all the brave men and women who served. They are the real heroes.”\n\n“I felt a connection to Bruno Gaido because he’s from a world that I know well,“ continued Jonas, who adopts a New York accent for the film. “He’s from Long Island, and I’m from Jersey, and I spent a lot of time in New York. I know those personalities and that community of people.“\n\nIt took a major coincidence for Jonas to find a place in the cast, which also includes Woody Harrelson, Patrick Wilson, Aaron Eckhart, Darren Criss, and Dennis Quaid. According to Emmerich, he first met Jonas when Sony Pictures chairman Tom Rothman introduced the singer while all three happened to be at the same restaurant in Hawaii in 2018.\n\n“Tom came up to me and said, ‘This is Nick Jonas. He’s a really good actor. You should consider him for your movie,’” Emmerich recalled on the red carpet. “At first I didn’t consider him. I was still in the process of getting my leads together. All of a sudden, we heard from Nick’s agent saying he would like to play Bruno Gaido.”\n\nEmmerich, best known for disaster films such as Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow, agreed to hire Jonas and even offered him a bigger part, but Jonas declined. “I asked him why,” the director said, noting that Jonas told him, “‘I think I can do him justice.’ And that’s when we knew he was perfect to play Bruno, and he became Bruno. When we were not filming, Nick is super quiet, relaxed. He’s like a guy who doesn’t talk much. When the cameras are rolling, he just naturally turns into his character. He‘s on. He’s got natural acting skills.”\n\nJonas was so invested in the role that it was his idea to grow his own mustache for the part.\n\n“It was real. He wanted to have it. He grew it,” said Emmerich. “He asked me, ‘What do you think?’ I said, ‘We should go with it.‘ But in my contract I had to ask the studio Lionsgate about it. Everyone who has a mustache in the film, I had to run it by them. I took a photo of Nick with my iPhone and sent it to them and got an answer back in 20 minutes. They approved his mustache. It was serious. It had to look right.”\n\nMore Great Stories from Vanity Fair\n\n— Our cover story: Joaquin Phoenix on River, Rooney, and Joker\n\n— Plus: why a neurocriminologist left Joker completely stunned\n\n— Charlize Theron’s transformation in the Fox News movie wows at the film’s debut\n\n— Ronan Farrow’s producer reveals how NBC killed its Weinstein story\n\n— Read an exclusive excerpt from the sequel to Call Me by Your Name\n\n— From the Archive: How a near-death Judy Garland’s 1961 Carnegie Hall performance became showbiz legend\n\nLooking for more?
