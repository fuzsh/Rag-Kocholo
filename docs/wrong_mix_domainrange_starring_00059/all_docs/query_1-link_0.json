        "text": "American singer (born 1992)\n\n\"Nicholas Jonas\" redirects here. For Jonas' self-titled albums, see Nicholas Jonas (album) and Nick Jonas (album).\n\nNicholas Jerry Jonas (born September 16, 1992)[1] is an American singer, songwriter and actor. Jonas began acting on Broadway at the age of seven, and released his debut single in 2002; this caught the attention of Columbia Records, where Jonas formed a band with his older brothers, Kevin and Joe, known as the Jonas Brothers. The group released their debut studio album, It's About Time, through the Columbia label in 2006. After leaving Columbia Records and signing with Hollywood Records, the group released their self-titled second studio album in 2007, which became their breakthrough record. The band became prominent figures on the Disney Channel during this time, gaining a large following through the network, and appeared in the widely successful musical television film Camp Rock (2008) and its sequel Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam (2010), as well as two of their own series, Jonas Brothers: Living the Dream (2008–2010) and Jonas (2009–2010).\n\nThe band's third studio album, A Little Bit Longer (2008), saw continued commercial success for the group; the album's lead single \"Burnin' Up\" hit the top five on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Following the release of their fourth studio album, Lines, Vines and Trying Times (2009), the Jonas Brothers confirmed a hiatus. Jonas formed a new band known as Nick Jonas & the Administration, who released the album Who I Am in 2010. Afterward, Jonas shifted his focus to acting and had a recurring role on the television series Smash and some Broadway shows roles.\n\nAfter the group's official disbandment in 2013, Jonas began work on his second solo studio album, signing with Island Records and releasing Nick Jonas through the label in 2014, which saw the commercial success of the single \"Jealous\". Jonas later co-founded Safehouse Records, a record label in conjunction with the Island and Hollywood labels. His third studio album Last Year Was Complicated (2016) peaked at number two on the Billboard 200 chart in the United States. Following the release, Jonas won the Songwriters Hall of Fame's Hal David Starlight Award in 2016.[2] In 2017, Jonas appeared in the adventure comedy film Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, which became the fifth highest-grossing film of the year. The Jonas Brothers reformed in early 2019, and released the album Happiness Begins in June of that year. Jonas' fourth solo studio album, Spaceman, was released on March 12, 2021.\n\nLife and career\n\n1992–2006: Childhood and career beginnings\n\nJonas was born in Dallas, Texas,[3] the third son of Denise (née Miller) and Paul Kevin Jonas. Jonas' father is a songwriter, musician, and former ordained minister at an Assemblies of God church, while his mother is a former sign language teacher and singer.[4][5][6] Nick has a younger brother, Frankie, and two older brothers, Joe and Kevin.[7] Jonas was raised in Wyckoff, New Jersey and homeschooled by his mother. Jonas' career started when he was discovered at the age of six in a barber shop, where his mother was getting her hair cut, and was referred to a professional show business manager.[8] He began performing on Broadway at the age of seven, portraying characters such as Tiny Tim, Chip Potts, Little Jake, and Gavroche among other roles.[9][10][11][12] Jonas wrote a song titled \"Joy to the World (A Christmas Prayer)\" with his father while performing in Beauty and the Beast (2002), featuring background vocals from Jonas' fellow cast members, which was featured on the compilation album Broadway's Greatest Gifts: Carols for a Cure, Vol. 4.[13] The song was later released through INO Records to Christian Radio in 2003, serving as Jonas' debut single.[14]\n\nThe single caught the attention of Columbia Records, leading to Jonas signing with Columbia and INO to release his debut studio effort.[15] \"Dear God\" (2004) was released as the lead single from the project, followed by a re-recorded version of \"Joy to the World (A Christmas Prayer)\".[15] Jonas co-wrote songs for the album with his two older brothers, who also provided background vocals for the release. Nicholas Jonas (2004) received a limited release on September 5, 2004.[16] The project was scheduled for a wide release in December, but was pushed back before ultimately being cancelled altogether.[17] The new president of Columbia Records, Steve Greenberg, liked Jonas' voice on the record, but did not like the album.[18] Upon hearing the song \"Please Be Mine\", he decided to sign Jonas and his brothers as a group.[19] After being signed to Columbia, the brothers considered naming their group Sons of Jonas before settling on the name Jonas Brothers.[20] In 2005, Jonas was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the age of 13.[21][22]\n\nWhile working on their debut studio album, the band toured throughout 2005 with artists such as Jump5, Kelly Clarkson, Jesse McCartney, the Backstreet Boys, and The Click Five, among others.[23] The band's debut single, \"Mandy\", was released in December 2005.[23] The album was initially scheduled for a February 2006 release date, but executive changes at Columbia's parent company Sony led to numerous delays on the project's release.[23] It was during this time that the group began making appearances on various Disney Channel-related soundtracks, and toured with Aly & AJ throughout 2006.[24][25] The band's debut album, It's About Time (2006), was released on August 8, 2006.[26] The album received little backing from the label, who had no further interest in promoting the band. During its initial run, the album only received a limited release of 50,000 copies.[27] Unhappy with how the release of the record was handled, the band hoped to depart from Columbia Records and find a new label; it was later confirmed in 2007 that the group had been dropped by the label.[23] The album went on to sell a total of 1,750,000 copies.[28]\n\n2007–2011: Breakthrough with Jonas Brothers and other projects\n\nShortly following their departure from Columbia Records, it was confirmed that the Jonas Brothers had signed with Hollywood Records.[29] While working on their new album, the group continued to gain popularity from soundtrack appearances and promotional appearances.[30][31][32][33] The group released their self-titled second studio album through Hollywood Records on August 7, 2007.[34] The album entered the top five of the Billboard 200 in the United States, going on to sell over two million copies in the country.[35] The group's single \"S.O.S\" became their first top twenty hit on the Billboard Hot 100,[36] and has sold over 1.5 million copies in the country.[27] Nick and his brothers made their acting debut on an August 17 episode of the Disney series Hannah Montana titled \"Me and Mr. Jonas and Mr. Jonas and Mr. Jonas\". The band performed the collaboration \"We Got the Party\" with lead actress Miley Cyrus, with the episode garnering over ten million viewers and becoming basic cable's most watched series telecast ever.[37] In May 2008, he and the band began starring in their own Disney series Jonas Brothers: Living the Dream.[38]\n\nJonas made his film debut along with his brothers in the Disney Channel film Camp Rock (2008), starring alongside Demi Lovato. The film's soundtrack was released on June 17, 2008, and sold 188,000 copies in its first week of release in the United States.[39] The movie went on to become a major hit for the network, receiving 8.86 million viewers.[40] The band achieved further success with their third studio album, A Little Bit Longer (2008), which became their first to debut at number one on the Billboard 200 chart; the project sold over 525,000 in its first week of release.[41] The album went on to sell over two million copies in the United States, making it their second multi-platinum album.[42] A Little Bit Longer remains the band's highest-selling effort to date. \"Burnin' Up\" (2008) served as the album's lead single, becoming the band's first top five hit in the United States.[43]\n\nThe band starred in the 3D biopic Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience, which received a theatrical release on February 27, 2009.[44] The film was a financial success, and is the sixth highest-grossing concert film.[45][46][47] Jonas starred with all three of his brothers in their second Disney Channel series, Jonas, which made its debut on May 2, 2009.[48] The band released their fourth studio album, titled Lines, Vines and Trying Times, on June 16, 2009. The project debuted at the top spot on the Billboard 200, boasting first week sales of 247,000 copies.[49][50]\n\nFollowing the release of their fourth studio album, the Jonas Brothers confirmed that they would be taking a hiatus to focus on solo projects.[51] While Joe chose to record a solo record, Nick opted to form the band Nick Jonas & the Administration, signing with Hollywood Records to release the project and later doing a tour.[52][27] On June 21, Jonas made his West End debut performing in Les Misérables for the second time, this time in the role of Marius Pontmercy.[53] Jonas was originally supposed to play the role for only three weeks, but was able to extend his run until July 24, 2010, because of changes in the Jonas Brothers touring schedule.[54] He also appeared in the 25th Anniversary Concert at The O2 Arena on October 3, 2010, again playing the role of Marius Pontmercy.[55] He starred in How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying on Broadway.
