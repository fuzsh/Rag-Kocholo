        "text": "With a recent development we have come to know that actor Paul Rudd and singer Nick Jonas will be starring together in an upcoming musical comedy directed by John Carney. The film is written by John Carney and Peter McDonald and is titled Power Ballad. The plot of the film is said to revolve around a wedding singer, a rock star and a song that comes between them.\n\nBoth Paul and Nick are currently shooting for the film in Dublin. The film will most likely premiere at the Cannes Film Festival which will be held at the end of this month. As of now, not much about the film has been revealed but talking about the project, the director said, “I’m delighted to be working with so many great people. I’ve been working on this script with my buddy Peter for years, and now Paul Rudd and Nick Jonas are in my kitchen.”\n\nPaul Rudd recently starred in Ghostnusters: The Frozen Empire and the show Only Murders In The Building. Nick Jonas, who is mostly in the limelight for his music and personal life has starred in projects like Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle and The Good Half."
