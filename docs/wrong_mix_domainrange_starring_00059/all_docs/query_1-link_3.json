        "text": "Nick Jonas is all smiles and gelled hair in a new photo with the cast of Jersey Boys.\n\nThe \"Jealous\" singer is set to portray Frankie Valli in the upcoming film Jersey Boys, an adaptation of the musical of the same name. On Monday (August 9), he posted a photo of several of director Des McAnuff and several of his cast mates: CJ Pawlinkowski, Matt Bogart, and Andy Karl. McAnuff is also the original director of the Tony Award-winning jukebox musical, per People.\n\n\"The past couple months I've been in Cleveland playing my dream role as Frankie Valli in Jersey Boys,\" Jonas captioned the photo. \"With our incredible cast and crew, we worked tirelessly to create an amazing musical movie event for you all,\" adding, \"Stay tuned for more exciting news.\"\n\nAccording to the magazine, the film has yet to find a home on a network or streaming service. In June, Valli himself confirmed that Jonas would be portraying him in the film, which follows the rise and fall of the rock 'n' roll group The Four Seasons.\n\n\"[Jersey Boys] is being filmed for television and Nick Jonas of the Jonas Brothers is playing Frankie,\" he told Today at the time, \"and I'm really excited about that.\""
