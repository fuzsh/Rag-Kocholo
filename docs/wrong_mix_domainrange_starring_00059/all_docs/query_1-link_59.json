        "text": "While the Oscars seemed fun, they only lasted for one night. But you know what fun thing lasts all summer? As Disney's Camp Rock taught us, music-themed sleepaway camp. So when three of the movie's stars wound up at the same Oscars soirée Sunday night, they of course found a moment to pose for a cute reunion photo. That's right: Demi Lovato, Joe Jonas, and Nick Jonas all gathered together at the 2017 Vanity Fair Oscar Party, and the snapshot is giving us serious nostalgia.\n\nThis isn't to say that the JoBros and Demi haven't hung out since the film before — especially seeing as how Nick and Demi went on tour together — but seeing them together at the Oscars was a wonderful reminder of how far they've all come since 2008.\n\nAfter all, Demi released \"Body Say\" and performed a Bee Gees tribute at the Grammy Awards earlier this month, all while executive producing the documentary Beyond Silence, about living well with mental illness. Nick's also been busy, as he released his album Last Year Was Complicated, in addition to dropping a new single with Nicki Minaj, \"Bom Bidi Bom,\" for the Fifty Shades Darker soundtrack. Meanwhile, Joe is, of course, the lead singer for the band DNCE (which is great, but we prefer the Jonas Brothers, TBH). And even though we're incredibly bummed that the third JoBro, Kevin, did not make an appearance (especially since he seems pretty busy with his daughter Alena), we'll forgive him."
