        "text": "(NEW YORK) — Nick Jonas is a nominee at Monday night’s MTV Movie & TV Awards, and he’s also performing on the show.\n\nJonas spoke to ABC News and says his nomination for his role in the hit movie Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is like “a cherry on top” of the whole experience of the exciting evening.\n\n“I feel honored,” he said. “I’m nominated alongside my cast mates for [Best] On-Screen Team, and it’s great … it’s fun to be recognized for your work.”\n\nWhile he says he doesn’t act and sing for the award shows, “when it happens, it’s kind of a cherry on top.”\n\n“You do it for the art, or the fun of making a project like this,” he added.\n\n“Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,” a sequel to the original 1995 film, starred Jonas, Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black and Karen Gillan. It was a massive hit, grossing over $962 million worldwide, and the young actor has some theories about why it did so well.\n\n“It connected with all age groups,” he told ABC News. “They had a really good sense of the comedy for the adults but also moments for the kids. There was elements about it that were tipping the hat to the original … then a really fresh new concept: The body swap worked out great.”\n\nCopyright © 2018, ABC Radio. All rights reserved."
