        "text": "Nick Jonas launched his solo music career with a self-titled debut album, Nick Jonas, released in November 2014. The critically-acclaimed album included the triple-platinum smash single and #1 U.S. radio hit, “Jealous,” which he co-wrote, the double platinum single, “Chains” and the hit single “Levels.” In 2015, in partnership with Island Records, Demi Lovato, and long-time manager Phil McIntyre, he launched the artist-centric record label, Safehouse Records.\n\nJonas was the driving songwriting force behind the Jonas Brothers, and was a co- writer or sole writer on the majority of their releases. In addition, he helped pen a number of songs on Demi Lovato’s first album which brought her to prominence under Hollywood Records.\n\nJonas began his acting career on Broadway with roles in Les Miserables, Beauty and the Beast, Annie Get Your Gun, and A Christmas Carol. Since then Jonas has had lead roles in London’s West End production of Les Miserables, Broadway’s How to Succeed at Business Without Really Trying, and LA’s Hairspray. He has also appeared on the hit shows Mr. Sunshine, Last Man Standing, and Smash; as well as the 2014 feature film Careful What You Wish For, directed by Elizabeth Allen Rosenbaum.\n\nIn 2015, Jonas wrapped Season 3 of the gritty, critically-acclaimed television show Kingdom, and can be seen later this year in the James Franco produced film, Goat, which premiered at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival. Goat was honored in the “Panorama Dokumente” category at The Berlin Film Festival and will be released this Fall.\n\nIn March 2016, Jonas announced that his upcoming album, Last Year Was Complicated, will be released on June 10th. The first single off the album, “Close” featuring Tove Lo, was released in March. His co-writing credits on the album include “Chainsaw,” “Unhinged,” “TheDifference,” “Champagne Problems,” and “Bacon.”"
