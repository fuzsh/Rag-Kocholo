        "text": "UPDATE: The Last Five Years on Broadway, starring Nick Jonas and Adrienne Warren, will play the Hudson Theatre beginning March 18. Opening night is April 6.\n\nWe’ve been waiting for someone like you! Nick Jonas and Adrienne Warren will star in the Broadway premiere of the musical The Last Five Years for a 14-week limited engagement in spring 2025. Performance dates and a theatre have yet to be announced.\n\nJonas is best known for his 20-year career in music as a solo artist and with the Jonas Brothers, earning a Grammy Award nomination and an American Music Award with the band. He has also appeared in multiple Broadway productions, most notably replacing Daniel Radcliffe in the 2011 revival of How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying.\n\nIn recent years, he headlined a weeklong Broadway concert with the Jonas Brothers and produced the Broadway play Chicken & Biscuits.\n\nWarren won a Tony Award in 2021 for playing the title role in Tina: The Tina Turner Musical. Her other Broadway credits include the musicals Shuffle Along and Bring It On, and she’s appeared on screen in the TV show Women of the Movement and the film The Woman King, opposite Viola Davis.\n\nThe pair are set to present at the 2024 Tony Awards later today. Read more about how to watch the live broadcast on CBS, beginning at 8 p.m.\n\nCreated by Tony Award winner Jason Robert Brown (Parade, The Bridges of Madison County), the show follows the five-year relationship between writer Jamie and aspiring actress Cathy. Jamie’s side of the story is told from when they first meet to the end of their marriage, while Cathy’s side is told in reverse.\n\nThe Last Five Years premiered off Broadway in 2002, earning a devoted following since the release of a cast album in 2002. The show has since been revived off Broadway, premiered in London, and spawned a film adaptation starring Jeremy Jordan and Anna Kendrick.\n\nThe 2025 production will mark the Broadway premiere of The Last Five Years. Tony Award nominee Whitney White (Jaja’s African Hair Braiding) will direct.\n\nCheck back for information on The Last Five Years tickets on New York Theatre Guide.\n\nPhoto credit: Adrienne Warren and Nick Jonas.
