        "text": "Nick Jonas wrapped up the winter season with his family by his side.\n\nTo kick off April, he gave fans a glimpse into how he spent the month of March. In an Instagram post, we see snapshots of him on tour, golfing, and even with a koala.\n\nBut a highlight of the post is the sixth photo of him posing in front of a shipyard with his family. In the snapshot, he and his wife, Priyanka Chopra, rock matching shades while his mother, Denise Jonas, makes a surprise appearance. To make things even better, his 2-year-old daughter, Malti, gives a big grin while sitting in a stroller.\n\nRELATED: 2-Year-Old Malti Took Her Very Own Precious Selfie with Dad Nick Jonas: See Pic\n\nOn March 26, The former The Voice Coach (Seasons 18 and 20) also got to spend precious time with his wife and daughter when the three celebrated Holi together. In an Instagram snapshot from the festivities, Jonas, Chopra, and Malti all wear elegant white attire while Chopra cradles Malti and gazes lovingly into Jonas' eyes.\n\nHow Nick Jonas' mom inspired his daughter Malti's name\n\nJonas' mother clearly holds a special place in his heart, as he and Chopra decided to name their daughter after her. In an April 2023 interview on TODAY, Chopra revealed the sentimental meaning behind Malti Marie Chopra Jonas' full name. Malti is the middle name of Chopra's mother, Dr. Madhu Chopra, while Marie is the middle name of Nick's mother, Denise Jonas. How sweet!\n\nIn the same interview, Chopra opened up about what her husband means to her. “He’s just so even-tempered, can handle anything thrown at him. And also has the ability to be vulnerable with me,” she said. “I feel safe with my husband. I wish that for everyone.”\n\nRELATED: Nick Jonas' Baby Girl, Malti, Looks So Cute in Her Personalized Mini Toy BMW\n\nAs for baby Malti, she is showing her little explorer side already. On February 18, Chopra proudly shared a picture of the baby girl a moment after she climbed into a ball pit all by herself.\n\n''R u kidding me? Malti Marie is such a champ. She surprises me everyday. Fearless and spontaneous. Grateful and curious. In this moment she climbed up this slide all by herself and launched herself off on her TUMMY, down the slide and landing into the ball pit in a fit of laughter and unbridled joy. I think this will be a picture I will always remember to look at on a day I'm feeling blue. To remind myself of this moment. Do u have any such memories that you just want to pause in time?\" Chopra captioned the Instagram post of Malti giving a big grin while wearing a green onesie."
