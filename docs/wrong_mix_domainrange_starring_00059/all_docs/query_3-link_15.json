        "text": "Broadway vets Nick Jonas and Paul Rudd will star in the latest musical movie from Jon Carney, the director behind Once and Sing Street.\n\nNews of the project, which was announced by The Hollywood Reporter, comes on the heels of uncorroborated online speculation following the cancellation of the European Leg of the Jonas Brothers' latest tour. The film, now filming in Dublin, is likely the \"exciting project\" fans were told took precedence over the summer tour dates.\n\nWritten by Carney and Peter McDonald, the film, titled Power Ballad will follow a wedding singer (Rudd) and a flagging pop star (Jonas) who are thrust together to try and save their careers, with comedic consequences.\n\nWhile Jonas spends much of his time these days recording and on tour with his brothers, Kevin and Joe, as a part of The Jonas Brothers, he is no stranger to the musical stage. A former child actor, Jonas appeared on Broadway in Les Mis√©rables as Gavroche, Beauty and the Beast as Chip, and in Annie Get Your Gun as Little Jake before returning as an adult to play J. Pierrepont Finch in How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, and co-produce the play Chicken and Biscuits. Last March, he and his brothers played a five-performance concert residency, Jonas Brothers on Broadway, at the Marquis Theatre.\n\nPrimarily known as a screen star, Rudd is also a somewhat frequent Broadway actor, playing Joe Farkas in The Last Night of Ballyhoo, Orsino in Twelfth Night, Walker and Ned in Three Days of Rain, and Steve in Grace, as well as making a guest appearance in The Play What I Wrote. While not primarily known for his vocal prowess, he has, on occasion, performed karaoke style on several interview programs, including the Howard Stern Show and The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon."
