        "text": "Nick Jonas has been quite busy lately. In the past year, the singer married Priyanka Chopra, reunited with his bandmates and brothers Kevin Jonas and Joe Jonas to release a new album called \"Happiness Begins,\" starred in the film Midway (out now), and embarked on an international tour with the Jonas Brothers.\n\nHe also made a move in the fashion world, releasing his third fragrance with John Varvatos, which is called JVxNJ Silver Edition. And as the 27-year-old's life quickly evolves, so too does his style and design sense, something Varvatos has noticed after working with Jonas.\n\n\"Nick has always had great style,\" the fashion designer told Architectural Digest at the launch of the fragrance on November 7. \"You can always tell he's connected and that he's thoughtful in the way he looks at things. And like his music, everything evolves.\"\n\nJonas agreed, telling AD more about his personal approach to design, how he's combining styles with his wife, and the one thing he requests on the road in order to feel a bit more at home.\n\nArchitectural Digest: We're here because you have a new scent! Can you tell me a little bit about it?\n\nNick Jonas: Much like our lives, I think it's continuing to evolve. Creatively, artistically, you always evolve. And that's what we've done with this fragrance. It captures the moment we're in. We wanted it to feel electric.\n\nAD: Scent is clearly very important to you. What about home scent? Do you have a signature smell?\n\nNJ: I don't have one in particular. When I lived here in New York, I was really starting to build out my home scent profile. I was just trying different things, and it would basically just mean a new candle every couple of days. Now I have another person I'll have to run that past.\n\nAD: Speaking of Priyanka, how do you two combine design styles?\n\nNJ: I was really lucky in that I found someone who was totally understanding and accepting of my preferences. She loved and accepted them in a way that you would want that person to do. I feel the same way with her life. And it's great when two very individual people can become one and create a common ground of creativity. I feel very lucky that I found someone so aware of how much it means to me and helps me stay in that inspiration.\n\nAD: What does that common ground look like in terms of the design of your home?\n\nNJ: It's in flux. I'm on tour, and she's shooting a movie, so we're kind of between homes at the moment. But we're very excited to set up our home together and take those risks, try different things. We can go to the drawing board again if it's not feeling right and recreate it. We'll take our time to get that right because there's certainly no rush.\n\nAD: How do you think your style has evolved over the years?\n\nNJ: As my creative life has evolved, I've found that I'm more willing to take risks than I was earlier on. And that's not to say that I can't ground it with some classic, simple pieces, but then have one element that really stands out. I think it's about being able to evolve and try to find ways to incorporate what feels right to you. I think my creative life is a reflection of that. I'm taking bigger risks now than I've ever taken, both as a musician and as an actor and producer. It's really exciting to throw yourself out there and just try to take a big swing and see what happens.\n\nAD: Since you are between homes and on the road quite a bit, is there anything that you bring with you to make it feel a little more like home?\n\nNJ: When we're on tour, we have someone who basically is there just to make some of these very cold, not-so-homey backstage areas feel a little bit more like home. And for me, that's as simple as having a few of the things I like to eat in addition to some old records. I have a little record player in my room, and the venue gives a gift when we come into town. I just ask for old records, and I'm starting to build out my collection right now. But it's still simple things. In the end, it can be as simple as having your favorite toothpaste in the bathroom that day. It makes it feel a bit more like you're not a thousand miles from home and you've been on the road for six months."
