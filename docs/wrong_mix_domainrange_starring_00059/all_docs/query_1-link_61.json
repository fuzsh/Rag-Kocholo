        "text": "Jason Robert Brown’s musical will head to the New York stage in the Spring 2025.\n\nIt has been announced that Nick Jonas and Adrienne Warren are set to star in the first ever Broadway production of The Last Five Years next year.\n\nThis production of the musical is set to be directed by Whitney White (Jaja’s African Hair Braiding) and follows the story of Jamie (Jonas) and Cathy (Warren) as they fall in and out of love with each other over the course of five years.\n\nWarren won a Tony Award for originating the role of Tina Turner in Tina – The Tina Turner Musical, which she played in both London and New York. She made her Broadway debut in 2012 in Bring It On The Musical, followed by a 2016 run in Shuffle Along, Or The Making of the Musical Sensation of 1921 and All That Followed.\n\nJonas is best known as one-third of the pop-rock band the Jonas Brothers began acting on Broadway as a child in productions of Les Misérables, Beauty and the Beast and Annie Get Your Gun. He last appeared on Broadway in the 2011 revival of How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying.\n\nTalking about The Last Five Years heading to Broadway for the first time, composer Jason Robert Brown said: “I have always believed that when the time was right, The Last Five Years would make its way to Broadway. To have Nick and Adrienne taking on these roles is a composer’s dream come true, and to have Whitney’s extraordinary guidance and vision is the hope of every playwright. It has taken 25 years, but the time is right.”\n\nAdditional information about the production including the creative team and venue will be announced later in the year."
