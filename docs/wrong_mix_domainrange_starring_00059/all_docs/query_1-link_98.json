        "text": "With this year being been such a slog to get through, the common rules of holiday etiquette are out the window. Halloween is gone, leaves are falling off the trees, and there's a crisp breeze in the air. (Aside: if this isn't happening for you, I'm sorry. Global warming, man.) All of that is more than enough evidence that the window for holiday content is open—cue: Netflix's new and breezy to watch, Dash & Lily.\n\nDash & Lily is the most saccharine Christmas content available right now. The series follows Dash, a teenage boy who has become jaded by the throes of youth and thus, has given up on Christmas. Sad! Lily is a teenage girl who only befriends adults and seems to only communicate with her brother while he's having sex with his partner Benny. Also sad! But the premise is that, with a game and a little bit of Christmas magic, they might just fall in love with each other without ever meeting.\n\nAnyway, as you're watching the series, you might be curious if you've ever seen these twenty-somethings masquerading as high school-aged adolescents. Chances are, they've graced your screen before.\n\nAustin Abrams as Dash\n\nAustin Abrams as Dash\n\nAbrams got his first major break in film in 2015, playing Ben Starling in the indie film Paper Towns. In terms of film, he hasn't been in any other major releases, except for his role in 2019's Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark. If neither of those jump out as obvious ringers, perhaps you've seen his other television work. Over the past few years, Abrams has had prominent recurring roles in The Walking Dead, The Americans, This is Us, and Euphoria.\n\nMidori Francis as Lily\n\nMidoria Francis as Lily\n\nWhile Abrams is more of a television guy, you've likely had more luck seeing Francis on the big screen than on television. While Francis had a guest spot on Younger, the critically acclaimed TV Land series, her past few years has been dotted with film appearances in 2018's Oceans 8 and 2019's Good Boys. The 26-year-old actress has also become well known for her stage work, receiving multiple nominations for her roles in Connected and The Wolves.\n\nDante Brown as Boomer\n\nBuckle up because this is important. Brown starred in last year's horror film masterpiece, Ma, playing Darrell. He's also had recurring roles on Fox's 9-1-1 and the TV series adaptation of Lethal Weapon. The 21-year-old actor has a laundry list of other roles, dating back to 2009.\n\nThe Jonas Brothers as, well, themselves\n\nIt may seem obvious that the Jonas Brothers are... the Jonas Brothers—but the thing that may not be immediately evident is that Dash & Lily is a bit of a pet project for Nick Jonas. While he and his brothers appear as themselves in the series, Nick is a producer on the show, kicking off his foray into producing through his company, Image 32."
