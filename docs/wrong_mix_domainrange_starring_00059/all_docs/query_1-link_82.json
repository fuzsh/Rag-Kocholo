        "text": "\"Boone is very intense. He's got a lot under the surface that you don't see at first, and it all unravels as the show goes on,\" Jonas told \"Entertainment Tonight\" at the show's premiere Monday night. \"For Boone, in particular, and this show as a whole, everything is not as it seems. So I would say get ready to be surprised by a lot of different things. In his heart of hearts, that may be who he is, but we’ll have to find out as we watch. I’ve been so honored to play some really strong gay characters... and just whatever I can do for the community is a blessing for me.\"\n\n“I’ve really been trying to make an effort to talk with my gay fan base and find unique opportunities to set up the next chapter of my life and my career with them in it,” he told Buzzfeed. “The attitude I take in the stories I want to share and my personal life and my view is that I think we’re in a time where there’s a new progression. For all people of all walks of life to accept all people… I’d be thrilled if I’m any part of that.”"
