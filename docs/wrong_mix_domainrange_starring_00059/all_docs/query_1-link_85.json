        "text": "I'm Nick Jonas and this is everything I do In A Day.\n\n[soothing music]\n\n[bell rings] I wake up anytime\n\nfrom around six a.m. to about six p.m.\n\nIf it's a six a.m. kind of day,\n\nusually I'm awoken by my alarm, which I set two alarms:\n\none at the time I need to be up,\n\nand one three minutes after the time I need to be up.\n\nThe sound of the alarm is what wakes me up in the morning.\n\nMusic is too soothing.\n\nI listen to music, actually, while I'm sleeping.\n\nMax Richter, Sleep songs.\n\nGreat album.\n\nMy most listened album on Spotify, actually,\n\n'cause I listen to it every night.\n\nI have pretty vivid dreams\n\nand then I like to go and look up what they mean.\n\nSo most of my first Google searches of the day are\n\nwhat does this dream mean?\n\nWas I dreaming about an organ?\n\nNot an organ in the body\n\nbut a musical organ. [organ music]\n\nI'm sorta like a spring-outta-bed kinda guy.\n\nI run right into the bathroom, use the restroom,\n\nand then look in the mirror, and look at the damage.\n\nI take into account all of what happened the day before,\n\nthe night before, and see how this affected my general face.\n\nI brush my teeth first.\n\nNot a lot of people do this in the morning,\n\nand we can tell.\n\nMake sure you do that, please.\n\nI take about 12 1/2 minutes in the shower.\n\nSome days, I'm running behind, it's more like 2 1/2.\n\nI apply some moisturizing facial cream\n\nthat also has caffeine in it.\n\nSo it awakes the skin and it's soothing, too.\n\nIt's a cooling cream.\n\nI then take a similar eye roller,\n\nand I go like this under each eye,\n\nand then I do just the corners up here.\n\nFollowing that, I will apply lip balm.\n\nI then take my cologne,\n\nand do a spritz here, a spritz here,\n\nand a spritz in the center\n\nso that I can reapply after my clothes are on.\n\nFollowing that, the first thing I do\n\nis I dry off the remaining parts of my body\n\nthat are potentially still wet.\n\nI blow dry my hair.\n\nAnd then once that's done, I take my ring off.\n\nI don't like the hair product in the ring.\n\nI pull the product out.\n\nFirst, I'll get forward with it,\n\nand then up with it, and then like that,\n\nand then I exit the bathroom.\n\nI then grab some underwear,\n\npreferably clean underwear, then put on some socks.\n\nIt's either no-show socks,\n\nthose, no-shows,\n\nor it's long socks.\n\nAnd if I put the long socks on\n\nand I realize I should have been wearing short socks,\n\nI get really frustrated.\n\nAnd I have to then get back in bed, reset the alarm,\n\nand just wait 'til the next day to get it right.\n\nSo basically, socks are the most important part of my day.\n\nI sometimes turn on SportsCenter\n\nand I'll watch the highlights.\n\nI'll get the Top 10 in.\n\nI love when there's a quirky Top 10 play,\n\nsomething about like a penguin kicking a soccer ball,\n\nor it usually has to do with a cat running\n\non the baseball field.\n\nThat's the kinda content I'm into.\n\nIf I don't find it on SportsCenter, I go to my feed.\n\nAnd I look through there\n\nlooking for a funny cat video or dog video.\n\nMy Instagram feed is an important part of my day.\n\nProbably lying if I said it's not one of the first things\n\nI look at in the morning.\n\nAnd then, emails.\n\nI have a lot more junk emails than important emails.\n\nI also have a dog now which is new,\n\nso in some cases, I will sacrifice my morning television\n\nor Instagram feed time to try and stitch up\n\nwhatever pillow he's decided to destroy that morning\n\nor clean up whatever accident he's had in the house,\n\nthe joys of being a dog owner.\n\nThe gym for me is either in the morning,\n\nwhile I'm fasting,\n\nor I'll work out in the afternoon if there's a window.\n\nAnd in that case, it's usually some kind of sport\n\nor physical activity where it's a workout\n\nbut combined with something that I really enjoy.\n\nSo that can be anything from golfing,\n\nplaying some baseball,\n\nkicking a ball around backstage at the venue,\n\nor playing tennis.\n\nI really like tennis.\n\nAnd then I either make myself a cup of coffee\n\nor I go to the nearest Starbucks, politely ask the barista,\n\nmay I have an iced Americano,\n\nor potentially a hot Americano,\n\ndepending on the season and the temperature,\n\nor if I feel like mixing things up,\n\nI might do a cappuccino.\n\nAfter the coffee, I get into some kind of vehicle,\n\nand I drive to a location.\n\nThe location can be anything\n\nfrom a recording studio or a meeting.\n\nIn one of these scenarios,\n\nI'm in the car and I'm drinking the coffee\n\nand I'm listening to a musical theater show.\n\nI like listening to musical theater in the morning\n\n'cause it makes me feel at peace and inspired.\n\nI will finish the coffee\n\nand look at my watch over and over again\n\nto think about when my intermittent fast will be over.\n\nI will then think about what I'm going to have for food.\n\nAnd in most cases, it's some kind of greens with a protein,\n\nand I'll think about that for four hours.\n\n[clock rustling]\n\nAnd then lunch usually comes at about 12:30, 12:45.\n\nAnd I eat the boring meal that I've allowed myself to eat\n\nthinking about how much better an Italian hero with turkey,\n\nwith ham, salami, lettuce, pickles, olives, oil and vinegar,\n\nand a bit of oregano would have been.\n\nAnd I think about that until dinner comes\n\nand I still don't eat the meal that I wanted to eat.\n\nI eat this other shitty meal\n\nthat I'll feel better about in the morning.\n\nImmediately, after lunch,\n\nI will, most times, go back onto my phone and call someone.\n\nThe priority list is my wife,\n\nobviously, if I'm not with her,\n\none of my brothers, probably my little brother\n\nthat I don't see that much, or my parents.\n\nAnd then after that,\n\nthis is the real exciting part of the day,\n\nI get to the venue.\n\nIt's a show day.\n\nI sit down and I have,\n\nwaiting for me in my dressing room, two things:\n\na bunch of posters that I have to sign that day,\n\nand it ranges from 50 to 1,000 posters,\n\ndepending on the day,\n\nwhich pretty heavy workload.\n\nBut then next to that is a little treat\n\nand it's ants on a log:\n\ncelery, almond butter, raisins.\n\nAnd I eat about six of those\n\nwhich takes me about 4 1/2 minutes.\n\nAnd at this point, I will make myself a drink\n\nand it's either going to be Villa One reposado\n\nwith a little club soda and an orange wedge,\n\nor I'll drink a cold and refreshing Coors light,\n\nsort of a combination of my childhood,\n\nmemories of my childhood with an ants on a log,\n\nand adult things.\n\nAnd then I just go and I meet a lot of people.\n\nWe have meet-and-greets,\n\nand I meet like 400 people, maybe,\n\nand I say, hello, how are you?\n\nThanks so much for coming.\n\nI hope you enjoy the show.\n\nLet's take a picture.\n\nThey leave and we do that about 450 times.\n\nI have dinner just after the meet-and-greet.\n\nSo I come back to the room\n\nand usually, it's a grilled chicken, some vegetables,\n\nmaybe a little brown rice,\n\nor it will be a salmon or something.\n\nAnd there are times,\n\nand this is mostly on days off, where I indulge.\n\nIn those cases, I'll have a chicken Parmesan,\n\nor gnocchi pesto, Indian food.\n\nI love Indian food and Greek food.\n\nPizza.\n\nI love all food basically.\n\nThis point, I turn on some Bollywood hits,\n\nand I listen very loud.\n\nI get loose, a couple dance moves,\n\nand find that the energy of the music,\n\nthe drums, everything really inspires me\n\nand gets me excited.\n\nI will then, at times, post one of these.\n\nI'll be doing a dance and getting ready for the show.\n\nSo I get back to my room, I change into my show threads.\n\nLouis Vuitton is the designer I work with\n\nfor this part of the tour,\n\nso I throw that on.\n\nI then reapply the hydrating gel awakening cream\n\nboth to my face and to my under eyes.\n\nI do another spritz of cologne.\n\nI put my in-ear monitors in,\n\nI do one more dance\n\nto one of the Bollywood songs I'm playing.\n\nI walk to the prayer circle.\n\nWe say a prayer or give thanks to a higher power.\n\nSo everyone speaks from their heart\n\nabout what they're thankful for and shows gratitude.\n\nWe then say this thing where we go,\n\nwhen does happiness begin?\n\nAnd we say, right now,\n\nand then we walk to the stage.\n\nAnd at this point,\n\nI will walk into my little cubby under the stage\n\nand I will apply this throat spray,\n\nthat's sort of is like a glycerine for your throat.\n\nIt makes you feel really good.\n\nI walk up to this platform\n\nwhich then lifts up in the air.\n\nI give a couple fist bumps to people,\n\nand we do the show.\n\nPost-show, I get in the car.\n\nI think about the fans,\n\nhow grateful I am that they are with us\n\nand still with us,\n\nand then I play this game with my brothers\n\nwhich I invented called Toronto.\n\nIt's a fun dice game and it's very simple.\n\nOne day, I will share it with the world the rules,\n\nbut it's not quite there yet,\n\nso you'll thank me once you play this game.\n\nAnd then, I like to go out.\n\nI'm a very social butterfly.\n\nSpend a lot of time with my brothers, obviously,\n\nbut outside of that,\n\nlots of friends here in L.A. and New York\n\nthat I like to spend time with, and of course, Priya.\n\nMy family has grown quite a bit.\n\nPriyanka's family will come\n\nand cook great Indian Food for us as well\n\nso it's really nice,\n\nespecially if we're in the Northeast.\n\nMy routine when my wife is around\n\nis far more interesting and better.\n\nMy life is more enriched, my life is better as a whole.\n\nI get home, we have some time,\n\nwe'll put on a movie,\n\nmaybe a Netflix show that we're watching.\n\nWe got our dogs now so some cuddle time is important.\n\nIf I'm not with Priyanka,\n\nI will call her for sure and say,\n\nthis is all what happened today.\n\nAt this point, I will have get back to my room,\n\nwhether I'm at home or in a hotel,\n\nput SportsCenter back on hoping for some more funny content.\n\nIf there's not that,\n\nif it's more Lebron James highlights,\n\nI go, cool, that was just like yesterday.\n\nBefore I go to bed, I will wash my face,\n\nI will apply, yes, ultra moisturizing cream,\n\nand sometimes even the Tom Ford serum.\n\nIt's just a simple oily serum\n\nwhich is really nice to rejuvenate the skin.\n\nI will brush my teeth for approximately 70 seconds,\n\ndo a little spit spit, rinse, reapply the lip moisture.\n\nMy bed attire is basically just my boxer briefs,\n\nand that's it.\n\nI get really warm when I sleep so I have to keep it light.\n\nBasically, I plug my phone in\n\nand I sleep starting on the left side,\n\nand then by the time I wake up,\n\nI'm usually on my right side.\n\nBut I sleep very well.\n\nI sleep hard.\n\nIt takes a lot to wake me up.\n\nAnd I repeat this everyday.\n\nThis is my existence."
