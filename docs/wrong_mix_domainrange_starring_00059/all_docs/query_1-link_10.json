        "text": "Nick Jonas\n\nDespite not landing a role in the upcoming movie adaptation of Wicked, Nick Jonas is still “very happy” with how his audition went.\n\nThe two-part adaptation of the Broadway play will release its first part next year, with Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo taking on the roles of Glinda, the Good With of the South, and Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West, respectively.\n\nNick and his brother Joe Jonas both tried out for the part of Fiyero, although neither managed to secure a place in the cast.\n\n“Joe and I both went out, and we didn’t get it,” Nick told Variety. “But that’s the life of an actor.\n\n“I think it went really well. I was very happy coming out of the room. I’m a huge fan of the show, and that’s a role I always thought it would be fun to play.”\n\nInstead, Bridgerton heartthrob Jonathan Bailey bagged the role of Fiyero – and Nick voiced his support over the decision.\n\nJonathan Bailey\n\nHe added: “I think Jonathan is going to do a great job, and I’m sure the movie is going to be great.”\n\nWicked will also star Jeff Goldblum, Oscar winner Michelle Yeoh and Ethan Slater. It’s been confirmed that the first part of the film will be released in November 2024.\n\nIn April, director Jon M Chu teased a glimpse of Cynthia and Ariana in action.\n\nSharing the first look at the upcoming movie, he tweeted: “You weren’t told the whole story. What happens when you veer off the Yellow Brick Road?”\n\nBased on Gregory Maguire’s 1995 book, Wicked is a reimagining of The Wizard Of Oz that tells the story from Elphaba’s perspective.\n\nThe musical debuted in 2003 and is currently Broadway’s fifth longest-running show.\n\nMORE FILM NEWS:"
