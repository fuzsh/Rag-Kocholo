        "text": "Nick Jonas and Adrienne Warren will star in The Last Five Years on Broadway in spring 2025.\n\nThe revival of the musical, which features a score and book by Jason Robert Brown, will be directed by Whitney White, a Tony Award nominee for Jaja’s African Hair Braiding. The production will play the Hudson Theatre starting March 18, 2025, for an opening night on April 6, for a limited 14-week run.\n\nWhile The Last Five Years premiered in 2001, had Off-Broadway runs in 2002 and 2013 and a film adaptation, this will be the first time the musical has appeared on Broadway.\n\nThe Last Five Years follows two New Yorkers, aspiring author Jamie and aspiring actress Cathy, as they each narrate the ups and downs for their romantic relationship over the past five years, starting on opposite sides of the timeline.\n\n“I have always believed that when the time was right, The Last Five Years would make its way to Broadway. To have Nick and Adrienne taking on these roles is a composer’s dream come true, and to have Whitney’s extraordinary guidance and vision is the hope of every playwright. It has taken twenty-five years, but the time is right,” Brown said.\n\nIn addition to his career with the Jonas Brothers, Jonas has appeared on Broadway in How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, replacing Daniel Radcliffe for a run in 2012. He also performed on Broadway as a child, appearing in Les Misérables, Beauty and the Beast and Annie Get Your Gun. The Jonas Brothers launched a new tour in 2023, which included stops on Broadway, and is set to continue through 2024.\n\nWarren is a Tony Award winner for her portrayal of Tina Turner in Tina: The Tina Turner Musical. She was Tony-nominated for her role in the 2016 musical Shuffle Along, opposite Audra McDonald, and made her Broadway debut in the 2012 musical Bring It On. She has also appeared in several film and TV projects, including Rustin and The Woman King, the Hulu limited series Black Cake and the ABC limited series Women of the Movement.\n\nThe revival is produced by Seaview, ATG Productions and the Season."
