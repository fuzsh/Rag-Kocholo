        "text": "Andrew Neel’s upcoming fraternity hazing thriller Goat finds Nick Jonas in a role that is a far cry from his upbeat pop star persona. Based on the 2004 memoir of the same name, the film tells the story of Brad Land (Ben Schnetzer), a 19-year-old college freshman intent on pledging Phi Sigma Mu — the same fraternity as his older brother Brett (Jonas) — only to find that the process is much darker than expected.\n\nIn a new trailer released Wednesday by MTV, Brad and his fellow pledges find themselves repeatedly subjected to both violent and demoralizing hazing rituals — from forced drinking to physical abuse — as Brett struggles to reconcile himself with his brothers’ treatment of his sibling.\n\nThe movie also features a cameo by producer James Franco, who plays a Phi Sig alum unable to let go of his glory days.\n\nWatch the full trailer below."
