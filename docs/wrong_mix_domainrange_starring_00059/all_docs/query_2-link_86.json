        "text": "PS: So, Scream Queens is premiering in the Fall. Are there any new details you can give us about your character?\n\nNJ: I'm kind of sworn to secrecy. But it's something I'm really excited to be a part of. I think it's going to be the kind of show that has a real cultural impact. Ryan Murphy is just amazing with his projects, and this is no exception. About my character specifically? I think just be ready to be surprised.\n\nPS: I actually wrote down this quote Ryan Murphy said recently, regarding your character: \"He's not who he seems to be.\" It's a really intriguing thing to say about someone.\n\nNJ: It is! So when you see the beginning, it may not be the reality. Just keep your wits about you.\n\nPS: It's funny, though, because now we're already going to be hyperfocused on him. Maybe he's throwing us off someone else's scent?\n\nNJ: Maybe! You never know. There's a lot of stuff happening in that show; I can't even keep up.\n\nPS: I mean, it hasn't even started yet, and I can't keep up. [Both laugh.]\n\nPS: So are you a horror fan?\n\nNJ: Kind of. I'm not, to be honest, a huge scary movie fan. But I think the thing that's great about this show is, it's kind of more in that slasher vibe. Like some of those iconic movies from the '80s. But I'm not the biggest fan — that's not the first thing I choose. The thing that I was most drawn to about this project was the comedy, and I think you'll see when you see my character. It's very different from the other dramatic serious stuff I've been doing recently — it's very funny stuff.\n\nPS: And you had fun working on it?\n\nNJ: I did! I was working with a couple friends, too. Emma is great; I've known her for forever and got to know some of the other girls, Abigail [Breslin]. And this guy Glen Powell is on the show, too. He's kind of my roommate and best friend. It's a really great cast. I'm thrilled to be a part of it.\n\nPS: Do you feel like you've got a little bit of the college experience just by working on it?\n\nNJ: Kind of. [Laughs.] It's a very different college experience than I would imagine.\n\nPS: Are you hoping that you'll get to be on American Horror Story too? Or is that too far in the scary realm for you?\n\nNJ: I kind of like being on a different thing — obviously American Horror Story is an incredible show and kind of iconic at this point. But I like kind of setting up something new.\n\nPS: Right! Ryan has said it's a little different than American Horror Story, because the survivors of this season move on to the next season. Right?\n\nNJ: Yeah, that's what I hear. I don't know too much about any of it. It's all up in the air. He's the creative genius behind all of it.\n\nPS: So, if you do survive, you would want to go on?\n\nNJ: Yeah, I mean I would be thrilled."
