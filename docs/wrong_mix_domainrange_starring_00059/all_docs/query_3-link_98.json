        "text": "\"Goat,\" which hit theaters and video-on-demand services Friday, filmed at University of Cincinnati. Xavier University, too.\n\nBut when star Nick Jonas needed to prepare for his frat-bro role in the drama, he didn't go bar-hopping with some Bearcats or Musketeers.\n\nHe did that in Bowling Green.\n\nWhen Jonas performed at Bowling Green State University in April 2015, the 24-year-old asked the crowd where he should grab a drink afterward, according to the LA Times.\n\nJonas, a singer and actor, never attended college, so the night turned into research for the role.\n\n\"It was a wild night,”Jonas told the LA Times. “Shots. Smirnoff Ice. You ever been Iced? It’s a game that you play where someone surprises you with a Smirnoff Ice and you have to chug it on one knee. It happened to me three times.”\n\nHe told a similar tale to Billboard magazine about his time in Bowling Green. \"I went out to a college bar and had a really unique experience that I can't really remember, but I know I didn't do anything too stupid,\" he told the music publication. \"I just had too may shots of tequila, which became a good training ground for the movie as well, I think.\"\n\nHis hangover was worth it: Jonas's turn has garnered wide critical praise. \"Goat,\" which debuted at Sundance Film Festival, has a 75 percent rating on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes. It opened in 20 theaters around the U.S. Friday (You can watch, rent or buy it on iTunes, too.).\n\n\"Goat\" centers on the hazing of fraternity pledges and the relationship of two brothers, played by Jonas and Ben Schnetzer, caught up in a week of horrifying rituals.\n\nThe adaptation of Brad Land's memoir is set at the fictional Brookman University. There are traces of the real Queen City, however, including shots of local campuses and the Ohio River.\n\nJonas also works with a Cincinnati co-star in the first scene of the film. He shotguns a can of Over-the-Rhine's Rhinegeist Cougar. The characters drink from Rhinegeist cans and Cincinnati-brewed Christian Moerlein Brewing Co. bottles throughout the film (And Rhinegeist kegs, of course.).\n\nKiller Films produced \"Goat,\" as well as Academy Award nominee \"Carol.\" They are currently producing \"Mercy\" here now, starring Ellen Page and Kate Mara.\n\nJames Franco appears in \"Goat,\" and also worked as a producer with Rabbit Bandini Productions and Killer Films.\n\nThe actor, producer and director filmed \"The Long Home\" around the same time as \"Goat\" in Greater Cincinnati.\n\nThe adaptation of the William Gay novel, also starring Josh Hutcherson and Ashton Kutcher, does not have a specific release date. That's now listed as 2017."
