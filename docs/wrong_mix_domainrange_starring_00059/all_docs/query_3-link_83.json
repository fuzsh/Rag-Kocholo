        "text": "Now that their world tour is over, the Jonas Brothers have returned to their side quests. Kevin is off preparing for the second season of his nepo baby reality series Claim to Fame, while Nick jetted over to France for a special performance at amfAR’s Cannes Film Festival Gala. His appearance doubled as a side quest within a side quest for Joe, who surprised the audience when he joined his younger brother on stage to perform DNCE’s “Cake by the Ocean.”\n\nThroughout Nick’s performance — during which he performed his popular solo single “Jealous” and a cover of Frankie Valli’s “Can’t Take My Eyes Off You” — Joe watched on from the audience while he waited for his cue to join. “Make a path for him to make his way,” he told the crowd, as captured in a video by Diplo, who was on standby to hand the mic off. “Joe where you at? Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Joe Jonas.”\n\nThe gala also featured a special performance from Cher, who packed her set with “Believe” and “If I Could Turn Back Time,” as well as covers of ABBA’s “Waterloo” and Marc Cohn’s “Walking in Memphis.” The singer had joked to the audience, “I thought you guys would be drunk, but obviously you’re not.”\n\nTrending\n\nShe also shared a brief anecdote about her many years in the music industry before performing “Believe,” saying: “I was dropped by my record company and one day, my manager who was my best friend came in and said, ‘You know, my self-esteem is too sewn up in your talent and I don’t need you anymore.’ I was thinking, ‘Fuck me!’ So, then, I was like, ‘I don’t know what to do.’ A man from England said, ‘I still believe in you, come here! I got a song for you to sing and we’ll see what happens.’ And this is what it was.”"
