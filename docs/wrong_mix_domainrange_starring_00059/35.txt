I just finished watching Kingdom and thought Nick Jonas did a great job in that show. I also remember that he played a much different character in Scream Queens and was entertaining in that.

He's had supporting roles in #1 films such as the Jumanji franchise and Midway. He's already racked up more #1s than fellow former Disney star/boybander Justin Timberlake, who gets lead roles left, right, and center.

However, Nick's never been the main star in any of his films that were given a wide release in theaters. Do you think he could star as the main lead in a box office hit?

His upcoming films are the Amazon Studios buddy comedy Foreign Relations (which might go straight to Prime Video) with his former Scream Queens costar Glen Powell and Jersey Boys Live! (which might just air on TV like Hairspray Live! and Grease Live!)
