In the shallow waters just offshore, a dozen or so dark figures bobbed, clinging to their buoyant, waterproof haversacks like survivors of a shipwreck. The freak storm had caught the men unawares but was good; it provided better cover than they could have hoped for.\n\nFrom the beach, a pinpoint of red light flashed on and off twice, a signal from the advance team that it was safe to land. Safe! What did that mean? That this particular stretch of Tunisian coastline was left undefended by the Garde Nationale? Nature’s assault seemed far more punishing than anything the Tunisian coast guard could attempt.\n\nTossed and buffeted about by the heaving swells, the men made their way toward the beach, and in one coordinated movement clambered silently onto the sand by the ruins of the ancient Punic ports. Stripping off their black rubber dry suits to reveal dark clothing and blackened faces, they removed their weapons from their haversacks and began distributing their arsenal: Heckler & Koch MP-10 submachine guns, Kalashnikovs, and sniper rifles. Behind them, others now came ashore in waves.\n\nEverything was precisely orchestrated by the man who had trained them so exhaustively, so tirelessly, for the last months. They were Al-Nahda freedom fighters, natives of Tunisia come to free their country from the oppressors. But their leaders were foreigners—skilled terrorists who also shared their faith in Allah, a small, elite cell of freedom fighters drawn from the most radical wing of Hezbollah.\n\nThe leader of this cell, and of the fifty or so Tunisians, was the master terrorist known only as Abu. Occasionally his full nom de guerre was used: Abu Intiquab. The father of revenge.\n\nElusive, secretive, and ferocious, Abu had trained the Al-Nahda fighters at the Libyan camp outside of Zuwarah. He refined their strategy on a full-scale model of the presidential palace and instructed them in tactics both more violent and more devious than anything they were used to.\n\nBarely thirty hours ago, at the port of Zuwarah, the men had boarded a five-thousand-ton, Russian-built break-bulk freighter, a cargo ship that normally hauled Tunisian textiles and Libyan manufactured goods between Tripoli and Bizerte in Tunisia. The powerful old freighter, now battered and decrepit, had traveled north-northwest along the Tunisian coast, past the port cities of Sfax and Sousse, then swung around Cap Bon and entered the Golfe de Tunis, just past the naval base at La Goulette. Alerted to the schedule of the coast guard patrol boats, the men had dropped anchor five miles from the Carthage coast and swiftly launched their rigid-hulled inflatables, equipped with powerful outboard motors. Within minutes, they had entered the turbulent waters of Carthage, the ancient Phoenician city so powerful in the fifth century B.C. that it was considered Rome’s great rival. If anyone in the Tunisian coast guard happened to be monitoring the ship on radar, he would see only a freighter pausing momentarily, then heading on toward Bizerte.\n\nOn the shore, the man who had flashed the red signal was hissing orders and cursing in a low voice with unquestioned authority. He was a bearded man in a military-issue rain anorak worn over a keffiyeh. Abu.\n\n\"Quiet! Keep it down! What do you want, to bring out the whole godforsaken Tunisian Garde? Quickly, now. Let’s move it, move it! Clumsy fools! Your leader rots in jail while you dawdle! The trucks are waiting!\"\n\nNext to him stood a man wearing night-vision goggles and silently scanning the terrain. The Tunisians knew him only as the Technician. One of Hezbollah’s top munitions experts, he was a handsome, olive-skinned man with heavy brows and flashing brown eyes. As little as the men knew about Abu, they knew even less about the Technician, Abu’s trusted adviser. According to rumor, he was born to wealthy Syrian parents and raised in Damascus and London, where he was schooled in the intricacies of arms and explosives.\n\nFinally the Technician spoke, quietly and calmly. He pulled his black, hooded waterproof garment tight against the torrential rain.\n\nI hesitate to say it, my brother, but the operation is going smoothly. The trucks loaded with matériel were concealed just as we had arranged and the soldiers encountered no resistance on the short drive along the Avenue Habib Borguiga. Now we have just received the radio signal from the first men—they have reached the presidential palace. The coup d’etat has begun. As he spoke he consulted his wristwatch.\n\nAbu nodded imperiously. He was a man who expected nothing less than success. A distant series of explosions told Abu and his adviser that the battle was under way. The presidential palace would be seized imminently, and in a matter of hours, the Islamic militants would control Tunis. Let us not congratulate ourselves prematurely, Abu said in a low, tense voice. The rain was letting up now, and in a moment the storm passed just as suddenly as it had appeared.\n\nSuddenly the silence on the beach was shattered by voices shouting at them in strident, high-pitched Arabic. Dark figures raced across the sand. Abu and the Technician tensed and reached for their weapons, but then saw it was their Hezbollah brethren.\n\nA zero-one!\n\n\"An ambush!\"\n\n\"My God! Mighty Allah, they’re surrounded!\"\n\nFour Arab men approached, looking frightened and out of breath. A zero-one distress signal, panted the one carrying a PRC-117 field radio on his back. They were able to transmit only that they were surrounded by the security forces at the palace and taken captive. Then the transmission was killed! They say they were set up!\n\nAbu turned to his adviser in alarm. How can this be?\n\nThe youngest of the four young men who stood before them said, \"The matériel left for the men—the antitank weapons, the ammunition, the C-4—all of it was defective! Nothing worked! And the government forces were lying in wait for them! Our men were set up from the beginning!\"\n\nAbu looked visibly pained, his customary serenity vanished. He beckoned his number-one adviser. \"Ya sahbee, I need your wise counsel.\"\n\nThe Technician adjusted his wristwatch as he came close to the master terrorist. Abu put one arm around his adviser’s shoulders. He spoke in a low, calm voice. There must be a traitor in our ranks, an infiltrator. Our plans were leaked.\n\nAbu made a subtle, almost undetectable gesture with a finger and thumb. It was a cue, and his followers immediately grabbed the Technician by the arms, legs, and shoulders. The Technician struggled mightily, but he was no match for the trained terrorists who held him. Swiftly, Abu’s right hand shot out. There was a flash of metal and Abu plunged a serrated, hooked knife into the Technician’s abdomen, yanking the blade down and then out to inflict the maximum damage. Abu’s eyes were blazing. \"The traitor is you!\" he spat out.\n\nThe Technician gasped. The pain was obviously excruciating, but his face remained a stolid mask. No, Abu! he protested.\n\nPig! spat Abu, lunging at him again, his serrated knife aimed at the Technician’s groin. \"No one else knew the timing, the exact plans! No one! And you were the one who certified the matériel. It can be no one else.\"\n\nSuddenly the beach was flooded with blindingly bright carbon-arc light. Abu turned and realized that they were surrounded and vastly outnumbered by dozens upon dozens of soldiers in khaki uniforms. The Groupement de Commando of the Tunisian Garde Nationale, machine guns pointed, had abruptly appeared from over the horizon; a thundering racket from above announced the arrival of several attack helicopters.\n\nBursts of automatic gunfire hit Abu’s men, turning them into jerking marionettes. Their bloodcurdling screams were abruptly silenced, and their bodies toppled to the ground in strange and awkward positions. Another burst of gunfire, and then it stopped. The unexpected silence that followed was eerie. Only the master terrorist and his munitions specialist had not been fired upon.\n\nBut Abu seemed to have only one focus of attention, and he spun back around to the man he had branded a traitor, positioning his scimitar-shaped blade for another attack. Badly wounded, the Technician tried to ward off his assailant, but instead began to sink to the ground. The loss of blood was too great. Just as Abu lunged forward to finish him off, powerful hands grabbed the bearded Hezbollah leader from behind, slamming him down and pinning him to the sand.\n\nAbu’s eyes burned with defiance as the two were taken into custody by the government soldiers. He did not fear any government. Governments were cowards, he had often said; governments would release him under some pretext of international law and extradition and repatriation. Deals would be struck behind the scenes, and Abu would be quietly released, his presence in the country a carefully kept secret. No government wanted to bring on itself the full fury of a Hezbollah terror campaign.\n\nThe terrorist master did not struggle, but instead caused his body to go slack, forcing the soldiers to drag him away. As he was dragged past the Technician, he spat full in his face and hissed, \"You are not long for this world, traitor! Pig! You will die for your treachery!\"\n\nOnce Abu was taken away, the several men who had grabbed the Technician gently released him, easing him down onto a waiting stretcher. Obeying the instructions of the battalion captain, they backed away as the captain approached. The Tunisian knelt beside the Technician and examined his wound. The Technician winced but uttered not a sound.\n\nMy God, it’s a wonder you’re still conscious! said the captain in heavily accented English. You have been badly injured. You have lost a great deal of blood.\n\nThe man who had been known as the Technician replied, If your men had responded to my signal a little more speedily, this wouldn’t have happened. He instinctively touched his wristwatch, which was equipped with a miniaturized high-frequency transmitter.\n\nThe captain ignored the barb. That SA-341 up there, he said, pointing up to the sky, where a helicopter hovered, will take you to a high-security government medical facility in Morocco. I’m not permitted to know your real identity, nor who your real employers are, so I won’t ask, the Tunisian began, but I think I have a good idea—\n\nJust then the Technician whispered harshly, \"Get down!\" He quickly pulled a semiautomatic pistol from the holster concealed under his arm and fired off five quick shots. There was a cry from a copse of palm trees, and a dead man toppled to the ground, his sniper rifle clutched in his hand. Somehow an Al-Nahda soldier had escaped the massacre.\n\nMighty Allah! exclaimed the frightened captain of the battalion as he slowly raised his head and looked around. I think we’re even now, you and I.\n\nListen, the Arab-who-was-not-an-Arab said weakly, tell your president his minister of the interior is a secret Al-Nahda sympathizer and collaborator who conspires to take his place. He’s in league with the deputy minister of defense. There are others …\n\nBut the loss of blood had been too great. Before the Technician could finish his sentence, he passed out.\n\nPART ONE\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nFive weeks later\n\nThe patient was conveyed by a chartered jet to a private landing strip twenty miles northwest of Washington, D.C. Although the patient was the only passenger on the entire aircraft, no one spoke to him except to ascertain his immediate needs. No one knew his name. All they knew was that this was clearly an extremely important passenger. The flight’s arrival appeared on no aviation logs anywhere, military or civilian.\n\nThe nameless passenger was then taken by unmarked sedan to downtown Washington and dropped off, at his own request, near a parking garage in the middle of an unremarkable block near Dupont Circle. He wore an unimpressive gray suit with a pair of tasseled cordovan loafers that had been scuffed and shined a few too many times, and looked like one of a thousand midlevel lobbyists and bureaucrats, the faceless, colorless staffers of a permanent Washington.\n\nNobody gave him a second look as he emerged from the parking garage, then walked, stiffly and with a pronounced limp, to a dun-colored, four-story building at 1324 K Street, near Twenty-first. The building, all cement and gray-tinted glass, was scarcely distinguishable from all the other bland, boxy low-rises along this stretch of northwest Washington. These were the offices, invariably, of lobbying groups and trade organizations, travel bureaus and industry boards. Beside its front entrance a couple of brass plaques were mounted, announcing the offices of INNOVATION ENTERPRISES and AMERICAN TRADE INTERNATIONAL.\n\nOnly a trained engineer with highly rarefied expertise might have noticed a few anomalous details—the fact, for example, that every window frame was equipped with a piezoelectric oscillator, rendering futile any attempt at laser-acoustic surveillance from outside. Or the high-frequency white-noise drench that enveloped the building in a cone of radio waves, sufficient to defeat most forms of electronic eavesdropping.\n\nCertainly nothing ever attracted the attention of its K Street neighbors—the balding lawyers at the grains board, the grim-faced accountants in their ties and short-sleeved shirts at the slowly failing business consulting firm. People arrived at 1324 K Street in the morning and left in the evening and trash was deposited in the alley Dumpster on the appropriate days. What else did anybody care to know? But that was how the Directorate liked, to be: hidden in plain view.\n\nThe man almost smiled to himself when he thought about it. For who would ever suspect that the most secretive of the world’s covert agencies would be headquartered in an ordinary-looking office building in the middle of K Street, right out in the open?\n\nThe Central Intelligence Agency in Langley, Virginia, and the National Security Agency in Fort Meade, Maryland, were housed in moated fortresses that proclaimed their existence! Here I am, they seemed to say, right here, pay no attention to me! They virtually dared their opponents to breach their security—as inevitably happened. The Directorate made those so-called clandestine bureaucracies look about as reclusive as the U.S. Postal Service.\n\nThe man stood inside the lobby of 1324 K Street and scanned the sleek brass panel, on which was mounted a perfectly conventional-looking telephone handset beneath a dial pad, from all appearances the sort of arrangement that appears in lobbies in office buildings around the world. The man picked up the handset and then pressed a series of numbers, a predetermined code. He kept his index finger pressed on the last button, the # sign, for a few seconds until he heard a faint ring, signifying that his fingerprint had been electronically scanned, analyzed, matched against a preexisting and precleared database of digitized fingerprints, and approved. Then he listened to the telephone handset as it rang precisely three times. A disembodied, mechanical female voice commanded him to state his business.\n\nI have an appointment with Mr. Mackenzie, said the man. In a matter of seconds his words were converted into bits of data and matched against another database of precleared voiceprints. Only then did a faint buzzing in the lobby indicate that the first inner set of glass doors could be opened. He hung up the telephone receiver and pushed open the heavy, bulletproof glass doors, entered a tiny antechamber, and stood there for a few seconds as his facial features were scanned by three separate high-resolution surveillance cameras and checked against stored, authorized patterns.\n\nThe second set of doors opened onto a small, featureless reception area of white walls and gray industrial carpeting, equipped with hidden monitoring devices that could detect all manner of concealed weapons. On a marble-topped console in one corner, there was a stack of pamphlets emblazoned with the logo of American Trade International, an organization that existed only as a set of legal documents and registrations. The rest of the pamphlets were given over to an unreadable mission statement, filled with platitudes about international trade. An unsmiling guard waved Bryson past, through another set of doors and into a handsomely appointed hall, paneled in dark, burled walnut, where about a dozen clerical types were at their desks. It might have been an upscale art gallery of the sort one might find on Fifty-seventh Street in Manhattan, or perhaps a prosperous law firm.\n\nNick Bryson, my main man! exclaimed Chris Edgecomb, bounding from his seat at a computer monitor. Born in Guyana, he was a lithe, tall man with mocha skin and green eyes. He’d been at the Directorate for four years, working on the communications-and-coordination team; he fielded distress calls, figured out ways to relay information to agents in the field when it was necessary. Edgecomb clasped Bryson’s hand warmly.\n\nNicholas Bryson knew he was something of a hero to people like Edgecomb, who yearned to be field operatives. Join the Directorate and change the world, Edgecomb would joke in his lilting English, and it was Bryson he had in mind when he said it. It was a rare event, Bryson knew, that the office staff saw Bryson face-to-face; for Edgecomb, this was an occasion.\n\nSomebody hurt you? Edgecomb’s expression was sympathetic; he saw a strong man who had been hospitalized until recently. Then he continued hastily, knowing better than to ask questions: I’ll pray to Saint Christopher for you. You’ll be a hundred percent in no time.\n\nThe Directorate’s creed, above all, was segmentation and compartmentalization. No one agent or staffer should ever know enough to be in the position to jeopardize the security of the whole. The organizational chart was shrouded even to a veteran like Bryson. He knew a few of the desk jockeys, of course. But the field personnel all operated in isolation, through their own proprietary networks. If you had to work together, you knew each other only by a field legend, a temporary alias. The rule was more than procedure, it was Holy Writ.\n\nYou’re a good man, Chris, Bryson remarked.\n\nEdgecomb smiled modestly, then pointed a finger upward. He knew Bryson had an appointment—or was it a summons?—with the big man himself, Ted Waller. Bryson smiled, gave Edgecomb a friendly clap on the shoulder, and made his way to the elevator.\n\nDon’t get up, Bryson said heartily as he entered Ted Waller’s third-floor office. Waller did anyway, all six feet, four inches and three hundred pounds of him.\n\nGood Lord, look at you, Waller said, his eyes appraising Bryson with alarm. You look like you came out of a POW camp.\n\nThirty-three days in a U.S. government clinic in Morocco will do that to you, Bryson said. It’s not exactly the Ritz.\n\nPerhaps I should try being gutted by a mad terrorist someday. Waller patted his ample girth. He was even larger than the last time Bryson had seen him, though his avoirdupois was elegantly sheathed in a suit of navy cashmere, his bull neck flattered by the spread collar of one of his Turnbull & Asser shirts. \"Nick, I’ve been tormenting myself since this happened. It was a serrated Verenski blade from Bulgaria, I’m told. Plunge and twist. Terribly low-tech, but it usually does the job. What a business we’re in. Never forget, it’s what you don’t see that always gets you. Waller settled weightily back in the tufted-leather chair behind his oak desk. The early-afternoon sun filtered through the polarized glass behind him. Bryson took a seat in front of him, an unaccustomed formality. Waller, who was normally ruddy and seemingly robust, now looked pallid, the circles under his eyes deep. They say you’ve made, a remarkable recovery.\"\n\nIn a few more weeks, I’ll be as good as new. At least that’s what the doctors tell me. They also say I’ll never need an appendectomy, a side benefit I never thought of. As he spoke, he felt the dull ache in his lower-right abdomen.\n\nWaller nodded distractedly. You know why you’re here?\n\nA kid gets a note to see the principal, he expects a reprimand. Bryson feigned lightheartedness, but his mood was tense, somber.\n\nA reprimand, Waller said enigmatically. He was silent for a moment, his eyes settling on a row of leather-bound books on the shelves near the door. Then he turned back and said in a gentle, pained voice: The Directorate doesn’t exactly post an organizational chart, but I think you have some inkling of the command-and-control structure. Decisions, particularly ones concerning key personnel, do not always stop at my desk. And as important as loyalty is to you and to me—hell, to most of the people in this goddamned ptace—it’s coldhearted pragmatism that rules the day. You know that.\n\nBryson had only had one serious job in his life, and this was it; still, he recognized the undertones of the pink-slip talk. He fought the urge to defend himself, for that was not Directorate procedure; it was unseemly. He recalled one of Waller’s mantras: There’s no such thing as bad luck, then thought of another maxim. All’s well that ends well, Bryson said. And it did end well.\n\nWe almost lost you, Waller said. I almost lost you, he added ruefully, a teacher speaking to a prize student who has disappointed him.\n\nThat’s not pertinent, Bryson said quietly. \"Anyway, you can’t read the rules on the side of the box when you’re in the field; you know that. You taught me that. You improvise, you follow instinct—not just established protocol.\"\n\n\"Losing you could have meant losing Tunisia. There’s a cascade effect: when we intervene, we do so early enough to make a difference. Actions are carefully titrated, reactions calibrated, variables accounted for. And so you nearly compromised quite a few other undercover operations, in Maghreb and other places around the sandbox. You put other lives in jeopardy, Nicky—other operations and other lives. The Technician’s legend was intricately connected to other legends we’d manufactured; you know that. Yet you let your cover get blown. Years of undercover work compromised because of you!\"\n\nNow, wait a second—\n\nGiving them ‘defective munitions’—how did you think they wouldn’t suspect you?\n\n\"Damn it, they weren’t supposed to be defective!\"\n\nBut they were. Why?\n\n\"I don’t know!\"\n\nDid you inspect them?\n\nYes! No! I don’t know. It never crossed my mind that the goods weren’t as they were represented.\n\nThat was a serious lapse, Nicky. You endangered years of work, years of deep-cover planning, cultivation of valuable assets. The lives of some of our most valuable assets! Goddamn it, what were you thinking?\n\nBryson was silent for a moment. I was set up, he said at last.\n\nSet up how?\n\nI can’t say for sure.\n\nIf you were ‘set up,’ that means you were already under suspicion, correct?\n\nI—I don’t know.\n\n\"‘I don’t know’? Not exactly words that inspire confidence, are they? They’re not words I like to hear. You used to be our top field operative. What happened to you, Nick?\"\n\nMaybe—somehow—I screwed up. Don’t you think I’ve gone over it and over it in my mind?\n\nI’m not hearing answers, Nick.\n\n\"Maybe there aren’t any answers—not now, not yet.\"\n\nWe can’t afford such screwups. We can’t tolerate this kind of carelessness. None of us can. We allow for margins of error. But we cannot go beyond them. The Directorate doesn’t tolerate mistakes. You’ve known that since day one.\n\n\"You think there was something I could have done differently? Or maybe you think somebody else could have done it better?\"\n\nYou were the best we ever had, you know that. But as I told you, these decisions are reached at consortium level, not at my desk.\n\nA chill ran through Bryson upon hearing the bureaucratese that told him Waller had already distanced himself from the consequences of the decision to let him go. Ted Waller was Bryson’s mentor, boss, and friend, and, fifteen years ago, his teacher. He had supervised his apprenticeship, briefed him personally before the operations he worked on early in his career. It was an immense honor, and Bryson felt it to this day. Waller was the most brilliant man he’d ever met. He could solve partial differential equations in his head; he possessed vast stores of arcane geopolitical knowledge. At the same time his lumbering frame belied his extraordinary physical dexterity. Bryson recalled him at a shooting range, absently hitting one bull’s-eye after another from seventy feet while chatting about the sad decline of British bespoke tailoring. The .22 looked puny in his large, plump, soft hand; it was so under his control that it might have been another finger.\n\nYou used the past tense, Ted, Bryson said. The implication being that you believe I’ve lost it.\n\nI simply meant what I said, Waller replied quietly. I’ve never worked with anyone better, and I doubt I ever will.\n\nBy temperament and by training, Nick knew how to remain impassive, but now his heart was thudding. You were the best we ever had, Nick. That sounded like an homage, and homage, he knew, was a key element of the ritual of separation. Bryson would never forget Waller’s reaction when he pulled off his first operational hat trick—foiling the assassination of a moderate reform candidate in South America. It was a taciturn Not bad: Waller had pressed his lips together to keep from smiling, and to Nick, it was a greater accolade than any that followed. It’s when they begin to acknowledge how valuable you are, Bryson had learned, that you know they’re putting you out to pasture.\n\n\"Nick, nobody else could have accomplished what you did in the Comoros. The place would have been in the hands of that madman, Colonel Denard. In Sri Lanka, there are probably thousands of people who are alive, on both sides, because of the arms-trading routes you exposed. And what you did in Belarus? The GRU still doesn’t have a clue, and they never will. Leave it to the politicians to color inside the lines, because those are the lines that we’ve drawn, that you’ve drawn. The historians will never know, and the truth is, it’s better that way. But we know that, don’t we?\"\n\nBryson didn’t reply; no reply was called for.\n\nAnd on a separate matter, Nick, noses are out of joint around here about the Banque du Nord business. He was referring to Bryson’s penetration of a Tunis bank that channeled laundered funds to Abu and Hezbollah to fund the coup attempt. One night during the operation more than 1.5 billion dollars simply disappeared, vanished into cyberspace. Months of investigation had failed to account for the missing assets. It was a loose end, and the Directorate disliked loose ends.\n\nYou’re not suggesting that I had my hand in the cookie jar, are you?\n\nOf course not. But you understand that there are always going to be suspicions. When there are no answers, the questions linger; you know that.\n\nI’ve had plenty of opportunities for ‘personal enrichment’ that would have been far more lucrative and considerably more discreet.\n\nYou’ve been tested, yes, and you’ve passed with flying colors. But I question the method of diversion, the monies transferred through false flags to Abu’s colleagues to purchase compromisable background data.\n\nThat’s called improvisation. It’s what you pay me for—using my powers of discretion when and where necessary. Bryson stopped, realizing something. But I was never debriefed about this!\n\nYou offered up the details yourself, Nick, said Waller.\n\n\"I sure as hell never—oh, Christ, it was chemicals, wasn’t it?\"\n\nWaller hesitated a split-second, but just long enough that Bryson’s question was answered. Ted Waller could lie, blithely and easily, when the need dictated, but Bryson knew his old friend and mentor found lying to him distasteful. Where we obtain our information is compartmented, Nick. You know that.\n\nNow he understood the need for such a protracted stay in an American-staffed clinic in Laayoune. Chemicals had to be administered without the subject’s knowledge, preferably injected into the intravenous drip. \"Goddamn it, Ted! What’s the implication—that I couldn’t be trusted to undergo a conventional debriefing, offer the goods up freely? That only a blind interrogation could tell you what you wanted to know? You had to put me under without my knowledge?\"\n\nSometimes the most reliable interrogation is that which is conducted without the subject’s calculation of his own best interest.\n\nMeaning you guys thought that I’d lie to cover my ass?\n\nWaller’s reply was quiet, chilling. \"Once assessments are made that an individual is not one hundred percent trustworthy, contrary assumptions are made, at least provisionally. You detest it, and I detest it, but that’s the brutal fact of an intelligence bureaucracy. Particularly one as reclusive—maybe paranoid is the more accurate word here—as we are.\"\n\nParanoid. In fact, Bryson had learned long ago that to Waller and his colleagues at the Directorate, it was an article of faith that the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and even the National Security Agency were riddled with moles, hamstrung by regulation, and mired in an arms race of disinformation with their hostile counterparts abroad. Waller liked to call these, the agencies whose existence was emblazoned on Congressional appropriations bills and organization charts, the woolly mammoths. In his earliest days with the Directorate, Bryson had innocently asked whether some measure of cooperation with the other agencies didn’t make sense. Waller had laughed. \"You mean, let the woolly mammoths know we exist? Why not just send a press release to Pravda?\" But the crisis of American intelligence, in Waller’s view, went far beyond the problems of penetration. Counterintelligence was the true wilderness of mirrors. You lie to your enemy, and then you spy on them, Waller had once pointed out, and what you learn is the lie. Only now, somehow, the lie has become true, because it’s been recategorized as ‘intelligence.’ It’s like an Easter-egg hunt. How many careers have been made—on either side—by people who have painstakingly unearthed eggs that their colleagues have just as painstakingly buried? Colorful, beautifully painted Easter eggs—but fakes nonetheless.\n\nThe two had sat talking through the night in the below-ground library underneath the K Street headquarters, a chamber furnished with seventeenth-century Kurdish rugs on the floor, old British oil paintings of the hunt, of loyal dogs grasping fowl in their pedigreed mouths.\n\nYou see the genius of it? Waller had gone on. Every CIA adventure, botched or otherwise, will eventually come under public scrutiny. Not so for us, simply because we’re on nobody’s radar. Bryson still remembered the soft rattle of ice cubes in the heavy crystal glass as Waller took a sip of the barrel-proof bourbon he favored.\n\nBut operating off the grid, practically like outlaws, can’t exactly be the most practical way to do business, Bryson had protested. For one thing, there’s the matter of resources.\n\n\"Granted, we don’t have the resources, but then we don’t have the bureaucracy, either, the constraints. All in all, it’s a positive advantage, given our particular purview. Our record is proof of it. When you work in ad hoc fashion with groups around the world, when you don’t shy from extremely aggressive interventions, then all you need is a very small number of highly trained operatives. You take advantage of on-the-ground forces. You succeed by directing events, coordinating the desired outcomes. You don’t need the vast overheads of the spy bureaucracies. All you really need is brains.\"\n\nAnd blood, said Bryson, who had already seen his share of it by then. Blood.\n\nWaller had shrugged. That great monster Joseph Stalin once put it quite aptly: you can’t make an omelet without breaking some eggs. He spoke about the American century, about the burdens of empire. About imperial Britain in the nineteenth century, when Parliament would debate for six months about whether to send an expeditionary force to rescue a general who had been under siege for two years. Waller and his colleagues at the Directorate believed in liberal democracy, fervently and unequivocally—but they also knew that to secure its future, you couldn’t play, as Waller liked to say, by Queensbury rules. If your enemies operated by low cunning, you’d better summon up some good old low cunning of your own. We’re the necessary evil, Waller had told him. \"But don’t ever get cocky—the noun is evil. We’re extra-legal. Unsupervised, unregulated. Sometimes I don’t even feel safe knowing that we’re around.\" There was another soft rattle of ice cubes as he drained the last drops of bourbon from the glass.\n\nNick Bryson had known fanatics—friendlies and hostiles both—and he found comfort in Waller’s very ambivalence. Bryson had never felt he’d fully had the measure of Waller’s mind: the brilliance, the cynicism, but mostly the intense, almost bashful idealism, like sunlight spilling through the edge of drawn blinds. My friend, Waller said, we exist to create a world in which we won’t be necessary.\n\nNow, in the ashy light of the early afternoon, Waller spread his hands on his desk, as if bracing himself for the unpleasant job he had to do. We know you’ve been having a hard time since Elena left, he began.\n\nI don’t want to talk about Elena, Bryson snapped. He could feel a vein throbbing in his forehead. For so many years she had been his wife, best friend, and lover. Six months ago, during a sterile telephone call Bryson had placed from Tripoli, she had told him she was leaving him. Arguing would do no good. She had clearly made up her mind; there was nothing to discuss. Her words had wounded him far worse than Abu’s blade. A few days later, during a scheduled stateside debriefing—disguised as an arms-acquisition trip—Bryson arrived home to find her gone.\n\nListen, Nick, you’ve probably done more good in the world than anybody in intelligence. Waller paused, and then spoke slowly, with great deliberateness. If I let you continue, you’ll start to subtract from what you’ve done.\n\nMaybe I screwed up, Bryson said dully. Once. I’m willing to concede that much. There was no point in arguing, but he couldn’t stop himself.\n\nAnd you’ll screw up again, Waller replied evenly. \"There are things we call ‘sentinel events.’ Early warnings signs. You’ve been extraordinary for fifteen years. Extraordinary. But fifteen years, Nick. For a field agent, those are like dog years. Your focus is wavering. You’re burned out, and the scary thing is, you don’t even know it.\"\n\nWas what happened to his marriage a ‘sentinel event,’ too? As Waller continued to speak in his calm, reasonable, logical way, Bryson felt a rush of different emotions, and one of them was rage. My skills—\n\n\"I’m not talking about your skill set. As far as fieldwork is concerned, there’s nobody better, even now. What I’m talking about is restraint. The ability not to act. That’s what goes first. And you don’t get it back.\"\n\nThen maybe a leave of absence is in order. There was an undertone of desperation in his voice, and Bryson hated himself for it.\n\nThe Directorate doesn’t grant sabbaticals, Waller said dryly. You know that. Nick, you’ve spent a decade and a half making history. Now you can study it. I’m going to give you your life back.\n\nMy life, Bryson repeated colorlessly. \"So you are talking about retirement.\"\n\nWaller leaned back in his chair. Do you know the story of John Wallis, one of the great British spymasters of the seventeenth century? He was a wizard at decrypting Royalist messages for the Parliamentarians in the 1640s. He helped establish the English Black Chamber, the NSA of its time. But when he retired from the business, he used his gifts as professor of geometry at Cambridge, and helped invent modern calculus—helped put modernity on its track. Who was more important—Wallis the spy, or Wallis the scholar? Retiring from the business doesn’t have to mean being put out to pasture.\n\nIt was a vintage Waller rejoinder, an arcane parable; Bryson almost laughed at the absurdity of it all. \"What did you have in mind for me to do? Work as a rent-a-cop at a warehouse, guarding T-beams with a six-shooter and a nightstick?\"\n\n\"‘Integer vitae, scelerisque purus non eget Mauris jaculis, neque arcu, nec venenatis gravida saggittis pharetra.’ The man of integrity, free of sin, doesn’t need the Moorish javelin, nor the bow, nor the heavy quiver of hunting arrows. Horace, as you know. In the event, it’s all arranged. Woodbridge College needs a lecturer in near-eastern history, and they’ve just found a stellar candidate. Your graduate studies and linguistic mastery make you a perfect match.\"\n\nBryson felt eerily detached from himself, the way he sometimes did in the field—floating above the scene, observing everything with a cool and calculating eye. He often thought he might be killed in the field: that was an eventuality he could plan for, take into account. But he had never thought he would be fired. And that it was a beloved mentor who was firing him made it worse—made it personal.\n\nAll part of the retirement plan, Waller continued. \"Idle hands are the devil’s workshop, as they say. Something we’ve learned from hard experience. Give a field agent a lump sum and nothing to do, and he’ll get himself into trouble, as night follows day. You need a project. Something real. And you’re a natural teacher—one of the reasons you were so good in the field.\"\n\nBryson said nothing, trying to dispel a wrenching memory of an operation in a small Latin American province, the memory of looking at a face in the crosshairs of a sniper-scope. The face belonged to one of his students—a kid named Pablo, a nineteen-year-old Amerindian he’d trained in the art of defusing, and deploying, high explosives. A tough but decent kid. His parents were peasants in a hillside village that had just been overtaken by Maoist insurrectionists: if word got out that Pablo was working with their enemies, the guerrillas would kill his parents, and most likely in cruel and inventive ways—that was their signature. The kid wavered, struggled with his loyalties, and decided he had no choice but to cross over: to save his parents, he’d tell the guerrillas all he knew about their adversaries, the names of others who had cooperated with the forces of order. He was a tough kid, a decent kid, caught in a situation where there was no right answer. Bryson peered at Pablo’s face through the scope—the face of a stricken, miserable, frightened young man—and only looked away after he squeezed the trigger.\n\nWaller’s gaze was steady. \"Your name is Jonas Barrett. An independent scholar, the author of half a dozen highly respected articles in peer-reviewed journals. Four of them in the Journal of Byzantine Studies. Team efforts—gave our near-eastern experts something to do in their down time. We do know a thing or two about how to build a civilian legend.\" Waller handed him a folder. It was canary yellow, which signified that the card stock was interlaced with magnetic strips and could not be removed from the premises. It contained a legend—a fictive biography. His biography.\n\nHe skimmed the densely printed pages: they detailed the life of a reclusive scholar whose linguistic capacities matched his, whose expertise could be quickly mastered. The lineaments of his biography were easily assimilated—most of them, that was. Jonas Barrett was unmarried. Jonas Barrett never knew Elena. Jonas Barrett was not in love with Elena. Jonas Barrett did not ache, even now, for Elena’s return. Jonas Barrett was a fiction: for Nick to make him real meant accepting the loss of Elena.\n\nThe appointment went through a few days ago. Woodbridge is expecting their new adjunct lecturer to arrive in September. And, if I may say so, they’re lucky to have him.\n\nI have any choice in the matter?\n\nOh, we could have found you a position at any of a dozen multinational consulting firms. Or perhaps one of the behemoth petroleum or engineering companies. But this one is right for you. You’ve always had a mind that could handle abstractions as easily as facts. I used to worry it would be a handicap, but it turned out to be one of your greatest strengths.\n\n\"And if I don’t want to retire? What if I don’t want to go gently into that good night?\" For some reason, he flashed back on the blur of steel, the sinewy arm plunging the blade toward him … .\n\n\"Don’t, Nick,\" Waller said, his expression opaque.\n\nJesus, Bryson said softly. There was pain in his voice, and Bryson regretted letting it show. Bryson knew how the game was played: what got to him wasn’t the words he had been listening to so much as the man who was speaking them. Waller hadn’t elaborated, hadn’t needed to. Bryson knew he wasn’t being offered a choice, and knew what lay in store for the recalcitrant. The taxicab that swerves suddenly, hits a pedestrian, and disappears. The pinprick a subject may not even feel as he makes his way through a crowded shopping mall, followed by the open-and-shut diagnosis of coronary failure. An ordinary mugging gone awry, in a city that still had one of the highest rates of street crime in the nation.\n\nThis is the line of work that we have chosen, said Waller gently. \"Our responsibility supersedes all bonds of kinship and affection. I wish it were otherwise. You don’t know how much. In my time, I’ve had to … sanction three of my men. Good men gone bad. No, not even bad, just unprofessional. I live with that every day, Nick. But I’d do it again in a heartbeat. Three men. I’m begging you—don’t make it four. Was it a threat? A plea? Both? Waller let his breath out slowly. I’m offering you life, Nick. A very good life.\"\n\nBut what lay ahead for Bryson wasn’t life, not just yet. It was a sort of fugue state, a shadowy half-death. For fifteen years, he had devoted his whole being—every brain cell, every muscle fiber—to a peculiarly hazardous and strenuous endeavor. Now his services would no longer be required. And Bryson felt nothing, just a profound emptiness. He made his way home, to the handsome colonial-style house in Falls Church that barely seemed familiar any longer. He cast his eyes over the house as if it were a stranger’s, taking in the tasteful Aubussons that Elena had picked out, the hopeful pastel-painted room on the second floor for the child they never had. The place was both empty and full of ghosts. Then he poured himself a water tumbler full of vodka. It was the last time he would be fully sober in weeks.\n\nThe house was full of Elena, of her scent, her taste, her aura. He could not forget her.\n\nThey were sitting on the dock in front of their lakeside cabin in Maryland, watching the sailboat … . She poured him a glass of cold white wine, and as she handed it to him she kissed him. I miss you, she said.\n\nBut I’m right here, my darling.\n\nNow you are. Tomorrow you’ll be gone. To Prague, to Sierra Leone, to Jakarta, to Hong Kong … who knows where? And who knows for how long?\n\nHe took her hand, feeling her loneliness, unable to banish it. But I always come back. And you know the expression, Absence makes the heart grow fonder.\n\nMai rãrut, mai drãgut, she said softly, musingly. \"But you know, in my country, they say something else. Celor ce duc mai mult dorul, le pare mai dulce odorul. Absence sharpens love, but presence strengthens it.\"\n\nI like that.\n\nShe raised an index finger, wagged it in his face. \"They also say something else. Prin depãrtare dragostea se uitã. How do you say—long absent, soon forgotten?\"\n\nOut of sight, out of mind.\n\nHow long before you forget me?\n\nBut you’re always with me, my love. He tapped his chest. In here.\n\nHe had no doubt the Directorate had him under electronic surveillance; he hardly cared. If they assessed him as a security risk, they would certainly sanction him. Perhaps with enough vodka, he thought grimly, he might even save them the trouble. Days passed, and he saw and heard from no one. Maybe Waller interceded at consortium level to cut him slack, because he knew it wasn’t just the severance that caused him to fall apart. It was Elena’s departure. Elena, the anchor of his existence. Acquaintances would sometimes say how calm Nick always seemed, but Nick seldom felt calm: calm was what Elena had provided. What was Waller’s phrase for her? A passionate serenity.\n\nNick hadn’t known he was capable of loving somebody as much as he loved her. In the vortex of lies where his career played out, she was his one true thing. At the same time, she too was a spook: she would have had to have been for them to build a life together. In fact, she was cleared almost all the way to the top, because she worked in the Directorate’s cryptography division, and you never knew what sort of thing they’d come across. The typical hostile intercept often contained morsels of intelligence about the United States; decrypting them meant the possibility of being exposed to your own government’s innermost secrets—information most of the agency’s division heads weren’t even cleared for. Analysts like her lived desk-bound lives, the computer keyboard their only weapon, and yet their intellects roamed the world as freely as any field agent.\n\nGod, how he loved her!\n\nIn a sense, Ted Waller had introduced them, though in fact they had met in the least promising of circumstances, a result of an assignment Waller had given him.\n\nIt was a routine package transport, which Directorate insiders sometimes called the coyote run, referring to the smuggling of human beings. The Balkans were on fire in the late 1980s, and a brilliant Romanian mathematician was to be exfiltrated from Bucharest with his wife and daughter. Andrei Petrescu was a true Romanian patriot, an academician at the University of Bucharest specializing in the arcane mathematics of cryptography. He had been pressed into service by Romania’s notorious secret service, the Securitate, to devise the codes used in the innermost circles of the Ceau e9781429993739_img_351.gif escu government. He wrote the cryptographic algorithms, but he refused their offer of employment: he wanted to remain in the academy, a teacher, and he was revolted by the Securitate’s oppression of the Romanian people. As a result, Andrei and his family were kept under virtual house arrest, forbidden from traveling, their every movement watched. His daughter, Elena, said to be no less brilliant than her father, was a graduate student in mathematics at the university, hoping to follow in her father’s footsteps.\n\nAs Romania reached a boiling point in December of 1989, and popular protests began to break out against the tyrant Nicolae Ceau e9781429993739_img_351.gif escu, the Securitate, the tyrant’s Praetorian guard, retaliated with mass arrests and murders. In Timisoara, a huge crowd gathered on Bulevardul 30 Decembrie, and demonstrators broke into Communist Party headquarters and began throwing portraits of the tyrant out of the windows. The army and the Securitate fired on the unruly crowd throughout the day and night; the dead were piled up and buried in mass graves.\n\nDisgusted, Andrei Petrescu decided to do his small part to fight the tyranny. He possessed the keys to Ceau e9781429993739_img_351.gif escu’s most secret communications, and he would give them away to the tyrant’s enemies. No longer could Ceau e9781429993739_img_351.gif escu communicate in secret with his henchmen; his decisions, his orders, would be known the moment he uttered them.\n\nAndrei Petrescu wrestled with the decision. Would this imperil the lives of his beloved Simona, his adored Elena? Once they had discovered what he had done—and they would know, for no one else outside the government knew the source codes—Andrei and his family would be rounded up, arrested, and executed.\n\nNo, he would have to get out of Romania. But to do that he needed to enlist a powerful outsider, preferably an intelligence agency such as the CIA or the KGB, that had the resources to get the family out.\n\nTerrified, he made cautious, veiled inquiries. He knew people; his colleagues knew people. He made his offer, and his demand. But both the British and the Americans refused to get involved. They had adopted a hands-off policy toward Romania. His offer was rebuffed.\n\nAnd then very early one morning he was contacted by an American, a representative of another intelligence agency, not the CIA. They were interested; they would help. They had the courage the others lacked.\n\nThe operational details had been designed by the Directorate’s logistical architects, refined by Bryson upon consultation with Ted Waller. Bryson was to smuggle out of Romania the mathematician and his family, along with five others, two men and three women, all of them intelligence assets. Getting into Romania was the easy part. From Nyírábrány, in the east of Hungary, Bryson crossed the border by rail into Romania at Valea Lui Mihai, carrying an authentic Hungarian passport of a long-haul freight driver; with his drab overalls and his callused hands, he was given barely a once-over. A few kilometers outside Valea Lui Mihai he found the truck that had been left for him by a Directorate contact. It was an old Romanian panel truck that belched diesel. It had been ingeniously modified in-country by Directorate assets: when the back of the truck was opened, the cargo bay seemed to be stacked with crates of Romanian wine and tzuica, plum brandy. But the crates were only one row deep; they concealed a large compartment, taking up most of the cargo area, in which all but one of the Romanians could be hidden.\n\nThe group had been instructed to meet him in the Baneasa forest, five kilometers north of Bucharest. Bryson found them at the designated rendezvous point, a picnic spread out before them, looking like an extended family on an outing. But Bryson could see the terror in their faces.\n\nThe leader of the eight was obviously the mathematician, Andrei Petrescu, a diminutive man in his sixties, accompanied by a meek, moon-faced woman, apparently his wife. But it was their daughter who arrested Bryson’s attention, for he had never met a woman so beautiful. Twenty-year-old Elena Petrescu was raven-haired, petite, and lithe, with dark eyes that glittered and flashed. She wore a black skirt and dove-gray sweater, a colorful babushka tied around her head. She was silent and looked at him with profound suspicion.\n\nBryson greeted them in Romanian. Buna ziua, he said. \"Unde este cea mai apropiata statie Peco?\" Where is the nearest gas station?\n\nSinteti pe un drum gresit, responded the mathematician. You are on the wrong road.\n\nThey followed him to the panel truck, which he’d parked in the shelter of a copse of trees. The beautiful young woman joined him in the cab, as was the preordained arrangement. The others took their seats in the hidden compartment, where Bryson had left sandwiches and bottled water to get them through the long journey to the Hungarian border.\n\nElena said nothing for the first several hours. Bryson attempted to make conversation, but she remained taciturn, though whether she was shy or just nervous he could not tell. They passed through the county of Bihor and neared the frontier crossing point at Bors, from where they would cross over to Biharkeresztes in Hungary. They had driven through the night and were making good time; everything seemed to be going smoothly—too smoothly, Bryson thought, for the Balkans, where a thousand little things could go wrong.\n\nSo it did not surprise him when he saw the flashing lights of a police car, a blue-uniformed policeman inspecting oncoming traffic, about eight kilometers from the border. Nor did it surprise him when the policeman waved them over to the side of the road.\n\nWhat the hell is this? he said to Elena Petrescu, forcing a blase tone as the jackbooted policeman approached.\n\nJust a routine traffic stop, she replied.\n\nI hope you’re right, Bryson said, rolling down the window. His Romanian was fluent but the accent was not native; the Hungarian passport would explain that. He prepared himself to quarrel with the cop, as would any long-haul truck driver annoyed by some petty inconvenience.\n\nThe policeman asked him for his papers and the truck’s registration. He inspected them; everything was in order.\n\nWas something wrong? Bryson asked in Romanian.\n\nOfficiously, the policeman waved a hand toward the truck’s headlights. One of them was burned out. But he would not let them go so easily. He wanted to know what was in the truck.\n\nExports, replied Bryson.\n\nOpen, said the policeman.\n\nSighing with annoyance, Bryson got out of the cab and went to unlock the tailgate. A semiautomatic pistol was holstered at his back, concealed inside his gray muslin work jacket; he would use it only if he had to, for killing the policeman was enormously risky. Not only was there the chance of being seen by a passing motorist, but if the officer had radioed in the truck’s license plate numbers while he was pulling them over, his dispatcher would be waiting for a further communication. If none came, others would be called in, the truck’s plates flagged at border control. Bryson did not want to have to kill the man, but he realized he might not have any choice.\n\nAs he pulled open the rear door, he could see the cop eyeing the crates of wine and tzuica greedily. Bryson found that reassuring: perhaps a bribe of a case or two of spirits would be enough to satisfy the man and send him on his way. But the policeman began pawing through the crates as if inventorying them, and he quickly reached the false wall, a mere two feet or so in. Eyes narrowed in suspicion, the Romanian tapped at the wall, heard the hollowness.\n\nHey, what the fuck is this? he exclaimed.\n\nBryson slipped his right hand around to the holstered pistol, but just then he saw Elena Petrescu saunter around the back of the truck, one hand placed saucily on her left hip. She was chewing gum, and her face was heavily made up with too much lipstick, mascara, and rouge: she must have applied it while she sat waiting in the cab. She looked like a vamp, a prostitute. Working her jaw up and down, she leaned in very close to the policeman and said, Ce curu’ meu vrei? What the fuck do you want?\n\nFututi gura! said the policeman. Fuck you! He reached behind the crates with both hands, running them along the false back, obviously feeling for a pull or knob or lever to open it. Bryson’s stomach plummeted as the man gripped the indentation that opened the secret compartment. There was no explaining the seven concealed passengers; the policeman would have to be killed. And what the hell was Elena doing, antagonizing him further?\n\nLet me ask you something, comrade, she said in a quiet, insinuating voice. How much is your life worth to you?\n\nThe cop whirled around, glaring at her. What the fuck are you talking about, whore?\n\nI ask you, how much is your life worth? Because you’re not just about to end a good career. You’re about to buy yourself a one-way ticket to the psychiatric prison. Maybe to some pauper’s grave.\n\nBryson was aghast: she was destroying everything, she had to be stopped!\n\nThe policeman opened the canvas pouch that hung around his neck and took out a bulky, old, military-style field telephone, which he began to dial.\n\nIf you’re making a call, I suggest you make it directly to the Securitate headquarters, and ask for Dragan himself. Bryson stared incredulously: Maj. Gen. Radu Dragan was the second-in-command at the secret police, notoriously corrupt and said to be sexually dissolute.\n\nThe policeman stopped dialing, his eyes searching Elena’s face. You threaten me, bitch?\n\nShe snapped her gum. Hey, I don’t care what you do. If you want to interfere with Securitate business of the highest and most confidential nature, be my guest. I just do my job. Dragan likes his Magyar virgins, and when he’s done with them, I always drop my girls off across the border like I’m supposed to. You want to get in my way, fine. You wanna be the hero who makes Dragan’s little weakness public, it’s up to you. But I sure as hell wouldn’t want to be you, or anyone who knows you. She rolled her eyes. Come on, dial Dragan’s office. She recited a number with a Bucharest area code and exchange.\n\nSlowly, dazed, the policeman punched out the numbers, then put the handset to his ear. His eyes widened and he quickly disconnected the call: he had obviously connected with the Securitate.\n\nHe turned around quickly, striding away from the truck, muttering profuse apologies as he got into his cruiser and drove off.\n\nLater, as the border guards waved them through, Bryson said to Elena, Was that really the Securitate’s phone number?\n\nOf course, she said indignantly.\n\nHow did you—?\n\nI’m good with numbers, she said. Didn’t they tell you that?\n\nAt the wedding, Ted Waller was Nick’s best man. Elena’s parents had been relocated, under new identities, to Rovinj, on the Istrian coast of the Adriatic, under Directorate protection; for reasons of security, she was not allowed to visit them, a proscription she accepted, with a heavy heart, as a terrible necessity."
