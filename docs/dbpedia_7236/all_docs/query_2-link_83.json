        "text": "About 25 years ago, I bought a complete set of Margaret Sanger’s journal The Birth Control Review and ambitiously set out to read every one of its 5,631 pages. The strange experience left me just a little uncertain about what is real and what is not. Sanger’s world has that effect on a person, because it is so completely different from the one we are accustomed to.\n\nSanger associated with racists and anti-Semites, people who despised everyone who was not a Nordic god or goddess, and those who demanded coercive eugenics programs to eliminate “lesser” humans. The whole bunch, of course, participated in continuous vicious attacks on the Catholic Church.\n\nMost pro-lifers have a vague feeling that Margaret Sanger, the founder of the American Birth Control League (later Planned Parenthood), is somehow “bad,” but they really have no idea. The malignant influence of Sanger and similar thinkers not only has ruined the West to the point that it is dying, but seems Hell-bent on corrupting the rest of the world as well.\n\nMargaret Sanger’s Eugenic Beliefs\n\nBreed, little mothers,\n\nWith the tired backs and the tired hands,\n\nBreed for the owners of mills and the owners of mines,\n\nBreed a race of danger-haunted men,\n\nA race of toiling, sweating, miserable men,\n\nBreed, little mothers,\n\nBreed for the owners of mills and the owners of mines,\n\nBreed, breed, breed!\n\n― Birth Control Review, April 1930.1\n\nMargaret Sanger’s journal was primarily devoted to the legalization and spread of voluntary birth control. However, the main theme running through The Birth Control Review was eugenics, thus the masthead “Birth Control: To Create a Race of Thoroughbreds.”\n\nThe pseudo-science of eugenics was taken very seriously in the first half of the twentieth century and was taught in hundreds of colleges and universities using scores of textbooks written by distinguished scholars. A.P. Pilloy, writing in the BCR, describes both negative and positive eugenics: “Broadly speaking, the aims of eugenics are two: To prevent the unfit from leaving any descendants, and to encourage the multiplication of the more fit and useful citizens.”2\n\nThe Birth Control Review frequently highlighted the mission of its parent organization: “The American Birth Control League. Its Aim: To promote eugenic birth selection throughout the United States so that there may be more well-born and fewer ill-born children ― a stronger, healthier and more intelligent race.”3\n\nMargaret Sanger neatly summarized the intimate relationship between the eugenics and birth control movements:\n\nBefore eugenists and others who are laboring for racial betterment can succeed, they must first clear the way for Birth Control. Like the advocates of Birth Control, the eugenists, for instance, are seeking to assist the race toward the elimination of the unfit…. Birth control of itself, by freeing the reproductive instinct from its present chains, will make a better race…. Eugenics without birth control seems to us a house built upon the sands. It is at the mercy of the rising stream of the unfit.4\n\nSome of the writers for The Birth Control Review waxed positively poetic on this theme. One said, “Voluntary control of pregnancy and childbirth is a great torch on one side of the gateway through which intelligent humanity is moving toward a civilization based on human quality…. On the other side of that gateway stands the torch lighted by Eugenics.”5\n\nAnother enthused that the combined forces of birth control and eugenics would “Speed the day when woman shall be free! Then, too, shall man be free and they together, emancipated from the degrading ignorance and superstition of the past, shall walk the highlands of vision, mate in perfect love, and people the earth with a race of gods.”6\n\nSanger followed eugenic reasoning to its logical conclusion ― that charity is “dysgenic,” leading to a degradation of the human race. She said, “We are now in a state where our charities, our compensation acts, our pensions, hospitals, and even our drainage and sanitary equipment all tend to keep alive the sickly and the weak, who are allowed to propagate and in turn produce a race of degenerates.”7\n\nOne BCR advertisement proclaimed, “Giving to charities merely perpetuates the evil ― Birth Control means prevention!”8 And Edward East proclaimed, “Well-intentioned philanthropy and social service is nothing but a brutal gesture to posterity.”9\n\nSanger described her view of the root of societal problems:\n\n[Woman’s] instincts are fundamentally creative, not destructive. But her sex-bondage has made her the dumb instrument of the monster she detests. For centuries she has populated the earth in ignorance and without restraint, in vast numbers and with staggering rapidity. She has become not the mother of a nobler race, but a mere breeding machine grinding out a humanity which fills insane asylums, almshouses and sweat shops, and provides cannon fodder that tyrants may rise to power on the sacrifice of her offspring.10\n\nOf course, then as now, if the lowly do not immediately embrace the Utopian plans of the elite, they must be whipped into line by greater and greater degrees of coercive pressure. Sanger herself said, “Possibly drastic and Spartan methods may be forced upon society if it continues complacently to encourage the chance and chaotic breeding that has resulted from our stupidly cruel sentimentalism.”11 She also said, “To meet this problem [of dysgenics] as a great scientist has recently pointed out, we need not more of the fit, but fewer of the unfit. The propagation of the degenerate, the imbecile, the feeble-minded, should be prevented.”1\n\nThe doctors who wrote for The Birth Control Review openly advocated what they called a “medical utopia with birth control.” J. Walter Carr, M.D. wrote, “The community would have to take suitable precautions in self defense and might decree that all adolescents should be examined at puberty and steps taken to sterilize those who could not reasonably be expected to beget healthy children.”16 Another physician, Anna Blount, wrote:\n\nThere they are, a motley group, from the gay, light-hearted moron, who cannot make an intelligent plan, even to do mischief; to the doddering idiot, the crafty paranoiac, the wretched epileptic, the moral imbecile, the chronic criminal with hereditary taint, and even the village ne’er-do-well. What do they cost us, in wealth, in labor and in misery? They must be eliminated. Eugenics makes birth control imperative.… But whatever the means this stream of human waste must be deflected from the melting-pot.… Godspeed the day when the unwilling mother, with her weak, puny body, her sad, anemic, unlovely face, and her dependent whine, will be no more. In that day, we shall see a race of American thoroughbreds, if not the superman.17\n\nThis loathing of the less fortunate saturates the pages of The Birth Control Review. Frequent contributor George Kilpatrick wrote:\n\nUnsentimental and rigid examination revealed him [“the moron”] to be so inadequate and incapable that he was worthless even for cannon fodder. Mentally meager, culturally nothing, socially as selfish as a shark, sexually as eager as a rabbit, careless as a crow and prolific as a rat, the moron now in astonishing numbers confronts society as a grinning, scoffing brute in boots ― and in full possession of sovereign political rights.… He breeds with Biblical abandon, and is not discouraged by the religious in his industrious reproduction of his personally and socially worthless self.18\n\nWhat a contrast to the attitude of St. Lawrence, who said of the blind, maimed and leprous, “These are the treasures of the Church!”\n\nOf course, then as now, Sanger’s opponents were smeared with every vicious label the writers for The Birth Control Review could muster, including “enemies of humanity” and “savage traitors.”19\n\nSanger’s Connection to Nazis\n\nOne of the most enthusiastic supporters of eugenics in the pages of The Birth Control Review was Professor Doktor Ernst Rudin, Adolf Hitler’s Director of Genetic Sterilization and founder of the Nazi Gesellschaft fur Rassenhygiene [Society for Racial Hygiene].13 In fact, Rudin’s boss, Adolf Hitler, avidly read American eugenics journals and developed his ideas of an Aryan “master race” from their writers.14\n\nLike the Nazis, writers for The Birth Control Review advocated positive eugenics. C.C. Little said, “The eugenist is very clear on the two facts which have been given you this morning: That the production of the unfit should be discouraged or stopped, and that the production of the fit should be encouraged and possibly forced.”15 This was the first mention in modern times of an idea that evolved within a decade into the Nazi’s grotesque Lebensborn program, which bred the “highest-quality” Aryan men and women like cattle.\n\nHatred of the Catholic Church\n\nThe most common themes of Margaret Sanger’s Birth Control Review (BCR) were eugenics and contraception, with hatred of the Catholic Church running a close third.\n\nPlanned Parenthood’s loathing of the Catholic Church is nearly a century old, and springs mostly from its realization that the Church is its primary opponent.\n\nAs one editorial in The Birth Control Review revealed, “Our experience of the last ten years of constant fighting has been that of all the reactionary groups in the country the Roman Catholic Church is the most politically pernicious and menacing to any progressive movement.”20 Another writer asserted, “Religion, in its organized forms, is the arch enemy of the birth control movement throughout the world.… That they are out of touch with current opinion and modern thought, seldom if ever occurs to them, as they wave their venerable superstitions in our faces.”21\n\nMargaret Sanger herself said, “Today the chief warfare against Birth Control is waged by the Roman Catholic clergy and their allies.”22 She recounted, “Very early in childhood I associated large families with poverty, toil, unemployment, drunkenness, cruelty, quarreling, fighting, debts, jail ― and the Catholic Church.”23\n\nThen, as now, the people who demanded tolerance for their own views accused the Catholic Church of “fiendish cruelty,”24 forcing women to “choose between perpetual adoration and perpetual pregnancy,”25 plotting to “apply the thumb-screw and the rack to all those who believe in a woman’s right to practice voluntary motherhood,”26 and that the Church demanded that “women shall be bent and broken on the torture rack of ignorance.”27\n\nFrequent BCR contributor and science fiction writer H.G. Wells raved, “Rome is the source and center of Fascism…. Why do we not bomb Rome? Why do we allow these open and declared antagonists of democratic freedom to entertain their Shinto allies and organize a pseudo-Catholic destruction of democratic freedom?”28\n\nSuch nonsense was warmly welcomed in the pages of The Birth Control Review not once or twice, but hundreds of times.\n\nMany of these statements were simply the result of profound and blinding ignorance, which allowed people to make blanket statements that made no historical sense. For instance, one doctor alleged, “All religions have always considered woman as a breeding machine and nothing else.”29\n\nAnti-Catholic Conspiracies Galore\n\nThe anti-Catholics who wrote for The Birth Control Review perceived the Catholic Church as the root of all their troubles, and feared a Papist conspiracy lurking around every corner. They were every bit as paranoid then as the “pro-choicers” are now.\n\nOne writer claimed that the Church wanted to rule the world by making everyone live by Catholic teachings (sound familiar)?30 Another hoped that the Church’s “dastardly attempt to destroy our liberties will be failed,” and complained that She was trying to “deprive Americans of the right of free speech and the free discussion of their laws.”31 George Hallett was convinced that Church leaders “have most of the legislators enslaved.”32 Finally, Margaret Sanger griped that “the influence of the Roman Catholic Church was seen everywhere…. the Church apparently dominates American courts of justice and political life today.”33\n\nOne writer for The Birth Control Review wrote, “The Catholics are directing our legislators to act according to their will. We have all been troubled by the fear that this Catholic threat to our free institutions would materialize if Catholics were given positions of power in our government.”34\n\nImagine the reaction if the word “Jew” appeared in the above quote instead of “Catholic.” But somehow, such anti-Catholic bigotry seems perfectly acceptable to Planned Parenthood.\n\nFrequent contributor Norman Himes claimed that the Pope ran Massachusetts and that “we shall soon have the iron heel of Romanism upon our throats even as it treads upon the freedom of Italian citizens today.”35 Himes also believed that Catholic “stock” was inferior to that of Unitarians, Universalists and Freethinkers,36 and that all rights (including the right to life) are bestowed by the State and can be revoked at any time.37\n\nOf course, the Catholic Church was attacked by Protestant denominations that had surrendered in the fight against birth control. One submission from the magazine The Protestant said, “It is limitation of the birth rate, and not the means by which the limitation is accomplished, that the Papacy is fighting. Its demand is for large families and large Roman Catholic voting populations. It is the fact, not the methods, of birth control that angers it.”38\n\nThere were charlatans and turncoats then as there are now. One minister claimed that birth control was “good religion.”39 Another alleged, “The eugenic ideal may become a distinct aid to Jesus’ dream of His kingdom on earth, and may well be integrated as a general religious concept.”40\n\nOne of the worst afflictions of the Church over the past century is failed priests who soothed their own guilty consciences by attacking the Church. Former priest L.H. Lehmann wrote articles that are almost identical to those that appear in Catholics for [a Free] Choice literature today;\n\nAt the bottom of the Papacy’s attitude towards sex, as in its attitude towards everything else in the domestic and public life of men and women, is its unceasing reach after supreme control of the bodies and souls of all men.… Although universal power and dominion be foreign to the mind of Christ, history is writ large with the record of shame brought upon the fair name of Christianity by this unceasing reach of the Roman Church after undisputed dominion over all men and nations.41\n\nWriters for The Birth Control Review used exactly the arguments that CFFC and other pro-abortion groups use today. One editorial claimed:\n\nThe coercive attitude of the National Catholic Alumni Federation protest is far more serious, threatening as it does the American principle of freedom of opinion and the separation of church and state…. The real issue centers in the Catholic disregard of the principle of freedom of conscience upon which the country was, supposedly, founded.42\n\nAnother charged:\n\nInstead of separation of church and state with equal rights for all religious denominations, they are asking that the religious tenets of one church shall be by law binding on all the men and women of America…. Let the Catholic Church guide its own people, but let it not dominate the lives of those who are not in its fold.43\n\nAnother editorial proclaimed, “The Roman Catholics say that Birth Control is immoral. We claim that for us Birth Control is of high moral value. We do not ask to constrain their consciences, let them cease to attempt to constrain ours.”44\n\nThe Culture of Death thinks that “separation of Church and state” really means “Where the state advances, the Church must retreat.” And so, we have constant efforts by pro-abortion groups to force Catholic hospitals and doctors to perform abortions and sterilizations and distribute contraceptives.\n\nScience to Replace Religion\n\nOne book review in The Birth Control Review said, “The main argument is a simple one, that many features of orthodox religion in themselves are bad and that the old religious culture pattern is hopelessly inconsistent with modern science and with a progressively secularized culture. Crush the infamous thing and away with the rubbish.”45\n\nIf this “infamous thing” is to become “rubbish,” what will replace it? Francis B. Summer says:\n\nScience now aims at nothing less than the establishment of a new religion, without priest or dogma, the sole aim of which is the happiness and ennoblement of humanity on earth, and Neo-Malthusianism, though not the whole, is the chief factor in that religion.46\n\nAnother writer called science “the only possible savior of mankind.”47\n\nScience as savior hasn’t done too well for itself, has it?\n\nAlthough the editors of The Birth Control Review preferred articles submitted by dissenting “Catholics,” they were kind enough to occasionally allow authentic Catholic writers to submit opinion pieces. Seen from a vantage point nearly a century later, these articles are eerily prophetic.\n\nFor example, Father Fulton Sheen commented on the Federal Council of Churches capitulation on birth control, writing, “Since a week ago last Saturday we can no longer expect them to defend the law of God. These sects will work out the very logic of their ways and in fifty or one hundred years there will be only the Church and paganism. We will be left to fight the battle alone ― and we will.”48\n\nSheen was absolutely correct. Since 1960, the membership of the Roman Catholic Church in the United States has risen 43%, and the memberships of all pro-life churches has increased by 38%. Meanwhile, the combined membership rolls of pro-abortion churches in the United States have plunged 34%.49 Most interestingly, those timid and lukewarm churches that have proclaimed that they are “neutral” on abortion have lost 81% of their members since 1960.\n\nRacism in The Birth Control Review\n\nContributors to The Birth Control Review loathed the Catholic Church, but they had plenty of hatred left over for minorities. When these eugenicists started talking about “race suicide” and “human stock,” they could not help but rank various racial, ethnic and national groups according to their utility, thereby revealing their naked racism.\n\nTo begin with, what did these eugenicists consider to be the “master race?” H.J. Muller wrote “I do not think it would be an exaggeration to say that in respect of mental gifts the Nordic race marches in the van[guard] of mankind.”50 One of Harry H. Laughlin’s biographers described him as “among the most racist and anti-Semitic of early twentieth-century eugenicists.”51 He stated in The Birth Control Review that “It is generally agreed that biologically ― physically, mentally, and emotionally ― the Greeks were perhaps the finest product of human breeding since the advent of the human species.”52\n\nSome defenders of Sanger or her journal claim that writers referring to “race suicide” or “the decline of the race” were speaking of humanity as a whole. Anyone who has studied The Birth Control Review realizes that nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nFor example, Julian Huxley founded the World Wildlife Fund and was a leading English pro-abortion agitator. In The Birth Control Review, he commented “There is, first, the mere question of quantity of population, quantity of Americans in the world versus the quantity of Englishmen, versus the quantity of Africans, versus the quantity of Chinese. If you have one race whose population is going down and another whose population is going up, there is always the possibility of race suicide.”53\n\nIn The Spectator, Huxley gave his opinion that\n\nThe negro mind is as different from the white mind as the negro from the white body. The typical negro servant, for instance, is wonderful with children, for the reason that she really enjoys doing the things that children do…. You have only to go to a nigger camp‑meeting to see the African mind in operation ― the shrieks, the dancing and yelling and sweating, the surrender to the most violent emotion, the ecstatic blending of the soul of the Congo with the practice of the Salvation Army. [Intermarriage between the] negro and Caucasian type gives rise to all sorts of disharmonious organisms…. By putting some of the white man’s mind into the mulatto, you not only make him more capable and more ambitious (there are no well‑authenticated cases of pure blacks rising to any eminence), but you increase his discontent and create an obvious injustice if you continue to treat him like any full‑blooded African. The American negro is making trouble because of the American white blood that is in him.”54\n\nThe most vocal contributor to The Birth Control Review was undoubtedly Lothrop Stoddard, a member of the National Council of the American Birth Control League. He wrote in his book The Rising Tide of Color against White World‑Supremacy:\n\nBlack blood, once entering a human stock, seems never really bred out again.… White men cannot, under peril of their vary race‑existence, allow wholesale Asian immigration into White race‑areas…. The grim truth of the matter is this: The whole White race is exposed, immediately or ultimately, to the possibility of social sterilization and final replacement or absorption by the teeming colored races.\n\nAnd, of course, the more primitive a type is, the more prepotent it is. This is why crossings with the negro are uniformly fatal. Whites, Amerindians, or Asiatics ― all are alike vanquished by the invincible prepotency of the more primitive, generalized, and lower negro blood.… We or the next generation will take in hand the problem of race‑depreciation, and segregation of defectives and abolition of handicaps penalizing the better stocks will put an end to our present racial decline.55\n\nStoddard emphasized his concerns in the pages of The Birth Control Review, fretting that “It is the lower elements of the population, the negroid aboriginal tribes and the Pariahs or Outcasts, who are gaining the fastest.”56\n\nThis concern with “differential fertility” permeated the BCR. Malcolm H. Bissell wrote that “The white will practice voluntary restriction of their numbers while “uncivilized” races remain prolific, with the ultimate result of the extermination of white civilization by a ‘rising tide of color.'”57\n\nMajor Leonard Darwin, son of Charles Darwin and longtime Chairman of the British Eugenics Society, wrote extensively on this topic, claiming in The Birth Control Review:\n\nOf all the problems which will have to be faced in the future, in my opinion, the most difficult will be those concerning the treatment of the inferior races of mankind.… We ought to decide, in the first place, whether it would be preferable that there should be a larger number of persons at a lower level of civilization or a smaller number at a higher stage of culture.58\n\nMany other eugenicists writing for The Birth Control Review insisted on ranking people based upon their intelligence. H.J. Muller said:\n\nAverage specimens of the mongoloid races greatly excel the average Negro in mental equipment…. It is indisputable that the population of southern Europe is less well equipped mentally than that of northern Europe, and the population of eastern Europe than that of western Europe…. Both by temperament and character, and also in respect of rational endowment, the Mediterranean occupies an intermediate position between the Nordic and the Negro.59\n\nEugenics: The “Solution” to the “Negro Problem”\n\nIt is no surprise that the many eugenicists who wrote for The Birth Control Review saw birth control as the solution to the problem of differential fertility — that is, too many children from the “lower” races and not enough from the “higher” races. L.C. Dunn wrote:\n\nFrom this discussion it appears that the social and biological worth of the individual is determined by his inheritance; that the different races are radically unequal in mental endowment, and that civilization in America is threatened with deterioration through overpopulation, the unrestricted reproduction of persons of bad heredity and inferior racial constitution. The remedy is tersely given, ― Birth Control.60\n\nOthers believed that differential mortality would solve what Elmer A. Carter called “the vexatious Negro problem.” He wrote:\n\nNot a few anthropologists and sociologists have valiantly maintained that the difference in Negro and white mortality rates is conclusive evidence of the innate inferiority of the Negro.… the Negro who, in addition to the handicaps of race and color, is shackled by mental and social incompetence serenely goes on his way bringing into the world children whose chances of mere existence are apparently becoming more and more hazardous.61\n\nIn an article entitled “God’s Chillun” in the special “Negro Number” of The Birth Control Review, Walter Terpenning wrote that “Many of the colored citizens are fine specimens of humanity. A good share of them, however, constitute a large percentage of Kalamazoo’s human scrap‑pile…. The dissemination of the information of birth control should have begun with this [Negro] class rather than with the upper social and economic classes of white citizens.”62\n\nAt least we cannot accuse the contributors to The Birth Control Review of being inconsistent in their racism, because they held everyone in contempt who did not measure up to their Nordic ideal.\n\nOn Puerto Ricans: “He lives literally in chronic starvation, crowding his filthy scarecrow body into a hut where his female counterpart and their numberless wretched children almost always share at least one of his diseases.”63\n\nOn Italians: “Look over “Who’s Who in America” for Italian names. They are conspicuous by their absence.”64\n\nOn the Polish: “Polish men are often immoral because they have been born of too young mothers or preceded by many born before.”65\n\nOn Southerners: “The southern woman is fifty years behind the rest of the women in the country. She has no mind, no individuality, no initiative, and without question accepts all the absurd conventionalities that hedge her about and keep her a charming and useless dependent on her husband.”66\n\nNearly a century ago, John Galsworthy wrote in The Birth Control Review that “I’m afraid there’s no question but that it’s unpatriotic not to believe in limiting our population…. Birth control is essential for the slums, anyway.”67 Alexander Sanger, grandson of Margaret and head of Planned Parenthood’s largest affiliate, said the same thing sixty years later: “We currently have a small storefront office in central Harlem, and it is my first priority to see if we can transform that into a[n abortion] clinic…. With all her success, my grandmother left some unfinished business, and I intend to finish it.”68\n\nAnd so, the eugenics program targeting the “lower” races in the United States continues unabated under the banner of “choice.” It took 82 years to lynch 3,445 Blacks, which led to universal outrage and social revolution. It takes 82 hours to kill that many Black babies through abortion.69\n\nThe result is inevitable. One-tenth of the White race has been wiped out by legal abortion, but a staggering one-third of the Black race has been aborted.70\n\nThe American Birth Control League led the way in the 1920s, and its successor, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America leads, the way now. As former PPFA President Faye Wattleton boasted “I believe Margaret Sanger would have been proud of us today if she had seen the directions that we have most recently in this organization taken.”71\n\nThe Birth Control Review as the Origin of the Pro-Abortion Slogans\n\nMost of us have heard all of the tired old pro-abortion slogans many times. When we hear people start to chant them again, we usually roll our eyes and think “I’d sure give a lot to hear something original!”\n\nIt turns out that these pro-abortion slogans are even more unoriginal and unimaginative than we thought.\n\nReformed abortionist Bernard Nathanson recounts how he spent his time plotting the future course of the pro-abortion movement with NARAL co-founder Larry Lader:\n\n“Women must have control over their own bodies.”\n\n“Safe and legal abortion is every woman’s right.”\n\n“Who decides? You decide!”\n\n“Freedom of choice ― a basic American right.”\n\nI remember laughing when we made those slogans up. We were looking for some sexy, catchy slogans to capture public opinion. They were very cynical slogans then, just as all of these slogans today are very, very cynical.72\n\nBut history reveals that it was not Nathanson and Lader who created the modern-day pro-abortion slogans. This dubious honor must go to Margaret Sanger and other writers for the Birth Control Review.\n\n“Woman’s Body, Woman’s Choice”\n\nThe precursor of this slogan first appeared in the October 1928 Birth Control Review, when the editor claimed, “When women are in full control of their own bodies, then the world will honor motherhood and will learn that it is worth while to do everything possible to make it safe and desirable.”73\n\nThree years later, Maynard Shipley said, “One can say of him [author George Ryley Scott] that he is sincere, forthright, and unafraid; that he is a thorough believer in birth control, and also in legalized abortion ― in other words, over a woman’s right to possession and use of her own body.”74\n\nMagnus Hirschfield wrote, “For we have here merely the question of a woman’s rights over her own body. Moreover, experience shows that when proper methods are not available wrong and harmful ones are resorted to.”75 This slogan soon caught on and became very popular among writers for the Birth Control Review.\n\n“Every Child a Wanted Child”\n\nThis hideous slogan, which reduces children to the status of appliances, was first used by Mary Knoblauch in the April 1919 issue of the Birth Control Review. She said, “The first right a child should have, and since he can’t protest, we should insist upon it for him, is that of being wanted.”76\n\nMargaret Sanger echoed, “The first right of the child is to be wanted ― to be desired with an intensity of love that gives it its title to being and joyful impulse to live.”77\n\nElla K. Dearborn said, “It is an injustice to both parents and child to bring an unwelcome baby into the world.”78\n\nThis “better off dead” slogan is still very popular among pro-abortionists today in their attempts to portray themselves as kind, child-loving people.\n\n“Children by Choice, Not by Chance”\n\nThis slogan first appeared in the May 1927 edition of the Birth Control Review. Louis Mann wrote, “Religin…believes in cosmos, not chaos, in choice not chance, in free will, not fatalism. It must, therefore, believe in children by choice rather than by chance.”79\n\nHarry Fosdick claimed:\n\nThe tragedy of unplanned parenthood our children’s children will look back upon as utterly inhuman. It is just as much a man’s problem as it is a woman’s to see that this inhumanity is done away and that voluntary parenthood is established as the normal functioning of family life.80\n\nSimilar slogans appeared throughout the magazine’s entire run.\n\n“Freedom of Choice”\n\nAlthough Nathanson and Lader claimed credit for the star-spangled “freedom of choice” slogan, Margaret Sanger used it a half-century before NARAL was organized. She said:\n\nWoman must have her freedom ― the fundamental freedom of choosing whether or not she shall be a mother and how many children she will have….That right to decide imposes upon her the duty of clearing the way to knowledge by which she may make and carry out the decision.81\n\n“No Mandatory Motherhood!”\n\nThe “No mandatory motherhood!” slogan is a favorite of the most extreme feminists. Margaret Sanger first used it when she claimed, “My interest is to see American womanhood freed from forced maternity”82 and “Women clamor for deliverance from compulsory motherhood.”83\n\nShe also claimed, “The Church has been powerless and the champions of worn out moral creeds find themselves trying in vain to force all women to become mothers against their wills.”84\n\nElla Dearborn later wrote in the Birth Control Review that “forced motherhood and unwelcome children are pitiful and heartbreaking.”85\n\n“Safe, Legal and Rare”\n\nEven this slogan, which helped Bill Clinton get elected to the Presidency, was first used in the Birth Control Review. John Vaughn stressed, “The bringing about of an abortion should never be necessary; can never be moral; and must rarely be legal.… I say again, abortion should never be necessary, can never be moral, and must rarely be legal.”86\n\nIt is interesting now that as the extreme pro-abortion crowd has become politically empowered, they now demand that abortion be considered good, and no longer claim that they want it to be rare. Some have actually said that they want more, not fewer, abortions, and the hundreds of women who have been killed by negligent and incompetent abortionists show that the self-described “feminists” certainly do not care about the safety and health of women.\n\n“Not the Church, Not the State!”\n\nAs we have previously seen, the birth controllers and eugenicists who wrote for the Birth Control Review correctly recognized that the Catholic Church was their greatest enemy. Therefore, they did their best to shame and sideline the Church and her spokesmen.\n\nThe “Church and State” slogan is derived from a 1931 argument by Kate Gartz: “The church and the state must keep their hands off these most personal affairs.”87\n\nLater the same year, Clarence Little launched an attack on priests specifically when he wrote, “This hierarchy of celibate priests is as unqualified to give advice on matters dealing with the physiology of reproduction as their complete inexperience can make them.”88\n\nOf course, a priest who has counseled hundreds of couples anticipating matrimony or experiencing marital difficulties probably knows much more about marriage and reproduction in general than the average married person, just as a mechanic usually knows much more about a car than the person who owns and drives it.\n\n“Women Will Get Abortions Whether it is Legal or Not”\n\nNathanson and Lader said:\n\nWe fabricated the number of illegal abortions done annually in the U.S. The actual figure was approaching 100,000, but the figure we gave to the media repeatedly was 1,000,000. The number of women dying from illegal abortions was around 200‑250 annually. The figure we constantly fed to the media was 10,000.89\n\nThis detestable play for public sympathy actually originated in the pages of the Birth Control Review. Writers often fabricated numbers for the United States, but often mentioned other nations as well. One writer from Sanger’s German affiliate wrote:\n\n[In Germany] according to very conservative estimates, there are about one million abortion cases a year. Considering the fact that tens of thousands of women die [annually] because of these illegal operations, very often performed by quacks and midwives, it becomes evident to the sensible that more light must be cast on the subject.90\n\nAnother writer claimed that 4,300 women committed suicide in Germany each year due to unwanted pregnancies, and thousands more died of illegal abortions.91 As always, the authors offered no documentation or references to back up these “statistics.”\n\nAnd they still don’t.\n\nThe Takeaways\n\nThe most popular pro-abortion slogans first appeared in the Birth Control Review in one form or another, only in those days they were in support of contraception. This demonstrates yet again both the link between birth control and abortion, and that the pro-abortion movement has no imagination. As we have previously seen, not one of the “pro-choice” slogans has any scientific, theological or moral basis. They are designed to get people to accept abortion without thinking.\n\nThis is one of the reasons that the final victory of the pro-life movement is inevitable. Truth always wins out in the end. We have to get people to think. Sometimes this task may seem well-nigh impossible, but if we all get involved, we will hasten the final victory of the Culture of Life.\n\nThe False Promises of the Birth Control Review\n\nJust like the Devil, the Culture of Death always promises us the moon and the stars, but delivers nothing but death and destruction.\n\nThe year after Roe v. Wade, NARAL claimed:\n\nLegal abortion will result in a reduction in welfare rolls. Legal abortion will decrease the number of illegitimate births…. Legal abortion will decrease the number of unwanted children, battered children, child abuse cases, and possibly subsequent delinquency, drug addiction, and a host of social ills believed to be associated with neglectful parenthood.92\n\nHere NARAL was echoing many the promises made in the Birth Control Review: “Birth Control properly established would go further to eliminate poverty, sickness, insanity, crime, with all that these scourges imply than any other remedy proposed.”93\n\nS. Adolphus Knopf enthusiastically predicted:\n\nWhat would be gained if we followed the example of Holland, where birth control has been officially sanctioned for over fifty years? There would be fewer marital maladjustments, fewer divorces, less illegitimacy, less prostitution; syphilis and crime would be diminished.… There would be decided physical, material, moral and even spiritual progress.94\n\nOthers made even more extravagant promises. Holmes Alexander said, “As I understand it, the final goal of birth control is, by limiting reproduction, to improve the race, to promote individual and domestic happiness, and to curtail such scourges as war, famine, insanity, poverty, unemployment, and congenital crime.”95\n\nWe all know how a hundred years of empty promises by the Culture of Death have turned out. We have more illegitimacy, crime, war, famine, unemployment, mental problems and divorce than ever before, in addition to a host of problems Sanger and her companions never dreamed of.\n\nLet us examine some of the more specific promises made by the birth controllers that never came true….\n\n1. An End to Abortion\n\nThe most popular prediction made in the Birth Control Review was that the widespread use of contraception would completely end the practice of abortion, whether legal or illegal.\n\nMargaret Sanger’s group frequently emphasized its official position on abortion: “The American Birth Control League is absolutely and unequivocally opposed to any but therapeutic abortion. Abortion is dangerous, physically and psychically. Universal knowledge of Birth Control would reduce it to a minimum.”96\n\nSanger claimed, “Anyone who knows anything about either birth control or abortion knows that scientific birth control methods would do away with abortions which occur in appalling numbers in America every year.”97 She also said that “a knowledge of Birth Control, which is denied to the women of Austria, would, of course, wipe out the practice of abortion.”98\n\nSanger’s claim was backed up by a glittering galaxy of the leading physicians of the day. Ella Dearborn, M.D., said, “Abortion, however, must not be confused with Birth Control, which employs contraceptives and thus does away with the demand for abortion.”99\n\nRachelle Yarros, M.D., claimed, “Not only has Birth Control nothing in common with Abortion but is a weapon of the greatest value in fighting this evil. With its help we may hope to limit and, I trust, eradicate this criminal practice.”100\n\nNot to be outdone, Nadina R. Kavinoky, M.D., wrote:\n\nPresent scientific knowledge of birth control has reached such a stage that abortion is entirely unnecessary and the abortion rate is mute evidence of the neglect of society to care for its mothers…. The application of our present knowledge of birth control methods can practically eliminate abortions.101\n\nMany other doctors, including the famous William J. Robinson,102 C.V. Roman,103 Hannah Stone,104 and Alice Hamilton105 made exactly the same claim.\n\nBut long experience has shown us that no country has legalized abortion without first “softening up” society with years of contraception, which frequently fails and leads to an inevitable demand for illegal abortion. Of course, the pro-abortionists, who caused the problem in the first place, then demand the “solution” of legalized abortion.\n\nWe have witnessed the Culture of Death manufacturing one crisis after another in order to pave the way for social change. This tactic was effective nearly a century ago, as writers for the Birth Control Review grossly exaggerated the numbers of abortions taking place in the United States. Alexander M. Campbell predicted, “The increase of criminal abortion, which may be conservatively estimated at two million a year in America, would be materially reduced if contraceptive measures were scientifically administered.”106\n\nOf course, some writers took the opportunity to criticize their opponents. One said, “The real friends of abortion are ignorance of and opposition to wise, humane scientific contraception.”107\n\nDr. Ira Wile proclaimed, “Every intelligent person knows that contraception is opposed to abortion.”108\n\nSexologist Havelock Ellis used a slogan that pro-abortionists still frequently use in various forms today: “There cannot be any doubt about it, just as all those who work for birth control are diminishing the frequency of abortion, so every attempt to discourage birth control promotes abortion.”109\n\nHistory has shown us how the “birth control does away with abortion” prediction has fared. The United States has been saturated by every kind of birth control for half a century, and we have suffered nearly sixty million abortions. According to the Guttmacher Institute, there are two million contraceptive failures each year, and nearly two-thirds of women getting abortions were using contraception when they got pregnant.110\n\nIt seems that the fatal error of the “experts” in the Birth Control Review was not just naiveté about human nature, but the assumption that science would soon deliver an infallible means of birth control ― and that everyone would use it.\n\n2. Preventing Worldwide Famine\n\nMany writers for the Birth Control Review predicted that millions of people would starve if birth control were not immediately adopted all over the world.\n\nIn 1920, the self-described “expert upon the population situation” R.C. Martens predicted:\n\nWithin the next few months millions of human beings, mostly Europeans, will starve to death. Food to meet the needs of the Earths’ population is lacking and cannot be produced in time to avoid the great crash ― the crash which will, as its chief incident, cost uncounted millions of lives, and bring in the train of that disaster no one knows what governmental and social changes.111\n\nOxford Professor and Director of the Natural History Museum Sir Ray Lankester did not shrink from using apocalyptic imagery:\n\nIf man continues to act in the reckless way which has characterized his behavior hitherto, he will multiply to such an enormous extent that only a few kinds of animals and plants which serve him as food and fuel will be left on the face of the globe. He will have converted the gracious earth, once teeming with innumerable, incomparably beautiful varieties of life, into a desert, or, at best, a vast agricultural domain abandoned to the production of food‑stuffs for the hungry millions, which, like maggots consuming a carcass, or the irrepressible swarms of the locust, incessantly devour and multiply.112\n\nFamed science fiction author H.G. Wells almost matched Lankester in vivid imagery:\n\nThe world is already too full…. Unless a solution is found, life will come to mean a world without animals, for we shall not be able to support even squirrels. There will be no open country, no streams, cataracts, and woods, no independent travel ― and still the increase will continue.113\n\nThe writers for the Birth Control Review could not seem to make up their minds about future population numbers. In 1930, Warren Thompson and P.K. Whelpton said that the world population would collapse to a mere 185 million by the year 2000,114 and Raymond Pearl predicted that the population of the United States would be about 197 million by the year 2100115 (its current population is 320 million). On the other hand, H.G. Duncan predicted that there would be 75 trillion people on the earth by the year 3000, for a population density of 551,000 people per square mile (one person for every 50 square feet of land area)!116\n\nPaul Ehrlich of The Population Bomb infamy might have received his inspiration from Frank Hankins, who claimed, “With an increase of fifty per cent in agricultural efficiency and a utilization of all tillable areas America can raise food for only 208 million people.”117\n\nWhether the prediction was people teeming on the earth like ants or a sudden collapse and starvation of 90% of the world’s population, the solution proffered was always Birth Control.\n\nInstead of famine, we have problems with widespread obesity. Instead of people with standing room only on the earth, the United Nations now predicts that the world population will peak at about 8.3 billion and will then begin to decline.118\n\nWe have seen that the writers for the Birth Control Review were wildly inaccurate in their predictions that contraception would decisively end abortion, and that billions would die of starvation if birth control were not universally adopted by the people of the world in the 1930s. Contributors to Sanger’s journal made many other predictions that turned out to be entirely wrong.\n\nHowever, one writer did make a prediction that must inevitably come true.\n\n3. An End to War\n\nThe Birth Control Review began its publication run as World War I was winding down, and Margaret Sanger knew that most people were sick of fighting. She took advantage of this by promising that birth control would bring to an end to the conflicts that plagued the world. She said, “There are still some of us who believe birth control to be a fundamental solution to the problems of poverty, prostitution, child labor, and even war itself.119\n\nIn the same issue, Wesley Frost stated:\n\nOnly limitation of births will prevent future European wars…. If people could be made to comprehend that it was the overcrowding of European nations, except France, that caused this war, birth control would become a patriotic duty and an unwritten policy.120\n\nThis theme was interwoven throughout the 24-year run of the Birth Control Review. Edward Ross summed up the view of many contributors by saying, “There are good reasons for believing that the real enemy of the dove of peace is not the eagle of pride nor the vulture of greed, but the Stork.”121\n\nIn reality, none of the major conflicts of the twentieth century were caused by overpopulation. After all, most European nations had already adopted widespread birth control by the 1930s, and this fact did nothing to avert World War II.\n\n4. An End to Prostitution\n\nMargaret Sanger asserted:\n\nBirth Control will prevent prostitution, because young people will be able to marry early and wait until their incomes are sufficient before having children, and wives will be freed from the haunting fear of pregnancy which hovers over a woman from month to month and frequently drives husbands to prostitutes.122\n\nOne editorial predicted, “Birth Control will attack the institution of prostitution and increase the stability of the family,”123 and another claimed, “Our remedy for prostitution is to encourage early marriage by spreading the knowledge that couples can avoid having any more children than they are able to do justice to.”124\n\nAs we have seen, the famous William J. Robinson, M.D., predicted that birth control would lead to an end of abortion. He also said:\n\nIt is my well considered opinion that with the further spread of preventative knowledge and with divorce becoming easier, the number of marriages will go on increasing.… And this will do away, to a great extent, if not with promiscuity, certainly with commercialized prostitution.125\n\nWriters for the Birth Control Review were so ignorant of human nature that they believed that the widespread availability of contraception would even lead to a decrease in extramarital sex. Reverend Harry Fosdick maintained:\n\nThe idea that the mere removal of the dread of conception is going to let loose a flood of iniquity is, I suspect, a misapprehension of the facts. Children of this new generation who have been trained in a code of honor involving the existence and the right use of Birth Control will be less likely even than their mid‑Victorian parents to treat the matter lightly or to be beguiled by fools.126\n\nNot surprisingly, some women writers were knowledgeable enough about human nature to accurately predict what would happen if birth control became freely available. Gertrude Doniger said:\n\nThis new animal who swears, crosses her legs, dresses unconventionally and indulges in what were formerly masculine vices, is paradoxically a serf to her new sexual freedom. Under her new regime she has freed herself from fecundity only to indulge her exhibitionistic and narcissistic tendencies and carries her infantile demands into maturity.127\n\n5. An End to Crime\n\nOne of the assumptions made by the eugenicists who wrote for the Birth Control Review was that most crime was committed by “the lower classes.” Therefore, it seemed logical that getting lower-class women on birth control would reduce crime.\n\nMontgomery Mulford wrote, “The theory of birth control makes no extravagant claims; but I am of the belief that the acceptance of birth control by society, and its frank teaching, can help diminish criminal activity!”128\n\nAnother writer claimed, “Birth Control is a proper procedure, which is, perhaps, able to create a balance between the fit and the unfit. Its practice would go far toward a solution of the crime problem of today.”129\n\nDr. Ira Wile, who made many different predictions regarding birth control, said, “Contraception among all classes of the community would undoubtedly lead to a decrease in delinquency and crime.”130\n\nThis is an attitude that unfortunately persists today. As we have seen in a previous article in this series, it is not abortion that has caused the steep drop in violent crime in America over the past two decades, but a host of unrelated influences.131\n\n6. Utopia\n\nAccording to many writers for the Birth Control Review, the universal adoption of contraception would without doubt lead to a paradise on Earth. Racist and eugenicist Julian Huxley, founder of the World Wildlife Fund, wrote:\n\nMany of you will remember reading Mr. J.B.S. Haldane’s brilliant little book Daedalus, in which he envisaged the future of the human race many centuries hence when eugenics would really be eugenics and all breeding of new human beings would be done entirely in incubators. That may seem fantastic, but in these [birth control] researches we have at any rate the first step towards its possible realization.132\n\nDr. William F. Ogburn added, “Possibly babies will be supplied according to the laws of supply and demand which control the amounts of other products, such as potatoes.”133\n\nFinally, C.V. Drysdale expressed the vision that all eugenicists hold dear:\n\nWhen all nations follow the same course, and especially eliminate their undesirable types by fostering Birth Control, restrictions of all kinds will relax and gradually disappear, international intercourse shall be welcomed, we shall be citizens of the world as well as of our respective nations, international war will be unnecessary and unthinkable, and we shall all be able to combine as one human family and empire to subdue the destructive forces of Nature.134\n\n7. Surrender of the Catholic Church\n\nThe most compelling evidence that Margaret Sanger and her fellow writers did not comprehend the nature of their most implacable enemy was their belief that the Catholic Church would eventually surrender in the battle over birth control.\n\nBoyd Barrett confidently predicted that “under pressure of the public opinion and moral sense of the Church’s children, and also under pressure of reason, the [Roman Catholic] Church will change her position in regard to Birth Control.”135\n\nJust like today’s quisling groups like Call to Action and Catholics for [a Free] Choice, some writers said that Church teaching should simply conform to current thinking. Robert N. Ford held:\n\nIf one’s religion does not coincide with or include this highly moral code of Birth Control, then perhaps we should re‑interpret the Bible, the Talmud, the Koran and other holy writ to include it. A critical review of religious evolution shows that man has been quite proficient in adopting religions to his needs, and certainly Birth Control is becoming a pressing need.136\n\nSanger occasionally allowed her opponents to write for the Birth Control Review, perhaps to give her readers insight into the thinking of those who opposed contraception. On such occasions, these writer’s predictions turned out to be very accurate indeed.\n\nThe best of these was penned by the famous social reformer Father John A. Ryan, who stirringly wrote:\n\nWe give this challenge to the proponents of birth control. We [Roman Catholics] too, are of yesterday, but we shall be the America of tomorrow; we shall be the majority. We shall occupy and dominate every sphere of activity; the farm, the factory, the counting house, the schools, the professions, the press, the legislature. We shall dominate because we shall have the numbers and the intelligence, and above all, the moral strength to struggle, to endure, to persevere. To you we shall leave the gods and goddesses which you have made to your image and likeness, the divinities of ease, of enjoyment, of mediocrity. We shall leave you the comforts of decadence and the sentence of extinction.137\n\nAlthough scandals and indifference have rocked the Catholic Church throughout her history, we have two unbeatable allies in this fight: God and demographics. Father Ryan saw the truth more than eight decades ago; we have only to fulfill his prophecy. But this will require us to treasure our fertility as Jesus Christ intended us to.\n\nOnly time will tell if we are up to the task.\n\nAttempts to Defend Sanger\n\nWhen confronted with some of the more offensive racist, eugenicist and anti-religious material in the Birth Control Review, pro-abortionists — particularly Planned Parenthood employees — tend to respond with three standard objections.\n\n1. “The Material Is Taken out of Context”\n\nThe Birth Control Review enjoyed a 24-year run, from 1917 and 1940, and accounted for 5,631 pages and 4.3 million words of text, a large volume of information by any standard. If this material included two, three, or even a dozen or so questionable or offensive quotes, Planned Parenthood defenders would have a point if they stated that “the material was taken out of context.” However, the pages of the Birth Control Review are saturated with noxious ideas and statements ― eugenic, racist, anti-immigrant, anti-Catholic, and so on.\n\nThe “out of context” defense is completely unpersuasive because the many repugnant ideas in Margaret Sanger’s journal are the context!\n\nPro-abortionists have a habit of smearing pro-life organizations with labels such as “anti-Semitic” and “racist,” often using a single quote by a spokesperson that is decades old. So why the loud protest from the champions of “choice,” who think they can get people to ignore the hundreds of bizarre and extreme quotes written by the founder of Planned Parenthood and her fellow writers?\n\n2. “Most of the material in the Birth Control Review was not written by Margaret Sanger.”\n\nThis is certainly true, but irrelevant. Sanger wrote a relatively small portion of the total volume of information contained in her journal, yet she still managed to provide several dozen quotes that demand very close scrutiny. For example, she wrote frequently about negative eugenics, including her infamous “Plan for Peace.” She also edited the Birth Control Review from its founding to 1928, and was an officer of the American Birth Control League throughout its entire run, which means that she is responsible for its contents.\n\nConsider this: If an American Nazi or well-known racist was allowed to print an article in a pro-life newsletter, the pro-abortionists would never let us forget it. They would not only smear the pro-life organization that published the offending article, they would relentlessly tar and feather the entire pro-life movement as “Nazis” and “racists.”\n\nWe are merely holding Planned Parenthood to the same standard. The Birth Control Review is larded with articles written by such ‘luminaries’ as Lothrop Stoddard, American Birth Control League board member and author of the book The Rising Tide of Color against White World-Supremacy, and Ernst Rudin, Adolf Hitler’s Director of Genetic Sterilization and founder of the Nazi Society for Racial Hygiene ― the organization behind the master plan to exterminate Jews during World War II.\n\nWe can thus say with certainty that Planned Parenthood honors a person (Margaret Sanger) who not only supported actual Nazis and racists, but gave them a widespread platform from which to spread their poison.\n\nSome of the more interesting characters who wrote for the Birth Control Review include the following people. Note the common twin threads of a seething hatred of the Catholic Church and a fundamental belief that non-white races are inferior. If Planned Parenthood has ever disavowed the statements or philosophies of any of these people, we don’t know about it:\n\nHavelock Ellis, president of the Galton Institute, who once said that “the whole religious complexion of the modern world is due to the absence from Jerusalem of a lunatic asylum.”138\n\nNorman Himes, who believed that Catholic “stock” was inferior to that of Unitarians, Universalists and Freethinkers.139 Himes also believed that all rights (including the right to life) are bestowed by the State and can be revoked at any time.140\n\nJulian Sorell Huxley was President of the English Eugenics Society and founder of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). He was a hard-core racist who wrote, “The negro mind is as different from the white mind as the negro from the white body…. You have only to go to a nigger camp-meeting to see the African mind in operation — the shrieks, the dancing and yelling and sweating, the surrender to the most violent emotion, the ecstatic blending of the soul of the Congo with the practice of the Salvation Army.”141\n\nElmer Pendell, who wrote the following in his 1951 book Population on the Loose:\n\n“The Catholics are promulgating a breeding program to gain political control in the United States. In the poorer countries, they favor war as a method of keeping population and resources in balance. In these poor countries, the denser population is denser because the dumber Catholics and dumber others are having so many dumb children — so the major influence of the Catholic’s campaign against birth control is that they trade away their smart Catholics and get dumb ones.”\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw, socialist economist and playwright, who wrote: “There is now no reasonable excuse for refusing to face the fact that nothing but a eugenics religion can save our civilization from the fate that has overtaken all previous civilizations.”142 He also supported the mass murder of people who did not “pull their weight” in society:\n\n“Are you pulling your weight in the social boat? Are you giving more trouble than you are worth? Have you earned the privilege of living in a civilized community? That is why the Russians were forced to set up an Inquisition or Star Chamber, called at first the Cheka and now the Gay Pay Oo (Ogpu), to go into these questions and “liquidate” persons who could not answer them satisfactorily.”143\n\nMarie Carmichael Stopes, one of whose husbands described her as “supersexed to a degree which was almost pathological.” She was President of the Society for Constructive Birth Control and Racial Progress. Marie Stopes International, an organization founded in the 1970s by pornographers, is so bad it makes the Planned Parenthood Federation of America look like a bunch of do-gooders by comparison.\n\nH.G. Wells, famous science fiction writer and avid anti-Catholic bigot, who raved, “Rome is the source and center of Fascism….Why do we not bomb Rome? Why do we allow these open and declared antagonists of democratic freedom to entertain their Shinto allies and organize a pseudo-Catholic destruction of democratic freedom?”144\n\n3. “The Birth Control Review does not reflect our current thinking.”\n\nPlanned Parenthood alleges that Margaret Sanger lived a long time ago, and that her thoughts and writings are not representative of the philosophy of today’s “new, improved” Planned Parenthood. As former PPFA President Faye Wattleton so lamely asserted, “No one can really interpret what Sanger meant because she’s dead.”145\n\nSorry, Faye. Sanger’s thinking was clear and explicit.\n\nNo Planned Parenthood spokesperson ― at any level ― has ever disavowed Margaret Sanger. In fact, Planned Parenthood gives its Margaret Sanger Award annually to the person that it perceives as most advancing the cause of “reproductive rights” during the previous year.\n\nWithout a doubt, Planned Parenthood still warmly embraces its founder.\n\nWattleton said, “I believe Margaret Sanger would have been proud of us today if she had seen the directions that we have most recently in this organization taken.”146 She also said, “As we celebrate the 100th birthday of Margaret Sanger, our outrageous and our courageous leader, we should be very proud of what we are and what our mission is. It is a very grand mission…abortion is only the tip of the iceberg.”147\n\nWattleton’s successor, Gloria Feldt, praised Sanger to the skies: “I can’t think of anyone who has made a greater contribution to the lives of women, children and families ― of all races ― than Margaret Sanger. You have to look at [her] life to see she had a desire to help the poor and the downtrodden of any race.”148\n\nMargaret Sanger’s grandson, Alexander C. Sanger, was President and Chief Executive Officer of Planned Parenthood of New York City, the largest PPFA affiliate in the United States. He said:\n\nI intend to be out on the front lines of our issues. That is why I’m here….Right now, we have three [abortion] clinics in this city and I want ten more. We currently have a small storefront office in central Harlem, and it is my first priority to see if we can transform that into a clinic….With all her success, my grandmother left some unfinished business, and I intend to finish it.149\n\nIn fact, Planned Parenthood adores Sanger so much they even had a “photo album” devoted to her life on its website until recently.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, an organization does not honor a person with photo albums, fawning articles, and attempts at canonization unless it embraces that person’s philosophies ― in Sanger’s case, eugenics, free love, and anti-Catholic and anti-immigrant bigotry.\n\n+ Endnotes\n\n[1] Lucia Trent, Children of Fire and Shadow.

With a rising Catholic vote, with the irresponsible and less intelligent entering into a cradle competition with the responsible and thoughtful, one wonders how long it will be before Catholicism will be dominant in this country ― with all that implies for the future decadence of freedom and intellectual honesty…. One proposition seems to me valid: Unless the forces of liberalism can organize themselves sufficiently to curb the demagoguery, intimidation, misrepresentation, and open threats of the Catholic opposition we shall soon have the iron heel of Romanism upon our throats even as it treads upon the freedom of Italian citizens today.\n\n[36] Norman E.

The Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) reprinted this book in 1965 with an introduction by Alan Guttmacher, M.D. The entire quote is:\n\nAre Catholic stocks in the United States, taken as a whole, genetically inferior to such no-Catholic libertarian stocks as Unitarians and Universalists, Ethical Culturists, Freethinkers? Inferior to non-Catholic stocks in general? No one really knows. One is entitled to his hunches, however, and my guess is that the answer will someday be made in the affirmative… and if the supposed differentials in net productivity are also genuine, the situation is anti-social, perhaps gravely so.\n\n[37] Norman E. Hines, Ph.D. Practical Birth-Control Methods [New York City: Viking Press], 1946:\n\nAll the rights we have are those granted to us by society. Certainly there is no natural right to spawn defective children who must be supported by others through taxation or charity. The crisis in this instance is the enormous expense to the state of the care of the defective classes and the contamination of the biological stock which results from their reproduction…. While sterilization is no substitute for segregation, it is also true that segregation is no substitute for sterilization. They must go hand in hand.\n\nEver since the rise of the Nazi regime in Germany an objection that has frequently been raised against eugenical sterilization is that a voluntary sterilization program may turn into a compulsory one. Some thoughtful people sincerely fear this. But the history of eugenical sterilization in the United States and in other democratic countries offers little warrant for the contention. This is the old fallacy of ultimate danger; that if we take step A, it would lead to step B; that if we take step B. it may lead to step C, and so forth without end. The evidence now available shows that even in Nazi Germany, where there is a great deal of compulsion that would not be tolerated by citizens who believe in democracy, there has been as yet no attempt to sterilize any special racial group….\n\nMost of the objections to eugenical sterilization are based upon unfounded fears, insufficient knowledge, or faulty reasoning. None of the objections has substantial merit. They are comparable to the arguments made ten years ago against birth control, even by some supposedly will-informed individuals, that birth-control devices caused sterility, necessarily led to immorality, would cause ‘race suicide,’ were unreliable, etc….\n\nWe do not need the defective classes. They are already an excessive burden upon the State. A few special students of the problem even believe that our society is undergoing a ‘moronization’ process; that the intelligence level of the American people is declining because the gifted have few children and the stupid many…. Probably it will take society a span of years to learn how to use it [eugenic sterilization] properly as a weapon for its own improvement.\n\nNOTE: Notice the author’s representation and summation of classic eugenicist theories, which, despite their antique quaintness, are still deadly poisonous to this day; that all rights are bestowed by the State alone, even to the granting (or withholding) of the right to life to handicapped persons; that “defectives” are expensive and “contaminate the biological stock,” and therefore society does not need “the defective classes;” that the slippery slope theory (here called the “ultimate danger fallacy”) has no merit, and, in fact, all anti-eugenicist arguments are baseless and originate from ignorance; and that birth control methods are reliable, do not cause physical damage, do not lead to immorality, and may one day be compulsory.\n\n[38] The Protestant, August 1931, quoted in “In the Magazines: Autocrats Urge High Birth Rates.” Birth Control Review, Volume XV, Number 9 (September 1931), page 269.\n\n[39] “Be honest, know the truth and be free.
