        "text": "No? Then welcome, stranger!\n\nWhat is that “main mystery” I just mentioned? It’s whether Eve and Hannah are two separate people (identical twins) or not (both are actually the same person).\n\nI did try to solve a few other mysteries too, and that’s why the post is so long, basically making it a novel. It includes the entire Her Story script, and three times as many words of comments.\n\nDid I solve every single little thing, did I answer every question? No, I did not. And solving everything might not ever be possible.\n\nWhy? Well, Sam Barlow and many other writers and creators — me included — are fans of Hemingway’s Iceberg Theory. And that’s what we see in Her Story.\n\nIt’s not a shocking concept. As Tolkien pointed it out in his “On Fairy Stories” essay, “The human mind is capable of forming mental images of things not actually present”.\n\nThe problem is, however, that the iceberg theory works well for fiction, but not quite as well for a spotless reconstruction of a fictional crime. With 7/8th of the data hidden, we cannot precisely reassemble the events of Her Story. Don’t get me wrong, I think it’s beautiful that Her Story went all Hemingway on us. But the cost is that there will never be a canonical or community-agreed explanation for every single little thing in the game. Which, in a way, is the point of the game.\n\nThe above is not the only reason why the exact story will remain a mystery forever, though. On top of the iceberg, a structure resides that was deliberately built to offer multiple interpretations. No matter how many times Sam Barlow claims in his interviews that it is not what he was trying to achieve, if he wanted us to know that Florence’s death could not have been a murder, he would not have had her fall down the stairs.\n\nAll these mysteries give the game longevity, but are also what makes solving all of Her Story’s secrets impossible.\n\nAnd Sam Barlow is not talking.\n\nIf so, how could I have found my answer to the main mystery, then?\n\nWell, first, that answer is: Eve and Hannah are, in my opinion, the same person.\n\nSecond, to explain the story under such filter means that every now and then we need to go for some mental gymnastics. Yup. I sometimes joke that the problem with Her Story is not that multiple hypotheses fit the story, it’s that none of them does it perfectly. And so instead of thinking of this analysis as “this is what happened”, feel free to treat it as a mental exercise of “could we make the story work for the MPD hypothesis” sort — and to that my answer is yes. Yes, we could.\n\nI dare anyone to do the same for the twins hypothesis. After you notice all the absurdities and impossibilities, ones that go way beyond a child living secretly in an attic for years, to me there’s just no way to construct a chain of events — even with the Olympic level of mental gymnastics — that works for the twins. And thus, “Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.”\n\nWhat I am saying here is that to accept that the game is about twins is to accept that Sam Barlow has made some Titanic-sized holes in his iceberg of a story. It is to accept that whatever the game is, it does not belong to a crime fiction genre, as its story — even if full of fairy tale layers and symbols of collective consciousness — is not something that could have ever happened, that could have somewhat been executable in the real world. It is to accept that the true crime element of Her Story and the actual game we are playing are nothing but a staffage sloppily manufactured, and ultimately useless.\n\nBut if this is what you choose, I have no problem with that. I have to consider the possibility I found the wrong key or at least got some of the story wrong. Sure! Maybe my explanations just mean I should be Eve’s lawyer. But there’s a more important reason for my agreement, too.\n\nMirrors are one of the key themes in Her Story. It actually starts even before you watch a single clip, with the pirated game you can find on your desktop. It’s a two player game you play alone, and the name of the game is, well, Mirror Game. (The fact you play both sides yourself may be a hint that we’re not dealing with twins. Also, you get an achievement for playing only if it ends in a tie, and nobody wins. Its description — “Not all games have winners and losers” — suggests it’s about the game itself, and not Hannah’s story, though).\n\nAnd then we also get the palindromes, a person and her real or imaginary doppelganger, actual physical mirror, and maybe the mirror of that mirror, Sarah’s reflection on the computer screen, and so much more.\n\nIs the theme of mirrors just a spice, or is it the key to the game? I believe in the latter. The game itself seems to be a mirror in which you can see yourself.\n\nThere is a whole section later in the game in which Hannah/Eve has to solve a few Thematic Apperception Test cards. Wikipedia reports that “proponents of this technique assert that a person’s responses reveal underlying motives, concerns, and the way they see the social world through the stories they make up about ambiguous pictures of people.”\n\nWith all the hypotheses out there, it sounds like a perfect description of Her Story, doesn’t it?\n\nThe real question we should be asking ourselves, then, is not “What happened?”, but “Why did I choose this particular version? Was it just cold analysis, or did I project something onto the game? If so, why? What does the game tell me about me?”\n\nAnd so if you choose twins, that’s fine with me. We’re not in court, no one’s life hangs in the balance, and the point of the game is not necessarily to find the truest of truths.\n\nAlso, you can always assume that the absurdities and impossibilities of the story are genuine mistakes and the author’s lack of scrutiny and due diligence, or that they are simply meaningless in the larger context. For example, Emily Short made a spectacular case for the twins because she believed the game was a gothic tale. Personally, I disagree, as I believe that apart from the themes we need a certain form too, and the stylization of Her Story goes exactly in the opposite, mundane direction, one that works against the necessary suspension of disbelief. But that’s just an opinion. If Emily’s interpretation satisfies her, great. It’s Her Story, too.\n\nAnd Emily is actually not that far off anyway. While not exactly a gothic tale — due to the lack of horror — Her Story is, as Eve calls it at one point, “a real life fairy tale”. Being, among other things, a game about evaluating our need for stories, Her Story reaches for the stories passed on from generation to generation: fairy tales.\n\nThe execution of this idea does not rely on filling the game with superficial references, but on making the crime of Her Story a modern re-telling of Grimms’ Rapunzel, with multiple other fairy tales fueling the side stories.\n\nTo be absolutely clear, Rapunzel is not merely referenced in Her Story.\n\nHer Story is Rapunzel.\n\nThe knowledge of this particular fairy tale — a mercifully short one — is necessary to fully understand and appreciate the core of Her Story. Here it is, then. For the clarity of its relevance to Her Story, I have merged a couple of versions into one: mainly the first edition from 1812, and the final edition from 1857. I have also replaced “fairy” and “sorceress” with one “witch”, as some translators prefer. Obviously, I have changed nothing in the story myself, it’s all still exclusively The Brothers Grimm (if you want to see how various editions differ, see this or this).\n\nIf I had to highlight every bit relevant to Her Story, I would need to highlight almost the whole tale. So for this introduction to the subject I just highlighted a few fragments I discuss right after the tale ends.\n\nRAPUNZEL\n\nOnce upon a time there was a man and a woman who had long wished for a child but had never received one. Finally, however, the woman came to be with child.\n\nThrough the small rear window of these people’s house they could see into a witch’s garden that was filled with flowers and herbs of all kinds. No one dared enter this garden.\n\nOne day the woman was standing at this window, and she saw the most beautiful rapunzel in a bed. She longed for some, but not knowing how to get any, she became miserably ill. Her husband was frightened, and asked her why she was doing so poorly.\n\n“Oh, if I do not get some rapunzel from the garden behind our house, I shall surely die,” she said.\n\nThe man, who loved her dearly, decided to get her some, whatever the cost. One evening he climbed over the high wall, hastily dug up a handful of rapunzel, and took it to his wife. She immediately made a salad from it, which she devoured greedily. It tasted so very good to her that by the next day her desire for more had grown threefold.\n\nThe man saw that there would be no peace, so once again he climbed into the garden. To his horror, the witch was standing there. She scolded him fiercely for daring to enter and steal from her garden. He excused himself as best he could with his wife’s pregnancy, and how it would be dangerous to deny her anything.\n\nFinally the witch spoke, “I will accept your excuse and even allow you to take as much rapunzel as you want, if you will give me the child that your wife is now carrying.”\n\nIn his fear the man agreed to everything. When the woman gave birth, the witch appeared, named the little girl Rapunzel, and took her away.\n\nThis Rapunzel became the most beautiful child under the sun, but when she was twelve years old, the witch locked her in a high tower that had neither a door nor a stairway, but only a tiny little window at the very top.\n\nWhen the witch wanted to enter, she stood below and called out: “Rapunzel, Rapunzel! Let down your hair to me.”\n\nRapunzel had splendid hair, as fine as spun gold. When the witch called out, she untied it, wound it around a window hook, let it fall twenty yards to the ground, and the witch climbed up it.\n\nOne day a young prince came through the forest where the tower stood. He saw the beautiful Rapunzel standing at her window, heard her sing with her sweet voice, and fell in love with her.\n\nBecause there was no door in the tower and no ladder was tall enough to reach her, he fell into despair. He came to the forest every day, until once he saw the witch, who said: “Rapunzel, Rapunzel! Let down your hair.” Then he knew which ladder would get him into the tower.\n\nHe remembered the words that he would have to speak, and the next day, as soon as it was dark, he went to the tower and called upward: “Rapunzel, Rapunzel! Let down your hair!”\n\nShe let her hair fall. He tied himself to it and was pulled up.\n\nAt first Rapunzel was frightened, but soon she came to like the young king so well that she arranged for him to come every day and be pulled up. Thus they lived in joy and pleasure for a long time.\n\nThe witch did not discover what was happening until one day Rapunzel said to her, “Mother Gothel, why is my dress getting tighter around my middle?” “You godless child,” cried the witch. “What am I hearing from you? I thought I had removed you from the whole world, but you have deceived me nonetheless.”\n\nShe was terribly angry. She took Rapunzel’s beautiful hair, wrapped it a few times around her left hand, grasped a pair of scissors with her right hand, and snip snip, cut it off. And she was so unmerciful that she took Rapunzel into a wilderness where she suffered greatly.\n\nOn the evening of the same day that she sent Rapunzel away, the witch tied the cut-off hair to the hook at the top of the tower, and when the prince called out: “Rapunzel, Rapunzel! Let down your hair!”. She let down the hair. The prince climbed up, but above, instead of his beloved Rapunzel, he found the witch, who peered at him with poisonous and evil looks.\n\n“Aha!” she cried scornfully. “You have come for your Mistress Darling, but that beautiful bird is no longer sitting in her nest, nor is she singing any more. The cat got her, and will scratch your eyes out as well. You have lost Rapunzel. You will never see her again.”\n\nThe prince was overcome with grief, and in his despair he threw himself from the tower. He escaped with his life, but the thorns into which he fell poked out his eyes.\n\nSorrowfully he wandered about in the forest weeping and, eating nothing but grass and roots.\n\nThus he wandered about miserably for some years, finally happening into the wilderness where Rapunzel lived miserably with the twins that she had given birth to. He heard a voice and thought it was familiar. He advanced toward it, and as he approached, Rapunzel recognized him, and crying, threw her arms around his neck. Two of her tears fell into his eyes, and they became clear once again, and he could see as well as before.\n\nTHE END\n\nI’m sure you can see it now.\n\nHannah is Mother Gothel. The singing princess and her golden hair is Eve the bar singer in her blonde wig. The blinded prince who fell out of the tower is Simon, dead and missing his glasses. The tower is the attic. The pregnant princess betraying Mother Gothel is the pregnant Eve betraying Hannah. The prince meeting Mother Gothel who pretends to be the princess is Simon meeting Hannah who pretends to be Eve.\n\nTo give you a concrete example of how Her Story mirrors Rapunzel…In her final interview, this is how Eve reports her fight with Hannah: “[…] She was furious. And so angry. […] I had my [blonde] wig on from performing. She tore it off.[…]” (EVE D763).\n\nAnd this is how the fight between the witch and Rapunzel is described: “She was terribly angry. She took Rapunzel’s beautiful hair, wrapped it a few times around her left hand, […], and […] cut it off.”\n\nThe witch cutting off Rapunzel’s beautiful golden hair is paralleled in Her Story as Hannah tearing off Eve’s blonde wig.\n\nThere’s more, much more, and the fairy tale even explains the puzzling inclusion of fennel, a discovery I am particularly and inexplicably proud of. I will reveal it all when I discuss the appropriate clips. For now, just remember this simple set up: Hannah is the witch, Eve is Rapunzel, Simon is the prince.\n\nDoes placing Rapunzel as the skeleton of Her Story serve a purpose?\n\nYes, but I don’t think it’s as effective as in the original. Recorded by The Brothers Grimm, the fairy tale is a story of a sexual awakening, a story of a young girl imprisoned by the old and the repressive inside the phallic structure, making it the most accurate cock block ever. When the girl reaches maturity, symbolized by her hair growing long enough for the prince to be able to reach her, ultimately she enjoys the circle of life pleasures despite the temporary setbacks.\n\nSimilar themes can be seen in Her Story: at the end of the game, a sex-happy personality takes over her Puritan doppelganger, and with her daughter Sarah the circle of life continues. On top of that, the Rapunzel skeleton is nicely supported by the muscles of Jungian archetypical events: birth, death, separation from parents, initiation, marriage, the union of opposites. However, the whole theme is ultimately pushed back to play second fiddle to the mysteries of identity and how well we know ourselves, and that inner conflict and the focus trouble are not necessarily working in the game’s favor.\n\nRapunzel 2015 Remix is presented in what I earlier called a mundane form. The metaphors are sold to us as an ascetic police interrogation, and through computer keyboard clicks and video files transcoded from VHS tapes.\n\nObviously, the mundane does not mean the game is a documentary. It exists within certain slightly Hollywood-like reality, just like most crime fiction. And its world is not exactly our world, it’s only 99% compatible, as Sam messed with the dates and places a bit to protect himself from any confusion this was about real people (you can find this information in this podcast, around 1:05).\n\nHow many hypotheses could explain the main secret of Her Story?\n\nQuoting Wikipedia, Lewis’s trilemma is “[…] sometimes described as the “Lunatic, Liar, or Lord” […] argument. It takes the form of a trilemma — a choice between three options, each of which is in some way difficult to accept.”\n\nIt happens that main hypotheses behind Hannah and Eve are exactly this, Lewis’ trilemma.\n\nThe twins in this case are the “Lord”, and things happened as Eve described them in her final interview. Ultimately, after all the lies she is finally telling the truth, and that is the final literal layer of the story.\n\nThe “Lunatic” is the hypothesis that Hannah suffers from a slightly Hollywooded version of the MPD, multiple personality disorder, nowadays known as DID, dissociative identity disorder. I keep using the MPD acronym in this post, it’s just more visually clear to me.\n\nAnd the “Liar” is about Eve as a genius psychopath, fucking with the police. This one also includes a slightly milder version, that Eve is just an obsessively jealous, pathological story-teller, a princess betrayed — and she just tries to avoid a penalty for the murder of her husband. I keep both under the single “genius psychopath” umbrella.\n\nIf Eve is not the Lord, is she the Lunatic or the Liar?\n\nI honestly wanted it to be the Liar. I was invested in this hypothesis for days. Genius psychopaths I love, be in Hannibal Lecter or Keyser Söze. And Sam Barlow cites Basic Instinct as one of his influences.\n\nBut after carefully analyzing the evidence, I just don’t see it. The story flows much better with the MPD, and becomes, as writers call it, “dirty” with Hannah the Genius Psychopath. This subgenre of genius criminals is about outsmarting the police and bragging about it, not about ultimately failing to confuse them. The logic of it just does not work: Hannah/Eve wouldn’t masterfully lead the detectives on for so long only to spin such a delusional tale in her final interview. Also, later I found out the creator was not interested in such an aspect anyway:\n\nThen I kind of wanted it to be about the twins. I am fascinated with bias and rationalization, so it felt compelling to me to have a story in which everything is revealed and in front of you, and that’s exactly why you refuse to accept it, and you look for a deeper meaning, constructing wild hypotheses just because “it couldn’t be that simple”. But, as I mentioned it earlier, elements of the story made so little sense if that story was about the twins, that I had to give up on the idea.\n\nAlso, if it is the twins, there is no mystery. Seventy-one clips of the final interview almost all talk about the twins — plus fragments of the sixth interview — and that is over one-fourth of the entire game. With the way the game is structured, it is almost impossible not to stumble upon twins relatively soon into the investigation. And if things happened as they are presented, then after a short while basically the whole game is nothing but figuring out words to just hear more details on what you already know. Is that all that Sam Barlow has created?\n\nMy hesitation towards the MPD was mostly due to the fact that such solution felt a little tired to me. It was unfair, as twins or a genius psychopath would change absolutely nothing here. These ideas have also been often used, if not more. Mankind produced millions of stories already, and so nihil sub sole novum.\n\nBut I quickly realized that most MPD movies or books are about personalities represented as visually unique people — take Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde or Fight Club for example — but not as identical twins. Suddenly, Her Story felt fresh.\n\nTo be absolutely clear, my conclusion that we are dealing with the MPD is not based on my wishes. On the contrary, as I said, initially I did not want the story to be about the MPD. It’s also not based on second guessing the designer, although that always plays a part and I did go for it every now and then. Sill, my findings are mostly based on the evidence and logic.\n\nIt’s worth noting that multiple (most?) clips in the game work nicely with both MPD and the twins hypotheses. The game is full of moments like this. If it weren’t, this post would not have any need to exist.\n\nA couple of important notes before we finally begin.\n\nOne, Sam worked on the script itself for six months. The total number of video clips is 271, and some of them are as short as “Yes” and “No”. With such amount of time dedicated to what is basically a novelette (and on a shorter side) it is safe to assume, then, that nothing is accidental, and everything matters.\n\nHowever, because of the construction of the game, some clips might feature odd remarks or be injected with extra fat just to feature a word or a phrase that Sam wanted to bring to our attention, so we could then use them to move the investigation forward. For example, did Eve really need to talk about mirrors in EVE D102, or was just Sam having us notice the “mirror” word? For the purpose of this analysis, I have decided to ignore the suspicions of artificial injection of words, and treat everything as if it truly mattered and had a non-gameplay meaning. It’s just more fun this way.\n\nTwo, you will see WHY NOT TWINS? tag every now and then. I explain what’s the issue with the clip if Hannah and Eve were twins. I use this tag only when there is such issue. If there’s no problem with the twins hypothesis, and the clip could totally work for the twins too, I do not use the tag.\n\nSo, if this tag is missing in the comment under a clip, it means there’s a fairly easy interpretation under the twins angle — easy enough not to require elaboration (and this analysis is long enough as it is). The only exception from this rule is the seventh interview.\n\nSometimes, despite the tag, with some mental gymnastics you maybe could explain what happened. But not in all cases. You will see.\n\nThree, the clips are tagged as: the character plus the clip’s filename in the PC version, e.g. EVE D720 means that it’s Eve talking, and her video file is D720.avi. You can find all video files inside ..\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\HER STORY\\HerStory_Data\\StreamingAssets folder, but these are the subtitle-less versions.\n\nIf you want subtitles, you can see all seven interviews in order here (big thanks to AppUnwrapper for their hard work).\n\nFour, the analysis looks at the game under two angles: the crime fiction one and the subtext one.\n\nFive, please excuse any language errors — English is not my first language.\n\nNote the cold white light used when the police interview Hannah, and warmer yellow light for Eve.\n\nInterview 1: Eve— June 18th (Sunday)\n\nEVE D101: A black coffee, thanks. No sugar. I’m sweet enough as it is.\n\nWHY NOT TWINS? That the game is called Her Story and not Their Story might be the first hint we’re dealing with just one woman. But since the title can be explained away as being the story of Sarah’s mother, let’s move on and talk about the first clip of the game instead.\n\nWe have to ask ourselves this one crucial question: what exactly was the plan of the twins when they went to the police?\n\nThe obvious answer is: for Hannah to use her twin sister Eve as her alibi. If people saw Eve, thinking she’s Hannah, somewhere else at the time of the murder, then that is an airtight alibi for Hannah, right? If people saw her in Glasgow, she could not have been at her home at the same time, killing Simon. Jackpot, good plan, Hannah goes free.\n\nOkay, fine, but …why do you need both twins to keep pulling the switcheroo during these seven police interviews? One twin is enough and much safer for a consistent testimony, right? Why send a pregnant woman and risk the reveal of the baby?\n\nHere is my attempt to explain the switcheroo:\n\nThe twins send Eve to the first interview. Hannah had a fresh bruise, and that would immediately make her a suspect and result in pre-mature search of the house. She is also vulnerable and possibly still in shock after murdering Simon, so it makes sense to send Eve instead of her.\n\nOnce Eve simply reported Simon missing during the first interview, a week later it’s time for a more serious Q&A with the police. Obviously, Hannah has the advantage here. She knows her own life better. The twins send Hannah.\n\nSimon’s body was finally found. Might be tough for Hannah to handle the interview. Eve is stronger. And she didn’t kill Simon, so won’t be as emotional. Let’s send Eve.\n\nHannah is fine now. It’s always safer to have her interrogated by the police in case they have tricky family and relationship questions. Time for Hannah to shine.\n\nUh oh, the police asked about the guitar at the end of the last interview. They will surely want Hannah to play it, but it’s Eve who is the bar singer. The twins need to send Eve again.\n\nThe police might be catching on that Hannah and Eve are twins. Just in case, let’s send Hannah, the actual wife of Simon, maybe that will make the police reconsider the idea.\n\nThat did not help. The police are closing in. Time to flee. There’s only Eve now.\n\nThis is the best I can do. But, for example, the switch from four to five is due to the guitar, collected by the police from the crime scene (i.e. Hannah’s house, confirmed by Sam himself in this interview), and that brings us the question: what was Eve’s guitar doing in Hannah’s house? That is easily answered when Hannah and Eve are the same person living under the same roof, but if they are twins living separately, co-operating to protect one of them from jail… Not so much.\n\nOr, another issue is that while Hannah can get a bit angry every now and then, she shows no fear whatsoever, and is well composed most of the time. For example, she shows no expected reaction when talking about or even examining the alleged murder weapon, the mirror. That puts the third and the fourth switch into question.\n\nBut this is not the biggest weaknesses of the switcheroo. So let’s finally talk about the coffee.\n\nWe know that the twins worked very hard to copy each other with everything they did and everything that happened to one of them (EVE D734-EVE D735), even more than they needed to (“We lived a second life through those rules. Rules for things that could only ever happen inside our imaginations.”)\n\nWe also know from the other interviews that, with one exception, Hannah drinks tea with sugar, while Eve drinks black coffee with no sugar. Hannah has her hair up, Eve has her hair down. For the first four interviews, Eve wears a necklace, and Hannah does not.\n\nSo… They were mirroring each other for many years, knew everything about their lives, but Eve has not learned whether Hannah preferred tea or coffee or what kind of hairdo she prefers?\n\nSince the sisters did not have to mirror each other for the last ten years, let’s assume for a second that Eve has simply forgotten all of these things. And hey, she is the sloppy one. She is a bad driver, she cannot use the knock code properly, she spills the coffee.\n\nBut we’re talking about a desperate fight for one’s life here. Wouldn’t you go above and beyond to make sure that the police never realized they were dealing with twins? Both twins are able to memorize the events of the day (HANNAH D416 and EVE D502), but no “by the way, I asked for coffee with no sugar, so make sure you do the same” or “what kind of hairdo and clothes we should go for”? Nothing of the sort for the next four interviews, no effort to look and behave consistently as one person? Despite having plenty of time to do so, as Hannah stopped going to work (HANNAH D202) and Eve does not exactly have a day job?\n\nThe sisters make sure that whoever goes to the police wears the wedding ring, so apparently they do pay attention and care about the details. And yet somehow at the same time they totally do not. It just makes no sense.\n\nOne could argue that the switcheroo and inconsistencies in drinks and looks are for our benefit. All of that exists just so we, the players, can notice these things. Fine, but that weakens the game, removing its pseudo-realism and turning the thrill of investigating a flesh and blood human being into an odd task of investigating the creator’s mind.\n\nWhatever is the case, much stronger evidence against the twins hypothesis will come to light later in this analysis. This was just a warm up. /END\n\nSo what is really happening here, then, under the MPD angle?\n\nHannah is the core personality (host) and Eve is the alternative one (alter).\n\nHannah is aware of Eve and has a “love/hate relationship” with her (HANNAH D434). She thinks of Eve as her friend, but not her sister: at one point of her final testimony (EVE D762), Eve recalls: “[…] She called me sister on the phone. She never calls me that.” It is also likely that deep down Hannah knows that Eve does not exist physically.\n\nTo understand Her Story is to understand that we see the following three narrators in the game:\n\nHannah. Hannah is Hannah, a woman who killed her husband and is trying to get away with it by using her alternate personality’s trip to Glasgow as her alibi. This is who we see in the second, fourth, and sixth interview.\n\nEve, Hannah’s second personality, convinced she is Hannah’s secret twin sister, but pretending to be Hannah. This is who we see in the first, third, and fifth interview.\n\nEve being Eve, Hannah’s second personality believing to be Hannah’s secret twin sister, now out in the open. Eve is this narrator only in the final interview. Not everything she says in the final interview is true, but she is personally convinced it is all true. In her eyes, she is not lying anymore.\n\nThe reason it’s crucial to remember this is that each time we see an interview, the character’s motivation and perspective changes. Understanding this helps us explain the things they say and do.\n\nAs I said, Eve one hundred percent believes to be Hannah’s twin sister. In reality, she is not. The “twins mirroring each other” is how Eve personality deals with the change and rationalizes the accidental or purposeful changes in appearance or health.\n\nWhen Eve takes over, there is indeed a need for her to know about and understand Hannah’s life — and vice versa. There would be no years of perfectly copying each other, but there would be — there was, still is — a diary that helped both personalities go through life (we will talk more about the diary when Eve mentions it soon).\n\nThe personalities are as much synchronized as they report to each another through the diary and other means of imperfect communication. Nothing is of the same level of synchronization as one that could be achieved if they were two separate physical beings plotting and scheming to save one of them from jail. Eve and Hannah try their best — even memorize the events of the day — but it’s not enough.\n\nAs much as we can consider the screw ups with the drinks or hairdos explained, what about the switcheroo itself? It’s unclear to me from the story whether Eve has any means of bringing Hannah out, or if this happens spontaneously only. It’s possible that the reasons for this or that personality appearing at the police station are as described before for the twins hypothesis, and it’s just the question of whether this was an internal struggle that brought the appropriate personality out, or a deliberate activity.\n\nFor a moment, I considered one more possibility here. Eve knows that Hannah is out of control. That Hannah solves her problems with murder, just as in the grim and brutal fairy tales she read as a child and still has her head filled with. Hannah tried to kill Eve as a child, possibly killed Florence, killed her parents, killed Simon. This behavior is a danger to the baby, one that Eve herself carries, and one that is a child of Simon, the beloved of both personalities. Not to mention that Hannah faces a serious jail time, and that’s not the best place imaginable to raise the baby.\n\nEve, then, wants both to avoid jail and take over the body of Hannah to protect the baby. To achieve her goals, she sabotages the interviews in order for the detectives to buy into the twins hypothesis, scare Hannah into eternal exile, and live happily ever after as a mother of Sarah.\n\nIt would explain so many things so nicely! After all, the reveals all look a bit like they are done on purpose to make the detectives discover on their own that they were dealing with twins. Such a discovery would make the detectives feel clever and perceptive, and thus got them invested in their findings. Exactly as it happened to many players, righteously excited they noticed the coffee and the hair and the necklace.\n\nAnd if nothing helps, hey, we can always “accidentally” spill some coffee and reveal the tattoo, right?\n\nHowever, the serious weakness of such hypothesis is that it requires for Eve to be aware that she is not a person, but a persona — otherwise the sabotage does not make much sense. While that awareness is technically possible, I do not see any supporting evidence in the story of it being the case. If anything, it’s rather Hannah who knows that Eve might not be real. Eve stays delusional until the end.\n\nShades between the base MPD hypothesis and the murderous Hannah one are possible, though. For example, Eve might not have been sabotaging the interviews, but both personalities might have agreed at the end of the evaluation of their lives that Hannah endangered the baby and needed to go. Who knows? As I said, some things we might never be able to fully figure out.\n\nOn the symbolic level, the sexy Eve has her hair untied, down — just like Rapunzel. Hannah, on the other hand, has her hair up, it’s practical and without any sexual vibe. She is Mother Gothel, representing the repressed and the puritan.\n\nEVE D102: My name is Hannah. H-A-N-N-A-H. It’s a palindrome. It reads the same backwards as forwards. It doesn’t work if you mirror it, though, it’s not quite symmetrical. But, well, you get the idea. Sorry! Hannah Smith. I live at thirty one Gladstone Street.\n\nWHY NOT TWINS? Eve plays with the wedding ring. She has no reason to have this habit, she is not the married one and she just has the ring on her hand — borrowed from Hannah — for a couple of hours maybe. She is not playing with the ring as if she had an allergic reaction to it, she is subconsciously playing with it as it’s an old habit of that body.\n\nYou could try to argue it’s for show — but why? What would be the purpose of that? — but then Eve also plays with ring during the final interview, except she is not wearing the ring at the time. Habit. /END\n\nOut of all palindrome names — Ana, Elle, Ada, etc. — Sam Barlow has chosen Hannah and Eve. It might just be a question of aesthetics, and the options are not in abundance anyway. However, the later reveal of the tattoo — an apple and a snake — offers us an intriguing biblical key.\n\nIn the Bible, Hannah was an infertile woman, jealous of her husband’s other wife, one that, unlike her, was actually able to conceive. Eve, on the other hand, is often depicted as a temptress, a man’s second love (after Lilith), and someone sentenced for her part in the transgression to travail in childbirth. Finally, in Hebrew, Sarah means “princess”, and “princes and princesses” are the running theme in the game.\n\nThe mundane question for this particular clip, though, is: why would Eve feel the need to talk so much about Hannah’s name? Well, we know that Eve lies about being Hannah. And “unnecessary elaboration” is just something liars do.\n\nInterestingly enough, both Eve and Hannah have a tell, the one I mentioned just a couple of paragraphs earlier. They play with the wedding ring as if their life depended on it whenever they are nervous about something.\n\nDoes that mean they do it whenever they lie? Not necessarily. For example, later Eve plays with the ring when answering “No” to the question if Simon committed suicide. I think we can safely assume that Simon did not take his own life by slashing his throat, and so Eve was telling the truth. I think that the ring is more like a polygraph, then: unable to tell if a person lies, but betraying the person’s emotions about a subject. And it’s put in the game so we pick up on it and then have our faces melt when Eve plays with the non-existent ring in the final interview.\n\n(For the record, my list of the clips in which Hannah and Eve play with the ring is: EVE D102, EVE D115, HANNAH D224, EVE D307–308, EVE D330, EVE D340, EVE D342, EVE D350, HANNAH D431, HANNAH D433, EVE D522, EVE D763–764.)\n\n“It doesn’t work if you mirror it, though, it’s not quite symmetrical”. True. Hannah’s mirror image, Eve, might be her identical twin — real or imaginary — but she’s not her carbon copy. Some of her traits and quirks are actually the exact opposite of Hannah’s. Exactly like HANNAH in the mirror is almost the same, but not quite, with some elements flipped 180 degrees.\n\nEVE D103: Simon. Simon Smith. He works at Ernst Brothers Glass. They do windows, all kinds of glass. Simon does the more special work. Mirror making, feature windows. Artistic things. Really beautiful things.\n\nWe see Eve expressing her love for Simon’s work. He impresses her. But that affection goes well beyond this, Eve ends this interview with “I love him so much”. Rapunzel did love her prince.\n\nEVE D104: A mobile phone? Yeah. Well, they have one for the glaziers but it’s only for work. I can’t remember the number. It’s in the kitchen. I saw it plugged in to its charging cradle.\n\nMobile phones were doing just fine in 1994, so that’s not an anachronism.\n\nSo, Eve knows that Simon’s mobile phone is in the house. Actually, most likely both Hannah and Eve do, as the eerily xeroxed, “rehearsed” statements from both Hannah (HANNAH D416) and Eve (EVE D502) mention scanning the kitchen in search of the husband: “I walked straight into the kitchen because he usually sits in there to have a cup of tea and read his paper. But he wasn’t there. I touched the kettle. It was cold. […]”.\n\nWe can ask ourselves, then, why in the next interview Hanna wonders “why hasn’t [Simon] phoned?” — she knows very well he does not have his phone with him. Is it because she did not know that Eve mentioned his mobile phone being in the house?\n\nOf course, I am just having fun here, as the inconsistency can be easily explained away (Simon could have called from a pay phone). More importantly, we know exactly that Hannah and Eve know why the phone was in the house, “plugged in to its charging cradle”, and why Simon “hasn’t phoned”. He’s dead.\n\nThen there’s also EVE D332, in which Eve says “[…] I woke up because a rubbish truck went past. I got some petrol, bought a coffee and a pastry. Tried calling Simon from a pay phone and then headed back.” She does not remember Simon’s phone as it’s “only for work” — and apparently does not have it written down, as she is unable to give it to the police — plus she knew that Simon’s phone was in the house, and yet she tried calling him?\n\nBut, as previously, it can easily be explained away, e.g. that by “tried calling Simon” she merely meant “I called home”. Which she actually did, it’s just that she was trying to call Hannah, not Simon (EVE D764).\n\nEVE D105: Um, Simon is six foot. Darkish blonde hair. Average build. He’s clean shaven. If his beard grows it goes ginger so he shaves it, I mean, not that there’s anything wrong with ginger hair! Uh, I brought a photo. They said I should bring a photo. This was taken last year on holiday in Rome. It’s the best one I have.\n\nWe keep seeing Eve being unable not to tell a story, an anecdote about whatever she is asked about. The “unnecessary elaboration”.\n\nIt is easy to see that the “holiday in Rome” is an Easter Egg, pointing to Sam’s earlier indie game called Aisle. A must play for anyone interested in story-telling in games, by the way. It’s free, it’s clever, it’s as long as you want it to be, it’s here.\n\nAlso, funny, Sam! Ginger beard, gingerbread… (Hansel and Gretel).\n\nEVE D106: No, he doesn’t have any tattoos. He has a scar down here near his stomach. Past his hip. Cut himself with some glass. That was before… A long time ago. He looks just like the photo. He’s not got his glasses on here, though. He takes them off for the camera. But he needs them to see properly. You know, when he has to read. A newspaper or a menu in a restaurant. Not books so much. Or watching TV. He likes TV.\n\nIt’s weird that Simon needs his glasses for a newspaper but not for a book. Not sure how that works.\n\nAnyway, let’s notice that Eve avoids mentioning something specific here, with “That was before… A long time ago.” There can be so many reasons for this, so we should not even attempt a speculation (but my bet is on “…before he met me, Eve”). What’s important is that this is an example of Eve thinking of Simon one way, but then correcting herself to pretend Hannah’s perspective on things.\n\nSimon’s scar, one due to an old accident involving glass, is a foreshadowing of Simon’s death.\n\nEVE D107: He was wearing, um, a shirt. A blue turtle neck shirt and jeans. He has a watch. It’s a really nice one. That was a gift from his boss Eric. He had his coat. A long grey duffel coat like Paddington Bear. But he would have taken that with him. It’s not in the house.\n\nNote how Eve closes her eyes when she recalls the clothes that Simon was wearing. It’s because she saw how he looked like when or after he was murdered, and she is now digging into this memory. Then she makes sure the detectives remember the watch. When she talks about the coat, she knows it is gone — she probably got rid of it herself.\n\nWhen Eve talks about the watch and the coat, she is no longer trying to recall a memory. It is obvious for the coat, but for the watch it might mean that Simon was not wearing it as well when Hannah confronted him. So it’s possible Eve not only set the time better suited for the alibi, but also put the watch on Simon’s wrist.\n\nMost of the clothes that Hannah-Eve wears are blue, and here we have a mention of “blue turtle neck shirt and jeans”. It’s probably accidental, though. The symbolism of blue is so all over the place — from sadness and depression to strength and endurance — that applying any deeper meaning seems pointless.\n\nIt might be easier to explain the dominant colors of the game’s key art: white, black, red and blue.\n\nThe inspiration behind such choice might come from Homicide: Life on the Streets, a TV series that Sam Barlow often mentions in his interviews as being a major inspiration behind Her Story.\n\nIn that series, the detectives use a white board and red markers for open cases, black markers for closed cases, and blue markers for re-opened cases. Translating that to Her Story, its key art could symbolize the player’s journey and judgment: the constant shift of opinion depending on the recent information (opening — red — and reopening — blue — the case) and the final judgment: Hannah guilty (black) or innocent (white, as Eve’s clothes in her final interview).\n\nI think I read someone believing there were some inconsistencies in Eve’s description of the watch on this and one other occasion. I do not see it. EVE D334: “Yeah, that’s Simon’s watch. It was a gift from Eric. He got it this year. It was a wedding anniversary gift. Steel. […]” seems not to contradict anything that Eve talked about here, and vice versa.\n\nI mean, we could also try to establish whether the wedding date is later in the year than Hannah’s birthday, and if so, Eric could have gotten the watch “this year”, but a) I don’t think we have enough data to attempt that, b) it is unlikely that Eve would ever lie about where the watch came from, as that is easily verifiable by the police (and they would do so, considering the importance of the watch).\n\nAs for the “steel” remark, I don’t see it being about the anniversary itself. A steel one is eleven years of marriage, but it’s an obscure reference no one would really use in a conversation, at least not without elaborating on it. It’s about the watch. The remark is here to make sure we understand the watch was not silver.\n\nFinally, Simon’s “long grey duffel coat like Paddington Bear” is an allusion to Grimms’ Bearskin fairy tale about a man wearing the skin of a bear. “Then [the devil] pulled the skin off the bear and said, “This shall be your cloak, and your bed as well, for you are to sleep on it, and you are not allowed to lie in any other bed. Because of your clothing you shall you be called Bearskin.”” The tale includes other elements of Her Story — the romance, the ring, the kiss, and even the glass.\n\nEVE D108: So it was Friday evening. We had an argument. He left on Saturday, he didn’t come back. I waited all day. He was supposed to go help Eric out with something on the Saturday afternoon, they had a job. He didn’t show. So Eric was ringing on the phone. I checked at The Rock — that’s our local. They said they’d seen him on the Friday night but not since. He still wasn’t back this morning which just isn’t like him at all. Still not back by dinner time, it’s getting dark again, so I decided to come see you. His parents haven’t heard anything either.\n\nWe know how Eve lies here about what happened on Friday and Saturday. It’s not clear which phone Eric was ringing: their home one, or Simon’s mobile one (but both were in the house).\n\nIn the next interview, Hanna will say (HANNAH D228): “Oh God. I don’t know. I mean, I guess The Rock? You’ve spoken to everyone there? Someone must have seen where he went. […]”. Why does she suggest The Rock if she has already checked it herself? But this is easy to explain away — she never says she talked to everybody when she went to The Rock — and does not matter much anyway.\n\nNote how Eve refers to Simon’s parents as “Simon’s parents”. This happens a few more times. Meanwhile, Hannah calls them — as we see later — by name, “Doug and Eleanor”. It’s because Hannah knows Simon’s parents very well, personally, and Eve does not.\n\nEVE D109: It’s the Rockington Arms. The Rock. It’s run by a nice couple Peter and Susan. There’s some other regulars there that Simon likes to drink with. And the barmaid they have in sometimes, Helen. Peter said Simon had been in and had a few drinks.\n\nI’m pretty sure that’s accidental but I like how it’s one pub of two names, and how all new people mentioned here have all two same letters in their names: P(e)t(e)r, (S)u(s)an, H(e)l(e)n. Hah!\n\nEVE D110: No. I think he spoke to Helen. She said he was upset about our argument but I’m not sure what else he said. He likes Helen. He likes blondes.\n\nThis helps us with the timeline. There was an argument between Hannah and Simon, and then Simon went to the pub (no room for a lie here, the pub is easily verifiable by the police). Then, after a few drinks, Simon got back home and got murdered.\n\nOf course, the other important bit of info is that Simon had a thing for blondes. Note how Eve is gently smiling when she says it.\n\nEVE D111: It was married couple stuff. A stupid argument, nothing specific. No one knows how to push your buttons better than those you’re close to.\n\nThat last sentence is true for both Hannah and Simon, and Hannah and Eve. Pushing the buttons even resulted in Hannah’s attempt to kill Eve (HANNAH D434, accident at the beach).\n\nEVE D112: No. I mean yes. We have arguments. But he never runs off. He always comes back, we make up. It’s always that way.\n\nEve initially replies with “No.” to the assumed “Do you argue with your husband?” kind of question because she and Simon never had the time to develop the relationship and settle into its later, more mundane phase. Their romance was fresh and exciting. Hannah, on the other hand, got married ten years ago, so she surely must have argued with Simon every now and then — and thus Eve corrects herself.\n\nEVE D113: A long time. We got married when I was seventeen.\n\nLater Hannah allows us to understand that “a long time” means ten years: “When you’ve been married for ten years stuff accumulates. […]” (HANNAH D213). Two plus two means Hannah is 27 years old.\n\nEVE D114: Childhood sweethearts? Something like that. Are you married, detective?\n\nNot sure why Eve would ask that question in the first place, but maybe it’s just her playfulness at work — she is the sexy extrovert, after all. The important thing is that later, Hannah asks the same detective the very same question (HANNAH D426), apparently unaware that Eve had already done so.\n\nEVE D115: Suicide? No. He would never do anything like that. He’s not the kind of person to do anything like that. To hurt himself? No.\n\nSimon never had any suicidal tendencies, but we cannot be so sure about Hannah. We know she tried to kill Eve, i.e. squeeze the life out of her own body, at least once (HANNAH D434). I speculate about the second attempt later at EVE D526, and this speculation may explain why Eve plays with the wedding ring when she talks about the suicide.\n\nAs for Simon himself, in most versions of Rapunzel the price is not pushed out of the tower by the witch, but jumps out himself — which does suggest a suicide. But Simon had no reason for the suicide, and slashing his own throat does not sound like a method most people would choose.\n\nEVE D116: No. Not drugs. I mean he drinks. But never very much. He goes to the pub and has one or two. Sometimes we go together. He has wine with food. But no, he doesn’t have any kind of drinking problem.\n\n“Sometimes we go together” might be an allusion to Eve and Simon’s romance. They met at a bar. More importantly, this cements the earlier mentioned The Rock as Simon’s usual spot, where he has “one or two”. This is one of the hints that when Simon met Eve for the first time at the bar where she had her singer gig, he wasn’t randomly bar-hopping around town. It’s just not his lifestyle. He simply followed his wife one day after learning about her second life.\n\nEVE D117: Yes. There’s a car that we share. A Cavalier. And a van he uses for work. It’s owned by Eric but we look after it. Both of them are there now, parked on the street. I’m not sure about the keys for the van. I can look for you when I get back.\n\nWe learn that Simon has his own work car, and both Simon and Hannah share the Cavalier. Unbeknownst to Simon for a long time, Hannah and Eve also share the Cavalier. Eve has “a spare set” (she doesn’t, it’s Hannah’s keys, but that’s what she believes).\n\nLater, Hannah and Eve mention that the Cavalier is “parked down the road” because “the street was busy” after she got back from Glasgow, but technically there’s no inconsistency here. Eve does not say here that the cars are parked directly in front of the house.\n\nIt’s possible that Sam Barlow chose the Cavalier as the family car to keep with the theme of fairy tale princes and princesses.\n\nEVE D118: No. I’m not sure what strange would be but he hasn’t been acting odd. He’s been busy at his work but nothing too stressful.\n\nAnd yet later Eve will say “There was Simon with me and the Simon with her. It was almost like it was a different Simon.” But to Hannah, Simon was not acting odd indeed. She realized something was going on only shortly before his death.\n\nEVE D119: Sure. Yes. Of course. If that would help. Will you phone the house to let me know when you want to come around? Then I can make sure I’m there.\n\nAnother innocent statement that might not be innocent at all, if it’s about Hannah or Even not wanting to be compromised in some way by an unannounced police visit. But if throughout all interviews we can see both Hannah and Eve talking to the police, what’s the difference which personality meets the detectives at Hannah’s house?\n\nI can see at least five specific possibilities (e.g. maybe wanting to move the body or hide it better if the police were really about to visit Hannah, or maybe making sure the makeup on the bruise is applied, etc.), but to be honest none of them is any better than simply assuming that Eve is courteous here or generally wants to be prepared when the police come — whether she is Hannah or Eve at a time.\n\nEVE D120: He has a wallet. A huge silly thing. Leather. Real leather, I think. He packs it full of stuff, business cards, receipts, lottery tickets. He always carries it in his back pocket. I think that’s why he’s got a bad back. Offsets the discs. I haven’t seen it so he must have it on him. He always takes it out of his back pocket before… When he comes in, if he’s in the house.\n\nAnother time when Eve almost slips and finishes the “before…” as Eve, not Hannah (my bet is on “…before he takes off his pants”, considering her cheeky smile when she says it).\n\nEVE D121: Yes, that would be in his wallet. It’s a Visa. A silver one. He doesn’t like to spend money he doesn’t have so he usually pays with cash, but Eric convinced him to get one.\n\nSilver Visa is not really silver, so it’s not like Hannah slashed Simon’s throat with the credit card.\n\nThe history of his Visa’s transactions is probably how the police found out that Simon has been to Oxford.\n\nEVE D122: Sure. I think. I do all the bills and paperwork and handle all the money stuff so… Should be easy for me to find. Do you want them dropped off to you?\n\nEve mentions it here that Hannah handles the boring stuff, and so does Hannah herself in the next interview (HANNAH D216): “[…] I worked part time in the front shop. […]. I took care of paperwork, filing things, typing out invoices, that kind of thing. […]”\n\nThat does not look too interesting to me, though. The “that kind of thing” mannerism is slightly more exciting — Eve and Hannah both often use that phrase (or its variant, “that sort of thing”). Although I am probably reading too much into it, and it’s the phrase that feels natural and does not raise any alarms to a native speaker. It just sounded odd to me personally, especially considering the frequency of its use.\n\nWe can safely assume that the financial documents were delivered to the police, then analyzed. That is how the police found out about the speeding ticket or the Oxford trip.\n\nEVE D123: Yes! There’s an Amstrad one. No one uses it for much. There’s a printer so you can write letters on it. Simon sometimes plays games. You know, climb the tower, save the princess. That kind of thing.\n\nThere we go. That kind of thing.\n\nThe prince climbing the tower is also another Rapunzel reference. The symbolic layer of “Simons sometimes plays games” is that Simon felt the need to save the beloved one (“save the princess”) despite serious obstacles (“climb the tower”). This translates to not only him marrying and living with Hannah despite her MPD (although he might not have been fully aware of its consequences for a long time), but actually trying to embrace both of her personalities.\n\nEVE D124: No, he doesn’t keep a diary. That’s my thing. I’ve kept one well as long as I can remember. Since I was a girl. Helps make sense of my day. When you’re forced to put something into words… Just gives you perspective. Everyone’s on the same page.\n\nReinforced and mirrored by Eve in the final interview (EVE D734): “[…] And we were very careful. Whoever had been out that day would come back and write a detailed diary, so that we were on the same page.”\n\nWHY NOT TWINS? Why does Hannah (or Eve pretending to be Hannah, but speaking for herself this time) keep writing the diary (“Helps make sense of my day”)? The twins split ten years ago, there’s no need for the diary anymore.\n\nIt could be explained as the force of habit, and that’s not a bad assumption — but no clip communicates this to us in any way, direct or indirect. And there would be no need to add the “everyone’s on the same page” remark, as wanting not to be on the same page anymore was exactly the reason why the sisters split and finally lead their own, separate lives. /END\n\nHannah and Eve use the diary for the personas to “make sense” out of what happens while they are hidden, and get “perspective” on it to make sure that “everyone’s on the same page.” Hannah started writing that diary when she was a girl, and never stopped (“Helps make sense of my day”).\n\nEVE D125: Simon isn’t the type to run off or do anything crazy. Someone must have done something to him or there must have been some kind of accident. So what do we do next?\n\nEve nicely mentions two things separated by “or”, while in reality it should be “and”. Someone did something to Simon, and it was an accident. Well …probably an accident.\n\nEVE D126: Yeah, thanks. Please find Simon. I love him so much.\n\n“I love him so much”, a bit of an awkward phrase to end a police interview with. Eve adds it, believing the police should believe in Hannah the loving wife, incapable of hurting her husband. But it is also Eve herself, expressing her feelings for Simon.\n\nInterview 2: Hannah—June 25th (Sunday)\n\nThe important thing to remember is not to analyze only what happens during the interviews, but also what happens between them. What were the detectives doing? What did they possibly learn, and how they acted upon that knowledge?\n\nAfter the previous interview, the police got the financial documents from Hannah, “the bills and paperwork”. For this interview, the body is not found yet, but it must be clear to the police that they might have a case here: a week has passed, but Simon is nowhere to be found. Was he murdered, was he in an accident, did he just leave his old life and run away?\n\nFor now there’s no need for the police to go nuclear on Hannah. From their perspective, nothing truly suspicious happened during the first interview. But it’s time to learn more about her and Simon’s lives. A spouse is always the default suspect in the case of a missing husband or wife.\n\nHANNAH D201: Could I have a cup of tea?\n\nHi, Hannah.\n\nHANNAH D202: I haven’t been in to work. I’ve been… I mean… I guess I’ve just been waiting. Waiting to hear from you. Hear from my husband.\n\nSlip of the tongue. She first mentions “waiting to hear from you”, the police. She’s not really waiting to hear from her dead husband. When she realizes she needs to add that last sentence, we can see she is lying.\n\nHANNAH D203: Bruise? Oh yeah. No, it’s nothing. I was going through the top cupboard in my kitchen and the chair slipped and I kind of hit the door with my face. I mean it hurt like hell.\n\nLet’s talk about the bruise.\n\nThings could have happened exactly as Hannah described them, if not for Eve mentioning the bruise in the final interview. I don’t see a reason why Eve would lie about it. So let’s try to discuss the bruise as if really existed since the day of Simon’s murder.\n\nWHY NOT TWINS? The bruise is one of the top reasons why some people believe that Hannah and Eve are two separate persons. When I researched why, the answer is one of the two, or both: a) because the bruise disappears on the next visit in mere two days, and then Eve touches the wrong cheek, b) because that explains why it was Eve who went to the police first. Sending Hannah, with a fresh bruise on her face (in this version: from the fight with Simon), would immediately make her a suspect number one.\n\nCool, but as for that last thing… Why not hide Hannah’s fading bruise under some makeup during this interview? Why bring attention to it? Hannah’s husband was missing, and the twins had to know she would be a suspect.\n\nHow did that conversation go between the twins? “Eve, I know I am fighting for my life here, and I know you showed at the police with no bruise, but let’s not do anything about it. Covering the bruise with some makeup would be so much work, five minutes at least. And then on the next meeting, when you appear bruise-free again, just tell the police you have a fast metabolism. That will not be suspicious. Also, let’s not synchronize on the hairdo, clothes, drinks, and jewelry. Well, except for the wedding ring. Let’s do that.”\n\nSo, to me, the bruise is actually another clue that the twins do not exist. It’s just way too sloppy for someone fighting for their life not to care about something so obviously suspicious. I realize people do stupid things all the time, but, as many authors observed, the difference between reality and fiction is that fiction has to make sense.\n\n(At the end, Eve says “We wanted to have suspicion on us so we could then disprove it rather than have it linger” ( EVE D768), but apart from generally being odd, it’s about the alibi, and not the bruise.) /END\n\nAdmittedly, the bruise under the MPD angle makes only a bit more sense, but it’s still pretty silly.\n\nHannah/Eve seems to have had the bruise from the start. We do hear this from Eve: “[…] She was furious. And so angry. The kind of anger you can only have toward yourself. […] We fought. I hit her back, left a bruise.” (EVE D763). Many people believe that she just covered it with makeup during the previous, very first visit to the police. The bruise was not hers, she wanted it to disappear. And Eve is pretty good at disguises.\n\nIt’s a nice hypothesis, makes sense. “The kind of anger you can only have toward yourself” is a pretty telling sentence. Nothing decisive, of course, but still powerful.\n\nInitially, I thought there was a slight problem with this hypothesis, though. If you watch all the clips from the first visit, you will notice that Eve touches her left cheek a few times, and shouldn’t that ruin the layer of makeup covering the bruise?\n\nBut I asked my wife and her friend if a) makeup could cover a bruise and b) hold despite those few touches of the bruise area — and they both answered yes to both questions.\n\nIf Hannah-Eve got the bruise on June 18th, then the bruise was a week old on June 25th and already fading away (the bruise that we see in this interview is yellow-brownish, which is the final color stage of bruises), then was finally gone two days later on June 27th. That gives us nine days of healing. And if we want more time, we can assume that Eve covered the bruise for the third interview as well.\n\nHowever, if Eve did cover the bruise with makeup, and thus knew perfectly well where it was, why would she touch the wrong side of her face when asked about it in the beginning of the third interview?\n\nNot touching the proper cheek could have been because Eve has always seen the bruise in the mirror only (just as Hannah, for that matter), and now, without the mirror, reached for the wrong side.\n\nThe more Machiavellian explanation is that Eve is sabotaging Hannah. Pretending she goes along with the alibi plan, but cleverly and slowly revealing the truth — the truth she believes in, that the twins exist — to the detectives for her own purpose. But, as I said it earlier, the saboteur hypothesis has a serious weakness that, unfortunately, forces me not treat it too seriously.\n\nFinally, even assuming that Eve covered the bruise with makeup for this and possibly her next interview, we’re still left with the question why didn’t Hannah do the same thing? What woman would not cover such supposed result of an accident with makeup? Hannah has a lot to lose by exposing the bruise to the police, why is she doing this?\n\nI mean, sure, I can attempt a hypothesis — what if Hannah wanted the bruise to heal fast, so she left it au naturel, and then simply forgot about it? — but even I cringe when I type this.\n\nThe even more Machiavellian explanation that I see here and there is that Hannah has painted the bruise on her cheek herself. But …why? I mean, we know the bruise is fake, because the actress surely didn’t let Sam Barlow hit her “for authenticity”, but why would Hannah use a fake bruise? There’s nothing here for her to win, but there’s a lot to lose. Remember, it’s in her best interest that the police never finds out she has a “twin”.\n\nAs I said, the bruise affair seems to be pretty silly no matter what’s your angle. The MPD hypothesis can at least explain it by Eve removing the bruise that’s not hers with makeup, and by Hannah simply not being in perfect synch with Eve. But the bruise itself is pretty thin for my tastes. So either Sam slipped here a little, or I have simply failed to find the right key to this particular event.\n\nHANNAH D204: I’ve been round to Doug and Eleanor’s and they’re very worried. I feel sorry for them.\n\nAs I mentioned before, Hannah calls Simon’s parents by name, unlike Eve.\n\nHANNAH D205: Well Eric was like an uncle to him. They were pretty close, they spend a lot of time with each other. Especially when they have to go to conferences. Have you met his wife Diane?\n\nWhen a conference takes place, Eric and Simon go together. Mental note for later.\n\nInteresting that Hannah uses past tense initially, “was” and “were” — as if Simon was dead or something.\n\nHANNAH D206: Diane is really nice. She helps out at the glaziers, organizes the Christmas Party, that sort of thing. They have two kids, really sweet kids. She looked out for me when I worked there.\n\nWhenever Hannah or Eve talk about Diane, they always praise her. She is nice, protective, helpful, has a great taste and is a great cook. I wonder if this is Hannah’s way of idealizing marriage, as she also says nice things only about Diane’s husband, Eric, or if Eric and Diane are really so spotless, or if something else is going on here.\n\nNot that the first letters of the names of Simon’s parents — (D)oug and (E)leanor — are the gender-switched mirror of the first letters of Smiths’ friends, (E)ric and (D)iane.\n\nHANNAH D207: OK. I’ll try my best to remember.\n\nI bet.\n\nHANNAH D208: Yes. He left after the argument. It was about eight o’clock.\n\nRoger that.\n\nHANNAH D209: Yes, that’s my birthday. Not one of the big ones but I guess you can see that.\n\nHanna’s birthdays are quite important: this is when she runs away to see Bob Dylan, this is the day that Eve materializes (before she even has a name), and of course it is also the day she killes Simon. It’s quite likely — if you play the timeline game — that a few other events from the game also took place on Hannah’s birthday, like Hannah’s parents death in the summer.\n\nHANNAH D210: Yeah. I guess. I’m quite a private person and I didn’t want to really get into the detail of the argument.\n\nHannah is indeed a private person. This is reinforced later a few times (e.g. “I was quite shy”, “He was as shy as me”, “She is the shy one”, etc.) but we can see this is in the way she behaves during the interviews. Of course, being shy is not exactly the reason why she “didn’t want to really get into the detail of the argument”.\n\nHANNAH D211: It was my birthday like you said. We were going to have a meal at home. We had our meal. He gave me his present. I guess I didn’t like the present.\n\nThe detectives keep pushing and Hannah gets agitated and a bit angry. This happens later too, and we can see the glimpses of her true nature.\n\nLater, Eve messes up the birthday food. Here Hannah just mentions “a meal”, then Eve claims the meal was “a takeaway” (EVE D331), and then Eve reports that Hanna said there was no meal, only “a birthday tea” (EVE D761). She wasn’t there at the time, so she got the details wrong.\n\nI wonder if the meals are yet another thing unique to a persona. The takeaway fits Eve, the bar singer, and the tea fits, well, the tea-loving Hannah (even if reported by Eve).\n\nSide note: many statements in the game have their contradictory doppelganger. It is possible that these are leftovers from the previous version of the game/design that, as Sam Barlow told in a few interviews, was about the more traditional gameplay. Possibly — and I speculate here — that design was about pointing out the contradictions, and moving the story forward this way. Not sure if that’s true, but it would explain the abundance of statement-contradiction pairs of sentences.\n\nHANNAH D212: It wasn’t the present so much. It was one of those arguments that has been simmering for a while. The present was a mirror. A nice mirror. He’d engraved the glass. The kind of mirror a princess would have in a story. He made it specially for me.\n\nWith that last sentence, Hannah emphasizes that Eve should never have gotten the mirror.\n\nWhat’s odd about this clip is that Hannah calms down and becomes quite composed for someone who is talking about what in the future will be revealed as the alleged murder weapon, one that she supposedly used to kill her husband just a little over a week ago. It’s like she is completely oblivious to the mirror’s baggage.\n\nHow to explain Hannah’s composure? One possibility is, of course, that she is a great actress, or a psychopath — or both.\n\nThe theme of Hannah seeing herself as a princess starts here, after the vague video game metaphor we heard in the first interview. It’s the evil’s illusion of shallow prestige. In reality, someone else is the real princess, and Hannah is the witch…\n\n…or a wicked stepmother or an evil queen, but I stick to just the witch in this analysis for clarity. The important thing is the general idea behind such a character. As Heidi Anne Heiner, the researcher of fairy tales and an owner of SurLaLune website writes it in her analysis:\n\nThe image of the evil stepmother occurs frequently in fairy tales. She is associated with jealousy and cruelty (Olderr 1986). “In masculine psychology, the stepmother is a symbol of the unconscious in a destructive role” (von Franz 1970). The stepmother figure is actually two sided, in that while she has destructive intentions, her actions often lead the protagonist into situations that identify and strengthen his or her best qualities.\n\nOur Hannah.\n\nThe symbolic layer of the clip is taken from another Grimms’ fairy tale, Little Snow-White. And Hannah is the witch again here, murderously jealous of anyone else daring to reflect their pretty face in the mirror. Another element taken from the tale is the treacherously poisoned apple (mushroom), one that the witch (Hannah) used for the murder of an innocent (Hannah’s parents).\n\nHANNAH D213: When you’ve been married for ten years stuff accumulates. We could argue about anything. And he’s so nice that doesn’t help. He tries to smooth things over and that just makes it worse. We’re both passive aggressive so we never normally argue directly about anything.\n\nSimon knew Hannah was different — even before he fully realized what was going on — and that’s why he was always the one to “smooth things over”. It is how he understood his role as a supportive, caring husband.\n\nThere can be an extra interpretation of the last sentence, because why not? Note how slightly disconnected it is from the rest. By “we”, Hannah might mean her and Eve, and yeah, they are unable to argue about anything directly.\n\nHANNAH D214: What about us?\n\nI have no idea what the detective’s question was here, especially in the context of the next reply from Hannah.\n\nHANNAH D215: I did? Well, we met when we were seventeen, both working at the glaziers.\n\nAgain, no idea what was the question. But I believe this exchange is to gently bring our attention to the fact that Hannah does not remember a detail from the previous interview. Note her surprise and slight confusion when she asks “I did?”.\n\nHANNAH D216: Yeah, when I was at school. I worked part time in the front shop. It was sort of an extended family thing. My dad used to work there, my mum used to work there before I was born. I took care of paperwork, filing things, typing out invoices, that kind of thing. It was a good job for a girl back then. I didn’t work a till or anything, I was quite shy so I wouldn’t have liked to work a till.\n\nRoger that.\n\nHANNAH D217: No. He was as shy as me. I asked… Well, I asked a friend to ask him out for me. We had our first date at the Odeon in North End. We went to see Risky Business. I had on my one best dress. Simon paid and bought me a Wispa and I was worried about getting chocolate on my teeth.\n\nShyness is what Simon and Hannah shared. This is why Hannah is so possessive of Simon, so jealous, so “he is my prince and I am his princess”. For years, it’s Eve who got all the boys, but Simon was that one guy who fell for Hannah, not Eve.\n\n“I asked a friend” does not necessarily suggest that Hannah had a way to bring Eve out consciously. It could have been a diary entry as well.\n\nRisky Business debuted in August 1983, so I think it works with the top level timeline.\n\nHANNAH D218: I got pregnant. Both our parents had a big pow wow. We weren’t even in the room and they decided we should get married.\n\nLike in fairy tales, where sometimes the prince and the princess were in an arranged marriage. Of course, it still happens in the real world, too.\n\nHANNAH D219: I guess you could call it that but we were both, both happy to get married. It was a beautiful wedding. We had our first dance to Come Back and Stay. I’m not sure if that’s a good wedding song but I loved it. I chose it. It was genuinely our first dance — we’d never danced together before. It was probably awful to watch but I enjoyed it. It felt like it was just me and Simon for that moment, just the two of us.\n\nNote how different that recollection of the wedding is from Eve’s recollection (EVE D510). Hannah talks intimate details, feelings, personal memories — while Eve reports what she saw on the wedding photos.\n\nNote the double “both”, said as if she is trying to convince the detectives. Might be interpreted as both Hannah and Eve being happy about the marriage, or a wish that it was the case.\n\nThere’s one other interesting dualism in this recollection. Hannah says something we can interpret as her being happy alone with Simon, without Eve’s shadow over her. But the lyrics to Come Back and Stay — note the title itself, too — are saying something exactly opposite:\n\nSince you’ve been gone\n\nI shut my eyes\n\nAnd I fantasize\n\nThat you’re here with me\n\nWill you ever return?\n\nI won’t be satisfied\n\n‘Till you’re by my side\n\nDon’t wait any longer\n\nWhy don’t you come back?\n\nPlease hurry\n\nCome back and stay for good this time\n\nYou said goodbye\n\nI was trying to hide\n\nWhat I felt inside\n\nUntil you passed me by\n\nYou said you’d return\n\nYou said that you’d be mine\n\n‘Till the end of time\n\nDon’t wait any longer\n\nSince you’ve been gone\n\nOpened my eyes\n\nAnd I realize\n\nWhat we had together\n\nWill you ever return?\n\nI’ll have you change your mind\n\nIf you won’t stay mine just love me forever\n\nLove me forever\n\nHannah and Eve grew apart in the weeks before the wedding. As one commenter put it nicely, “With Simon’s love for her as herself, [Hannah’s] need for Eve diminishes. Without having to kill her, she was able to simply leave her behind in the attic and pursue a normal life with Simon.”\n\nNow that Simon is formally hers, Hannah gains confidence, no longer treats Eve as competition, and simply misses her.\n\nHANNAH D220: We spent the wedding night in a hotel in Brighton. It would have been too much to do more, we were saving for the baby. It was wonderful to be in a hotel away from home, just alone together. Since then we’ve always tried to get away for our holiday.\n\nIf so, was the trip to Oxford, that romantic weekend, also on the anniversary of Hannah and Simon’s wedding? It’s possible. Hannah lost the baby at the end of spring, when she was eight months pregnant, and got married after she got pregnant. It means the wedding took place sometime between October and May. As it took at least a month for Hannah to realize she was pregnant and then the families had to organize the wedding, February being the anniversary is possible. Hannah would have been around five months pregnant at the time.\n\nHANNAH D221: We couldn’t afford our own place. Simon dropped out of school, went full time at the glaziers. That was Eric’s generosity. We moved in with his mum and dad. They had a spare room for us and the baby if it came. It was a nice change, time to myself, living there for those months, full of hope.\n\nEve was not there with Hannah during those months. “I was living in the attic.”, says Eve (EVE D748). The attic being the memory in Hannah’s mind.\n\nHANNAH D222: No. I lost the baby. Had a miscarriage at eight months. We carried on living at Simon’s parents until… Well, it was only a few months after.\n\nEven though 80% of miscarriages happen in the first trimester, it’s still possible that Hannah miscarried so close to the delivery. However, technically that is not a miscarriage, but “stillbirth”, or “preterm delivery”.\n\nThe question is, then — did Sam Barlow just misuse the “miscarriage” word (it happens quite often), or is there more to this story? Some go as far as to speculate that Hannah did not miscarry, but gave up her child — Sarah — for adoption. Personally I don’t think that’s the case. I mean, it’s possible — but I fail to see even a tiniest single element in Her Story’s story that would support this hypothesis.\n\nIt’s possible that Eve’s STD (EVE D746) contributed to or was the cause of the miscarriage. Gonorrhea, “a very common STD”, means “an increased risk of miscarriage or preterm delivery” — and it’s not the only STD than can be fatal to a baby.\n\nEve had sex with random strangers only early into the pregnancy, not when she was eight months pregnant or anything: “[…] I had to stop when one of the guys gave me an STD. When we met up it was disturbing. For the first time my reflection, she didn’t look like me. She was fatter. […]“ (EVE D746). It’s just that the STD, depending on what it was exactly, might have contributed to Hannah losing the baby months later.\n\nBut Eve is the princess in Her Story, and Hannah is the evil witch. Causing the stillbirth does not exactly gel with this assertion. I can offer a few explanations. Maybe it’s an allusion to a fairy tale I fail to recognize. Maybe Eve cannot be blamed for acts she has done without understanding she was Hannah as well. Maybe Eve only thought she caused the tragedy, but it was Hannah’s fault. Maybe the stillbirth was nothing but a cruel fate.\n\nHANNAH D223: Then my parents died. It was the worst year of my life. The miscarriage and then my parents.\n\nThere is an interesting difference between what’s the worst to Hannah and Eve. Hannah mentions this awful year twice (here and at HANNAH D441), while Eve says this about Simon’s murder: “Nothing like this has ever happened to me before. […] It’s probably the worst thing that has happened to me.” (EVE D303).\n\nHANNAH D224: At the time they said it was poison. Food poisoning. I felt so guilty. If I had still been at home maybe I could have done something. I don’t know.\n\nLet’s talk more about this when we gather more data on the death of Hannah’s parents. But note how Hannah nervously plays with her wedding ring. “I felt so guilty.”\n\nHANNAH D225: Yes. I inherited it from my parents so it made sense to move back. Me and Simon. Felt like going back to old ways before the pregnancy. Reminded me of being a girl. The dollhouse in the attic, old things. We didn’t sleep in my parent’s bedroom for a long time. We decorated it as soon as we moved in but it was another year before we started sleeping there.\n\nHannah and Eve got back together.\n\nThe love, the marriage, the pregnancy — all of that happiness buried Eve deep inside Hannah’s psyche. But the tragedies of that year — the miscarriage and the death of Hannah’s parents — brought Eve back.\n\nHANNAH D226: I got a job. To contribute, you know. Doug knew someone and I got a job as a dinner lady at the primary school. They said it didn’t matter if I could cook or not, just don’t poison the kids! So you see, it’s always been complicated between me and Simon. It’s never just been the two of us. There’s always been pressure.\n\n“Just don’t poison the kids”. Ha, ha. Hilarious, considering your parents died of food poisoning. Was the school was unaware of how Hannah’s parents died? Or is Hannah projecting here?\n\nAnd indeed, Hannah, it’s never been just the two of you. We can all safely agree that did complicate things.\n\nHANNAH D227: I mean I don’t know. Something must have happened to him on his way home. He could be hurt. I mean why hasn’t he phoned? It doesn’t… I don’t know.\n\nDiscussed the phone call earlier.\n\nHANNAH D228: Oh God. I don’t know. I mean, I guess The Rock? You’ve spoken to everyone there? Someone must have seen where he went. I don’t know. So many things could have gone wrong.\n\nDiscussed The Rock earlier.\n\nHANNAH D229: No. I mean, he was… Everyone loves Simon. He was so nice. To everyone. He loves me.\n\nOdd disconnected remark, “he loves me”. Are these gentle notes of jealousy, of convincing one’s self of the beloved’s exclusive feelings?\n\nHANNAH D230: Fine. I’ve never had my fingerprints taken before. I once burned my hand on the oven.\n\nThe fingerprints of identical twins are actually not identical, not even the fingerprints of the so-called mirror image twins. Burning the hand — and we can clearly see it’s fully healed, so it’s not a recent thing — would not destroy the fingerprints, although it might have altered them slightly.\n\nBut the oven is not a red herring. It shows yet another face of Hannah the Witch, again from Grimms’ Hansel and Gretel, where “the godless witch burned up miserably” in an oven.\n\nIt’s unclear if Hannah’s fingerprints were taken by the police during her Bob Dylan adventure. It does not matter much either way, I believe.\n\nHANNAH D231: OK. I’ve given blood before. Do you need to take that for your records?\n\nOf course.\n\nInterview 3: Eve — June 27th (Tuesday)\n\nSometime between today and Sunday the body of Simon was “discovered” by Hannah in her house and reported to the police. Obviously that makes her suspect number one, and the real fun starts now. The police will try to find a hole in Hannah’s testimony, and evaluate her psyche.\n\nEVE D301: No, it’s OK, the other detective has just gone to get me one.\n\nRoger that.\n\nEVE D302: Oh, it tastes fine to me. As long as it’s black and strong I’m good.\n\nHi, Eve.\n\nEVE D303: Nothing like this has ever happened to me before. The blood… It’s probably the worst thing that has happened to me.\n\nI discussed “the worst thing” earlier.\n\nEVE D304: The bruise? I have a really fast metabolism, so stuff like that just comes and goes. I don’t know if there’s much more that I can tell you that I haven’t already told the other policeman. I found the body. I…\n\nI discussed the bruise earlier.\n\nEVE D305: You think it’s murder? Clearly it’s murder. Well, what can I do to help?\n\nAh, the cognitive dissonance. Eve’s initial reaction might be to the fact she does not consider this accidental killing a murder (and technically that’s manslaughter, not murder).\n\nEVE D306: It was after dinner. I’d spoken to Simon’s parents on the phone. I locked up for an early night and I suddenly had this thought I think it was something his mum had said. She‘d been speaking about old stuff. Sad stuff. About when we lived there. About the baby. There’s some boxes in the cellar. Nursery stuff. Stuff we never needed and I never had the heart to throw out. I suddenly remembered that when I’d looked down there the week before, those boxes, that pile was in the wrong place. I went cold all over. I went down there with a torch and went straight to the back, and that’s when I saw the bin bags. Pulled them open. Saw the body. I screamed and that’s when I called the police.\n\nNote how Eve nervously plays with her wedding ring again here and in the next two clips.\n\nWe cannot easily determine which part of Hannah’s or Eve’s testimony made the police realize she was lying to them. It might have been this statement above, if the detectives connected the dots during the interview or right after. This way or another, after this interview, they know.\n\nHere is a revealing piece of information, from this very interview: “We never go into the cellar. It’s just a place we put things we don’t need.” (EVE D308)\n\nFirst, it’s odd that “Hannah” noticed that the boxes were moved but decided to ignore it. Her husband was missing, there was something odd about the cellar… Oh, well, time to …do nothing.\n\nSecond, why did “Hannah” go into the cellar in the first place? After all, “we never go into the cellar”.\n\nObviously, we know the answers to these puzzling elements of Eve’s testimony, but for the detectives this might have been the first time they realized things did not add up.\n\nAlso, “went down with a torch”? No light in the cellar (it was the place where daddy grew mushrooms, after all)? If so, how did “Hannah” notice “the week before” that the boxes were moved?\n\nFinally, I got to wonder about the smell. The corpse being in the cellar plus the bin bags might have neutralized the smell to a certain degree, but it is the end of June, the corpse was rotting for nine days (and the cellar was flooded with Simon’s blood), and we know that “It’s stifling in summer [in the house]” (EVE D346).\n\nEve mentions bin bags, not a bin bag, but Simon’s corpse was not chopped into pieces. A single bin bag would not be able to contain a body, so presumably a few of them were cut and then pieced together — with the help of parcel tape — to form a bin bag wrapping.\n\nEven though there was no chopping — we can safely assume that if there were, it’d be mentioned more times than zero — the story alludes to Grimms’ Fitcher’s Bird, in which a girl finds bloodied corpses in a place she is not supposed to visit. “[She] examined the house, entering finally the forbidden chamber. Oh, what she saw! He two dear sisters were lying there in the basin, miserably murdered and chopped to pieces.”\n\nThis is also yet another side of Hannah the Witch. In the tale, the forbidden room full of dead people belongs to an evil sorcerer, just like the cellar in Hannah’s house belongs to Hannah.\n\nEVE D307: His body it didn’t look real. His throat, it looked like his throat had been cut. And I didn’t see his glasses. He has these thick glasses. Doesn’t always wear them.\n\nThe subject of glasses comes up only here, and earlier at EVE D106 (“[…] He has a scar down here near his stomach. […] Cut himself with some glass. […] He’s not got his glasses on [the photo] here, though. He takes them off for the camera. But he needs them to see properly. You know, when he has to read. A newspaper or a menu in a restaurant. Not books so much. Or watching TV. He likes TV.”)\n\nThere does not seem to be any discrepancy between those two statements. However, let’s look at the mention that there were no glasses on Simon’s corpse.\n\nDid Eve mean on his head or just generally with him? If the former, then why is it surprising to her? After all, he was not wearing his glasses all the time — she said it herself twice, and it’s not something that lying about makes any sense. If the latter, then how would she know that? Did she search the corpse? Well, we know she did. She got rid of the evidence and put his body in the cellar. So mentioning the lack of glasses can be considered a slip of the tongue.\n\nBut nothing is accidental, remember, so what’s the point of glasses here? More so, what’s the point of including the glasses in the story at all?\n\nThe real function of the missing glasses is to provide a firmer connection to Rapunzel. When the prince learned that he was deceived by the witch, he threw himself off the tower, and “the thorns into which he fell poked out his eyes”. Unlike in Her Story, the prince survived, but in both cases he was “blinded”.\n\nThe slashed throat is not without its fairy tale roots either. Simon was trying to “get the princess”, but such a desire often ends badly for the princes. Usually, when they fail to prove themselves to a princess, their heads are severed from their bodies. Good old decapitation. We see this, for example, in The Little Hamster from the Water aka The Rabbit aka The Sea-Hare, or in The Six Servants.\n\nObviously, Sam Barlow couldn’t have had Hannah decapitate Simon with a piece of a mirror in his pseudo-true crime game, but the slashed throat is a proper equivalent.\n\nEVE D308: No. The whole thing was wrong. The bags. I think they were from our kitchen, you can probably check that. We never go into the cellar. It’s just a place we put things we don’t need. Dad used to grow mushrooms there. The bags were taped up. I think it was parcel tape. I think it was ours.\n\nI discussed the cellar, the bags and the tape earlier.\n\nEVE D309: I wasn’t in the house.\n\nOh?\n\nEVE D310: I wasn’t in the house all of Friday night. After the argument after Simon left I left too. I was upset and I wanted to get away. So I took the car.\n\nAnd so the Glasgow “alibi” begins here.\n\nEVE D311: I got in the car and I drove. I just kept driving north. Just kept going, just wanted to get away as far as I could. When I finally stopped, I was all the way up in Glasgow. I was so tired, just had to sleep.\n\nJust so we’re clear what we’re dealing with here: it’s 600 kilometers (444 miles) between Portsmouth and Glasgow, almost all of it highways. Considering Eve’s inclination for fast driving (she got the speeding ticket), it’s could easily be, say, a five-hour drive (especially at night, with highly reduced traffic).\n\nWhy did Eve go to Glasgow? It was not to manufacture an alibi or get rid of the evidence far, far away from home. It has happened exactly as Eve tells it in her final interview, but there is a Rapunzel subtext. I discuss this when analyzing that final interview.\n\nEVE D312: I left the next day, Saturday. I slept for a few hours in the car and when I woke up I came straight back. Simon wasn’t returning my calls and I wanted to try and make up. I got back to the house and Simon wasn’t there and I… I… Excuse me! Is there a bin?\n\nLater, Eve says that when she woke up, she “[…] got some petrol, bought a coffee and a pastry.” (EVE D332). Here it’s simply “I came straight back”. I don’t think it qualifies as a lie, though. It’s obvious she needed some gas after such a long drive, and I would not count a gas station as something that would render the “straight back” a lie.\n\nEVE D313: Yes I’m fine. I won’t be sick again. This happens some days. I’m pregnant. It’s morning sickness.\n\n“Morning sickness: nausea in pregnancy, typically occurring in the first few months. Despite its name, the nausea can affect pregnant women at any time of day.”\n\nEVE D314: No. Well, yes. He found out on my birthday. I told him I was pregnant.\n\nRemember, birthdays are special to Hannah, they are often her triggers. This helps us understand the murder. It was not just a good old marriage trouble that pushed Hannah to play with death.\n\nWe have another mirror of Rapunzel here. “Once upon a time there was a man and a woman who had long wished for a child but had never received one. Finally, however, the woman came to be with child.”\n\nEVE D315: Yes. It was a shock to him, I mean, we never thought it was possible. I don’t know what he… I mean I hadn’t decided whether to keep the baby. I wasn’t really ready to talk to him about it.\n\nNow, why would Hannah or Eve consider an abortion?\n\nI guess this shows the internal conflict. For a second, Hannah might not have wanted the baby because it was Eve’s. And Eve might not have wanted the baby because it was Simon’s, her sister’s husband.\n\nThis way or another, the doubt never re-appears in the interviews. On the contrary, later Eve will say: “[…] I was in Glasgow worrying about whether my baby was still growing inside me.” (EVE D520).\n\nEVE D316: It was late. Early Saturday morning.\n\nI guess we’re back to talking about Glasgow.\n\nEVE D317: Yeah. I pulled over and slept in the car. This was just by the side of the road. I was exhausted.\n\nRoger that.\n\nEVE D318: I think when I drove back it was about eight or something. I got back to the house about three. Three.\n\nTo get back home from Glasgow during the day: a seven-hour drive. Plausible.\n\nEVE D319: When you suspect someone of murdering their husband?\n\nThat’s how these interviews go. She knows they might be suspecting her. They know she knows they might be suspecting her. As I said it earlier, it’s a psychological battle.\n\nEVE D320: OK. So you want to eliminate me as a suspect?\n\nAs I mentioned it earlier, we hear Her Story, but the detectives are the silent heroes of the game as well. It does not make the game a Hero Story, but they are important. Figuring out what the detectives knew and when, and what was their plan — fun!\n\nHere we have an example of the detectives lying to Eve, as the purpose of the test is to confirm a suspicion or identify a suspect rather than to eliminate one. As we can see, our sneaky detectives are not useless Lestrades, on the contrary.\n\nEVE D321: OK. Sounds weird. I’m not great at making up stories.\n\nEve just made up a story about not being great at making up stories.\n\nAnyway, let’s talk about what’s happening here. Earlier I mentioned that Eve is subjected to the Thematic Apperception Test. To be precise, what the game uses is a derivative of such test called Morgan Interview Theme Technique (MITT).\n\nWe know this because the official description of one of Her Story’s Steam backgrounds says this: “For use in suspect interview. Included: Apprehension Sketch, Irrelevant Sketch, Relevant Sketch, Guilt or Remorse Sketch” — and such sketches are the feature of the MITT.\n\nThe other source is more mundane:\n\nWhat is the MITT?\n\nTaken from here:\n\nThe creator of the Morgan Interview Theme Technique, or MITT, was Raymond Morgan, a law enforcement investigative and training professional. The MITT uses a series of 42 sketches with interviewees, showing them a sketch, asking them to tell a story about each sketch, and observing their physical and verbal reactions.\n\nSketches depict random scenes, nonviolent crimes, violent crimes, sex crimes, apprehension scenes and scenes of people expressing guilt and remorse. Interviewees commonly project indicators of truthfulness or deception when shown MITT sketches, allowing the interviewer to better focus the interview on areas where it seems the interviewee is lying or has anxiety. MITT is commonly used in criminal investigations.\n\nAlso this source:\n\nThe MITT is based on the principle of “Projection”. Any time we communicate, either verbally or non-verbally, we are projecting ourselves to others. We often very unconsciously project our feelings, thoughts and attitudes in the communicative process. The MITT is designed to capsulize and capture, often very unconsciously, feelings, thoughts and attitudes of the person being interviewed.\n\nAnd from one more source, with some key details:\n\nMorgan Interview Theme Technique (MITT) helps a forensic investigator in finding the truth in a case. MITT is a projective test where the suspect is asked to make up stories concerning five presented pictures. The stories should include what happened prior to the scene in the sketch, what is happening now in the sketch, and an ending. Research indicates that when people make up stories from their imaginations, they must draw on their own life experiences. Therefore, approximately 30% of what a person tells in the form of a story is actually related to his or her own past history.\n\n[…]. MITT only takes a few minutes to administer and tends to reduce the anxiety of the innocent and increase the anxiety of the deceptive. MITT allows for the identification of the deceptive by their reluctance to talk about the relevant issue, their downbeat stories, their inability to make up endings, and their illogical presentations. MITT also gives the interviewer information that can be used during an interrogation to facilitate admissions and confessions.\n\nFinally, a quote from “Effective Interviewing and Interrogation Techniques” book:\n\nIn Her Story, the detectives hand over only four cards to Eve, not five, but it’s more than enough for what the game is trying to tell us.\n\nEVE D322: OK. There’s a girl, and she’s staring out the window. She’s sad? She’s trapped. She’s here. She’s looking out the window because her mother won’t let her out.\n\nThis is the card.\n\nIt is the Irrelevant Sketch, and it’s the first card that the MITT says should be given to a suspect. The name comes from the fact that the sketch is not directly connected to the crime being investigated. It does tell us things about the suspect, though.\n\nEVE D323: It’s Rapunzel. The story starts when she’s born. Mother Gothel, a witch, takes Rapunzel from her parents and keeps her locked up in this tower. Rapunzel gets pregnant by the Prince. Mother Gothel is furious, so she cuts off her hair and throws her — Actually her hair is already short here so that’s already happened. She throws her into the wilderness and Rapunzel is reunited with the prince who’s blind. But she cures him with her tears, and so it’s a happy ending. Is that too much?\n\nRapunzel works on two levels, as if we did not have enough duality in the game already.\n\nOne layer is the construction of the story, the way the creator merged various fairy tales with the real life, maintaining Rapunzel as the core story.\n\nThe other layer is the story and its characters as such. Eve does see herself as Rapunzel on a subconscious level, affected by the stories of her youth. “We were obsessed with fairy tales. Not just the pretty ones but the traditional ones. They were dark and real. Bizarre and violent. Felt like life.” (EVE D739).\n\nEve properly makes up the beginning, the middle, and the end. The end does not reflect the real life, though. Simon cannot be cured, the lovers cannot be re-united. But… “[…] Simon’s dead. But the baby… That’s how he will live on. Our baby.” (HANNAH D444).\n\nEVE D324: Sorry. Sorry. The picture the way it’s drawn it just reminded me of the books we used to read as children. I read those fairy tales over and over, they were so real to me. Rapunzel was my favourite. My brain is just full of it. Are any of these in colour?\n\nThe detectives reminded Eve that she was supposed to tell her own stories, not recite classic fairy tales. If only they knew…\n\nNotice one of many such slips: “We used to read” instead of “I used to read”.\n\nEve mentions “colour”, as the test cards remind her of the colored plates from the book of fairy tales she read as a child (EVE D739).\n\n“Rapunzel was my favourite”. Thanks, Sam!\n\nEVE D325: Yes. Like a story. A beginning, a middle, and an end.\n\nYes, that is what is expected from the suspect during the MITT — to make up a story that describes the past, the present and the future of the test card’s characters. It’s also what we will not find in Her Story, unless we make up our own ending. To be fair, The Brothers Grimm were occasional teases as well. Here’s the slightly abridged version of The Golden Key fairy tale:\n\nOnce […] a poor boy […] found a small golden key. Now he believed that where there was a key, there must also be a lock, so he dug in the ground and found a little iron chest. “If only the key fits!” he thought. “Certainly there are valuable things in the chest.” He looked, but there was no keyhole. Finally he found one, but so small that it could scarcely be seen. He tried the key, and fortunately it fitted. Then he turned it once, and now we must wait until he has finished unlocking it and has opened the lid. Then we shall find out what kind of wonderful things there were in the little chest.\n\nThe end. That’s it. That is how this fairy tale ends.\n\nEVE D326: OK. Well… She has a knife. She’s been cooking? I guess she’s been cooking him his favourite meal? She’s his wife. He’s asleep and she doesn’t want to wake him. Because he’s ill. That’s why she’s sad. Because he’s ill and he might die? It’s kind of a sad story so I’m not sure how it ends.\n\nThis is the card. It’s called the Relevant Sketch, and that’s because it relates to the crime committed.\n\nEve describes the last moments of Simon: Hannah with the sharp object she cut his throat with, Simon lying, “asleep”, “ill”, and “he might die”.\n\nThis is when the detectives learned that Eve was guilty, or, to be precise, that she was dishonest with them about the murder. It is easy to miss this moment, especially if one never learned how the MITT works. But Eve’s reactions are textbook MITT guilt, a clear identification of “the deceptive”: a) increased anxiety, b) reluctance to talk about the relevant issue, c) the downbeat story, d) the inability to make up an ending, and e) the illogical presentation. All checkboxes ticked off, and the detectives know that. "
