        "text": "Chauncey Mabe permalink*\n\nLet me remind everyone that I did allow in the original post that Rowan might be another sad, pathetic plagiarist who thought he get away with it. Which dumber than a Ponzi schemer, another species of miscreant who always gets caught.\n\nThis doesn’t let the spy genre off the hook, however. A number of experts — critics, editors, and other writers — read and loved Rowan’s fraud. They did not detect any change in style as it slid from one theft to another. Which can only mean that spy thrillers have grown so lazy and derivative that one cannot be told from the other.\n\nSome exceptions exist, of course. Le Carre — natch! And while I don’t read a lot in the spy genre, I can name two others: Oleg Steinhauer, with his trilogy about an average-guy spy, Milo Weaver. Charles Cumming is the author of Trinity Six, among other thrillers, which is one of the best books I’ve read in the past year, a novel that beautifully modulates between character development and suspense.\n\nI’ve always believed that the conventions of genre writing, like the conventions of, say, the sonnet, can be not only confining but also liberating. In the crime suspense game, where I read somewhat more, I can name a number of excellent writers, from the obvious — Elmore Leonard, to lesser known but still famous such as Richard Price, Laura Lippman, and many others.\n\nWhat’s more, at every opportunity I have made the case that literary fiction is a genre, too, which never fails to bring cat calls raining down on my head from the highbrow crowd. True, in theory literary fiction has no limitations, its practitioners can go wherever their muse leads. But in practice, literary fiction has its fashions and conventions, too. One is the penchant for failing to bring a plot of conclusion, which is almost always more annoying than profound. Another is the way it ignores what people spend most of their time at –working.\n\nNonetheless, the failure of the many experts who saw this book before it went on sale to detect the least problem is itself a meaningful problem. It strongly suggests that not only are spy novelists adhering to conventions, as they should, but that they are also writing not from experience or research or their own imaginations. No, clearly they are writing from their reading of preceding successful spy novels.\n\nThis is a recipe for derivative mediocrity at best, genre senescence at worst.\n\nThe phenomenon of Assassin of Secrets may well be a commentary on the genre, on mainstream publishing houses, and on modern editorial practice, but whether Rowan is guilty of plagiarism or not has nothing to do with either his motivation or these interesting but ancillary issues. The simple fact is that he stole the work of others. A person who takes goods from a department store without paying for them is a thief and does not get off by proclaiming his actions to be performance art.\n\nAs a writer of genre fiction, I take exception to those who would praise theft as art. Canny criminals who get caught are not set free simply because they were clever or stole with panache. My own work (under pen name, Lior Samson) is too little known to have made it onto Rowan’s radar, but had it, I would have been happy to do my bit to sue his pants off or even to help him spend time in the splendid isolation of a secure facility where he could write using his own words rather than those of others.\n\n–Larry Constantine (Lior Samson)"
