        "text": "Come, you Pierian Muses, who give us the glory of music,\n\nTell me of Zeus, your progenitor, make praise-songs in his honor;\n\nThrough him, moreover, are humankind undistinguished or famous,\n\nThey are sung or unsung by the will of omnipotent great Zeus.\n\nEasily making a man strong, easily he overthrows him,\n\nEasily humbles the proud as he lifts up high the obscure, and\n\nEasily straightens the crooked as well as deflating the puffed-up—\n\nZeus, who is deathless and thunders aloft and dwells in the highest.\n\nListen to me and behold, make straight your decisions with justice.\n\nI would be happy to speak true facts to you, Perses, my brother.\n\nThere is not only one Discord, for on earth she is twofold:\n\nOne of them nobody would find fault with on closer acquaintance;\n\nOne you would deprecate, for they have totally different natures.\n\nWickedly, one promotes all the evils of warfare and slaughter;\n\nNo one of humankind likes her; out of necessity, at the\n\nWill of the blessed immortals, they treat grim Discord with honor.\n\nThere is, moreover, another, the firstborn daughter of dark Night.\n\nHer did the high-throned scion of Cronus whose home is in heaven\n\nPlace at the roots of the earth; she is certainly better for mankind.\n\nThis is that Discord that stirs up even the helpless to hard work,\n\nSeeing a man gets eager to work on beholding a neighbor\n\nWho is exceedingly wealthy and makes haste plowing and sowing,\n\nPutting his household in order; so neighbor competing with neighbor\n\nRuns after riches, and therefore this Discord benefits mankind.\n\nEvery potter begrudges another, and artists do likewise;\n\nEvery beggarman envies a beggar, and poets are rivals.\n\nPerses, be sure you deposit these things in your heart and your spirit,\n\nLest Discord, which is given to mischief, distract you from work and\n\nYou begin sneaking about, eavesdropping on feuds in the forum.\n\nYou have no business getting in fights and disputing in public,\n\nNot if you haven't sufficient for life laid up in your storeroom,\n\nSeasonal fruits of the earth, ripe grain of abundant Demeter.\n\nWhen you have plenty of that, turn freely to fierce competition\n\nFor the possessions of others; no second chance will be yours to\n\nDo so. Let us however decide our disputes by means of impartial\n\nJudgments, for justice derives from Zeus and is bound to be perfect.\n\nWhen we had split our inheritance, you grabbed most of it, making\n\nOff with it, to enhance the repute of our bribe-hungry royal\n\nMasters, who love to adjudge such cases as ours in their courtrooms.\n\nIdiots! They don't know how much more is the half than the whole, nor\n\nWhat is the use of a diet of mallow and asphodel, Perses?\n\nPlainly the gods keep secret from humankind the means of survival;\n\nOtherwise, you in a day could easily do enough work to\n\nLast you a whole year long, and without any further exertion.\n\nSoon, very soon you would hang up over the fireplace your rudder;\n\nThen would be finished the labors of oxen and hard-working donkeys.\n\nNo, Zeus kept it a secret because in his heart he was angry,\n\nSeeing how devious-minded Prometheus once had fooled him;\n\nTherefore did almighty Zeus plot sorrows and troubles for humankind.\n\nHe hid fire, which, however, then Iapetus's great-hearted son, to\n\nBenefit humankind, pilfered from Zeus, the purveyor of counsel,\n\nHid in a hollowed-out stalk to baffle the lover of thunder.\n\nThen cloud-gathering Zeus to Prometheus said in his anger:\n\n\"Iapetus's brat, since you're so much smarter than anyone else, you're\n\nHappy to outwit me, and rejoice in the fire you have stolen—\n\nFor yourself a calamity, also for men of the future.\n\nFor I shall give them a bad thing, too, in exchange for this fire, which\n\nHeartily all may delight in, embracing a homegrown evil.\"\n\nSpeaking, the father of gods and of mankind exploded in laughter.\n\nThen he commanded Hephaestus, the world-famed craftsman, as soon as\n\nPossible to mix water and earth, and infuse in it human\n\nSpeech, also strength, and to make it look like a goddess, and give it\n\nLikewise a girl-like form that was pretty and lovesome. Athena\n\nWould instruct her in handwork and weaving of intricate fabrics;\n\nFurthermore, gold Aphrodite should drip charm over her head to\n\nCause heartsore longing, emotional anguish exhausting the body.\n\nZeus gave instructions to Hermes, the sure guide, slayer of Argus,\n\nTo put in her the heart of a bitch and a devious nature.\n\nThen did the famed lame god manufacture at once from the earth a\n\nFair simulacrum of one shy maiden, according to Zeus's will.\n\nNext to her skin did the godlike Graces and gracious Persuasion\n\nCarefully place gold necklaces; round her adorable head the\n\nHours who are gorgeously coiffed wove garlands of beautiful spring flowers.\n\nHermes, our sure guide, slayer of Argus, contrived in her breast\n\nLies and misleadingly false words joined to a devious nature,\n\nAt the behest of the deep-voiced thunderer, Zeus; and the herald\n\nGod of the gods then gave her a voice. And he called her Pandora,\n\nSeeing how all who inhabit lofty Olympus had given\n\nSomething to pretty Pandora, that giant bane to industrious mankind.\n\nWhen he had finished this downright desperate piece of deception,\n\nTo Epimetheus Zeus then dispatched the slayer of Argus,\n\nFamed swift messenger of the immortals, with her as a present.\n\nBut Epimetheus had forgotten Prometheus's warning,\n\nNot to accept anything from Olympian Zeus, but to send it\n\nBack where it came from, lest it become a disaster for mortals.\n\nOnce he'd accepted it, he, possessing the bane, recognized it.\n\nFormerly dwelt on earth all the various tribes of the human\n\nRace, on their own and remote from evils and difficult labor\n\nAnd from distressing diseases that bring doom closer to each one.\n\n[For in misfortune do humans age rapidly, quicker than ever.]\n\nUsing her fingers, the maid pried open the lid of the great jar,\n\nSprinkling its contents; her purpose, to bring sad hardships to mankind.\n\nNothing but Hope stayed there in her stout, irrefrangible dwelling,\n\nUnder the lip of the jar, inside, and she never would venture\n\nOutdoors, having the lid of the vessel itself to prevent her,\n\nWilled there by Zeus, who arranges the storm clouds and carries the aegis.\n\nOtherwise, myriad miseries flit round miserable mortals;\n\nFurthermore, full is the earth of much mischief, the deep sea also.\n\nIllnesses visiting humans daily and nightly at all hours\n\nAll by themselves bring terrible troubles aplenty to mortals\n\nSilently, seeing their power of speech was suppressed by all-wise Zeus.\n\nThere is no way of escaping from Zeus's implacable mind-set.\n\nIf you prefer, an alternate story I'll summarize also\n\nWell and expertly, and lay it up in your mind and preserve it—\n\nNamely, the common origin shared by immortals and mortals.\n\nFirst, the immortals who dwell high up on the top of Olympus\n\nFashioned the firstborn race of articulate men, which was golden,\n\nAnd it is said that they lived when Cronus was ruling in heaven.\n\nGodlike, they lived like gods, and their hearts were entirely carefree,\n\nDistant strangers to labor and suffering; neither did wretched\n\nAge overtake them; instead, their members intact and unchanged, they\n\nTook much pleasure in banquets and parties, apart from all evils\n\nTill they died as if sleep overcame them. And everything worthwhile\n\nCame to their hand, as the grain-growing earth bore fruit without tilling,\n\nPlenty of good food crops unbegrudged; so they lived at their pleasure,\n\nPeacefully minding their own business, amid numerous good things.\n\nWealthy in flocks were they and beloved of the blessed immortals.\n\nAfter this whole first gold generation was finally buried,\n\nEven today they are called pure spirits inhabiting earth and\n\nNoble protectors of mankind, warding off evils from mortals,\n\nGivers of wealth, which royal prerogative still is their business.\n\nAfterward, those that inhabit Olympus fashioned a second,\n\nSilver race, which was very inferior, worse than the first one,\n\nFor they did neither in growth nor intellect equal the golden.\n\nChildren were then brought up by their diligent mothers a hundred\n\nYears and engaged in sheer infantile child's play there in their own homes.\n\nBut when maturing at last they came to the measure of manhood\n\nThey lived only the tiniest time, and moreover they suffered\n\nMuch in their folly; they could not keep themselves back from their wicked\n\nViolence on one another; nor were they willing to serve the immortals\n\nOr make sacrifice using the Blessed Ones' sacrosanct altars,\n\nAs it is lawful for humans to do and according to custom.\n\nThereupon, Zeus, son of Cronus, suppressed them all in his anger,\n\nSeeing they did not worship the gods who inhabit Olympus.\n\nAnd when this generation of silver in turn was interred\n\nUnder the earth, they were termed blessed spirits although they were mortal,\n\nSecond in time, yet everywhere honor is also their portion."
