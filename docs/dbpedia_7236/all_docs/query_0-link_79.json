        "text": "Hesiod 's Theogony and the Book of Genesis, came from two very distinct cultures. Hesiod’s Theogony is the Greek account of the creation of earth and humankind, while The Book of Genesis is the first book of the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Old Testament, which also stands as an account of creation. There are a number of profound similarities and differences between the creation stories contained in Hesiod 's Theogony and the biblical book of Genesis. The similarities and differences between these works may reflect a great cultural similarity between human kind, and can reflect social understandings and interpretations of the outside world. Ultimately, however, the fact that creation stories such as these have been created at such different …show more content…\n\nThe Book of Genesis only mentions this a few times, however, when it does it is very clear cut. \" And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters\" (Genesis 1:2). Also in Hesiod 's Theogony, it is said that,\" First of all Chaos came into being; but next wide-breasted Gaea\" (Theogony 116-117). Both of these statements show how Genesis and Theogony explain that their creators created everything out of a void, nothingness, or chaos. This is important to understanding both of these works, as it must be noted that the Gods or God essentially saved us all from the deep nothingness that existed. Furthermore, another similarity that both the Book of Genesis and Hesiod 's Theogony share is the Biblical and Greek stories speak about a relationship between man and God. In both man is trying to placate God by offering sacrifices and God is not satisfied. This idea can be seen in the Book of Genesis through the story of Cain and Abel. \" And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord... And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering\" No specific reason is narrated in Genesis as to why God rejected Cain’s sacrifice; however, it is interesting that Abel’s sacrifice was an animal with its fat, while Cain offered produce, as it can relate to Greek culture. It is important to note that in Greek culture the sacrifice of an animal or agriculture, can be seen as an offering to the Gods. Lastly, Deception is a repeating theme in both the Book of Genesis and Hesiod 's Theogony. In Genesis, for example, the snake deceives Eve in the Garden of Eden. \" Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God"
