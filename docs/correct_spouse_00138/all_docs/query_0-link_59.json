These compounds also accumulate in hypoxic cells, where they can act as cytotoxins or imaging agents. However, whether these effects apply to cancer stem cells has not been sufficiently explored. Here we show that the 2-nitroimidazole doranidazole potentiates radiation-induced DNA damage in hypoxic glioma stem cells (GSCs) and confers a significant survival benefit in mice harboring GSC-derived tumors in radiotherapy settings. Furthermore, doranidazole and misonidazole, but not metronidazole, manifested radiation-independent cytotoxicity for hypoxic GSCs that was mediated by ferroptosis induced partially through blockade of mitochondrial complexes I and II and resultant metabolic alterations in oxidative stress responses. Doranidazole also limited the growth of GSC-derived subcutaneous tumors and that of tumors in orthotopic brain slices. Our results thus reveal the theranostic potential of 2-nitroimidazoles as ferroptosis inducers that enable targeting GSCs in their hypoxic niche.\n\n© 2020, The Author(s). FZR1/CDH1 is an activator of Anaphase promoting complex/Cyclosome (APC/C), best known for its role as E3 ubiquitin ligase that drives the cell cycle. APC/C activity is regulated by CDK-mediated phosphorylation of FZR1 during mitotic cell cycle. Although the critical role of FZR1 phosphorylation has been shown mainly in yeast and in vitro cell culture studies, its biological significance in mammalian tissues in vivo remained elusive. Here, we examined the in vivo role of FZR1 phosphorylation using a mouse model, in which non-phosphorylatable substitutions were introduced in the putative CDK-phosphorylation sites of FZR1. Although ablation of FZR1 phosphorylation did not show substantial consequences in mouse somatic tissues, it led to severe testicular defects resulting in male infertility. In the absence of FZR1 phosphorylation, male juvenile germ cells entered meiosis normally but failed to enter meiosis II or form differentiated spermatids. In aged testis, male mutant germ cells were overall abolished, showing Sertoli cell-only phenotype. In contrast, female mutants showed apparently normal progression of meiosis. The present study demonstrated that phosphorylation of FZR1 is required for temporal regulation of APC/C activity at meiosis II entry, and for maintenance of spermatogonia, which raised an insight into the sexual dimorphism of FZR1-regulation in germ cells.\n\n© 2020, The Author(s). Glioblastoma multiforme involves glioma stem cells (GSCs) that are resistant to various therapeutic approaches. Here, we studied the importance of paracrine signaling in the glioma microenvironment by focusing on the celecoxib-mediated role of chemokines C–C motif ligand 2 (CCL2), C-X-C ligand 10 (CXCL10), and their receptors, CCR2 and CXCR3, in GSCs and a GSC-bearing malignant glioma model. C57BL/6 mice were injected with orthotopic GSCs intracranially and divided into groups administered either 10 or 30 mg/kg celecoxib, or saline to examine the antitumor effects associated with chemokine expression. In GSCs, we analyzed cell viability and expression of chemokines and their receptors in the presence/absence of celecoxib. In the malignant glioma model, celecoxib exhibited antitumor effects in a dose dependent manner and decreased protein and mRNA levels of Ccl2 and CxcL10 and Cxcr3 but not of Ccr2. CCL2 and CXCL10 co-localized with Nestin+ stem cells, CD16+ or CD163+ macrophages and Iba-1+ microglia. In GSCs, celecoxib inhibited Ccl2 and Cxcr3 expression in a nuclear factor-kappa B-dependent manner but not Ccr2 and CxcL10. Moreover, Ccl2 silencing resulted in decreased GSC viability. These results suggest that celecoxib-mediated regulation of the CCL2/CCR2 and CXCL10/ CXCR3 axes may partially contribute to glioma-specific antitumor effects.\n\n© 2020, The Author(s). Metastasis of cancer cells to the brain occurs frequently in patients with certain subtypes of breast cancer. In particular, patients with HER2-positive or triple-negative breast cancer are at high risk for the development of brain metastases. Despite recent advances in the treatment of primary breast tumors, the prognosis of breast cancer patients with brain metastases remains poor. A better understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying brain metastasis might be expected to lead to improvements in the overall survival rate for these patients. Recent studies have revealed complex interactions between metastatic cancer cells and their microenvironment in the brain. Such interactions result in the activation of various signaling pathways related to metastasis in both cancer cells and cells of the microenvironment including astrocytes and microglia. In this review, we focus on such interactions and on their role both in the metastatic process and as potential targets for therapeutic intervention.\n\n© 2020 The Authors.

To develop novel therapeutic strategies that target CSCs, we established osteosarcoma-initiating (OSi) cells by introducing the c-Myc gene into bone marrow stromal cells derived from Ink4a/Arf KO mice. These OSi cells include bipotent committed cells (similar to osteochondral progenitor cells) with a high tumorigenic activity as well as tripotent cells (similar to mesenchymal stem cells) of low tumorigenicity. We recently showed that the tripotent OSi cells are highly resistant to chemotherapeutic agents, and that depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton in these cells induces their terminal adipocyte differentiation and suppresses their tumorigenicity. We here provide an overview of modulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics associated with terminal adipocyte differentiation in osteosarcoma as well as discuss the prospects for new therapeutic strategies that target chemoresistant CSCs by inducing their differentiation.\n\n© 2020 Molecular Biology Society of Japan and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd Adipocyte differentiation is accompanied by a pronounced change in the actin cytoskeleton characterized by the reorganization of filamentous (F)-actin stress fibers into cortical F-actin structures. We previously showed that depolymerization of F-actin stress fibers induced by inactivation of RhoA–ROCK (Rho-associated kinase) signaling acts as a trigger for adipocyte differentiation. The relevance and underlying mechanism of the formation of cortical F-actin structures from depolymerized actin during adipocyte differentiation have remained unclear, however. We have now examined the mechanistic relation between actin dynamics and adipogenic induction. Transient exposure to the actin-depolymerizing agent latrunculin A (LatA) supported the formation of adipocyte-associated cortical actin structures and the completion of terminal adipocyte differentiation in the presence of insulin, whereas long-term exposure to LatA prevented such actin reorganization as well as terminal adipogenesis. Moreover, these effects of insulin were prevented by inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)–Rac1 signaling and the actin-related protein 2/3 (Arp2/3) complex which is a critical component of the cortical actin networks. Our findings thus suggest that the insulin-PI3K-Rac1 axis leads to the formation of adipocyte-associated cortical actin structures which is essential for the completion of adipocyte differentiation.\n\n© Copyright 2020, by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020. Glioblastoma is the most aggressive brain tumor characterized by diffuse infiltration into the normal brain parenchyma. Neural stem cells are known to possess the tumor-tropic migratory capacity and thus can be used as cellular vehicles for targeted delivery of therapeutic agents. In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) suicide gene therapy for glioblastoma using neural stem/progenitor cells (NS/PCs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Although transduction of hiPSCs is preferable for a safe and stable supply in the clinical setting, high-level and/or constitutive HSV-TK expression was highly cytotoxic to hiPSCs. To overcome this problem, we used the tetracycline-inducible system to control the expression of HSV-TK. hiPSC-derived NS/PCs expressing HSV-TK were transplanted in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model of human glioblastoma. Glioblastoma cell growth in mice was dramatically inhibited following ganciclovir (GCV) administration. Survival of the mice was significantly prolonged with administration of GCV compared with control groups. Time-lapse imaging of organotypic brain slice cultures first demonstrated the directional migration of NS/PCs toward glioblastoma cells and the bystander killing effect upon GCV treatment. hiPSC-derived NS/PCs with HSV-TK/GCV suicide gene system may have considerable therapeutic potential for the treatment of glioblastoma.

Therefore, the identification of candidate markers to predict CCA recurrence is needed in order to effectively manage the disease. This study aims to examine the predictive value of cancer stem cell (CSC) markers on the progression and recurrence of CCA patients. Methods: The expression of 6 putative CSC markers, cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44), CD44 variant 6 (CD44v6), CD44 variants 8-10 (CD44v8-10), cluster of differentiation 133 (CD133), epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 (ALDH1A1), was investigated in 178 CCA tissue samples using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and analyzed with respect to clinicopathological data and patient outcome including recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). The candidate CSC markers were also investigated in serum from CCA patients, and explored for their predictive ability on CCA recurrence. Results: Elevated protein level of CD44 and positive expression of CD44v6 and CD44v8-10 were significantly associated with short RFS and OS, while high levels of ALDH1A1 were correlated with a favorable prognosis patient. The elevated CD44v6 level was also correlated with higher tumor staging, whereas a decreasing level of ALDH1A1 was correlated with lower tumor staging. The levels of CD44, CD44v6 and CD44v8-10 were also correlated and were associated with a poor outcome. Furthermore, soluble CD44, CD44v6, CD44v8-10 and EpCAM were significantly increased in the recurrence group for early stage CCA; they also correlated with high levels of the tumor marker CA19-9. Elevated levels of CD44, CD44v6, CD44v8-10 or EpCAM alone or in combination has the potential to predict CCA recurrence. Conclusions: The overexpression of CD44, CD44v6, CD44v8-10 and EpCAM increases predictability of post-operative CCA recurrence. Moreover, the overexpression of the panel of CSC markers combined with CA19-9 could improve our predictive ability for tumor recurrence in early stage CCA patients. This result may be beneficial for the patients in order to predict the outcome after treatment and may be useful for clinical intervention in order to improve patient survival.\n\n©2019 American Association for Cancer Research. Gliomas are the second most common primary brain tumors in adults. They are treated with combination therapies, including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. There are currently limited treatment options for recurrent gliomas, and new targeted therapies need to be identified, especially in glioblastomas, which have poor prognosis. Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations are detected in various tumors, including gliomas. Most patients with IDH mutant glioma harbor the IDH1R132H subtype. Mutant IDH catalyzes the conversion of a-ketoglutarate to the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), which induces aberrant epigenetic status and contributes to malignant progression, and is therefore a potential therapeutic target for IDH mutant tumors. The present study describes a novel, orally bioavailable selective mutant IDH1 inhibitor, DS-1001b. The drug has high blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability and inhibits IDH1R132H. Continuous administration of DS-1001b impaired tumor growth and decreased 2-HG levels in subcutaneous and intracranial xenograft models derived from a patient with glioblastoma with IDH1 mutation. Moreover, the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein was strongly induced by DS-1001b, suggesting that inhibition of mutant IDH1 promotes glial differentiation. These results reveal the efficacy of BBB-permeable DS-1001b in orthotopic patient-derived xenograft models and provide a preclinical rationale for the clinical testing of DS-1001b in recurrent gliomas.\n\nCopyright © 2020 Otsuki et al. The body coloration of animals is due to pigment cells derived from neural crest cells, which are multipotent and differentiate into diverse cell types. Medaka (Oryzias latipes) possesses four distinct types of pigment cells known as melanophores, xanthophores, iridophores, and leucophores. The few melanophore (fm) mutant of medaka is characterized by reduced numbers of melanophores and leucophores. We here identify kit-ligand a (kitlga) as the gene whose mutation gives rise to the fm phenotype. This identification was confirmed by generation of kitlga knockout medaka and the findings that these fish also manifest reduced numbers of melanophores and leucophores and fail to rescue the fm mutant phenotype. We also found that expression of sox5, pax7a, pax3a, and mitfa genes is down-regulated in both fm and kitlga knockout medaka, implicating c-Kit signaling in regulation of the expression of these genes as well as the encoded transcription factors in pigment cell specification. Our results may provide insight into the pathogenesis of c-Kit–related pigmentation disorders such as piebaldism in humans, and our kitlga knockout medaka may prove useful as a tool for drug screening.\n\n© 2019, The Author(s). Treatments for refractory glaucoma include trabeculectomy, in which a filtering bleb is created to reduce aqueous pressure. Mitomycin C (MMC) is often used as an adjuvant to reduce post-trabeculectomy bleb scarring and consequent failure. However, scarring sometimes still occurs. Thus, we searched for more effective trabeculectomy adjuvants with high-throughput screening (HTS) of a library of 1,165 off-patent drug compounds. This revealed that amsacrine (AMSA), a DNA topoisomerase II (TOP2) inhibitor, was the top candidate. Compared to MMC, rabbits that underwent trabeculectomy with 10% AMSA had lower IOP at 42, 56, and 70 days (P < 0.01 at all measurement points) and a higher bleb score at 28, 42, 56, and 70 days (P = < 0.01, 0.04, 0.04, and < 0.01, respectively). Compared to saline, rabbits that received 1% AMSA also had lower IOP and better bleb score at all time points, without a sharp drop in IOP just after surgery (all P < 0.01). Both effects were milder than MMC at 7 days (P = 0.02 and <0.01, respectively). Thus, this study showed that HTS may help identify new, promising uses for off-patent drugs. Furthermore, trabeculectomy with AMSA at a suitable concentration may improve the prognosis after trabeculectomy compared to MMC.\n\n© 2019 The Japanese Society for Regenerative Medicine Introduction: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an intractable and incurable neurological disease. It is a progressive disease characterized by muscle atrophy and weakness caused by selective vulnerability of upper and lower motor neurons. In disease research, it has been common to use mouse models carrying mutations in responsible genes for familial ALS as pathological models of ALS. However, there is no model that has reproduced the actual conditions of human spinal cord pathology. Thus, we developed a method of producing human spinal motor neurons using human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and an innovative experimental technique for drug screening. As a result, ropinirole hydrochloride was eventually discovered after considering such results as its preferable transitivity in the brain and tolerability, including possible adverse reactions. Therefore, we explore the safety, tolerability and efficacy of ropinirole hydrochloride as an ALS treatment in this clinical trial. Methods: The ROPALS trial is a single-center double-blind randomized parallel group-controlled trial of the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the ropinirole hydrochloride extended-release tablet (Requip CR) at 2- to 16-mg doses in patients with ALS. Twenty patients will be recruited for the active drug group (fifteen patients) and placebo group (five patients). All patients will be able to receive the standard ALS treatment of riluzole if not changed the dosage during this trial. The primary outcome will be safety and tolerability at 24 weeks, defined from the date of randomization. Secondary outcome will be the efficacy, including any change in the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R), change in the Combined Assessment of Function and Survival (CAFS), and the composite endpoint as a sum of Z-transformed scores on various clinical items. Notably, we will perform an explorative search for a drug effect evaluation using the patient-derived iPSCs to prove this trial concept. Eligible patients will have El Escorial Possible, clinically possible and laboratory-supported, clinically probable, or clinically definite amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with disease duration less than 60 months (inclusive), an ALSFRS-R score ≥2 points on all items and age from 20 to 80 years. Conclusion: Patient recruitment began in December 2018 and the last patient is expected to complete the trial protocol in November 2020.

Cancer Science published by John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd on behalf of Japanese Cancer Association. Targeting the function of membrane transporters in cancer stemlike cells is a potential new therapeutic approach. Cystine-glutamate antiporter xCT expressed in CD44 variant (CD44v)-expressing cancer cells contributes to the resistance to oxidative stress as well as cancer therapy through promoting glutathione (GSH)-mediated antioxidant defense. Amino acid transport by xCT might, thus, be a promising target for cancer treatment, whereas the determination factors for cancer cell sensitivity to xCT-targeted therapy remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that high expression of xCT and glutamine transporter ASCT2 is correlated with undifferentiated status and diminished along with cell differentiation in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The cytotoxicity of the xCT inhibitor sulfasalazine relies on ASCT2-dependent glutamine uptake and glutamate dehydrogenase (GLUD)-mediated α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) production. Metabolome analysis revealed that sulfasalazine treatment triggers the increase of glutamate-derived tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate α-KG, in addition to the decrease of cysteine and GSH content. Furthermore, ablation of GLUD markedly reduced the sulfasalazine cytotoxicity in CD44v-expressing stemlike HNSCC cells. Thus, xCT inhibition by sulfasalazine leads to the impairment of GSH synthesis and enhancement of mitochondrial metabolism, leading to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and, thereby, triggers oxidative damage. Our findings establish a rationale for the use of glutamine metabolism (glutaminolysis)-related genes, including ASCT2 and GLUD, as biomarkers to predict the efficacy of xCT-targeted therapy for heterogeneous HNSCC tumors.\n\n© 2019 Elsevier Inc. Introduction: Chemical intervention of autophagy has been investigated in clinical trials for various age-related conditions such as sarcopenia and neurodegeneration. However, at present, no autophagy inducer has been established as a disease-modifying agent against neurodegenerative diseases. Methods: We screened a library consisting of 796 medicines clinically approved (in Japan) for autophagy enhancers as potential neurodegeneration therapeutics using HeLa cells stably expressing green fluorescent protein-microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (GFP-LC3) followed by an analysis of the molecular mechanisms using various neuronal models. Results: The primary screening identified 152 hits in a static cellular state. A widely available Alzheimer's disease drug, memantine, which antagonizes N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), was one of the hits. Memantine increased the levels of LC3-II in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner, and upregulated autophagic flux. In addition, the pharmacological effects of memantine on autophagy were independent of mTORC1 activity and NMDAR activation. Furthermore, a VPS34 inhibitor suppressed the memantine-induced LC3-II upregulation, suggesting that memantine may affect VPS34 complex activity. Notably, intracellular Huntington's disease-specific aggregates of elongated huntingtin, a well-established autophagy substrate, were significantly decreased by memantine. In addition, memantine enhanced elimination of degraded mitochondrial in neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells of PARK2 or PARK6 patients, who exhibited defective PINK1/parkin-mediated mitophagy, suggests that memantine accelerated the clearance of damaged mitochondria. Conclusion: These findings indicate that memantine may be beneficial for the treatment of neurodegeneration characterized by the abnormal accumulation of autophagy or mitophagy substrates.\n\nIn many cancers, high proliferation rates correlate with elevation of rRNA and tRNA levels, and nucleolar hypertrophy. However, the underlying mechanisms linking increased nucleolar transcription and tumorigenesis are only minimally understood. Here we show that IMP dehydrogenase-2 (IMPDH2), the rate-limiting enzyme for de novo guanine nucleotide biosynthesis, is overexpressed in the highly lethal brain cancer glioblastoma. This leads to increased rRNA and tRNA synthesis, stabilization of the nucleolar GTP-binding protein nucleostemin, and enlarged, malformed nucleoli. Pharmacological or genetic inactivation of IMPDH2 in glioblastoma reverses these effects and inhibits cell proliferation, whereas untransformed glia cells are unaffected by similar IMPDH2 perturbations. Impairment of IMPDH2 activity triggers nucleolar stress and growth arrest of glioblastoma cells even in the absence of functional p53. Our results reveal that upregulation of IMPDH2 is a prerequisite for the occurance of aberrant nucleolar function and increased anabolic processes in glioblastoma, which constitutes a primary event in gliomagenesis.\n\n© 2019 American Association for Cancer Research. Tumors comprise heterogeneous cell types including cancer stem cells (CSC), progenitor cells, and differentiated cells. Chemoresistance is a potential cause of relapse and a key characteristic of CSC, but the development of novel therapeutic approaches for targeting these cells has been limited. We previously established osteosarcoma-initiating (OSi) cells by introducing the gene for c-Myc into bone marrow stromal cells of Ink4a/Arf knockout mice. These OSi cells are composed of two distinct clones: highly tumorigenic cells (AX cells), similar to bipotent committed osteochondral progenitor cells, and tripotent cells of low tumorigenicity (AO cells), similar to mesenchymal stemcells. Here we show that depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton induces terminal adipocyte differentiation and suppresses tumorigenesis in chemoresistant OSi cells. In contrast to AX cells, AO cells were highly resistant to conventional chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin and were thus identified as chemoresistant cells. Inhibition of Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK) elicited terminal adipocyte differentiation in chemoresistant AO cells through negative regulation of the transcriptional coactivator megakaryoblastic leukemia 1 associated with actin depolymerization. The clinically administered ROCK inhibitor fasudil significantly suppressed growth in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo of chemoresistant AO cells as well as of OSi cells. Our findings thus suggest a new therapeutic strategy based on the induction of trans-terminal differentiation via modulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics for therapyresistant osteosarcoma stem cells.\n\n© 2019 Elsevier B.V. Nanomedicine modification with ligands directed to receptors on tumor blood vessels has the potential for selectively enhancing nanomedicine accumulation in malignant tissues by overcoming the vascular barrier of tumors. Nevertheless, the development of broadly applicable ligand approaches capable of promoting the transvascular transport of nanomedicines in a wide spectrum of tumors has been elusive so far. By considering the indispensable and persistent glycolytic fueling of tumors, we developed glucose-installed polymeric micelles loading cisplatin (Gluc-CDDP/m) targeting the glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), which is overexpressed in most tumors and present on vascular endothelial cells, toward improving the delivery efficiency and therapeutic efficacy. The design of the glucose ligands on Gluc-CDDP/m was engineered to control the conjugation via the carbon 6 of the glucose moieties, as well as the ligand density on the poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) shell of the micelles. The series of micelles was then studied in vitro and in vivo against GLUT1-high human squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck OSC-19 cells and GLUT1-low human glioblastoma-astrocytoma U87MG cells. Our results showed that precisely tuning the micelles to have glucose ligands on 25% of their PEG chains increased the efficacy against the tumors by significantly enhancing the tumor accumulation, even in GLUT1-low U87MG tumors. The enhancement of the intratumoral levels of these micelles was hindered by concomitant administration of glucose, or the GLUT1 inhibitor STF-31, confirming a GLUT1/glucose-mediated increment of the accumulation. Intravital confocal laser scanning microscopy imaging of tumor tissues further demonstrated the rapid extravasation and penetration of Gluc-CDDP/m in OSC-19 tumors compared to non-targeted CDDP/m. These findings indicate GLUT1-targeting as a promising approach for overcoming the vascular barrier and boosting the delivery of nanomedicine in tumors.\n\nGlioblastoma exhibits phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity, aggressive invasiveness, therapeutic resistance, and tumor recurrence, which can be explained by the existence of glioma stem cells (GSCs). In this study, we visualized the spatiotemporal dynamics of invasion of human GSCs in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model using time-lapse imaging of organotypic brain slice cultures and three-dimensional imaging of optically cleared whole brains. GSCs implanted in the striatum exhibited directional migration toward axon bundles, perivascular area, and the subventricular zone around the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle. GSCs migrated in a helical pattern around axon bundles in the striatum and invaded broadly in both the rostral and caudal directions. GSCs in the corpus callosum migrated more rapidly and unidirectionally toward the contralateral side with pseudopod extension. These characteristics of GSC invasion shared histological features observed in glioblastoma patients. Spatiotemporal visualization techniques can contribute to the elucidation of the mechanisms underlying GSC invasion that may lead to the development of effective therapy for glioblastoma.\n\n© 2018, The Author(s). Metastasis is a complex multistep process that involves critical interactions between cancer cells and a variety of stromal components in the tumor microenvironment, which profoundly influence the different aspects of the metastatic cascade and organ tropism of disseminating cancer cells. Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecological malignancy and is characterized by peritoneal disseminated metastasis. Evidence has demonstrated that ovarian cancer possesses specific metastatic tropism for the adipose-rich omentum, which has a pivotal role in the creation of the metastatic tumor microenvironment in the intraperitoneal cavity. Considering the distinct biology of ovarian cancer metastasis, the elucidation of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the reciprocal interplay between ovarian cancer cells and surrounding stromal cell types in the adipose-rich metastatic microenvironment will provide further insights into the development of novel therapeutic approaches for patients with advanced ovarian cancer. Herein, we review the biological mechanisms that regulate the highly orchestrated crosstalk between ovarian cancer cells and various cancer-associated stromal cells in the metastatic tumor microenvironment with regard to the omentum by illustrating how different stromal cells concertedly contribute to the development of ovarian cancer metastasis and metastatic tropism for the omentum.\n\n© 2019 The Authors.

The prognostic role of CD44v9, a variant isoform of CD44 and a new cell surface marker of cancer stem cells, remains unclear in bladder cancer (BC) patients. Furthermore, limited information is available on the functional role of sulfasalazine (SSZ), which could modulate the CD44v9-xCT system in order to enhance cisplatin (CDDP)-induced cytotoxicity and inhibit the metastatic potential of BC. CD44v9 protein expression was examined immunohistochemically in 63 muscle invasive BC (MIBC) patients who underwent radical cystectomy. CD44v9 expression was independently associated with disease recurrence and cancer-specific death in MIBC. Cytotoxic effects, glutathione levels, and reactive oxygen species production by SSZ and CD44v9 and phospho-p38 MAPK protein expression by SSZ with or without CDDP were assessed in MBT-2V cells with highly metastatic potential. Sulfasalazine exerted cytotoxic effects against MBT-2V cells by inhibiting glutathione levels and inducing the production of reactive oxygen species. Sulfasalazine in combination with CDDP appeared to exert strong cytotoxic effects against MBT-2V cells by inhibiting CD44v9 expression and upregulating phospho-p38 MAPK expression. The inhibitory effects of SSZ with or without CDDP were also investigated using an MBT-2V lung metastatic model. In the murine lung metastatic BC model, SSZ significantly prolonged animal survival. Furthermore, the combination of SSZ with CDDP exerted stronger inhibitory effects on the establishment of lung tumor nodules than SSZ or CDDP alone. CD44v9 expression could be a clinical biomarker for predicting poor outcomes in MIBC patients. Sulfasalazine in combination with CDDP has potential as a novel therapy against metastatic BC.\n\n© 2019 by the American Thoracic Society. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) pathogenesis shares similarities with carcinogenesis. One CD44 variant (CD44v) isoform, CD44v8-10, binds to and stabilizes the cystine transporter subunit (xCT), producing reduced glutathione and thereby enhancing the antioxidant defense of cancer stem cells. Pharmacological inhibition of xCT by sulfasalazine suppresses tumor growth, survival, and resistance to chemotherapy. We investigated whether the CD44v-xCT axis contributes to PAH pathogenesis. CD44v was predominantly expressed on endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT)-like cells in the neointimal layer of PAH affected pulmonary arterioles. In vitro, CD44 standard form and CD44v were induced as a result of EndMT. Among human pulmonary artery endothelial cells that have undergone EndMT, CD44v+ cells showed high levels of xCT expression on their cell surfaces and high concentrations of glutathione for survival. This made CD44v+ cells the most vulnerable target for sulfasalazine. CD44v+xCThi cells showed the highest expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines, antioxidant enzymes, antiapoptotic molecules, and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. In the Sugen5416/hypoxia mouse model, CD44v+ cells were present in the thickened pulmonary vascular wall. The administration of sulfasalazine started either at the same time as \"Sugen5416\" administration (a prevention model) or after the development of pulmonary hypertension (a reversal model) attenuated the muscularization of the pulmonary vessels, decreased the expression of markers of inflammation, and reduced the right ventricular systolic pressure, while reducing CD44v+ cells. In conclusion, CD44v+xCThi cells appear during EndMT and in pulmonary hypertension tissues. Sulfasalazine is expected to be a novel therapeutic agent for PAH, most likely targeting EndMT-derived CD44v+xCThi cells.\n\n© 2019 The Authors Background & Aims: CD44 variant 9 (CD44v9)-positive cancer stem-like cells strongly contribute to the development and recurrence of gastric cancer. However, the origin of CD44v9-positive cells is uncertain. Methods: CD44v9, β-catenin, and epithelial splicing regulatory protein 1 signals were assessed by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, immunoblot analysis, or immunofluorescence microscopy. Capping actin protein of muscle Z-line α subunit 1 (CAPZA1) expression was assessed by immunoblot analysis or immunohistochemical analysis of Mongolian gerbils' gastric mucosa or human biopsy specimens. Levels of oxidative stress were assessed by measuring malondialdehyde and protein carbonylation. Histone H3 acetylation levels in the CAPZA1 proximal promoter region were measured by using chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis with an antibody against the acetylated histone H3 in human gastric carcinoma cell line (AGS) cells. Results: CD44v9 is expressed in CAPZA1-overexpressing cells in human gastric cancer tissues. CAPZA1 overexpression enhanced expression of β-catenin, which is a transcription factor for CD44, and epithelial splicing regulatory protein 1, which increases alternative splicing of CD44 to generate CD44v9. CAPZA1-overexpressing cells after cytotoxin-associated gene A accumulation showed CD44v9 expression by inducing nuclear accumulation of β-catenin, concomitant with the enhancement of expression of Sal-like protein 4 and Krüppel-like factor 5, which encode reprogramming factors. Oxidative stress increased the CAPZA1 expression in AGS cells through the enhancement of histone H3 acetylation of CAPZA1 promoter. CAPZA1 expression was increased depending on oxidative stress in H pylori–infected gastric mucosa. Conclusions: CD44v9 expression is evoked from CAPZA1-overexpressing cells after accumulation of cytotoxin-associated gene A. Our findings provide important insights into the mechanisms underlying the development of CD44v9-positive cells.\n\n© 2019 The Authors.

The major cellular antioxidant glutathione (GSH) protects cancer cells from oxidative damage that can lead to the induction of ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of cell death triggered by the aberrant accumulation of lipid peroxides. Inhibitors of the cystine-glutamate antiporter subunit xCT, which mediates the uptake of extracellular cystine and thereby promotes GSH synthesis, are thus potential anticancer agents. However, the efficacy of xCT-targeted therapy has been found to be diminished by metabolic reprogramming that affects redox status in cancer cells. Identification of drugs for combination with xCT inhibitors that are able to overcome resistance to xCT-targeted therapy might thus provide the basis for effective cancer treatment. We have now identified the vasodilator oxyfedrine (OXY) as a sensitizer of cancer cells to GSH-depleting agents including the xCT inhibitor sulfasalazine (SSZ). Oxyfedrine contains a structural motif required for covalent inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) enzymes, and combined treatment with OXY and SSZ was found to induce accumulation of the cytotoxic aldehyde 4-hydroxynonenal and cell death in SSZ-resistant cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Microarray analysis of tumor xenograft tissue showed cyclooxygenase-2 expression as a potential biomarker for the efficacy of such combination therapy. Furthermore, OXY-mediated ALDH inhibition was found to sensitize cancer cells to GSH depletion induced by radiation therapy in vitro. Our findings thus establish a rationale for repurposing of OXY as a sensitizing drug for cancer treatment with agents that induce GSH depletion.\n\n© 2018 The Author(s). CD44 variant (CD44v) contributes to cancer stemness by stabilizing the xCT subunit of system xc(-) and thereby promoting its glutamate-cystine antiporter activity. CD44 has also been implicated in autoimmune insulitis and inflammation in diabetic islets, but whether CD44v regulates insulin secretion has remained unclear. Here we show that CD44v inhibits insulin secretion by attenuating amino acid transport mediated by the L-type amino acid transporter LAT1. CD44v expression level was inversely related to insulin content in islets of normal and diabetic model mice. Knockdown of CD44 increased insulin secretion, the intracellular insulin level, and the transport of neutral amino acids mediated by LAT1 in Min6 cells. Attenuation of the uptake of neutral amino acids with a LAT inhibitor reduced insulin secretion and insulin content in Min6 cells, whereas overexpression of LAT1 increased insulin secretion. Moreover, inhibition of LAT1 prevented the increase in insulin secretion and content induced by CD44 depletion in Min6 cells. Our results thus implicate CD44v in the regulation of insulin secretion and reveal that amino acid transport is rate limiting for such secretion. They further suggest that amino acid transport mediated by LAT1 is a potential therapeutic target for diabetes.\n\n© 2018 The Author(s). Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is caused by germline mutations in the NF1 gene and is characterized by café au lait spots and benign tumours known as neurofibromas. NF1 encodes the tumour suppressor protein neurofibromin, which negatively regulates the small GTPase Ras, with the constitutive activation of Ras signalling resulting from NF1 mutations being thought to underlie neurofibroma development. We previously showed that knockdown of neurofibromin triggers epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signalling and that such signalling is activated in NF1-associated neurofibromas. With the use of a cell-based drug screening assay, we have now identified the antiallergy drug tranilast (N-(3,4-dimethoxycinnamoyl) anthranilic acid) as an inhibitor of EMT and found that it attenuated the expression of mesenchymal markers and angiogenesis-related genes in NF1-mutated sNF96.2 cells and in neurofibroma cells from NF1 patients. Tranilast also suppressed the proliferation of neurofibromin-deficient cells in vitro more effectively than it did that of intact cells. In addition, tranilast inhibited sNF96.2 cell migration and proliferation in vivo. Knockdown of type III collagen (COL3A1) also suppressed the proliferation of neurofibroma cells, whereas expression of COL3A1 and SOX2 was increased in tranilast-resistant cells, suggesting that COL3A1 and the transcription factor SOX2 might contribute to the development of tranilast resistance.\n\n© 2018 The Authors. Cancer Science published by John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd on behalf of Japanese Cancer Association. Autocrine and paracrine factors, including glutamate and epidermal growth factor (EGF), are potent inducers of brain tumor cell invasion, a pathological hallmark of malignant gliomas. System xc(–) consists of xCT and CD98hc subunits and functions as a plasma membrane antiporter for the uptake of extracellular cystine in exchange for intracellular glutamate. We previously showed that the EGF receptor (EGFR) interacts with xCT and thereby promotes the activity of system xc(–) in a kinase-independent manner, resulting in enhanced glutamate release in glioma cells. However, the molecular mechanism underlying EGFR-mediated glioma progression in a glutamate-rich microenvironment has remained unclear. Here we show that the GluN2B subunit of the N-methyl-d-aspartate–sensitive glutamate receptor (NMDAR) is a substrate of EGFR in glioma cells. In response to EGF stimulation, EGFR phosphorylated the COOH-terminal domain of GluN2B and thereby enhanced glutamate-NMDAR signaling and consequent cell migration in EGFR-overexpressing glioma cells. Treatment with the NMDAR inhibitor MK-801 or the system xc(–) inhibitor sulfasalazine suppressed EGF-elicited glioma cell migration. The administration of sulfasalazine and MK-801 also synergistically suppressed the growth of subcutaneous tumors formed by EGFR-overexpressing glioma cells. Furthermore, shRNA-mediated knockdown of xCT and GluN2B cooperatively prolonged the survival of mice injected intracerebrally with such glioma cells. Our findings thus establish a central role for EGFR in the signaling crosstalk between xCT and GluN2B-containing NMDAR in glioma cells.\n\n© 2018 The Author(s) Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disease caused by selective degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra. Although most cases of PD are sporadic cases, familial PD provides a versatile research model for basic mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of PD. In this study, we generated DA neurons from PARK2 patient-specific, isogenic PARK2 null and PARK6 patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells and found that these neurons exhibited more apoptosis and greater susceptibility to rotenone-induced mitochondrial stress. From phenotypic screening with an FDA-approved drug library, one voltage-gated calcium channel antagonist, benidipine, was found to suppress rotenone-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, we demonstrated the dysregulation of calcium homeostasis and increased susceptibility to rotenone-induced stress in PD, which is prevented by T-type calcium channel knockdown or antagonists. These findings suggest that calcium homeostasis in DA neurons might be a useful target for developing new drugs for PD patients. Our study demonstrate the dysregulation of calcium homeostasis and increased susceptibility to rotenone-induced stress in PD patient-derived DA neurons, which are further prevented by T-type calcium channel antagonists. These findings suggest that calcium homeostasis in DA neurons would be a useful target for developing new drugs for PD patients.\n\n© 2018 International Institute of Anticancer Research.All right reserved. Background/Aim: Cancer stem cells (CSCs) play a critical role in resistance to chemotherapy. CD44 is a cell surface marker of CSCs. CD44 variant 9 (CD44v9) interacts with a cystine-glutamate antiporter (xCT) and is an unfavorable predictive factor in gastric cancer. We investigated the impact of CD44v9 expression on 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) resistance and the efficacy of the xCT inhibitor, sulfasalazine (SASP), in improving drug resistance. Materials and Methods: The human gastric cancer cell line MKN28 was transfected with pRc/CMV plasmids encoding human CD44 or CD44v9, which were used for in vitro and in vivo experiments. Results: CD44v9 expression results in 5-FU resistance by increasing intracellular glutathione and suppressing the drug-induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). SASP improved the drug sensitivity of CD44v9-expressing cells. Conclusion: Inhibition of xCT improved the clinical efficacy of chemotherapy against gastric cancer. CD44v9 expression can be a novel biomarker to predict resistance against 5-FU in gastric cancer.\n\n© 2018, The Author(s). Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a heterogeneous motor neuron disease for which no effective treatment is available, despite decades of research into SOD1-mutant familial ALS (FALS). The majority of ALS patients have no familial history, making the modeling of sporadic ALS (SALS) essential to the development of ALS therapeutics. However, as mutations underlying ALS pathogenesis have not yet been identified, it remains difficult to establish useful models of SALS. Using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology to generate stem and differentiated cells retaining the patients’ full genetic information, we have established a large number of in vitro cellular models of SALS. These models showed phenotypic differences in their pattern of neuronal degeneration, types of abnormal protein aggregates, cell death mechanisms, and onset and progression of these phenotypes in vitro among cases. We therefore developed a system for case clustering capable of subdividing these heterogeneous SALS models by their in vitro characteristics. We further evaluated multiple-phenotype rescue of these subclassified SALS models using agents selected from non-SOD1 FALS models, and identified ropinirole as a potential therapeutic candidate. Integration of the datasets acquired in this study permitted the visualization of molecular pathologies shared across a wide range of SALS models.\n\n© 2018 Mukai et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited. Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a marked complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and multiple organs can be affected by cGVHD-induced inflammation and fibrosis. In clinical settings, immunosuppressive agents have been the last resort to treat cGVHD. However, it has been only partially effective for cGVHD. Hence, efficacious treatment of cGVHD is eagerly awaited. Our previous work suggested that oxidative stress was elevated in cGVHD-disordered lacrimal glands and that epithelial-To-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was implicated in fibrosis caused by ocular cGVHD. In addition, our recent article demonstrated that thioredoxin interaction protein (TXNIP) and transcription factor nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) were associated with the development of cGVHD. After our search for effective drugs, we chose tranilast to combat systemic cGVHD. Tranilast is known to (1) act as an inhibitor of the inflammatory molecules TXNIP and NF-κB and (2) exert anti-fibrotic, anti-EMT and anti-oxidative effects. To investigate the effectiveness of tranilast for cGVHD, we used an MHC-compatible, multiple minor histocompatibility antigen-mismatched murine model of cGVHD. Tranilast or a solvent-vehicle were orally given to the allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) recipients from the day before allo-BMT (Day-1) to Day 27 after allo-BMT. Their cGVHD-vulnerable organs were collected Day 28 after allo-BMT and analyzed by using various methods such as histology, immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. As indicated by our results, tranilast alleviated cGVHD-elicited inflammation and fibrosis by suppressing the expression and/or activation of TXNIP and NF-κB and preventing EMT. Taken together, although this strategy may not be a complete cure for cGVHD, tranilast could be a promising medication to ameliorate cGVHD-Triggered disabling symptoms.\n\n© Okazaki et al. The cystine-glutamate antiporter subunit xCT suppresses iron-dependent oxidative cell death (ferroptosis) and is therefore a promising target for cancer treatment. Given that cancer cells often show resistance to xCT inhibition resulting in glutathione (GSH) deficiency, however, we here performed a synthetic lethal screen of a drug library to identify agents that sensitize the GSH deficiency-resistant cancer cells to the xCT inhibitor sulfasalazine. This screen identified the oral anesthetic dyclonine which has been recently reported to act as a covalent inhibitor for aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs). Treatment with dyclonine induced intracellular accumulation of the toxic aldehyde 4-hydroxynonenal in a cooperative manner with sulfasalazine. Sulfasalazine-resistant head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells were found to highly express ALDH3A1 and knockdown of ALDH3A1 rendered these cells sensitive to sulfasalazine. The combination of dyclonine and sulfasalazine cooperatively suppressed the growth of highly ALDH3A1-expressing HNSCC or gastric tumors that were resistant to sulfasalazine monotherapy. Our findings establish a rationale for application of dyclonine as a sensitizer to xCT-targeted cancer therapy.\n\n© 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. Intratumoral human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) heterogeneity has been reported in 16–36% of HER2-positive breast cancer and its clinical impact is under discussion. We examined the biological effects of HER2-heterogeneity on mouse models and analyzed metastatic brains by RNA sequence analysis. A metastatic mouse model was developed using 231-Luc (triple negative cells) and 2 HER2-positive cell lines, namely, HER2-60 and HER2-90 which showed heterogeneous and monotonous HER2 expressions, respectively. Metastatic lesions developed in 3 weeks in all the mice injected with HER2-60 cells, and in 69% of the mice injected with HER2-90 and 87.5% of the mice injected with 231-Luc. The median survival days of mice injected with 231-Luc, HER2-60, and HER2-90 cells were 29 (n = 24), 24 (n = 22) and 30 (n = 13) days, respectively. RNA sequence analysis showed that CASP-1 and its related genes were significantly downregulated in metastatic brain tumors with HER2-60 cells. The low expression of caspase-1 could be a new prognostic biomarker for early relapse in HER2-positive breast cancer.\n\n© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide. Treatment options for lung cancer include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, molecularly targeted therapy including epidermal growth factor receptor or anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitors, and immunotherapy. These treatments can be administered alone or in combination. Despite therapeutic advances, however, lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death. Recent studies have indicated that epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is associated with malignancy in various types of cancer, and activation of EMT signaling in cancer cells is widely considered to contribute to metastasis, recurrence, or therapeutic resistance. In this review, we provide an overview of the role of EMT in the progression of lung cancer. We also discuss the prospects for new therapeutic strategies that target EMT signaling in lung cancer.

However, recent evidence suggests that at least a subset of glioma cells with stem cell-like properties can thrive on oxidative phosphorylation. It remains unclear whether both metabolic phenotypes support tumor propagation, if they are independent, and how stable they are. The present study investigated these questions with the use of isogenic murine glioma stem cells (GSCs). Methods. GSCs were established from tumors formed by Ink4a/Arf-null, H-RasV12-expressing glioma-initiating cells that differed in extracellular acidification potential. Metabolic characteristics of GSCs were determined by measurement of glucose, oxygen, and glutamine uptake, ATP content, and lactate production. Effects of metabolic inhibitors and changes in oxygen or nutrient availability on lactate production and tumorsphere growth were also determined. Results. GSCs were found either to consume more glucose and produce more lactate or to consume more oxygen and maintain a higher ATP content depending on the metabolic characteristics of the tumor cells of origin. The latter, mitochondrial-type GSCs increased lactate production after treatment with the oxidative phosphorylation inhibitor oligomycin or phenformin. Exposure to hypoxia also increased lactate production and expression of glycolysis-related enzymes and metabolites in mitochondrial-type GSCs in a reversible manner. Conclusions. Both glycolytic and mitochondrial-type energy production can sustain tumor propagation by isogenic GSCs. Whereas both phenotypes can be independent and stable, cells that rely on oxidative phosphorylation can also switch to a more glycolytic phenotype in response to metabolic stress, suggesting that plasticity is a further characteristic of GSC metabolism.\n\n© 2018, International & American Associations for Dental Research. This study investigated a case of spindle cell carcinoma (SpCC) in tongue pathological lesions. The patient experienced a local recurrence and distant metastasis after surgical intervention. Although standard chemotherapy was administered, a granulomatous mass continued to develop. This aggressive growth led to survival of the tumor. Secondary debulking surgery was performed to improve the patient’s quality of life at the request of the patient. Using a tissue sample derived from the secondary debulking surgery, we performed an analysis of the tumor’s cell surface antigens, differentiation potential, metastatic ability, and inhibition potential by anticancer reagents. In vitro analysis revealed that the cell population grown under adherent culture conditions expressed the mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) markers CD73, CD90, and CD105. The cell line established from this SpCC contained colony-forming unit fibroblasts (CFU-Fs) and exhibited multipotent differentiation into several mesenchymal lineages, including bone, cartilage, and fat. The SpCC cells also displayed vigorous mobilization. These characteristics suggested that they had the differentiation potential of mesenchymal cells, especially MSCs, rather than that of epithelial cells. The surgical specimen analyzed in this study resisted the molecular target reagent cetuximab, which is an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor. This clinical insight revealed that chemotherapy-resistant SpCC cells have different characteristics compared to most other cancer cells, which are sensitive to cetuximab. Our cell death assay revealed that SpCC cell death was induced by the anticancer drug imatinib, which is known to inhibit protein tyrosine kinase activity of ABL, platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα), and KIT. Here, we report recurrent SpCC with characteristics of MSCs and potential for treatment with imatinib.\n\n© 2018 The Author(s). Background: Cisplatin is the most commonly used chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of patients with metastatic and/or recurrent urothelial cancer. However, the effectiveness of these treatments is severely limited due to the development of cisplatin resistance. Cancer stem cells have been documented as one of the key hypotheses involved in chemoresistance. CD44v8-10 has been identified as one of the new cancer stem cells markers and was recently shown to enhance the antioxidant system by interaction with xCT, a subunit of the cystine transporter modulating intracellular glutathione synthesis. The aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical role of CD44v8-10 and the molecular mechanism underlying the acquisition of cisplatin resistance through CD44v8-10 in urothelial cancer. Methods: We analyzed the clinical significance of the immunohistochemical CD44v9 expression, which detects the immunogen of human CD44v8-10, in 77 urothelial cancer patients treated with cisplatin-based systemic chemotherapy for recurrence and/or metastasis. We then evaluated the biological role of CD44v8-10 in the acquisition of cisplatin resistance using the urothelial cancer cell lines, T24 and T24PR, which were generated to acquire resistance to cisplatin. Results: The 5-year cancer-specific survival rate was significantly lower in the CD44v9-positive group than in the CD44v9-negative group (P = 0.008). Multivariate analyses revealed that CD44v9 positivity was an independent risk factor of cancer-specific survival (P = 0.024, hazard ratio = 5.16) in urothelial cancer patients who had recurrence and/or metastasis and received cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The expression of CD44v8-10 and xCT was stronger in T24PR cells than in T24 cells. The amount of intracellular glutathione was significantly higher in T24PR cells than in T24 cells (p < 0.001), and intracellular reactive oxygen species production by cisplatin was lower in T24PR cells than in T24 cells. Furthermore, the knockdown of CD44v8-10 by siRNA led to the recovery of cisplatin sensitivity in T24PR cells. Conclusions: CD44v9 in tumor specimens has potential as a novel indicator for identifying a cisplatin-chemoresistant population among urothelial cancer patients. CD44v8-10 contributes to reactive oxygen species defenses, which are involved in chemoresistance, by promoting the function of xCT, which adjusts the synthesis of glutathione.\n\n© 2018 The Authors. Cancer Science published by John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd on behalf of Japanese Cancer Association. Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer death. A tumor-supportive microenvironment, or premetastatic niche, at potential secondary tumor sites plays an important role in metastasis, especially in tumor cell colonization. Although a fibrotic milieu is known to promote tumorigenesis and metastasis, the underlying molecular contributors to this effect have remained unclear. Here we show that periostin, a component of the extracellular matrix that functions in tissue remodeling, has a key role in formation of a fibrotic environment that promotes tumor metastatic colonization. We found that periostin was widely expressed in fibrotic lesions of mice with bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, and that up-regulation of periostin expression coincided with activation of myofibroblasts positive for α-smooth muscle actin. We established a lung metastasis model for B16 murine melanoma cells and showed that metastatic colonization of the lung by these cells was markedly promoted by bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. Inhibition of periostin expression by giving an intratracheal antisense oligonucleotide targeting periostin mRNA was found to suppress bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis and thereby to attenuate metastatic colonization of the lung by melanoma cells. Our results indicate that periostin is a key player in the development of bleomycin-induced fibrosis and consequent enhancement of tumor cell colonization in the lung. Our results therefore implicate periostin as a potential target for prevention or treatment of lung metastasis.\n\n© Yamauchi et al. Chemotherapy has been reported to increase the proportion of cancer stem cells (CSCs) and to promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype changes. Anti-HER2 therapy may provide a strategy for eliminating CSC and EMT, which contribute to therapeutic resistance. No study has determined the changes in the quantity or characteristics of CSCs or circulating tumor cells (CTCs) with EMT phenotype during preoperative anti-HER2 therapy, and whether these changes correlate to response to dual anti-HER2 therapy. In a prospective clinical trial to evaluate pharmacodynamic biomarkers, 18 patients with operable primary HER2-positive breast cancer received dual anti-Her2 preoperative therapy with trastuzumab and lapatinib with paclitaxel. Proportions of tumor cells with CSC characteristics and EMT markers in CTC's were estimated at baseline, after 6 and 18 weeks of preoperative therapy to determine the quantitative cutoff value to predict pathologic complete response (pCR). Out of 18 patients, 8 (44%) had a pCR; 5 of these 8 patients (62%) were positive for CD44v at baseline and none were positive on the 6-week biopsy. In contrast, 6 of the 10 patients without pCR exhibited persistent levels, or enrichment of CD44v proportion and expression at 6 and 18 weeks (p=0.0128). Other biomarkers were not statistically significant predictors of pCR. Enrichment of CD44v-positive tumor cells after dual anti-HER2 therapy alone may predict poor response to dual anti-HER2 therapy plus chemotherapy.\n\n© 2017 The Authors.

Malignant gliomas are primary tumors of the central nervous system characterized by diffuse infiltration into the brain and a high recurrence rate. Advances in comprehensive genomic studies have provided unprecedented insight into the genetic and molecular heterogeneity of these tumors and refined our understanding of their evolution from low to high grade. However, similar levels of phenotypic characterization are indispensable to understanding the complexity of malignant gliomas. Experimental glioma models have also achieved great progress in recent years. Advances in transgenic technologies and cell culture have allowed the establishment of mouse models that mirror the human disease with increasing fidelity and which support single-cell resolution for phenotypic analyses. Here we review the major types of preclinical glioma models, with an emphasis on how recent developments in experimental modeling have shed new light on two fundamental aspects of glioma phenotype, their cell of origin and their invasive potential.\n\n<p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a multi-factorial disease characterized by chronic inflammation and destruction of multiple joints. To date, various biologic treatments for RA such as anti-Tumor necrosis factor alpha antibodies have been developed; however, mechanisms underlying RA development remain unclear and targeted therapy for this condition has not been established. Here, we provide evidence that signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) promotes inflammation and joint erosion in a mouse model of arthritis. Stat3 global KO mice show early embryonic lethality; thus, we generated viable Stat3 conditional knockout adult mice and found that they were significantly resistant to collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), the most common RA model, compared with controls. We then used an in vitro culture system to screen ninety-six existing drugs to select Stat3 inhibitors and selected five candidate inhibitors. Among them, three significantly inhibited development of arthritis and joint erosion in CIA wild-Type mice. These findings suggest that Stat3 inhibitors may serve as promising drugs for RA therapy.</p>\n\n<p>Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease. Proximal tubules are considered to be the primary origin of pathogenic inflammatory cytokines in AKI. However, it remains unclear whether other cell types, including collecting duct (CD) cells, participate in inflammatory processes. The transcription factor GATA2 is specifically expressed in CD cells and maintains their cellular identity. To explore the pathophysiological function of GATA2 in AKI, we generated renal tubular cell-specific Gata2 deletion (G2CKO) mice and examined their susceptibility to ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI). Notably, G2CKO mice exhibited less severe kidney damage, with reduced granulomacrophagic infiltration upon IRI. Transcriptome analysis revealed that a series of inflammatory cytokine genes were downregulated in GATA2-deficient CD cells, suggesting that GATA2 induces inflammatory cytokine expression in diseased kidney CD cells. Through high-throughput chemical library screening, we identified a potent GATA inhibitor. The chemical reduces cytokine production in CD cells and protects the mouse kidney from IRI. These results revealed a novel pathological mechanism of renal IRI, namely, that CD cells produce inflammatory cytokines and promote IRI progression. In injured kidney CD cells, GATA2 exerts a proinflammatory function by upregulating inflammatory cytokine gene expression. GATA2 can therefore be considered a therapeutic target for AKI.</p>\n\n<p>Objectives The regulation of redox balance in cancer cells is an important factor in tumor development and chemoresistance, with oncogene activation having been shown to induce the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Activating mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) are oncogenic drivers in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but it has remained unknown whether ligand-independent EGFR signaling conferred by EGFR mutation triggers ROS generation in NSCLC cells. Materials and Methods HEK293T cells were transfected with an expression vector for mutant EGFR. The expression of CD44 variant (CD44v) isoforms in NSCLC cell lines was evaluated by flow cytometry. Cells were depleted of CD44v by RNA interference and assayed for ROS and glutathione (GSH) levels. The effect of CD44v on cisplatin sensitivity was evaluated in vitro with the MTS assay. Results EGFR signaling due to EGFR mutation increased ROS levels in transfected HEK293T cells. The expression of CD44v isoforms was found to be inversely correlated with basal ROS levels in EGFR mutation–positive NSCLC cell lines. Knockdown of CD44v induced depletion of intracellular GSH and increased ROS levels in EGFR-mutated NSCLC cells that express CD44v at a high level (CD44vhigh). In addition, depletion of GSH by treatment with buthionine-[S, R]-sulfoximine induced marked accumulation of ROS and enhanced the cytotoxicity of cisplatin in CD44vhigh EGFR-mutated NSCLC cells but not in corresponding CD44vlow cells. This enhancement of cisplatin cytotoxicity by GSH depletion was prevented by treatment with the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Knockdown of CD44v also enhanced cisplatin cytotoxicity in CD44vhigh EGFR mutation–positive NSCLC cells but not in CD44vlow cells. Conclusion Our results thus implicate CD44v in redox adaptation and as a potential target for treatment in CD44vhigh EGFR-mutated NSCLC cells.</p>\n\n<p>Therapeutic options for malignant brain tumors are limited, with new drugs being continuously evaluated. Organotypic brain slice culture has been adopted for neuroscience studies as a system that preserves brain architecture, cellular function, and the vascular network. However, the suitability of brain explants for anticancer drug evaluation has been unclear. We here adopted a mouse model of malignant glioma based on expression of H-RasV12 in Ink4a/Arf−/− neural stem/progenitor cells to establish tumor-bearing brain explants from adult mice. We treated the slices with cisplatin, temozolomide, paclitaxel, or tranilast and investigated the minimal assays required to assess drug effects. Serial fluorescence-based tumor imaging was sufficient for evaluation of cisplatin, a drug with a pronounced cytotoxic action, whereas immunostaining of cleaved caspase 3 (a marker of apoptosis) and of Ki67 (a marker of cell proliferation) was necessary for the assessment of temozolomide action and immunostaining for phosphorylated histone H3 (a marker of mitosis) allowed visualization of paclitaxel-specific effects. Staining for cleaved caspase 3 was also informative in the assessment of drug toxicity for normal brain tissue. Incubation of explants with fluorescently labeled antibodies to CD31 allowed real-time imaging of the microvascular network and complemented time-lapse imaging of tumor cell invasion into surrounding tissue. Our results suggest that a combination of fluorescence imaging and immunohistological staining allows a unified assessment of the effects of various classes of drug on the survival, proliferation, and invasion of glioma cells, and that organotypic brain slice culture is therefore a useful tool for evaluation of antiglioma drugs.</p>\n\n<p>Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a lipid and protein phosphatase that antagonizes signaling by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)–AKT signaling pathway. The PTEN gene is a major tumor suppressor, with mutations of this gene occurring frequently in tumors of humans and mice. We have now developed mutant medaka deficient in PTEN with the use of transcription activator–like effector nuclease (TALEN) technology. Medaka possesses two pten genes, ptena and ptenb, similar to zebrafish. We established 16 ptena mutant lines and two ptenb mutant lines. Homozygous single pten mutants were found to be viable and fertile. In contrast, pten double-knockout (dko) embryos manifested severe abnormalities in vasculogenesis, eye size, and tail development at 72 hours post fertilization (hpf) and died before hatching. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the ratio of phosphorylated to total forms of AKT (pAKT/AKT) in pten dko embryos was four times that in wild-type embryos, indicative of up-regulation of signaling by the PI3K-AKT pathway. Treatment of pten dko embryos with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 reduced the pAKT/AKT ratio by about one-half and partially rescued the defect in vasculogenesis. Additional inhibitors of the PI3K-AKT pathway, including rapamycin and N-α-tosyl-L-phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone, also partially restored vasculogenesis in the dko embryos. Our model system thus allows pten dko embryos to be readily distinguished from wild-type embryos at an early stage of development and is suitable for the screening of drugs able to compensate for PTEN deficiency.</p>\n\n© 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. Expression of CD44 in glioma cells was previously correlated with tumor grade and is considered a stem cell marker. CD44 stabilizes the cystine–glutamate transporter (xCT) and inhibits apoptosis in cancer stem cells (CSCs). Recently it was found that Sulfasalazine (SSZ), an anti-inflammatory drug, acts as an inhibitor of xCT and therefore has potential as a targeted therapy for CSCs. In this study, we tested an efficacy of SSZ against glioma stem cell model developed in rats. As poor penetration of blood–brain barrier resulted in insufficient efficacy of systemic SSZ treatment, SSZ was delivered locally with convection-enhanced delivery (CED). In vitro, expression of CD44 in glioma cells and efficacy of SSZ against glioma cells and glioma stem cells were confirmed. SSZ demonstrated anti-proliferative activity in a dose dependent manner against these cells. This activity was partially reversible with the addition of antioxidant, N-acetyl-l-cysteine, to the medium. In vivo, CED successfully delivered SSZ into the rat brain parenchyma. When delivered at 5 mM concentration, which was the highest possible concentration when SSZ was dissolved in water, CED of SSZ resulted in almost no tissue damage. Against highly malignant bRiTs-G3 brain tumor xenografted rat model; the glioma stem cell model, CED of SSZ at 5 mM concentration induced apoptosis and prolonged survival. Consequently, CED of SSZ induced glioma stem cell death without evidence of tissue damage to normal brain parenchyma. This strategy may be a promising targeted treatment against glioma stem cells.\n\n<p>Recalcitrant head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) usually relapses after therapy due to the enrichment of drug resistant cancer stem-like cells (CSCs). Nanomedicines have shown potential for eradicating both cancer cells and CSCs by effective intratumoral navigation for reaching particular cell populations and controlling drug delivery. The installation of ligands on nanomedicines is an attractive approach for improving the delivery to CSCs within tumors, though the development of CSC-selective ligand-receptor systems has been challenging. Herein, we found that the CSC subpopulation in HNSCC cells overexpresses αvβ5 integrins, which is preferentially expressed in tumor neovasculature and cancer cells, and can be effectively targeted by using cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp (cRGD) peptide. Thus, in this study, we propose installing cRGD peptide on micellar nanomedicines incorporating cisplatin for improving their activity against CSCs and enhancing survival. Both cisplatin-loaded micelles (CDDP/m) and cRGD-installed CDDP/m (cRGD-CDDP/m) were effective against HNSCC SAS-L1-Luc cells in vitro, though cRGD-installed CDDP/m was more potent than CDDP/m against the CSC fraction. In vivo, the cRGD-CDDP/m also showed significant antitumor activity against HNSCC orthotopic tumors, i.e. SAS-L1 and HSC-2. Moreover, cRGD-CDDP/m rapidly accumulated into the lymph node metastasis of SAS-L1 tumors, effectively inhibiting their growth, and prolonging mice survival. These findings indicate cRGD-installed nanomedicines as an advantageous strategy for targeting CSCs in HNSCC, and particularly, cRGD-CDDP/m as a significant therapeutic strategy against regionally advanced HNSCC.</p>\n\n<p>Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly invasive primary brain tumor that displays cellular heterogeneity, which is composed of glioma initiating cells (GICs) and their differentiated progeny. GICs play an important role in driving aggressive invasion. In particular, the interaction between GICs and blood vessels is critical because blood vessels are known to serve as routes for the invasion of GICs. However, the effect of endothelial cells on the three-dimensional (3D) invasion process of GICs as well as the spatial relationship between GICs and their differentiated progeny remains unclear. Here, we utilized a microfluidic device to recapitulate the 3D brain tumor microenvironments constituted by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and type I collagen. Using the device, we found that HUVECs promoted the 3D invasion of heterogeneous glioma cell populations into type I collagen gel. The invasion induced by HUVECs was predominantly preceded by cells positive for nestin, a neural stem cell marker. In contrast, cells positive for tubulin β3 (TUBB3), a differentiated cell marker, rarely preceded invasion. In addition, HUVECs induced the upregulation of TUBB3 in GICs. Finally, we found that the genes associated with invasion, such as integrins α2 and β3, were significantly upregulated in the presence of HUVECs. These results as well as the experimental approach provide valuable knowledge for the development of effective therapeutic strategies targeting the aggressive invasion of GBM.</p>\n\n<p>Introduction: Although endometriosis is a benign disease, it shares some features with cancers, such as invasiveness and the potential to metastasize. This study sought to investigate the epithelial-mesenchymal transition status in human endometriotic lesions. Material and methods: Thirteen endometriosis patients and 10 control women without endometriosis undergoing surgery for benign indications were recruited. We examined the expression of E-cadherin, vimentin, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition-induced transcriptional factors, such as Snail and ZEB1, by immunohistochemistry. We evaluated the expression of each marker in epithelial cells of both endometriotic lesions (ovarian endometrioma, deep infiltrating endometriosis, adenomyosis) and normal endometria. The correlation between ZEB1 expression and serum level of CA125 was also investigated. Results: Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that although E-cadherin, vimentin, and Snail were expressed in epithelia of normal endometria and endometriotic lesions, ZEB1 expression was only expressed in epithelia of endometriotic lesions. Additionally, ZEB1 was most frequently observed in epithelial cells of invasive endometriosis. The endometriosis patients with high serum CA125 level were more likely to have ZEB1-positive lesions. Conclusions: This is the first observation of ZEB1 expression in epithelial cells of benign disease. The preferential expression of ZEB1 in epithelial cells of endometriotic lesions suggests that these cells may have, at least in part, a higher level of mesenchymal features possibly via ZEB1-driven epithelial-mesenchymal transition than normal endometria and that ZEB1 can be a potential indicator of invasiveness or severity of endometriosis.</p>\n\n<p>Osteosarcoma is the most common type of primary bone tumor, and novel therapeutic approaches for this disease are urgently required. To identify effective agents, we screened a panel of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs in AXT cells, our newly established mouse osteosarcoma line, and identified calcitriol as a candidate compound with therapeutic efficacy for this disease. Calcitriol inhibited cell proliferation in AXT cells by blocking cell cycle progression. From a mechanistic standpoint, calcitriol induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which was potentially responsible for downregulation of cyclin D1, activation of p38 MAPK, and intracellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Knockdown of Atf4 or Ddit3 restored cell viability after calcitriol treatment, indicating that the ER stress response was indeed responsible for the anti-proliferative effect in AXT cells. Notably, the ER stress response was induced to a lesser extent in human osteosarcoma than in AXT cells, consistent with the weaker suppressive effect on cell growth in the human cells. Thus, the magnitude of ER stress induced by calcitriol might be an index of its anti-osteosarcoma effect. Although mice treated with calcitriol exhibited weight loss and elevated serum calcium levels, a single dose was sufficient to decrease osteosarcoma tumor size in vivo. Our findings suggest that calcitriol holds therapeutic potential for treatment of osteosarcoma, assuming that techniques to diminish its toxicity could be established. In addition, our results show that calcitriol could still be safely administered to osteosarcoma patients for its original purposes, including treatment of osteoporosis.</p>\n\n<p>Background &amp; Aims Fibroblasts that interact with cancer cells are called cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which promote progression of different tumor types. We investigated the characteristics and functions of CAFs in diffuse-type gastric cancers (DGCs) by analyzing features of their genome and gene expression patterns. Methods We isolated CAFs and adjacent non-cancer fibroblasts (NFs) from 110 gastric cancer (GC) tissues from patients who underwent gastrectomy in Japan from 2008 through 2016. Cells were identified using specific markers of various cell types by immunoblot and flow cytometry. We selected pairs of CAFs and NFs for whole-exome and RNA sequencing analyses, and compared expression of specific genes using quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Protein levels and phosphorylation were compared by immunoblot and immunofluorescence analyses. Rhomboid 5 homolog 2 (RHBDF2) was overexpressed from a transgene in fibroblasts or knocked down using small interfering RNAs. Motility and invasiveness of isolated fibroblasts and GC cell lines (AGS, KATOIII, MKN45, NUGC3, NUGC4, OCUM-2MD3 and OCUM-12 cell lines) were quantified by real-time imaging analyses. We analyzed 7 independent sets of DNA microarray data from patients with GC and associated expression levels of specific genes with patient survival times. Nude mice were given injections of OCUM-2MD3 in the stomach wall; tumors and metastases were collected and analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Results Many of the genes with increased expression in CAFs compared with NFs were associated with transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) activity. When CAFs were cultured in extracellular matrix, they became more motile than NFs; DGC cells incubated with CAFs were also more motile and invasive in vitro than DGC cells not incubated with CAFs. When injected into nude mice, CAF-incubated DGC cells invaded a greater number of lymphatic vessels than NF-incubated DGC cells. We identified RHBDF2 as a gene overexpressed in CAFs compared with NFs. Knockdown of RHBDF2 in CAFs reduced their elongation and motility in response to TGFB1, whereas overexpression of RHBDF2 in NFs increased their motility in extracellular matrix. RHBDF2 appeared to regulate oncogenic and non-canonical TGFB1 signaling. Knockdown of RHBDF2 in CAFs reduced cleavage of the TGFB receptor 1 (TGFBR1) by ADAM metallopeptidase domain 17 (ADAM17 or TACE) and reduced expression of genes that regulate motility. Incubation of NFs with in interleukin 1 alpha (IL1A), IL1B or tumor necrosis factor, secreted by DGCs, increased fibroblast expression of RHBDF2. Simultaneous high expression of these cytokines in GC samples was associated with shorter survival times of patients. Conclusions In CAFs isolated from human DGCs, we observed increased expression of RHBDF2, which regulates TGFB1 signaling. Expression of RHBDF2 in fibroblasts is induced by inflammatory cytokines (such as IL1A, IL1B, and tumor necrosis factor) secreted by DGCs. RHBDF2 promotes cleavage of TGFBR1 by activating TACE and motility of CAFs in response to TGFB1. These highly motile CAFs induce DGCs to invade extracellular matrix and lymphatic vessels in nude mice.</p>\n\n<p>Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene rearrangements (MLL+ALL) has a dismal prognosis and is characterized by high surface CD44 expression. Known that CD44 has the specific binding sites for a natural ligand hyaluronan (HA), we investigated biological effects of HA with different molecular sizes on MLL+ALL cell lines, and found that the addition of ultra-low-molecular-weight (ULMW)-HA strongly suppressed their thymidine uptakes. The MLL+ALL cell line lacking surface CD44 expression established by genome editing showed no suppression of thymidine uptake. Surface CD44-high B-precursor ALL cell lines other than MLL+, but not T-ALL cell lines, were also suppressed in their thymidine uptakes. The inhibition of thymidine uptakes was because of induction of cell death, but dead cells lacked features of apoptosis on cytospin smears and flow cytometric analysis. The cell death was neither blocked by pan-caspase inhibitor nor autophagy inhibitor, but was completely blocked by necrosis inhibitor necrostatin-1. Necrotic cell death was further supported by a marked release of a high-mobility protein group B1 and morphological changes on transmission electron microscopy. Elevation of intracellular reactive oxygen species production suggested a role for inducing this necrotic cell death. ULMW-HA-triggered cell death was similarly demonstrated in surface CD44-high primary B-precursor leukemia cells. Assuming that ULMW-HA is abundantly secreted at the site of infection and inflammation, this study sheds light on understanding the mechanism of a transient inflammation-associated remission of leukemia. Further, the CD44-targeting may become an effective approach in future for the treatment of refractory B-precursor ALL by its capability of predominantly eradicating CD44-high leukemia-initiating cells.</p>\n\n<p>Background: Preliminary studies have identified cancer stem cells (CSCs) in various cancers and there are several ongoing clinical studies targeting these cells. CD44 (standard or variant isoforms) and/or aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) expression is the most commonly used markers for the identification of CSCs. The goal of the current study was to examine the ability of CD44v, either alone or in combination with ALDH, to identify CSCs within human lung cancer cells lines. Methods: We examined several lung adenocarcinoma cell lines for the ability of CD44v and/or ALDH expression to enrich for cells with CSC characteristics such as in vitro differential proliferation rate, chemotherapeutic-resistance, tumorsphere formation, and in vivo tumorigenicity. We also compared their in vivo secondary tumor formation, and histological characteristics of their xenograft tumors, and examined their expression of PD-L1, EGFR, xCT, and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Results: Both CD44vhigh/ALDHhigh and CD44vhigh/ALDHlow cells were enriched in cells with CSC characteristics, with the CD44vhigh/ALDHlow cells being more proliferative and more resistant to chemotherapeutics, whereas CD44vhigh/ALDHhigh cells were more efficient in forming tumorspheres in vitro, in making primary xenograft tumors, and in propagating secondary tumors in vivo. Applying stricter sorting gates to select for cells with the highest CD44v/ALDH expression caused the CD44vhigh/ALDHlow cells to lose their high proliferation rates and chemotherapeutic resistance ability, but enriched for the tumorsphere-forming cells among the CD44vhigh/ALDHhigh and CD44vhigh/ALDHlow cells. CD44vhigh expression was associated with PD-L1 and xCT expression in both H1650 and HCC827 cells. This association was not modified by ALDH expression in the H1650 cell line. However, in the HCC827 cell line, ALDH expression was negatively associated with PD-L1 and positively associated with xCT expression. Conclusion: Lung adenocarcinoma cells with high CD44v expression are enriched for CSCs. Addition of ALDH as an enrichment marker bestowed some CSCs characteristics to CD44vhigh/ALDHlow cells and others to CD44vhigh/ALDHhigh cells. We propose that lung adenocarcinoma contains different CSCs, each of them endowed with different CSC characteristics.</p>\n\n<p>DEP domain containing 1 (DEPDC1) is a novel oncoantigen expressed in cancer cells, which presents oncogenic activity and high immunogenicity. Although DEPDC1 has been predicted to be a useful antigen for the development of a cancer vaccine, its pathophysiological roles in glioma have not been investigated. Here, we analyzed the expression and function of DEPDC1 in malignant glioma. DEPDC1 expression in glioma cell lines, glioma tissues, and brain tumor initiating cells (BTICs) was assessed by western blot and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The effect of DEPDC1 downregulation on cell growth and nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) signaling in glioma cells was investigated. Overall survival was assessed in mouse glioma models using human glioma cells and induced mouse brain tumor stem cells (imBTSCs) to determine the effect of DEPDC1 suppression in vivo. DEPDC1 expression was increased in glioma cell lines, tissues, and BTICs. Suppression of endogenous DEPDC1 expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibited glioma cell viability and induced apoptosis through NFκB signaling. In mouse glioma models using human glioma cells and imBTSCs, downregulation of DEPDC1 expression prolonged overall survival. These results suggest that DEPDC1 represents a target molecule for the treatment of glioma.</p>\n\n<p>A previous dose-escalation study of sulfasalazine (SSZ), an inhibitor of cystine-glutamate exchange transporter xc (–), in the variant form of CD44 (CD44v)-positive cancer stem cells (CSCs) suggested that administration of SSZ induces the reduction of CD44v-positive cells and intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH) levels in patients with advanced gastric cancer (AGC). Here we report a study to evaluate SSZ in combination with cisplatin in patients with CD44v-expressing AGC refractory to cisplatin. SSZ was given by oral administration four times daily with 2 weeks on and 1 week off. Cisplatin at 60 mg/m2 was administered every 3 weeks. Of the 15 patients who underwent prescreening of CD44v expression, 8 patients were positive, and 7 patients were treated with the dose level of SSZ at 6 g/day. One patient experienced dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) as grade 3 anorexia. Although no other patients experienced DLT, 4 patients required dose interruption or reduction of SSZ; thus, we terminated further dose escalation. No patient achieved objective response, but 1 patient completed six cycles with stable disease for more than 4 months as well as reduction of intratumoral GSH level. The combination of SSZ plus cisplatin was manageable, although dose modification was frequently required during a short observational period.</p>\n\n<p>CD44 exists as a standard (CD44s) isoform and different variant isoforms (CD44v) due to alternative splicing. While the complex nature of these different isoforms has not been fully elucidated, CD44v expression has been shown to exert oncogenic effects by promoting tumor progression, metastasis and resistance of tumor cells to chemotherapy. One of the CD44v isoforms, CD44v8-10, was recently shown to protect cancer cells from oxidative stress by increasing the synthesis of glutathione (GSH). However, data regarding CD44 isoform expression in malignant mesothelioma (MM) are still lacking. Here, we show that most of the MM cell lines express both the CD44s and CD44v isoforms, in contrast to non-tumorigenic mesothelial cells, which express only CD44s. Moreover, we show here that these MM cell lines are positive for CD44 variable exon 9, with CD44v8-10 among the variant isoforms expressed. The expression of CD44 variable exon 9 was found to be statistically associated with NF2 inactivation, a common occurrence in MM. Knockdown of CD44 reduced the protein level of xCT, a cystine transporter, and increased oxidative stress. However, an increase in GSH was also observed and was associated with enhanced chemoresistance in CD44-knockdown cells. Increased GSH was mediated by the Nrf2/AP-1-induced upregulation of GCLC, a subunit of the enzyme catalyzing GSH synthesis. Our results thus suggest that the response to CD44 depletion is cell type-dependent and, in cases such as MM cells, compensatory pathway(s) might be activated rheostatically to account for the loss of CD44 and counteract enhanced oxidative stress.</p>\n\n<p>FZR1 (fizzy-related protein homolog; also known as CDH1 [cell division cycle 20 related 1]) functions in the cell cycle as a specific activator of anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome ubiquitin ligase, regulating late mitosis, G1 phase, and activation of the G2-M checkpoint. FZR1 has been implicated as both a tumor suppressor and oncoprotein, and its precise contribution to carcinogenesis remains unclear. Here, we examined the role of FZR1 in tumorigenesis and cancer therapy by analyzing tumor models and patient specimens. In an Fzr1 gene-trap mouse model of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), mice with Fzr1-deficient B-ALL survived longer than those with Fzr1-intact disease, and sensitivity of Fzr1-deficient B-ALL cells to DNA damage appeared increased. Consistently, conditional knockdown of FZR1 sensitized human B-ALL cell lines to DNA damage–induced cell death. Moreover, multivariate analyses of reverse-phase protein array of B-ALL specimens from newly diagnosed B-ALL patients determined that a low FZR1 protein expression level was an independent predictor of a longer remission duration. The clinical benefit of a low FZR1 expression level at diagnosis was no longer apparent in patients with relapsed B-ALL. Consistent with this result, secondary and tertiary mouse recipients of Fzr1-deficient B-ALL cells developed more progressive and radiation-resistant disease than those receiving Fzr1-intact B-ALL cells, indicating that prolonged inactivation of Fzr1 promotes the development of resistant clones. Our results suggest that reduction of FZR1 increases therapeutic sensitivity of B-ALL and that transient rather than tonic inhibition of FZR1 may be a therapeutic strategy.</p>\n\n<p>Approximately half of surgically-treated patients with low-grade-glioma (LGG) suffer recurrence or metastasis. Currently there is no effective drug treatment. While the selective COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib showed anti-neoplastic activity against several malignant tumors, its effects against LGG remain to be elucidated. Ours is the first report that the expression level of COX-2 in brain tissue samples from patients with LGG and in LGG cell lines is higher than in the non-neoplastic region and in normal brain cells. We found that celecoxib attenuated LGG cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. It inhibited the generation of prostaglandin E2 and induced apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest. We also show that celecoxib hampered the activation of the Akt/survivin- and the Akt/ID3 pathway in LGGs. These findings suggest that celecoxib may have a promising therapeutic potential and that the early treatment of LGG patients with the drug may be beneficial.</p>\n\n<p>Osteosarcoma is the most common type of primary bone tumor, novel therapeutic agents for which are urgently needed. To identify such agents, we screened a panel of approved drugs with a mouse model of osteosarcoma. The screen identified simvastatin, which inhibited the proliferation and migration of osteosarcoma cells in vitro. Simvastatin also induced apoptosis in osteosarcoma cells in a manner dependent on inhibition of the mevalonate biosynthetic pathway. It also disrupted the function of the small GTPase RhoA and induced activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and p38 MAPK, with AMPK functioning upstream of p38 MAPK. Inhibitors of AMPK or p38 MAPK attenuated the induction of apoptosis by simvastatin, whereas metformin enhanced this effect of simvastatin by further activation of AMPK. Although treatment with simvastatin alone did not inhibit osteosarcoma tumor growth in vivo, its combination with a fat-free diet induced a significant antitumor effect that was enhanced further by metformin administration. Our findings suggest that simvastatin induces apoptosis in osteosarcoma cells via activation of AMPK and p38 MAPK, and that, in combination with other approaches, it holds therapeutic potential for osteosarcoma.</p>\n\n<p>Spliced variant isoforms of CD44 (CD44v) are a marker of cancer stem cells in solid tumors. They stabilize the xCT subunit of the transporter system xc(-) and thereby promote synthesis of the antioxidant glutathione. Salazosulfapyridine (SASP) is an inhibitor of xCT and suppresses the proliferation of CD44v-positive cancer cells. Chemotherapy-naïve patients with advanced non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer were enrolled in a dose-escalation study (standard 3 + 3 design) of SASP in combination with cisplatin and pemetrexed. The primary end-point was the percentage of patients who experience dose-limiting toxicity. Fifteen patients were enrolled in the study. Dose-limiting toxicity was observed in one of six patients at a SASP dose of 1.5 g/day (elevation of aspartate and alanine aminotransferase levels, each of grade 3), two of five patients at 3 g/day (hypotension or pneumonitis, each of grade 3), and two of three patients at 4.5 g/day (anorexia of grade 3). The maximum tolerated dose was thus 3 g/day, and the recommended dose was 1.5 g/day. The overall response rate was 26.7% and median progression-free survival was 11.7 months, much longer than that for cisplatin-pemetrexed alone in previous studies. Exposure to SASP varied markedly among individuals according to ABCG2 and NAT2 genotypes. The serum concentration of free CD44v protein was increased after the first cycle of treatment, possibly reflecting death of cancer stem cells. Salazosulfapyridine was thus given safely in combination with cisplatin-pemetrexed, with the addition of SASP tending to prolong progression-free survival. This trial is registered in the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry as UMIN000017854.</p>\n\n<p>Background: Autoimmune gastritis (AIG) and adenocarcinoma-associated chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) are both associated with oxyntic atrophy, but AIG patients demonstrate an increased risk of carcinoid tumors rather than the elevated risk of adenocarcinoma observed with CAG. We therefore sought to compare the characteristics of the metaplastic mucosa in AIG and CAG patients. Methods: We examined markers for metaplasia (spasmolytic polypeptide expressing metaplasia (SPEM) and intestinal metaplasia) as well as proliferation (Ki67) and immune cell populations (neutrophils, macrophages, and eosinophils) in gastric sections from 16 female patients with autoimmune thyroiditis and AIG and 17 patients with CAG associated with gastric adenocarcinoma. Results: Both AIG and CAG patients demonstrated prominent SPEM and intestinal metaplasia. However, AIG patients displayed significantly lower numbers of infiltrating macrophages and significantly reduced mucosal cell proliferation as compared to CAG patients. Conclusions: These findings indicate that, while both AIG and CAG patients display prominent oxyntic atrophy and metaplasia, the AIG patients do not show proliferative metaplastic lineages that would predispose to adenocarcinoma.</p>\n\n<p>Metastasis is the main cause of treatment failure and death in cancer patients. Metastasis of tumor cells to the brain occurs frequently in individuals with breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, or melanoma. Despite recent advances in our understanding of the causes and in the treatment of primary tumors, the biological and molecular mechanisms underlying the metastasis of cancer cells to the brain have remained unclear. Metastasizing cancer cells interact with their microenvironment in the brain to establish metastases. We have now developed mouse models of brain metastasis based on intracardiac injection of human breast cancer or melanoma cell lines, and we have performed RNA sequencing analysis to identify genes in mouse brain tissue and the human cancer cells whose expression is associated specifically with metastasis. We found that the expressions of the mouse genes Tph2, Sspo, Ptprq, and Pole as well as those of the human genes CXCR4, PLLP, TNFSF4, VCAM1, SLC8A2, and SLC7A11 were upregulated in brain tissue harboring metastases. Further characterization of such genes that contribute to the establishment of brain metastases may provide a basis for the development of new therapeutic strategies and consequent improvement in the prognosis of cancer patients.</p>\n\n<p>Epithelial ovarian cancer is a highly lethal malignancy; moreover, overcoming chemoresistance is the major challenging in treating ovarian cancer patients. The cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis considers CSCs to be the main culprits in driving tumor initiation, metastasis, and resistance to conventional therapy. Although growing evidence suggest that CSCs are responsible for chemoresistance, the contribution of CSC marker EpCAM to resistance to chemotherapy remains unresolved. Here we have demonstrated that ovarian cancers containing high levels of EpCAM have a significantly much lower probability of achieving overall responsive rates after first-line chemotherapy. In addition, multivariate analysis revealed that EpCAM expression is an independent risk factor for chemoresistance, indicating that EpCAM expression is a predictive biomarker of chemotherapeutic response. Consistent with these clinical observations, in vitro assays, we found that the subpopulation of EpCAMpositive ovarian cancer cells shows a significantly higher viability compared with EpCAM-negative cells in response to cisplatin treatment by preventing chemotherapyinduced apoptosis, which is regulated by EpCAM-Bcl-2 axis. Furthermore, in an in vivo mouse model, platinum agents preferentially eliminated EpCAM-negative cells in comparison with EpCAM-positive cells, suggesting that the remaining subpopulation of EpCAM-positive cells contributes to tumor recurrence after chemotherapy. Finally, we also found that an increased expression of EpCAM is associated with poor prognosis in ovarian cancer patients. Our findings highlight the clinical significance of EpCAM in the resistance to chemotherapy and provide a rationale for EpCAM-targeted therapy to improve chemoresistance. Targeting EpCAM should be a promising approach to effectively extirpate the CSCs as the putative root of ovarian cancer.</p>\n\n<p>Overexpression of MYCN is a hallmark of neuroblastoma (NB). ALK R1275Q, an activating mutation of ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase), has been found in sporadic and familial NB patients. In this report, we demonstrated that ALK R1275Q knock-in, MYCN transgenic compound mice developed NB with complete penetrance. Transc"
