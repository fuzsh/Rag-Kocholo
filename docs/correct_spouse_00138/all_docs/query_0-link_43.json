It is used by physicians to evaluate treatment efficacy by comparing scores before and after treatment. However, the JOABPEQ does not allow evaluation of the severity of a patient's condition compared to the general population at a single time point. Given the unavailability of a standard measurement of back pain, we sought to establish reference scores and interquartile ranges using data obtained from a multicenter, cross-sectional survey taken in Japanese primary care settings. The Lumbar Spinal Stenosis Diagnosis Support Tool project was conducted from 2011 to 2012 in 1657 hospitals in Japan to investigate the establishment of reference scores using JOABPEQ. Patients agedÂ â¥Â 20 years undergoing medical examinations by either non-orthopaedic primary care physicians or general orthopedists were considered for enrollment. A total of 10,651 consecutive low back pain patients (5331 men, 5320 women, 18 subjects with missing sex data) who had undergone a medical examination were included. Reference scores and interquartile ranges for each of the five domains of the JOABPEQ according to age and sex were recorded. The median score and interquartile range are the same in the domain of Pain-related disorder in all ages and sexes. The reference scores for Gait disturbance, Social life disturbance and Psychological disorder declined with increasing age in both age- and sex-stratified groups, while there was some different trend in Lumbar spine dysfunction between men and women. Reference scores and interquartile ranges for JOABPEQ were generated based on the data from the examination data. These provide a measurement standard to assess patient perceptions of low back pain at any time point during evaluation or therapy\n\nValidation of a Japanese version of the Scoliosis Research Society-22 Patient Questionnaire among idiopathic scoliosis patients in Japan.\n\nPubMed\n\nHashimoto, Hideki; Sase, Takeshi; Arai, Yasuhisa; Maruyama, Toru; Isobe, Keijirou; Shouno, Yasuhiro\n\n2007-02-15\n\nA cross-sectional observational study to determine the response distribution, internal consistency, and construct, concurrent, and discriminative validities of The Scoliosis Research Society-22 (SRS-22) Patient Questionnaire translated into Japanese as compared with the other language versions. To validate the Japanese version of SRS22. The SRS-22 was translated into several languages but yet not into Japanese. The Japanese SRS-22 and Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 were simultaneously administered to 114 adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients. Exploratory factor analysis revealed a 4-factor structure, though several items were not loaded as theoretically expected. The originally constructed Japanese SRS-22 subscales and the English version showed similar response distribution. Internal consistency was fair but lower than that of the English version. The concurrent validity of the translated version, except for the self-image subscale, was supported using Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 subscales as a reference. The function scale differed significantly by curve angle magnitude and treatment status. The self-image score was the highest in patients under observation when curve angle was < 40 degrees, while postsurgical patients marked the highest scores when the angle > or = 40 degrees, respectively. The Japanese SRS-22 is valid and may be useful for clinical evaluation of Japanese scoliosis patients, though the self-image subscale may need further assessment.\n\nReference intervals for plasma-free amino acid in a Japanese population.\n\nPubMed\n\nYamamoto, Hiroyuki; Kondo, Kazuhiro; Tanaka, Takayuki; Muramatsu, Takahiko; Yoshida, Hiroo; Imaizumi, Akira; Nagao, Kenji; Noguchi, Yasushi; Miyano, Hiroshi\n\n2016-05-01\n\nPlasma amino acid concentrations vary with various diseases. Although reference intervals are useful in daily clinical practice, no reference intervals have been reported for plasma amino acids in a large Japanese population. Reference individuals were selected from 7685 subjects examined with the Japanese Ningen Dock in 2008. A total of 1890 individuals were selected based on exclusion criteria, and the reference samples were selected after the outlier samples for each amino acid concentration were excluded. The lower limit of the reference intervals for the plasma amino acid concentrations was set at the 2.5th percentile and the upper limit at the 97.5th percentile. By use of the nested analysis of variance, we analysed a large dataset of plasma samples and the effects of background factors (sex, age and body mass index [BMI]) on the plasma amino acid concentrations. Most amino acid concentrations were related to sex, especially those of branched-chained amino acid. The citrulline, glutamine, ornithine and lysine concentrations were related to age. The glutamate concentration was related to body mass index. The concentrations of most amino acids are more strongly related to sex than to age or body mass index. Our results indicate that the reference intervals for plasma amino acid concentrations should be stratified by sex when the background factors of age and body mass index are considered.

Among XP, XP-F presents relatively uniquely in Japanese. To clarify the characteristics of this group, we describe a case of XP-F and review Japanese cases previously reported. A 50-year-old Japanese woman was referred to us with multiple, variously sized, light- or dark-brown macules on the face and sunlight-exposed extremities. She had experienced bulla formation with approximately 10Â min of sunlight exposure during her elementary school years. Her parents had been first cousins, and her mother and sister had photosensitivity. She showed no neurological or developmental abnormalities. Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation testing revealed normal levels for minimal erythema dose with UV-A and UV-B. Sensitivity to UV-C and DNA repair ability in the patient's fibroblasts were indicated between that in normal individuals and that in an XP-A patient. Complementation assay revealed that transfection of the XPF gene led most efficient DNA repair compared with the other XP genes. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with XP-F. Twenty-three cases of Japanese patients (six males, 17 females) with XP-F have been reported, including the present case. Our review suggested a relatively high prevalence of 50% (11/22) for cutaneous malignant tumors. A significant difference was evident in the mean age at first medical consultation between patients with cutaneous malignant tumors (53.6Â years) and patients without such tumors (30.8Â years). This suggests that cutaneous malignant tumors could occur in the age range of 30-50Â years in XP-F patients.

Since few studies have investigated the genotype-phenotype association in Japanese patients with MUTYH variants, the aim of this study was to clarify the clinicopathological findings in Japanese patients with MUTYH gene variants who were detected by screening causative genes associated with hereditary colorectal polyposis. After obtaining informed consent, genetic testing was performed using target enrichment sequencing of 26 genes, including MUTYH. Of the 31 Japanese patients with suspected hereditary colorectal polyposis, eight MUTYH variants were detected in five patients. MUTYH hotspot variants known for Caucasians, namely p.G396D and p.Y179D, were not among the detected variants.Of five patients, two with biallelic MUTYH variants were diagnosed with MUTYH-associated polyposis, while two others had monoallelic MUTYH variants. One patient had the p.P18L and p.G25D variants on the same allele; however, supportive data for considering these two variants 'pathogenic' were lacking. Two patients with biallelic MUTYH variants and two others with monoallelic MUTYH variants were identified among Japanese colorectal polyposis patients. Hotspot variants of the MUTYH gene for Caucasians were not hotspots for Japanese patients.\n\nDevelopment of reference equations for spirometry in Japanese children aged 6-18 years.\n\nPubMed\n\nTakase, Masato; Sakata, Hiroshi; Shikada, Masahiro; Tatara, Katsuyoshi; Fukushima, Takayoshi; Miyakawa, Tomoo\n\n2013-01-01\n\nSpirometry is the most widely used pulmonary function test and the measured values of spirometric parameters need to be evaluated using reference values predicted for the corresponding race, sex, age, and height. However, none of the existing reference equations for Japanese children covers the entire age range of 6-18 years. The Japanese Society of Pediatric Pulmonology had organized a working group in 2006, in order to develop a new set of national standard reference equations for commonly used spirometric parameters that are applicable through the age range of 6-18 years. Quality assured spirometric data were collected through 2006-2008, from 14 institutions in Japan. We applied multiple regression analysis, using age in years (A), square of age (A(2)), height in meters (H), square of height (H(2)), and the product of age and height (AH) as explanatory variables to predict forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV(1)), peak expiratory flow (PEF), forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of the FVC (FEF(25-75%)), instantaneous forced expiratory flow when 50% (FEF(50%)) or 75% (FEF(75%)) of the FVC have been expired. Finally, 1,296 tests (674 boys, 622 girls) formed the reference data set. Distributions of the percent predicted values did not differ by ages, confirming excellent fit of the prediction equations throughout the entire age range from 6 to 18 years. Cut-off values (around 5 percentile points) for the parameters were also determined. We recommend the use of this new set of prediction equations together with suggested cut-off values, for assessment of spirometry in Japanese children and adolescents.

We aimed to clarify the relationship between coronary artery calcium scores in Japanese patients and various lifestyle factors among the Japanese population. Study subjects were patients aged â¥20 years who underwent multidetector-row computed tomography. A total of 201 patients agreed to take part in this study and answered a questionnaire regarding lifestyle, medical history, and other factors. Old age, current and former smoking, sedentary work, short sleep time, coronary artery stenosis, treatment with statins, medical history of cerebrovascular disease, medical history of angina pectoris, medical history of ischemic heart disease, and medical history of dyslipidemia were associated with higher odds ratios than the other factors examined, while the Japanese-style breakfast (e.g. boiled rice, miso soup, grilled fish) was associated with lower odds ratios. In this study, smoking, sedentary work, short sleep time, and the Japanese-style breakfast were lifestyle factors related to coronary artery calcification. The lifestyle of Japanese people may be related to coronary calcification. Copyright Â© 2014 Japanese College of Cardiology. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In total, 101 Japanese patients with extreme myopia (axial length ofÂ â¥30Â mm) OU at the Kyoto University Hospital were included in this study. Exon 2 of SCO2 was sequenced by conventional Sanger sequencing. The detected variants were assessed using in silico prediction programs: SIFT, PolyPhen-2 and MutationTaster. To determine the frequency of the mutations in normal subjects, we referred to the 1000 Genomes Project data and the Human Genetic Variation Database (HGVD) in the Human Genetic Variation Browser. The average age of the participants was 62.9Â Â±Â 12.7Â years. There were 31 males (30.7Â %) and 70 females. Axial lengths were 31.76Â Â±Â 1.17Â mm OD and 31.40Â Â±Â 1.07Â mm OS, and 176 eyes (87.6Â %) out of 201 eyes had myopic maculopathy of grade 2 or more. Among the 101 extremely myopic patients, one mutation (c.290 CÂ >Â T;p.Ala97Val) in SCO2 was detected. This mutation was not found in the 1000 Genomes Project data or HGVD data. Variant type of the mutation was nonsynonymous. Although the SIFT prediction score was 0.350, the PolyPhen-2 probability was 0.846, thus predicting its pathogenicity to be possibly damaging. MutationTaster PhyloP was 1.268, suggesting that the mutation is conserved. We identified one novel possibility of an extreme myopia-causing mutation in SCO2. No other disease-causing mutation was found in 101 extremely myopic Japanese patients, suggesting that SCO2 plays a limited role in Japanese extreme myopia. Further investigation is required for better understanding of extreme myopia.\n\nJapanese Encephalitis Virus in Meningitis Patients, Japan\n\nPubMed Central\n\nIto, Mikako; Takao, Shinichi; Shimazu, Yukie; Fukuda, Shinji; Miyazaki, Kazuo; Kurane, Ichiro; Takasaki, Tomohiko\n\n2005-01-01\n\nCerebrospinal fluid specimens from 57 patients diagnosed with meningitis were tested for Japanese encephalitis virus. Total RNA was extracted from the specimens and amplified. Two products had highest homology with Nakayama strain and 2 with Ishikawa strain. Results suggest that Japanese encephalitis virus causes some aseptic meningitis in Japan.

To validate the diagnostic criteria of the International RLS Study Group (IRLSSG) and the treatment algorithm of the Mayo Clinic in a Japanese neurology clinic setting and to clarify the features of Japanese patients with idiopathic RLS. Patients with RLS symptoms were examined by a neurologist and the assessment included neurological examination, tests for periodic limb movements (PLM) and dopaminergic response, and the clinical diagnosis was made according to IRLSSG diagnostic criteria. Patients diagnosed with idiopathic RLS were treated with dopaminergic agents and the efficacy was evaluated. The study subjects were 151 Japanese patients who presented with RLS symptoms. Idiopathic RLS was diagnosed in 113 patients, secondary RLS in 16 and RLS mimics in 22. The cause of RLS mimics was either myelopathy, radiculopathy or neuropathy in 11 patients. The mean age of patients with idiopathic RLS was 50.1 (SD 20.0) years, 63% were woman, 97% had daily RLS, 31% had family history (40% of the early-onset subgroup), 86% reported unpleasant sensations in the lower legs, 43% had PLM in the daytime suggested immobilization test, 81% suffered from insomnia, 49% had limitations of work and activities, 71% reported impaired mood, 27% had consulted physicians about their symptoms, 4% had been diagnosed with RLS, 73% improved after dopaminergic treatments, and 33% experienced complete remission. The clinical features of Japanese patients with idiopathic RLS were identical to those reported in western countries, which suggests that IRLSSG diagnostic criteria and Mayo Clinic treatment algorism are valid in Japanese neurology clinics. Both patients and physicians were not fully aware of RLS in this country. Neurological examination was important in excluding RLS mimics and making a diagnosis of RLS.\n\nPrevalence of pathogenic germline variants detected by multigene sequencing in unselected Japanese patients with ovarian cancer\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHirasawa, Akira; Imoto, Issei; Naruto, Takuya; Akahane, Tomoko; Yamagami, Wataru; Nomura, Hiroyuki; Masuda, Kiyoshi; Susumu, Nobuyuki; Tsuda, Hitoshi; Aoki, Daisuke\n\n2017-01-01\n\nPathogenic germline BRCA1, BRCA2 (BRCA1/2), and several other gene variants predispose women to primary ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal carcinoma (OC), although variant frequency and relevance information is scarce in Japanese women with OC. Using targeted panel sequencing, we screened 230 unselected Japanese women with OC from our hospital-based cohort for pathogenic germline variants in 75 or 79 OC-associated genes. Pathogenic variants of 11 genes were identified in 41 (17.8%) women: 19 (8.3%; BRCA1), 8 (3.5%; BRCA2), 6 (2.6%; mismatch repair genes), 3 (1.3%; RAD51D), 2 (0.9%; ATM), 1 (0.4%; MRE11A), 1 (FANCC), and 1 (GABRA6). Carriers of BRCA1/2 or any other tested gene pathogenic variants were more likely to be diagnosed younger, have first or second-degree relatives with OC, and have OC classified as high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC). After adjustment for these variables, all 3 features were independent predictive factors for pathogenic variants in any tested genes whereas only the latter two remained for variants in BRCA1/2. Our data indicate similar variant prevalence in Japanese patients with OC and other ethnic groups and suggest that HGSC and OC family history may facilitate genetic predisposition prediction in Japanese patients with OC and referring high-risk patients for genetic counseling and testing.

It is important to standardize the severity classification to accurately evaluate each patient×³s prognosis. In Japan, an original severity classification (the Japanese disease severity classification, JSC) is used. In the United States, the new multidimensional index and staging system (the GAP model) has been proposed. The objective of this study was to evaluate the model performance for the prediction of mortality risk of the JSC and GAP models using a large cohort of Japanese patients with IPF. This is a retrospective cohort study including 326 patients with IPF in the Hokkaido prefecture from 2003 to 2007. We obtained the survival curves of each stage of the GAP and JSC models to perform a comparison. In the GAP model, the prognostic value for mortality risk of Japanese patients was also evaluated. In the JSC, patient prognoses were roughly divided into two groups, mild cases (Stages I and II) and severe cases (Stages III and IV). In the GAP model, there was no significant difference in survival between Stages II and III, and the mortality rates in the patients classified into the GAP Stages I and II were underestimated. It is difficult to predict accurate prognosis of IPF using the JSC and the GAP models. A re-examination of the variables from the two models is required, as well as an evaluation of the prognostic value to revise the severity classification for Japanese patients with IPF.

Since fish intake varies among countries and is high in Japan, those results may not apply to Japanese patients with ADHD. However, there is currently not enough evidence to support this. We compared the plasma PUFAs levels of patients with ADHD with the standard reference levels for healthy subjects, and examined the relationship between those PUFAs levels and the subject's psychological evaluation. The subjects were 24 patients (ageâ<â20Â years) previously diagnosed with ADHD (according to the DSM-IV-TR criteria) at the psychiatric department of the Nagasaki University Hospital, between November 2010 and November 2015. The plasma concentrations of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and arachidonic acid (AA) were measured using gas chromatography. Data pertaining to global assessment of functioning (GAF), clinical global impressions, ADHD Rating Scale-IV, and the drug used for treatment (atomoxetine or methylphenidate) were obtained from the medical records. The plasma concentrations of DHA, EPA, and EPA/AA were significantly lower than the normal reference range, indicating that ADHD patients present an imbalance in PUFAs levels. This trend is similar to ADHD patients in other countries and replacement therapy in Japanese ADHD patients may be useful.\n\nPsychometric Properties of the Japanese Version of the STarT Back Tool in Patients with Low Back Pain.\n\nPubMed\n\nMatsudaira, Ko; Oka, Hiroyuki; Kikuchi, Norimasa; Haga, Yuri; Sawada, Takayuki; Tanaka, Sakae\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe STarT Back Tool uses prognostic indicators to classify patients with low back pain into three risk groups to guide early secondary prevention in primary care. The present study aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Japanese version of the tool (STarT-J). An online survey was conducted among Japanese patients with low back pain aged 20-64 years. Reliability was assessed by examining the internal consistency of the overall and psychosocial subscales using Cronbach's alpha coefficients. Spearman's correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the concurrent validity between the STarT-J total score/psychosocial subscore and standard reference questionnaires. Discriminant validity was evaluated by calculating the area under the curves (AUCs) for the total and psychosocial subscale scores against standard reference cases. Known-groups validity was assessed by examining the relationship between low back pain-related disability and STarT-J scores. The analysis included data for 2000 Japanese patients with low back pain; the mean (standard deviation [SD]) age was 47.7 (9.3) years, and 54.1% were male. The mean (SD) STarT-J score was 2.2 (2.1). The Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.75 for the overall scale and 0.66 for the psychosocial subscale. Spearman's correlation coefficients ranged from 0.30 to 0.59, demonstrating moderate to strong concurrent validity. The AUCs for the total score ranged from 0.65 to 0.83, mostly demonstrating acceptable discriminative ability. For known-groups validity, participants with more somatic symptoms had higher total scores. Those in higher STarT-J risk groups had experienced more low back pain-related absences. The overall STarT-J scale was internally consistent and had acceptable concurrent, discriminant, and known-groups validity. The STarT-J can be used with Japanese patients with low back pain.\n\nUpper gastrointestinal tumours in Japanese familial adenomatous polyposis patients\n\nPubMed Central\n\nYamaguchi, Tatsuro; Ishida, Hideyuki; Ueno, Hideki; Kobayashi, Hirotoshi; Hinoi, Takao; Inoue, Yasuhiro; Ishida, Fumio; Kanemitsu, Yukihide; Konishi, Tsuyoshi; Tomita, Naohiro; Matsubara, Nagahide; Watanabe, Toshiaki; Sugihara, Kenichi\n\n2016-01-01\n\nObjective The upper gastrointestinal characteristics in Japanese familial adenomatous polyposis patients have not yet been clarified. The aim of the present study was to elucidate these characteristics in Japanese familial adenomatous polyposis patients. Methods This study was conducted by the study group for familial adenomatous polyposis in the Japanese Society for Cancer of the Colon and Rectum. Familial adenomatous polyposis patients who underwent surgical resection from 2000 to 2012 were included in the study. Results In total, 303 familial adenomatous polyposis patients were enrolled, with 265 cases of classical familial adenomatous polyposis (â¥100 adenomas) and 38 cases of attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis (<100 adenomas). Fundic gland polyps were significantly more common in classical familial adenomatous polyposis than in attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis; however, gastric cancer was significantly less common in classical familial adenomatous polyposis than in attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis. Gastric cancer and duodenal adenoma were significantly more common in familial adenomatous polyposis patients with gastric adenoma than in those without gastric adenoma. Duodenal cancer was detected in 7 of 72 familial adenomatous polyposis patients with duodenal adenoma. The median tumour risk in 50-year-old familial adenomatous polyposis patients was 55.3, 21.8, 3.8, 39.2 and 7.7% for fundic gland polyp, gastric adenoma, gastric cancer, duodenal adenoma and duodenal cancer, respectively. Conclusions Upper gastrointestinal tumours/polyps were frequently found in familial adenomatous polyposis patients, and their incidences were correlated; however, the frequency of gastric cancer in Japanese familial adenomatous polyposis patients was similar to that in the general population.

New findings of mitochondrial haplogroups were obtained for individual classes. The five classes of people were associated with the following haplogroups: Japanese centenarians-M7b2, D4b2a, and B5b; Japanese AD patients-G2a, B4c1, and N9b1; Japanese PD patients-M7b2, B4e, and B5b; Japanese T2D patients-B5b, M8a1, G, D4, and F1; and Japanese healthy non-obese young males- D4g and D4b1b. From the points of common haplogroups among the five classes, the centenarians have the common haplogroups M7b2 and B5b with the PD patients and common haplogroup B5b with the T2D patients. In addition, the 112 Japanese semi-supercentenarians (over 105 years old) recently reported were also examined by the method proposed. The results obtained were the haplogroups D4a, B4c1a, M7b2, F1, M1, and B5b. These results are different from the previously reported haplogroup classifications. As the proposed analysis method can predict a person's mtSNP constitution and the probabilities of becoming a centenarian, AD patient, PD patient, or T2D patient, it may be useful in initial diagnosis of various diseases.\n\nBoth high and low body mass indexes are prognostic risks in Japanese patients with chronic heart failure: implications from the CHART study.\n\nPubMed\n\nNochioka, Kotaro; Shiba, Nobuyuki; Kohno, Haruka; Miura, Masanobu; Shimokawa, Hiroaki\n\n2010-11-01\n\nPrognostic impact of body mass index (BMI) in Japanese patients with chronic heart failure (HF) remains unclear. We examined the relationship between BMI and the prognosis of Japanese HF patients in the Chronic Heart Failure Analysis and Registry in the Tohoku District (CHART) study. The study sample was 972 Japanese chronic HF patients (mean age, 68.2 Â± 13.5; male 65.2%). We categorized them into 5 groups; BMI <18.5, 18.5 to 22.9, 23.0 to 24.9 (reference), 25.0 to 29.9, and â¥ 30.0. Using a Cox hazards model, the relationships between BMI and deaths or admission for worsening HF were studied in detail. Mean follow-up period was 3.4 Â± 1.7 years. Multivariate analysis showed that, as compared with reference group (BMI 23.0 to 24.9), hazard ratios (HR) for all-cause death showed a U-shaped association with 1.70 (95% confidence interval; 1.04-2.76), 1.23 (0.85-1.78), 1.26 (0.84-1.90), and 2.75 (1.51-5.00) among those with BMI<18.5, 18.5 to 22.9, 25.0 to 29.9, and â¥ 30.0, respectively. There were significant and suggestive U-shaped associations between BMI and cardiac-cause death or admission for worsening HF. Both high and low BMIs were associated with increased outcomes, suggesting that extreme obesity is not beneficial in improving the prognosis of Japanese chronic HF patients.

The specific reasons for these differences remain unknown. The objective of this study was to examine immunostainings of cathepsin B (CB) and its endogenous inhibitor stefin A (SA) in tissue microarray (TMA) and radical prostatectomy (RP) tissue sections in the hope of obtaining insights into the invasiveness of PCa in Japanese patients. TMA and RP sections were evaluated in 50 men (25 NJ and 25 J-A) for CB and SA reaction products. The CB and SA immunostainings were imaged directly from microscope slides to a computer using a high performance charge coupled device (CCD) digital camera, quantified using Metamorph software, analyzed using the two-sample t-test, and confirmed by multiple regression analysis. The CB and SA proteins were localized in the carcinomatous glands and isolated cancer cells in the TMA and RP sections. The Gleason scores and pre-surgery serum total prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels did not differ significantly in the NJ and J-A patients (p = 0.14, p = 0.16, respectively). The Chi-square analysis of clinical stage versus place of birth showed that the NJ patients had significantly more T2a and T2b clinical stages than the J-A patients who had more advanced T2c and T3a stages (p = 0.003). The CB and SA immunostainings and their ratios in Gleason score 6 tumors did not show any difference, but the CB:SA ratios in score > or = 7 tumors approached significance levels. The overall matching of specimens according to the Gleason grade/score, pre-RP serum total PSA levels, clinical stage and age prior to evaluation of immunostainings greatly minimizes subjectivity associated with the evaluation of markers in this ethnic sub-population of PCa patients. CB and SA immunostaining is similar in Japanese patients who have organ-confined and moderately\n\nA Scientist or Salesman? Identity Construction through Referent Honorifics on a Japanese Shopping Channel Program\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nCook, Haruko Minegishi\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThis paper explores how referent honorifics contribute to identity construction on a Japanese TV shopping channel program.

The association with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQB1*0602 and T-cell receptor alpha locus suggests that autoimmunity plays a role in narcolepsy. A recent study reported an increased prevalence of autoantibodies against Tribbles homolog 2 (TRIB2) in patients with narcolepsy. To replicate this finding, we examined anti-TRIB2 autoantibodies in Japanese patients with narcolepsy. Design: We examined anti-TRIB2 autoantibodies against a full-length [35S]-labeled TRIB2 antigen in Japanese patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy (n = 88), narcolepsy without cataplexy (n = 18), and idiopathic hypersomnia with long sleep time (n = 11). The results were compared to Japanese healthy controls (n = 87). Thirty-seven healthy control subjects were positive for HLA-DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602. We also examined autoantibodies against another Tribbles homolog, TRIB3, as an experimental control. Measurements and Results: Autoantibodies against TRIB2 were found in 26.1% of patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy, a significantly higher prevalence than the 2.3% in healthy controls. We found that anti-TRIB3 autoantibodies were rare in patients with narcolepsy and showed no association with anti-TRIB2 indices. No significant correlation was found between anti-TRIB2 positivity and clinical information. Conclusions: We confirmed the higher prevalence and specificity of anti-TRIB2 autoantibodies in Japanese patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy. This suggests a subgroup within narcolepsy-cataplexy might be affected by an anti-TRIB2 autoantibody-mediated autoimmune mechanism.

Recently, we found that 7% of the Japanese population with the minor allele sequence (A) of rs77060950 exhibit higher levels of serum vaspin. We therefore evaluated the serum vaspin levels in Japanese chronic hemodialysis patients. Healthy Japanese control volunteers (control; n = 95, 49.9 Â± 6.91 years) and Japanese patients undergoing hemodialysis therapy (HD; n = 138, 51.4 Â± 10.5 years) were enrolled in this study, and serum samples were subjected to the human vaspin RIA system. The measurement of the serum vaspin levels demonstrated that a fraction of control subjects (n = 5) and HD patients (n = 11) exhibited much higher levels (> 10 ng/ml; Vaspin High group), while the rest of the population exhibited lower levels (< 3 ng/ml; Vaspin Low group). By comparing the patients in the Vaspin Low group, the serum vaspin levels were found to be significantly higher in the control subjects (0.87 Â± 0.24 ng/ml) than in the HD patients (0.32 Â± 0.15 ng/ml) (p < 0.0001). In the stepwise regression analyses, the serum creatinine and triglyceride levels were found to be independently and significantly associated with the vaspin concentrations in all subjects. The creatinine levels are negatively correlated with the serum vaspin levels and were significantly reduced in the Japanese HD patients in the Vaspin Low group.\n\nAttitudes towards cross-border reproductive care among infertile Japanese patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nHibino, Yuri; Shimazono, Yosuke; Kambayashi, Yasuhiro; Hitomi, Yoshiaki; Nakamura, Hiroyuki\n\n2013-11-01\n\nThe attitudes towards cross-border reproductive care (CBRC) held by infertile Japanese patients have not been explored. The objective of the present study was to examine interest levels, preferred destinations, motivations, and sources of information related to CBRC. Our findings provide a general outline of CBRC and the future of reproduction and assisted reproductive technology (ART) in Japan. The study used a cross-sectional design. Data were collected from 2,007 infertile Japanese patients from 65 accredited ART clinics in Japan (response rate, 27.4Â %) via anonymous questionnaires. Most of the infertile Japanese patients who responded denied using CBRC. However, by group, 171 (8.5Â %) patients in non-donor in vitro fertilization, 150 (7.5Â %) in egg donation, 145 (7.2Â %) in pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, and 129 (6.4Â %) in surrogacy said that, depending on the situation, they might travel abroad in the future. Older respondents were more likely to express an intention to travel overseas for egg donation in the future. The most popular destination for CBRC was the United States. Popular reasons for interest in CBRC among those considering or planning using this approach to third-party reproduction were that egg donation or surrogacy was unavailable or that obtaining ethical approval takes too long in Japan, whereas these processes are legal and affordable overseas. However, high cost was the most common reason for hesitancy regarding CBRC. Among the participants who were considering or planning to travel abroad for this purpose, TV, medical agencies, print media, and message boards on websites were popular sources of information, whereas doctors, friends, and patient self-help groups were not. Although CBRC among infertile Japanese patients is not at present common, the demand for and use of this approach may increase in the future in the context of the increasingly aging population. Lack of regulation and unavailability of third-party reproduction is a\n\n[Quality of life in patients with Japanese cedar pollinosis: using the SF-8 health status questionnaire (Japanese version)].\n\nPubMed\n\nFujii, Tsukasa; Ogino, Satoshi; Arimoto, Hiroe; Irifune, Morihiro; Iwata, Nobuko; Ookawachi, Ichiro; Kikumori, Hiroshi; Seo, Ritsu; Takeda, Mariko; Tamaki, Akiko; Baba, Kenji; Nose, Michihiro\n\n2006-10-01\n\nThe number of patients with Japanese cedar pollinosis (JCP) is increasing, and now, has extended up to about 15% of the Japanese. It is reported that the QOL is an important outcome in the JCP treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the QOL in patients with JCP by means of the SF-8 Health Survey (Japanese Version), a new, even shorter generic health survey. 411 patients with JCP who visited 10 ENT clinics in Osaka from March 14 to March 26 (peak pollen season) were questioned, and 204 patients without any treatments in this season were engaged in this study as subjects. In this study, the QOL scores were evaluated using the SF-8. This is an 8-item version of the SF-36 that yields a comparable 8-dimension health profile and comparable estimates of summary scores for the physical and mental components of health. The QOL score depressed in the patients with JCP compared with healthy subjects (Japanese national norms). Both Mental Component Score (MCS) and Physical Component Score (PCS) scores decreased more in females than in males. In females, MCS were significantly lower than national norms. The older the patients were, the lower PCS scores were showed. The severity of nasal symptoms influenced the PCS scores. These results showed the tendency similar to the early studies using SF-36 questionnaire. The sensitivity of SF-8 in the individual is not better than that of other specific QOL questionnaires, but SF-8 can be answered in a short time compared with other questionnaires including SF-36. We suggested that SF-8 become a useful questionnaire in the future.\n\nPopulation Pharmacokinetics of Hydroxychloroquine in Japanese Patients With Cutaneous or Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.\n\nPubMed\n\nMorita, Shigemichi; Takahashi, Toshiya; Yoshida, Yasushi; Yokota, Naohisa\n\n2016-04-01\n\nHydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is an effective treatment for patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and has been used for these patients in more than 70 nations. However, in Japan, HCQ has not been approved for CLE or SLE. To establish an appropriate therapeutic regimen and to clarify the pharmacokinetics (PK) of HCQ in Japanese patients with CLE with or without SLE (CLE/SLE), a population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) analysis was performed. In a clinical study of Japanese patients with a diagnosis of CLE irrespective of the presence of SLE, blood and plasma drug concentration-time data receiving multiple oral doses of HCQ sulfate (200-400 mg daily) were analyzed using nonlinear mixed-effects model software. The blood and plasma concentrations of HCQ were analyzed using a high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method. Model evaluation and validation were performed using goodness-of-fit (GOF) plots, visual predictive check, and a bootstrap. The PopPKs of HCQ in the blood and plasma of 90 Japanese patients with CLE/SLE were well described by a 1-compartment model with first-order absorption and absorption lag time. Body weight was a significant (P < 0.001) covariate of oral clearance of HCQ. The final model was assessed using GOF plots, a bootstrap, and visual predictive check, and this model was appropriate. Simulations based on the final model suggested that the recommended daily doses of HCQ sulfate (200-400 mg) based on the ideal body weight in Japanese patients with CLE/SLE were in the similar concentration ranges. The PopPK models derived from both blood and plasma HCQ concentrations of Japanese patients with CLE/SLE were developed and validated. Based on this study, the dosage regimens of HCQ sulfate for Japanese patients with CLE/SLE should be calculated using the individual ideal body weight.\n\nAccuracy of Answers Provided by Digital/Face-to-Face Reference Services in Japanese Public Libraries and Q & A Sites\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nTsuji, Keita; To, Haruna; Hara, Atsuyuki\n\n2011-01-01\n\nWe asked the same 60 questions using DRS (digital reference services) in Japanese public libraries, face-to-face reference services and Q & A (question and answer) sites.

The purpose of the present study is to investigate this issue among Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. A multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted in 847 Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Subjects were divided into quartiles according to age: (1) 19Â â¤Â ageÂ <Â 56, (2) 56Â â¤Â ageÂ <Â 64, (3) 64Â â¤Â ageÂ <Â 71, and (4) 71Â â¤Â ageÂ <Â 89. GERD was defined as present when a subject had a Carlsson-Dent self-administered questionnaire (QUEST) score â¥4. The prevalence of GERD was 31.5Â %. Younger age was independently associated with a higher prevalence of GERD: the adjusted odds ratios (95Â % confidence intervals) for GERD in relation to ageÂ <Â 56, 56Â â¤Â ageÂ <Â 64, 64Â â¤Â ageÂ <Â 71, and â¥71 were 3.73 (2.16-6.53), 1.98 (1.21-3.27), 1.66 (1.05-2.68), and 1.00 (reference), respectively (P for trendÂ =Â 0.001). Among 201 patients with PPI or histamine H 2 -receptor antagonist (H2RA), less than 56Â years of age was independently positively associated with GERD: the adjusted OR was 5.68 (95Â % CI 1.55-22.18) (P for trendÂ =Â 0.02). Younger age may be independently positively associated with GERD among Japanese type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, regardless of the use of PPI or H2RA.\n\nCongenital abnormalities in Japanese patients with Menkes disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nGu, Yan-Hong; Kodama, Hiroko; Kato, Tadaaki\n\n2012-10-01\n\nMenkes disease (MNK) is an X-linked recessive disorder. Incidence of live-born infants with MNK is 2.8 per million live births in Japan. The aim of this study was to observe congenital malformations (CMs) in MNK patients. Subjects comprised 35 Japanese male patients with classical MNK who received copper histidine treatment. Patient clinical data were obtained anonymously from medical records or medical record summaries by pediatrician's retrospective review through a survey. We observed 21 different CMs in 14 patients. Eight of these had a single CM, while six had multiple CMs. The most frequent CM was higher arched palate with other CMs found in five patients. There was no relationship between CMs and mutations in the ATP7A gene. Using Mann-Whitney U tests, age at death was also significantly lower in MNK patients with CMs (P<0.05), compared to those without CMs, even though there was no significant difference of age onset, age at diagnosis and age at start of treatment with copper histidine between both groups of patients. Sudden death occurred in three MNK patients with CMs only: two with congenital heart disease, and one with microphallus. Copyright Â© 2012 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology.

The stretched penile length was measured and the presence of buried penis was assessed at 1-7 days of age in 547 Japanese full-term newborn infants born between 2008 and 2012 in Tokyo. The stretched penile lengths were compared at 1-12 hours and 1-7 days of age in 63 infants and by two observers in 73 infants to estimate postnatal changes and interobserver variation, respectively. The mean stretched penile length was 3.06 cm (SD, 0.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.04-3.08) and the mean ratio of penile length to body length was 6.24 Ã 100(-1) (SD, 0.55 Ã 100(-1)), both of which were significantly smaller than those in Caucasian newborn infants. Buried penis was identified in 20 of 547 infants (3.7%; 95% CI, 2.1-5.2%). The first measurements of penile length at 1-12 hours were significantly smaller than the next measurements at 1-7 days (95% CI of the difference, 0.22-0.34). The 95% CI for the limits of agreement in the penile lengths measured by the two observers was -0.58 to -0.40 for the lower limit and 0.33 to 0.51 for the upper limit. These findings indicate that the penile length should be assessed after 24 hours of age by the reference standard of the same ethnicity for identifying micropenis and that buried penis is not uncommon in Japanese full-term newborns.\n\nGenetics Home Reference: ornithine translocase deficiency\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n...

However, in the meals of hospitals, only iron of which has been taken into account. The content of these trace elements in the enteral nutrient released after 2000 was determined by considering the content of dietary reference intakes of trace elements for Japanese and considered so not fall into deficiency. However, enteral nutrient must be used considering the content of Zn, Cu and the Zn/Cu ratio, the selenium content, and the route of administration, in order to avoid falling into deficiency.\n\nPredictors for Mild and Severe Hypoglycemia in Insulin-Treated Japanese Diabetic Patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nSonoda, Nao; Morimoto, Akiko; Ugi, Satoshi; Morino, Katsutaro; Sekine, Osamu; Nemoto, Ken-Ichi; Godai, Kayo; Maegawa, Hiroshi; Miyamatsu, Naomi\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe objective of this study was to explore predictors, including social factors, lifestyle factors, and factors relevant to glycemic control and treatment, for mild and severe hypoglycemia in insulin-treated Japanese diabetic patients. This study included 123 insulin-treated diabetic patients who were referred to the diabetes clinic between January and July 2013 at Shiga University of Medical Science Hospital. After a survey examining the various factors, patients were followed for 6 months. During the follow-up period, blood glucose was self-monitored. Mild hypoglycemia was defined as blood glucose level 50-69 mg/dl, and severe hypoglycemia was defined as blood glucose level â¤49 mg/dl. Multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate the adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of each factor for mild and severe hypoglycemia. During the 6-month follow-up period, 41 (33.3%) patients experienced mild hypoglycemia, and 20 (16.3%) experienced severe hypoglycemia. In multivariable-adjusted analyses, assistance from family members at the time of the insulin injection [presence/absence, OR (95% CI): 0.39 (0.16-0.97)] and drinking [current drinker/non- and ex-drinker, OR (95% CI): 4.89 (1.68-14.25)] affected mild hypoglycemia. Assistance from family members at the time of insulin injection [presence/absence, OR (95% CI): 0.19 (0.05-0.75)] and intensive insulin therapy [yes/no, OR (95% CI): 3.61 (1.06-12.26)] affected severe hypoglycemia. In conclusion, our findings suggest that not only a factor relevant to glycemic control and treatment (intensive insulin therapy) but also a social factor (assistance from family members) and a lifestyle factor (current drinking) were predictors for mild or severe hypoglycemia in Japanese insulin-treated diabetic patients.\n\nBasic Restriction and Reference Level in Anatomically-based Japanese Models for Low-Frequency Electric and Magnetic Field Exposures\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTakano, Yukinori; Hirata, Akimasa; Fujiwara, Osamu\n\nHuman exposed to electric and/or magnetic fields at low frequencies may cause direct effect such as nerve stimulation and excitation. Therefore, basic restriction is regulated in terms of induced current density in the ICNIRP guidelines and in-situ electric field in the IEEE standard. External electric or magnetic field which does not produce induced quantities exceeding the basic restriction is used as a reference level. The relationship between the basic restriction and reference level for low-frequency electric and magnetic fields has been investigated using European anatomic models, while limited for Japanese model, especially for electric field exposures. In addition, that relationship has not well been discussed. In the present study, we calculated the induced quantities in anatomic Japanese male and female models exposed to electric and magnetic fields at reference level. A quasi static finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method was applied to analyze this problem. As a result, spatially averaged induced current density was found to be more sensitive to averaging algorithms than that of in-situ electric field. For electric and magnetic field exposure at the ICNIRP reference level, the maximum values of the induced current density for different averaging algorithm were smaller than the basic restriction for most cases. For exposures at the reference level in the IEEE standard, the maximum electric fields in the brain were larger than the basic restriction in the brain while smaller for the spinal cord and heart.\n\nA potential protective effect in multilingual patients with semantic dementia: two case reports of patients speaking Taiwanese and Japanese.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Yi-Chien; Yip, Ping-Keung; Fan, Yu-Ming; Meguro, Kenichi\n\n2012-03-01\n\nSeveral reports have suggested that multilingualism has a protective effect against semantic dementia. Here, we provide further evidence for this effect. The patient was a 75-year-old right-handed Taiwanese woman who had retired after working as a tailor. She was able to speak Taiwanese, Japanese and Mandarin Chinese fluently until 5 years ago. She gradually developed symptoms of profound anomia and difficulty with word-finding. Her mother tongue was Taiwanese and she had learned Japanese as her first symbolized language. She had used Mandarin Chinese for most of her life, but depended on Japanese to read and write (such as reading a newspaper and keeping accounts). However, she could now speak only very simple Taiwanese and Japanese, and could recognize only simple Japanese characters. SECOND: The patient was a 62-year-old right-handed man who had worked as an ironworker. He could speak Taiwanese and Mandarin Chinese fluently until 5 years ago. His mother tongue was Taiwanese. After 5 years of language deterioration, he was unable to communicate with his family members or recognize any characters, including numbers. SPECT RESULTS: Brain perfusion ECD SPECT (Tc-99m-ethyl cysteinate dimer single-photon emission computed tomography) showed less perfusion in the multilingual patient (Case #1) than in the bilingual patient (Case #2). Neuropsychological tests also demonstrated a slower rate of degeneration in the multilingual patient. We speculate that reading and writing in Japanese had a greater impact on the semantic system in Case #1. Thus, this patient showed relatively less degeneration or functional inactivity, as shown by perfusion in the frontal lobe, and this might be due to the persistent activation involved in multilingualism.\n\nModel-based dose selection for phase III rivaroxaban study in Japanese patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.\n\nPubMed\n\nTanigawa, Takahiko; Kaneko, Masato; Hashizume, Kensei; Kajikawa, Mariko; Ueda, Hitoshi; Tajiri, Masahiro; Paolini, John F; Mueck, Wolfgang\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe global ROCKET AF phase III trial evaluated rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily (o.d.) for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF). Based on rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics in Japanese subjects and lower anticoagulation preferences in Japan, particularly in elderly patients, the optimal dose regimen for Japanese AF patients was considered. The aim of this analysis was dose selection for Japanese patients from a pharmacokinetic aspect by comparison of simulated exposure in Japanese patients with those in Caucasian patients. As a result of population pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics analyses, a one-compartment pharmacokinetic model with first-order absorption and direct link pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models optimally described the plasma concentration and pharmacodynamic models (Factor Xa activity, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and HepTest), which were also consistent with previous works. Steady-state simulations indicated 15 mg rivaroxaban o.d. doses in Japanese patients with AF would yield exposures comparable to the 20 mg o.d. dose in Caucasian patients with AF. In conclusion, in the context of the lower anticoagulation targets in Japanese practice, the population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling supports 15 mg o.d. as the principal rivaroxaban dose in J-ROCKET AF.\n\nObesity and the prevalence of nocturia in Japanese elderly patients with typeÂ 2 diabetes mellitus: The Dogo study.\n\nPubMed\n\nFurukawa, Shinya; Sakai, Takenori; Niiya, Tetsuji; Miyaoka, Hiroaki; Miyake, Teruki; Yamamoto, Shin; Maruyama, Koutatsu; Tanaka, Keiko; Ueda, Teruhisa; Senba, Hidenori; Torisu, Masamoto; Minami, Hisaka; Tanigawa, Takeshi; Matsuura, Bunzo; Hiasa, Yoichi; Miyake, Yoshihiro\n\n2017-12-01\n\nNocturia is common among patients with typeÂ 2 diabetes mellitus, but limited evidence regarding the association between body mass index (BMI) and nocturia exists among such patients. The aim of the present study, therefore, was to evaluate the association between BMI and nocturia among Japanese patients with typeÂ 2 diabetes mellitus. Study participants were 809 Japanese patients with typeÂ 2 diabetes mellitus. Study participants were considered to have nocturia if they answered \"two or more\" to the question: \"How many times do you typically wake up to urinate from sleeping at night until waking in the morning?\" We used the following two outcomes: (i) moderate nocturia was defined as â¥2 voids per night; and (ii) severe nocturia was defined as â¥3 voids per night. Participants were categorized into four groups according to their BMI: (i) BMI <18.5; (ii) 18.5Â â¤Â BMIÂ <Â 25; (iii) 25Â â¤Â BMIÂ <Â 30; and (iv) BMI â¥30. Multiple logistical regression analysis for nocturia in relation to BMI was used, with the category of 18.5Â â¤Â BMIÂ <Â 25 as the reference. Obesity (BMI â¥30) was independently positively associated with severe nocturia among elderly patients (age â¥65Â years) with typeÂ 2 diabetes mellitus, but not among young and middle-aged patients: the adjusted OR was 2.96 (95% CI 1.10-7.83). BMI was not associated with moderate nocturia in all patients. In Japanese elderly patients with typeÂ 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity was independently positively associated with severe nocturia.

Using a longitudinal repeated-measure design, 29 patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillators completed the Profile of Mood States-Short Form Japanese Version questionnaire before discharge and 1, 4, 7, and 13 months after implantation. One month after discharge, the mood states of the patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillators improved. From 7 to 13 months after discharge, moods deteriorated; 13 months after discharge, moods were equivalent to those at the time of discharge. No relationship with defibrillation experience was detected in this study, but employment, age, sex, and lack of experience of syncopal attack were factors related to poor mood states for patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillators. Therefore, Japanese patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillators with any factor deteriorating their mood state should be monitored so that their mood state does not deteriorate again between six months and one year after implantation.\n\nBasic English Writers' Japanese-English Wordbook.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nDaniels, F.

The aim of this study was to examine the performance of a sizable number of patients with schizophrenia on the Japanese version of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III (WAIS-III) compared with healthy controls. Performance on the WAIS-III was evaluated in 157 Japanese patients with schizophrenia and in 264 healthy control subjects. All IQ scores and four indices from the WAIS-III were impaired for patients with schizophrenia compared with healthy controls. Processing Speed was markedly disturbed, approximately 2 SD below that of the healthy control group. Among the 13 subtests, Comprehension (zâ=â-1.70, dâ=â1.55), Digit Symbol Coding (zâ=â-1.84, dâ=â1.88), and Symbol Search (zâ=â-1.85, dâ=â1.77) were profoundly impaired relative to the healthy controls. These results indicate that the pattern and degree of impairment, as evaluated by the WAIS-III, in Japanese patients are similar to those previously reported in English-speaking patients and that the deficits of some neuropsychological domains relevant to functional outcomes are universally characteristic of schizophrenia.

The aim of this study was to confirm whether HLA-alleles confer susceptibility to UC and to determine whether HLA-allel1es are associated with the clinical phenotypes in Japanese patients with UC. In this study, HLA typing was performed by PCR-sequence-specific oligonucleotides (PCR-SSO) to confirm the correlation between UC and HLA alleles (for HLA-A, B, DRB1) in 45 Japanese UC patients. In addition, whether the HLA alleles are related to patient and clinical background characteristics was examined. Overall, 62.2%, and 66.7% of the 45 UC patients had HLA-B*52 and HLA-DRB1*15, respectively. These allele frequencies were significantly higher than in previously reported Japanese control persons ( P < 0.0001). The frequencies of extraintestinal manifestations [odds ratio (OR) = 0.12, P = 0.039] and a history of colectomy (OR = 0.18, P = 0.046) were lower in HLA-B*52-positive UC patients than in HLA-B*52 negative UC patients. The white blood cell (WBC) count was significantly higher in HLA-DRB1*15-positive patients (9430 Â± 4592/Î¼L) than in HLA-DRB1*15-negative patients (6729 Â± 2160/Î¼L). Thus, HLA-B*52 and DRB1*15 appear to be associated with disease features and severity in Japanese UC patients. These results indicate that HLA-B*52 and DRB1*15 are not only associated with overall UC susceptibility, but also with the clinical phenotypes in Japanese patients.\n\nJapanese Media in English.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nTanaka, Sachiko Oda\n\n1995-01-01\n\nDescribes the use of English in the media in Japan, focusing on the role and history of English-language newspapers, radio, and television programs, as well as the proliferation of English-language films shown in Japanese cinemas.

Comparisons were made between caregivers' QOL in regard to their dependents' genotype and age group. The participants with PWS consisted of 22 children (aged from 6 to 12 years) and 23 adolescents (aged from 13 to 19 years), including 6 children and 7 adolescents with maternal uniparental disomy (mUPD) and 16 children and 16 adolescents with deletion (DEL). The QOL of the primary family caregiver for each patient was assessed using the Japanese version of the WHOQOL-BREF. To examine the effect that age (children vs. adolescents) and genotype (DEL vs. mUPD) have on the QOL of caregivers, a two-way ANOVA was conducted, followed by the Bonferroni procedure to test the simple main effects. The two age groups and the two genotypes of PWS were used as independent variables and the total QOL of caregivers as a dependent variable. The two-way ANOVA (F(1, 41) = 6.98, P < 0.05), followed by the Bonferroni procedure, showed the following: the total QOL of caregivers of DEL adolescents showed little difference from that with DEL children, but the QOL of caregivers for mUPD adolescents was shown to be lower than that with mUPD children along with that of caregivers with DEL adolescents. There is hence a growing tendency for the deterioration in the QOL of caregivers to manifest itself later in the patients' adolescence, found mainly with mUPD patients. Â© 2014 The Authors.

METHODS: A total of 484 Mongolian patients with gastric cancer were enrolled to study gastric cancer characteristics in Mongolians. In addition, a total of 208 Mongolian and 3205 Japanese consecutive outpatients who underwent endoscopy, had abdominal complaints, no history of gastric operation or Helicobacter pylori eradication treatment, and no use of gastric secretion inhibitors such as histamine H2-receptor antagonists or proton pump inhibitors were enrolled. This study was conducted with the approval of the ethics committees of all hospitals. The triple-site biopsy method was used for the histologic diagnosis of gastritis and H. pylori infection in all Mongolian and Japanese cases. The infection rate of H. pylori and the status of gastric mucosa in H. pylori-infected patients were compared between Mongolian and Japanese subjects. Age (Â± 5 years), sex, and endoscopic diagnosis were matched between the two countries. RESULTS: Approximately 70% of Mongolian patients with gastric cancer were 50-79 years of age, and approximately half of the cancers were located in the upper part of the stomach. Histologically, 65.7% of early cancers exhibited differentiated adenocarcinoma, whereas 73.9% of advanced cancers displayed undifferentiated adenocarcinoma. The infection rate of H. pylori was higher in Mongolian than Japanese patients (75.9% vs 48.3%, P < 0.0001). When stratified by age, the prevalence was highest among young patients, and tended to decrease in patients aged 50 years or older. The anti-East-Asian CagA-specific antibody was negative in 99.4% of H. pylori-positive Mongolian patients.

In this study, we conducted a comparative analysis between the Oxford Classification and Japanese Histologic Classification (JHC) to predict renal outcome in Japanese patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN). A retrospective cohort study including 86 adult IgAN patients was conducted. The Oxford Classification and the JHC were evaluated by 7 independent specialists. The JHC, MEST score in the Oxford Classification, and crescents were analyzed in association with renal outcome, defined as a 50% increase in serum creatinine. In multivariate analysis without the JHC, only the T score was significantly associated with renal outcome. While, a significant association was revealed only in the JHC on multivariate analysis with JHC. The JHC and T score in the Oxford Classification were associated with renal outcome among Japanese patients with IgAN. Superiority of the JHC as a predictive index should be validated with larger study population and cohort studies in different ethnicities.\n\nTrust in Oneâs Physician: The Role of Ethnic Match, Autonomy, Acculturation, and Religiosity Among Japanese and Japanese Americans\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTarn, Derjung M.; Meredith, Lisa S.; Kagawa-Singer, Marjorie; Matsumura, Shinji; Bito, Seiji; Oye, Robert K.; Liu, Honghu; Kahn, Katherine L.; Fukuhara, Shunichi; Wenger, Neil S.\n\n2005-01-01\n\nPURPOSE Trust is a cornerstone of the physician-patient relationship. We investigated the relation of patient characteristics, religiosity, acculturation, physician ethnicity, and insurance-mandated physician change to levels of trust in Japanese American and Japanese patients. METHODS A self-administered, cross-sectional questionnaire in English and Japanese (completed in the language of their choice) was given to community-based samples of 539 English-speaking Japanese Americans, 340 Japanese-speaking Japanese Americans, and 304 Japanese living in Japan. RESULTS Eighty-seven percent of English-speaking Japanese Americans, 93% of Japanese-speaking Japanese Americans, and 58% of Japanese living in Japan responded to trust items and reported mean trust scores of 83, 80, and 68, respectively, on a scale ranging from 0 to 100. In multivariate analyses, English-speaking and Japanese-speaking Japanese American respondents reported more trust than Japanese respondents living in Japan (P values <.001). Greater religiosity (P <.001), less desire for autonomy (P <.001), and physician-patient relationships of longer duration (P <.001) were related to increased trust. Among Japanese Americans, more acculturated respondents reported more trust (P <.001), and Japanese physicians were trusted more than physicians of another ethnicity. Among respondents prompted to change physicians because of insurance coverage, the 48% who did not want to switch reported less trust in their current physician than in their former physician (mean score of 82 vs 89, P <.001). CONCLUSIONS Religiosity, autonomy preference, and acculturation were strongly related to trust in oneâs physician among the Japanese American and Japanese samples studied and may provide avenues to enhance the physician-patient relationship. The strong relationship of trust with patient-physician ethnic match and the loss of trust when patients, in retrospect, report leaving a preferred physician suggest unintended\n\nOrdinal Expressions in Japanese.

We assessed the clinical characteristics of Japanese patients with an extremely high triglyceride level. We investigated the presence of coronary artery disease, history of pancreatitis, the presence of fatty liver, and the potential causes of elevated triglyceride in Japanese subjects with an extremely high level of fasting triglyceride (â¥ 1000 mg/dL) among 70,368 subjects whose serum triglyceride was measured for any reason at Kanazawa University Hospital from April 2004 to March 2014. We identified 215 (0.31%) subjects (mean age, 46 years; male, 170, mean body mass index, 25 kg/m(2)) with severe hypertriglyceridemia. Among them, 4 (1.9%) subjects were classified as type I, 97 (45.1%) subjects were type IV, and 114 (53.0%) subjects were type V hyperlipidemia, according to Fredrickson's classification. Among 215 subjects, 116 subjects (54.0%) drank alcohol, 58 (27.0%) showed heavy intake (â¥ 60 g/d), and 64 (29.8%) subjects had diabetes. In total, 59 (27.4%) subjects had transient severe hypertriglyceridemia caused by corticosteroids (N = 19), antidepressant (N = 18), l-asparaginase and steroids for acute lymphoid leukemia (N = 15), hormone replacement therapy for breast cancer (N = 9), Î²-blocker (N = 5), hypothyroidism (N = 4), pregnancy (N = 4), and panhypopituitarism (N = 2). As many as 119 (55.3%) subjects exhibited fatty liver. Moreover, 12 (5.6%) and 17 (7.9%) subjects had a history of pancreatitis and coronary artery disease, respectively. A variety of situations can cause severe hypertriglyceridemia. We suggest that potential secondary causes should be carefully assessed for such patients. Copyright Â© 2015 National Lipid Association.

MostGraph is a device that incorporates the FOT and enables the immediate, three-dimensional visualization of resistance and reactance parameters. The aim of this study was to establish MostGraph reference values for middle-aged and elderly Japanese individuals. From 2004 to 2006, 3253 subjects living in Takahata, Yamagata underwent spirometry. Of these, 872 again underwent spirometry in 2011, and 784 (368 men, ages 46-89 years; 416 women, ages 47-90 years) underwent FOT examinations using MostGraph-01. In this study population, 19.0% of the men and 91.5% of the women were life-long never smokers. Abnormal spirometric findings were observed in 30.2% of the men and 14.6% of the women. Although the respiratory system resistance and reactance parameters obtained using MostGraph were not distributed normally, normal distribution was achieved via natural logarithm (R5, R20, Fres, and ALX), square root (R5-R20), or exponential (X5) transformation. Furthermore, the transformed values were converted back to the actual values after determining the values representing one and two standard deviations from the mean. Respiratory system resistance and reactance reference values were determined using MostGraph in middle-aged and elderly Japanese individuals who participated in annual health checkups.

Previous association studies of HLA-B showed several associated alleles and haplotypes of HLA-B in patients with ulcerative colitis, and among the associated alleles HLA-B*52 is well known to be strongly associated with ulcerative colitis in Japanese patients. However, there are no convincing reports about HLA-B including the B*52 allele in patients with Crohn's disease. The purpose of this study was to determine if HLA-B, especially the B*52 allele, confers susceptibility to Crohn's disease or determines the disease phenotype of Crohn's disease. A total of 195 patients with Crohn's disease (49 ileitis, 106 ileocolitis, 34 colitis, 6 uncertain) and 185 healthy controls were studied in this case-controlled study. All patients and healthy controls were Japanese. Genotyping of the HLA-B gene was performed by a polymerase chain reaction, sequence-specific primer that can classify the gene into 23 allele groups. Allele frequencies were compared between patients with Crohn's disease and healthy controls with chi-squared test using a 2 x 2 contingency table. P value was corrected by the number of allele groups (n = 23) observed in the Japanese population or the number of clinical subgroups. Corrected P values of <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Before the correction for multiple testing, B*4001 and B*44 were associated with patients with Crohn's disease, positively and negatively, respectively. However, after the correction there were no significant differences in any HLA-B alleles between patients with Crohn's disease and healthy controls. In the subgroup analysis according to clinical phenotypes (disease location, anal lesion, age at diagnosis, need for surgery), none of the HLA-B alleles except B*52 showed any disease phenotype-genotype associations. The allele frequency of B*52 in the colitis type (16.2 percent; corrected P = 0.011) was significantly higher than\n\nSocial support and psychological and physical states among Japanese patients with breast cancer and their spouses prior to surgery.\n\nPubMed\n\nMakabe, Reiko; Nomizu, Tadashi\n\n2006-05-03\n\nTo assess social support and psychological and physical states among Japanese patients with breast cancer and their spouses prior to surgery. Descriptive, comparative, and correlational. A general hospital in northern Japan. 38 Japanese patients with breast cancer and their spouses (N = 76). The Japanese versions of three questionnaires were used to collect data before surgery: the Interpersonal Relationship Inventory, the General Health Questionnaire, and the Physical States Interview Form. Social support (support, conflict, and reciprocity), social network, and psychological and physical states. Significant differences were found in support and reciprocity between patients and their spouses. However, no significant differences were found in social network, conflict, or psychological states between patients and their spouses. Moreover, some significant correlations were found in the variables of conflict, social network, and psychological and physical states. Japanese patients with breast cancer perceived more support and reciprocity than their spouses before their breast surgery. Conflict was significantly correlated with psychological states among Japanese women with breast cancer and their spouses. Healthcare professionals need to consider social support as an important factor to help Japanese patients with breast cancer and their spouses cope with the disease.\n\nFLG mutation p.Lys4021X in the C-terminal imperfect filaggrin repeat in Japanese patients with atopic eczema.\n\nPubMed\n\nNemoto-Hasebe, I; Akiyama, M; Nomura, T; Sandilands, A; McLean, W H I; Shimizu, H\n\n2009-12-01\n\nMutations in the gene encoding filaggrin (FLG) have been shown to predispose to atopic eczema (AE). Further to establish population genetics of FLG mutations in the Japanese population and to elucidate effects of FLG mutations to filaggrin biosynthesis in skin of patients with AE. We searched for FLG mutations in 19 newly recruited Japanese patients with AE. We then screened 137 Japanese patients with AE and 134 Japanese control individuals for a novel mutation identified in the present study. In addition, we evaluated FLG mRNA expression by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and profilaggrin/filaggrin protein expression by immunohistochemical staining in the epidermis of the patients carrying the novel mutation. We identified a novel FLG nonsense mutation c.12069A>T (p.Lys4021X) in one patient with AE. Upon further screening, p.Lys4021X was identified in four patients with AE (2.9% of all the patients with AE). In total, there are at least eight FLG variants in the Japanese population. Here we show that about 27% of patients in our Japanese AE case series carry one or more of these eight FLG mutations and these variants are also carried by 3.7% of Japanese general control individuals. There is a significant statistical association between the eight FLG mutations and AE (chi(2) P = 6.50 x 10(-8)). Interestingly, the present nonsense mutation is in the C-terminal incomplete filaggrin repeat and is the mutation nearest the C-terminal among previously reported FLG mutations. Immunohistochemical staining for filaggrin revealed that this nonsense mutation leads to remarkable reduction of filaggrin protein expression in the patients' epidermis. We clearly demonstrated that FLG mutations are significantly associated with AE in the Japanese population. The present results further support the hypothesis that the C-terminal region is essential for proper processing of profilaggrin to filaggrin.\n\nPhase I study of single-agent ribociclib in Japanese patients with advanced solid tumors.\n\nPubMed\n\nDoi, Toshihiko; Hewes, Becker; Kakizume, Tomoyuki; Tajima, Takeshi; Ishikawa, Norifumi; Yamada, Yasuhide\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe cyclin D-CDK4/6-INK4-Rb pathway is frequently dysregulated in cancers. Ribociclib, an orally available, selective CDK4/6 inhibitor, showed preliminary clinical activity in a phase I study in the USA and Europe for patients with solid tumors and lymphomas. The present study aimed to determine the single-agent maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose for expansion (RDE) in Japanese patients with advanced solid tumors. Ribociclib safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic profile, and preliminary antitumor activity were also assessed. Japanese patients with solid tumors that had progressed on prior therapies received escalating doses of single-agent ribociclib on a 3-weeks-on/1-week-off schedule. Treatment continued until the development of toxicity or disease progression. A dose escalation was planned for patients with esophageal cancer. In the dose-escalation phase, 4 patients received 400 mg ribociclib and 13 patients received 600 mg ribociclib. Four patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities, 3 of whom were in the 600 mg group. The RDE was declared to be 600 mg, and the MTD was not determined. The most frequent adverse events were hematologic and gastrointestinal. Four patients achieved stable disease at the 600 mg dose; no patients achieved complete or partial response. All patients discontinued the study, the majority due to disease progression. No patients discontinued due to adverse events. Dose escalation was not pursued due to lack of observed efficacy in esophageal cancer. At the RDE of 600 mg/d on a 3-weeks-on/1-week-off schedule, ribociclib showed acceptable safety and tolerability profiles in Japanese patients with advanced solid tumors. Â© 2017 The Authors.

A total of 159 Japanese subjects with epilepsy underwent a psychiatric structured interview with the Japanese version of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.-J) followed by completion of the Japanese version of NDDI-E (NDDI-E-J). Twelve participants met the M.I.N.I.-J criteria of current major depressive episode. Participants had no difficulties completing the NDDI-E-J. Its Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.83 and a cut-off score greater than 16 provided a sensitivity of 0.92, a specificity of 0.89, and a negative predictive value of 0.99. The NDDI-E-J appears to be useful for primary care clinicians to screen for major depressive episodes in epilepsy patients. Routine use of this brief and self-administered instrument in busy clinical settings will likely improve management of depression in Japanese individuals with epilepsy.

Fifty-eight (87%) patients experienced AEs, and 36 experienced severe AEs (21 hepatic and 11 cytopenic severe AEs). Thirty-one (46%) patients discontinued treatment because of AEs. Abnormal hepatic laboratory test results at the treatment initiation were more frequent in patients with hepatic severe AEs and were associated with treatment discontinuation. The leukocyte and neutrophil counts at the treatment initiation were lower in the patients who discontinued treatment because of cytopenic AEs than in those who continued treatment. Only two patients experienced flare-ups during treatment. Conclusion The AE-associated AZA discontinuation rate in Japanese AAV patients was relatively high. AZA use warrants caution in patients with abnormal hepatic laboratory test results or low leukocyte or neutrophil counts.

A total of 1,488 Japanese men and women aged 18-85 years participated in this study. Appendicular muscle mass (AMM) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Reference values for classes 1 and 2 sarcopenia (skeletal muscle index: AMM/height2, kg m-2) in each sex were defined as values one and two standard deviations below the sex-specific means of reference values obtained in this study from young adults aged 18-40 years. The reference values for class 1 and class 2 sarcopenia were 7.77 and 6.87 kg m-2 in men and 6.12 and 5.46 kg m-2 in women. In subjects both with class 1 and class 2 sarcopenia, body mass index and % body fat were significantly lower than in normal subjects. Despite whole-blood glycohaemoglobin A1c in men with class 1 sarcopenia was significantly higher than in normal subjects, and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity in women both with class 1 and class 2 sarcopenia were significantly higher than in normal subjects, using one-way ANCOVA with adjustment for the covariate of waist circumference. Although sarcopenia is associated with thin body mass, it is associated with more glycation of serum proteins in men and with greater arterial stiffness in women, independent of waist circumference.\n\nAirway inflammation in Japanese COPD patients compared with smoking and nonsmoking controls\n\nPubMed Central\n\nIshikawa, Nobuhisa; Hattori, Noboru; Kohno, Nobuoki; Kobayashi, Akihiro; Hayamizu, Tomoyuki; Johnson, Malcolm\n\n2015-01-01\n\nPurpose To assess the importance of inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) by measuring airway and systemic inflammatory biomarkers in Japanese patients with the disease and relevant control groups. Patients and methods This was the first study of its type in Japanese COPD patients. It was a non-treatment study in which 100 participants were enrolled into one of three groups: nonsmoking controls, current or ex-smoking controls, and COPD patients. All participants underwent standard lung function assessments and provided sputum and blood samples from which the numbers of inflammatory cells and concentrations of biomarkers were measured, using standard procedures. Results The overall trends observed in levels of inflammatory cells and biomarkers in sputum and blood in COPD were consistent with previous reports in Western studies. Increasing levels of neutrophils, interleukin 8 (IL-8), surfactant protein D (SP-D), and Krebs von den Lungen 6 (KL-6) in sputum and clara cell 16 (CC-16), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and KL-6 in serum and plasma fibrinogen were seen in the Japanese COPD patients compared with the non-COPD control participants. In sputum, significant correlations were seen between total cell count and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9; P<0.001), neutrophils and MMP-9 (P<0.001), macrophages and KL-6 (P<0.01), total cell count and IL-8 (P<0.05), neutrophils and IL-8 (P<0.05), and macrophages and MMP-9 (P<0.05). Significant correlations were also observed between some inflammatory cells in sputum and biomarkers in serum, with the most significant between serum CC-16 and both total cell count (P<0.005) and neutrophils (P<0.005) in sputum. Conclusion These results provide evidence for the first time that COPD in Japanese patients is a multicomponent disease, involving both airway and systemic inflammation, in addition to airway obstruction. Therefore, intervention with anti-inflammatory therapy may provide additional\n\nNovel USH2A mutations in Japanese Usher syndrome type 2 patients: marked differences in the mutation spectrum between the Japanese and other populations.\n\nPubMed\n\nNakanishi, Hiroshi; Ohtsubo, Masafumi; Iwasaki, Satoshi; Hotta, Yoshihiro; Usami, Shin-Ichi; Mizuta, Kunihiro; Mineta, Hiroyuki; Minoshima, Shinsei\n\n2011-07-01\n\nUsher syndrome (USH) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by retinitis pigmentosa and hearing loss. USH type 2 (USH2) is the most common type of USH and is frequently caused by mutations in USH2A. In a recent mutation screening of USH2A in Japanese USH2 patients, we identified 11 novel mutations in 10 patients and found the possible frequent mutation c.8559-2A>G in 4 of 10 patients. To obtain a more precise mutation spectrum, we analyzed further nine Japanese patients in this study. We identified nine mutations, of which eight were novel. This result indicates that the mutation spectrum for USH2A among Japanese patients largely differs from Caucasian, Jewish and Palestinian patients. Meanwhile, we did not find the c.8559-2A>G in this study. Haplotype analysis of the c.8559-2G (mutated) alleles using 23 single nucleotide polymorphisms surrounding the mutation revealed an identical haplotype pattern of at least 635âkb in length, strongly suggesting that the mutation originated from a common ancestor. The fact that all patients carrying c.8559-2A>G came from western Japan suggests that the mutation is mainly distributed in that area; indeed, most of the patients involved in this study came from eas"
