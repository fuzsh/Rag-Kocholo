On the QUEST spherical tokamak, doubling the toroidal field results in the emergence of the fundamental resonance layer for 28 GHz electron cyclotron waves. The second-harmonic resonance layer shifts toward the plasma central area. To increase the coil current from 50 to 100 kA, a current source is designed with 125 modules in parallel. The module power supply comprises a bank of lithium-ion capacitors and a DC–DC buck converter. In the bench test of a single module, the current was found to increase linearly and maintained the flat-top as programmed.. 2. Makoto HASEGAWA, Aki HIGASHIJIMA, Ichiro NIIYA, Kazuaki HANADA, Hiroshi IDEI, Takeshi IDO, Ryuya IKEZOE, Takumi ONCHI, Kengo KURODA and Daisuke SAKURAI, QUEST Database for Tokamak Big Data, Plasma and Fusion Research, 10.1585/pfr.18.1305048, 18, 1305048-1-1305048-4, 2023.05, A database has been developed to provide a highly efficient data analysis environment by registering various types of data obtained in the QUEST (Q-shu University Experiment with Steady-State Spherical Tokamak) experiments and providing the data to researchers through standard SQL query output. In conventional experiments, measurements are usually obtained using several instruments, and the results are often stored separately in proprietary formats. An analysis to collect distributed files and convert them into appropriate formats individually was necessary, which led to a decrease in analysis efficiency. In order to build a system to centrally store and provide data, we constructed new servers, each for registering data in a database and for extracting data from the database and visualizing the data. As a result, various real-time monitoring data can be registered in the database, and data retrieval for analysis can be performed easily with a unified user interface. The construction of this database has made it possible to easily retrieve real-time monitoring data and a wide variety of table data, enabling analysis from a new perspective, and improving analysis efficiency.. 3. Kuroda, K., Raman, R., Hasegawa, M.., Onchi, T., Hanada, K., Ono, M., Nelson, B.A., Rogers, J., Ikezoe, R., Idei, H., Ido, T., Mitarai, O., Nagata, M., Kawasaki, S., Nagata, T., Higashijima, A., Shimabukuro, S., Niiya, I., Sekiya, I., Kojima, S., Nakamura, K., Takase, Y., Murakami, S., Improvements to the High-Field-Side Transient CHI System on QUEST, JOURNAL OF FUSION ENERGY, 10.1007/s10894-022-00338-4, 41, 2, 2022.12, Transient coaxial helicity injection (CHI) is a promising candidate for solenoid-free plasma current start-up in a low-aspect-ratio tokamak in support of developing fully non-inductive scenarios. The aim of the transient CHI research on QUEST is to develop a reactor-relevant CHI design. On QUEST, a CHI discharge is initiated by driving current along magnetic field lines that connect an electrically insulated electrode plate (which is referred to as a bias electrode) to a vessel component at the bottom region of the spherical tokamak. In the first application of CHI on QUEST, the electrically insulated electrode plate was biased with respect to the outer vessel in a configuration referred to as low-field-side (LFS) injection. To maintain a narrow injector flux footprint width throughout the discharge, QUEST is now developing a high-field-side (HFS) injection configuration, in which the electrically insulated electrode plate is biased with respect to the inner vessel components. Through the implementation of a CHI-dedicated gas injection system, studies in the HFS injection configuration have now demonstrated good magnetic flux evolution into the vacuum vessel. Toroidal currents up to 43 kA have been achieved, and the generated current has increased in proportion to the magnetic flux connecting the electrodes. These results which show agreement with the CHI-scaling suggest that much higher levels of toroidal current can be generated on QUEST in an optimized CHI system in which the magnetic flux connecting the CHI electrodes is further increased.. 4. T. Ido, M. Hasegawa, R. Ikezoe, T. Onchi, K. Hanada, H. Idei, K. Kuroda, Y. Nagashima, Conceptual design of a heavy ion beam probe for the QUEST spherical tokamak, Review of Scientific Instruments, https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0101770, 93, 113516, 2022.11, A heavy ion beam probe (HIBP) has been designed for the QUEST spherical tokamak to measure plasma turbulence and the profiles of electric potential profiles. Using a cesium ion beam with an energy of several 10 keV, the observable region covers most of the upper half of the plasma. Although the probe beam is deflected by the poloidal magnetic field produced by plasma current and poloidal coil currents, it can be detected under plasma current up to 150 kA by modifying the trajectories with two electrostatic sweepers. According to the numerical estimation of the intensity of the detected beam, sufficient signal intensity for measuring plasma turbulence can be obtained over almost the measurable area when the electron density is up to 1 × 1019 m−3, which is larger than the cut-off density of electron cyclotron heating in QUEST. The performance of the designed HIBP is sufficient to explore the mechanisms of heat and particle transport in magnetically confined plasmas, including the influence of plasma wall interactions, which is a goal of the QUEST project.. 5. R. Raman, K. Kuroda, K. Hanada, M. Ono, M. Hasegawa, T.Onchi, R. Ikezoe, H. Idei, T. Ido, J.A. Rogers, Design Considerations for the Implementation of a High-Field Side Transient CHI System on QUEST, IEEE Transactions onPlasma Science, https://doi.org/10.1109/TPS.2022.3193069, (1-6),2022, 2022.08, Transient coaxial helicity injection (T-CHI), a method first developed on the small helicity injected torus (HIT-II) experiment and then validated on the much larger National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX) device, is a method to initiate an inductive-like tokamak plasma discharge without reliance on the central solenoid. A CHI discharge is initiated by driving current along magnetic flux that connects the inner and outer divertor plates on one end of the tokamak. To permit this, on both HIT-II and NSTX, toroidal ceramic insulators were used to electrically separate the inner and outer vessel components. The use of such large toroidal vacuum insulators may not be easy to implement in reactors. To address this issue, the Q-shu University experiments with steady-state spherical tokamak (ST) (QUEST) is developing a reactor-relevant CHI configuration in which one of the divertor plates is electrically insulated from the rest of the vessel. The first application of T-CHI on QUEST biased the CHI electrode to the outer vessel. While the CHI discharges could be easily generated, it was found that as the discharge filled the vessel, the separation distance between the injector magnetic flux footprints widened, a condition that is not favorable for the generation of closed flux surfaces. Biasing the electrode to the inner wall is a configuration similar to that used on NSTX and HIT-II, but initial testing in this configuration has proved to be challenging. The design described here overcomes the present limitation by locating the CHI electrode much closer to the CHI injector flux coil and using an NSTX-like gas injection manifold to enable high-field-side T-CHI startup on QUEST. The concepts described in this article should also benefit the future implementation of T-CHI systems in other tokamaks and spherical tokamaks.. 6. Makoto Hasegawa, Daisuke Sakurai, Aki Higashijima, Ichiro Niiya, Keiji Matsushima, Kazuaki Hanada, Hiroshi Idei, Takeshi Ido, Ryuya Ikezoe, Takumi Onchi, Kengo Kuroda, Towards automated gas leak detection through cluster analysis of mass spectrometer data, Fusion Engineering and Design, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fusengdes.2022.113199, 180, 113199, 2022.06, In order to generate high-performance plasma for future fusion power generation, it is desirable to keep high quality vacuum during experiment. Mass spectrometer is commonly used to monitor the vacuum quality and to record the amount of atoms and molecules in the vacuum vessel. Leak is the most serious accident to avoid that can nullify an experiment and even harm researchers. Detecting leaks are ever more important since it can be easily overlooked, e.g., when the deterioration in the vacuum degree is modest. This forces the researcher to carefully observe the vacuum and mass spectrometer data. This article presents a way to suggest potential leaks in the vacuum vessel by analyzing mass spectrometer data. This is done by utilizing the Euclidean distance between composition ratios at different times for the clustering using the daily composition ratio. We show that our cluster analysis is an effective way of separating these two cases, which results in a semi-automatic determination of leaks is more efficient than the current norm, which is to check many measures to find a small abnormality in the data manually. We plan further model improvements for long-term evaluation.. 7.

However, a zero-sequence component appears causing problems in the load, such as a motor. A quaternion is a four-dimensional hypercomplex number with an imaginary part that can simultaneously represent and deal with three-phase voltages. In addition, the quaternion is expressed in the exponential form; thus, it can easily represent the space vector rotation. Two zero configurations were used to optimize the ripple characteristics in fictitious pulse-width-modulated voltage-source inverter. The two zero configurations are used to remove the zero-sequence component from the matrix converter. The quaternion can be differentiated in time as well as rotate in space. Therefore, it is used to analyze transient phenomena in the matrix converter's rise-up and rise-down phases, and the switching's transition phase.. 8.

A strong transition was observed in the heating and plasma current ramp-up. The initial bulk electron heating regime exhibits Tebulk ∼ 140 eV and no hard x-ray (HXR) emission with a low Ip of ∼15 kA; it abruptly transitions to a regime that exhibits a low Tebulk of ∼10 eV and a strong HXR emission with a high Ip of ∼50 kA. This behavior is distinctly different from that observed in previous fundamental ECRH experiments. The mechanism of the heating and current drive transition are investigated considering wave power absorption and plasma power balance. The results indicate that the transition is caused by the favorable heating of tail electrons where the RF power absorption at the 2nd harmonic increases nearly linearly with Tetail, while the power transfer from the tail electrons to the bulk electrons decreases with 1/Tetail 0.5. This causes a rapid transition to a state with high Tetail while reducing Tebulk towards colder ion temperature. The understanding of the transition mechanism\n\nhelps to consider plasma current start-up using 2nd harmonic ECRH for tokamak reactors such as JT-60 SA and ITER.\n\n. 9. K. Hanada, N. Yoshida, M.

The HW was installed summer 2014. Quantitative analysis pertaining to the HW at 373 K is carried out, and clarify the quantitative impact of shot history that obviously appears in wall stored hydrogen just before the discharge at the wall temperature. The model indicates the plasma-induced deposition layer play an essential role in fuel particle balance. A clear temperature dependence of fuel recy-cling was observed using outgassing just after plasma termination and played an essential role in regulation of particle balance. Consequently, long duration discharges lasting more than 1 h has been obtained at wall tem-perature, TW 10. Kengoh KURODA, Roger RAMAN, Makoto HASEGAWA, Takumi ONCHI, Brian A.

Discharges injected from the low field side (LFS) and from the high field side (HFS) were examined. Compared to the LFS injection case, the HFS injection has the advantages of providing access to a higher toroidal field and better controlling the location of the injector flux footprint location. Although the present PF coils on QUEST are not well positioned to form the injector flux on the HFS\n\ninjector region and there has been a frequent occurrence of the spurious arcs, known as absorber arcs, HFS injection has shown flux evolution in a shape that is suitable for the formation of closed flux surfaces. The discharges were improved by installing an in-vessel-coil and adding a new cylindrical electrode to the existing CHI electrode. The results show that the new cylindrical electrode allowed the flux to evolve stably while allowing both the inner and the outer injector flux footprint to remain in the vicinity of the cylindrical electrode. This\n\nconfiguration which inherently generates a narrow injector flux footprint width resulted in discharges that strongly suggested the persistence of the CHI generated plasma after the injector current was reduced to zero. These studies have informed us of the need to improve the CHI gas injection system so that the absorber arcs could be better controlled in the HFS injection configuration.. 11.

QUEST has a high-temperature wall capable of active heating and cooling as a plasma-facing wall. With this hot wall, a temperature rise test was conducted with 673K as the target temperature. It was confirmed that the hot wall could maintain the temperature above 600 K. Feedback control of particle fueling was conducted to control Hα\n\nemission, which is closely related to influx to the wall. Using this particle fueling control and setting the hot wall temperature to 473 K, it was possible to obtain a discharge of more than 6 h. In this discharge, the fueling rate of particles decreased with time, and finally became zero, losing the particle fueling controllability. However, as soon as the cooling water started to flow through the hot wall, particles could be supplied again, and controllability was restored. Thus, indicating that temperature control of the plasma first wall is important even in the high temperature environment of 473K to control particle retention of the wall.. 12.

The intensity of the low-frequency PDW on the HFS X-mode injection was significantly enhanced over the O-mode ECW injection from the low field side (LFS), where the mode conversion to electron Bernstein wave (EBW) was not expected. As the comparison was executed using plasmas with the same magnetic field and injection power, the wave injection method was considered as the primary cause of the difference in the PDW excitation. The frequency range of the low-frequency PDW was consistent with that of the lower hybrid wave (LHW) range, which was expected to be excited during the mode conversion to EBW. The low-frequency PDW intensity evolved in response to the plasma density, plasma current and injection power. This observation suggests that the low-frequency PDW intensity is a reliable indicator for the efficient mode conversion to EBW.. 13.

This concept is referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT), and predictive maintenance is a new valuable function associated with the IoT. In large-scale experimental facilities with many researchers, it is not desirable that experiments cannot be performed due to sudden failure of equipment. For this reason, it is important to predict the failure in advance based on the measurement results of sensors and to perform repairs in a planned manner. On the Q-shu University experiment with steady-state spherical tokamak (QUEST) large experimental device, it is necessary to drive a large current of 50 kA, and the diagnosis of its power line deterioration is well performed as predictive maintenance through the evaluation of its contact resistances of several micro ohms order on the network. In addition, as an example of the IoT, mechanisms to assist safe operation, such as a sound alarm system and an entrance management system, are built by sharing experimental information between devices via the network.. 14.

A sample can be exposed and extracted from the targeted plasma at\n\nany time using FESTA, however, when exposing the sample, the test chamber wall gets coated by some hydrogen\n\nas it is open to the QUEST vacuum vessel. We refer to this as the plasma-induced background. To measure the\n\namount of hydrogen retained by the sample itself, the contribution from the plasma induced background must be\n\nsubtracted from the measurements. To measure the accurate dynamic retention from plasma-exposed sample, a\n\nbackground subtraction model has been developed and tested.

Testing of LFS-to-HFS RF power transmission at 8.2 GHz, using an RG-50-type vacuum waveguide in a bench-scale device filled with SF6 gas at 0.03 Mpa, revealed that an RF power of 10.8 kW could traverse the fundamental electron cyclotron resonance layer for 60 s without breakdown. The short-length, open-ended waveguide antenna used in the HFS injection-induced wave diffraction reduced the efficiency of power delivery to the upper hybrid resonance (UHR) by approximately 7% at an electron temperature of 50 eV. The HFS injection was able to produce brighter camera images than the standard LFS injection. The location of the UHR, as estimated by measuring the density with an interferometer, agreed with its location as measured by plasma radiation low-field, side-edge positions shown by fast camera imaging. This indicates that the plasma was produced by mode-converted EBW. The HFS injection had an absorption efficiency of 96%, compared to 40% for LFS. A greater fluctuation of floating potential adjustable to the lower hybrid wave (LHW) was observed in the HFS case by installing a Langmuir probe, confirming that EBW conversion efficiency was higher in the HFS case. Moreover, after setting the poloidal field to BPF = 7.6 mT, plasma current (IP) in the HFS peaked at 1.3 kA, as opposed to 0.3 kA for LFS, despite LFS injection having a total power of 55 kW, compared to 40 kW for HFS. However, as the impurity level was comparatively high, it is believed that this IP is dominated by pressure-drive, which makes it difficult to analyze EBWCD. Finally, the line-integrated density in the HFS injection peaked at 1.6 × 1018 m−2, compared to 8 × 1017 m−2 in the LFS one.. 16.

Fusion 60 (2020) 016030 (13pp), 2019.12, [URL], A 28 GHz system with a high-power gyrotron tube has been used for the QUEST spherical tokamak to form an over-dense plasma for electron Bernstein wave (EBW) heating and current drive with an 8.2 GHz-wave. Non-inductive high-density plasma ramp-up experiments with dual-frequency (dual-f ) electron cyclotron (EC) (8.2 GHz and 28 GHz) waves were conducted. A spontaneous density jump (SDJ) to an over-dense state was first observed as a bifurcation phenomenon in the dual-f wave experiment. The over-dense plasma on the 8.2 GHz wave was non-inductively ramped up to 25 kA, and was maintained for 0.4 s under stable plasma equilibrium after two such jumps in one shot. Heating to mildly energetic electrons and bulk electrons was observed even in the over-dense region. The electrostatic EBW heating effect on the mildly energetic electrons in the over-dense region is assessed following a dispersion analysis of the 8.2 GHz wave. The bulk electron heating effect observed is explained as heat exchange from mildly energetic electrons heated by the electrostatic EBW. Remarkably, a high hard-x-ray-radiation temperature of ~500 keV was also observed in tangential viewing for current-carrying electrons in the over-dense core region. Synergetic heating from the overlap of different 28 GHz EC harmonic resonances as well as higher harmonic heating is discussed for maintaining the highly energetic electrons in the over-dense core region. In addition, the SDJ process and mechanism are considered based on the discussion of the electron heating effects with the 8.2 GHz wave.. 17.

The system comprises a chevron micro-channel\n\nplate (MCP) and a phosphor screen, which together serve as an SXR detector and image intensifier, along with a\n\nhigh-speed video camera for capturing and storing image data. The system can be used in imaging mode to obtain\n\nhigh spatial- and time-resolution images or in photon counting mode at an ultra-high framing rate of 100 kHz to\n\nobtain SXR energy spectra.

QUEST has all-metal plasma facing walls (PFWs) that were temperature controlled during the experiments. The presence of a transport barrier for hydrogen (H) at the interface between a plasma-induced deposition layer and metallic substrate was confirmed by nuclear reaction analysis with exposing deuterium plasma. An effective method to evaluate global hydrogen flux to PFWs is proposed, taking advantage of the nature of wall saturation. The outgoing flux of fuel particles from the PFWs just after the plasma termination was proportional to the square of wall-stored H, which indicates that enhanced recombination of solved hydrogen played an essential role in dynamic retention and was in agreement with predictions from the H-barrier model. A simple calculation based on the combination of wall modelling and rate equations of the H states denoted a significant impact of wall modelling on the time response of the plasma density. Hence, a proper wall model including the effects of the deposition layer creating the H barrier is required to be developed, even for all-metal PFW devices.. 19. Takumi Onchi, Hiroshi Idei, K.

A simple wall model including the plasma-induced deposition layer that creates hydrogen (H) barriers, called the H barrier model, was established. A simple calculation, based on a combination of H state rate equations and the H barrier model, was applied to real plasma in the early phase of its longest discharge. The model accurately reconstructed the evolutions of electron density and wall-stored H over time, proper values are chosen for the parameters that are difficult to determine experimentally. Comparative calculations that used the H barrier and a fully reflective models, predicted significant impacts of wall models on the plasma density time response and value of electron density, indicating that a proper wall model should be developed for all-metal PFW devices.. 21.

In our previous work, plasma equilibrium solution was fitted assuming all plasma current is flowing in the inside of the Last Closed Flux Surface (LCFS). It was solved within isotropic pressure profile by EFIT code. Opposite-polarity current density region appeared in the high-field region. Here in this article, considering the toroidal rotation, the equilibrium is fitted within nested magnetic surfaces by SU-EFIT. Though the plasma magnetic axis shifts outward due to the centrifugal force, the opposite polarity current does not disappear in the high-field region. And relation between the toroidal rotation speed and the poloidal beta value will be discussed.. 22. H. Idei, T. Onchi, T. Kariya, T.I. Tsujimura, S. Kubo, S. Kobayashi, M. Sakaguchi, T. Imai, M.

A launcher system with two quasi-optical mirrors providing beam steering capability was designed to focus the incident beam to a small-sized waist of ∼0.05 m at the second-harmonic EC resonance layer. A relatively large focusing mirror was designed based on a Kirchhoff integral code developed to derive wave solutions. The focusing property of the launched beam was first confirmed with a 3-dimensional (3D) electromagnetic-wave simulator. Focusing characteristics were also checked at low-power test facilities, together with the steering capability. The performance of this launcher system was demonstrated to work as designed, and assembled in the QUEST device. The system was applied to the non-inductive second-harmonic EC plasma ramp-up experiments with no optimization required regarding the incident polarization. The results obtained for the non-inductive plasma ramp-up are also presented.. 23.

Radio frequency (RF; 8.2 GHz) power was delivered from the low field side (LFS) to the high field side HFS through waveguides, and from the HFS placed 20 cm above the mid-plane of the vacuum vessel. The aim was to compare the RF launches from the LFS and HFS. The plasma brightness, measured by a fast camera, as well as the Hα signal captured along the mid-plane, was noticeably higher in the HFS launch than in the LFS launch. The HFS injection achieved a plasma current of approximately 130 A, versus 35 A in the LFS injection. The electron density ne predicted from the position of the upper hybrid resonance agreed with the line-averaged ne measured by an interferometer, confirming the effective conversion and subsequent damping of the EBW mode. The RF leakage of the HFS injection was less than one-sixth that of the LFS injection. These results indicate that HFS delivers better RF coupling and conversion efficiency to EBW than LFS injection. Such efficient plasma heating via EBW will significantly enhance the plasma production.. 24.

QUEST, which is a middle-sized spherical tokamak, has hot walls that act asplasma-facing walls. They can be actively heated with sheath heaters and actively cooled with water. To controlthe wall temperature, heating and cooling systems have been developed. These systems adjust the power of thesheath heaters and the motor valves of the cooling system, respectively. The two systems communicate viaEthernet through UDP and control the hot-wall temperature cooperatively. The plasma control system (PCS) inQUEST has also been modified, especially with respect to gas fueling, in order to enable long-duration plasmasustainment. A feedback controller has been installed in the PCS, together with a mass flow controller, allowingHα emission from the plasma which is used as a reference signal, to be well controlled. Plasma density calculationsusing a field-programmable gate array are proposed for the feedback control system.. 26. H. Idei1, T. Kariya2, T. Imai2, K. Mishra4, T. Onchi1, O. Watanabe1, H. Zushi1, K.

A high plasma current of 54 kA was non-inductively ramped up and sustained stably for 0.9 s with a 270 kW 28 GHz wave. A higher plasma current of 66 kA was also non-inductively achieved with a slow ramp-up of the vertical field. We have achieved a significantly higher plasma current than those achieved previously with the 2nd harmonic EC waves. This fully non-inductive 2nd harmonic EC plasma ramp-up method might be useful for future burning plasma devices and fusion reactors, in particular for operations at half magnetic field with the same EC heating equipment.. 27.

In this work, an innovative colorimetry-based method was developed to measure the thickness of the deposited film on the actual QUEST wall. Because the optical constants of the deposited film on the PFW were position-dependent and the extinction coefficient k1 was about 1.0–2.0, which made the probing light not penetrate through some thick deposited films, the colorimetry method developed can only provide a rough value range of thickness of the metal-containing film deposited on the actual PFW in QUEST. However, the use of colorimetry is of great benefit to large-area inspections and to radioactive materials in future fusion devices that will be strictly prohibited from being taken out of the limited area.. 28.

In this paper, we present a combinative investigation of radio frequency (RF)-induced breakdown experiments in QUEST (Q-shu University Experiment with Steady-State Spherical Tokamak) and a one-point model of hydrogen ionization. Experimental results with two different frequencies of 2.45 GHz and 8.2 GHz showed that the clear threshold on connection length, L, existed for breakdown with a negative n-index configuration n=−(R/B v )·(∂B v /∂R)\n\nn=−(R/Bv)·(∂Bv/∂R)\n\n, where R is the major radius and Bv the is vertical magnetic field. In contrast, breakdown was always obtained with positive n-index when changing L. It indicates that a lifetime of an incubated electron plays a significant role in the plasma breakdown. According to one-point model calculation, the experimental threshold of L is well predicted by the lifetime of the incubated electron estimated by employing the loss term along with L. The model calculation also describes the requirement of the minimum electron temperature Te for RF-induced breakdown to realize an avalanche of electrons in the tokamak magnetic structure.. 29.

The PCS controls the plasma edge position with the real-time identificationof plasma current and its position. This identification is done with not only flux loops but also hall sensors.The gas fueling method by piezo valve with monitoring the H signal filtered by a digital low-pass filterare proposed and suitable for the steady-state operation on QUEST.

Non-inductive plasmas were maintained for approximately 3–5 min, during which time power balance estimates could be achieved by monitoring wall and cooling-water temperatures. Approximately 70%–90% of the injected power could be accounted for by calorimetric measurements and approximately half of the injected power was found to be deposited on the vessel wall, which is slightly dependent on the magnetic configuration. The power distribution to water-cooled limiters, which are expected to be exposed to local heat loads, depends significantly on the magnetic configuration, however some of the deposited power is due to energetic electrons, which have large poloidal orbits and are likely to be deposited on the plasma facing components.. 32.

We consider that the current in the open magnetic surface is due to orbit-driven current by high-energy particles in RF-driven plasma. So based on the analysis of current density profile based on the orbit-driven current, plasma equilibrium is to be calculated. We calculated high energy particles guiding center orbits as a contour plot of conserved variable in Hamiltonian formulation and considered particles initial position with different levels of energy and pitch angles that satisfy resonance condition. Then the profile of orbit-driven current is estimated by multiplying the particle density on the resonance surface and the velocity on the orbits. This analysis shows negative current near the magnetic axis and hollow current profile is expected even if pressure driven current is considered. Considering the hollow current profile shifted toward the low-field region, the equilibrium is fitted by J-EFIT coded by MATLAB.. 33. O. Mitarai 1, K. Nakamura 2, M. Hasegawa 2, T. Onchi 2, H.

This tendency restricts a divertor operation to the smaller plasma current regime. As the inner divertor coil has a smaller mutual inductance, it would be expected that its utilization seems to be better for easier plasma current ramp-up for a divertor operation. In this work, we made comparative studies on the plasma current ramp-up for two divertor coils. It is found that while the inner divertor coil with smaller mutual inductance needs a larger coil current, the outer divertor coil with larger mutual inductance needs a smaller coil current for divertor operation. Thus we have found that the plasma current ramp-up characteristics are almost similar for both configurations. We also propose a new fueling method for spherical tokamak (ST) using the coaxial helicity injection (CHI). The main plasma current would be generated at first, and then the CHI plasma current is created between bottom two electrode plates and merged into the main plasma current for fueling.. 34.

To observe this phenomenon and the characteristics of the orbit-driven current, current density profiles have been calculated on two different equilibrium conditions. We calculated current density profiles from particle guiding center orbits both for the fundamental and the second harmonic resonances for the 8.2 GHz electron cyclotron current drive. From this calculation, hollow current density profiles have been obtained with significant characteristics on both conditions. Only positive current distribution has been observed in the open magnetic surfaces outside of the closed magnetic surfaces.. 35.

Control. Fusion 58 (2016) 115004 (12pp), 2016.09, The response of the far scrape-off layer (far-SOL) to strong gas puffing (SGP), and its role as the boundary condition for core plasma, are investigated using a two-point Langmuir probe measurement in the high poloidal beta configuration in the QUEST spherical tokamak. The temperature and heat flux behave in an opposite way in the far-SOL and end-plate region after SGP, although SGP increases the density globally. The apparent density decay time in the far-SOL area is much longer than that in the core. Significant co-current flow is driven solely by the electron cyclotron wave in the far-SOL flow. Sheared flow is also observed in the perpendicular velocity profile during the recovered current flat-top phase, and such flow profiles are flattened by SGP. These flow profiles are attributed not only to drift-driven flow but also to transport-driven flow, the sink effect on the end-plate, and the balance of the neutral particle source.. 36.

Electron cyclotron wave injection in the Ohmic plasma features excitation of low frequency coherent fluctuations near the separatrix and enhanced cross-field transport. Plasma shifts from initial high field side limiter bound (inboard limited, IL) towards inboard poloidal null (IPN) configuration with steepening of the density profile at the edge. This may have facilitated the increased edge and SOL fluctuation activities. Observation of the coherent mode, associated plasma flow, and particle out-flux, for the first time in the IPN plasma configuration in a spherical tokamak may provide further impetus to the edge and SOL turbulence studies in tokamaks.. 37.

Direct information about hydrogen retention in the areas far from main plasma-wall interaction is essential because the significant part of the global retention is due to atomic hydrogen. Incident hydrogen flux Γinc is numerically reconstructed by fitting the experimentally measured hydrogen flux Γp, permeated through the membrane. The sensitivity of the probe is improved when compared with other work which allows dynamic changes of the retention flux to be monitored, allowing detection of 10% of the Γinc modulation, or ∼1017 H m−2s−1.. 38.

Thus, the PCS is distributed into a main workstation (WS) and subsystem (SS) with a reflectivememory (RFM) in order to share data between these systems so as to mitigate the load on each system.As a result, 128 double-precision floating-point numbers (DBLs) can be transferred from the SS to the WSwith a maximum latency of 250 s. The WS and the SS each have quad-core CPUs, and tasks are executedin parallel. Although one of the four cores is intermittently occupied by up to 90% by this transaction, theoccupation is normally 60%. A time correction procedure is used to map the recorded data sets on theWS and the SS to a common time base by referring to the time difference between two systems.. 45.

Repetitive transition between LR and HR was induced by periodic gas puffing and the period to recover to LR, rec, was gradually prolonged with the plasma duration. The period, rec, normalized by gas rate has a linear relation to time-integrated H. This indicates hydrogen recycling induced an intentional gas puffing is increasing with time-integrated H which an indicator of hydrogen (H) fluence to the wall. To understand the dependence, deuterium (D) storing capability of the specimen exposed to QUEST plasmas was investigated by implantation of D2+\n\nions of 1keV and subsequent thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) as a post-mortem analysis. A diffusion-trap model, reconstructing the obtained the results of TDS, shows a clear dependence of recycling ratio on fluence and a time evolution of wall-stored H can be reconstructed. The model calculation indicates surface recombination on the deposition layer plays an essential role in QUEST wall behaviour. Wall temperature dependence on the number of injected H to keep density is experimentally investigated and is agreed with the model calculation. This result is quite helpful to execute hot wall experiments on QUEST.. 48.

The drift error caused by the long time-integration of magnetic raw signals has to be removed. With a captured image of the plasma’s cross section, the plasma’s position is identified by use of image filters. The measured magnetic flux values are corrected to the calculated flux values estimated by using this plasma position. The correction with the captured image work as expected in the preliminary result using a flashlight instead of a plasma.. 49.

It found that appropriate magnetic configuration with positive n-index and reduction of particle recycling was crucial to achieve the non-inductive plasma current start-up (PCS) successfully. Especially the controllability of particle recycling should be improved by wall conditioning based on successive plasma production and wall cleaning with electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECR) plasmas induced by RF in frequency of 2.45GHz.. 50.

In addition, the plasma current effect in the open magnetic surfaces outside of the closed magnetic surfaces is considered in the RF-driven divertor plasma. In the reconstruction process, singular value (SV) decomposition is used and optimal criterion function for generalized cross validation is estimated concerning truncation or reduction of the small-SV components.. 51.

The formation of a natural inboard poloidal null associated with high βp is explained consistently by high diamagnetism and negative triangularity. As βp is increased, the poloidal null point penetrates further into the vacuum vessel, which is qualitatively explained by the analytic model. Transition from inboard (high field side) limiter bound to the natural divertor configuration is associated with a reduction of the edge safety factor without appreciable enhancement of MHD activities. Such a scenario is also addressed successfully with the model.. 52. Banerjee, Santanu; Zushi, H.; Nishino, N.; Hanada, K.; Ishiguro, M.; Tashima, S.; Liu, H.

Fluctuations in the SOL towards low field side are dominated by coherent convective structures (blobs). Two dimensional structures of the higher order moments (skewness s and kurtosis k) representing the shape of probability density function (PDF) are studied. s and k are seen to be functions of the magnetic field lines. s and k are consistently higher towards the bottom half of the vessel in the SOL showing the blob trajectory along the field lines from the top towards bottom of the vessel. Parabolic relation (k = As-2 + C) is observed between s and k near the plasma boundary, featuring steep density gradient region and at the far SOL. The coefficient A, obtained experimentally, indicates a shift of prominence from pure drift-wave instabilities towards fully developed turbulence. Numerical coefficients characterizing the Pearson system are derived which demonstrates the progressive deviation of the PDF from Gaussian towards gamma from the density gradient region, towards the far SOL. Based on a simple stochastic differential equation, a direct correspondence between the multiplicative noise amplitude, increased intermittency, and hence change in PDF is discussed.

The configuration was characterized by a high toroidal magnetic mirror ratio of 2 and a steady vertical magnetic field of more than 10% of the toroidal magnetic field. The generation and confinement of energetic electrons having energy greater than 10 keV were studied using hard x-rays. Because of the energetic electron pressure, a natural divertor formed with an inboard poloidal field null at the high poloidal beta (approximately 3-4).. 60.

This paper describes the setup of the optical system, injection of the laser pulse into the cavity, and properties of the confined laser pulse. A combination of Pockels cell plus polarizer, which serves as an optical shutter, allows us to inject and then confine intense laser pulses in the cavity. A photodiode signal monitoring the very weak light leaking from the cavity mirrors demonstrated that the laser pulse makes many round trips, with a round-trip efficiency of approximately 0.73. The effective number of round trips (i.e., the signal enhancement factor) is approximately 3.7. For an injection efficiency of approximately 0.69, a cavity-confined laser pulse, applied to Thomson scattering, will yield a scattered signal that is five times larger than that from a single-pass laser pulse.. 61.

Magnetic fluxes are numerically integrated at 100 kHz using FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) modules and transferred to a main calculation loop at 4 kHz. With these signals, plasma shapes are identified in real time at 2 kHz under the assumption that the plasma current can be represented as one filament current. This calculation is done in another calculation loop in parallel by taking advantage of a multi-core processor of the plasma control system. The inside and outside plasma edge positions are controlled to their target positions using PID (proportional-integral-derivative) control loops. Whereas the outside edge position can not be controlled by the outer PF coil current, the inside edge position can be controlled by the inner PF coil current. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The poloidal field null point appeared in the chamber for MOMFC > 1.8 at a plasma current value of ∼15 kA. Poloidal beta and temperature of hard X-rays increased with MOMFC. This suggests that high poloidal beta equilibrium plasma is produced by better confinement of energetic trapped particles.. 65.

This non-intrusive technique can provide two dimensional velocity fields at high spatial and temporal resolution from a fast framing image sequence and hence can provide better insights in plasma flow as compared to conventional probe measurements. Applicability of the technique is tested with simulated image pairs. Finally, it is applied to tangential fast visible images of QUEST as a test case to estimate the scrape off layer flow in Ohmic and ECRH driven plasma discharges.. 66.

Blob-filaments extended along field lines do correspond to over-dense plasma structures and propagated across the field lines to the outer wall. The radial velocity of the blob structure, Vb, was obtained by three methods and was dominantly driven by the E x B force. The radial velocity, size of the blob showed good agreements with the results obtained by sheath-connected interchange theoretical model. Vb corresponds to roughly 0.02-0.07 of the local sound speed (Cs) in QUEST. The higher moments (skewness S and kurtosis K) representing the shape of PDF of density fluctuation are studied. Their least squares fitting with quadratic polynomial is K = (1.60 +/- 0.27) S-2 - (0.46 +/- 0.20). The larger blob structures, occurring only 10% of the time, can carry more than 60% loss of the entire radial particle flux. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.. 68. K. Tokunaga, T. Hotta, K.

The instability we considered is that the toroidal plasma moves either up or down in the vacuum chamber until it meets the vessel wall and is extinguished. The actively controlled coils (HCU and HCL) outside the vacuum vessel are serially connected in feedback with a measurement of the plasma vertical position to provide stabilizing control. In this work, a robust controller is employed by using the loop synthesis method, and provides robust stability over a wide range of n-index. Moreover, the gain of the robust controller is lower than that of a typical proportional derivative (PD) controller in the operational frequency range; it indicates that the robust controller needs less power consumption than the PD controller does.. 74.

Major Japanese fusion laboratories and universities are mutually connected through the dedicated virtual private network, named SNET, on SINET4. It has 3 different categories; (i) LHD remote participation, (ii) bilateral experiments' collaboration, and (iii) remote use of supercomputer. By extending the LABCOM data system developed at LHD, FVL supports (i) and (ii) so that it can deal with not only LHD data but also the data of two remote experiments: QUEST at Kyushu University and GAMMA10 at University of Tsukuba. FVL has applied the latest \"cloud\" technology for both data acquisition and storage architecture. It can provide us high availability and performance scalability of the whole system. With a well optimized TCP data transferring method, the unified data access platform for both experimental data and numerical computation results could become realistic on FVL. The FVL project will continue demonstrating the ITER-era international collaboration schemes and the necessary technology. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.. 78.

Higher order moments (skewness s and kurtosis k) of spatio- temporal fluctuations are investigated. Background fluctuations, generation of coherent convective structures (blobs) and their propagation are analysed at the intensity gradient (R-im) and the source- free (essentially vacuum on the low- field side) regions, respectively. Parabolic relation (k = As-2 + C) is observed between s and k on the entire R- Z plane for a wide range of B-z/B-t. Progressive shift from the Gaussian statistics beyond R-im is observed with increasing B-z/B-t. From the moments of the probability density functions, possible location for blob generation is inferred to be R-im. Direct correspondence is observed with the prominence of the blobs and increase in stochastic forces with the increase in field pitch. Distribution of waiting time suggests that the blob generation may be a Poisson process. Accelerated cross field transport is observed for reasonably large-sized blobs.. 79. Santanu Banerjee, H.

The camera uses a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor detector with a maximum resolution of 1024 x 1024 at 7000 frames/s (fps) and can achieve 775 kfps at a resolution of 128 x 24. In this paper, we present the salient features of the system and its application to study edge turbulence in 8.2 GHz ECRH driven slab plasma, without plasma current. Vertical magnetic field (B-z) topology is varied with three sets of poloidal field (PF) coils and the variation in the edge turbulence is investigated as a function of the B-z strength and curvature. Fluctuation amplitude was highest for the shallow PF well. Cross-correlation coefficient shows distinct coherent mode along z direction at the steep density gradient region and it grows with the PF mirror ratio. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

The antenna was designed to excite an elliptically polarized pure O-mode wave in oblique injection for the O-X-B mode conversion scenario, and its good performance was confirmed at a high power level. Long pulse discharges with a plasma current of 10 kA and 15 kA were non-inductively attained for 37 s and 20 s, respectively, with only radio frequency (RF) power. Divertor configurations were also obtained in the RF-sustained plasmas. A new operational window for sustained plasma current was observed in the high-density plasma with a higher RF incident power. Two new heating and current drive systems with an 8.56 GHz klystron and a 28 GHz gyrotron are being prepared to conduct CW EBWH/CD experiments in the high-density plasma.. 86.

Here, the plasma shape parameters such as minor radius, elongation, and triangularity are chosen as the fitting parameters to represent plasma shape more directly, and the applicability to the control of the plasma shape are described by evaluating its calculation time. In order to find minimum of an objective function with least-square technique, two methods are compared, namely a linear approximation method and a downhill simplex method. While high accuracies of the measured magnetic signals are required, the good reproducibility is obtained, and the plasma shape identification can be done within several milliseconds in both methods.. 90.
