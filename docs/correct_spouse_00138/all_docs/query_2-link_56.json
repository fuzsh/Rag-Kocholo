        "text": "I used to do this kind of crystal ball post (please excuse the chuu2ness) back in the day – it seemed easier to predict 10 years ago because, rather ironically, there wasn’t so much media and industry info available back then so all I could do was to try to analyze casting trends.\n\nI’d always used the ‘2/3-cours after’ thing (refer below) to spot potential stars – it was a very apparent trend/pattern to me even 10 years ago so yeah, I suppose everyone else noticed it too and it’s not something new or surprising…\n\nHowever, nowadays there are a lot more parties that have interest in, and influence over seiyuu castings that it’s kind of a crapshoot to predict first-time breakout stars especially with those idol tie-ups/gorioshi happening all the time – at best, what people can do now is to predict which seiyuu will ‘consolidate’ their success and turn it into a longer-term thing where they’re still steadily doing voice work into their 30s.\n\nHere, I will translate three articles featuring an anime magazine writer (A), an anime site editor (B) and an anisong insider (C) looking back at the trending seiyuu of 2015, and predicting the next big things for 2016. I read the first one way back when it was published, but only decided to translate now because we have the results to go with their predictions. There’re some pretty crude comments in there, you’ve been warned.\n\nFirst is the article written at the start of 2015. Not that every time they say ‘this year’, it’s referring to 2015.\n\nThe important period for a seiyuu is the 2nd cour after their first hit\n\nQ: In 2014, we had Uchida Maaya, who did a gravure shoot for Weekly Young Jump as well as Amamiya Sora who got a lot of buzz for her looks – you could say both of them were breakout stars for the year. What’s the outlook for 2015 like?\n\nA: Hard to say. No matter what we say, seiyuu fans would be like “No way!”.\n\nQ: You don’t have to bother about what the fans say. Just talk about it from the viewpoint of an industry insider.\n\nA: Okay then (laughs).\n\nB: In that case, how about Taneda Risa. If this was baseball, she’d have racked up 10 wins already.\n\nC: Her first heroine role was in 2012’s Shin Sekai Yori, and it was for 3 cours. Last year she was in the 2-cour Strike the Blood and 2 cours following that, she started getting popular doing anime work and this year, has been much sought-after. Her growth as an actor has been the most apparent.\n\nB: She was in countless things in 2014. The goddess of fortune was shining upon her. If she repeats that this year you could say she’s made it.\n\nC: It could be Yoshimura Haruka. She’s one of the pillars of Idolmaster Cinderella Girls and on top of that, she did SHIROBAKO and Sora no Method this year. She’s definitely in a good position since the Idolmaster Cinderella Girls anime starts next January. Now will be the time for auditioning for the shows starting in April and July so it’ll be interesting to see how many regular roles she can snag.\n\nA: Seiyuu who’ve had a hit anime will get audition offers coming in so what’s important is the 2-cours that follow that good role they got. It’s easy to see that I’m [Ent] pushed Yoshimura hard in 2014. Auditions, events, CDs; she got all of them, what’s left is to see whether she can sustain it next year.\n\nC: Since we’re talking about agencies, how about the force that is Horipro?\n\nYou can tell a seiyuu’s agency by looking at their face\n\nB: So that’d be Tadokoro Azusa. We did an article on her back in 2011 when she won the Grand Prix in Horipro’s Seiyuu Idol Audition and if I’m being honest, there were other people at the audition who sang and acted better than she did. Yet, she’s got that something where you just look at her & it gets you thinking “I wanna support her”.\n\nA: She’s well received by the industry people as well. Someone like Nakamura Eriko’s taking good care of her and even calls her ‘Koroazu’. Her face totally changes once she’s got make up on too (laughs). In that sense I’ve got high hopes for her. What’s best is that she can sing.\n\nB: Her singing is outstanding. She made her artist début in July last year and before her live concert that May she’d already done about 100 lives so she had thorough preparation. If she can get an OP/ED theme tie-up to one of her shows than she could potentially blow up. How about Terui Haruka? When I interviewed her I was impressed by how ambitious she was.\n\nC: That girl really ‘feels’ like Aoni [Pro]. Also she’s got big boobs.\n\nA: Yeah she looks like an Aoni girl. Plain but cute. I wonder why Aoni doesn’t take in flashy, cute girls. But yeah her boobs are big.\n\nB: It could be scary ‘cos Aoni really puts big effort into their juniors. You don’t see too much of someone like Ito Kanae these days after all. It used to be that every show had Ito Kanae in it. Same for Sugar [note: Sato Satomi] too.\n\nA: They push ‘em when they’re young, then leave it to them when they’ve made it. That’s why they get fewer jobs from that point onwards.\n\nQ: So for juniors, who do you think is showing signs of breaking out this year – the potential ‘Rookie Award Candidates’, so to say?\n\nThe Rookie Award Candidates – Lining up those who are well received by the industry\n\nC: Vims’ Hashimoto Chinami might take flight this year. She landed her first regular role in last summer’s Saikin, Imoto no Yousu ga Chotto Okasshindaga, and has been doing some other anime and a radio with Yoshimura Haruka. She’s got momentum.\n\nA: I’d say Ozawa Ari is looking good to be I’m’s next big ‘it’ girl. She had Gekkan Shojo Nozaki-kun in summer 2014 and staff will be thinking ‘let’s get her in to audition’. That’s why she hasn’t got much going on for this autumn or winter but starting next spring, she’ll be coming on strong.\n\nB: Kurosawa Tomoyo too. She’s not from seiyuu school, she’s a child actor. Since she’s used to having to deal with the adults, she’s good at handling herself and has gotten a good reception from the industry. Plus she looks cute.\n\nA: In terms of good industry reception, there’s Aoki Ruriko as well. She’ll give a wave even at small events. Staff love her too.\n\nC: It’s a natural gift to be liked by other people. If we’re talking about those with unusual beginnings, then there’s someone like Fujii Yukiyo who used to do stage lighting. It’s been 1-2 years since she converted into a voice actor and she’s been getting good roles. She’s still a junior but as she’s in Aoni, she might get a real push.\n\nB: Maybe Tanezaki Atsumi too. She did stuff like Karashi in Houzuki no Reitetsu last year. Her acting’s great. You can’t tell that she’s actually so young but she’s still not too well-known; if she gets the right roles then she could go far.\n\nThese 3 will be the male seiyuu to look out for\n\nQ: Finally, how about the male seiyuu?\n\nA: The guys are harder since they basically tend to use the same people over and over. That’s why you’ve only got someone like Matsuoka Yoshitsugu of late. Maybe also Hanae Natsuki. He had Aldnoah Zero and Tokyo Ghoul last year. Both shows have sequels this year.\n\nB: For me it’ll be Aoi Shota. He may be 27 but I think he’ll get a break. He’s originally a musician so it’s a given thing, but he can really sing. He did most of the guide vocals for UtaPri as well. He may be an ikemen but his persona is the scary, unpopular type. That’s the reason he’s grabbing many female fans. I think people can cheer him on with confidence. I just watched his live the other day and his fans were going “Shota, look at me~~” and he’s like an idol that way.\n\nC: I’ll say Murase Ayumu. He was the lead in Gatchaman Crowds and followed it up with Haikyuu!! so he’s in the midst of breaking out. He’s getting a load of roles lately. Also, Saito Soma who’s also in Haikyuu!! He’s 81[produce]’s next big thing.\n\n——————————————————————————————-\n\nSecondly, the follow-up article published on 30 Dec 2015 talking about the outcome of their predictions.\n\nThe unexpected big success of M.A.O\n\nQ: So this was the New Year 2015 project that surprisingly gained a lot of feedback. First of all, let’s look back at the year for the seiyuu industry including the predictions that were made initially.\n\nA: I’ve nothing to reflect upon about my previous forecasts. As expected, Ozawa Ari appeared in an increasing number of shows in 2015. Taneda Risa was in Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso and continued that 10+ baseball match winning run. B also hit the target with his prediction about Kurosawa Tomoyo.\n\nB: Yeah, she was the lead in Hibike! Euphonium after all.\n\nC: It’s a plus point for Kurosawa that she’s in college now, which makes it easier for her to work. Looks like she’ll be getting more jobs in the future. I think I got it right with Murase Ayumu and Saito Soma for the guys.\n\nA: On the other hand we had the unexpectedly prolific M.A.O [Ichimichi Mao]. According to this sheet she had more than 30 shows so that makes her the number one seiyuu in terms of the number of performances. I got the impression that her name would always be there if you looked at the staff credits roll.\n\nC: As the number of shows you work on increases you get to appear at events and stuff like that as well, so that means you can make money as a seiyuu.\n\nB: You make more from event performance fees than you do from working on anime episodes after all.\n\nQ: It’s a rare success case for a tarento-turned-seiyuu. Why do you think she earned so much work?\n\nA: Isn’t this what those seiyuu otaku are always deludedly talking about – the pillow business thing? (laughs)\n\nC: Totally not the case here. She’s the type who rushes home at the speed of light when the after-parties are done. Instead, her manager will be the one sitting there forever, drinking (bitter laugh). It seems she doesn’t really talk to her female co-stars either. She’s getting more work because her acting is great and she’s found favour with the sound directors.\n\nWill this year finally be Tadokoro Azusa’s year?\n\nQ: On the other hand Amamiya Sora didn’t manage to sustain (her success) following the high expectations of her.\n\nA: They pushed TrySail hard so her solo work took a bit of a back seat. I wonder if they’re trying to sell both as a ‘combo deal’.\n\nB: For TrySail, I’ve got the impression that the balance of sales between the 3 members is quite bad. There’s a huge difference between Amamiya and Asakura Momo + Natsukawa Shiina in terms of popularity.\n\nC: But M-san who’s in charge here will definitely turn up at Asakura Momo events (laughs).\n\nA: I mentioned Tadokoro Azusa as a potential breakout star last year, and for 2016 she’s singing the ending theme for Kyoto Animation’s Musaigen no Phantom World plus she’s appearing as mascot characters in anime so it looks like she might make it this year instead.\n\nC: Terui Haruka’s in a bit of a lull. Though she’s working quite a lot.\n\nB: Terui’s a bit similar to Kanetomo [Note: Kaneda Tomoko] and when you do events or radio there’s got to be a bit of a trade-off with the other performers, which makes it kind of hard to utilize her. She did actually do a radio show with Suwa Ayaka – Suwa herself is a natural airhead but Terui was even more of an airhead so Suwa quite sadly lost her flavour in the process (laughs).\n\nQ: Looking at the overall picture, and using last year as an example – it’s quite difficult to understand exactly what type of seiyuu sells.\n\nB: This year [2015], there weren’t many seiyuu who you’d see as a batter who could hit a home run with just one shot – instead, there were a lot of average hitters. Going by numbers alone, the I’m Enterprise (girls) Hayami Saori, Hikasa Yoko, Sakura Ayane and Ozawa Ari performed strongly.\n\nC: For dubbing, 81produce did well. On the other hand, Aoni Production was quiet.\n\nA: Perhaps they’re readying a curveball right now. Aoni’s training school Aoni Juku is crazily tough. Even getting through to Junior is a huge task. Lead roles aren’t something that come along later in life.\n\nC: I get the impression that they’re always late in coming though. (laughs)\n\n——————————————————————————————-\n\nPart 3 – predictions for 2016.\n\n2016 predictions: Female Seiyuu\n\nQ: Your predictions for 2016’s breakout seiyuu?\n\nA: I have someone that I have absolute confidence in. So you two go ahead first.\n\nC: I’ll go with Hanamori Yumiri. She’s an 18-year old signed to Swallow formerly known as Pony Canyon Artists and she’s starring in Garasu no Hana to Kowasu Sekai that hits cinemas in 2016. She’ll be in UnHappy which starts in January*. Also, Ueda Reina. She’s the lead in January’s* Bakuon!!. She’s a real nice girl and the type who’s loved by both her fellow actors as well as staff. In 81produce, she’s close in age to the Wake Up Girls! and i ☆Ris and I think the agency will give her the big push this year. She was also in the news recently for that crowdfunded project** that hit 2 million yen when it’s target amount was 600,000 yen.\n\n*note = both will actually air in April 2016 instead.\n\n**Idol Recollection, a project to get a themesong for a mobage recorded\n\nB: I think highly of Ueda too. My prediction though, is Hondo Kaede. She’s I’m Enterprise’s big hope. Her baby-faced visuals are something that would be well-received by the otaku. If we talk about this in terms of horse racing… using a rather outdated example, but she’d be Fuji Kiseki.\n\nQ: Maybe she should retire early then (laughs).\n\nB: No no, what I mean is that she’s the most amazing of her generation. Apart from Hondo there’s Kouno Marika from the seiyuu unit Earphones. Mausu Promotion’s putting a bit of effort into her. She shines brightly at events. In terms of horse racing she’d be Twin Turbo.\n\nQ: The one that never seems to win?\n\nC: She’s popular but doesn’t appear in anime that much, instead she has a lot of events.\n\nA: Finally it’s my turn. I have total confidence in my pick. Cast-iron confidence. If this was baseball then this person would play as huge a role as Akiyama Shogo of Seibu [Lions].\n\nQ: Ah, the Akiyama who set a record with 216 hits in a single season. That’s some confidence you have.\n\nA: My pick is Takahashi Rie! Definitely. She’s on the verge of her big break. She was in 3 shows in summer ’15 – Gakkou Gurashi, Ranpo Kitan & Sore ga Seiyuu! and she won all of those through auditions. What’s more, they were all different types of roles. She’ll grow even more as she continues to work with veterans. She’s the leadoff batter for 81[produce].\n\nC: It’s true that her agency is pushing her super hard.\n\nA: Apart from Takahashi I’d say Asai Ayaka. Her agency* isn’t that strong but I’ve this image that her foundations are solid. In baseball, she’d be Yokohama’s Kuramoto Toshihiko.\n\n*Seinenza Film Broadcasting\n\nQ: We can stop it with the baseball comparisons now.\n\n2016 predictions: Male Seiyuu\n\nB: Work for male seiyuu is increasing thanks to the emergence of social games. Stuff like Ensemble Stars! and Idolmaster Side M. There’s this new generation of male seiyuu who appear in nothing but social games and get popular off them – they’re called the ‘Socia-ge Generation’.\n\nC: For the new generation, in the lead would be Uchida Yuuma, who had the main role in the TV anime Classroom☆Crisis. He’s the younger brother of Uchida Maaya and he’s well taken care of by the people around him too. Probably will be the biggest breakout star of 2016. There’s also Chiba Shoya. He does the voice for the leader of the most popular unit High x Joker in Side M and he’ll be voicing the lead male role in 2016 anime ALL OUT!!.\n\nB: It’s hard to predict the guys. If I said Ume-chan [Umehara Yuichiro] people would complain “But he’s already made it big.\n\nQ: That’s okay. You don’t have to bother about those kinds of otaku who only know how to point out other people’s faults (laughs).\n\nA: I’ll say Shirai Yusuke, who was in Binan Koukou Chikyuu Bouei-bu LOVE! alongside Umehara. He’s the type who’s a bit dirty…or should I say, helps to make events livelier. He’s the least famous one in Boueibu so if they want to push him they’ve got to do it now.\n\n——————————————————————————————-\n\n[end]\n\nAs for me? Well, you can probably tell which seiyuu I am vouching for by the articles I choose to translate (so I apologize to the idols who I have zero interest in w).\n\nFor me, here’s what I’m thinking about going into 2016:\n\n1.The I’m Enterprise girls: I have always been fond of I’m Ent girls, from the days of Ueda Kana & Nakahara Mai through to Saito Chiwa, Hikasa Yoko and Hayami Saori, and now to people like Ozawa Ari and Onishi Saori. Their next three big things will be Hondo Kaede, Naganawa Maria & Senbongi Sayaka.\n\n2.Aketagawa Jin’s girls: Jin has helped the likes of Taneda Risa break out in recent years; it’s worth nothing who his current favourite girls are – Ozawa Ari, Ishigami Shizuka, Takahashi Minami, Kimura Juri, Takahashi Rie. Ozawa Ari is on fine footing already as is Takahashi Rie (new Precure lead), but it remains to be seen whether Ishigami and Takamina can start getting hired by other sound directors. The key cours to gauge their long-term career outlook will be spring/summer 2016.\n\n3.Ponycan is the new Muray/SME/Aniplex: So it’s funny that I have no problems with Aketagawa’s casting business yet I do have a bone to pick with Ponycan. In fact, I get exasperated whenever I see that Ponycan is producing any new series or movie ‘cos I’m almost convinced that they’ll stick one of their kids to lead the show or sing the theme song. For Jin-kun I have no real issues because he hires people who can at least do their day job properly. For Ponycan we get stuck with Taketatsu Ayana in ill-fitting roles and breaking my eardrums with her ‘singing’, and now it looks like we’ll get tons of Hanamori Yumiri. I’m not sure whether I should be jumping with joy about that…maybe I’ll just wait for her swimsuit photobook or something.\n\n4.Speaking of Muray: I can’t stand Amamiya Sora any more. There, I said it. She was a great turn-off for me in 2015, voice-acting wise (Plamemo, Monmusu). And she just kicked off 2016 in a bad way with Konosuba. Stop annoying me with the DAAARRRLINNNGSSS guys, it just makes my ears bleed faster.\n\n5.Blur the lines, moar!: Just like the lines between the mainstream idol/talent world and the seiyuu industry are getting ever the fainter, I’d like to see more seiyuu being on both the ‘dark’ (eroge) and ‘light’ sides. KenPro and Pro-Fit are amongst the agencies who encourage/allow their charges to do the dirty – we’ve seen Ito Shizuka and Nabatame Hitomi do that over the years with KenPro. Pro-Fit has got girls like Nagatsuma Juri, Takamori Natsumi and now Ishigami Shizuka who do the ero stuff as well. The pay is nice too! Obviously I want this to happen cos it spares me having to play eroge on mute..but yeah, wishful thinking.\n\n6.The halfs: I’ve been doing a bunch of articles on half-Japanese, half-Caucasian seiyuu – Ishii Mark, Lynn, Sarah Emi Bridcutt, and Arthur Lounsbery to come at some point. It’s an interesting niche to be in. 3/4 of them have sizable roles this season – Lynn is the female lead in Saijaku, Sarah the female lead in Haruchika, Mark is Lev in Haikyuu. We’ve also got Kimura Subaru who is already a star in Doraemon. Will definitely be interesting to watch their progress, and that of other halfs in the future.\n\n7.The guys: Oh yeah this is hard. These guys really come from nowhere sometimes, and as mentioned in the third article there are some who get hot from doing mobage and I’m all ??? when it comes to those. I’ll just throw some potential names out there now so let’s see how they’ve done by year-end: Hatanaka Tasuku (KenPro), Amasaki Kohei (I’m), Yashiro Taku (Vims), Uemura Yuto (Himawari). I consider people like Uchida Yuuma, Kawanishi Kengo and Murata Taishi as having ‘made it’ already.\n\n8.The other girls: Thinking purely in terms of voice acting roles – there’s Kito Akari (Pro-Fit). I’d like to see Tanezaki Atsumi get more roles. Yamamura Hibiku might be getting a break, as is Fukuhara Ayaka (beyond Imas). There’s the Macross girl Suzuki Minori. I like Tomita Miyu and Waki Azumi from Galko-chan and uhh…I don’t know. I’m actually really bad at remembering the younger girls and wouldn’t know a potential star until she hit me in the face; there are just too many of them and they all sound the same….only Yoshida Yuri’s voice is super distinct to me (sweat drop;;;)\n\nPt.2 of her Nichinare interview. Read Pt.1 here.\n\nQ: Please tell us why you wanted to become a seiyuu.\n\nA: First of all – back when I was in junior high, I took part in a campaign to promote non-smoking and my group did shout-outs on the street. We’d each say a word, one by one, and as I said my part there was a bit of commotion amongst the crowd. Someone said to me, “Your voice is amazing”. My classmates always imitated the way I spoke when I answered teachers’ questions and that made me wonder if my voice was something that was unusual.\n\nSecondly, I loved listening to radio shows that seiyuu appeared on – the ‘gap’ between their normal and acting voices surprised me. They could be so articulate on the radio yet play gentle, cute characters on screen. I was impressed, thinking “Seiyuu are amazing! So cool!” and though I was unsure whether I could be a seiyuu myself, I thought that I would just try my best and aim towards becoming one.\n\nQ: Did you often watch anime?\n\nA: In those days, I used to watch the shows that were being broadcast in the evening or at night such as ONE PIECE, Naruto and Detective Conan together with my family. I gradually became more interested in anime from then onwards.\n\nQ: When did you actually start taking action in your bid to become a seiyuu?\n\nA: When I was in my 2nd year of high school I enrolled in the Nagoya branch of Nichinare. I’d already looked up voice training schools in my 1st year and had my heart set on Nichinare. I was thinking that I would enrol when I was less busy with club activities. However, due to my horrible tendency to be overly laidback, I missed the deadline for signing up for trial lessons (laughs). Thus in the following year, I signed up right at the start of the application period.\n\nQ: It’s still remarkable that you had already planned to enter Nichinare by your first year of high school. Why did you choose Nichinare?\n\nA: Because classes were only held once a week, so I could attend it while still schooling.\n\nQ: Did you take up the free trial lesson prior to enrolling?\n\nA: Yes! I had absolutely no acting experience in plays or anything; I’d never even raised my voice before so it was an eye-opener for me. My fellow participants were already familiar with voice projection and had acted before. I got worried, wondering “can I really do this?”\n\nQ: How did your family react to your desire to enrol in Nichinare?\n\nA: I hadn’t even taken a single (acting) lesson up ‘til then, so I never actually talked to them about wanting to enrol. When I eventually discussed it with them, they were OK with it and said “Go ahead and try it out”.\n\nQ: What were your thoughts and impressions of Nichinare once you were actually enrolled?\n\nA: I got a bit of a culture shock, just like when I went for the free trial lesson – each of my classmates seemed to have a really huge presence (laughs). It was all I could do to keep up with the lecturers, as well as the rest of my class.\n\nQ: What sort of classes did you take in Nichinare?\n\nA: For the first year it was all basics – the foundations of vocalization, abdominal breathing, etudes. I had to learn first of all, to express myself in a commanding voice without getting embarrassed. Since classes were only once a week I’d practice what I’d learnt at home, as well as do the Nichinare-style of stretching..in my room and in the bath. It’d be embarrassing doing that in front of my parents (laughs).\n\nQ: What exactly is Nichinare-style stretching?\n\nA: They’re actually yoga-style stretches and it’s painful to do them properly. You’ll break into a sweat even doing it briefly. I think it’s beneficial to do not just as a seiyuu, but for health maintenance as well. I feel like it’s helped made my body more flexible…though I haven’t been doing it recently, so I’m probably back to being stiff (laughs).\n\nQ: Did you advance steadily through the regular course in your second year?\n\nA: To tell the truth, I thought it would be impossible for me to progress on to the regular course so I had told my mom, “Just let me do this, even if it’s for 1 year”. I knew it wasn’t going to be easy to become a seiyuu and on top of that I was a very shy person, so I took the lessons with the hope of curing my shyness. I was surprised that someone like me could advance to the regular course…though of course, I did feel strongly about wanting to become a seiyuu.\n\nQ: What did you learn on the regular course?\n\nA: There were formal lessons on acting and voice acting, recitals using scripts and dialogue recitations. As an example, there was a lesson where we had to, create and act out a story within 1 minute & 30 seconds, based on the lyrics of your favourite song. There were many new experiences for me and I had great fun thinking about them. “Just what kind of lessons will I have next week?” or “I wonder what we’ll do next time?” – I was really looking forward to it. I recall that it was during my time in the regular courses that I stopped being nervous about speaking in public. I was able to talk to people while looking them in the eye; I think I grew up a bit from my time in the basic course.\n\nQ: What were the circumstances that led to you joining your (current) agency?\n\nA: Actually, as the affiliation auditions were carried out at the same time as the promotion examinations, I did not only advance to the regular course but also passed the I’m Enterprise admission tests. It was just an unbelievable thing to happen – while wondering, “What the heck should I do now!?”, my parents gave me the push on the back I needed, saying “Since you’ve already gotten the chance to join the agency, you might as well just give it your best shot and see what happens”.\n\nQ: It’s amazing that you got signed up by an agency so quickly!\n\nA: After my attachment to the agency was confirmed, one of the staff members said to me “You’re still in high school so you should prioritize your education for now” and I was very grateful for those warm words. If I had not been admitted into the agency, I was thinking of going on to a local college so I was happy to have my career path decided early on. My parents did say to me that they hoped that I could get something to fall back on as well, so for the 1 year after I graduated high school I went to a vocational school to acquire a professional qualification. I was staying in a dorm during that period and it was tough to have curfews. Whenever I had jobs come up, I was always afraid that I wouldn’t make it back in time before the doors closed.\n\nQ: You’re still attending training programmes right now even as you’re working in the field. What sort of lessons are you taking?\n\nA: In the week leading up to this feature, I was mostly doing dialogue work similar to what you hear on drama CDs while this week, I’ll be working on afureko lessons. The content of the lessons represents a step up for me – some of my classmates who I’m studying with have already started working in the field and there are some others who are really talented as well, so it’s a great opportunity for me to learn. In the studio, you’d always feel a bit tense for fear of messing up but in lessons there are no such worries and I have fun going all out and challenging myself.\n\nQ: Incidentally, your début anime was as one of the main characters, Theiamillis Gre Fortorthe in Rokujoma no Shinryakusha!?.\n\nA: It was the 2nd ever audition that I had taken, during the gap between my advancement from the basic to the regular course – it was actually my first time auditioning in a studio. What’s more, it was the first time in my life standing in front of a mic; I was so nervous!\n\nQ: Who would’ve expected a home run right off the bat! What was your reaction when you found out that you would be making your debut?\n\nA: I was shocked, thinking “It’s a miracle!”. When I relayed the news to my parents they were both surprised and very happy. The studio recording represented one of many firsts for me as well, so I was nothing but a bundle of nerves. Every week (in the studio) was an opportunity to learn for me and taking on the advice I got from everyone there, I gave my absolute best in voicing Tia.\n\nQ: What did you learn in your time at Nichinare that was helpful, and that you still utilize in your work now?\n\nA: Everything I learned has been of use! What left the biggest impression though, was what I was taught by Sakamoto Chika-san, to be conscious about wanting to try out various things. Don’t just try to keep things normal and stay in your safety zone; when the chance to do something interesting comes up, do it – I always have these thoughts in mind when it comes to decision-making when I’m on the job.\n\nQ: What do you think are the merits and the attractions of a place like Nichinare?\n\nA: First of all, the variety of courses available allows people to learn at their own pace based on their own situations, whether you are a student or are working. Also, there are 10 schools located throughout the country so it’s great to be able to easily attend one that is near where you live. You get to learn together with people who are highly knowledgeable and share advice, helping each other to grow while strengthening your bonds. The friends I made from my time spent in the lessons remain treasures to me. I believe that you too, will surely meet such great companions.\n\nQ: What are your future goals as a seiyuu?\n\nA: I want to voice mascot characters. Being a mascot character means you can cheer along (for whatever it is that you’re a mascot for) as well as be much loved by many people regardless of age, for a long time. Also, I’d like to try out the type of characters that are on charge of giving the explanations in shows. I’m not 100% confident in my ability to recite (lengthy) lines smoothly yet, but such roles require the actor to speak clearly in a voice that can easily be transmitted to listeners; if I could have such a role it’d help me to improve my line recitations. Right now, I’m having a lot of fun meeting the new characters I voice with each new show I work on, so I’ll focus on giving my best for each and every job I get.\n\nQ: Lastly, please give some advice and a message to those who are aiming to become seiyuu.\n\nA: Nichinare is a place where many seniors have gone on to achieve great success and that is the proof of the effectiveness of its lessons and its achievements. Also, it is a place that allows those who are like me and do not live in Tokyo, yet desire to become seiyuu, to easily learn. I was able to début while still studying (at Nichinare) so do not give up and take on the challenge. For those who are interested in Nichinare, just request for information and sign up for that free trial lesson. Take action as soon as you think of doing something! That’s advice from me, based on my own experiences (laughs). I myself am just a fresh, new rookie so for all my future roles and works, I will use what I have learned in Nichinare in order to further grow. Let’s do our best together!\n\nName: Kanemoto Hisako (金元 寿子)\n\nDoB: 16 December 1987\n\nHometown: Kurashiki, Okayama\n\nAgency: Production Baobab\n\nSNS: Blog\n\nKanemoto, nicknamed Hii-chan, originally joined an affiliate company of Production Baobab in 2008 before winning a public audition for the Sword World 2.0 Tanodan table-top RPG. From 2009, she joined the Baobab main agency and made her debut in Sora no Manimani using the stage name Aikawa Juri, before switching back to her real name later that year. By the following year she was landing lead roles in So.Ra.No.Wo.To and Shinryaku! Ika-musume and she also won a Best Female Newcomer award at the 5th Seiyuu Awards.\n\nIn 2012 however, Kanemoto was implicated by netizens for her role in the Kokoro Connect bullying incident and her public image took a bit of a beating. After issuing a public apology, she kept her head down and continued to work hard and the upshot is that her career has survived pretty much unscathed. Some of her recent high-profile works includes Gundam Iron-Blooded Orphans, the Durarara!! Series, Assassination Classroom and the Sailor Moon reboot.\n\nHii-chan is the 100th seiyuu to feature in Da Vinci’s 声優図鑑 feature.\n\nQ: You’ve been cast in a lot of works but first of all, allow us to ask us about your currently airing anime. What kind of girl is Atra, the character you voice in Mobile Suit Gundam Iron-Blooded Orphans, which has been airing since last October?\n\nA: There are a lot of scenes in the show featuring conversations about life in general; in the midst of that is (Atra), a warm, gentle child who never lets the heavy atmosphere burden her. She may be young but she tries extremely hard to be a pillar of support for everyone – she’s a girl who is very strong at heart. I get a bit nervous during recording since she’s operating at a different pace compared to those around her (laughs) but that in itself, may be (one of) her strengths.\n\nQ: In Gate: Jieitai Kano Chi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri, you voice a character named Tuka. The 2nd cour is finally going on air – is there anything in particular people should look out for?\n\nA: Actually, there’s a really important scene that will show how Tuka overcomes a certain incident. It’s a powerful scene so please look forward to it.\n\nQ: You have voiced a variety of roles up until this point – which one of your works did you see as being a turning point?\n\nA: I’d say So.Ra.No.Wo.To (2010), the show in which I voiced my first ever leading part. The role of Kanata was the start of my life as a seiyuu. I think it’s fair to say that without So.Ra.No.Wo.To, I wouldn’t have gotten anywhere. There was work in front of the camera, there were interviews. It also gave me my first opportunity to sing a chara song – really, it was this show that brought me to the realization that seiyuu work is in reality, different to what I had imagined it to be – it wasn’t enough to be merely good at acting, you had to be able to do a lot of other things as well (laughs). Thanks to So.Ra.No.Wo.To, I started getting more chances to work on anime and a lot of aspects [of my life] changed.\n\nQ: What was your original reason for wanting to become a seiyuu?\n\nA: I only decided upon it during my third year of high school, when it was time for us to choose our career paths. I was relatively late in making my decision, compared to other people. I loved anime and foreign dramas so I had a bit of interest in the seiyuu profession but I was aware that I was really bad at speaking.\n\nQ: That doesn’t seem so apparent now.\n\nA: I was a lot worse at it back then (laughs). What’s more, I was a shy person and had a tendency to hesitate in everything. But my desire to take up voice acting studies grew stronger, and I enrolled in a vocational school in Kobe. That means that I only started acting once I was in training school.\n\nQ: Were there any shows that influenced you in the times before you became a seiyuu? I hear that you liked Hikaru no Go?\n\nA: I think that I was mostly influenced by the kind of shows aimed at kids that aired in the evening slots. Anime that I really love include Turn A Gundam and Sherlock Hound. I really love the music in Turn A Gundam composed by Kanno Yoko-san, that was the first time I felt compelled to chase after anime music (laughs). I used to record music on Mini Discs to listen to in those days.\n\nQ: So you became interested in anisong from that time as well?\n\nA: That’s right. It made me start to think “Wow, anisong is cool~”. I really loved those theme songs from battle girls’ anime like Magic Knight Rayearth as well. I think it was my love for such things that over time, gradually developed into an interest in seiyuu work.\n\nQ: Having gone through such experiences, what were your impressions of actually singing a character song for So.Ra.No.Wo.To?\n\nA: For So.Ra.No.Wo.To, I just sang normally in my natural voice. It was to be my first time singing on record, so before I received any information about the recording, I went along to karaoke with some of the staff members and performed a couple of tunes in front of them. I was insanely nervous (laughs). So yeah there was that, and the finished chara song ended up sounding quite natural. One song that I was really conscious of singing in character for was for Shinryaku! Ika-musume (2010), The lyrics featured all her speech nuances, plus it was my first time performing a musical interlude.\n\nQ: Your character’s voice in Shinryaku! Ika-musume left quite the impression!\n\nA: As it was a role that involved quickly switching between her ‘laughing’ and ‘angry’ modes, I found it a bit of a challenge back then. Also, after you’ve spent some time away from the role it can be slightly difficult to click into gear once again. But I remember watching my seniors and being amazed at how they weren’t fazed by that. Ika-musume was a pretty powerful work and the characters had great impact as well and to me, it’s an established title. If the opportunity ever arises, I’d like to reprise the role (laughs).\n\nQ: I’ll definitely have to check that out when it happens! (laughs) You’ve appeared in numerous other interesting shows apart from that so I’m thinking that you do find acting fun after all, don’t you?\n\nA: To tell the truth, I’m always thinking that acting is a tough job (laughs). Of course acting has its fun aspects but there is no ‘right answer’ so trying to tackle the question seriously would be hard. What I find the most fun is when I’m engaging in dialogue with other people. However, there are always challenges in front of me – just when I think I’ve cleared one hurdle, there’s always another one waiting ahead. I don’t think I’ll ever successfully eliminate all these obstacles (laughs).\n\nQ: Last year, you released a private album titled Fantastic Voyage. What did you learn from the process of making the record?\n\nA: As it was a memorial album, I was happy to be able to sing songs that I liked and to decide on what kind of mood I wanted for it. I’m originally from Okayama Prefecture so there’s a song included that introduces Okayama. Thanks to this album, I was able to hold an independent event in my hometown in Okayama. I felt that there was a ‘connection’ there, so to speak.\n\nQ: This is the independent event that was held on 6th December 2015 in Okayama, right?\n\nA: I serve as the ‘Ambassador of the Sunny Nation of Okayama’ so I had been thinking about doing something in Okayama.I had a desire to try organizing an event so alongside my older sister who works as a manicurist in our hometown, I made the decision to hold an event.\n\nQ: Did you get any feedback on your first independent event?\n\nA: The intention was to showcase songs from my private album and I had always wanted to give something back to my fans, so I had thought that it’d be great if such an event could bring cheer to others. I came up with everything from the planning to the actual execution and in the process, I got to learn how each step was difficult in its own way (laughs).\n\nQ: You have a good relationship with your older sister. What do you like about her?\n\nA: The fact that she can really knuckle down and work. She has big aspirations and moved to Tokyo to acquire her manicurist qualifications as well as personally go around various stores to receive training – it’s something to admire. She’s also the kind of person who states her opinions clearly so we do end up fighting sometimes (laughs). I like that about her too. When we went to Taiwan for a New Year’s holiday together 2 years ago, we got into a fight as well (laughs).\n\nQ: Any reason for the fight!? (laughs)\n\nA: One of the stores that my sister trained at before has a branch in Taiwan so she asked me to accompany her for a visit. Yet, on the day that we went to the store, we found out that it was shut. “Why didn’t you do your homework first, have we come all the way to Taiwan for this!?” (laughs). But we did make up on our way home and it was on that trip that we first talked about holding an event in Okayama.\n\nQ: I see, so that was how it flowed. Did you always use to hang out with your sister?\n\nA: I’ve always followed my sister around – I used to hang out and have fun with her and her friends. Whenever she took something up, I’d want to do it too, so I ended up going for abacus, swimming lessons and conversational English classes. But all I was doing was just imitating her so I didn’t last long at any of them (laughs).\n\nQ: I have this image of you having many friends in the seiyuu world – who have you been hanging out with lately?\n\nA: We hadn’t seen each other in a while but recently, 4 of us – me, Kayano Ai-san, Akasaki Chinatsu-san and Tamura Mutsumi-san managed to get together for a yakiniku meal. Before that, the same 4 people went to visit a beer garden in the summer – we arrange regular meet-ups to chat about all kinds of things.\n\nQ: Who’s the mood-maker in the group?\n\nA: Akasaki-san and Tamura-san are the lively ones. They’re the proactive type, initiating plans and deciding where we should go. Kayano-san would be the one who expertly keeps track of all those plans.\n\nQ: You celebrated your birthday last December 16 – were there any happy celebrations?\n\nA: I celebrated the milestone with friends but also, there was a surprise cake prepared for me during my personal event. I was supposed to have arranged the entire proceedings by myself but my sister made her own adjustments (laughs). I was really happy to hear everyone at the venue singing Happy Birthday to me.\n\nQ: What an amazing sister (laughs). Do you have any recent horror stories to tell!?\n\nA: Loads, but most of my horror stories occur when I’m in the kitchen. I don’t do much housework but when I do, I always mess up. Boiling stuff ‘til it spills over, foodstill raw when it’s served up, stuff like that (laughs). It’d all go well if only I looked at the recipe, but I like to cook by relying on my senses. Eating my own cooking gives me stomach woes so I recently resolved never to cook again (laughs).\n\nQ: Thank you for that valuable information (laughs). Your range of work has become broader – is there anything in particular that you’d like to take on the challenge of in the future?\n\nA: I haven’t done too much film dubbing work so I’d like to try out more of that. I’ve always loved foreign dramas. I’d also like to act on stage. I’ve only ever done that once and I found it very interesting to be able to perform on stage in such close proximity to your acting partner as well as the audience. As it was my first experience of the stage there were lots of things that I wasn’t yet able to do, so I’d like another chance to spear on stage in the future.\n\nQ: Have there been any issues that have come up for you with regards to acting?\n\nA: Up ‘til this point I’d mostly been playing innocent, straightforward young characters but lately I’ve had more chances to voice adults. It’s a new task for me; to solidify my acting foundations so that I can firmly capture the complex emotions (behind these characters). It’s interesting to be able to learn more about the human senses. For example, mothers who are walking on the streets will treat their children in totally different ways. I’d like to explore these differences and the psychology behind their words.\n\nQ: What advice do you have for people hoping to become seiyuu?\n\nA: I only realized the depth of this job once I had started working as a seiyuu but I think that nowadays, people can learn more about the profession through the net and media. If you’re aiming to become a seiyuu, I believe you should consider carefully whether you want to focus on acting or dubbing – having a clear idea of the direction you wish to take will help to lead you to the right path.\n\nQ: Finally, please leave a message for the readers.\n\nA: The reason I can continue working as a seiyuu is because of the existence of the (anime) works and the characters and for that, I am very grateful. From now on, I will give my best so that I can enjoy my work the same way all of you do – thank you for your support.\n\n———————————————————————–\n\nIt’s been interesting to watch Hii-chan throughout the years – she was a fairly awkward-looking kid when she first started out with So.Ra.No.Wo.To but has really blossomed into a lovely young lady of late! I enjoyed her work on Junketsu no Maria (Maria) and SHIROBAKO (Suzuki Kyoko/Aria) as well, hopefully she continues to get a good balance of cute and serious roles in the future.\n\nName: Wakamoto Norio (若本 規夫)\n\nDoB: 18 October 1945\n\nHometown: Born in Shimonoseki, Yamaguchi, raised in Sakai, Osaka\n\nAgency: Sigma Seven\n\nI don’t suppose Wakamoto-san needs any kind of introduction. He’s got a very distinct style as well as strong character – cocky even, if you want to put it that way. But you’d give him a free pass for that – he’s earned his dues for sure in his 40+ years of good work.\n\nThis is his Seiyuu Road.\n\nPt 1. No need to compare yourself with others, just aim to be the best you can be\n\nTaking on the challenge of a nationwide audition that I saw in the newspaper!!\n\nIt’s not like I ever “wanted to become a seiyuu”… After graduating from university ¹, I worked at what I’d consider as being ‘rigid jobs’ – two of them in fact, but I had always thought that those kinds of jobs, where you’re just a part of the overall process in an organization, did not suit my personality. I wondered if there was any job out there that would allow me to utilize my own talents. Just then, I chanced upon an article smack in the middle of the local news page in the paper with the headline ‘Kurosawa Ryo² Establishes Voice Dubbing Academy’.\n\nBack then, Kurosawa Ryo-san was known as the dub voice of Gary Cooper and also did a lot of CM work – he was a leading figure in the seiyuu world. At the time there were only about 100 or 150 seiyuu actively doing voice work… the industry as a whole, probably thought that ‘it was time to inject fresh blood’. Regardless, it was surprising to see such an article appear in the paper.\n\nHaving read the article, I paid up the application fee and went along to the venue on the day of the audition. I saw young people from all over the country there, where screening had already started in the morning. I was 25 years old then, surrounded by people who were mostly younger than me. I arrived at 2pm and when I asked “how many people have been selected?”, the answer came back “20”. I was entrant number 380 or so? I thought to myself “What the heck do I do now?” and was contemplating quitting on the spot but I’d already paid the 5,000yen fee so I ended up taking the test to see what would happen.\n\nWhen my turn came, I was passed a document and asked, “Please read this”. I hadn’t a clue what I was doing but I thought I’d just read it in a cheerful, pleasant voice. I sounded really wooden though. Why’s everyone else so good! Maybe they were all members of acting troupes or something. After I was done, there was a Q & A session and one of the examinees sitting in the middle – a balding guy of around 50, repeatedly asked me “This school’s classes are on Monday, Wednesday, Friday in the daytime – can you make it at those times?” so I just answered “Yeah I’ll go if I pass”, and that was the end of my audition.\n\nI was sure that I’d failed the audition and had given up on it already, but I got an acceptance letter some 10 days later. When I went for my first lesson, the guy with the thinning hair came in with a smile on his face saying, “I’m Nakano Kanji”. I only found out later on that Nakano-san was one of the main directors of Tohokushinsha³ and it was because of him that I scraped through the auditions.\n\nAs long as you’re competent, you can be a seiyuu who ‘works on your own’\n\nSo under such circumstances, I ended up attending Kurosawa Ryo-san’s dubbing classes for a year. The number of seiyuu during those times were few, so we would get bits of work in between our training lessons. Rookies were paid cheaply so I guess that’s why we’d get hired. At the time, the guarantees were around 3,000 yen for a 30-minute show, 3,600yen for a 60-minute show. For a feature-length you’d be paid…4,800yen or so. It’d be crazy if those rates were still the same today. I had no idea what other people made but I don’t think my seniors earned all that much more than what I did.\n\nMost of the work available at the time involved dubbing foreign works. There weren’t that many anime productions either…maybe only things like Sazae-san and Tetsujin 28-gou. Right within the first 2-3 years after I turned pro, a show called Brave Raideen went on air with Kamiya Akira-san making a splash in the leading role. It was only then that anime programmes started becoming prominent…\n\nI couldn’t understand a single thing about acting when I first started out; from a director’s perspective my acting probably seemed totally incoherent. Obviously I kept on messing stuff up. I guess you could say that in a sense, I’ve struggled a lot. Still, the seiyuu profession is one that ‘you do on your own’, you don’t have to ‘get along’ with anyone else, and I think that’s something good. What I mean by that is as long as you improve your skills in front of the mic, you can fulfill your work using your own powers. That’s not something that’s necessarily true for actors… seiyuu are similar to singers in that sense. I don’t think it’s an unusual job though. I made the decision to to this, a job that you can do ‘on your own’.\n\nThere might be some of you reading this who’ll think “nah, that can’t be right”. You’ve got other actors, plus the director’s there – you’re working with all these guys. But you know, as a seiyuu you don’t have to worry about the presence of other people. There’s no need to compare yourself to others…just aim to be the best you can be. Being a seiyuu allowed me to realize the truth in that. Nowadays, I can act the way I want to. I think that comes across most clearly in my narration work.\n\nObviously I do take on board the directions I’m given and of course, it’s a given that I practise common courtesy for things like greetings and farewells. But when it comes to work I just let it flow. To me, that is the most interesting thing (about this job), as well as the biggest attraction. Going to work gives me a true sense of freedom. When I go to work alone and hear things like “How do you want this to go?”, I’ll say “Hmm, let’s try this. Or that,” and go ahead and do it. Anime and narration work then becomes something that I can freely leave my own imprint upon. Having said all that about doing stuff arbitrarily, it would all amount to nothing if you don’t possess the skills necessary to be a seiyuu. When incompetent people do things of their own selfish accord, you could be thrown out in a flash. But if you gradually raise your acting levels, you’ll come to a point where you’re able to fight your corner. Reaching that level of competence takes maybe…10 or 20 years? Hmm, maybe even 30 years? If you’ve stuck around for that long, your capacity will have widened and you’ll be able to put in more of yourself into your work.\n\nOver the course of my first 10 years in the business, I started to gradually realize that ‘seiyuu work is something that you can go pretty deeply into’. However, I didn’t have the necessary skills back then and wasn’t able to fulfil the production team’s requests. For me, it was an exasperating experience and I was frustrated by my own ineptitude. Nowadays, I can say that I almost infallibly come out of the studio 100% satisfied. Especially when it comes to narration work… I know that just by looking at the faces of the production staff. After all, they accompany me all the way to the elevator, line up and wave goodbye as I leave the studio (laughs).\n\n¹: Wakamoto graduated from Waseda University, majoring in law\n\n²: The late Kurosawa Ryo was an actor & seiyuu who managed his own talent agency, named after him\n\n³: Tohokushinsha Film Corp\n\nPt 2. Turning 50, I finally found satisfaction in my work\n\nAlmost coming to blows over the mics!! …the studio used to be a violent place\n\nStudios used to be places where proper hierarchy existed. Protagonists, antagonists, supporting characters – that was the structure from top to bottom; the classifications were a lot clearer then than they are now. Even when you went out for drinks after recordings, people would sit in their respective hierarchical groups. Me? Of course I had the worst seats.\n\nNone of us had any money so we’d go to cheap places; they used to serve a lot of ‘cheap sake’ of questionable quality that you’d easily get drunk on. At first we’d be drinking in a good mood but after 30 minutes the polite compliments from our seniors would stop and we’d start getting into fights – “Oi! What the hell is up with your acting” or “You mean me? I should be the one asking you that”. Things would start off in harmony before ending in carnage (laughs). I have to say though, that I do like how ‘human’ it made the (seiyuu) world seem…\n\nWhen things like that happened, we’d get preached at by our seniors… Also, directors and producers would sometimes turn up at these drinking parties. When they did, people would split into groups or ‘families’ and that made it hard for others to join in..that uncomfortable atmosphere spread to the recording studio as well. What a strange industry it used to be…\n\nAnyway, the studio is a battlefield…or it used to be in those days. There were only 3 or so mics and there was even a hierarchy when it came to that; you’d get seniors who’d deliberately block rookie seiyuu from moving into the mic.. Us rookies were desperate so there wasn’t much we could do but just say our lines over the shoulders of the seniors. Of course, such things don’t happen these days. Since everyone is so smart and well-mannered…\n\nStill, people are so well-behaved nowadays that there is no friendly rivalry. I used to look at my seniors and think, “This bastard! I’ll definitely get back at him in 4-5 years, and I’ll get him good”. Obviously I wasn’t hellbent on revenge or anything like that, it was more a case of strongly feeling that “Watch out. I’m definitely gonna beat you”. Anyhow, most of the work available during my rookie days was for dubbing foreign films – Westerns and war movies in particular. So yeah, they were action-packed shows and the studio wasn’t really a place for women back then. There were guys who’d elbow people in the confusion caused by the scrambling over mics (laughs). If you didn’t get physical as well, you’d end up getting crushed by everyone else.\n\nThanks to a certain situation, I imposed a ‘crazy training method’ upon myself\n\nMy debut show was Kurosawa Ryo-san’s The FBI. I’d be asked to come along to the studio to voice bitparts like ‘Criminal 1’ from time to time, and that was how I got my start. The director at the time was Nakano Kanji-san. He’s the one who gave me that push in my first audition. From then on I kept on working and one of those shows made around 1980, The Professionals, represented a turning point for me. It was an action series so I was given a license to go wild with the role – I got really hooked on the character; it was a memorable experience.\n\nAs for anime, the turning point for me came with Gunbuster!. I played Ota Koichiro, a character who was in charge of training the girls (in the show) to fight space aliens. Legend of the Galactic Heroes too. Up ‘til that point I didn’t have that many major roles in anime, and it was only in the ‘80s that I started to feel like I was gradually bringing out more of myself in my roles.\n\nBut still, I sucked… nowadays, I can’t bear to watch any of my shows from those times, I was so bad. I only started being satisfied with my (own) work when I was in my 50s. I was around 55 or 56 when I first thought “I can do this job for life”.\n\nThere was a point in time when all of a sudden, the job offers started drying up. I wasn’t seeing any work coming in apart from my regular shows and I was thinking “What’s going on now?”. I started to listen back to everything I’d worked on, one after the other. It was then I realized I had not been fulfilling requests made by the production side.\n\nIn the wake of that, I worked from the ground up to ‘train as a seiyuu’. I had only been doing half-hearted training ‘til then so it was only in my 50s that I started to go through some ‘crazy training methods’ – a revolutionary kind of training… Basically, I started popping up all over the place. People would say, “There’s a guy there who can teach you this or that”, and I’d be there right away.\n\nI tried out so many things, the list is endless. The Nishino Breathing Method, voice training – I did that. Koshinto chanting too. There’s a breathing technique specific to koshinto chanting. The ‘voice’ is something that comes from the ‘body’, so you must train the body as well. If your respiratory muscles are not flexible you cannot produce a ‘good voice’, and you cannot meet the staff’s demands. To be able to freely control your voice, you need to maintain a breathing rate that allows you to read around 5 lines worth of speech within one breath, while still maintaining intonation. When you’re able to manipulate your voice well, the number of roles you do will increase manifold.\n\nThere are some training methods that I did for 3 or 5 years, and others that went on for more than 10 years. There’s this guy who’s considered the father of street performance, called Kubota Hisashi. When I was researching discourse on ‘jibeta’, I read one of his books and it said ‘call up anyone you feel interested in’. So I called him up and he said to me ‘I’ve got a practice session on Sunday, come along’, and that is how I came to know him.\n\nI spent 5 years there and what I learnt there was the basis for what is now the Wakamoto style of discourse… Kubota-san was a master teacher. His speech was exquisite and it still aids me to this day in my narration work. I’d like to think that there isn’t anyone like me out there who ignores all the common theories when it comes to narration. In this world, only Wakamoto does it (laughs). When I’m narrating, I’m speaking directly to the viewer on the other side of the screen. In other words, I aim to penetrate the viewer’s heart… These days, there are very few people who do ad-libs; much less people who do ad-libs during narration. Sometimes, I even change the script from the ground up… and the scriptwriter will end up saying “I have no idea which part you’re doing right now” (laughs).\n\nPt 3. By exploring what you ‘need’ and piling up training, you could open up your own ‘Seiyuu Road’\n\nNo matter what work it is, ‘competition’ is important\n\nWhen you’re doing your lines in the recording studio, you often get people who say ‘there’s too much (time)..” or “I don’t have enough time to say my lines…” – I think it’s weird. That kind of work [timing lines to the mouth movements] is part of a seiyuu’s job. The deletion of parts is my responsibility after all. It’s only when you can do things like this that you can call yourself a pro. If you can’t even take care of something like that then you’re at a semi-pro level… For people who think, “It’ll be bad if I take liberties with this”, they’ll never ever be able to put on performances that break the fourth wall ‘til the end of time.\n\nI actually expected some of my juniors to be biting at my heels and asking me to watch over their performances, but they don’t come to me at all (laughs). Everyone’s seen as a ‘good kid’ nowadays so there’s no need for them to compete with others. I wonder if all they can think about is ‘doing as the director says’ and ‘being afraid of getting cut loose if I say something unnecessary’… Regardless, these days I increasingly recommend young people to be more forceful when it comes to issues regarding performance…A good piece of work can be borne out of constant clashes with another. I used to battle with my seniors in the past as well. For example – on Lupin 3, Yamada Yasuo-san and Naya Goro-san were pissed off to see that only the line drawings¹ were ready during recording – “How the hell can you make a good show if you can’t even get the visuals done?” and they stormed off home (laughs). I’ve learned to have such opinions too, even if there are clients present during recordings for commercials. By pushing the boundaries, you can go deeper and make your work all that more convincing. Isn’t it something that rings true though, no matter what industry you work in? Carrying out a task perfunctorily will result in work that is merely ‘one dimensional’. If you’re going to act, put in a performance that gets the blood pumping!\n\nThe seiyuu road is a road of beasts. It’s a path you have to open up on your own\n\nThis is true for everyone – even you who is reading this: everyone has a voice, and anyone can speak Japanese. So you might be thinking that with mere effort…, “I can read lines and do narration”, or “I can be a seiyuu”, but there can be huge pitfalls. Even if you’re lucky enough to get into an agency, there are some people who don’t even get a single job offer. Perhaps you’re just not seen as being useful. So what is it that you require? First of all, you need to ‘build the body of a seiyuu’. Once you’ve got that, clients will be interested in you and work offers will start coming in. To get to that level, it’s important to go through daily training.\n\nVoice training methods usually involve singing songs for all ages and cultures, accompanied by guitar etc.. It’s an effective way to train your voice.. there are also other creative, personal ways to ‘train one’s voice while building up the body’, and you should build up all this training on a daily basis.\n\nGraduating from voice training school, entering a production agency, rubbing shoulders with other actors – it’s like going down the road in a bus. Everyone’s taking the same route so it can’t be that scary… If you truly believe that you are meant to survive in this world, you’ll have to get off that bus alone somewhere along the way or you’ll never make it to the top. Were everyone to do everything in the same way, you yourself would only make it as far as all the others do. If by chance you possess that little extra bit of quality, you might make it to the 6th station²…but you’ll never go beyond.\n\nThat’s why, if there really is such a thing as a ‘Seiyuu Road’, it would be one filled with beasts that you’d have to open up yourself with a machete…it would be a road of agony and take much hard labour just to open it up.\n\n“Once you arrive at the workplace, your job is done”.. that means, all you have to do after that is to draw from the many skills you’ve acquired to perform in front of the mic. Coming to the studio and stumbling about is gonna result in nothing but a pointless performance… There isn’t any definite way you could describe as being “The Seiyuu Road” – you just have to open it up for yourself.\n\nTake pride in saying that seiyuu are artists!\n\nI made requests to study under my predecessors in various fields and I really learned a lot. Briefly mentioning some of these – Rokyoku, Koshinto chanting breathing, Hida Shiki Kyoken Jutsu, vocal training, Kobudo-style body control techniques, street performance, Komuso shakuhachi breathing techniques, Kundalini yoga breathing techniques… Amongst the many other respiratory muscle training techniques and voice training methods…you should explore by yourself what exactly is needed for a seiyuu; choose what works for you and make it your own style.\n\nTo those of you aiming to become seiyuu in the future, after you learn what you ‘must’ do in training school, go forth, explore and discover what it is you ‘should’ do. That is all. There is plenty for you to do ‘in your own way’. The differences will show up in.. well, maybe 10 years. However, as those differences will become apparent at certain stages of the process, the people in the studio who hear (your voice) will know. They can definitely tell that you are a guy who’s walked the ‘road of beasts’.\n\nThe anime being made these days have amazing visuals, plus the stories develop at a good pace. At times I feel that seiyuu’s voices can barely catch up with the overwhelming power of what you see on the screen. I’d like to see the emergence of a seiyuu who can break the fourth wall, someone who can go wild. Don’t just be the ‘good kid’ and set free the ‘wild one’ that’s sleeping inside you…remember to train your voice diligently. After all, seiyuu are artists (creators of the new world)!! Since you’ve already gone through great pains to become a seiyuu, wouldn’t it be disappointing if you didn’t go on to be someone who could say ‘I’m an artist’ with pride?\n\nBon voyage!!\n\n¹: 線画 (senga)\n\n²: Reference to Mt.
