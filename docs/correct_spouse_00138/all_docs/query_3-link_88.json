Ono, Masayuki; Berkery, John; Bertelli, Nicola; Shiraiwa, Syunichi; Delgado-Aparicio, Luis; Menard, Jonathan; Sánchez-Villar, Álvaro; Shah, Kajal; Shevchenko, Vladimir; Idei, Hiroshi; Hanada, Kazuaki, Efficient ECCD non-inductive plasma current start-up, ramp-up, and sustainment for an ST fusion reactor, Nuclear fusion, 10.1088/1741-4326/ad556f, 64, Number 8, 2024.06, The elimination of the need for an Ohmic heating solenoid may be the most impactful design driver for the realization of economical compact fusion tokamak reactor systems. However, this would require fully non-inductive start-up and current ramp-up from zero plasma current and low electron temperature of sub-keV to the full plasma current of ∼10–15 MA at 20–30 keV electron temperature. To address this challenge, an efficient solenoid-free start-up and ramp-up scenario utilizing a low-field-side-launched extraordinary mode at the fundamental electron cyclotron harmonic frequency (X–I) is proposed, which has more than two orders of magnitude higher electron cyclotron current drive (ECCD) efficiency than the conventional ECCD for the sub-keV start-up regime. A time dependent model was developed to simulate the start-up scenarios. For the Spherical Tokamak Advanced Reactor (STAR) (Menard et al 2023 Next-Step Low-Aspect-Ratio Tokamak Design Studies (IAEA)), it was found that to fully non-inductively ramp-up to 15 MA, it would take about 25 MW of EC power at 170 GHz. Because of the relatively large plasma volume of STAR, radiation losses must be considered. It is important to make sure that high Z impurities are kept sufficiently low during the early current start-up phase where the temperature is sub-keV range. Since the initial current ramp up takes place at a factor of ten lower density compared to the sustained regimes, it is important to transition into a higher bootstrap fraction discharge at lower density to minimize the ECCD power requirement during the densification. For the sustainment phase an array of eight gyrotron launchers with a total of about 60 MW of fundamental O-mode was found to be sufficient to provide the required axis-peaked external current drive. High efficiencies between 19–57 kA MW−1 were found with optimal aiming, and these were resilient to small changes in aiming angles and density and temperature profiles.. 2.

The HW was installed summer 2014. Quantitative analysis pertaining to the HW at 373 K is carried out, and clarify the quantitative impact of shot history that obviously appears in wall stored hydrogen just before the discharge at the wall temperature. The model indicates the plasma-induced deposition layer play an essential role in fuel particle balance. A clear temperature dependence of fuel recycling was observed using outgassing just after plasma termination and played an essential role in regulation of particle balance. Consequently, long duration discharges lasting more than 1 h has been obtained at wall temperature, TW 34.

This concept is referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT), and predictive maintenance is a new valuable function associated with the IoT. In large-scale experimental facilities with many researchers, it is not desirable that experiments cannot be performed due to sudden failure of equipment. For this reason, it is important to predict the failure in advance based on the measurement results of sensors and to perform repairs in a planned manner. On the Q-shu University experiment with steady-state spherical tokamak (QUEST) large experimental device, it is necessary to drive a large current of 50 kA, and the diagnosis of its power line deterioration is well performed as predictive maintenance through the evaluation of its contact resistances of several micro ohms order on the network. In addition, as an example of the IoT, mechanisms to assist safe operation, such as a sound alarm system and an entrance management system, are built by sharing experimental information between devices via the network.. 40.

A sample can be exposed and extracted from the targeted plasma at any time using FESTA, however, when exposing the sample, the test chamber wall gets coated by some hydrogen as it is open to the QUEST vacuum vessel. We refer to this as the plasma-induced background. To measure the amount of hydrogen retained by the sample itself, the contribution from the plasma induced background must be subtracted from the measurements. To measure the accurate dynamic retention from plasma-exposed sample, a background subtraction model has been developed and tested. The initial testing shows that the FESTA system and model can estimate the dynamic hydrogen retention by a target test sample.. 42. Y. Hirooka, M. Ono, R. Maingi, K. Hanada, M. Kondo, J. Miyazawa, M.

Hatem Elserafy, Kazuaki Hanada, Shinichiro Kojima, Takumi Onchi, Ryuya Ikezoe, Kengoh Kuroda, Hiroshi Idei, Makoto Hasegawa, Ryota Yoneda, Masaharu Fukuyama, Arseniy Kuzmin, Aki Higashijima, Takahiro Nagata, Shoji Kawasaki, Shun Shimabukuro, Nicola Bertelli, Masayuki Ono, Electron Bernstein wave conversion of high-field side injected X-modes in QUEST, Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion, 10.1088/1361-6587/ab6903, 62, 3, 2020.01, This paper presents a detailed design of the Q-shu University experimental steady state spherical tokamak's (QUEST's) high-field side (HFS) injection system for electron Bernstein wave (EBW) excitation and the results of an experimental comparison of the HFS eXtraordinary X-mode and low-field side (LFS) ordinary O-mode injection of 8.2 GHz radio frequency (RF) power. Waveguides, as an alternative to mirror polarizers for transmitting RF X-mode power from LFS to HFS for EBW conversion, were used instead of the installation of an RF mirror. Testing of LFS-to-HFS RF power transmission at 8.2 GHz, using an RG-50-type vacuum waveguide in a bench-scale device filled with SF6 gas at 0.03 Mpa, revealed that an RF power of 10.8 kW could traverse the fundamental electron cyclotron resonance layer for 60 s without breakdown. The short-length, open-ended waveguide antenna used in the HFS injection-induced wave diffraction reduced the efficiency of power delivery to the upper hybrid resonance (UHR) by approximately 7% at an electron temperature of 50 eV. The HFS injection was able to produce brighter camera images than the standard LFS injection. The location of the UHR, as estimated by measuring the density with an interferometer, agreed with its location as measured by plasma radiation low-field, side-edge positions shown by fast camera imaging. This indicates that the plasma was produced by mode-converted EBW. The HFS injection had an absorption efficiency of 96%, compared to 40% for LFS. A greater fluctuation of floating potential adjustable to the lower hybrid wave (LHW) was observed in the HFS case by installing a Langmuir probe, confirming that EBW conversion efficiency was higher in the HFS case. Moreover, after setting the poloidal field to BPF = 7.6 mT, plasma current (IP ) in the HFS peaked at 1.3 kA, as opposed to 0.3 kA for LFS, despite LFS injection having a total power of 55 kW, compared to 40 kW for HFS. However, as the impurity level was comparatively high, it is believed that this IP is dominated by pressure-drive, which makes it difficult to analyze EBWCD. Finally, the line-integrated density in the HFS injection peaked at 1.6 × 1018 m-2, compared to 8 × 1017 m-2 in the LFS one.. 44. H. Idei, T. Onchi, K. Mishra, H. Zushi, T. Kariya, T. Imai, O.

Murakami, Electron heating of over-dense plasma with dual-frequency electron cyclotron waves in fully non-inductive plasma ramp-up on the QUEST spherical tokamak, Nuclear Fusion, 10.1088/1741-4326/ab4c12, 60, 1, 2020.01, A 28 GHz system with a high-power gyrotron tube has been used for the QUEST spherical tokamak to form an over-dense plasma for electron Bernstein wave (EBW) heating and current drive with an 8.2 GHz-wave. Non-inductive high-density plasma ramp-up experiments with dual-frequency (dual-f ) electron cyclotron (EC) (8.2 GHz and 28 GHz) waves were conducted. A spontaneous density jump (SDJ) to an over-dense state was first observed as a bifurcation phenomenon in the dual-f wave experiment. The over-dense plasma on the 8.2 GHz wave was non-inductively ramped up to 25 kA, and was maintained for 0.4 s under stable plasma equilibrium after two such jumps in one shot. Heating to mildly energetic electrons and bulk electrons was observed even in the over-dense region. The electrostatic EBW heating effect on the mildly energetic electrons in the over-dense region is assessed following a dispersion analysis of the 8.2 GHz wave. The bulk electron heating effect observed is explained as heat exchange from mildly energetic electrons heated by the electrostatic EBW. Remarkably, a high hard-x-ray-radiation temperature of ∼500 keV was also observed in tangential viewing for current-carrying electrons in the over-dense core region. Synergetic heating from the overlap of different 28 GHz EC harmonic resonances as well as higher harmonic heating is discussed for maintaining the highly energetic electrons in the over-dense core region. In addition, the SDJ process and mechanism are considered based on the discussion of the electron heating effects with the 8.2 GHz wave.. 45. East Team, Y. K. Liu, N. Hamada, K. Hanada, X. Gao, H. Q.

Jabir Al Salami, Changhong Hu, Kazuaki Hanada, A study on smoothed particle hydrodynamics for liquid metal flow simulation, Evergreen, 6, 3, 190-199, 2019.09, In order to address the problem of heat and particle removal in tokamak-type, magnetic confinement nuclear fusion reactors, a divertor that utilizes liquid metal is suggested to replace solid tungsten divertors due to concerns regarding their structural integrity at high energy fluxes. The operation of such a device gives rise to phenomena spanning multiple disciplines of physics such as fluid dynamics, electromagnetics, thermodynamics and plasma physics. Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is a Lagrangian, mesh-free numerical method that has been proven effective in a variety of disciplines. In this work, the hydrodynamic aspect of the liquid metal divertor is simulated using SPH, paving the way to implement additional physics in future work.. 47. Takumi Onchi, Hiroshi Idei, K.

The power supply is equipped with an IGBT array and a reactor for fast shutoff of the voltage in 10 μs, where the influx of electric energy at the short circuit is limited to 5 J. AC switches also have been installed in the three-phase power lines. High voltage relays are useful to save electric energy consumption. Fast three-phase AC switching by IGBT-stack is applicable to reduce the electric load of the components of the klystron power supply.. 48. K. Nakamura, M. M. Alam, Y. Z. Jiang, O. Mitarai, M.

In our previous work, plasma equilibrium solution was fitted assuming all plasma current is flowing in the inside of the Last Closed Flux Surface (LCFS). It was solved within isotropic pressure profile by EFIT code. Opposite-polarity current density region appeared in the high-field region. Here in this article, considering the toroidal rotation, the equilibrium is fitted within nested magnetic surfaces by SU-EFIT. Though the plasma magnetic axis shifts outward due to the centrifugal force, the opposite polarity current does not disappear in the high-field region. And relation between the toroidal rotation speed and the poloidal beta value will be discussed.. 49.

Thereafter, the surface morphology was evaluated by color measurement, TEM (Transmission Electron Microscope) and XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy). Thick deposition layers were formed on the samples placed at the equator and bottom walls. On the other hand, thin mixed material layer was deposited on the top wall, where large H (hydrogen) retention was observed, which would be caused by dynamic plasma wall interaction (erosion and deposition) with higher H flux. Low H retention was confirmed for bottom wall, where higher wall temperature without He discharge would contribute. The additional 1 keV D2 + was implanted into these samples and deuterium retention enhancement was estimated. It was clearly found that the irradiation damages would induce more deuterium trapping than the formation of C–D bond.. 50. K. Hanada, N. Yoshida, I. Takagi, T. Hirata, A. Hatayama, K. Okamoto, Y.

A simple wall model including the plasma-induced deposition layer that creates hydrogen (H)barriers, called the H barrier model, was established. A simple calculation, based on a combination of H state rate equations and the H barrier model, was applied to real plasma in the early phase of its longest discharge. The model accurately reconstructed the evolutions of electron density and wall-stored H over time, proper values are chosen for the parameters that are difficult to determine experimentally. Comparative calculations that used the H barrier and a fully reflective models, predicted significant impacts of wall models on the plasma density time response and value of electron density, indicating that a proper wall model should be developed for all-metal PFW devices.. 51.

QUEST has all-metal plasma facing walls (PFWs) that were temperature controlled during the experiments. The presence of a transport barrier for hydrogen (H) at the interface between a plasma-induced deposition layer and metallic substrate was confirmed by nuclear reaction analysis with exposing deuterium plasma. An effective method to evaluate global hydrogen flux to PFWs is proposed, taking advantage of the nature of wall saturation. The outgoing flux of fuel particles from the PFWs just after the plasma termination was proportional to the square of wall-stored H, which indicates that enhanced recombination of solved hydrogen played an essential role in dynamic retention and was in agreement with predictions from the H-barrier model. A simple calculation based on the combination of wall modelling and rate equations of the H states denoted a significant impact of wall modelling on the time response of the plasma density. Hence, a proper wall model including the effects of the deposition layer creating the H barrier is required to be developed, even for all-metal PFW devices.. 52. T. Kariya, R. Minami, T. Imai, M.

Mitsunaka, Development of high power gyrotrons for advanced fusion devices, Nuclear Fusion, 10.1088/1741-4326/ab0e2c, 59, 6, 2019.04, Megawatt (MW) gyrotrons, with a wide frequency range from 14 to 300 GHz, are being developed as part of a collaborative electron cyclotron heating (ECH) study for advanced fusion devices and a demonstration power plant (DEMO). (1) Detailed designs for a 14 GHz 1 MW gyrotron are being developed for fabrication. For a 14 GHz radio frequency (RF) beam with high divergence, a calculated transmission efficiency of 94% to the corrugated waveguide coupling position was obtained initially by introducing the design concept (direct RF beam coupling by built-in waveguide) to minimize the RF transmission path. Installing a double-disk sapphire window will make it possible to develop a 1 MW gyrotron with a continuous wave (CW) at 14 GHz. (2) In experimental tests of a new 28/35 GHz dual-frequency gyrotron, the cooling characteristics of an optimal-structure double-disk sapphire window were evaluated. We confirmed that operating at 0.4 MW with a CW at 28 GHz is feasible, reaching twice the output power reported in previous studies. In a 2 ms short-pulse experimental test, maximum powers of 1.65 MW at 28.04 GHz and 1.21 MW at 34.83 GHz were achieved. (3) A design study of a 77/51 GHz dual-frequency gyrotron was performed. Oscillations above 1.5 MW for 77 GHz and 1.3 MW for 51.88 GHz are expected for a beam voltage V k = 80 kV and beam current I k = 60 A. (4) In an experiment with a 300 GHz gyrotron, the influence of the wave reflected from the window was reduced by tilting the output window, and mode competition in the cavity was suppressed. An output power of 0.62 MW with a pulse width of 1 ms, which is the new record for this frequency, was obtained. (5) We also performed a trial design study of a 240 GHz gyrotron for DEMO.. 53.

A launcher system with two quasi-optical mirrors providing beam steering capability was designed to focus the incident beam to a small-sized waist of ∼0.05 m at the second-harmonic EC resonance layer. A relatively large focusing mirror was designed based on a Kirchhoff integral code developed to derive wave solutions. The focusing property of the launched beam was first confirmed with a 3-dimensional (3D) electromagnetic-wave simulator. Focusing characteristics were also checked at low-power test facilities, together with the steering capability. The performance of this launcher system was demonstrated to work as designed, and assembled in the QUEST device. The system was applied to the non-inductive second-harmonic EC plasma ramp-up experiments with no optimization required regarding the incident polarization. The results obtained for the non-inductive plasma ramp-up are also presented.. 54.

Radio frequency (RF; 8.2 GHz) power was delivered from the low field side (LFS) to the high field side HFS through waveguides, and from the HFS placed 20 cm above the midplane of the vacuum vessel. The aim was to compare the RF launches from the LFS and HFS. The plasma brightness, measured by a fast camera, as well as the H\n\nα\n\nsignal captured along the mid-plane, was noticeably higher in the HFS launch than in the LFS launch. The HFS injection achieved a plasma current of approximately 130 A, versus 35A in the LFS injection. The electron density n\n\ne\n\npredicted from the position of the upper hybrid resonance agreed with the line-averaged n\n\ne\n\nmeasured by an interferometer, confirming the effective conversion and subsequent damping of the EBW mode. The RF leakage of the HFS injection was less than one-sixth that of the LFS injection. These results indicate that HFS delivers better RF coupling and conversion efficiency to EBW than LFS injection. Such efficient plasma heating via EBW will significantly enhance the plasma production.. 55. K. Kuroda, R. Raman, Kazuaki Hanada, Makoto Hasegawa, Takumi Onchi, M. Ono, B. A. Nelson, T. R. Jarboe, M.

QUEST uses a new CHI electrode configuration in which the CHI insulator is not part of the vacuum boundary, making this configuration easier to implement in fusion reactors. Experimental results show that transient CHI startup in this alternate electrode configuration is indeed possible. Reliable gas breakdown was achieved, and toroidal currents up to 45 kA were generated.. 56. M. Matsuyama, H. Zushi, Kazutoshi Tokunaga, A.

Two kinds of SS316L samples were employed: bare SS316L and plasma-exposed SS316L. The amount of tritium retained in surface layers of a sample was nondestructively measured by β-ray-induced X-ray spectrometry, and changes in the surface state with heating in vacuum were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Significant increase in tritium retention in bare SS316L samples appeared in a degassing temperature region above 600 K. Similar tendency of tritium retention was observed for the plasma-exposed sample. It was seen that the degassing process prior to tritium exposure significantly influenced to the tritium retention behavior. Furthermore, it was suggested from surface analysis by XPS that chemical states of SS316L surface at high temperatures play an important role for tritium retention behavior.. 57. K. Okamoto, R.

The purpose of this study is to develop a model including a long timescale plasma interaction with metal PFMs. As a first step, we have developed a simple zero-dimensional (0D) model, which consists of particle balance equations for the following three different particle species: (a) hydrogen plasma (elec., H+, H+ 2 , H+ 3), (b) neutral hydrogen atoms (H) and molecules (H2) in the gas phase, and (c) the wall-stored H atoms. The model has been applied to simulate long-term operation in the limiter configuration of the QUEST tokamak. Modelling results of the long time evolution of the H atom wall inventory reasonably reproduce the experimental tendency. Although the present model is relatively simple, it is useful to understand the basic characteristics of overall plasma particle balance, the density control of the main plasma, and the H atom wall inventory for long-term tokamak operation.. 58.

Note that here QUEST is operated as a simple magnetized torus with a tight aspect ratio. Slab annular plasmas feature open magnetic field lines and can mimic the tokamak edge-scrape off layer (SOL)-like plasma attributes reasonably well. Three magnetic shear regimes are realized using three poloidal magnetic field (PF) coil pairs. A whole range of connection lengths (∼∞ ≥ L c ≥ 5.5 m) is scanned by varying the PF strength for a given toroidal field for each magnetic shear regime. For the first time a systematic study of the effect of magnetic shear and field line pitch together on edge-SOL-like plasma fluctuations is being reported. Slab plasmas with intermediate magnetic shear are observed to be more susceptible to generate distinct blobs when L c is reduced by increasing the PF strength. A distinct coherent mode appears only at the lowest magnetic shear slab featuring a deep potential well. Such mode is not apparent at other magnetic shear cases even at the same L c. Finally, with a combination of PF coil pairs, both the features of intermediate and low magnetic shear slabs are shown to be realizable simultaneously. Significantly stronger blobs are observed with such combination of PF mirror ratios in the presence of a coherent mode. This study may provide better insight into the effect of magnetic configuration in the tokamak edge and SOL turbulence and can help in searching for better tools to control cross-field convective intermittent transport in tokamaks.. 59.

QUEST, which is a middle-sized spherical tokamak, has hot walls that act as plasma-facing walls. They can be actively heated with sheath heaters and actively cooled with water. To control the wall temperature, heating and cooling systems have been developed. These systems adjust the power of the sheath heaters and the motor valves of the cooling system, respectively. The two systems communicate via Ethernet through UDP and control the hot-wall temperature cooperatively. The plasma control system (PCS) in QUEST has also been modified, especially with respect to gas fueling, in order to enable long-duration plasma sustainment. A feedback controller has been installed in the PCS, together with a mass flow controller, allowing Hα emission from the plasma which is used as a reference signal, to be well controlled. Plasma density calculations using a field-programmable gate array are proposed for the feedback control system.. 60.

In the early stage of low-density plasma start-up, when the electron cyclotron resonance and upper hybrid resonance layers are close to each other, efficient and localized heating by the EBW is attainable. We show that, when the electron density rises, the HFS scenario spontaneously shifts to current drive with successful electron heating. This shift can be explained as a change in heating mechanism from collisional to electron cyclotron damping. Also, we discuss a possible O-X-B scenario to continue the plasma current drive beyond the formation of an over-dense plasma.. 61.

The plasma contains no toroidal current and is used for the pre-ionization and non-inductive startup of a tokamak plasma. To obtain a deeper understanding of the basic properties of the plasmas produced in the spherical tokamak QUEST (Q-shu University Experiment with steady-state Spherical Tokamak), we have developed an optical emission spectroscopy system with multiple viewing chords and have used it to measure the spatial distributions of the toroidal and poloidal flow velocities of C2+ ions. We compare the measured velocities with those calculated from the ion drift equations using the plasma parameters reported for a similar spherical tokamak, LATE (the Low Aspect Ratio Torus Experiment).. 62.

In this paper, for the first time, suitable conditions for generation of the CHI-produced toroidal current in the QUEST vessel configuration were investigated using the Tokamak Simulation Code (TSC). The simulation results show that the configuration in which the biased electrode is located farther away from the injector flux coil requires higher currents in the injector coil to generate the required injector flux. Additionally, energizing a lower inboard poloidal field coil and possibly lowering the electrode plate closer to the injector flux coil may be necessary to improve injector flux shaping to permit a configuration that is more favorable for inducing flux closure.. 63.

The current in the open magnetic surface is due to the orbit-driven current by high-energy particles in the RF-driven plasma. High-energy particles guiding center orbits are calculated as contour plots of conserved variables in the Hamiltonian formulation considering particles in the initial position with different energies and pitch angles satisfying the resonance condition. A negative current appears near the magnetic axis, and a hollow current profile is expected even if the pressure driven current is considered. The equilibrium is fitted within nested magnetic surfaces by J-EFIT coded by MATLAB using the hollow current profile shift toward the low-field region. Although the plasma boundary shape reflects the plasma current density profile, the equilibrium shape fitted by J-EFIT does not coincide with the orbit-driven current profile. However, introducing an extension of the current profile without assuming nested contours into the J-EFIT code appropriately fits the plasma shape with the hollow current profile to the measured magnetic data.. 64.

Fully non-inductive plasma maintenance was achieved by a microwave of 8.2 GHz and 40 kW for more than 1 h 55 min with a well-controlled plasma-facing wall (PFW) temperature of 393 K using a hot wall on the middle-sized spherical tokamak QUEST until, finally, the discharge was terminated by the uncontrollability of the density. The PFW was composed of atmospheric plasma-sprayed tungsten and stainless steel. The hot wall plays essential roles in reducing the amount of wall-stored H and facilitating hydrogen recycling. The behaviour of fuel hydrogen in the PFW was investigated by monitoring the injection and evacuation of hydrogen into and from the plasma-producing vessel. A fuel particle balance equation based on the presence of a hydrogen transport barrier between the deposited layer and the substrate was applied to the long-duration discharges. It was found that the model could readily predict the observed behaviour that a higher wall temperature likely gives rise to faster wall saturation.. 66. Hiroshi Idei, T. Kariya, T. Imai, K.

A high plasma current of 54 kA was non-inductively ramped up and sustained stably for 0.9 s with a 270 kW 28 GHz wave. A higher plasma current of 66 kA was also non-inductively achieved with a slow ramp-up of the vertical field. We have achieved a significantly higher plasma current than those achieved previously with the 2nd harmonic EC waves. This fully non-inductive 2nd harmonic EC plasma ramp-up method might be useful for future burning plasma devices and fusion reactors, in particular for operations at half magnetic field with the same EC heating equipment.. 67.

Matsumoto, Measurement of thickness of film deposited on the plasma-facing wall in the QUEST tokamak by colorimetry, Review of Scientific Instruments, 10.1063/1.5000739, 88, 9, 2017.09, After several experimental campaigns in the Kyushu University Experiment with Steady-state Spherical Tokamak (QUEST), the originally stainless steel plasma-facing wall (PFW) becomes completely covered with a deposited film composed of mixture materials, such as iron, chromium, carbon, and tungsten. In this work, an innovative colorimetry-based method was developed to measure the thickness of the deposited film on the actual QUEST wall. Because the optical constants of the deposited film on the PFW were position-dependent and the extinction coefficient k1 was about 1.0-2.0, which made the probing light not penetrate through some thick deposited films, the colorimetry method developed can only provide a rough value range of thickness of the metal-containing film deposited on the actual PFW in QUEST. However, the use of colorimetry is of great benefit to large-area inspections and to radioactive materials in future fusion devices that will be strictly prohibited from being taken out of the limited area.. 68.

The permeation probes are used to measure directly the atomic hydrogen flux at several poloidal positions. The permeation through metals due to the ion and atom component of the hydrogen flux to the wall is indistinguishable. To estimate the contribution of the ions directly, Langmuir probes were used. The Гinc profile behind the plasma facing components (PFCs) is almost constant, ∼2 ×1018 H/s/m2.. 69. J. P. Qian, L. L. Lao, C. T. Holcomb, B. N. Wan, Y. W. Sun, D. Moreau, E. Li, L.

The technique uses a set of dynamic virtual poloidal field probes in the plasma core region. Numerical examples are shown for monotonic q profiles and negative central magnetic shear equilibria which are obtained with this technique. As a proof of principle, the technique is applied on the EAST tokamak, to constrain the plasma equilibrium reconstruction with the experimental q = 1 surface information from the ECE diagnostic in addition to the external magnetic measurements.. 70.

Takase, Effect of magnetic structure on RF-induced breakdown in QUEST, Physics of Plasmas, 10.1063/1.4985142, 24, 6, 2017.06, In tokamak operations, breakdown of plasma is the first step of the plasma build-up. In this paper, we present a combinative investigation of radio frequency (RF)-induced breakdown experiments in QUEST (Q-shu University Experiment with Steady-State Spherical Tokamak) and a one-point model of hydrogen ionization. Experimental results with two different frequencies of 2.45 GHz and 8.2 GHz showed that the clear threshold on connection length, L, existed for breakdown with a negative n-index configuration n=-(R/Bv)·(∂Bv/∂R), where R is the major radius and Bv the is vertical magnetic field. In contrast, breakdown was always obtained with positive n-index when changing L. It indicates that a lifetime of an incubated electron plays a significant role in the plasma breakdown. According to one-point model calculation, the experimental threshold of L is well predicted by the lifetime of the incubated electron estimated by employing the loss term along with L. The model calculation also describes the requirement of the minimum electron temperature Te for RF-induced breakdown to realize an avalanche of electrons in the tokamak magnetic structure.. 71. Y.

(1) In the first experiment of a 300 GHz gyrotron, an output power above 0.5 MW in the TE32,18 single mode was achieved with a pulse width of 2 ms. This was the first observation of MW-scale oscillations in a DEMO-relevant gyrotron mode. It was also found that the reflection at the output window affected the determination of the oscillation mode. Furthermore, several single mode oscillations in the 226-254 GHz range were confirmed, which is important for the step-frequency tunable gyrotron in the sub-THz frequency range. (2) Based on the successful results of the 77 and 154 GHz large helical device (LHD) tubes, a new 154/116 GHz dual-frequency gyrotron with an output of over 1.5 MW is being designed. (3) A new record output of 1.38 MW was obtained using an existing 28 GHz gyrotron. A newly designed tube aimed at achieving a dual-frequency output power of 2 MW at 28 GHz (0.4 MW continuous wave) and 1 MW at 35 GHz was built. In the first experimental test, main mode oscillations were observed at the frequencies of 28.036 and 34.831 GHz with Gaussian-like output beams and output power of 1.27 and 0.48 MW, respectively. A total efficiency of 50% was achieved at 28 GHz operation.. 73. J. P. Qian, L. L. Lao, H. Q. Liu, W. X. Ding, L. Zeng, Z. P. Luo, Q. L. Ren, Y. Huang, J. Huang, D. L. Brower, Kazuaki Hanada, D. L.

EFIT incorporates 11 simultaneous line-integrated density and Faraday effect measurements from POINT to self-consistently reconstruct the equilibrium toroidal current density profile using a Faraday rotation reconstruction algorithm. It is shown that the POINT measurements can be applied to improve the accuracy of core plasma current density and q profile on EAST. Comparisons of magnetic surfaces and the q profile reconstructed using external magnetic data against those using magnetic and POINT data are presented. Equilibrium reconstructions using POINT data are found to be consistent with sawtooth phenomena. The sensitivity of equilibrium reconstruction to POINT measurements indicates Faraday rotation provides important constraints for determining the current profile.. 74.

This paper reports on high-β N (>1.5) discharges in the 2015 EAST campaign. The characteristics of these H-mode plasmas have been presented in a database. Analysis of the experimental limit of β N has revealed several main features of typical discharges. Firstly, efficient, stable high heating power is required. Secondly, control of impurity radiation (partly due to interaction between the plasma and the in-vessel components) is also a critical issue for the maintenance of high-β N discharges. In addition an internal transport barrier (ITB) has recently been observed in EAST, introducing further improvement in confinement surpassing H-mode plasmas. ITB dynamics is another key issue for high-β N plasmas in EAST. Each of these features is discussed in this paper. Study and improvement of these issues could be considered as the key to achieving long-pulse high-β N operation with EAST.. 75. Y. K. Liu, N. Hamada, Kazuaki Hanada, X. Gao, H. Q. Liu, Y. W. Yu, J.

The plasma-facing components in EAST are actively cooled, providing good conditions for researching long-pulse and high-energy discharges. A long-pulse high-performance plasma discharge (#59892 discharge) of up to 103 s with a core electron temperature of up to 4.5 keV was sustained with an injected energy exceeding 0.22 GJ in the 2015-2016 experimental campaign. A calorimetric measurement utilizing the temperature increment of cooling water is carried out to calculate the heat load on the strike point region of the lower divertor during long-pulse discharges in EAST. For the long-pulse and high-energy discharges, the comparison of the measurement results for the heat load measured by divertor Langmuir probes and the calorimetry diagnostic indicates that most of the heat load is delivered to the divertor panels as plasma, not radiation, and charge exchange neutrals. The ratio of the heat load on the strike point region of the lower divertor to the total injected energy is on average 42.5% per discharge with the lower single null divertor configuration. If the radiated energy loss measured by the fast bolometer diagnostic is taken into consideration, the ratio is found to be 61.6%. The experimental results and the analysis of the physics involved in these discharges are reported and discussed.. 76.

Since one of the critical goals of the project is to achieve the steady-state operation with high temperature vacuum vessel wall, the PCS is also required to have the capability to control the plasma for a long period. For the increase of the loads to processing power of the PCS, the PCS is decentralized with the use of reflective memories (RFMs). The PCS controls the plasma edge position with the real-time identification of plasma current and its position. This identification is done with not only flux loops but also hall sensors. The gas fueling method by piezo valve with monitoring the Hα signal filtered by a digital low-pass filter are proposed and suitable for the steady-state operation on QUEST. The present status and prospect of the PCS are presented with recent topics.. 83. Kazuaki Hanada, H. Zushi, Hiroshi Idei, K. Nakamura, M. Ishiguro, S. Tashima, E. I.

Non-inductive plasmas were maintained for approximately 3-5 min, during which time power balance estimates could be achieved by monitoring wall and cooling-water temperatures. Approximately 70%-90% of the injected power could be accounted for by calorimetric measurements and approximately half of the injected power was found to be deposited on the vessel wall, which is slightly dependent on the magnetic configuration. The power distribution to water-cooled limiters, which are expected to be exposed to local heat loads, depends significantly on the magnetic configuration, however some of the deposited power is due to energetic electrons, which have large poloidal orbits and are likely to be deposited on the plasma facing components.. 84.

A 28 GHz 1 MW gyrotron developed for GAMMA 10/PDX achieved an output power of 1.38 MW in 2015 experiment after the power supply was improved. Furthermore, a new 28/35 GHz dual-frequency gyrotron (2 MW 3 s and 0.4 MW CW) for QUEST, NSTX-U, Heliotron J and GAMMA 10/PDX has been fabricated, after the preliminary test of a double-disk sapphire window installed in the gyrotron was performed. In the first experimental test, the oscillation of the main mode was confirmed at a frequency of 28.036 GHz with a Gaussian-like beam and an output power of 1.22 MW.. 88.

The current density distributions in electron cyclotron-heated plasma were estimated from the orbit analyses in the equilibrium plasma shaping for the fundamental and the second-harmonic resonant electrons separately. The current density distribution profiles on the equatorial plane were obtained for the electrons with initially positive and negative velocities parallel to the magnetic field direction as well as the trapped electrons. The surface averaged current density profiles of the closed flux surfaces were also evaluated. A significant amount of the positive current density distributions appeared outside the last closed flux surface (LCFS), while all the negative current density distributions were evaluated inside the LCFS. The trapped electrons being the second-harmonic electron cyclotron resonant contributed the negative current inside the LCFS. The positive current density distributions outside the LCFS were significant for the driven current density for both the fundamental and second-harmonic resonances.. 89. Takumi Onchi, H. Zushi, K.

The temperature and heat flux behave in an opposite way in the far-SOL and end-plate region after SGP, although SGP increases the density globally. The apparent density decay time in the far-SOL area is much longer than that in the core. Significant co-current flow is driven solely by the electron cyclotron wave in the far-SOL flow. Sheared flow is also observed in the perpendicular velocity profile during the recovered current flat-top phase, and such flow profiles are flattened by SGP. These flow profiles are attributed not only to drift-driven flow but also to transport-driven flow, the sink effect on the end-plate, and the balance of the neutral particle source.. 90.

Electron cyclotron wave injection in the Ohmic plasma features excitation of low frequency coherent fluctuations near the separatrix and enhanced cross-field transport. Plasma shifts from initial high field side limiter bound (inboard limited, IL) towards inboard poloidal null (IPN) configuration with steepening of the density profile at the edge. This may have facilitated the increased edge and SOL fluctuation activities. Observation of the coherent mode, associated plasma flow, and particle out-flux, for the first time in the IPN plasma configuration in a spherical tokamak may provide further impetus to the edge and SOL turbulence studies in tokamaks.. 91.

Direct information about hydrogen retention in the areas far from main plasma-wall interaction is essential because the significant part of the global retention is due to atomic hydrogen. Incident hydrogen flux Γinc is numerically reconstructed by fitting the experimentally measured hydrogen flux Γp, permeated through the membrane. The sensitivity of the probe is improved when compared with other work which allows dynamic changes of the retention flux to be monitored, allowing detection of 10% of the Γinc modulation, or ∼1017 H m−2s−1.. 92.

We surveyed particle orbits for different values of parallel refractive index, particle initial positions and pitch angles on fundamental and second harmonic resonance conditions. We observed that for fundamental harmonic resonance condition when particle orbits are plotted on the poloidal cross-section for positive values of parallel refractive index, these orbits are started from the resonance surface and produced their orbits around the LCFS (Large Closed Flux Surface). These orbits carry positive current. When particle orbits are plotted for negative values of parallel refractive index, these orbits are started from resonance surface, but remained at the inside of the LCFS. These orbits carry negative current that reduced the overall plasma current. For second harmonic resonance condition when particle orbits are plotted on the poloidal cross-section most of the orbits remained in inside the LCFS and carry positive current. When we consider the value of parallel refractive index-0.4 and +0.4 some particle orbits arrived at the limiter and become lost particles. On the other hand, when we consider particle initial positions 0.16 m or more vertically far from the mid plane some banana orbits are produced. These banana orbits make the current density profile maximum at low field side region. From this calculation we got a hollow current density profile with current density peak at the low field side region outside of the LCFS. From this calculation we can infer that parabolic current density profile is possible, if we set the resonance surface outside of the magnetic axis by increasing the toroidal magnetic field coil current and make the plasma position inward by increasing vertical field coil current.. 94.

A 2-dimensional ECE imaging systemwas developed with an adaptive-Array approach. Aradio-frequency (RF) heterodyne detection system with Software Defined Radio (SDR) devices and a phased-Array receiver antenna was used to measure the phase and amplitude of the ECE wave. The SDR heterodyne system could continuously measure the phase and amplitude with sufficient accuracy and time resolution while the previous digitizer system could only acquire data at specific times. Robust streaming phase measurements for adaptive-Arrayed continuous ECE diagnostics were demonstrated using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis with the SDR system. The emission field pattern was reconstructed using adaptive-Array analysis. The reconstructed profileswere discussed using profiles calculated from coherent single-frequency radiation from the phase array antenna.. 95.

Several vertical magnetic field ( Bz) configurations with varying mirror ratio (M) (a measure of field curvature) are applied and evolution of rotation is studied with the help of Doppler spectroscopy of bulk and impurity ions. Significant toroidal rotation (Vφ-6km/s) is initiated in the open magnetic field configuration during the initial plasma breakdown phase, which is later sustained ( Vφ- 20km/s) in a closed magnetic field configuration in steady state. Rotational velocity is primarily along the cocurrent direction and is found to be proportional to the Bz strength and the resulting plasma current. High M and Bz are demonstrated to be the two specific external controls by which rotation can be initiated in the plasma. The rotation in open field lines is found to be initiated at the ECR layer in the slablike plasma, which is evolved to produce a sustained rotation in the natural divertor inboard poloidal field null equilibrium in QUEST.. 96.

In the plasma current (Ip) ramp-up phase, high heat flux (>1 MW/m2) and supersonic flow (Mach number M > 1) are found to be present simultaneously in the far-SOL. The heat flux is generated by energetic electrons excursed from the last closed flux surface. Supersonic flows in the poloidal and toroidal directions are correlated with each other. In the quasi-steady state, sawtooth-like oscillation of Ip at 20 Hz is observed. Heat flux and subsonic plasma flow in the far-SOL are modified corresponding to the Ip-oscillation. The heat flow caused by motion of energetic electrons and the bulk-particle transport to the far-SOL is enhanced during the low-Ip phase. Modification of plasma flow in the far SOL occurs earlier than the Ip crash. The M-Ip curve has a limit-cycle characteristic with sawtooth-like oscillation. Such a core-SOL relationship indicates that the far-SOL flow plays an important role in sustaining the oscillation of Ip in the IPN configuration.. 102.

A 28 GHz 1 MW 1 s gyrotron has been developed to upgrade the GAMMA 10/PDX ECH systems. To improve the oscillation efficiency in high current regions, the magnetron injection gun (MIG) of the 28 GHz gyrotron has been modified. Output power of 1.25 MW has been achieved with this gyrotron. For the first step of the collaborative research between Tsukuba University and Kyushu University, the Tsukuba 28 GHz gyrotron was adapted to the Q-shu University Experiment with Steady-State Spherical Tokamak (QUEST) ECH system, and the plasma heating and current drive effect were demonstrated. We obtained successful results, including an electron cyclotron-driven plasma current of 66 kA in the QUEST plasma experiment. For the next step of the collaborative research, the design targets of a 2 MW 3 s and 0.4 MW continuous wave have been achieved in a design study of a new 28 GHz gyrotron.. 106. Kazuaki Hanada, H.

Approximately 70% of the fuel hydrogen (H) was retained in the wall and then was almost exhausted just after the discharge. The global recycling ratio (Rg), defined as the ratio of the evacuated H2 flux to that injected, was found to gradually increase during discharges and subsequently rose rapidly. To study the growth of Rg, the thermal desorption spectra after deuterium implantation in a specimen exposed to QUEST plasma was analyzed with a model which includes reflection, diffusion, solution, recombination, trapping, and plasma-induced desorption in the re-deposition layer. The model reconstructs the growth of Rg during a long-duration plasma and indicates solution plays a dominant role in the growth.. 107. Kariya, T., Minami, R., Imai, T., Kato, T., H.
