        "text": "Reducing depressive symptoms after the Great East Japan Earthquake in older survivors through group exercise participation and regular walking: a prospective observational study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTsuji, Taishi; Sasaki, Yuri; Matsuyama, Yusuke; Sato, Yukihiro; Aida, Jun; Kondo, Katsunori; Kawachi, Ichiro\n\n2017-01-01\n\nObjectives Survivors of the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake have an increased risk of depressive symptoms. We sought to examine whether participation in group exercise and regular walking could mitigate the worsening of depressive symptoms among older survivors. Design Prospective observational study. Setting Our baseline survey was conducted in August 2010, â¼7â months prior to the Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami, among people aged 65 or older residing in Iwanuma City, Japan, which suffered significant damage in the disaster. A 3-year follow-up survey was conducted in 2013. Participants 3567 older survivors responded to the questionnaires predisaster and postdisaster. Primary outcome measures Change in depressive symptoms was assessed using the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Results From predisaster to postdisaster, the mean change in GDS score increased by 0.1 point (95% CI â0.003 to 0.207). During the same interval, the frequency of group exercise participation and daily walking time also increased by 1.9â days/year and 1.3â min/day, respectively. After adjusting for all covariates, including personal experiences of disaster, we found that increases in the frequency of group exercise participation (B=â0.139, Î²=â0.049, p=0.003) and daily walking time (B=â0.087, Î²=â0.034, p=0.054) were associated with lower GDS scores. Interactions between housing damage and changes in group exercise participation (B=0.103, Î²=0.034, p=0.063) and changes in walking habit (B=0.095, Î²=0.033, p=0.070) were marginally significant, meaning that the protective effects tended to be attenuated among survivors reporting more extensive housing damage. Conclusions Participation in group exercises or regular walking may mitigate the worsening of depressive symptoms among older survivors who have experienced natural disaster.

Herein, we sought to investigate a contextual relationship between community-level prevalence of sports group participation and depressive symptoms in older individuals. We used data from the 2010 Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study, a population-based, cross-sectional study of individuals 65 yr or older without long-term care needs in Japan. Overall, 74,681 participants in 516 communities were analyzed. Depressive symptoms were diagnosed as a 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale score of â¥5. Participation in a sports group 1 dÂ·month or more often was defined as \"participation.\" For this study, we applied two-level multilevel Poisson regression analysis stratified by sex, calculated prevalence ratios (PR), and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Overall, 17,420 individuals (23.3%) had depressive symptoms, and 16,915 (22.6%) participated in a sports group. Higher prevalence of community-level sports group participation had a statistically significant relationship with a lower likelihood of depressive symptoms (male: PR, 0.89 (95% CI, 0.85-0.92); female: PR, 0.96 (95% CI, 0.92-0.99), estimated by 10% of participation proportion) after adjusting for individual-level sports group participation, age, diseases, family form, alcohol, smoking, education, equivalent income, and population density. We found statistically significant cross-level interaction terms in male participants only (PR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.77-0.95). We found a contextual preventive relationship between community-level sports group participation and depressive symptoms in older individuals. Therefore, promoting sports groups in a community may be effective as a population-based strategy for the prevention of depression in older individuals. Furthermore, the benefit may favor male sports group participants.\n\nThe history of the Gynecologic Cancer Study Group (GCSG) of the Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG).\n\nPubMed\n\nOnda, Takashi; Konishi, Ikuo; Yoshikawa, Hiroyuki; Kamura, Toshiharu\n\n2011-10-01\n\nThe Gynecologic Cancer Study Group (GCSG) of the Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG) was organized in 1994. The GCSG has developed under the leadership of three successive group representatives, five principal study investigators, the cooperation of group members and the support of several public research funds. At present, 38 institutions are participating as active members of the GCSG of the JCOG. In addition to gynecologic oncologists, medical oncologists, pathologists and radiotherapists are participating in our group. Our group manages female genital malignancies including uterine cervical, endometrial, ovarian, tubal and vulvar cancers. Because the incidences of uterine cervical (in younger women), endometrial and ovarian cancer have increased in Japan in recent years, we are developing new standard treatments especially for these malignancies. As of 31 May 2011, our group has conducted six JCOG clinical trials (three completed and three ongoing) and completed one JCOG accompanying study, which is now in preparation for publication. Our group has also conducted several retrospective studies, and Phase I and II trials independent of the JCOG Data Center. Our aim is to conduct unique and high-quality clinical trials which we can appeal to the world. In this review, we present the organization and achievements of our group, along with a list of participating institutions, as the history of the GCSG of the JCOG.\n\nShared death: self, sociality and internet group suicide in Japan.\n\nPubMed\n\nOzawa-De Silva, Chikako\n\n2010-07-01\n\nExisting models for understanding suicide fail to account for the distinctiveness of Internet group suicide, a recent phenomenon in Japan. Drawing from an ethnography of Internet suicide websites, two social commentaries in Japanese popular culture, and the work of developmental psychologist Philippe Rochat, I argue that participation in Internet suicide forums and even the act of Internet group suicide result from both a need for social connectedness and the fear of social rejection and isolation that this need engenders. These needs and fears are especially strong in the case of Japan, where the dominant cultural rhetoric ties selfhood closely to the social self that is the object of perception and experience by others. I show how such an understanding of Internet group suicide helps us to understand some of its basic characteristics, which are otherwise difficult to explain and which have puzzled the Japanese media and popular accounts: the \"ordinariness\" or casual nature of Internet group suicide, the wish for an easy or comfortable death, the wish to die with others, and the wish to \"vanish.\" Internet group suicide sheds light on questions of Japanese selfhood in modernity and expands our understanding of suicide in Japan in general.\n\nCorrelates of Regular Participation in Sports Groups among Japanese Older Adults: JAGES CrossâSectional Study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nYamakita, Mitsuya; Kanamori, Satoru; Kondo, Naoki; Kondo, Katsunori\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBackground Participation in a sports group is key for the prevention of incident functional disability. Little is known about the correlates of older adultsâ participation in sports groups, although this could assist with the development of effective health strategies. The purpose of this study was to identify the demographic and biological, psychosocial, behavioral, social and cultural, and environmental correlates of sports group participation among Japanese older adults. Methods Data were obtained from the Japan Gerontological Evaluation study, which was a populationâbased cohort of people aged â¥65 years without disability enrolled from 31 municipalities across Japan (n = 78,002). Poisson regression analysis was used to determine the associations between the factors and participation in sports groups. Results Non-regular participation in sports groups was associated with lower educational level, being employed, and working the longest in the agricultural/forestry/fishery industry among the demographic and biological factors and poor self-rated health and depression among the psychosocial factors. Of the behavioral factors, current smoking was negatively associated and current drinking was positively associated with regular participation in sports groups. Among the social and cultural factors, having emotional social support and participating in hobby clubs, senior citizen clubs, or volunteer groups were associated with a high prevalence of participation in sports groups. Perceptions of the presence of parks or sidewalks, good access to shops, and good accessibility to facilities were positively associated with participation in sports groups among the environmental factors. Conclusions Our study suggests that the promotion of activities that could increase older adultsâ participation in sports groups should consider a broad range of demographic and biological, psychosocial, behavioral, social and cultural, and environmental factors. Although future\n\nCorrelates of Regular Participation in Sports Groups among Japanese Older Adults: JAGES Cross-Sectional Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nYamakita, Mitsuya; Kanamori, Satoru; Kondo, Naoki; Kondo, Katsunori\n\n2015-01-01\n\nParticipation in a sports group is key for the prevention of incident functional disability.

Seventeen Japanese institutions are participating in the Antihypertensive Treatment for Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage (ATACH) II Trial (ClinicalTrials.gov no. NCT01176565; UMIN 000006526). This phase III trial is designed to determine the therapeutic benefit of early intensive systolic blood pressure (BP) lowering for acute hypertension in ICH patients. This report explains the long run-up to reach the start of patient registration in ATACH II in Japan, including our preliminary study, a nationwide survey on antihypertensive treatment for acute ICH patients, a multicenter study for hyperacute BP lowering (the SAMURAI-ICH study), revision of the official Japanese label for intravenous nicardipine, and construction of the infrastructure for the trial.

Cadwallader\n\n2004-09-01\n\nThis paper documents the activities of the US-Japan exchange in the area of personnel safety at magnetic and laser fusion experiments. A near-miss event with a visiting scientist to the US in 1992 was the impetus for forming the Joint Working Group on Fusion Safety. This exchnge has been under way for over ten years and has provided many safety insights for both US and Japanese facility personnel at national institutes and at universities. The background and activities of the Joint Working Group are described, including the facilities that have been visited for safety walkthroughs, the participants from both countries,moreÂ Â» and the main safety issues examined during visits. Based on these visits, some operational safety ideas to enhance experiment safety are given. The near-term future plans of the Safety Monitor Joint Working group are also discussed.Â«Â less\n\nBaseline Profile of Participants in the Japan Environment and Children's Study (JECS).\n\nPubMed\n\nMichikawa, Takehiro; Nitta, Hiroshi; Nakayama, Shoji F; Yamazaki, Shin; Isobe, Tomohiko; Tamura, Kenji; Suda, Eiko; Ono, Masaji; Yonemoto, Junzo; Iwai-Shimada, Miyuki; Kobayashi, Yayoi; Suzuki, Go; Kawamoto, Toshihiro\n\n2018-02-05\n\nThe Japan Environment and Children's Study (JECS), known as Ecochil-Chosa in Japan, is a nationwide birth cohort study investigating the environmental factors that might affect children's health and development. We report the baseline profiles of the participating mothers, fathers, and their children. Fifteen Regional Centres located throughout Japan were responsible for recruiting women in early pregnancy living in their respective recruitment areas. Self-administered questionnaires and medical records were used to obtain such information as demographic factors, lifestyle, socioeconomic status, environmental exposure, medical history, and delivery information. In the period up to delivery, we collected bio-specimens, including blood, urine, hair, and umbilical cord blood. Fathers were also recruited, when accessible, and asked to fill in a questionnaire and to provide blood samples. The total number of pregnancies resulting in delivery was 100,778, of which 51,402 (51.0%) involved program participation by male partners. Discounting pregnancies by the same woman, the study included 95,248 unique mothers and 49,189 unique fathers. The 100,778 pregnancies involved a total of 101,779 fetuses and resulted in 100,148 live births. The coverage of children in 2013 (the number of live births registered in JECS divided by the number of all live births within the study areas) was approximately 45%. Nevertheless, the data on the characteristics of the mothers and children we studied showed marked similarity to those obtained from Japan's 2013 Vital Statistics Survey. Between 2011 and 2014, we established one of the largest birth cohorts in the world.\n\nEffectiveness of Group Positive Parenting Program (Triple P) in Changing Child Behavior, Parenting Style, and Parental Adjustment: An Intervention Study in Japan\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nFujiwara, Takeo; Kato, Noriko; Sanders, Matthew R.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of a group-based family intervention program known as the Group Positive Parenting Program (Triple P), with families in Japan.

We studied 393 new program participants and examined whether part-time work influenced their well-being or \"ikigai.\" The participants were divided into those who had worked in SHRC-provided jobs in the preceding year, and those who had not. Gender-stratified regression models were fitted to determine whether SHRC employment was associated with increased well-being. For men, actively working at a SHRC job was associated with greater well-being, compared to inactive members. And men with SHRC jobs and previous volunteering experience had the greatest increase in well-being. Women SHRC job holders did not experience increased well-being at the year's end. The study concludes that there is justification for exploring the usefulness of a similar program for American retirees who desire post-retirement part-time work.\n\nFactors determining the social participation of older adults: A comparison between Japan and Korea using EASS 2012.\n\nPubMed\n\nKatagiri, Keiko; Kim, Ju-Hyun\n\n2018-01-01\n\nJapan and Korea are the world's most aged and most rapidly aging nations. They both have low fertility rates, thereby intensifying the importance of social structures to aid a large, dependent population of older adults. Common strategies involve improving their social participation, which enhances their physical and mental health, so they are supporting society rather than being supported. Since the social participation rates in both countries are not as high as those of Western countries, it is critical to shed light on the factors related to social participation of the elderly. A secondary analyses were performed using Japanese and Korean data from the 2012 East Asia Social Survey (EASS), which includes nationally representative samples through random sampling. The analyses only include data from those 65 and older (Japan: N = 683, Korea: N = 362). Social participation is classified into four types: 1) no affiliation; 2) inactive participation; 3) active recreational; and 4) active social. The Japanese respondents had a higher participation rate than Koreans, but more Japanese were inactive. Though the rates of active participations were similar in both countries. Multinomial logistic regressions were conducted to examine the related factors among the four types of social participation. Basic attributes (e.g., living alone) and other factors (e.g., network size) were included as independent variables. The results show that larger non-family networks were linked with increased social participation in both societies. Men were more vulnerable to engaging in no social activities and at a higher risk of social isolation in both countries. One difference between the two nations is that among the Japanese, people with higher social orientations engage in more active social type participation. This study reveals that non-kin social networks are important for social participation in Japan and Korea.\n\nFactors determining the social participation of older adults: A comparison between Japan and Korea using EASS 2012\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2018-01-01\n\nAims Japan and Korea are the worldâs most aged and most rapidly aging nations.

The NameExoWorlds competition, led by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), was held from 9 July 2014 to 15 December 2015. It was a unique event that invited the public to name celestial bodies. In Japan, language acts as a significant barrier for amateur astronomers and school students to participate in global events hosted in English. To address this concern, we established a domestic working group to set up a Japanese website and provided a translation of the IAU's official site for the NameExoWorlds competition. We also developed additional original information in Japanese when needed and sent announcements to a mailing lists of astronomy societies in Japan. As a result, 28% of the registered groups and 47% of proposals for names were from Japan, making Japan the most active country for these stages of the competition. After the competition had ended, we carried out a survey in the Japanese astronomy community and received 124 responses. We found that most of the Japanese participants referred to our official Japanese website in order to overcome the language barrier and participate in the competition. This article explores our work of translating the competition information into Japanese and our evaluation of the impact of this action on the uptake by Japanese astronomy enthusiasts.\n\nBaseline Profile of Participants in the Japan Environment and Childrenâs Study (JECS)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNitta, Hiroshi; Nakayama, Shoji F.; Yamazaki, Shin; Isobe, Tomohiko; Tamura, Kenji; Suda, Eiko; Ono, Masaji; Yonemoto, Junzo; Iwai-Shimada, Miyuki; Kobayashi, Yayoi; Suzuki, Go; Kawamoto, Toshihiro\n\n2018-01-01\n\nBackground The Japan Environment and Childrenâs Study (JECS), known as Ecochil-Chosa in Japan, is a nationwide birth cohort study investigating the environmental factors that might affect childrenâs health and development.

Leader behaviors and group cohesion have been associated with increased participation or adherence in sports team and exercise class settings. Physical activity interventions in community settings that encompass these factors may enhance intervention adherence. Purpose To examine the impact of Community Health Promoter leader behaviors and group cohesion on participation in a walking group intervention among racially/ethnically diverse adults in low-to-moderate income communities in Detroit, Mich. Design Data for the current study were drawn from the Walk Your Heart to Health (WYHH) data set. WYHH was a multi-site cluster randomized controlled study with a lagged intervention and outcome measurements at baseline, four, eight, and 32 weeks. Pooled survey data from both intervention arms is used for the current study. Data were analyzed between August 2013 and October 2014. Setting/participants A total of 603 non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic White, and Hispanic adults across five cohorts that began the 32-week WYHH intervention between March 2009 and October 2011. Intervention A 32-week long walking group program hosted by community- and faith-based organizations and facilitated by Community Health Promoters. Walking groups met three times per week for 90-minutes per session. To promote participation in or adherence to WYHH, Community Health Promoters used evidence-based strategies to facilitate group cohesion. Group members assumed increasing leadership responsibility for facilitating sessions over time. Main outcome measures Participation in WYHH as measured by consistency of attendance. Results Community Health Promoter leader behaviors were positively associated with participation in WYHH. Social but not task cohesion was significantly associated with consistent participation. Social cohesion may mediate the relationship between leader behaviors and walking group\n\nAssociation between social group participation and perceived health among elderly inhabitants of a previously methylmercury-polluted area.\n\nPubMed\n\nTanaka, Mika; Ushijima, Kayo; Sung, Woncheol; Kawakita, Minoru; Tanaka, Shiro; Mukai, Yoshito; Tamura, Kenji; Maruyama, Sadami\n\n2014-07-01\n\nThis study attempted to clarify the association between participation in a social group and perceived health among elderly residents of a previously methylmercury-polluted area in Japan. We conducted a cross-sectional study using eligible subjects from the Shiranui Sea coastal area, where mercury poisoning due to daily intake of fish and shellfish had previously caused some residents to develop the neurological disorder \"Minamata disease (MD).\" In the present study, we selected subjects aged â¥65 years who had never been diagnosed with MD or applied for medical treatment compensation. A logistic regression model after adjusting for confounding factors showed that membership in a hobby or volunteer group was associated with good perceived health (odds ratio 1.97, 95 % confidence interval 1.02-3.80). Our results showed that the effects of membership in social groups on perceived health were not equal across all social groups, with only hobby- or volunteer-related groups having a positive effect on perceived health. Our findings suggested that promoting participation in a social group such as hobby- or volunteer-related groups can help improve perceived health among elderly individuals who had experienced environmental pollution incidents.\n\nRoles of participation and feedback in group potency.\n\nPubMed\n\nGamero, Nuria; PeirÃ³, JosÃ© M; Zornoza, Ana; Picazo, Carmen\n\n2009-08-01\n\nThe roles of group participation and group performance feedback were examined as antecedents of group potency, i.e., beliefs shared among a work group's members about the general effectiveness of the work group. Also examined were how group participation and the congruence of the feedback received from different sources about performance predicted convergence in members' beliefs about group effectiveness. The sample comprised 61 work groups of professionals involved in Master in Business Administration (MBA) programs (284 participants). Mean group size was 4.6 members (SD = .58). 65% of participants were male, and 51% were between 30 and 40 years of age. Data were gathered at two measurement times. Increases in group participation were positively related to increases in group potency and the convergence in beliefs about group effectiveness among group members over time. Results supported the premise that group performance feedback is an antecedent of changes in group potency over time.\n\n50 CFR 37.13 - Group participation.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2014 CFR\n\n2014-10-01\n\n... 50 Wildlife and Fisheries 9 2014-10-01 2014-10-01 false Group participation. 37.13 Section 37.13 Wildlife and Fisheries UNITED STATES FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE, DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR (CONTINUED) THE...

It is an excellent chance for amateur clubs, school groups, and other non-profit organizations to get interested in the latest astronomical research of exoplanets by participating in the international contest.In Japan the NameExoWorlds Working Group (WG) was organized at the Astronomical Consortium of Japan (ACJ). ACJ consists of astronomical organizations such as Astronomical Society of Japan (ASJ), National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ), Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), Japanese Society for Education and Popularization of Astronomy (JSEPA), Japan Planetarium Association (JPA), Japan Public Observatory Society (JAPOS), and Japan Amateur Astronomers Association (JAAA). The WG was led by volunteers from JSEPA and JAAA.We, the WG members, developed the exoplanet.jp website to provide useful information to the public in Japanese language with useful contents: translations of the contest schedule and how to register, how to observe exoplanets, recommended planetary systems by Japanese researchers, downloadable photos and posters, and so on.We also sent updates frequently by e-mail newsletters and twitter so that a lot of Japanese groups feel easy and confortable to register and to vote for the 20 planetary systems they wish to name. Before the deadline of voting for 20 planetary systems on February 15, 2015, 127 Japanese groups completed registration, which account for about one third of the 388 registered groups in the world (as of Feb 15).In our presentation we will report our approaches to inspire Japanese people to participate in the worldwide NameExoWorlds contest.\n\nThe Academic Profession and University Governance Participation in Japan: Focusing on the Role of Kyoju-kai\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nYonezawa, Akiyoshi\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe dominant role of Kyoju-kai (the professoriate) in university governance in Japan is now facing a critical examination as part of university reforms in response to global competition.

Joon; Carroll, John M.\n\nVoluntary associations serve crucial roles in local communities and within our larger democratic society. They aggregate shared interests, collective will, and cultivate civic competencies that nurture democratic participation. People active in multiple local groups frequently act as opinion leaders and create âweakâ social ties across groups. In Blacksburg and surrounding Montgomery County, Virginia, the Blacksburg Electronic Village (BEV) community computer network has helped to foster nearly universal Internet penetration. Set in this dense Internet context, the present study investigated whether and how personal affiliation with local groups enhanced political participation in this high information and communication technology environment. This paper presents findings from longitudinal survey data which indicate that as individualsâ uses of information technology within local formal groups increase over time, so do their levels and types of involvement in the group. Furthermore, these increases most often appear among people who serve as opinion leaders and maintain weak social ties in their communities. Individualsâ changes in community participation, interests and activities, and Internet use suggest ways in which group members act upon political motivations and interests across various group types.\n\nClinical trial participation. Viewpoints from racial/ethnic groups.\n\nPubMed\n\nRoberson, N L\n\n1994-11-01\n\nRacial/ethnic groups' participation in clinical trials is a relatively new area of research that warrants attention. Although racial/ethnic groups have been included in experimental studies since the 1940s, they were not included in significant numbers in clinical trials for cancer. Clinical trials play a dominant role in clinical oncology. Despite this state-of-the-art cancer treatment, however, there is mounting concern that this scientific progress is not being shared equitably by all segments of the U.S. population. There is underrepresentation of members of racial/ethnic groups in cancer clinical trials, which suggests that participation may be a critical issue. Unfortunately, little is known or documented about these groups' participation in clinical trials. This paper discusses racial/ethnic groups' views and opinions about clinical trial participation. Diagnostic research was conducted as a beginning phase to investigate this new area of research. African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans in three Buffalo, New York, communities were selected as study subjects. Data were collected via telephone surveys. Qualitative methods were employed for data analysis and reporting. Findings showed that study subjects knew little about cancer clinical trials and basically had no opportunity to participate. They believed that participation in clinical trials could be beneficial. In each of the three groups, however, there were cultural factors believed to influence participation. A primary concern was \"mistrust of white people\" and the feeling of being treated like \"guinea pigs.\" Based on study findings, it was evident that recruitment for improving participation requires strategic planning that involves participants representative of the study population. To yield results, the plan should be tailored to the target group, presented as a credible study, designed to reflect trust in the medical care team, and implemented through a continuous educational process.\n\nStrategies to Increase Participation in Cooperative Learning Groups\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMaher, Laura\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThis action research examines how focused organization, group roles, and gender grouping impact student participation when working in a cooperative group setting. Fifty-two sixth graders were studied for a period of nine weeks.

The term 'machine translation' as used here, includes both the science and technology required for automating the translation of text from one human language to another. Machine translation is viewed in Japan as an important strategic technology that is expected to play a key role in Japan's increasing participation in the world economy. MT is seen in Japan as important both for assimilating information into Japanese as well as for disseminating Japanese information throughout the world. Most of the MT systems now available in Japan are transfer-based systems. The majority of them exploit a case-frame representation of the source text as the basis of the transfer process. There is a gradual movement toward the use of deeper semantic representations, and some groups are beginning to look at interlingua-based systems.\n\n[Osaka Medical Laboratory ISO15189 Study Group: History and Future Prospects of the Group].\n\nPubMed\n\nIguchi, Ken\n\n2016-02-01\n\nThe IS015189 \"Medical laboratories: Specific requirements regarding quality and competence\" is an international standard issued by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in February 2003. In October 2004, pilot surveys were initiated in Japan prior to accreditation surveys scheduled to be started in 2005. In September 2005, the first ever ISO15189-accredited facility was established in Japan. With the background of limited information about and few opportunities to study ISO15189 in 2004, we established the Osaka Medical Laboratory ISO15189 Study Group as a unique association that anyone interested in the ISO is able to join. Approximately 900 people have participated in group meetings, which have been held a total of 11 times. Thus, our group has played a major role in ISO development in Japan. To date, approximately 100 facilities have been ISO15189-accredited in Japan, suggesting the need to take new steps regarding its accreditation. As our group has achieved our initial objective, we are planning to work towards taking new steps, such as interaction with accredited facilities.\n\nNASA Participated in the Japan 2001 Science, Creativity and the Young Mind Workshop\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKolecki, Joseph C.; Petersen, Ruth A.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nDuring the week of July 23, 2001, a workshop called the Japan 2001 Science, Creativity and the Young Mind took place at Bristol University in Bristol, England. Coordinated by the Clifton Scientific Trust, it brought together 60 British and Japanese students and provided them with a forum for learning and interacting. All the students were chosen from geographical areas of social deprivation, where university education is not seen as a natural progression for students. One of the aims of the workshop was to give the combined group a new view of themselves as potential scientists and an ambition to succeed at the highest level. Members of the Glenn Research Center's Learning Technologies Project participated with six of the students and their team leaders as a Space Science Team. Four interactive videoconferencing sessions were held between the NASA Glenn Research Center and Bristol University on four consecutive days. During the sessions, students raised questions concerning various theories about the probable formation of volcanoes on Mars. Of specific interest was if the great Tharsis volcanoes might be the result of an ancient collision of planetary proportions, or if plate tectonic movement, evidence for which was recently discovered by NASA's Mars Global Surveyor Spacecraft, might account for them.\n\nReligiosity and Participation in Mutual-Aid Support Groups for Addiction\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAtkins, Randolph G.; Hawdon, James E.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nMutual-aid support groups play a vital role in substance abuse treatment in the United States. A national survey of mutual-aid support groups for addiction was conducted to identify key differences between participants in recovery groups. Survey data indicate that active involvement in support groups significantly improves one's chances of remaining clean and sober, regardless of the group in which one participates. Respondents whose individual beliefs better matched those of their primary support groups showed greater levels of group participation, resulting in better outcomes as measured by increased number of days clean and sober. Religious respondents were more likely to participate in 12-Step groups and Women for Sobriety. Non-religious respondents were significantly less likely to participate in 12-Step groups. Religiosity had little impact on SMART Recovery participation, but actually decreased participation in SOS. These results have important implications for treatment planning and matching individuals to appropriate support groups.

Prior to the clinical study, the accuracy of dose calculation in radiation treatment-planning systems was surveyed in participating institutions, and differences in the irradiating dose between the institutions were investigated. We developed a water tank-type lung phantom appropriate for verification of the exposure dose in lung SBRT. Using this water tank-type lung phantom, the dose calculated in the radiation treatment-planning system and the measured dose using a free air ionization chamber and dosimetric film were compared in a visiting survey of the seven institutions participating in the clinical study. In all participating institutions, differences between the calculated and the measured dose in the irradiation plan were as follows: the accuracy of the absolute dose in the center of the simulated tumor measured using a free air ionization chamber was within 2%, the mean gamma value was â¤ 0.47 on gamma analysis following the local dose criteria, and the pass rate was >87% for 3%/3 mm from measurement of dose distribution with dosimetric film. These findings confirmed the accuracy of delivery doses in the institutions participating in the clinical study, so that a study with integration of the institutions could be initiated.\n\nJapanese Cancer Survivors' Awareness of and Participation in Support Groups.\n\nPubMed\n\nHatano, Yutaka; Mitsuki, Sachiko; Hosokawa, Toyoshi; Fukui, Kenji\n\n2018-02-01\n\nCancer survivors face many challenges, and cancer support groups provide a range of support. Several reports have shown the benefits of support groups. However, it is not clear how Japanese cancer survivors use them. This study aimed to examine cancer survivors' awareness of and reasons for participation or non-participation in cancer support groups. We conducted a cross-sectional questionnaire survey with ambulatory patients with cancer across eight designated cancer hospitals. The questionnaire covered patients' demographics, disease characteristics, participation/non-participation in cancer support groups, and reasons for participation/non-participation. In total, 569 questionnaires were distributed, and responses were received from 275 patients with cancer. Of these, 135 patients were aware of support groups and 23 had participated in a group. Patients who were aware of support groups were more likely to be young, female patients. Many patients learned about support groups from hospital notices. Most support group participants expected to receive information about the disease and treatment (91%). They also wanted to hear about other patients' experiences (73%). The most common reasons for non-participation were \"no particular reason\" (38%) and \"family or friends support me\" (27%). About half of participating patients were unaware of support groups. Even among patients who were aware, many did not attend a support group. Developing a better understanding of support group use in cancer survivors may enhance provision of adequate care based on individual needs.\n\nLatino Civic Group Participation, Social Networks, and Physical Activity.\n\nPubMed\n\nMarquez, Becky; Gonzalez, Patricia; Gallo, Linda; Ji, Ming\n\n2016-07-01\n\nWe examined whether social networks and resource awareness for physical activity may mediate the relationship between civic group participation and physical activity. This is a cross-sectional study of a randomly selected sample of 335 Latinos (mean age 42.1 Â± 16.4 years) participating in the San Diego Prevention Research Center's 2009 Household Community Survey. Serial multiple mediation analysis tested the hypothesis that civic group participation is associated with meeting physical activity recommendations through an indirect mechanism of larger social networks followed by greater knowledge of physical activity community resources. The indirect effects of level of civic group participation as well as religious, health, neighborhood, or arts group participation on meeting national physical activity recommendations were significant in models testing pathways through social network size and physical activity resource awareness. The direct effect was only significant for health group indicating that participating in a health group predicted physical activity independent of social network size and awareness of physical activity resources. Belonging to civic groups may promote physical activity engagement through social network diffusion of information on community physical activity resources which has implications for health.\n\nOutbreak of Neisseria meningitidis capsular group W among scouts returning from the World Scout Jamboree, Japan, 2015\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSmith-Palmer, Alison; Oates, Ken; Webster, Diana; Taylor, Sarah; Scott, Kevin J; Smith, Gemma; Parcell, Benjamin; Lindstrand, Ann; Wallensten, Anders; Fredlund, Hans; WiderstrÃ¶m, Micael; McMenamin, Jim\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe 23rd World Scout Jamboree was held in Japan from 28 July to 8 August 2015 and was attended by over 33,000 scouts from 162 countries. An outbreak of invasive meningococcal disease capsular group W was investigated among participants, with four confirmed cases identified in Scotland, who were all associated with one particular scout unit, and two confirmed cases in Sweden; molecular testing showed the same strain to be responsible for illness in both countries. The report describes the public health action taken to prevent further cases and the different decisions reached with respect to how wide to extend the offer of chemoprophylaxis in the two countries; in Scotland, chemoprophylaxis was offered to the unit of 40 participants to which the four cases belonged and to other close contacts of cases, while in Sweden chemoprophylaxis was offered to all those returning from the Jamboree. The report also describes the international collaboration and communication required to investigate and manage such multinational outbreaks in a timely manner.

Although some studies showed that the earthquake increased the risk of pneumonia death, no study reported whether and how much a tsunami increased the risk. We examined the risk for pneumonia death after the earthquake/tsunami. This is an ecological study. Data on population and pneumonia deaths obtained from the Vital Statistics 2010 and 2012, National Census 2010 and Basic Resident Register 2010 and 2012 in Japan. About 5.7 million participants residing in Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima Prefectures during 1 year after the disaster were targeted. All municipalities (n=131) were categorised into inland (n=93), that is, the earthquake-impacted area, and coastal types (n=38), that is, the earthquake-impacted and tsunami-impacted area. The number of pneumonia deaths per week was totalled from 12 March 2010 to 9 March 2012. The number of observed pneumonia deaths (O) and the sum of the sex and age classes in the observed population multiplied by the sex and age classes of expected pneumonia mortality (E) were calculated. Expected pneumonia mortality was the pneumonia mortality during the year before. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated for pneumonia deaths (O/E), adjusting for sex and age using the indirect method. SMRs were then calculated by coastal and inland municipalities. 6603 participants died of pneumonia during 1 year after the earthquake. SMRs increased significantly during the 1st-12th weeks. In the 2nd week, SMRs in coastal and inland municipalities were 2.49 (95% CI 2.02 to 7.64) and 1.48 (95% CI 1.24 to 2.61), respectively. SMRs of coastal municipalities were higher than those of inland municipalities. An earthquake increased the risk of pneumonia death and tsunamis additionally increased the risk.

The subjects were 266 people (140 Japanese, 126 Chinese) with mental illness who were living in their local community. Our SESP scale (SESP27) and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Norbeck Social Support Questionnaire (NSSQ), Sense of Coherence measure (SOC13), General Health Questionnaire (GHQ12), and a self-administered questionnaire related to living conditions were used for data collection. Data were analyzed descriptively, correlations between scales were examined, and multiple regression analysis was performed by country. The results showed that annual income was related to SESP in Japan and China. Therefore, improvement of welfare and employment support for economic independence is likely to improve SESP of people with mental illness in both countries. In addition, SESP in people with mental illness is affected by self-esteem in Japan, and coping skills such as improvement of life functions in China. Thus, SESP is affected differently by the social, cultural and institutional characteristics of each country. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This study investigated recent trends in antibiotic use and factors associated with appropriate antibiotic selection among children with group A streptococcal infections in Japan. Records of outpatients aged <18years with a diagnosis of group A streptococcal infection were obtained using the Japan Medical Data Center database. Prescription patterns for antibiotics were investigated and factors associated with penicillin use were evaluated using a multivariable log-binomial regression model. Overall, 5030 patients with a diagnosis of group A streptococcal infection were identified. The most commonly prescribed antibiotics were third-generation cephalosporins (53.3%), followed by penicillins (40.1%). In the multivariable log-binomial regression analysis, out-of-hours visits were independently associated with penicillin prescriptions [prevalence ratio (PR)=1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-1.18], whereas clinical departments other than paediatrics and internal medicine were related to non-penicillin prescriptions (PR=0.57, 95% CI 0.46-0.71). Third-generation cephalosporins were overprescribed for children with group A streptococcal infections. This investigation provides important information for promoting education for physicians and for constructing health policies for appropriate antibiotic prescription. Copyright Â© 2017.

We sought to investigate the association between the ABO blood group and risk of gastroduodenal ulcers (GDU) using combined analysis of both retrospective and prospective data from a large cohort study of Japanese women, the Japan Nurses' Health Study (JNHS; n = 15,019). The impact of the ABO blood group on GDU risk was examined using Cox regression analysis to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), with adjustment for potential confounders. Compared with women with non-O blood types (A, B, and AB), women with blood type O had a significantly increased risk of GDU from birth (multivariable-adjusted HR 1.18; 95% CI, 1.04-1.34). Moreover, the highest cumulative incidence of GDU was observed in women born pre-1956 with blood type O. In a subgroup analysis stratified by birth year (pre-1956 or post-1955), the multivariable-adjusted HR of women with blood type O was 1.22 (95% CI, 1.00-1.49) and 1.15 (95% CI, 0.98-1.35) in the pre-1956 and post-1955 groups, respectively. In this large, combined, ambispective cohort study of Japanese women, older women with blood type O had a higher risk of developing GDU than those with other blood types.\n\nGastroduodenal Ulcers and ABO Blood Group: the Japan Nursesâ Health Study (JNHS)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nIdeno, Yuki; Lee, Jung-Su; Suzuki, Shosuke; Nakajima-Shimada, Junko; Ohnishi, Hiroshi; Sato, Yasunori; Hayashi, Kunihiko\n\n2018-01-01\n\nBackground Although several studies have shown that blood type O is associated with increased risk of peptic ulcer, few studies have investigated these associations in Japan.

Although ethics arise out of an individual's consciousness, ethical regulations imposed by the nation/government together with self-regulation by physician groups are important in the practice of ethics, for which reason countries around the world undertake various initiatives. This paper investigates physician licensure, organizations governing physician status, the role of physician groups, and the actual conditions of lifelong learning and ethics education in developed countries worldwide, in contrast with which it throws problems in the situation in Japan into relief. Organizations governing physician status, the form of medical associations, and the improvement of lifelong learning are pointed out as critical issues especially in Japan.

All subjects were classified into three groups according to the frequency of participation in the screening program during the last 5 years; i.e., frequent participating group (FPG) for 4 or 5 times, reference group (RG) for 1-3 times and non-participating group (NPG) for 0 times. Subjects in the FPG consumed more milk and green-yellow vegetable whereas those in the NPG consumed less these foods. The age-adjusted proportions of present smokers were higher in the NPG but lower in the FPG significantly. The proportions of subjects who had parental histories of all cancers and stomach cancer and past history of gastro-duodenal ulcer were higher in the FPG and lower in the NPG. To control influences among the variables a stepwise multiple regression analysis was done, and it revealed that smoking and parental history of cancers were strong predictors to explain the frequency of participation.\n\nTeaching about Japan: Lessons and Resources.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBernson, Mary Hammond, Ed.; Wojtan, Linda S., Ed.\n\nThis document is a revised and updated version of two publications: \"Modern Japan: An Idea Book for K-12 Teachers\" and \"Resources for Teaching About Japan.\" These lesson plans were developed by teachers who participated in a summer institute on Japan, sponsored by the East Asia Resource Center at the Jackson School ofâ¦\n\nThe association between social participation and cognitive function in community-dwelling older populations: Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study at Taisetsu community Hokkaido.\n\nPubMed\n\nSakamoto, Ai; Ukawa, Shigekazu; Okada, Emiko; Sasaki, Sachiko; Zhao, Wenjing; Kishi, Tomoko; Kondo, Katsunori; Tamakoshi, Akiko\n\n2017-10-01\n\nTo study the association between the number of area-level and individual-level social participation items and cognitive function in the community-dwelling older populations of three towns in Hokkaido, Japan. A survey on the frequency of social participation was mailed to those in the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study 2013 who were aged â¥65âyears, were not certified as needing long-term care, and lived in Higashikawa, Higashikagura, or Biei. A subset of participants aged 70-74âyears completed the Japanese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment in a home visit survey. Both the area-level and individual-level social participation and demographic information were obtained on the self-administered questionnaire. A multilevel analysis using a generalized linear mixed-effects model was used to examine the association between variables in the area-level and individual-level social participation items and cognitive function. Out of 4042 respondents, data from 2576 were used in the area-level analysis. Of those, 180 were aged 70-74âyears and completed the home visit survey for the individual-level analysis. A greater number of higher social participation items at the individual level was associated with higher cognitive function scores after adjusting for area-level social participation variables and confounders (regression coefficient: 0.19; 95% confidence interval: 0.03, 0.35). There were no significant associations between area-level social participation item averages and individual-level cognitive function scores. Older populations participating in many kinds of social activities exhibited preserved cognitive function even after adjusting for area-level social participation variables.

Methods and Materials: The questionnaire was sent by mail to 117 institutions. Ninety-four institutions (80%) responded by the end of November 2005. Fifty-three institutions indicated that they have already started SBRT, and 38 institutions had been reimbursed by insurance. Results: A total of 1111 patients with histologically confirmed lung cancer were treated. Among these patients, 637 had T1N0M0 and 272 had T2N0M0 lung cancer. Metastatic lung cancer was found in 702 and histologicallymoreÂ Â» unconfirmed lung tumor in 291 patients. Primary liver cancer was found in 207 and metastatic liver cancer in 76 patients. The most frequent schedule used for primary lung cancer was 48Gy in 4 fractions at 22 institutions (52%), followed by 50Gy in 5 fractions at 11 institutions (26%) and 60Gy in 8 fractions at 4 institutions (10%). The tendency was the same for metastatic lung cancer. The average number of personnel involved in SBRT was 1.8 radiation oncologists, including 1.1 certified radiation oncologists, 2.8 technologists, 0.7 nurses, and 0.6 certified quality assurance personnel and 0.3 physicists. The most frequent amount of time for treatment planning was 61-120min, for quality assurance was 50-60min, and for treatment was 30min. There were 14 (0.6% of all cases) reported Grade 5 complications: 11 cases of radiation pneumonitis, 2 cases of hemoptysis, and 1 case of radiation esophagitis. Conclusion: The current status of SBRT in Japan was surveyed.Â«Â less\n\n50 CFR 37.13 - Group participation.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2011 CFR\n\n2011-10-01\n\n... 50 Wildlife and Fisheries 8 2011-10-01 2011-10-01 false Group participation. 37.13 Section 37.13 Wildlife and Fisheries UNITED STATES FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE, DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR (CONTINUED) THE NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE SYSTEM GEOLOGICAL AND GEOPHYSICAL EXPLORATION OF THE COASTAL PLAIN, ARCTIC...\n\n50 CFR 37.13 - Group participation.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-10-01\n\n... 50 Wildlife and Fisheries 6 2010-10-01 2010-10-01 false Group participation. 37.13 Section 37.13 Wildlife and Fisheries UNITED STATES FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE, DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR (CONTINUED) THE NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE SYSTEM GEOLOGICAL AND GEOPHYSICAL EXPLORATION OF THE COASTAL PLAIN, ARCTIC...\n\nA Conceptual Scheme for an Adaptation of Participation Training in Adult Education for Use in the Three Love Movement of Japan.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nKamitsuka, Arthur Jun\n\nThis study concentrated on developing a conceptual scheme for adapting participation training, an adult education approach based on democratic concepts and practices, to the Three Love Movement (Love of God, Love of Soil, Love of Man) in Japan.

Although some studies showed that the earthquake increased the risk of pneumonia death, no study reported whether and how much a tsunami increased the risk. We examined the risk for pneumonia death after the earthquake/tsunami. Design This is an ecological study. Setting Data on population and pneumonia deaths obtained from the Vital Statistics 2010 and 2012, National Census 2010 and Basic Resident Register 2010 and 2012 in Japan. Participants About 5.7 million participants residing in Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima Prefectures during 1â year after the disaster were targeted. All municipalities (n=131) were categorised into inland (n=93), that is, the earthquake-impacted area, and coastal types (n=38), that is, the earthquake-impacted and tsunami-impacted area. Outcome measures The number of pneumonia deaths per week was totalled from 12 March 2010 to 9 March 2012. The number of observed pneumonia deaths (O) and the sum of the sex and age classes in the observed population multiplied by the sex and age classes of expected pneumonia mortality (E) were calculated. Expected pneumonia mortality was the pneumonia mortality during the year before. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated for pneumonia deaths (O/E), adjusting for sex and age using the indirect method. SMRs were then calculated by coastal and inland municipalities. Results 6603 participants died of pneumonia during 1â year after the earthquake. SMRs increased significantly during the 1stâ12th weeks. In the 2nd week, SMRs in coastal and inland municipalities were 2.49 (95% CI 2.02 to 7.64) and 1.48 (95% CI 1.24 to 2.61), respectively. SMRs of coastal municipalities were higher than those of inland municipalities. Conclusions An earthquake increased the risk of pneumonia death and tsunamis additionally increased the risk.

We e-mailed a questionnaire to member institutions of the Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group in September, 2013. The questionnaire consisted of 50 multiple-choice questions covering therapeutic environment, antimicrobial prophylaxis, screening test during neutropenia, empirical therapy for febrile neutropenia, and the use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor. The results were compared to those of previous surveys conducted in 2001 and 2007, and also to the recommendations described in the guidelines. Usable responses were received from 141 out of 222 (63.5%) institutions. Chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia was performed in protective environment in 90% of the institutions, which increased compared to previous survey (76%). Fluoroquinolones and fluconazole were the most commonly used antimicrobial agents for antibacterial and antifungal prophylaxis, followed by sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and itraconazole, respectively. In empirical therapy for febrile neutropenia, monotherapy with Î²-lactum antibiotics was the first-line therapy in most of the institutions. While empirical antifungal therapy was adopted for persistent fever in more than half of the institutions, preemptive/presumptive therapy was also used in approximately 40% of the institutions. Most of the clinicians were reluctant to use granulocyte-colony stimulating factor routinely in chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia. This study clarified the current clinical practices of infectious complications during chemotherapy for acute leukemia and would provide important information for the development of a suitable guideline in Japan.\n\nProfessional attitudes to patient participation groups: an exploratory study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWood, J.; Metcalfe, D. H. H.\n\n1980-01-01\n\nAn exploratory study of the development of patient participation groups in general practice and general practitioners' attitudes towards them suggests that many general practitioners may not yet be aware of this innovation and may at first react negatively to the idea. This response stems in part from misconceptions about the origins and functions of these groups, a failure to see their relevance to professional objectives, and a fear that they will threaten general practitioners' autonomy and status. In contrast, general practitioners who have formed groups believe they have an important contribution to make to their developing role and have been encouraged by their experience so far. Therefore, at present, patient participation groups should neither be rejected out of hand, nor welcomed as a panacea.

Three facilitators and 2 sub-facilitators who conducted the group intervention for breast cancer patients were qualitatively and inductively analyzed using a phenomenological approach. As a result, \"hard effort,\" \"harmony of the whole group\" and \"collaboration between therapists\" were extracted as the partnership functions of participants that work on the creation of group dynamics in psycho-social group interventions. There was a structure in which \"harmony of the whole group\" and \"collaboration between therapists\" coexisted based on the basic attitude of \"hard effort.\" It was considered that these 3 intervention forms are involved in group dynamics in which participants can easily hold discussions, and are techniques necessary for group intervention contributing to changes in the psychological distress and the coping of participants.\n\nGroup members' questions shape participation in health counselling and health education.\n\nPubMed\n\nLogren, Aija; Ruusuvuori, Johanna; Laitinen, Jaana\n\n2017-10-01\n\nThis study examines how group members' questions shape member participation in health counselling and health education groups. The study applies conversation analytic principles as a method. The data consist of video-recorded health education lessons in secondary school and health counselling sessions for adults with a high risk of Type 2 diabetes. Group members' questions accomplish a temporary change in participatory roles. They are used to 1) request counselling, 2) do counselling or 3) challenge previous talk. They are usually treated as relevant and legitimate actions by the participants, but are occasionally interpreted as transitions outside the current action or topic. Group members' questions result in a shift from leader-driven to member-driven discussion. Thus they constitute a pivot point for detecting changes in participation in group interventions. Observing the occurrence of group members' questions helps group leaders to adjust their own actions accordingly and thus facilitate or guide group participation. Comparison of the type and frequency of members' questions is a way to detect different trajectories for delivering group interventions and can thus be used to develop methods for process evaluation of interventions.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment option for patients with SAD. In the present study, we examined the efficacy of group CBT for patients with generalized SAD in Japan at 1-year follow-up and investigated predictors with regard to outcomes. Methods This study was conducted as a single-arm, naturalistic, follow-up study in a routine Japanese clinical setting. A total of 113 outpatients with generalized SAD participated in group CBT from July 2003 to August 2010 and were assessed at follow-ups for up to 1 year. Primary outcome was the total score on the Social Phobia Scale/Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SPS/SIAS) at 1 year. Possible baseline predictors were investigated using mixed-model analyses. Results Among the 113 patients, 70 completed the assessment at the 1-year follow-up. The SPS/SIAS scores showed significant improvement throughout the follow-ups for up to 1 year. The effect sizes of SPS/SIAS at the 1-year follow-up were 0.68 (95% confidence interval 0.41â0.95)/0.76 (0.49â1.03) in the intention-to-treat group and 0.77 (0.42â1.10)/0.84 (0.49â1.18) in completers. Older age at baseline, late onset, and lower severity of SAD were significantly associated with good outcomes as a result of mixed-model analyses. Conclusions CBT for patients with generalized SAD in Japan is effective for up to 1 year after treatment. The effect sizes were as large as those in previous studies conducted in Western countries. Older age at baseline, late onset, and lower severity of SAD were predictors for a good outcome from group CBT.

Quantitative and qualitative approaches were utilized. In the quantitative study (n = 149), multiple logistic regression analyses estimated the impact of length of residence and arrival age on MetS. For the qualitative study, five focus group discussions were conducted with participants (n = 26) from the quantitative study sample. The oldest arrival age group was more likely to have MetS (OR, 95% CI 4.41, 1.09-17.78) after adjusting for covariates; whereas, length of residence had no association with MetS. The oldest arrival age group, with shorter residence period, was also associated with increased MetS prevalence. Qualitative results identified participants' Brazilian dietary habits as being potential risk factors for MetS. Japanese-Brazilian immigrant men with older arrival age in Japan were more likely to suffer from MetS, especially shortly after arrival.\n\nGroup cohesion and between session homework activities predict self-reported cognitive-behavioral skill use amongst participants of SMART Recovery groups.\n\nPubMed\n\nKelly, Peter J; Deane, Frank P; Baker, Amanda L\n\n2015-04-01\n\nSMART Recovery groups are cognitive-behaviorally oriented mutual support groups for individuals with addictions. The aim of the study was to assess the extent to which the quality of group facilitation, group cohesion and the use of between session homework activities contribute to self-rated use of cognitive-behavioral skills amongst group participants. Participants attending SMART Recovery groups in Australia completed a cross sectional survey (N=124). The survey included measures of cognitive and behavioral skill utilization, group cohesion, quality of group facilitation and a rating of how frequently participants leave group meetings with an achievable between session homework plan. On average, participants had been attending SMART Recovery meetings for 9 months. Participants were most likely to attend SMART Recovery for problematic alcohol use. Regression analyses indicated that group cohesion significantly predicted use of cognitive restructuring, but that only provision of homework at the end of each group session predicted self-reported behavioral activation. Both group cohesion and leaving a group with an achievable homework plan predicted participant use of cognitive behavioral skills. The concrete actions associated with homework activities may facilitate behavioral activation. There is a need for longitudinal research to examine the relationship between the utilization of cognitive and behavioral skills and participant outcomes (e.g. substance use, mental health) for people attending SMART Recovery groups.

In such a well-defined morphological species, numerous unexpected ITS variations were revealed: 12 ITS sequence types detected in 254 isolates collected from 15 local populations were classified into five ITS sequence groups. Maximally, four ITS groups consisted of seven ITS types coexisting in one population. However, group 1 was dominant with approximately 65%; in particular, one haplotype, 1a, was most dominant with approximately 60% in respective populations. Therefore, few differences were recognized in genetic structure among local populations, implying that the gene flow of each lineage of the fungus occurs among local populations without geographic limitations. However, minor haplotypes in some ITS groups were found only in restricted areas, suggesting that they might expand steadily from their places of origin to neighboring A. mariesii forests. Aggregating sequence data of seven European strains and four North American strains from various substrates to those of Japanese strains, 18 ITS sequence types and 28 variable sites were recognized. They were clustered into nine lineages by phylogenetic analyses of the beta-tubulin and combined ITS and beta-tubulin datasets. According to phylogenetic species recognition by the concordance of genealogies, respective lineages correspond to phylogenetic species. Plural phylogenetic species coexist in a local population in an A. mariesii forest in Japan.\n\nA Comparison of Voice Activity and Participation Profiles Among Etiological Groups.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Seung Jin; Choi, Hong-Shik; Kim, HyangHee\n\n2018-05-11\n\nThe purpose of this study was to determine whether patients with functional voice disorders show voice activity and participation profiles different from those of the organic and neurogenic groups. The Korean Version of the Voice Activity and Participation Profile (K-VAPP) was administered to 200 participants (150 patients with functional, organic, and neurogenic voice disorders, 50 for each etiological group, 50 controls without vocal complaint). The K-VAPP subscale scores of the etiological groups were compared, controlling for age, professional use of voice, and severity of voice disorder measured by overall severity of the Consensus Auditory-Perceptual Evaluation of Voice (CAPE-V). Results of a one-way analysis of variance indicated significant differences in the overall severity across groups (neurogenicâ>âfunctionalâ=âorganicâ>âcontrol). Among four groups, the organic group showed higher mean Z-scores of the K-VAPP than the control group, and the functional group showed higher mean Z-scores of the K-VAPP than the organic group. Compared with the neurogenic group, the functional group showed lower mean Z-scores for total score, Activity Limitation Score, SUB3, and SUB5. A comparison among three etiological groups showed that the functional group did not show higher scores than the organic group. On the contrary, the functional group showed a lower total score, Participation Restriction Score, and score for subsection 3 (effect on daily communication) than the neurogenic group. Psychometric assessment of voice disorders using the K-VAPP could provide clinicians with baseline information that is applicable to various voice disorders. Further studies pertaining to the follow-up of voice disorders with various etiologies are needed to extend its clinical usefulness. Copyright Â© 2018 The Voice Foundation. Published by Elsevier Inc.

This paper describes the occupational therapy groups programme at an inpatient brain injury rehabilitation unit and presents an evaluation from the patient's perspective. Participants were in patients with traumatic brain injury who participated in the groups programme and completed a customised self-report questionnaire measuring perceptions about and satisfaction with four occupational therapy groups. Data were analysed descriptively and comparisons made between groups with a functional focus (meal preparation and community access) and an impairment focus (cognitive and upper limb) using Z scores. Thirty-five participants (30 males, five females) completed a total of 83 questionnaires. Over 90% of responses agreed or strongly agreed that working with others was enjoyable, that the groups provided feedback and individualised treatment, and were useful for them. There were no significant differences in perceptions about the functional and impairment-focussed groups. An illustrative case example of participation in the groups programme is presented. Overall, consumer feedback on different aspects of the occupational therapy groups programme in brain injury rehabilitation was positive. Further in-depth investigation of patient perceptions of groups including processes that facilitate or challenge participation is warranted.

Both groups participated in the SMARPP at the Center Hospital, National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry. Results showed that, no significant differences were found in the rates of participation in the program or self-reported frequency of drug or alcohol use between the patients abusing \"dappou drugs\" or MAP. However, patients using \"dappou drugs\" reported no significant increase in their confidence in their ability to resist the temptation to use drugs on the self- report drug abuse scales after the SMARPP intervention, while patients abusing MAP reported a significant positive difference in their ability to resist temptation. In addition, insight into substance abuse problems and motivation to participate in further treatment slightly declined in those using \"dappou drugs,\" while there was a significant increase reported by the patients using MAP. These results suggested that the SMARPP might not be as effective for patients abusing \"dappou drugs\" as for those abusing MAP. The development of a relapse prevention program specifically designed for patients abusing \"dappou drugs\" is required.\n\nInfluence of group cohesion on maternal well-being among participants in a support/education group program for single mothers.\n\nPubMed\n\nLipman, Ellen L; Waymouth, Marjorie; Gammon, Tara; Carter, Patricia; Secord, Margaret; Leung, Olivia; Mills, Brenda; Hicks, Frances\n\n2007-10-01\n\nSingle mothers are at increased risk of psychosocial disadvantage, social isolation and physical and mental health difficulties. The authors present (1) the results of group cohesion assessments completed by mothers participating in a trial of community-based support/education groups, and (2) assessments of the association between group cohesion ratings and intervention outcomes of maternal self-evaluations of well-being (mood, self-esteem, and social support) and parenting. Mothers participating in groups completed the Group Atmosphere Scale, a measure of group cohesion, post-group. Overall, most participants provided strong ratings of group cohesion. Significant associations were found between group cohesion and specific positive outcomes. This suggests a positive association between group cohesion and mood, self-esteem, social support, and parenting, in this trial.\n\nVirtual Versus In-Person Focus Groups: Comparison of Costs, Recruitment, and Participant Logistics\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPoehlman, Jon A; Hayes, Jennifer J; Ray, Sarah E; Moultrie, Rebecca R\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBackground Virtual focus groupsâsuch as online chat and video groupsâare increasingly promoted as qualitative research tools. Theoretically, virtual groups offer several advantages, including lower cost, faster recruitment, greater geographic diversity, enrollment of hard-to-reach populations, and reduced participant burden. However, no study has compared virtual and in-person focus groups on these metrics. Objective To rigorously compare virtual and in-person focus groups on cost, recruitment, and participant logistics. We examined 3 focus group modes and instituted experimental controls to ensure a fair comparison. Methods We conducted 6 1-hour focus groups in August 2014 using in-person (n=2), live chat (n=2), and video (n=2) modes with individuals who had type 2 diabetes (n=48 enrolled, n=39 completed). In planning groups, we solicited bids from 6 virtual platform vendors and 4 recruitment firms. We then selected 1 platform or facility per mode and a single recruitment firm across all modes. To minimize bias, the recruitment firm employed different recruiters by mode who were blinded to recruitment efforts for other modes. We tracked enrollment during a 2-week period. A single moderator conducted all groups using the same guide, which addressed the use of technology to communicate with health care providers. We conducted the groups at the same times of day on Monday to Wednesday during a single week. At the end of each group, participants completed a short survey. Results Virtual focus groups offered minimal cost savings compared with in-person groups (US $2000 per chat group vs US $2576 per in-person group vs US $2,750 per video group). Although virtual groups did not incur travel costs, they often had higher management fees and miscellaneous expenses (eg, participant webcams). Recruitment timing did not differ by mode, but show rates were higher for in-person groups (94% [15/16] in-person vs 81% [13/16] video vs 69% [11/16] chat).

Understanding individuals diagnosed with diabetes experiences of group-based education for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus may guide the development and facilitation of these programs. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with all individuals who participated in the intervention. Using thematic analysis underpinned by self-determination theory, we developed themes that explored participants' motivators in relation to diabetes management and the impact of group interactions on their experiences and motivation. The key themes included knowledge, experience, group interactions and motivation. Participants perceived that the group interactions facilitated further learning and increased motivation, achieved through normalization, peer identification or by talking with, and learning from the experience of others. The results support the use of patient-centred programs that prioritize group interactions over the didactic presentation of content, which may address relevant psychological needs of people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and improve their motivation and health behaviours. Future group-based education programs may benefit from the use of self-determination theory as a framework for intervention design to enhance participant motivation.\n\nVirtual Versus In-Person Focus Groups: Comparison of Costs, Recruitment, and Participant Logistics.\n\nPubMed\n\nRupert, Douglas J; Poehlman, Jon A; Hayes, Jennifer J; Ray, Sarah E; Moultrie, Rebecca R\n\n2017-03-22\n\nVirtual focus groups-such as online chat and video groups-are increasingly promoted as qualitative research tools.
