        "text": "Aging gracefully: a comparative study of Japanese and Malaysian women aged 65-75.\n\nPubMed\n\nKok, Jin Kuan; Yap, Yuet Ngor\n\n2014-12-01\n\nLonger lives and extended retirement have created a 'young old age' stage of life. How people spend their \"young old age\" has become increasingly important. This research aims to investigate the different ageing experiences of Japanese and Malaysian women and the activities they engaged in their \"young old age\". In-depth interviews were conducted to collect data and an adapted grounded theory approach was used for data analysis. Findings reveal many common characteristics for both groups of research participants. The emerging themes show that Japanese and Malaysian Chinese have different life missions evident in their daily activities, one passing on culture and the other passing on family values and life experience. They also differ in their choice of living arrangement (independent versus dependent/interdependent), attitudes to life (fighting versus accepting) and activities in which to engage (aesthetic pursuits versus family oriented activities).

Subjects and Methods A cross-sectional study. We compared neuromuscular risk factors for falls using performance-based measures (chair stand time, usual and rapid walking speed, and grip strength) among 163 Japanese women in Japan, 681 Japanese-American women in Hawaii and 9403 Caucasian women in the United States aged 65 years and over. Results After adjusting for age, the Caucasian women required about 40% more time to complete 5 chair stands than either group of Japanese. Walking speed was about 10% slower among Caucasians than native Japanese, whereas Japanese-American women in Hawaii walked about 11% faster than native Japanese. Grip strength was greatest in Japan, which may reflect the rural farming district that this sample was drawn from. Additional adjustment for height, weight or body mass index increased the adjusted means of chair stand time and grip strength among Japanese, but the differences remained significant. Conclusions Both native Japanese and Japanese-American women in Hawaii performed better than Caucasians on chair stand time and walking speed tests, and native Japanese had greater grip strength than Japanese in Hawaii and Caucasians. The biological implications of these differences in performance are uncertain, but may be useful in planning future comparisons between populations.

Their designs are based on men's anthropometrical data, and this does not assure safety and amenity of women's working environments. Moreover, few data on women's body measurements are available. The Research Institute of Human Engineering for Quality Life is carrying out an ergonomic anthropometrical study on a large number of Japanese people to create a database for industrial use. The fee for the use of these data is, however, making it very difficult to profit from their acquisition. Therefore, we conducted an anthropometrical study for industrial design use on middle-aged female subjects, who are in the most difficult age group to access. This report should be useful in designing working spaces and tools for women as laborers as well as users.\n\nFood-based diet quality score in relation to depressive symptoms in young and middle-aged Japanese women.\n\nPubMed\n\nSakai, Hiroka; Murakami, Kentaro; Kobayashi, Satomi; Suga, Hitomi; Sasaki, Satoshi\n\n2017-06-01\n\nOnly a few studies have focused on the association between overall diet, rather than intakes of individual nutrients or foods, and depressive symptoms in Japanese. This cross-sectional study examined associations between a diet quality score and depressive symptoms in 3963 young (age 18 years) and 3833 middle-aged (mean age 47Â·9 (sd 4Â·2) years) Japanese women. Dietary information was collected using a diet history questionnaire. A previously developed diet quality score was computed mainly based on the Japanese Food Guide Spinning Top. The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 22Â·0 % for young women and 16Â·8 % for middle-aged women, assessed as a Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) score â¥23 and â¥19, respectively. As expected, the diet quality score was associated positively with intakes of 'grain dishes', 'vegetable dishes', 'fish and meat dishes', 'milk' and 'fruits' and inversely with intakes of energy from 'snacks, confection and beverages' and Na from seasonings. After adjustment for potential confounders, OR for depressive symptoms in the highest v. lowest quintiles of the diet quality score was 0Â·65 (95 % CI 0Â·50, 0Â·84) in young women (P for trend=0Â·0005). In middle-aged women, the corresponding value was 0Â·59 (95 % CI 0Â·45, 0Â·78) (P for trend<0Â·0001). Analyses where the diet quality and CES-D scores were treated as continuous variables also showed inverse associations. In conclusion, this cross-sectional study showed that a higher diet quality score was associated with a lower prevalence of depressive symptoms in young and middle-aged Japanese women. Prospective studies are needed to confirm a public health relevance of this finding.\n\nDevelopment of a food-based diet quality score for Japanese: associations of the score with nutrient intakes in young, middle-aged and older Japanese women.\n\nPubMed\n\nKuriyama, Nozomi; Murakami, Kentaro; Livingstone, M Barbara E; Okubo, Hitomi; Kobayashi, Satomi; Suga, Hitomi; Sasaki, Satoshi\n\n2016-01-01\n\nSeveral previous studies have shown that a diet score based on the Japanese food guide Spinning Top (the original score) is associated with both favourable and unfavourable dietary intake patterns. We developed a food-based diet quality score (the modified score) and examined associations with nutrient intakes. Subjects were 3963 young (all aged 18 years), 3800 middle-aged (mean age 47Â·7 (sd 3Â·9) years) and 2211 older (mean age 74Â·4 (sd 5Â·2) years) Japanese women. Dietary intakes were assessed using comprehensive (for the young and middle-aged) and brief-type (for the older) diet history questionnaires. The original score was calculated based on intakes of grains, vegetables, fish/meat, milk, fruits, and snacks/alcoholic beverages. The modified score was similarly calculated, but included Na from seasonings and without applying the upper cut-off values for dietary components where increased consumption is advocated for Japanese women (grains, vegetables, fish/meat, milk, and fruits). The original score was positively associated with intakes of carbohydrate, dietary fibre, and all the vitamins and minerals examined including Na and inversely with intakes of fats and alcohol in young and middle-aged women. In older women, the original score was inversely associated with intakes of all nutrients except for carbohydrate and vitamin C. However, the modified score was associated positively with intakes of protein, carbohydrate, dietary fibre, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, vitamins A, C and E, and folate and inversely with intakes of fats, alcohol and Na in all generations. In conclusion, the modified diet score was positively associated with favourable nutrient intake patterns in Japanese women.\n\nExtrinsic skin ageing in German, Chinese and Japanese women manifests differently in all three groups depending on ethnic background, age and anatomical site.\n\nPubMed\n\nVierkÃ¶tter, Andrea; HÃ¼ls, Anke; Yamamoto, Ai; Stolz, Sabine; KrÃ¤mer, Ursula; Matsui, Mary S; Morita, Akimichi; Wang, Sijia; Li, Zhiwen; Jin, Li; Krutmann, Jean; Schikowski, Tamara\n\n2016-09-01\n\nIt has been suggested that extrinsic skin ageing manifests differently in Caucasians versus East Asians. In particular, from previous studies it was concluded that Caucasians are more prone to develop wrinkles, whereas pigment spot formation is the hallmark of extrinsic skin ageing in East Asians. However, these assumptions are based on a very limited number of studies which did not include different East Asian populations. We here compare the manifestation of extrinsic skin ageing signs in German, Japanese and Chinese women by specifically elucidating the age and anatomical site dependence of any potential ethnic difference. In the present study, we assessed skin ageing in N=902 German, N=165 Japanese and N=1260 Chinese women ranging from 30 to 90 years by means of SCINEXAâ¢. Linear regression analysis was used to test for ethnic differences and their age and site dependence adjusted for educational level, sun exposure, smoking and sun protection behaviours. Pigment spots and wrinkles on the face were present among all three ethnic groups and differences were influenced by age and anatomical sites independently of further influencing factors. Pigment spots on the forehead were most pronounced over the whole age range in Chinese and German women and least developed in Japanese. Pigment spots on cheeks were a typical extrinsic skin an ageing sign in the two East Asian populations in all age groups. However, in older German women they reach the same level as observed in the two East Asian populations. In contrast, pigment spots on arms and hands were significantly more pronounced in German women â¥45years of age. Wrinkles were not exclusively a skin an ageing sign of German women, but were also very pronounced in Chinese women on forehead, between the eyebrows and in the crow's feet area. These results corroborate the previous notion that the occurrence of pigments spots and wrinkles is different between Caucasians and East Asians. In addition, this study shows\n\nSocioeconomic status inconsistency and risk of stroke among Japanese middle-aged women.\n\nPubMed\n\nHonjo, Kaori; Iso, Hiroyasu; Inoue, Manami; Sawada, Norie; Tsugane, Shoichiro\n\n2014-09-01\n\nLittle research has been conducted to examine the effect of inconsistencies in socioeconomic status on cardiovascular health. In particular, no studies have been reported in Asian countries, including Japan, which is thought to have high socioeconomic status inconsistency among women. We examined the effect of status inconsistency between education level and occupation on stroke risk in a prospective 20-year study of 14 742 middle-aged Japanese women included in the prospective Japan Public Health Center-based (JPHC) Study Cohort I in 1990. Status inconsistency between education level and occupation was determined (qualified, overqualified, and underqualified), and the association with risk of stroke was examined. Cox proportional regression analysis was used to determine hazard ratios, which were adjusted for age, marital status, and geographical area. Adjusted hazard ratio for stroke in overqualified compared with qualified women was 2.06 (95% confidence interval, 1.13-3.78). Adjusted hazard ratios for stroke among highly educated manual workers and workers in service industry were 3.47 (95% confidence interval, 1.54-7.84) and 3.21 (95% confidence interval, 1.49-6.90), respectively, when compared with highly educated professionals/managers. High academic qualifications without an appropriate job could be a risk factor for stroke among Japanese women. Our result suggests that status inconsistency could be a potential explanation for the increased stroke risk among highly educated women.

In this study we examine women's changing gender and intergenerational relationships and how these affect their concerns and hopes for their futures. Many of the 121 midlife women (aged 45-55) interviewed viewed themselves as sandwiched between their mothers-in-law and actual or potential daughters-in-law, at the nadir of intergenerational status within their families, in large part due to changing social patterns in marriage and birth rates. Doubts about the marriageability of their sons arising from role expectations for brides to care for parents-in-law cause concern for many and highlight the gendered and intergenerational nature of aging concerns. Yet, midlife in the 21st century, with changing gender and intergenerational roles, appears to create opportunities for many Japanese women to reflect on the meaning of the next stage of their lives. Changing gender and intergenerational relationships may contribute to their hopes to live a life of self-actualization and to be true to one's self (jibun rashiku ikiru).\n\nImpact of back muscle strength and aging on locomotive syndrome in community living Japanese women.\n\nPubMed\n\nHirano, Kenichi; Imagama, Shiro; Hasegawa, Yukiharu; Wakao, Norimitsu; Muramoto, Akio; Ishiguro, Naoki\n\n2013-02-01\n\nThe Japanese Orthopaedic Association has proposed the term locomotive syndrome (LS) to designate a condition of individuals in high-risk groups with musculoskeletal disease who are highly likely to require nursing care. This study investigates the influence of spinal factors on LS in Japanese females. A total of 187 women > or =50 years old were enrolled in the study. Those answering yes to least one of the 7 categories in the self-assessment checklist for LS were defined as having LS. We evaluated lateral lumbar radiographs, sagittal parameters, sagittal balance using the spinal inclination angle (SIA) as an index, spinal range of motion (ROM) as determined with SpinalMouse, back muscle strength (BMS), and body mass index (BMI). Age, BMI, BMS, SIA, sacral slope angle (SSA), and lumbar spinal ROM showed significant correlations with LS. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that an increase in age (OR 1.054, p<0.05) and a decrease in BMS (OR 0.968, p<0.01) were significantly associated with LS. Age had significant negative correlations with BMS, SSA, thoracic and lumbar spinal ROM, and it had positive correlations with BMI, SIA, and lumbar kyphosis. BMS had significant negative correlations with age, SIA, thoracic and lumbar kyphosis, and it had positive correlations with SSA, lumbar and total spinal ROM. An increase in age and a decrease in BMS may be the most important risk factors for LS in Japanese women. Back muscle strengthening and spinal ROM exercises could be useful for improving the status of an individual suffering from LS.\n\nEmployment situation and risk of death among middle-aged Japanese women.\n\nPubMed\n\nHonjo, Kaori; Iso, Hiroyasu; Ikeda, Ai; Fujino, Yoshihisa; Tamakoshi, Akiko\n\n2015-10-01\n\nFew studies have examined the health effects of employment situation among women, taking social and economic conditions into consideration. The objective of this research was to investigate the association of employment situation (full-time or part-time employee and self-employed) with mortality risk in women over a 20-year follow-up period. Additionally, we examined whether the association between employment situation and mortality in women differed by education level and marital status. We investigated the association of employment situation with mortality among 16,692 women aged 40-59â years enrolled in the Japan Collaborative Cohort Study. Multivariate HRs and 95% CIs for total deaths by employment situation were calculated after adjustment for age, disease history, residential area, education level, marital status and number of children. We also conducted subgroup analysis by education level and marital status. Multivariate HRs for mortality of part-time employees and self-employed workers were 1.48 (95% CI, 1.25 to 1.75) and 1.44 (95% CI, 1.21 to 1.72), respectively, with reference to women working full-time. Subgroup analysis by education level indicated that health effects in women according to employment situation were likely to be more evident in the low education-level group. Subgroup analysis by marital status indicated that this factor also affected the association between employment situation and risk of death. Among middle-aged Japanese women, employment situation was associated with mortality risk. Health effects were likely to differ by household structure and socioeconomic conditions.

The present study was aimed to clarify the views of Japanese women of reproductive age on UTx for uterine factor infertility. Methods A questionnaire on UTx was conducted by an Internet research company in December 2014 as a cross-sectional study in 3,892 randomly chosen women aged 25 to 39 years old. Responses were analyzed from 3,098 subjects (mean age 32.1Â±4.2 years old), after exclusion of inappropriate respondents in screening. Results Of the respondents, 62.1%, 34.7% and 18.1% favored adoption, UTx and gestational surrogacy, respectively. In contrast, 7.0%, 21.9% and 63.3% opposed adoption, UTx and gestational surrogacy, respectively. In choices of candidates for UTx based on highest priority, deceased persons (33.8%) and mothers (19.0%) were favored as donors, and women with congenital absence of the uterus (54.4%) and hysterectomy due to a malignant uterine tumor (20.0%) as recipients. Regarding societal acceptance of UTx, the answer rates were 15.7% for \"UTx should be permitted\", 77.6% for \"UTx should be permitted with discussion\", and 6.7% for \"UTx should not be permitted, even with discussion\". Regarding personal opinions on UTx, 44.2% were in favor, 47.5% had no opinion, and 8.3% were against. Conclusion Our results suggest that many Japanese women of reproductive age feel that UTx is socially and individually acceptable, but that concerns requiring further discussion remain among these women. There was also a tendency for UTx to be viewed more favorably than gestational surrogacy.

Moreover, the average BMI of Japanese women is lower than that of Japanese men, and the age-specific BMI of Japanese women has decreased over time. The average BMI of Japanese women at age 25 decreased from 21.8 in 1948 to 20.4 in 2010 whereas that of men increased from 21.4 to 22.3 over the same period. We examine the long-term BMI trend in Japan by combining several historical data sources spanning eleven decades, from 1901 to 2012, to determine not only when but also how the BMI decline among women began: whether its inception was period-specific or cohort-specific. Our nonparametric regression analysis generated five findings. First, the BMI of Japanese women peaked with the 1930s birth cohort. This means that the trend is cohort-specific. Second, the BMI of men outpaced that of women in the next cohort. Third, the BMI of Japanese children, boys and girls alike, increased steadily throughout the 20th century. Fourth, the gender difference in the BMI trend is due to a gender difference in the weight trend, not the height trend. Fifth, these BMI trends are observed in urban and rural populations alike. We conclude that the BMI decline among Japanese women began with those who were in their late teens shortly after World War II. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Women of childbearing age tend to have a lower intake of protein and their total energy intake is lower than the requirements established by the 2015 Dietary Reference Intakes for Japanese. There is a growing body of evidence showing that underweight women tend to bear small babies and that these babies have an increased risk of diabetes or cancer in their adulthood. In order to prevent Japanese women from bearing small babies, the literature has suggested that women of childbearing age should be encouraged to remain at a normal weight before pregnancy. For optimal weight gain during pregnancy, existing guidelines recommend different ranges of weight gain based on prepregnancy BMI. Owing to the absence of official GWG recommendations in Asian countries, including China and Taiwan, the US Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines are generally followed. However, Asian women are smaller and experience lower weight gains; therefore, excessive weight gain may lead to harmful events including macrosomia, preterm birth, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, pregnancy-induced hypertension, and short- and long-term postpartum weight retention. Thus, an accurate GWG range should be determined for Asian women. We introduce one epidemiological study in which the optimal weight gain range was investigated by analyzing receiver-operating characteristic curves together with potential research ideas in this field with the aim of encouraging young researchers to solve this public health problem affecting mothers and children.\n\nPrevalence of premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder in Japanese women.\n\nPubMed\n\nTakeda, T; Tasaka, K; Sakata, M; Murata, Y\n\n2006-07-01\n\nTo investigate the prevalence and impact of premenstrual symptoms in Japanese women, we developed the PSQ \"The Premenstrual Symptoms Questionnaire\" for the screening of premenstrual symptoms. The PSQ translates DSM-IV criteria into a rating scale with degrees of severity. One thousand one hundred and eighty-seven Japanese women between the ages of 20 and 49 yrs, who were seen at a clinic for uterine cancer screening, were assessed regarding their premenstrual symptoms using the PSQ. As many as 95% of these women were found to suffer from premenstrual symptoms. The rates of prevalence of moderate to severe PMS and PMDD in Japanese women were 5.3 and 1.2%, respectively, which are lower than those in Western women. Only 5.3% of women with moderate to severe PMS and PMDD were treated. The results of this study suggest that race and ethnicity influence the expression of premenstrual symptoms and that the current state of medical care for Japanese women with moderate to severe PMS and PMDD is not satisfactory.\n\nJapanese women's perceptions of intimate partner violence (IPV).\n\nPubMed\n\nNagae, Miyoko; Dancy, Barbara L\n\n2010-04-01\n\nIntimate partner violence (IPV) is a problem in Japan. The purpose is to describe IPV as perceived by a purposive sample of 11 Japanese adult females who were in a heterosexual marriage at the time of IPV. We used a cross-sectional, retroactive, qualitative description research design with individual, fact-to-face in depth interviews. At the time of the interview, the women had a mean age of 38 years and at the time of the IPV, a mean age of 28 years. Data were analyzed using the directed qualitative content analysis method. The results revealed that all women experienced physical and emotional abuse and 82% experienced sexual abuse. Communication between spouses was characterized as unilateral, with husbands initiating and dominating the conversation. The women identified the culture of the Japanese patriarchal system as directly influencing IPV. The implication is health professionals should actively advocate for effective legislation and policies to address IPV.\n\nPhysical Performance Measures Associated With Locomotive Syndrome in Middle-Aged and Older Japanese Women.\n\nPubMed\n\nNakamura, Misa; Hashizume, Hiroshi; Oka, Hiroyuki; Okada, Morihiro; Takakura, Rie; Hisari, Ayako; Yoshida, Munehito; Utsunomiya, Hirotoshi\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe Japanese Orthopaedic Association proposed a concept called locomotive syndrome (LS) to identify middle-aged and older adults at high risk of requiring health care services because of problems with locomotion. It is important to identify factors associated with the development of LS. Physical performance measures such as walking speed and standing balance are highly predictive of subsequent disability and mortality in older adults. However, there is little evidence about the relationship between physical performance measures and LS. To determine the physical performance measures associated with LS, the threshold values for discriminating individuals with and without LS, and the odds ratio of LS according to performance greater than or less than these thresholds in middle-aged and older Japanese women. Participants were 126 Japanese women (mean age = 61.8 years). Locomotive syndrome was defined as a score of 16 or more on the 25-question Geriatric Locomotive Function Scale. Physical performance was evaluated using grip strength, unipedal stance time with eyes open, seated toe-touch, and normal and fast 6-m walk time (6 MWT). Variables were compared between LS and non-LS groups. Fourteen participants (11.1%) were classed as having LS. Unipedal stance time, normal 6 MWT, and fast 6 MWT were significantly different between the 2 groups. The LS group had a shorter unipedal stance time and a longer normal and fast 6 MWT than the non-LS group. For these 3 variables, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was greater than 0.7, and the threshold for discriminating the non-LS and LS groups was 15 s for unipedal stance time, 4.8 s for normal 6 MWT and 3.6 s for fast 6 MWT. These variables were entered into a multiple logistic regression analysis, which indicated that unipedal stance time less than 15 s was significantly related to LS (odds ratio = 8.46; P < .01). Unipedal stance time was the physical performance measure that was most strongly associated\n\nThe Work Values of Japanese Women.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nEngel, John W.\n\nEmpirical studies of Japanese work ethics have tended to focus on male workers while neglecting women. In addition, work values in both Japan and the United States appear to be changing. More information is needed on the work values of American and Japanese female workers. A study was conducted to explore the work ethics of Japanese women and toâ¦\n\nAssociation of unipedal standing time and bone mineral density in community-dwelling Japanese women.\n\nPubMed\n\nSakai, A; Toba, N; Takeda, M; Suzuki, M; Abe, Y; Aoyagi, K; Nakamura, T\n\n2009-05-01\n\nBone mineral density (BMD) and physical performance of the lower extremities decrease with age. In community-dwelling Japanese women, unipedal standing time, timed up and go test, and age are associated with BMD while in women aged 70 years and over, unipedal standing time is associated with BMD. The aim of this study was to clarify whether unipedal standing time is significantly associated with BMD in community-dwelling women. The subjects were 90 community-dwelling Japanese women aged 54.7 years. BMD of the second metacarpal bone was measured by computed X-ray densitometry. We measured unipedal standing time as well as timed up and go test to assess physical performance of the lower extremities. Unipedal standing time decreased with increased age. Timed up and go test significantly correlated with age. Low BMD was significantly associated with old age, short unipedal standing time, and long timed up and go test. Stepwise regression analysis revealed that age, unipedal standing time, and timed up and go test were significant factors associated with BMD. In 21 participants aged 70 years and over, body weight and unipedal standing time, but not age, were significantly associated with BMD. BMD and physical performance of the lower extremities decrease with older age. Unipedal standing time, timed up and go test, and age are associated with BMD in community-dwelling Japanese women. In women aged 70 years and over, unipedal standing time is significantly associated with BMD.\n\nAssociations of gender role attitudes with fertility intentions: A Japanese population-based study on single men and women of reproductive ages.\n\nPubMed\n\nKato, Tsuguhiko\n\n2018-06-01\n\nJapan has been experiencing low fertility for many years. In this study, I investigated the relationship between gender role attitudes and fertility intentions among Japanese single men and women of reproductive ages. Utilizing the Longitudinal Survey of Adults in the 21st Century data, 8944 men and 7924 women aged 20-34â¯years with single, childless status were analyzed. Gender role attitudes were assessed by participants' preferences for the division of labor between a man and a woman: income earning, housework, and childcare. Those who preferred men to earn income and women to perform housework and childcare were considered to have traditional attitudes, whereas those who preferred women and men to share these responsibilities were considered to have egalitarian attitudes. Outcomes were fertility intentions measured by a desire to have children and ideal number of children. Logistic regression analyses were conducted. Egalitarian attitudes about income earning and housework were associated with low fertility intentions (a lesser desire for children) compared to traditional attitudes: adjusted odds ratios were 1.56 [1.36, 1.80] for men and 1.47 [1.26, 1.72] for women with income earning. Men's preference for sharing childcare responsibility was associated with high fertility intentions. Japanese society has not shifted away from the traditional division of labor despite the increase in female labor force participation. Low fertility intentions among Japanese men and women with egalitarian attitudes suggest that institutional support for balancing work and family may be necessary to improve the low fertility trend.

This study was conducted to explore generational differences in Japanese attitudes toward women's employment and to interpret those differences in terms of social change. Questionnaires were distributed to approximately 900 Japanese men and women. Subjects were classifiedâ¦\n\nBone mass and lifestyle related factors: a comparative study between Japanese and Inner Mongolian young premenopausal women.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, M; Shimmura, T; Bi, L F; Nagase, H; Nishino, H; Kajita, E; Eto, M; Wang, H B; Su, X L; Chang, H; Aratani, T; Kagamimori, S\n\n2004-07-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the ethnic difference in bone mass between Japanese and Inner Mongolian young premenopausal women and to assess the contribution of lifestyle related and anthropometric factors to bone mass. We studied 33 Japanese and 44 Inner Mongolian healthy young women, aged 20-34 years, in urban area. Speed of sound (SOS), broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA) and stiffness index (SI) were measured at the calcaneus using quantitative ultrasound (QUS) analysis. Age at menarche, regularity of menstruation and lifestyle related factors were estimated by a self-reported questionnaire. There were no differences between the two groups in age, height, weight, BMI, regularity of menstruation, frequency of meat intake, frequency of yellow-green vegetable intake and exercise habit. Japanese women had significantly lower age at menarche and higher proportion of milk consumption habit at junior high school, senior school and present. Before adjustment, Japanese women had significantly higher SOS and SI than Inner Mongolian women. However, after adjustment for age at menarche and milk consumption habit at junior high school, both of which were significantly different between groups, no group-differences remained in either SOS or SI. These results suggest that the differences in age at menarche and milk consumption habit at junior high school, which relate to hormonal and nutritional status during puberty, may account for the differences in bone mass between Japanese and Inner Mongolian young women.\n\nBone density and body composition on the Pacific rim: a comparison between Japan-born and U.S.-born Japanese-American women.\n\nPubMed\n\nKin, K; Lee, J H; Kushida, K; Sartoris, D J; Ohmura, A; Clopton, P L; Inoue, T\n\n1993-07-01\n\nBone mineral density (BMD) of total body, spine, and proximal femur and the percentage of body fat in 151 U.S.-born Japanese-American women and 137 Japan-born immigrant Japanese-American women living in San Diego, California were measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. These data were compared with unpublished data from Japanese women obtained in previous studies in Hamamatsu, Japan. The age-adjusted BMD for the spinal level, femoral neck, Ward's triangle, trochanter, and total body, respectively, of U.S.-born Japanese-American women were 10.2, 9.8, 9.9, 9.2, and 2.7% higher than those of native Japanese women. The U.S.-born Japanese-American women had significantly higher body fat than immigrant Japanese-American women. Furthermore, the immigrant women had higher BMD and higher body fat than their native Japanese counterparts; however, no significant total-body BMD differences were found among the three groups after age, height, and weight were adjusted. The U.S.-born Japanese-American women had BMD values equivalent to those of white normals at the spine and femur. Significant life-style differences between U.S.-born and immigrant Japanese-American women were noted. Weight, exercise, early menarche, and years of lifetime estrogen exposure correlated positively with BMD. The significant negative correlates of BMD were age, smoking, and percentage of body fat. Our study presents data suggesting that immigration to the United States has produced a higher BMD in Japanese-American women that is attributable to changes in life-style and diet.\n\nFactors influencing behavioral intention to undergo Papanicolaou testing in early adulthood: Comparison of Japanese and Korean women.\n\nPubMed\n\nKang, Kyung-Ah; Kim, Shin-Jeong; Kaneko, Noriyo\n\n2017-12-01\n\nIn this study, we identified the factors influencing behavioral intention to undergo Papanicolaou testing among Japanese and Korean women in early adulthood. Their behavioral intentions were compared in this cross-sectional descriptive study. In total, 887 women (JapaneseÂ =Â 498, KoreanÂ =Â 389) aged 20-39Â years participated in this study. Using a self-report questionnaire, knowledge, attitudes, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and behavioral intention were surveyed. There were significant differences between Japanese and Korean women's scores on all main variables. For Japanese women, all the variables moderately correlated with behavioral intention. In comparison, for Korean women, all independent variables, except for knowledge, moderately correlated with behavioral intention. Through a multiple regression analysis, age, undergoing Papanicolaou testing, attitudes, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control were identified as significant predictors of behavioral intention among Japanese women. Among Korean women, job status, undergoing a Papanicolaou test, attitudes, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control were demonstrated as significant predictors of behavioral intention. Health professionals should consider these factors to encourage Papanicolaou testing in women in early adulthood.

The objective of this study was to investigate age-related changes in abdominal fat distribution of Japanese men and women of the general population over a wide range of body mass indices (BMI). A total of 2,220 non-diabetic, apparently healthy Japanese adults (1,240 men and 980 women; age range 40-69 years) were included in the study sample. All subjects underwent a CT scan at the level of the umbilicus, and the areas of visceral adipose tissue (AT) and subcutaneous AT were quantified. When the subjects were stratified by BMI into 18.5-23.0 kg/m(2), 23.0-27.5 kg/m(2), and 27.5 kg/m(2) or higher, visceral AT was positively correlated with age in all of the BMI strata in both genders (p<0.01). In contrast, subcutaneous AT was negatively correlated with age in men with BMIs in excess of 23.0 kg/m(2) (p<0.01) and not at all in women. The mean levels of subcutaneous AT were over 2-fold greater than visceral AT in women aged 60-69 years in any BMI stratum. In Japanese men and women, visceral AT was increased with age in all BMI strata in both genders, whereas subcutaneous AT was decreased with age in men with BMIs in excess of 23.0 kg/m(2) and not at all in women. Even with these age-related changes in abdominal fat distribution, women retained the subcutaneous-dominant type of fat distribution up to 70 years.\n\nVasomotor symptoms among Japanese-American and European-American women living in Hilo, Hawaii.\n\nPubMed\n\nSievert, Lynnette Leidy; Morrison, Lynn; Brown, Daniel E; Reza, Angela M\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe Hilo Women's Health Survey was designed and administered to gather baseline data on women's health in Hilo, HI. This randomized, cross-sectional study allowed for a focus on ethnic differences in symptom reporting. The results presented here focus on hot flash and night sweat experience among Japanese-American and European-American women. Survey packets were mailed to street addresses associated with parcel numbers pulled randomly from Hilo tax maps. Of the 6,401 survey packets delivered to households, 1,824 questionnaires were completed and returned. The results reported here are based on 869 women aged 40 to 60, of whom 249 described themselves to be 100% Japanese and 203 described themselves to be 100% European-American. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine whether the relationship between ethnicity and vasomotor symptoms persisted after controlling for other variables. European-American participants were more likely to have ever experienced a hot flash as compared with Japanese-American participants (72% vs 53%, P<0.01). During the 2 weeks before the survey, European-American participants were more likely to have experienced hot flashes (P<0.05) and night sweats (P<0.01). In logistic regression analyses, after controlling for age, body mass index, menopause status, level of education, financial comfort, smoking habits, alcohol intake, exercise, use of hormone therapy, and soy intake, European-American women were still significantly more likely to have experienced hot flashes (odds ratio=1.858) and night sweats (odds ratio=2.672). The results, based on self-reporting of menopausal symptoms, indicate that Japanese-American women report fewer hot flashes and night sweats than European-American women. Japanese-American women reported a higher intake of soy, but soy intake was not associated with fewer vasomotor symptoms.\n\nRelational experiences of partnered Japanese immigrant women with affect disorders.\n\nPubMed\n\nKozuki, Yoriko; Kennedy, Michael G; Tsai, Jenny Hsin-Chun\n\n2006-03-01\n\nThis paper reports the findings of a study that explored characteristics of relationships of Japanese immigrant women partnered both intraculturally and interculturally, and analysed the role of Japanese culture in these relationships. Immigration can cause shifts in interpersonal structures with partners. When there are large discrepancies in gender roles and communication styles between the original and host cultures, the psychological impact on both partners may be significant. However, currently no empirical data are available to support this assumption. Ten cases selected from the 68 medical records of Japanese-speaking women seen at a mental health clinic from September 2001 to September 2004 were analysed. All of the 10 women met DSM IV-TR criteria of major depressive disorder and were taking antidepressants. Half of the 10 women were in intimate intercultural partnered relationships and the remainder of the matched cases were in intracultural relationships at the time of treatment. The two cohorts were matched in age (36.2 and 43.2 years), length of stay in the United States of America (12 and 16.2 years), and length of treatment (1.2 and 1 years). The length of time of the sample in individual psychodynamic psychotherapy ranged from 20 to 317 hours, depending on the intensity of therapy. Inductive data analysis revealed two themes: (1) Lack of awareness of differences in culturally bound communication by Japanese women in intercultural partnerships; (2) Lack of individuality in Japanese women in intracultural partnerships. Neither group appeared to consider relational aspects of partnership, or to make efforts to improve direct communication with their partners. The influence of Japanese culture on gender role and communication styles functions contrary to the mainstream Western culture of the United States of America. In the future, interpersonal elements of cultural differences between host and original cultures in immigration should be considered in\n\nJapanese women's experiences of pharmacological pain relief in New Zealand.\n\nPubMed\n\nDoering, Keiko; Patterson, Jean; Griffiths, Christine R\n\n2014-06-01\n\nIn Japan, most women manage labour pain without pharmacological interventions. However, New Zealand statistics show a high percentage of epidural use amongst Asian women. Entonox (a gas mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen) and pethidine are also available to women in New Zealand. This article investigates how Japanese women in New Zealand respond to the use of pharmacological pain relief in labour. The study was guided by two research questions: (1) How do Japanese women experience and manage labour pain in New Zealand? (2) How do they feel about the use of pharmacological pain relief? Thirteen Japanese women who had given birth in New Zealand were interviewed individually or in a focus group. The conversations were analysed using thematic analysis. Although in Japan very few women use pain relief, nine women received epidural and/or Entonox out of 11 women who experienced labour pain. The contrast between their Japanese cultural expectations and their birth experiences caused some of the women subsequent personal conflict. Japanese women's cultural perspectives and passive attitudes were demonstrated to influence the decision-making process concerning pain relief. It was concluded that understanding Japanese cultural worldviews and approaches to the role of pain in labour would help maternity providers in their provision of appropriate care for Japanese women.

Participants and Methods: Participants of this study were 4,454 women aged 40-69 years, classified into the following five groups based on their occupation: unemployed, 1,432; agriculture, 439; self-employed, 1,596; white collared, 793; and blue collared, 194. Participants' perceived health was assessed using a symptoms checklist called the Todai Health Index (THI, later renamed as the Total Health Index) in a baseline survey conducted in 1993. The mortality risk of the participants was assessed using the Cox's Proportional Hazards Model. Results: The means of the percentile values on the Total Scale 1 in the THI were as follows: agriculture, 43.7; unemployed, 50.8; self-employed, 52.5; white collared, 53.0; and blue collared, 56.1, with lower percentile values indicating better perceived health. The results showed that women engaged in agriculture were in significantly better health than were those in the other four occupations. The hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals of the occupational groups adjusted for age, area of residence, and Total Scale 1 scores were as follows: agriculture (reference group), 1; white collared, 1.16 (0.77-1.74); self-employed, 1.25 (0.87-1.78); unemployed, 1.27 (0.91-1.77); and blue collared, 1.50 (0.86-2.60). Conclusions: Women engaged in agriculture had a significantly higher tendency to have a better health status on the THI as compared to those from the other four occupational groups, and they exhibited the lowest HR as compared to their counterparts, though not statistically significant. We concluded that the perceived health status of unemployed women was similar to that of women engaged in agriculture.\n\nBody size and composition in different somatotypes of Japanese college-aged women.\n\nPubMed\n\nKomiya, S; Masuda, T; Ube, M; Mitsuzono, R\n\n1996-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to determine differences in body size, composition and structure between three somatotypes of Japanese college-aged women. The study sample consisted of 30 sedentary female college students between 18 and 20 years of age. Ten subjects had an endomorphic ectomorph somatotype (mean weight 41.95 kg), 10 had an endomorph-ectomorph somatotype (mean weight 47.12 kg) and the remaining subjects had a mesomorphic endomorph somatotype (mean weight 55.37 kg). The mean heights for these groups did not differ significantly. The mesomorphic endomorph group had a higher gross weight and a higher percentage of all adipose variables than the other two groups, though these measurements were not significantly different between the endomorph-ectomorph and the endomorphic ectomorph groups. The mean lean body weight (LBW) for the mesomorphic endomorph group was significantly larger than that of the other two groups. The endomorph-ectomorph group had the next largest LBW, and the mean for the endomorphic ectomorph group was significantly smaller than that of the other two groups. Inversely, mean values of LBW/weight(WT), LBW/total adipose tissue weight (TATW) ratio and total body water/WT were significantly lower for the mesomorphic endomorph group than for the other two groups. Furthermore, the ratios of internal adipose tissue to weight (IATW)/WT and subcutaneous adipose tissue to IATW (SATW)/IATW did not differ significantly between groups. In conclusion, college-aged women of different somatotypes within the same age and height range varied in body composition. Consequently, the notion of a small frame is incorrect. An accurate assessment of the human body's composition may provide a valuable insight into the ideal weight for optimal physiologic function.\n\nAutobiographical memory functions in young Japanese men and women.\n\nPubMed\n\nMaki, Yoichi; Kawasaki, Yayoi; Demiray, Burcu; Janssen, Steve M J\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe present study examined whether the three major functions of autobiographical memory observed in Western societies (i.e., directing-behaviour, social-bonding and self-continuity) also exist in an East Asian society. Two self-report measures were used to assess the autobiographical memory functions of Japanese men and women. Japanese young adults (N = 451, ages 17-28 years) first completed the original Thinking About Life Experiences (TALE) Questionnaire. They subsequently received three TALE items that represented memory functions and attempted to recall a specific instance of memory recall for each item. Confirmatory factor analyses on the TALE showed that the three functions were replicated in the current sample. However, Japanese participants reported lower levels of all three functions than American participants in a previous study. We also explored whether there was an effect of gender in this Japanese sample. Women reported higher levels of the self-continuity and social-bonding functions than men. Finally, participants recalled more specific instances of memory recall for the TALE items that had received higher ratings on the TALE, suggesting that the findings on the first measure were supported by the second measure. Results are discussed in relation to the functional approach to autobiographical memory in a cross-cultural context.\n\nWomen's Studies and the International Student: A Report on a Course for Japanese Women.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nRosser, Sue V.\n\nProblems encountered by Japanese women who participated in an American women's studies seminar have been valuable to the development of a cross-cultural women's course at Mary Baldwin College in Virginia. In the summer of 1981, the school offered a special women's study course to 30 Japanese university women. The program had limited successâ¦\n\nAssociation of Physical Performance and Pain With Fear of Falling Among Community-Dwelling Japanese Women Aged 65 Years and Older.\n\nPubMed\n\nTomita, Yoshihito; Arima, Kazuhiko; Kanagae, Mitsuo; Okabe, Takuhiro; Mizukami, Satoshi; Nishimura, Takayuki; Abe, Yasuyo; Goto, Hisashi; Horiguchi, Itsuko; Aoyagi, Kiyoshi\n\n2015-09-01\n\nOur aim was to explore the association of physical performance and pain with fear of falling among community-dwelling Japanese women.The subjects were 278 women aged 65 years and over. We collected information on fear of falling, painful joints, comorbidities, falls in the previous year, and cataracts. Walking time (distance of 6 m), chair stand time (5 times), grip strength, the timed up and go test (TUG), and functional reach were measured.The prevalence of fear of falling was 36.3%, and it increased with age, but it was not significant (P = 0.081). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that poor physical performance (longer walking time, longer chair stand time, weaker grip strength, and longer TUG) and pain (low back, and upper and lower extremity pain) were significantly associated with fear of falling after adjusting for age, body mass index, comorbidities, falls in the previous year, and cataracts.Maintaining physical functioning and managing pain may be important for elderly women with fear of falling.\n\nAssociation of cigarette smoking with skin colour in Japanese women.\n\nPubMed\n\nTamai, Yuya; Tsuji, Michiko; Wada, Keiko; Nakamura, Kozue; Hayashi, Makoto; Takeda, Noriyuki; Yasuda, Keigo; Nagata, Chisato\n\n2014-05-01\n\nHaving a lighter skin tone is highly valued among many Asian women. If skin colour is affected by smoking, women may be motivated to avoid tobacco or quit smoking. The present study examined the association of tobacco smoking with skin colour in Japanese women. Information on smoking habits was obtained through a self-administered questionnaire completed by 939 Japanese women aged 20-74 in Gifu, Japan, during 2003-2006. Skin colour was examined on the inner side of the upper and lower arm and on the forehead using a Mexameter device (a narrow-band reflective spectrophotometer), which expressed results as a melanin index and erythema index. Current smokers had higher melanin indices than never-smokers and former smokers for all measured sites. The number of cigarettes smoked per day, the years of smoking and pack-years were significantly positively associated with melanin indices for all measured sites after adjustments for age, body mass index, lifetime sun exposure, and room temperature and humidity. Smoking was also significantly associated with erythema indices on the inner upper and lower arms. These data suggest that smoking is associated with a darker skin colour. If our findings are confirmed by further studies, they could be used in antismoking campaigns or by smoking cessation services.\n\nA model-based cost-effectiveness analysis of osteoporosis screening and treatment strategy for postmenopausal Japanese women.\n\nPubMed\n\nYoshimura, M; Moriwaki, K; Noto, S; Takiguchi, T\n\n2017-02-01\n\nAlthough an osteoporosis screening program has been implemented as a health promotion project in Japan, its cost-effectiveness has yet to be elucidated fully. We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis and found that osteoporosis screening and treatment would be cost-effective for Japanese women over 60Â years. The purpose of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of osteoporosis screening and drug therapy in the Japanese healthcare system for postmenopausal women with no history of fracture. A patient-level state transition model was developed to predict the outcomes of Japanese women with no previous fracture. Lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated for women who receive osteoporosis screening and alendronate therapy for 5Â years and those who do not receive the screening and treatments. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the screening option compared with the no screening option was estimated. Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the influence of parameter uncertainty on the base case results. The ICERs of osteoporosis screening and treatments for Japanese women aged 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, 65-69, 70-74, and 75-79Â years were estimated to be $89,242, $64,010, $40,596, $27,697, $17,027, and $9771 per QALY gained, respectively. Deterministic sensitivity analyses showed that several parameters such as the disutility due to vertebral fracture had a significant influence on the base case results. Applying a willingness to pay of $50,000 per QALY gained, the probability that the screening option became cost-effectiveness estimated to 50.9, 56.3, 59.1, and 64.7Â % for women aged 60-64, 65-69, 70-74, and 75-79Â years, respectively. Scenario analyses showed that the ICER for women aged 55-59Â years with at least one clinical risk factor was below $50,000 per QALY. In conclusion, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) screening and alendronate therapy for osteoporosis would be cost-effective for\n\nFacial skin photo-aging and development of hyperpigmented spots from children to middle-aged Japanese woman.\n\nPubMed\n\nTakahashi, Y; Fukushima, Y; Kondo, K; Ichihashi, M\n\n2017-11-01\n\nFacial skin hyperpigmention caused by chronic sun exposure is a major skin complaint, however, its characteristics and influential factors are still limitedly known. A cross-sectional survey in healthy Japanese women aged from 6 to 62Â years (n=169) was conducted using a facial image analyzer VISIA â¢ for knowing onset age of hyperpigmented spot formation, its chronological changes, and influence of environmental factors. UV Pigmented Spot (PS) Score was positively correlated with age (R=.487, P=.000). Hyperpigmented spots appeared first around 18Â years old in most subjects, and PS score remarkably increased at 20s then gradually increased by ages. The subjects with Skin Type I, one of the three grades of Japanese Skin Type (JST), whose melanin formation is genetically lower, showed higher PS score. A woman aged 31Â years was subjected a weekly VISIA measurement for 2Â years, and found no changes in the number, place, size and intensity of the pigment spots in this duration. Hyperpigmented spots developed in women over 20Â years of age due to chronic sun exposure without sun protection during childhood and adolescent and it was stable afterwards, whose intensity was influenced by age and skin type.

Therefore, in this cross-sectional study we attempted to characterize the condition of facial skin (hyperpigmentation, pores, texture, and wrinkling) in Japanese adults aged 65 years or older by using objective and quantitative imaging methods. In addition, we aimed to identify lifestyle factors significantly associated with these visible signs of aging. Methods The study subjects were 802 community-dwelling Japanese men and women aged at least 65 years and living in the town of Kurabuchi (Takasaki City, Gunma Prefecture, Japan), a mountain community with a population of approximately 4800. The facial skin condition of subjects was assessed quantitatively using a standardized facial imaging system and subsequent computer image analysis. Lifestyle information was collected using a structured questionnaire. The association between skin condition and lifestyle factors was examined using multivariable regression analysis. Results Among women, the mean values for facial texture, hyperpigmentation, and pores were generally lower than those among age-matched men. There was no significant difference between sexes in the severity of facial wrinkling. Older age was associated with worse skin condition among women only. After adjusting for age, smoking status and topical sun protection were significantly associated with skin condition among both men and women. Conclusions Our study revealed significant differences between sexes in the severity of hyperpigmentation, texture, and pores, but not wrinkling. Smoking status and topical sun protection were significantly associated with signs of visible skin aging in this study population.

In the present study, we cross-sectionally examined whether adherence to the food-based Japanese dietary guidelines is associated with metabolic risk factors in 1083 Japanese women aged 18-22 years. Based on the Japanese Food Guide Spinning Top, adherence to the food-based Japanese dietary guidelines was assessed using dietary information on consumed servings of grain dishes, vegetable dishes, fish and meat dishes, milk and fruits and energy from snacks and alcoholic beverages during the preceding month, which was derived from a comprehensive diet history questionnaire. Higher dietary adherence was associated with higher intakes of protein, carbohydrate, dietary fibre, Na, K and vitamin C, and lower intakes of total and saturated fat. There was also an inverse association between dietary adherence and dietary energy density. After adjustment for potential confounding factors, dietary adherence was inversely associated with waist circumference (P for trend = 0Â·002). It also showed an inverse association with LDL-cholesterol concentrations (P for trend = 0Â·04). There was no association with the other metabolic risk factors examined, including BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total and HDL-cholesterol, TAG, glucose, glycated Hb and insulin concentrations. In conclusion, higher adherence to the food-based Japanese dietary guidelines, which was characterised by favourable dietary intakes of foods and nutrients as well as lower energy density, was associated with lower waist circumference and LDL-cholesterol concentrations in this group of young Japanese women.\n\nRelationship between environmental factors, age of onset and familial history in Japanese patients with psoriasis.\n\nPubMed\n\nBayaraa, Bolortuya; Imafuku, Shinichi\n\n2018-06-01\n\nPsoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease that often involves the skin and joints. Psoriasis develops at any age and the distribution of age of onset of psoriasis is bimodal in Japan. Also, male predominance is distinct in Japanese psoriatic patients. To clarify the relationship between sex difference and habitual/environmental status, age and incidence of familial psoriasis, we analyzed data from the Fukuoka University Psoriasis Registry. A total of 1120 Japanese patients (751 men, 369 women) were analyzed. The male/female ratio was 2.03:1. Smoking and drinking habit, known as risk factors of psoriasis, were significantly more prevalent in men. Age-specific psoriasis-onset rate standardized by population showed bimodal distribution in both men and women; the younger peak was in their 30s for men and 10s in women; the second peak was in the 50s for both sexes. A familial history of psoriasis was seen in 6.3% of patients overall; however, female patients showed a significantly higher rate (8.7%) compared with men (5.1%, P = 0.024). When stratified by age of onset, the frequency of familial history was much higher among women with onset at less than 30 years (15.4%), compared with 30 years or more (5.3%, P = 0.0026). Our data suggest that genetic factors have a stronger influence in young women who experience fewer environmental factors such as smoking and drinking. This is the first study to show that there is a difference in the incidence of familial psoriasis depending on age of onset of psoriasis in Japan.

Walking time (distance of 6 m), chair stand time (5 times), grip strength, the timed up and go test (TUG), and functional reach were measured. The prevalence of fear of falling was 36.3%, and it increased with age, but it was not significant (Pâ=â0.081). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that poor physical performance (longer walking time, longer chair stand time, weaker grip strength, and longer TUG) and pain (low back, and upper and lower extremity pain) were significantly associated with fear of falling after adjusting for age, body mass index, comorbidities, falls in the previous year, and cataracts. Maintaining physical functioning and managing pain may be important for elderly women with fear of falling.

By analyzing the January 2001-December 2012 hospital database, we retrospectively identified 6954 women with pre-pregnancy normal weights (body mass index, 18.5-24.9 kg/mÂ²) and 1057 pre-pregnancy underweight women (body mass index, <18.5 kg/mÂ²) who delivered at the Perinatal Maternity and Neonatal Center of Yokohama City University. These women were stratified by weekly weight gain during the second/third trimesters to investigate associations of gestational weight gain with spontaneous preterm birth and small for gestational age (SGA). Spontaneous preterm birth and SGA incidences were compared with those of women meeting Institute of Medicine (IO M) guidelines to determine optimal weight gain in Japanese women. Preterm birth and SGA incidences were significantly higher in pre-pregnancy underweight than in pre-pregnancy normal weight women (4.6% vs 2.4% [P=0.005] and 13.9% vs 9.7% [Pâ=â0.003], respectively). For pre-pregnancy normal weight women, preterm birth incidence was significantly higher in those with weight gain of less than 0.2 kg/week than in those IOM guidelines. For pre-pregnancy underweight women, preterm birth and SGA incidences were significantly higher in those with weight gain of less than 0.3 kg/week than in those meeting IOM guidelines. Preterm birth and SGA incidences did not differ significantly between pre-pregnancy normal weight women with weight gain of 0.2âkg/week or more and pre-pregnancy underweight women with weight gain of 0.3âkg/week or more, as compared to women meeting IOM guidelines. These results suggest that IOM guidelines for gestational weight gain may lack external validity in Japanese women. Â© 2014 The Authors.

Exploring Critical Factors of Happiness Among MiddleâAged Men and Women in Japan\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTamiya, Nanako; Kawachi, Nobuyuki; Miyairi, Maya\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThis study aimed to examine multiple factors associated with happiness from the perspective of gender difference among a middleâaged Japanese population. A total of 865 participants (maleâ=â344, femaleâ=â521) aged 40â64 years were divided into two groups (high and low) by their selfâreported level of happiness. Logistic regression analysis by gender was carried out. In men, high levels of happiness were significantly correlated with living with spouse, occupation, enough sleep, leading a normal life, and regular checkups; while low levels of happiness were significantly correlated with smoking and having two or more diseases. In women, low levels of happiness were significantly correlated with caring for a family member. Our data suggested that the factors relevant to happiness levels might vary between men and women among middleâaged people in Japan. To increase the nation's level of happiness, the Japanese government must implement extended social services and policymaking, to alleviate caregiversâ burdens, especially among Japanese women.

Because help seeking for distress occurs within social networks, we examined how social networks supported or disabled help seeking for Japanese sojourners living in the US. Unfortunately, most of the literature about Japanese social relationships focuses on men in organizational settings. This study used intensive ethnographic interviewing with 49 Japanese expatriate women to examine how social relationships influenced psychosocial distress and help seeking. We found that the women in these samples engaged in complex, highly regulated, complicated and obligatory relationships through their primary affiliation with other âcompany wives.â Like many immigrant women, increased traditional cultural norms (referred to in Japanese as ryoosai kenbo, or good wives and wise mothers), were expected from these modern women, and the enactment of these roles was enforced through scrutiny, gossip and the possibility of ostracism. Fears of scrutiny was described by the women as a primary barrier to their self-disclosure and ultimate help seeking. Understanding the social organization and support within the Japanese women's community is central to understanding how culturally specific social networks can both give support, as well as create social constraints to help seeking. Health oriented prevention programs must consider these social factors when evaluating the immigration stressors faced by these families.

The study involved 375 prime-aged volunteers (175 men, 200 women) and 557 middle-aged volunteers (247 men, 310 women) living in Kuse, a town in Okayama Prefecture, Japan. We found that the prime-aged men at the preparation stage had significantly higher self-efficacy scores than at the contemplation stage (p<0.01). Middle-aged men had significantly higher self-efficacy scores at the contemplation stage than at the precontemplation stage (p<0.001). Middle-aged women, meanwhile, had significantly higher self-efficacy scores at the maintenance stage than at the action stage (p<0.01), and at the contemplation stage than at the precontemplation stage (p<0.001). The present findings provide valuable information about the differences in psychological factors affecting physical activity between prime-aged and middle-aged community-dwelling Japanese. This information may be useful to health professionals as they develop effective community-based intervention programs for target populations.\n\nAssociations of urinary cadmium with circulating sex hormone levels in pre- and postmenopausal Japanese women\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNagata, Chisato, E-mail: chisato@gifu-u.ac.jp\n\nBackground: Exposure to cadmium has been suspected as a risk factor for breast cancer. The present study examined the associations between urinary cadmium levels and circulating sex hormone levels that are linked to breast cancer risk in healthy women. Methods: The study subjects were 396 premenopausal Japanese women who had regular menstrual cycles less than 40 days long and 207 postmenopausal Japanese women. Urinary cadmium was measured using spot urine samples. Plasma estradiol, testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were measured. Additionally, the follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and sex hormone-binding globulin were measured for premenopausal women. Results: In premenopausal women, the urinarymoreÂ Â» cadmium level either expressed in Î¼g per liter or per g of urine creatinine was significantly inversely associated with total and free testosterone levels after controlling for age, body mass index, smoking status, alcohol intake, and the phase of the menstrual cycle. Total and free testosterone levels were 14.6% and 15.0% lower, respectively, in women in the highest quartile of urinary cadmium per g creatinine in those in the lowest quartile. In postmenopausal women, the urinary cadmium in Î¼g per liter as well as per g creatinine was significantly inversely associated with the estradiol level after controlling for covariates. The estradiol level was 25.8% lower in women in the highest tertile of urinary cadmium per g creatinine than in those in the lowest tertile. Conclusions: The data suggest inverse associations between urinary cadmium and the plasma estradiol or testosterone level in Japanese women. - Highlights: â¢ Exposure to cadmium has been suspected as a risk factor for breast cancer. â¢ Urinary cadmium and plasma sex-hormone levels were measured in Japanese women. â¢ Urinary cadmium was inversely associated with testosterone in premenopausal women. â¢ Urinary cadmium was inversely associated with estradiol in\n\nDevelopment of prediction equations for estimating appendicular skeletal muscle mass in Japanese men and women.\n\nPubMed\n\nFurushima, Taishi; Miyachi, Motohiko; Iemitsu, Motoyuki; Murakami, Haruka; Kawano, Hiroshi; Gando, Yuko; Kawakami, Ryoko; Sanada, Kiyoshi\n\n2017-08-29\n\nThis study aimed to develop and cross-validate prediction equations for estimating appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) and to examine the relationship between sarcopenia defined by the prediction equations and risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) or osteoporosis in Japanese men and women. Subjects were healthy men and women aged 20-90Â years, who were randomly allocated to the following two groups: the development group (D group; 257 men, 913 women) and the cross-validation group (V group; 119 men, 112 women). To develop prediction equations, stepwise multiple regression analyses were performed on data obtained from the D group, using ASM measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as a dependent variable and five easily obtainable measures (age, height, weight, waist circumference, and handgrip strength) as independent variables. When the prediction equations for ASM estimation were applied to the V group, a significant correlation was found between DXA-measured ASM and predicted ASM in both men and women (R 2 Â =Â 0.81 and R 2 Â =Â 0.72). Our prediction equations had higher R 2 values compared to previously developed equations (R 2 Â =Â 0.75-0.59 and R 2 Â =Â 0.69-0.40) in both men and women. Moreover, sarcopenia defined by predicted ASM was related to risk factors for osteoporosis and CVD, as well as sarcopenia defined by DXA-measured ASM. In this study, novel prediction equations were developed and cross-validated in Japanese men and women. Our analyses validated the clinical significance of these prediction equations and showed that previously reported equations were not applicable in a Japanese population.\n\nMaternal Uncontrolled Anxiety Disorders Are Associated With the Increased Risk of Hypertensive Disorders in Japanese Pregnant Women\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSuzuki, Shunji; Shinmura, Hiroki; Kato, Masahiko\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBackground We examined the risk of hypertensive disorders in relation to maternal depressive and anxiety disorders which were diagnosed before or during early pregnancy in Japanese women. Methods We reviewed the obstetric records of all Japanese singleton deliveries at â¥ 22 weeksâ gestation managed at the Japanese Red Cross Katsushika Maternity Hospital between 2009 and 2014. Potential risk factors for hypertensive disorders with maternal depressive and anxiety disorders were selected as follows: maternal age, parity, medications, self-interruption of medications and economic problems. Results The incidence of hypertensive disorders did not increase in the pregnant women with depressive disorders compared with that in the normal control pregnant women (P = 0.96). However, the incidence of hypertensive disorders in the women with anxiety disorders was higher than that in the control women (odds ratio (OR): 2.61, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.4 - 5.0, P < 0.01). In the women with anxiety disorders, 19% performed self-interruption of medications during pregnancy, and it was associated with the increased risk of hypertensive disorders (vs. no medication group, OR: 7.50, 95% CI: 1.5 - 38, P = 0.03; vs. medication group, OR: 16.0, 95% CI: 2.4 - 110, P < 0.01). Conclusions Maternal uncontrolled anxiety disorders due to self-interruption of medications seemed to be associated with the increased risk of hypertensive disorders in Japanese pregnant women.

This burden could be reduced by the implementation of a CC vaccine, but its cost-effectiveness is unknown. We quantified the clinical impact and assessed the cost-effectiveness of adding CC vaccination at age 12 to the current screening in place in Japan with a lifetime Markov model adapted to the Japanese setting. Transition probabilities and utility values were obtained from public databases. Direct costs for treatment and screening were estimated using Japanese medical fees. Annual costs and benefits were discounted at 3%. Sensitivity analyses were conducted on the age at vaccination, the vaccine characteristics, the discount rates, the proportion of human papillomavirus types 16/18 in cancer, and the screening coverage. Vaccinating a 12-year-old cohort was predicted to reduce CC incidence and deaths from CC by 73%. These clinical effects were associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of yen1.8 million per quality-adjusted life year gained. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of vaccinating all 10- to 45-year-old women was yen2.8 million per quality-adjusted life year, still below the threshold value. The implementation of a CC vaccination in Japan could reduce the CC burden in a very cost-effective manner for women up to 45 years.\n\nElucidating the genetic architecture of reproductive ageing in the Japanese population.\n\nPubMed\n\nHorikoshi, Momoko; Day, Felix R; Akiyama, Masato; Hirata, Makoto; Kamatani, Yoichiro; Matsuda, Koichi; Ishigaki, Kazuyoshi; Kanai, Masahiro; Wright, Hollis; Toro, Carlos A; Ojeda, Sergio R; Lomniczi, Alejandro; Kubo, Michiaki; Ong, Ken K; Perry, John R B\n\n2018-05-17\n\nPopulation studies elucidating the genetic architecture of reproductive ageing have been largely limited to European ancestries, restricting the generalizability of the findings and overlooking possible key genes poorly captured by common European genetic variation. Here, we report 26 loci (all Pâ<â5âÃâ10 -8 ) for reproductive ageing, i.e. puberty timing or age at menopause, in a non-European population (up to 67,029 women of Japanese ancestry). Highlighted genes for menopause include GNRH1, which supports a primary, rather than passive, role for hypothalamic-pituitary GnRH signalling in the timing of menopause. For puberty timing, we demonstrate an aetiological role for receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatases by combining evidence across population genetics and pre- and peri-pubertal changes in hypothalamic gene expression in rodent and primate models. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate widespread differences in allele frequencies and effect estimates between Japanese and European associated variants, highlighting the benefits and challenges of large-scale trans-ethnic approaches.\n\nEducational inequalities in smoking among Japanese adults aged 25-94 years: Nationally representative sex- and age-specific statistics.\n\nPubMed\n\nTabuchi, Takahiro; Kondo, Naoki\n\n2017-04-01\n\nFew studies have investigated differences in age- and gender-specific educational gradients in tobacco smoking among the whole range of adult age groups. We examined educational inequality in smoking among Japanese adults aged 25-94 years. Using a large nationally representative sample (167,925 men and 186,588 women) in 2010, prevalence of current smoking and heavy smoking among daily smokers and their inequalities attributable to educational attainment were analyzed according to sex and age groups. Among men aged 25-34 years, junior high school graduates had the highest current smoking prevalence at 68.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 66.0%-70.6%), and graduate school graduates had the lowest at 19.4% (95% CI, 17.2%-21.9%). High school graduates had the second highest current smoking prevalence (e.g., 55.9%; 95% CI, 54.9%-56.8% in men aged 25-34 years). Among men aged 75-94 years, the difference in current smoking across educational categories was small. A similar but steeper educational gradient in current smoking was observed among women. Among women aged 25-34 years, junior high school graduates had the highest current smoking prevalence at 49.3% (95% CI, 46.3%-52.3%), and graduate school graduates had the lowest at 4.8% (95% CI, 2.9%-7.4%). Compared with older age groups, such as 65-94 years, younger age groups, such as 25-54 years, had higher estimates of inequality indicators for educational inequality in both current and heavy smoking in both sexes. Educational inequalities in current and heavy smoking were apparent and large in the young population compared with older generations. The current study provides basic data on educational inequalities in smoking among Japanese adults. Copyright Â© 2016 The Authors. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

A total of 4234 participants of Aichi Workers' Cohort Study who were aged 35-66 years and free of diabetes in 2002 were followed through 2014. Past body weights at the ages of 20, 25, 30, 40 years, and 5 years before baseline as well as measured body weight at baseline were regressed on the ages. Slope and root-mean-square-error of the regression line were obtained and used to represent the weight changes and the weight fluctuation, respectively. The associations of the weight-change slopes and the weight fluctuation with incident T2DM were estimated by Cox proportional hazards models. During the median follow-up of 12.2 years, 400 incident cases of T2DM were documented. After adjustment for baseline overweight and other lifestyle covariates, the weight-change slopes were significantly associated with higher incidence of T2DM (hazard ratio (HR): 1.80, 95% confident interval (CI): 1.17-2.77 for men; and HR: 2.78, 95% CI: 1.07-7.23 for women), while the weight fluctuation was not (HR: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.00-1.18 for men and HR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.84-1.25 for women). Regardless of the presence of overweight, the long-term weight-change slopes were significantly associated with the increased risk of T2DM; however, the weight fluctuation was not associated with the risk of T2DM in middle-aged Japanese men and women.\n\nSkills and Life Strategies of Japanese Business Women.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nIwao, Sumiko\n\nIn this paper, case studies of two successful Japanese businesswomen illustrate how traditional Japanese cultural values and female sex roles have enabled women to succeed in business.

Clinical parameters and nutritional intake were investigated and compared in 912 (417 men, 495 women) elderly Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes registered to the Japanese Elderly Diabetes Intervention Trial. The mean daily energy intake of patients was 1802 kcal in men and 1661 kcal in women, respectively. The energy intakes per kilogram of standard bodyweight in both sexes and the energy intakes per kilogram of present bodyweight in men increased significantly with age. The protein : fat : carbohydrate (PFC) energy ratio (%E) was 15.2:25.4:59.5 in men, and 15.7:25.8:58.6 in women, respectively. Grain, oil, alcohol and soft drink intakes were higher in men than in women. Potato, fruit and green vegetable intakes were higher in women than in men. Fruit intake showed a significant age-related increase in men. In women, there was an age-related significant decrease of meat intake. An increase of BMI correlated with a significant increase in bodyweight, waist circumference, hip circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, triglycerides and diastolic blood pressure. The mean energy intake of three BMI groups, lean (BMI < 18.5 kg/m(2)), normal (18.5 kg/m(2) = BMI < 25 kg/m(2) ) and obese (25 kg/m(2) = BMI), were 1625, 1796 and 1839 kcal in men, and 1655, 1647 and 1685 kcal in women, respectively. However, BMI-related increase of energy intake did not reach statistically significant levels in both sexes. Energyintake per kilogram of present bodyweight decreased as BMI increased in both sexes. Energy intake per kilogram of standard bodyweight increased significantly as BMI increased in men only, but not in women. There were no differences in PFC energy ratios among the three BMI groups. In contrast, intake of soft drinks in men increased significantly as BMI increased.

Additionally, we analyzed projected mortality rates. We obtained data on the number of cervical cancer deaths in Japanese women from 1975-2011 from the national vital statistics and census population data. A cohort table of mortality rate data was analyzed on the basis of a Bayesian APC model. We also projected the mortality rates for the 2012-2031 period. The period effect was relatively limited, compared with the age and cohort effects. The age effect increased suddenly from 25-29 to 45-49 years of age and gently increased thereafter. An analysis of the cohort effect on mortality rate trends revealed a steep decreasing slope for birth cohorts born from 1908-1940 and a subsequent sudden increase after 1945. The mortality rate projections indicated increasing trends from 40 to 74 years of age until the year 2031. The age effect increased from 25-29 years of age. This could be attributable to the high human papilloma virus (HPV) infection risk and the low cervical cancer screening rate. The cohort effect changed from decreasing to increasing after the early 1940s. This might be attributable to the spread of cervical cancer screening and treatment before 1940 and the high HPV infection risk and reduced cervical cancer screening rate after 1945. The projected mortality rate indicated an increasing trend until the year 2031.\n\nLong-term weight-change slope, weight fluctuation and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in middle-aged Japanese men and women: findings of Aichi Workers' Cohort Study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZhang, Y; Yatsuya, H; Li, Y; Chiang, C; Hirakawa, Y; Kawazoe, N; Tamakoshi, K; Toyoshima, H; Aoyama, A\n\n2017-01-01\n\nObjective: This study aims to investigate the association of long-term weight-change slopes, weight fluctuation and the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in middle-aged Japanese men and women.

We aimed to assess trends related to the proportion of female first authors in Japanese cardiovascular journals.We reviewed original research articles in 6 journals published in English by Japanese societies between 2006 and 2015 related to cardiovascular fields. We conducted a multivariable logistic regression analysis to assess the factors associated with the gender of first authors and plotted the trend of predicted probability for female first authors over the study period. Of 7,005 original articles, 1,330 (19.0%) had female first authors. Affiliations located in Japan (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71-0.81), concurrent first and corresponding authors (aOR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.64-0.74), and the total number of listed authors (aOR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95-0.99) were negatively associated with female first authors. The adjusted probability of a female first author increased from 13% to 20% on an average between 2006 and 2009, but the increase reached a plateau after 2010.Female first authors of original research articles published in Japanese cardiovascular journals increased over the examined decade. However, the representation of women is still low and has plateaued in recent years.

Participants were divided into three groups comprising 477 men and 519 women in the young-old group (aged 69-71 years), 449 men and 500 women in the old-old group (aged 79-81 years), and 35 men and 35 women in the young adult group (aged 24-32 years). Recognition thresholds for the four basic tastes were measured using the 1-mL whole mouth gustatory test, in which taste solutions of the four basic tastes were tested in five concentrations. Young adults showed significantly lower recognition thresholds than the young-old group, and the young-old group showed significantly lower recognition thresholds than the old-old group. Among the young-old and old-old groups, women showed significantly lower recognition thresholds than males for sour, salty and bitter tastes, but there was no sex difference in the sweet taste threshold between the two groups. The present study confirmed that there are age and sex differences in taste sensitivity for the four basic tastes among young adult, young-old, and old-old Japanese, and that the sensitivity of sweet taste is more robust than the other tastes.

Because of this, additional tests are recommended for women with dense breasts. This study aimed to reveal trends in breast density among Japanese women and determine whether differences in breast density differentially affected the detection of abnormalities via MMG. We retrospectively analyzed 397 control women who underwent MMG screening as well as 269 patients who underwent surgery for breast cancer for whom preoperative MMG data were available.
