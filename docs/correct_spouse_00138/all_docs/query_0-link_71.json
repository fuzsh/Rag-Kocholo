While adult tissue stem cells have been identified as targets of GVHD in the skin and gut, their role in hepatic GVHD is yet to be clarified. In the current study, we explored the fate of bile duct stem cells (BDSCs), capable of generating liver organoids in vitro, during hepatic GVHD after allogeneic HCT. We observed a significant expansion of biliary epithelial cells (BECs) upon injury early after allogeneic HCT. Organoid-forming efficiency from the bile duct was also significantly increased early after allogeneic HCT. Subsequently, the organoid-forming efficiency from bile ducts was markedly decreased in association with the reduction of BECs and the elevation of plasma concentrations of bilirubin, suggesting that GVHD targets BDSCs and impairs the resilience of BECs. The growth of liver organoids in the presence of liver-infiltrating mononuclear cells from allogeneic recipients, but not from syngeneic recipients, significantly reduced in a TGF--dependent manner. Administration of SB-431542, an inhibitor of TGF-β signaling, from day 14 to day 28 protected organoid-forming BDSCs against GVHD and mitigated biliary dysfunction after allogeneic HCT, suggesting that BDSCs are a promising therapeutic target for hepatic GVHD.\n\nKoh Izumiyama, Tasuku Inao, Hideki Goto, Shinpei Harada, Hajime Senjo, Keito Suto, Junichi Hashiguchi, Reiki Ogasawara, Tomoyuki Saga, Tetsuyuki Igarashi, Kentaro Wakasa, Ikumi Kasahara, Yukari Takeda, Keisuke Yamaguchi, Akio Shigematsu, Mutsumi Takahata, Katsuya Fujimoto, Yoshihito Haseyama, Takahiro Nagashima, Hajime Sakai, Yasutaka Kakinoki, Mitsutoshi Kurosawa, Isao Yokota, Takanori Teshima\n\nHaematologica 2024/06/13\n\nInformation regarding follow-up duration after treatment for newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is important. However, a clear endpoint has yet to be established. We totally enrolled 2182 patients newly diagnosed with DLBCL between 2008 and 2018. The median age of the patients was 71 years. All patients were treated with rituximab- and anthracycline-based chemotherapies. Each overall survival (OS) was compared with the age- and sex-matched Japanese general population (GP) data. At a median follow-up of 3.4 years, 985 patients experienced an event and 657 patients died. Patients who achieved an event-free survival (EFS) at 36 months (EFS36) had an OS equivalent to that of the matched GP (standard mortality ratio [SMR], 1.17; P=0.1324), whereas those who achieved an EFS24 did not have an OS comparable to that of the matched GP (SMR, 1.26; P=0.0095). Subgroup analysis revealed that relatively old patients (>60 years), male patients, those with limited-stage disease, those with a good performance status, and those with low levels of soluble interleukin 2 receptor already had a comparable life expectancy to the matched GP at an EFS24. In contrast, relatively young patients had a shorter life expectancy than matched GP, even with an EFS36. In conclusion, an EFS36 was shown to be a more suitable endpoint for newly diagnosed DLBCL patients than an EFS24. Of note, younger patients require a longer EFS period than older patients in order to obtain an equivalent life expectancy to the matched GP.\n\nHideki Goto, Masahiro Onozawa, Takanori Teshima\n\nInternational journal of hematology 2024/05/25\n\nApproximately 60-70% of patients with large B cell lymphoma (LBCL) achieve long-term remission or a cure after initial treatment. However, patients who relapse or are refractory to initial treatment have a poor prognosis. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has recently attracted attention for its potential to provide a cure or long-term remission even for LBCL that has relapsed or is refractory to conventional chemotherapy. Currently, three CAR T cell products are clinically available for LBCL: tisagenlecleucel (tisa-cel), axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) and lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel). These CAR T cell products were initially approved as third- or later-line therapies worldwide. Recently, axi-cel and liso-cel have become feasible as second-line therapies for patients with early relapsed or refractory disease after first-line chemotherapy. Although a large body of data on CAR T cell therapy has been accumulated, the clinical question of how to choose between these three available CAR T cell products has yet to be resolved. The appropriate approach to treatment selection for patients who relapse after CAR T cell therapy also remains unclear. This review discusses treatment strategies to maximize the benefits of CAR T cell therapy.\n\nKeiichi Nakano, Masanori Seimiya, Kojiro Yamazaki, Keiko Yasuda, Naoki Yamashita, Hideki Goto, Takanori Teshima\n\nLaboratory medicine 2024/04/15\n\nLipids interfere with absorbance measurements conducted using colorimetric methods. To monitor lipemia, some systems measure absorbance using an analyzer. This report describes a novel case of interference with the lipemia index without lipemia. A 64-year-old woman with giant basal cell carcinoma underwent resection and sentinel lymph node biopsy. The patient had been subcutaneously injected with patent blue during sentinel lymph node resection. After surgery, her serum and urine were yellow-green, and the lipemia index, calculated by measuring absorbance at 658 nm (main wavelength) and 694 nm (secondary wavelength) using a JCA-BM8040 chemistry analyzer, was high. The absorbance spectrum of the patient's serum and patent blue solution were compared to determine the cause of the high lipemia index. The patient's serum and the patent blue solution showed absorption at wavelengths between 540 and 698 nm. Moreover, the absorbance was concentration-dependent for patent blue. These results thus indicated that the patient's serum contained patent blue. Here, we report a case wherein patent blue affected the lipemia index. Thus, it must be noted that patent blue injection may yield inaccurate results when evaluating lipemia index.\n\nHiroyuki Kimura, Masahiro Onozawa, Toshihiro Matsukawa, Hideki Goto, Takeshi Kondo, Takanori Teshima\n\nExperimental hematology 104208 - 104208 2024/03/26\n\nGermline mutations of THPO were reported as causes of hereditary thrombocythemia. Six previously reported distinct sites of the mutation were clustered at the 5'-untranslated region or the exon 3 splicing donor site of the THPO gene. Each mutation was identified in an independent pedigree and the difference in the mutations were not compared. We cloned 6 distinct THPO mutations (THPO c.-47delG, THPO c.-31G>T, THPO c.13G>A, THPO c.13+1G>A, THPO c.13+2T>C, and THPO c.13+5G>A) and compared the molecular mechanisms that underlie the increased production of THPO protein. At the transcript level, all of the mutations except THPO c.-47delG showed an exon 3 skipping transcript including 2 mutations (THPO c.-31G>T and THPO c.13+5G>A) that were distant from the splicing donor site. THPO c.-47delG showed the same full-length transcript as that of the wild-type transcript. At the protein level, all mutations resulted in a higher level of production of THPO protein compared to wild-type THPO. There are only two distinct patterns of mechanisms for increased production of THPO: 1) exon 3 skipping that deleted upstream suppressive open reading frame (ORF) 7 and 2) one base deletion that shifted ORF7 to connect to the initial codon of THPO in-frame. The common mechanisms of hereditary thrombocytosis due to THPO mutation are unleashed THPO translation that is usually suppressed by upstream out-of-frame ORF7.\n\nEiko Hayase, Takahide Ara, Yumika Saito, Shuichiro Takahashi, Kosuke Yoshioka, Hiroyuki Ohigashi, Reiki Ogasawara, Emi Yokoyama, Tomohiro Yamakawa, Ko Ebata, Yuta Hasegawa, Kazuma Tomizuka, Takanori Teshima\n\nBlood advances 8 (3) 725 - 731 2024/02/13\n\nGraft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is the major obstacle to performing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). We and others have shown that intestinal stem cells are targeted in lower gastrointestinal GVHD. A leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5)-expressing gastric stem cells (GSCs) reside at the base of the gastric glands in mice. After experimental allo-HCT, Lgr5+ GSCs significantly decreased. Parietal cells, which underwent continuous renewal by GSCs, were injured in gastric GVHD, leading to failure of gastric acidification and aerobic bacterial overgrowth in the duodenum. Fate-mapping analysis demonstrated that administration of R-Spondin1 (R-Spo1) that binds to Lgr5 for 6 days in naïve mice significantly increased proliferating epithelial cells derived from Lgr5+ GSCs. R-Spo1 administered on days -3 to -1 and from days +1 to +3 of allo-HCT protected GSCs, leading to amelioration of gastric GVHD and restoration of gastric acidification, and suppression of aerobic bacterial overgrowth in the duodenum. In conclusion, Lgr5+ GSCs were targeted by gastric GVHD, resulting in disruption of the gastric homeostasis, whereas R-Spo1 protected Lgr5+ GSCs from GVHD and maintained homeostasis in the stomach.\n\n伊藤 誠, 増田 裕弥, 南 昭子, 佐々木 麻記, 山下 直樹, 渡邊 千秋, 後藤 秀樹, 豊嶋 崇徳\n\n日本輸血細胞治療学会誌 (一社)日本輸血・細胞治療学会 70 (1) 51 - 51 1881-3011 2024/02\n\nNaoki Miyashita, Masahiro Onozawa, Toshihiro Matsukawa, Akio Mori, Daisuke Hidaka, Koichiro Minauchi, Akio Shigematsu, Junichi Hashiguchi, Tetsuyuki Igarashi, Yasutaka Kakinoki, Yutaka Tsutsumi, Makoto Ibata, Kentaro Wakasa, Katsuya Fujimoto, Toshimichi Ishihara, Hajime Sakai, Satoshi Iyama, Tatsuo Oyake, Takeshi Kondo, Takanori Teshima\n\nBritish journal of haematology 2024/01/18\n\nHiroyuki Kimura, Masahiro Onozawa, Junichi Hashiguchi, Daisuke Hidaka, Minoru Kanaya, Toshihiro Matsukawa, Hiromi Okada, Takeshi Kondo, Yoshihiro Matsuno, Takanori Teshima\n\nAnnals of hematology 103 (1) 89 - 96 2024/01\n\nThrombopoietin (THPO) is an essential factor for platelet production. Hereditary thrombocythemia (HT) is caused by a germline mutation of THPO, MPL, or JAK2 and is inherited in an autosomal-dominant manner. We identified a Japanese family with HT due to a point mutation of the splicing donor site of the THPO gene (THPO c.13 + 1G > A). Bone marrow biopsy showed increased megakaryocytes mimicking essential thrombocythemia. One affected family member developed chronic myeloid leukemia. We cloned the mutation and developed mutated and wild type THPO expression vectors. Molecular analysis showed that the mutation causes an exon 3 skipping transcript of THPO that abrogates a suppressive untranslated upstream open reading frame. Although the transcript levels of THPO mRNA were comparable, mutated transcripts were more efficiently translated and THPO protein expression was significantly higher than that of the wild type.\n\nMasahiro Chiba, Joji Shimono, Keito Suto, Takashi Ishio, Tomoyuki Endo, Hideki Goto, Hiroo Hasegawa, Michiyuki Maeda, Takanori Teshima, Yibin Yang, Masao Nakagawa\n\nBlood 2023/12/24\n\nAdult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is an aggressive T-cell malignancy with a poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Programmed cell death ligand 1(PD-L1) is recognized to be involved in the pathobiology of ATLL. However, what molecules control PD-L1 expression and whether genetic or pharmacological intervention might modify PD-L1 expression in ATLL cells is still unknown. In order to comprehend the regulatory mechanisms of PD-L1 expression in ATLL cells, we performed unbiased genome-wide clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) screening in this work. In ATLL cells, we discovered that the neddylation-associated genes NEDD8, NAE1, UBA3, and CUL3 negatively regulated PD-L1 expression while STAT3 positively did so in ATLL cells. We verified, in line with the genetic results, that treatment with the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib or the neddylation pathway inhibitor pevonedistat resulted in a decrease in PD-L1 expression in ATLL cells or an increase in it. It is significant that these results held true regardless of whether ATLL cells had the PD-L1 3' structural variant, a known genetic anomaly that promotes PD-L1 overexpression in certain primary ATLL patients. Pevonedistat alone showed cytotoxicity for ATLL cells, but compared to each single modality, pevonedistat improved the cytotoxic effects of the anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody Avelumab and chimeric antigen receptor T-cells targeting PD-L1 in vitro. As a result, our work provided insight into a portion of the complex regulatory mechanisms governing PD-L1 expression in ATLL cells and demonstrated the in vitro preliminary preclinical efficacy of PD-L1-directed immunotherapies by using pevonedistat to upregulate PD-L1 in ATLL cells.\n\nJunichi Sugita, Takashi Kuroha, Jun Ishikawa, Tetsuya Eto, Kentaro Fukushima, Isao Yokota, Koichi Akashi, Shuichi Taniguchi, Mine Harada, Takanori Teshima\n\nBone marrow transplantation 2023/12/19\n\nPosttransplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy)-based graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis has been increasingly used in HLA-haploidentical transplantation and recent studies also demonstrated the efficacy of PTCy in HLA-matched transplantation. We conducted a prospective multicenter phase II study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PTCy with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil in 43 patients who underwent HLA-matched (n = 21), 1 allele mismatched (n = 20), or 2 allele mismatched (n = 2) peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) following myeloablative (n = 28) or reduced-intensity (n = 15) conditioning. The incidence of grade III-IV acute GVHD at 100 days was 2.3%. The incidences of grades II-IV acute GVHD, all grade chronic GVHD, and moderate to severe chronic GVHD at 2 years were 16.3%, 14.0%, and 4.7%, respectively. Overall survival, disease-free survival, and non-relapse mortality at 2 years were 75.3%, 74.0%, and 7.0%, respectively. GVHD-free, relapse-free survival at 2 years was 67.0%. The rate of off-immunosuppressants in patients who survived without relapse at 2 years was 85.4%. These results indicate that PTCy is a valid option for GVHD prophylaxis in both HLA-matched and HLA 1-2 allele mismatched PBSCT.\n\n再発難治性びまん性大細胞型B細胞リンパ腫に対するCAR-T細胞療法後にpseudo-progressionを認めた1例\n\n藤井 文彰, 千葉 雅尋, 橋田 里妙, 長谷川 祐太, 大東 寛幸, 安本 篤史, 後藤 秀樹, 山口 圭介, 小野澤 真弘, 橋本 大吾, 豊嶋 崇徳\n\n臨床血液 (一社)日本血液学会-東京事務局 64 (12) 1523 - 1524 0485-1439 2023/12\n\nHideki Goto, Junichi Sugita, Yuta Hasegawa, Koji Hayasaka, Kana Sunagoya, Rie Hatase, Mutsumi Nishida, Yuki Ichihashi, Mitsuhiko Odera, Hajime Senjo, Shota Yokoyama, Takahide Ara, Souichi Shiratori, Tomoyuki Endo, Masayuki Hino, Yoshinobu Maeda, Masashi Sawa, Norihiro Sato, Takanori Teshima\n\nTransplantation 2023/11/28\n\nBACKGROUND: Pegfilgrastim, a long-acting form of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, with a convenient single-injection dosage, is being investigated for peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilization in healthy volunteers. However, data on the adequate dose of pegfilgrastim for PBSC mobilization are limited. This phase 2, single-arm study evaluated the efficacy and safety of pegfilgrastim for PBSC mobilization in healthy volunteers. METHODS: The study comprised 2 phases: pilot (steps 1-3, dose escalation, a single subcutaneous dose of 3.6, 7.2, and 10.8 mg pegfilgrastim, respectively) and evaluation (step 4, efficacy and safety assessments). The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects who achieved mobilization of ≥20 × 106/L cluster of differentiation 34 positive (CD34+) cells. RESULTS: Thirty-five subjects (6 each in steps 1 and 2 and 23 in step 4) were included. In the pilot phase, step 3 with a 10.8 mg dose was not conducted due to favorable outcomes in step 2 (desired CD34+ cell count), at 7.2 mg pegfilgrastim, which was identified as the optimal dose for the evaluation phase. In the evaluation phase, successful CD34+ mobilization was achieved in all 23 subjects. The mean peripheral blood CD34+ cells count peaked on day 5. Back pain, thrombocytopenia, transient elevations of alkaline phosphatase, and lactate dehydrogenase were the most common adverse events. All adverse events were mild, and none led to study discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: A single-dose pegfilgrastim successfully mobilized an optimal number of CD34+ cells and was well tolerated. Pegfilgrastim could be an alternative option for PBSC mobilization in healthy volunteers. The trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03993639).\n\nKaoru Murakami, Shimpei I Kubota, Kumiko Tanaka, Hiroki Tanaka, Keiichiroh Akabane, Rigel Suzuki, Yuta Shinohara, Hiroyasu Takei, Shigeru Hashimoto, Yuki Tanaka, Shintaro Hojyo, Osamu Sakamoto, Norihiko Naono, Takayui Takaai, Kazuki Sato, Yuichi Kojima, Toshiyuki Harada, Takeshi Hattori, Satoshi Fuke, Isao Yokota, Satoshi Konno, Takashi Washio, Takasuke Fukuhara, Takanori Teshima, Masateru Taniguchi, Masaaki Murakami\n\nLab on a chip 23 (22) 4909 - 4918 2023/11/07\n\nA digital platform that can rapidly and accurately diagnose pathogenic viral variants, including SARS-CoV-2, will minimize pandemics, public anxiety, and economic losses. We recently reported an artificial intelligence (AI)-nanopore platform that enables testing for Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 with high sensitivity and specificity within five minutes. However, which parts of the virus are recognized by the platform are unknown. Similarly, whether the platform can detect SARS-CoV-2 variants or the presence of the virus in clinical samples needs further study. Here, we demonstrated the platform can distinguish SARS-CoV-2 variants. Further, it identified mutated Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 expressing spike proteins of the delta and omicron variants, indicating it discriminates spike proteins. Finally, we used the platform to identify omicron variants with a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 94%, respectively, in saliva specimens from COVID-19 patients. Thus, our results demonstrate the AI-nanopore platform is an effective diagnostic tool for SARS-CoV-2 variants.\n\n2022年度HIV-1薬剤耐性検査外部精度評価の報告\n\n吉田 繁, 松田 昌和, 今橋 真弓, 岡田 清美, 齊藤 浩一, 林田 庸総, 佐藤 かおり, 藤澤 真一, 遠藤 知之, 西澤 雅子, 椎野 禎一郎, 潟永 博之, 豊嶋 崇徳, 杉浦 亙, 吉村 和久, 菊地 正\n\n日本エイズ学会誌 (一社)日本エイズ学会 25 (4) 443 - 443 1344-9478 2023/11\n\nShunsuke Uno, Hiroyuki Gatanaga, Tsunefusa Hayashida, Mayumi Imahashi, Rumi Minami, Michiko Koga, Sei Samukawa, Dai Watanabe, Teruhisa Fujii, Masao Tateyama, Hideta Nakamura, Shuzo Matsushita, Yusuke Yoshino, Tomoyuki Endo, Masahide Horiba, Toshibumi Taniguchi, Hiroshi Moro, Hidetoshi Igari, Shigeru Yoshida, Takanori Teshima, Hideaki Nakajima, Masako Nishizawa, Yoshiyuki Yokomaku, Yasumasa Iwatani, Atsuko Hachiya, Shingo Kato, Naoki Hasegawa, Kazuhisa Yoshimura, Wataru Sugiura, Tadashi Kikuchi\n\nJournal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy 0305-7453 2023/10/19 [Refereed]\n\nAbstract Background Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) are recommended as first-line ART for people living with HIV (PLWH) in most guidelines. The INSTI-resistance-associated mutation E157Q, a highly prevalent (2%–5%) polymorphism of the HIV-1 (human immunodeficiency virus type 1) integrase gene, has limited data on optimal first-line ART regimens. We assessed the virological outcomes of various first-line ART regimens in PLWH with E157Q in real-world settings. Methods A multicentre retrospective observational study was conducted on PLWH who underwent integrase genotypic drug-resistance testing before ART initiation between 2008 and 2019 and were found to have E157Q. Viral suppression (&lt;50 copies/mL) rate at 24 and 48 weeks, time to viral suppression and time to viral rebound (≥100 copies/mL) were compared among the first-line ART regimens. Results E157Q was detected in 167 (4.1%) of 4043 ART-naïve PLWH. Among them, 144 had available clinical data after ART initiation with a median follow-up of 1888 days. Forty-five started protease inhibitors + 2 NRTIs (PI group), 33 started first-generation INSTI (raltegravir or elvitegravir/cobicistat) + 2 NRTIs (INSTI-1 group), 58 started once-daily second-generation INSTI (dolutegravir or bictegravir) + 2 NRTIs (INSTI-2 group) and eight started other regimens. In the multivariate analysis, the INSTI-2 group showed similar or favourable outcomes compared with the PI group for viral suppression rates, time to viral suppression and time to viral rebound. Two cases in the INSTI-1 group experienced virological failure. Conclusions The general guideline recommendation of second-generation INSTI-based first-line ART for most PLWH is also applicable to PLWH harbouring E157Q.\n\nTakaya Ichikawa, Tomokazu Tamura, Mutsumi Takahata, Takashi Ishio, Makoto Ibata, Ikumi Kasahara, Koichiro Minauchi, Satoshi Yamamoto, Takanori Teshima, Takasuke Fukuhara\n\nBritish Journal of Haematology 204 (3) 815 - 820 0007-1048 2023/10/05\n\nSummary Prolonged SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in immunocompromised individuals has been scattered, but the details remain unclear. We conducted a prospective study with 26 COVID‐19 patients with haematological malignancies to determine viral shedding kinetics and characteristics. We obtained nasopharyngeal swabs from the patients 21–28 days post‐onset for a PCR test and performed virus isolation from the PCR‐positive samples. A viable virus was detected in five patients (19.2%), all of whom had malignant lymphoma. Those patients had significantly lower CD4+ T‐cell counts than the PCR‐negative patients. A comparison of previous chemotherapy showed that anti‐CD20 antibodies and bendamustine may be risk factors for prolonged viral shedding.\n\n悪性リンパ腫へのtisagenlecleucelの治療効果に関するPET/CTで評価されたMTHとDmaxのインパクト\n\n後藤 秀樹, 北脇 年雄, 加藤 光次, 藤井 伸治, 大西 康, 福原 規子, 山内 拓司, 虎谷 和則, 下茂 雅俊, 小林 宏紀, 小野寺 晃一, 吉田 匠汰, 千丈 創, 小野澤 真弘, 平田 健司, 横田 勲, 豊嶋 崇徳\n\n日本血液学会学術集会 85回 1193 - 1193 2023/10\n\n菊地 菜海, 山下 直樹, 安田 慶子, 後藤 秀樹, 豊嶋 崇徳\n\n北臨技会誌 (一社)北海道臨床衛生検査技師会 21 (2) 71 - 76 2023/10\n\n抗核抗体検査は主に自己免疫疾患が疑われる場合にスクリーニング検査として実施され,そのパターンから出現する疾患特異抗体がある程度推測可能である.一方,疾患特異抗体の検査は自己免疫疾患の診断や分類基準に用いられる.本症例は,抗核抗体が320倍・均質型であったのに対し,抗Sm抗体,抗CENP-B抗体,抗Jo-1抗体など7種類の疾患特異抗体が陽性となった.臨床症状等はなく非特異反応が疑われたため精査したところ,DID法・抗原添加試験の結果から検体中に疾患特異抗体は存在せず,第2試薬(R2)成分との反応性確認試験および抗体クラス別の反応性確認試験の結果から,検体中のIgM抗体により非特異反応が生じた可能性が高いと考えられた.抗核抗体パターンと矛盾した自己抗体陽性を認めた場合,他の検査や所見等も確認し,非特異反応も念頭に置いて結果を判断する必要がある.(著者抄録)\n\nHirotaka Mori, Daisuke Koyama, Yuki Sato, Yuki Kataoka, Shunsuke Taito, Takashi Ishio, Takanori Teshima, Isao Yokota\n\nCureus 15 (10) e47184 2023/10\n\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine whether hematogones in patients with hematopoietic disorders after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) are associated with clinical outcomes. We searched the MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform databases from their inception to March 2023. The primary outcome in the summary of findings was three-year relapse-free survival (RFS), and secondary outcomes in the summary of findings included three-year relapse, non-relapse mortality (NRM), overall survival (OS), acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and infection. The certainty of evidence was determined using the grading of recommendation assessment, development, and evaluation approaches. A systematic review and meta-analysis of outcome measures were conducted using a random-effects model. This study protocol was registered in the Open Science Framework. A total of six studies (including 888 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. Hematogones were related to favorable three-year RFS (risk ratio (RR) = 1.84; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.01 to 3.34) and favorable NRM (RR = 0.14; 95% CI = 0.04 to 0.51), OS (RR = 1.51; 95% CI = 1.13 to 2.02), and acute GVHD (RR = 0.44; 95% CI = 0.33 to 0.59). The certainty of the evidence was low for RFS, NRM, OS, and acute GVHD. Evidence regarding the association between hematogones, relapse, and infections is uncertain. Hematogones may be a prognostic factor for long-term prognosis and acute adverse events in patients with hematopoietic disorders after allo-HSCT. Further studies are required to address the long-term life-threatening events.\n\nKeisuke Kagami, Reiko Oyamada, Tsubasa Watanabe, Sho Nakakubo, Takahiro Hayashi, Sumio Iwasaki, Tatsuya Fukumoto, Takayuki Usami, Kasumi Hayasaka, Shinichi Fujisawa, Chiaki Watanabe, Mutsumi Nishida, Takanori Teshima, Yusuke Niinuma, Isao Yokota, Yoh Takekuma, Mitsuru Sugawara, Nobuhisa Ishiguro\n\nInternational journal of nursing practice 29 (5) e13195 2023/08/24\n\nAIM: The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors for household transmission of the omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2. BACKGROUND: The household infection rate has been reported to be higher for the omicron variant than for non-omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2. Determination of the risk factors for household transmission of the omicron variant is therefore important. DESIGN: A Retrospective Cohort Study was conducted. METHODS: When family members of health care workers (HCWs) were found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, the HCWs had to receive two nucleic acid amplification tests for SARS-CoV-2: immediately after and 5 to 10 days after the onset of COVID-19 in the family members. Risk factors of household transmission were analysed by comparing cases (HCWs infected with SARS-CoV-2) and controls (HCWs not infected with SARS-CoV-2) using multivariable analysis. RESULTS: Unvaccinated status (OR: 3.97), age of index cases (≤6 years) (OR: 1.94) and staying at home with index cases (OR: 10.18) were risk factors for household transmission. CONCLUSION: If there is a strong desire to avoid household infection, family members infected with SARS-CoV-2 should live separately during the period of viral shedding.\n\nHiroyuki Kimura, Masahiro Onozawa, Shota Yoshida, Naoki Miyashita, Shota Yokoyama, Toshihiro Matsukawa, Shinsuke Hirabayashi, Hideki Goto, Tomoyuki Endo, Satoshi Oguri, Shinichi Fujisawa, Akio Mori, Takeshi Kondo, Daisuke Hidaka, Kohei Okada, Shuichi Ota, Yasutaka Kakinoki, Yutaka Tsutsumi, Satoshi Yamamoto, Takuto Miyagishima, Junichi Hashiguchi, Takahiro Nagashima, Makoto Ibata, Kentaro Wakasa, Yoshihito Haseyama, Katsuya Fujimoto, Toshimichi Ishihara, Hajime Sakai, Takanori Teshima\n\nAnnals of hematology 2023/08/19\n\nIKZF1 deletion is a recurrent genomic alteration in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and is divided into dominant-negative (DN) and loss of function (LOF) deletions. The prognostic impact of each deletion has not been fully elucidated. We retrospectively analyzed 117 patients with adult B-ALL including 60 patients with BCR::ABL1-positive B-ALL and 57 patients with BCR::ABL1-negative B-ALL by the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) method for IKZF1 deletion and multiplex PCR for the 4 most common IKZF1 deletions (∆4-7, ∆2-7, ∆2-8, and ∆4-8). Samples, in which IKZF1 deletion was detected by FISH but a specific type of deletion was not identified by the PCR, were categorized as \"other.\" Patients were classified into a DN group that had at least 1 allele of ∆4-7 (n = 23), LOF and other group (n = 40), and wildtype group (n = 54). DN type IKZF1 deletions were found in 33.3% of BCR::ABL1-positive cases and 5.2% of BCR::ABL1-negative cases. LOF and other type IKZF1 deletions were found in 43.4% of BCR::ABL1-positive cases and 24.6% of BCR::ABL1-negative cases. Patients with the DN group showed significantly higher overall survival (OS) than that of the LOF and other and WT groups (P = 0.011). Multivariate analysis including age, WBC counts, complex karyotype, and DN type IKZF1 deletion showed that the DN type of IKZF1 deletion (HR = 0.22, P = 0.013) had a positive impact and age ≥ 65 (HR = 1.92, P = 0.029) had a negative impact on OS. The prognostic impact of IKZF1 deletion depends on the type of deletion and DN type of IKZF1 deletion showed better prognosis in adult B-ALL patients.Clinical trial registration This study was part of a prospective observational study (Hokkaido Leukemia Net, UMIN000048611).

However, there are little data regarding the clinical significance of NUP98::NSD1 in adult cohort. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter retrospective study to investigate the prevalence, clinical characteristics, and prognostic impact of NUP98::NSD1 in adult FLT3-ITD-positive AML patients. RESULTS: In a total of 97 FLT3-ITD-positive AML patients, six cases (6.2%) were found to harbor the NUP98::NSD1 fusion transcript. NUP98::NSD1 positive cases had significantly higher platelet counts and a higher frequency of FAB-M4 morphology than NUP98::NSD1 negative cases. NUP98::NSD1 was found to be mutually exclusive with NPM1 mutation, and was accompanied by the WT1 mutation in three of the six cases. The presence of NUP98::NSD1 fusion at the time of diagnosis predicted poor response to cytarabine-anthracycline-based intensive induction chemotherapy (induction failure rate: 83% vs. 36%, p = .038). Five of the six cases with NUP98::NSD1 underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Two of the five cases have successfully maintained remission, with one of them being rescued through a second HSCT. CONCLUSIONS: Detecting NUP98::NSD1 in adult FLT3-ITD-positive AML is crucial to recognizing chemotherapy-resistant group.\n\nMomoka Kikuchi, Takahito Iwai, Mutsumi Nishida, Yusuke Kudo, Satomi Omotehara, Megumi Sato, Junichi Sugita, Hideki Goto, Isao Yokota, Takanori Teshima\n\nJournal of medical ultrasonics (2001) 2023/07/04\n\nPURPOSE: Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) is a fatal complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Previously, we established a scoring system (Hokkaido ultrasound-based scoring system-10; HokUS-10) comprising 10 ultrasound parameters for SOS diagnosis. In HokUS-10, the portal vein time-averaged flow velocity (PV TAV) and hepatic artery resistive index (HA RI) are measured using subcostal scanning. However, measurement errors and delineation difficulties occur. Therefore, we aimed to prospectively evaluate PV TAV and HA RI measurements obtained via intercostal scanning as an alternative method to subcostal scanning and determine their cutoff values. METHODS: HokUS-10 was administered before and after HSCT. PV TAV and HA RI were measured on subcostal and right intercostal scans. RESULTS: We performed 366 scans on 74 patients. The median value (range) of PV TAV in the main and right portal veins was 15.0 cm/s (2.2-49.6 cm/s) and 10.5 cm/s (1.6-22.0 cm/s), respectively. A low correlation was observed between the two values (r = 0.39, p < 0.01). The highest diagnostic value of the right portal vein was less than 8.0 cm/s. The median value (range) of HA RI in the proper and right hepatic arteries was 0.72 (0.52-1.00) and 0.70 (0.51-1.00), respectively. A strong correlation was observed between the two values (r = 0.65, p < 0.01). The highest diagnostic value of the right HA RI was 0.72 or higher. CONCLUSION: Quantitative measurement of PV TAV and HA RI using intercostal scanning can be appropriately performed as an alternative method to using subcostal scanning.\n\nRyo Kikuchi, Masahiro Onozawa, Jun Nagai, Satomi Okada, Yuta Hasegawa, Hiroyuki Ohigashi, Shintaro Mitamura, Taku Maeda, Emi Takakuwa, Yuichiro Fujieda, Hideki Goto, Daigo Hashimoto, Yoshihiro Matsuno, Takanori Teshima\n\nInternal medicine (Tokyo, Japan) 2023/06/14\n\nCryoglobulins are immunoglobulins that precipitate in cold conditions. Type I cryoglobulinemic vasculitis is associated with hematological malignancies. We herein report a case of steroid-resistant type 1 cryoglobulinemic vasculitis associated with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) in a 47-year-old woman. By immunofixation of cryoglobulin, we found that the main component of cryoglobulin was the M protein due to MGUS, so treatment of MGUS was needed. Bortezomib+dexamethasone therapy resulted in a rapid decrease in cryoglobulin and improvement in the symptoms of cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. In refractory type I cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, treatment of the underlying gammaglobulinopathy should be considered.\n\nMachiko Otani, Teiichiro Shiino, Atsuko Hachiya, Hiroyuki Gatanaga, Dai Watanabe, Rumi Minami, Masako Nishizawa, Takanori Teshima, Shigeru Yoshida, Toshihiro Ito, Tsunefusa Hayashida, Michiko Koga, Mami Nagashima, Kenji Sadamasu, Makiko Kondo, Shingo Kato, Shunsuke Uno, Toshibumi Taniguchi, Hidetoshi Igari, Sei Samukawa, Hideaki Nakajima, Yusuke Yoshino, Masahide Horiba, Hiroshi Moro, Tamayo Watanabe, Mayumi Imahashi, Yoshiyuki Yokomaku, Haruyo Mori, Teruhisa Fujii, Kiyonori Takada, Asako Nakamura, Hideta Nakamura, Masao Tateyama, Shuzo Matsushita, Kazuhisa Yoshimura, Wataru Sugiura, Tetsuro Matano, Tadashi Kikuchi\n\nJournal of the International AIDS Society 26 (5) 1758-2652 2023/05/23 [Refereed]\n\nHajime Senjo, Shinpei Harada, Shimpei I Kubota, Yuki Tanaka, Takahiro Tateno, Zixuan Zhang, Satomi Okada, Xuanzhong Chen, Ryo Kikuchi, Naoki Miyashita, Masahiro Onozawa, Hideki Goto, Tomoyuki Endo, Yuta Hasegawa, Hiroyuki Ohigashi, Takahide Ara, Yoshinori Hasegawa, Masaaki Murakami, Takanori Teshima, Daigo Hashimoto\n\nBlood Journal 0006-4971 2023/05/22 [Refereed]\n\nCalcineurin inhibitor-based graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis is standard in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) but fails to induce long-term tolerance without chronic GVHD in a considerable number of patients. In this study, we addressed this long-standing question in mouse models of HCT. After HCT, alloreactive donor T cells rapidly differentiated into PD-1+ TIGIT+ terminally exhausted T cells (terminal-Tex). GVHD prophylaxis with cyclosporine (CSP) suppressed donor T-cell expression of TOX, a master regulator to promote differentiation of transitory exhausted T cells (transitory-Tex), expressing both inhibitory receptors and effector molecules, into terminal-Tex, and inhibited tolerance induction. Adoptive transfer of transitory-Tex, but not terminal-Tex, into secondary recipients developed chronic GVHD. Transitory-Tex maintained alloreactivity and thus PD-1 blockade restored graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) activity of transitory-Tex, not terminal-Tex. In conclusion, CSP inhibits tolerance induction by suppressing the terminal exhaustion of donor T cells, while maintaining GVL effects to suppress leukemia relapse.\n\nYutaka Tsutsumi, Shinichi Ito, Souichi Shiratori, Takanori Teshima\n\nCancers 15 (10) 2852 - 2852 2023/05/21 [Refereed]\n\nThe hepatitis C virus (HCV) is potentially associated with liver cancer, and advances in various drugs have led to progress in the treatment of hepatitis C and attempts to prevent its transition to liver cancer. Furthermore, reactivation of HCV has been observed in the treatment of lymphoma, during which the immortalization and proliferation of lymphocytes occur, which leads to the possibility of further stimulating cytokines and the like and possibly to the development of lymphoid malignancy. There are also cases in which the disappearance of lymphoid malignancy has been observed by treating HCV and suppressing HCV-Ribonucleic acid (RNA), as well as cases of recurrence with an increase in HCV-RNA. While HCV-associated lymphoma has a poor prognosis, improving the prognosis with Direct Acting Antivirals (DAA) has recently been reported. The reduction and eradication of HCV-RNA by means of DAA is thus important for the treatment of lymphoid malignancy associated with HCV infection, and HCV-RNA can presumably play a role as a biomarker. This review provides an overview of what is currently known about HCV-associated lymphoma, its epidemiology, the mechanisms underlying the progression to lymphoma, its treatment, the potential and limits of HCV-RNA as a therapeutic biomarker, and biomarkers that are expected now that DAA therapy has been developed.\n\nSuguru Kurosawa, Keisuke Imafuku, Sho Nakakubo, Sumio Iwasaki, Takanori Teshima, Hideki Goto, Hideyuki Ujiie\n\nInternational journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases 2023/05/15\n\nMycobacterium genavense is a rare type of non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) that has been reported to cause disseminated infections in immunocompromised patients. Because M. genavense is slow-growing and poorly able to form colonies on Ogawa's medium, genetic and molecular analyses are necessary to identify this pathogen. NTM infections present with various cutaneous manifestations. Of these, rare cases have been reported to present with mycobacterial pseudotumors. However, there are no reports of M. genavense with cutaneous pseudotumors. In this paper, we report a case of a pseudotumor due to M. genavense infection that was observed only in a cutaneous lesion. The patient was taking 5 mg of prednisolone and was aware of a tumor on the right lower leg. Biopsy samples showed diffuse spindle-shaped histiocytes and various other inflammatory cell infiltrates, and Ziehl-Neelsen staining detected mycobacterium. Since no colonies formed on Ogawa medium, genetic testing was performed, and M. genavense was identified by DNA sequence analysis. There were no other disseminated lesions beyond the skin, including in the lungs and liver. Since the patient was immunosuppressed, in accordance with previous literature, a combination therapy of clarithromycin, ethambutol, and rifampicin for 4 months was recommended. When no growth is observed on Ogawa's medium in cases of infection, it is essential to identify the infectious pathogen by genetic analysis.\n\nMycobacterium genavenseによる限局性の皮膚感染症を呈した1例\n\n黒澤 卓, 今福 恵輔, 宮澤 元, 中久保 祥, 岩崎 澄央, 後藤 秀樹, 豊嶋 崇徳, 氏家 英之\n\n日本臨床皮膚科医会雑誌 日本臨床皮膚科医会 40 (3) 470 - 470 1349-7758 2023/05\n\nStephan A Grupp, Selim Corbacioglu, Hyoung Jin Kang, Takanori Teshima, Seong Lin Khaw, Franco Locatelli, Johan Maertens, Matthias Stelljes, Polina Stepensky, Paty Lopez, Vian Amber, Antonio Pagliuca, Paul G Richardson, Mohamad Mohty\n\nThe Lancet Haematology 10 (5) e333 - e345 2352-3026 2023/05 [Refereed]\n\nHideki Goto, Toshio Kitawaki, Nobuharu Fujii, Koji Kato, Yasushi Onishi, Noriko Fukuhara, Takuji Yamauchi, Kazunori Toratani, Hiroki Kobayashi, Shota Yoshida, Masatoshi Shimo, Koichi Onodera, Hajime Senjo, Masahiro Onozawa, Kenji Hirata, Isao Yokota, Takanori Teshima\n\nInternational Journal of Clinical Oncology 28 (6) 816 - 826 1341-9625 2023/04/18 [Refereed]\n\nBACKGROUND: Tisagenlecleucel, an autologous CD19-directed T-cell immunotherapy, can induce a durable response in adult patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) B-cell lymphoma. METHODS: To elucidate the outcome of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy in Japanese, we retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of 89 patients who received tisagenlecleucel for r/r diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n = 71) or transformed follicular lymphoma (n = 18). RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 6.6-months, 65 (73.0%) patients achieved a clinical response. The overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) rates at 12 months were 67.0% and 46.3%, respectively. Overall, 80 patients (89.9%) had cytokine release syndrome (CRS), and 6 patients (6.7%) had a grade ≥ 3 event. ICANS occurred in 5 patients (5.6%); only 1 patient had grade 4 ICANS. Representative infectious events of any grade were cytomegalovirus viremia, bacteremia and sepsis. The most common other adverse events were ALT elevation, AST elevation, diarrhea, edema, and creatinine elevation. No treatment-related mortality was observed. A Sub-analysis showed that a high metabolic tumor volume (MTV; ≥ 80 ml) and stable disease /progressive disease before tisagenlecleucel infusion were both significantly associated with a poor EFS and OS in a multivariate analysis (P < 0.05). Notably, the combination of these 2 factors efficiently stratified the prognosis of these patients (HR 6.87 [95% CI 2.4-19.65; P < 0.05] into a high-risk group). CONCLUSION: We report the first real-world data on tisagenlecleucel for r/r B-cell lymphoma in Japan. Tisagenlecleucel is feasible and effective, even in late line treatment.

We selected 74 newly diagnosed, cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) samples in which FLT3-ITD was not detected by gel electrophoresis. We sequenced them using NGS and found minute FLT3-ITDs in 19 cases. We compared cases with clinically relevant FLT3-ITD (n = 37), cases with minute FLT3-ITD (n = 19) and cases without detectable FLT3-ITD (n = 55). Molecular characteristics (location and length) of minute FLT3-ITD were similar to those of clinically relevant FLT3-ITD. Survival of cases with minute FLT3-ITD was similar to that of cases without detectable FLT3-ITD, whereas the relapse rate within 1 year after onset was significantly higher in cases with minute FLT3-ITD. We followed 18 relapsed samples of cases with clinically FLT3-ITD-negative at diagnosis. Two of 3 cases with minute FLT3-ITD relapsed with progression to clinically relevant FLT3-ITD. Two of 15 cases in which FLT3-ITD was not detected by NGS relapsed with the emergence of minute FLT3-ITD, and one of them showed progression to clinically relevant FLT3-ITD at the second relapse. We revealed the clonal dynamics of subclinical minute FLT3-ITD in clinically FLT3-ITD-negative AML. Minute FLT3-ITD at the initial AML can expand to become a dominant clone at relapse.\n\nDavid Bernard Miklos, Mohammad Abu Zaid, Julian P. Cooney, Jörn C. Albring, Mary Flowers, Alan P.

METHODS Patients (age ≥ 12 years) with newly diagnosed moderate or severe cGVHD, requiring systemic corticosteroid therapy, and with no prior systemic treatment for cGVHD were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive ibrutinib 420 mg once daily plus prednisone, starting at 1 mg/kg once daily or placebo plus prednisone. The primary end point was response rate at 48 weeks according to 2014 National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Project Criteria. Other end points included event-free survival, duration of response, time to withdrawal of immunosuppressants, improvement in Lee cGVHD Symptom Scale score, overall survival (OS), and safety. RESULTS Ninety-five and 98 patients enrolled in the ibrutinib-prednisone and placebo-prednisone arms, respectively. At 48 weeks, response rates were 41% (ibrutinib-prednisone) and 37% (placebo-prednisone; P = .54). At 33 months of follow-up, median duration of response was 19 months (ibrutinib-prednisone) and 10 months (placebo-prednisone; P = .10). Median event-free survival was 15 months (ibrutinib-prednisone) and 8 months (placebo-prednisone; hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.54 to 1.1; P = .11). Improvement in overall Lee cGVHD Symptom Scale was 43% (ibrutinib-prednisone) and 31% (placebo-ibrutinib; P = .07). Median OS was not reached in either arm. The 24-month Kaplan-Meier OS estimates were 80% for both arms (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.59 to 1.90). Grade ≥ 3 serious adverse events occurred in 49% (ibrutinib-prednisone) and 47% (placebo-prednisone) of patients. CONCLUSION There was no statistical difference observed in the primary and secondary end points with ibrutinib-prednisone treatment.

Disruption of intestinal microbiota homeostasis, dysbiosis, is associated with fibrosis development in NASH. An antimicrobial peptide α-defensin secreted by Paneth cells in the small intestine is known to regulate composition of the intestinal microbiota. However, involvement of α-defensin in NASH remains unknown. Here, we show that in diet-induced NASH model mice, decrease of fecal α-defensin along with dysbiosis occurs before NASH onset. When α-defensin levels in the intestinal lumen are restored by intravenous administration of R-Spondin1 to induce Paneth cell regeneration or by oral administration of α-defensins, liver fibrosis is ameliorated with dissolving dysbiosis. Furthermore, R-Spondin1 and α-defensin improved liver pathologies together with different features in the intestinal microbiota. These results indicate that decreased α-defensin secretion induces liver fibrosis through dysbiosis, further suggesting Paneth cell α-defensin as a potential therapeutic target for NASH.\n\nMirei Kobayashi, Akio Mori, Masahiro Onozawa, Shihori Tsukamoto, Hajime Senjo, Takashi Ishio, Emi Yokoyama, Minoru Kanaya, Koh Izumiyama, Makoto Saito, Haruna Muraki, Masanobu Morioka, Takanori Teshima, Takeshi Kondo\n\nAnnals of Hematology 102 (4) 819 - 827 0939-5555 2023/03/02 [Refereed]\n\nAbstract Patients with lymphoid malignancies have impaired humoral immunity caused by the disease itself and its treatment, placing them at risk for severe coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) and reduced response to vaccination. However, data for COVID-19 vaccine responses in patients with mature T cell and NK-cell neoplasms are very limited. In this study of 19 patients with mature T/NK-cell neoplasms, anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike antibodies were measured at 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months after the second mRNA-based vaccination. At the time of the second and third vaccinations, 31.6% and 15.4% of the patients were receiving active treatment. All patients received the primary vaccine dose and the third vaccination rate was 68.4%. In patients with mature T/NK-cell neoplasms, both seroconversion rate (p < 0.01) and antibody titers (p < 0.01) after the second vaccination were significantly lower than those in healthy controls (HC). In individuals who received the booster dose, patients had significantly lower antibody titers than those in HC (p < 0.01); however, the seroconversion rate in patients was 100%, which was the same as that in HC. The booster vaccine resulted in a significant increase of antibodies in elderly patients who had shown a response that was inferior to that in younger patients after two doses of vaccination. Since higher antibody titers and higher seroconversion rate reduced the incidence of infection and mortality, vaccination more than three times may have the advantage for patients with mature T/NK-cell neoplasms, especially in elderly patients.

We prospectively analyzed these genes in 295 patients with CN-AML and identified 76 (25.8%) FLT3-ITD, 113 (38.3%) NPM1 mutations, and 30 (10.2%) CEBPA biallelic mutations. We found that patients with FLT3-ITD had a poor prognosis at any age, while patients with CEBPA biallelic mutation were younger and had a better prognosis. FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutations were correlated, and the favorable prognostic impact of being FLT3-ITD negative and NPM1 mutation positive was evident only in patients aged 65 years or more. For CEBPA, 86.7% of the patients with biallelic mutation and 9.1% of patients with the single allele mutation had in-frame mutations in the bZIP domain, which were strongly associated with a favorable prognosis. Multivariate analysis showed that age < 65 years, FLT3-ITD and CEBPA bZIP in-frame mutation were independent prognostic factors. The results suggest that analyzing these gene mutations at diagnosis can inform selection of the optimal intensity of therapy for patients with CN-AML.\n\n中野 恵一, 安田 慶子, 清宮 正徳, 渡邊 千秋, 後藤 秀樹, 豊嶋 崇徳\n\n生物試料分析 (NPO)生物試料分析科学会 46 (1) 51 - 51 0913-3763 2023/02\n\nKeiichi Nakano, Junichi Sugita, Masanori Seimiya, Keiko Yasuda, Chiaki Watanabe, Hideki Goto, Takanori Teshima\n\nClinical Biochemistry 112 11 - 16 0009-9120 2023/02 [Refereed]\n\nBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Patients with immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-related disease (IgG4-RD) have elevated immunoglobulin E (IgE) concentration compared to that in healthy individuals, which suggests the occurrence of IgE-mediated allergic reactions. We have previously shown that IgG4 and IgE form a complex in some patients with IgG4-RD. However, it is currently unknown whether and how the presence of the IgG4-IgE complex affects IgE concentration measurements by different assays. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with confirmed presence or absence of IgG4-IgE complex were evaluated. We compared IgE concentrations measured by ST AIA-PACK IgE II (AIA-PACK), Elecsys IgE II Immunoassay (Elecsys), and Iatroace IgE (Iatroace) and evaluated to what extent the IgG4-IgE complex interfered with these measurements. RESULTS: In patients with the IgG4-IgE complex, IgE concentrations measured using Iatroace were significantly lower than those measured using Elecsys and tended to be lower than those measured using AIA-PACK. IgE concentrations determined by Iatroace were significantly different in patients with and without the IgG4-IgE complex, whereas no significant differences between these groups were detected when IgE concentrations were measured by AIA-PACK or Elecsys. CONCLUSION: The formation of the IgG4-IgE complex underestimates measured IgE concentrations depending on the method used. Therefore, caution should be exercised when selecting a specific IgE assay for patients with IgG4-RD.\n\nRoni Shouval, Nicholas R Waters, Antonio L C Gomes, Corrado Zuanelli Brambilla, Teng Fei, Sean M Devlin, Chi L Nguyen, Kate A Markey, Anqi Dai, John B Slingerland, Annelie G Clurman, Emily Fontana, Luigi A Amoretti, Roberta J Wright, Tobias M Hohl, Ying Taur, Anthony D Sung, Daniela Weber, Daigo Hashimoto, Takanori Teshima, Nelson J Chao, Ernst Holler, Michael Scordo, Sergio A Giralt, Miguel-Angel Perales, Jonathan U Peled, Marcel R M van den Brink\n\nClinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research 29 (1) 165 - 173 2023/01/04\n\nPURPOSE: The gut microbiota is subject to multiple insults in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) recipients. We hypothesized that preparative conditioning regimens contribute to microbiota perturbation in allo-HCT. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: This was a retrospective study that evaluated the relationship between conditioning regimens exposure in 1,188 allo-HCT recipients and the gut microbiome. Stool samples collected from 20 days before transplantation up to 30 days after were profiled using 16S rRNA sequencing. Microbiota injury was quantified by changes in α-diversity. RESULTS: We identified distinct patterns of microbiota injury that varied by conditioning regimen. Diversity loss was graded into three levels of conditioning-associated microbiota injury (CMBI) in a multivariable model that included antibiotic exposures. High-intensity regimens, such as total body irradiation (TBI)-thiotepa-cyclophosphamide, were associated with the greatest injury (CMBI III). In contrast, the nonmyeloablative regimen fludarabine-cyclophosphamide with low-dose TBI (Flu/Cy/TBI200) had a low-grade injury (CMBI I). The risk of acute GVHD correlated with CMBI degree. Pretransplant microbial compositions were best preserved with Flu/Cy/TBI200, whereas other regimens were associated with loss of commensal bacteria and expansion of Enterococcus. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support an interaction between conditioning at the regimen level and the extent of microbiota injury.\n\nShota Yoshida, Masahiro Onozawa, Naoki Miyashita, Hiroyuki Kimura, Shogo Takahashi, Shota Yokoyama, Toshihiro Matsukawa, Shinsuke Hirabayashi, Akio Mori, Daisuke Hidaka, Koichiro Minauchi, Akio Shigematsu, Junichi Hashiguchi, Tetsuyuki Igarashi, Yasutaka Kakinoki, Yutaka Tsutsumi, Makoto Ibata, Hajime Kobayashi, Yoshihito Haseyama, Katsuya Fujimoto, Toshimichi Ishihara, Hajime Sakai, Shuichi Ota, Takeshi Kondo, Takanori Teshima\n\nInternational Journal of Hematology 117 (4) 544 - 552 0925-5710 2022/12/26 [Refereed]\n\nComplex karyotype acute myeloid leukemia (CK-AML) has been classified as an adverse-risk subtype. Although a few reports have further classified CK-AML as typical (including monosomy of chromosomes 5, 7 and 17 or deletion of 5q, 7q and/or 17p) or atypical, the clinical features of these subtypes in Japanese patients remain unclear. We retrospectively analyzed a total of 115 patients with CK-AML, including 77 with typical CK-AML and 38 with atypical CK-AML. Median overall survival (OS) was significantly shorter in patients with typical CK-AML than atypical CK-AML (143 days vs. 369 days, P = 0.009). Among patients with typical CK-AML, those with monosomy 17 or deletion of 17p had significantly shorter OS than patients without such abnormalities (105 days vs. 165 days, P = 0.033). TP53 mutations were more predominant in patients with typical CK-AML than in patients with atypical CK-AML (69.7% vs. 32.4%, P < 0.001). Patients with typical CK-AML had a poor prognosis regardless of TP53 mutation status. Among patients with atypical CK-AML, however, prognosis was worse for those with the TP53 mutation than those without the mutation. In conclusion, prognosis is extremely poor for both typical CK-AML and atypical CK-AML with TP53 mutation.\n\nYoshimitsu Shimomura, Tetsuhisa Kitamura, Masashi Nishikubo, Tomotaka Sobue, Naoyuki Uchida, Noriko Doki, Masatsugu Tanaka, Ayumu Ito, Jun Ishikawa, Takahide Ara, Shuichi Ota, Makoto Onizuka, Masashi Sawa, Yukiyasu Ozawa, Yumiko Maruyama, Kazuhiro Ikegame, Yoshinobu Kanda, Tatsuo Ichinohe, Takahiro Fukuda, Shinichiro Okamoto, Takanori Teshima, Yoshiko Atsuta\n\nInternational Journal of Hematology 117 (4) 590 - 597 0925-5710 2022/12/14 [Refereed]\n\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic affected healthcare quality and access worldwide and may also have negatively affected the frequency and outcomes of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We evaluated the effect of the pandemic on allogeneic HSCT in Japan. Our subjects were patients who received allogeneic HSCT during January 2018-December 2020 in Japan. We assessed differences in yearly number of allogeneic HSCTs and 1-year outcomes in 2020 versus both 2019 and 2018. The total number of patients who received allogeneic HSCT increased from 3621 patients in 2018 and 3708 patients in 2019 to 3865 patients in 2020. Some following changes in allogeneic HSCT methods were observed: patients were older, fewer patients received bone marrow transplantation, fewer patients received transplants from unrelated donors, fewer patients received transplants from matched donors, more patients received reduced-intensity conditioning, and fewer patients received anti-thymocyte globulin in 2020 compared with previous years. HSCT outcomes were not affected, as 1-year overall survival was not significantly different (65.8% in 2020, vs. 66.5% in 2019 and 66.4% in 2018). Our results suggest that we can maintain transplant care during the pandemic by controlling the spread of COVID-19 and modifying HSCT methods.\n\nTakeshi Inoue, Ryo Shinnakasu, Chie Kawai, Hiromi Yamamoto, Shuhei Sakakibara, Chikako Ono, Yumi Itoh, Tommy Terooatea, Kazuo Yamashita, Toru Okamoto, Noritaka Hashii, Akiko Ishii-Watabe, Noah S.

To address the underlying mechanism for this differential antibody response, we examined spike receptor-binding domain (RBD)–specific memory B cells in vaccinated individuals. Frequency of Omicron-reactive memory B cells increased ∼9 mo after the second vaccine dose. These memory B cells show an altered distribution of epitopes from pre-second memory B cells, presumably due to an antibody feedback mechanism. This hypothesis was tested using mouse models, showing that an addition or a depletion of RBD-induced serum antibodies results in a concomitant increase or decrease, respectively, of Omicron-reactive germinal center (GC) and memory B cells. Our data suggest that pre-generated antibodies modulate the selection of GC and subsequent memory B cells after the second vaccine dose, accumulating more Omicron-reactive memory B cells over time, which contributes to the generation of Omicron-neutralizing antibodies elicited by the third vaccine dose.\n\nTakahito Iwai, Mutsumi Nishida, Junichi Sugita, Atsushi Yasumoto, Yuta Hasegawa, Tomoko Morimoto, Daishi Nakayama, Kohei Okada, Akio Mori, Takanori Teshima\n\nInternational journal of hematology 116 (6) 973 - 975 2022/12\n\nSandra Dupouy, Ibtissam Marchiq, Thibaud Derippe, Maria Almena-Carrasco, Agnieszka Jozwik, Sylvain Fouliard, Yasmina Adimy, Julia Geronimi, Charlotte Graham, Nitin Jain, Marcela V.

Methods: UCART19 was administered to 25 adult patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) in the CALM trial. All patients underwent lymphodepletion with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide ± alemtuzumab and received one of three ascending doses of UCART19. Given the allogeneic nature of UCART19, we analyzed the impact of lymphodepletion, HLA disparities, and host immune system reconstitution on its kinetics, along with other factors known to affect autologous CAR-T cell clinical pharmacology. Results: Responder patients (12/25) had higher UCART19 expansion (Cmax) and exposure (AUCTlast) than nonresponders (13/25), as measured by transgene levels in peripheral blood. The persistence of CAR+ T cells did not exceed 28 days in 10/25 patients and lasted beyond 42 days in 4/25. No significant correlation was found between UCART19 kinetics and administered cell dose, patient and product characteristics or HLA disparities. However, the number of prior lines of therapy and absence of alemtuzumab negatively impacted UCART19 expansion and persistence. Alemtuzumab exposure positively affected IL7 and UCART19 kinetics, while negatively correlating with host T lymphocyte AUC0-28. Conclusions: UCART19 expansion is a driver of response in adult patients with R/R B-ALL. These results shed light on the factors associated with UCART19 kinetics, which remain highly affected by the impact of alemtuzumab on IL7 and host-versus-graft rejection.

Reactive granulopoiesis is induced by profound neutropenia, but its mechanism remains to be clarified. We herein explored its mechanisms using mouse models of syngeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) and 5-fluorouracil-induced neutropenia. After SCT, T cell production of IL-17A was up-regulated. Neutrophil recovery was significantly delayed in IL-17A-deficient or T cell-deficient RAG1-/- mice, and adoptive transfer of wild-type (WT) T cells facilitated neutrophil engraftment. Gut decontamination with oral antibiotics suppressed T cell production of IL-17A and impaired neutrophil recovery. Transplantation of fecal microbiota collected from neutropenic, not naive, mice promoted neutrophil recovery in these mice, suggesting that neutropenia-associated microbiota had a potential to stimulate reactive granulopoiesis. Our study uncovered a cross talk between gut microbiota and neutropenia after SCT and chemotherapy.\n\nAkio Mori, Masahiro Onozawa, Mirei Kobayashi, Shihori Tsukamoto, Hajime Senjo, Takashi Ishio, Emi Yokoyama, Koh Izumiyama, Makoto Saito, Haruna Muraki, Masanobu Morioka, Takanori Teshima, Takeshi Kondo\n\nBritish Journal of Haematology 200 (6) 717 - 721 0007-1048 2022/11/28 [Refereed]\n\nData for COVID-19 vaccine response in patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) are very limited.

However, the antibody titre in ITP patients was significantly lower than that in HCs and declined with ageing. Furthermore, the antibody titre in ITP patients who received a minimum prednisolone dose of at least 5 mg/day at any time-point at or after initial vaccination was lower than that in other patients.\n\nNoriko Fukuhara, Koji Kato, Hideki Goto, Tajima Takeshi, Mayu Kawaguchi, Kota Tokushige, Koichi Akashi, Takanori Teshima, Hideo Harigae, Stephen J Schuster, Catherine Thieblemont, Martin Dreyling, Nathan Fowler\n\nInternational journal of hematology 117 (2) 251 - 259 2022/11/21\n\nBACKGROUND: Tisagenlecleucel yielded a high durable response rate in patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) follicular lymphoma (FL) in the global phase 2 ELARA trial. Here, we report the efficacy, safety, and cellular kinetics of tisagenlecleucel in a subgroup of Japanese patients with r/r FL from ELARA. METHODS: ELARA (NCT03568461) is a global single-arm trial of tisagenlecleucel in patients with r/r FL who received ≥ 2 prior lines of therapy. The primary endpoint was the complete response rate (CRR), and the secondary endpoints were the overall response rate, duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, safety, and cellular kinetics. RESULTS: As of March 29, 2021, nine Japanese patients were enrolled and received tisagenlecleucel with a median follow-up of 13.6 months (range, 10.5‒19.3). Per independent review committee, CRR was 100% (95% CI 63.1‒100). Within 8 weeks of infusion, cytokine release syndrome (CRS) of any grade was reported in 6 patients (66.7%); however, no grade ≥ 3 CRS or any grade serious neurological events or treatment-related deaths were observed. CONCLUSION: Tisagenlecleucel showed high efficacy and manageable safety in adult Japanese patients with r/r FL. Moreover, the clinical outcomes were similar to the global population, which supports the potential of tisagenlecleucel in Japanese patients with r/r FL.\n\nKoji Kato, Nobuharu Fujii, Shinichi Makita, Hideki Goto, Junya Kanda, Kazuyuki Shimada, Koichi Akashi, Koji Izutsu, Takanori Teshima, Natsuko Fukuda, Tokuhito Sumitani, Shota Nakamura, Hiroyuki Sumi, Shinji Shimizu, Yasuyuki Kakurai, Kenji Yoshikawa, Kensei Tobinai, Noriko Usui, Kiyohiko Hatake\n\nInternational journal of hematology 2022/11/18\n\nAxicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) is an autologous, CD19-targeting chimeric antigen receptor T‑cell therapy. We recently reported the 3-month follow-up results of a phase 2, multicenter, open‑label, single-arm study of axi-cel in Japanese patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) (JapicCTI-183914). Here, we present 1-year efficacy and safety data and biomarker analysis data regarding mechanisms of resistance to axi-cel. Primary and secondary endpoints included investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR), serious adverse events, and treatment-emergent adverse events. Axi-cel pharmacokinetics were also examined. Biomarker analysis was performed by cytokine measurement, immunohistochemistry, RNA sequencing, and whole-exome sequencing. At a median follow-up of 13.4 months, ORR was 86.7% (13/15 patients), and the complete response (CR) rate improved to 53.3% (8/15 patients) due to response conversion. Seven patients experienced disease progression, and one achieved CR after re-treatment with axi-cel. No new safety concerns were detected. Plausible resistance mechanisms to axi-cel varied among patients but included CD19 downregulation, programmed death-ligand 1 upregulation, and increased macrophage and angiogenesis signatures. The 1-year efficacy and safety of axi-cel were confirmed in Japanese patients with R/R LBCL. Resistance to treatment may involve multiple factors, including target antigen loss and an unfavorable tumor environment.Clinical trial registration: Japan Clinical Trials Information; JapicCTI-183914.\n\nKeiichi Nakano, Satoshi Sugawa, Masanori Seimiya, Satoshi Murakami, Keiko Yasuda, Chiaki Watanabe, Hideki Goto, Takanori Teshima\n\nLaboratory medicine 2022/11/02\n\nOBJECTIVE: Presence of autoantibodies against troponin I (cTnI) or T (cTnT) has been reported to interfere with troponin assays. However, the extent of the interference with the measurement has not been explored sufficiently. The aims of this study were to examine the frequencies of autoantibodies against troponin I and troponin T and how much these antibodies would affect the measurement. METHODS: The study comprised 52 subjects who visited Hokkaido University Hospital with suspected ischemic heart diseases. To evaluate the presence of autoantibodies, we calculated the recoveries of cTnI or cTnT after immunoglobulin G depletion, and the distributions of peaks reactive with cTnI or cTnT by high-performance liquid chromatography were examined. RESULTS: Autoantibodies against cTnI and cTnT were identified in 8 subjects (15.4%) and 1 subject (1.9%), respectively. Although the greatest difference between cTnI and cTnT was 32-fold, the distributions of cTnI-to-cTnT ratios in groups with and without anti-cTnI were not statistically different. CONCLUSION: Autoantibodies against cTnI were more frequent by several fold than those against cTnT. Their presence did not significantly expand the discrepancy between cTnI and cTnT assays.\n\n2021年度HIV-1薬剤耐性検査外部精度評価の報告\n\n吉田 繁, 松田 昌和, 今橋 真弓, 岡田 清美, 齊藤 浩一, 林田 庸総, 佐藤 かおり, 藤澤 真一, 遠藤 知之, 西澤 雅子, 椎野 禎一郎, 潟永 博之, 豊嶋 崇徳, 杉浦 亙, 吉村 和久, 菊地 正\n\n日本エイズ学会誌 (一社)日本エイズ学会 24 (4) 401 - 401 1344-9478 2022/11\n\n2021年の国内新規診断未治療HIV感染者・AIDS患者における薬剤耐性HIV-1の動向\n\n菊地 正, 西澤 雅子, 小島 潮子, 大谷 眞智子, 椎野 禎一郎, 俣野 哲朗, 佐藤 かおり, 豊嶋 崇徳, 伊藤 俊広, 林田 庸総, 潟永 博之, 岡 慎一, 古賀 道子, 長島 真美, 貞升 健志, 近藤 真規子, 宇野 俊介, 谷口 俊文, 猪狩 英俊, 寒川 整, 中島 秀明, 吉野 友祐, 堀場 昌英, 茂呂 寛, 渡邉 珠代, 蜂谷 敦子, 今橋 真弓, 松田 昌和, 重見 麗, 岡崎 玲子, 岩谷 靖雅, 横幕 能行, 渡邊 大, 阪野 文哉, 森 治代, 藤井 輝久, 高田 清式, 中村 麻子, 南 留美, 山本 政弘, 松下 修三, 饒平名 聖, 仲村 秀太, 健山 正男, 藤田 次郎, 吉村 和久, 杉浦 亙\n\n日本エイズ学会誌 (一社)日本エイズ学会 24 (4) 401 - 401 1344-9478 2022/11\n\n大腿骨人工骨頭インプラント周囲に発症したALK陰性未分化大細胞型リンパ腫の1例\n\n森 祐斗, 荒 隆英, 中川 雅夫, 吉田 匠汰, 斎藤 祐美花, 横山 翔大, 松川 敏大, 白鳥 聡一, 遠藤 知之, 豊嶋 崇徳\n\n臨床血液 (一社)日本血液学会-東京事務局 63 (11) 1592 - 1593 0485-1439 2022/11\n\nKaoru Murakami, Sumio Iwasaki, Satoshi Oguri, Kumiko Tanaka, Rigel Suzuki, Kasumi Hayasaka, Shinichi Fujisawa, Chiaki Watanabe, Satoshi Konno, Isao Yokota, Takasuke Fukuhara, Masaaki Murakami, Takanori Teshima\n\nJournal of clinical virology plus 2 (4) 100109 - 100109 2022/11\n\nThe Omicron emerged in November 2021 and became the predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant globally.

Haematology 2022/10/10\n\nBACKGROUND: The prognosis for adults with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia remains poor. UCART19, an allogeneic genome-edited anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell product derived from healthy donors and available for immediate clinical use, offers a potential therapeutic option for such patients. The CALM trial is a first-in-human study evaluating the safety and antileukaemic activity of UCART19 in adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. METHODS: This phase 1, open-label study was conducted at eight centres across France, the UK, the USA, and Japan. Adult patients aged 16-70 years with CD19-positive relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia who had morphological relapse or a minimal residual disease level of at least 1 × 10-3 and had exhausted standard treatment options were enrolled in the study, which comprised a dose-escalation phase of up to three UCART19 doses followed by a safety expansion phase. Patients underwent lymphodepletion with fludarabine (30 mg/m2 per day intravenously for 3 days) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2 per day intravenously for 3 days) with or without alemtuzumab (1 mg/kg or 40 mg or 60 mg over 5 days) and received UCART19 doses of 6 × 106, 6-8 × 107, or 1·8-2·4 × 108 total CAR T cells intravenously, followed by safety evaluation and disease response assessments. The primary endpoint was incidence and severity of adverse events. Secondary endpoints were the overall response rate, duration of response, relapse-free survival, progression-free survival, and overall survival. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02746952) and is complete. FINDINGS: Between Aug 1, 2016, and June 30, 2020, 25 patients were enrolled in the study and treated with UCART19. Median duration of follow-up was 12·8 months (IQR 2·8-24·8). Median age was 37 years (IQR 28-45). 14 (56%) patients were male and 11 (44%) female. 17 (68%) patients were White, two (8%) Black, two (8%) Asian, and four (16%) from other racial or ethnic groups. Three patients developed dose-limiting toxicities (one at each dose level); one had grade 4 cytokine release syndrome and two had grade 4 prolonged cytopenias. Grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome was reported in six (24%) patients and grade 3 or higher neurological toxicity in one (4%) patient. Grade 3 or higher infections occurred in seven (28%) patients, and grade 4 prolonged cytopenia in four (16%) patients. Two (8%) patients developed grade 1 acute cutaneous graft-versus-host disease. 14 patients died, nine from progressive disease and five from infections or other complications, of which four were considered to be related to UCART19 or lymphodepletion, or both. After a median of follow-up of 12·8 months (IQR 2·8-24·8), overall response rate was 48% (95% CI 28-69; 12 of 25 patients), duration of response and median relapse-free survival were 7·4 months (95% CI 1·8 to not calculable), progression-free survival was 2·1 months (95% CI 1·2-2·8), and overall survival was 13·4 months (95% CI 4·8-23·0). INTERPRETATION: UCART19 had a manageable safety profile, and showed evidence of antileukaemic activity in heavily pretreated adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. This study shows that allogeneic off-the-shelf CAR T cells can be used safely to treat patients with relapsed B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.

In this retrospective registry study, we compared GvHD organ distribution, severity, and outcomes in patients with GvHD occurring after Haplo transplantation with PTCy GvHD prophylaxis (Haplo/PTCy) versus HLA-matched unrelated donor transplantation with conventional prophylaxis (MUD/conventional). We evaluated 2 cohorts: patients with grade 2 to 4 acute GvHD (aGvHD) including 264 and 1163 recipients of Haplo and MUD transplants; and patients with any chronic GvHD (cGvHD) including 206 and 1018 recipients of Haplo and MUD transplants, respectively. In comparison with MUD/conventional transplantation ± antithymocyte globulin (ATG), grade 3-4 aGvHD (28% versus 39%, P = .001), stage 3-4 lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract aGvHD (14% versus 21%, P = .01), and chronic GI GvHD (21% versus 31%, P = .006) were less common after Haplo/PTCy transplantation. In patients with grade 2-4 aGvHD, cGvHD rate after Haplo/PTCY was also lower (hazard ratio [HR] = .4, P < .001) in comparison with MUD/conventional transplantation without ATG in the nonmyeloablative conditioning setting. Irrespective of the use of ATG, non-relapse mortality rate was lower (HR = .6, P = .01) after Haplo/PTCy transplantation, except for transplants that were from a female donor into a male recipient. In patients with cGvHD, irrespective of ATG use, Haplo/PTCy transplantation had lower non-relapse mortality rates (HR = .6, P = .04).

Our results suggest that PTCy-based GvHD prophylaxis mitigates the development of GI GvHD and may translate into lower GvHD-related non-relapse mortality rate.\n\nTakahide Ara, Tomoyuki Endo, Hideki Goto, Kohei Kasahara, Yuta Hasegawa, Shota Yokoyama, Souichi Shiratori, Masao Nakagawa, Ken Kuwahara, Emi Takakuwa, Satoshi Hashino, Takanori Teshima\n\nAntiviral therapy 27 (5) 13596535221126828 - 13596535221126828 2022/10\n\nEpstein-Barr virus-associated smooth muscle tumor (EBV-SMT) is a rare mesenchymal tumor which occurs in immunocompromised patients. The immune status is an important factor in the treatment of EBV-SMTs, but the efficacy of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is not elucidated in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) related EBV-SMTs. Here, we report the first successful case of a 29-year-old man with hepatic AIDS related EBV-SMT treated with ART solely. Positron emission tomography scan was useful for the evaluation of disease status.

In this phase 1 dose-escalation study (NCT03985189), 9 Japanese patients with relapsed/refractory indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (R/R iNHL) received zandelisib on a continuous daily schedule (45 or 60 mg) until progressive disease/unacceptable toxicity. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached. At a median follow-up of 17.5 months, Grade ≥ 3 treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in 2 or more patients were neutrophil count decreased (55.6%; 5/9) and diarrhea (33.3%; 3/9). Immune-related toxicities, including hepatobiliary disorder, aspartate/alanine aminotransferase increased, diarrhea/colitis, organizing pneumonia, stomatitis, and rash, led to zandelisib discontinuation in 4 patients. The investigator-assessed ORR, based on modified Lugano criteria, was 100%, including 2 complete responses (22.2%; in follicular lymphoma patients receiving 60 mg/day). Median duration of response, progression-free survival, and time to response were 7.9, 11.1, and 1.9 months, respectively. Zandelisib demonstrated a manageable safety profile at 60 mg, the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) in Japanese patients. The RP2D resulted in favorable pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor efficacy in Japanese patients with R/R iNHL.Trial registration.

Recipients of first HCT for acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes between 2012 and 2015 were included. The analyzed subjects comprised UBMT recipients with 8/8 matched HLA alleles (n = 1470), 7/8 matched alleles (n = 859), 6/8 matched alleles (n = 186), and recipients of PTCy-haploPBSCT (n = 133). In multivariate analyses with 8/8 matched UBMT as the reference, PTCy-haploPBSCT showed similar overall mortality, decreased risk of non-relapse mortality (NRM), increased risk of relapse, and decreased risk of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and chronic GVHD. Adjusted probabilities for 8/8 matched UBMT, PTCy-haploPBSCT, and 7/8 and 6/8 matched UBMT groups at 2 years post-transplant were 61%, 60%, 58%, and 52% for overall survival, 23%, 28%, 21%, and 19% for relapse, and 20%, 7%, 24%, and 33% for NRM. PTCy-haploPBSCT was associated with remarkably low NRM, contributing to survival outcomes that were comparable to 8/8 matched UBMT. The higher relapse rate in the PTCy-haploPBSCT group might be associated with the higher proportion of high-risk patients. PTCy-haploPBSCT may be a viable alternative when HLA-matched related donors are not available.\n\nMasaki Ri, Kenshi Suzuki, Tadao Ishida, Junya Kuroda, Taku Tsukamoto, Takanori Teshima, Hideki Goto, Carolyn C Jackson, Huabin Sun, Lida Pacaud, Ei Fujikawa, Tzu-Min Yeh, Tomoyoshi Hatayama, Kensuke Aida, Yoshihiro Sunagawa, Shinsuke Iida\n\nCancer science 2022/09/02\n\nChimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting B-cell maturation antigen have shown positive responses in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). The phase 2 portion of the CARTITUDE-1 study of ciltacabtagene autoleucel (cilta-cel) included a cohort of Japanese patients with relapsed/refractory MM. Following a conditioning regimen of cyclophosphamide (300 mg/m2 ) and fludarabine (30 mg/m2 ), patients received a single cilta-cel infusion at a target dose of 0.75 × 106 (range, 0.5-1.0 × 106 ) CAR-positive viable T cells/kg. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR; defined as partial response or better) by International Myeloma Working Group criteria. A key secondary endpoint was the rate of very good partial response (VGPR) or better (defined as VGPR, complete response, stringent complete response). This first analysis was performed at 6 months after the last patient received cilta-cel. Thirteen patients underwent apheresis, nine of whom received cilta-cel infusion. Eight patients who received cilta-cel at the target dose responded, yielding an ORR of 100%. Seven of eight (87.5%) patients achieved a VGPR or better. One additional patient who received a below-target dose of cilta-cel also achieved a best response of VGPR. MRD negativity (10-5 threshold) was achieved in all six evaluable patients. Eight of nine (88.9%) patients who received cilta-cel infusion experienced a grade 3 or 4 adverse event, and eight (88.9%) patients experienced cytokine release syndrome (all grade 1 or 2). No CAR-T cell neurotoxicity was reported. A positive benefit/risk profile for cilta-cel was established for heavily pretreated Japanese patients with relapsed or refractory MM.\n\nSouichi Shiratori, Kohei Okada, Satomi Matsuoka, Shinichi Ito, Junichi Sugita, Takanori Teshima\n\nAnnals of hematology 101 (9) 2117 - 2118 2022/09\n\nMinori Tamai, Shinichi Fujisawa, Thao T T Nguyen, Chiaki Komatsu, Keiko Kagami, Kenji Kamimoto, Kohei Omachi, Shin Kasai, Daisuke Harama, Atsushi Watanabe, Koshi Akahane, Kumiko Goi, Kazuhito Naka, Tadashi Kaname, Takanori Teshima, Takeshi Inukai\n\nCancer gene therapy 2022/08/23\n\nThe Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome was the first translocation identified in leukemia. It is supposed to be generated by aberrant ligation between two DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) at the BCR gene located on chromosome 9q34 and the ABL1 gene located on chromosome 22q11. Thus, mimicking the initiation process of translocation, we induced CRISPR/Cas9-mediated DSBs simultaneously at the breakpoints of the BCR and ABL1 genes in a granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) dependent human leukemia cell line. After transfection of two single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting intron 13 of the BCR gene and intron 1 of the ABL1 gene, a factor-independent subline was obtained. In the subline, p210 BCR::ABL1 and its reciprocal ABL1::BCR fusions were generated as a result of balanced translocation corresponding to the Ph chromosome. Another set of sgRNAs targeting intron 1 of the BCR gene and intron 1 of the ABL1 gene induced a factor-independent subline expressing p190 BCR::ABL1. Both p210 and p190 BCR::ABL1 induced factor-independent growth by constitutively activating intracellular signaling pathways for transcriptional regulation of cell cycle progression and cell survival that are usually regulated by GM-CSF. These observations suggested that simultaneous DSBs at the BCR and ABL1 gene breakpoints are initiation events for oncogenesis in Ph+ leukemia.

We conducted a matched-pair analysis of PTCy-haplo and UCBT using the Japanese registry data. We identified 136 patients aged between 16 and 69 years who received PTCy-haplo as their first transplantation for acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes. Control group included 408 UCBT recipients selected to match the PTCy-haplo group. Overall and relapse-free survival probabilities at 2 years were comparable between the PTCy-haplo and UCBT groups: 55% vs. 53% for overall survival (p = 0.46), and 47% vs. 48% for relapse-free survival (p = 0.79), respectively. The cumulative incidence of relapse was significantly higher (43% vs. 29%, respectively, p = 0.006), while the cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality (NRM) was significantly lower (9% vs. 23%, respectively, p < 0.001) in the PTCy-haplo group. The cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was lower in the PTCy-haplo group compared to the UCBT group (29% vs. 41%, respectively, p = 0.016), while those of grade III-IV acute GVHD and chronic GVHD were not statistically different between the two groups.

Accumulating evidence demonstrates that escape from adaptive immunity is a hallmark for ATLL pathogenesis. However, the mechanisms by which ATLL cells evade NK-cell-mediated immunity have been poorly understood. Here we show that CD48 expression in ATLL cells determines the sensitivity for NK-cell-mediated cytotoxicity against ATLL cells. We performed unbiased genome-wide clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) screening using two ATLL derived cell lines and discovered CD48 as one of the best enriched genes whose knockout conferred resistance to YT-1 NK cell line mediated cytotoxicity. The ability of CD48-knockout ATLL cells to evade NK cell effector function was confirmed using human primary NK cells with reduced IFNg induction and degranulation. We found that primary ATLL cells had reduced CD48 expression along with disease progression. Furthermore, other subgroups among aggressive peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) also expressed lower levels of CD48 than normal T-cells, suggesting that CD48 is a key molecule in malignant T-cell evasion of NK cell surveillance. Thus, this study demonstrates that CD48 expression is likely critical for malignant T-cell lymphoma cell regulation of NK cell mediated immunity and provides a rationale for future evaluation of CD48 as a molecular biomarker in NK cell-associated immunotherapies.\n\nMutsumi Nishida, Junichi Sugita, Takahito Iwai, Megumi Sato, Yusuke Kudo, Satomi Omotehara, Tatsunori Horie, Ryosuke Sakano, Yuta Hasegawa, Atsushi Yasumoto, Yuko Cho, Takanori Teshima\n\nBone marrow transplantation 57 (8) 1338 - 1340 2022/08\n\nToru Miyajima, Yuta Hasegawa, Daigo Hashimoto, Takanori Teshima\n\nInternational journal of hematology 116 (1) 3 - 4 2022/07\n\nUlrich Jaeger, Constantine S Tam, Peter Borchmann, Joseph P McGuirk, Marianne Johansen, Edmund K Waller, Samantha M Jaglowski, Charalambos Andreadis, Ronan Ronan Foley, Jason R Westin, Isabelle Fleury, P Joy Ho, Stephan Mielke, Takanori Teshima, Gilles Andre Salles, Stephen J Schuster, Fiona C He, Richard T Maziarz, Sebastian A Mayer, Shinichi Makita, Marie José Kersten, Monalisa Ghosh, Nina D Wagner-Johnston, Koji Kato, Paolo Corradini, Hideki Goto, Silvia Colicino, Abhijit Agarwal, Chiari Lobetti Lobetti-Bodoni, Michael R Bishop\n\nBlood advances 6 (16) 4816 - 4820 2022/06/10\n\nKeiichi Nakano, Junichi Sugita, Masanori Seimiya, Keiko Yasuda, Chiaki Watanabe, Takanori Teshima\n\nClinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry 531 261 - 264 2022/06/01\n\nBACKGROUND: IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is an immune-mediated fibroinflammatory disease characterized by high IgE levels; however, the physiological significance of elevated IgE levels in patients with IgG4-RD is unclear. Previously, we reported the formation of IgG4-IgE complex in IgG4-RD patients with elevated IgE levels. In this study, we examined the frequency of this complex formation and its relationship with the clinical features in IgG4-RD patients. METHODS: The IgG4-IgE complex was evaluated in 33 and 17 patients with and without IgG4-RD, respectively. The IgG4-IgE complex was evaluated by performing the immunoadsorption of IgG4 using anti-IgG4 antibody-conjugated matrices. RESULTS: The frequency of IgG4-IgE complex formation in patients with IgG4-RD was significantly higher than that in those without IgG4-RD (21.2% vs. 0%). No significant differences were observed between the groups in terms of clinical characteristics and laboratory data. However, the IgG4-IgE complex-positive group had a significantly higher frequency of pancreatic lesions (85.7% vs. 42.3%) and a significantly lower rate of retroperitoneal fiber/periarterial lesions (0% vs. 38.5%) than the IgG4-IgE complex-negative group. CONCLUSION: The IgG4-IgE complex was found only in patients with IgG4-RD which may provide some clues to the pathogenesis and etiology of IgG4-RD.\n\nAkio Mori, Masahiro Onozawa, Shihori Tsukamoto, Takashi Ishio, Emi Yokoyama, Koh Izumiyama, Makoto Saito, Haruna Muraki, Masanobu Morioka, Takanori Teshima, Takeshi Kondo\n\nBritish journal of haematology 197 (6) 691 - 696 2022/06\n\nData on the response to the COVID-19 vaccine in patients with myeloid malignancy, who are at severe risk in case of infection, have not emerged. In a study of 69 patients with myeloid malignancies, including 46 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and 23 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), anti-spike SARS-CoV-2 antibody titres were measured 3 months after the second mRNA-based vaccination. Seroconversion rates for AML and MDS were 94.7% and 100% respectively, with no significant difference from healthy controls (HCs). Patients with MDS showed a significantly lower antibody titre than that in HCs or AML patients. In AML patients, the antibody titres were comparable to those in HCs when treatment was completed, but lower in patients under maintenance therapy. The response to COVID-19 vaccine appears to be related to disease and treatment status.

However, predictive factors for response to AZA remain largely unknown. To elucidate whether dynamic change in peripheral blood (PB) Wilms' Tumor 1 (WT1) mRNA levels could predict response to AZA, we retrospectively identified 75 treatment-naïve patients with high-risk MDS who received at least 3 cycles of AZA. We classified patients into 4 groups, low-increase (LI), low-stable (LS), high-decrease (HD), and high-stable (HS) based on the dynamic change in PB WT1 mRNA levels within 3 cycles of AZA. Cumulative incidence of overall response after 10 cycles of AZA was significantly higher in LS/HD than in HS/LI (75.5% vs 4.5%, P < 0.001). The median OS for LS/HD was 18.2 months (95% CI, 12.8-28.1 months), whereas it was 11.6 months for HS/LI (95% CI, 6.6-14.1 months; P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that poor-/very poor-IPSS-R cytogenetic risk and HS/LI were independently associated with poor OS (poor-/very poor-IPSS-R cytogenetic risk: HR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.10-4.68, P = 0.03, HS/LI: HR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.21-4.46, P = 0.01).

Recently, CAR (C-reactive-protein/albumin ratio) has been actively reported as a prognostic index reflecting the nutritional and inflammatory status of elderly patients with solid tumors, but the usefulness of this index as a prognostic indicator in transplant-ineligible elderly AML patients has not been investigated. We studied genetic alterations and CARs in 188 newly diagnosed AML patients aged 65 years or older who were treated in a multicenter setting and had treated without HSCT. Both NCCN 2017 risk group, reflecting the genetic component of the tumor, and CAR, reflecting the inflammatory and nutritional status of the patient, successfully stratified the overall survival (OS) of the patients (2-year OS; CAR low vs high, 42.3% vs 17.8%, P < 0.001). Furthermore, in multivariate analysis, NCCN 2017 poor group and high CAR were extracted as independent poor prognostic factors predicting 2-year OS in the current study.
