        "text": "Back in Japan's golden years Boston was a big draw for its top talent in the marathon, but for a long time it was off the list of first-choice marathons as the preoccupation shifted to times. That started changing again in 2017 when 5000 m NR holder Suguru Osako made his debut there with a 2:10:28 for 3rd, following in the footsteps of other Waseda University alum who ran well in Boston including two-time winner Toshihiko Seko and the late Tomoyuki Taniguchi.\n\nOsako was 3rd at October's Paris Olympic marathon trials, putting him in position to be on the Paris team unless someone runs 2:05:50 or better at February's Osaka Marathon or March's Tokyo Marathon. Having run 2:06:13 in Tokyo last year but beaten by two Japanese men who both went under 2:06, there wasn't really any upside to Osako doing Tokyo this time. Osaka seemed like the logical choice, but like he has for most of his life Osako is following his own motivations and opting to return to the 128th Boston Marathon presented by Bank of America. Given the chances of another Japanese man hitting 2:05:50 and the makeup of the Paris Olympic marathon course, it's a good choice.\n\nIn Boston he'll be joined by Kento Otsu, a member of the legendary 2012 Toyo University team that broke the 3:00/km barrier for the full Hakone Ekiden course. After Toyo Otsu was coached by Barcelona Olympics marathon silver medalist Koichi Morishita, under whose guidance he ran his 2:08:15 PB at the 2021 Lake Biwa Mainichi Marathon. Having run the United Airlines NYC Half twice, Boston will be Otsu's U.S. marathon debut.\n\nAlso in Boston is Ryoma Takeuchi, fresh off a 2:08:40 PB for 3rd at December's Hofu Yomiuri Marathon. A training partner of half marathon great Alexander Mutiso at the ND Software corporate team, Takeuchi is running his third Abbott World Marathon Majors, having run 2:12:26 at the 2019 Chicago Marathon and 2:14:35 at the 2020 Tokyo Marathon.\n\n128th Boston Marathon Elite Men's Field\n\nBoston, MA, U.S.A., 15 April 2024\n\ntimes listed are athletes' best in last 3 years\n\nSisay Lemma (Ethiopia) - 2:01:48 (Valencia 2023)\n\nGabriel Geay (Tanzania) - 2:03:00 (Valencia 2022)\n\nJoshua Belet (Kenya) - 2:04:18 (Amsterdam 2023)\n\nRonald Korir (Kenya) - 2:04:22 (Berlin 2023)\n\nCyprian Kotut (Kenya) - 2:04:34 (Amsterdam 2023)\n\nHaftu Teklu (Ethiopia) - 2:04:43 (Berlin 2023)\n\nJohn Korir (Kenya) - 2:05:01 (Chicago 2022)\n\nMohamed Esa (Ethiopia) - 2:05:05 (Amsterdam 2022)\n\nEvans Chebet (Kenya) - 2:05:43 (London 2021)\n\nShura Kitata (Ethiopia) - 2:06:12 (Tokyo 2022)\n\nSuguru Osako (Japan) - 2:06:13 (Tokyo 2023)\n\nFilmon Ande (Eritrea) - 2:06:38 (Barcelona 2021)\n\nZouhair Talbi (Morocco) - 2:06:39 (Houston 2024)\n\nIsaac Mpofu (Zimbabwe) - 2:06:48 (Valencia 2022)\n\nAlbert Korir (Kenya) - 2:06:57 (New York 2023)\n\nSondre Nordstad Moen (Norway) - 2:07:16 (Fukuoka Int'l 2023)\n\nKento Otsu (Japan) - 2:08:15 (Lake Biwa 2021)\n\nRyoma Takeuchi (Japan) - 2:08:40 (Hofu 2023)\n\nSegundo Jami (Ecuador) - 2:09:05 (Valencia 2023)\n\nMatt McDonald (U.S.A.) - 2:09:49 (Chicago 2022)\n\nTristan Woodfine (Canada) - 2:10:39 (Houston 2024)\n\nCJ Albertson (U.S.A.) - 2:10:52 (Grandma's 2022)\n\nChris Thompson (Great Britain) - 2:10:52 (London 2021)\n\nTsegay Tuemay (Eritrea) - 2:11:04 (McKirdy Micro 2023)\n\nEdward Cheserek (Kenya) - 2:11:07 (New York 2023)\n\nNick Hauger (U.S.A.) - 2:12:59 (Sacramento 2021)\n\nWill Nation (U.S.A.) - 2:13:24 (Sacramento 2021)\n\nAlexandru Corneschi (Romania) - 2:13:39 (Berlin 2022)\n\nDavid Nilsson (Sweden) - 2:14:33 (Stockholm 2021)\n\nRobert Miranda (U.S.A.) - 2:14:43 (Sacramento 2023)\n\nPatrick Smyth (U.S.A.) - 2:14:49 (Grandma's 2023)\n\nYemane Haileselassie (Eritrea) - debut - 1:01:34 (Houston Half 2024)\n\nÂ© 2024 Brett Larner, all rights reserved\n\nLabels\n\nAt the July 15 Long Distance Time Trials meet in Nara, Higashi Osaka Keiai H.S. 2nd-year Rin Kubo , 16, added the 800 m national record to her national title two weeks ago and 4x800 m NR on Friday, becoming the first Japanese woman to break 2 minutes with a new NR of 1:59.93. The previous NR of 2:00.45 was set on June 5, 2005 by Miho Sugimori . Kubo cut 0.52 seconds off that time, set almost three years before Kubo was born, and in doing it she achieved one of her major goals, becoming Japan's first woman to break the 2-minute barrier. It also majorly improved her own U18 NR of 2:03.13 set at Nationals two weeks ago, and bettered her 2:01.9 split in the NR-setting 4x800 m three days ago where she went through the first 400 m in 56.8. Translator's note: Kubo's 100 m splits per the stadium announcer: 14-28-43-58-1:13-1:29-1:44-1:59.93 Worldwide, her 1:59.93 is the 2nd-fastest U18 time in the world this year behind the 1:57.86 run by 17-year-old Phoebe Gill of Great Brita\n\nNewly crowned women's 800 m national champion Rin Kubo , 16, anchored one of two 4x800 m teams from Higashi Osaka Keiai H.S. at a time trial meet in Higashi Osaka Friday, setting a new Japanese NR of 8:33.77. The team, which included Rin Kitamura , Runa Asano , Misa Tamura and Kubo, took 8 seconds off the old record, clocking individual splits of 2:07.4 for Kitamura, 2:11.2 for Asano, 2:13.1 for Tamura and a solid 2:01.9 for the 16-year-old Kubo whose official PB for a standard 800 m is 2:03.13. Higashi Osaka Keiai's B-team also broke the old high school NR in 8:55.06. Overseas, three members of Japan's team for the Paris Olympics tuned up at the Monaco Diamond League meet. Women's javelin world champion Haruka Kitaguchi (JAL) ntook the win in style with a 65.21 m season best on her final throw, surpassing the leader since the first round, Australian Mackenzie Little , by 47 cm. After a good comeback run at the Paris Diamond League meet, Shunsuke Izumiya (Sumitom\n\nA 20-year-old man has been arrested on charges of sexually assaulting a female runner along the banks of the Tama River in Ota Ward, Tokyo. \"I've been stuck at home because of the coronavirus, so I wanted to go for a walk and move my body a bit,\" the man told police. Local resident Hirai Muroyama , 20, of no known occupation, was arrested on charges of sexual assault. He is accused of acts including grabbing the breasts of a woman in her 20s at around 10 p.m. on May 31 along the banks of the Tama River. According to police, the woman was taking a break in her run when Muroyama approached her silently from behind and grabbed her breasts before running away. Under police interrogation Muroyama told investigators, \"I've been stuck at home because of the coronavirus, so I wanted to go out for a walk and move my body. I'd had a few drinks and was feeling pretty hype. She was totally my type.\" source article: https://news.tbs.co.jp/newseye/tbs_newsey"
