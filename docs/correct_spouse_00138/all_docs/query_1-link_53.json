        "text": "Results at the 99th Hakone Ekiden on Jan. 2 and 3 this year showed that the high level seen over the last few years hasn't slowed down at all. Eleven university teams cleared 11:00:00 for the complete 10-leg, 217.1 km course, tying last year's record numbers. Before 2020, when ten teams did it, there had never been more than three in a single edition. Winner Komazawa University's time was the 3rd-fastest ever, with runner-up Chuo University running the 5th-fastest ever and 3rd-placer Aoyama Gakuin University the 9th-fastest. Komazawa and Chuo were both in the all-time top ten for both the Day One and Day Two segments, with overall 7th-placer Hosei University the 10th-fastest ever for Day Two.\n\nBoth Komazawa and Chuo went under the 3:00/km barrier for average pace over the entire course, which includes a stage that climbs to 874 m elevation and another that drops back down. At the Jan. 1 New Year Ekiden corporate men's national championships, where teams run 100.0 km in seven legs with only one leg over 20 km, six of the 36 teams in the race couldn't manage 3:00/km average pace.\n\nKomazawa won Hakone in 10:47:11, 2:58.9/km. For 100.0 km that would be 4:58:06. Ten of the 36 New Year Ekiden corporate teams were slower than that. Take out the two mountain stages and Komazawa's slowest remaining performer to give them the same number of people as a New Year Ekiden team and they averaged 2:56.8/km, 4:54:42 for 100 km. That would have put them in 17th out of 36 at the New Year Ekiden even though Komazawa's runners averaged 22.0 km each versus 14.3 km each for the corporate leaguers. Top 10 would have taken 2:55.7/km, the win 2:52.9.\n\nIn individual performances, two legs saw new course records. Vincent Yegon of Tokyo Kokusai University ran a new record of 1:00:00 for the 20.9 km 4th leg, and Yuito Yamamoto of Josai University ran a record 1:10:04 for the uphill 20.8 km 5th leg. Across seven legs a total of 19 athletes ran all-time top ten marks, with only the 1st, 3rd and downhill 6th legs not producing history book-making times.\n\nStandardizing athletes' performances to the 21.0975 km half marathon distance, 67 people ran the equivalent of a sub-1:03 half marathon, 27 went sub-1:02, and 5 sub-1:01. Compared to last year, when there were 65 sub-1:03, 40 sub-1:02 and 13 sub-1:01, front-end numbers were down this year, but that was mostly due to a strategic 1st leg this time versus an aggressive CR-breaking start in 2022. Depth at the sub-1:03 level was up slightly.\n\nStandardized to the half marathon distance, the fastest run at Hakone this year was of course Yegon's 4th leg CR, which was worth a 1:00:34 half marathon. But Chuo's Yamato Yoshii ran the equivalent of 1:00:37 on the longer and hillier 23.1 km 2nd leg, so it's hard to say which was the best performance of the race. Yoshii's 1:00:40 CR on the 21.3 km 1st leg last year translates to 1:00:05 for the half marathon, so it's safe to say he's got a good half marathon in him, maybe Japan's first sub-60. 2nd leg runner-up Kotaro Kondo of AGU ran the equivalent of 1:00:39 and 3rd-placer Ren Tazawa of Komazawa 1:00:48, with Chuo's Shota Nakano running the equivalent of 1:00:59 to win the 21.4 km 3rd leg.\n\nAt the New Year Ekiden the only individual leg over 20 km is the 22.4 km leg, where most of Japan's top marathoners are positioned. This year four athletes ran the equivalent of a sub-1:01 half marathon there. Stage winner Yohei Ikeda from the Kao corporate team ran the equivalent of 1:00:20, surpassing Yegon and Yoshii but on an easier course. CR holder Kyohei Hosoya of Kurosaki Harima and overall winner Honda's Naoki Koyama were next at 1:00:52 and 1:00:53, with 4th-placer Ken Yokote of runner-up team Fujitsu clocking the equivalent of 1:00:57.\n\nThere's no doubt about the quality of the collegiate athletes at the Hakone Ekiden, and the overall level continues to develop. The buildup to next year's 100th edition of the world's biggest race should see even more, especially among teams that didn't make the top ten this year. They will have to line up in October's Yosenkai half marathon qualifier to try to earn one of the remaining spots, and with all the prestige a start at the 100th Hakone will bring to the teams that make it, that won't be easy.\n\nÂ© 2023 Brett Larner, all rights reserved\n\nLabels\n\nAt the July 15 Long Distance Time Trials meet in Nara, Higashi Osaka Keiai H.S. 2nd-year Rin Kubo , 16, added the 800 m national record to her national title two weeks ago and 4x800 m NR on Friday, becoming the first Japanese woman to break 2 minutes with a new NR of 1:59.93. The previous NR of 2:00.45 was set on June 5, 2005 by Miho Sugimori . Kubo cut 0.52 seconds off that time, set almost three years before Kubo was born, and in doing it she achieved one of her major goals, becoming Japan's first woman to break the 2-minute barrier. It also majorly improved her own U18 NR of 2:03.13 set at Nationals two weeks ago, and bettered her 2:01.9 split in the NR-setting 4x800 m three days ago where she went through the first 400 m in 56.8. Translator's note: Kubo's 100 m splits per the stadium announcer: 14-28-43-58-1:13-1:29-1:44-1:59.93 Worldwide, her 1:59.93 is the 2nd-fastest U18 time in the world this year behind the 1:57.86 run by 17-year-old Phoebe Gill of Great Brita\n\nNewly crowned women's 800 m national champion Rin Kubo , 16, anchored one of two 4x800 m teams from Higashi Osaka Keiai H.S. at a time trial meet in Higashi Osaka Friday, setting a new Japanese NR of 8:33.77. The team, which included Rin Kitamura , Runa Asano , Misa Tamura and Kubo, took 8 seconds off the old record, clocking individual splits of 2:07.4 for Kitamura, 2:11.2 for Asano, 2:13.1 for Tamura and a solid 2:01.9 for the 16-year-old Kubo whose official PB for a standard 800 m is 2:03.13. Higashi Osaka Keiai's B-team also broke the old high school NR in 8:55.06. Overseas, three members of Japan's team for the Paris Olympics tuned up at the Monaco Diamond League meet. Women's javelin world champion Haruka Kitaguchi (JAL) ntook the win in style with a 65.21 m season best on her final throw, surpassing the leader since the first round, Australian Mackenzie Little , by 47 cm. After a good comeback run at the Paris Diamond League meet, Shunsuke Izumiya (Sumitom\n\nA 20-year-old man has been arrested on charges of sexually assaulting a female runner along the banks of the Tama River in Ota Ward, Tokyo. \"I've been stuck at home because of the coronavirus, so I wanted to go for a walk and move my body a bit,\" the man told police. Local resident Hirai Muroyama , 20, of no known occupation, was arrested on charges of sexual assault. He is accused of acts including grabbing the breasts of a woman in her 20s at around 10 p.m. on May 31 along the banks of the Tama River. According to police, the woman was taking a break in her run when Muroyama approached her silently from behind and grabbed her breasts before running away. Under police interrogation Muroyama told investigators, \"I've been stuck at home because of the coronavirus, so I wanted to go out for a walk and move my body. I'd had a few drinks and was feeling pretty hype. She was totally my type.\" source article: https://news.tbs.co.jp/newseye/tbs_newsey"
