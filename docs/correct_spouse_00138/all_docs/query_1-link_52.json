        "text": "Thirty Years of Toyama Institute of Glass Art:\n\nForms for the Future\n\nThe Toyama Institute of Glass Art celebrates the thirtieth anniversary of its founding this year.\n\nIn 1991, as a major step for the Toyama Glass City program, which the city has been implementing for thirty-five years, the institute was founded as a center for training glass artists. While works in glass are often categorized as craft, the institute, having launched itself as the Toyama Institute of Glass Art, has focused on art, not craft, from the start. Its goal is art that embodies, to the maximum, the expressive capabilities of glass as a material.\n\nFrom its establishment, the institute has made it a practice to invite instructors from the Czech Republic and the United States, global leaders in glass art, and has provided a high level of technical instruction. Over these thirty years, it has trained 555 graduates and produced many artists active in Japan and abroad.\n\nThe Toyama Glass Art Museum is delighted to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the Toyama Institute of Glass Art’s founding with an exhibition of works by the institute’s faculty members and graduates. The works on display are the artists’ most recent and outstanding works. This exhibition goes beyond tracing the history of the past three decades to showcase the “now” of glass and creative expression, internationally, through works that foreshadow what is yet to come.\n\nVenue:\n\nExhibition Room 1-3(2F, 3F), Gallery 1(5F)\n\nDates:\n\nSaturday, October23,2021ーSunday, January23,2022\n\nHours:\n\nOpening Hours: 9:30 – 18:00 *Latest admission is 30 minutes before closing\n\n(until 20:00 on Fridays and Saturdays)\n\nClosed:\n\nFirst and Third Wednesdays (except November 3, 2021), November 10, 2021, December 29, 2021– January 1, 2022\n\nOrganizer:\n\nToyama City\n\nArtists\n\nASANO Eriko, ABIRU Shogo, IKEDA Jusho, ITO Machiko, INOUE Tsuyoshi, INOYA Makiko, IMAI Marie, ENAMI Fujiko, ENOMOTO Kaho, KISHIMOTO Kohei, KUSANAGI Seiko, Vladimir KLEIN, Brain Patrick CORR, KOJIMA Yukako, KOSOGAWA Runa, GOTO Yohei, KONISHI Ushio, KOBAYASHI Chisa, KOBAYASHI Toshikazu, KOMURE Takahito, SASAKI Masahiro, Saburo, SHIBUYA Ryoji, Jaroslav SARA, Boyd SUGIKI, TAKEOKA Kensuke, Scott DARLINGTON, CHIMURA Yohei, JANG Kyung Nam, TSUKADA Midori, TSUKURIMICHI Ryoko, TSUMORI Hidenori, TOGASHI Yoko, TOKORO Shiho, NAKAGAMI Makiko, NAKAMURA Toshiyasu, NARITA Satoko, NISHI KAWA Makoto, NISHIGAKI Satoshi, NISHINAKA Yukito, NISHIYAMA Yuki, NODA Yuichi, HIROSE Emi, FUKUNISHI Takeshi, FUJITA Kyohei, HOKI Shieri, HONGO Jin, MATSUO Itcho, MATSUO Rina, MATSUFUJI Koichi, Pavel MRKUS, YASUDA Taizo, YAMAMOTO Akane, YOSHIMURA Keiko, YONEMOTO Masaaki, Václav ŘEZÁČ, WATANABE Chiemi, Jack L.
