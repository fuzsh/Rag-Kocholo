Nobuhide Kubo, Hirohumi Kawanaka, Shoji Hiroshige, Hirotada Tajiri, Akinori Egashira, Hideya Takeuchi, Toshifumi Matsumoto, Eiji Oki, Tokujiro Yano, Sarcopenia discriminates poor prognosis in elderly patients following emergency surgery for perforation panperitonitis., Annals of gastroenterological surgery, 10.1002/ags3.12281, 3, 6, 630-637, 2019.11, AIM: Sarcopenia has been reported as a prognostic predictor in various conditions; however, it has not been examined in patients with perforation panperitonitis. METHODS: A total of 103 consecutive patients with perforation panperitonitis who underwent emergency surgery from 2008 to 2016 were retrospectively evaluated. Skeletal muscle index (SMI) was measured as the cross-sectional area (cm2) of skeletal muscle in the L3 region on computed tomography images normalized for height (cm2/m2). Sarcopenia was defined as an SMI of ≤43.75 and ≤41.10 cm2/m2 in men and women, respectively. The impact of sarcopenia on postoperative outcomes was investigated. RESULTS: Sarcopenia was present in 50 (48.5%) patients. Severe complications (Clavien-Dindo grade ≥IIIb) and in-hospital mortality were more frequently observed in patients with than without sarcopenia (28.0% vs 9.4%, P = .015) (20.0% vs 5.7%, P = .029) respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that age, sarcopenia, and renal dysfunction were independent risk factors for severe complications and in-hospital mortality. The optimal cut-off levels of age and SMI for predicting these were ≥79 years and SMI 2.

However, the optimal analysis method for each drug is still under debate. We conducted a pooled analysis using data from six phase II studies to evaluate four analysis methods in colorectal cancers (CRCs): morphological responses (MRs), early tumor shrinkage (ETS), depth of response (DpR), and response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) ver.1.1. METHODS: We included 249 patients in this analysis. Pretreatments and findings of subsequent CT imaging were analyzed based on the MR, ETS, DpR, and RECIST ver.1.1. Differences in overall survival (OS) between the responders and non-responders according to each method were evaluated using survival analysis. RESULTS: The responders had significantly better hazard ratios (HRs) for OS, in terms of DpR (≥ median), ETS, objective response rate (ORR) [complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)], and disease control rate [CR + PR + stable disease (SD)]. Patients with right-sided colon cancers showed better HRs for DpR, but not for ETS and ORR. Contrastingly, patients with left-sided CRCs had better HRs for ETS, DpR, and ORR. MR was not associated with outcomes in this study, even in cases where bevacizumab was used. In patients with liver metastasis, ETS, DpR, and ORR showed better HRs, but not in those with lung metastasis. CONCLUSION: Early tumor shrinkage and DpR might be predictive markers only in left-sided CRCs with liver metastasis. Each imaging analysis has a different value based on the primary and metastatic sites.. 3.

However, no prospective study has compared the outcomes of chemotherapy with bevacizumab (BEV) versus cetuximab (CET). METHODS: The ATOM study is the first randomised trial comparing BEV and CET for initially unresectable CRLM. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive mFOLFOX6 plus either BEV or CET. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: Between May 2013 and April 2016, 122 patients were enrolled. Median PFS was 11.5 months (95% CI 9.2-13.3 months) in the BEV group and 14.8 months (95% CI 9.7-17.3 months) in the CET group (hazard ratio 0.803; P = 0.33). Patients with a smaller-number but larger-sized metastases did better in the CET group. In the BEV and CET groups, the response rates were 68.4% and 84.7% and the resection rates were 56.1% and 49.2%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Although CET achieved a better response rate than BEV for patients with a small number of large liver metastases, both biologics had similar efficacy regarding liver resection and acceptable safety profiles. To achieve optimal PFS, biologics should be selected in accordance with patient conditions. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT01836653), and UMIN Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN-CTR number UMIN000010209).. 4.

We conducted the present study to evaluate the impact of contrast enhancement based on layer depth on WC of gastric cancer and to correlate them with pathological findings. METHODS: The subjects of this retrospective study consisted of 36 patients with advanced gastric cancer (22 men, 14 women; age range, 39-90 years; median, 67 years) who underwent contrast-enhanced CT before surgery. WC images of arterial phase were divided into first and second layer. Two radiologists in consensus evaluated the contrast enhancement of WC images for each layer and correlated with pathologic factors. RESULTS: Twenty-six (72%) of the gastric cancers showed a well-enhanced lesion in the first layer at the arterial phase on WC images, and 18 (50%) showed a well-enhanced lesion in the second layer. The study of second layers showed that the well-enhanced group had significantly more cases of differentiated type histology and intermediate stroma than the normally to poorly enhanced group (p = 0.008 and 0.0026). CONCLUSION: The contrast enhancement on WC of gastric cancer showed a significant relationship with pathological factors based on layer depth.. 5.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with KRAS exon 2 wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer after failure of fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan were randomized to receive sequential treatment with regorafenib followed by cetuximab ± irinotecan (R-C arm), or the reverse sequence [cetuximab ± irinotecan followed by regorafenib (C-R arm)]. The primary end point was overall survival (OS). Key secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS) with initial treatment (PFS1), PFS with second treatment (PFS2), safety, and quality of life. Exploratory end points included serial biomarker analyses, including oncogenic alterations from circulating tumor DNA or multiple serum or plasma proteins. RESULTS: One-hundred one patients were randomized and eligible for efficacy analysis. Sequential treatment was successful in 86% patients in both arms. Median OS for R-C and C-R was 17.4 and 11.6 months, respectively (P = 0.0293), with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.61 for OS [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39-0.96]. The HR for PFS1 (regorafenib in R-C versus cetuximab in C-R) was 0.97 (95% CI 0.61-1.54), and PFS2 (C in R-C versus R in C-R) was 0.29 (95% CI 0.17-0.50). No unexpected safety signals were observed. The quality of life scores during the entire treatment period was not significantly different between the two arms. Circulating biomarker analyses showed emerging oncogenic alterations in RAS, BRAF, EGFR, HER2, and MET, which were more commonly detected after cetuximab than after regorafenib. CONCLUSIONS: The therapeutic sequence of regorafenib followed by cetuximab suggests a longer OS than the current standard sequence.. 6.

The objective of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of the CRP/Alb ratio in patients who underwent surgery for adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction (AEG) and upper gastric cancer (UGC). METHODS: Data for 144 patients who underwent surgery for AEG and UGC were reviewed. The CRP/Alb ratio, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-lymphocyte ratio, Glasgow Prognostic Score, and controlling nutritional status score were calculated, and the relationship between these biomarkers and postoperative prognosis was analyzed. RESULTS: The optimal cutoff value of the CRP/Alb ratio was determined to be 0.1. According to the cutoff value of CRP/Alb ratio, patients were divided into two groups (CRP/Alb 7.

We clarify the mechanisms underlying laser-mediated tissue fusion using a novel model. Microscopic examinations of morphological changes within the adventitia of a bovine carotid artery and a collagen sheet prepared from bovine dermis showed collagen fibril bundle loosening and collagen fibre swelling following heating at 46 °C. An incised bovine carotid artery covered with a collagen sheet to which pressure and laser heat of 40 °C-52 °C were applied created a structure that was pressure resistant to >300 mmHg. Microscopic analyses of the irradiation site showed collagen fibril interdigitation. Hence, low-temperature laser-mediated tissue fusion causes collagen fibril bundles to loosen and swell, and crimping causes the fibres to intertwine. As the temperature declines, the loosened and swollen fibrils and fibres tighten, and collagen fibre interdigitation is completed. This technology could be applied to fuse tissues during surgery.. 8.

Previous studies demonstrated the usefulness of APT imaging to predict tumor malignancy. We determined whether APT imaging can predict the tumor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). METHODS: Seventeen patients with LARC who underwent a pretherapeutic magnetic resonance examination including APT imaging and NAC (at least two courses) were enrolled. The APT-weighted imaging (WI) signal intensity (SI) (%) was defined as magnetization transfer ratio asymmetry (MTRasym ) at the offset of 3.5 ppm. Each tumor was histologically evaluated for the degree of degeneration and necrosis and then classified as one of five histological Grades (0, none; 1a, less than 1/3; 1b, 1/3 to 2/3; 2, more than 2/3; 3, all). We compared the mean APTWI SIs of the tumors between the Grade 0/1a/1b (low-response group) and Grade 2/3 (high-response group) by Student's t-test. We used receiver operating characteristics curves to determine the diagnostic performance of the APTWI SI for predicting the tumor response. RESULTS: The mean APTWI SI of the low-response group (n = 12; 3.05 ± 1.61%) was significantly higher than that of the high-response group (n = 5; 1.14 ± 1.13%) (P = 0.029). The area under the curve for predicting the tumor response using the APTWI SI was 0.87. When ≥2.75% was used as an indicator of low-response status, 75% sensitivity and 100% specificity of the APTWI SI were obtained. CONCLUSION: Pretherapeutic APT imaging can predict the tumor response to NAC in patients with LARC.. 9.

We herein report a case of the amelanotic type of PMME. CASE PRESENTATION: An 86-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with symptoms of dysphagia. An endoscopic examination and constructed radiography revealed an elevated and semipedunculated lesion with an ulcer in the lower thoracic esophagus accompanied by another submucosal lesion of the esophagus. She was diagnosed with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma by a preoperative endoscopic biopsy. We performed thoracoscopy- and laparoscopy-assisted subtotal esophagectomy with lymphadenectomy. Based on the surgical specimens, although there were no melanocytes, we made a diagnosis of a malignant melanoma immunohistochemically; the tumor cells were positive for S-100 protein and HMB45 focally and partially for Melan-A. CONCLUSION: We experienced a case of primary amelanotic malignant melanoma, and the patient has remained disease-free for 1 year since the surgery. Since the diagnosis of amelanotic type of PMME is difficult, it should be made by the combination of a morphological examination, pathological examination, and immunohistochemistry.. 10.

We report the analysis of the Japanese subpopulation from ATTRACTION-2 that evaluated nivolumab versus placebo in unresectable advanced or recurrent G/GEJ cancer after ≥ 2 chemotherapy regimens. METHODS: Data from the Japanese subpopulation in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial were analyzed (data cutoff, February 25, 2017). Primary endpoint was overall survival (OS); secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR). RESULTS: Among the overall study population of 493 patients, 226 (nivolumab 152; placebo 74) were enrolled from 28 sites in Japan. In the Japanese subset, median OS was longer with nivolumab versus placebo (5.4 months, 95% CI 4.6-7.4 versus 3.6 months, 95% CI 2.8-5.0). The risk of death was lower in the nivolumab versus placebo group (hazard ratio 0.58, 95% CI 0.42-0.78; p = 0.0002). Incidences of serious adverse events were 23% (35/152) and 25% (18/72) in the nivolumab and placebo groups, respectively. In the Japanese ITT population, 22% of nivolumab-treated and 28% of placebo-treated patients received prior ramucirumab treatment. Overall, clinical activity of nivolumab was observed regardless of prior ramucirumab use. In the nivolumab group, ORR and PFS were numerically higher in patients with prior ramucirumab use than in those without. CONCLUSIONS: In the Japanese subpopulation, patients receiving nivolumab had longer OS, similar to the overall population, with a manageable safety profile. The interaction between nivolumab and ramucirumab will be clarified in ongoing clinical trials.. 11.

The objective of present study was to assess whether postoperative development of sarcopenia could predict a poor prognosis in patients with adenocarcinoma of esophagogastric junction, (AEG) and upper gastric cancer (UGC). METHODS: Patients with AEG and UGC who were judged as non-sarcopenic before surgery were reassessed the presence of postoperative development of sarcopenia 6 months after surgery. Patients were divided into the development group or non-development group, and clinicopathological factors and prognosis between these two groups were analyzed. RESULTS: The 5-year overall survival rates were significantly poorer in the development group than non-development group (68.0% vs. 92.6%, P = 0.0118). Multivariate analyses showed that postoperative development of sarcopenia was an independent prognostic factor for poor overall survival (P = 0.0237). CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative development of sarcopenia was associated with a poor prognosis in patients with AEG and UGC.. 12. Hideaki Bando, Yoshinori Kagawa, Takeshi Kato, Kiwamu Akagi, Tadamichi Denda, Tomohiro Nishina, Yoshito Komatsu, Eiji Oki, Toshihiro Kudo, Hiroshi Kumamoto, Takeharu Yamanaka, Takayuki Yoshino, A multicentre, prospective study of plasma circulating tumour DNA test for detecting RAS mutation in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer., British journal of cancer, 10.1038/s41416-019-0457-y, 120, 10, 982-986, 2019.05, BACKGROUND: OncoBEAMTM RAS CRC kit using BEAMing technology is a circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) test for detecting plasma RAS mutational status in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). We conducted a multicentre, prospective study to investigate the concordance of the RAS mutational status between plasma ctDNA and tumour tissue DNA. METHODS: mCRC patients without prior anti-EGFR antibodies or regorafenib treatment were enroled. Plasma- and tissue-based RAS mutational status were determined by BEAMing, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 280 patients from eight institutions were eligible. The overall agreement between plasma- and tissue-based analyses was 86.4%, with a positive percent agreement of 82.1% and negative percent agreement of 90.4%. From logistic regression analysis, lung metastasis alone indicated the most significant factor associated with discordance. The agreement between plasma- and tissue-based analyses was 64.5% in patients with lung metastasis alone (n = 31) indicating lower amount of ctDNA. Among the cases with lung metastasis alone, all plasma- and tissue-based analyses were perfectly concordant in cases with ≥20 mm of maximum lesion diameter or ≥10 lesions. CONCLUSION: The clinical validity of OncoBEAMTM RAS CRC kit was confirmed. Careful attention should be paid for mCRC patients with lung metastases alone having fewer metastases or smaller diameter lesions.. 13.

We aimed to determine whether a decrease in skeletal muscle mass after surgical resection can predict long-term outcomes in patients with adenocarcinoma of upper stomach (AUS) and esophagogastric junction (AEGJ). METHODS: We reviewed 146 patients who underwent curative surgery for AUS and AEGJ. We assessed the skeletal muscle index pre- and post-surgery and 6 months postoperatively. The rate of decrease in skeletal muscle index (SMI) was calculated and its relationship with clinicopathological factors and prognosis was analyzed. RESULTS: Among the 146 patients studied, 115 underwent re-assessment of SMI 6 months postoperatively. The mean decrease in SMI was more prominent in patients with recurrence than in those without recurrence (19.0 ± 2.3 vs. 7.4 ± 0.9%, respectively, P 19% decrease in SMI showed significantly lower 5-year overall survival and recurrence-free rates than those with a 14.

In 2011, our institution introduced thoracoscopic esophagectomy in the left hemi-prone position and laparoscopic reconstruction with a gastric tube in patients undergoing TPLE. Herein, we describe the use of this operative method in 26 patients, focusing on the technical aspects of the surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2011 to December 2018, 26 patients underwent minimally invasive TPLE with gastric tube reconstruction in our institute. The thoracoscopic procedure was performed with the patient in the semi-prone position. The patient was then moved to the supine position, and the laparoscopic procedure and pharyngolaryngectomy were started simultaneously. After pharyngolaryngectomy, microvascular anastomoses or free jejunal flap interposition were performed at the site of the gastric tube reconstruction. The data from these 26 patients were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The median age was 66 years, and 3.8% of the patients were female. The Union for International Cancer Control stages of esophageal cancer were 0 (n = 2), I (n = 4), II (n = 7), III (n = 8), and IV (n = 5). Eight patients had concomitant esophageal cancer and head and neck cancer. Reconstruction with only a narrow gastric tube was used in 16 patients, while free jejunal flap interposition was used in 10 patients. The surgical procedures resulted in minimal complications. Postoperative complications of Clavien-Dindo grade ≥1 included anastomotic leakage in two patients and pneumonia in one. CONCLUSION: Thoracoscopic esophagectomy in the left hemi-prone position and laparoscopic reconstruction with a gastric tube in patients undergoing TPLE was safe and effective. The complications were improved via the development of various procedures. Further improvement is necessary before this thoracoscopic approach is established as a standard procedure for TPLE.. 15.

Expression of the colon cancer-associated transcript 2 gene (CCAT2), which encodes a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), associates with CIN, but little is known about how CCAT2 lncRNA regulates this cancer enabling characteristic. METHODS: We performed cytogenetic analysis of colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines (HCT116, KM12C/SM, and HT29) overexpressing CCAT2 and colon organoids from C57BL/6N mice with the CCAT2 transgene and without (controls). CRC cells were also analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy, γ-H2AX, and senescence assays. CCAT2 transgene and control mice were given azoxymethane and dextran sulfate sodium to induce colon tumors. We performed gene expression array and mass spectrometry to detect downstream targets of CCAT2 lncRNA. We characterized interactions between CCAT2 with downstream proteins using MS2 pull-down, RNA immunoprecipitation, and selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension analyses. Downstream proteins were overexpressed in CRC cells and analyzed for CIN. Gene expression levels were measured in CRC and non-tumor tissues from 5 cohorts, comprising more than 900 patients. RESULTS: High expression of CCAT2 induced CIN in CRC cell lines and increased resistance to 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin. Mice that expressed the CCAT2 transgene developed chromosome abnormalities, and colon organoids derived from crypt cells of these mice had a higher percentage of chromosome abnormalities compared with organoids from control mice. The transgenic mice given azoxymethane and dextran sulfate sodium developed more and larger colon polyps than control mice given these agents. Microarray analysis and mass spectrometry indicated that expression of CCAT2 increased expression of genes involved in ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis. CCAT2 lncRNA interacted directly with and stabilized BOP1 ribosomal biogenesis factor (BOP1). CCAT2 also increased expression of MYC, which activated expression of BOP1. Overexpression of BOP1 in CRC cell lines resulted in chromosomal missegregation errors, and increased colony formation, and invasiveness, whereas BOP1 knockdown reduced viability. BOP1 promoted CIN by increasing the active form of aurora kinase B, which regulates chromosomal segregation. BOP1 was overexpressed in polyp tissues from CCAT2 transgenic mice compared with healthy tissue. CCAT2 lncRNA and BOP1 mRNA or protein were all increased in microsatellite stable tumors (characterized by CIN), but not in tumors with microsatellite instability compared with nontumor tissues. Increased levels of CCAT2 lncRNA and BOP1 mRNA correlated with each other and with shorter survival times of patients. CONCLUSIONS: We found that overexpression of CCAT2 in colon cells promotes CIN and carcinogenesis by stabilizing and inducing expression of BOP1 an activator of aurora kinase B. Strategies to target this pathway might be developed for treatment of patients with microsatellite stable colorectal tumors.. 16.

The most frequent MSI in solid-type poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (PDA) has been reported, but the SWI/SNF complex status in solid-type PDA is still largely unknown. We retrospectively analyzed 54 cases of solid-type PDA for the expressions of mismatch repair (MMR) proteins (MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6), SWI/SNF complex subunits (ARID1A, INI1, BRG1, BRM, BAF155, and BAF170) and EBER, and mutations in KRAS and BRAF. We analyzed 40 cases of another histological type of gastric cancer as a control group. The solid-type PDAs showed coexisting glandular components (76%), MMR deficiency (39%), and complete/partial loss of ARID1A (31%/7%), INI1 (4%/4%), BRG1 (48%/30%), BRM (33%/33%), BAF155 (13%/41%), and BAF170 (6%/2%), EBER positivity (4%), KRAS mutation (2%), and BRAF mutation (2%). Compared to the control group, MMR deficiency and losses of ARID1A, BRG1, BRM, and BAF155 were significantly frequent in solid-type PDAs. Mismatch repair deficiency was associated with the losses of ARID1A, BRG1, and BAF155 in solid-type PDAs. In the MMR-deficient group, solid components showed significantly more frequent losses of ARID1A, BRG1, BRM, and BAF155 compared to glandular components (P = .0268, P = .0181, P = .0224, and P = .0071, respectively). In the MMR-proficient group, solid components showed significantly more frequent loss of BRG1 compared to glandular components (P = .012). In conclusion, solid-type PDAs showed frequent losses of MMR proteins and the SWI/SNF complex. We suggest that loss of the SWI/SNF complex could induce a morphological shift from differentiated-type adenocarcinoma to solid-type PDA.. 17.

The present study involved assessing the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of aflibercept plus 5-fluorouracil/levofolinate/irinotecan (FOLFIRI) as a second-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) in Japanese patients. Aflibercept (4 mg/kg) plus FOLFIRI was administered every 2 weeks in 62 patients with mCRC until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient withdrawal. Tumors were imaged every 6 weeks. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR); secondary endpoints were progression-free survival, overall survival, safety, and pharmacokinetics of aflibercept, irinotecan and 5-fluorouracil. A total of 60 patients were evaluated for ORR; 50 had received prior bevacizumab. The ORR was 8.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3%-15.3%), and the disease control rate (DCR) was 80.0% (69.9%-90.1%). The median progression-free survival was 5.42 months (4.14-6.70 months) and the median overall survival was 15.59 months (11.20-19.81 months). No treatment-related deaths were observed, and no significant drug-drug interactions were found. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were neutropenia and decreased appetite. Free aflibercept had a mean maximum concentration (coefficient of variation) of 73.2 μg/mL (15%), clearance of 0.805 L/d (22%) and volume of distribution of 6.2 L (18%); aflibercept bound with vascular endothelial growth factor had a clearance of 0.162 L/d (9%) (N = 62). Aflibercept did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan or 5-fluorouracil: The clearance was 11.1 L/h/m2 (28%) for irinotecan and, at steady state, 72.6 L/h/m2 (56%) for 5-fluorouracil (N = 10). Adding aflibercept to FOLFIRI was shown to be beneficial and well-tolerated in Japanese patients with mCRC. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01882868.. 18.

This study aimed to confirm that postoperative skeletal muscle decrease influences long-term patient outcomes. METHODS: Data were collected from 218 patients who underwent curative esophagectomy for esophageal cancer whose data were available before and 6 months after surgery. The skeletal muscle index (SMI) was measured at the level of the L3 vertebrae, and the postoperative change in the SMI compared with preoperative values was calculated as the delta SMI. RESULTS: The mean SMI value was - 11.64%, and the median delta SMI value was - 11.88%. The first and third quartiles were defined as cutoffs, and 218 patients were classified as the mild-loss group (54 patients), moderate-loss group (110 patients), and severe-loss group (54 patients). The patients with a more severely reduced SMI had a worse prognosis (5-year overall survival rates: mild loss, 66.6%; moderate loss, 58.8%; and severe loss, 48.5%; p = 0.0314). This correlation between reduced SMI and prognosis also was observed for the patients with preoperative sarcopenia (p 19.

There are limited data available regarding this so-called remnant PC. The aim of this retrospective study was to clarify the clinical features and establish a treatment strategy for remnant PC. METHODS: A multicenter retrospective study with the Kyushu Study Group of Clinical Cancer was carried out. Clinical data from 50 patients who developed remnant PC were analyzed. RAS mutation analysis of the initial tumor and of remnant PC was performed in 17 cases. RESULTS: The initial pancreatic resections were performed for 37 invasive ductal carcinomas, and for 13 other tumors. Thirty-seven patients underwent a second pancreatectomy for remnant PC (resected group), while thirteen patients were not operated (unresected group). The median overall survival times were 42.2 months in the resected group and 12.3 months in the unresected group (HR 0.374; 95% CI 0.17-0.83). In RAS mutation analysis, 14 cases had at least 1 missense variant of KRAS, HRAS, or NRAS in the initial pancreatic tumor and/or remnant PC. The same missense variants between the initial tumor and remnant PC were discovered only in KRAS of one patient, and in HRAS of one patient. No case had completely consistent missense variants between the initial tumor and remnant PC. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that repeated pancreatectomy for remnant PC can prolong patient survival, and RAS mutation analysis indicated that many remnant PCs are developed from metachronous multifocal origins.. 20. Qingjiang Hu, Hirofumi Hasuda, Kenji Ueki, Akihiro Tsuchimoto, Yoko Zaitsu, Yasuo Tsuda, Yuichi Hisamatsu, Yuichiro Nakashima, Koji Ando, Yasue Kimura, Eiji Oki, Masaki Mori, Reintroduction of nivolumab in a patient with gastric cancer after improvement of nivolumab-induced acute interstitial nephritis: a case report., International cancer conference journal, 10.1007/s13691-020-00418-2, 9, 3, 127-132, 2020.07, Nivolumab, an anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) antibody, has attracted increasing attention as a new treatment modality for gastric cancer. Herein, a case of acute kidney injury in a 66-year-old man with gastric cancer treated with nivolumab is presented. Kidney biopsy revealed severe acute interstitial nephritis and mild immunoglobulin A nephropathy. The cause of acute kidney injury was considered as acute interstitial nephritis because the main site of the lesion was the tubulointerstitium. Cessation of nivolumab and oral prednisolone administration rapidly improved the patient's renal function. Nivolumab was then restarted without worsening of renal function. To the best of the authors knowledge, this is the first case in which reintroduction of nivolumab was successfully performed in a patient with gastric cancer. Further, the relevant literature was reviewed on nivolumab-induced acute interstitial nephritis.. 21. Shinichi Tsuruta, Yoshihiro Ohishi, Minako Fujiwara, Eikichi Ihara, Yoshihiro Ogawa, Eiji Oki, Masafumi Nakamura, Yoshinao Oda, Gastric hepatoid adenocarcinomas are a genetically heterogenous group; most tumors show chromosomal instability, but MSI tumors do exist., Human pathology, 10.1016/j.humpath.2019.03.006, 88, 27-38, 2019.06, The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network classified gastric adenocarcinoma into four molecular subtypes: (1) Epstein-Barr virus-positive (EBV), (2) microsatellite-instable (MSI), (3) chromosomal instable (CIN), and (4) genomically stable (GS). The molecular subtypes of gastric hepatoid adenocarcinomas are still largely unknown. We analyzed 52 hepatoid adenocarcinomas for the expression of surrogate markers of molecular subtypes (MLH1, p53, and EBER in situ hybridization) and some biomarkers (p21, p16, Rb, cyclin D1, cyclin E, β-catenin, Bcl-2, IMP3, ARID1A and HER2), and mutations of TP53, CTNNB1, KRAS, and BRAF. We analyzed 36 solid-type poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas as a control group. Hepatoid adenocarcinomas were categorized as follows: EBV group (EBER-positive), no cases (0%); MSI group (MLH1 loss), three cases (6%); \"CIN or GS\" (CIN/GS) group (EBER-negative, MLH1 retained), 49 cases (94%). In the CIN/GS group, most of the tumors (59%) had either p53 overexpression or TP53 mutation and a coexisting tubular intestinal-type adenocarcinoma component (90%), suggesting that most hepatoid adenocarcinomas should be categorized as a true CIN group. Hepatoid adenocarcinomas showed relatively frequent expressions of HER2 (score 3+/2+: 21%/19%). Hepatoid adenocarcinomas showed shorter survival, more frequent overexpressions of p16 (67%) and IMP3 (98%) than the control group. None of hepatoid adenocarcinomas had KRAS or CTNNB1 mutations except for one case each, and no hepatoid adenocarcinomas had BRAF mutation. In conclusion, gastric hepatoid adenocarcinomas are a genetically heterogenous group. Most hepatoid adenocarcinomas are \"CIN,\" but a small number of hepatoid adenocarcinomas with MSI do exist. Hepatoid adenocarcinomas are characterized by overexpressions of p16 and IMP3.. 22.

AXEPT, an Asian phase III study, showed that modified CAPIRI+BEV [capecitabine (CAP: 1600 mg/m2), irinotecan (IRI: 200 mg/m2), and BEV (7.5 mg/m2)] was non-inferior to FOLFIRI+BEV as a second-line therapy for mCRC patients and was associated with a lower incidence of hematologic toxicities. Thus, a reduced dose of the CAP and IRI regimen in combination with oxaliplatin (OX) and BEV (CAPOXIRI+BEV) may be more feasible than FOLFOXIRI+BEV, without compromising efficacy. METHODS: QUATTRO-II is an open-label, multicenter, randomized phase II study. In Step 1, the recommended doses of OX and IRI will be investigated as a safety lead-in. In Step 2, patients will be randomized to the recommended dose of either CAPOXIRI+BEV or FOLFOXIRI+BEV. Induction triplet chemotherapy plus BEV treatments will be administered for up to 4 months followed by fluoropyrimidine plus BEV maintenance. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS). The similarity in PFS between the two arms will be evaluated by observing whether the point estimate of hazard ratio (HR) for PFS falls between 0.80 and 1.25. Ensuring a 70% probability that the observed HR will be \"0.8 23.

This ancillary exploratory analysis of data in Japanese people was aimed at exploring the relationship between a set of potential prognostic biomarkers and efficacy endpoints following aflibercept plus FOLFIRI therapy. Sixty-two patients with metastatic colorectal cancer received aflibercept (4 mg/kg) plus FOLFIRI every 2 weeks. Seventy-eight potential protein biomarkers were chosen for analysis based on their roles in angiogenesis, tumor progression, and tumor-stroma interaction. Plasma levels of biomarkers at baseline and at pre-dose 3 (day 1 of treatment cycle 3) were measured in all patients by ELISA. Relationships between these levels and efficacy endpoints were assessed.

However, there are no clear recommendations for second-line therapy after FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab combination. Here, we describe our planning for the EFFORT study to investigate whether FOLFIRI plus aflibercept has efficacy following FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab for mCRC. METHODS: EFFORT is an open-label, multicenter, single arm phase II study to evaluate whether a FOLFIRI plus aflibercept has efficacy following FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab for mCRC. Patients with unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer who received FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab as a first-line therapy will receive aflibercept and FOLFIRI (aflibercept 4 mg/kg, irinotecan 150 mg/m2 IV over 90 min, with levofolinate 200 mg/m2 IV over 2 h, followed by fluorouracil 400 mg/m2 bolus and fluorouracil 2400 mg/m2 continuous infusion over 46 h) every 2 weeks on day 1 of each cycle. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS). To achieve 80% power to show a significant response benefit with a one-sided alpha level of 0.10, assuming a threshold progression-free survival of 3 months and an expected value of at least 5.4 months, we estimated that 32 patients are necessary. Secondary endpoints include overall survival, overall response rate, safety, and exploratory biomarker analysis for differentiating anti-VEGF drug in 2nd-line chemotherapy for unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer. DISCUSSION: This is the first study to investigate whether FOLFIRI plus aflibercept has efficacy following FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab for unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer. Switching to a different type of anti-VEGF drug in second-line therapy after FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab appears to be an attractive treatment strategy when considering survival benefit. It is expected that this phase II study will prove the efficacy of this strategy and that a biomarker for drug selection will be discovered.

In the field of gastroenterology, there is a strong demand for devices that can apply this technique to surgical navigation. We aimed to introduce our novel multispectral device capable of intraoperatively performing quantitative imaging of the oxygen (O2) saturation and Hb amount of tissues noninvasively and in real time, and to examine its application for deciding the appropriate anastomosis point after subtotal or total esophagectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 39 patients with esophageal cancer were studied. Tissue O2 saturation and Hb amount of the gastric tube just before esophagogastric anastomosis were evaluated using a multispectral tissue quantitative imaging device. The anastomosis point was decided depending on the quantitative values and patterns of both the tissue O2 saturation and Hb amount. RESULTS: The device can instantaneously and noninvasively quantify and visualize the tissue O2 saturation and Hb amount using reflected light. The tissue Hb status could be classified into the following four types: good circulation type, congestion type, ischemia type, and mixed type of congestion and ischemia. Postoperative anastomotic failure occurred in 2 cases, and both were mixed cases. CONCLUSIONS: The method of quantitatively imaging the tissue O2 saturation and Hb level in real time and noninvasively using a multispectral device allows instantaneous determination of the anastomosis and related organ conditions, thereby contributing to determining the appropriate treatment direction.. 26.

This study aimed to develop a prognostic scoring system for evaluating the overall survival (OS) benefit. METHODS: Patients included in the REGOTAS study, which comprised 489 patients (regorafenib group: 199; FTD/TPI group: 290 patients), were evaluated. OS was analyzed using multivariate Cox proportional model. The prognostic score was calculated using the worst four individual factors weighted by hazard ratio, and the total scores were categorized as low-, moderate-, and high-OS benefit. RESULTS: The worst four factors in the regorafenib group were AST > 40 IU/dL (point, + 3), CRP ≥ 1.0 mg/dL (+ 2), number of metastatic organ site ≥ 3 (+ 2), and duration from initiation of 1st-line chemotherapy 37.0 U/mL (+ 2), and ECOG PS ≥ 1 (+ 2) in the FTD/TPI group. These corresponded to a total prognostic score of > 5, 2-4, and 0 points in the regorafenib group and 8, 2-6, and 0 points in the FTD/TPI group. The median OS in the low, moderate, and high OS benefit group was 3.3 (95% CI 3.0-3.7), 8.1 (95% CI 6.4-9.7), and 12.6 months (95% CI 10.6-14.6) in the regorafenib group and 2.8 (95% CI 2.0-3.5), 7.5 (95% CI 6.6-8.3), and 15.4 months (95% CI 9.7-21.2) in the FTD/TPI group. CONCLUSION: These prognostic scores are useful for identifying patients with mCRC who will obtain survival benefits from these drugs.. 27.

OBJECTIVE: To assess disease-free survival (DFS) and long-lasting PSN in patients treated with 3 vs 6 months of adjuvant oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An open-label, multicenter, phase 3 randomized clinical trial of 1313 Asian patients with stage III colon cancer was conducted investigating the noninferiority of 3 vs 6 months of adjuvant oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. From August 1, 2012, to June 30, 2014, participants were randomized to the 2 treatment groups. Data were analyzed from July 2017 to June 2018. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to receive 3 or 6 months of adjuvant chemotherapy. The choice of chemotherapy regimen, with the drugs modified fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX6) or capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (CAPOX), was at the discretion of the treating physician. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was DFS. Secondary end points included the evaluation of PSN for up to 3 years and overall survival. RESULTS: Of the 1313 patients (651 were women and mean age was 66 [range, 28-85] years) enrolled and randomized, 22 were not treated because 10 were unable to begin treatment within 2 weeks of enrollment, 7 withdrew their consent, and 5 were not treated for various other reasons. Of 1291 patients treated (650 in the 3-month arm and 641 in the 6-month arm), 969 (75%) received the chemotherapy drug CAPOX. The hazard ratio (HR) for DFS of the 3-month arm compared with the 6-month arm was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.76-1.20). Hazard ratios were 1.07 (95% CI, 0.71-1.60) and 0.90 (95% CI, 0.68-1.20) for the drugs mFOLFOX6 and CAPOX, and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.53-1.24) and 1.07 (95% CI, 0.81-1.40) for patients with low-risk disease (TNM classification stages T1-3 and N1) and high-risk disease (stages T4 or N2), respectively. The rates of any grade of PSN lasting for 3 years in the 3-month vs 6-month treatment arms were 9.7% vs 24.3% (P 28.

The aim of this ad-hoc analysis was to evaluate the impact of lateral lymph node dissection on outcomes in the randomized clinical trial, referred to as the Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Stage II/III Rectal Cancer trial. METHODS: The Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Stage II/III Rectal Cancer trial was a randomized, phase III trial of adjuvant chemotherapy of 2 different oral fluoropyrimidines; 445 patients with lower rectal cancer were studied in this ad-hoc analysis out of 959 patients in total, 215 of whom underwent lateral lymph node dissection and 230 did not. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in background characteristics of the patients in the group, except for in age and number of dissected lymph nodes, between the lateral lymph node dissection and without lateral lymph node dissection groups. The age of the younger patients was often used to select candidates for lateral lymph node dissection (lateral lymph node dissection versus non-lateral lymph node dissection; 63.5 ± 8.9 vs 60.7 ± 9.4 [P = .0017]). Lateral lymph node dissection had no impact on relapse-free survival (hazard ratio = 0.941, 95% confidence interval: 0.696-1.271) or overall survival (hazard ratio = 0.858, 95% confidence interval: 0.601-1.224) in all patients with mid and low rectal cancer. In subset analysis, lateral lymph node dissection improved relapse-free survival in female patients and in patients with stage B/C or N3/4 disease. For cumulative recurrence across all patients, the proportion of patients with distant recurrence was slightly greater in the lateral lymph node dissection group but there was no difference in local recurrence. CONCLUSION: This exploratory analysis did not show that lateral lymph node dissection improves relapse-free survival and overall survival in patients with mid and low rectal cancer. Lateral lymph node dissection may, however, have a prognostic impact on patients with highly invasive rectal cancer.. 30.

Thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) is thought to be important for the incorporation of FTD into DNA, resulting in DNA dysfunction and cytotoxicity. However, it remains unknown whether TK1 is essential for FTD incorporation into DNA and whether this event is affected by the expression level of TK1 because TK1-specific-deficient human cancer cell lines have not been established. Here, we generated TK1-knock-out human colorectal cancer cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system and validated the specificity of TK1 knock-out by measuring expression of AFMID, which is encoded on the same locus as TK1. Using TK1-knock-out cells, we confirmed that TK1 is essential for cellular sensitivity to FTD. Furthermore, we demonstrated a correlation between the TK1 expression level and cytotoxicity of FTD using cells with inducible TK1 expression, which were generated from TK1-knock-out cells. Based on our finding that the TK1 expression level correlates with sensitivity to FTD, we suggest that FTD/TPI might efficiently treat cancers with high TK1 expression.. 31. Kosuke Hirose, Eiji Oki, Takayuki Shimose, Sanae Sakamoto, Shun Sasaki, Tomoko Jogo, Qingjiang Hu, Yasuo Tsuda, Koji Ando, Yuichiro Nakashima, Hiroshi Saeki, Masaki Mori, Comparison of computed tomography imaging analyses for evaluation after chemotherapy in patients with colorectal cancer: a retrospective pooled analysis of six phase II clinical trials., International journal of clinical oncology, 10.1007/s10147-019-01509-8, 24, 11, 1397-1405, 2019.11, BACKGROUND: There are several methods for analyzing computed tomography (CT) images to evaluate chemotherapy efficacy in clinical studies. However, the optimal analysis method for each drug is still under debate. We conducted a pooled analysis using data from six phase II studies to evaluate four analysis methods in colorectal cancers (CRCs): morphological responses (MRs), early tumor shrinkage (ETS), depth of response (DpR), and response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) ver.1.1. METHODS: We included 249 patients in this analysis. Pretreatments and findings of subsequent CT imaging were analyzed based on the MR, ETS, DpR, and RECIST ver.1.1. Differences in overall survival (OS) between the responders and non-responders according to each method were evaluated using survival analysis. RESULTS: The responders had significantly better hazard ratios (HRs) for OS, in terms of DpR (≥ median), ETS, objective response rate (ORR) [complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)], and disease control rate [CR + PR + stable disease (SD)]. Patients with right-sided colon cancers showed better HRs for DpR, but not for ETS and ORR. Contrastingly, patients with left-sided CRCs had better HRs for ETS, DpR, and ORR. MR was not associated with outcomes in this study, even in cases where bevacizumab was used. In patients with liver metastasis, ETS, DpR, and ORR showed better HRs, but not in those with lung metastasis. CONCLUSION: Early tumor shrinkage and DpR might be predictive markers only in left-sided CRCs with liver metastasis. Each imaging analysis has a different value based on the primary and metastatic sites.. 32. Hiroya Matsuoka, Koji Ando, Qingjiang Hu, Yoko Zaitsu, Yasuo Tsuda, Yuichi Hisamatsu, Yuichiro Nakashima, Yasue Kimura, Eiji Oki, Masaki Mori, Postoperative C-reactive protein/albumin ratio is a biomarker of risk of recurrence and need for adjuvant chemotherapy for stage III colorectal cancer., International journal of clinical oncology, 10.1007/s10147-020-01672-3, 25, 7, 1318-1326, 2020.07, BACKGROUND: Adjuvant chemotherapy is generally recommended for patients with stage III colorectal cancer. Even with adjuvant chemotherapy, 20-30% of such patients develop recurrences; the risk factors for recurrence are currently unclear. The preoperative systemic inflammation index has been linked to poor prognoses in patients with colorectal cancer; however, the relationship between postoperative systemic inflammation index and recurrence is unclear. We aimed to evaluate the association between preoperative and postoperative systemic inflammation indexes and recurrence in patients with stage III colorectal cancer. METHODS: The following laboratory data of 133 patients with stage III colorectal cancer were analyzed: preoperative and postoperative C-reactive protein/albumin ratios (CAR); neutrophil to lymphocyte ratios (NLR); and platelet to lymphocyte ratios (PLR) and their relationships with recurrence analyzed. RESULTS: The optimal cutoff values for systemic inflammation indexes were determined by examining receiver operating characteristic curves. Multivariate analyses indicated that N-stage, postoperative complications, preoperative NLR, and postoperative CAR were independent predictors of recurrence-free survival (RFS). Postoperative CAR was also an independent predictor of overall survival (OS). Patients with postoperative CAR ≥ 0.035 who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy had shorter RFS and OS than those who did. There were no significant differences in RFS and OS between patients with postoperative CAR 33.

Biweekly TAS-102 plus BEV combination could reduce unnecessary dose reduction of TAS-102, maintain higher doses, and possibly be effective even in cases without chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (CIN). The prespecified subgroup analysis of this study showed an obvious association between CIN within the first two cycles and prognosis of biweekly TAS-102 plus BEV. BACKGROUND: TAS-102 (trifluridine/tipiracil) plus bevacizumab (BEV) combination therapy has shown promising activity in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). However, the previously reported dose and schedule for the TAS-102 (70 mg/m2 /day on days 1-5 and 8-12, every 4 weeks) plus BEV (5 mg/kg on day 1, every 2 weeks) regimen is complicated by severe hematological toxicities and difficult administration schedules. Here, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of a more convenient biweekly TAS-102 plus BEV combination. METHODS: Patients with mCRC who were refractory or intolerant to standard chemotherapies were enrolled. Patients received biweekly TAS-102 (twice daily on days 1-5, every 2 weeks) with BEV (5mg/kg on day 1, every 2 weeks). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival rate at 16 weeks (16-w PFS rate). RESULTS: From October 2017 to January 2018, 46 patients were enrolled. The recommended phase II dose was determined to be TAS-102 (70 mg/m2 /day). Of the 44 eligible patients, the 16-w PFS rate was 40.9% (95% confidence interval, 26.3%-56.8%), and the null hypothesis was rejected (p 34.

A definitive diagnosis prior to surgery is often difficult. We encountered a patient with rectal sub-obstructive endometriosis that was treated by robot-assisted laparoscopic low anterior resection. CASE PRESENTATION: A 43-year-old woman visited our hospital with suspected stenosis caused by upper rectal cancer. She had a 2-year history of constipation. We were unable to confirm the diagnosis through detailed examinations, including laparoscopy. Robot-assisted laparoscopic low anterior resection with D3 lymph node dissection was performed for both diagnosis and treatment. The postoperative specimen showed a submucosal tumor. The pathological examination confirmed rectal endometriosis. CONCLUSIONS: We herein describe a rare case of obstructive rectal endometriosis that we were unable to diagnose preoperatively. Robotic surgery was useful in this case, which involved extensive pelvic adhesion.. 35.

We conducted the present study to evaluate the impact of contrast enhancement based on layer depth on WC of gastric cancer and to correlate them with pathological findings. METHODS: The subjects of this retrospective study consisted of 36 patients with advanced gastric cancer (22 men, 14 women; age range, 39-90 years; median, 67 years) who underwent contrast-enhanced CT before surgery. WC images of arterial phase were divided into first and second layer. Two radiologists in consensus evaluated the contrast enhancement of WC images for each layer and correlated with pathologic factors. RESULTS: Twenty-six (72%) of the gastric cancers showed a well-enhanced lesion in the first layer at the arterial phase on WC images, and 18 (50%) showed a well-enhanced lesion in the second layer. The study of second layers showed that the well-enhanced group had significantly more cases of differentiated type histology and intermediate stroma than the normally to poorly enhanced group (p = 0.008 and 0.0026). CONCLUSION: The contrast enhancement on WC of gastric cancer showed a significant relationship with pathological factors based on layer depth.. 36.

We conducted the first phase II trial among four Japanese study groups to assess the efficacy and safety of T-mab + S-1 and oxaliplatin (T-SOX130) for HER2+ AGC or recurrent gastric cancer. METHODS: Patients with IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/FISH+ tumors received 80 mg/m2 (80-120 mg/day) oral S-1 on days 1-14, 130 mg/m2 intravenous oxaliplatin on day 1, and intravenous T-mab (8 mg/kg loading dose, 6 mg/kg thereafter) on day 1 of a 21-day cycle. The primary endpoint was centrally assessed response rate (RR). Adverse events were based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Ver.4.0. RESULTS: We enrolled 42 patients from June 2015 to May 2016. Efficacy and safety analyses were conducted for 39 patients. The data cutoff was May 31, 2018. The confirmed RR was 82.1% (32/39; 90% CI 70.0-90.0); the disease control rate was 87.2% (34/39; 95% CI 73.3-94.4). Nine patients underwent curative surgery after T-SOX130. Median Time to treatment failure (TTF), Progression-free survival (PFS) and Overall survival (OS) was 5.7 (95% CI 4.6-7.0), 7.0 (95% CI 5.5-14.1), and 27.6 (95% CI 15.6-Not reached) months, respectively. Incidences of grade 3-4 adverse events > 10% were thrombocytopenia (17.9%), anorexia (17.9%), anemia (12.8%), neutropenia (10.3%), and hyponatremia (10.3%). CONCLUSIONS: T-SOX130 showed promising response and survival with a favorable safety profile and should be considered for patients with HER2+ AGC.. 37.

The objective of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of the CRP/Alb ratio in patients who underwent surgery for adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction (AEG) and upper gastric cancer (UGC). METHODS: Data for 144 patients who underwent surgery for AEG and UGC were reviewed. The CRP/Alb ratio, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-lymphocyte ratio, Glasgow Prognostic Score, and controlling nutritional status score were calculated, and the relationship between these biomarkers and postoperative prognosis was analyzed. RESULTS: The optimal cutoff value of the CRP/Alb ratio was determined to be 0.1. According to the cutoff value of CRP/Alb ratio, patients were divided into two groups (CRP/Alb 38. Khurum Khan, Stefano Cascinu, David Cunningham, Sun-Young Kim, Eiji Oki, Tara Seery, Lin Shen, Salvatore Siena, Christophe Tournigand, Nazim Serdar Turhal, Alain Hendlisz, Imaging and clinical correlates with regorafenib in metastatic colorectal cancer., Cancer treatment reviews, 10.1016/j.ctrv.2020.102020, 86, 102020-102020, 2020.06, In colorectal cancer (CRC), imaging is important in determining tumor stage, selecting treatment strategies, and in assessing response to therapy. However, some challenges remain with established imaging techniques, such as computed tomography, and with some commonly used response criteria, such as Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, which measures change in size of several target lesions instead of change in tumor morphology or metabolic function. In addition, these assessments are not typically conducted until after 8 weeks of treatment, meaning that potential non-responders are often not identified in a timely manner. Regorafenib, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of metastatic CRC, blocks the activity of several protein kinases involved in angiogenesis, oncogenesis, metastasis, and tumor immunity. Timely differentiation of regorafenib responders from non-responders using appropriate imaging techniques that recognize not only changes in tumor size but also changes in tumor density or vasculature, may reduce unnecessary drug-related toxicity in patients who are unlikely to respond to treatment. This review discusses the latest developments in computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography tumor imaging modalities, and how these aid in identifying patients with metastatic CRC who are responders or non-responders to regorafenib treatment.. 39.

Previous studies demonstrated the usefulness of APT imaging to predict tumor malignancy. We determined whether APT imaging can predict the tumor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). METHODS: Seventeen patients with LARC who underwent a pretherapeutic magnetic resonance examination including APT imaging and NAC (at least two courses) were enrolled. The APT-weighted imaging (WI) signal intensity (SI) (%) was defined as magnetization transfer ratio asymmetry (MTRasym ) at the offset of 3.5 ppm. Each tumor was histologically evaluated for the degree of degeneration and necrosis and then classified as one of five histological Grades (0, none; 1a, less than 1/3; 1b, 1/3 to 2/3; 2, more than 2/3; 3, all). We compared the mean APTWI SIs of the tumors between the Grade 0/1a/1b (low-response group) and Grade 2/3 (high-response group) by Student's t-test. We used receiver operating characteristics curves to determine the diagnostic performance of the APTWI SI for predicting the tumor response. RESULTS: The mean APTWI SI of the low-response group (n = 12; 3.05 ± 1.61%) was significantly higher than that of the high-response group (n = 5; 1.14 ± 1.13%) (P = 0.029). The area under the curve for predicting the tumor response using the APTWI SI was 0.87. When ≥2.75% was used as an indicator of low-response status, 75% sensitivity and 100% specificity of the APTWI SI were obtained. CONCLUSION: Pretherapeutic APT imaging can predict the tumor response to NAC in patients with LARC.. 40.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The subjects of this retrospective study consisted of 108 patients with advanced CRC (57 men, 51 women; age range, 32-87 years; median, 65 years) who underwent CTC. We compared local CTC features between the groups of complete (n = 74) and incomplete colonoscopy (n = 34). We performed a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to assess a diagnostic performance of CTC features to predict incomplete colonoscopy. RESULTS: The cross-sectional area of tumor and stenosis of complete colonoscopy group were significantly smaller and larger than those of incomplete colonoscopy group (p = 0.001 and 41.

We report the analysis of the Japanese subpopulation from ATTRACTION-2 that evaluated nivolumab versus placebo in unresectable advanced or recurrent G/GEJ cancer after ≥ 2 chemotherapy regimens. METHODS: Data from the Japanese subpopulation in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial were analyzed (data cutoff, February 25, 2017). Primary endpoint was overall survival (OS); secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR). RESULTS: Among the overall study population of 493 patients, 226 (nivolumab 152; placebo 74) were enrolled from 28 sites in Japan. In the Japanese subset, median OS was longer with nivolumab versus placebo (5.4 months, 95% CI 4.6-7.4 versus 3.6 months, 95% CI 2.8-5.0). The risk of death was lower in the nivolumab versus placebo group (hazard ratio 0.58, 95% CI 0.42-0.78; p = 0.0002). Incidences of serious adverse events were 23% (35/152) and 25% (18/72) in the nivolumab and placebo groups, respectively. In the Japanese ITT population, 22% of nivolumab-treated and 28% of placebo-treated patients received prior ramucirumab treatment. Overall, clinical activity of nivolumab was observed regardless of prior ramucirumab use. In the nivolumab group, ORR and PFS were numerically higher in patients with prior ramucirumab use than in those without. CONCLUSIONS: In the Japanese subpopulation, patients receiving nivolumab had longer OS, similar to the overall population, with a manageable safety profile. The interaction between nivolumab and ramucirumab will be clarified in ongoing clinical trials.. 42.

We conducted a multicentre, prospective study to investigate the concordance of the RAS mutational status between plasma ctDNA and tumour tissue DNA. METHODS: mCRC patients without prior anti-EGFR antibodies or regorafenib treatment were enroled. Plasma- and tissue-based RAS mutational status were determined by BEAMing, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 280 patients from eight institutions were eligible. The overall agreement between plasma- and tissue-based analyses was 86.4%, with a positive percent agreement of 82.1% and negative percent agreement of 90.4%. From logistic regression analysis, lung metastasis alone indicated the most significant factor associated with discordance. The agreement between plasma- and tissue-based analyses was 64.5% in patients with lung metastasis alone (n = 31) indicating lower amount of ctDNA. Among the cases with lung metastasis alone, all plasma- and tissue-based analyses were perfectly concordant in cases with ≥20 mm of maximum lesion diameter or ≥10 lesions. CONCLUSION: The clinical validity of OncoBEAMTM RAS CRC kit was confirmed. Careful attention should be paid for mCRC patients with lung metastases alone having fewer metastases or smaller diameter lesions.. 43. Yasue Kimura, Hiroshi Saeki, Qingjiang Hu, Yuichi Hisamatsu, Mioko Matsuo, Sei Yoshida, Eiji Oki, Ryuji Yasumatsu, Hideaki Kadota, Masaki Mori, Thoracoscopic esophagectomy in total pharyngolaryngoesophagectomy for esophageal cancer; A case series., Annals of medicine and surgery (2012), 10.1016/j.amsu.2020.10.006, 60, 9-13, 2020.12, BACKGROUND: Total pharyngolaryngoesophagectomy (TPLE) is associated with major complications and is extremely invasive. In 2011, our institution introduced thoracoscopic esophagectomy in the left hemi-prone position and laparoscopic reconstruction with a gastric tube in patients undergoing TPLE. Herein, we describe the use of this operative method in 26 patients, focusing on the technical aspects of the surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2011 to December 2018, 26 patients underwent minimally invasive TPLE with gastric tube reconstruction in our institute. The thoracoscopic procedure was performed with the patient in the semi-prone position. The patient was then moved to the supine position, and the laparoscopic procedure and pharyngolaryngectomy were started simultaneously. After pharyngolaryngectomy, microvascular anastomoses or free jejunal flap interposition were performed at the site of the gastric tube reconstruction. The data from these 26 patients were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The median age was 66 years, and 3.8% of the patients were female. The Union for International Cancer Control stages of esophageal cancer were 0 (n = 2), I (n = 4), II (n = 7), III (n = 8), and IV (n = 5). Eight patients had concomitant esophageal cancer and head and neck cancer. Reconstruction with only a narrow gastric tube was used in 16 patients, while free jejunal flap interposition was used in 10 patients. The surgical procedures resulted in minimal complications. Postoperative complications of Clavien-Dindo grade ≥1 included anastomotic leakage in two patients and pneumonia in one. CONCLUSION: Thoracoscopic esophagectomy in the left hemi-prone position and laparoscopic reconstruction with a gastric tube in patients undergoing TPLE was safe and effective. The complications were improved via the development of various procedures. Further improvement is necessary before this thoracoscopic approach is established as a standard procedure for TPLE.. 44.

However, advances in chemotherapy have provided new clinical approaches, permitting conversion surgery with the aim of R0 resection after resolving unresectability issues. CASE PRESENTATION: A 70-year-old man with gastric cancer invading the pancreatic tail and spleen and with periaortic lymph-node enlargement was admitted to our hospital. After 24 courses of nivolumab as third-line chemotherapy, periaortic lymph-node enlargement was resolved, and conversion surgery was planned. Intraoperatively, we found no peritoneal metastasis, but the distal pancreas, splenic hilum, and transverse colon were adhered to the gastric body. Therefore, we performed D2 total gastrectomy with distal pancreatosplenectomy and partial transverse colectomy. The pathological diagnosis was type III moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma (tub2) with signet ring cells, stage ypT1b (SM), ly0, and v0. The pathological proximal and distal tumor margins were negative. One lymph-node metastasis was observed (No. 4d; 1/23). Postoperatively, no recurrence was observed over 7 months, without adjuvant chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Nivolumab may allow R0 resection in patients with unresectable gastric cancer. Conversion surgery should be considered even after third-line nivolumab treatment.. 45. Yasuhiro Haruta, Yuichiro Nakashima, Tetsuo Ikeda, Eiji Oki, Tomoharu Yoshizumi, Evaluation of gastric tube blood flow by multispectral camera and fluorescence angiography., Surgery open science, 10.1016/j.sopen.2024.03.005, 19, 87-94, 2024.06, BACKGROUND: Evidence regarding the application of the multispectral camera for blood flow measurement is insufficient, and its performance has not been compared with the conventional indocyanine green (ICG) method. Therefore, we retrospectively compared the effectiveness of a new multispectral camera for non-invasive, real-time, quantitative imaging of tissue oxygen (O2) saturation and hemoglobin (Hb) levels and commercially available ICG fluorescence imaging in hemodynamic assessment of gastric tubes in esophagectomy. METHODS: Thirty patients who underwent thoracoscopic esophagectomy and gastric tube reconstruction for esophageal cancer were included in this study. The multispectral camera was used to measure tissue O2 saturation and Hb levels. The ICG fluorescence imaging, with the analysis software tool Lumi view, was employed to record ICG luminance changes, with values measured at the anastomotic site. Furthermore, the usefulness of each assessment device was examined using the arterial and venous blood flow indices as cutoff lines for cases with anastomotic failure. RESULTS: In the evaluation of arterial perfusion, anastomotic leak occurred in three of the five (60 %) patients with arterial insufficiency as assessed by the ICG imaging, while anastomotic leakage occurred in all three patients (100 %) who were assessed as having arterial insufficiency by the multispectral camera. In the evaluation of venous perfusion, anastomotic leakage occurred in three of the nine (33.3 %) patients diagnosed with venous stasis by the IC imaging and in three of the five (60 %) patients assessed by the multispectral camera. CONCLUSION: The multispectral camera assessed gastric tube blood flow more accurately than the ICG fluorescence method.. 46. Tadayoshi Hashimoto, Yoshiaki Nakamura, Eiji Oki, Shin Kobayashi, Junichiro Yuda, Taro Shibuki, Hideaki Bando, Takayuki Yoshino, Bridging horizons beyond CIRCULATE-Japan: a new paradigm in molecular residual disease detection via whole genome sequencing-based circulating tumor DNA assay., International journal of clinical oncology, 10.1007/s10147-024-02493-4, 29, 5, 495-511, 2024.05, Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is the fraction of cell-free DNA in patient blood that originates from a tumor. Advances in DNA sequencing technologies and our understanding of the molecular biology of tumors have increased interest in exploiting ctDNA to facilitate detection of molecular residual disease (MRD). Analysis of ctDNA as a promising MRD biomarker of solid malignancies has a central role in precision medicine initiatives exemplified by our CIRCULATE-Japan project involving patients with resectable colorectal cancer. Notably, the project underscores the prognostic significance of the ctDNA status at 4 weeks post-surgery and its correlation to adjuvant therapy efficacy at interim analysis. This substantiates the hypothesis that MRD is a critical prognostic indicator of relapse in patients with colorectal cancer. Despite remarkable advancements, challenges endure, primarily attributable to the exceedingly low ctDNA concentration in peripheral blood, particularly in scenarios involving low tumor shedding and the intrinsic error rates of current sequencing technologies. These complications necessitate more sensitive and sophisticated assays to verify the clinical utility of MRD across all solid tumors. Whole genome sequencing (WGS)-based tumor-informed MRD assays have recently demonstrated the ability to detect ctDNA in the parts-per-million range. This review delineates the current landscape of MRD assays, highlighting WGS-based approaches as the forefront technique in ctDNA analysis. Additionally, it introduces our upcoming endeavor, WGS-based pan-cancer MRD detection via ctDNA, in our forthcoming project, SCRUM-Japan MONSTAR-SCREEN-3.. 47. Shinya Umekita, Daisuke Kiyozawa, Kenichi Kohashi, Shinichiro Kawatoko, Taisuke Sasaki, Eikichi Ihara, Eiji Oki, Masafumi Nakamura, Yoshihiro Ogawa, Yoshinao Oda, Clinicopathological significance of microsatellite instability and immune escape mechanism in patients with gastric solid-type poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma., Gastric cancer : official journal of the International Gastric Cancer Association and the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association, 10.1007/s10120-024-01474-w, 27, 3, 484-494, 2024.05, BACKGROUND: In gastric solid-type poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (PDA), the role of microsatellite instability and immune escape mechanism remains unclear. The current study aimed to elucidate the clinical significance of mismatch repair (MMR) status, genome profile, C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2) expression, and myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) infiltration in solid-type PDA. METHODS: In total, 102 primary solid-type PDA cases were retrieved, and classified into 46 deficient-MMR (dMMR) and 56 proficient-MMR (pMMR) cases based on immunohistochemistry (IHC) and polymerase chain reaction-based molecular testing results. The mRNA expression profiles (NanoString nCounter Assay) of stage-matched dMMR (n = 6) and pMMR (n = 6) cases were examined. The CXCR2 expression and MDSC infiltration (CD11b- and CD33-positive cells) were investigated via IHC in all solid-type PDA cases. RESULTS: mRNA analysis revealed several differentially expressed genes and differences in biological behavior between the dMMR (n = 46) and pMMR (n = 56) groups. In the multivariate analysis, the dMMR status was significantly associated with a longer disease-free survival (hazard ratio = 5.152, p = 0.002) and overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio = 5.050, p = 0.005). CXCR2-high expression was significantly correlated with a shorter OS in the dMMR group (p = 0.018). A high infiltration of CD11b- and CD33-positive cells was significantly correlated with a shorter OS in the pMMR group (p = 0.022, 0.016, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: dMMR status can be a useful prognostic predictor, and CXCR2 and MDSCs can be novel therapeutic targets in patients with solid-type PDA.. 48.

METHODS: Eight medical advisors and eight trainee surgeons, one highly skilled per group, performed gastrectomy, rectal resection, cholecystectomy, and bleeding tasks on pigs. Using the Medicaroid surgical robot hinotori™, simulated delay times (0 ms, 50 ms, 100 ms, 150 ms, and 200 ms) were inserted mid-surgery to evaluate the tolerance level. Operative times and dual cockpit switching times were measured subjectively using 5-point scale questionnaires (mSUS [modified System Usability Scale], and Robot Usability Score). RESULTS: No significant difference was observed in operative times between proctors and operators (proctor: p = 0.247, operator: p = 0.608) nor in switching times to the dual cockpit mode (p = 0.248). For each survey setting, proctors tended to give lower ratings to delays of ≥ 150 ms. No marked difference was observed in the operator evaluations. On the postoperative questionnaires, there were no marked differences in the mSUS or Robot Usability Score between the proctors and operators (mSUS: p = 0.779, Robot Usability Score: p = 0.261). CONCLUSION: Telesurgery using a dual cockpit with hinotori™ is practical and has little impact on surgical procedures.. 49.

METHODS: The surgeon's console was installed at two sites (Fukuoka and Beppu; 140 km apart), and the patient cart was installed in Fukuoka. During the experiment, the surgeon was blinded to the haptic feedback levels and asked to grasp the intestinal tract in an animal model. The surgeon then performed the tasks at each location. RESULTS: No marked differences in task accuracy or average grasping force were observed between the surgeon locations. However, the average task completion time was significantly longer, and the system usability scale (SUS) was significantly lower rating for remote operations than for local ones. No marked differences in task accuracy or task completion time were observed between the haptic feedback levels. However, with haptic feedback, the organ was grasped with a significantly weaker force than that without it. Furthermore, with haptic feedback, experienced surgeons in robotic surgery tended to perform an equivalent task with weaker grasping forces than inexperienced surgeons. CONCLUSION: The haptic feedback function is a tool that allows the surgeon to perform surgery with an appropriate grasping force, both on site and remotely. Improved safety is necessary in telesurgery; haptic feedback will thus be an essential technology in robotic telesurgery going forward.. 50.

In addition, ACC was also known to harbor marked intra-tumoral heterogeneity of steroidogenesis or disorganized steroidogenesis. Therefore, in this study, we immune-profiled tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and pivotal steroidogenic enzymes of glucocorticoid biosynthesis (CYP17A and CYP11B1) to explore the potential effects of in situ glucocorticoid production and intra-tumoral heterogeneity/disorganized steroidogenesis on tumor immunity of ACC. We also studied the correlations of the status of tumor immunity with that of angiogenesis and tumor grade to further explore the tumor tissue microenvironment of ACC. TILs (CD3, CD4, CD8, and FOXP3), TAMs (CD68 and CD163), key steroidogenic enzymes of glucocorticoid (CYP17A and CYP11B1), angiogenesis (CD31 and vasohibin-1 (VASH-1)), tumor grade (Ki-67 and Weiss score) were immunohistochemically evaluated in 34 ACCs. Increased CYP17A immunoreactivity in the whole tumor area was significantly positively correlated with FOXP3-positive TILs (p = 0.021) and negatively with CD4/CD3 ratio (p = 0.001). Increased CYP11B1 immunoreactivity in the whole tumor area was significantly positively correlated with CD8/CD3 (p = 0.039) and CD163/CD68 ratios (p = 0.006) and negatively with CD4-positive TILs (p = 0.036) and CD4/CD3 ratio (p = 0.001). There were also significant positive correlations between CYP17A and CD8 (r = 0.334, p 51.

We conducted this study to investigate the effect of resection margins on the prognosis of resectable colon cancer. METHODS: We analyzed data on 1458 patients who underwent colorectal resection in our institute between January, 2004 and March, 2020, including 579 patients with resectable colon cancer. The association between the resection margin and recurrence for each oncological status was assessed and the value of the resection length that influenced recurrence was analyzed. RESULTS: Patients who had pT4 colon cancer with margins of more than 7 cm had a trend of fewer recurrences and longer relapse-free survival (RFS) than those with colon cancer of other stages (P = 0.033; hazard ratio [HR], 0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.20-0.89). Multivariate analysis identified a margin of 52.
