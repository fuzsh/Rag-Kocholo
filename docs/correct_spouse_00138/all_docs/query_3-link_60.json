While adult tissue stem cells have been identified as targets of GVHD in the skin and gut, their role in hepatic GVHD is yet to be clarified. In the current study, we explored the fate of bile duct stem cells (BDSCs), capable of generating liver organoids in vitro, during hepatic GVHD after allogeneic HCT. We observed a significant expansion of biliary epithelial cells (BECs) upon injury early after allogeneic HCT. Organoid-forming efficiency from the bile duct was also significantly increased early after allogeneic HCT. Subsequently, the organoid-forming efficiency from bile ducts was markedly decreased in association with the reduction of BECs and the elevation of plasma concentrations of bilirubin, suggesting that GVHD targets BDSCs and impairs the resilience of BECs. The growth of liver organoids in the presence of liver-infiltrating mononuclear cells from allogeneic recipients, but not from syngeneic recipients, significantly reduced in a TGF--dependent manner. Administration of SB-431542, an inhibitor of TGF-β signaling, from day 14 to day 28 protected organoid-forming BDSCs against GVHD and mitigated biliary dysfunction after allogeneic HCT, suggesting that BDSCs are a promising therapeutic target for hepatic GVHD.\n\nYutaka Morishima, Masahito Kawabori, Kazuyoshi Yamazaki, Soichiro Takamiya, Sho Yamaguchi, Yo Nakahara, Hajime Senjo, Daigo Hashimoto, Sakiko Masuda, Yoichiro Fujioka, Yusuke Ohba, Yuki Mizuno, Yuji Kuge, Miki Fujimura\n\nInternational journal of molecular sciences 25 (4) 2024/02/18\n\nSpinal cord injury (SCI) leads to devastating sequelae, demanding effective treatments. Recent advancements have unveiled the role of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) produced by infiltrated neutrophils in exacerbating secondary inflammation after SCI, making it a potential target for treatment intervention. Previous research has established that intravenous administration of stem cell-derived exosomes can mitigate injuries. While stem cell-derived exosomes have demonstrated the ability to modulate microglial reactions and enhance blood-brain barrier integrity, their impact on neutrophil deactivation, especially in the context of NETs, remains poorly understood. This study aims to investigate the effects of intravenous administration of MSC-derived exosomes, with a specific focus on NET formation, and to elucidate the associated molecular mechanisms. Exosomes were isolated from the cell supernatants of amnion-derived mesenchymal stem cells using the ultracentrifugation method. Spinal cord injuries were induced in Sprague-Dawley rats (9 weeks old) using a clip injury model, and 100 μg of exosomes in 1 mL of PBS or PBS alone were intravenously administered 24 h post-injury. Motor function was assessed serially for up to 28 days following the injury. On Day 3 and Day 28, spinal cord specimens were analyzed to evaluate the extent of injury and the formation of NETs. Flow cytometry was employed to examine the formation of circulating neutrophil NETs. Exogenous miRNA was electroporated into neutrophil to evaluate the effect of inflammatory NET formation. Finally, the biodistribution of exosomes was assessed using 64Cu-labeled exosomes in animal positron emission tomography (PET). Rats treated with exosomes exhibited a substantial improvement in motor function recovery and a reduction in injury size. Notably, there was a significant decrease in neutrophil infiltration and NET formation within the spinal cord, as well as a reduction in neutrophils forming NETs in the circulation. In vitro investigations indicated that exosomes accumulated in the vicinity of the nuclei of activated neutrophils, and neutrophils electroporated with the miR-125a-3p mimic exhibited a significantly diminished NET formation, while miR-125a-3p inhibitor reversed the effect. PET studies revealed that, although the majority of the transplanted exosomes were sequestered in the liver and spleen, a notably high quantity of exosomes was detected in the damaged spinal cord when compared to normal rats. MSC-derived exosomes play a pivotal role in alleviating spinal cord injury, in part through the deactivation of NET formation via miR-125a-3p.\n\nShota Yokoyama, Masahiro Onozawa, Shota Yoshida, Naoki Miyashita, Hiroyuki Kimura, Shogo Takahashi, Toshihiro Matsukawa, Hideki Goto, Shinichi Fujisawa, Kosuke Miki, Daisuke Hidaka, Junichi Hashiguchi, Kentaro Wakasa, Makoto Ibata, Yukari Takeda, Akio Shigematsu, Katsuya Fujimoto, Yutaka Tsutsumi, Akio Mori, Toshimichi Ishihara, Yasutaka Kakinoki, Takeshi Kondo, Daigo Hashimoto, Takanori Teshima\n\nBritish journal of haematology 201 (6) 1144 - 1152 2023/04/17\n\nRecent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have enabled the detection of subclinical minute FLT3-ITD. We selected 74 newly diagnosed, cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) samples in which FLT3-ITD was not detected by gel electrophoresis. We sequenced them using NGS and found minute FLT3-ITDs in 19 cases. We compared cases with clinically relevant FLT3-ITD (n = 37), cases with minute FLT3-ITD (n = 19) and cases without detectable FLT3-ITD (n = 55). Molecular characteristics (location and length) of minute FLT3-ITD were similar to those of clinically relevant FLT3-ITD. Survival of cases with minute FLT3-ITD was similar to that of cases without detectable FLT3-ITD, whereas the relapse rate within 1 year after onset was significantly higher in cases with minute FLT3-ITD. We followed 18 relapsed samples of cases with clinically FLT3-ITD-negative at diagnosis. Two of 3 cases with minute FLT3-ITD relapsed with progression to clinically relevant FLT3-ITD. Two of 15 cases in which FLT3-ITD was not detected by NGS relapsed with the emergence of minute FLT3-ITD, and one of them showed progression to clinically relevant FLT3-ITD at the second relapse. We revealed the clonal dynamics of subclinical minute FLT3-ITD in clinically FLT3-ITD-negative AML. Minute FLT3-ITD at the initial AML can expand to become a dominant clone at relapse.\n\nShunta Nakamura, Kiminori Nakamura, Yuki Yokoi, Yu Shimizu, Shuya Ohira, Mizu Hagiwara, Zihao Song, Li Gan, Tomoyasu Aizawa, Daigo Hashimoto, Takanori Teshima, Andre J. Ouellette, Tokiyoshi Ayabe\n\nScientific Reports 13 (1) 2023/03/09\n\nAbstract Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a chronic liver disease characterized by fibrosis that develops from fatty liver. Disruption of intestinal microbiota homeostasis, dysbiosis, is associated with fibrosis development in NASH. An antimicrobial peptide α-defensin secreted by Paneth cells in the small intestine is known to regulate composition of the intestinal microbiota. However, involvement of α-defensin in NASH remains unknown. Here, we show that in diet-induced NASH model mice, decrease of fecal α-defensin along with dysbiosis occurs before NASH onset. When α-defensin levels in the intestinal lumen are restored by intravenous administration of R-Spondin1 to induce Paneth cell regeneration or by oral administration of α-defensins, liver fibrosis is ameliorated with dissolving dysbiosis. Furthermore, R-Spondin1 and α-defensin improved liver pathologies together with different features in the intestinal microbiota. These results indicate that decreased α-defensin secretion induces liver fibrosis through dysbiosis, further suggesting Paneth cell α-defensin as a potential therapeutic target for NASH.\n\nRoni Shouval, Nicholas R Waters, Antonio L C Gomes, Corrado Zuanelli Brambilla, Teng Fei, Sean M Devlin, Chi L Nguyen, Kate A Markey, Anqi Dai, John B Slingerland, Annelie G Clurman, Emily Fontana, Luigi A Amoretti, Roberta J Wright, Tobias M Hohl, Ying Taur, Anthony D Sung, Daniela Weber, Daigo Hashimoto, Takanori Teshima, Nelson J Chao, Ernst Holler, Michael Scordo, Sergio A Giralt, Miguel-Angel Perales, Jonathan U Peled, Marcel R M van den Brink\n\nClinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research 29 (1) 165 - 173 2023/01/04\n\nPURPOSE: The gut microbiota is subject to multiple insults in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) recipients. We hypothesized that preparative conditioning regimens contribute to microbiota perturbation in allo-HCT. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: This was a retrospective study that evaluated the relationship between conditioning regimens exposure in 1,188 allo-HCT recipients and the gut microbiome. Stool samples collected from 20 days before transplantation up to 30 days after were profiled using 16S rRNA sequencing. Microbiota injury was quantified by changes in α-diversity. RESULTS: We identified distinct patterns of microbiota injury that varied by conditioning regimen. Diversity loss was graded into three levels of conditioning-associated microbiota injury (CMBI) in a multivariable model that included antibiotic exposures. High-intensity regimens, such as total body irradiation (TBI)-thiotepa-cyclophosphamide, were associated with the greatest injury (CMBI III). In contrast, the nonmyeloablative regimen fludarabine-cyclophosphamide with low-dose TBI (Flu/Cy/TBI200) had a low-grade injury (CMBI I). The risk of acute GVHD correlated with CMBI degree. Pretransplant microbial compositions were best preserved with Flu/Cy/TBI200, whereas other regimens were associated with loss of commensal bacteria and expansion of Enterococcus. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support an interaction between conditioning at the regimen level and the extent of microbiota injury.\n\nHajime Senjo, Masahiro Onozawa, Daisuke Hidaka, Shota Yokoyama, Satoshi Yamamoto, Yutaka Tsutsumi, Yoshihito Haseyama, Takahiro Nagashima, Akio Mori, Shuichi Ota, Hajime Sakai, Toshimichi Ishihara, Takuto Miyagishima, Yasutaka Kakinoki, Mitsutoshi Kurosawa, Hajime Kobayashi, Hiroshi Iwasaki, Daigo Hashimoto, Takeshi Kondo, Takanori Teshima\n\nScientific reports 12 (1) 8885 - 8885 2022/05/25\n\nAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients older than 65 years have a poor prognosis. Recently, CAR (C-reactive-protein/albumin ratio) has been actively reported as a prognostic index reflecting the nutritional and inflammatory status of elderly patients with solid tumors, but the usefulness of this index as a prognostic indicator in transplant-ineligible elderly AML patients has not been investigated. We studied genetic alterations and CARs in 188 newly diagnosed AML patients aged 65 years or older who were treated in a multicenter setting and had treated without HSCT. Both NCCN 2017 risk group, reflecting the genetic component of the tumor, and CAR, reflecting the inflammatory and nutritional status of the patient, successfully stratified the overall survival (OS) of the patients (2-year OS; CAR low vs high, 42.3% vs 17.8%, P < 0.001). Furthermore, in multivariate analysis, NCCN 2017 poor group and high CAR were extracted as independent poor prognostic factors predicting 2-year OS in the current study. We found, for the first time, that CAR at diagnosis predicted the prognosis of elderly patients with newly diagnosed AML treated without HSCT.\n\nZixuan Zhang, Yuta Hasegawa, Daigo Hashimoto, Hajime Senjo, Ryo Kikuchi, Xuanzhong Chen, Kazuki Yoneda, Tomoko Sekiguchi, Tatsuya Kawase, Hirofumi Tsuzuki, Takashi Ishio, Takahide Ara, Hiroyuki Ohigashi, Masao Nakagawa, Takanori Teshima\n\nBone marrow transplantation 57 (5) 775 - 780 2022/05\n\nAllogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is a potentially curative therapy for FLT3 internal tandem duplication mutant (FLT3-ITD+) acute myeloid leukemia, but relapse rate is high. A recent study showed that sorafenib, a first generation FLT3 and multikinase inhibitor, enhanced graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects against FLT3-ITD+ leukemia via interleukin-15 (IL-15) production. However, it remains to be clarified whether this effect could be mediated by selective FLT3 inhibition. We investigated whether gilteritinib, a selective FLT3 inhibitor, could enhance GVL effects against FLT3-ITD transfected Ba/F3 leukemia (Ba/F3-FLT3-ITD) in mice. Oral administration of gilteritinib from day +5 to +14 after allo-SCT reduced expression of the co-inhibitory receptors PD-1 and TIGIT on donor CD8+ T cells and enhanced IL-15 expression in Ba/F3-FLT3-ITD. Bioluminescent imaging using luciferase-transfected Ba/F3-FLT3-ITD demonstrated that gilteritinib significantly suppressed leukemia expansion after allo-SCT, whereas it did not impact the morbidity or mortality of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), resulting in significant improvement of overall survival. In conclusion, short-term administration of gilteritinib after allo-SCT enhanced GVL effects against FLT3-ITD+ leukemia without exacerbating GVHD.\n\nKeito Yokoyama, Hiroyuki Ohigashi, Toru Miyajima, Naoki Miyashita, Satomi Okada, Yuta Hasegawa, Junichi Sugita, Masahiro Onozawa, Daigo Hashimoto, Takanori Teshima\n\n[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology 63 (8) 870 - 875 2022\n\nBing-Neel syndrome (BNS) is a rare disease manifestation of Waldenström's macroglobulinemia characterized by abnormal lymphoplasmacytoid cells infiltration of the central nervous system. In September 2019, a 46-year-old man presented to a previous hospital with hand tremors, nausea, and dysuria. Demyelination of cerebral white matter and the spinal cord was discovered using MRI. Steroid pulse therapy was used to treat inflammatory demyelinating disease, and it provided temporary relief, but the symptoms returned when the steroids were stopped. He was referred to our hospital in June 2020, for further evaluation with the possibility of hematological malignancy. BNS was diagnosed based on the presence of abnormal lymphoplasmacytoid cells in the bone marrow and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), as well as the presence of the MYD88L265P mutation in the CSF specimen. In July 2020, BR (bendamustine, rituximab) therapy was administered, but it was ineffective. Oral administration of tirabrutinib, which was recently approved for WM, began in August 2020. He has achieved long-term remission and steroid withdrawal, with no notable side effects. This is the second report of successful treatment of BNS with tirabrutinib. More research is needed to confirm tirabrutinib's efficacy in the treatment of BNS.\n\nSoichiro Takamiya, Masahito Kawabori, Kazuyoshi Yamazaki, Sho Yamaguchi, Aki Tanimori, Koji Yamamoto, Shunsuke Ohnishi, Toshitaka Seki, Kotaro Konno, Khin Khin Tha, Daigo Hashimoto, Masahiko Watanabe, Kiyohiro Houkin, Miki Fujimura\n\nPloS one 17 (7) e0270606 2022\n\nSpinal cord injury (SCI) is often accompanied by gastrointestinal dysfunction due to the disconnection of the spinal autonomic nervous system. Gastrointestinal dysfunction reportedly upregulates intestinal permeability, leading to bacterial translocation of the gut microbiome to the systemic circulation, which further activates systemic inflammation, exacerbating neuronal damage. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) reportedly ameliorate SCI. Here, we aimed to investigate their effect on the associated gastrointestinal dysfunction. Human amnion-derived MSC (AMSCs) were intravenously transplanted one day after a rat model of midthoracic SCI. Biodistribution of transplanted cells, behavioral assessment, and histological evaluations of the spinal cord and intestine were conducted to elucidate the therapeutic effect of AMSCs. Bacterial translocation of the gut microbiome was examined by in situ hybridization and bacterial culture of the liver. Systemic inflammations were examined by blood cytokines, infiltrating immune cells in the spinal cord, and the size of the peripheral immune tissue. AMSCs released various neurotrophic factors and were mainly distributed in the liver and lung after transplantation. AMSC-transplanted animals showed smaller spinal damage and better neurological recovery with preserved neuronal tract. AMSCs transplantation ameliorated intestinal dysfunction both morphologically and functionally, which prevented translocation of the gut microbiome to the systemic circulation. Systemic inflammations were decreased in animals receiving AMSCs in the chronic phase. Intravenous AMSC administration during the acute phase of SCI rescues both spinal damage and intestinal dysfunction. Reducing bacterial translocation may contribute to decreasing systemic inflammation.\n\nSouichi Shiratori, Junichi Sugita, Shigeo Fuji, Jun Aoki, Masashi Sawa, Yukiyasu Ozawa, Daigo Hashimoto, Ken-ichi Matsuoka, Kazunori Imada, Noriko Doki, Takashi Ashida, Yasunori Ueda, Masatsugu Tanaka, Yasushi Sawayama, Tatsuo Ichinohe, Seitaro Terakura, Satoko Morishima, Yoshiko Atsuta, Takahiro Fukuda, Takanori Teshima\n\nBone Marrow Transplantation 56 (9) 2231 - 2240 0268-3369 2021/09 [Refereed]\n\nAntithymocyte globulin (ATG) has been shown to reduce chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) particularly in allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) from unrelated donors; however, anti-GVHD effects of lower doses of ATG remains to be elucidated. We conducted a nationwide retrospective study to compare the outcomes of unrelated PBSCT with or without rabbit ATG (thymoglobulin) in 287 patients. A median ATG dose was 2.0 mg/kg. The primary endpoint, the cumulative incidence of moderate-severe chronic GVHD at 2 years was 22.1% in the ATG group, which was significantly less than that in the non-ATG group (36.3%, P = 0.025). The ATG group had a higher incidence of immunosuppressant discontinuation, GVHD-free, relapse-free survival, and moderate-severe chronic GVHD-free, relapse-free survival at 2 years compared to the non-ATG group. The incidences of grade III-IV aGVHD and moderate-severe chronic GVHD were significantly higher in patients with high absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) before the administration of ATG, whereas relapse rate was significantly higher in patients with low ALC before ATG. In conclusion, low-dose ATG effectively suppresses chronic GVHD in unrelated PBSCT, and ALC before ATG may be a potential predictor for GVHD and relapse.\n\nTakahide Ara, Daigo Hashimoto\n\nFrontiers in Immunology 12 2021/08/27 [Refereed][Invited]\n\nProphylaxis for and treatment of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) are essential for successful allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) and mainly consist of immunosuppressants such as calcineurin inhibitors. However, profound immunosuppression can lead to tumor relapse and infectious complications, which emphasizes the necessity of developing novel management strategies for GVHD. Emerging evidence has revealed that tissue-specific mechanisms maintaining tissue homeostasis and promoting tissue tolerance to combat GVHD are damaged after allo-SCT, resulting in exacerbation and treatment refractoriness of GVHD. In the gastrointestinal tract, epithelial regeneration derived from intestinal stem cells (ISCs), a microenvironment that maintains healthy gut microbiota, and physical and chemical mucosal barrier functions against pathogens are damaged by conditioning regimens and/or GVHD. The administration of growth factors for cells that maintain intestinal homeostasis, such as interleukin-22 (IL-22) for ISCs, R-spondin 1 (R-Spo1) for ISCs and Paneth cells, and interleukin-25 (IL-25) for goblet cells, mitigates murine GVHD. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the understanding of GVHD-induced tissue damage and emerging strategies for the management of GVHD.\n\nSouichi Shiratori, Hiroyuki Ohigashi, Takahide Ara, Atsushi Yasumoto, Hideki Goto, Masao Nakagawa, Junichi Sugita, Masahiro Onozawa, Kaoru Kahata, Tomoyuki Endo, Daigo Hashimoto, Takanori Teshima\n\nAnnals of Hematology 100 (5) 1321 - 1328 0939-5555 2021/05 [Refereed]\n\nAntithymocyte globulin (ATG) reduces severe acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). However, risk factors for severe acute GVHD in PBSCT using ATG remain to be determined. We conducted a single-center, retrospective study to analyze the association of acute GVHD requiring systemic corticosteroid (SC-aGVHD) with absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) before the administration of ATG or conditioning in 53 patients with HLA-matched PBSCT using low-dose thymoglobulin (2 mg/kg) after myeloablative conditioning. The cumulative incidence of SC-aGVHD was 17.0% and ALC before ATG were significantly higher in patients with SC-aGVHD compared to that in patients without it (median, 0.15 × 109/L vs 0.06 × 109/L, P = 0.047). The cumulative incidence of SC-aGVHD was significantly higher in patients with high ALC before ATG (≥ 0.15 × 109/L) than in those with low ALC (38.5% vs 10.0%, P = 0.016). Non-relapse mortality (NRM) was also significantly higher in the high ALC before ATG group than the low ALC before ATG group (2-year NRM: 23.9% vs 6.0%, P = 0.048), leading to worse survival (2-year overall survival: 69.2% vs 83.5%, P = 0.039). Our study suggested that high ALC before ATG is a risk factor for SC-aGVHD.\n\nShinpei Harada, Kohei Okada, Shota Yokoyama, Daisuke Hidaka, Eiko Hayase, Masahiro Onozawa, Hideki Goto, Daigo Hashimoto, Kaoru Kahata, Tomoyuki Endo, Takanori Teshima\n\n[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology 62 (11) 1609 - 1614 2021\n\nA 25-year-old male with a medical history of stress polycythemia was admitted to a previous hospital for leukocytosis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.

Based on these findings, a diagnosis of an unclassifiable myeloproliferative neoplasm was made, and he was started on hydroxyurea treatment. He was referred to our hospital in April 2016 for transfusion dependence. Bone marrow examination performed at our hospital revealed granulocytic dysplasia and CSF3R T618I was detected. After induction therapy, CSF3R T618I became undetectable, and he went on to undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation in October 2016. He has been in remission for >4 years posttransplantation.

The risk stratification based on genetic alteration has been proposed in national comprehensive cancer network (NCCN) guideline but its efficacy was not well verified especially in real world elderly patients. The nutritional status assessment using controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score is a prognostic biomarker in elderly patients with solid tumors but was not examined in elderly AML patients. We performed prospective analysis of genetic alterations of 174 patients aged 65 or older with newly diagnosed AML treated without hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and developed simplified CONUT (sCONUT) score by eliminating total lymphocyte count from the items to adapt AML patients. In this cohort, both the NCCN 2017 risk group and sCONUT score successfully stratified the overall survival (OS) of the elderly patients. A multivariable analysis demonstrated that adverse group in NCCN 2017 and high sCONUT score were independently associated with poor 2-year OS.

Emerging evidence indicates that poor nutritional status determined with nutritional indices such as geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI), prognostic nutritional index (PNI), and controlling nutritional status score (CONUT) was associated with poor prognosis of DLBCL. We conducted this multicenter retrospective study to validate and compare prognostic values of the three indices in 615 newly diagnosed DLBCL patients. The overall survival (OS) in patients with poor nutritional status determined with each of these nutritional indices were significantly inferior compared with that in those without nutritional risks (5-year OS in patients with GNRI < 95.7 and GNRI ≥ 95.7 were 56.4% and 83.5%, P < 0.001; PNI < 42.4 and PNI ≥ 42.4 were 56.1% and 81.0%, P < 0.001; CONUT > 4 and CONUT ≤ 4 were 53.1% and 77.1%, P < 0.001). GNRI and CONUT were independent prognostic predictors for OS (GNRI < 95.7, hazard ratio [HR] 1.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.22-2.74, P = 0.0032; CONUT > 4, HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.05-2.23, P = 0.028) after multivariate analyses. Nutritional status determined with GNRI affected OS more strongly in the patients with nongerminal center B cell-like (nonGCB) DLBCL compared with that in those with GCB-type DLBCL. In conclusion, baseline poor nutritional status determined based on GNRI or CONUT was an independent risk factor of newly diagnosed DLBCL, and GNRI was also useful as an independent prognostic factor for patients with nonGCB-type DLBCL.\n\nHideki Goto, Daisuke Hidaka, Satoshi Yamamoto, Koji Hayasaka, Rie Michimata, Ikuko Kagawa, Kana Sunagoya, Hiroaki Iijima, Eiko Hayase, Souichi Shiratori, Kohei Okada, Junichi Sugita, Masahiro Onozawa, Daigo Hashimoto, Kaoru Kahata, Katsuya Fujimoto, Tomoyuki Endo, Chikara Shimizu, Takanori Teshima\n\nJournal of clinical apheresis 35 (5) 413 - 419 2020/09\n\nBACKGROUND: Pegfilgrastim has equivalent efficacy to daily granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in enhancing neutrophil recovery after chemotherapy, but data on its use for peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilization are limited. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of CD34+ PBSC mobilization by low-dose (3.6 mg) pegfilgrastim after chemotherapy in patients with malignant lymphoma. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty patients with malignant lymphoma were enrolled in this study. Cytotoxic chemotherapy was started on day 1, and 3.6 mg of pegfilgrastim was subcutaneously administered on day 7. CD34+ cells were counted in the peripheral blood daily from days 11 to 14 using a flow cytometric analysis. RESULTS: In 19 of the 20 patients (95%), the CD34+ cell counts in the peripheral blood exceeded 10 × 106/L, with a mean value of 20.3 on day 11, 38.0 on day 12, 40.3 on day 13, and 40.1 on day 14. Older age was associated with lower maximum CD34+ cell mobilization. The most frequent adverse events associated with pegfilgrastim were back pain, nausea, appetite loss, and lactate dehydrogenase elevation. CONCLUSION: Our data indicated that a single dose of 3.6 mg pegfilgrastim on day 7 after chemotherapy safely and effectively mobilized CD34+ cells.\n\nTakahide Ara, Daigo Hashimoto, Eiko Hayase, Clara Noizat, Ryo Kikuchi, Yuta Hasegawa, Kana Matsuda, Shoko Ono, Yoshihiro Matsuno, Ko Ebata, Reiki Ogasawara, Shuichiro Takahashi, Hiroyuki Ohigashi, Emi Yokoyama, Keitaro Matsuo, Junichi Sugita, Masahiro Onozawa, Ryu Okumura, Kiyoshi Takeda, Takanori Teshima\n\nScience translational medicine 12 (550) 2020/07/01 [Refereed][Not invited]\n\nGraft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and infection are major obstacles to successful allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Intestinal goblet cells form the mucus layers, which spatially segregate gut microbiota from host tissues. Although it is well known that goblet cell loss is one of the histologic features of GVHD, effects of their loss in pathophysiology of GVHD remain to be elucidated. In mouse models of allogeneic HSCT, goblet cells in the colon were significantly reduced, resulting in disruption of the inner mucus layer of the colon and increased bacterial translocation into colonic mucosa. Pretransplant administration of interleukin-25 (IL-25), a growth factor for goblet cells, protected goblet cells against GVHD, prevented bacterial translocation, reduced plasma concentrations of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and IL-6, and ameliorated GVHD. The protective role of IL-25 was dependent on Lypd8, an antimicrobial molecule produced by enterocytes in the colon that suppresses motility of flagellated bacteria. In clinical colon biopsies, low numbers of goblet cells were significantly associated with severe intestinal GVHD, increased transplant-related mortality, and poor survival after HSCT. Goblet cell loss is associated with poor transplant outcome, and administration of IL-25 represents an adjunct therapeutic strategy for GVHD by protecting goblet cells.\n\nHajime Senjo, Kenji Hirata, Koh Izumiyama, Koichiro Minauchi, Eriko Tsukamoto, Kazuo Itoh, Minoru Kanaya, Akio Mori, Shuichi Ota, Daigo Hashimoto, Takanori Teshima\n\nBlood advances 4 (10) 2286 - 2296 2020/05/26 [Refereed][Not invited]\n\nMetabolic heterogeneity (MH) can be measured using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), and it indicates an inhomogeneous tumor microenvironment. High MH has been shown to predict a worse prognosis for primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, whereas its prognostic value in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) remains to be determined. In the current study, we investigated the prognostic values of MH evaluated in newly diagnosed DLBCL. In the training cohort, 86 patients treated with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone-like chemotherapies were divided into low-MH and high-MH groups using receiver operating characteristic analysis. MH was not correlated with metabolic tumor volume of the corresponding lesion, indicating that MH was independent of tumor burden. At 5 years, overall survivals were 89.5% vs 61.2% (P = .0122) and event-free survivals were 73.1% vs 51.1% (P = .0327) in the low- and high-MH groups, respectively. A multivariate Cox-regression analysis showed that MH was an independent predictive factor for overall survival. The adverse prognostic impacts of high MH were confirmed in an independent validation cohort with 64 patients. In conclusion, MH on baseline 18FDG-PET/CT scan predicts treatment outcomes for patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL.\n\nKana Matsuda, Shoko Ono, Ikko Tanaka, Masaki Inoue, Sayoko Kinowaki, Marin Ishikawa, Momoko Tsuda, Keiko Yamamoto, Yuichi Shimizu, Shuichiro Takahashi, Eiko Hayase, Daigo Hashimoto, Takanori Teshima, Naoya Sakamoto\n\nAnnals of hematology 99 (5) 1121 - 1128 2020/05 [Refereed][Not invited]\n\nAIM: To measure histological villous atrophy and to clarify the diagnostic accuracy of endoscopic villous atrophy in gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease. METHODS: Data for patients who underwent upper and/or lower endoscopic examinations after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation were retrospectively collected. In study 1, group A included 56 patients in whom GI-GVHD was histologically confirmed and group B included 60 patients in whom GI-GVHD was not histologically confirmed. Group C included 59 patients before HSCT. The lengths of villi and crypts in the duodenum and terminal ileum were histologically measured. In study 2, the diagnostic accuracies of villous atrophy of the duodenum and of the terminal ileum using magnifying endoscopy were evaluated. RESULTS: In study 1, the lengths of villi and the villi/crypt (V/C) ratios of the duodenum and terminal ileum in group A were significantly smaller than those in the other groups (p < 0.05). V/C ratio was moderately correlated with clinical severity, histological grades, and endoscopic grades in the terminal ileum. In study 2, the diagnostic accuracies of magnified images for villous atrophy were 83.8% in the duodenum and 94.9% in the terminal ileum. CONCLUSION: Magnifying endoscopy enables evaluation of villous atrophy and is useful for optical biopsy of GVHD.\n\nKazuyuki Shimada, Motoko Yamaguchi, Yoshiko Atsuta, Kosei Matsue, Keijiro Sato, Shigeru Kusumoto, Hirokazu Nagai, Jun Takizawa, Noriko Fukuhara, Koji Nagafuji, Kana Miyazaki, Eiichi Ohtsuka, Masataka Okamoto, Yasumasa Sugita, Toshiki Uchida, Satoshi Kayukawa, Atsushi Wake, Daisuke Ennishi, Yukio Kondo, Tohru Izumi, Yoshihiro Kin, Kunihiro Tsukasaki, Daigo Hashimoto, Masaaki Yuge, Atsumi Yanagisawa, Yachiyo Kuwatsuka, Satoko Shimada, Yasufumi Masaki, Nozomi Niitsu, Hitoshi Kiyoi, Ritsuro Suzuki, Takashi Tokunaga, Shigeo Nakamura, Tomohiro Kinoshita\n\nThe Lancet.

We aimed to ascertain the safety and activity of R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone) with high-dose methotrexate and intrathecal chemotherapy as CNS-oriented therapy for patients with previously untreated IVLBCL. METHODS: PRIMEUR-IVL is a multicentre, single-arm, phase 2 trial at 22 hospitals in Japan. Eligible patients had untreated histologically confirmed IVLBCL, were aged 20-79 years, had an Eastern Cooperative Group performance status of 0-3, and had no apparent CNS involvement at diagnosis. Patients received three cycles of R-CHOP (rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 [except cycle one, which was on day 8]; cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2, doxorubicin 50 mg/m2, and vincristine 1·4 mg/m2 [maximum 2·0 mg] intravenously on day 1 of cycle one and day 2 of cycles two and three; and prednisolone 100 mg/day orally on days 1-5 of cycle one and days 2-6 of cycles two and three) followed by two cycles of rituximab with high-dose methotrexate (3·5 g/m2 intravenously on day 2 of cycles four and five) every 2 weeks and three additional cycles of R-CHOP. Intrathecal chemotherapy (methotrexate 15 mg, cytarabine 40 mg, and prednisolone 10 mg) was administered four times during the R-CHOP phase. The primary endpoint was 2-year progression-free survival. Efficacy analyses were done in all enrolled patients; safety analyses were done in all enrolled and treated patients. The trial is registered in the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN000005707) and the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (jRCTs041180165); the trial is ongoing for long-term follow-up. FINDINGS: Between June 16, 2011, and July 21, 2016, 38 patients were enrolled, of whom 37 were eligible; one patient was excluded because of a history of testicular lymphoma. Median follow-up was 3·9 years (IQR 2·5-5·5). 2-year progression-free survival was 76% (95% CI 58-87). The most frequent adverse events of grade 3-4 were neutropenia and leucocytopenia, which were reported in all 38 (100%) patients. Serious adverse events were hypokalaemia, febrile neutropenia with hypotension, hypertension, and intracerebral haemorrhage (reported in one [3%] patient each). No treatment-related deaths occurred during protocol treatment. INTERPRETATION: R-CHOP combined with rituximab and high-dose methotrexate plus intrathecal chemotherapy is a safe and active treatment for patients with IVLBCL without apparent CNS involvement at diagnosis, and this regimen warrants future investigation.

However, PTCY alone is insufficient and requires additional immunosuppressants such as calcineurin inhibitors. In the current study, we evaluated effects of a novel GVHD prophylaxis with PTCY in combination with short-term KRP203, a selective agonist of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 that regulates egress of lymphocytes from the secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs) in mice. Short-term oral administration of KRP203 alone induced apoptosis of donor T cells in the SLOs and ameliorated GVHD. Administration of KRP203 significantly preserved graft-versus-leukemia effects compared to cyclosporin. A combination of KRP203 on days 0 to +4 and PTCY on day +3 synergistically suppressed donor T-cell migration into the intestine and skin, and ameliorated GVHD more potently than PTCY alone. A combination of short-term KRP203 and PTCY is a promising novel calcineurin-free GVHD prophylaxis in HLA-haploidentical SCT.\n\nSouichi Shiratori, Hiroyuki Ohigashi, Shuichiro Takahashi, Takahide Ara, Hideki Goto, Masao Nakagawa, Junichi Sugita, Masahiro Onozawa, Kaoru Kahata, Tomoyuki Endo, Daigo Hashimoto, Takanori Teshima\n\nAnnals of hematology 99 (3) 591 - 598 2020/03 [Refereed][Not invited]\n\nAlthough a combination of calcineurin inhibitor and methotrexate (MTX) is used for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis in umbilical cord blood transplantation (CBT), optimal dose of MTX for CBT remains to be determined.We conducted a retrospective study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of standard-dose MTX (St-MTX, 15 mg/m2 on day 1 and 10 mg/m2 on days 3 and 6) and mini-dose MTX (Mini-MTX, 5 mg/m2 on days 1, 3 and 6) for GVHD prophylaxis in patients who underwent single unit CBT against hematological malignancies.Thirty-two and 26 patients received St-MTX and Mini-MTX, respectively. Cumulative incidence of neutrophil engraftment was significantly higher in the Mini-MTX group than in the St-MTX group (88.5% vs 65.6%, P = 0.00448). Cumulative incidences of grade II to IV and grade III to IV of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) were 34.4% and 6.2% in the St-MTX group, and 34.6% and 7.7% in the Mini-MTX group with no statistical significance. One-year non-relapse mortality (NRM) was significantly lower in the Mini-MTX group compared to the St-MTX group (31.2% vs 3.8%, P = 0.00938), whereas relapse rate was not different between the groups. Multivariate analysis also indicated that Mini-MTX significantly improved engraftment (HR, 0.5359; 95% CI, 0.3082 to 0.9318; P = 0.0270) and reduced NRM (HR, 0.117; 95% CI, 0.0151 to 0.9067; P = 0.040).Our study suggests that GVHD prophylaxis using Mini-MTX in CBT is feasible and associated with improvement of engraftment and reduction in NRM.\n\nJonathan U Peled, Antonio L C Gomes, Sean M Devlin, Eric R Littmann, Ying Taur, Anthony D Sung, Daniela Weber, Daigo Hashimoto, Ann E Slingerland, John B Slingerland, Molly Maloy, Annelie G Clurman, Christoph K Stein-Thoeringer, Kate A Markey, Melissa D Docampo, Marina Burgos da Silva, Niloufer Khan, André Gessner, Julia A Messina, Kristi Romero, Meagan V Lew, Amy Bush, Lauren Bohannon, Daniel G Brereton, Emily Fontana, Luigi A Amoretti, Roberta J Wright, Gabriel K Armijo, Yusuke Shono, Míriam Sanchez-Escamilla, Nerea Castillo Flores, Ana Alarcon Tomas, Richard J Lin, Lucrecia Yáñez San Segundo, Gunjan L Shah, Christina Cho, Michael Scordo, Ioannis Politikos, Kasumi Hayasaka, Yuta Hasegawa, Boglarka Gyurkocza, Doris M Ponce, Juliet N Barker, Miguel-Angel Perales, Sergio A Giralt, Robert R Jenq, Takanori Teshima, Nelson J Chao, Ernst Holler, Joao B Xavier, Eric G Pamer, Marcel R M van den Brink\n\nThe New England journal of medicine 382 (9) 822 - 834 2020/02/27 [Refereed][Not invited]\n\nBACKGROUND: Relationships between microbiota composition and clinical outcomes after allogeneic hematopoietic-cell transplantation have been described in single-center studies. Geographic variations in the composition of human microbial communities and differences in clinical practices across institutions raise the question of whether these associations are generalizable. METHODS: The microbiota composition of fecal samples obtained from patients who were undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic-cell transplantation at four centers was profiled by means of 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. In an observational study, we examined associations between microbiota diversity and mortality using Cox proportional-hazards analysis. For stratification of the cohorts into higher- and lower-diversity groups, the median diversity value that was observed at the study center in New York was used. In the analysis of independent cohorts, the New York center was cohort 1, and three centers in Germany, Japan, and North Carolina composed cohort 2. Cohort 1 and subgroups within it were analyzed for additional outcomes, including transplantation-related death. RESULTS: We profiled 8767 fecal samples obtained from 1362 patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic-cell transplantation at the four centers. We observed patterns of microbiota disruption characterized by loss of diversity and domination by single taxa. Higher diversity of intestinal microbiota was associated with a lower risk of death in independent cohorts (cohort 1: 104 deaths among 354 patients in the higher-diversity group vs. 136 deaths among 350 patients in the lower-diversity group; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55 to 0.92; cohort 2: 18 deaths among 87 patients in the higher-diversity group vs. 35 deaths among 92 patients in the lower-diversity group; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.90). Subgroup analyses identified an association between lower intestinal diversity and higher risks of transplantation-related death and death attributable to graft-versus-host disease. Baseline samples obtained before transplantation already showed evidence of microbiome disruption, and lower diversity before transplantation was associated with poor survival. CONCLUSIONS: Patterns of microbiota disruption during allogeneic hematopoietic-cell transplantation were similar across transplantation centers and geographic locations; patterns were characterized by loss of diversity and domination by single taxa. Higher diversity of intestinal microbiota at the time of neutrophil engraftment was associated with lower mortality.

Recently, HLA-haploidentical stem cell transplantation with post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy-haplo HSCT) has been widely performed due to its safety and favorable immune recovery. However, graft rejection remains an obstacle to PTCy-haplo HSCT. Donor specific antibody (DSA) is considered to be a major factor of graft rejection of haplo HSCT. We herein present a case of graft rejection after PTCy haplo-HSCT due to DSA induced by pretransplant platelet transfusion after donor selection. The patient was dependent on platelet transfusion and had not received cytotoxic chemotherapy because he was diagnosed as myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm-unclassifiable. We retrospectively confirmed the level of DSA just before the first transplantation and found that it was dramatically elevated, which was enough to cause graft rejection. We successfully performed cord blood transplantation of the HLA that was not the target of DSA, as salvage transplantation without any desensitization. This case illustrates that we have to confirm the presence of DSA immediately before the haplo-HSCT, particularly in high risk patients who are dependent on platelet transfusion and have no cytotoxic chemotherapy before HSCT.\n\nDaigo Hashimoto\n\n[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology 61 (8) 959 - 964 2020 [Refereed][Not invited]\n\nGraft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a potentially life-threatening complication associated with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). Although prophylaxis and GVHD treatment using immunosuppressants are essential for a successful allo-SCT, profound immunosuppression could lead to an infection and/or the recurrence of malignant diseases. Recently, the concept of tissue tolerance has emerged. This concept has been identified as a means to suppress GVHD by relying on tissue-intrinsic mechanisms that are independent from those underlying immune tolerance. Thus, GVHD prophylaxis and treatments targeting the mechanisms that promote tissue tolerance could help suppress GVHD and maintain leukocyte-mediated immune responses against tumors and infectious pathogens. Epithelial regeneration from LGR5-positive intestinal stem cells and epithelial maintenance mediated by metabolites from the intestinal microbiota are representative mechanisms that promote tissue tolerance in the gut. However, these protective mechanisms are weakened by GVHD and conditioning regimens. This review focuses on the pathophysiology of acute GVHD and tissue-intrinsic mechanisms that promote tissue tolerance.\n\nSatomi Matsuoka, Daigo Hashimoto, Masanori Kadowaki, Hiroyuki Ohigashi, Eiko Hayase, Emi Yokoyama, Yuta Hasegawa, Takahiro Tateno, Xuanzhong Chen, Kazutoshi Aoyama, Hideyo Oka, Masahiro Onozawa, Kiyoshi Takeda, Koichi Akashi, Takanori Teshima\n\nHaematologica 105 (1) 226 - 234 2020/01 [Refereed][Not invited]\n\nMyeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) signaling has a crucial role in activation of both innate and adoptive immunity. MyD88 transduces signals via Toll-like receptor and interleukin-1 receptor superfamily to the NFκB pathway and inflammasome by forming a molecular complex with interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4. The MyD88/interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 pathway plays an important role, not only in innate immunity, but also T-cell immunity; however, its role in donor T cells on the pathophysiology of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) remains to be elucidated. We addressed this issue by using MyD88-deficient T cells in a mouse model of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). While MyD88-deficient and wild-type T cells proliferated equivalently after transplantation, MyD88-deficient T cells demonstrated impaired survival and differentiation toward Th1, Tc1, and Th17, and induced less severe GvHD compared to wild-type T cells. Administration of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 inhibitor PF-06650833 significantly ameliorated GvHD after allo-SCT. These results thus demonstrate that donor T-cell MyD88/interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 pathway is a novel therapeutic target against GvHD after allo-SCT.\n\nC K Stein-Thoeringer, K B Nichols, A Lazrak, M D Docampo, A E Slingerland, J B Slingerland, A G Clurman, G Armijo, A L C Gomes, Y Shono, A Staffas, M Burgos da Silva, S M Devlin, K A Markey, D Bajic, R Pinedo, A Tsakmaklis, E R Littmann, A Pastore, Y Taur, S Monette, M E Arcila, A J Pickard, M Maloy, R J Wright, L A Amoretti, E Fontana, D Pham, M A Jamal, D Weber, A D Sung, D Hashimoto, C Scheid, J B Xavier, J A Messina, K Romero, M Lew, A Bush, L Bohannon, K Hayasaka, Y Hasegawa, M J G T Vehreschild, J R Cross, D M Ponce, M A Perales, S A Giralt, R R Jenq, T Teshima, E Holler, N J Chao, E G Pamer, J U Peled, M R M van den Brink\n\nScience (New York, N.Y.) 366 (6469) 1143 - 1149 2019/11/29 [Refereed][Not invited]\n\nDisruption of intestinal microbial communities appears to underlie many human illnesses, but the mechanisms that promote this dysbiosis and its adverse consequences are poorly understood.

We found that Enterococcus also expands in the mouse gastrointestinal tract after allo-HCT and exacerbates disease severity in gnotobiotic models. Enterococcus growth is dependent on the disaccharide lactose, and dietary lactose depletion attenuates Enterococcus outgrowth and reduces the severity of GVHD in mice. Allo-HCT patients carrying lactose-nonabsorber genotypes showed compromised clearance of postantibiotic Enterococcus domination. We report lactose as a common nutrient that drives expansion of a commensal bacterium that exacerbates an intestinal and systemic inflammatory disease.\n\nKenichi Yamahara, Akiko Hamada, Toshihiro Soma, Rika Okamoto, Masaya Okada, Satoshi Yoshihara, Kyoko Yoshihara, Kazuhiro Ikegame, Hiroya Tamaki, Katsuji Kaida, Takayuki Inoue, Yuko Ohsugi, Hiroki Nishikawa, Hiroshi Hayashi, Yoichi M Ito, Hiroaki Iijima, Shunsuke Ohnishi, Daigo Hashimoto, Toshiyuki Isoe, Takanori Teshima, Hiroyasu Ogawa, Norihiro Sato, Yoshihiro Fujimori\n\nBMJ open 9 (7) e026403 2019/07/09 [Refereed][Not invited]\n\nINTRODUCTION: Regenerative medicine and cell therapies have been gaining much attention among clinicians. Therapeutic infusion of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) is now a leading investigational strategy for the treatment of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD). Bone marrow MSCs are approved for manufacture and marketing as a cell therapy for aGVHD. Our non-clinical studies confirmed that human amnion-derived MSCs had immunomodulatory activity equal to or higher than that of human bone marrow MSCs. This study will aim to evaluate the safety and efficacy of amnion-derived MSCs (AM01) in patients with steroid-refractory aGVHD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study will be a multicentre, single-arm, open-label trial (an interventional study). This clinical trial will begin with a low-dose group, and when safety has been confirmed in at least three cases in the low-dose group, treatment will begin for the high-dose group, for which the safety will also be verified. The primary endpoint is to assess the safety of intravenous infusion therapy of AM01 within 24 hours after intravenous infusion of AM01. The secondary endpoint is to explore the efficacy of intravenous infusion therapy with AM01. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The institutional review boards of all participating hospitals approved this study protocol (latest V3.3.0, 3 August 2018). Final data will be publicly announced. A report releasing the study results will be submitted for publication to an appropriate peer-reviewed journal.

High total metabolic tumor volume (TMTV) calculated using 18 F-FDG PET/CT images at diagnosis predicts poor prognosis of patients with DLBCL. However, high cost and poor access to the imaging facilities hamper wider use of 18 F-FDG PET/CT. In order to explore a surrogate marker for TMTV, we evaluated the correlation between the serum levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) and TMTV in 64 patients with DLBCL, and the results were verified in an independent validation cohort of 86 patients. Serum levels of sIL-2R were significantly correlated with TMTV. ROC analysis revealed that the cutoff value of TMTV ≥150 cm3 or sIL-2R ≥ 1300 U/mL could predict failure to achieve EFS24 with areas under the curve (AUC) 0.706 and 0.758, respectively. Each of TMTV ≥150 cm3 and sIL-2R ≥1300 U/mL was significantly associated with worse 5-year overall survival and event-free survival. Importantly, each of sIL-2R <1300 U/mL or TMTV <150 cm3 identified patients with favorable prognosis among NCCN-IPI high-intermediate and high-risk group. Serum level of sIL-2R represents a convenient surrogate marker to estimate metabolic tumor burden measured by 18 F-FDG PET/CT that can predict treatment outcomes of patients with DLBCL.\n\nKohei Okada, Tomoyuki Endo, Daigo Hashimoto, Tomoyuki Saga, Takahide Ara, Reiki Ogasawara, Atsushi Yasumoto, Makoto Ibata, Mutsumi Takahata, Akio Shigematsu, Takeshi Kondo, Yasunori Muraosa, Toshifumi Nomura, Hiromi Kanno-Okada, Satoshi Hashino, Shinya Tanaka, Katsuhiko Kamei, Takanori Teshima\n\nJournal of Infection and Chemotherapy 24 (8) 660 - 663 1437-7780 2018/08/01 [Refereed][Not invited]\n\nDisseminated fusariosis (DF) is a rare life threatening fungal infection in immunocompromised hosts.

The patient developed an ulcer following small painful vesicles mimics herpes simplex virus infection (HSV) on the glans penis before CBT, but a Fusarium species was identified. Despite administration of voriconazole, liposomal amphotericin B and granulocyte transfusion, the lesion was extended to extensive skin looked like VZV infection and the patients died after CBT. Massive fusarium infiltration was detected in multiple organs at autopsy. A genetic analysis of the mold identified Fusarium solani after his death.

The deletions are mediated by illegitimate variable(diversity)joining recombination via cryptic recombination signal sequences (RSSs). We developed a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probe set that can detect any type of IKZF1 deletion, including the commonly deleted exon 4 to 7 region. The probe set consists of a designed probe for the commonly deleted region (Cy3 red) and a bacterial artificial chromosomes clone probe for detecting the 3′ flanking region (Spectrum Green). Intact IKZF1 showed a fusion signal, and the deleted allele showed loss of the red signal (0R1G1F). The FISH probes worked correctly for human leukemic cell lines and clinical samples. One case showed an atypical break-apart signal (1R1G1F). Inverse PCR of the case revealed rearrangement of the excised IKZF1 fragment into a legitimate RSS site at Ig κ on chromosome 2, suggesting a pathogenic role of this recombination-activating gene 1/2-mediated event. In this study, we established FISH probe detecting IKZF1 deletion in a quick, quantitative, and cost-effective manner, and the results provided a novel insight into B-cell receptor editing by rearrangement of a cryptic RSS-mediated genomic fragment in acute lymphoblastic leukemia pathology.\n\nOgasawara R, Hashimoto D, Kimura S, Hayase E, Ara T, Takahashi S, Ohigashi H, Yoshioka K, Tateno T, Yokoyama E, Ebata K, Kondo T, Sugita J, Onozawa M, Iwanaga T, Teshima T\n\nScientific reports 8 (1) 10719 - 10719 2018/07 [Refereed][Not invited]\n\nThe R-Spondin (R-Spo) family regulates WNT signaling and stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of intestinal stem cells (ISCs). R-Spo plays a critical role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis, but endogenous producers of R-Spo in the intestine remain to be investigated. We found that R-Spo3 was the major R-Spo family member produced in the intestine and it was predominantly produced by CD45-CD90+CD31+ lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in the lamina propria of the intestinal mucosa. Transcriptome analysis demonstrated that LECs highly expressed R-Spo receptor, Lgr5, suggesting an autocrine stimulatory loop in LECs. LECs were significantly reduced in number, and their R-Spo3 production was impaired in intestinal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The impaired production of R-Spo3 in the intestine may be a novel mechanism of delayed tissue repair and defective mucosal defense in intestinal GVHD. We demonstrate a novel role of intestinal LECs in producing R-Spondin3 to maintain intestinal homeostasis.\n\nHidaka D, Hayase E, Shiratori S, Hasegawa Y, Ishio T, Tateno T, Okada K, Goto H, Sugita J, Onozawa M, Nakagawa M, Kahata K, Endo T, Hashimoto D, Teshima T\n\nClinical transplantation 32 (9) e13361 0902-0063 2018/07 [Refereed][Not invited]\n\nIntestinal microbiota plays an important role in the regulation of allogeneic immune reaction after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). Intestinal graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) is one of the major causes of mortality after allo-SCT and often complicated with intestinal dysbiosis. Recent studies suggest that antibiotic-induced dysbiosis is a risk factor for intestinal GVHD. We retrospectively evaluated the impacts of antibiotic use on the incidence of intestinal GVHD occurring before day 100 after allo-SCT. Among 213 patients who underwent allo-SCT, 200 patients achieving engraftment were analyzed. Antibiotics were classified into carbapenem, quinolone, penicillin, cephem, and glycopeptide. Among 128 patients who developed acute GVHD, intestinal GVHD developed in 36 patients. Patients with intestinal GVHD received significantly longer administration of carbapenem and glycopeptide compared to those without it in periengraftment period. In multivariate analysis, use of carbapenem for greater than 7 days was associated with an increased risk of intestinal GVHD. However, use of antibiotics for greater than 7 days was not associated with poor overall survival and high nonrelapse mortality. Long use of carbapenem in periengraftment period may be a risk for intestinal GVHD.

WT1 expression, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the WT1 gene (rs16754), and Fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor-3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) mutation were analyzed for all patients. The nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) mutation and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α (CEBPA) double mutation were analyzed for cytogenetically normal (CN)-AML. The KIT mutation was analyzed for core-binding factor AML. RESULTS: Within the cytogenetically favorable prognosis group, WT1 expression in AML with inv(16) or t(15;17) was significantly greater than that in AML with t(8;21). In cases with CN-AML, FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutations both correlated with greater expression of WT1, and the CEBPA double mutation was related to lower WT1 expression. The existence of both FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutations showed synergistically greater expression of WT1 in CN-AML. SNP in the WT1 gene (rs16754) was significantly associated with lower expression of WT1. The WT1 levels were not prognostic factors in the total cohort or any cytogenetic group or stratified by SNP status. CONCLUSION: Because WT1 expression has correlated with known prognostic factors, the prognostic effect of WT1 levels could be misunderstood depending on the distribution of the collaborative mutations in each cohort. We have concluded that the prognostic significance of WT1 at the diagnosis of AML is weak compared with the other established prognostic factors.\n\nShuichiro Takahashi, Daigo Hashimoto, Eiko Hayase, Reiki Ogasawara, Hiroyuki Ohigashi, Takahide Ara, Emi Yokoyama, Ko Ebata, Satomi Matsuoka, Geoffrey R.

Emerging evidence indicates that GVHD leads to injury of intestinal stem cells. However, it remains to be investigated whether skin stem cells could be targeted in skin GVHD. Lgr51 hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) contribute to folliculogenesis and have a multipotent capacity to regenerate all epithelial cells in repair. We studied the fate of Lgr51 HFSCs after SCT and explored the novel treatment to protect Lgr51 HFSCs against GVHD using murine models of SCT. We found that GVHD reduced Lgr51 HFSCs in association with impaired hair regeneration and wound healing in the skin after SCT. Topical corticosteroids, a standard of care for a wide range of skin disorders including GVHD, damaged HFSCs and failed to improve skin homeostasis, despite of their anti-inflammatory effects. In contrast, JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib significantly ameliorated skin GVHD, protected Lgr51 HFSCs, and restored hair regeneration and wound healing after SCT. We, for the first time, found that GVHD targets Lgr51 HFSCs and that topical ruxolitinib represents a novel strategy to protect skin stem cells and maintain skin homeostasis in GVHD.\n\nKana Matsuda, Shoko Ono, Marin Ishikawa, Shuichi Miyamoto, Satoshi Abiko, Momoko Tsuda, Keiko Yamamoto, Takahiko Kudo, Yuichi Shimizu, Eiko Hayase, Daigo Hashimoto, Takanori Teshima, Yoshihiro Matsuno, Naoya Sakamoto\n\nAnnals of Hematology 97 (5) 877 - 883 1432-0584 2018/05/01 [Refereed][Not invited]\n\nAlthough graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is the major complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation also occurs in patients after allo-HSCT and these conditions often clinically overlap. The aim of this study was to determine reliable endoscopic findings of CMV colitis in patients with gastrointestinal graft-versus-host-disease (GI-GVHD). Patients after allo-HSCT who were histologically confirmed to have GI-GVHD with or without CMV colitis and patients with an immunosuppressive condition were retrospectively analyzed. We divided the patients into three groups: GI-GVHD with CMV colitis (group A), GI-GVHD without CMV colitis (group B), and CMV colitis without undergoing allo-HSCT (group C). From medical records, the involved colorectal areas and endoscopic findings according to the groups were compared. A total of 70 patients were divided into three groups (group A: n = 19, group B: n = 28, group C: n = 23). Mucosal injuries in groups A and C frequently occurred in the cecum including ileocecal valves. On the other hand, there were no abnormal lesions on ileocecal valves in group B. Furthermore, ulcer lesions were more frequently observed in groups A and C than in group B (p &lt 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of mucosal injuries in the cecum for prediction of CMV colitis were 89.5 and 76.5%, respectively, and mucosal injuries in the cecum were more reliable findings than CMV antigenemia. Ulcer lesions in the cecum are reliable endoscopic findings for CMV colitis in patients with GI-GVHD after allo-HSCT.\n\nNaohiro Miyashita, Masahiro Onozawa, Koji Hayasaka, Takahiro Yamada, Ohsuke Migita, Kenichiro Hata, Kohei Okada, Hideki Goto, Masao Nakagawa, Daigo Hashimoto, Kaoru Kahata, Takeshi Kondo, Shinji Kunishima, Takanori Teshima\n\nAnnals of Hematology 97 (4) 629 - 640 1432-0584 2018/04/01 [Refereed][Not invited]\n\nWe identified a novel heterozygous ITGB3 p.T720del mutation in a pedigree with macrothrombocytopenia exhibiting aggregation dysfunction. Platelet aggregation induced by ADP and collagen was significantly reduced, while ristocetin aggregation was normal. Integrin αIIbβ3 was partially activated in a resting status, but platelet expression of αIIbβ3 was downregulated. Functional analysis using a cell line showed spontaneous phosphorylation of FAK in αIIb/β3 (p.T720del)-transfected 293T cells in suspension conditions. Abnormal cytoplasmic protrusions, membrane ruffling, and cytoplasmic localization of αIIbβ3 were observed in αIIb/β3 (p.T720del)-transfected CHO cells. Such morphological changes were reversed by treatment with an FAK inhibitor. These findings imply spontaneous, but partial, activation of αIIbβ3 followed by phosphorylation of FAK as the initial mechanism of abnormal thrombopoiesis. Internalization and decreased surface expression of αIIbβ3 would contribute to aggregation dysfunction. We reviewed the literature of congenital macrothrombocytopenia associated with heterozygous ITGA2B or ITGB3 mutations. Reported mutations were highly clustered at the membrane proximal region of αIIbβ3, which affected the critical interaction between αIIb R995 and β3 D723, resulting in a constitutionally active form of the αIIbβ3 complex. Macrothrombocytopenia caused by a heterozygous activating mutation of ITGA2B or ITGB3 at the membrane proximal region forms a distinct entity of rare congenital thrombocytopenia.\n\nTomohiro Yamakawa, Hiroyuki Ohigashi, Daigo Hashimoto, Eiko Hayase, Shuichiro Takahashi, Miyono Miyazaki, Kenjiro Minomi, Masahiro Onozawa, Yoshiro Niitsu, Takanori Teshima\n\nBlood 131 (13) 1476 - 1485 1528-0020 2018/03/29 [Refereed][Not invited]\n\nChronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is characterized by multiorgan fibrosis and profoundly affects the quality of life of transplant survivors. Heat shock protein 47 (HSP47), a collagen-specific molecular chaperone, plays a critical role in collagen synthesis in myofibroblasts. We explored the role of HSP47 in the fibrotic process of cutaneous chronic GVHD in mice. Immunohistochemical analysis showed massive fibrosis with elevated amounts of collagen deposits and accumulation of F4/801 macrophages, as well as myofibroblasts expressing HSP47 and retinol-binding protein 1 in the skin after allogeneic SCT. Repeated injection of anti–colony-stimulating factor (CSF-1) receptor-blocking antibodies significantly reduced HSP471 myofibroblasts in the skin, indicating a macrophage-dependent accumulation of myofibroblasts. Vitamin A-coupled liposomes carrying HSP47 small interfering RNA (siRNA) (VA-lip HSP47) delivered HSP47 siRNA to cells expressing vitamin A receptors and knocked down their HSP47 in vitro. Intravenously injected VA-lip HSP47 were specifically distributed to skin fibrotic lesions and did not affect collagen synthesis in healthy skin. VA-lip HSP47 knocked down HSP47 expression in myofibroblasts and significantly reduced collagen deposition without inducing systemic immunosuppression. It also abrogated fibrosis in the salivary glands. These results highlight a cascade of fibrosis in chronic GVHD macrophage production of transforming growth factor b mediates fibroblast differentiation to HSP471 myofibroblasts that produce collagen. VA-lip HSP47 represent a novel strategy to modulate fibrosis in chronic GVHD by targeting HSP471 myofibroblasts without inducing immunosuppression.\n\nUwatoko Takayo, Goto Ryoichi, Watanabe Chiaki, Akizawa Koji, Shimamura Tsuyoshi, Shimizu Chikara, Teshima Takanori, Hayase Eiko, Kahata Kaoru, Hashimoto Daigo, Ito Makoto, Uozumi Ryo, Hayashi Yasuhiro, Sugita Junichi, Koshizuka Yasuyuki\n\nJapanese Journal of Transfusion and Cell Therapy 一般社団法人 日本輸血・細胞治療学会 64 (5) 641 - 648 1881-3011 2018 [Not refereed][Not invited]\n\n<p><b>Background:</b> Liver transplantation is associated with massive bleeding and transfusion in recipients with coagulopathy.

In this study, we evaluated the risk factors of HHV-6 encephalitis/myelitis. Methods: We evaluated 253 patients who received allo-HSCT from 2007 to 2015 at our institute. HHV-6 encephalitis/myelitis was defined as HHV-6 DNA detection in the cerebrospinal fluid or peripheral blood by polymerase chain reaction in the presence of typical manifestations without other concurrent condition that led to the manifestations. Results: HHV-6 encephalitis/myelitis occurred in 11 patients (4.5%) (9 encephalitis, 3.7%; 2 myelitis, 0.8%). Multivariate analysis showed that CBT, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis, history of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), and engraftment syndrome (ES) were significantly associated with incidence of HHV-6 encephalitis/myelitis (P=.025, P=.017, P=.017, and P=.014, respectively).

Although pretransplant conditioning regimen has been appreciated as a cause of ovarian failure, increased application of reduced-intensity conditioning allowed us to revisit other factors possibly affecting ovarian function after allogeneic SCT. We have addressed whether donor T-cell-mediated graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) could be causally related to female infertility in mice. Histological evaluation of the ovaries after SCT demonstrated donor T-cell infiltration in close proximity to apoptotic granulosa cells in the ovarian follicles, resulting in impaired follicular hormone production and maturation of ovarian follicles. Mating experiments showed that female recipients of allogeneic SCT deliver significantly fewer newborns than recipients of syngeneic SCT. GVHD-mediated ovary insufficiency and infertility were independent of conditioning. Pharmacologic GVHD prophylaxis protected the ovary from GVHD and preserved fertility. These results demonstrate for the first time that GVHD targets the ovary and impairs ovarian function and fertility and has important clinical implications in young female transplant recipients with nonmalignant diseases, in whom minimally toxic regimens are used.

FIP1L1-PDGFRA is a leukemogenic fusion kinase that causes chronic eosinophilic leukemia. As a constitutively active kinase, FIP1L1-PDGFRA stimulates downstream signaling molecules, leading to cellular proliferation and the generation of an anti-apoptotic state. Contribution of the N-terminal FIP1L1 portion is necessary for FIP1L1-PDGFRA to exert its full transforming activity, but the underlying mechanisms have not been fully characterized. We identified PIAS1 as a FIP1L1-PDGFRA association molecule by yeast two-hybrid screening. Our analyses indicate that the FIP1L1 portion of FIP1L1-PDGFRA is required for efficient association with PIAS1. As a consequence of the association, FIP1L1-PDGFRA phosphorylates PIAS1. Moreover, the kinase activity of FIP1L1-PDGFRA stabilizes PIAS1. Therefore, PIAS1 is one of the downstream targets of FIP1L1-PDGFRA. Moreover, we found that PIAS1, as a SUMO E3 ligase, sumoylates and stabilizes FIP1L1-PDGFRA. In addition, suppression of PIAS1 activity by a knockdown experiment resulted in destabilization of FIP1L1-PDGFRA. Therefore, FIP1L1-PDGFRA and PIAS1 form a positive cross-talk through their enzymatic activities. Suppression of sumoylation by ginkgolic acid, a small molecule compound inhibiting a SUMO E1-activating enzyme, also destabilizes FIP1L1-PDGFRA, and while the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib suppresses FIP1L1-PDGFRA-dependent cell growth, ginkgolic acid or siRNA of PIAS1 has a synergistic effect with imatinib. In conclusion, our results suggest that sumoylation by PIAS1 is a potential target in the treatment of FIP1L1-PDGFRA-positive chronic eosinophilic leukemia.\n\nToshihiro Matsukawa, Daigo Hashimoto, Junichi Sugita, Seitarou Nakazawa, Takae Matsushita, Haruhiko Kashiwazaki, Hideki Goto, Masahiro Onozawa, Kaoru Kahata, Katsuya Fujimoto, Tomoyuki Endo, Takeshi Kondo, Satoshi Hashino, Yutaka Yamazaki, Takanori Teshima\n\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEMATOLOGY 104 (1) 117 - 124 0925-5710 2016/07 [Not refereed][Not invited]\n\nAllogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a curable treatment for hematological diseases. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) causes morbidity and mortality after HSCT. Methotrexate (MTX) is used for GVHD prophylaxis, but its appropriate dose remains unclear. In the present study, we compared the efficacy and toxicity of 15-10-10 MTX (day +1: 15 mg/m(2); days +3 and +6: 10 mg/m(2)) with 10-7-7 MTX (day +1: 10 mg/m(2); day +3 and +6: 7 mg/m(2)) in combination with tacrolimus. The cumulative incidence rates of grades II-IV acute GVHD, grades III-IV acute GVHD and chronic GVHD in the 15-10-10 MTX and 10-7-7 MTX groups did not differ to a statistically significant extent. The median time for neutrophil engraftment in the 15-10-10 MTX group was 16 days (range, 11-31 days), while that in the 10-7-7 group was 15 days (range, 12-19 days) (P = 0.024). Moreover, the median time for platelet recovery was significantly shorter in the 10-7-7 MTX group (22 days; range, 13-49 days) than that in the 15-10-10 MTX group (27 days; range, 9-405 days) (P = 0.027). The duration of oral mucositis was significantly shorter in the patients who received a reduced dose of MTX (median, 4.5 vs 13.0 days; P = 0.013). In conclusion, GVHD prophylaxis with a reduced dose of MTX was associated with earlier engraftment and earlier recovery from mucositis in comparison to a standard dose of MTX, without affecting the incidence of GVHD.\n\nJ.

Over the past few decades, classification of the cells of the MPS has generated considerable controversy. Recent studies into the origin, developmental requirements and function of MPS cells are beginning to solve this problem in an objective manner. Using high-resolution genetic analyses and fate-mapping studies, three main mononuclear phagocyte lineages have been defined, namely, macrophage populations established during embryogenesis, monocyte-derived cells that develop during adult life and DCs. These subsets and their diverse subsets have specialized functions that are largely conserved between species, justifying the introduction of a new, universal scheme of nomenclature and providing the framework for therapeutic manipulation of immune responses in the clinic. In this review, we have commented on the implications of this novel MPS classification in solid organ transplantation.

We explored whether modulation of intratumoral antigen-presenting cells (APCs) could increase responses to these therapies. Using mouse melanoma models, we found that CD103(+) dendritic cells (DCs) were the only APCs transporting intact antigens to the lymph nodes and priming tumor-specific CD8(+) T cells. CD103(+) DCs were required to promote anti-tumoral effects upon blockade of the checkpoint ligand PD-L1; however, PD-L1 inhibition only led to partial responses. Systemic administration of the growth factor FLT3L followed by intratumoral poly I:C injections expanded and activated CD103(+) DC progenitors in the tumor, enhancing responses to BRAF and PD-L1 blockade and protecting mice from tumor rechallenge. Thus, the paucity of activated CD103(+) DCs in tumors limits checkpoint-blockade efficacy and combined FLT3L and poly I:C therapy can enhance tumor responses to checkpoint and BRAF blockade.\n\nSouichi Shiratori, Katsuya Fujimoto, Machiko Nishimura, Kanako C.

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), particularly using a reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen, is a promising treatment for advanced-stage MF/SS. We performed RIC-HSCT in nine patients with advanced MF/SS. With a median follow-up period of 954days after HSCT, the estimated 3-year overall survival was 85.7% (95% confidence interval, 33.4-97.9%) with no non-relapse mortality. Five patients relapsed after RIC-HSCT; however, in four patients whose relapse was detected only from the skin, persistent complete response was achieved in one patient, and the disease was manageable in other three patients by the tapering of immunosuppressants and donor lymphocyte infusion, suggesting that graft-versus-lymphoma effect and down-staging' effect from advanced stage to early stage by HSCT improve the prognosis of advanced-stage MF/SS.

The patient was a 45-year-old male who was diagnosed with acute monoblastic leukemia (AMoL). Initial G-band analysis showed 51,XY,+6,+8,inv(9)(p12q13)c,+11,+13,+19[12]/52,idem,+Y[8], but G-band analysis after induction therapy showed 45,XY,-7,inv(9)(p12q13)c[19]/46,XY,inv(9)(p12q13)c[1]. Retrospective FISH analysis revealed a cryptic monosomy 7 clone in the initial AML sample. The clone with multiple trisomies was eliminated after induction therapy and never recurred, but a clone with monosomy 7 was still detected in myelodysplastic marrow with a normal blast percentage. Both clones were successfully eliminated after related peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, but the patient died of relapsed AML with monosomy 7. We concluded that one clone was de novo AMoL with chromosome 6, 8, 11, 13, and 19 trisomy and that the other was acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC) with chromosome 7 monosomy showing different responses to chemotherapy.

Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a major complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT). We previously demonstrated that Paneth cells are targeted by GVHD, and their expression of antimicrobial peptide -defensins is impaired, leading to a loss of physiological diversity among the microflora and development of bloodstream infection. Herein, we evaluated whether fecal levels of -defensins could be surrogate marker of intestinal dysbiosis. MethodsWe directly measured -defensin cryptdin-1 (Crp1) in fecal pellets of mice with GVHD by using a novel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. ResultsFecal levels of Crp1 were significantly decreased in mice with GVHD but unchanged in mice without GVHD after SCT. These were correlated with intestinal flora diversity. ConclusionWe demonstrate a link between reduced secretion of Paneth cell -defensins and dysbiosis of intestinal flora in GVHD.

Established B16 melanoma in mice was treated with cytotoxic doses of cyclophosphamide in combination with an antibody targeting tyrosinase-related protein 1 (alpha TRP1), a native melanoma differentiation antigen. We find that Fc gamma receptors are required for efficacy, showing that antitumor activity of combination therapy is immune mediated. Rag1(-/-) mice deficient in adaptive immunity are able to clear tumors, and thus innate immunity is sufficient for efficacy. Furthermore, previously treated wild-type mice are not significantly protected against tumor reinduction, as compared with mice inoculated with irradiated B16 alone, consistent with a primarily innate immune mechanism of action of chemo-immunotherapy. In contrast, mice deficient in both classical natural killer (NK) lymphocytes and nonclassical innate lymphocytes (ILC) due to deletion of the IL2 receptor common gamma chain IL2 gamma c(-/-)) are refractory to chemo-immunotherapy. Classical NK lymphocytes are not critical for treatment, as depletion of NK1.1(+) cells does not impair antitumor effect. Depletion of CD90(+)NK1.1(-) lymphocytes, however, both diminishes therapeutic benefit and decreases accumulation of macrophages within the tumor. Tumor clearance during combination chemo-immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies against native antigen is mediated by the innate immune system. We highlight a novel potential role for CD90(+)NK1.1(-) ILCs in chemo-immunotherapy.

Analyses of a series of deletion mutants revealed that the FIP1 motif in FIP1L1-RARA plays a pivotal role in its homodimerization and transcriptional repressor activity. However, in FIP1L1-PDGFRA, the C-terminal PDGFRA portion possesses the ability of forming a homodimer by itself, making FIP1L1 dispensable for constitutive activation of this kinase. Both the full-length and the C-terminal PDGFRA portion of FIP1L1-PDGFRA could transform the IL-3-dependent hematopoietic cell line, BAF-B03. Moreover, when either the full-length or the C-terminal PDGFRA portion of FIP1L1-PDGFRA was introduced in these cells, they grew in the absence of IL-3. The cells having the C-terminal PDGFRA portion of FIP1L1-PDGFRA, however, were partially IL-3 dependent, whereas the cells having the full-length FIP1L1-PDGFRA became completely IL-3 independent for their growth. Taken together, these results show that FIP1L1 differentially contributes to the pathogenesis of distinct types of leukemia.\n\nSouichi Shiratori, Kentaro Wakasa, Kohei Okada, Junichi Sugita, Koji Akizawa, Akio Shigematsu, Daigo Hashimoto, Katsuya Fujimoto, Tomoyuki Endo, Takeshi Kondo, Chikara Shimizu, Satoshi Hashino, Takanori Teshima\n\nCLINICAL TRANSPLANTATION 28 (6) 656 - 661 0902-0063 2014/06 [Refereed][Not invited]\n\nTo examine risk factors for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (S.maltophilia) infection during allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), we retrospectively analyzed 259 patients who underwent allo-HSCT.

We have previously reported the effect of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) on bone marrow (BM) in murine models, indicating that the osteoblast injury mediated by donor T cells was associated with bone marrow suppression and delayed immune reconstitution. In this study, we prospectively evaluated the relevance of these findings in 51 patients. Patients with chronic GVHD manifested the loss of osteoblasts, contributing to cytopenic symptoms (P =.0427 compared with patients without cytopenic symptoms). The loss of osteoblasts was significantly associated with the extensive type of chronic GVHD (P =.012), and flow cytometric analyses revealed lower numbers of CD19(+) B cells and a significantly increased CD4 to CD8 ratio (P.0002) in these patients. Our data, for the first time to our knowledge, summarize the detailed analyses of the effect of GVHD on BM in the clinical allo-HSCT patients.

Using a diverse range of mouse models with either defective dendritic cell ( DC) development or conditional DC depletion, we provide in vivo evidence indicating that conventional DCs play an important role in the regulation of neutrophil homeostasis. Flk2, Flt3L, and Batf3 knockout mice, which have defects in DC development, have increased numbers of liver neutrophils in the steady state. Conversely, neutrophil frequency is reduced in DC-specific PTEN knockout mice, which have an expansion of CD8(+) and CD103(+) DCs. In chimeric CD11c-DTR mice, conventional DC depletion results in a systemic increase of neutrophils in peripheral organs in the absence of histological inflammation or an increase in proinflammatory cytokines. This effect is also present in splenectomized chimeric CD11c-DTR mice and is absent in chimeric mice with 50% normal bone marrow. In chimeric CD11c-DTR mice, diphtheria toxin treatment results in enhanced neutrophil trafficking from the bone marrow into circulation and increased neutrophil recruitment. Moreover, there is an increased expression of chemokines/cytokines involved in neutrophil homeostasis and reduced neutrophil apoptosis. These data underscore the role of the DC pool in regulating the neutrophil compartment in nonlymphoid organs.\n\nGerold Bongers, Michelle E. Pacer, Thais H.

To test this hypothesis, we took advantage of transgenic mice that expressed HB- EGF throughout the intestine but developed SPs only in the cecum. Here we show that a hostspecific microbiome was associated with SPs and that alterations of the microbiota induced by antibiotic treatment or by embryo transfer rederivation markedly inhibited the formation of SPs in the cecum. Mechanistically, development of SPs was associated with a local decrease in epithelial barrier function, bacterial invasion, production of antimicrobials, and increased expression of several inflammatory factors such as IL-17, Cxcl2, Tnf-alpha, and IL-1. Increased numbers of neutrophils were found within the SPs, and their depletion significantly reduced polyp growth. Together these results indicate that nongenetic factors contribute to the development of SPs and suggest that the development of these intestinal neoplasms in the cecum is driven by the interplay between genetic changes in the host, an inflammatory response, and a host-specific microbiota.\n\nJudith Agudo, Albert Ruzo, Navpreet Tung, Helene Salmon, Marylene Leboeuf, Daigo Hashimoto, Christian Becker, Lee-Ann Garrett-Sinha, Alessia Baccarini, Miriam Merad, Brian D.

We found miR-126 was required for the innate response to pathogen-associated nucleic acids and that miR-126-deficient mice had greater susceptibility to infection with pseudotyped HIV. Profiling of miRNA indicated that miR-126 had high and specific expression by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). Moreover, miR-126 controlled the survival and function of pDCs and regulated the expression of genes encoding molecules involved in the innate response, including Tlr7, Tlr9 and Nfkb1, as well as Kdr, which encodes the growth factor receptor VEGFR2. Deletion of Kdr in DCs resulted in reduced production of type I interferon, which supports the proposal of a role for VEGFR2 in miR-126 regulation of pDCs. Our studies identify the miR-126 VEGFR2 axis as an important regulator of the innate response that operates through multiscale control of pDCs.\n\nM. Koyama, D. Hashimoto, K. Nagafuji, T. Eto, Y.

In a murine MHC-mismatched model of RIC-SCT, primary graft rejection was associated with activation and expansion of donor-reactive host T cells in peripheral blood and BM early after SCT. Donor-derived dendritic cells are at least partly involved in host T-cell activation. We then evaluated if such an expansion of host T cells could be associated with graft rejection after RIC-CBT. Expansion of residual host lymphocytes was observed in 4/7 patients with graft rejection at 3 weeks after CBT, but in none of the 17 patients who achieved engraftment. These results suggest the crucial role of residual host T cells after RIC-SCT in graft rejection and expansion of host T cells could be a marker of graft rejection. Development of more efficient T cell-suppressive conditioning regimens may be necessary in the context of RIC-SCT.\n\nAndrew Chow, Matthew Huggins, Jalal Ahmed, Daigo Hashimoto, Daniel Lucas, Yuya Kunisaki, Sandra Pinho, Marylene Leboeuf, Clara Noizat, Nico van Rooijen, Masato Tanaka, Zhizhuang Joe Zhao, Aviv Bergman, Miriam Merad, Paul S.

However, the in vivo role of macrophages in erythropoiesis under homeostatic conditions or in disease remains unclear. We found that specific depletion of CD169(+) macrophages markedly reduced the number of erythroblasts in the bone marrow but did not result in overt anemia under homeostatic conditions, probably because of concomitant alterations in red blood cell clearance. However, CD169(+) macrophage depletion significantly impaired erythropoietic recovery from hemolytic anemia, acute blood loss and myeloablation. Furthermore, macrophage depletion normalized the erythroid compartment in a JAK2(V617F)-driven mouse model of polycythemia vera, suggesting that erythropoiesis in polycythemia vera remains under the control of macrophages in the bone marrow and splenic microenvironments. These results indicate that CD169(+) macrophages promote late erythroid maturation and that modulation of the macrophage compartment may be a new strategy to treat erythropoietic disorders.\n\nDaigo Hashimoto, Andrew Chow, Clara Noizat, Pearline Teo, Mary Beth Beasley, Marylene Leboeuf, Christian D.

Using parabiosis and fate-mapping approaches, we confirmed that monocytes do not show significant contribution to tissue macrophages in the steady state. Similarly, we found that after depletion of lung macrophages, the majority of repopulation occurred by stochastic cellular proliferation in situ in a macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-Csf)- and granulocyte macrophage (GM)-CSF-dependent manner but independently of interleukin-4. We also found that after bone marrow transplantation, host macrophages retained the capacity to expand when the development of donor macrophages was compromised. Expansion of host macrophages was functional and prevented the development of alveolar proteinosis in mice transplanted with GM-Csf-receptor-deficient progenitors. Collectively, these results indicate that tissue-resident macrophages and circulating monocytes should be classified as mononuclear phagocyte lineages that are independently maintained in the steady state.\n\nJulie Helft, Balaji Manicassamy, Pierre Guermonprez, Daigo Hashimoto, Aymeric Silvin, Judith Agudo, Brian D.
