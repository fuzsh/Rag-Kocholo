In addition, work values in both Japan and the United States appear to be changing. More information is needed on the work values of American and Japanese female workers.

This study was conducted to explore generational differences in Japanese attitudes toward women's employment and to interpret those differences in terms of social change. Questionnaires were distributed to approximately 900 Japanese men and women.

However, New Zealand statistics show a high percentage of epidural use amongst Asian women. Entonox (a gas mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen) and pethidine are also available to women in New Zealand. This article investigates how Japanese women in New Zealand respond to the use of pharmacological pain relief in labour. The study was guided by two research questions: (1) How do Japanese women experience and manage labour pain in New Zealand? (2) How do they feel about the use of pharmacological pain relief? Thirteen Japanese women who had given birth in New Zealand were interviewed individually or in a focus group. The conversations were analysed using thematic analysis. Although in Japan very few women use pain relief, nine women received epidural and/or Entonox out of 11 women who experienced labour pain. The contrast between their Japanese cultural expectations and their birth experiences caused some of the women subsequent personal conflict. Japanese women's cultural perspectives and passive attitudes were demonstrated to influence the decision-making process concerning pain relief. It was concluded that understanding Japanese cultural worldviews and approaches to the role of pain in labour would help maternity providers in their provision of appropriate care for Japanese women.

Moreover, the average BMI of Japanese women is lower than that of Japanese men, and the age-specific BMI of Japanese women has decreased over time. The average BMI of Japanese women at age 25 decreased from 21.8 in 1948 to 20.4 in 2010 whereas that of men increased from 21.4 to 22.3 over the same period. We examine the long-term BMI trend in Japan by combining several historical data sources spanning eleven decades, from 1901 to 2012, to determine not only when but also how the BMI decline among women began: whether its inception was period-specific or cohort-specific. Our nonparametric regression analysis generated five findings. First, the BMI of Japanese women peaked with the 1930s birth cohort. This means that the trend is cohort-specific. Second, the BMI of men outpaced that of women in the next cohort. Third, the BMI of Japanese children, boys and girls alike, increased steadily throughout the 20th century. Fourth, the gender difference in the BMI trend is due to a gender difference in the weight trend, not the height trend. Fifth, these BMI trends are observed in urban and rural populations alike. We conclude that the BMI decline among Japanese women began with those who were in their late teens shortly after World War II. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Because help seeking for distress occurs within social networks, we examined how social networks supported or disabled help seeking for Japanese sojourners living in the US. Unfortunately, most of the literature about Japanese social relationships focuses on men in organizational settings. This study used intensive ethnographic interviewing with 49 Japanese expatriate women to examine how social relationships influenced psychosocial distress and help seeking. We found that the women in these samples engaged in complex, highly regulated, complicated and obligatory relationships through their primary affiliation with other âcompany wives.â Like many immigrant women, increased traditional cultural norms (referred to in Japanese as ryoosai kenbo, or good wives and wise mothers), were expected from these modern women, and the enactment of these roles was enforced through scrutiny, gossip and the possibility of ostracism. Fears of scrutiny was described by the women as a primary barrier to their self-disclosure and ultimate help seeking. Understanding the social organization and support within the Japanese women's community is central to understanding how culturally specific social networks can both give support, as well as create social constraints to help seeking. Health oriented prevention programs must consider these social factors when evaluating the immigration stressors faced by these families.

The PSQ translates DSM-IV criteria into a rating scale with degrees of severity. One thousand one hundred and eighty-seven Japanese women between the ages of 20 and 49 yrs, who were seen at a clinic for uterine cancer screening, were assessed regarding their premenstrual symptoms using the PSQ. As many as 95% of these women were found to suffer from premenstrual symptoms. The rates of prevalence of moderate to severe PMS and PMDD in Japanese women were 5.3 and 1.2%, respectively, which are lower than those in Western women. Only 5.3% of women with moderate to severe PMS and PMDD were treated. The results of this study suggest that race and ethnicity influence the expression of premenstrual symptoms and that the current state of medical care for Japanese women with moderate to severe PMS and PMDD is not satisfactory.\n\nBurden of Household Environmental Tobacco Smoke on Medical Expenditure for Japanese Women: A Population-Based Cohort Study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMorishima, Toshitaka; Imanaka, Yuichi; Otsubo, Tetsuya; Hayashida, Kenshi; Watanabe, Takashi; Tsuji, Ichiro\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBackground The economic consequences of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) have been simulated using models. We examined the individual-level association between ETS exposure and medical costs among Japanese nonsmoking women. Methods This population-based cohort study enrolled women aged 40 to 79 years living in a rural community. ETS exposure in homes at baseline was assessed with a self-administered questionnaire. We then collected health insurance claims data on direct medical expenditures from 1995 through 2007. Using generalized linear models with interaction between ETS exposure level and age stratum, average total monthly expenditure (inpatient plus outpatient care) per capita for nonsmoking women highly exposed and moderately exposed to ETS were compared with expenditures for unexposed women. We performed separate analyses for survivors and nonsurvivors. Results We analyzed data from 4870 women. After adjustment for potential confounding factors, survivors aged 70 to 79 who were highly exposed to ETS incurred higher expenditures than those who were not exposed. We found no significant difference in expenditures between moderately exposed and unexposed women. Total expenditures were not significantly associated with ETS exposure among survivors aged 40 to 69 or nonsurvivors of any age stratum. Conclusions We calculated individual-level excess medical expenditures attributable to household exposure to ETS among surviving older women. The findings provide direct evidence of the economic burden of ETS, which is helpful for policymakers who seek to achieve the economically attractive goal of eliminating ETS.

Immigration can cause shifts in interpersonal structures with partners. When there are large discrepancies in gender roles and communication styles between the original and host cultures, the psychological impact on both partners may be significant. However, currently no empirical data are available to support this assumption. Ten cases selected from the 68 medical records of Japanese-speaking women seen at a mental health clinic from September 2001 to September 2004 were analysed. All of the 10 women met DSM IV-TR criteria of major depressive disorder and were taking antidepressants. Half of the 10 women were in intimate intercultural partnered relationships and the remainder of the matched cases were in intracultural relationships at the time of treatment. The two cohorts were matched in age (36.2 and 43.2 years), length of stay in the United States of America (12 and 16.2 years), and length of treatment (1.2 and 1 years). The length of time of the sample in individual psychodynamic psychotherapy ranged from 20 to 317 hours, depending on the intensity of therapy. Inductive data analysis revealed two themes: (1) Lack of awareness of differences in culturally bound communication by Japanese women in intercultural partnerships; (2) Lack of individuality in Japanese women in intracultural partnerships. Neither group appeared to consider relational aspects of partnership, or to make efforts to improve direct communication with their partners. The influence of Japanese culture on gender role and communication styles functions contrary to the mainstream Western culture of the United States of America. In the future, interpersonal elements of cultural differences between host and original cultures in immigration should be considered in\n\nWomen among First Authors in Japanese Cardiovascular Journal.\n\nPubMed\n\nFujii, Tomoko; Matsuyama, Tasuku; Takeuchi, Jiro; Hara, Masahiko; Kitamura, Tetsuhisa; Yamauchi-Takihara, Keiko\n\n2018-03-30\n\nThe representation of women in Japanese academic medicine is not evident. We aimed to assess trends related to the proportion of female first authors in Japanese cardiovascular journals.We reviewed original research articles in 6 journals published in English by Japanese societies between 2006 and 2015 related to cardiovascular fields. We conducted a multivariable logistic regression analysis to assess the factors associated with the gender of first authors and plotted the trend of predicted probability for female first authors over the study period. Of 7,005 original articles, 1,330 (19.0%) had female first authors. Affiliations located in Japan (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71-0.81), concurrent first and corresponding authors (aOR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.64-0.74), and the total number of listed authors (aOR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95-0.99) were negatively associated with female first authors. The adjusted probability of a female first author increased from 13% to 20% on an average between 2006 and 2009, but the increase reached a plateau after 2010.Female first authors of original research articles published in Japanese cardiovascular journals increased over the examined decade. However, the representation of women is still low and has plateaued in recent years. A gender gap in authorship for Japanese cardiovascular journals remains.\n\nVocational Aspirations and Japanese Women: The Case of a Junior College\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nInoue, Yukiko\n\n2005-01-01\n\nWith the end of high growth in the Japanese economy, the women of Japan face a new challenge. Many of them have to be breadwinners as well as homemakers. The purpose of this study was to analyze and to synthesize the life course plans of contemporary Japanese women from essays written by junior college students. A typical woman of this sampleâ¦\n\nA Comparison of Japanese and American Housewives' Attitudes toward Employment of Women.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nEngel, John W.\n\nThis study describes the attitudes of Japanese housewives toward women's employment, and compares them with those of American housewives.

Their histopathological features have been reported as large numbers of melanocytes at the base of clubbed and budding rete ridges. In this study, biopsies were taken from facial solar lentigines in 40 Japanese women, and the sections were stained using hematoxylin-eosin, Fontana-Masson, and immunostained for melanocytes and Langerhans cells in order to verify the histological patterns of Japanese patients. We characterized the histopathological features of solar lentigines on the face and identified two patterns: one pattern (20/40 cases) demonstrated a flattened epidermis with basal melanosis, and the other pattern (20/40 cases) showed epidermal hyperplasia with elongated rete ridges composed of deeply pigmented basaloid cells. We termed the former pattern the \"flattened epidermis\" group, and the latter the \"budding\" group, respectively. The flattened epidermis group showed a significantly thinner epidermis, more severe solar elastosis and fewer Langerhans cells in the epidermis as compared with the budding group. We concluded that more severely sun-damaged solar lentigines might show the changes observed in the flattened epidermis group. Langerhans cells in the epidermis of solar lentigines might play a role in the remission of postinflammatory pigmentation due to aesthetic treatment.

Subjects and Methods A cross-sectional study. We compared neuromuscular risk factors for falls using performance-based measures (chair stand time, usual and rapid walking speed, and grip strength) among 163 Japanese women in Japan, 681 Japanese-American women in Hawaii and 9403 Caucasian women in the United States aged 65 years and over. Results After adjusting for age, the Caucasian women required about 40% more time to complete 5 chair stands than either group of Japanese. Walking speed was about 10% slower among Caucasians than native Japanese, whereas Japanese-American women in Hawaii walked about 11% faster than native Japanese. Grip strength was greatest in Japan, which may reflect the rural farming district that this sample was drawn from. Additional adjustment for height, weight or body mass index increased the adjusted means of chair stand time and grip strength among Japanese, but the differences remained significant. Conclusions Both native Japanese and Japanese-American women in Hawaii performed better than Caucasians on chair stand time and walking speed tests, and native Japanese had greater grip strength than Japanese in Hawaii and Caucasians. The biological implications of these differences in performance are uncertain, but may be useful in planning future comparisons between populations.

High percentages of Japanese women reported mental symptoms, while relatively high percentages of Filipino women also experienced motor neurological symptoms in addition to psychoneurological symptoms. Japanese and Filipino women were found to have different stressors: a high percentage of the Japanese women had problems involving human relationships, such as providing nursing care, while a high percentage of the Filipino women had household problems, including husband's health and financial problems. Stress severity was associated with SMI scores in both countries. A poorer marital relationship in Japan than in the Philippines and an association between marital relationship and SMI scores were found. The present study suggests the association of differences in psychological/social factors between Japanese and Filipino women with differences in menopausal symptoms.\n\nJapanese women's perceptions of intimate partner violence (IPV).\n\nPubMed\n\nNagae, Miyoko; Dancy, Barbara L\n\n2010-04-01\n\nIntimate partner violence (IPV) is a problem in Japan. The purpose is to describe IPV as perceived by a purposive sample of 11 Japanese adult females who were in a heterosexual marriage at the time of IPV. We used a cross-sectional, retroactive, qualitative description research design with individual, fact-to-face in depth interviews. At the time of the interview, the women had a mean age of 38 years and at the time of the IPV, a mean age of 28 years. Data were analyzed using the directed qualitative content analysis method. The results revealed that all women experienced physical and emotional abuse and 82% experienced sexual abuse. Communication between spouses was characterized as unilateral, with husbands initiating and dominating the conversation. The women identified the culture of the Japanese patriarchal system as directly influencing IPV. The implication is health professionals should actively advocate for effective legislation and policies to address IPV.\n\nGender-related stress among Japanese working women.\n\nPubMed\n\nOgiwara, Chikako; Tsuda, Hitoshi; Akiyama, Tsuyoshi; Sakai, Yoshie\n\n2008-09-01\n\nThis article addresses gender-related stresses of working women in Japan. We conducted a study of 399 employees in Japan using the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health General Job Stress questionnaire. The results suggest that for women the most significant factor related to depression is interpersonal conflict, whereas for men, it is professional matters. In addition, we conducted interviews with Japanese female employees about their occupational stress. Our interviews indicated that for the occupational mental health of working women, the establishment of modified and supportive interpersonal relations within workplace environments may be required because of the gender roles expected of women in a male-dominant socioculture.\n\nPharmacokinetics of drospirenone and ethinylestradiol in Caucasian and Japanese women.\n\nPubMed\n\nBlode, Hartmut; Kowal, Kristin; Roth, Katrin; Reif, Stefanie\n\n2012-08-01\n\nTo investigate the pharmacokinetics of drospirenone (DRSP) and ethinylestradiol (EE) in Caucasian and Japanese women. Three open-label, non-randomised studies were performed to assess the pharmacokinetics following single doses of EE 0.02 mg/DRSP 3 mg or DRSP monotherapy (1, 3 or 6 mg) in Caucasian (Study 1) and Japanese (Study 2) women, and daily doses with EE 0.02 mg/DRSP 3 mg over 21 consecutive days in Caucasian and Japanese women (Study 3). In Studies 1 and 2, there was a linear dose-dependent increase in DRSP C(max) and systemic exposure across the range of doses used in both ethnic groups. The co- administration of EE had no relevant effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of 3 mg DRSP. In Study 3, steady-state DRSP concentrations were achieved after about eight days of treatment in both ethnic groups with approximately a threefold accumulation. There was about a twofold EE accumulation over 21 days in both ethnic groups. There were no differences in DRSP or EE exposure at day 21 between ethnic groups; the ratio of the geometric means (Japanese/Caucasian) of the AUC(0-24h) were 1.05 (90% CI: 0.95-1.17) and 1.02 (90% CI: 0.76-1.38), respectively. Ethnic origin had no clinically relevant influence on the pharmacokinetics of DRSP and EE.\n\nPharmacokinetics of drospirenone and ethinylestradiol in Caucasian and Japanese women\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBlode, Hartmut; Kowal, Kristin; Roth, Katrin; Reif, Stefanie\n\n2012-01-01\n\nObjective To investigate the pharmacokinetics of drospirenone (DRSP) and ethinylestradiol (EE) in Caucasian and Japanese women.

This randomized, cross-sectional study allowed for a focus on ethnic differences in symptom reporting. The results presented here focus on hot flash and night sweat experience among Japanese-American and European-American women. Survey packets were mailed to street addresses associated with parcel numbers pulled randomly from Hilo tax maps. Of the 6,401 survey packets delivered to households, 1,824 questionnaires were completed and returned. The results reported here are based on 869 women aged 40 to 60, of whom 249 described themselves to be 100% Japanese and 203 described themselves to be 100% European-American. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine whether the relationship between ethnicity and vasomotor symptoms persisted after controlling for other variables. European-American participants were more likely to have ever experienced a hot flash as compared with Japanese-American participants (72% vs 53%, P<0.01). During the 2 weeks before the survey, European-American participants were more likely to have experienced hot flashes (P<0.05) and night sweats (P<0.01). In logistic regression analyses, after controlling for age, body mass index, menopause status, level of education, financial comfort, smoking habits, alcohol intake, exercise, use of hormone therapy, and soy intake, European-American women were still significantly more likely to have experienced hot flashes (odds ratio=1.858) and night sweats (odds ratio=2.672). The results, based on self-reporting of menopausal symptoms, indicate that Japanese-American women report fewer hot flashes and night sweats than European-American women. Japanese-American women reported a higher intake of soy, but soy intake was not associated with fewer vasomotor symptoms.\n\nAutobiographical memory functions in young Japanese men and women.\n\nPubMed\n\nMaki, Yoichi; Kawasaki, Yayoi; Demiray, Burcu; Janssen, Steve M J\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe present study examined whether the three major functions of autobiographical memory observed in Western societies (i.e., directing-behaviour, social-bonding and self-continuity) also exist in an East Asian society. Two self-report measures were used to assess the autobiographical memory functions of Japanese men and women. Japanese young adults (N = 451, ages 17-28 years) first completed the original Thinking About Life Experiences (TALE) Questionnaire. They subsequently received three TALE items that represented memory functions and attempted to recall a specific instance of memory recall for each item. Confirmatory factor analyses on the TALE showed that the three functions were replicated in the current sample. However, Japanese participants reported lower levels of all three functions than American participants in a previous study. We also explored whether there was an effect of gender in this Japanese sample. Women reported higher levels of the self-continuity and social-bonding functions than men. Finally, participants recalled more specific instances of memory recall for the TALE items that had received higher ratings on the TALE, suggesting that the findings on the first measure were supported by the second measure. Results are discussed in relation to the functional approach to autobiographical memory in a cross-cultural context.\n\nFactors Influencing Japanese Women to Choose Two-Year Colleges\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nAnzai, Shinobu\n\n2009-01-01\n\nTwo-year colleges in Japan have traditionally absorbed the major portion of female college entrants due at least partially to long-held gender stereotypes: women are to prepare themselves for marriage and homemaking at a two-year college. Recently, Japanese women began to explore selfhood outside the traditional realm of motherhood and womanhood.â¦\n\nWomen and the Japanese American Camp Experience: Transforming the Women's Studies Curriculum.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nHale, Sondra\n\n1993-01-01\n\nDiscusses integrating information on the Japanese-American internment experience of World War II into the women's studies curriculum at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA).

Additional purposes were to identify the associated factors of IPV, describe the characteristics of IPV against NJW, and assess the acceptability of the Violence Against Women Screen (VAWS) instrument as a screening tool. A cross-sectional survey was conducted from September to November 2007 in an urban hospital maternity clinic in Tokyo, Japan. Women who attended the maternity clinic received the VAWS instrument, which was translated into four languages (Japanese with Kanji and Hiragana, English, Chinese, and Tagalog) and was used to identify IPV. A total of 400 women participated in the study: 357 were JW and 43 were NJW. The prevalence rate of IPV among the JW was 31.4% and 21.4% among the NJW. There was no statistical significance between the two groups. A multiple logistic regression with adjusted odds ratio identified two associated factors for IPV: being multipara and previous experience of physical violence from a partner. The prevalence of IPV was not statistically different among JW and NJW. Screening for IPV, early intervention, and support should be expanded in hospitals and maternity clinics in Japan.\n\nFloating on Air: Fulfillment and Self-in-Context for Distressed Japanese Women\n\nPubMed Central\n\nArnault, Denise Saint; Shimabukuro, Shizuka\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThis research was part of a larger mixed-methods study examining culture, distress, and help seeking. We surveyed 209 Japanese women living in the United States recruited from clinic and community-based sites, and carried out semi-structured ethnographic interviews with a highly distressed subsample of 25 Japanese. Analytic Ethnography revealed that women described themselves as a âself-in-context,â negotiating situations using protective resources or experiencing risk exposure. Women experienced quality of life (QOL) when they were successful. However, a related goal of achieving Ikigai (or purpose in life) was differentiated from QOL, and was defined as an ongoing process of searching for balance between achieving social and individual fulfillment. Our resulting hypothetical model suggested that symptom level would be related to risk and protective factors (tested for the full sample) and to specific risk and protective phenomenon (tested in the distressed subsample). The t tests in the full sample found that women who were above threshold for depressive symptoms (n = 26) had higher social stressor and lower social support means. Women who were above the threshold for physical symptoms (n = 99) had higher social stressor means. Analysis of the interviewed subsample found that low self-validation and excessive responsibilities were related to high physical symptoms. We conclude that perceived lack of balance between culturally defined, and potentially opposing, markers of success can create a stressful dilemma for first-generation immigrant Japanese women, requiring new skills to achieve balance. Perceptions of health, as well as illness, are part of complex culturally based interpretations that have implications for intervention for immigrant Japanese women living in the United States.

In the present study, we cross-sectionally examined whether adherence to the food-based Japanese dietary guidelines is associated with metabolic risk factors in 1083 Japanese women aged 18-22 years. Based on the Japanese Food Guide Spinning Top, adherence to the food-based Japanese dietary guidelines was assessed using dietary information on consumed servings of grain dishes, vegetable dishes, fish and meat dishes, milk and fruits and energy from snacks and alcoholic beverages during the preceding month, which was derived from a comprehensive diet history questionnaire. Higher dietary adherence was associated with higher intakes of protein, carbohydrate, dietary fibre, Na, K and vitamin C, and lower intakes of total and saturated fat. There was also an inverse association between dietary adherence and dietary energy density. After adjustment for potential confounding factors, dietary adherence was inversely associated with waist circumference (P for trend = 0Â·002). It also showed an inverse association with LDL-cholesterol concentrations (P for trend = 0Â·04). There was no association with the other metabolic risk factors examined, including BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total and HDL-cholesterol, TAG, glucose, glycated Hb and insulin concentrations. In conclusion, higher adherence to the food-based Japanese dietary guidelines, which was characterised by favourable dietary intakes of foods and nutrients as well as lower energy density, was associated with lower waist circumference and LDL-cholesterol concentrations in this group of young Japanese women.\n\nFactors influencing behavioral intention to undergo Papanicolaou testing in early adulthood: Comparison of Japanese and Korean women.\n\nPubMed\n\nKang, Kyung-Ah; Kim, Shin-Jeong; Kaneko, Noriyo\n\n2017-12-01\n\nIn this study, we identified the factors influencing behavioral intention to undergo Papanicolaou testing among Japanese and Korean women in early adulthood. Their behavioral intentions were compared in this cross-sectional descriptive study. In total, 887 women (JapaneseÂ =Â 498, KoreanÂ =Â 389) aged 20-39Â years participated in this study. Using a self-report questionnaire, knowledge, attitudes, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and behavioral intention were surveyed. There were significant differences between Japanese and Korean women's scores on all main variables. For Japanese women, all the variables moderately correlated with behavioral intention. In comparison, for Korean women, all independent variables, except for knowledge, moderately correlated with behavioral intention. Through a multiple regression analysis, age, undergoing Papanicolaou testing, attitudes, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control were identified as significant predictors of behavioral intention among Japanese women. Among Korean women, job status, undergoing a Papanicolaou test, attitudes, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control were demonstrated as significant predictors of behavioral intention. Health professionals should consider these factors to encourage Papanicolaou testing in women in early adulthood.

These data were compared with unpublished data from Japanese women obtained in previous studies in Hamamatsu, Japan. The age-adjusted BMD for the spinal level, femoral neck, Ward's triangle, trochanter, and total body, respectively, of U.S.-born Japanese-American women were 10.2, 9.8, 9.9, 9.2, and 2.7% higher than those of native Japanese women. The U.S.-born Japanese-American women had significantly higher body fat than immigrant Japanese-American women. Furthermore, the immigrant women had higher BMD and higher body fat than their native Japanese counterparts; however, no significant total-body BMD differences were found among the three groups after age, height, and weight were adjusted. The U.S.-born Japanese-American women had BMD values equivalent to those of white normals at the spine and femur. Significant life-style differences between U.S.-born and immigrant Japanese-American women were noted. Weight, exercise, early menarche, and years of lifetime estrogen exposure correlated positively with BMD. The significant negative correlates of BMD were age, smoking, and percentage of body fat. Our study presents data suggesting that immigration to the United States has produced a higher BMD in Japanese-American women that is attributable to changes in life-style and diet.\n\nGrowth inhibition in Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) fish exposed to tetrachloroethylene.\n\nPubMed\n\nSpencer, Hattie B; Hussein, Wedad R; Tchounwou, Paul B\n\n2006-01-01\n\nA recent study in our laboratory has demonstrated that tetrachloroethylene (TCE) is acutely toxic to Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) larvae with a 96 hr-LC50 of 18 (17-19) mg/mL (Spencer et al., 2002). In the present study we hypothesize that TCE exposure induces a developmental effect in Japanese medaka. Growth and age specific sensitivity of Japanese medaka larvae were studied with four age groups (7, 14, 21 and 28 days old) to determine tetrachloroethylene effects on these parameters. The medaka larvae were exposed for 96 hours in a single concentration (10 mg/mL) of TCE. The toxic endpoints evaluated were larvae weight, length, water content and protein concentration. The study revealed that exposure of medaka larvae to this sub-acute concentration of TCE significantly reduced length and weight in the treated group. The difference in growth between control and treated groups was more obvious in age versus length, than in age versus weight. The dry weight-fresh weight ratio (dw/fw) was shown to be higher in the control group. Water content in TCE-treated medaka was higher than in the control group, and younger fry had more water content than older ones. A higher protein concentration was also observed in TCE-treated medaka compared to the control group. These results indicate that TCE has a profound effect on the growth and development of Japanese medaka larvae.\n\nThe current and future contraceptive needs of Japanese women.\n\nPubMed\n\nKobayashi, T\n\n1989-01-01\n\nBetween 1945-1948, the population of Japan increased by 5 million people. Further, between 1947-1950, 2.7 million recorded births occurred each year resulting in the population growing from 72-83.2 million. The crude birth rate fell from a high of 34.3 in 1947 to a low of 11.1 in 1986. The population is expected to increase from 117-130 million (1090-2010) and then fall to and stabilize at 118 over 70 years. 80% of married women in Japan want to have 2-3 children. In 1984, 59% of married women used a family planning method and 83.1% ever used such a method. In 1979, the condom was the leading contraceptive among married couples (82%) followed by the rhythm method (23%). Since 1948 japanese women have been able to obtain a legal abortion. 600,000 induced abortions occur annually in Japan today. Even though the number of abortion have fallen steadily from 1955, the percentage of abortions among teenagers has increased from 1.6-4.7% between 1975-1985. Japanese would like to reverse this trend and the expected approval of oral contraceptives (OCs) could help do so. In 1979, only 3% of married couples depended on OCs. A concern of OCs many people worldwide held for many years was the cardiovascular risk of the high dose OCs. In Japan, however, the rate of thrombosis is lower than it is among Europeans and Americans. Thus Japanese women appear to be suitable candidates for Ocs, but, in 1986, 52% of married women had not formed an opinion on the pending approval of OCs. Further 43% said they would not use an OC. These results indicated a great need for OC education as well as for education on all contraception. Since 99% of all births occur under the guidance of skilled health workers, the health workers could inform women about contraceptives, but often are too busy to do so.\n\nAlexithymia and Grief Reactions in Bereaved Japanese Women\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nNakao, Mutsuhiro; Kashiwagi, Masayo; Yano, Eiji\n\n2005-01-01\n\nTo examine the relationship between grief reactions and alexithymia, 54 Japanese women (33 outpatients attending a psychosomatic clinic and 21 normal healthy participants) completed the Texas Inventory of Grief (TIG), the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), and the Profile of Mood States (POMS).

The present study examined the associations between urinary cadmium levels and circulating sex hormone levels that are linked to breast cancer risk in healthy women. Methods: The study subjects were 396 premenopausal Japanese women who had regular menstrual cycles less than 40 days long and 207 postmenopausal Japanese women. Urinary cadmium was measured using spot urine samples. Plasma estradiol, testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were measured. Additionally, the follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and sex hormone-binding globulin were measured for premenopausal women. Results: In premenopausal women, the urinarymoreÂ Â» cadmium level either expressed in Î¼g per liter or per g of urine creatinine was significantly inversely associated with total and free testosterone levels after controlling for age, body mass index, smoking status, alcohol intake, and the phase of the menstrual cycle. Total and free testosterone levels were 14.6% and 15.0% lower, respectively, in women in the highest quartile of urinary cadmium per g creatinine in those in the lowest quartile. In postmenopausal women, the urinary cadmium in Î¼g per liter as well as per g creatinine was significantly inversely associated with the estradiol level after controlling for covariates. The estradiol level was 25.8% lower in women in the highest tertile of urinary cadmium per g creatinine than in those in the lowest tertile. Conclusions: The data suggest inverse associations between urinary cadmium and the plasma estradiol or testosterone level in Japanese women. - Highlights: â¢ Exposure to cadmium has been suspected as a risk factor for breast cancer. â¢ Urinary cadmium and plasma sex-hormone levels were measured in Japanese women. â¢ Urinary cadmium was inversely associated with testosterone in premenopausal women. â¢ Urinary cadmium was inversely associated with estradiol in\n\nInterleukin-10 -1082 gene polymorphism and susceptibility to cervical cancer among Japanese women.\n\nPubMed\n\nMatsumoto, Koji; Oki, Akinori; Satoh, Toyomi; Okada, Satoshi; Minaguchi, Takeo; Onuki, Mamiko; Ochi, Hiroyuki; Nakao, Sari; Sakurai, Manabu; Abe, Azusa; Hamada, Hiromi; Yoshikawa, Hiroyuki\n\n2010-11-01\n\nPolymorphisms in cytokine genes can influence immune responses to human papillomavirus infection, possibly modifying risks of cervical cancer. Using an amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction method, we analyzed a single nucleotide polymorphism (A/G) at position -1082 in interleukin-10 promoter region in 440 Japanese women: 173 women with normal cytology, 163 women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and 104 women with invasive cervical cancer. The carrier frequency of interleukin-10 -1082 G alleles associated with higher interleukin-10 production increased with disease severity: 9.8% for normal cytology; 19.6% for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia; 29.8% for invasive cervical cancer (P for trend < 0.001). Among cytologically normal women, human papillomavirus infections were more common in those who were positive for an interleukin-10 -1082 G allele (P = 0.04). In conclusion, our data suggest that interleukin-10 -1082 gene polymorphism may serve as a marker of genetic susceptibility to cervical cancer among Japanese women.\n\nIncreased depression and anxiety in infertile Japanese women resulting from lack of husband's support and feelings of stress.\n\nPubMed\n\nMatsubayashi, Hidehiko; Hosaka, Takashi; Izumi, Shun-ichiro; Suzuki, Takahiro; Kondo, Akane; Makino, Tsunehisa\n\n2004-01-01\n\nWe report that infertile women in Japan as well as in the Western world have high levels of emotional distress, anxiety, and depression. The reasons for anxiety and depression in infertile women are easy to presume but remain unclear. We conducted the present study to assess the relationship between the anxiety and depression of infertile Japanese women and their thought processes and emotional well-being with regard to their infertility. A cross-sectional questionnaire was administered to 101 infertile Japanese women who visited the infertility clinic at Tokai University. Inventories included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and our original infertility questionnaire, which is composed of 22 questions to assess attitudes and emotional status in facing the stigma of infertility. After factor analysis, comparison between the HADS and the infertility questionnaire was made with simultaneous multiple regression analyses. Anxiety and depression in childless Japanese women were significantly associated with lack of husband's support and feeling stress. Our findings should prove useful in designing and implementing psychological support programs for infertile Japanese women. Psychological interventions to relieve or diminish these conditions might have significant therapeutic benefits for women attending infertility clinics in Japan.\n\nBone mass and lifestyle related factors: a comparative study between Japanese and Inner Mongolian young premenopausal women.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, M; Shimmura, T; Bi, L F; Nagase, H; Nishino, H; Kajita, E; Eto, M; Wang, H B; Su, X L; Chang, H; Aratani, T; Kagamimori, S\n\n2004-07-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the ethnic difference in bone mass between Japanese and Inner Mongolian young premenopausal women and to assess the contribution of lifestyle related and anthropometric factors to bone mass. We studied 33 Japanese and 44 Inner Mongolian healthy young women, aged 20-34 years, in urban area. Speed of sound (SOS), broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA) and stiffness index (SI) were measured at the calcaneus using quantitative ultrasound (QUS) analysis. Age at menarche, regularity of menstruation and lifestyle related factors were estimated by a self-reported questionnaire. There were no differences between the two groups in age, height, weight, BMI, regularity of menstruation, frequency of meat intake, frequency of yellow-green vegetable intake and exercise habit. Japanese women had significantly lower age at menarche and higher proportion of milk consumption habit at junior high school, senior school and present. Before adjustment, Japanese women had significantly higher SOS and SI than Inner Mongolian women. However, after adjustment for age at menarche and milk consumption habit at junior high school, both of which were significantly different between groups, no group-differences remained in either SOS or SI. These results suggest that the differences in age at menarche and milk consumption habit at junior high school, which relate to hormonal and nutritional status during puberty, may account for the differences in bone mass between Japanese and Inner Mongolian young women.\n\nAssociation of cigarette smoking with skin colour in Japanese women.\n\nPubMed\n\nTamai, Yuya; Tsuji, Michiko; Wada, Keiko; Nakamura, Kozue; Hayashi, Makoto; Takeda, Noriyuki; Yasuda, Keigo; Nagata, Chisato\n\n2014-05-01\n\nHaving a lighter skin tone is highly valued among many Asian women. If skin colour is affected by smoking, women may be motivated to avoid tobacco or quit smoking. The present study examined the association of tobacco smoking with skin colour in Japanese women. Information on smoking habits was obtained through a self-administered questionnaire completed by 939 Japanese women aged 20-74 in Gifu, Japan, during 2003-2006. Skin colour was examined on the inner side of the upper and lower arm and on the forehead using a Mexameter device (a narrow-band reflective spectrophotometer), which expressed results as a melanin index and erythema index. Current smokers had higher melanin indices than never-smokers and former smokers for all measured sites. The number of cigarettes smoked per day, the years of smoking and pack-years were significantly positively associated with melanin indices for all measured sites after adjustments for age, body mass index, lifetime sun exposure, and room temperature and humidity. Smoking was also significantly associated with erythema indices on the inner upper and lower arms. These data suggest that smoking is associated with a darker skin colour. If our findings are confirmed by further studies, they could be used in antismoking campaigns or by smoking cessation services.\n\nDetermination of trace elements in Ethiopian, Vietnamese, and Japanese women using high-resolution IC-PMS.\n\nPubMed\n\nTekeste, Zinaye; Amare, Bemnet; Asfaw, Fanaye; Fantahun, Bereket; van Nguyen, Nhien; Nishikawa, Takeshi; Yabutani, Tomoki; Okayasu, Takako; Ota, Fusao; Kassu, Afework\n\n2015-10-01\n\nHumans and other living organisms require small quantities of trace elements throughout life. Both insufficient and excessive intakes of trace elements can have negative consequences. However, there is little information on serum level of trace elements in different populations. This study examines serum levels of trace elements in Ethiopian, Japanese, and Vietnamese women. Random samples of healthy women who were referred for routine hospital laboratory examinations in the cities of Hanoi, Sapporo, and Gondar were invited to participate in the study. Serum levels of magnesium, zinc, copper, iron, selenium, and calcium were determined using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. Furthermore, body mass index of each study participant was determined. The mean Â± SD serum concentrations of zinc (Î¼g/dL), copper (Î¼g/dL), iron (Î¼g/dL), selenium (Î¼g/dL) and calcium (mg/dL), respectively, were 76.51 Â± 39.16, 152.20 Â± 55.37, 385.68 Â± 217.95, 9.15 Â± 4.21, and 14.18 Â± 3.91 in Ethiopian women; 111.49 Â± 52.92, 105.86 Â± 26.02, 155.09 Â± 94.83, 14.11 Â± 3.41, and 11.66 Â± 2.51 in Vietnamese women; and 60.69 Â± 9.76, 107 Â± 156, 268 Â± 128, 8.33 Â± 3.65, and 11.18 Â± 0.68 in Japanese participants. Ethiopian women had significantly higher level of serum calcium than Vietnamese and Japanese women (both P < 0.05). Although the mean calcium concentration in Vietnamese women was higher than in women from Japan, the difference was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). Furthermore, compared with Japanese women, Ethiopian women had significantly high iron and copper concentrations (P < 0.05). Serum selenium and zinc levels were higher in Vietnamese than Ethiopian women. The study revealed a remarkable difference in serum concentrations of trace elements in women from different countries, implying differences in trace elements in the food or soil.

Methods We reviewed the obstetric records of all Japanese singleton deliveries at â¥ 22 weeksâ gestation managed at the Japanese Red Cross Katsushika Maternity Hospital between 2009 and 2014. Potential risk factors for hypertensive disorders with maternal depressive and anxiety disorders were selected as follows: maternal age, parity, medications, self-interruption of medications and economic problems. Results The incidence of hypertensive disorders did not increase in the pregnant women with depressive disorders compared with that in the normal control pregnant women (P = 0.96). However, the incidence of hypertensive disorders in the women with anxiety disorders was higher than that in the control women (odds ratio (OR): 2.61, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.4 - 5.0, P < 0.01). In the women with anxiety disorders, 19% performed self-interruption of medications during pregnancy, and it was associated with the increased risk of hypertensive disorders (vs. no medication group, OR: 7.50, 95% CI: 1.5 - 38, P = 0.03; vs. medication group, OR: 16.0, 95% CI: 2.4 - 110, P < 0.01). Conclusions Maternal uncontrolled anxiety disorders due to self-interruption of medications seemed to be associated with the increased risk of hypertensive disorders in Japanese pregnant women.

The findings suggest that research experiences in a small independent research unit within the major department convinced Japanese women engineering students of their academic and social success as graduate students in the current environment. Although participants generally adapted themselves to the research unit through their research, there is a variation in the degree to which they were smoothly integrated into the research unit, reflecting organisational and individual differences.\n\nSingle-dose pharmacokinetic study comparing the pharmacokinetics of recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin in healthy Japanese and Caucasian women and recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin and urinary human chorionic gonadotropin in healthy Japanese women.\n\nPubMed\n\nBagchus, Wilhelmina; Wolna, Peter; Uhl, Wolfgang\n\n2018-01-01\n\nRecombinant hCG (r-hCG) was approved in Japan in 2016. As a prerequisite for a Phase III study in Japan related to this approval, the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of r-hCG was investigated. An open-label, partly randomized, single-center, single-dose, group-comparison, Phase I PK-bridging study was done that compared a single 250Â Î¼g dose of r-hCG with a single 5000Â IU dose of urinary hCG (u-hCG) in healthy Japanese women, as well as comparing a single 250Â Î¼g dose of r-hCG in Japanese and Caucasian women. The Japanese participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either r-hCG or u-hCG, while the Caucasian participants were weight-matched to the Japanese participants who were receiving r-hCG in a 1:1 fashion. The primary PK parameters were the area under the serum concentration-time curve from time 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUC 0-â ) and the maximum serum concentration (C max ). The mean serum hCG concentration-time profiles of r-hCG in the Japanese and Caucasian participants were a similar shape, but the level of overall exposure was ~20% lower in the Japanese participants. For the Japanese participants, r-hCG resulted in an 11% lower C max but a 19% higher AUC 0-â compared with u-hCG. No new safety signal was identified. This study cannot exclude a potential difference in the PK profile of r-hCG between Japanese and Caucasian participants. However, this study does not indicate that there are clinically relevant differences in the serum PK of r-hCG and u-hCG in the Japanese participants.\n\nDiet based on the Japanese Food Guide Spinning Top and subsequent mortality among men and women in a general Japanese population.\n\nPubMed\n\nOba, Shino; Nagata, Chisato; Nakamura, Kozue; Fujii, Kaori; Kawachi, Toshiaki; Takatsuka, Naoyoshi; Shimizu, Hiroyuki\n\n2009-09-01\n\nThe Japanese Food Guide Spinning Top was developed by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare and the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishery to promote healthful diets. Adherence to the Japanese Food Guide Spinning Top was evaluated in terms of future mortality in a prospective cohort study. A prospective cohort study among men and women in a general Japanese population. The cohort consisted of 13,355 men and 15,724 women residing in Takayama, Japan, in 1992. At baseline, a food frequency questionnaire was administered, and adherence to the food guide was measured based on consuming the recommended number of servings of grains, vegetables, fish and meat, milk, and fruits, as well as total daily energy intake and energy from snacks and alcoholic beverages. Higher scores indicated better adherence to the recommendations on a scale of 0 to 70. Based on data obtained from the Office of the National Vital Statistics, deaths occurring among members of the cohort were prospectively noted from 1992 to 1999. To assess the magnitude of association of adherence scores with subsequent mortality, a Cox proportional hazard model was applied to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Among women, the adherence score was significantly associated with a lower risk of mortality from all causes (comparing highest and lowest quartiles of the score, HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.94, P for trend 0.01) in a multivariate analysis; noncardiovascular, noncancer causes (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.96, P for trend 0.04) and cardiovascular disease (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.04, P for trend0.05). No statistically significant association was observed between the adherence score and mortality among men. The results suggest that diets based on the food guide have the benefit of reducing future mortality in women.\n\nToxicity implications for early life stage Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) exposed to oxyfluorfen.\n\nPubMed\n\nPowe, Doris K; Dasmahapatra, Asok K; Russell, Joseph L; Tchounwou, Paul B\n\n2018-05-01\n\nWe investigated the potential toxic effects of Oxyfluorfen (OXY), an herbicide used in agriculture, on the embryo-larval development of Japanese medaka fish (Oryzias latipes). Embryos (1-day postfertilization) and larvae (2-day posthatch) were exposed to OXY (0.5-8 mg/L) for 96 h and evaluated for mortality and hatching on embryos, and the mortality and growth on larvae during depuration. It was observed that the embryo-mortality was inconsistently altered by OXY; only the 2 mg/L group showed significant reduction on embryo survivability. However, larval-mortality was concentration-dependent and OXY exposure induced scoliosis-like phenotypic features in the surviving larvae; the calculated LC 50 was 5.238 mg/L. Our data further indicated that larval skeleton, both axial and appendicular, was the potential target site of OXY. Skeletal growth in larvae exposed to 2 mg/L was inhibited significantly until 1 week of depuration with regard to the linear lengths of neurocranium, Meckel's cartilage, caudal vertebrae (first 10) in the axial skeletons, and pectoral fin and urostyle in the appendicular skeletons. Moreover, the total protein content remained unaltered by OXY after 96 h exposure; while the RNA concentration was reduced significantly in larvae exposed to 2 mg/L. Expression analysis of several genes by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) showed significant upregulation of zic5, a zinc-finger type transcription regulator, at the transcription level. This study indicated that the scoliosis induced by OXY in Japanese medaka larvae was the result of stunted skeletal growth, probably because of deregulation of zinc-finger type transcription regulators, at the genomic level.

In community-dwelling Japanese women, unipedal standing time, timed up and go test, and age are associated with BMD while in women aged 70 years and over, unipedal standing time is associated with BMD. The aim of this study was to clarify whether unipedal standing time is significantly associated with BMD in community-dwelling women. The subjects were 90 community-dwelling Japanese women aged 54.7 years. BMD of the second metacarpal bone was measured by computed X-ray densitometry. We measured unipedal standing time as well as timed up and go test to assess physical performance of the lower extremities. Unipedal standing time decreased with increased age. Timed up and go test significantly correlated with age. Low BMD was significantly associated with old age, short unipedal standing time, and long timed up and go test. Stepwise regression analysis revealed that age, unipedal standing time, and timed up and go test were significant factors associated with BMD. In 21 participants aged 70 years and over, body weight and unipedal standing time, but not age, were significantly associated with BMD. BMD and physical performance of the lower extremities decrease with older age. Unipedal standing time, timed up and go test, and age are associated with BMD in community-dwelling Japanese women. In women aged 70 years and over, unipedal standing time is significantly associated with BMD.\n\nA model-based cost-effectiveness analysis of osteoporosis screening and treatment strategy for postmenopausal Japanese women.\n\nPubMed\n\nYoshimura, M; Moriwaki, K; Noto, S; Takiguchi, T\n\n2017-02-01\n\nAlthough an osteoporosis screening program has been implemented as a health promotion project in Japan, its cost-effectiveness has yet to be elucidated fully. We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis and found that osteoporosis screening and treatment would be cost-effective for Japanese women over 60Â years. The purpose of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of osteoporosis screening and drug therapy in the Japanese healthcare system for postmenopausal women with no history of fracture. A patient-level state transition model was developed to predict the outcomes of Japanese women with no previous fracture. Lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated for women who receive osteoporosis screening and alendronate therapy for 5Â years and those who do not receive the screening and treatments. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the screening option compared with the no screening option was estimated. Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the influence of parameter uncertainty on the base case results. The ICERs of osteoporosis screening and treatments for Japanese women aged 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, 65-69, 70-74, and 75-79Â years were estimated to be $89,242, $64,010, $40,596, $27,697, $17,027, and $9771 per QALY gained, respectively. Deterministic sensitivity analyses showed that several parameters such as the disutility due to vertebral fracture had a significant influence on the base case results. Applying a willingness to pay of $50,000 per QALY gained, the probability that the screening option became cost-effectiveness estimated to 50.9, 56.3, 59.1, and 64.7Â % for women aged 60-64, 65-69, 70-74, and 75-79Â years, respectively. Scenario analyses showed that the ICER for women aged 55-59Â years with at least one clinical risk factor was below $50,000 per QALY. In conclusion, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) screening and alendronate therapy for osteoporosis would be cost-effective for\n\nDevelopment of a food-based diet quality score for Japanese: associations of the score with nutrient intakes in young, middle-aged and older Japanese women.\n\nPubMed\n\nKuriyama, Nozomi; Murakami, Kentaro; Livingstone, M Barbara E; Okubo, Hitomi; Kobayashi, Satomi; Suga, Hitomi; Sasaki, Satoshi\n\n2016-01-01\n\nSeveral previous studies have shown that a diet score based on the Japanese food guide Spinning Top (the original score) is associated with both favourable and unfavourable dietary intake patterns. We developed a food-based diet quality score (the modified score) and examined associations with nutrient intakes. Subjects were 3963 young (all aged 18 years), 3800 middle-aged (mean age 47Â·7 (sd 3Â·9) years) and 2211 older (mean age 74Â·4 (sd 5Â·2) years) Japanese women. Dietary intakes were assessed using comprehensive (for the young and middle-aged) and brief-type (for the older) diet history questionnaires. The original score was calculated based on intakes of grains, vegetables, fish/meat, milk, fruits, and snacks/alcoholic beverages. The modified score was similarly calculated, but included Na from seasonings and without applying the upper cut-off values for dietary components where increased consumption is advocated for Japanese women (grains, vegetables, fish/meat, milk, and fruits). The original score was positively associated with intakes of carbohydrate, dietary fibre, and all the vitamins and minerals examined including Na and inversely with intakes of fats and alcohol in young and middle-aged women. In older women, the original score was inversely associated with intakes of all nutrients except for carbohydrate and vitamin C. However, the modified score was associated positively with intakes of protein, carbohydrate, dietary fibre, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, vitamins A, C and E, and folate and inversely with intakes of fats, alcohol and Na in all generations. In conclusion, the modified diet score was positively associated with favourable nutrient intake patterns in Japanese women.\n\nDigital volumetric measurement of mammographic density and the risk of overlooking cancer in Japanese women.\n\nPubMed\n\nSawada, Terumasa; Akashi, Sadako; Nakamura, Seigo; Kuwayama, Takashi; Enokido, Katsutoshi; Yoshida, Miwa; Hashimoto, Rikako; Ide, Toshimi; Masuda, Hiroko; Taruno, Kanae; Oyama, Hiroto; Takamaru, Tomoko; Kanada, Yoko; Ikeda, Murasaki; Kosugi, Natsuko; Sato, Hiroki; Nakayama, Sayuka; Ata, Arisa; Tonouchi, Yumi; Sakai, Haruna; Matsunaga, Yuki; Matsutani, Akiko\n\n2017-09-01\n\nBreast density often affects cancer detection via mammography (MMG). Because of this, additional tests are recommended for women with dense breasts. This study aimed to reveal trends in breast density among Japanese women and determine whether differences in breast density differentially affected the detection of abnormalities via MMG. We retrospectively analyzed 397 control women who underwent MMG screening as well as 269 patients who underwent surgery for breast cancer for whom preoperative MMG data were available. VolparaDensityâ¢ (Volpara), a three-dimensional image analysis software with high reproducibility, was used to calculate breast density. Breasts were categorized according to the volumetric density grade (VDG), a measure of the percentage of dense tissue. The associations between age, VDG, and MMG density categories were analyzed. In the control group, 78% of women had dense breasts, while in the breast cancer group, 87% of patients had dense breasts. One of 36 patients with non-dense breasts (2.7%) was classified as category 1 or 2 (C-1 or C-2), indicating that abnormal findings could not be detected by MMG. The proportion of patients with breast cancer who had dense breasts and were classified as C-1 or C-2 was as high as 22.3%. The proportions of Japanese women with dense breasts were high. In addition, the false-negative rate for women with dense breasts was also high. Owing to this, Japanese women with dense breasts may need to commonly undergo additional tests to ensure detection of breast cancer in the screening MMG.\n\nLearning to Become Graduate Students: Japanese Women's Experience in the Research Unit in Engineering\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nHosaka, Masako\n\n2010-01-01\n\nBased on the analysis of 16 interviews with women first-year master's students at two national engineering schools in Japan, this article examines the socialisation role of compulsory undergraduate research experience in Japanese women's decisions to pursue graduate education and choices of the programme.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 24 infertile women. The informants were asked about their experiences of positive (helpful) and negative (unhelpful) social interactions with members of their social networks, excluding their partners, with regard to their infertility. Nine positive social interaction categories were clarified, including listening closely to the distress experienced in infertility and treatment, not prying or interfering with the topic of children and respecting the women's decision regarding fertility treatment and taking a wait-and-see attitude. Nine negative social interaction categories were also identified, including prying with the topic of children, showing a negative attitude toward infertility or reproductive medicine, being criticized for not having children and avoiding contact. The present findings systematically and qualitatively determined the positive and negative social interactions experienced by infertile Japanese women within their social networks. This is essential knowledge for medical staff to counsel patients and their family members. To form a supportive social environment for infertile women, we recommend practical measures for health workers and helpful advice with regard to interactions between infertile women and their social networks.\n\nGlobalizing Critical Studies of \"Official\" Knowledge: Lessons from the Japanese History Textbook Controversy over \"Comfort Women\"\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nTakayama, Keita\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThis paper discusses the Japanese history textbook controversy over \"comfort women\" to tease out insights that help globalize the existing theoretical discussion of politics of school knowledge.

Study 1 was conducted in Japanese women (20-35 years), and Study 2 was conducted in Caucasian women (18-35 years). All women received EE 20 mcg/drsp 3 mg in a 21-day active pill regimen. The primary endpoint was the proportion of women with ovulation inhibition (Hoogland score <6; as assessed by transvaginal ultrasonography) during treatment cycle 2. Japanese (n=23) and Caucasian (n=30) women received two cycles of study treatment. During treatment cycle 2, ovulation was inhibited in 100% and 92.9% of Japanese and Caucasian women, respectively. EE 20 mcg/drsp 3 mg in a 21/7-day regimen provides comparable ovarian suppression in Japanese and Caucasian women, with normal ovarian function resuming shortly after treatment end in both populations.

We investigated associations between three IL1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding interleukin (IL) -1Î± (rs1800587) and IL-1Î² (rs1143634 and rs16944) and the risk of periodontal disease among young Japanese women. A case-control study was performed with a total of 1150 women, including 131 subjects who had at least one tooth with a probing pocket depth of 4âmm or deeper and 1019 periodontally healthy controls. Compared with a reference group of women with the GG genotype of SNP rs16944, those with the GA genotype had a significantly reduced risk of periodontal disease, while there was no significant relationship between the AA genotype and periodontal disease. No evident relationships were observed between SNP rs1800587 or rs1143634 and periodontal disease. Our study did not reveal any evidence of interaction between the IL1 polymorphisms and smoking. The results of this study showed that the heterozygous variant genotype of the IL1 rs16944 was significantly associated with a reduced risk of periodontal disease in young Japanese women. Smoking did not significantly modify the gene-disease associations under study.\n\nRelationship Between IL1 Gene Polymorphisms and Periodontal Disease in Japanese Women\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMiyake, Yoshihiro; Hanioka, Takashi; Arakawa, Masashi\n\n2014-01-01\n\nEpidemiological evidence on the relationship between IL1A and/or IL1B polymorphisms and periodontal disease is inconsistent.

Subjects were healthy men and women aged 20-90Â years, who were randomly allocated to the following two groups: the development group (D group; 257 men, 913 women) and the cross-validation group (V group; 119 men, 112 women). To develop prediction equations, stepwise multiple regression analyses were performed on data obtained from the D group, using ASM measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as a dependent variable and five easily obtainable measures (age, height, weight, waist circumference, and handgrip strength) as independent variables. When the prediction equations for ASM estimation were applied to the V group, a significant correlation was found between DXA-measured ASM and predicted ASM in both men and women (R 2 Â =Â 0.81 and R 2 Â =Â 0.72). Our prediction equations had higher R 2 values compared to previously developed equations (R 2 Â =Â 0.75-0.59 and R 2 Â =Â 0.69-0.40) in both men and women. Moreover, sarcopenia defined by predicted ASM was related to risk factors for osteoporosis and CVD, as well as sarcopenia defined by DXA-measured ASM. In this study, novel prediction equations were developed and cross-validated in Japanese men and women. Our analyses validated the clinical significance of these prediction equations and showed that previously reported equations were not applicable in a Japanese population.\n\nFactors Influencing Japanese Women to Choose Two-Year Colleges in Japan\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nAnzai, Shinobu; Paik, Chie Matsuzawa\n\n2012-01-01\n\nTwo-year colleges in Japan have traditionally absorbed the major portion of female college entrants due to long-held gender stereotypes.

In particular, no studies have been reported in Asian countries, including Japan, which is thought to have high socioeconomic status inconsistency among women. We examined the effect of status inconsistency between education level and occupation on stroke risk in a prospective 20-year study of 14 742 middle-aged Japanese women included in the prospective Japan Public Health Center-based (JPHC) Study Cohort I in 1990. Status inconsistency between education level and occupation was determined (qualified, overqualified, and underqualified), and the association with risk of stroke was examined. Cox proportional regression analysis was used to determine hazard ratios, which were adjusted for age, marital status, and geographical area. Adjusted hazard ratio for stroke in overqualified compared with qualified women was 2.06 (95% confidence interval, 1.13-3.78). Adjusted hazard ratios for stroke among highly educated manual workers and workers in service industry were 3.47 (95% confidence interval, 1.54-7.84) and 3.21 (95% confidence interval, 1.49-6.90), respectively, when compared with highly educated professionals/managers. High academic qualifications without an appropriate job could be a risk factor for stroke among Japanese women. Our result suggests that status inconsistency could be a potential explanation for the increased stroke risk among highly educated women.

They were abducted from their homes in countries under Imperial Japanese rule, mostly from Korea, and the rest from China, Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan, Indonesia, the Netherlands, etc. \"Comfort women\" endured extreme trauma involving rape, sexual torture, physical abuse, starvation, threats of death, and witnessed many others being tortured and killed. This article reviews all the studies that have investigated the psychiatric or psychosocial sequelae of the survivors of the Japanese military sexual slavery. Most importantly, a recent study which conducted a psychiatric evaluation on the former \"comfort women\" currently alive in South Korea is introduced. The participants' unmarried rate was relatively high and their total fertility rate was relatively low. Majority of the participants reported having no education and being the low economic status. They showed high current and lifetime prevalence of posttraumatic disorder, major depressive disorder, somatic symptom disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and alcohol use disorder. Participants showed high suicidality and majority of the participants still reported being ashamed of being former \"comfort women\" after all these years. This article high-lights the fact that the trauma has affected the mental health and social functioning of former \"comfort women\" throughout their lives, and even to the present day.\n\nCervical screening and general physical examination behaviors of women exposed in utero to diethylstilbestrol.\n\nPubMed\n\nCamp, Elizabeth A; Coker, Ann L; Troisi, Rebecca; Robboy, Stanley J; Noller, Kenneth L; Goodman, Karen J; Titus-Ernstoff, Linda T; Hatch, Elizabeth E; Herbst, Arthur L; Kaufman, Raymond H; Adam, Ervin\n\n2008-04-01\n\nTo estimate whether women exposed in utero to diethylstilbestrol (DES) report receiving more cervical and general physical examinations compared to unexposed women. 1994 Diethylstilbestrol Adenosis cohort data are used to assess the degree of recommended compliance of cervical screenings found in 3,140 DES-exposed and 826 unexposed women. Participants were enrolled at 4 sites: Houston, Boston, Rochester, and Los Angeles. Logistic regression modeling was used to analyze mailed questionnaire data, which included reported frequency over the preceding 5 years (1990-1994) of Papanicolaou smears and general physical examinations. Diethylstilbestrol-exposed women exceeded the recommended frequency of Papanicolaou smear screenings [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 2.15, 95% CI (confidence interval) = 1.60-2.88] compared to the unexposed. This association held among those without a history of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (aOR = 1.88, 95% CI = 1.35-2.62). Diethylstilbestrol-exposed women exceeded annual recommendations for physical examinations (aOR = 2.27, 95% CI = 1.16-4.43) among women without a history of chronic disease when compared to unexposed women. Most DES-exposed women are receiving cervical cancer screening at least at recommended intervals, but one third of the women are not receiving annual Papanicolaou smear examinations.\n\nFood-based diet quality score in relation to depressive symptoms in young and middle-aged Japanese women.\n\nPubMed\n\nSakai, Hiroka; Murakami, Kentaro; Kobayashi, Satomi; Suga, Hitomi; Sasaki, Satoshi\n\n2017-06-01\n\nOnly a few studies have focused on the association between overall diet, rather than intakes of individual nutrients or foods, and depressive symptoms in Japanese. This cross-sectional study examined associations between a diet quality score and depressive symptoms in 3963 young (age 18 years) and 3833 middle-aged (mean age 47Â·9 (sd 4Â·2) years) Japanese women. Dietary information was collected using a diet history questionnaire. A previously developed diet quality score was computed mainly based on the Japanese Food Guide Spinning Top. The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 22Â·0 % for young women and 16Â·8 % for middle-aged women, assessed as a Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) score â¥23 and â¥19, respectively. As expected, the diet quality score was associated positively with intakes of 'grain dishes', 'vegetable dishes', 'fish and meat dishes', 'milk' and 'fruits' and inversely with intakes of energy from 'snacks, confection and beverages' and Na from seasonings. After adjustment for potential confounders, OR for depressive symptoms in the highest v. lowest quintiles of the diet quality score was 0Â·65 (95 % CI 0Â·50, 0Â·84) in young women (P for trend=0Â·0005). In middle-aged women, the corresponding value was 0Â·59 (95 % CI 0Â·45, 0Â·78) (P for trend<0Â·0001). Analyses where the diet quality and CES-D scores were treated as continuous variables also showed inverse associations. In conclusion, this cross-sectional study showed that a higher diet quality score was associated with a lower prevalence of depressive symptoms in young and middle-aged Japanese women. Prospective studies are needed to confirm a public health relevance of this finding.\n\nCost-effectiveness analysis of prophylactic cervical cancer vaccination in Japanese women.\n\nPubMed\n\nKonno, Ryo; Sasagawa, Toshiyuki; Fukuda, Takashi; Van Kriekinge, Georges; Demarteau, Nadia\n\n2010-04-01\n\nThe incidence of cervical cancer (CC) is high in Japan and is further increasing among women younger than 30 years. This burden could be reduced by the implementation of a CC vaccine, but its cost-effectiveness is unknown. We quantified the clinical impact and assessed the cost-effectiveness of adding CC vaccination at age 12 to the current screening in place in Japan with a lifetime Markov model adapted to the Japanese setting. Transition probabilities and utility values were obtained from public databases. Direct costs for treatment and screening were estimated using Japanese medical fees. Annual costs and benefits were discounted at 3%. Sensitivity analyses were conducted on the age at vaccination, the vaccine characteristics, the discount rates, the proportion of human papillomavirus types 16/18 in cancer, and the screening coverage. Vaccinating a 12-year-old cohort was predicted to reduce CC incidence and deaths from CC by 73%. These clinical effects were associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of yen1.8 million per quality-adjusted life year gained. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of vaccinating all 10- to 45-year-old women was yen2.8 million per quality-adjusted life year, still below the threshold value. The implementation of a CC vaccination in Japan could reduce the CC burden in a very cost-effective manner for women up to 45 years.\n\nAnthropometrical data of middle-aged Japanese women for industrial design applications.\n\nPubMed\n\nAshizawa, K; Okada, A; Kouchi, M; Horino, S; Kikuchi, Y\n\n1994-06-01\n\nDespite the growing importance of human interface design, and despite the growing number of working women, no considerations have been given to women's working spaces and tools. Their designs are based on men's anthropometrical data, and this does not assure safety and amenity of women's working environments. Moreover, few data on women's body measurements are available. The Research Institute of Human Engineering for Quality Life is carrying out an ergonomic anthropometrical study on a large number of Japanese people to create a database for industrial use. The fee for the use of these data is, however, making it very difficult to profit from their acquisition. Therefore, we conducted an anthropometrical study for industrial design use on middle-aged female subjects, who are in the most difficult age group to access. This report should be useful in designing working spaces and tools for women as laborers as well as users.\n\nIncivility among Group Mates in English Classes at a Japanese Women's University\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nJacobs, George M.; Kimura, Harumi; Greliche, Nicolas\n\n2016-01-01\n\nIncivilities are words and actions that may be perceived as impolite.

The objective of this study was to compare the presence of chronic airway diseases (CAD) in two groups of nonsmoking women older than 40 years with (exposed group, n=397) and without a history of exposure to biomass cooking (liquid petroleum gas (LPG); control group, n=199), in 2002 in Kirikkale, Turkey. Detailed respiratory symptoms were collected with a standard questionnaire adapted from that of the British Medical Research Council. Exposure was calculated as the average hours spent daily for cooking multiplied by the number of years. CAD were defined as either chronic airway obstruction (CAO; (forced expiratory volume in 1s/forced vital capacity)<0.70), chronic bronchitis, or chronic bronchitis with CAO. The prevalence of CAD in the exposed group was found to be higher than that in the LPG group (28.5% vs. 13.6%, crude odds ratios (ORs) 2.5 (1.5--4.0), P=0.0001). The fraction of CAD attributed to exposure to biomass smoke after adjusting for possible confounding factors was 23.1% (95% confidence interval (CI) 13.4--33.2). Acute symptoms during exposure to biomass smoke were important predictors for the presence of CAD. Biomass smoke pollution is an important contributing factor in the development of CAD in nonsmoking women living in a rural area. The presence of acute symptoms during cooking in women in rural areas should signal to general practitioners the possibility of CAD.\n\nUn-Autobiographical Autobiographies: Investigating the Life-Stories of Ten Elderly Nisei Christian Women at a Local Japanese American Church\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nOkamura, Naoki\n\n2010-01-01\n\nTraise Yamamoto, a professor of English and a scholar of biographical studies, made the following remark in her book \"Masking Selves, Making Subjects\" (1999).

A retrospective cohort study was performed. The participants were 123 Japanese women with gestational diabetes who underwent 75-g oral glucose tolerance tests at 8-12 weeks after delivery. They were divided into a glucose intolerance and a normal glucose tolerance group based on postpartum oral glucose tolerance test results. Analysis of the pregnancy oral glucose tolerance test results showed predictive factors for postpartum glucose intolerance. We also evaluated the clinical usefulness of the prediction model based on decision-curve analysis. Of 123 women, 78 (63.4%) had normoglycaemia and 45 (36.6%) had glucose intolerance. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed insulinogenic index/fasting immunoreactive insulin and summation of glucose levels, assessed during pregnancy oral glucose tolerance tests (total glucose), to be independent risk factors for postpartum glucose intolerance. Evaluating the regression models, the best discrimination (area under the curve 0.725) was obtained using the basic model (i.e. age, family history of diabetes, BMI â¥25 kg/m 2 and use of insulin during pregnancy) plus insulinogenic index/fasting immunoreactive insulin <1.1. Decision-curve analysis showed that combining insulinogenic index/fasting immunoreactive insulin <1.1 with basic clinical information resulted in superior net benefits for prediction of postpartum glucose intolerance. Insulinogenic index/fasting immunoreactive insulin calculated using oral glucose tolerance test results during pregnancy is potentially useful for predicting early postpartum glucose intolerance in Japanese women with gestational diabetes.

Several adverse outcomes have been linked to such exposure, but their cumulative effects are not well understood. We combined data from three studies initiated in the 1970s with continued long-term follow-up of 4653 women exposed in utero to DES and 1927 unexposed controls. We asses"
