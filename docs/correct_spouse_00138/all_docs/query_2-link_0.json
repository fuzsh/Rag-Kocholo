        "text": "12 Mar â€“ SPEED member Uehara Takako was reported to be getting married to hip-hop group ET-KING member Tenn this July, according to Tokyo Hive.\n\n29-year-old Uehara was said to have met her 33-year-old future husband when they performed at a charity concert in June last year. They started dating soon after and have remained in a relationship ever since.\n\nAlthough there has been no official announcement yet from either celebrities or their agencies, Uehara is not pregnant as is currently speculated, as her marriage, should it be true, was considered to be sudden.\n\nUehara is the second member from SPEED who is getting married, following Imai Eriko who married ska-punk band 175R vocalist Shogo back in 2004, before they divorced in 2007."
