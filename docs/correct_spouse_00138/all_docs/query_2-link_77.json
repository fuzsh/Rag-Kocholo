He is working in medical informatics based on natural language processing (NLP) and social media-based applications. He is also leading the medical NLP shared task (MedNLP) of NTCIR. His hobby is drawing and music composing.\n\nIâm recruiting Ph.D. students and PostDoc researchers. Please send me your CV with a publication list if you are interested. Note that we do not have âresearch studentâ positions.\n\nPublications / ACL Anthology / Google Scholar / Semantic Scholar\n\nEducation\n\nB.S. Kyoto University, 2000.\n\nM.S.

Natural language processing (NLP) techniques have gained importance in the medical field. Because NLP is a hot topic in computer science, the number of medical NLP studies is increasing each year dramatically. We extract information from EHRs to find a new medical finding.\n\ndrug information (JMIR2023, JMIR Cancer2022, PLOS ONE2022ï¼\n\nmeta analysis (MedInfo2021)\n\nSee our review paper (IMIA YEADBOOK2022)\n\nSocial Media meets NLP\n\nHealth-related social media data are increasingly being used in disease surveillance studies. In particular, surveillance of infectious diseases such as influenza, and mental issue has demonstrated high correlations between the number of social media posts mentioning the disease and the number of patients. From social media, we aim to extract not only the patient number but also the patient's intentions, hidden needs, and attitudes to health care systems.\n\nOn-going Core Research\n\nNot only the above solid research, but we are also always finding new frontiers such as:\n\nCatch the well-being from texts\n\nHow to train ethics to AI\n\nWhat is humanity\n\nDrawing\n\nSometimes, I am a painter. My works are mostly oil paint-based human portraits.\n\nMusic\n\nI am also a music composer. My works are beatless acoustic sounds with a sampling of abandoned old pianos.\n\nPublication\n\nï½BOOKï½JOURNALï½CONFERENCEBOOK\n\n1.
