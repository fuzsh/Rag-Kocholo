        "text": "This is a list of members of the Diet of Japan. The Diet has two chambers: the House of Councillors (upper house) and the House of Representatives (lower house). Councillors serve six year terms, with half being elected every three years. Representatives serve terms of up to four years, but the House of Representatives can be dissolved, causing a shorter term (snap election).\n\nMembers of the House of Representatives elected in the 43rd general election (2003) Members of the House of Representatives elected in the 44th general election (2005) Members of the House of Representatives elected in the 45th general election (2009) Members of the House of Representatives elected in the 46th general election (2012) Members of the House of Representatives elected in the 47th general election (2014) Members of the House of Representatives elected in the 48th general election – Current List (2017) Members of the House of Representatives elected in the 49th general election (2021)\n\nComposition of the House of Representatives of Japan in the English Wikipedia\n\n(as of unspecified point in time)[1]\n\nelected by 2021 Japanese general election (term: 31 October 2021 – 30 October 2025 or earlier dissolution) In-House Groups\n\n[innai] kaiha Parties Seats\n\nby parties Seats Government 290 Liberal Democratic Party\n\nJiyūminshutō / Mushozoku no Kai\n\nLiberal Democratic Party / Association of independents Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) 257 258 Independent 1 Komeito\n\nKōmeitō Komeito 32 32 Opposition 164 The Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan\n\nRikken Minshutō・Mushozoku\n\nConstitutional Democratic Party / Independents Constitutional Democratic Party (CDP) 98 100 Social Democratic Party (SDP) 1 Independent 1 Nippon Ishin (Japan Innovation Party) and Free Education For All\n\nNippon Ishin no Kai / Kyōiku mushō-ka o jitsugen suru Kai\n\nNippon Ishin no Kai / Free Education For All Nippon Ishin no Kai 41 45 Free Education For All 4 Japanese Communist Party\n\nNihon Kyōsantō Japanese Communist Party (JCP) 10 10 Democratic Party for the People\n\nKokumin Minshutō・Mushozoku Club\n\nDemocratic Party for the People / Independent Club Democratic Party For the People (DPFP) 7 7 Yūshi no Kai\n\nYūshi no Kai Independent 4 4 Reiwa Shinsengumi\n\nReiwa Shinsengumi Reiwa Shinsengumi 3 3 Independents (government or opposition) 7 Independents (not member of a caucus)\n\nMushozoku LDP (Speaker: Fukushiro Nukaga) 1 CDP (Vice-Speaker: Banri Kaieda) 1 Independents (not member of a party) 5 Total 464 Vacant\n\nKetsuin majoritarian seats: Tokyo 15th district, Shimane 1st district, Nagasaki 3rd district\n\n(by-elections 28 April 2024)\n\nproportional seat: one CDP list seat from Kyūshū (scheduled runner-up replacement: Hiroshi Kawauchi)[2] 1\n\nList of members by parliamentary group and constituency. There are usually translations and abbreviations for parliamentary groups (会派, kaiha, current House of Representatives website translation: \"In-House Group\") used on the English pages of the House of Representatives website,[3]\n\nLDP\n\nKōmeitō\n\nCDP\n\nDPFP\n\nJCP\n\nNippon Ishin\n\nGroup of Independents\n\nSDP\n\nKibo\n\nIndependents\n\nNotes:\n\nNot all members of a parliamentary group are necessarily members of the associated party/parties if any, and vice versa. For example, the Speaker and Vice-Speaker of the House of Representatives are independents in terms of parliamentary group membership, but not independents in terms of party membership.\n\nThe count of terms as given by the House of Representatives follows the usual way of counting them in Japan by number of won elections (tōsen kaisū) which is not necessarily identical to election periods of the House of Representatives. For example, former member Nobutaka Machimura served for two terms as a member during the (2009–2012) 45th election period of the House of Representatives: one as member for the Hokkaidō proportional constituency from the general election in August 2009 to his resignation in September 2010, and one as member for constituency number 5 in Hokkaidō from the by-election in October 2010 to dissolution in November 2012. Among other things, the election count determines the seating within a parliamentary group, the more senior members by this measure sit in the back.\n\nMost proportional members of the House of Representatives have been deleted.\n\nMembers of the House of Representatives (as of April 26, 2021)[4] Constituency Elected Members Parliamentary group Notes\n\nHokkaido\n\n[edit]\n\n12 single-member
