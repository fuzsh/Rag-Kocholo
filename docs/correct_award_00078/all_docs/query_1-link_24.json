        "text": "(1935–2023). One of Japan’s preeminent post-World War II writers, Oe Kenzaburo won the 1994 Nobel Prize for Literature. He wrote many popular short stories and novels, including The Silent Cry and A Personal Matter, a novel based on Oe’s own experiences in dealing with the birth of a mentally impaired son.\n\nOe Kenzaburo was born on January 31, 1935, in the forest village of Ose on the island of Shikoku, one of the four main islands of Japan. His family lived a very traditional life; having never left the village, the family did not expect Kenzaburo to do so either. He grew up listening to oral histories of the Oe clan intertwined with fanciful myths and legends.\n\nJapan suffered a major identity crisis at the end of World War II when the emperor surrendered the war. Oe was 10 years old and, like all Japanese children at the time, had learned to revere the emperor as a god. The shock of hearing the emperor speak in a human voice on the radio disillusioned and confused him. The war brought other changes as well: Oe’s father died during the war, and his mother took over his education. She gave him books such as The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and The Strange Adventures of Nils Holgersson, which made a great impression on him. As Japan’s old system of rule was replaced with democratic principles, Oe became swept up in the new ideology and decided to leave for Tokyo to search for different opportunities. He left home when he was 18 years old.\n\nThe following year Oe enrolled in the department of French literature at Tokyo University, where he received instruction from Professor Watanabe Kazuo. Greatly influenced by the writings of François Rabelais, the French Renaissance, and humanism, Watanabe passed on these interests to his eager young pupil. While still a student at the university, Oe published his first novella, The Catch, which won the Akutagawa Prize, Japan’s equivalent of the Pulitzer Prize. He also published a short story, “Lavish Are the Dead” (1957), and his first novel, entitled Nip the Buds, Shoot the Kids (1958). Oe graduated in 1958.\n\nIn the early 1960s Oe made several important excursions: one to China, where he met with Mao Zedong, and one to Russia and western Europe, where he had several meetings with Jean-Paul Sartre. He was extremely prolific during this period, publishing The Youth Who Came Late (1961), Seventeen (1961), Screams (1962), The Perverts (1963), Hiroshima Notes (1963), and Adventures in Daily Life (1964).\n\nIn 1963 Oe’s first child was born severely mentally impaired, an event which was to have a lasting influence on his life and work. In A Personal Matter (1969) and other novels and short stories, Oe fictionalized his own struggle to accept and raise the boy. The work Oe did during this struggle included Teach Us to Outgrow Our Madness (1969), My Deluged Soul (1973), The Pinch Runner Memorandum (1976) and Rouse Up, O, Young Men of the New Age! (1983).\n\nOe wrote primarily for a Japanese readership, and translations of many of his works were slow in coming. However, he was heavily influenced by Western thinkers and writers, including Dante, Yeats, Rabelais, Sartre, and Auden, among others. Many of his novels mixed strains of existentialism and nihilism into a post-war Japanese context. The Silent Cry (1967) and other works placed characters with sheltered, rural mind-sets in a gritty and often brutal urban landscape.\n\nDespite what many perceived to be his grim and pessimistic outlook, Oe experienced something close to a miraculous event in his own life. His mentally impaired son, Hikari, began to use a life-long interest in music as a method of communication when he was in his late 20s. With the help of his piano teacher Hikari began to compose his own music, and one of his recordings won Japan’s top prize for classical Japanese music.\n\nIn 1994 Oe won the Nobel Prize for Literature. At the time of the award, he announced he no longer needed to write, since his son had found his own voice. However, Oe did continue to publish fiction, including the books An Echo of Heaven (1996), The Changeling (2000), and Death by Water (2009). Oe died on March 3, 2023."
