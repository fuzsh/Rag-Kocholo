        "text": "2008 Nobel Peace Prize\n\nMartti Oiva Kalevi Ahtisaari\n\nMartti Ahtissari (1937. 6. 23. ~) is a Finnish politician known as a peace mediator and conflict resolver. After his career as Minister of Foreign Affairs, he was elected president in Finland’s first ever direct elections. During his tenure, he realized Finland’s EU membership, established the non-governmental organization CMI for international conflict resolution, and contributed to the resolution of the Kosovo Crisis by persuading both Russia and Yugoslavia in 1999. After retiring from presidency in 2000, he served as an inspector to the IRA disarmament process and in 2005 mediated peace between the Indonesian government and the Free Aceh Movement. In recognition of his thirty years of contribution to resolving international conflicts in various continents, he was rewarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2008. 1994 Nobel Prize in Litearture\n\nOe Kenzaburo\n\nOe Kenzaburo (1935.1.31 ~) is a Japanese novelist. He is an internationally renowned author who both writes on and actively partakes in various social movements involving universal values, such as peace, democracy, pacifism, and the antinuclear movement. He first debuted with the novel 《The Strange Work》 in 1957, and first acquired fame when he was rewarded the Akutagawa Prize in 1958 for his work 《Prize Stock》. In 1967, he became the youngest recipient of the Tanizaki Prize for his novel, 《The Silent City》, which was further rewarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1994. In 2006, the ‘Oe Kenzaburo Award’ was established in recognition of the 50th anniversary of his literary career,and his eldest son Oe Hikari is a handicapped composer. 2007 Nobel Prize in Economics\n\nEric Stark Maskin\n\nHarvard University Economics Professor Maskin (1950.12.12~ ) is an illustrious American economist and a master of game theory. How can airlines differentiate services and rates for first class, business class, and economy seats to maximize their profit when it is difficult to know each customer’s preference? What auctioning method should an auctioneer adopt to receive the highest possible price? How will the local government divide costs among the citizens for constructing public goods? The ‘mechanism design’ is a systematic analytic tool that can respond to such questions. Maskin and Myerson combined game theory with the mechanism design first created by Hurwicz, to improve on it immensely, and the three scholars were awarded the 2007 Nobel Prize in Economics in recognition of their contribution. Maskin had served as the SK Visiting Professor at Yonsei University in 2009. 1973 Nobel Prize in Physics\n\nIvar Giaever\n\nDoctor Giaever(1929. 4. 5.~) is a Norway-born American physicist. In 1960, he first measured the electron tunneling phenomena through very thin layers of oxide in superconductors, and thus experimentally proved the existence of energy gaps in superconductors. This research eventually led to the discovery of the Josephson Phenomenon in superconductors, and Giaever was rewarded the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physics, along with Brian Josephson and Leo Esaki, in recognition of this contribution. He has subsequently performed various research in biophysics, and continues to engage in activities related to science and society. 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics\n\nToshihide Maskawa\n\nToshihide Maskawa (1940. 2. 7.~) is a Japanese theoretical physicist. In 1973, he first presented the hypothesis that there are six types of quarks, the smallest unit of subatom particles, and Kobayashi theoretically proved this to establish the Kobayashi-Maskawa theory. Through this, evidence that the symmetry between matter and anti-matter maintained since the Big Bang was offset at some moment, so that the anti-matter disappeared, only matter remained, and the universe as we know it was crated, was offered for the first time. In 2008, he received the Nobel Prize in Physics, along with Makoto Kobayashi and Yoichiro Nambu, in recognition of his contribution to research on the ‘broken symmetry’ theory, which cons- titutes a central concept in modern particle physics. 2013 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine\n\nRandy Wayne Schekman\n\nRandy Schekman(1948. 12.30.~) is an American cell biologist, who is considered a founding father of modern cell biology for discovering the mechanism for cell membrane vesicle tra- fficking, by which matter created within a cell is targeted, transferred and then excreted out- side of the cell. Since the 1970s, he has conducted research on the DNA aspect of membrane assembly in yeast, and has discovered the three key DNA for controlling cell membrane vesicle training and the correlation between mutations in these DNA and diseases. In recognition of having discovered this crucial mechanism, he was rewarded the 2013 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine, in addition to fellow recipients James Rothman and Thomas Südhof."
