Each year, it features a different group of authors from a range of countries, languages, and traditions. In Autumn 2022 we will be introduced to: Gabriel Mistral (AR), William Faulkner (US), Halldór Laxness (IS), Alexandr Solzhenitsyn (RU), Heinrich Böll (DE), Czesław Miłosz (PL), Gabriel García Márquez (CO), Ōe Kenzaburō (JP), Toni Morrison (US), Louise Glück (US). UW faculty experts on these authors will introduce them to us, and then we will discuss them in discussion sections and write about them in our prompts.\n\nThis class is team-taught: a different faculty member will give a lecture each week about the work of a writer from their area of expertise. The team-taught method will share our university’s expertise. It will also provide you with a unique view of the many language and literature departments and disciplines at the UW, including Asian Languages and Literatures, Comparative History of Ideas (CHID), English, Germanics, Scandinavian Studies, Slavic, and Spanish and Portuguese, as well as Comparative Literature (a major within the CMS Department). You will see that these departments, while providing a unique opportunity to learn many world languages and read their literatures in the original language, also offer a large number of classes, as well as majors and minors, that do not require the study of a foreign language. This class gives you a small taste of such classes, majors and minors, as all our non-English texts are given in English translation and can be read, enjoyed, and studied in such translation. Our instructors will touch on the issues of literature in translation in their lectures as well.\n\nLectures by faculty from each unit will focus on the writer and text of the week, but also discuss wide-ranging questions of literature and the politics of prizes. Who wins, who doesn’t, and why? What does that tell us about literature and about the world in which we live?\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\n3 credits, C/NC, 70% gives a grade of Credit. VLPA.\n\nAssignments include readings, lectures, writing online discussion posts, participation in discussion sections, and a weekly post-discussion post. 3 credits (for \"credit or no credit\"), VLPA.\n\nGOALS\n\nTo gain a sense of the mode of literature. That is, of the use of language, either oral or written, that is not oriented simply towards communicating information but instead contains “excess” of meaning that makes it relevant in times and places far from those of its origin, and that has a global and interconnected history that is as long as—and an active part of—human history;\n\nTo acquire a sense of the wealth and diversity of the world’s literatures;\n\nTo become familiar with selected authors and examples of their work;\n\nTo learn about the politics of literary prizes and literary fame;\n\nTo gain a broad view of the Humanities at the UW and its departments of languages, literatures, and cultures.\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\nReadings\n\nAll the readings are posted on our Canvas course site on the Home page (Assignments)\n\nThese weekly readings include a required part—the select text(s) written by that author—and, as well as optional additional readings such as the author’s short biography, Nobel Prize acceptance speech, and other materials.\n\nAll readings should be completed in advance of the lecture on them. For example, a posted excerpt from a Gabriel Mistral novel should be completed before our first lecture on October 4, and so on. Readings are of a modest size: about 20-25-pages per week.\n\nLectures\n\nThe lectures take place on Tuesdays 11:30 AM – 1:20 PM, in Gowen 201. Please be advised there are 105 seats in the class and 105 students registered. You are advised to arrive early. Out of respect for our visiting lecturers, do not enter the room late.\n\nDiscussion Posts (90%)\n\nEach discussion section will have a running weekly on-line discussion and in-class discussion in section. Each week, students will need to make two posts on the course Canvas webpage.\n\nPost One must be posted by Midnight (12:00AM) the Wednesday after the in-class lecture. The post should raise a question, make a response, note something of interest, or point to a confusion that the poster had in reaction to the reading assigned and/or the lecture. The post should be clear and substantive, and a minimum of 50 words. If it does not meet a minimum standard of clarity and substance, it will not receive credit.\n\nPost Two should state a takeaway from the in-class discussion in your discussion section’s discussion of the author. It must be posted by midnight on the Friday following Thursday discussion section. The post should state a theme, question, argument, or other substantive point about the discussion of the author’s work in section. Criteria for this post are the same as for Post One: clear, substantive, minimum of 50 words. If you make something up, because you skipped your discussion section, you will not receive credit.\n\nThis means your work for the class is to make 20 posts, or two per week, for the course of the quarter. If you do that, and meet the criteria for the posts, you will receive a C (credit) with flying colors. Easy and fun and you will learn a lot!\n\nThe minimum standard for a passing grade for the course is 14 posts. If you have no posts from the last two weeks of class, you will receive a grade of NC.\n\nParticipation in Discussion Sessions (10%)\n\nYou are required to participate in the fifty-minute in-person discussion sections (called “quiz” sections, even though they will not be used for quizzes) on Thursdays, which will, depending on what discussion section you registered for, be taught by Ian Gwin or Maxine Savage.\n\nSome students are more comfortable talking than others so your participation will mostly be assessed by your active presence. Further, you will make a discussion post about quiz section, requiring your presence. You should be present, pay attention, and be able to offer some thoughts if asked to do so. In general, you should talk as much as this is comfortable for you. This is your opportunity to discuss, learn, and prepare your thoughts about your discussion-section post. If you earn no participation points for the last three weeks (not including Thanksgiving week), you will receive a grade of NC.\n\nNB! There is no discussion section for Thanksgiving week, so you will receive a Thanksgiving bonus of 2 participation points for that week.\n\nGRADES AND ASSESSMENT\n\nCourse grades (“credit or no credit”) will be calculated as follows:\n\n- Online posts: 90% (20 posts at 9 points each)\n\n- Discussion participation: 10% (10 discussion sections at 2 points each); you must earn points for participation at least once during the last three weeks.\n\nYou must achieve a total of 70% (140 points) in order to pass this course and receive a grade of “Credit.\"\n\nCOMMUNICATING WITH INSTRUCTORS\n\nInstructors Nestingen, Gwin, and Savage will hold regular office hours at the same time each week. See our schedule at the top of this syllabus. Please avail yourself of this opportunity to have your individual concerns addressed, or simply to just check in with us or say hi. The office hours give an opportunity for one-on-one consultation.\n\nIn addition, you are always welcome to email our instructors with regard to specific questions about their own lectures, authors, or field of study. Just type their name and the UW department and you’ll get to their faculty page which will list their research, teaching, and email address.\n\nSCHEDULE OF THE CLASS\n\nWeek 1\n\nNO CLASS MEETING OR SECTIONS\n\nFri., September 30 Lecture: Introduction to the Class & What Is Literature?\n\nCourse Introduction\n\nThree definitions of literature\n\nIntroduction to the Nobel Prize\n\nSpeaker: Andrew Nestingen, Scandinavian Studies\n\nPlease Note: This is a remote, previously recorded lecture, located in our Canvas “Modules” section.\n\nWeek 2\n\nOctober 4: Lecture: Gabriela Mistral (AR), Nobel Prize 1945\n\nSpeaker: Cynthia Steele, (Spanish & Portuguese)\n\nWeek 3\n\nOctober 11: Lecture: William Faulkner (US), Nobel Prize 1949\n\nSpeaker: Monika Kaup (English)\n\nWeek 4\n\nTu, October 18 Lecture: Halldór Laxness (IS); Nobel Prize 1955\n\nSpeaker: Lauren Poyer (Scandinavian)\n\nWeek 5\n\nOctober 25 Lecture: Alexandr Solzhenitsyn (RU), Nobel Prize 1970\n\nSpeaker: José Alaniz (Slavic)\n\nWeek 6\n\nNovember 1 Lecture: Heinrich Böll (DE), Nobel Prize 1972\n\nSpeaker: Annegret Oehme (Germanics)\n\nWeek 7\n\nNovember 8 Lecture: Czesław Miłosz (PL), Nobel Prize 1980\n\nSpeaker: Piotr Florczyk (Slavic)\n\nWeek 8\n\nNovember 15 Lecture: Gabriel García Márquez (CO), Nobel Prize 1982\n\nSpeaker: José Antonio Lucero (CHID)\n\nWeek 9\n\nNovember 22 Lecture: Toni Morrison (US), Nobel Prize 1993\n\nSpeaker: Michael Faucette (Scandinavian)\n\nTh November 24: Thanksgiving Holiday: No Discussion Section\n\nWeek 10\n\nNovember 30 Lecture: Ōe Kenzaburō (JP), Nobel Prize 1994\n\nSpeaker: Ted Mack (Asian Languages and Literatures)\n\nWeek 11\n\nDecember 7 Lecture: Louise Glück (US), Nobel Prize 2020\n\nSpeaker: Brian Reed (English)\n\nPOLICIES\n\nACADEMIC INTEGRITY\n\nThe University takes academic integrity very seriously. Behaving with integrity is part of our responsibility to our shared learning community. If you’re uncertain about if something is academic misconduct, ask me or your TA. We are willing to discuss questions you might have.\n\nActs of academic misconduct may include but are not limited to:\n\nPlagiarism (representing the work of others as your own without giving appropriate credit to the original author(s))\n\nUnauthorized collaboration (working with each other on assignments, without stating so, for example submitting the same or highly similar work or portions of work)\n\nConcerns about these or other behaviors prohibited by the Student Conduct Code may be referred for investigation and adjudication. Students found to have engaged in academic misconduct will receive a NC grade for the assignment in which the misconduct occurred as well as possible referral of their misconduct violation to the College of Arts and Sciences designated representative.\n\nRELIGIOUS ACCOMMODATIONS\n\nWashington state law requires that UW develop a policy for accommodation of student absences or significant hardship due to reasons of faith or conscience, or for organized religious activities. The UW’s policy, including more information about how to request an accommodation, is available at Religious Accommodations Policy (https://registrar.washington.edu/staffandfaculty/religious-accommodations-policy/). Accommodations must be requested within the first two weeks of this course using the Religious Accommodations Request form (https://registrar.washington.edu/students/religious-accommodations-request/).\n\nDISABILITY RESOURCES\n\nYour experience in this class is important to me. If you have already established accommodations with Disability Resources for Students (DRS), please communicate your approved accommodations to me at your earliest convenience so we can discuss your needs in this course.\n\nIf you have not yet established services through DRS, but have a temporary health condition or permanent disability that requires accommodations (conditions include but not limited to; mental health, attention-related, learning, vision, hearing, physical or health impacts), you are welcome to contact DRS at 206-543-8924 or uwdrs@uw.edu or disability.uw.edu. DRS offers resources and coordinates reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities and/or temporary health conditions. Reasonable accommodations are established through an interactive process between you, your instructor(s) and DRS. It is the policy and practice of the University of Washington to create inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with federal and state law.\n\nRESPECT\n\nWe aspire to create a classroom environment that encourages and welcomes different perspectives. How do we learn anything in the absence of robust engagement with ideas and views that differ from our own? Respect for different views and the people who express them does not necessarily mean agreement with them; at a minimum, it means that we should cultivate gratitude for the opportunity to re-examine our habits of thought. Let’s work together and show mutual respect.\n\nMASKING and COVID prevention.\n\nUniversity policy strongly recommends mask use. Please familiarize yourself with UW policy on masking and COVID-19 prevention and infection reporting and comply with it. In support of our entire community, especially our most vulnerable members, please wear a mask while in the classroom. Free masks are available at multiple locations on campus. Masking contributes to an equitable and safe environment for learning, ensuring safety for you, your instructors, your classmates, our community at UW and beyond. Given the size of the room, I have communicated to our visiting lecturers that they may opt to lecture without a mask to make speaking easier. I have also communicated to the TAs that they may fine tune discussion-section masking policies.\n\nUniversity personnel, students and units are required to report a COVID-19 positive test result to the COVID-19 Response and Prevention Team, regardless of vaccination status. Contact EHS to report or to familiarize yourself with UW COVID-19 policies.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns about this policy, please come speak with me.\n\nFURTHER ACCOMMODATION\n\nFor more information on disability accommodations, academic integrity, safety, and religious accommodations, please see the information linked here."
