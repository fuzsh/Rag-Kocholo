        "text": "Kenzaburo Oe\n\nKenzaburo Oe was born in 1935 in the remote mountain village of Ose on Shikoku, the smallest of Japan’s four main islands. Oe is considered one of the most dynamic and revolutionary writers to emerge in Japan after World War II, and is acknowledged as the first truly modern Japanese writer.\n\nOe is known for his powerful accounts of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and his struggle to come to terms with a mentally disabled son. His dark musings on moral failure came to symbolize an alienated generation in postwar Japan. Oe’s influences and literary heroes were less Japanese than American and European, ranging from Henry Miller to Jean-Paul Sartre, from Blake to Camus.\n\nIn 1960, Oe traveled to China where he met Mao Zedong, and the following year he traveled Paris where he met one of his influences, Jean-Paul Sartre.\n\nHis prolific body of work won almost every major international honor, including the 1989 Prix Europalia and the 1994 Nobel Prize for Literature. His many translated works include A Personal Matter (1964), Teach Us to Outgrow Our Madness (1969), The Silent Cry (1967), Hiroshima Notes (1965), and Nip the Buds, Shoot the Kids(1958).\n\nHe passed away in 2023, at the age of 88."
