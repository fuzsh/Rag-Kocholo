But this has been a strange season, weatherwise.\n\nFewer jackets are being worn than expected and it’s not unusual to see kids still in shorts. Temperatures have been way warmer than average. Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane trap the sun’s heat and have been warming Earth’s atmosphere.\n\nIt seems like a warmer Fall would alter the timing of when leaves change their color but trees seem to know better. The leaves are glowing with brilliant reds and yellows and starting to fall in huge numbers.\n\nI used to like to crunch them when I walked down the street. I still do.\n\nAhh, Autumn. It remains its beautiful self. Now it’s time to get out the rake and gather the fallen leaves.\n\nCrunch, crunch, crunch.\n\nCopyright Ferida Woolf, 2023\n\nScience of Fall Colors\n\nFor years, scientists have worked to understand the changes that occur in trees and shrubs during autumn. Although we don't know all the details, we do know enough to explain the basics to help you enjoy nature's multicolored display. Three factors influence autumn leaf color:\n\nleaf pigments\n\nlength of night\n\nweather\n\nThe timing of color changes and the onset of falling leaves is primarily regulated by the calendar as nights become longer. None of the other environmental influences – such as temperature, rainfall, food supply – are as unvarying as the steadily increasing length of night during autumn. As days grow shorter, and nights grow longer and cooler, biochemical processes in the leaf begin to paint the landscape with Nature's autumn palette.\n\nJoFreeman: Fourth Dispatch from the RNC -- Largely on Things To Do At The Convention\n\n\"The National Federation of Republican Women is the largest grassroots Republican women's organization in the country with hundreds of clubs. Founded in 1938, its members made the phone calls and knocked on the doors that elected Republican candidates for decades. It’s Tuesday luncheon featured Arkansas Governor Sarah Sanders. The Master Calendar said it was SOLD OUT and they wouldn’t let me in. I was able to get into their lounge at the Fiserv Forum Wednesday evening, where I was repeatedly asked if I was a member, and if not, would I join. “I’m press,” I said. “I can’t join anything partisan.” I then said: “What brings you here?” On hearing that, finding anyone willing to chat with me was like pulling teeth.\" Jo There’s Plenty To Do at the RNC – if you have the right credentials by Jo Freeman Every national nominating convention has plenty of auxiliary events, some authorized, some not. Getting space can be a challenge; getting th… more »\n\nSecurity at the RNC By Jo Freeman: My Second Dispatch From The Republican NC\n\n\"Even with pre-convention credentials, some places are closed. The North building of the Baird Center is open to press. The South Building is not. I was turned away completely before getting my pre-convention credentials. Once they were hanging from my neck, security let me in. I discovered that the convention committees (Platform, Bylaws, Credentials) were meeting in that side of the Baird Center. But they were closed to press. Indeed on my way out, when I happened to mention to the two Security guards that I wrote for a small online magazine, they told me that I wasn’t allowed into the South building at all. They let me in initially because I don’t look like press and they thought I was one of many volunteers.\" more »\n\nStudy Suggests Reinfections From the Virus That Causes COVID-19 Likely Have Similar Severity As Original Infection\n\nNIH-funded analysis of health record data shows severe reinfections often follow severe first infections. COVID-19 tend to foreshadow similar severity of infection the next time a person contracts the disease. Additionally, scientists discovered that long COVID was more likely to occur after a first infection compared to a reinfection. The study, funded by the National Institutes of Health’s (NIH) Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER(link is external)) Initiative, is published in Communications Medicine(link is external). more »\n\nMelting of Alaskan glaciers Shown to be Accelerating; Could Reach an Irreversible Tipping Point Earlier Than Previously Thought\n\nMelting of glaciers in a major Alaskan icefield has accelerated and could reach an irreversible tipping point earlier than previously thought, research led by Newcastle University suggests. The increased rate of glacier thinning has also been accompanied by increased glacier fragmentation... 100% of glaciers mapped in 2019 have receded relative to their position in 1770, and 108 glaciers have disappeared completely. Study lead, Dr Bethan Davies, Senior Lecturer, Newcastle University, said: “It’s incredibly worrying that our research found a rapid acceleration since the early 21st century in the rate of glacier loss across the Juneau icefield. more »"
