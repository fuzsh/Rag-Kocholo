As a 10-year-old boy during WWII, he was taught extreme devotion to the Emperor until Japan's surrender shattered this worldview. \n\n2) Over the following decades, Oe wrote over 20 novels and hundreds of stories to process this experience. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1994 for creating an \"imagined world\" addressing \"the human predicament today.\" \n\n3) Though influential among intellectuals, Oe's experimental style made his work difficult for most Japanese readers. After winning the Nobel, his books became very popular in Japan for the first time.",
