        "text": "News of author Kenzaburo Oe's death reached me a month after I had visited the former village of Ose in Ehime Prefecture where he was born and grew up.\n\nA river ran along this small mountain village and a forest loomed behind.\n\nWhen Oe was a schoolboy, there was a persimmon tree--which I could no longer locate--that inspired him to write this poem: \"A raindrop/ Reflects the scenery/ A different world/ Exists in the raindrop.\"\n\nAs Oe recalled in one of his books, he looked closely at a persimmon leaf before his eyes and saw that it was wet with dew. He saw himself reflected in a dewdrop, which made him realize he hadn't really looked at things until then.\n\n\"I became acutely aware that not paying attention to what's before my eyes is the same as not seeing anything,\" he wrote.\n\nHaving had his powers of reasoning and imagination nurtured in the mountains of Shikoku far from Tokyo, Oe went on to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1994.\n\nAnd the village of his childhood obviously influenced his sense of identity as someone \"on the periphery,\" even as a highly successful \"man of culture\" who represented Japan's postwar democracy generation.\n\nWhen Oe was new to Tokyo as a university student, local shop owners could not understand his broad dialect.\n\nAnd at school, he was mistaken for a student from Taiwan. Acutely aware of his shy and awkward personality, Oe tried to cheer himself up by defining himself as an \"exile\" who happened to have stumbled into Tokyo, and devoted himself to creative and critical writing.\n\nIn his globally acclaimed \"Man’en Gannen no Futtoboru\" (translated into English as \"The Silent Cry\"), he superimposed a riot that had occurred 100 years ago in his native village over the Anpo protests (1959-1960 and 1970) against the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty.\n\nIt was precisely his \"peripheral\" perspective that made this work wield enormous influence and shake the global perspective that placed the United States at the core.\n\nHis close relationship with postcolonial critic Edward Said (1935-2003) was also made possible by Oe's self-awareness as a peripheral person.\n\nSaid, a Palestinian, was born in Jerusalem and continued to criticize the United States after he immigrated there. Oe identified himself with Said, and held on to the position of being close to the \"center\" but maintaining distance from people in positions of authority.\n\nThe two men shared the understanding of the importance of being \"amateur intellectuals\" who, out of concern for society, stepped out of their respective specialties to think and work together.\n\nSuch an attitude was intrinsic to Oe's deep interest in the Japanese Constitution, Hiroshima and Okinawa, and also made him focus sharply on society throughout his life with his eldest son, who was born with disabilities.\n\nOe sometimes received threats of violence but never stopped speaking out.\n\nLooking at the world today, the prominence of the \"center\"--namely, powerful major nations, political authorities, majorities and urban areas--is growing greater than ever.\n\nFor people living in this day and age, there is much to be learned from the life lived by Oe, who adamantly held on to his position on the periphery.\n\n--The Asahi Shimbun, March 15"
