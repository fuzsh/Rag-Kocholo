        "text": "The world has lost a truly great humanist with the death of Kenzaburo Ōe. The Nobel prize-winning writer gave me one of my earliest and most memorable interviews as a cub journalist, back in 1998. I visited his Tokyo home with Hiromi Sasamoto of the Daily Yomiuri while he was still working on the manuscript of Chūgaeri (Somersault), his novel about a murderous Japanese religious cult inspired by Aum Shinrikyo. He had just finished the first draft, which he showed us - the handwritten characters neatly written out in page after page of small square boxes. “Now the real work - of rewriting - begins,” he said. “the final version will be very different from this.” He explained he was an organic writer, who changed his mind and work according to the situation. This approach, he pointed out, was the opposite of that taken by another great Japanese novelist Yukio Mishima who would not write the first word of a new book unless he already knew what the last word would be. Ōe was filled with admiration for Mishima’s craft but also wary. He felt Mishima imposed his art on reality, which was dangerous and led to fascism. He speculated that Mishima plotted his death years in advance, bodybuilding, writing speeches and organising a right-wing ‘Shield Society’ of handsome young men so that his doomed coup attempt would be elegant as well as dramatic. (In 1970, after the coup at a military base failed, Mishima committed Seppuku (ritual self-disembowling) and then had his aide and lover cut off his head.) Ōe, who was on the political left, said he did not believe in such constructed perfection: life was a constant struggle, a constant effort to get by and make whatever small improvements he could to his work and the lives of those around him. He was never completely satisfied, never really finished. He talked of the inspiration he took from his handicapped son Hikari (the subject of A Personal Matter, the first Ōe novel I read on the suggestion of Sharmilla Beezmohun) who is now one of Japan’s best-loved composers. He also talked of his devotion to his wife “I have only ever loved one woman and never had an affair, which made it difficult sometimes to imagine how characters in my novels felt when they did.” He was only in his sixties at the time but Ōe said he felt like the old fool in King Lear, muttering what he felt were truths and unsure if anyone was listening. As a final question, I (or maybe it was Sasamoto-San) asked about the future and the new century that was a year or two away. The lifelong pacifist predicted tensions ahead between Japan and China in Asia, as well as intensifying conflicts in the Middle East. His last words (and I paraphrase here and throughout) was along the lines of “if humanity is to survive the 21st century, what it will need more than anything else is tolerance.” Rest in peace Ōe-san. Thank you."
