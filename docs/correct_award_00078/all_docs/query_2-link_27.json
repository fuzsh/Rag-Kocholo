        "text": "Kenzaburo Oe, who has died aged 88, was the Nobel Prize-winning Japanese novelist whose work explored the profound changes in his country after 1945.\n\nPortraying a culture forced to renounce its faith in the Emperor, Oe forsook traditional modes of narrative to create a new language for a new world. If this rendered him difficult to understand and to translate (much of his work is still only available in Japanese) he was unmoved. He wrote, he said, “for Japanese readers... my generation... people who have had the same experiences.”\n\nEschewing the “vagueness” characteristic of traditional Japanese prose, he created a highly personal idiom that was arresting in the original but could appear over-written in translation. But he shaped his subject matter – war and fatherhood – into narratives condemning his country’s resurgent militarism and promoting a democratic socialism that attracted both a cult readership and establishment condemnation.\n\nFor Oe, in both his life and work, was unwilling to separate the personal and political. He caused outrage by refusing the Imperial Order of Culture on the grounds that he refused to “recognise any authority, any value, higher than democracy”, and he was once physically assaulted while giving a lecture. Unabashed, he marched against the Algerian and Vietnam wars, was a high-profile campaigner against imperialism, military or cultural, and after the 2011 Fukushima disaster joined the anti-nuclear power movement.\n\nHe also wrote a cycle of books about his son, an autistic musical genius who, he claimed, “trained” him “as a writer and a human being”. Having briefly contemplated – on his doctor’s recommendation – allowing the boy to die, Oe recanted, considering that a “disgraceful” response. Their relationship – and his son’s musical success – encouraged him to allow the possibility of redemption, a possibility that coloured his fiction and caused the novelist Henry Miller to compare him to Dostoevsky in “his range of hope and despair”.\n\nKenzaburo Oe was the authentic voice of the emasculation and anger felt by many Japanese young people in the face of defeat and occupation after the Second World War. But if many of his anti-heroes wallowed in disgust at the world in which they found themselves, that did not diminish the cross-border empathy of the novelist. His literary heroes were Mark Twain, Rabelais, Yeats, Blake and Sartre, his concerns Japanese and his syntax western. His guiding spirit was humanism.\n\nKenzaburo Oe was born on January 31 1935 in Ose, a remote village on Shikoku, a mountainous, forested island in western Japan. His mother taught him local folklore, stories that so impressed themselves upon his imagination that a mythical Shikoku – a place of primal innocence – became a recurring motif in his work.\n\nHis father was killed in 1944 and the following year Japan surrendered. Oe maintained that hearing the God-like Emperor surrendering on the radio deprived him of innocence and propelled him towards fiction.\n\nInspired by his mother’s wartime gift of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn – and consequently nursing an ambivalent attitude towards the occupying GIs and American ideals of democracy – Oe was the only one of seven siblings to leave Ose. From 1954 to 1959 he studied French at the University of Tokyo and worked as a journalist, his articles including an interview with Chairman Mao, of whom he was an ardent admirer.\n\nFrom the outset he felt his rural upbringing rendered him “peripheral” but considered this was appropriate for a writer. “Literature must be written from the periphery towards the centre, and we can criticise the centre,” he observed.\n\nHe wrote his doctoral thesis on Sartre, was profoundly influenced by the Existentialists and, having travelled to Paris, marched alongside Sartre – “a charming intellectual who kept quoting himself” – against the Algerian war in 1960. He also met the composer Toru Takemitsu, who became his tutor in “not just music, but architecture, painting, sociology... and literature”.\n\nIn 1958 he published his first short story, “The Catch”. It concerned a friendship destroyed by war between a Japanese boy and a captured black GI and won the Akutagawa Award. Nip the Buds, Shoot the Kids (1958) told the story of a group of juvenile delinquents evacuated to a village abandoned on account of the plague. Although neither date nor location specific, Oe painted a dense, visceral portrait of boys and village, dwelling on physical description and peculiar smells.\n\nAlready he was forging a prose style entirely his own. When the novel was translated into English The Sunday Telegraph complained about “clusters of words which don’t seem to belong together”. This may have been a failure of translation but might also have reflected Oe’s highly wrought prose style. The eminent American translator Edward Seidensticker recalled asking a Japanese acquaintance for an analysis of Oe only to be told: “I don’t know what it is but it isn’t Japanese.”\n\nThe Youth Who Came Too Late (1961) portrayed student life in Tokyo and betrayed his existential influences, while both Seventeen (1961) and J (1963) were accounts of youths seduced by political fanaticism whose idealism led to despair. Hikari, his first child, who was born in 1963, suffered from autism. Ignoring the doctors’ blandishments, Oe was inspired by a visit to Hiroshima, where a doctor to the nuclear survivors told him “never despair or hope too much”. A Personal Matter (1964) related the story of a father with a disabled child who seeks solace in alcohol before finding a sort of happiness after resolving to be more positive.\n\nThe Silent Cry (1967) was considered his masterpiece by the Nobel committee. Mixing social anthropology, the myths of his upbringing and his own brand of existential humanism, Oe told the story of a man with an institutionalised son and a best friend who has hanged himself returning to his childhood village to confront his past.\n\nAlthough his prose was almost wilfully obtuse – and his readership limited accordingly – Oe continued to wrestle with the interlocking themes of his co-existence with his son and the place of rural myths in city life. My Deluged Soul (1973), Teach Us to Outgrow Our Madness (1977), Rouse Up O Young Men of the New Age (1983) and A Quiet Life (1990) explored the pain and reward of his relationship with his son as he moved from adolescence towards manhood. It was a relationship that assumed enormous symbolic resonance for Oe, who cast his son as “someone who can transcend everything baleful and problematic, and turn it into something hopeful and redeemed”.\n\nWhen A Quiet Life was adapted for cinema the score was based upon Hikari’s compositions. Hikari released three classical CDs in the 1990s, the first of which sold more than 400,000 copies. “Better than any of my novels,” observed his father, “and I’m proud of that.” In a collection of essays, A Healing Family (1995), he opined that Hikari had taught him about the healing power of art, a lesson he passed on to his readers: “People find hope in his writing” observed one critic.\n\nBut within this filial relationship Oe was conscious of wider patterns. He tried to “start from my personal matters and then link it up with society, the state and the world”. Thus his relationship with Hikari served as a metaphor for “tolerance, and how the weak can play a role in fighting against violence”, and he criticised Japanese governments who increasingly “stand up with the banner of the strong”.\n\nIn the early 1990s Oe announced an intention to forsake fiction as Hirakawi had found his own voice. However the award of the Nobel Prize in 1994 forced him to reconsider. So, after using his new found fame to attack the “chronic disease” of Japan’s vacillation between Europe and Asia and its increasingly ambivalent stance towards its war record, he wrote the (untranslated) Flaming Green Tree trilogy (1993-95). A work influenced by Dante, Blake and Yeats that returned to the forest, it concerned a disabled healer who became the saviour of his people.\n\nThroughout the 1990s his fiction betrayed a more spiritual element. This culminated in Somersault (1999), which was based upon the sarin attack on the Tokyo subway by the Aum Shinrikyo Doomsday cult in 1995. Writing about the leader of an apocalyptic cult who has renounced his faith, Oe identified a clear link with the Japanese post-war renunciation of the Emperor’s divinity and the trauma of a country’s rebirth. At 600 pages it was deemed rambling by some reviewers, though the London Review of Books argued that it displayed “the architectonics of a Bruckner symphony”.\n\nIn 2005 Oe was sued for libel by two former Imperial Army officers over an essay he had written in 1970 in which he alleged that as US forces approached, Japanese soldiers had coerced many civilians in Okinawa into committing suicide. In March 2008, all charges against Ōe were dismissed, the judge in the case confirming Oe’s version of events.\n\nOe published his last novel, In Late Style, in 2013.\n\nOe was a shy, humorous, family man who split his time between the Tokyo suburbs and his cottage in the mountains, where he indulged a love of trees and swimming. His wife was an artist whose watercolours occasionally decorated his work. She was the sister of his school friend, Juzo Itami, a film director whose work included Tampopo and who committed suicide in 1997.\n\nIn addition to travelling widely Oe was a visiting professor at the Colegio de Mexico in Mexico City and the University of California at Berkeley.\n\nKenzaburo Oe married Yukari in 1960. They had two sons and a daughter.\n\nKenzaburo Oe, born January 31 1935, died March 3 2023"
