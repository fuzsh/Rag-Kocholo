        "text": "Oe won the Nobel Literature Prize in 1994, for his “darkly poetic” novels which painted a “disconcerting picture of the human predicament”, according to judges.\n\nHis work was across both fiction and essays, tackling a range of subjects from militarism and nuclear disarmament after the atomic bombing of Japan, to innocence, trauma and raising his son, who has learning difficulties.\n\nHe said of his writing: “[I] start from my personal matters and then link it up with society, the state and the world”.\n\nOe was known to be strongly influenced by both French and American writing, with some in his native Japan calling his style distinctly western, and likening him to William Faulkner.\n\nAmerican writer Henry Miller once compared Oe to Dostoevsky, noting his “range of hope and despair”. Fellow Nobel laureate Kazuo Ishiguro described Oe as being “genuinely decent, modest, surprisingly open and honest, and very unconcerned about fame”.\n\nJohn Nathan, Oe’s translator, credited him with “creating a language of his own, in the manner of Faulkner and few Japanese writers before him”.\n\nBorn in the village of Ose on the southern island of Shikoku, Oe was the fifth of seven children. He hailed from a family of wealthy landowners, who lost most of their property in the land reform policies imposed in Japan after the Second World War.\n\nHis father was killed in the war in 1944, and although Oe was ten-years-old when it ended, the conflict continued to overshadow his early life, and it became a topic he often revisited.\n\nLater in life, he said: “But for my experiences of 1945 and the subsequent years, I would never have become a novelist.”\n\nOe recalled the shame he felt as a child when he decided he wasn’t willing to die for Japan’s Emperor – a question children were asked at school daily as they were raised to believe Hirohito to be a living god. He became a fierce critic of what he called Japan’s military and economic aggression.\n\n“The humiliation took a firm grip on him and has coloured much of his work,” the Swedish Academy said. “He himself describes his writing as a way of exorcising demons,” with his novels frequently depicting a world knocked off its axis by dark, disturbing forces.\n\nIn the 1960s, Oe drew international acclaim for Hiroshima Notes – “a selection of essays about the victims of the atomic bomb, and the valiant efforts of those who cared for them”.\n\nHiroshima Notes were published on the same day as Kojinteki-na taiken (A Personal Matter), which is described as “a darkly humorous account of a new father’s struggle to accept the birth of his brain-damaged child.” For Oe, the two works were inextricably linked.\n\n“I wanted to reconstruct myself, my family, so I wanted to consider the Hiroshima people who wanted to reconstruct their lives after the disaster.\n\n“I was always encouraged by the doctors at Hiroshima fighting against their death.”\n\nIn 1963, Oe’s son Hikari underwent surgery after being born with a brain hernia. The ensuing procedure left Hikari with learning difficulties.\n\nHe later admitted to once wishing for his son’s death – calling it a “disgraceful” thought, that “no powerful detergent has allowed me to wash out of my life.”"
