        "text": "Inspired by French literature and his own family, Kenzaburo Oe was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature 1994 for creating “an imagined world, where life and myth condense to form a disconcerting picture of the human predicament today.” Oe was the first person in his family to leave their village of Ose-mura. His family had lived in the village tradition for several hundred years, and the women in the Oe clan told stories about the historical events and legends of the region, which left an indelible mark on him. The Second World War broke out when Oe was six and changed his trajectory in numerous ways. Militaristic education was de rigour in every school, with the Emperor as both monarch and deity reigning over the country’s politics and its culture. Young Oe, therefore, experienced the nation’s myth and history as well as those of the village tradition, and these dual experiences were often in conflict. Sadly, his father died during the war, but his mother bought him escapist books such as ‘The Strange Adventures of Nils Holgersson’, which left a lasting impression. In 1945, Japan’s defeat brought enormous change and democratic principles replaced those of the absolutist Emperor systems in classrooms. Inspired by the promise of democracy and the opportunities and freedoms it affords, Oe set a course for Tokyo and left the village of his forefathers. At Tokyo University Oe avidly consumed contemporary French and American literature, while his mentor’s thoughts on humanism gave him a new lens through which to examine the stories handed down to him by the women in his village. Oe made his debut in the 1950s with short stories. Several of his books deal with the aftermath of World War II and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, while disability is a recurring motif in many of his stories after one of his sons was born with brain damage. His novel, ‘A Personal Matter’, was a way for the author to process and accept this event. Learn more about his remarkable life: https://lnkd.in/ep6kwpm7"
