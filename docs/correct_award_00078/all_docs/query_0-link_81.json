        "text": "TOKYO, Japan – Kenzaburo Oe, who won Japan its second Nobel Prize for literature with books about pacifism and his disabled son, has died.\n\nHis death on March 3 at the age of 88 was due to old age, his publisher Kodansha said.\n\nTen years old when Japan was defeated in World War Two, Oe was scarred by his memories, which included being asked in school every day if he was willing to die for the Emperor and feeling shame when realizing in bed at night that he wasn’t."
