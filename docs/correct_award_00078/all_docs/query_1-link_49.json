        "text": "Strongly influenced by French and American literature, he was known for his powerful accounts of the atomic bombing of Japan and coping with his son, who has learning difficulties.\n\nHe won the Nobel Literature Prize in 1994, with judges praising his \"darkly poetic\" novels for their \"disconcerting picture of the human predicament\".\n\nHis death, on 3 March, was due to old age, his publisher Kodansha said.\n\nBorn in a village on Japan's southern island of Shikoku, Oe came from a family of wealthy landowners who lost most of their property due to a land reform imposed after the Second World War.\n\nOe was 10 when the war ended, and his early life was overshadowed by the conflict.\n\nAt school, he was asked if he was willing to die for the Emperor every day, and he remembered feeling shame in bed at night when he decided that he wasn't.\n\nAfter Japan's surrender in 1945, he became fascinated by the democratic principles espoused by the occupying forces, and later became a fierce critic of what he called Japan's military and economic aggression.\n\n\"The humiliation took a firm grip on him and has coloured much of his work,\" the Swedish Academy said. \"He himself describes his writing as a way of exorcising demons,\" with his novels frequently depicting a world knocked off its axis by dark, disturbing forces."
