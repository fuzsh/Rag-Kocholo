Born into a musical family in Toronto, Jane Child took violin lessons from her father and voice lessons from her mother. Rock wasn’t allowed in her home, but she did listen to an R&B station from nearby Buffalo, NY, and had hopes of starting a band. Child dropped out of the Royal Conservatory of Music to join a rock band in Toronto. Signed to Warner Music in 1988 on the strength of just a demo tape, Jane Child released her first single, “Don’t Wanna Fall in Love,” in 1990. Her self-titled debut album appeared that same year. The self titled debut album was a pleasant excursion into synthesized dance-pop that was distinguished by the ingratiatingly catchy single, “Don’t Wanna Fall in Love.” A handful of other songs on the album — including the minor hit “Welcome to the Real World” — demonstrated Child’s skills as a pop craftswoman, but just as many fell flat.
