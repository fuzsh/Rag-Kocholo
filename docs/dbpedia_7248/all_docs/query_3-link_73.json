        "text": "What do you collect, and why?\n\nMost of my records are by lesser-known female artists dating back to the 60s. While running a label and working with a reissue label (Bird/ Finders Keepers) I’ve heard a lot of great stuff by accident because I’m around other people who are obsessed by records and films and know how to find obscurities. Soundtrack music is something I’m really fond of too, Morricone feat Edda D’ell Orso, Liska, Nino Rota, Jean Claude Vannier and unreleased library cues from favourite old TV shows like The Prisoner.\n\nI’m currently into collecting Lebanese music and Eastern orchestral strings records, mainly female vocals, like Sabah, Warda, Fairouz; I love the inflection and intonation of the voice, a lot of the stuff in this arena that I like is traditional or soundtrack, so not necessarily heavy or “funky”. A lot of these records are live concert recordings so you can often hear the audience in the background sometimes joining in with the chorus. Even though they can be quite crudely recorded you can often imagine you are sat in the crowd listening to this very emotional and darkly powerful music. It can be frustrating to not know what the lyrics are, but when I do sometimes translate stuff the songs are generally quite traditional and folky so it’s all very innocent but still poetically beautiful.\n\nMy penchant for Eastern music started when my husband (Andy Votel) found an amazing 7” on the floor in a Turkish market stall. The orchestral arrangement gave me shivers and déjà vu in equal measures and it became one of the best mystery records I’d ever heard. For years we couldn’t find out who it was by and though I knew it wasn’t Turkish or Lebanese, I started looking for similar records before discovering it was a soundtrack by an Egyptian singer… this was essentially the gateway drug for me!\n\nHow big is your collection?\n\nProbably a small market stall’s worth, I’ve got a few cupboards full of stuff spread across different rooms but I’ve never counted. I’ve also accidentally accumulated a vast amount of heavy rock and pop records over the years to DJ with, but sometimes I can’t even look at them because they are so ruined from DJing while hammered (and then there’s the classic story of a drunk student knocking a whole pint into my record box). My house is full of records. I get overwhelmed sometimes. Between my record collection and my husband’s, they have a habit of taking up a lot of our living space, especially if we both have stock from our own releases in the house too, it’s almost as if they are breeding.\n\nWhat do you think it is worth?\n\nI have no idea what my personal collection is worth. I don’t really care what things are valued at and I don’t like to wait around for Mint copies, though it has to be listenable. We recently upgraded our speakers from these cool Grundig space balls from the 70s that I found in Cash Converters to ultra-sensitive modern speakers which are amazing but you can hear every pop and crackle now. I’m protective over my nice bits though, and have to keep them safe and out of harm’s way (see next question).\n\nHow and where do you store it?\n\nI have to be very careful and try and keep my records in their own accessible space because our house is already a disorganised library of records and books. I keep my LPs behind the doors of some teak mid-century cupboards otherwise they’ll disappear into the abyss and it can be ages before I find them again. I often have to rescue Yoko Ono, and my Plastics’ 7” Robot/Copy has been going missing for years and now it just looks dog-eared.\n\nWhat’s the rarest/most unusual/most valuable item you have?\n\nI’ve got a signed Wendy & Bonnie record, which I got after doing a song and some shows with Wendy Flower years ago. It’s probably not that rare by some readers’ standards but because Wendy and I became friends I hold it close to my heart. When I met Claudio Simonetti, I got him to sign a lesser-known Goblin 7” for me. He was very sweet. Other records that I value on a more personal level are things like a Joy Division box set given to me by my friend and label boss Rob Gretton around the late 90s, before he passed away.\n\nWhat elusive gem are you looking for?\n\nMy vinyl expeditions are strictly uncharted, I don’t buy trophies. I want to learn about more unknown orchestral Egyptian stuff, please.\n\nWhat’s given you the biggest thrill?\n\nDiscovering certain Arabic vocalists, this whole world of music that I didn’t know much about, but I’m taking my time and savouring it.\n\nHow do you track stuff down?\n\nI go to record shops when I’m travelling, time permitting. Otherwise I send want-lists to Utrecht twice a year. Very occasionally I’ll still use eBay.\n\nWhat’s your favourite record shop?\n\nMy favourite shop has always been Cob Records in Porthmadog, Wales. There’s a few strange second hand record shops in Athens I’ve been to which are great. I like going to Amoeba when I’m in LA, though it’s huge and you need a long time in there. If I want anything contemporary I either buy direct from the artist, or from Piccadilly Records in Manchester.\n\nHow often do you listen to the stuff in your collection?\n\nI listen to music every single day, but I do a lot of journeys by car or van so that reduces my listening to CD and digital formats, though I’m not a vinyl purest.\n\nIs there a visual side to collecting for you?\n\nI do love a record cover with just a female face on it, like those by Yoko Ono, Gal Costa, or Fairouz, among others.\n\nHow will you eventually dispose of your collection?\n\nThere are some records I’ll never part with but my collection is more about collecting sounds and information for production so it changes and I do let stuff go now and again. I traded Kate Bush’s Ariel for a load of Lebanese records. I felt a bit funny about it at the time but it was a creative decision. I guess I will leave my collection with the kids, but even they have their own mini record collections now.\n\nWhat’s your all-time favourite record, regardless of value or rarity?"
