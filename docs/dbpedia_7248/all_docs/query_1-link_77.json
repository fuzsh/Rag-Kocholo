        "text": "Show business is often a business, first and foremost, and the entertainment industry is usually run by businessmen. But what happens when the showmen takeover and seize the means of production? To gain creative control, Charlie Chaplin, director D.W. Griffith, “America’s Sweetheart” Mary Pickford and swashbuckler Douglas Fairbanks formed United Artists in 1919. Half a century later, that blazing nova of the electric guitar, Jimi Hendrix, followed suit by creating his own recording studio a couple of blocks from his home in Lower Manhattan. This innovative experience in artistic control is meticulously recounted in director/co-producer John McDermott’s new Electric Lady Studios: A Jimi Hendrix Vision.\n\nThis insightful and entertaining 90-minute documentary reveals how the lack of a liquor license wrought one of rock’s greatest aesthetic experiments, an excursion into genius. McDermott is a veteran filmmaker who has produced and/or directed many rock docs, such as 2023’s Carole King Home Again: Live in Central Park, although he has specialized in rendering documentaries out of the voluminous material the prolific Hendrix left behind, keeping the guitarist’s legacy vividly alive. Electric Lady Studios skillfully interweaves mostly original interviews with sound engineers, producers, technicians and rockers with extensive archival footage of Hendrix’s dazzling concert performances.\n\nElectric Lady Studios: A Jimi Hendrix Vision imparts a “you are there” vibe that takes us behind the scenes as the visionary Hendrix strives to achieve total command over his prodigious expressive output, from writing to recording to guitar-slinging as the fastest guitarist in the Wild West of rock and roll, the West Village and beyond. McDermott’s nonfiction visual and sonic experience is arguably a case study in what happens when the so-called “lunatics” take over the asylum – and the musical magic they can render. John McDermott was interviewed by phone at his home office in Newton, Massachusetts.\n\nRock Cellar: When I was a teenager growing up in New York City, I often passed by the curved brick wall between the 8th Street Playhouse and Marlboro Bookstore on West 8th Street in Greenwich Village. But I had no idea what the heck it was.\n\nJohn McDermott: [Laughs.]\n\nRock Cellar: But it stood out in my memory. Tell us about the history of that space and how that curved wall came about?\n\nJohn McDermott: In 1968, there was a club called the Generation that, when you watch the film, you see Jimi Hendrix watching Buddy Guy perform. That’s effectively [what became] Electric Lady Studios; that was the Generation Club. But it was unable to secure a liquor license, so they went belly up. Michael Jeffery, Jimi’s manager, owned nightclubs in Mallorca, Spain, and he’d owned nightclubs in Newcastle [northeast England]. So, he was certainly well-versed with that business.\n\nJimi loved to jam; he was spending lots of time at the Scene Club and other clubs, jamming with people he wanted to collaborate with, play with. So they bought the lease for $50,000 and the idea was, they were going to build a nightclub and they would have a small recording unit to record Jimi’s jams. Or, if he just wanted to use it and would have a place to put some ideas down, he’d have a quiet space.\n\nPretty soon, Jim Marron, who was the maître d’ of the Scene, was asked by Michael Jeffery to take over and become the project manager. But Jim said: “You’re never going to get a liquor license and the mob controls this area.” … Jim reached out to [producer/engineer] Eddie Kramer to get his opinion … and he said: “You’re crazy. This should be a recording studio for Jimi. We spend so much money every year on making recordings, he might as well own his own place.”\n\nSo, that turned the whole thing around and it went from being a nightclub to being a formal recording studio. Because Jimi was still with the Experience at the time and was the leading concert act in the world, it didn’t seem to be too far afield to fund a project like that. Of course, a few months later Noel [Redding, bass player] leaves the band [Jimi Hendrix Experience], Jimi stops touring and all other kinds of problems emerge, and it becomes a problem to keep the dream alive.\n\nRock Cellar: Steve Winwood recalls in your film that at the time, “only corporations had studios.” And Eddie Kramer says “Jimi had to have total control.” Tell us about the impact it had for an individual artist – as opposed to the “suits,” the executives – to be in control of a recording studio?\n\nJohn McDermott: Hendrix was unique in lots of ways. His unique talent and appeal allowed his manager and lawyer to change rock touring, to change rock merchandising, how much the artist got. With the recording studio, it was a very similar thing in that Jimi was not a very materialistic guy. Yes, he had a Corvette, but he lived in a two-bedroom apartment in Greenwich Village. It wasn’t as if he had a Graceland, an enormous property, or anything like that. For him, the idea of having a studio was exciting, to have a creative space solely dedicated to him. Keep in mind that three years earlier he was broke, out of work, trying to hustle to odd jobs as a sideman guitarist. In 1966, before [bassist] Chas [Chandler] took him to England, he was playing in the Village for small money. By 1969, when studio construction breaks down at 252 West 8th Street, he’s the biggest touring artist in the world.\n\nBecause of that quick ascension, he wasn’t like the Beatles, signed in 1962, to a label, which owned its own recording studio – however iconic Abbey Road was, it was still even hard for the Beatles to go to various places. It wasn’t until they had tremendous success that they were able to go to Olympic and other studios to try things out. With Jimi, he was somebody, they looked at this as an opportunity, if we make a Studio A and Studio B, Jimi will use Studio A, and we won’t be using a recording studio owned by a corporation or record label, [paying] hundreds of thousands of dollars a year he could be putting into his own facility. It would have been unthinkable in ’65, ’66 for an artist to do that – producers did that. Atlantic, Capitol, Columbia, Stax, labels and producers, had their own studios, but certainly not a rock artist like Jimi Hendrix. He was unique and unafraid to be the first.\n\nClick here to pick up Electric Lady Studios: A Jimi Hendrix Vision on 3-CD/Blu-ray set from our Rock Cellar Store\n\nClick here to pick up Electric Lady Studios: A Jimi Hendrix Vision on 5-LP/Blu-ray set from our Rock Cellar Store\n\nRock Cellar: Electric Lady Studios: A Jimi Hendrix Vision includes lots of archival footage, as well as original material. Was the interview with Winwood done by you?\n\nJohn McDermott: Yes.\n\nRock Cellar: Let’s talk about some of the others interviewed by you in the film?\n\nJohn McDermott: We tried to get everyone who had a significant role who was still living to tell this story. Thankfully, we were successful. We did have a couple of people who had passed, such as [Jimi Hendrix Experience drummer] Mitch Mitchell, but I had interviewed Mitch about Electric Lady [previously], so we had those clips we could draw on for the film … Mitch and Noel and [bassist] Billy [Cox] were phenomenal musicians. To have been able to keep up and contribute in the way they did to Jimi’s success by supporting him, by being a foundation for his artistry, his writing, his music – I’ve heard many a jam where people just aren’t anywhere in the same atmosphere, let alone in the “club” of the studio.\n\nHe inspired those around him, he surrounded himself with loyal people who were dedicated to him that allowed these ideas. Even early on he had the talent, but Chas Chandler helped him understand the parameters of commercial music. How to edit his songs, how to present himself. Chas had been a successful artist as part of the Animals and he imparted some of that experience to Jimi, in molding him to come out of the chute so fast in the UK. Jimi inspired things and he drew on the commitment and support from a very tight network of people he had around him.\n\nRock Cellar: Was the interview you did with Billy Cox original?\n\nJohn McDermott: Yes, we did that at Electric Lady.\n\nRock Cellar: What was the difference between Studio A and Studio B at Electric Lady?\n\nJohn McDermott: Studio B was not finished during Jimi’s lifetime. Jimi worked exclusively in A – when he went to Maui, for example, that opened up a window of time and Eddie Kramer brought Carly Simon in [to record]. Prior to that, there were some sessions that Jerry Brandt had organized for the Voices of East Harlem. Eddie had a longstanding relationship with Peter Frampton and Humble Pie, so he did some mixing for their live album at the Fillmore [Performance: Rockin’ the Fillmore]. They worked in some things; there were some other sessions during the summer, but they were recorded in A. B wasn’t completed until around the time Jimi died.\n\nIn terms of people who worked in B, there were a great many artists. Because once the studio got going you tended to have longer bookings in A. Shorter things – jingles, ads, tracking sessions were done in B, once it was alive.\n\nRock Cellar: How long did it take to build Electric Lady Studios?\n\nJohn McDermott: Fourteen months … They were beset by cash flow problems; the Minetta Brook flowing under the studio. They definitely had lots of issues that slowed the progress down. At the end of the day, that 14-month window, with a remarkably small crew, created a place today which is effectively operational … Studio A is still that amazing sounding room that was built 55 years ago.\n\nRock Cellar: How much did it cost in 1969 dollars?\n\nJohn McDermott: $1.1 million by the time it was done. It was a tremendous amount of money at that time. As we make clear in the film, Jimi took out a loan and actually made the first $50,000 payment on that loan in 1970. His royalties were such that that was deemed manageable for him to make 10 payments of $50,000 to Warner Bros.\n\nI know that Eddie Kramer let Led Zeppelin in for some mixing and overdubbing on some things during that summer, it really was still predominantly used by Jimi in the summer of 1970. As a studio they really started to earn money by 1971 … Then they had longtime clients like Stevie Wonder come in, which was really a boon for the studio. That in turn brought a lot of people in, as well. It was Jimi’s place, now frequented by talents like Stevie Wonder, and that really helped to bring people into the facility.\n\nRock Cellar: You mentioned a “cash flow problem” and Electric Lady Studios: A Jimi Hendrix Vision has funny anecdotes relating to that.\n\nJohn McDermott: Jimi was an instrument that changed rock band touring, particularly in late ’68, ’69, when they started the 90-10 split, where a local promoter got 10% and Jimi kept the 90. He was really the leading touring act in ’69, so they needed cash and he came back from the LA Forum in April, 1969 to Electric Lady with $100,000 in shopping bags and said to Jim Marron: “Okay, pay the carpenters and plumbers, keep this thing going.”\n\n… He would go to Mickey Ruskin at Max’s Kansas City and say, “Hey, float this check for me for a couple of days until we make a deposit.”\n\nRock Cellar: John, did you ever actually meet Hendrix?\n\nJohn McDermott: No … The first major Jimi Hendrix project I ever did was a book with Eddie Kramer in 1992 called Hendrix: Setting the Record Straight, the genesis for a lot of the work I’ve done since … When I did that, the Electric Lady story was fascinating. How Wild West this idea was – “OK, we’ll just build a studio” … I always thought this would be the basis for a really interesting documentary.\n\nRock Cellar: Which songs and albums did Hendrix actually record at Electric Lady Studios?\n\nJohn McDermott: He’d been building up material in 1969, knowing the studio was coming. Songs like “Room Full of Materials” and “Ezy Rider,” which were started at the Record Plant, and then Jimi brought all of those tapes over to his studio. He and Eddie Kramer gathered and would say, “I want to put a guitar overdub on this or a bass overdub on this,” so we know we’ve got that stuff.\n\nBut in terms of building songs up from the ground, “Freedom,” “Dolly Dagger,” “Night Bird Flying,” “Drifting,” “Angel,” these were the songs that first appeared posthumously on The Cry of Love. Because by the time Jimi actually got to record in Electric Lady Studios, all of the four albums he’d put out – not including Smash Hits, which was a compilation – were already in the marketplace. So, he was hard at work at what was supposed to have been a double record called First Rays of the New Rising Sun. He never lived to finish it; we really don’t know what the final track listing would have been. But those songs he was working on, “In From the Storm,” “Astro Man,” “Straight Ahead,” “Hey Baby,” all of those were what he considered to be his next record.\n\nRock Cellar: In Electric Lady Studios: A Jimi Hendrix Vision there’s archival footage of Jimi performing at various places.\n\nJohn McDermott: I chose 1970 performances. Jimi at Berkeley in May, 1970, Jimi at the Isle of Wight in August, 1970. Some footage from his very last concert at the Isle of Fehmarn in Germany. I wanted to present him in that period, I didn’t think it was appropriate to just have some random footage of him at Monterey, three years earlier. Different band, head space, set list, so what you see in the film is 1970 …There’s only photos of Jimi in the studio, there’s no moving footage. They are by a Village Voice photographer and Eddie Kramer, who was a camera buff, took some snaps [inside Electric Lady Studios].\n\nRock Cellar: For younger readers unfamiliar with Jimi Hendrix, what was the essential role he played in rock history?\n\nJohn McDermott: Jimi Hendrix was the most creatively free artist I’ve ever encountered. Somebody given the gift of opportunity, who didn’t walk through the door — he ran through the door. Never was satisfied with his sound, and continued to grow artistically at a rate equal to his unchecked talent. He’s not just a guitar player, he’s a great writer and innovative collaborator. He’s a singularly unique artist within the genre of popular culture.\n\nWhen R&B and pop music were the predominant music happening in the sixties, he still felt the blues were the true American root music. He was trying to push electric blues forward. You hear Curtis Mayfield and Muddy Waters in his playing. He understood a broad range of influences and he worked them in to make this truly singular, unique style, and 54 years later he still resonates in a very, very powerful way.\n\nRock Cellar: Who is Janie Hendrix?\n\nJohn McDermott: Janie Hendrix is the president and CEO of Experience Hendrix, the company Jimi’s late father, Al Hendrix, started in 1995. That’s the company I’ve worked with on virtually every project since then. Jimi owned his music publishing and master recordings, so they’re not controlled by various labels. Al passed away; his daughter, Janie, now runs the company and has done do for many years. All aspects of the Jimi Hendrix legacy are looked after by the company he started, Experience Hendrix. Electric Lady Studios: A Jimi Hendrix Vision is Experience Hendrix’s production and Janie is the co-producer, with myself and George Scott.\n\nRock Cellar: Who owns Electric Lady Studios today?\n\nJohn McDermott: Jimi’s father sold out his share to Jimi’s manager, Jimi’s original partner, in 1973 … who ironically died shortly afterward in a plane crash. The studio was sold a couple of times, and presently there’s an Electric Lady LLC and it’s managed by Lee Foster, who’s been there for many years and is now a part owner and has had tremendous success bringing contemporary artists to the studio to keep that vibe alive. Jimi is a major draw as part of that, because people know Jimi built this place for the express purpose of creating great music.\n\nJohn Mayer, Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, the Rolling Stones – there’s a tremendous amount of music being made there. In many ways, it’s an experience to record there. Like Abbey Road, it has such a storied history that people want some of that magic.\n\nRock Cellar: Tell us about the previous Hendrix films you directed?\n\nJohn McDermott: 2020’s Music, Money, Madness… Jimi Hendrix in Maui showcases the performance Jimi gave at the base of the volcano and has long been a fan favorite. Previously, years ago I found the original negative to Jimi’s Atlanta Pop Festival performance on July 4, 1970 … headlining at an audience bigger than Woodstock [in 2015’s Jimi Hendrix Electric Church] … [These films] fill in the story, because we don’t have Jimi the artist here to articulate that … We’re sharing as much Jimi as we can …\n\nRock Cellar: What’s your favorite Hendrix song?\n\nJohn McDermott: I don’t know that I have a favorite, but I must say that I do like the music I first heard – “Freedom,” “Cry of Love,” “Hendrix in the West.” I thought they were remarkable and led me backward to “Electric Ladyland,” “Are You Experienced.” I always enjoyed that later period – they still hold up really well, and it’s amazing that it’s as fresh and innovative as when they came out…\n\nRock Cellar: Tell us about some of the other films you’ve produced?\n\nJohn McDermott: Every Hendrix Experience release since ’96 or ’97. In addition, I’ve directed a film for Buddy Guy called My Time After a While. Together with David Peck I did the American Folk Blues Festival series of programs. I co-produced Eric Clapton and Steve Winwood at Madison Square Garden.\n\nRock Cellar: Do you want to add anything?\n\nJohn McDermott: … Electric Lady gave Jimi what he always wanted: A stable, secure place to go in and develop his material. He didn’t write or read music, so he used recording to continually do self-editing, to do rewrites, and winnowing down his songs to where they needed to be.\n\nThis is a guy who inspires people because he’s so free. He didn’t follow a trend, he didn’t take the safe route, he just took his route. It’s remarkable there’s that much high-quality music in three and a half years."
