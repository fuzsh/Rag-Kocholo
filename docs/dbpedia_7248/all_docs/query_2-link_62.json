Smith got a great reaction this year at Country Thunder Arizona, where he led his bandmates in a set that owed as much to modern rock as country. And the gritty twang in his voice felt right at home on songs that played more to his rock side, from the raspier moments of “Sleeve” to the throat-shredding cover of “My Hero,” a Foo Fighters song that had plenty of people in cowboy hats shouting along.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Wednesday, Aug. 7.

The Line of Best Fit praised the end result as “elemental pop infused with PTSD, a vanilla shake laced with a thimbleful of battery acid.” She’s joined by Babebee and Veronica Everheart.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Wednesday, Aug. 7.

Pleasure Cult is on the dreamy side of indie-pop topped by the breathtaking vocals of Honey Danger, who brings a sultry soulfulness to the proceedings.

It helps that Crockett's brand of old-school honky-tonk is effortlessly filtered through a vintage Southern soul aesthetic that AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine was spot-on to suggest \"could be mistaken for a product of FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, not an album originating from a small studio in Austin, Texas.\"\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Monday, Aug. 12.

Arizona Ave. $56-$86. 480-782-2680, chandlercenter.org.\n\nShaboozey\n\nThis alt-country viral sensation is certainly making the most of 2024, collaborating with Beyonce on two \"Cowboy Carter\" tracks and topping Billboard's Hot 100 with \"A Bar Song (Tipsy)\" a contagious blurring of the lines between country and hip-hop from his breakthrough album \"Where I've Been, Isn't Where I'm Going.\" Rolling Stones praised the album as \"a full-on barrage of post-genre possibilities,\" saying Shaboozey \"comes across like someone raised on country who also appreciates hip hop.
