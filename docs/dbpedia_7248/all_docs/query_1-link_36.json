        "text": "The first Warner Brothers label was gray with black printing. The WB shield logo is in yellow and black above the center hole. A white \"WARNER BROTHERS' is above the logo. This label was used from the start of the label until late 1962, approximately number 1470. Promotional labels were white with black print, with the logo and some of the other generic lettering in green. From the start, Warner Brothers stereo labels were gold with black print, with a black WB logo at the top with a red outline around it. Early stereo issues were also sealed in a polyethylene bag advertising the unique stereo record inside."
