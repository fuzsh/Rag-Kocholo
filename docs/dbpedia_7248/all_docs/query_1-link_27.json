        "text": "If you enjoy the music on MY105.3, I'm going to assume that you really enjoy (more specifically) the music we play from the 80s and 90s. If that assumption is true, then I should also assume that you especially enjoy our weekly Throwback Thursday competition.\n\nREAD MORE: If You Hear \"Code Brown\" at an Indiana Walmart, Leave Immediately\n\nHow Our Throwback Thursday Competition Works\n\nEach Thursday morning, Liberty and I choose an old-school song, something from the 80s or 90s. The goal is to get the most votes for your song, so in order to do that, we both plead our cases around 7:35am. After that, the outcome is out of our hands - you determine the winner by voting on Facebook, AppChat, or on the phone. We play the winning song on the air at 8:10am. There is one caveat when it comes to choosing our songs. The previous week's winner gets to choose whatever song their little heart desires. The previous week's loser, however, forfeits the right to choose a song and must ask our listeners for help. The loser then picks a song from all those that get suggested.\n\nREAD MORE: Here are 25 Indoor Activities for Kids in Southern Indiana This Winter\n\nSong #1\n\nRobyn may have a bunch of hits in her homeland of Sweden, but here in America, she has to be considered a one-hit wonder, and this is that one hit.\n\nSong #2\n\nHer name might not be very memorable, but her look certainly was. Jane Child was one of the most unique-looking artists back in the late 80s, and she gave us this great, and underrated hit.\n\nBe sure to listen next Thursday at 7:35am when we plead our cases for two more songs, and then be sure to vote for the one you want to hear. We will play the winner at 8:10am."
