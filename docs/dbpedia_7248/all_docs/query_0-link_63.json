        "text": "I'll be honest, i had not heard of this girl. Apparently the 1st artist Warner Bros. signed since Prince that had total control over their work.\n\nI discovered her via the popular game, GTAV (you may of heard of it) as she's on one of the radio stations with this infectious pop treat:-\n\nI like this one from her debut album too.\n\nSo sad about her career, as she was very talented. Her website has not been updated since 2007, and she's not made a public appearance since being on the Wayne Brady Show back in 2004. A friend of mine was her principle photographer and said she went downhill with severe depression after her father died and was never able to get over it. He said she was in the habit of not leaving her home for months on end and not even leaving her bedroom for weeks at a time. As a longtime fan, I was always hoping she'd make a comeback... or at least a new CD since \"surge\" in 2002.\n\n^^\n\nThat's so sad to hear. I always wondered what happened to her. That first album was the shiznit. DWFIL was everywhere. Pop radio, R&B radio, MTV, BET...EVERYWHERE! \"Welcome To The Real World\" got a considerable amount of play too. The second album came and went barely noticed. I don't remember there being much, if any, promotion for it. I used to see it in the Columbia House Record Club catalogs. I eventually ordered it. The only song I remember liking at the time was \"Do Whatcha Do\". I'm gonna have to track down 'Here Not There' and give it another listen. She's a very talented lady. Wherever she's at I hope she's doing well.\n\nSo sad to read about what she has been going through. I hope she gets better.\n\nHer song was one of my favorites in 1990. I loved that song, and the radio played it all the time.\n\nBlaqueKnight said:\n\nJane is a pure badass. I love her work. I have a couple of unreleased cuts from her. She had a great grasp of mixing styles and I don't think her sound was as \"Prince-influenced\" as some people think.\n\nPurists of the genre may laugh, but I imagine Jane, on her first album anyway, was listening to some industrial stuff like Ministry etc... certainly her debut album is not in general as light hearted or commercial as \"Don't wanna fall in love\".\n\nShe was a master of programming synths and producing. Very technically accomplished. Her 2nd album was all over the place and has a feeling of too much meddling by the execs. Her debut is much more cohesive production wise.\n\nThe synth solo on\" Don't wanna...\" is killer bytheway. Again played by Jane.\n\nHeres a cover co produced by David Frank of all people! It sticks close to the original and it's not as bad as it should be LOL. Her voice needs beefing up on the track though. Either by pro backing singers or something (of course pro backing singers are too \"expensive\" these days )"
