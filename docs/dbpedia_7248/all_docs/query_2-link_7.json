        "text": "Sara May grew up on a dirt road just outside a small Ontario town known for its Honda plant and Potato Festival. Over the course of ten indie-leaning, alt-country tracks on Legacy, her latest album as Falcon Jane, she expounds on that origin story through the great archetypes of country music: the drinker, the vagabond, the absent father.\n\nShe presents these characters with a clarity and empathy that feels almost transgressiveâa loving touch that crosses our rural / urban divides. But these are Saraâs stories too: her rural childhood, her move to Toronto, her current home in the working class town of Shelburne, and her life on the road.\n\nShe comes by it honest.\n\nAnd the transformation on Legacy isnât just lyrical. Alongside producer JosÃ© Contreras (By Divine Right), Falcon Jane refine their soundâpushing toward folk and country like contemporaries Waxahatchee and Angel Olsen. Mayâs voice, the one constant from 2015âs Alive n Well EP, through the dream pop of her 2018 debut album Feelinâ Freaky, to the sprawling indie rock of 2020âs Faith, is more powerful here, sitting atop the warm, Nashville-leaning production. The result is both striking and blindingly obvious: Sara May has found her way back home."
