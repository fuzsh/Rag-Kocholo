Records. An album pre-order launches today (March 10th).\n\nSheezus is the British pop singer’s first album since 2009’s acclaimed It’s Not Me, It’s You. The album finds her re-teaming with her long-time collaborator Greg Kurstin (Tegan & Sara, P!nk), with the exception of the title track, which was produced by DJ Dahi, and “Air Balloon,” which was produced by Shellback.\n\nAt the end of 2013, Lily released two songs simultaneously – her cover of Keane’s “Somewhere Only We Know,” which reached No. 1 in the U.K. and the download-only track “Hard Out Here,” which charted in the British Top 10 that same week.\n\nSince emerging in 2006 with her iconic debut single “Smile,” Lily Allen has gone on to sell over five million albums worldwide. Her huge success in the U.K. not only quickly spread around the world but also helped shift the musical axis toward young female artists.\n\nHer talent as a songwriter was acknowledged in 2010 when she won three Ivor Novello Awards. That same year she announced she was taking a break from making and performing music. In 2013 Lily returned to the studio, having spent the previous three years raising her young family and establishing her own record label.\n\nThe track-listing for Sheezus is as follows:\n\nSheezus\n\nL8 CMMR\n\nAir Balloon\n\nOur Time\n\nInsincerely Yours\n\nTake My Place\n\nAs Long As I Got You\n\nURL Badman\n\nSilver Spoon\n\nLife For Me\n\nHard Out Here\n\nFor more on Lily Allen:\n\nhttp://www.lilyallenmusic.com/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/LilyAllen\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/lilyallen\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/lilyallen\n\nhttp://instagram.com/lilyallen\n\nhttp://lilyallenmusic.tumblr.com\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/lilyallen\n\nLinkin Park, the multi-platinum, Grammy-award winning band, and their record label, Warner Brothers Records, have teamed up with Shazam® to premiere their brand new single, “Guilty All The Same,” which features a guest performance by Rakim.\n\nShazam® announced on March 6th that Linkin Park and Warner Bros. Records, are launching the band’s new single “Guilty All The Same” (feat. Rakim), and are giving Shazamers around the world the first chance to hear the song. When users Shazam-ed any song, they saw a special link to hear the new Linkin Park track, allowing them the ability to buy it from all major digital retailers after wider release Friday.\n\nOn Tuesday, March 4, Linkin Park also announced the “Carnivores” tour with Thirty Seconds To Mars and special guest AFI, which kicks off on August 8th in West Palm Beach, FL, and crisscrosses North America before wrapping up on September 19th in Concord, CA.

Records, Blak And Blu. Originally nominated in two categories (“Best Rock Song” for “Ain’t Messin ‘Round,” as well as “Best Traditional R&B Performance” for “Please Come Home”), Gary Clark Jr.’s nominations mark the first time in Grammy history that a single artist has been nominated in two different genre categories simultaneously from one album in the same year.\n\nIn addition, Clark turned in an incendiary performance with Keith Urban on the live Grammy broadcast trading lead vocals and guitar solos on Urban’s “Cop Car”, from his current album.\n\nClark will be heading out on the road with Kings Of Leon beginning Feb 5th, in Atlanta and wind up the tour March 8th, in Chicago.

The band joins fellow artists in MTV’s class of 2014 which includes Chvrches, Bastille, Danny Brown, Fifth Harmony, Jake Miller and more.\n\nLaunched last year, MTV’s “Artist to Watch” campaign connects fans and artists across every screen. Every two weeks, MTV will select and then feature a new “Artist to Watch” to be showcased across MTV’s various television channels (including MTV, MTV2, mtvU, MTV Hits and MTV Jams), websites/apps (including MTV.com, MTV Artists, MTV News,) and social networks (including @MTV,MTV on Facebook, MTV on Instagram, MTV on Tumblr). MTV will showcase exclusive content across its various channels including live performances, interviews, video rotation, song placements in shows and more.\n\nEchosmith – Los Angeles-based alt-pop quartet, whose debut album “Talking Dreams” is out now via WBR, has been receiving early praise since the beginning of their young career. Named one of the “100 Bands to Watch in 2013” by Alternative Press, their first single “Cool Kids” was selected as an iTunes Single of the Week, in addition to recently being one of the top 10 most viral tracks on Spotify.\n\nTickets for the “Artist to Watch” launch event will be available here.\n\nFor additional information on MTV’s “Artists to Watch,” please visit Artists.MTV on the web, or download the free MTV Artists app.\n\nAnd just for kicks and giggles, here’s a quick throwback to Planet Stereo’s Warped Tour interview with Echosmith:\n\nThe LA rock band, Bad Things, consisting of front man/lead singer Davis LeDuke, bass player Jared Palomar (formerly of Augustana), guitarist Anthony Sanudo, drummer Lena Zawaideh, and lead guitarist Shaun White (professional snowboarder/skateboarder), will be releasing their debut, self-titled album January 21st on Warner Bros. Records (iTunes Pre-Order here). The record was produced by Rob Schnapf (Beck, Elliot Smith, The Vines), with the lead single “Anybody, ” a “chugging rock anthem heavy with choirboy backing harmonies” according to Rolling Stone, that is now for sale at iTunes and streaming onYouTube and Soundcloud.\n\nRight on the heels of Bad Things‘ release, NBC will air “Shaun White: Russia Calling” on January 25th. The special gives viewers an inside look at how the gold-medal-winning snowboarder has prepped for the Winter Olympics in Sochi next month alongside juggling all of the other commitments he has made, which includes the Bad Things."
