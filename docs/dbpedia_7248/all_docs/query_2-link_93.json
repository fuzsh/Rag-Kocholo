        "text": "Like Hannah Montana, Dinah Jane knows what it’s like to have the best of both worlds. As a member of renowned girl group Fifth Harmony, the 25-year-old spent a few years split between two contrasting realities.\n\nThere’s Dinah Jane, the bubbly pop star, globetrotting around the world with her bandmates, and then there’s Dinah Jane Milika Ilaisaane Hansen, the shy and humble young Tongan woman who still lives in her family home in Santa Ana, California.\n\n“I would go on tour with the girls, and I really felt like I was living a double life,” she says with a strawberry paleta in hand, sitting at her favorite paletería in her hometown. “It was real because I'm over here like, ‘Oh gosh, everything is luxurious.’ Then I'd go back home and I'm sharing a room with my sisters.”\n\nJane embraces me immediately, as if we were family, when I arrive at Mexican ice cream parlor La Michoacana. She offers guidance on which paleta to choose, asking what flavors I like. I tell her anything with chocolate, and she suggests a Ferrero Rocher, one of her go-tos. She's spot-on — it's delicious. Her warm and inviting energy feels both familiar yet refreshing as we talk more about our shared experiences as Pasifika women, which includes sharing a room with multiple people in your family as a young adult. It’s not uncommon for many in the Polynesian community to live at home well into your 20s — even if Billboard refers to your band as \"the biggest girl group of the 2010s.\"\n\n“I feel like people don't really know what Polynesian homes are like. This is the reality of how the majority of us live. I've learned to embrace it and not to be ashamed of how we as people carry ourselves and how our community helps each other,” Jane says. “We're there for each other. It's such a tight-knit community [and] we don’t let anyone fall. And if you do fall, you have so many other family members to run to.”\n\nAs she tells me this, I am immediately reminded of her 2012 X Factor audition and the shock on the judge’s faces when she tells them she lives in a four-bedroom house shared with more than 12 people. While she says some people thought of her living situation as “weird,” she praises her grandparents for building a strong foundation that keeps their family close. “My grandparents created such a safe space where it's like, ‘This is home. You don't need to go anywhere. If you need anything, we can rely on each other.’”\n\nJane is the eldest child of eight, born and raised in Orange County’s second largest city in a predominantly Latino neighborhood. Her family hails from the Kingdom of Tonga, a Polynesian country made up of over 100 islands in the South Pacific. She had an active childhood; her grandfather would take her to a nearby park to play tennis or basketball. Beyond sports, Dinah was always surrounded by music, as her mom and uncle are also singers. However, she credits her grandmother as being the biggest influence in her career.\n\n“She believed I was something before anyone believed that I could be who [I am] now,” she says before sharing stories about the endearing ways that her grandmother encouraged her to pursue singing, including praying for her every night. Those prayers were answered as Dinah became one of the first Tongan students to attend OCSA (Orange County School of the Arts), won third place with Fifth Harmony on The X Factor, and eventually, became a global superstar.\n\nTo honor her grandmother, Dinah often pays tribute within her music. She wants to remember the journey, and the people, that got her here. “Sometimes you get lost in the noise, and the noise gets too loud,” Jane says. “Home is such a great tool for me to remember who I am. No matter where I go, no matter how loud life gets, it humbles me and resets my mindset of, ‘keep going’ or ‘this is bigger than me.’”\n\nWhile she has always kept her family at the forefront of her life, Dinah found herself on a new path of self-discovery and healing during the height of the pandemic. She spent the last three years away from the spotlight, using that time to work on getting herself out of a difficult mental headspace after losing several important people in her life, including her grandfather. “When 2020 happened, [it was a] reset for me where I changed my ‘whys’ and who I do it for. It became more of, ‘I'm doing it for me,’” she says. “It's been three years since I've dropped music and I'm glad that I didn't during that time, because I was not ready. I was broken, I was running, I was shattered. I just didn't know how to feel, but I liked it. I liked that I was feeling broken, I liked that I was feeling things. Because before, being so busy in the group and then going solo, I just kept going, kept going, kept going.”\n\nTo commemorate both AAPI Heritage Month and Mental Health Awareness month, the singer shared a moving post to her seven million Instagram followers on May 4, detailing her mental health journey and the “learning and unlearning” she experienced along the way.\n\n“There’s this word [in Tongan] called laupisi,” Jane reflects now. “It was a word that stuck with me throughout my childhood [that meant], ‘stop being weak’. And I think hearing that so much growing up, that's when I started suppressing how I felt, because I wasn't allowed to speak on how I felt. I hope we can move away from [this] for the next generation. Stop telling them to stop being weak. Let them be vulnerable. Allow them to be vulnerable, allow them a space where they can say, ‘I'm hurting. I can't carry this weight anymore,’ or ‘I want to cry.’”\n\nRespect for our elders is held in such high regard for many Polynesian communities, and it’s often coupled with a reluctance to talk about mental health openly. Jane shares that growing up, “I wasn't allowed to speak on how I felt. It's in our culture, we have to respect our elders.” She explains that if someone is older than you, it’s an expectation not to “talk back.”\n\nAccording to the American Psychiatric Association, studies have shown that the AAPI community were three times less likely to seek mental health services than any other racial/ethnic group. In 2019, the U.S. Office of Minority Health reported that suicide was the leading cause of death for Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders ages 15-24. “I want to be better for the next generation and create that safe space where your feelings are very much valid,” she says. “It doesn't matter who is above you, title or age. May we all respect each other as people and have that boundary of, ‘if this is how they feel, allow them to.’”\n\nHer path of healing eventually led her to rediscovering who she was as an artist. She excitedly shares that new music is on the way, influenced by a variety of genres. “I love reggae, I love country, I love indie music, I love classical music,” she says. “I love that during this downtime, I was able to embrace that a little bit more and not stay driven in the same direction that people above me wanted me to go.”\n\nAfter Fifth Harmony announced their indefinite hiatus in early 2018, Jane went on to release her debut solo single “Bottled Up” featuring Ty Dolla Sign and Marc E. Bassey later that year. In 2019, she dropped her debut solo EP, Dinah Jane 1, and had a few headline shows before announcing a world tour in 2020. Unfortunately, the tour was postponed due to the pandemic. As she reflects on her solo journey, she shares that there was a “struggle of direction” during this time period. “I feel like there's so much you could do with me. Executives and chairmans did not know what to do with me because there was so much you could do. And I mean that in a very humble way.” Dinah is very aware of her own potential and shares that she didn’t want to box herself in as an artist. “There were a lot of failures while trying to figure out who I was as a solo artist,” she adds. “And with those failures, I learned a lot.”\n\nThat downtime also helped merge her “double life” into one, ready to embrace her cultural identity within her own music: “It hurt me that [executives] couldn't really tap in and understand that there is a market for Polynesian people. So I feel like I've always been in this race trying to figure it out by myself as a Polynesian woman in the mainstream world.”\n\nNow that she’s a fully-fledged solo artist, Dinah shares that the transition was intimidating after leaning on the support of her bandmates in Fifth Harmony for so long. “I was scared of just being alone. [...] Having that friendship and that sisterhood beside me the whole journey through, we were each other's [support]. Being out there alone and not having that companionship is what I missed.”\n\nThough the group has gone their separate ways, she says they all still keep in touch. She tells me a sweet story about how she saw a photo of Normani at the mall and immediately made a video to send to her. Camila Cabello checks up on her sporadically, and she recently reunited with Lauren Jauregui for the first time since the band’s hiatus to celebrate Jauregui’s EP release. Life gets busy when you’re a pop star, but the support between them is still there. “I miss them and I love them. I love that we're all finding ourselves and allowing that freedom for each other to just go do what we can and figure that out.”\n\nDinah Jane’s future looks bright as she eases back into the limelight, ready to release new music and share a more vulnerable and authentic version of herself. She also coyly shares that she’s working on starting her own record label to help create a path for the next generation of artists. With a plethora of new projects currently on her plate, I ask how she would describe this era of her life. She simply says it’s a “rebirth.”\n\n“I'm not shying away from who I am anymore,” she says. “And I want it to be known that I'm coming out strong. This is who I am. I'm a Polynesian girl and I'm not afraid to hide it, and I'm not afraid to speak my voice, and I'm not afraid for you to hear my voice.”\n\nCredits\n\nPhotographer: Tracy Nguyen"
