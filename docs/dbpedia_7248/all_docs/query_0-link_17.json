        "text": "That announced the already transition into the late 80s, and to the edgy non-Anglo white (sometimes sadistic Allied Nordicist Yankee \"Friends\"-watching \"Seinfeld\"-hating) culture of \"scumbag\"-saying and cybernetics. Everything about this song is pure UPN/Warner Bros./WB and every creepy sci-fi movie that aired on WWOR (and will air on my new UPN and WB affiliates for NYC/Brooklyn - WSEN and WBNY) in the late 80s. And there's a real \"Punisher\"-like feel to this song. The song is a creepy analogy about the problems of the late 80s, AIDs, urban decay, crumbling architecture. Set on the streets of New York (both the American - meaning anything Empire State Building and south, and French, meaning Midwtown), we see Times Square and we see the subway. We see Jane metaphorically pouring her heart out to the public as she sings about the love life. I warn you this is not a video for kids."
