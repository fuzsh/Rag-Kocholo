        "text": "Two additional artists that had great debuts and then the later releases never matched the promise of the first was Christopher Cross and Cyndi Lauper.\n\nCross got the curse of the best new artist grammy. His follow up Another Page did well in sales but did not get the airplay that the debut album.\n\nThat first Christopher Cross album was huge back in the day. And the follow-up was a good album but didn't do much of anything beyond \"Alright\" and \"Think of Laura\" (which was used in one of the daytime soaps). The really big smash would be the theme from Arthur. He's done further albums (13 more, if I'm counting them correctly) but they've all flown waaay under the radar, some being the usual hits re-recordings or live gigs. And honestly, if I want to listen to Cross, it's that first album I'll put on in its entirety. It was the one that captured lightning in a bottle. Not that the others I've heard are bad, but they just didn't grab me like the debut. Like you say, it must have partly been a Grammy curse--he won five Grammys for that first album.\n\nThat first Christopher Cross album was huge back in the day.

Not that the others I've heard are bad, but they just didn't grab me like the debut. Like you say, it must have partly been a Grammy curse--he won five Grammys for that first album.\n\nThis is also---minus the Grammy curse--pretty much the Stephen Bishop story, though Stephen also wasn't as hot out of the box as Cross.\n\nHe gets a lot of airplay in 1977 with \"Save It For A Rainy Day\", which ends up being a turntable hit that peaks at #22, very nearly makes the Top 10 with \"On and On\" at #11 and the debut album CARELESS, while only making #33, suggests between his material, his sense of humor and his ability to attract key players (dude had Chaka Khan and Natalie Cole as backup singers in 1977), the next one will be a smash.\n\nThe next one, BISH (1978), again leads off with a turntable hit, \"Everybody Needs Love\", which gets decent airplay, but stiffs at #32 and lacks the follow-up hit of CARELESS. The album stalls at #35, despite having Chaka, Natalie, Art Garfunkel, Michael McDonald and Princess Leia herownself, Carrie Fisher as backups.\n\nAlbum three is RED CAB TO MANHATTAN (1980), his first for Warner Bros. Going to a major after riding out the last gasps of ABC Records has to be a huge step up, right? Bish adds Eric Clapton and Phil Collins to his set of studio musicians. No doubt wondering why he's not scoring, he turns everything the people who love him love about him way up to 11, while simultaneously branching out to sounds people don't associate with him. There are traces of Steely Dan and the more self-indulgent aspects of Harry Nilsson. Neither RED CAB nor any of the singles issued from it charted.'\n\nIn 1982, he gets his other hit----in the sense that everyone knows it (it only made #25 in Billboard), \"It Might Be You\" from the TOOTSIE soundtrack. He didn’t write it—-Dave Grusin, Marilyn & Alan Bergman did.\n\nThe real success comes in 1985, when Phil Collins and Marilyn Martyn take the Bishop-written \"Separate Lives\" from the WHITE KNIGHTS soundtrack to #1 and Stephen is nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Song. He lost to Lionel Richie's \"Say You, Say Me\" from the same movie.\n\nFull disclosure---I was a big Stephen Bishop fan through those first three albums. A fourth, SLEEPING WITH GIRLS, was rumored to be coming in 1982. I was eager. It never showed up. Come to find out, Warner Bros. refused to release it in the U.S. It was an Asia-only release in 1985. I found it on YouTube while writing this (it's not available on Spotify). Sampling the tracks, I get Warners' decision. It's good---but it's a mix of what everything Stephen had been doing sounded like, with early-80s production and electronic instruments and no small amount of having been influenced by Phil Collins. There wasn't a hit there.\n\nThe next album, BOWLING IN PARIS, was 1989, on Atlantic, and it having been nine years since the last album available in the U.S., I was long gone. I'm not sure I was aware of its release and I only heard it last year on Spotify. It suffers from late 80s production. Way overdone.\n\nStephen's recorded seven more studio albums between 1996 and 2019, as well as three live albums and three collections of his demos. I've sampled some of it on Spotify. He's still clever, still has a way with a melody, and Jason Mraz owes him big.\n\nI'm glad we're on this subject because there's an artist who I always wondered what happened to her because she was an A&M artist as well. In 1988, the music trade magazines such as BILLBOARD, RECORD WORLD, etc were RAVING about this young lady. Her name was Toni Childs, and you should have read how the critics were going on about her! \"new hope for music\", \"if you are tired of formulaic pop music, then this is the artist for you\", \"cutting edge music for a stagnant music age\"; well, you get the picture. I believe that I heard her her music on one of the stations here in NY, and while it sounded a little different from what was on the radio, it didn't quite grab me like the critics had hyped her.\n\nAs far as I know, she made that one album, but I don't think that she followed up with a second one(most likely the sales weren't that great despite the hype) One other thing: I think that her name was used to name one of the characters on the Black sitcom, \"Girlfriends\" the Tracie Ellis Ross(Diana Ross' daughter)starrer. Does anybody know what happened to Ms.Childs? Like I always say: WOULD LIKE TO KNOW!!!\n\nJazzdre"
