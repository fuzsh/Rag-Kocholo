        "text": "“There’s nothing I love more than taking people with me on a genuine emotional journey.”\n\nJane is a Utah born actress, singer-songwriter and creator currently based in Bushwick, NY. She caught the performing bug at a young age and never considered doing anything practical.\n\nShe attended the University of Michigan and received her B.F.A. in Musical Theater, and has since resided in the city, helping to develop new works (including some of her own), playing hole in the wall NYC venues, and planting the seeds that have blossomed into a career she is so proud of.\n\nJane was a member of the world premiere cast of Jagged Little Pill at A.R.T., and while in Cambridge, wrote her first full length album, “My Bed”. She was deeply inspired by the raw emotional work of Alanis as well as her love of other 90’s Americana and Singer-Songwriters, including Shawn Colvin, Aimee Mann, and Jewel.\n\nElliah Heifetz helped her record and produce the album, which they recorded at Wonderpark Studios in just four days the fall of 2018. Elliah and Jane are frequent collaborators, and soon they’ll collaborate on a life together as husband and wife! Somehow, recording a messy, emotional, break-up album sealed the deal on their romantic feelings, and they’ve been dreaming, scheming, and continuing to make music together ever since.\n\nIn addition to continuing to Broadway with Jagged Little Pill, Jane was also a member of the world premiere cast of The Theory of Relativity at Goodspeed Opera House, played Sara in The Ballad of Little Jo at Two River Theater (you can also hear her on the cast album), performed in the immersive musical The Bad Years, and received a Drama Desk Nomination for Best Original Music in a play for Original Sound at Cherry Lane, a play she also starred in.\n\nJane also has a commission for an original piece at South Coast Repertory Theater, is an Alum of the Johnny Mercer Songwriters Project, and wrote and starred in her original play with music Mother, Mama, Mommy alongside co-creator Victoria Cook at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2023.\n\nHer TV and Film credits include Law and Order: SVU, FBI: Most Wanted, Law and Order (thank you Dick Wolf!), and Jessica Jones. She is also in the upcoming indie film Turning, alongside Marianne Rendon and Caitlin Houlahan. Jane was selected as part of the cast of the 2022 Disney Discovers Talent Showcase.\n\nCurrently, Jane is making her principal debut as Delphi Diggory in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child on Broadway."
