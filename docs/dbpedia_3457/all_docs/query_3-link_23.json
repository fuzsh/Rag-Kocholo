These items are not recyclable.\n\nBreak down, flatten and bundle your cardboard boxes or stack them flattened in your recycling bin.\n\nThings like take-out coffee cups, milk cartons, and juice boxes belong with other recyclable containers, and not paper. Here's a tip to help you sort it right: If you can drink out of it, it's a container.\n\nAvoid “Wishcycling.” Just because you “wish” you could recycle something, doesn’t mean you can. When in doubt, leave it out.\n\nDownload the Recycle Coach app to help answer what goes where in our recycling program.
