        "meta_description": "15 reviews and 73 photos of BLACKFRIARS STATION \"Blackfriars Underground Station is a stop on the District Line in the City, and is a major interchange with the main-line station above, which is served by both the Thameslink service and terminating trains. It was used by over 12.6 million people in 2007.\n\n\n The station was opened in may 1870 when the Metropolitan District Railway was extended from Westminster. It was the terminus for only 14 months, however, as the line was extended to Mansion House in July 1871. Initially, trains ran as far as West Brompton, but now serve the whole of the District Line from Upminster in the East to Richmond, Wimbledon and Ealing Broadway in the West, as well as the Circle Line.\n\n\n The station did have its own attractive entrance, but this disappeared in the 1970s rebuild of the station above. The platforms have a claustrophobic feel, thanks to the wide low flat roof over the tracks.\n\n\n As the Duck says in his review, the station is closing soon while Blackfriars station above is completely rebuilt. The plans will include a new interchange with the Underground station, and should reopen in 2011.\"",
