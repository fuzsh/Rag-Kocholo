So, in the spirit of this, we’ve rounded up the prettiest bars in London for your next night out.\n\n1. The Coral Room at the Bloomsbury Hotel, Fitzrovia\n\nCreated by designers Martin Brudnizki and Luke Edward Hall, The Coral Room is obviously a tonic for the eyes, with vibrant colours, parquet flooring, a classic marble-topped bar and other refined features. Can you guess what the overriding colour choice is throughout? Coral, of course! Naturally, there’s a creative, themed menu of cocktails to work your way through, too.\n\n📍 16-22 Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury, WC1B 3NN.\n\n🚇 Nearest station is Tottenham Court Road.\n\n2. The Bloomsbury Club, Fitzrovia\n\nWhile you’re at the Bloomsbury Hotel, you don’t want to miss the venue’s other gorgeous bar – The Bloomsbury Club. It’s all polished wood, opulence, and vibes indicative of a bygone era. The cocktail menu has been inspired by ancient Egyptian Gods and hieroglyphs, and you can let a pendulum decide your drink order.\n\n📍 16-22 Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury, WC1B 3NN.\n\n🚇 Nearest station is Tottenham Court Road.\n\n3. Mr Fogg’s House of Botanicals, Fitzrovia\n\nAdd together jaw-dropping cocktails, verdant plants, and stunning Instagrammable interiors and you come up with a picturesque dreamland. Such is the case at Mr Fogg’s gin-heavy drinking spot, the House of Botanicals. This fine establishment could virtually double as a garden centre, given the shrubs, vines, and flowers covering the walls and ceilings. And they have a very lovely floral-inspired cocktail menu to boot.\n\nIt’s worth noting, however, that every Mr Fogg’s venue could be individually recognised as one of London’s prettiest bars. There’s the Victorian-era Mr Fogg’s Tavern, the mysterious Mr Fogg’s Pawnbroker full of oddities and curiosities from around the world, and more. Do check out your nearest one for a simply stunning bar.\n\n📍 48 Newman Street, Fitzrovia, W1T 1QQ.\n\n🚇 Nearest station is Goodge Street.\n\n4. Goods Way, King’s Cross\n\nGoods Way is a multi-venue, New Orleans-inspired hangout with top cocktails and delicious food. The venue is the sum of many parts, but cocktails can be found at Sweetwater, a fantastic American-style cocktail bar channelling the spirit of New Orleans and the Mississippi Delta, or hidden speakeasy Nola’s – but you’ll have to book a private party to take advantage of Nola and its hidden entrance!\n\n📍 11 Goods Way, N1C 4UR.\n\n🚇 Nearest station is King’s Cross St. Pancras.\n\n5. A Bar with Shapes for a Name, Hoxton\n\nThemed as an ode to the Bauhaus design aesthetic and mentality, this bar is minimal and clean in the most stunning way. It feels like it straddles two worlds at once, with one foot in the past, and one foot firmly in the present, with a timeless design that evokes 2001: A Space Odyssey and retro TV cabinets. The cocktails are similarly minimal, betraying little of the complexity that they hide – much like the bar itself. They also get props for probably having the best-dressed staff of any cocktail bar, with each staff-member donning their own individually hued jumpsuit. Stunning!\n\n📍232 Kingsland Road, E2 8AX.\n\n🚇 Nearest station is Haggerston.\n\n6. Tayēr + Elementary, Old Street\n\nKeeping up with the minimalist theme – Tayēr + Elementary may not be jaw-droppingly gorgeous, but plenty will be sure to appreciate the venue’s mixture of textures and materials, thus its inclusion in this list of London’s prettiest bars. The bar’s two rooms are unique, but clearly interlinked, with industrial and luxe touches intertwining.\n\n📍 152 Old Street, EC1V 9BW.\n\n🚇 Nearest station is Old Street.\n\n7. Girlfriend, Clapham\n\nIf you don’t LOVE pink, then best to steer clear of Clapham’s Girlfriend. But the rest of us who enjoy fun things get to absolutely delight in the sheer, brash, pink-ness of the bar. It’s all very tongue-in-cheek, with doctored art prints, neon signs, and even a ‘Queen of Pink’ cocktail. Frankly, we’ll take a slice of fun over a super-serious bar any day!\n\n📍 40 Battersea Rise, SW11 1EE.\n\n🚇 Nearest station is Clapham Junction.\n\n8. La Goccia Bar, Covent Garden\n\nThe central London outpost of Richmond’s Petersham Nurseries is as beautiful as you’d expect. And the restaurant’s bar, hidden behind a velvet curtain, serves up some bloomin’ lovely botanical cocktails inspired by the brand’s floral heritage.\n\n📍 1 Floral Court, WC2E 9FB.\n\n🚇 Nearest stations are Covent Garden and Leicester Square.\n\n9. Nine Lives, London Bridge\n\nA beautiful, subterranean tropical oasis, Nine Lives is one of London Bridge’s best-kept secrets, as well as one of the prettiest bars in London. Expect lots of lovely rattan lampshades and lush greenery – and a carefully curated list of fabulous cocktails, of course.\n\n📍 8 Holyrood Street, SE1 2EL.\n\n🚇 Nearest station is London Bridge.\n\n10. Laki Kane, Islington\n\nThis tropical paradise will whisk you away to warmer climes, especially when you’ve got one of their artisanal rum cocktails in hand – made with their own rum! The décor very much nods to tiki bars – but on the classy end of the spectrum. Laki Kane is Polynesian for ‘lucky person’, and we must admit it’s a pretty apt name. Head along for your next night out, you laki thing.\n\n📍 144-145 Upper Street, N1 1QY.\n\n🚇 Nearest station is Essex Road.\n\n11. Silverleaf, Bishopsgate\n\nFor pure opulence and luxury, with some of the lowest lighting around, head to Silverleaf. Coming from some of the best names in the cocktail and bar world of London, it’s a masterclass in sophisticated drinking – but still fun! Be sure to check out the secret whiskey bar while you’re there, too.\n\n📍 3rd Floor, Devonshire House, 3 Bishopsgate, EC2M 4JX.\n\n🚇 Nearest station is Liverpool Street.\n\n12. sketch, Mayfair\n\nAh, sketch. Where to even begin? This place serves high-end food and cocktails in breathtaking surroundings. Every inch of it, across five different venues with individual identities, is begging to be Instagrammed. There’s The Gallery, a gastro-brasserie famous for its afternoon tea, The Lecture Room, a fancy sunset-themed room serving Michelin-starred food, The Parlour, a more affordable affair that focuses on cocktails and small bites, the East Bar & Pods with the famously Instagrammable toilets, and, last but not least, The Glade, a stunning, verdant, paradise. Whew, I’m out of breath!\n\n📍 9 Conduit Street, W1S 2XG.\n\n🚇 Nearest station is Oxford Circus.\n\n13. Disrepute, Soho\n\nThis hidden gem bills itself as a “hideaway for luxury libations, high jinks & late night liaisons,” and they purposely keep the lights low so you have to constantly lean forward to see your drinking partner. It’s all rather seductive and enchanting.\n\n📍 4 Kingly Court, W1F 9RR.\n\n🚇 Nearest station is Oxford Circus.\n\n14. Dalloway Terrace, Fitzrovia\n\nYou’ve probably seen this place on your Instagram feed once or thrice, and for good reason. This cute courtyard is known for its spectacular seasonal makeovers, with autumn being a particular favourite of ours. With a stunning backdrop of seasonal foliage illuminated by twinkling lights, it’s the perfect spot for an afternoon cocktail, and easily one of the prettiest bars in town.\n\n📍 16-22 Great Russell Street, WC1B 3NN.\n\n🚇 Nearest station is Tottenham Court Road.\n\n15. Lost in Brixton, Brixton\n\nSouth London’s jungle paradise is filled with Latin American-inspired cocktails, lots of local beer, plus the option to order food from the market straight to your table. Accessed via a secret staircase in a corner of Brixton Village market, it’s a great spot to visit year-round – one of the few rooftops that keeps the summer vibes going all year round.\n\n📍 Brixton Village, Coldharbour Lane, SW9 8PS.\n\n🚇 Nearest station is Brixton.\n\n16. Lyaness, South Bank\n\nComing in at number 23 on 2023’s Top 50 Cocktail Bars In The UK list, Lyaness is an absolutely stunning bar with spectacular drinks. No wonder, since it was once home to the World’s Best Cocktail Bar Dandelyan. Sumptuously decorated, and wildly inventive, each cocktail at Lyaness is built around unusual ingredients that merge the alien and weird into something delicious. And that blue, gold, and silver colour scheme? Absolutely to die for! It’s easily one of London’s prettiest bars.\n\n📍 20 Upper Ground, SE1 9PD.\n\n🚇 Nearest stations are Blackfriars and Southwark\n\n17. Eve Bar, Covent Garden\n\nHidden beneath Covent Garden, one of the prettiest bars in London comes complete with a sinful twist. The Eve Bar is full of temptation, indulgence, and hedonism – and they invite you to partake in the three most fun of the seven deadly sins: greed, lust, and gluttony. With a huge list of inventive and beautifully presented cocktails, as well as some seriously stunning interiors, Eve is pretty close to being Heaven on Earth. But far more fun.\n\n📍 34 Southampton Street, WC2E 7HF.\n\n🚇 Nearest stations are Temple and Covent Garden.\n\n18. Viajante87, Notting Hill\n\nOver in a discreet subterranean bar beneath the streets of Notting Hill, a gorgeous bar awaits with low lighting and plenty of seductive vibes. Viajante87 is inspired by Bar Director Pietro Collina and Brand Manager Veronica Di Pietrantonio’s travels through Latin America, and everything about the bar pays homage to the diverse cultures of the region. Drinks honour tradition, whilst incorporating local ingredients and a playful sense of experimentation that takes guests on their own journey. Don’t miss the Glacier Martini, which is one of the coldest martinis you can get in the capital (-18°C!). But given how gorgeous it is inside, you’re sure to want to settle in and sample widely across the menu and travel far across Latin America – all beneath the streets of London.\n\n📍 Basement, 87 Notting Hill Gate, W11 3JZ.\n\n🚇 Nearest station is Notting Hill Gate.\n\n19. Burlock, Marylebone\n\nThis buzzing basement bar stocks over 200 rums from all over the world, and you’ll find them mixed into an array of colourful cocktails. If you like to party Cuban-style (i.e. dancing all night long), this place will be right up your street. The golden lighting and eclectic décor give the place tons of charm.\n\n📍 31 Duke Street, W1U 1LG.\n\n🚇 Nearest station is Bond Street.\n\n20. Little Orange Door, Clapham\n\nThis place feels just like home, which is entirely the point. Just like award-winning cocktail bar Little Blue Door, the Little Orange Door (note the difference) is designed to replicate old-school house party vibes, with DJs, dinner parties and bottomless brunches taking over the kitchen, living room and bathroom. As you’d expect from one of South London’s prettiest bars, each room is a feast for the eyes, with surprises behind every door.\n\nJust like the Mr. Fogg’s collection of drinking holes and bars, every Little Door bar is a stunning venue – so do seek out whichever is closest to you!\n\n📍 16a Clapham Common South Side, SW4 7AB.\n\n🚇 Nearest station is Clapham Common.\n\n21. 14 Hills, City of London\n\nIf we’re being honest, rooftop and sky-high bars are already working on a pretty high standard of gorgeousness, given the views they can command. But at 14 Hills, the interior is so gorgeous that you might not even glance out the windows. Set on the 14th floor (see what they did there?) of Fen Court, 14 Hills is chock-a-block full of trees and plants coming at you from every direction.\n\n📍 14th floor, 120 Fenchurch Street, EC3M 5BA.\n\n🚇 Nearest station is Fenchurch Street.\n\n22. Amazing Grace, London Bridge\n\nAmazing Grace is the kind of day-to-night bar that we wish London had more of, with incredible Thai food, stunning interiors, and nights full of live music and revelry. Oh, and did we mention that it’s situated inside a converted 17th century church? Yeah, bars don’t get much prettier than this!\n\n📍 9a St Thomas Street, SE1 9RY.\n\n🚇 Nearest station is London Bridge.\n\n23. aspen & meursault, Battersea\n\nDid Chris Martin write the Coldplay track ‘Yellow’ about this delightful, blonde-hued bar? Well, no. But it’s unlikely you’ll be able to leave without humming to yourself “and it was all yellow”. Fret not, though, the team behind Battersea’s aspen & meursault haven’t created an assault on the senses, instead the shades of yellow that fill this gorgeous bar are (somehow) soothing and warm. It’s a delightful place to while away an evening with a few glasses of wine and nibbles.\n\n📍 96 Westbridge Road, SW11 3PH.\n\n🚇 Nearest stations are Battersea Park and Clapham Junction.\n\n24. Booking Office 1869, King’s Cross\n\nBooking Office 1869 brings the glamour of the past firmly into the present. The bar is a reimagining of the original nineteenth-century St Pancras ticket hall and is the only bar in London that we would describe as having incredible drip. It’s glitzy, glamorous, and downright envious. As a plus, it’s open all day, every day, from 7 until late. More than just one of London’s prettiest bars, it’s arguably one of the prettiest rooms in all of London.\n\n📍 St Pancras Renaissance Hotel, Euston Rod, NW1 2AR.\n\n🚇 Nearest station is King’s Cross St. Pancras.\n\n25. TT Liquor’s Cellar Bar, Shoreditch\n\nHidden beneath their unassuming liquor store, the TT Cellar Bar somehow makes the former cells of a Victorian police station warm and inviting whilst retaining quite a few period touches. The walls hearken back to the site’s original purpose, but intimate booths and soft lighting make the place feel cosy. There’s also a secluded garden roof terrace, where they serve a seasonal spritz menu, pizza, and prosecco on tap. The venue also does liquor tastings and cocktail classes across multiple rooms in their venue.\n\n📍 17B Kingsland Road, E2 8AA.\n\n🚇 Nearest station is Hoxton.\n\n26. Gordon’s Wine Bar, Charing Cross\n\nLondon’s oldest wine bar serves up an unparalleled drinking experience in a space like no other. Tuck yourself in underneath the low ceilings of their wine cave, and toss back a few glasses in the gorgeously romantic, candle-lit setting. Mind your head as you get up though!\n\n📍 47 Villiers Street, WC2N 6NE.\n\n🚇 Nearest station is Charing Cross.\n\n27. Lucy Wong, Fitzrovia\n\nA bar inspired by 1950’s Hong Kong that styles itself as the locale for a sophisticated socialite’s house party can only be an absolutely gorgeous venue. There’s a low-lit red-hued vibe to Lucy Wong’s venue that recalls Wong Kar Wai films and seductive glamour. In a word: stunning!\n\n📍 33-34 Rathbone Place, London, W1T 1JN.\n\n🚇 Nearest station is Tottenham Court Road.\n\n28. Florattica, Aldgate\n\nWhen you don’t even mention that your bar has views of St Paul’s, you’ve got to be pretty confident that you’ve got a gorgeous venue. And Florattica sure does! Drawing inspiration from London’s textile history, the whole place is sumptuously kitted out in florals and gorgeous fabrics. The lighting is even hidden among the flowers that line the ceiling of the venue – it’s a flower paradise and a must-include in any roundup of London’s prettiest bars!\n\n📍 11-15 Minories, London EC3N 1AX.\n\n🚇 Nearest station is Aldgate.\n\n29. The Vault, Soho\n\nHidden behind a bookshelf at the rear of London’s oldest whiskey shop, Milroy’s of Soho, is The Vault – one the most spectacular drinking holes in London. Head here to sip on some seriously special whiskeys, or simply for a spirited night out with gorgeous cocktails and drinks from a seasonally changing menu.\n\n📍 Through the bookcase, 3 Greek Street, W1D 4NX.\n\n🚇 Nearest station is Tottenham Court Road.\n\n30. Christina’s, Shoreditch\n\nThis all-day cocktail spot is all about gorgeously peaceful vibes and astoundingly pretty cocktails. With a focus on sustainability, and left-of-centre and wild ingredients, the cocktail menu features some of Britain’s most exciting artisan producers. Products from small-batch vermouth producers and local distillers are used in a list of cocktails inspired by Italian Aperitivo culture. Colour us intrigued by their Rosehip Cosmo and the Alexander Seed Negroni – which swaps the gin out for an Alexander Seed distillate that goes more piney/floral than the traditional spirit. And the copper-clad bar and eclectic foliage-driven decor have you constantly gazing around at your gorgeous environs. It’s cosily gorgeous, welcomingly intriguing, and very, very Shoreditch – in the best possible way.\n\n📍 45 Curtain Road, EC2A 3PT.\n\n🚇 Nearest station is Shoreditch High Street."
