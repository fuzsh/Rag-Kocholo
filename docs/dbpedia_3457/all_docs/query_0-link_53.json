        "text": "London Blackfriars Station in London, UK, underwent a major redevelopment programme and became a landmark station of operator Network Rail.\n\nThe redevelopment of the London Underground station was part of the congestion-busting Thames Link Project. It was initiated by Network Rail and First Capital Connect to increase the service capacity and frequency of trains on one of the busiest and fastest-growing passenger routes in London.\n\nThe project included the creation of a common entrance at the north end of the rail bridge spanning the River Thames, increasing the length of the platforms to accommodate 50% longer trains, the refurbishment of the Underground station and the construction of a new station on the South Bank of the Thames for the first time in 120 years.\n\nBLÜCHER® EuroPipe was used throughout for the siphonic rainwater system, the gravity rainwater system, the soil system, and the vacuum drainage system. BBESL were the M&E contractor with Kylemore Services installing the vacuum drainage system and the soil system and Thorne Rainwater installing both the siphonic and gravity systems. Standard grade AISI 304 stainless steel was used inside the building with AISI 316L used on the pipework fixed externally to the building. This is due to the fact that the Thames is tidal and the salt in the atmosphere creates a weak hydrochloric acid solution. The AISI 316L stainless steel contains molybdenum and is resistant to this weak acid solution.\n\nConstruction on the redevelopment project, estimated to cost £350m, began in 2008. The new station was re-opened to passengers in February 2012 and became fully operational in summer 2012.\n\nProject facts:"
