        "text": "Above: The east side of Blackfriars Railway Bridge seen from Bankside.\n\nThe first railway bridge constructed in the vicinity of Blackfriars was the Alexandra Bridge which opened in 1864 and was designed by Joseph Cubitt for the London, Chatham and Dover Railway. The Alexandra Bridge had a railway station at its northern end called St Paul’s and another station at the southern end called Blackfriars. Only the round supporting pillars for that bridge remain on site in the river.\n\nSee also – Alexandra Bridge\n\nhttps://knowyourlondon.wordpress.com/2021/12/03/alexandra-bridge/\n\nIn 1884 a second railway bridge was constructed to the east of Alexandra Bridge. It was called St Paul’s Bridge and was built between 1884 and 1886 on the downriver side of the first railway bridge. Following the formation of the Southern Railway in 1924, railway services serving continental services were concentrated on Waterloo which left St Paul’s Station serving suburban stations. The use of the original Alexandra Bridge railway services gradually declined.\n\nBlackfriars Railway Bridge was designed using wrought iron by John Wolfe-Barry and Henry Marc Brunel. It was erected by Lucas and Aird. At the southern end of the bridge was St Paul’s Railway Station. When St Paul’s railway station changed its name to Blackfriars in 1937, the name of the bridge was also changed and its name remains the same today. Blackfriars Railway Bridge at first served St Paul’s Station (in Southwark). That station later closed and a new station at the northern end of the bridge was completed – called Blackfriars Station, which was very close to the District Line underground station, also called Blackfriars.\n\nBlackfriars Station remained in its original form until 2009. It had a dreary layout and looked very old-fashioned. By that time it was serving through-trains on the Thameslink line as well as some local train services which terminated at Blackfriars Station. The station was significantly renovated between 2009 and 2012 in a £500 million redevelopment programme to modernise the station and increase capacity. The terminal platforms at the station were closed on 20 March 2009 so that work could begin. The original concept for the project was designed by Pascall+Watson architects, with execution by Jacobs and Tony Gee and Partners. The new construction work was carried out by Balfour Beatty.\n\nThe new platforms run the length of the railway bridge, with the added advantage of access to those platforms from the north end (at the western end of Queen Victoria Street) as well as a new entrance at Southwark (from beside the walkway at Bankside). There are now two through platforms serving the Thameslink routes. In addition, there are two terminus lines for other local train services. The station has plate glass walls on each side, bringing light into the whole station but also providing marvellous views to the east and to the west from the platforms of the River Thames.\n\nSee also – Blackfriars Station Place Names\n\nhttps://knowyourlondon.wordpress.com/2015/09/18/blackfriars-station-place-names/\n\n-ENDS-"
