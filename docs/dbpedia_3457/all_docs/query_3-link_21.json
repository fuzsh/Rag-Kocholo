        "text": "Blue Ridge Highlands\n\nABINGDON\n\nAbingdon is surrounded by the beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains, making it the perfect destination for outdoor activities.\n\nThe Virginia Creeper Trail begins in downtown Abingdon and is great for biking, walking, jogging or horseback riding. The historic downtown district begs for a walk along the cobblestone sidewalks, and delicious finds aren’t far away. Get pampered with a spa treatment at The Martha Hotel & Spa, dine at a tasty restaurant serving locally-grown menu items, catch a play at the famous Barter Theatre, or grab a craft brew and listen to live music at Wolf Hills Brewing Co.\n\nBRISTOL\n\nWith its wonderful music heritage — as the site of the 1927 Bristol Sessions, recognized as the “Big Bang of country music” — and its historic charm, Bristol is the perfect destination for music lovers and history buffs.\n\nAnd it will only get better with the opening of the Birthplace of Country Music Museum in August 2014. Bristol’s downtown offers live music every night in a variety of venues, along with many music events throughout the year. As a designated Arts & Entertainment District, Bristol is home to art galleries featuring local artists, live dance and theatrical performances, and numerous arts events. You can also find wonderful local dining spots that you won’t find anywhere else. From the Burger Bar and Brooklyn Grill to Eatz and Alfredo’s, there’s something for every taste. Stay the night at either The Bristol Hotel or The Sessions Hotel, both brand-new upscale accommodations with rooftop bars and fine dining restaurants.\n\nDAMASCUS\n\nDamascus is known as “Trail Town USA” thanks to the seven trails that intersect there, namely the Appalachian Trail and the Virginia Creeper Trail, which connects to Abingdon.\n\nDamascus is a gateway to the 191,000-acre Mount Rogers National Recreation Area and Virginia’s highest peak. The Damascus Old Mill is a historic staple in the center of town. Located on the banks of Laurel Creek, the mill overlooks the grist mill waterfall, while ducks and geese float peacefully on the mill pond. It serves as an inn, restaurant and local watering hole. Damascus is for vacationers who are tired of sitting in traffic, waiting in long lines, and spending lots of money in crowded, hectic conditions.\n\nFLOYD\n\nFloyd, Virginia is the quintessential destination for music lovers seeking an authentic experience. There’s nothing glamorous about Floyd. It’s not Vegas, baby; it’s dirt-real with spur-of-the-moment porch pickin’, homemade food, handcrafted arts and crafts, and good, friendly people.\n\nYour must see’s, do’s and eat’s include the Floyd Country Store (home of the Friday Nite Jamboree), Blue Ridge Restaurant (homemade country dining for 80+ years), Historic Pine Tavern (family-style dining since 1927), and the cool artisan opportunities.\n\nGALAX\n\nGalax boasts the largest and oldest Old Time Bluegrass Fiddler’s Convention in the world. In fact, during the 80th annual event this August, an attempt will be made to reclaim the Guiness World Record for the largest mandolin ensemble ever!\n\nIf you’re in town on a Friday night, head to the Rex Theater where they’re broadcasting a live radio show that you can be present for. Locate the unique-to-Galax LOVEwork to capture the essence of what this town is about. Afterwards, get an affordable but tasty hometown meal at one of Galax's local restaurants.\n\nMARION\n\nOne of the country’s last remaining Art Deco Mayan Revival theaters can be found in Marion, Virginia. The Lincoln Theatre is akin to an art museum with six giant, intricate murals lining the auditorium; a must see! While you’re visiting, find and purchase a Mountain Dew soft drink.\n\nIt’s a simple thing, really, but did you know that it was created by William “Bill” Jones right there in Marion? Jones sold his creation to Pepsico in 1964. Shopping and dining are plentiful enough in Marion. For a Marion original, grab a dip dog at Dip Dog Stand. Aerosmith band members have had one and you should, too.\n\nRADFORD\n\nRadford has so many outdoor opportunities with the New River as its centerpiece, and it has a quirkiness to it since it’s also a college town. Specialty shops abound and you can find a good mix of chain and local eateries.\n\nGlencoe Museum is a popular stop for history buffs while St. Albans Sanatorium is where you can go to get a little freaked out. It’s been called the “most active location on the East Coast” by experienced paranormal teams. Eek!\n\nWYTHEVILLE\n\nLocated at the intersection of Interstates 77 and 81, Wytheville provides the best in small town living and natural beauty. Known as the crossroads of Virginia, Wytheville is home to a regionally known dinner theatre, wineries, scenic drives, a butterfly house, historic B&Bs, museums, and First Lady Edith Bolling Wilson, wife of President Woodrow Wilson.\n\nConsider staying at the Bolling Wilson Hotel, an historic hotel property with luxurious rooms that is steps away from Wytheville’s Main Street, and for a quick bite to eat, you can’t go wrong with a world-famous “skeeterdog” from Skeeter’s. The New River and the Big Survey provide countless outdoor opportunities for nature enthusiasts.\n\nCentral Virginia\n\nASHLAND\n\nDid you know that Ashland, Virginia is known as the Center of the Universe? In fact, you’ll find Center of the Universe Brewing Company there, along with railroad, Civil War and American Revolution history.\n\nSeek out the LOVEwork for a photo op. Hungry? Check out Virginia Barbeque Company offering homemade sides and hand-pulled Virginia barbecue. It’s a true “mom and pop” experience.\n\nBLACKSTONE\n\nBlackstone dates to an unknown time (Revolutionary period), and was called “The Village of Black and Whites” thanks to the two rival tavern owners – the Schwartz Family (schwartz is German for black) and the White Family. In 1885, “Blackstone” was embraced as the town name; in 1888 it was incorporated. Today you’ll find a revitalized community to enjoy. Spend the day shopping and visit Schwartz Tavern, as well as The Robert Thomas Carriage Museum, home to one of the finest collections of horse-drawn carriages, sleighs and buggies.
