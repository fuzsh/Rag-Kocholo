        "text": "The new Blackfriars North Station has an ample common entrance hall to provide superior connections to the Underground. It is a large glazed structure with a curved north light roof. The project required that this ample glazed light roof provide natural ventilation and a maximum amount of natural light. Colt designed and installed into the light roof a weatherproof ventilation system with 4,000 bespoke glass louvres to meet these requirements. Colt's extensive experience and design capability came into play, as the architectural project involved complex shapes for the roof-mounted louvres, and it used in-house 3d packages to computer model these shapes.\n\nColt was adaptable to the requirements of Network Rail with regards to working outside of working hours and adhering to a strict H&S regime.\n\nThe project for the new Blackfriars Station complex is part of the Â£5.5 billion Thameslink programme. This is the first station in London to span the River Thames and has resulted in two new stations being built, one on the north side and the other on the south side. In addition, the Blackfriars Underground station has been entirely rebuilt. These are the first new stations opened on the south bank of the Thames in over 120 years."
