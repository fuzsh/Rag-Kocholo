        "text": "DON'T STAY HERE. DON'T IGNORE THIS REVIEW. NOT A JOKE. DO NOT STAY HERE. THEY ARE DOING CONSTRUCTION WHICH ISN'T MENTIONED ANYWHERE and they will not tell you that when you check in. So irresponsible. When I read someone's review about the A/C, I thought ok, maybe they just run hot. Nope, we felt like we were being baked alive in our room. It feels like it's 90 degrees in here, and the lack of moisture in the air is making my skin feel like parchment paper. The reference to this feeling a dorm, also 100% accurate. The room is sparse which is fine, but the aesthetic is just ugly. BUT THE ABSOLUTE WORST PART that is not listed anywhere and which the front desk didn't mention, there is construction going on above us. Somewhere around 7am, it sounds like bowling balls and tools are constantly being dropped. I so wish you could attach a recording to this review. It is INSANE. It is so loud and so crazy sounding, you cannot sleep, period. It sounds like whoever is above us is intentionally dropping 10 ton objects on the floor. Why we were not told that this was going to happen, I don't know. We asked at the front desk what was going on and the clerk basically shrugged and said that they're doing refurbishments above and that the noise wasn't supposed to bother guests. Huh? What does that mean? Incredibly loud banging, sawing, hammering, drilling. Yes, that won't bother me at 7am. So needless to say, jet lag combined with this living condition, i can honestly say that this hotel SUCKS. Oh and carts start rolling outside. your door around the same time. I don't understand why they are so loud, but they are. The only thing we liked about it was the proximity to a tube. (Oh and the glamorous looking lobby photos â€“ don't be fooled. It is a tiny space downstairs. Not some big expansive luxurious space.) I honestly think the mgmt. should offer a full refund. Unless they deserve credit for keeping us out of the outside elements."
