        "text": "Work at Tideway’s Blackfriars Bridge Foreshore site has progressed well this year and from May 2024 to July 2024 the team has been removing the remaining piles from the cofferdam area. The cofferdam was the temporary area of land that was built into the river that allowed construction to take place. This work is now complete.\n\nThe team has also been installing the artwork installations and working on the paving, landscape and architectural features of the new area of public realm.\n\nOver the coming months, the Tideway teams will be trialling our lighting systems at this site. Phase 1 of testing took place from 6am Thursday 13 June - midnight Monday 17 June. For more information about these tests, the purpose of these lights and which other sites you can expect to see also trialling these lights, please click here.\n\nIf you have any questions about this or our site at Blackfriars Bridge Foreshore please get in touch with our helpdesk on 08000 30 80 80 or [email protected]\n\nAt Blackfriars we are creating a large new area of public realm, right on the foreshore. For more information on our public open spaces, visit our Open Spaces page.\n\nThe artist Nathan Coley has been commissioned to create a new permanent artwork for the site at Blackfriars, read more here.\n\nDorothea Smartt has been commissioned to produce poetry to adorn the signature ventilation columns for many of our sites, read more here and Marina Willer of design studio Pentagram is also creating a unifying identity for a series of bronze plaques for 12 of Tideway’s sites across London including our Blackfriars site.
