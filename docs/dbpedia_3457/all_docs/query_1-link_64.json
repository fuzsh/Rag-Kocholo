        "text": "Tourists visiting London often want to see all the sights the UK’s capital city offers, including the historic Tower Bridge and St Paul’s Cathedral, the Tate Modern, and The Shard.\n\nAt Blackfriars station, you can get a remarkable view of all of these in the most unlikely of places.\n\nFirst opened in 1836 as St Paul’s before being renamed Blackfriars in 1937, the station was not always such a gift to sightseers – or even open to the public.\n\nIt fell into disrepair in the 1960s, with the original Blackfriars railway bridge being demolished.\n\nWork to rebuild the station began in 1971, with the then Lord Mayor of London, Peter Vanneck, unveiling the changes in 1977.\n\nThose changes survived until 2009, when the difficult decision was taken to close Blackfriars entirely for three years for a £600million overhaul to improve its passenger capacity by 60 percent before the 2012 Olympics.\n\nIn what was described as a “hugely complex engineering challenge”, the Victorian railway bridge across the River Thames was reconstructed to allow longer Thameslink trains to stop there, with platforms accessible from both the south and north bank.\n\nA modern new curved entrance hall providing better access to the Circle and District lines of the London Underground was built, enabling Blackfriars to accommodate up to 40,000 passengers a day.\n\nBut as impressive as the new station and improved capacity were, the new view it offered of the capital when it opened in 2012 was even more breathtaking.\n\nThe clear pane on the east side means you can look right down the Thames, with a near-perfect view of the City of London’s skyline.\n\nYou can even see as far as Canary Wharf in the distance and even at night, the lit-up buildings provide a perfect illuminated view of the capital.\n\nNormally, you would have to pay for panoramic sights of London from places like the London Eye or the viewing platform at The Shard.\n\nBut this scene costs absolutely nothing and is the ideal distraction while you pass the time waiting for trains north to Cambridge, Bedford, and Peterborough, or south towards Brighton.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Clean and bright with great views of the Thames.”\n\nBlackfriars also remains ahead of its time in its green energy capabilities.\n\nMore than 4,000 solar panels were installed by Network Rail on the roof when it opened in 2012, accounting for about half of its energy needs."
