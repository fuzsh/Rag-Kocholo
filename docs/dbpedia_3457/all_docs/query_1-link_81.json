        "text": "A London Underground station closed for nearly three years has reopened.\n\nBlackfriars station was shut as part of the Â£5.5bn Thameslink upgrade project.\n\nImprovements to the Tube station include increased capacity, a bigger ticket hall, refurbished platforms and step-free access.\n\nThe work is also part of a Â£350m project that has seen Blackfriars become the first mainline station to span the River Thames.\n\nThe Thameslink upgrade means trains running from Bedford and Brighton will use a 12-carriage service instead of eight and will eventually lead to a more frequent service."
