        "text": "Description\n\nThis fabulous 1960's mid century three storey family Townhouse was designed by the architect Peter Moiret and is part of an award-winning development of 32 houses surrounding an attractive well maintained central garden green. It is spacious and light filled and fully furnished and equipped. Accommodation is approximately 1,400 sq ft, includes three bedrooms, a large open plan living room with dining area, a kitchen / dining room, bathroom and shower room. The house has a balcony on the first floor overlooking the garden at the rear. The ground floor: houses a kitchen with generous dining area, a shower room, access to a garage storeroom (not available for cars but suitable for cycles and motor cycles) and a rear garden patio. The first floor consists entirely of a stunning open-plan reception room with full length windows and dining area with access to a balcony at rear. The Top floor contains three bedrooms and a bathroom/shower. The neighbourhood is calm and quite 'leafy' and the house overlooks the central garden square. There is minimal traffic noise because all the houses behind the development are also on cul-de-sacs. Although it is very close to a Sainsbury's superstore and all the pubs, restaurants and cafe's you might need the area is very tranquil. There are several public parks nearby: Ruskin, Brockwell (with its outdoor Lido pool and excellent restaurant/cafe) and Dulwich Parks are particularly lovely. The Oval cricket ground is a short bus ride away. Ideal situation: \"We stayed at Freda's Denmark Hill house for nearly 3 months in 2014. It was absolutely perfect for us and I'll try to explain why: (1) Location. We had initially intended to stay in North London before warily renting this house in Denmark Hill. Best decision ever...... \" (Sabbatical Homes review) Close to King's College: Denmark Hill Campus (10 minutes walk), (King's College Strand Campus 13 minutes by train to Blackfriars). University of Arts, London: Camberwell College of Arts (20 minute walk)' London Southbank University. Maudesley Hospital (10 minutes walk). Easy access to Central London - University College London, London School of Economics (Train to Blackfriars approx 13 minutes), Birkbeck, The British Museum, The British Library Great Ormond Street Hospital, Kings College The Strand etc, etc. Excellent transport links (Zone 2): Denmark Hill is situated between Herne Hill, Dulwich and Camberwell and the house is just a 10 minute stroll from Denmark Hill Station in Zone Two, with direct trains to London Victoria, Blackfriars, London Bridge, Elephant & Castle, Kings Cross St Pancras, St Pancras International and beyond. Denmark Hill Station joined the London Overground network in December 2012 with added connections west to Clapham Junction and east to Peckham Rye, Canada Water, Surrey Quays and Whitechapel. East Dulwich station is a 12 minute walk away. Numerous buses run from Camberwell Green to Vauxhall, Brixton, East Dulwich, Herne Hill, Peckham, Greenwich, Elephant & Castle, Waterloo, London Bridge, Euston, Trafalgar and Leicester Squares, The South Bank, Covent Garden, Holborn (approx 30 mins) and beyond. In particular the 68 and 176 bus services run every few minutes throughout the day from very close by to Central London via Elephant and Castle, Waterloo and South Bank to Strand, Trafalgar Square, Covent Garden, Aldwych, Holborn, Euston etc. The 188 service runs from Camberwell to Greenwich. The house is an ideal place for families and individuals on sabbatical or on holiday. The property is also suitable for short term rental during primary home renovations, family visits etc. Testimonials: \"The house is lovely and well-maintained and it was literally like going to a hotel - we only had to bring our clothes and toys. Everything from crockery to towels to sheets (and a weekly cleaner) is included. The little close that it is in is truly unique, with all the neighbours being very friendly and welcoming\"."
