        "text": "SER Blackfriars Station (SE1)\n\nIntro & History of the Station (Judy)\n\nBlackfriars Station was opened in January 1864 by the South Eastern Railway Co. (SER), connecting the Charing Cross and London Bridge stations. Just five years later, on 1 January 1869, the station was closed because the newly opened Waterloo Station (known today as Waterloo East) rendered it unnecessary.\n\nThe station is located on Blackfriars Road, opposite the present day Southwark Station.\n\nHistory of South Eastern Railway (Nodoka)\n\nThe South Eastern Railway (SER) was found in 1836 until it became one of the constituents of the Southern Railway in 1922.\n\nAlthough SER was originally formed to construct a route from London to Dover, there were some rival companies; for example, the London, Chatham and Dover Railway(LCDR) had a more direct route to Dover in 1860. Moreover, the other rival companies had access to the West end of London while SER only had its terminal near London Bridge.\n\nOut of necessity to improve the main line, SER extended their rail line to near Waterloo, over Hungerford bridge. This led to the construction of the Blackfriars station in 1864.\n\nRailways in southeast England, 1840\n\nHistorical background of the area, including WWII (Alejandro)\n\nThe walls show evidence of damage from WWII, both from the Blitz of 1940 and a V2 rocket in December 1944. The area around the station was completely destroyed, including The Ring boxing arena, formerly the Surrey Chapel, on the site of 197 Blackfriars Road.\n\nIn 2005 the entrance was restored thanks to funding by Blackfriars Investment and Royal London, Cross River Partnership, Network Rail, Railway Heritage Trust and Southwark Council. Although the door has been bricked up, it was formerly street level. A memorial sign was placed as we can see in this photo.\n\nA cafe granted its building permission in 2009. The plans reveal a glass structure that would follow the Southwark council’s request to respect the station’s original features.\n\nIn spite of this, a visit to the place reveals that the cafe has not still opened, although now there is a small espresso shop located in the entrance.\n\nArea around the station today\n\nAlthough Blackfriars was “damaged beyond repair”, the borough of Southwark enjoyed a complete reconstruction and today features both cultural facilities and offices. East, near the river, Shakespeare’s Globe is now juxtaposed with the Tate Modern, which opened in 2000. The recent architecture of Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron leaves intact the history its surroundings. East, another paradox arises as the National Theatre stands near the ITV London Television Center. North, the Thames docks constitute a nice place for pedestrians, locals and tourists. South, offices occupy the rest of the borough, to where converge thousands of workers from 4 tube lines every day. By many aspects, Blackfriars (today Southwark) exemplifies the international dimension of London.\n\nFuture plans for the area/station\n\nNo mention of development in the plans. The near future apparently holds no interest in the station. The long-term future is unclear, but certainly does hold something interesting. As there are very little places in London safe from re-development.\n\nHowever, as long as the rails will be in use, the station’s location is not particularly interesting and as such might survive a long period in dormancy.I would state that it is impressive that a station that was only opened for five years almost a hundred and fifty years ago is still visible, and that its restoration was funded.\n\nWorks Cited"
