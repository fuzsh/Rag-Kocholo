        "text": "2009:\n\nFoundations for the first new rail station to be built on the South Bank in over 120 years are being laid as part of Network Rail's landmark redevelopment of Blackfriars station.\n\nWork on the new Blackfriars south station is integral to the Â£5.5bn congestion-busting Thameslink Programme and marks a major milestone in the life of a unique project that will create the first station to span the River Thames, and deliver more and better journey options to and through the capital for hundreds of thousands of passengers.\n\nLocated at the base of Blackfriars railway bridge, the south station will provide direct access to some of the area's key local attractions east and west along the Thames Path, which include the Tate Modern, Shakespeare's Globe and The London Eye.\n\nFeaturing a new glazed concourse area with retail space and ticket facilities, entry to the new platforms that span the river, and improved use of the Thames Path through widening the pavement at this location, Blackfriars south station has been designed to meet the needs of all users.\n\nThe new Blackfriars station will span the River Thames, Impression, 2009\n\nI think this picture may show this 1886 bridge -\n\nBlackfriars Railway Bridge 1886, seen over Blackfriars Road Bridge\n\nAgain view from upstream with the station on the south bank\n\nBlackfriars' Station shown was actually south of the river. It was built on the site of Albion Mill. At the southern end of the bridge was Blackfriars Bridge railway station which opened in 1864 before closing to passengers in 1885 following the opening of what is today the main Blackfriars station (on the north bank). Blackfriars Bridge railway station continued as a goods stop until 1964 when it was completely demolished, and much of it redeveloped into offices."
