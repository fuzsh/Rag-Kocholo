        "text": "When a train station successfully spans the breadth of the river Thames, finding your way out of it can be a hurdle in itself. So when you do make your way out of the darkness, the last thing you need is a tough time locating a Blackfriars taxi. Addison Lee minicabs are easily pre-booked through our website or app to guarantee you the same level of service we’ve been providing Londoners for over 30 years. We pride ourselves on making sure every one of our cars and drivers adhere to the highest code of practice. Which include a non-negotiable dedication to comfort, reliability and complete safety for all our passengers. Chances are if you’ve travelled into London from anywhere as far south Brighton (or as north as Bedford) you’ll have passed through London Blackfriars expansive railway station. In 2009 the station was under pressure to ease the pressure on the Thameslink line’s ever increasing numbers of commuters. The problem was of course that this stylish corner of the City was already densely packed in between St Paul’s, Holborn and the river Thames. Their solution? A £550m expansion across the river. And in so doing becoming the only station to span the the Thames and feature exit points on both sides of the water. In fact, it’s the first bridge in London to house a building since the demolishing of London Bridge in 1831. Today the station sits proudly on Blackfriars Bridge. A modern phenomenon of glass and steel that serves the many commuters of London’s financial district and beyond. Not to mention the area itself. Step off on one side to the flourishing culture of Southwark. Including the Oxo tower, the Tate Modern and Shakespeare’s Globe. On the other you’ll find the heady buzz of London’s financial district. Alive with bars and restaurants aplenty. Whichever side of the river you come up on, be sure to book an Addison Lee. And follow our Blackfriars taxi driver’s guide to the area for some hints and tips on where to eat, drink and relax in the area."
