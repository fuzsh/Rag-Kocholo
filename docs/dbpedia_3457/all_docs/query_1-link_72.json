        "text": "The plan to redevelop Blackfriars Station called for the creation of a station that actually spanned the river. There would be a station building on the South Bank that was conveniently located for visitors to the Globe and National Theatres. On the north side, the new station curves away from the Victoria Embankment on to Queen Victoria Street.\n\nA new building, supported on V-shaped piers, is home to the escalators for the Blackfriars Underground Station.\n\n********************\n\nBetween the two stations, the platforms extend across the railway bridge and a new canopy, supporting a solar array, protects the passengers from the British weather.\n\nThe Tony Gee & Partners website says that, \"The new Blackfriars Station and Bridge Redevelopment is a key part of the Thameslink Programme to accommodate 12 car trains at 24 trains per hour through the core route. It is to become one of Network Railâs flagship stations and a new London landmark, becoming the first station spanning the River Thames.\" Tony Gee was responsible for the design that called for, \"... the widening and reconstruction of the existing Blackfriars Bridge superstructure and station platforms. All elements are to be replaced, with the exception of the bridge foundations and arches, which will be are strengthened and repainted.\""
