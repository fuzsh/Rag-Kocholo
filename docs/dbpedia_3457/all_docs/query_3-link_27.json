It boasts of a rich maritime past, once housed colossal docks that handled timber and goods from Canada, Scandinavia, and the Baltic until the shipping industry adopted the container system for cargo transportation, and in the 1970s the docks could not accommodate the size of the vessels that were required.\n\nSince then, the landscape has undergone a remarkable transformation. In the 1980s, the London Docklands Development Corporation initiated the redevelopment, giving rise to a thriving residential area. Today, this district boasts modern high-rise apartments, 1980s houses, and older blocks of flats.\n\nThe largest development site in London is the £2 billion project in Canada Water. Encompassing the Surrey Quays Shopping Centre, Surrey Quays Leisure Park, and SE16 Printworks, this venture aims to deliver over 3,500 homes, offices, shops, restaurants, a three-acre park, a leisure centre, and a new Kings College London campus. Plans also include London’s pedestrian and cycle bridge connecting Rotherhithe to Canary Wharf.\n\nHistory\n\nRotherhithe's history dates back to 1105, marked by centuries of docks and shipyards. The Pilgrim Fathers’ Mayflower ship left Rotherhithe for America in 1620.\n\nThe Thames Tunnel, constructed by Brunel in 1843, remains in use, with its engine house now serving as a museum.\n\nTDuring the Blitz in September 1940, Surrey Docks suffered significant damage from the Luftwaffe bombing.
