        "text": "**Guide price £775,000 - 800,000**\n\nSituated on Birkhall Road, a quiet, tree lined residential street on the renowned Corbett estate, this beautiful Victorian semi-detached home stands as a testament to thoughtful restoration and modern elegance.\n\nBuilt during the early 20th century, this property reflects a blend of historic detail and sympathetic development. The house itself of 1685 square feet, features a spacious kitchen diner extension, three double bedrooms, luxurious amenities, and a mature west-facing garden, all designed for both comfort and aesthetic appeal.\n\nApproaching this handsome property with its imposing red brick façade, the generous frontage offers off-street parking and a side access gate and leads to the original front door.\n\nOn entering the building, the light and welcoming living room features an open fireplace with a log burner, a light-filled bay window with double glazing, ornate cornicing, original picture rails and plantation shutters.\n\nPast the neat, downstairs WC and petite washbasin with pretty tiled floor, and on into a strikingly glamorous, vast kitchen diner extension that's over 26ft long. This huge space is complete with a cosy family seating corner, a fitted kitchen with an island and striking feature tiling, and a dining area. Full height sliding double glazed doors open the entire width of the room onto the garden, seamlessly bringing the outside in.\n\nUpstairs there are three comfortable double bedrooms, each with an original feature fireplace and bespoke fitted wardrobes. The luxury bathroom is equipped with a walk-in rainfall shower, double countertop wash basins, and a stunning, feature, freestanding bath.\n\nThe landscaped, mature, West-facing back garden measures over 50ft long by 28ft wide, with deep planted borders, a generous grassed area for entertaining, or just enjoying the afternoon sun, and a useful garden shed.\n\nBuilt by the renowned Victorian Builder, Archibald Cameron Corbett, Birkhall Road lies in the south of the Corbett Estate, and was built in 1904/5, just over halfway through the 15 years it took to finish all 27 streets. The name refers to a huge estate and mansion house in Scotland.\n\nArchibald Corbett, a Scottish property developer, MP, and philanthropist, was recognized as the biggest house builder in suburban London at the end of the 19th century. His vision for the Corbett Estate was to create healthy living spaces, featuring homes with generous front and back gardens along wide streets, fostering a strong sense of community that still prevails today. The Corbett Estate attracts many artists and families with its blend of Victorian architecture, local schools, and green space.\n\nCatford centre, earmarked for significant growth and development, is becoming increasingly popular among homebuyers and investors. The area is renowned for its intact period housing, transport connections, and diverse community. The Catford Arts Trail is an event which encourages the community to visit the studios and homes of local artists and makers.\n\nAmbitious regeneration plans aim to make Catford one of the most vibrant and green town centres in London. Favourite local haunts include Good Food, The Bottle Bar & Shop, La Pizzeria Italiana, and the Catford Mews cinema. Transport connections are excellent; the Catford and Catford Bridge stations provide easy access to central London; from Catford the network runs Thameslink services to London Blackfriars and Sevenoaks, while Catford Bridge Southeastern services run to London Bridge, Charing Cross and Hayes.\n\nThe locale is also rich in educational opportunities, with a selection of local nursery and primary schools within proximity, including Sandhurst, Torridon, and Holy Cross. Prestigious independent schools like St Dunstan’s College and Colfe’s are nearby.\n\nHither Green station is approximately a fifteen-minute walk away, providing easy access into London; direct Southeastern services from Hither Green take 9 minutes into London Bridge.\n\nHither Green is highly regarded for its thriving community, popular schools, and a variety of independent shops with favourites including Arlo & Mo, Three Sisters, You Don’t Bring Me Flowers, Crimson and Clover, Park Fever, and Good Hope, making it a hotspot for those seeking a dynamic and engaging community. Services from Hither Green take 9 minutes into London Bridge.\n\nFurther afield, Blackheath, Beckenham, Brockley, Bromley and Greenwich offer additional leisure and cultural experiences, all within a manageable distance, for weekend exploration.\n\nCouncil tax band: D\n\n**please check information regarding council tax with your solicitor to ensure accuracy**"
