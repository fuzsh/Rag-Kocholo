For example, I'm a retired band director and would love to hear some brass bands. Not sure if concerts in the park will be listed in Time Out or other publications.\n\nAny suggestions of interesting things you have done besides the typical?\n\nAlso - I'd like a suggestion for good pub food in an interesting setting - maybe some place where I could strike up a conversation with the locals.\n\nThanks!"
