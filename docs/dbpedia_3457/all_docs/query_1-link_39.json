        "text": "Blackfriars station is a London Underground and National Rail station in the City of London. It is close to Blackfriars Bridge at the junction of New Bridge Street and Queen Victoria Street. It is in Travelcard Zone 1. The Underground station was closed until 2011 while refurbishment and major engineering works took place.\n\nBlackfriars station is being rebuilt and the office building above it demolished and replaced as part of the Thameslink programme. The mainline station remained open during this work except for a period of two months around Christmas 2010 when trains passed through without stopping. The Underground station was closed until late 2011.\n\nImages for kids\n\nEarly 20th century map showing Blackfriars station, then called St Paul's, and Blackfriars Bridge station south of the river, alongside Ludgate Hill and Holborn Viaduct\n\nView of the Southern Railway station in 1953 from a platform of the former Ludgate Hill\n\nLooking northwards at the 1977â€“2009 station from a departing train\n\nBlackfriars' roof is covered with solar panels to generate electricity.\n\nThe stumps of the old railway bridge.
