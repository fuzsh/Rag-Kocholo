        "text": "The interior photos are from a model apartment in the building. The model apartment is representative of both the quality and style of apartments offered at this location. Description, floor plan and photos are for reference purposes only. Actual apartment's dimensions, layouts and furniture may vary.\n\nThis modernly decorated and furnished 1 bedroom/1 bath apartment is strategically located in the center of the city of London in the Blackfriars area not far from the River Thames. This section of London is often referred to as 'the Wall Street of the UK' or the 'Square Mile'. Your furnished London rental is in an elevator building for convenience, with closed circuit TV cameras at the entrance for security. The actual floor the apartment is located on will vary according to availability. The Blackfriars area was named for an order of Dominican monks who inhabited a monastery adjacent to the property. The property is located on a site of great historical interest adjacent to Playhouse Yard, the former site of Shakespeare's Winter Theater.\n\nConstructed originally to inspire artists in the 19th Century, this residence has been carefully refurbished to retain its original charm and features. You'll be able to channel that peaceful, meditative vibe from the\n\nmonks that formerly inhabited this locale while you relax on the plush sofa watching TV in the living room of your sleek minimalist duplex London apartment. The one bedroom apartment is wireless broadband internet equipped and has a state of the art entertainment center including a flat screen TV with satellite channels, a DVD player and an i-pod docking station, perfect for when you feel the need to \"zone-out\". Off the living room is the open kitchenette area with microwave, dishwasher, coffee maker and toaster. Just off the kitchenette is a dining table that accommodates four people. The bedroom has a queen size bed with night tables and lamps on either side in addition to a second TV for your enjoyment. Through a sliding glass door off the bedroom you'll find the serenity of a spa-like en suite bathroom with tiled floor, glass enclosed shower area and deep soaking tub for relaxing in after a long day.\n\nWeekly housekeeping including a linen and towel change are offered at these serviced apartments but you also have the convenience of your own washer/dryer and iron/ironing board in the apartment as well.\n\nThe pulsating area offers a wealth of cafes, bars, restaurants and boutiques along with legendary pubs such as 'The Blackfriar' which is considered to be one of the City's finest public houses. Major local tourist attractions such as the famed St Paul's Cathedral, the site of many a royal occasion, the Millennium Bridge, the Tate Modern, as well as local shopping and entertainment attract an international audience of London businessmen and tourists alike.\n\nThe furnished London apartment is served by the Blackfriars underground station. The underground and National Rail offer direct access to London Gatwick Airport, Westminster, Tower Hill and the Docklands Light Railway, Liverpool Street and London Victoria and Paddington stations. A wide network of day and night bus routes encircle the property. Car parking facilities can be found nearby."
