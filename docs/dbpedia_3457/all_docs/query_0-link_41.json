        "text": "I was very happy to see that the new Blackfriars Station in London, designed by Architect Will Alsop [OBE, RA, Director, All Design], has been constructed, as of 2013. As an Alsop devotee, I had been following the design of this project, among others, including his earlier concept sketches and paintings of it [example below].\n\nPainting by Will Alsop [Courtesy of All Design]\n\nThen recently, my friend in Toronto, Caroline Robbie [BID, AOCA, Principal, Quadrangle Architects; previously former Managing Director of Alsop Architects Toronto Studio] posted a lateral view of the “bridge / shed” section at night – a sleek, glass and steel structure, illuminated in white and blue, floating above The Thames. So, of course, I had to see this new piece of high-tech “Architecture” on my trip to London last month.\n\nPhotograph by Caroline Robbie, Principal, Quadrangle Architects\n\nOnce there, I discovered this was more than merely a new “structure”, but an assemblage of events or places – mise-en-sequence – engaged with its surroundings in a way not usually seen: a silvery-grey thread binding neighborhoods on both sides of The Thames, stitched through the urban fabric at each end. To best describe this site, I wanted to portray it both as an efficiently designed “building”, and as a studied piece of “urban design”, similar to a park-like experience. This brought to mind the writings of the Architectural Theorist Abbé Marc-Antoine Laugier [Refer to his Essay on Architecture, 1753] [known much more for his Rationalism for building structures (illustrated by the “primitive hut”) than for his Romantic notions for city planning (garden or park as an analogy for a town plan) ].\n\nBlending these two, seemingly contrary thoughts on design, this project exemplifies, for me, how large scale works ideally function at once as Architecture [efficacy and simplicity] and Urban Design [Laugier’s description of the city as a park: “… wandering from one end to the other, [one] comes across something new, unique, startling in every quarter, … everything is in alignment without being monotonous, …”; and, for the plan of a city: “… casual, unexpected elements that vary the scene; great order in the details, confusion, uproar and tumult in the whole.” – the latter meaning, it is “delightful”.]\n\nLaugier’s writings suggest that, casting the plan for a city as a garden or park, the role of the Architect is similar to that of the Gardener, pruning the urban fabric [think C. Brown’s “Stowe Landscape Garden” or F.L. Olmsted’s “Central Park” here, rather than A. Le Nôtre’s “Gardens of Versailles” (which Laugier criticized as lacking water – meaning the “pleasures” of water) ]. The idea is to dig / model / sculpt and bring forth something new from what is already there [versus wiping everything out, and starting something new from scratch i.e., tabula rasa].\n\nAnalysis of Central Park, by M. E. Rusz\n\nHere, Mr. Alsop has worked through the urban fabric in this sense to enhance the potential these sites already possessed to create this new place, or series of places. And also, like a promenade through a landscape, one must wander into, through and around the entire Blackfriars Station project to appreciate its assortment of spaces, its unexpected delights, and in the end, its significant contribution to London’s new infrastructure and design of the public realm.\n\nPurpose:\n\nBlackfriars Station is a new commuter terminal, with the main entrance on the North side of The Thames, and a secondary entrance via the South bank. Previously, connections between the terminus of rail lines on the North and South sides of the river had to be made via the Underground [London’s “Tube” subway system], making for a disjointed and lengthy journey. Improvements in commuter lines by Network Rail / Thameslink 2000 now permit connections in Central London between King's Cross / St. Pancras Stations and London Bridge, with new stations at Farringdon and Blackfriars, located just North of the river, serving the City of London.\n\nArchitecture:\n\nThe 15,000 m2 [approx. 160,000 SF] station is not so much a “building”, in the sense of being one structure, but a promenade of spaces which link neighborhoods places, riverfront walkways, and the commuter rail itself.\n\nThe shed section [the largest area of the project] is an elegant, glazed structure, resting on a restored 19th century rail bridge. This section is a bit like a modernized “primitive hut” [the famous illustration accompanying Laugier’s text], replicated several times to create the covered platform, while nodding to the industrial age. As per the All Design website: “…[the shed / platform is] engineered to protect passengers from wind and hot summer sun and to contain the sound of the public address system. The platforms are not entirely enclosed, but benefit from natural ventilation.”\n\nThe design is unobtrusive, restrained – not a tour de force crying out to be seen, but an understated, new form of urban infrastructure supporting the transit needs of London’s citizens.\n\nUrban Design:\n\nThe park-like programme seems to serendipitously meander to accommodate, highlight and connect with the circumstantial conditions on each bank of the river. On the South bank:\n\nStanding on the Blackfriars Bridge, one can see the entrance below and beyond, but then must take a series of steps, a good story down, to first arrive at the level of the esplanade in order to approach the station.\n\nFrom here, to the left is a ramp down to an underground passage that skirts under the Blackfriars Bridge [part of the Thames Path], with glazed wall tiles that provide the history of the area.\n\nTo approach the station to the right: a walkway leads to a masonry structure two-stories-plus high, with the letters of the station name; overhead are glazed structures, housing upper level stairs / escalators, foreshadowing the movement above.\n\nWalking left under these, then turning right, the Thames Path passes through a circular glazed hall [coffee shop cum waiting room], affording views of the North bank, including St. Paul’s Cathedral, at all times; walking beyond this interior shelter, the Thames Walk continues as an outdoor esplanade.\n\nOptions at this point are: to continue along the riverfront, where there are additional restaurants, services, and galleries at the base of an apartment building, and eventually further East, the Tate Modern and Millenium Bridge; or, to pass through the station turnstiles and up to waiting areas and shed / platform to board the train.\n\nA similar sequence occurs on the North bank, which is part of the main, larger station, and is incorporated into the larger Puddle Dock Blackfriars mixed-use development [of which the Puddle Dock Hotel is also designed by Mr. Alsop].\n\nThe “shed” envelops the space of the river, so the upper levels / platforms also act as a virtual “great hall”, altogether celebrating The Thames as London’s primary public space. As a park-like environment, various modes of movement are accommodated without interference with each other [like the separation of walkways and transverse roads in Central Park]. The several sections along The Thames, and Bankside further East, here do not appear as “separate projects” but are highly coordinated into a clear, public space continuum. It appears that improvements are targeted at each end of this structure for appropriately placed, higher density development.\n\nIn Sum:\n\nThe “All Design” website [Mr. Alsop’s Architectural / Urban Design / Planning firm], summarizes the project this way: “The Blackfriars project reflects Alsop's ability to combine high value with high style and durability with elegance, to create a deliverable piece of infrastructure, which enhances London's rapidly developing public domain.”\n\nThank you Mr. Alsop for this shining example of excellence in transportation infrastructure and public space design!\n\nLink is:\n\nhttp://www.all-worldwide.com/what/transportation/blackfriars-thameslink-2000-station/\n\n[Note: All photographs are by Mary E.
