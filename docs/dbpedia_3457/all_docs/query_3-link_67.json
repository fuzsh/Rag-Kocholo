Indulge in culinary delights at Bánh Bánh, Good Neighbour, John The Unicorn, Voodoo Rays, and other acclaimed establishments. Immerse yourself in the cutting-edge cultural scene at the Bussey Building, Peckham Levels, and South London Gallery - all just steps from your doorstep.\n\nThe abundance of local establishments extends into neighboring hubs such as Camberwell and East Dulwich, while Peckham Rye Station's Zone 2 position ensures seamless access to central London in minutes. With services to London Bridge, Blackfriars, Kings Cross, Victoria, and Elephant & Castle underground stations, as well as the London Overground network offering direct trains to Canada Water (Jubilee line for Canary Wharf) and Shoreditch High Street, the possibilities for exploration are endless.\n\nNestled within one of London's greenest boroughs, the area offers a plethora of nearby parks, including the expansive Peckham Rye Park and Common, along with the quaint yet vibrant Warwick Gardens - all within a short walking distance, inviting residents to enjoy nature's tranquility amidst the urban landscape.\n\nShare of freehold - 106 years\n\nNo service charge\n\nCouncil tax band - C\n\nNestled within a striking Victorian structure, this exceptional two-bedroom private garden apartment boasts generous dimensions and occupies a prime location on the highly sought-after Denman Road near Peckham Rye.
