        "text": "Every building has a role to fulfil â for working, playing, making journeys, learning, healingâ¦ for living. Each function has its own technical requirements. But human health and happiness also have a significant bearing upon a buildingâs performance and success.\n\nSuccess can be measured by outcomes achieved. Is there a formula for achieving it? We think so, and call it âbuilding performance engineeringâ. Itâs about striking the right balance between science, art and economics, and applying ingenuity for enhanced outcomes.\n\nMott MacDonaldâs universe of creative thinkers is centred around our clients â you. Weâre joined-up across sectors and geographies, giving you access to exceptional breadth and depth of expertise and experience. We can offer fully integrated cross-disciplinary engineering, or services in a single discipline if that is your preference. Whatever your chosen procurement strategy, we will always be looking for opportunities to think across boundaries for the benefit of the project.\n\nApplied ingenuity\n\nYou can bring us on board at any stage of the asset cycle and weâll find all practicable means of enhancing its performance in economic, social or environmental dimensions. Or we can work with you throughout the lifecycle of your project, providing the joined-up thinking thatâs needed for optimum outcomes. It is our understanding of all phases of the lifecycle, from project shaping to through-life optimisation, that enables us to give best-informed advice within any phase.\n\nOur performance engineering approach applies equally to existing buildings, where the triple bottom line of enhanced value, reduced carbon and fitness for changing lifestyles drives an increasingly urgent need for improvement.\n\nThe fast-moving nature of sustainability means that there are constantly changing technology, financial and policy issues which offer new opportunities for clients in their search for the right sustainability solution. We have exceptional capabilities when it comes to transferring policy and knowledge across borders and nations and our building consultancy expertise is sought to influence all types of developments â from single buildings to whole communities and cities."
