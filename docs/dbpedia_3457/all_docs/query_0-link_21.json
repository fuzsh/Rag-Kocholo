As a result of the bombings that heavily damaged the nearby TOAN Conference, the railway bridge heading into Blackfriars station was destroyed, and the bridge near the conference collapsed as a result. When Albion issued a curfew, all train services in and out of the city were suspended and the station was closed.\n\nBloodline[]\n\nThe station appears at the end of Faster than L33T, when Wrench has to fly a drone through the Southwark borough and to the finish line just above the TOAN Conference.\n\nNavigation[]"
