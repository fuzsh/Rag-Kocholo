        "text": "Can you specify exactly where in Denmark Hill? I used to live off Camberwell Grove and generally felt very safe. The traffic can be very bad at Camberwell Green and if you are on a main road it can be noisy with sirens day and night due to the proximity to Kingâ€™s. It is much much better connected than ED however, being on about seventeen million bus routes and having mainline, the ginger line and Thameslink at the station.\n\nWhere in Denmark Hill is the main question.\n\nI personally love the green spaces and buzzy high street of East Dulwich/around Lordship Lane, but as others have noted Denmark Hill station and down the hill to Camberwell is much better connected transport wise. Also handy for Kings College Hospital!\n\nThere has been a big rise in antisocial behaviour recently around Greendale/the Dog Kennel Hill/Quorn estate with lots of muggings and robberies taking place there and on Grove Vale road/outside East Dulwich station. Maybe something to bear in mind.\n\nIf I had to pick I would probably choose East Dulwich, but then again the housing stock is much more expensive, so it depends what your priorities are.\n\nThe higher price is because of the ED villageyness, schools and general middle class family appeal of the area. Denmark Hill is more dispersed and a bit grittier but then places with more transport tend to be like that and you get the benefit of being closer in and better connected. I wouldn't say it's unsafe. There's always muggings in most parts of London and you just have to keep your wits about you, but I've lived all over south London for 30+ years and not had any trouble yet (touch wood!). Lived in Camberwell and Loughborough Junction, which I'd say was edgier than Denmark Hill, and would say I felt safer there than in some posher West London places because in the latter the streets were quiet in the way that no one would be there to help whereas in the livelier places it always feels safer to me as there's people around looking out for each other.\n\nThe area around Ruskin Park is very nice and safe feeling. A friend bought a big house there and loves it. The only downside of Denmark Hill is it's more of a between place but you've got Herne Hill and Dulwich and Brixton close by plus Kings hospital and the Charter School and buses/trains galore. It'll never have the estate agent fancy factor of ED but day to day that's not what matters. If you love the house, I'd trade ED for DH and not look back.\n\nCould anyone provide insights into the area's population structure?\n\nAre you asking if there are poor people living in â€˜Denmark Hillâ€™, ie Camberwell? Yes, there are, but there are also poor people in East Dulwich. The Dog Kennel Hill estate has an SE22 postcode .\n\nWe lived very nearby when I had DC1 and I used to go into ED for NCT classes, baby groups etc. Itâ€™s villagey insofar as it has an affluent middle-class community but the physical layout of the area isnâ€™t villagey at all and there is no natural focal point like Herne Hill as itâ€™s all scattered along the spine of Lordship Lane and its traffic. Affluent areas are of course targets for thieves. Do they still have a problem with expensive prams being nicked from peopleâ€™s boots? That was the big thing ten years or so ago.\n\nDenmark Hill is a very small area. There's a block of big houses above the park and, over the road, a large housing estate. Like most of London it is very diverse even in a small patch.\n\nEast Dulwich is larger and similarly diverse but I've never seen the big houses you get on Denmark Hill/ Herne Hill borders so it really depends what you are looking for.\n\nDo you know which bit you are looking at and what you need - schools etc?\n\nYeah to me Denmark Hill is just the train station and big Sainsbury's.\n\nAs soon as you start going down the hill it's Camberwell.\n\nOP if you mean the area between Sainsbury's and the hospital - it's fine. Yes it's inner London with everything that goes with it but it's generally fine. I suspect it is cheaper as it is not as near the chi chi cafes and cushion shops of Lordship Lane and North Cross road (but they are literally 3 bus stops or a short walk away should you have a yen for a cup cake or Â£50 cushion) and you are nearer the hospital and station - so more noise. And it is nearer Camberwell, which like Peckham, still seems to give some East Dulwich Clapham nappy valley refugees a fit of the vapours.\n\nI used to live the other side off the top of Coldharbour Lane and you get used to the sirens and air ambulance noise - eventually. ðŸ¤£\n\nI have always thought that Camberwell Green has the best infrastructure of any locale in the world.\n\nIt has: a large general hospital, a psychiatric hospital, two supermarkets, a refurbed victorian swimming pool, a new library, a court, and a police station. And a green. Its got it all. I think the green even has a farmers market.\n\nAnd the secondary school, which used to be quite rough was taken over by Ark demolished and rebuilt and has those trendy toilets which are just individual cubicles built into the corridor.\n\nAnd the train station at Denmark Hill and 40 billion buses.\n\nTbf, it also has a lively street life. But the police are right there for when it kicks off.\n\nI'd pick Denmark Hill every time, you can always get a 85, 176, or 40 to Lordship Lane. But the station at Denmark Hill has very good coffee and cakes, so you don't need the cafes.\n\n@Notgoodatpoetrybutgreatatlit\n\n@@I have always thought that Camberwell Green has the best infrastructure of any locale in the world\n\n:)\n\nin the world :)\n\nyou maybe kinda right.\n\nIt's crap for rail/tube, but\n\nI once read (but haven't checked) that it had a direct bus route to every single london rail terminal.\n\ndefinitely no shortage of buses and you can of course just bounce from one to the other for a continuous carpet ride.\n\n(ex north londoner who was once dragged to camberwell to see a university mate's family and wondered where the hell I was)"
