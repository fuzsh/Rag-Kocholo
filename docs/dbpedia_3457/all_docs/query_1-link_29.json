However, I see that this building has now gone. It was demolished within the last 2 hears.\n\nIt makes me wonder whether they were aware of the pending demolition of this building when they redesigned Blackfriars. It definitely looks like they have missed an opportunity.\n\nQuote: \"It doesn't help that they\"...... unquote. \"They\" of course being the DfT, not the TOC.\n\nThere was also quite a strong passenger campaign from people in the Beckenham / Orpington area for the peak SE terminators to continue into Blackfriars. It's also presumably useful to keep up some crew knowledge for the routes for diversionary purposes and for when Maidstone TL eventually happens...\n\nBut yes, it's a shame there's only the two terminating platforms. If something goes wrong in the core, or north of STP, Thameslink service is stuffed (and its happened a lot recently with wires down / damaged)\n\nI was under the presumption that some day the Sevenoaks services would eventually go through to a northern terminus?\n\nWhy would you want them to be able to access the bays - the process for service perturbation is to reverse at Blackfriars, London Bridge, East Croydon or further south in the through platforms. When services are running to plan, they run through and there is no need for access to the bay platforms.\n\nDuring engineering works there have occasionally been scheduled Gatwick to Blackfriars services diverted through Tulse Hill / Herne Hill to access the bay platform.\n\nIt reduces flexibility. It is more difficult to terminate a train at short notice if you can't dump it in a bay. You can't leave a train in a through platform\n\nHi,\n\nThe western bridge supports were from the first bridge and were deemed \"weak\" back in, I think, the 19080's.\n\nThey apparently would not be strong enough to support the weight of a train and are essentially abandoned. The new cross-river northbounf platform was bulit onto one of each of the pillars but just for the weight of the platform required encasing in concrete and stone. To have upgraded them to support the weight of perhaps two fully laden 12 car trains would have been incredibly challenging and expensive.\n\nIt may look like a wasted opportunity but I don't think there were any other options.\n\nCheers,\n\nJason\n\nIs there any reason why they didn't stick the two bays in the middle and run the through platforms outside them which would have avoided any conflicting moves in either direction? I am thinking here that if the layout was a single large platform area with the through tracks on the outsides and the bays in the middle and a single barrier line at the City end with the access to the Underground instead of two of these with the tracks in between? At the country end there would still be two separate accesses to the platforms as at present.\n\nWas there simply not enough space available to align the through tracks in this way?\n\nIt reduces flexibility.

The late decision to keep these services running through means that a layout with centre bays might have been better.\n\nCan't dump anything at Herne Hill or Kentish Town if there's no driver to take it there.

If there is no route through there is no need to keep the line clear, and any trains further in could get parked just anywhere until they could be reversed out or the blockage cleared.\n\nIs there any reason why they didn't stick the two bays in the middle and run the through platforms outside them which would have avoided any conflicting moves in either direction?

All Thameslink would have gone to London Bridge. But the commuters of Sutton kicked up a stink at losing their direct trains to City, Farringdon and Kings Cross St Pancras. They did this far too late to change the design.\n\nHowever, your layout would still have conflicts, with Thameslink through services diverging at the south end conflicts are always going to happen without grade separation.\n\nCan't dump anything at Herne Hill or Kentish Town if there's no driver to take it there.
