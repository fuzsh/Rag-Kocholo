        "text": "London's answer to the chicken that crossed the road is Blackfriars station. Since the original station opened in 1864 on the southern bank of the Thames, it has crossed to the other side of the Thames, been renamed several times, changed bridges, had its railway services near-constantly chopped and changed and it now straddles both banks.\n\nThe station, now famous for its impressive view, holds a few surprises in the form of its station entrances. Although Blackfriars has spent most of its life with only station entrances on the northern bank of the Thames, since 2011 it has an entrance on the southern bank too.\n\nThis was a key part in remodelling the station as part of the Thameslink Programme, a £7billion nine year project to bring the then-poorly performing cross-London Thameslink railway line into the 21st century, with the 242 metre-long 12 carriage trains we now benefit from. Prior to 2009, Blackfriars could only handle trains up to eight carriages long so needed longer platforms and more space to meet the increased demand.\n\nREAD MORE: Westminster Tube station gets permanent pan-African makeover with new Larry Archiampong artwork\n\nOver a three year period, the station was entirely overhauled, with the new southern entrance provided to provide additional step-free train-to-street access, and improve the flow of passengers in the station. If all the passengers on the longer trains had to use the existing entrance, there would have been dangerous overcrowding due to the lack of space.\n\nOne anomaly this did create is that you cannot reach the London Underground from the southern entrance, unless you have a valid ticket as there are two separate gatelines. However, it's a little known station entrance which is probably the most surprising element of the modern station.\n\nIf you alight from a Thameslink train on platform 1 and walk towards the back of the train, you will see a set of ticket barriers before a set of escalators which are signposted as the way out/connection to the London Underground Circle and District lines. Walk past the escalators and continue towards the control room you can see along the back wall of the station. To the right, you will find an extra corridor which continues to a subtle station entrance.\n\nThis entrance is connected to a series of pedestrian walkways which link up different office buildings either side of Puddle Dock and White Lion Hill, but unless any one of them is your ultimate destination, it is most useful to get to Queen Victoria Street, which is just downstairs from the immediate walkway. Just to the north of the station, a similar walkway over the railway line provides a prime vantage point for lovers of urbanism, architecture and railways as it overlooks the contrasting brutalist, modern and classic building styles of the Blackfriars area plus London's steepest section of mainline railway, the climb from City Thameslink to Blackfriars.\n\nApart from its station entrances and notorious view, Blackfriars is a transport trivia treasure trove. The Thameslink/Southeastern portion is set on the world's longest solar-power bridge as 4,400 photovoltaic panels sit above the platforms. Part of the original station stonework is preserved in the station concourse on the northern bank, with destinations passengers could buy tickets to (including mainland Europe) in the late nineteenth century.\n\nIf you have a transport-related story you think MyLondon should be covering email callum.marius@reachplc.com"
