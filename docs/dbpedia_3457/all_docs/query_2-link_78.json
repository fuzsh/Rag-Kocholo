        "text": "About Blackfriars\n\nBlackfriars is an area of central London, which lies in the south-west corner of the City of London. The name Blackfriars was first used in 1317 (as Black Freres from the French 'frÃ¨re' meaning 'brother') and derives from the black cappa worn by the Dominican Friars who moved their priory from Holborn to the area between the River Thames and Ludgate Hill in 1276. The area is now the location of Blackfriars station, and forms the northern bridge-head for both Blackfriars Bridge and Blackfriars Railway Bridge. Alongside the road bridge is Blackfriars Millennium Pier, a stop for river bus services on London River Services. The Victoria Embankment stretches along the north bank of the river west from Blackfriars to Westminster Bridge. Notable buildings in the area include the large Art Deco Unilever House. The older parts of Blackfriars have regularly been used as a filming location in film and television, particularly for modern films and serials set in Victorian times.\n\nFind out how much your flat or house is worth in Blackfriars.\n\nLocal Estate Agencies\n\nBlackfriars estate agents\n\nEC2 estate agents\n\nWhy not explore some other local areas\n\nSouthwark area guide\n\nCity area guide\n\nBarbican area guide\n\nBorough area guide\n\nClerkenwell area guide\n\nHolborn area guide\n\nCovent Garden area guide\n\nAldgate area guide\n\nWest End area guide\n\nBloomsbury area guide\n\nEC2 area guide\n\nPerformance cookies\n\nPerformance cookies let us collect information about how the website is used.
