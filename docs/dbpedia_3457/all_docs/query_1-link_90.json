If you’re only planning on staying for a few hours in a city, why pay for an entire day as you would with other luggage storage services?\n\nYou can store your bags with one of our luggage storage locations just around Blackfriars. Explore London hassle-free.\n\nLuggageHero storage sites are certified hotels, cafes, and shops. Advance bookings ensure space for your bags. The address and directions to our partner shops are available at the time of booking. All bags are insured up to once you have dropped off your bags and started our storage timer on your booking page.\n\nUse our map to find the nearest certified shops in Blackfriars\n\nBlackfriars\n\nBlackfriars, located at the eastern end of Victoria Embankment in the City of London, has a rich history dating back to the 1224 when the Dominican friars, also known as the Black Friars, established a priory in the area. The priory was an important religious and theatrical site and was used as a venue for early parliamentary conclaves.\n\nIn 1538, Henry VIII dissolved the Dominican order in England, and the priory was reduced to rubble. However, the site was soon revitalized when actor James Burbage acquired much of it to build the Blackfriars Theatre in 1596. William Shakespeare was also involved in the enterprise, purchasing a nearby property in what is now Ireland Yard in 1613. Although he made improvements to the former priory gatehouse, Shakespeare spent most of his later years in Stratford and passed away in 1616.\n\nHalf price compared to station lockers and airport lockers\n\nLuggage lockers, also called city lockers, are generally at least double as expensive daily compared to LuggageHero’s luggage storage service. Until recently, travelers could only stow their bags in these luggage lockers, offering little flexibility regarding pricing, where to go, and luggage deposit.\n\nAlso, LuggageHero offers stores in countless places so that you always have the option of dropping off your luggage in a safe environment. Unlike luggage lockers in stations and airports, LuggageHero offers both hourly and daily rates. LuggageHero strives to offer flexible and cheap luggage storage near you at all times.\n\nWe store all kinds of luggage – any size and any shape in verified stores\n\nLuggageHero’s users can store luggage of any size and/or shape in our storage locations. It doesn’t matter if it is ski equipment, photo equipment, or backpacks. In other words, you can get baggage storage, suitcase storage, luggage deposit, or whatever our satisfied customers call it safely as we accommodate it all. LuggageHero’s customers can choose to be charged by the hour or our daily rate, regardless of what they store.\n\nLuggageHero redefines convenience for travelers. Take advantage of our generous baggage allowance and leave your luggage and carry-on bags in our secure, innovative, and environmentally friendly locker storage. You can easily bounce into our store and embark on adventures unburdened by heavy luggage!\n\nWe can stow your luggage for several days\n\nLuggageHero also provides multi-day storage because flexibility is essential when traveling.\n\nLuggageHero offers a lower daily rate when you store your luggage for longer. From the second day onwards, our customers pay from only £4 per bag per day.\n\nDownload LuggageHero’s free luggage storage app\n\nFor greater convenience, you can download LuggageHero’s app to see all our locations near you.\n\nOpening hours\n\nWe have a variety of stores with different opening hours, so choose what fits you best! Go and pick the store here to see the opening hours.\n\nWhich payment methods are accepted?\n\nAll major credit cards are accepted. Be aware that the shops do not receive cash when using LuggageHero, and remember that the insurance on your luggage is valid only if the payment has been made directly to LuggageHero.\n\nCancellation of booking\n\nFor same-day cancellations, a fee of €5.00/$5.00/£5.00/DKK30.00 per bag will be charged for the booking, and for no-shows, a fee equal to the daily rate at the selected storage location will be charged starting at £4 per bag."
