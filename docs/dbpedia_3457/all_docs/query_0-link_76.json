        "text": "Hyatt Regency London Blackfriars opens in the U.K. capital\n\nThe hotel in London is the ninth Hyatt opening in the city, signalling Hyatt’s expanding brand footprint in the United Kingdom.\n\nHyatt Hotels Corporation has announced the opening of Hyatt Regency London Blackfriars. Marking a key milestone in Hyatt’s strategic brand growth in the U.K. capital, the 205-room hotel is the 14th property in the country to participate in the World of Hyatt loyalty program, demonstrating Hyatt’s vision for the United Kingdom as a priority growth market within its diverse and evolving brand portfolio. In the last five years, Hyatt has increased its presence in the UK from 5 to 13 properties, with 6 of those based in London.\n\nHoused in a historical building on the former grounds of King Henry VIII’s Bridewell Palace, Hyatt Regency London Blackfriars claims a prime spot in the City of London business and leisure district, home to global corporations, influential businesses, and law firms. Guests will be able to stay connected to all that the capital has to offer, with Blackfriars Underground and Rail stations, minutes away. Many of London’s most popular attractions, including St Paul’s Cathedral, Tate Modern and Shakespeare’s Globe are within walking distance from the hotel’s doors.\n\nIn line with the Hyatt Regency brand ethos, the hotel has been intuitively designed for productivity and peace of mind, with an environment for guests to work, engage or relax. Sophisticated guestrooms and suites boast contemporary finishes, high-end amenities, and dedicated workspaces. Three dynamic and diverse food and beverage concepts are poised to become new local culinary destinations, whilst a trio of optimised meeting spaces are on offer to host a wide range of dedicated meeting & events space in the hotel’s desirable central London location. Guests also benefit from access to a 24/7 state-of-the-art fitness centre.\n\n“We are delighted to welcome guests to Hyatt Regency London Blackfriars and take our place alongside our neighboring landmarks, businesses and cultural hotspots,” said Laurent Schauder, General Manager of Hyatt Regency London Blackfriars. “With our high-touch, responsive service, inventive food and beverage offerings and ideal location, Hyatt Regency London Blackfriars is soon to become the hotel of choice for anyone looking for a seamless, stress-free experience in the heart of the city”.\n\nGuestrooms\n\nDesigned by THDP Ltd, the hotel’s interiors are influenced by its local history. The building’s past life as one of King Henry VIII’s royal palaces is referenced in the luxury materials used throughout the hotel, with marble ceramics and gold finishes evoking its former regality. With Fleet Street, the historic hub of printing and publishing, just around the corner, Hyatt Regency London Blackfriars pays homage to the craftsmanship of the trade through the bespoke artwork inspired by the art of newspapers that adorns its walls.\n\n205 guestrooms and suites provide impressive views of the listed buildings that once held iconic printing presses, whilst others offer the chance to marvel at the famous skyline of The City of London. With 10 room categories and up to 70 square-meters of space, guests can enjoy the hotel’s stylish and modern guestrooms, complimented by ergonomic work areas, rainfall showers and luxurious, comfortable, aesthetics.\n\nFood and Beverage\n\nThree innovative food and beverage concepts are set to mark out Hyatt Regency London Blackfriars as the new destination for inspired cuisine, vibrant and experiential mixology.\n\nThe Chinese Cricket Club fuses traditional techniques and the finest ingredients to present a contemporary take on Chinese classics. The restaurant is named in honour of the story of the captain of the Shanghai XI cricket team, Feng, who travelled to England in 1857 with his bride Xiu. Arriving in Blackfriars docks, the couple made their way to Limehouse, where Xiu opened the first traditional Chinese restaurant in London. Their legacy lives on in the inviting backdrop of The Chinese Cricket Club and it’s rich and diverse menu of homemade dim sum and signature specialties.\n\nNew York and London meet at NYnLON, a neighbourhood-style bistro that celebrates the charm, heritage, and cultural influence of the two great cities. The all-day menu brings together local and sustainable dining, with elevated comfort food favourites, accompanied by an extensive drinks list showcasing authentic American whiskies and exceptional natural wines.\n\nEscape the hustle & bustle of the city at The Leaf and Cane, a South American inspired hideaway offering mouth-watering street food paired with crafted cocktails and premium rums. Bringing the lively flavours of Latin America to central London, The Leaf and Cane immerses guests in a colorful jungle, inviting them to uncover its hidden garden, secret stone vaults, innovative mixology, and a vibrant atmosphere.\n\nMeeting and Events\n\nFor stress-free events in the City of London, Hyatt Regency London Blackfriars offers up to 430-square-meters of flexible, purpose-built event space. Two stylish medium-sized areas have been designed to optimise productivity, and are well suited for meetings, interviews, or small group gatherings. The elegant main function room can seat approximately 150 people and is an ideal choice for conferences or large events, benefitting from state-of-the-art technology, enviable transport connections and a sophisticated city location.\n\nHyatt Regency London Blackfriars joins a growing list of Hyatt properties in the UK, and marks the ninth Hyatt branded hotel in London, joining Hyatt Regency Albert Embankment, Hyatt Regency London – The Churchill; Great Scotland Yard Hotel, part of The Unbound Collection by Hyatt; Andaz London Liverpool Street, Hyatt Place London City East, Hyatt Place London Heathrow Airport and Hyatt Regency London Stratford and Hyatt House London Stratford."
