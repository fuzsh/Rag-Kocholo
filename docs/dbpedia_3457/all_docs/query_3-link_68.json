        "text": "As one of the UK’s most iconic tourist attractions, the London Eye is a worthy destination on your travel bucket list and makes for a great activity in London. This impressive landmark stands proudly on the bank of the River Thames, offering incredible views of London’s cityscape.\n\nStanding at an impressive 443ft high, the London Eye currently holds the spot as the fourth largest Ferris wheel in the world. On a clear day, the views stretch all the way to Windsor Castle - so make sure you have a head for heights!\n\nSince the London Eye is in central London, you’ll find excellent transport links making it easy to get there no matter where you’re travelling from. What’s more, if you travel by train you can enjoy 2FOR1 entry to this popular attraction, and if you buy train tickets direct from SWR you can get great savings on packages that include the London Eye. Read on to find out more about the London Eye, including how to buy tickets, what else there is to do in the area and how to get there by train.\n\nVisiting the London Eye\n\nThe London Eye\n\nHop on the London Eye to take to the skies and bask in the unmissable panoramic views of the UK’s capital city. As one of the most popular tourist attractions in England, the London Eye attracts millions of visitors each year. Amazingly, the 32-capsule wheel was only planned to be temporary when it was built back in 1999—however thanks to its popularity among tourists and locals alike, it still stands proudly almost 22 years later.\n\nIt takes 30 minutes for the London Eye to make a full rotation and the capsules are pretty spacious, so you’ll have the chance to walk around and soak in the full 360° view of the big city. Keep your eyes peeled for more iconic tourist attractions, including the Houses of Parliament, Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, Buckingham Palace, St. Paul's, The Tate Modern, Tower Bridge and The Shard to name just a few.\n\nOpening hours are usually between 11:00 and 18:00, though these hours might differ during bank holidays and half terms.\n\nLondon Eye tickets\n\nSince it’s such a popular attraction, we recommend booking your standard or fast-track London Eye tickets in advance to secure your spot on the day you plan to visit. To claim your 2FOR1 offer, you must pre-book your tickets online with your voucher code - don't forget to bring the voucher with you!\n\nFrom discounts on theatre performances and exhibitions to afternoon tea and dining experiences at a reduced price, there are many different discounted experiences on offer through SWR Rewards when you buy direct on our website and app. Take a look at our full list of rewards and benefits in London.\n\nLondon Eye Experiences\n\nTo make your day out even more amazing, why not opt for a special London Eye Experience?

Alternatively, for a truly luxurious experience, hire a Private Pod for yourself and up to 15 other guests complete with fast-track boarding, and enjoy the 360° views from the heart of the city.\n\nTips for enjoying the London Eye\n\nOur top tip for getting the most out of your trip to the London Eye is to arrive early. The London Eye’s standard opening time is 11:00, but avoid long queues by arriving well in advance, or consider purchasing a fast-track ticket to jump the line.\n\nThings to do near the London Eye\n\nThanks to its central location, there’s so much to see and do around the London Eye.
