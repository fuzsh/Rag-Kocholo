        "text": "This week I visited our 21st-century contribution to this lineage: the new Blackfriars station, a project with similar ambition to its Victorian ancestors in terms of complexity if not scale. The £550 million remodelling of the mainline station is the most ambitious aspect of a London-wide upgrade of the Thameslink line, which runs between Bedford and Brighton through the City.\n\nThe route has been under growing stress for years as the number of commuter journeys has steadily increased and the improvements will allow for more frequent 12-carriage trains (from eight-carriages currently), and therefore carry more passengers more quickly. But how do you extend the platforms at a station hemmed in by the City and the Thames while maintaining the flow of commuters during construction of such an enormous project?\n\nBlackfriars’ platforms previously extended a little way across the river, downstream of Blackfriars road bridge, but the decision was made in 2009 to extend them along the whole length of the rail bridge, adding a new entrance on the south side, at Bankside, as well as a new improved one on the north, turning Blackfriars into a unique station that spans the Thames.\n\nLondon hasn’t had buildings on its bridges for a long time: not since 1831 when the old London Bridge (and the medieval houses and shops that occupied it) was demolished. It will be a distinctive presence in postcard views of the capital: a glassy bridge with London’s largest solar panel array on its serrated roof.\n\nAll of this, including the broadening of the bridge itself by nine metres, has been achieved while trains continued running almost throughout the three-year construction. Blackfriars Underground station is also open again after a nearly three-year closure to passengers (though District and Circle line trains continued to run through).\n\nYou might think that creating large-scale, complex buildings is fairly straightforward these days. We tend to gripe when these huge projects are late and over-budget, as if construction is as predictable as assembling an iPad in a Chinese factory. Consider the logistics, though. There was no storage on site, so every delivery, including the 38m-long roof trusses, had to arrive just in time to be put in place, often at night. The trusses arrived, appropriately, by train but much else was brought in by barge from downriver, beyond the Isle of Dogs. Two thousand people were employed on site at the peak of the construction. This is a significant achievement by the team of Jacobs, Balfour Beatty and Network Rail.\n\nMuch of the work is now complete and the new entrances have been in use since April. The train shed itself, however, will not be finished until Christmas, when we will be to see how marvellously bright it is, allowing north light into the platforms from rooflights in the distinctive roof. Glass facades to the bridge will also allow some great views of the Thames.\n\nTake a look at the station’s south entrance. This is a new single-storey glass and steel pavilion building, with a glass staircase leading up to the platform level. Sounds fairly simple. But it’s executed so clumsily that it comes off looking like the entrance to a leisure centre in Slough. The building’s glass façade is almost entirely obscured by unecessary amounts of white-painted steel frame (remember this is a bungalow, not the Forth Bridge). The entrance building is elliptical in plan, which does nothing to contribute to the public space of this odd riverside area: it is an even less distinguished addition to the London riverside than the concrete bunk of the Founders’ Arms pub, which it faces.\n\nOnce inside, you are faced with an array of materials chucked together with abandon. The plasticky, maroon panels on the walls look fragile enough to punch your hand through, and the reclaimed London stock brick is a nice material but out of place in the context of a 19th/21st century iron and concrete bridge. The staircase, which also gives great views of the river, is built like a temporary footbridge — all rattly steel components and clipped-on glass panels.\n\nOn the north side it’s even worse. Here the entrance is shared with the Tube and adds a generic piece of glass-curtain walling to the corner of Queen Victoria Street. The new station cowers blandly opposite the majestic Portland Stone sweep of Unilever House. Inside, the last fragment of the Victorian Blackfriars is used as a piece of interior decoration: blocks of sandstone carved with the destinations across Europe that were once available to travellers from here. Its simple material beauty mocks the paltry design ambition of the new station.\n\nWhile it is unlikely that most of its users will measure Blackfriars’ success by how lovely it is, I think it’s a disgrace that a public place of this prominence is left to visual incompetents to finish off. The original designers, architects Pascall and Watson, were replaced with giant construction group Jacobs for the execution of the project: an all too familiar story for public buildings today, as politicians have invented contracts that make prices more predictable and reduce the risks of overspend. This move only ever leads to the dumbing down of design quality and the loss of the original architectural vision. And before anyone complains about how expensive good architecture is, take a look at Jacobs’ $10 billion revenues last year. Keeping the original architects on is not more expensive: it’s a question of priorities and of imagination.\n\nIt is not the scale of the Victorian stations that thrills us. It’s the exuberant literacy of the gothic decoration at St Pancras, and the tracery and decorative details of Paddington’s roof, so grandly emerging from the rusty murk, These details make the scale comprehensible, they provide us with the foreground necessary to feel at home in these industrial-scale spaces.\n\nThere are moments when a building needs details, when the junction between two materials requires a skilful piece of design to elegantly resolve, or where a building’s purpose and role in the city needs articulation at small scale. Blackfriars has failed at the human scale even while succeeding in the efficient resolution of a complex engineering problem. This might not now be a problem, but no one will shed a tear in 80 years when it is once again taken to pieces and something new put in its place.\n\nArchitects and engineers have been working for centuries on ever more efficient, and often impressive, ways to span long distances and make large envelopes of space for train stations, factories, power stations and airports. But our new austere age, along with the search for architectural efficiency, has edited out details like decoration, identifiable entrances, signs, beautiful floor surfaces, humane moments of physical contact like door handles that every other era of architecture found important to the whole. Blackfriars is just the biggest, most visible example of a trend that must be reversed."
