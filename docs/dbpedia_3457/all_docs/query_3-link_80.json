The name refers to a huge estate and mansion house in Scotland.\n\nArchibald Corbett, a Scottish property developer, MP, and philanthropist, was recognized as the biggest house builder in suburban London at the end of the 19th century. His vision for the Corbett Estate was to create healthy living spaces, featuring homes with generous front and back gardens along wide streets, fostering a strong sense of community that still prevails today. The Corbett Estate attracts many artists and families with its blend of Victorian architecture, local schools, and green space.\n\nCatford centre, earmarked for significant growth and development, is becoming increasingly popular among homebuyers and investors. The area is renowned for its intact period housing, transport connections, and diverse community. The Catford Arts Trail is an event which encourages the community to visit the studios and homes of local artists and makers.\n\nAmbitious regeneration plans aim to make Catford one of the most vibrant and green town centres in London. Favourite local haunts include Good Food, The Bottle Bar & Shop, La Pizzeria Italiana, and the Catford Mews cinema. Transport connections are excellent; the Catford and Catford Bridge stations provide easy access to central London; from Catford the network runs Thameslink services to London Blackfriars and Sevenoaks, while Catford Bridge Southeastern services run to London Bridge, Charing Cross and Hayes.\n\nThe locale is also rich in educational opportunities, with a selection of local nursery and primary schools within proximity, including Sandhurst, Torridon, and Holy Cross. Prestigious independent schools like St Dunstan's College and Colfe's are nearby.\n\nHither Green station is approximately a fifteen-minute walk away, providing easy access into London; direct Southeastern services from Hither Green take 9 minutes into London Bridge.\n\nHither Green is highly regarded for its thriving community, popular schools, and a variety of independent shops with favourites including Arlo & Mo, Three Sisters, You Don't Bring Me Flowers, Crimson and Clover, Park Fever, and Good Hope, making it a hotspot for those seeking a dynamic and engaging community.
