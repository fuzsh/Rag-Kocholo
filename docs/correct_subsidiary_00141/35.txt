Oracle Corp. has agreed to buy

Siebel Systems Inc. for $10.66 per share. The offer is valued at approximately $5.85 billion, or $3.61 billion net of Siebel's cash on hand of $2.24 billion. The move is seen as a way of strengthening both companies' position in the market for customer relationship management (CRM) applications, a niche Siebel once dominated but that is now increasingly seen as the province of enterprise software giant

SAP as well as

Salesforce.com, a company that sells hosted services rather than software.

Before the ink was dry on the Siebel deal, Oracle also added G-Log, a vendor of transportation management systems, to its portfolio.
