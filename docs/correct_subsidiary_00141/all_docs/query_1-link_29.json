        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 12 - Oracle, the giant database-software maker, announced on Monday that it would pay $5.85 billion to acquire Siebel Systems, its largest competitor in the market for sales automation programs.\n\nThe deal will bolster Oracle's effort to topple its German rival SAP as the leading seller of business applications software for big corporations.\n\nIt comes less than a year after Oracle managed to achieve a hostile takeover of PeopleSoft for $10.3 billion after a contentious battle that dragged on for nearly 18 months.\n\nOracle says its acquisition of Siebel will make it the largest seller of sales automation software - a category also known as customer relationship management software. SAP remains a far bigger supplier of business applications over all, but the Siebel acquisition, said Lawrence J. Ellison, Oracle's chief executive, \"moves us closer to our goal of being No. 1 in applications globally.\"\n\nWhile the Justice Department tried and failed to block the Oracle-PeopleSoft deal on the basis that it was anticompetitive, industry analysts and antitrust experts do not expect the Siebel deal to encounter the same regulatory opposition.\n\nThe combined company will face considerable competition from SAP, as well as from Microsoft, I.B.M. and smaller rivals. And Oracle lawyers succeeded in the PeopleSoft case in convincing a judge that the enterprise software market was robust.\n\nUnder the terms of the Oracle-Siebel combination, which is subject to the approval of shareholders of both companies, Oracle will pay $10.66 in cash or stock for each Siebel share. Siebel now has $2.24 billion in cash on hand, reducing Oracle's net takeover cost to $3.61 billion.\n\nThe news was announced before the opening of the stock market on Monday. In trading, shares of Oracle rose 21 cents, to $13.49. Siebel Systems advanced $1.16, or 12.7 percent, to $10.29 on volume of more than 187 million shares - roughly one in every three of its shares outstanding.\n\nOracle agreed to exchange stock for up to 30 percent of Siebel. If the Oracle shares fall below $10.72 before the deal is completed, Siebel shareholders who choose stock will receive 0.994 share of Oracle for each share of Siebel stock.\n\nOracle executives said the deal would add 2 cents to 3 cents a share to Oracle's profit in the 2007 fiscal year, ending in May 2007. The company said it expected to repurchase any shares issued in the acquisition. While Oracle expects to have $5 billion to $6 billion in cash at the time the deal is likely to close, it said it would use about $1.5 billion of its own cash and borrow the rest.\n\nBeyond PeopleSoft, Oracle has acquired several companies in the last year, including Retek, another business software producer, which it bought in March for $643 million.\n\nMr. Ellison, speaking to analysts in a conference call on Monday, explained that Oracle had decided to wait for a few quarters after it integrated PeopleSoft before pursuing another large deal.\n\nOnce the Siebel acquisition is completed, most likely early in 2006, Oracle said it planned to promote Siebel's customer relationship management program over similar software developed by both Oracle and PeopleSoft. With Siebel, Oracle adds 4,000 customers, including some of the largest corporations, and roughly 3.4 million individual users.\n\nWhile Oracle's interest in Siebel had been known for some time, reaction was mixed on Wall Street.\n\nCharles Di Bona, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, said he thought that the merger would be far more difficult than Oracle indicated, and that incorporating another major product line into Oracle's development process would be a great challenge.\n\nWilliam Wall, a spokesman for SAP, said the deal would not cause SAP to change its strategy. \"We always anticipated that in order for Oracle to try to catch up with SAP, they would take this step,\" he said. \"We have the benefit of several years, and we intend to leverage that.\"\n\nBut it may be Salesforce.com that has the most to gain - or lose - from the Oracle-Siebel merger. The company, whose chief executive, Marc Benioff, was a longtime associate of Mr. Ellison, has had considerable success providing customer relationship management software through an \"on demand\" subscription service rather than a discrete product, a strategy that many large customers have come to prefer. Siebel, in recent years, has begun moving toward a similar model, and analysts say that Oracle is trying to move in that direction with this merger.\n\nDuring Oracle's battle to acquire PeopleSoft last year, Mr. Ellison told a court that Siebel had long been on his company's short list of potential targets.\n\nThomas M. Siebel, the chairman, had been an Oracle executive from 1984 to 1990. He founded Siebel in 1993. Since then, he and Mr. Ellison have sparred bitterly on occasion, but the relationship lacks the intense animosity that characterized Mr. Ellison's relationship with Craig A. Conway, the PeopleSoft chief executive, who unsuccessfully fought to prevent the takeover of his company.\n\nSiebel Systems has faced considerable turmoil in recent years; its revenue dropped to $1.3 billion last year from $2.1 billion in 2001. Mr. Siebel stepped down last year as chief executive and turned the job over to J. Mike Lawrie, a former I.B.M. executive. Siebel's board fired Mr. Lawrie in April after first-quarter results fell far short of expectations. George Shaheen, formerly of Webvan, took over as chief executive, but barely met revenue goals for the second quarter, and new license revenue was disappointing.\n\nMr. Ellison and Mr. Siebel said Monday that the merger was driven primarily by customers' desire to do business with fewer suppliers, an idea that Mr. Ellison repeated throughout the battle for PeopleSoft.\n\n\"What really moved these companies together,\" Mr. Siebel said, \"was a shift in market dynamics that has been occurring over the past three, four, five years.\"\n\nWhere in past years, customers were satisfied to pick and choose the best applications from a variety of vendors, the complexity of business today has led them to want to simplify those relationships, he said.\n\nSiebel has about 5,000 employees at its headquarters in San Mateo, Calif., south of San Francisco, and throughout the world. While Mr. Ellison said that Oracle, based nearby in Redwood Shores, would retain Siebel's specialized sales force, analysts said that many Siebel employees were likely to be laid off as soon as the deal was completed. Oracle laid off nearly half of PeopleSoft's 11,000 employees soon after that deal took effect."
