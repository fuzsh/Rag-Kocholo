        "text": "News Facts\n\nOracle today announced that it has agreed to buy Hyperion Solutions Corporation (Nasdaq: HYSL), a leading global provider of performance management software solutions, through a cash tender offer for $52.00 per share, or approximately $3.3 billion.\n\n\"The acquisition of Hyperion makes Oracle the category leader in the high growth enterprise performance management market,\" said Oracle CEO Larry Ellison. \"Hyperion's EPM software coupled with Oracle's Business Intelligence (BI) tools and analytic applications form an end-to-end performance management system that includes planning, budgeting, consolidation, operational analytics and compliance reporting. \"\n\n\"Requirements for Performance Management and Business Intelligence solutions are increasingly converging,\" said Hyperion Chief Executive Officer Godfrey Sullivan. \"Given the critical need for managers across the enterprise to align operational decisions with strategy, now is the right time for Hyperion to combine with a strategic partner like Oracle to deliver the first, integrated end-to-end Enterprise Performance Management System.\"\n\n\"Hyperion is the latest move in our strategy to expand Oracle's offerings to SAP customers,\" said Oracle President Charles Phillips. \"Thousands of SAP customers rely on Hyperion as their financial consolidation, analysis and reporting system of record. Oracle already has PeopleSoft HR, Siebel CRM, G-Log, Demantra, i-flex, Oracle Retail, and Oracle Fusion Middleware installed at SAP's largest ERP customers. Now Oracle's Hyperion software will be the lens through which SAP's most important customers view and analyze their underlying SAP ERP data.\"\n\n\"We expect this transaction to be accretive to Oracle's earnings on a non-GAAP basis by at least one cent per share in fiscal year 2008 and by at least four cents per share in fiscal 2009,\" said Oracle President and CFO, Safra Catz. \"Given the size of our global organization and the complementary nature of our businesses, we should recognize substantial revenue synergies and significant economies of scale.\"\n\nThe transaction is subject to customary conditions and is expected to close in April 2007. More information is available at http://www.oracle.com/hyperion.\n\nOracle will host a conference call today, Thursday, March 1, at 5:30 a.m. (PST) / 8:30 a.m. (EST) to discuss the acquisition.
