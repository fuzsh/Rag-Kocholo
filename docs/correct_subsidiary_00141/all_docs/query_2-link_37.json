        "text": "(This article originally appeared in the Mercury News on September 13, 2005.)\n\nOracle’s agreement Monday to acquire Siebel Systems for $5.9 billion marks the latest move by Oracle Chief Executive Larry Ellison to consolidate his hold on a maturing business software industry dominated by a handful of giants.\n\nSiebel Systems, a pioneering maker of customer-relations software that recently has struggled, is just the newest acquisition pulled off by Ellison and his brash lieutenants as they expand Oracle beyond its core database business to provide a range of applications that companies rely on to run their operations — and challenge SAP, the world leader in applications.\n\nThe agreement comes just eight months after Oracle completed its $10.6 billion purchase of PeopleSoft after an 18-month takeover fight. The deal will be Oracle’s ninth acquisition this year.\n\nThe purchase was approved by the companies’ boards over the weekend and finalized in the pre-dawn hours Monday, follows months of on-and-off talks between Oracle of Redwood City and Siebel Systems of San Mateo. Word of the talks began leaking out late last week.\n\nIncluding Siebel’s $2.24 billion in cash, the purchase will cost Oracle a net $3.6 billion.\n\nOracle agreed to pay $10.66 a share, a premium of $1.53 a share over Siebel’s closing price of $9.13 Friday. Siebel shareholders will get cash unless they elect to receive Oracle common stock, but no more than 30 percent of Siebel’s common shares may be exchanged for Oracle common stock under terms of the deal.\n\nShares of Oracle closed up 1.58 percent, to $13.49 Monday; Siebel stock got a 12.71 percent bounce, to $10.29.\n\nChallenges SAP\n\nSiebel Systems’ customer-relations management software, also known as CRM, is used by large companies to track sales leads, customer accounts and activities, and manage customer relations. Oracle’s recent purchases have helped it challenge German software company SAP, the leader in business-software applications.\n\nSiebel is the leader in CRM, with 4,000 corporate clients and 3.4 million individual users, Ellison said in a conference call with analysts. The deal, he added, “moves us closer to our goal to be No. 1 in applications globally.”\n\nSiebel Systems, like PeopleSoft, was led by a former Oracle executive. Company co-founder and Chairman Tom Siebel, said by observers to have had a rocky relationship with his former boss, Ellison, nonetheless willingly sat down to the bargaining table.\n\nThroughout the summer months, and even before then, Ellison and Siebel talked about a possible merger, said people familiar with the situation. Oracle Co-President Charles Phillips worked closely to seal the deal.\n\n“This deal is friendly,” Ellison said during a conference call. “We’ve been talking for a long time. We’ve been exchanging information.”\n\nTom Siebel founded his company in 1993 and owns 36.2 million shares of Siebel, worth more than $400 million, or 6.9 percent of the company. Ellison said Siebel has agreed to “work with us for some number of years” in an unspecified role.\n\nSiebel said the turning point came as he began to view the software world through the eyes of Ellison. The era of stand-alone, “best-of-breed” software companies is coming to an end, Siebel said. Instead, customers want low-cost products that can be easily knitted into their systems.\n\n“It was the change in market dynamics that really drove the timing on this,” Siebel said during the analysts call. “Some years ago there was a market preference for best-of-breed applications. Now the customer and partner community is communicating quite clearly, and voting with their dollars, that what they are looking for is an integrated family of applications that minimizes their cost structures.”\n\nThe drive to change comes, in large part, from customers, said Peter Coleman, an analyst with ThinkEquity Partners. “Customers are pushing back,” he said. “They don’t want to keep over-paying for the relative value they are achieving. It’s not an accelerating business anymore. You’ve got to lower the overall costs so they will buy more.”\n\nThe acquisition will add to Oracle’s profit in fiscal 2007, excluding some costs, the company said.\n\nThe deal is expected to close in early 2006, the companies said.\n\nSAP strategy\n\nSAP, outbid by Oracle for retail software maker Retek in March, does not intend to create another bidding war over Siebel Systems, said spokesman William A. Wohl. SAP’s acquisition strategy focuses more on small companies, he added. “We don’t believe you buy customers. You have to earn them.”\n\nOracle was vague about possible layoffs. The company will be “choosing the best personnel and the most logical fit through all of our operations to make the combined operations more efficient, ” said Chief Financial Officer and Co-President Greg Maffei.\n\nOracle has a steep technological obstacle to overcome as it tries to integrate all its software products. Before Siebel Systems, the company already had three customer-management product lines — Oracle’s, PeopleSoft’s and J.D. Edwards, which was bought by PeopleSoft.\n\nFurthermore, Oracle, if not careful, could push Siebel customers, many of whom use SAP software, into the arms of its German competitor if the new, merged Oracle software requires customers to do a major overhaul of their systems, said Sanford Bernstein analyst Charles DiBona.\n\nEllison said Oracle, with PeopleSoft comfortably integrated, seemed unfazed.\n\n“We are much more experienced at doing integration,” he said.\n\nThe Oracle co-founder also said his company doesn’t plan to go shopping again for anything large any time soon. “I don’t think you’ll see us do another major acquisition for some time,” he said."
