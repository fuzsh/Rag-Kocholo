        "text": "Anamaria Avram and Richard Spithoven\n\nThe year 2016 clearly is a landmark year for Siebel CRM software. Exactly ten years ago, Oracle Corporation acquired the then already successful Siebel Systems company. Fast forward: a brand new generation of Siebel technology will be released in the first half of this year with Innovation Pack 2016 (aka Siebel 16) and associated features. This will make the software even more business agile and competitive. Wrapping it up: Oracle Siebel has become a full-fledged CRM platform, ready to be enriched with any variety of cloud services you might wish to add.\n\nLicensing Siebel CRM – get your copy of our new white paper here.\n\nThe huge popularity of the original Siebel Systems software – pioneer in the CRM field – led Oracle to acquire the company in 2006. License-wise though, many things have thoroughly changed after that. In the separate concise sections of our new white paper, b.lay experts address many of the common issues for organizations to avoid in the context of non-compliance and financial risk.\n\nFoundational license domains\n\nIn short and to get to the point, the main foundational domains for organizations to become compliant and in control of their Siebel CRM software license management are:\n\nObtaining the proper License Keys;\n\nLegacy Pricing and Metrics vs. new policies;\n\nIntricacies of Authorization and Responsibilities;\n\nProfessional or Enterprise Edition of the software;\n\nExternal and Internal Applications;\n\nConcurrency and the Processor metric;\n\nand last but not least Custom Views.\n\nIn 2015, the Siebel customer base grew 20%\n\nThe year 2015 was quite an amazing year. It saw a 20% increase of the Siebel customer base, an extraordinary rise by all measures. The commonly agreed seven hallmarks of a bright future for Oracle Siebel CRM in servicing a broad range of existing and new enterprises are: versatility, low cost, reliability, top performance, standards-based design, complete compatibility and always-on security.\n\nCustomer Intimacy, Product Leadership, Operational Excellence\n\nSiebel today ranks high among software solutions and suites targeting the Customer Relationship Management processes and practices that are of great value to companies. Customer intimacy (CRM) together with product leadership (innovation) and operational excellence (business process improvement) are commonly hailed as the three keys to entrepreneurial success.\n\nTo conclude:\n\nSiebel CRM is a software solution that can provide a lot of benefits to your business, but requires a lot of in-depth knowledge and expertise to ensure that it is properly licensed. Any Siebel end-user not being audited before, in 99% of the cases has a license compliance issue."
