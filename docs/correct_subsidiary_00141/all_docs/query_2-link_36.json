        "text": "Though both Oracle Corp. and Siebel Systems have a stake in the healthcare IT marketplace, Oracle's acquisition of its rival Siebel - announced Monday - is not likely to cause much of a stir in the healthcare sector.\n\nThat's because the information technology that Siebel's healthcare division brings to the table is CRM, or customer relationship management technology, tweaked to especially address the needs of health insurers who want to track members and sales, said Eric Brown, analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass.\n\nOracle's earlier acquisition of another rival, PeopleSoft, likely gave Oracle a larger piece of the healthcare IT market, Brown said, since PeopleSoft's roots were in human resources and its applications were more enterprise resource planning type than Siebel's sales automation. PeopleSoft counted many hospitals among its customers, Brown said.\n\nBoth Oracle and Siebel declined to discuss the potential effect on the healthcare IT sector. Spokespeople for Oracle and Siebel said they would be discussing the impact on specific vertical markets once the companies had adjusted to the acquisition.\n\nOracle CEO Larry Ellison took the CRM view in announcing Monday Oracle's $5.85 billion purchase of its rival.\n\n\"In a single step, Oracle becomes the number one CRM applications company in the world,\" said CEO Larry Ellison. \"Siebel's 4,000 applications customers and 3,400,000 CRM users strengthen our number one position in applications in North America and move us closer to the number one position in applications globally.\"\n\nThomas M. Siebel, founder and chairman of Siebel Systems said: \"The combination of Siebel applications with the development capacity of Oracle to enhance our CRM product set assures our customers continuing success. This is a very beneficial business combination that will allow us to be even more effective in delivering high quality, leading edge solutions into the hands of satisfied customers.\"\n\nCRM applications capture and streamline all customer interactions so CRM users can better understand, service and anticipate their own customers' needs. Of all major segments of the enterprise applications business, CRM is the largest and fastest growing - estimated to be more than $8 billion in 2004 and expected to grow to $10 billion by 2009, according to industry analysts.. Siebel's CRM and Oracle's enterprise applications and middleware share an architecture that embraces industry standards, and a significant majority of Siebel's implementations run on the Oracle database.\n\nThe board of directors of Siebel Systems has voted in favor of the transaction, and Tom Siebel has agreed to vote his shares in favor of the acquisition. Siebel stockholders will convene in a special meeting to vote on the acquisition. Oracle stockholder approval is not required. While the transaction and the timing are subject to regulatory approvals, the deal is expected to close in early 2006.\n\nSiebel shareholders will receive $10.66 per share in cash for each Siebel share held, unless they elect to receive Oracle common stock, but no more than 30% of Siebel's common shares may be exchanged for Oracle common stock. In the event that Siebel shareholders holding more than 30% of Siebel common stock elect to receive Oracle common stock, the equity consideration will be pro-rated."
