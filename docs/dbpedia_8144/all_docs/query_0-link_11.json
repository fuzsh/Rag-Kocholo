        "text": "David Loyn reports from a training school for the Taliban - the Islamic student army - in northern Pakistan, and travels with a group of fighters to the frontline in Afghanistan.\n\nSee today's choices.\n\nAssignment 7.15pm BBC2\n\nAn Islamic student army, the Taliban, has seized control of the Afghan capital Kabul. So strict is their regime that they impose a curfew at night, young women are forced to wear a veil and denied the right to an education, and musicians have taken to burying their instruments for fear that their playing might be deemed \"unislamic\" and invite punishment.\n\nTonight's Assignment penetrates a Taliban training school in northern Pakistan, where passionate young fundamentalists are prepared to go to the Afghan frontline. But their sway over the people of Afghanistan is not complete. Resistance troops are already preparing to push the Taliban out of the country, setting the scene for a bloody religious war.\n\nTonight's documentary in the provocative arts strand follows comedian Eddie Izzard on his recent world tour, starting in his teenage home town of Bexhill-on-Sea in East Sussex and ending in New York.\n\nSee today's choices.\n\nTX 9.30pm BBC2\n\nA rare television outing for Eddie Izzard, the accomplished comedian whose free-flowing chat dispenses with jokes. In Je Suis a Stand Up: Eddie Izzard Abroad we accompany his current tour from Bexhill-on-Sea to New York. His hometown gig proves more of a success than Paris, where his decision to perform in his schoolboy French is, well, laughable. Eddie is engaging enough hanging out backstage in Scandinavia, doing interviews in Iceland and discussing his liking for women's clothing everywhere, but it's the tantalising glimpses of him on stage that count. Watch out for Pavlov's four-legged friends and Eddie's take on style - from his too-tight, shiny plastic trousers and lacy tops to his lime-green finger nails, he's got it."
