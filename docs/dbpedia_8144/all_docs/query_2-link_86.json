Dad left the family, causing Goldin to break ties with his father. Before he was 13, he had filmed more than 150 commercials. As a teen, Goldin made several appearances on sitcoms like KATE & ALLIE and ALF. In 1986, he landed a role on the sitcom HAIL TO THE CHIEF, starring Patty Duke. Although the show was canceled after 13 episodes, Goldin lived with Duke and her family for a year. At 17, he made his Broadway debut in On Golden Pond. He later hit the stage again as Danny Zuko in Grease and appeared in 42nd Street. Goldin broke into soaps when he was cast as ANOTHER WORLD's resident bad boy/rock star, Dean Frame. Originally, he had tested for a recast of Sam Fowler, but the show and his agents created the role of Dean for him. Goldin appeared from 1990-93 and 1994-95. Goldin produced a pilot for MTV called WIRED AND FIRED, which focused on 20-somethings getting hired — and subsequently fired — as quickly as possible. He also created a one-hour drama/comedy called DOIN' LIFE, in which he originally conceived a major role for Linda Dano (ex-Rae, ONE LIFE TO LIVE/GENERAL HOSPITAL/PORT CHARLES/ALL MY CHILDREN; ex-Felicia, AW; ex-Cynthia, AS THE WORLD TURNS). At the time, AW was ending and Dano couldn't do the part. In the past, Goldin has made no secret of his rocky love life. He has been engaged to Yasmine Bleeth (ex-Lee Ann, OLTL; ex-Ryan, RH) and Priscilla Lee Taylor, and was married to British TV personality Emma Ford. Now, Goldin prefers to keep his personal life private. His official Web site is www.rickypaullgoldin.com.",
