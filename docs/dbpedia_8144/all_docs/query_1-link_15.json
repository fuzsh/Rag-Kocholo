        "text": "Jennifer Douillard is an American voice actress who has done voice work for the Sonic the Hedgehog series. She is the very first English voice actress for Amy Rose.\n\nHistory[]\n\nAfter an eight-year career in television promotions, Douillard dabbled in voiceover work for local commercials, and online comics. Douillard also serves as the Media Broadcast Coordinator for the San Diego County Fair.\n\nDouillard first played the role of Amy in Sonic Adventure, released in 1999, and had been in every main entry game in the series since then, up until Shadow the Hedgehog, where she was replaced by Lisa Ortiz (who had also voiced Amy in the 4Kids English dub of the Sonic X cartoon series). To date, Douillard's role as Amy is her only nonlocal voice performance.\n\nCredits[]\n\nVoice acting[]\n\nSonic the Hedgehog series:\n\nAmy Rose (1999-2004)\n\nReception[]\n\nDespite being the first notable English voiceover for the character, fan reactions are mixed. On the one hand she is noted for having a pure-sounding voice.[1] Conversely, she is often criticized for not emoting properly, especially when compared to her successors.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nAmy Rose has been her only voice acting role throughout her entire career.\n\nAfter retiring from voice acting, she now resides in San Diego, California where she works as a musician and coordinator for the San Diego County Fair."
