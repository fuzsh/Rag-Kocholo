Danny Dodson will officiate. Interment will follow at Oaklawn Memorial Park in Center.\n\nWanda Englehart Ingerton was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, on February 27, 1946, to Robert Englehart and Norma Nichols Englehart. Her daddy, a German, was a master carpenter, and her mother, Irish, a Kansas City farm girl. Her family moved frequently and lived in several places throughout her life. When she was seven, their family lost the family ranch in Cortez, Colorado. They, in turn, moved to Victoria, Texas, because her dad found work there. Her daddy was an abusive alcoholic. She and her siblings dreaded the weekends because her daddy would beat their mom and destroy the house. They would sleep in the car on the side of the road.\n\nWhen she was eight, she and her sister became “bus kids” at a Baptist church in Victoria, Texas. During the invitation, she went forward and accepted Jesus Christ as her Savior. Her sister got mad because she was embarrassed, and it held her up from getting home. When they got home, two Baptist men asked her dad for permission for her to be baptized. He cussed them out and told them to get out of his house. Mama always told us she got peace with both Jesus and her dad that day. She said before she got saved, she hated him. However, after she got saved, she could forgive him and even love him. She got victory in Victory, Texas. This is why her daughter, Mrs. Tammy, loves the bus ministry. What a difference it made in her life and later in the life of her daughter.\n\nMany years later, a red-headed preacher, Bro. Roy Wallace, led her husband, Rhodes Ingerton, to the Lord when he was out soulwinning. She re-dedicated her life and was baptized at Central Baptist Church in Center, Texas.\n\nOn July 26, 1983, Wanda became employed with Walmart. She retired as a department manager on July 31, 2008, after twenty-seven years of dedicated service. Her hobby was crocheting.\n\nShe is survived by:\n\nChildren:\n\nTammy and husband Randy Hagler of Shelbyville\n\nWilliam Ben Ingerton of Shelbyville\n\nGrandchildren:\n\nAshley and husband Dustin Parker\n\nAlysse Hagler and Tyson Johnson\n\nDevlyn Ingerton\n\nSheridan Ingerton\n\nBrionna Ingerton\n\nAutumn Ingerton\n\nGreat-grandchildren:\n\nJaxon Parker\n\nDylan Parker\n\nLane Parker\n\nShon Parker\n\nBrantley Baldridge\n\nNova Lynn Bell\n\nBrother, Robert DWayne Englehart and wife Bonnie of Athens, Texas\n\nSisters:\n\nBetty and husband James Jenkins of California\n\nLinda George of Albuquerque, New Mexico\n\nNumerous nieces and nephews.\n\nPreceded in death by husband, Rhodes Ingerton; parents, Robert Englehart and Norma Nichols Englehart; brother, Ricky Englehart; and sister, Donna Sparks.\n\nPallbearers will be Anthony Parish, Devlyn Ingerton, Lane Parker, Sheridan Ingerton, Dylan Parker, Jay Bartlett, Shon Parker, Brantley Baldridge.\n\n“For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.” – Romans 10:13\n\n“Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.” – Psalm 116:15\n\nOnline condolences & tributes can be sent at www.watsonandsonsfuneralhome.com\n\n08/13/2024\n\nXavier Phillip Pierce, 29, of Porter, Texas, passed away on August 9, 2024, in Porter, Texas.

He had a love for sports from the time he could hold a ball, and even though he was always the smallest, he had the biggest heart on the team. Following graduation, he attended college at Stephen F. Austin, and was soon employed by Union Pacific Railroad. He quickly excelled in every job that he did and earned a position in the bridge department, following in his dad’s footsteps because of his talent for engineering and building bridges. Kaleb was very intelligent and learned many new trades such as taxidermy and woodwork. He was a true artist.\n\nKaleb had a love for anything outdoors. He enjoyed fishing and hunting and spent every spare second he had in the woods. Kaleb felt closer to God and most at peace when he was sitting in a deer stand, fishing, or chasing hogs. The only love that outweighed the one he had for the outdoors was the love he had for his family. Kaleb was a good father, son, brother, and friend. He loved his three girls more than anything in this world. Kaleb loved fiercely, and if you were in his circle, he would do anything for you. He was big on family and felt that it was important to stop and enjoy each other every chance you got. He never met a stranger and he looked for the good in everyone.\n\nKaleb courageously fought a battle with diabetes. His suffering and trials are now over, but his story is not finished. Kaleb in Hebrew means faithful, whole-hearted, and brave. This describes his character and how he attacked life every day. Hopefully his story here on earth will bring awareness and compassion toward all those who still struggle with diabetes today.\n\nKaleb is survived by:\n\nDaughters:\n\nPaislee Lynn Amos\n\nPailynn Rose Amos\n\nCharlee Claire Amos\n\nParents, Stephen and Debi Amos\n\nSisters:\n\nKristan and Mark Solomon of Timpson\n\nKelli Holloway and Kevin Smith of Timpson\n\nNieces and Nephews:\n\nCaden, Kallie, Kastan, Cameron, and Nayvee\n\nShelby, Kelsee, Emree, Lainee, and Jaycee\n\nGrandmother, Betty Amos\n\nAunts, uncles, numerous cousins and friends\n\nKaleb is preceded in death by his grandparents, James and Valeta Edwards; and grandfather, Tom Amos.\n\nPallbearers will be Mark Solomon, Caden Solomon, Bubba Messer, Damien Amos, Cameron Bennett, Rope Pride, Cole Milford, and Joey Hudnall.\n\nTo send condolences or to sign an online register, please visit www.mangumfh.net.

Upon graduating from Timpson High School in 1968, she went to work at, then Cotton Belt State Bank, now Austin Bank, where she spent her entire 46-year career until retirement in February, 2014. Through her career at the bank, she became friends with many in the community, and many came to rely on her for their banking questions. She met her husband, Buck Raines, after he returned from service in the US Army in Vietnam, and they wed on September 20, 1969. If she wasn’t working at the bank, she could often be found working in the hayfields beside Buck, until their sons came along. When she wasn’t busy taking care of her family, she could always be found supporting her beloved Timpson Bears Football Team. She was a true fan; nothing kept her from the games. It didn’t matter whether it was raining or freezing cold, if the Bears were playing, she was there. Nothing would stop her from making the trip to AT&T Stadium this past December to support her Bears when they won the state championship. She loved and supported her children in everything they did, and when grandkids came along, she did the same thing and was at as many events as she could possibly attend.\n\nShe is survived by:\n\nChildren:\n\nJohn Elvis, and wife, Angela Raines\n\nAndy, and wife, Rachel Raines\n\nMarc Raines\n\nMichael, and wife, Rachel Raines\n\nBrother-in-law, Cecil Whitton\n\nNephew, Joshua and wife Angela Whitton\n\nZoie Whitton\n\nGrandchildren:\n\nSheldon, and wife, Caylie Raines\n\nAshton Raines\n\nJesse Raines\n\nSadie Raines\n\nReagan Raines\n\nLuke Raines\n\nSara-Kate Raines\n\nReese Raines\n\nAddison Raines\n\nGreat-grandchild, Carter Raines\n\nAlong with other cousins, nieces and nephews\n\nJudy was preceded in death by her husband of 53 years, Buck Raines, her parents, Elvis and Nell Rhodes, and her sister Kay Whitton.\n\nPallbearers are Andy Raines, Marc Raines, Sheldon Raines, Cecil Whitton, Josh Whitton, and Bobby Rhodes.\n\nHonorary Pallbearers are Jesse Raines, Luke Raines, Reese Raines, Carter Raines, and Ben Rhodes.\n\nIn lieu of live flowers, please consider silk flowers to be used later or a donation to the Timpson Missionary Baptist Church.\n\nServices are under the direction of Taylor Funeral Home, Timpson."
