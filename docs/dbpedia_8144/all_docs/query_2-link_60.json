The hearing was convened, pursuant to notice, at 9:00 a.m., in room SD-215, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. William V. Roth, Jr. (chairman of the committee) presiding. Also present: Senators Grassley, Murkowski, Nickles, Gramm, Lott, Mack, Moynihan, Rockefeller, Breaux, Conrad, Graham, Moseley-Braun, Bryan, and Kerrey. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. WILLIAM V. ROTH, JR., A U.S. SENATOR FROM DELAWARE, CHAIRMAN, COMMITTEE ON FINANCE The Chairman. The committee will please be in order. This morning we begin the first of 3 days of oversight hearings into the tactics, management, and inner workings of the Internal Revenue Service. There is no other agency in this country that directly touches the lives of more Americans, nor is there any agency which strikes more fear into their hearts. The threat of an audit, the awesome power of the IRS looms like the Sword of Damocles over the heads of taxpayers. As Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, I want to know why. I wanted to understand where this fear came from. I wanted to know if it was justified. Our committee's responsibility is to provide the oversight of this agency. This is a responsibility I take seriously. So in January of this year, with the support of my friend and colleague Senator Moynihan, I began an investigation into how this agency conducts business with the American people. Let me assure you, there is no political bias, no partisan motive behind our investigation and these hearings. As I said, they were initiated some eight months ago. What we have discovered indicates that problems within the IRS are not recent, they cover several administrations. Let me also say that the IRS is made up of many fine men and women, men and women of great character and integrity who perform a vital and difficult job for this country. In reflecting upon our investigation, I found this to be especially true. I note that without the help of many such IRS employees, our investigation would have been incomplete. There is no doubt that the powers of the Internal Revenue Service are extraordinary. The IRS can seize property, paychecks, and even the residences of the people it serves. Businesses can be padlocked, sometimes causing hundreds of employees who are also taxpayers to be put out of work. In some instances, the first time a taxpayer is aware of any enforcement action by the IRS is when his or her bank calls to notify that funds have been frozen. The IRS can take these actions in many cases without giving the taxpayer notice or opportunity to be heard. This is an awesome amount of power to place in the hands of any government agency. Is it appropriate? Perhaps. But with such power there must be an effective counterbalance of responsibility. Why? Because the greater the power, the more extensive the damage that can be done if that power is abused. Any agency with such power must be above reproach, especially as that enormous power allows it to pervade the most sensitive aspects of our citizens' private lives. Congress has granted such power to the IRS. As a consequence, Congress has a fundamental responsibility to see that the IRS operates with the highest degree of integrity, honor, and ethics. As the Good Book says, where much is given, much is required. Unfortunately, our investigation today has found that in many cases such high standards are not being upheld. Over the course of the next 3 days we are going to see a picture of a troubled agency, one that is losing the confidence of the American people, and one that all too frequently acts as if it were above the law. This is unacceptable. Even high-ranking employees of the agency have come forward, at some risk to themselves and their careers, to speak with us. As a consequence of such risk, some employees who will testify have requested confidentiality, and we have honored that request. We have also talked with many private citizens whose lives have been altered by IRS actions. These men and women have related their sometimes tragic experiences, not out of vindictiveness or mean-spiritedness, but out of deep concern and a fundamental belief that such a violation of their civil rights should not have taken place, not in America. We have listened to these men and women and we are holding these hearings because one thing is certain: we cannot fix the IRS without knowing what ails the IRS. What we seek is constructive criticism, criticism with the intent to improve, not destroy, to protect, not denigrate. This is not IRS-bashing, it is oversight. There will be no condoning of tax protestors or any others who would misinterpret our objective to legitimatize anti-government attitudes or behavior. These hearings are about good government, about correcting problems within government, problems that are acknowledged by those whose lives are dedicated to public service. Responsible oversight is the best way to ensure that not only is the government meeting the needs of the people, but is the surest way of letting the people know that they have influence over, and a strong voice in, their government. That is what these hearings are all about. Just as the IRS is quick to say that no honest taxpayer should fear an audit, no government agency should ever fear a Congressional investigation into its activities. While it is imperative that Americans pay their fair share of taxes in an effort to establish and maintain necessary government functions, it is equally imperative that the agency charged with the responsibility for this activity be fair, honest, open, and accountable. With this introduction, I believe it is important to outline how we went about conducting our investigation. Our objective from the beginning was to keep our methodology fair, yet still be able to get inside the agency to uncover the facts. In reviewing the treatment of taxpayers we took various cases to the IRS and reviewed every document that we could obtain. We interviewed the IRS employees involved in the particular cases. Over the next 3 days, we will hear about a number of these cases. We will hear from taxpayers, IRS employees. It is important to understand that these witnesses are typical of far greater numbers who have been moved to contact the committee. These individuals serve as a sampling that demonstrate the significance of problems and concerns with the agency. The facts will be startling. For instance, while the use of pseudonyms is forbidden by the Internal Revenue Manual, except for those in the law enforcement areas, criminal investigations, and inspection divisions, many revenue officers have been issued false identification credentials. While the IRS suggests that that is to protect agents from assault, I am concerned that it makes them unaccountable. Even members of the Metropolitan Police force here in the District of Columbia, despite substantial danger, wear their true names on their uniforms. In the next 3 days, you will hear about an audit called Blue Sky Assessments. These are tax assessments made against Americans that have no basis in fact or tax law. They can either be designed to hurt the taxpayer or simply raise the individual statistics of an IRS employee. You are going to hear a lot about statistics and quotas. We have learned that even at managerial levels the drive to achieve the appropriate statistic has caused problems in many areas of the country. While the use of quotas is specifically prohibited in rating the success of agents or officers in their jobs, it appears to be commonplace. I believe this is outrageous, a major problem that has become part of the agency's culture. Levies and seizures are also measurements of employee performance. In one case, we learned a revenue officer was counseled for not keeping his statistics up, so he seized several properties the next day. Some officers who are able to collect the full amount of taxes due are often rated lower than those who have seized property. Seizures may be done for status and promotions as much as for enforcement. Not only are levies and seizures measures of an employee's performance, but so is the number of cases referred to the Criminal Division. In other words, while there may be no basis in fact for a criminal referral, a taxpayer's life may well be turned upside down simply to keep an employee's or district's performance statistics up. Liens and levies may be filed against those whom the IRS knows have no liability for a particular tax. Parents, relatives, a company employee may have liens filed against their property or have a paycheck levied in order to get the real taxpayer to comply. This is called the whipsaw technique. This practice was explained to us, when we go after everybody, we know somebody will pay. Now, one of the most distressing things you will learn from this hearing is the preference to audit middle and lower income tax payers, as well as small mom and pop businesses. This is almost incredible to understand. Certainly it is not for the high revenue that these kinds of audits bring to the Treasury. So why are these Americans audited? Because it is easy. Most often, these are the taxpayers who cannot afford to pay back. Beyond learning about the fear taxpayers have concerning the IRS, I was very much concerned about how agency employees themselves feel. Many express fear of being retaliated against for speaking out against the kind of abuses I have mentioned here. We have heard in our investigation that the use of false allegations of wrongdoing against targeted employees takes place. In fact, just the number of times we heard the term targeting in relation to harassment of employees was stunning, and certainly if this treatment bothers the front-line employees of the IRS, it is devastating to the American taxpayer. Over the next 3 days we will hear more about these concerns, as Congress has given the IRS significant power in an effort to help the agency carry out its tremendous responsibility. It is also Congress' responsibility to ensure that such power is being used prudently, constructively, and with regard for the taxpayer employees of the agency. What we are learning suggests that there are problems and begs that Congress address three fundamental questions. First, does the IRS have too much power? Second, if Congress were to limit that power, what expectations do we have that the new limits will be more effective than the old? Third, how do we go about changing the culture of the IRS? What we seek to do is help the IRS get back to its mission statement. That statement reads, ``The purpose of the IRS is to collect the proper amount of tax revenue at the least cost, serve the public by continually improving the quality of our products and services, and performing in a manner warranting the highest degree of public confidence in our integrity, efficiency, and fairness.'' Well, this is our desire, to be certain the IRS is not only good for taxpayers, but that it is also good for government. It is now my pleasure to call on our very distinguished Ranking Member, Senator Moynihan. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW YORK Senator Moynihan. Mr. Chairman, let me thank you and congratulate you on the hearings that we have now commenced. I have been a member of the Finance Committee for getting on to 21 years, and I do not believe we have had an oversight hearing. Oversight is our responsibility, and we are carrying it out. There is surely room for improvement in the Internal Revenue Service, and where we so determine, we should move legislation in a fairly rapid order. But I think it is also important to point out that a great deal of the problems of the IRS come about because of legislation which we ourselves have passed. There are now 9,451 pages in the Tax Code. In August, as not many of you will forget, we added 820. I mean, you could hurt yourself if you tried to lift it. That is a pattern we do not seem to be able to break out of in order to address this as well. I happened to have had the privilege for many years to know Erwin Griswold, who was dean of the Harvard Law School, Solicitor General, who wrote the book on American taxation. He tells how, as a young man in the Solicitor General's Office in the 1920's, he found himself being asked to do some work on tax matters. He said he thought of going to the Solicitor General, telling him I did not know anything about taxes, but I decided to go to the library instead. He would write to me, because he insisted right to the end of an old and distinguished age that he make out his own tax returns. He would tell me exactly how many hours it took. His last letter was April 12, 1994. It had taken him 98 hours to make out his relatively simple tax returns, and this was a man who knew as much about the subject as any man living. Well, all those IRS employees face the same problems Erwin Griswold faced, and they need our help as well as our oversight. I am happy to offer both. I think your theme of power and responsibility is exactly right, sir. Welcome, and let the games begin. The Chairman. Thank you very much, Senator Moynihan. There is no question but what the complexity of the tax laws make the job of administration and enforcement very complicated and difficult. At the same time, it must be administered in a way that is fair and civil to our American taxpayer. Because we do have two votes coming roughly, I think, at 9:30, I thought we would call, next, upon our two colleagues who are going to speak, as well as Congressman Hoyer, because I know he has to go back. Then afterwards, we will call upon the members for their comments about these hearings. At this time, it is with a great deal of pleasure that I call upon Senator Grassley, who was chairman of the Taxpayer Rights Tax Force of the Commission on Restructuring the IRS. Next, we will call on Senator Kerrey, who of course was chairman of that important commission. Finally, as I said, it is pleasure to have here the Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government. Gentlemen, I would ask that each of you restrict your remarks for 5 minutes, as we do have a very full schedule. Senator Grassley. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CHARLES E. GRASSLEY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM IOWA; MEMBER, THE NATIONAL COMMISSION ON RESTRUCTURING THE IRS Senator Grassley. Mr. Chairman, the issue is one of balance. The Federal Government, of course, needs to collect all of its revenue which taxpayers are obliged to pay. But taxpayers have certain rights that should not be abused. All of us should support a proper balance between the two. Yet, over the years such a proper balance has been lacking. It is for this reason that some of us seem to be advocates for the taxpayers without being mindful of the importance of revenue collection functions of the IRS. Any serious objective observer should acknowledge the necessity of balance. But when evidence mounts of IRS abuses and mismanagement, it is time to look beneath the surface and search for a systemic, cultural problem. We did that and we found them. A ``we'' versus ``they'' mentality seems to exist, and that is not a healthy situation. This is not an indictment of the dedicated front-line IRS employees. Typically they do an outstanding, yet thankless job for the public. It is not they who should be the targets. Rather, it is the management culture, mindless of the fact that they are servants of the people. If allowed to persist, such a mind-set often leads to arrogance, unresponsiveness, disregard of one's rights, and the very kinds of things that we have been hearing from our constituents. When the Congress attempts to investigate, we are often derailed. A cloak of secrecy goes up. It is more veiled than even the most elaborate secrecy arrangements at Langley. In the language of the Federal Government it is called 6103. That is the section of the Tax Code that prevents disclosure of taxpayer information. Designed to protect taxpayer privacy, it does much more. It also protects the privacy of those who abuse the taxpayers' rights, who mislead Congress, and who might use collection quotas in tax enforcement despite their illegalities. Such abuses occur when independent oversight is lacking. Oversight has a rather antiseptic quality about it. Hence, the commission's recommendations for an independent board over the IRS. This board would set appropriate performance standards, would measure performance, then reward or discipline managers according to that performance. Oversight means more general openness. The commission found that the IRS is a very insular organization. As a result, we have put forward a first step to make the IRS more open to the public and to the press. If we are to be successful in changing the culture of the IRS, a key ingredient is openness. The chairman of the commission, Bob Kerrey, was absolutely right when he noted at one of our hearings a point about the media. He said the media and the press are one of the key ways in which Congress finds out what is going on. So the commission, to encourage more openness as well as more accountability, prescribed the following three remedies in S. 1096. The IRS must be more timely and responsive in FOIA requests. The IRS must not abuse its authority under 6103. The commission found that the IRS did abuse its authority in hiding from the press the fact that the agency had provided false information to the Congress. The IRS must maintain and preserve records. It has not. Many requests by the commission for documents and data were met with a statement that such data no longer existed. Addressing these three areas of openness may not be headline-grabbing, but in my experience, together with other measures, these will help bring more accountability to the IRS. The IRS should be held to the same high standards that the agency itself applies to the American taxpayer. The commission did not call for the easy solution that often comes out of commission, to provide just more money. The IRS, until 2 years ago, had seen continual increases in its budget for 40 years. Indeed, the commission uncovered that hundreds of millions of taxpayers' dollars had been wasted. Clearly, the problem at the IRS is mismanagement, not money. S. 1096 is designed to address many of these management failures. I urge the committee to look favorably upon it. Meanwhile, the commission did not conduct serious oversight investigations to root out IRS cultural pathology. This is where the commission's job ended and the job of this committee begins with this week's hearings. Understandably, these are controversial hearings. The IRS is not used to be overseen. Untoward motives are assigned to our oversight efforts, like partisanship, but that is a tired argument. I intend to be an active participant in these hearings. In the 1980's, I was hardly partisan when I clashed with the Republican administration over defense issues, the same with the chairman of this committee. I have been overseeing IRS abuses as far back as the Reagan and Bush Administrations. In addition, I launched my efforts to oversee the IRS. I was joined by my close friend, David Pryor, a Democrat, and a close friend of the President's. We chose to make our critiques responsible instead of partisan. I believe the record reflects that. The charge of partisanship has no credibility with respect to oversight efforts. It will be a fair airing of questionable practices by an agency abusing its trust. I have learned over the years, Mr. Chairman, that oversight of the IRS is a step-by-step process, a long-term commitment. We learned of the agency's quota system back in the 1980's and we outlawed it. Suddenly, we find there might be an unofficial back-door quota system still in place. It seems like you put out a brush fire here and it pops up someplace else. The moral of the story is, history teaches the need for constant vigilance over the IRS. So, Mr. Chairman, I commend you for your leadership in holding these much-needed hearings. I would also like to say publicly how much I appreciated working on the commission with Senator Kerrey. His guidance and leadership produced a solid, credible effort. So, Mr. Chairman, I thank you for starting us down this road. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Grassley. [The prepared statement of Senator Grassley appears in the appendix.] The Chairman. Senator Kerrey? OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. J. ROBERT KERREY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM NEBRASKA; CO-CHAIRMAN, THE NATIONAL COMMISSION ON RESTRUCTURING THE IRS Senator Kerrey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First of all, I want to congratulate both you and the Ranking Member for your balanced opening statements. I appreciate that very much. Holding these hearings is also very helpful. I would ask unanimous consent that my entire statement be a part of the record. The Chairman. Without objection. [The prepared statement of Senator Kerrey appears in the appendix.] Senator Kerrey. Mr. Chairman, this commission held 12 days of public hearings, we had hundreds of hours of testimony from taxpayers and tax experts, we had 300 private interviews with front-line employees. From my experience in oversight on both the Appropriations and on the Finance Committee, we had an unprecedented amount of access of the IRS. We found a number of things. First, the IRS is relatively efficient compared to other tax collection agencies worldwide, spending about half of 1 percent of total collections, which is substantially less than many other nations do. But there was a disconnect between that efficiency and the taxpayers' own view of this agency, and that is what we are dealing with here. It is very important to note that the dissatisfaction with the agency did not begin with our criticism of the agency, it began with the taxpayers' own evaluation of what the IRS was doing. In the area of services being performed, there is a breathtaking gap between what the IRS can do and what the private sector can do. Taxpayers do not compare the IRS with a tax collection agency in Australia or the Federal Republic of Germany, they compare it to what they can get with their ATM card. There is a tremendous difference between what the IRS can do and the private sector can do. Another big area that comes in for criticism is secrecy. Senator Moynihan has a new book coming out. I read the galleys over the weekend. It really is a first-rate historical examination of how secrecy has been built up inside of agencies after laws have been passed. Secrecy and power, it seems to me, Mr. Chairman, run hand- in-glove. So this issue of secrecy that Senator Grassley has talked about was heard from consumers. The complexity of the Code is obviously something that we create. Then layer onto that the inability to apply technology. What started this commission in the first place was the wasting of some $4-$6 billion of taxpayer money on a technology system that, in the end, did not work. So that was the first finding, that there was a disconnect between apparent efficiency compared to other tax collection agencies and what the consumers thought. Blame was evenly balanced between Congress and the Executive Branch. There was an awful lot of attention given to the fact that 85 percent of the American taxpayers voluntarily comply, 15 percent do not. But the 85 percent who voluntarily comply are unwilling to give the IRS more enforcement power when they appear to be exercising that power sometimes in a very arbitrary and capricious fashion, and in a way that is difficult for us to examine because of the survey issue I have mentioned. We recommended change in three big areas, Mr. Chairman, with S. 1096. First, we recommend the creation of an independent agency. Second, we recommend the creation of a complexity index against which we can measure our proposals dealing with tax proposals. Third, we recommended a series of things that Senator Grassley has already dealt with in the area of shifting power to the taxpayer by giving the taxpayer more access to the information and what is going on inside the IRS, in other words, by shifting from secrecy to openness. The common criticism that I have heard from opponents deals with the independent board in S. 1096. Those of us who sat on this committee and listened to the new commissioner of the Social Security Administration understand the value of having independence. The value of independence is, you can be more accountable to what the people are asking for rather than succumbing sometimes to just an ideological view. This independent board, has been called a take-over by American CEOs, giving corporate executives the opportunity to run the IRS. You will hear that over, and over, and over, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. I want you to hear what our proposed law says. It says, ``The composition of the board shall be 9 members, of whom 7 will be individuals who are not full-time Federal officers or employees who are appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and who should be considered special government employees, one shall be the Secretary of the Treasury and one shall be a representative of an organization that represents a substantial number of IRS employees who is appointed by the President.'' Mr. Chairman, our legislation has the support of not only the National Taxpayer Union, but also the National Treasury Employees Union. It has the support of professionals that work with taxpayers to fill out their tax returns, it has the support of the most recent IRS Commissioner Peggy Richardson, and it has the support of two former Treasury Secretaries. We attempted to respond in a balanced way to critiques of our Board and our legislation. There may be ways to improve our legislation, but it is going to be difficult to improve the legislation unless, first of all, we get a chance to be heard in an accurate fashion rather than to be heard in a fashion that distorts the content. Again, I congratulate you and I thank you for holding these hearings. I appreciate very much again your balanced opening statement, as well as the opening statement of Senator Moynihan. The Chairman. Thank you very much, Senator Kerrey. Now it is my pleasure to call upon our good friend, Congressman Hoyer. STATEMENT OF HON. STENY HOYER, A U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FROM MARYLAND Congressman Hoyer. Mr. Chairman, Senator Moynihan, members of the committee, thank you very much for giving me this opportunity. I have spent about 13, 14 years as a member of the Appropriations Committee overseeing IRS, and I am very pleased to have this opportunity to be here. I want to congratulate Senators Grassley and Kerrey for their work on the restructuring commission. I think an overwhelming majority of the work is very positive and I agree with it and hope to support most of that report. Mr. Chairman and Senator Moynihan, and the 102,000 men and women of the IRS who are responsible for collecting 97 percent of the Nation's revenue have, as Senator Kerrey has pointed out, one of the most difficult jobs in government. They collect the funds that pay to defend our freedom, educate our children, and take care of the old. At the same time Congress has flattened their funding and cut enforcement, we have also implemented new parts of their mission. The trend is asking the IRS to broaden its mission. Recently, for example, the Congress instructed the IRS to help in the important work of recovering child support payments, an important objective but added work. Against this backdrop, the commission wisely recommended ``Congress provide the IRS certainty in its operational budget in the near future,'' and called for ``greater stability with funding levels.'' As the commission has pointed out, Congress' failure to pursue consistent policies, as Senator Moynihan, and you, Mr. Chairman, have pointed out, have undermined the IRS in the performance of its functions. The vast majority of taxpayers in our country pay their taxes on time, voluntarily. Nevertheless, the IRS only collects about 84 to 85 percent of the taxes that are due. There is currently a balance due of $216 billion. When some do not pay their fair share, this increases the deficit and raises the burden on all of the rest of us. From the point of view of fairness alone, it is necessary for the IRS to carry out its enforcement. Nevertheless, in any large organization, however necessary enforcement is, the power that goes with that enforcement may be abused. Senator, you talked about power and responsibility, that being the focus of this hearing. Absolutely correct, in my opinion. Two years ago, of course, Congress revisited the problem of IRS abuses with the passage of the Omnibus Taxpayer Bill of Rights. In its report, A Vision for the New IRS, the IRS Commission on Restructuring found that this law ``had an important effect on changing the culture of the IRS.'' Mr. Chairman, you mentioned that. The commission has found that, in fact, the culture is changing. The commission went on to find ``very few examples of IRS personnel abusing power.'' None of us deny that it occurs, all of us believe we ought to eliminate it. But the good news that the commission found was that it is the exception. Even one instance, of course, is one too many. IRS management has followed up on cases aggressively to determine what went wrong and to take appropriate action. But I believe that even appropriate action, after the fact, Mr. Chairman, as you, I am sure appreciate, cannot erase the pain that some taxpayers have experienced. I am encouraged, therefore, that the IRS is following up with a service-wide program to stop this kind of abuse before it happens. This program includes centralizing and including training on the provisions of both the first and second Taxpayer Bill of Rights, creating taxpayer surveys that rate employees' treatment of taxpayer, and other efforts. Treasury and IRS has reaffirmed their commitment to the original Taxpayer Bill of Rights. A joint Treasury/IRS National Performance Revenue Task Force is currently conducting a 90-day study of customer service. I am sure it will be spurred on by this committee's actions, Mr. Chairman. Ultimately, however, I believe that a solution to the problem of taxpayer abuse cannot be separated from the larger task of building the IRS of the future. Senators Grassley and Kerrey have spoken of that. The Treasury Department, the IRS, the Employees Union and the Commission on Restructuring have identified a common set of concerns. To build the IRS of the 21st century, they have identified the need for renewed focus on oversight, leadership, flexibility, improved budgeting and tax simplification. The IRS has been rightly criticized in recent years for its failure to manage well. Particular focus has been directed at attempts to modernize the information systems. For the first time in the 15 years, Mr. Chairman, that I have been reviewing the IRS budgets, the Secretary of Treasury and the Deputy, for the first time, are giving personal attention to IRS management issues. This new focus is clearly making a difference. I am encouraged that Secretary Rubin has identified a candidate in addition to that to head the IRS who has a non- traditional background in management and information technology, Charles Risotti. The Senate will be considering him soon. Mr. Chairman, I will leave the balance of my statement, but let me conclude by saying this. It is important to point a spotlight on areas of abuse in the collection activities. Our constituents rightly expect us to protect us from abusive and legal actions. This objective is particularly important when such actions are done in the name of law enforcement. At the same time, we must do so in a way that does not undermine those who are performing crucial law enforcement missions. Mr. Chairman, you and I know there are scam artists, criminals, who are trying to place an additional burden on their fellow Americans by not contributing their fair share. Law enforcement is never easy. It is always subject to abuse. It is important that those of us in public life oversee and ensure that the abuses are eliminated or, at the very least, kept to the absolute minimum. I congratulate you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Moynihan, and others for pursuing this worthy objective. The Chairman. Thank you very much for appearing here today. We look forward to working with you in the future. [The prepared statement of Congressman Hoyer appears in the appendix.] The Chairman. Now, we are coming towards the end of the first vote, so I will recess the committee to enable us to go down and make two votes. I ask the members to come back as quickly as possible, because I am going to reopen the hearing to permit members to make their opening statements. Senator Kerrey. Mr. Chairman, may I with respect ask whether or not you intend to ask me, Senator Grassley, or Congressman Hoyer questions? The Chairman. No. Senator Kerrey. No questions? The Chairman. No questions today. We have such a full schedule. Senator Kerrey. I see. The Chairman. The committee is in recess. [Whereupon, at 9:46 a.m., the hearing was recessed and reconvened at 10:22 a.m.] The Chairman. The committee will please be in order. We will now turn to our fellow members of the committee for any opening statement that they make care to make. I would ask that they be limited strictly to 5 minutes since we have already lost a great deal of time because of the vote, and have, as I said, a full schedule. I would also point out that we go down the list under the early bird rule. The next person I have that is here is Senator Graham. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BOB GRAHAM, A U.S. SENATOR FROM FLORIDA Senator Graham. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to express my appreciation to yourself and Senator Moynihan for holding these hearings today. I would like to start by placing a call. This is a call to the 800 number of the IRS, in order to give us a laboratory test of how long it takes to get a response to a citizen's message. Senator Gramm. Hold it up to the mike so we can hear it. Senator Graham. Mr. Chairman, this is obviously a critical agency. We have now reached the computer response. We are not interested in information on the new tax legislation. We know too much about that already. [Laughter.] Senator Graham. This is a critical agency. It is critical that it be competent, fair, respectful of people, capable of carrying out its function. It is also true that many aspects of the Federal Government are anonymous, unknown to the American people. The activities of the IRS are often too well known to the American people and form the basis of the American people's assessment of how government, in general, operates, that which they have contact with, that which they cannot see. Unfortunately, what the citizens of my State and the Nation are saying, is that they are having too many adverse impacts with the IRS. What is your name, sir? Mr. McDowell, first, I want to thank you for having answered the phone in less than two minutes. I would like to get back in touch with you, if you could hold for a moment, and discuss some specific issues. Could you hold? Good. Thank you. [Laughter.] Senator Graham. What I would like to talk to Mr. McDowell about are some of the concerns that have been expressed by my constituents, including the difficulty of getting someone on the telephone. One lady from Ft. Meyers who says she is 69 years old said that frequently it had taken her up to 30 minutes in order to reach someone on the telephone. Another gentleman from Orlando said that he has been waiting for 6 months to get a response to a question, and that he has called the 800 number and has encountered not a human being, but frustration. Those are some of many examples of the response of citizens to their attempts to make contact with this critical Federal agency. As we proceed with these hearings, Mr. Chairman, I think that it is important that we do a physician's quality assessment of this agency in order to diagnose, what are the components of its pathology. We will no doubt encounter, as the commission chaired by Senator Kerrey did, a number of those, but I would suggest, too, it might be particularly appropriate for our concentration. One, is the human dimension, whether it is a large insurance company or Disney. Those firms which depend upon their ability to relate effectively with the public make a major commitment to the human beings within their organization who are that contact with the public. I am concerned that the IRS has not made that sufficient commitment in terms of the standards of training, support, and leadership for its people. I am struck with the fact that the IRS is not unique in this circumstance. I have had the opportunity to have extensive dealings with the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and many of the same concerns that we have and will hear about the IRS are also said about that large Federal agency. So we may, in the course of this set of hearings on the IRS, develop some concepts that would have broader application in the Federal service. The second area is our primary responsibility, and that is the complexity of the Tax Code. Senator Moynihan has already dramatically illustrated the fact that we added another approximately 10 percent to the complexity of the Tax Code, at least in terms of pages, by the action that we took just a few weeks ago. I would hope that, as a result of these hearings, the impact of that complexity on citizens' response would be fully understood, and again that we would develop some concepts as to how we might move towards the path of greater simplification. It struck me as ironic that, whereas in 1996 one of the key discussions of the Presidential election, including Senator Dole's proposal for a 15 across-the-board reduction in tax rates, were completely ignored in 1997 when the Budget Agreement was struck and the tax reductions developed. Nobody talked about using tax reductions as an opportunity for simplification. They became the source of a fairly massive degree of additional complexity. So Mr. Chairman, I commend you and Senator Moynihan for undertaking these hearings, and look forward to the diagnosis and effective prescriptions that the hearings will bring to our attention, and that we will then have the responsibility to implement. Now, back to my phone call. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Graham. This is the first time I have seen anyone conduct business during a hearing, but I congratulate you for your effective use of time. I think, Senator Conrad, you are next in line. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. KENT CONRAD, A U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH DAKOTA Senator Conrad. Mr. Chairman, I am not going to call anybody. I am probably the only person here who was a tax administrator. I was the tax commissioner for my State before I was elected to the United States Senate. So I think I have an appreciation for---- Senator Moynihan. That has got to be sort of a record, people rewarding a tax commissioner. [Laughter.] Senator Conrad. Well, both Senators from North Dakota are former tax commissioners, so that is a dual record. We were elected to the U.S. Senate, I think, because we gave good service to people. We were fair, we collected the taxes that were owed, but we gave very good service and we did not have to abuse people in order to collect taxes that were due. Mr. Chairman and Senator Moynihan, I think most people understand that, as a society, we have an obligation to pay what is owed and due. That is how we support the common defense, that is how we educate our young people, that is how we support our elderly, that is how we build the roads, bridges, and airports that allow us to function as a society. So we have to collect the revenue that is necessary to pay the bills. Frankly, over the last 5 years we have seen quite a remarkable turnaround for the Federal Government. The Federal Government was in a circumstance five years ago in which it could not pay its bills, was not even coming close. It was running record deficits. But because of actions that were taken, we are now on the doorstep of balancing the unified budget in this country, and that has led to an economic resurgence. I say this, because I think it is important to put into perspective what we are doing here today. Clearly, we must have a revenue agency, whether it is the Internal Revenue Service or some other such agency. We have to collect the money necessary to pay the bills. On the other hand, nobody can tolerate abusive behavior. I think we also need to put that into perspective, because the vast majority of men and women that work for our revenue service do not abuse anyone. They go about their jobs quietly and in a dedicated way, and perform very well. I had, when I was tax commissioner, many exchanges with the Internal Revenue Service and I found a high degree of professionalism, a high degree of commitment, many people who had dedicated their working lives because they believed what they were doing was in the public interest. So I do not want to be a part, and I do not think anybody here wants to be a part, of some trashing of people who do not deserve it. But this is a very large organization and there are people who have made mistakes, and they are serious mistakes, and that cannot be tolerated. It is totally unacceptable that IRS staff abuse others, that they threaten them, and that they use coercive tactics. That is not acceptable and that should not be permitted. Those who are responsible for it ought to be punished. We should make that clear. But, Mr. Chairman, I think we should also make clear there are some here with an agenda that is beyond fixing something that is broken, or at least in part is broken. There are some who come here with a political agenda, and I also find that troubling. I note in a Washington Post story that there are some who have been sending out fund raising letters with statements like, ``We want to end the IRS's reign of terror.'' Well, I do not think the IRS is engaged in a reign of terror. There have been abuses, certainly. Are those abuses unacceptable? Absolutely. I think to assert that the IRS has been engaged in a reign of terror is pretty loaded language. Another fund-raising letter that went out from a colleague had the ``People vs. IRS Survey'' and said, ``Armed with your responses and demands, GOP leaders can call for televised Senate hearings on the IRS.'' A former IRS commissioner, Lawrence Gibbs, IRS commissioner under President Reagan, as a matter of fact, is concerned about any attempt to make a partisan issue out of this agency. He said, and I think this is something for us to keep in mind, ``Using highly partisan language to attack the IRS is very irresponsible and can lead to undermining the public's trust in the tax system, which is dangerous.'' Again, that is the former commissioner under President Reagan. So I think in conducting these hearings that it is very important that we keep things in perspective. Where there are abuses, they ought to be stopped. People who use coercive tactics and who have violated the law ought to be punished. But we also need to keep in mind we need a revenue agency in the United States to do the very difficult work of collecting those revenues that we as a Congress said people are responsible to pay. We have done that because those revenues support our National defense, they educate our young people, they assist our elderly. In saying that, Mr. Chairman, I think we all need to move forward in a constructive way, identify what is wrong, figure out ways to fix it, and implement those changes. I very much appreciate the way the Chairman and Ranking Member began this hearing. I think you have sounded just the right note. The Chairman. Well, thank you, Senator Conrad. Again, let me emphasize, when we began these investigations 8 months ago, their purpose was to develop constructive criticism, constructive criticism that would result in reform to benefit the American public, as well as the employees of the agency itself. That is the way these investigations have been conducted. These hearings are not intended in any way to be partisan or political, they are in the interest of good government and that, I shall insist upon. I think we will turn, at the suggestion of Senator Moynihan, to Senator Gramm. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. PHIL GRAMM, A U.S. SENATOR FROM TEXAS Senator Gramm. Mr. Chairman, let me join everybody else in thanking you and Senator Moynihan for holding these hearings. I think it is important that we take a long, hard, close look at the IRS and how it works. I do not think our dear colleague from North Dakota has to worry about anybody undermining the credibility of the IRS. I think if you look at what the witnesses are going to say here over the next 3 days, the IRS has done a very good job of doing that for itself. I want to make three points in my opening statement. Number one, I do not have any sympathy for people who are trying to cheat on their taxes. I think the IRS not only has a license, but a mandate, to go after people who are engaged in fraud and who are cheating other taxpayers by not paying their taxes. I hope that nobody gets confused here as to what we are concerned about. I want the IRS to use the full power of the law to make people pay the taxes they owe and to pursue people who are cheating. Second, I think we are all concerned about stories that we hear every day from our constituents about how they are being abused, about how heavy-handed the IRS is, and how it uses tactics that we would view, and I think the average American would view, as inappropriate. Now, one of the things I always try to do is to take such comments with a grain of salt, because I do not always know what the facts are. I have never been one of these people that automatically assumes the government is wrong because somebody says they are engaged in bad behavior, but provides no proof. But I have followed enough cases in my State through the whole process to reach the conclusion that, while the vast majority of the people at IRS with a very difficult job are doing a good job at it, there are people who use the power to intimidate that obviously working for the IRS gives them the ability to do. We are all afraid of the IRS; I think every American is. I think it is important to have some system, to have checks and balances, to oversee and hold people accountable for what they do. Now, how to do that, how to get the balance between going after people who are cheating and not abusing people who are simply trying to comply with a very complicated law, where most of us, even those of us who may have had at some time some expertise in these areas, find it impossible to do our own taxes? It is a very delicate balance. I came to the hearing because I wanted to discover how to do it, not because I wanted to tell anybody. Finally, I would note the obvious point that today government is spending about 31 cents out of every dollar earned by every American. Next year we are going to have the highest tax burden in American history. If we do not change Medicare and Social Security, at an absolute minimum, within 25 years the payroll tax is going to be 30 percent, not 15 percent. The average working family where husband and wife work, is in the 28-percent Federal tax bracket. So 25 years from now, with the status quo, at a minimum, the tax rate of the average working blue collar family is going to be 56 percent. Obviously it is going to be very, very difficult to collect those taxes. So I think while we are looking at the IRS and while we are looking at its abuses, part of the long-term reform is tax simplification where it is easier for people who want to comply, to comply. But I think part of the reform is to look off in the future 25 years and say, is that the America we want? Do we really want to have an agency that is trying to take 56 cents out of every dollar earned by average working Americans? I think the answer to that is no. We need to begin to try to make those changes over the next 25 years to keep that from happening. So, Mr. Chairman, this is a very difficult subject. It is clearly a subject that deserves intense Congressional scrutiny. I know what I would like to see us do. That is, use our resources to go after people who are violating the law and be sure we are respectful of people who are simply trying to comply with a difficult law, but trying to tell the difference between those two cases is very, very difficult. Obviously, it is very difficult for a person at the IRS to know the difference between the two. Clearly, change in the code of conduct is due, and that is something that we ought to be leaders in trying to produce. So, for all of these reasons in a very difficult subject, I am very grateful for these hearings, and I thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Gramm. Now I would call on Senator Bryan. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD H. BRYAN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM NEVADA Senator Bryan. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. No citizen should have to endure what Monsignor Ballweg, Ms. Jacobs, Ms. Lund, and Mr. Savage, who will testify tomorrow, encountered in their experiences with the IRS. There is no excuse for this kind of conduct, attitude, or treatment of law-abiding citizens who are attempting to comply with their legal obligation to pay their taxes. Having said that, the tax collector has never enjoyed great public favor. From King Solomon's time, the tax collector has been despised and reviled, so it comes as no surprise that the IRS is an easy target for criticism and a convenient whipping boy. As pollster Frank Lance points out in his widely distributed memo to Republican members of Congress, in the language of the 21st century, nothing guarantees more applause and support than the call to abolish the Internal Revenue Service. I expect Mr. Lance is probably right about generating applause, but that does not make it the right thing to do. Unfortunately, someone needs to collect taxes. Federal tax collection is a task of monumental proportions. Last year, the IRS collected $1.4 trillion in taxes. It processed 209 million returns, including 119 million individual income tax returns. It disbursed $110 billion in refunds, and handled 105 million requests for information. By any standard, this is a very difficult job. I believe that the great majority of the 102,000 employees of the IRS are neighbors, our fellow citizens, who do their best to meet the demands of this often unpleasant task in the best manner that they can. None of this is to suggest the kind of egregious conduct by the IRS that we will hear about this week is or can be justified, nevertheless, the IRS has made numerous improvements which have made the always unpleasant task of paying taxes a much less difficult ordeal for millions of Americans. More than 19 million Americans filed their individual returns electronically in 1997, an option that results in faster, more efficient service and with greater accuracy. For the 4.7 million of those electronic filers that used Telefile, the annual ordeal of paying Federal income taxes amounted to only a simple, 10-minute toll-free phone call to the IRS. While these successes do not excuse the serious problems the IRS needs to deal with in other areas, they do reflect a continuing effort to improve the culture of the IRS and to attempt to make it more taxpayer friendly. The hearings before this committee this week will prove titillating, shocking, and to a large extent will accurately point out some very serious problems within the IRS. Undoubtedly there are IRS personnel who behave badly, who abuse their position, who are vindictive and abuse the taxpayer. These employees ought to be identified and immediately terminated. There is much we can do to improve the management and operation of the IRS. Senators Kerrey and Grassley led an important bipartisan commission to examine the problems in the IRS. While there is disagreement over some of the specific recommendations, the commission report is an important starting point for what could be a substantial reform of the IRS. Many of the problems with the IRS, of course, as has been pointed out by a number of my colleagues, lies right here in the Congress. In many ways, the Congress has charged the IRS with an impossible task. The ever-increasing complexity of the Tax Code places enormous burdens on both taxpayer and IRS employees, both of whom oftentimes are trying to do the right thing. This year's tax bill, of course, is no exception. The bill, which most of us supported, creates entire new mazes of confusing requirements that taxpayers will need to work their way through. Many of the provisions are effective starting this tax year, which means IRS personnel will need to have forms, guidance, and appropriate training in place by the end of this year. Already we are told that we need to pass technical corrections, which will then need to be incorporated into IRS procedures. The hearings before the committee this week will provide more fodder for the IRS's critics, and I fear that some may use these hearings to pursue partisan advantage in future political contest. Reckless, inflammatory criticism of the IRS may be good political sport, but it can incite violence among tax protestors. Nevadans were shocked in December of 1995 by a botched attempt by so-called tax protestors to bomb the IRS office in Reno, Nevada. Despite the unpopularity of their duties, IRS employees are public servants who should not be forced to work in hostile circumstances and should not be expected to work under circumstances and conditions that threaten their health and safety. We do need to reform the IRS, get its computer system working better, institute better management practices, and terminate those in service who abuse their positions. I am confident, Mr. Chairman, that you intend to use these hearings as a basis to pursue real reforms of the IRS, and I pledge to work with you as we undertake the business of reforming the IRS. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Bryan. Senator Nickles? OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DON NICKLES, A U.S. SENATOR FROM OKLAHOMA Senator Nickles. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. I want to compliment you and Senator Moynihan for these hearings, and also compliment Senator Grassley and Senator Kerrey for the work that they have done in trying to reshape and rehabilitate the IRS. Mr. Chairman, it needs to be done. The Tax Code is far too complicated, in many cases far too complex, and in many cases not fair. This committee has an opportunity, I think, to highlight some of the problems we have with the Code, maybe some problems in enforcement of the Code, and some injustices as well. We have, as Senator Bryan mentioned, over 100,000 IRS agents. That is a lot. I would certainly concur with Senator Gramm's statement that most are very, very honorable and do an outstanding job. They are, indeed, public servants. But clearly there have been some real abuses, and those need to be stopped and they need to be stopped now. The IRS has unbelievable authority to wreck lives, ruin businesses. They can cause anxiety. There is not a phone call that can probably give people more anxiety, than the IRS wants to audit you, or they want to talk to you about your return. Automatically that sends chills down the spines of taxpayers, taxpayers, in most cases who have been very honest. In some cases, maybe they are not honest and it is certainly justified. But we will hear some cases of abuses and those abuses need to be stopped. Mr. Chairman, I believe we also need to make sure the IRS is not being used for political purposes. It bothers me when I read news accounts that organizations aligned philosophically the opposite of the current administration have been audited. I think we need to review that. We need to find out and we need to make double-darn sure that is not happening for political purposes. But when you hear reports of audits of conservative groups and you do not hear it from opposite-minded groups, that bothers me. Mr. Chairman, just look at the Code. The Internal Revenue Code, Senator Moynihan mentioned, I think, is 9,400 pages. We recently added several hundred pages. This is the IRS code. The Bible, to compare it, is quite a bit smaller. Senator Gramm was studying it, and I would encourage him to continue studying it. The Bible has something like 8,045 words. The IRS Code has over 5.5 million words of law and regulations. There is no comparison. I might mention, there is a lot more wisdom and value in this book than there are in these books. We have added to the complexity. In the last tax bill that we passed, and I think most of us have said that it was a pretty good tax bill, we added 285 new sections to the Tax Code, we amended 824. So we made it even more complicated, more complex. In my opinion, the tax code needs a significant overhaul. We need to really reduce this to something that most people can understand, and hopefully replace it with a fair, flat, and simple Tax Code. Mr. Chairman, when you have something like 5.5 million words of rules and regulations, when you have 17,000 pages of rules and regulations, we have got a real problem. So we have 102,000 agents trying to enforce the law. We have 480 different forms. Right now, the IRS sends out 8 billion pages of forms and instructions every year. 8 billion. That is phenomenal. Last year, the number of information forms exceeded a billion. That is a lot of 1099s that somebody is supposedly trying to keep track of. The number of corrections that were sent out are estimated to be over 10 million per year. The number of corrections. The number of penalty notices sent out in 1994 were 33 million. In 1993, there were 8.5 million times that the IRS gave the wrong answer to taxpayers who were seeking some information. In 1987, the GAO said that 47 percent of the calls to the IRS resulted in inaccurate information. Congress recently spent $4 billion to upgrade IRS's computer capabilities. It has been a dismal failure. Now, Senator Bryan mentioned the electronic filing. That has been a success. So, we have had some decent improvements in their technology. But, as Senator Kerrey mentioned in his opening statement, I think the IRS is way behind the 8 ball as far as keeping up with modern technology. The EZ-1040 that everybody is supposed to be able to understand and do so quickly and simply has 31 pages of instructions. So, Mr. Chairman, I think this committee has a big challenge before us. I think we need to eliminate the abuses. We need to be sure the IRS is in check, that it is doing its job, that it is not abusing its power. I think we have a real challenge and responsibility to see if we cannot simplify this very complex and inequitable system. I thank you for your efforts. Senator Moynihan. Mr. Chairman, could I just take a moment? The Chairman. Senator Moynihan. Senator Moynihan. I would just remind all of our committee members that you and I have asked the Joint Committee on Taxation to examine politically motivated audits, and we will have a report later this year. Senator Nickles. I appreciate that. Senator Moynihan. If there are, they had better stop, and fast. Senator Nickles. Thank you, sir. The Chairman. Next on the list is Senator Lott. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. TRENT LOTT, A U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSISSIPPI Senator Lott. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will be brief so that you can go to your panels that you have lined up. I ask consent that my entire statement be placed in the record. The Chairman. Without objection. [The prepared statement of Senator Lott appears in the appendix.] Senator Lott. I want to also join others in commending you, Mr. Chairman, and the Ranking Member for having these hearings. I have maintained for years, including this year, and will continue to push for it in the future, that as a matter of fact Congress should have a lot more of this type of hearing. We should have investigative and oversight hearings into how the laws are working, how are the agencies' bureaus and departments functioning, not from the standpoint of trying to be punitive, but trying to find out how the laws are working so we can do a better job in changing them and making them better for the American people. So I think we are performing our duty here in having this oversight hearing, trying to find out, what are the abuses at the Internal Revenue Service. No agency should be above the law, no agency should take matters into its own hands, regardless of whether it is convenient or not. So we need to check into these allegations that we have heard about intimidation and pressure and threats. Because of these hearings, I have been receiving calls from around the country, including my own State. Just yesterday I had one from a former IRS revenue officer, now a CPA. He pointed out a particular case where he said, ``there was no doubt in my mind that the goal was not to find a way to get the taxes paid that were owed, the purpose was to put the business out of business.'' I have had other calls that really alarmed me along those lines. I think that the purpose here should be to have a good, strong bipartisan hearing. I know that is the intent, and that is the way it will be. I hope it will not be the last step, but only the first step. The next step would be leading us to the necessary changes, perhaps, in the law that will change the culture that maybe has developed over a period of years in this agency, and I hope that it can be the first of this type of hearing, that maybe we will look at other agencies by other committees. So I think we have a worthy goal here, to find out what has been happening, where there are abuses, if any, what the problems are, and see what we could maybe do then in terms of legitimate, needed reform. I look forward to the hearings both today, on Wednesday and Thursday. I am trying to cooperate by, in fact, the Senate not coming in until noon on Wednesday and Thursday so that we can have our full attention devoted to these very important hearings. I thank you, Mr. Chairman and Senator Moynihan. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Lott, for those words. Now I would call upon Senator Rockefeller. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER IV, A U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA Senator Rockefeller. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will be very brief. I would join in what has been said, at least around this hall, in that I hope that these are bipartisan, I hope that they are fair. I note in the witness list that the General Accounting Office comes on panel number 6, which probably will take place at about 2:30 or 3:00, and they would be the only ones who would be trying to look at this in perspective. Some of us have been Governors. Senator Graham has been a Governor, Senator Bryan has been a Governor, I have been a Governor. It is very interesting, when you get to the problem of bureaucracies, even at the State level, and the behavior within. As Senator Nickles has said, and others, most people--and Senator Conrad, I am told, said that before I came in, and I know Senator Bryan said it--are trying to do the right thing in the most unpopular job in the history of the world, I think, being an IRS agent. Unfortunately, not all Americans do pay the taxes which they owe and which is part of the cost of a democracy, to have your shores protected, your homes relatively safer. The only way that can be achieved is to work through something called enforcement, and enforcement I think is what we are going to see has some flaws in it, because there are always cases where people go out and they do things the wrong way. Those people should be terminated and those people should be shown in these hearings to be what we mean when we say we are trying to straighten out the system. I think it is also interesting that, over the last 5 years, there have been 3,200 cases of assaults or threats on IRS agents, and those folks are humans, too, the good ones, and then whoever the bad ones are, they have the right to do their jobs with some sense of security, except if they do them wrongly, in which case they should be fired. I know that Secretary Rubin has done a whole series of things to try and correct this situation, and criticism of the IRS has an effect on our ability to enforce our tax laws, as has been noted by even President Reagan's IRS director. The IRS always has been an agency to criticize. So I hope we are going to get the whole picture. I have in my book letters from a variety of Senate and House leaders who have turned the issue, it seems to me, into a fundraising issue. Each of the letters that they send out say some of the things that have been said here this morning, or will be said here this morning. Then they said, by the way, please send in $25, $50, or $100 to whichever national committee or to whichever Senate campaign committee is trying to raise money by IRS bashing. I find that distressing. In other words, is this a real issue that we are trying to do something about or is this an issue that we are trying to make political capital off it? If it is the latter, I find that distinctly unuseful. If it is the former, I find it thoroughly worthwhile. The two large volumes of the Tax Code and the regulations that Senator Nickles had in front of him are, in fact, caused by us. We are the ones in the Congress who caused those to appear. It would be in that spirit then that what we are talking about here is not just the abuses, which is important and necessary for us to hear, but also, how can we fix it. That is the kind of thing which tends to engage my attention, and I am confident it would be the same with my colleagues. I thank the Chairman. The Chairman. Let me say once again that the purpose of the investigation and these hearings is not a partisan one. The purpose is good government, not partisan purposes. Our focus is on whether the average taxpayer is being dealt with fairly by the IRS and the internal operation of the IRS, irrespective of what party may be in control of the Executive Branch. A number of our cases go back 17 years, so it covers several different administrations. This is an internal examination, as I say. Let me set the record straight. Any fund-raising efforts are in no way connected with this investigation that we commenced some 8 months ago. I think we are now to the point where we can turn to the first panel. The members of these associations, which I call the ``view from the trenches,'' represent the public in all types of tax matters, as well as disputes with the IRS. In the case of enrolled agents, these are men and women who are licensed to represent taxpayers before the IRS, with many of their members being formerly with the IRS. The panelists are Mr. Joe Lane, who represents the National Association of Enrolled Agents, representing the New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants; we have Mr. Robert L. Goldstein, chairman, and James A. Woehlke, Director of Tax Policy--if they would come forward. Now, it is our practice in these oversight hearings to swear the witnesses, so I would ask each of you to stand and raise your right hand. [Whereupon, the three witnesses were duly sworn.] The Chairman. Do you so swear, Mr. Lane? Mr. Lane. I do. The Chairman. Mr. Goldstein? Mr. Goldstein. I do. The Chairman. Mr. Woehlke? Mr. Woehlke. I do. The Chairman. Please be seated. Senator Moynihan. You realize you are in a lot of trouble now. Mr. Woehlke. Yes, indeed. The Chairman. We will start with Mr. Lane. I would ask that your testimony be limited to 10 minutes in each case, but your full statement, of course, will be included as if read. Mr. Lane? STATEMENT OF JOSEPH F. LANE, ENROLLED AGENT, CHAIRMAN, NATIONAL GOVERNMENT RELATIONS COMMITTEE, THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF ENROLLED AGENTS, GAITHERSBURG, MD Mr. Lane. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Moynihan. It is a pleasure to be invited to appear before the Senate Finance Committee today to discuss these matters. We understand the focus of the hearings is to look into IRS practices and procedures. Enrolled agents are uniquely positioned to provide some valuable insight to you, since our members deal with thousands of IRS employees every day in representing taxpayers. I was heartened to hear the opening comments about the bipartisan nature of these hearings. There has been a tremendous amount of media hype in connection with this hearing, and we were a little bit concerned about it ourselves. We spoke to both the Majority side and the Minority side, and were assured by both parties that the intention of these hearings was to be a balanced approach to looking at the IRS, with the attempt to arrive at some constructive suggestions for change that would improve the tax administration system. Mr. Rockefeller, I would be happy to assure you, we are here strictly to offer unbiased viewpoints. I think GAO has a view, but I think the rest of us also have viewpoints that are on an even keel. I think probably the best way to demonstrate the bipartisan nature of this Commission would be to recommend out of this committee the Kerrey-Grassley bill. That was a year-long effort in the National Commission on Restructuring to arrive at informed viewpoints on how best to change the tax administration system this country has and to assure that we have taxpayer rights protected and we have an organization that is responsive to taxpayer input, and at the same time creates an effective work force that is able to collect the taxes this country needs to survive on. So the best way to ensure that you have bipartisanship, I think, is to enact that legislation, and we would urge that that be done. We would like to start today by talking about some of the things IRS is doing right. I think the Service should be commended for the fact that it has embraced the majority of these recommendations that the Commission has given them, and they have announced that they intend to enact administratively whatever they are capable of doing from the commission. I think that that probably has not been an easy pill to swallow for the IRS, but they have stepped up to the plate and done it. I think that is indicative of an agency that is willing to accept constructive criticism and change. We also salute the selection of Bob Barr, the new Assistant Commissioner for Electronic Tax Administration. He is an outsider from the industry. He served previously as the vice president of the Intuit Software Company, and I think that the IRS is responding by going out and trying to recruit expertise they do not have in-house to market electronic filing, and that is a good development and I hope to see more of that continue. We also applaud some of the initiatives the local field components of the IRS are doing. They are trying to bring in more practitioner input, and we praise those districts that are involved in that area. We also think the IRS national office is making a concerted effort to have better communications with the practitioner community, and that always improves relationships when problems can be discussed in an open manner and flushed out. One of the biggest concerns we have today about the IRS is the status of employee morale in the Service. Our voluntary compliance system depends on both sides of the table being staffed by competent people. On the practitioner's side, we have a procedure for making sure our people are up to snuff and are competent and able to handle things, and we train them. One of the concerns we have on the IRS side is this constant din of criticism and public attention and media barrages that we see that has the effect of making morale in that organization decline. So we are concerned about that morale and we would like to see some additional focus on GAO looking into what they could do to instill some additional feelings of worth among some of these people in the Service, because if you have unhappy tax administrators you inevitably have unhappy taxpayers, because they have to deal with these people on a regular basis. That human element that Senator Gramm talked about is an extremely important element in any law enforcement capacity. We have some specific issues that we would like to address with the committee today in the area of taxpayer rights, and particularly in procedures with collection and exam. Then we would like to go on and offer some additional suggestions for your consideration. One, we believe the American Bar Association has drafted some legislation they will be submitting which bars the IRS from using statistically-generated average expenses in making collection case determinations. We support that legislation and we would like to see the Service consider the unique facts and circumstances of every taxpayer's case on a case-by-case basis. We believe that the use of these expense statistics has increased the number of bankruptcies substantially in the last year. We had a 25-percent increase in bankruptcies in 1996, during a period of economic improvement throughout the country. We think that a big component of that bankruptcy increase had to do with the collection division in October of 1995 implementing this procedure of using Bureau of Labor Statistics standard expenses allowances instead of allowing taxpayer to take the expenses they are actually incurring when they are making collection determinations. So we would like to see that investigated and we would like to see Congress act on that. The other problem we always have is the perennial one of inconsistent enforcement policies around the Nation. We have 33 IRS districts and we frequently run into issues where the national office promulgates a policy or procedure, then we see deviation from the procedures. We need to see more attention paid to that, and that is particularly in the collection area. The other issue we have problems with is the new procedure recently where the IRS has started to ask taxpayers for statute extension requests on collection cases, even though there might be nine and a half years of the 10 years left on the statute. That is an inappropriate use of the statute extension provisions. We think that the Congress ought to take a look at whether they ought to have a right to have a statute extension at all in collection. Just in 1990, you extended their statutory period of collection from 6 years to 10, and now we have a situation where we have a taxpayer, by example in the testimony we gave you today, someone goes out and files a tax return, owes the money, and calls the IRS, tries to set up a payment agreement. If the payment agreement that they could afford to pay each month is insufficient to full-pay the tax within the 10-year period, the IRS is asking for a 5-year extension today. We do not think Congress ever intended the IRS to go into the mortgage business or have a lifelong relationship with these people. Ten years ought to be sufficient. We do not think we want to see 15- and 20-year installment agreements with the IRS, and we urge Congress to take a look at that whole area. The collection appeals process we think ought to be beefed up and allowed to be a true appellate review of the judgment and conduct of the revenue officers involved. Right now, it is strictly a procedural review and it does not have much of an impact. I think the lack of use by practitioners and taxpayers alike indicate that they view that as really not a legitimate forum. In exam, we have the current exam program letter that evaluates districts based on yield per hour. I think one of the things you are going to focus on in this hearing is the inappropriate use of enforcement statistics. If you look at how much money per hour is generated by revenue agents, then the first casualty you have in an environment with a quota system, like a traffic cop, is taxpayer rights. You should not have an environment where you evaluate people based on how much money you rake in per hour. We think that ought to be addressed by the Congress. The other issue we are concerned about is the inappropriate use of the financial status audits, or the economic reality audits. We had a lot of publicity about this last year, a lot of hearings about it. The IRS issued a national directive saying they would only use this approach when there was an indication somehow in the case file that there was unreported income. We still see and get complaints from members and taxpayers alike that this procedure is being implemented when it is inappropriate. I think one of the suggestions we would like to see to head this off is that the IRS ought to be required, whenever they send an audit notice to a taxpayer, to include with that audit notice all of the IRP data, the Information Returns Program data, that the IRS has on that taxpayer in the file. The reason for that, is it avoids the ``gotcha'' game in the audit process. If taxpayer and practitioners alike, in preparation for going in for the audit, know that the IRS has been reported some income such as a dividend or miscellaneous compensation that was paid but it is not reflected on a tax return, they can prepare to argue either it is correct and was inadvertently omitted, or it was an erroneous filing to begin with. That is one of the issues we always run into as a justification for using this economic reality approach. Another area we think the committee ought to look at in the hearings you are doing, is the market segment specialization program. This program is probably the best thing IRS has done in the last 25 years in identifying pockets of non-compliance in specific industries and focusing their efforts, going out and getting other State agencies and other Federal agencies together, bringing all the people to the table that are affected by it, and doing something about it. Probably the best success story you can look at is out in the Central California district in Fresno, where they have focused on farm labor contractors. They have just accomplished a tremendous result as a result of the implementation of this approach, and I would suggest you hold a field hearing out there, if you have the time. I extend an invitation to come out to California. Everybody in Washington likes to get an invite to come out to the coast, I know. Come out and see what they are doing out there. They are doing some terrific stuff and they ought to be commended for that. With respect to exam quality review, one of the concerns we have about employee morale and the lack of IRS's ability to recruit quality people, is the quality of the work that is done at the initial stage in the audit process is declining. One of the things that is interesting to us and I think is something else you ought to look at, is the Pacific Northwest district has just announced a test study which they are going to implement using a district conference staff. That is a positive development. We would like to see, additionally, the committee consider protecting taxpayers' rights of confidentiality by enacting legislation that gives the taxpayer the right to protect from IRS summons the counsel and advice they have gotten from their tax advisers. We would like to see all commercial tax return preparers registered. We have a ludicrous situation in this country today where the tax preparers that have made the most commitment to their profession, the enrolled agents, the attorneys and the CPAs, are the most regulated, and the ones that have no commitment to a professional organization, have not agreed to a code of professional conduct, have no code of ethics to adhere to, and could open up a card-table shop on January 1, and disappear on the 16th of April, are completely unregulated. I think the most basic taxpayer right in this country ought to be that if you pay for advice on taxes to make sure you comply with the law, you ought to be confident you are dealing with a competent person. Today, we regulate barbers more than we regulate commercial return preparers, and you can recover from a bad haircut in 3 weeks. The other thing we have got to do is provide full credit for Social Security and self employment taxes that are paid in on delinquent tax returns. Taxpayers are not getting full credit for their Social Security, even though the IRS is collecting the taxes. That ought to be reversed. The other thing we would like to see the committee do is decide that, as a general principle of tax administration, you will never have a situation where the penalties are allowed to exceed 100 percent of the tax due for a particular tax period. We would also like to see tax penalties not used for revenue raising. Senator Nickles gave an excellent demonstration before with the Bible and the Code. That is because the good Lord, in his wisdom, inspired four evangelists to write the Bible and not 535 members of Congress. We would have the same situation if we had 535 evangelists, I am sure. We would have a 5 million word Bible, and it would be just as difficult to figure out. One of the things you have to review is the whole penalty structure in the Code. There are too many penalties for too many infractions and you cannot expect anybody to understand them. The other thing we would like to see changed, is there were some recent changes in some court cases that developed where we saw elderly people make an estimated payment of $7,000 when it should have been $700. The person had Alzheimer's. The court reviewed the case and said, we would like to be able to give this person a refund, but the daughter did not discover this until three or 4 years later. Therefore, the statute barred them from getting a refund. That law should be changed. There should be reasonable cause that allows a refund beyond the 3-year period. The other thing we did in our testimony before the Commission last year was to offer a suggestion that perhaps one of the ways of approaching the problems we are dealing with in tax administration was to divide the IRS into two separate agencies, one for taxpayer service, and the other for tax law enforcement. The Commission did not choose to follow that recommendation, but we would suggest to you that it might be an appropriate thing to discuss with the Commissioner-designate during the confirmation hearings to see if they could accomplish virtually the same thing within the umbrella of the organization, to set aside and provide a network and an organization within the IRS to provide for employment and promotion opportunities for people to move up in the organization, when they have a customer service attitude. The IRS says 85 percent of taxpayers are in compliance. Eighty-five percent of their efforts ought to go towards taking care of those people in terms of focusing on making sure if someone calls in and wants a question answered, it gets answered in a courteous manner and they get the information they need as expeditiously as possible. One of the problems you deal with in law enforcement is, the same personality that makes a good cop makes a lousy waiter, and vice versa. So you need to have more emphasis on customer service in that organization and a little less on enforcement. We have outlined the specifics in the example. Senator Gramm made reference to the INS having the same problem. Thank you. The Chairman. Your time has expired and we must move on. [The prepared statement of Mr. Lane appears in the appendix.] The Chairman. Mr. Goldstein? Mr. Goldstein. I will let Mr. Woehlke start. The Chairman. I would point out it will be 10 minutes for the two of you, so I would ask that you keep within that time limit. Senator Moynihan. New Yorkers are notoriously fast talkers. Mr. Woehlke. We can probably accommodate that, Senator, yes. The Chairman. Please proceed. STATEMENT OF JAMES A. WOEHLKE, DIRECTOR, TAX POLICY, NEW YORK SOCIETY OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS, NEW YORK, NY Mr. Woehlke. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Senator Moynihan, members of the committee. I am James Woehlke, CPA, director of tax policy for the New York State Society of CPAs, and I am here with Robert Goldstein today, the chairperson of our Relations with the IRS Committee. Our society is privileged to testify before you today about our day-to-day work with personnel at the IRS. But before we begin we must say that we have tremendous respect for the IRS in its gargantuan task of administering our Nation's tax system. We are supportive of the mission of the IRS and are not among those, unrealistically, we believe, calling for abolition. Also, some of the media reports about this week's hearings indicated your witnesses would portray an IRS run amok. We are unable to corroborate that particular message. Quite frankly, the IRS has over 100,000 decent, dedicated employees who carry out their responsibilities without guile and to the best of their ability. It is both unfair and inaccurate to portray the entire agency as running amok. This is not to say, however, that the IRS has no internal problems and challenges to face. Recent accounts for the $4 billion tax system modernization boondoggle and the IRS's complete inability to understand the degree of intrusiveness inherent in its financial status approach to auditing indicate that there is a disconnect between the inside and outside IRS views of what its appropriate function is. Our testimony before the National Commission to Restructure the IRS distilled a number of what we called root causes at the heart of the IRS's problems. Mr. Goldstein will touch on several of those today because they are helpful to understanding the problems and challenges practitioners face in their day-to-day interactions with the IRS. The root causes we will be touching on are structural dysfunction, the IRS's self-image, and the IRS's siege mentality. We went into much greater detail regarding these and other root causes in our testimony before the National Commission. Time today, of course, will not permit that to be related in detail, and we therefore respectfully request that you admit that testimony, along with today's testimony, into the hearing's official record. [The information appears in the appendix.] Mr. Woehlke. Let me now turn the microphone over to Mr. Goldstein. The Chairman. Mr. Goldstein. STATEMENT OF ROBERT L. GOLDSTEIN, CHAIRMAN, RELATIONS WITH IRS COMMITTEE, NEW YORK SOCIETY OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS, NEW YORK, NY Mr. Goldstein. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Senator Moynihan, and members of the committee. I am privileged to testify before you today. In my practice I deal with the men and women of the IRS on almost a daily basis. In my experience and that of those of the colleagues I represent, we have found that the vast majority of IRS employees are dedicated public servants who try to do the best job they have with the tools available to them. In our region we have found the executives and staff of the service to be open to liaison meetings and, within limits, responsive to taxpayer and practitioner concerns. These liaison meetings and joint IRS practitioner forums have allowed the practitioner and service personnel to share their concerns, understand the problems of the other, and try to work through these problems before they reach the point of confrontation. There are, however, problems which need to be addressed. That is why we are here today. I dare say that the majority of IRS personnel would also agree that these issues need to be addressed. The decentralized management structure of the IRS has made coordination of some important functions, including employee training, tax administration, and education difficult to achieve. We believe one case illustrates the gap between national level policy-setters and regional management. Regionally produced IRS pronouncements, including market segmentation specialization program papers and market segment understandings have been issued with strident commentary regarding worker classification, while at the same time new training methods and legislation on a national level are implemented expressing conciliatory and taxpayer friendly approaches to the worker classification issue. Regarding the IRS's self-image, we noted that a number of IRS employees testifying before the National Commission referred to the IRS as one of law enforcement. We cannot disagree more with this perception. We recognize that there is an important element of law enforcement in the role of the Service. But to view that as its primary function creates a level of insularity and heavy- handedness which often makes it impossible to achieve its core customer service objectives. The mere existence of the Problems Resolution Program illustrates this point. The primary role of the taxpayer advocate is to resolve taxpayer issues which have floundered in the normal process.
