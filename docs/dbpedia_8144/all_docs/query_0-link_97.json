One last look at Christmas Now through - Jan. 8 - The annual Filley Festival of Trees, Wreaths and Decorations is still open by free admission at the Vernon Filley Art Museum, 421 S.\n\nPRMC Included in Kansas Newborn Screening’s “Best of the Best” Facility Recognitions\n\nThe Family Birth Suites of Pratt Regional Medical Center, has been named one of Kansas’ “Best of the Best in Point-of- Care Newborn Screening” in 2020. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE), in partnership with the Kansas Hospital Association and the Kansas Midwives Alliance, has created a recognition program for hospitals, facilities and midwives who\n\nLeaving Christmas by a different path\n\n“THEN, AFTER GOD warned them in a dream not to report back to Herod, the Wise Men returned to their own country on a different path.” Matthew 2:12 Matthew’s account of the appearance of the wise men, or Magi, covers a mere 12 verses - a blip on the radar screen of the narrative - yet there is so much truth to be mined that it would be impossible for this essay to plumg. Let’s at least look at the closing words of the text above, “they returned to their own country on a different path.” For years, the Magi were painstakingly trained in their art - how to read the stars and relate them to the Spirit-inspired predictions of the coming of Christ.\n\nTHE TIMES THAT WE LIVE IN\n\nSURPRISE, I AM BACK. I had to take some time off to do a project here where we live. I really missed writing the columns. I never imagined doing something like this. Last Feb. I was wanting to put an ad in the Pratt Tribune when Jennifer the Editor asked if I would be interested in writing a regular column. I sure was lucky to have a good editor for my columns, even though one time I did not agree with her. I sure want to thank her for doing what she does.\n\nGood trouble: Opinions are not always the ultimate truth\n\nTHANKS FOR JOINING ME again as we take a deeper look into Good Trouble: Seek out the truth and not talking points. In my last article we walked alongside Laura Haviland, our Underground Railroad heroine from the 19th century and for whom the town of Haviland, Kansas was named. Laura had travelled undercover to Arkansas as a seamstress to get a special message to Ann, a slave woman. In the process Laura was almost torn limb by limb by vicious blood hounds trained to chase and kill slaves trying to escape. She also witnessed brutal beatings of young childhood slaves, who at the mercy of their grandmother was simply too sick to awaken them for their morning chores. The worst part of being undercover was she could not reveal the true purpose of her trip. Finally on her boat trip home, she free to come to the rescue of a sweet, grieving slave couple who were being sold down the river from their children. Often the opposite was the case for slaves. It was the children who were generally separated from their parents and sold down the river. In this case it was elderly parents sold away, and Laura was no longer in the difficult role of being an indifferent observer, so she listened intently to their plight and prayed with them. She also promised to continue to pray for them.\n\nMy way or God’s way?\n\nRECENTLY our family was visiting our hometown and, in trying to get from one location to another in Kansas City, we found ourselves in the middle of road construction. A sign appeared in the middle of the road stating, “NO THROUGH TRAFFIC.” Jeff turns to me and says, “Can we get through here?” and my immediate response was “Sure we can! We just have to cut through this subdivision,” as I pointed to the street to my right.\n\nLazy J Longhorns bring a special spotlight to Kansas cattle with record-setting horns\n\nA CREW FROM the Guinness Book of World Records has recorded a video of a new world record holder. And where do you suppose this world record holder is found? Would you believe, in rural, Northeastern Kansas?\n\nKansas Department of Agriculture offers Farmers’ Market and Direct-to-Consumer virtual workshop series\n\nMANHATTAN, Kansas — The Kansas Department of Agriculture and K-State Research and Extension will offer virtual workshops January 31–February 4, 2022, to assist farmers’ market vendors and managers, and also for those wanting to sell food products directly to consumers. The workshop series includes four online Lunch and Learn sessions, followed by a half-day virtual workshop. Some K-State Research and Extension offices will be offering in-person watch parties for the February 4 half-day workshop.\n\nResources for Kansans Affected by Severe Weather\n\nLAST THURSDAY, I met with Shawna Nells, Eric Ward, Darci Paull and Jason Hartman at the Kansas Forest Service who work to protect Kansans and Kansas landowners through protection and management of forests, woodlands and windbreaks. They showed me satellite images from the National Interagency Fire Center as well as data from National Fireguard Detections, a program that monitors heat rather than fire perimeter and helps fill in any informational gaps from the satellite images. From the images and data, I was able to learn more about the extent of the damage from the December 15 fires as farmers, ranchers and communities begin to rebuild. Recovery takes time, and I am ready to assist."
