Mark started as a repairman in 1980 and is one of only a handful of Americans trained at the F. Lorée factory in France! He brought to the business an understanding and creativity not formerly found in the field. Mark quickly brought to fruition some of the many ideas he had developed in his years of talking and listening to musicians’ complaints involving instruments and accessories. Among the innovative improvements are the CA and the Sierra line of staples. The CAs are the first line of staples to be consistent, seamless and chamfered. Mark’s English Horn and Oboe d’amore bocals are also noteworthy. Each one is constructed with a “tenon cork” at the tip, insuring greater airtightness and security than any other bocal on the market. Extremely popular among reedmakers throughout the world are the precision MCW hollow ground knives. On a whimsical note, Mark’s introduction of colorful swabs has brightened the otherwise black or brown world of double reed accessories. In 1990, the Sierra oboe was introduced as a natural extension of Mark’s skills and interest. Debuting in 1991, the MCW Oboe represents Mark’s endeavor to provide an oboe of professional quality at an affordable price. Designed for the intermediate to advanced level student, the MCW oboe truly represents handcrafted excellence for the serious student. Mark’s first presentation at the Northwest Oboe Seminar was in 2000 with his topic, Secrets of Oboe Making! MCW has been a Seminar sponsor since 1995.\n\nRead about our 16th Annual Seminar in the International Double Reed Journal!\n\n​\n\nhttp://www.idrs.org/publications/controlled/DR/DR33.2/DR33_2.pdf\n\n​\n\nThe 16th Annual Northwest Oboe Seminar\n\nSaturday, August 15, 2009\n\nAll Saints’ Episcopal Church, Portland\n\nFocus on Bach with guest Allan Vogel\n\nSponsored by: Mark Chudnow Woodwinds www.mcwoboe.com\n\nRDG Woodwinds www.rdgwoodwinds.com\n\nJones Double Reed Products www.jonesdoublereed.com\n\nAlso sponsored in part by JB Linear Music\n\nALLAN VOGEL\n\n​\n\nHailed as “an aristocrat of his instrument” (Los Angeles Times) and “undoubtedly one of a few world masters” (San Diego Union), Allan Vogel is one of America’s leading wind soloists and chamber musicians.

His recorded repertoire includes Bach, Baksa, Bax, Bliss, Britten, Debussy, Hindemith, Leclair, Lefebre, Mozart, Poulenc, Rameau, Saint-Saens, as well as concerti of Strauss, Telemann, Vaughan Williams and Wolf-Ferrari. His recording of All Bach was praised in The Gramophone as a “memorable recital that boasts a deeply expressive soloist”.\n\nThe 12th Annual Northwest Oboe Seminar\n\nSaturday, August 20, 2005\n\nAll Saints’ Episcopal Church, Portland\n\n​\n\nYour Relationship With Your Oboe with returning guest Fred Korman\n\n​\n\nSponsored by: Mark Chudnow Woodwinds www.mcwoboe.com\n\nJones Double Reed Products www.jonesdoublereed.com\n\nFred Korman incorporates his unique background and varied talents, along with his passion for people and performance, in his achievements as a nationally acclaimed leader of workshops on the “Psychology of Performance”; as a renowned oboist; and in his private counseling practice.\n\n​\n\nA native of Brooklyn, New York, Mr. Korman maintains a private counseling practice in Portland where he sees adults in individual counseling. In addition, Mr. Korman presents master classes and workshops at major universities and music festivals around the United States for performers of all levels and mediums focusing on the psychology of performance. The uniqueness of his combined expertise allows him to provide a richness of experience both as a therapist and a musician.\n\n​\n\nMr. Korman’s training includes undergraduate work in psychology. He is currently a member of the Portland Gestalt Institute led by Dr. Jeffrey Sher, PhD, and Carol Swanson, LCSW. Among his most recent engagements are workshops at the University of Washington, University of Nevada at Las Vegas, and the International Gestalt Therapy Seminar in Siena, Italy.\n\n​\n\nThe Principal Oboist with the Oregon Symphony since 1978, Mr. Korman is a frequent soloist in the Northwest. He has received critical praise for his “flawless playing”, “tour-de-force” performances and “lyric flair”. His performances of George Rochberg’s Oboe Concerto with the Oregon Symphony drew robust approval from music critics who said: “Korman played passionately . . . his oboe rang clear and true” (The Columbian) and “He cleanly etched Rochberg’s mournful and erratic themes . . . against the score’s constantly shifting patterns” (The Oregonian). His playing in the critically acclaimed Oregon Symphony recording of Strauss’ Don Juanwas praised by the CD Review.\n\n​\n\nBefore beginning his tenure with the Oregon Symphony, Mr. Korman held positions with the New Orleans and Hartford Symphony Orchestras. In addition to his recordings with the Oregon Symphony, Mr. Korman has recorded both classical and jazz on labels including Delos, Opus One, Koch, and a premier recording of the Wind Quartet by Gieseking on the Centaur label. He has participated as Principal Oboist in music festivals including Tanglewood, Chamber Music Northwest, Peter Britt, Centrum, Shenandoah Valley, Festival of the Amalfi Coast (Italy) and the Saint Barthelemey Music Festival (French West Indies).\n\n​\n\nAside from performing, Mr. Korman enjoys a successful teaching career, having held positions at the Hartt College of Music, Loyola University, University of New Orleans, Lewis and Clark College and Portland State University. He is currently on the faculty of Oregon State University in Corvallis. He has twice been a guest artist in the Northwest Oboe Seminar.\n\nThe Northwest Oboe Seminar presents the annual Mack in March Series – two Master Classes with Mr. John Mack!\n\nWednesday, March 29 & Thursday, March 30, 2006\n\n6:30 – 9:30 pm\n\nAll Saints’ Episcopal Church, Portland\n\n​\n\nJohn Mack was appointed to the principal oboe chair at the Cleveland Orchestra by George Szell in 1965; during his tenure, which lasted until 2001, he also played under music directors Lorin Maazel, Christoph von Dohnányi and, most recently, Franz Welser-Möst. Since 2001, Mack served as a member of the Cleveland Orchestra board of directors.\n\n​\n\nMack was born in Somerville, New Jersey, where he received his early musical training, studying with Bruno Labate and Marcel Tabuteau in high school. Friends urged him to study science or physics, but he was determined to continue with music, and went on to train at the Juilliard School with Harold Gomberg and with Tabuteau at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia.\n\nHis professional orchestral career began in the Sadler’s Wells Ballet Orchestra in 1951 and was followed by eleven seasons (from 1952-63) as first oboist with the New Orleans Symphony. He then had a brief stint with the National Symphony in Washington, D.C. Mack was also a founding member of the Plymouth Trio and a regular chamber music performer.\n\n​\n\nA renowned teacher, Mack was chairman of the woodwind division at the Cleveland Institute of Music since 1965. Many of his former students hold positions with major orchestras, including the Boston Symphony, Cleveland Orchestra and Metropolitan Opera Orchestra. He was also a faculty member of the Kent/Blossom Music program since its founding in 1968, and since 1976, he taught and performed at the John Mack Oboe Camp in North Carolina.\n\n​\n\nDavid Zauder, a retired member of the orchestra’s trumpet section, told the Cleveland Plain Dealer, “John Mack was an icon of the Cleveland Orchestra. He touched thousands of lives with his special way of helping. He made everybody better.”\n\nThe 11th Annual Northwest Oboe Seminar\n\nSaturday, August 21, 2004\n\nAll Saints’ Episcopal Church, Portland\n\n​\n\nWhat Every Oboist Needs to Know about the Body with guest Barbara Conable\n\n​\n\nSponsored by: Mark Chudnow Woodwinds www.mcwoboe.com\n\nJones Double Reed Products www.jonesdoublereed.com\n\nBarbara Conable, Founder, Andover Educators\n\nbarbarabodymaporg barbarabodymaporg\n\nDuring her twenty-two years as an Alexander Technique teacher Barbara Conable helped to save hundreds of musical careers and to enhance hundreds more. She experienced frustration, however, because she knew that thousands more musicians were losing careers and capacity. To enhance her effectiveness, she wrote the book What Every Musician Needs to Know about the Body and developed a Body Mapping course by the same name which is now taught by Andover Educators around the world. The goal of Andover Educators is to put music education on a secure somatic (anatomical) foundation for all time.\n\n​\n\nBarbara Conable is the author of How to Learn the Alexander Technique: A Manual for Students, What Every Musician Needs to Know about the Body, available from Andover Press and Amazon.com and The Structures and Movement of Breathing available from giamusic.com.\n\n​\n\nNow retired from teaching, Barbara Conable continues to develop the theory and practice of Body Mapping.\n\nDan Stolper is a member of the Interlochen Arts Camp faculty.

Paull discovered the world of Music at the hands of an enlightened and very patient piano teacher as a young child. The discovery of the oboe d’amore, whilst an oboe student at the Royal College of Music (London), changed both her life and that of this almost forgotten, beautiful instrument to which she subsequently dedicated her own. She remains the only soloist in the world ever to have devoted a career exclusively to its cause.\n\nAlthough having performed with many of the leading orchestras in England and Europe as an oboe and cor anglais player as well as being an oboe d’amore specialist (BBC Symphony and Philharmonic, English Chamber Orchestra, Rotterdam Philharmonic etc), the orchestral repertoire was neither where her heart beat the fastest, nor in which the instrument of her predilection was anything other than an occasional guest.\n\n​\n\nMusic in all its guises as well as performance itself enabled her to explore her passion much more intensely. This extended from orchestral concerts and solo recitals to publishing new repertoire (for all members of the oboe family of instruments, especially the rarest of its members), music therapy and education, the organisation of concerts and festivals and working in artist and orchestral management. The fascination with the Comparative Arts’ perspective of her subject led Jennifer Paull to writing.\n\n​\n\n“The lens through which I view my subject is one of a musician who delights in the juxtaposition and oneness of all of the Arts: their comparison to my own and the very lack of separation and division between.”\n\n​\n\nJennifer Paull’s first book, Cathy Berberian and Music’s Musings was published in 2007 by Amoris Imprint. Details can be found on the Books page of this site – www.amoris.com\n\n​\n\nShe has two sons and two daughters and lives in Switzerland near the French border in a charming, wine-growing village not far from Montreux. Fascinated by travel, history, and synaesthesia (her ‘secret weapon’), she freely admits to an advanced addiction to The Arts in all their guises and intellectual sleuthing at its most intense. Since retiring from her active playing career, Jennifer is in the process of donating her lifetime of collected repertoire for the rare oboes to the Werner Icking Music Archive (WIMA) so that it is freely available to players everywhere. http://icking-music-archive.org/index.php\n\nThe Northwest Oboe Seminar presents a Master Class with returning guest, oboist Stephen Caplan\n\n​\n\nFriday, May 24, 2001\n\nAll Saints’ Episcopal Church, Portland\n\nThe 7th Annual Northwest Oboe Seminar\n\nSaturday, August 19, 2000\n\nMarylhurst University, Oregon\n\nSecrets of Oboe Making with guest Mark Chudnow\n\nSponsored by: Mark Chudnow Woodwinds www.mcwoboe.com\n\nJones Double Reed Products www.jonesdoublereed.com\n\n​\n\nEstablished in 1984, Mark Chudnow Woodwinds has been a leading innovator in the design and development of double reed products since its inception. Mark started as a repairman in 1980 and is one of only a handful of Americans trained at the F. Lorée factory in France! He brought to the business an understanding and creativity not formerly found in the field. Mark quickly brought to fruition some of the many ideas he had developed in his years of talking and listening to musicians’ complaints involving instruments and accessories.\n\n​\n\nAmong the innovative improvements are the CA and the Sierra line of staples. The CAs are the first line of staples to be consistent, seamless and chamfered. Mark’s English Horn and Oboe d’amore bocals are also noteworthy. Each one is constructed with a “tenon cork” at the tip, insuring greater airtightness and security than any other bocal on the market. Extremely popular among reedmakers throughout the world are the precision MCW hollow ground knives. On a whimsical note, Mark’s introduction of colorful swabs has brightened the otherwise black or brown world of double reed accessories.\n\n​\n\nIn 1990, the Sierra oboe was introduced as a natural extension of Mark’s skills and interest. Debuting in 1991, the MCW Oboe represents Mark’s endeavor to provide an oboe of professional quality at an affordable price. Designed for the intermediate to advanced level student, the MCW oboe truly represents handcrafted excellence for the serious student.\n\nThe 6th Annual Northwest Oboe Seminar\n\nSaturday, August 21, 1999\n\nMarylhurst University, Oregon\n\nOrchestral Excerpts with guest Fred Korman\n\nSponsored by: Mark Chudnow Woodwinds www.mcwoboe.com\n\nJones Double Reed Products www.jonesdoublereed.com\n\nThe 5th Annual Northwest Oboe Seminar\n\nSaturday, August 15, 1998\n\nMarylhurst College, Oregon\n\n​\n\nThe Oboists Role Within the Wind Quintet, featuring the Con Grazia Wind Quintet of the OREGON CHAMBER PLAYERS\n\nSponsored by: Mark Chudnow Woodwinds www.mcwoboe.com\n\nJones Double Reed Products www.jonesdoublereed.com\n\nSponsored by: Mark Chudnow Woodwinds www.mcwoboe.com\n\nJones Double Reed Products www.jonesdoublereed.com\n\nThe 4th Annual Northwest Oboe Seminar\n\nSaturday, August 16, 1997\n\nMarylhurst College, Oregon\n\nContemporary Oboe Techniques with guest Stephen Caplan\n\n​\n\nSponsored by: Mark Chudnow Woodwinds www.mcwoboe.com\n\nJones Double Reed Products www.jonesdoublereed.com\n\nStephen Caplan, DMA\n\nCertified Andover Educator\n\nProfessor of Oboe, University of Nevada Las Vegas\n\n​\n\nwww.unlv.edu/programs/oboe/index.html\n\nStephen Caplan, DMA\n\nCertified Andover Educator\n\nProfessor of Oboe, University of Nevada Las Vegas\n\n​\n\nwww.unlv.edu/programs/oboe/index.html\n\nThe 3rd Annual Northwest Oboe Seminar\n\nSaturday, August 17, 1996\n\nMarylhurst College, Oregon\n\n​\n\nMock Auditions with guest Timoteus Racz\n\n​\n\nSponsored by: Mark Chudnow Woodwinds www.mcwoboe.com\n\nJones Double Reed Products www.jonesdoublereed.com\n\nThe 2nd Annual Northwest Oboe Seminar\n\nSatruday, August 19, 1995\n\nMarylhurst College, Oregon\n\n​\n\nOboe Quartets with the Amati String Quartet (later known as the OCP QUARTET)"
