        "text": "Paul was born on September 8, 1951, in England. He was the beloved partner of Christine Strang and a cherished father to his children, Mark Schinkel (Vanessa) and Erin Schinkel (Ian). Paul was the stepfather of Jennifer Strang, Matthew Strang (Rod), Natalie Strang (Kate), and Michael Strang (Brittany). He took pride in being a loving grandfather to Gabriel, Aylen, Katherine, and Madelaine.\n\nIn his younger years, Paul found great joy in pursuing his passions. An avid golfer and boater, he spent countless hours on the green and gliding across the water. These activities not only brought him immense pleasure but also allowed him to connect with friends who shared similar interests.\n\nAmong Paul's fondest memories were the winters he spent in Florida. Warm sunshine and sandy beaches provided the perfect backdrop for his relaxation and leisure. His love for Florida was unwavering, as it became a treasured escape from the colder months back home.\n\nAnother aspect of Paul's life that brought him tremendous happiness was traveling. Exploring new places and experiencing different cultures enriched his spirit and broadened his horizons. From breathtaking natural wonders to bustling city streets, he embraced each destination with curiosity and an open heart.\n\nPaul Anton Hendrik Schinkel passed away peacefully on January 7, 2024, at his residence. A private family service will be held at a later date.\n\nDuring this time of grief, let us take comfort in the legacy that Paul leaves behindâ€”a life filled with love for family and friends. May his soul find eternal peace, and may his journey continue in the great beyond."
