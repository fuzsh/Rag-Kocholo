        "text": "Today, 98 students, representing 30 North Carolina counties, will embark on a 10-week educational internship experience in North Carolina state government agencies. This year, the program features more than 80 projects ranging from clean energy to workforce development, offering students hands-on practical work experience in the career field of their choice.\n\n“These internships offer fantastic experience that may lead to a permanent position with the state,” said NC Department of Administration Secretary Pamela B. Cashwell. “In fact, we have several interns from the past few years that are now full-time state employees. I am excited about the remarkable talent these students will bring to our state government agencies this summer as they work to gain career enhancing experience in public service.”\n\nThe State of North Carolina Internship program will kick off with a student orientation featuring Secretary Cashwell and members of the Internship Council where they will learn about job expectations, enrichment opportunities and can ask questions of previous interns. Summer projects this year will include both in-person and hybrid work environments.\n\nFifteen state agencies* are offering internships in careers ranging from economic development to marine fisheries research, historic interpretation, instructional design, communications and public affairs, human resources, policy and advocacy, youth involvement outreach and animal husbandry among others. In addition to gaining practical work experience, students will also tour various facilities to learn about other government operations and state careers.\n\nCoordinated by the Department of Administration’s Council for Women and Youth Involvement, the State of North Carolina Internship Program offers college students an opportunity to connect lessons learned in the classroom to potential career choices across the state. Established in 1969, the Internship Program has provided state government work opportunities to North Carolina residents attending college, university, technical or community college.\n\nThe highly competitive internship process begins each fall when the application period opens. Applicants are interviewed, selected and matched with agencies in the spring. There were more than 3,100 applications for this year’s 98 positions. The process is overseen by the NC Internship Council.
