As I leave England and return (though temporarily) to my hometown, the eternal city of Rome, I reflect on the journey that took me so far away from it 9 years ago. When I was 16 years old, I made the overnight decision to leave my beloved home to study in the United States, which unlocked a potential in me that I didn’t know existed. I was a child facing a world that was much bigger than I had imagined. Fast forward a few years, I am now a qualified lawyer in England and I am also Brit-ish. Quite literally, as you can see from the picture…Unthinkable for me 10 years ago, when I could barely string a sentence together in English, and would have never put milk in a cup of tea and have it with a scone 🤷🏻♀️ It has been a journey of self-discovery and self-determination above anything else. Though I am a proud Italian woman, I am truly grateful for the wonderful opportunities that my adoptive country, the UK, has given me. I thank the colleagues and managers I worked with for helping me grow not only as a lawyer, but as a person. I thank DRS for trusting me when I had hardly any work experience and for giving me great opportunities to develop. I joined as a legal consultant fresh from uni and leave as a qualified solicitor and team lead. Thank you for supporting me in reaching my full potential. And now onto my next journey… I am absolutely delighted to join Burness Paull in September as a Banking & Funds Solicitor in Edinburgh! The welcome and support I received before I even joined has been truly heartwarming. Thank you to the partners and colleagues I already had the chance to speak to. I fell in love with Scotland and its people from the very first time I visited. I already feel at home! So… arrivederci Roma 🇮🇹, ta-ra Newcastle 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 and halò Auld Reekie 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿! #solicitor #newjob #adventure #england #italian #edinburgh #lawyer

I am so happy to have achieved a Distinction in my Master of Laws with LPC. I would have laughed if someone told me I was going to achieve this a few years ago. I barely spoke any English and never considered the idea of leaving my beautiful Italy. It was almost an overnight decision to turn my life around. And I continue to believe in my gut feelings, in what “feels right”. It makes me excited to get up and live my day knowing I have a purpose, and studying law gave me that purpose. Today, I am extremely grateful to feel this way in my new job! #lpc #newjob #law #results
