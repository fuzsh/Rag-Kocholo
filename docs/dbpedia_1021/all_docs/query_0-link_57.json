The first three missions, three boxes of 18 aircraft each, were to be over their targets and release ordinance between 0605 and 0624 hours, just before the Allied troops came ashore on Utah Beach. The forth mission, three boxes of 12 aircraft each, to a road junction near Caen, took off from Earls Colne Airfield at 1430 hours.\n\nAs you can see from the footage, landing craft are already ashore and the invasion is underway. Therefore, it stands to reason that if this footage is of the Caen RJ mission if it was shot on June 6, 1944 as the caption suggests. It appears that one of the aircraft in the footage has the radio call sign \"WT-A\" probably belonging to Ole 33 Gal, one of the aircraft assigned to the 323rd BG, 456th BS. So, at lest we know it's the the 323rd. The aircraft have invasion stripes, so it's clear the mission was not flown before D-Day. The traffic in the Channel and the lading craft of the beaches suggests it was flown on the afternoon of D-Day.\n\nUnfortunately, my loading list records for the Caen RJ mission only pertain to the first box of 12 led by Lt. Col. Robert O. Barker. WT-A does not seem to be on the list for Box I, although legibility is definitely an issue.\n\nThe Box Lead for one of the other two boxes, Maj. Stach, was shot down over the target. There does not appear to be any flak apparent in the footage. It should be there.\n\nThis looks like a busted mission. The Caen road junction was not where it had been briefed, and the crews had a hard time picking up the target. Box I, Fight 1 (4 aircraft) had poor results, hitting along a road near some houses. Box I, Flight 2 got a direct hit on a highway bridge (target of opportunity) that was the primary target for another BG. Box I, Flight 3 hit along streets and houses. The aircraft all went in between 2,000 and 3,000 feet, which looks about right. The bombs seem to impact as the mission reports suggest.\n\nThe terrain is fairly distinctive with notable topographic features. Hopefully, this will be an easy one to solve.\n\nThanks for taking a look,\n\nJan\n\nRE: 323rd Bombardment Group, June 6, 1944 Footage\n\nHi, Pat,\n\nThat may have been the road junction they were to target. I don't think that's where they dropped. It's hard for me to tell with the available resolution whether there are fields or fields that have been flooded in the background. They cross over a bridge at one point and appear to drop in an area along the Orne.\n\nI'm thinking they were not to far East of the junction you found and a little further inland. Definitely on the outskirts of Caen, if it's Caen, in an area with some houses along a road and fields. There is a big bed in the river not too far from a bridge as the make the break away.\n\nOne of the gunners that went on the mission to the Caen RJ described shooting into a troop carrier train as they flew down the line of the tracks on the bomb run on that mission. I did not see any train tracks in the footage, but the bridge in the background could be a RR bridge.\n\nOne flight got a hit on the approach to a RR bridge. The 9th AF report on the results of the mission seems consistent with where the bombs hit on this mission.\n\nI will study the area you've identified some more. It's definitely in the vicinity. There are a lot of roads in the area. This was the 323rd's first mission to a road junction. Until then, the targets had been airdromes, no balls sites, marshaling yards and road and highway bridges.\n\nI'll look for a map with rail road tracks noted to try and follow possible bomb run routes and ID the area that way.\n\nIf we confirm that the footage in of the Caen RJ target, there is a widely published photograph of what is probably the briefing for it. The photo was republished in the Time Life D-Day 70th Anniversary paperback book. After picking it up in the checkout line at the grocery store, I realized my dad is in the middle of the photograph with his navigation/bombardier's kit on his knee. I got an editorial license for the photograph, which heavily restricts it's use. It's owned by Getty Inages.\n\nJan\n\n[hr]\n\nTake a look at Etavaux.\n\nThere is a big bend, not bed, in the river. Sorry for the typo.\n\n[hr]\n\nThe Voire verte de Suisse Normandie is a RR line adjacent to a road that crosses the Orne River. It runs next to the bend at the point noted below. Take a look and see what you think.\n\nRE: 323rd Bombardment Group, June 6, 1944 Footage\n\nHi, Pat,\n\nAfter revising the mission lists for the 323rd and looking at videos that include footage of the Viaduc de Clecy mission, I doubt that mission was flown by the 323rd. Instead, it appears it must have been flown by the 386th Bombardment Group out of Boxted. The 386th had a yellow horizontal stripe on its tail that has been mistaken in black and white film as the 323rd Bombardment Group. If you are able to get a still of the tail or radio call numbers of one of the aircraft in that particular segment, we can put this to rest fairly quickly.\n\nThe footage appears to be a collage of about four separate missions. It looks like at least two were flown by the 323rd. I got a good still of WT-A Ole 33 Gal one one of the missions. I also got stills of VT-K on another segment if the footage, which was used in the Folligny MY mission footage as well.\n\nThe footage that includes the invasion armada looks like it was one of the morning D-Day mission (there are flashes coming from what looks like the Normandy cost. The aircraft are flying parallel to the coast, which is consistent with the three D-Day CB missions flown by the 323rd.\n\nThe forest mission footage shows a big flash. I believe that footage is of the 323rd, and I should be able to help identify that target.\n\nThere is quite a bit of footage that looks like several distinct missions on different dates spliced together indiscriminately.\n\nFor the Clecy Viaduc footage to be of the 323rd, it would have to either not be Clecy or it would be the Caen RJ mission. I very much doubt the later, and you make a good case for Clecy. I just don't think it was the 323rd.\n\nThe 323rd was one of the first two Marauder units, so it's much better known than the 386th.\n\nJan"
