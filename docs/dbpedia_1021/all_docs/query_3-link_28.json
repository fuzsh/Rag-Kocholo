        "text": "I was a S/Sgt. Flight Engineer-Gunner...48 missions in the waist, one in the tail, and my last one in the turret...50 missions...in the 554th Squadron/386th Bomb Group, flying my first combat mission on the Group's first mission, 30 July 1943...My aircraft was The Bad Penny and The Bad Penny 2nd.\n\nWhen I had 49 missions in--on 26 March 1944, I was advised that I was selected among 10 gunners from the 4 oldest B-26 Groups in England, to be sent back to the States to attend Gunnery Instructors School, and that I was thru flying combat missions--awaiting orders down from 9th AF HQ....as a fluke, I wound up on a what was originally scheduled \"local\" flight, to get my flying time in for April, before leaving. That \"local\" with a crew other than my regular crew was during the night, changed to a combat mission, and I had no choice but to go on it...since the Sq CO was in London on pass. I went, we got the shit shot out of us...I picked up a small piece of flak in the upper lip, hydraulic system shot out, had to crank the flaps down, no brakes, had to pull the air bottle and the locked wheels blew the tires...My orders were waiting me when we got back, and I left the next morning, came back on the Dutch liner Nieuw Amsterdam.\n\nI was not yet 19 when I returned to the States.. I wound up at Lake Charles Army Air Base, LA, where I met my future wife, an AirWac working in Base HQ.. We were married on 9 July 1947... Celebrated our 60th last July.\n\nWe were discharged in July 1945...I re-enlisted in August 1946...Flew on the Berlin Airlift as flight engineer...Received a direct commission as 2/Lt via Board Action....from enlisted to officer duty on 15 August 1950...aircraft maintenance officer...Was made a regular officer in 1957, and spent the last three years as an Atlas-F missile maintenance officer....retiring voluntarily in the grade of regular major, on 1 March 1965..at age 39... I spent seven years as Plant Manager of a 535-bed hospital in Knoxville.. and six years as the Grainger County Juvenile Court and Probation Officer....calling it Quits in 1982.... We live 25 miles ENE Knoxville at Rutledge. TN...\n\nI'm mentioned in a couple of 386th missions, Chester Klier's Mission #8 and Mission #25.\n\nTake Care,\n\nBillie B. Boyd Jr. I am looking for any kind of information concerning with the liberation (27th April 1945 ) in Italy of my native village Cavarzere. From August 1944 to end April 1945 was more than 260 Allied Forces bombardments by 12th and 15th Air Force 319th 485th and other BG. I would like to gather aerial photos and videos of B-25 and B-26 Marauder, Liberators aircrafts related to the bombing of Cavarzere RR & Road Bridges over Adige River. Cavarzere (map) is located 40km from Venice between Rivers Po and Adige, in the Po Valley. Also personal records, diaries, memories, pictures of Vets and their families would be appreciated. I am having an exhibition for this day of Liberation and would like to remember the special contribution of Allied Forces, in collaboration with the City Council of Cavarzere.\n\nI appreciated your time and attention to this request and thank you for your consideration.\n\nGiancarlo Tagliati"
