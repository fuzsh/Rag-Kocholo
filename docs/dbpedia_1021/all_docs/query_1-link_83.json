When I was working at LAX between the years 1966 to 1968 I worked in the 707 simulator with a former B-26 pilot by the name of Stan Clark. Stan was an AAL captain and 707 pilot instructor at the time. I used to get him to tell me war stories from time to time - but all I can remember after 37 years is that at one time or another he flew \"Mild and Bitter\". After I moved to DFW I no longer had contact with Stan, but If he is still around he probably could be contacted vis the AAL retired pilot group - The Gray Eagle Association ( I have no contact info for them). Harold Davey\n\nDate:\n\n12/31/2004\n\nTime:\n\n4:08 PM\n\nGreetings, My father William Henry Wishard III a 2nd Lt. who died on May 25, 1945. He was killed overseas and was a crew member on a B-26. The following information was taken from his Pilot and Crew Member Physical Record Card:\n\nArmy Serial No. XXXX451\n\nExaminations - Qualified for flying\n\nClass I\n\nDate 5/2/44\n\nSignature of Flight Surgeon- (unreadable)\n\nStation - (this was cut out)\n\nDo you have any record or information on my father or his group?\n\nThank you for any information you can give me. He was shipped overseas two weeks before I was born and now my 12 year old son and I am researching this together as a way to pass on the memory of my father.\n\nThank you in advance you assistance would be greatly appreciated.\n\nWilliam \"Bill\" Wishard\n\nDate:\n\n12/29/2004\n\nTime:\n\n7:38 AM\n\nJames D. Pascoe, Marauder Man\n\n394th B. Grp\n\n587th B. Sqd\n\nServed April 1943 to Nov. 1945\n\nAfter Armament School at Lowery and Flex Gunnery school near Fort Meyer, I was assigned to the 394 at Kellogg Field, and joined the Ted Kubala crew as tail gunner. After being shot down on April 21st 1944 I managed to evade capture till May 9th when I and two other American airmen, John Blangio of Boston and George Gannister of Birmingham Ala. were led into a trap in Lille and captured. As for the other members of the crew: Theodore E. Kubala, pilot: William G. Jones, copilot: and John A. Debell, nav/bombardier went down with the plane. Flight Engineer Sylvester W Schrieber, and radio man, George J Mahin were captured immediately.\n\nDate:\n\n12/27/2004\n\nTime:\n\n5:56 PM\n\nMarauder Man Kenneth A. Schell - From his Purple heart citation papers, he was in the 387th Bombardment Group (M), 556th bombardment Squadron (M). He is listed as an Aerial-Gunner and was under the command of Brigadier General Anderson, Richard C Saunders, Brig Gen, Chief of Staff, signed by Arthur W Egan., 1st Lt, Air Corps, Adjutant. His discharge lists him as an airplane mechanic, gunner 748. His battles and campaigns listed are Normandy; Rhineland. He was injured 12 August 1944, place unavailable. As an addition to 556th Bomb Sq (M), there are comments 123,131, &161 Hq IX BC44; GO's 23,&33/44, 6& 40/45, Hq 9th BD. Maybe someone who understands military language will have insight into the significance of these notations. I would like to find more information if possible. I have a photo of the plane and crew that flew it. The number on the plane is 1891. The crew listed is as follows: \"Wild Bill\" Moriarity, pilot; Jess Wilkes; Clarence E Bergand; Kenneth A. Schell, engineer; Doyle K. Grant, radio man; Charles F. Salas, gunner. This photo is dated Mar 23, 1944. I am guessing it was taken in the states as his date of departure to ETO was 15 Apr 44. Will any of this information be helpful in finding another crew member or relative of a crew member. I have been told they flew 87 missions and all six flew all missions and all returned. Thanks for your interest. I'm just the baby sister who heard stories and who now has a few of his memories. It soon will be five years since his death. I know it is a little late for me to be searching but I'm willing to give it a try. Margaret Rose (Margie) Schell Frazier.\n\nDate:\n\n12/24/2004\n\nTime:\n\n10:59 AM\n\nMy dad, Theodore V. Harwood, flew with the 323rd on their mission on Dec. 23rd. This is the letter he wrote sixty years ago today. Take care, Ted Harwood, II.\n\n\"12/24/44 (Christmas Eve): Dear folks, I received your swell gifts yesterday and last night we all played pops ring toss game, I opened the other presents tonight before chow. and all were very nice. I dont know how to thank you as it means so much to receive things from home. I have had no mail from home for seven days, but I know its just the mail tie up.\n\nI have 18 missions now and the last one was a little rough, in fact the roughest one we have had. I saw enough to make those old pictures, like Hells Angles look sick. But, the Germans took the worst of the beating.\n\nIt has been really cold here the last few days. All of the water pools are frozen over and the ground stays frozen all day. Our water system is no-operational now too, all frozen up. No snow as yet, but heavy frost every morning and the ground is all while until about 11:00 every morning.\n\nI would very much like to be home with you folks tonight, but know you will have a good time. It is 7:00 PM here and only 11:00 A.M. there. I suppose theres not to much activity going on in the house as yet. Nor is there much here. Most of the boys are pretty tired and are doing a lot of thinking.\n\nI want to thank you once again for all of the lovely gifts I received and I hope that we can all be together for our next Christmas. All my love Ted.\"\n\nDate:\n\n12/23/2004\n\nTime:\n\n3:31 PM\n\nMarauder Men - Sgt. J. A. Hodesh, Cpl. James. H. Skinner, Cpl. John Quirk - Daily Hampshire Gazette, Wednesday, July 26, 1944. Mild And Bitter, Marauder B-26 Marauder\n\nDate:\n\n12/23/2004\n\nTime:\n\n2:23 PM\n\nSixty years ago today, thirty-six B-26's of the 397th Bomb Group took off in the snow to bomb the Eller Railroad bridge. Fighter escort missed the rendezvous, leaving the group to continue on to the bridge alone. The group was attacked by three waves of 15 German fighters. They encountered heavy flak over the target area. The bridge was bombed using GEE. The bridge was hit and put out of use. Leaving the target area they were again attacked by German fighters. Eleven B-26's did not return from that mission. The group received a Distinguished Unit Citation for the mission.\n\nToday, American servicemen and women are fighting halfway around the world again. Let us remember the sacrifices of those men 60 years ago and the sacrifices of our friends and neighbors today.\n\nGod bless them all,\n\nWynn Anderson\n\nMarauder Man - Andy Anderson\n\nWynn,\n\nSixty years ago today the following losses were suffered by B26 units bombing tactical targets in support of the Allied armies.\n\n1st.PFF Squadron - 3\n\n17th.Bomb Group - 1\n\n320th.Bomb Group - 1\n\n322nd.Bomb Group - 2\n\n323rd.Bomb Group - 2\n\n387th.Bomb Group - 5\n\n391st Bomb Group - 16\n\n397th.Bomb Group - 11\n\nA sum total of 41 B26's being missing in action in addition to which many returned so badly damaged as to be of no further combat use. Your nation today does indeed owe a deep debt of gratitude to the many young men who sacrificed their lives that day to ensure that a bloody war was brought to a swift conclusion. Remember they were so young and they gave their all for peace.\n\nOn that day 60 years ago the weather was very bad, and the fighter escorts had an almost impossible task of making rendezvous with the bombers. The two Groups who suffered the most the 391st and the 397th flew without escort. In any case the entire scenario was in utter confusion both on the ground and in the air.\n\nRegards,\n\nTrevor Allen\n\nhistorian b26.com\n\nDate:\n\n12/22/2004\n\nTime:\n\n10:35 PM\n\nMarauderman's Name: Vernon L. Heim\n\nBomb Group: 391st\n\nBomb Squadron: 573rd\n\nYears in service: 4+\n\nGraduation Class:\n\nClass Location:\n\nComments: I'm just now starting more serious research into the history of what my grandfather did. He was a flight engineer and crew chief for a B-26 nicknamed \"Pink's Lady\" (NOT Pink's Lady II...that I know of.) A common Internet excerpt I've found is \"Still going strong with seventy-eight missions to her credit, one of the ships nicknamed Pinks Lady, was the most durable Marauder in the Group. The plane had never aborted through mechanical failure, testifying to the engineering skill of her ground crew and T/Sgt Vernon L Heim, Crew Chief, of Schuylkill Haven Pa. \" This quote relates to Mission #100, June 20, 1944, on Predefin and La Belle Hotesse, France.\n\nHe was listed on a single flight plan I was able to dig up on the Internet from MacDill AFB, Florida. His enter date was 4-21-1943, and mil number XXXX1609. To my knowledge, he spent time in Myrtle Beach, Florida, Greenland, England, France and Germany- ending his USAAF career at Olmstead AFB, Harrisburg/Middletown, PA. I am seeking personal stories, mission details, and mostly- a photo of the nose art or numbers for this particular plane. I'd like to relate what he and others did during the war, to my young Son. Please feel free to contact me. Thank you to the B26.COM site and those who served to defend us!\n\nThanks very much,\n\nShawn\n\nDate:\n\n12/22/2004\n\nTime:\n\n10:27 PM\n\nHello: My father, the late Edward W. Davis was a member of the 452nd Bomb Sq and arrived in England the day after the disaster at Ijmuiden. He was a pilot and flew 76 combat missions for which he was awarded 2 DFCs and 13 DAM's. His best friend was Roy Edge, with whom he trained and served. Dad was the commander of the Lt Edge's honor guard when he was buried at the American Cemetery in England. Edge was later re-buried in his hometown in Georgia. My father retired as a Lt Col from the USAF in 1965 and became the Director of the Arkansas Public Service Commission and later the President of the Arkansas Telephone Association.\n\nHe died in 1991.\n\nPhilip\n\nDate:\n\n12/21/2004\n\nTime:\n\n7:38 AM\n\nI recently was very pleased to discover your web site. I thought perhaps it would help me learn a little more about my brother Floyd's plane and the crews experiences. Floyd was with the 391st BG, 573rd BS and the plane was 42-107841, named Little Pink Panties. Sorry to say Floyd has recently died. I met the entire crew at their reunion in Tampa, Florida in 1988. I am writing to ask how I might contact persons who have submitted inputs to your web site. I would like to provide some information to those who had any ties to the plane, Little Pink Panties. Example: Entry 10/14/2002, 12:53:51 PM. Johnnie F. Jones states that he flew missions in \"Little Pink Panties\". On April 16th, he doesn't remember which plane they flew in but their plane took a direct hit and they had to bail out. It wasn't Little Pink Panties because I had found during my previous research that she had sustained flak damage on March 25, 1945 and crash landed. The entry of 10/12/2003, 5:54 PM confirms that. Again in entry 7/7/2002, 3:41:12 PM , the son of E. Z. Rice is searching for information about the plane his farther was in during a mid-air collision and subsequent ditching on 25 August 1944. On that date, it couldn't have been Little Pink Panties. I also would like to contact Terry Marines Rogers whose father was the bombardier of Little Pink panties. I'd tell her that my brother Floyd, another member of that crew, has passed on and the only one I know of who is still with us is the pilot, Hop Cassiday.\n\nSincerely,\n\nHerman J. May\n\nHerman,\n\nYour identity of \"Little Pink Panties\" is correct 42-107841 coded T6-A and its loss in a crash-landing caused by severe flak damage. Elmer Z Rice was not flying \"Little Pink Panties\" when he was in a mid air collision and his B26 ditched at sea off the Channel Islands. When Johnnie F Jones was shot down he had been transferred to another Group and Squadron the 387th.BG 559th Bomb Squadron.\n\nRegards,\n\nTrevor J Allen\n\nhistorian b26.com\n\nDate:\n\n12/20/2004\n\nTime:\n\n10:38 PM\n\nMarauderman's Name: William C.

Veterans from across the United States returned to find Bastogne covered in snow, just as it was that bitter cold December of 1944. The town of 14,000 took the brunt of the six-week battle that raged across the Ardennes hills of southern Belgium and Luxembourg. \"The American veterans who have returned 60 years later to the battle site represent those who gave their lives on our soil, so that today we can live free,\" Bastogne Mayor Philippe Collard said in French at a memorial honoring U.S. General George S.

McDonald, I am the nephew of Lieutenant Albert G. Burger Jr., who died in 1944 in a raid over France. I have received many items that belonged to him from my mother who has passed them on to me. She has given me many newspaper clippings and 3 of his pilot's log books. I have seen several names of planes associated with his name but am not sure what plane or planes he flew the most or which plane he was flying when it was shot down. One newspaper article says that there were 4 parachutes seen leaving the plane. The story I got from my mother was that oil from the engine was on him and he burned all the way down. I think he lived for another 3 weeks in a hospital in France before finally succumbing to his burns.\n\nI would like to known if anyone knows him and can tell me something about his life, his plane, his personality, and if there were any survivors of this crash. I noticed his name mentioned in missions 39, 81 and 82. I am becoming increasingly interested in the history of my ancestors of WWII. I would appreciate any correspondence on this subject. Thank you all for your sacrifices and may God Bless...\n\nSincerely,\n\nDavid\n\nDavid,\n\nLt Burger was flying B26 41-34989 YA-T \"Rocks Off\" of the 555th Bomb Squadron when he was shot down on June 12th 1944.

Albert Burger.\n\nI saw your inquiry regarding your uncle Albert G. Burger, Jr. He was a B-26 pilot in the 555th Bomb Squadron, 386th Bomb Group. He flew his first mission with the Group on August 27, 1943, (Group mission number 009) and his last mission on June 12, 1944 was Group mission number 205. You can read about some of the missions he flew as listed: 009, 013, 015, 022, 023. On September 22nd he was assigned to fly an extra plane which as it turned out was not needed. Then he flew on mission 027, 029, we lost the Cox crew on that one, and I was wounded by flak. Mission numbers: 032, 039, 055, 092, 113, and 205 when he was shot down. Your uncles crew returned the U.S. in late spring of 1944. He stayed on in England and married an English bride.\n\nMonday, June 12, 1944 The Group was briefed to fly a bombing mission to a marshalling yard target located at Bretigny-sur-orge, France. This would be a late afternoon effort and the second mission of the day for the 386th Group. Your uncle was flying a plane named, ROCKS OFF 134989 YA-, he was number six in the low flight in the second box of eighteen ships. At approximately 1800 hours the Group neared a place named Lillebonne on the way into enemy territory. Heavy type flak began bursting within the formation while flying at 10,000 feet.\n\nOne flak shell exploded beneath the cockpit of your uncles plane, the fragmentation tore the forward fuselage to ribbons setting the maze of hydraulic lines located in the nose wheel well under the cockpit on fire. A witness reported seeing somebody falling from the ship, that probably was your uncle. Another report stated that immediately after the hit, the plane swerved to the right, narrowly missing a collision with the number five plane in the low flight. Then the ship rolled over twice, went into a dive approximately for 3,000 feet, then leveled off for a few seconds. At that point the radioman Staff Sergeant John H. Nekervis was able to bail out from a waist window.\n\nThe plane floated a bit as something in the ship blew up, at that point it went into a spin until crashing into the ground and exploding. Staff Sergeant Nekervis while hanging in his parachute saw the plane crash and heard the explosion, he came down very near his plane. Four of the crew were killed in the crash. Your uncle was found still strapped in his parachute and was taken to a hospital where he died from severe burns a few weeks later. Nekervis received small cuts from underbrush on a later date while attempting to elude some German soldiers. He became a P.O.W. Five of the crewmembers were on the same crew, however that day your uncle was their pilot.\n\nMembers of the downed aircraft were 1st Lt. Albert G. Burger, Jr. pilot, 2nd Lt. Warren F. Lodge, Jr. co-pilot, Sergeant Stanley S. Kondak bombardier, Staff Sergeant Morris L. Samuelson engineer, Staff Sergeant Leon F. McGonigle tail gunner, all lost their lives due to enemy action. Tech Sergeant John H. Nekervis radioman managed to survive the war. Check out my web page listed below for more stories about the 386th Bomb Group.\n\nSincerely, Chester P.

My father was Henry C. Winstell, born, raised and died in New Orleans, LA. He was part of the 320th B.G, 442 B.S. He passed away 10/1/1978 after 30 beautiful years of marriage with my mother. From stories I listened to as a kid growing up in the 1950's and hungry to learn about anything that flew or flies, I learned that my dad was a crew chief on a B-26 that he always referred to as the 'Skeleton Duck.' It seems that the B.G. insignia was Donald Duck running with a bomb under his arm and this was painted on all the B-26's in the group or squadron. Evidently some enterprising crew member painted over parts of the duck insignia and the remnants looked like duck bones. The number on the tail of that plane was 118056. I am herewith attaching copies of the only four photos we ever had. The backs of the photos all say they're form 1943. I would love to see these on your great web-site. My dad is in all photos. He is the first man (tallest) on the left of the group standing in the back row. He is standing slightly to the right of the starboard engine, under the prop in the big group composite photo.\n\nI would really love to hear form anyone who knew my dad or anything about the aircraft.

My grandfather flew with a B26 and the only information I have is that he was a Pathfinder. His name was Oliver Lee McCaskill. He passed about two years ago and I am looking for any information about his service to our country. I'd like to hear from anybody who can tell me anything about him. He was from Leland Mississippi.\n\nEmmett,\n\nYour grandfather was originally with the 553rd.Bomb Squadron 386th.Bomb Group and was transferred with the rest of his crew to the 1st Pathfinder Squadron (Provisional) February 14th 1944. The crew were as follows:\n\n1.Lt Gilbert Howe, XXXX586, Pilot\n\nF/O Olever L McCaskill, XXXX565, Co-Pilot\n\n1.Lt Nathan E Offenhiser, XXXX191, Navigator\n\n1.Lt Warren B Hinchee, XXXX665, Bombardier\n\nT/Sgt Jack C Darby, XXXX616, Radio/Gunner\n\nS/Sgt Eugene G Godziewcki, XXXX799, Engineer/Gunner\n\nS/Sgt Edward T Kozlowski, XXXX842, Tail Gunner\n\nThe crew flew its first mission April 18th, 1944 when it led the 386th Bomb Group to Calais, France, but due to the radar going out of action the mission was abandoned.\n\nTrevor Allen\n\nhistorian b26.com\n\nHello Emmett, saw your request in the B-26 guest book concerning your grandfather Oliver Lee McCaskill. He was a member of the Lieutenant Howe crew. Your grandfather was a co-pilot. The name of their plane was HARD LUCK 131610 AN-P.\n\nThe Howe crew flew on the 386th B.G. diversion mission number 3. They flew on the following combat missions with the Group: 003, 004, 005, 008, 010, 011, 012, 013, 014, 016, 020, 022, 027, and on a recalled mission September 26, 1943. They also flew on mission number 054, 092 (missions 92.1 & 92.2), that was February 8, 1944. On February 14, 1944 they were transferred to The 1st Pathfinder Squadron, Provisional.\n\nThe Howe crew had nicknames for each of the crew: Lt. Howe, the pilot was known as Doc. Co-pilot F/O McCaskill was known as Runt. Radioman T/Sgt. Darby was called Junior. Bombardier/Navigator Lt. Offenhiser was Nate. Engineer S/Sgt. Godziecki was called Gus. Tail gunner S/Sgt. Kozlowski was called Eddie.\n\nYou can read about the above listed missions the Howe crew flew on--go to my web page, this is by no means a complete list of their combat flights, but there is enough for you to get an idea of how things were at that time. You can also click on, Formation Diagrams regarding the above mission numbers to see where they flew in the formation on any given day. My web page address is shown below.\n\nChester P.

My father was 1/Lt. Herchel E. Palmer, pilot. His crew is as follows:\n\n1/Lt. David Lawton\n\nS/Sgt. Andrew Lynch, Jr.\n\nS/Sgt. Richard Aylward\n\nS/Sgt. George Wolff. (585th Squadron).\n\nThey were part of the 394th Bomb Group, 98th Bomb Wing, 9th Bomb Division, 9th Air Force.\n\nOn December 2, 1944, my father and his crew were on a bombing mission over the area of Saarbrucken (spelling), Germany. Bad weather was a factor on the return flight and they were directed to bases in France and Belgium. The plane crashed somewhere in France and all were killed immediately except for S/Sgt. George Wolff. He died of injuries of December 10, 1944.\n\nMy name is Sylvia Work. I would like to hear from anyone who served with these men or a family member.\n\nSylvia,\n\nThe 394th Bomb Group lost ten B26's on December 2nd 1944 due either to bad weather or running out of fuel. Your father's B26 crashed near Guise, France.\n\nRegards,\n\nTrevor Allen\n\nhistorian b26.com\n\nDate:\n\n12/5/2004\n\nTime:\n\n8:55 PM\n\nMy name is Scott Clemens and I am conducting research on Lt. Clint Castleberry, Jr., who was killed when his B26G, 44-67866, was lost off of the coast of Africa on November 7, 1944. I have obtained a copy of MACR 9925, which details the search for 44-67861 and 44-67866, both lost on the same date. The documentation includes orders from the 1103d AAF Base Unit Caribbean Division, ATC, which seem to detail the ferrying flights for seven B26Gs. I have not been able to find any information on where the aircraft were headed or what happened to them. I am obviously most interested in 44-67866, but the others are:\n\n44-67859\n\n44-67862\n\n44-67863\n\n44-67854\n\n44-67853\n\n43-34575\n\nThe MACR indicates that the two aircraft lost on 11/07/44 left five minutes apart from Roberts Field and were not flying in formation.\n\nAny information is greatly appreciated.\n\nScott\n\nScott,\n\nThe B26's you note were all destined for delivery to the Free French Air Force, and would have been delivered to Rabat in Morocco. Where the USAAF crews would go to thereafter is open to surmise. By this time both the 9th.AAF and the 1st Tactical Air Force were operating from European bases. If you have the MACR then you probably have all the information available.

My father was only able to tell me that his brother flew \"fire hydrant\" bombers. My father had no background in aviation so that's about all I had. I've always wondered what type of aircraft it was. I finally deduced it was the B-26 from watching \"Wings\" on TV. Growing up as a boy I always wanted to be a pilot. Unfortunately I only managed to become a naval aircrew man in the U.S. Navy. All I have of my uncle is a pair of his pilots wings. I found this web site doing a Goggle search. I do know that he died in Germany flying a German Messerschmitt. I was also told by my aunt the he was awarded the DFC with oak leaf cluster. So if anyone has more information about his squadron, a source for a picture of the airplane, or any other information I would greatly appreciate it.

I would like to talk to anyone who knew him or knows any information about the bombing mission on which he was shot down. Thank you, Jay Warner\n\nGuest book ref. November 19, 2004. Subject, W. Fred Cox, Jr. 552nd B.S., 386th B.G.\n\nHello Jay, I saw your notice in the guest book asking for data concerning your uncle who was a pilot in my squadron. I have been the 386th Bomb Group Historian for nearly 25 years. I was in the ship flying directly behind and slightly below your uncle when his ship was hit by flak. The fire from his left wing and engine passed over the top of my plane and extended about 100 feet to the rear. I was wounded along with both pilots flying in the plane next to my crew.\n\nIf you check into my web page as listed at the bottom of this page, you can read the entire story of his last mission, which I list as 029. Your uncle flew on the following listed missions. Diversionary missions number 2 and 3. Combat missions number: 001, 004, 006, 008, 012, 013, 015, 017, 019, 023. Then a recalled mission on September 26, 1943, and combat mission number 029 when he was shot down.\n\nIf you click on formation diagrams you will be able to see the flight position that he flew on all of the aforementioned missions. I try to add more stories about the 386th every few weeks, so stay in touch. At the moment I have 16 pages of photos on my web page. Many of the stories also include other photos that pertain to each particular story.\n\nI have 181 items on my web page to click on, which includes 81 mission formation diagrams.\n\nThere was a request for information about Staff Sergeant Arthur Vermette on the web site ( see below ) - he was a member of your uncles crew and was flying with him when they were shot down. The entire crew was killed in action that day! That request was referred to my web page listing mission number 029.\n\nA man in France by the name of John Chatel and I have been in contact with for several years concerning the missions the 386th flew in his area. He lives a short distance back from Normandy Beach, he also set up a wonderful display in a museum there depicting the activities of the 386th Bomb Group on D-DAY, 60 years ago last June 6, 2004. He informed me some time ago that he installed a plaque at the crash site honoring your uncles crew by listing their names thereon. The location is two miles south of St. Valery airdrome in an area called Cany-Barville, France. Well Jay, that is all for this sortie. Tallyho.\n\nChester P.

My uncle, James H. Skinner, flew as a radio/navigator with the B26 in the ETO. See http://www.b26.com/marauderman/james_skinner.htm.\n\nI have noticed several folks asking for \"Stars and Stripes\" papers describing various missions into Holland. I have an interesting copy of Vol. 3, No. 240 Wed. Aug. 11, 1943. There is a front page article on the B26 Marauder when it's secret use was unmasked for the first time. It explained that on May 14, 1943 it was first used to bomb Velson, Holland at treetop level with complete success, but on May 17 10 B26's were lost in one operation. {It seemed that the German's crude radar and spotters was able to detect them and point effective AAA on them.} Operations were suspended until new tactics could be worked out.\n\nOn July 17, 1943 they again flew, but at a medium altitude while covered by Spitfires around them and P47s above. This raid was successful and all returned to their base. Since then they only have lost two plane using these tactics. The article further explained that they still did low lever bombing when it fit the operations and had air and ground support. There was a photo of a B26 flying over water with a tail ID of H7694.\n\nFurther information on my uncle:\n\nMy uncle was stationed in England until Sep. 1944 then in France until April 1945 and then in Belgium until he started for home in June of 1945. Anyone that has any photos of this wing or knowledge of Cpl. James H. Skinner I would like to exchange information.\n\nAnother wonderful research project:\n\nI also have done a lot of research on a past close friend and highly decorated hero, Dr. Arie Dirk Bestebreurtje, Major, retired. See http://www.b26.com/page/arie.d.bestebreurtje.htm. I am interested in learning more about the bombing raids before Operation Market Garden, especially over Nijmegen and also during that operation. This is where Capt. Bestebreurtje jumped as a Jedburgh OSS agent. He was in the lead plane and jumped with General James Gavin.\n\nKind regards,\n\nJohn H.

J'habite près de Paris, Votre site sur les B26 Marauder est très intéressant et je vous félicite pour la somme d'informations qu'il contient. Votre °APPEL° m'incite à faire la mise au point suivante: En page 3 \"Photos B 26 \" ( not B26.COM ) de votre site, on voit la photo d'un B26 coupé en 2 par la flak et vous précisez que cet avion est britannique, ce qui est faux. Il est français et appartient à la 34 ème escadre de bombardement moyen des FAFL, qui est composé de 3 groupes baptisés : \"Franche Comté\" , \"Sénégal\", \"Bourgogne\". Cet avion est de groupe \"Bourgogne\" ( grands vins français ) et il est surnommé \"Vosne Romanée\" (célèbre chateau des vins de Bourgogne). Vous pouvez remarquer que la cocarde française bleu-blanc-rouge est peinte à la place de l'étoile à 5 branches américaine. Cet avion vole dans une formation de 18 B26 des FAFL qui vont bombarder l'usine de munitions de JOCKGRIN en Allemagne. C'est un type G. Son serial number est 4334281 . Le numéro d'identification français peint en grosses lettres vertes sur la dérive est 62. La date du bombardement est le 14 février 1945. Léquipage est de 7 membres. 3 ont disparu dans la chute. Ce sont:\n\nCommandant ROLLAND chef de bord\n\nLieutenant VAL bombardier\n\n\" \" BERTRAND mécanicien\n\n4 ont la vie savuve.

J'ajouterai que le B26G serial number 4334253 (46) appartenant aussi à la 34 ème escadre a été abattu par la flak le 17 novembre 1944 en bombardant le pont ferroviaire de NEUENBURG sur le Rhin en Allemagne.

I am French. I live close to Paris. Your site on B26 Marauder is very interesting and I congratulate you for the sum on information which it contains. Your °APPEL° encourages to me to make the following development: On page 3 \"Photographs B 26\" of your site, one sees the photograph of B26 cut into 2 by the flak and you specify that this plane is British, which is false. It is French and belongs to the 34 2nd squadron of average bombardment of the FAFL, which is composed of 3 baptized groups: \"Honest County\", \"Senegal\", \"Burgundy\". This plane is of group \"Burgundy\" (high-class wines French) and it is called \"Vosne Romanée\" (castle of the wines of Burgundy celebrates). You can notice that the French rosette blue-white-red is painted in the place of American star with 5 branches. This plane flies in a formation of 18 B26 of the FAFL which will bombard the factory of ammunition of JOCKGRIN in Germany. It is a type G. Its serial number is 4334281. The French identification number painted in large green letters on the drift is 62. The date of the bombardment is on February 14, 1945. Léquipage is of 7 members. 3 disappeared in the fall. It is:\n\nCommander ROLLAND chief of edge\n\nLieutenant VALLEY bomber\n\n\"\" BERTRAND mechanic 4 have the life savuve. It is:\n\nPilot lieutenant DRAPER\n\n\"\" BEAULIEU radio\n\n\"\" CHAMPROMIS navigator\n\nSergeant FAUDRY grapeshot the history to this plane was told in a large French newspaper (Paris Match) in 1965. I will add that the B26G serial number 4334253 (46) also pertaining to the 34 2nd squadron was cut down by the flak on November 17, 1944 by bombarding the railway bridge of NEUENBURG on the Rhine in Allemagne. Mon radio frére on board this plane disappeared with 4 other members from crew. In enclosures:\n\n- 2 photographs taken on the aerodrome of Pontoise close of bets in 1997 at the time of a demonstration in the honor of the 344 2nd Bomb Group equipped with B26 which had stationed on this ground into 1944/1945. On one of the photographs, notice the flying model of B26 built with the memory of my brother missing in 1944\n\n-1 photograph from B26 exposed to the Museum from the Air in Le Bourget close to Paris.\n\nFriendships of old of the French Air Force.\n\nDate:\n\n11/11/2004\n\nTime:\n\n10:16 PM\n\nRichard Robinson, B-26 Pilot\n\n323 BG\n\n455 BS\n\n\"Liberty Lady\" YU V 4131781 (and others?)\n\n\"Robbie\" is my wife's uncle\n\nBailed out on return from Schipol bombing run in 1943, not sure if this was mission #54 or #55. The mission was told by Bud Hutton (Stars & Stripes). I am not sure if Bud flew on this mission, but he flew with Robbie on some. There is a pic somewhere of Robbie, and others, by the b26. This pic was used in a Kodak Ad, I believe Life Mag.\n\nRichard was awarded the British Dist. Flying Cross, LT. Col. Geo. P. Gould of St. Paul, Minn. and 2nd LT. Richard E. Robinson of IL. and LT. Olaf A. Begre of Lichville, N. D., bombardier also received the award. Rich has Medals and Ribbons.\n\nThe Col. made a crash landing without injury to his crew. Lt. Robinson & his crew bailed out after losing both engines, the pilot jumping at 400 ft. after remaining with the plane to prevent it from crashing into a village. Both men hold the Amer. Distinguished Flying Cross & LT. Robinson also has a cluster to the award.\n\nWe are new to this B26 history and will have to tell Robbie that we are looking into his past. Any info or connection would be appreciated, nose art, missions, etc.\n\nQuestion: What happens to the planes name after a crash? can it be re-used, was another plane of Robbie's called \"Lady Liberty? I will have to ask him how many B-26's he had.\n\nThanks J & P\n\nJohn --- the names painted on B26's were very personnel to both the crew assigned to that B26 and the crew chief responsible for maintaining it. Often the crew chose the name, but on occasion it was the crew chief who named it. In most Groups when a B26 was lost or salvaged the artwork and name was lost with the plane. Then when a new B26 was assigned either the original name with either 2nd or II was added, or the new plane was given an entirely new name.\n\nOne Group stood apart from the others because of the excellent artwork that adorned its Marauders. This was the 394th Bomb Group and when they lost an airplane through damage, or they moved onto another B26 they would take the nose art with them since this was normally painted onto detachable panels on the B26.\n\nRegards,\n\nTrevor Allen\n\nhistorian b26.com\n\nDate:\n\n11/9/2004\n\nTime:\n\n10:12 PM\n\nHi, I'm interested in any information, Group, squadron, plane, missions for a Lt.

It may have been Dec 23 or the day before Christmas that, as I recall, five or six planes didn't come back and two or three others got back but were so shot up they couldn't get their landing gear down and had to belly land on the field. Fortunately, I was not on that mission. It was the next day, Christmas day, that I flew my first mission. On that day the plane ahead of us crash on take off because of frost on its wings. The plane in number five position in our flight got knocked out over the target. Other planes were shot up but I don't know if there were any others that didn't make it back. We were in number six position and were getting hit pretty badly. We could see, smell, taste and hear flack as well as feel the concussion. The Germans knocked out our right engine over the target. It took a lot of time to get the bombs out that hung up in the bomb-bay because it was hit with flack. With that, one dead engine, and the wings icing up, we were losing altitude like a rock. When we got down to about three thousand feet (lower than some of the mountain tops around there) we finally got rid of the bombs, broke below the clouds. and the ice started to break off. Straining the good engine for all it had in it we finally got back to our base. Needless to say, this was a very horrifying initiation that I will never forget. This was one of my worst mission. Although some of the missions were what we called \"Milk Runs\" (not much enemy fire) we had a number of bad ones in the Battle of The Bulge where, again, we lost an engine a couple of times. When you think of all the poor devils that never came back - I guess I was blessed.\n\nDate:\n\n10/11/2004\n\nTime:\n\n11:03 AM\n\nMarauderman's Name: George F.

Here's what I know:\n\nMy father-in-law, Maj. Joe S. Long, was flying a B-26 with a crew of five. He departed Kumean, South Korea, at 2300 and was headed to Yongyu, South Korea. The last message was a posit at 2353. The crew was never heard from again. A search of the area and photos did not show any wreckage.\n\nMy questions deal with the practical aspects of flying a B-26. If the aircraft experienced a mechanical (engine failure) would it be easy to leave the plane and parachute to the ground? I am not a pilot, but my understanding is that it is easier in some planes than others.\n\nWith a payload of 3,000 to 4,000 would it be possible to fly with one engine?\n\nWe have GPS and ring laser gyros these days. Fifty years ago, they had DR and Radio Direction Finding. How good were the navigators?\n\nGiven that the plane was heavily loaded, if there were an engine failure, wouldn't you drop the load of bombs anywhere and try for a landing?\n\nThanks for the help,\n\nBruce Adams\n\nHello Bruce, the B-26s that flew in Korea were the original A-26s and they picked up the \"B\" when there were no longer any Marauders in the inventory. The plane they are talking about was the Invader, North American product that I have about1500 hours in. To answer some of the questions about it. It cruised at 240 mph. It had a crew of three, except when it led the formation in a glass nosed one and then the crew was four. The navigators were very good but they were also bombardiers at the same time. Some time the navigator flew in the cockpit in the jump seat next to the pilot for it was a one pilot plane. One control. The B-26s in Korea sometime flew individual sorties at low level which 2300 feet was considered that. It was very vulnerable to ground fire at that altitude, especially 20mm. It could fly very well on one engine and I taught single engine approaches and landings in it. If it had an engine knocked out, the bombs were immediately jettisoned and the flight could continue very well on one engine at about 190mph. Approach and landing air speed was about 130, with a touch down about 105. Bail out was easy but one had to be careful that he wouldn't hit the tail, so I taught roll over tactics for bail out. The crew member in the nose bailed out down through an exit there. The tail gunner went out the side but he was below the tail and that was no problem. It sounds as if the plane in question was hit hard by ground fire which might have exploded the bombs or got some direct hits on the plane itself.\n\nRegards,\n\nHugh Walker, Pilot, Marauder Man\n\n322nd BG/ 449th BS\n\n391st BG/ 572 BS\n\nDate:\n\n10/8/2004\n\nTime:\n\n3:39 PM\n\nSaturday October 16, there will be a dedication of a monument to the 323rd Bomb Group in Samoussy, France, adjacent to the old Laon Athies airbase, Station A-69.

He was born in Rotterdam, Holland and became a champion speed skater in his younger years, and later studied law in Zurich.

More information...\n\nDate:\n\n10/6/2004\n\nTime:\n\n5:59 AM\n\nI note that my father-in-law, Curtis S. Church, is missing from the 320th roster. Curtis was a pilot in the 441st. He was shot down over Naples on 21 Aug 43 while flying his 46th mission (I believe his aircraft was \"Snuffy Smith\") and spent the remainder of the war as a POW.\n\nHe wrote a rather interesting memoir of his POW experience. A copy is in the Air Force library at Maxwell AFB and I can provide an electronic copy for the B-26 website, if desired.\n\nCurtis was a great guy. Sadly, he died about 2 1/2 years ago.\n\nHis fishing buddies used to kid him about being a German ace. He lost 5 B-26s. One in Tampa Bay during training when an engine quit on take-off (co-pilot). Four as pilot: two belly landed with battle damage, one ditched in the Med when they ran out of fuel after going down to the surface to drop their raft to a crew whose plane just exploded while returning from a mission, and the one shot down by fighters over Naples. Amazingly, no one was killed or even seriously injured in any of these incidents. William Jones, Lt Col USAF (ret)\n\nDate:\n\n10/5/2004\n\nTime:\n\n7:53 PM\n\nMr. McCarty, This is a great site!

I can't find anything about Gobeil and McLandish in the NARA.\n\nThank you,\n\nRainer Kliemann\n\nBavaria/Germany\n\nInitial findings in italics: February 4, 1944, the aircrews were briefed to attack the NoBalls at Linghem and Le Grismont but poor weather led to the missions being scrubbed before take-off. Late on the 5th this attack finally got off the ground but weather over the targets forced all three boxes to drop on the secondary target-a NoBall site at Dannes. The bombing results were fair to good but the cost was three aircraft with 19 aircrewmen lost, 30 other aircraft damaged and two returning aircrew-man wounded. The Marauders going down had been flown by Capt. James N. Bryan, 1st Lt. Robert P Mims' and 1st Lt. Arthur J. Mandiberg. Some parachutes were seen. MIA were Capt. James N. Bryan, 1st Lt. John K. Brush, 1st Lt. Salvatore E. Echo, S/Sgt William J. Hendrickson, S/Sgt John A. Holton, 1st Lt. William J. Hook, 1st Lt. Leon R. Jackson, 1st Lt. Arnold J. Mandiberg, 1st Lt. John R. Martin, Sgt Harry E. McLandish, T/Sgt William F. McLaren, 1st Lt. Robert P. Mims, S/Sgt Michael R. Miyo, Sgt Paul C. Pearce, 1st Lt. Winton A. Scott, S/Sgt Silvio J. Tulipane, S/Sgt William F. Vermillion, S/Sgt Robert C. White and Capt. Charles L. Whyte.\n\nThe \"Chriesman Crew\" was scheduled as a spare but at the last minute it was ordered to take-off and join up in a number seven position. \"As it so happened, this was in Lt. Mandiberg's flight. When the flak came up, it was fierce. One shell made a direct hit on Mandiberg's right engine. Continuing to spin, the propeller came off and flew through the formation. Behind Mandiberg, we flew through a curtain of oil, nuts and bolts.\" Postwar comments of John W. Price.\n\n[About ten days went by] \"...during which time the Russians insisted that we give them a complete list of all POWs by name, home address, etc. I happened to be Assistant Housing Officer on Zemke's staff and had this task as a part of my job. We completed the list, in English, and they said, \"Nyet,\" demanding that the list be in Russian. Fortunately, we had ten or twelve men in camp who were fluent in Russian. Working around the clock, we finished this job in around two days.\n\nZemke's plan finally came to fruition and we were evacuated by air. We marched the fellows to the airfield, the troop carriers landed, cut one engine, loaded and took off, taking the men to Camp Lucky Strike in France.\n\nZemke and his staff, including me, took the last flight out and went straight to Paris where we were billeted in an Air Force hotel. Zemke tried to get air passage for all of us, but was not successful, as only he had that priority.

He is my uncle and was listed as missing during the Battle of the Bulge. No further information was ever received. Jim Harrison\n\nI have Mr. Clark A Tavener, 1st Lt, Serial Number X-XXX331, 575 Bomb Squadron, 391 Bomb Group; Date of Death: 23 Dec 1944; Location: Missing; Awards: AM,15 OLC, PM. Enlisted State was California. Mr. Tavener is listed as being buried at the Luxembourg American Cemetery http://www.abmc.gov/lx.htm\n\nMr. Clark A Tavener is unaccounted for. He is probably memorialized on the Tablets of the Missing at Luxembourg American Cemetery.\n\nCircumstances of Loss: On 23 December 1944, a B-26 piloted by 1st Lt Tavener and crewed by the below mentioned airmen, departed A-73 France on a bombing mission over Ahrweiler, Germany. According to Major Herschel S. Harkins, XXXX065, 1st Lt Tavener's aircraft was last sighted approximately 3 miles east of Ahrweiler, Germany. Major Harkins posits that ubiquitous enemy fighters downed 1st Lt Tavener's plane near that location.\n\nStatus and disposition of crew:\n\n1) Tavener, Clark A., 1st Lt, XXXX331: 1st Lt Tavener is unaccounted for.\n\n2) Castle, Mark W., 2nd Lt, XXXX500: 2nd Lt Castle is listed as killed in action in Germany. He is buried at the Luxembourg American Cemetery, Luxembourg City, Luxembourg.\n\n3) Wilkinson, Patrick H., 1st Lt, XXXX110: 1st Lt Wilkenson is listed as killed in action in Germany. He is buried at the Luxembourg American Cemetery, Luxembourg City, Luxembourg.\n\n4) Wyne, Joseph W., TSgt, XXXX360: TSgt Wyne parachuted safely. He was captured and held POW. He was eventually returned to U.S. control.\n\n5) McGettigan, John F., Cpl, XXXX127: Cpl McGettigan reportedly died in the aircraft as a result of enemy fire. He was reportedly buried by German soldiers in an isolated grave 5 kilometers west of Lunebach. He was buried at St. Avold Military Cemetery, France, but has since been disinterred and is now interred at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\n6) Dick, Frank D., Cpl, XXXX100: Cpl Dick parachuted safely. He was captured and held POW. He was eventually returned to U.S. control.\n\nAdditional information: In 1948 a U.S. civilian investigator concluded that 1st Lt Wilkinson and 2nd Lt Castle likely survived the crash. Their burial records do not indicate that their bodies were recovered from the crash, and shrapnel and gunshot wounds to the chest are listed as their causes of death. Their place of death is listed as Binsfield, Germany, but there is no evidence that 1st Lt Tavener's aircraft crashed there. Instead, the U.S. investigator proffered that 1st Lt Wilkinson and 2nd Lt Castle tried to make it back to Allied Lines and were caught and killed by Germans. Or, that they made it to Allied lines and died while fighting with the infantry. If either scenario is true, it is possible that they might have died near Binsfield, which explains why that town is listed as their place of death. In summation, 1st Lt Wilkinson and 2nd Lt Castle may have died near Binsfield. But, as explained infra, it is not likely where 1st Lt Tavener's aircraft crashed.\n\nIn 1948 a U.S. civilian investigator searched Binsfield, Germany searching for 1st Lt Tavener's remains. As explained supra, Binsfield was likely searched because 1st Lt Wilkinson's and 2nd Lt Castle's Reports of Death listed that town as their place of death. The investigator interviewed several persons concerning 1st Lt Tavener's aircraft crash; they were certain that no Allied aircrafts crashed near Binsfield or in the surrounding area on 23 December 1944. Furthermore, they were unaware of anyone havi"
