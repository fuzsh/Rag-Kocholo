My literary experience encompasses some writing/reporting for a small local hometown newspaper, of which they knew nothing, and most recently doing a newsletter for the 45lst Bomb Group called \"Ad Lib.\" The Ad Lib is a spin-off from the old Base flyer that told about happenings on the Castelluccio Air Field during our wartime tenure. Apart from that, I had questions as to \"Why me?\" But, the more I pondered the subject, the more I came to realize that they were looking for someone that had experienced the trauma that comes with high altitude combat flying. They were not looking for a big-time hero, nor were they looking for someone that was barely familiar with the B-24. They were seeking someone that could relate to what it was like to fly in the B-24, and to have seen combat first hand. In that sense I qualified with my 389 hours ofB-24 flying time. Our crew (Captain Henry G. Rollins' crew, 724th Bomb Squadron) completed our tour of 35 combat missions; Pilot and Engineer awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross; and five of us garnered the Purple Heart. This including our Radio Operator, T/Sgt Anthony Paonessa, who was killed in action on 29 December 1944. We were also entitled to wear nine Battle Stars on our Campaign Ribbon, plus three Distinguished Unit Citations. Those facts did not make us an exemplary crew, but I would place us as about average for the 10 months we were in a combat zone, starting in late June 1944. There were some crews that came through the war totally unscathed, while others made the supreme sacrifice. It was unique that, during our 10 months overseas and through the course of 35 missions we, flying as a crew, or separately, flew many of our missions in a variety of B-24 aircraft of the 451 st. This was due to our pilot being elevated to Squadron Operations Officer, and mostly flying with other pilots in lead positions. We, the rest of the crew, were relegated to fl ying as Isparesi with other crews. Early on, the original crews flew most of their missions in the same aircraft they brought overseas. But it was most uncommon for the later crews to have flown all your missions in one-only aircraft. If lyouri aircraft6the one you may have named or felt most attached t06was down for repair and the next mission called for 6\n\nImaximum effortS you flew whatever was available. Thus, many of the 724th Bomb Squadron aircraft listed in this book were familiar to me. Sometimes, if you were flying HeadS it may be that your aircraft came from one of the other Squadrons (e.g., Radar (Mickey) Ship, or one with a newer version Bombsight). I cannot conclude this foreword without putting in something about the B-24, and some of the hardships that the crewmen endured. One, seldom mentioned, was the cold. Flying between 20,000 and 25,000 feet altitude the temperature could reach between 40 to 60 degrees below zero. Protected only by an electrically heated suit Uacket, trousers, gloves, and boots), it was sometimes difficult to keep warm, especially in the waist section with open waist windows. In case of a malfunction with gun or equipment, you wore a pair of silk gloves, so when the heated outer gloves were removed you didn't become attached/frozen to any metal. Turrets could be uncomfortable because of close confinement, plus lack of motion that could help in circulating the blood in the lower extremities. Oxygen masks were worn above 10,000 feet, and there were times when they froze, causing much distress by the wearer. Flak Vests were considered mandatory in combat, as were the parachutes. The crewman was responsible for his own parachute, but the Engineer was accountable for the flak vests being on board prior to take-off. The flak vests were flexible two piece (front and back), supposedly bullet and shrapnel proof protectors. At altitude it usually required yourself and someone else to put on prior to going over the target. In emergency it only took a tug of a short lanyard to rid yourself of them. Parachutes came in a variety oftypes. There were IseatSlbackS and lchest chutesj Most common among the gunners was the chest chute. These were not worn until an emergency arose, and were placed in a position, withjn the aircraft, that was easily accessible when, and if, that emergency should happen. While the seat and back chutes were ready at all times, the chest chute had to be attached by way of metal snaps that were on the harness. This fact caused some concern, in the way that it could not be worn beneath the flak vest. Another factor was that if the aircraft suffered severe turbulence, either by flak damage or evasive action, you may be\n\n~~~~~~~~~~-------,-I-\n\nForeword spending precious moments trying to relocate your chute where you left it. There was another hazard faced by a crewman while on a mission. That was to see your wingman or buddy falling out of formation, and trying to follow what was happening to the aircraft. Maybe they would make it home, or maybe you would see them bailout, or worse yet6explode. Of course, this wasn't a physical hazard, but rather an emotional one.\n\nIt seems that history and research sometimes go hand in hand. When history is made, and allowed to become faded with time, then research comes into play to bring it back into focus. Thus will be the purpose of this book. The 49th Wing of the 15th Army Air Force was once a mighty military force that the Allies had, and used effectively, to defeat the Nazis in WW II. And our weapon was the B-24 Liberator bomber. To the veteran and researcher alike, this book will be a great tool in bringing sharper focus to that part of history and to WW II. Former S/Sgt Robert Karstensen (Gunner), 15th AAF, 49th Bombardment Wing, 451st Bomb Group, 724th Bomb Squadron.\n\n7\n\nIntroduction\n\nSitting on the ground the B-24 Liberator appeared to be a designerfs nightmare. She had long thin tapered wings attached to a slab sided fuselage. The wings did not look like they would support the weight in-flight, and the fuselage cried out for garish nose art adornment. Add to this two oval rudders, and one would think that she wouldnft get off the ground. But get off the ground she did! Once she was in the air, the long wings flexed upward to support the aircraft, and she assumed a grace all her own. Built in more numbers than any other American bomber of World War II, the Liberator was the most advanced heavy bomber until surpassed by the B-29 Superfortress. She was overshadowed by the B-17 Flying Fortress through no fault of her own. It was merely a matter of public relations. Used by the 8th Air Force, she was saddled with a bad reputation based on losses sustained during operations against Hitlerfs Germany. This reputation was in large part based on the fact that the 8th Air Force was primarily a B-17 Air Force. In most cases the Liberator units were forced to fly missions behind the B-17 units. Since the B-24 had a higher airspeed they would have to hold back in order to stay with the formations. This placed the Liberator at a severe operational disadvantage. The 15th Air Force was made up of 21 heavy bomber groups, of which 15 groups were equipped with the B-24 Liberator. In this area of operations the B-24 was not hindered by the performance differences between the B-17 and the Liberator. In most cases the missions were planned and assigned to the groups to optimize the capabilities of each bomber type. There has always been the great Ibomber debatei as to which aircraft was better, the B-17 or the B-24. It is not our purpose to enter into this abyss, as there is no concrete answer. If one looks strictly at the performance envelope of the aircraft the B-24 would come out as the better of the two. We must remember that each of these great aircraft had certain differences in construction, armament, and flight characteristics that would give them the advantage\n\n8\n\nunder different circumstances. It is only the authorsf place to say that if either of these planes brought you back from the flak filled skies of Europe, then she was Ithe besti When the idea for this project was put forth, I could think of no one to bring onboard other than John lBobiBeitling. He is no stranger to B-24 researchers. He has spent over 20 years researching the B24 Liberator. Bobfs interest in the B-24 is natural; he flew as a crew member on the Liberator with the 389th Bomb Group in England during the war. Bob has helped me on several other projects dealing with the B-24, and I am proud and happy to have him as my copilot on this one. My interest in the Liberator comes from the fact that my dad served with the 451st Bomb Group, 15th Air Force during the war. As a boy, I loved looking at his fading photos from that time. As a result I became a Iplane personS and my interest in the Liberator has never faded. So much has been written about the aircraft of World War II. In many cases, a certain aircraft is mentioned in these writings regarding the fact that it was lost on a certain date, or that it carried a certain name. Bob and I have used a different format. Our idea is to concentrate on the aircraft itself and give a biographical history of the individual aircraft. With that in mind, we are presenting as much information as possible about these historic Liberators. We have tried to include such things as her nickname and how she was named, mission history, and her eventual fate. We have also tried to include any interesting incidents that she was involved in. We hope that this different approach will serve as an important addition to the historical documentation of what not only the crews, but these aircraft, did for our countriefs history. We have made every attempt to insure that the material that we present is as accurate as possible. We admit that with the passage of time, as well as the problems with record keeping of that time, add to some of the dilemmas presented in historical research. With that in mind, Bob and I hope that you enjoy our work and find it interesting.\n\nHistory of the 49 th Bomb Wing\n\nConstituted as the 49th Bombardment Operational Training Wing (medium) on March 17, 1943, it was activated on March 31, 1943, at Columbia Army Air Base, Columbia, South Carolina. The Wing was transferred to Greenville, South Carolina, in April 1943, and remained there until February 1944. The primary mission was training of aircrews for service overseas. In April 1944 the 49th Bomb Wing was reassigned to the 15th Air Force operating in Italy. The Wing was transferred without aircraft to Italy. After being assigned to the 15th Air Force, the 451st Bomb Group was transferred from the 47th Wing, and the 461 st was transferred from the 55th Wing. The newly arrived 484th Bomb Group was assigned as the last group in the wing. Most wings were composed of four Bomb Groups. Since the 49th was the last Wing us-\n\ning the B-246assigned to the 15th6they were unique in the fact that the wing was comprised of only three Bomb Groups. The groups assigned to the Wing were the 451st, 461st, and 484th Bomb Groups. The 49th Wing under the command of Brig/General William Lee moved into their headquarters near Foggia, Italy, and conducted Wing Operations for the duration of World War II. The 49th Bomb Wing was inactivated in Italy on October 16, 1945. It was later redesignated as the 49th Bombard Wing (Very Heavy) and transferred to the reserve. Activated again on December 26,1946, it had a short period of service until being deactivated again on June 27, 1949. One November 7, 1951, it was redesignated as the 49th Air Division and assigned to the Tactical Air Command. In April 1952 it was transferred to England as part of the United States Air Force in Europe.\n\n9\n\n1 451 8t Bomb Group\n\nHistory of the 451st Bomb Group The 451stBomb Group was activated under provisions of General Order # 5, paragraph 1 at Davis Monthan Field, Tucson, Arizona, on April 22, 1943. This order activated the group with four squadrons, the 724th, 725th, 726th, and 727th. The group would be under the command of Colonel Robert E.L. Eaton. The group was transferred to Wendover Field, Utah, to begin training for combat. The major problem with Wendover was that there were several groups stationed there, and it was overcrowded. In September 1943 the group was transferred to Fairmont Field, Nebraska. Located about 75 miles southwest of Lincoln, the group would remain there and complete their stateside training. Orders were cut in November proclaiming the group ready for movement to their combat area. The aircrews began the flight to Italy in November 1943, while the ground echelon boarded trains for the East coast and their long boat ride across the Atlantic. The ground echelon was reunited on January 2, 1944, at their first operational base at Gioia del Colle, Italy. On January 20, 1944, the air echelon arrived, and preparations were begun for the groupfs first mission. On arrival the 451st Bomb Group had been assigned to the 47th Bomb Wing. This wing was made up ofthe 98th, 376th, 449th, and 450th Bomb Groups. With the addition of the 451st, the 47th wing had five bomb groups assigned to it. The 451 st flew its first combat mission on January 30, 1944. Their target was the Radar Station at Fier, Albania. Like all groups on their first mission, it was fouled up from the beginning. By March 1944 the base at Gioia del Colle was deemed unfit for combat operations due to mud and water. The group was split into two parts. The 724th and 726th Bomb Squadrons were transferred to San Pancrazio. The 725th and 727th were sent to Manduria. The group would operate from the two different bases until their new base was operational.\n\n10\n\nOn April 6, 1944, the 451st began its movement to their new base at Castelluccia, Italy. With this movement also came the transfer to the newly activated 49th Bomb Wing. The 451st continued to fly combat missions from their new base during the summer of 1944. They racked up missions to Ploesti, Vienna, and other targets in the Third Reich. Like other groups in the 15th Air Force, the 451st was taking losses and getting replacements. August saw the group flying a devastating mission to Markersdorf, Austria. For this mission the group was awarded an unprecedented third Distinguished Unit Citation. During the fall and winter of 1944-1945, the 451st continued to fly when the weather permitted. While the German Luftwaffe had been subdued, flak was always a threat. On April 26, 1945, the 451st flew their 245th mission since arriving in Italy. It was to be the last mission flown by the group in World War II. Shortly victory in Europe was proclaimed, and the men of the 451st began looking forward to returning to the United States. During combat service in Italy the 451st was awarded three Distinguished Unit Citations. The first was awarded for the mission to Regansburg, Germany, on February 25, 1944. The second was awarded for the AprilS, 1944, mission to Ploesti, Rumania. The final DUC was awarded for the August 23, 1944, mission to Markersdorf, Austria. It is noted that no other group was awarded three Unit Citations while in service with the 15th Air Force. During the history of the 451st in World War II there were three commanding officers. Colonel Robert E.L. Eaton was the first commander, serving from activation until he completed 50 missions. Colonel James B Knapp took command of the group on September 19, 1944, and commanded until December when he gave command to Colonel Leroy Stefonowicz (Stefon), who commanded the group until the end of the war. The 451 st was reactivated for a brief time as a Stategic Missile Wing, and stood nuclear alert with the Strategic Air Command until being deactivated.\n\n451 st Bomb Group Aircraft and Markings The original Liberators of the 451st were all B-24H models. The aircraft arrived in the olive drab and neutral gray factory finish. As replacements arrived the group soon owned a variety of different B-24 models. On arrival in Italy the group was assigned to the 47th Bomb Wing. At this time the 47th Wingfs tail markings were a white circle with a triangle painted within. These markings were painted on the vertical stabilizer. The 451 st was the fifth group in the wing, and had a white circle with the number 5 painted on the lower half of the vertical stabilizer. On transfer to the new 49th Bomb Wing the markings changed. A white circle with a red hexagon was painted on the upper stabilizer. A white circle with a red number one was painted on the lower half. To help quickly identify the group the middle part of the rudder was painted white. These markings were shortly changed to the evolving 49th tail markings. This consisted of the upper half of the vertical stabilizer being painted red. The group marking for the 451st was a large red circle painted on the lower half of the vertical stabilizer. The horizontal stabilizer was also painted in the basic style at first, with later markings showing the entire unit being painted red.\n\nAs with the groups of the 15th Air Force, each aircraft was assigned an identification insignia. The 451 st painted large numbers on the sides of the forward and rear fuselage. These numbers have been called Ibattle numbers,! or Iplane in groupi number. Recent research has shown that in most cases these numbers also corresponded to the revetment number that the aircraft had been assigned. The size of these numbers varied somewhat from group to group. To help identify the aircraftfs squadron these were usually painted in squadron colors. The 724th used a large black rectangle with white numbers, while the 725th used red for their background, and the 726th used green for their background. The 727th squadron color was yellow, so aircraft of this squadron sported a yellow rectangle with red numbers to identify their aircraft. As time past, many of the groupfs aircraft also had their cowling rings painted in squadron colors. Several even went so far as to paint the propeller hubs in squadron colors. Most of the original aircraft can'ied some type of nose art or name painted on the side of the aircraft. Nose art was very common, and vlliied depending on the crews and groundcrews that were assigned to the aircraft.\n\nLiberators of the 451st Bomb Group 41-23733 SKIPPER-THE TUNERVILLE TROLLEY This was the only known B-24D to serve with the 451st while overseas.
