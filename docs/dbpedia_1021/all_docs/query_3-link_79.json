For example jackets at Rock Island Auctions sold in 2022 for $32,000+ and $23,000+; respectively they can be found at this link and this link. When comparing the Rock Island Auction jackets with the one offered here, one can easily see that our offering is an exceptional value!\n\nOriginal Item: One-of-a-Kind. This is an absolutely beautiful World War Two American painted A-2 flight jacket, named to Lt. Walter Kilimnik. In researching Lieutenant Kilimnik, what we were able to uncover is that he served with the 454th Bombardment Group, 736th Bomb Squadron of the 15th Air Force and served on the B-24 named Birthday Gift.\n\nThe A-2 jacket, which is in good condition with fantastic hand painted artwork. The reverse side of the jacket has an exceptional painted image of a pin up girl wearing a large sun hat above the 3D text BIRTHDAY GIFT. The only markings on the front is the leather name tag that reads as W. KILIMNIK.\n\nJacket is in size US 40 and has retained all original components including original knit waist band and sleeve cuffs, something we often see replaced on A-2 jackets that saw extensive service. Also original is the TALON brand zipper which is functional. Both epaulets have a painted Lieutenant bar.\n\nThe interior lining does have tearing and stitching loss present, so do handle it with care. The top rear back portion of the liner still retains the original tag which reads as:\n\nTYPE A2\n\nDWG. NO. 30-1415\n\nORDER NO. 42-18245-P\n\nSTAR SPORTSWEAR MFG. CO.\n\nPROPERTY\n\nAIR FORCE, U.S. ARMY\n\n40\n\nThis is an incredible example of a hard to find painted A-2 jacket, offered in wonderful condition. Comes more than ready for further research and display.\n\nApproximate Size: 40\n\nThe squadron was first organized at Alamogordo Army Air Field, New Mexico on 1 June 1943 as one of the four squadrons of the 454th Bombardment Group. It trained with Consolidated B-24 Liberator bombers. After completing training, it left for the Mediterranean Theater of Operations on 8 December 1943.\n\nThe 736th Bomb Squadron arrived in Italy in January 1944, settling in at its combat station, San Giovanni Airfield, by the end of the month. Its primary focus was on long range bombing missions against industrial targets such as enemy oil refineries and munitions and aircraft factories. It struck transportation targets including harbors and airfields in Italy, France, Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Greece and Rumania The squadron received a Distinguished Unit Citation (DUC) for a raid on an airfield at Bad Vöslau, Austria on 12 April 1944. The squadron earned a second DUC during an attack on a steel plant at Linz, Austria, as the 454th Group led its wing through determined opposition.\n\nThe squadron also flew air support and air interdiction missions against marshalling yards, troop concentrations and rail lines for Operation Strangle, the effort to cut German supply lines in Italy north of Rome between March and May 1944. The squadron participated in the drive to Rome; Operation Dragoon, the invasion of southern France; and Operation Grapeshot, the Spring 1945 offensive in Northern Italy.\n\nThe squadron left Italy in July 1945 and reformed at Sioux Falls Army Air Field, South Dakota the following month. It was redesignated as a very heavy bombardment squadron in anticipation of training and redeployment to the Pacific, but with the Japanese surrender, it was inactivated in October."
