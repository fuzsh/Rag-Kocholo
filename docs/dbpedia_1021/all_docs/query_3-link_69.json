On the basis of the growth of global passenger movement from 2.9 to 6 billion in the last year, ICAO forecasted that the movement of Air Traffic will be doubled by the year 2030.Bangladesh is a developing country with a population of 155 million and GDP growth of 6 %. As a growing economic country Bangladesh will face the increased demand. While the aggregate global growth in passenger carrier is about 6% in the past few years, Bangladesh has registered an average 8% growth in the last 3 years. It is expected that an increase in passenger volume from 5.8 to 10.2 million and increase in air cargo from 2, 30,000 to 3, 60,000 metric tons will take place by 2020 in Bangladesh. Thus congestion at airport runways, passenger and cargo terminals, and ground transport facilities is expected to increase, as will demand for additional and improved airport systems. Global Market Forecast anticipates that wide body jetliners such as Airbus A330 and very large A380,Boeing 777 series will grow in significant number in the next decades. The average size of aircraft has grown by approximately 25 percent worldwide in the past 20 years, and this trend will continue because of air traffic growth and the constraints on aircraft movements – particularly at airports. To meet the growing traffic demand at present Biman Bangladesh has included several modern aircrafts in the fleet such as, Boeing 777-300ER, Airbus A310-300, Boeing 737-700, Airbus A310-300 and Bombardier Dash 8-100 etc. Recently ten new aircrafts are going to be added in the fleet which includes two B777-300ER, four B787 Dreamliner and two B737-800. The current design aircraft according to ICAO is of category E. Similarly with the increasing volume of passengers and goods movement, airlines are introducing wide bodied, long haul and new generation aircrafts. In Bangladesh at present the aviation activities are carried out from three international and five domestic airports. The length of runways in three international airports Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport (HSIA), Shah Amanat International Airport (SAIA) and Osmani International Airport (OIA) was found 3200m, 2940m, 2591m respectively. The width of runways of HSIA, SAIA and OIS was Air travel has been described as the defining mode of transportation of the twentieth century.
