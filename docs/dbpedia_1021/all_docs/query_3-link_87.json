Reprint. Originally published: Washington, D.C. : U.S. Govt. Print. Off., 1961. Includes index. Supt. of Docs. No.: D 301.2:C73/3/983 1. United 'States. Army Air Forces — History. 2. World War, 1939-1945— Aerial operations, American. I. Maurer, Maurer. D790.A533 1983 940.54*4973 83-600169 ISBN 0-912799-02-1 For sale by the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office Washington, D.C. Foreword Like all chronologies, bibliographies, and encyclopedias, Air Force Combat Units of World War II serves a very special historical function. It traces the lineage of each Army Air Corps and U.S. Air Force combat group or higher organization active in World War II, from its origins to 1956. It is a concise official record of those units: their assignments, subordinate organizations, stations, commanders, campaigns, aircraft, and decorations. But it is more than that. As an important source of ready information, this volume not only serves as a reference tool for historians and researchers; but it also provides commanders with a corporate memory of vital statistics. With these facts, a unit documents its heritage, the basis for unit esprit de corps. Originally this volume had been printed in 1961. Its worth has been proven, and the demand for it has been great. With this reprint, it will continue to serve the United States Air Force in all quarters in years to come. Richard H.

Shannon (Chairman) Retired University of Virginia National Aeronautics and Space Administration tv Preface Purpose. Over a period of several years the USAF Historical Division has received hundreds of requests for brief histories of Air Force organizations. Air Force units ask for historical data they can use for the orientation of new personnel and for building morale and esprit de corps. USAF Headquarters and the commands need historical data for organizational planning. Information offi- cers throughout the Air Force want historical materials for public relations purposes. Members and former members of the Air Force are interested in the units with which they have served. Govern- ment agencies and private individuals, for various reasons, seek information about Air Force units and their histories. As a result of the great demand for and the interest in such histories, it appeared that a book containing brief sketches of Air Force combat organi- zations would be of value as a reference work. The task of pre- paring such a volume was undertaken by the USAF Historical Division as a phase of its work on World War II. Scope. This book is concerned primarily with the combat (or tactical) groups that were active during the Second World War. Although such groups had numerous designations, nearly all fell within four major categories: bombardment, fighter, reconnaissance, and troop carrier. The book covers both the combat groups that served overseas and those that remained in the United States. It also covers combat organizations above the group level. It does not deal with provisional organizations or with air base, mainte- nance, supply, medical, transport, and other service or support organizations. Although this book is devoted exclusively to organizations that were active during World War II, its coverage of those organiza- tions is not confined to the World War II period. Instead, each organization is traced back to its origin and forward to i January 1956, with later activations being mentioned if they took place prior to the time the draft of the book was prepared in 1957-1958. The organizations are presented under the designations they carried on 2 September 1945. For each organization there is information concerning insigne, lineage, operations, assignments, aircraft (for groups only), components, stations, commanders, cam- paigns, and decorations. A guide to the way these materials are treated is provided in the Explanatory Notes that follow this Preface. Revision. It is impossible to handle the vast amount of detailed data used in the preparation of a work of this kind without spme errors appearing in the published volume. A considerable portion of the material in this book represents judgments that historians made in their efforts to determine facts from conflicting data found in various sources. Because of the nature of the volume, there was little opportunity to employ the qualifying words and phrases that historians normally use to indicate weaknesses in their sources or suggest the possibility of other interpretations of available data. Like any historical work, this book is subject to revision in the light of evidence that may be discovered or may become available in the future. Sources. Most of the sources used in the preparation of this volume are found in the archives of the USAF Historical Division. The most important of these are histories that Air Force organiza- tions at all echelons have forwarded periodically to the archives in accordance with directives pertaining to the Air Force historical program. These histories consist of narratives, plus supporting documents, such as plans, orders, directives, operational reports, organizational charts, statistical summaries, and correspondence. The narratives and documents for many organizations are excellent. Unfortunately, the coverage for some organizations is inadequate and in some cases is lacking for considerable periods of time. Cover- age is especially thin, or absent, for the years before 1943, the date the historical program became operative, and for the period im- mediately following World War II, when the program was dis- rupted by demobilization and by numerous changes in Air Force organization. Lower echelons of some commands, as well as reserve and national guard organizations not in active service, have not forwarded narratives and documents to the archives. Other important sources were papers of the Air Service, the Air Corps, and the Air Staff of Army Air Forces; numbered letters of the War Department and the Department of the Air Force; general and special orders; reports and staff studies; statistical digests; or- ganizational directories; personnel rosters; and station lists. Monographs prepared by the USAF Historical Division and by the historical offices of the various commands were very useful. Another secondary source of great value was the USAF Historical Division’s seven-volume history, The Army Air Forces in World War II, edited by W. F. Craven and J. L. Cate, and published by the University of Chicago Press. Acknowledgments. This volume is, in a large measure, the work of Miss Mary Frances Morgan (M.A., University of Georgia), Miss Merlin Elaine Owen (M.A., Tulane University), Mr. Sam H. Frank (M.A., Florida State University), Mr. Herman A. Higgins (M.A., Peabody College), Mr. Richard C. Lukas (B.A., Florida State University), and Mr. Wesley P. Newton, Jr. (M.A., Uni- versity of Alabama). These young graduate students, who joined the USAF Historical Division in the summer of 1957, were well qualified for the task of conducting the research and preparing the draft of the book. Each had excellent training in history and his- torical methodology. Each proved to be a first-class researcher. But these historians brought more than technical competence to their job. They had enthusiasm for their work, a vast store of good humor, and the personal qualities that enable people to work together in the finest spirit of cooperation. When this team broke up in the summer of 1958, Miss Morgan and Mr. Newton stayed on for another year to finish the draft and assist with the editing. Many other persons contributed to the production of this volume. Miss Marguerite Kennedy and her staff in the archives of the USAF Historical Division provided numerous services that expedited the vii research. Mr. David Schoem of the Air University Historical Liaison Office in Washington assisted with many administrative matters. Mr. Gordon W. Benson and members of his staff furnished copies of the unit history cards maintained by the Organization Branch, Directorate of Statistical Services, Headquarters USAF. Miss Eleanor Cox, Chief of the Heraldic Section, Directorate of Military Personnel, Headquarters USAF, assisted by Miss Anna D. Osso of the Heraldic Section, supplied the insignia and their de- scriptions. Dr. Chauncey E. Sanders, Mr. Robert T. Finney, Dr. Wilson Howell, Dr. Edith C. Rodgers, Major Ruth P. Boehner, Lieutenant James D. Secor, Lieutenant Eugene Pascuzzi, and other members or former members of the USAF Historical Division who at various times were associated with the Division’s unit history program, prepared many unit histories that supplied valuable data for this volume. Mrs. Lois L. Lynn maintained the voluminous files required for the project and typed the various drafts of the book. Although this brief note can not name all the persons who assisted in one way or another, it should mention two men whose interest and support were vital to the project: Col. G. C. Cobb, Director of Research Studies Institute during the time the book was being written; and Dr. Albert F. Simpson, Chief, USAF Historical Division. / 5 September 1959 viii Explanatory Notes These notes, which are designed as an aid to the use of this vol- ume, are keyed to the various kinds of information presented in the historical sketches of the combat organizations. Heading. The heading gives the numerical and general func- tional designation of the organization at the end of World War II. lnsigne. The insigne is the last one approved prior to the end of World War II if such an insigne was available. If the organization had no insigne at that time but had one approved after the war, the latter is shown. A regulation issued in 1953 required each combat group to use the insigne of the combat wing of the same number; consequently, in this book wing insignia are given for some groups. Lineage. The lineage, which was traced through official docu- ments, is presented in a narrative that also covers the major activities of the organization. Organizational actions (e.g., activation, re- designation, etc.) relating to lineage are highlighted by means of italics. Minor redesignations (e.g., a change from Bombardment Group, H to Bombardment Group, Heavy), as well as organiza- tional changes that had no effect on lineage, were omitted. The terms used to describe actions that establish the lineage of Air Force organizations are defined in Appendix I : Organizational Terms. Operations. The narrative for each group gives a brief summary of the organization’s major activities, especially its combat opera- tions. A general statement concerning major functions or area of operations is provided for organizations above the group level. Assignments. The narrative includes information concerning the organization’s assignments, or its attachments for operational control. For World War II, this information is generally restricted to the numbered air forces with which the organization operated; for the post-World War II period, it is usually confined to the major command. Because of peculiarities and changes in the Air Force structure between 1946 and 1950, assignments to Air Defense, Tactical Air, and Continental Air Command during that time are, as a gen- eral rule, not shown. In references to Air National Guard (ANG) organizations, names of states, shown as abbreviations in paren- theses, indicate allotments of headquarters. Aircraft. The narrative for each group supplies information concerning the aircraft used by the organization. Organizational Components. The major combat elements are listed immediately following the narrative. The list shows only the components at the first subordinate echelon in any particular period. Components were omitted in some cases in which the structure of the subject organization changed frequently and the assignments of components usually were of brief duration. Attached components, as well as service and support elements, were omitted. Components of national guard organizations are given only for those periods in which the guard organizations were on extended active service. Only numerical designations are shown if the functional desig- nations (e.g., fighter, bomber) of the components and subject organ- ization were similar. For components assigned during World War II, the numerical designation shown is the one in use at the end of the war. If the numerical designation of a component changed during the period of assignment to the subject organization, the former or later designation is supplied in parentheses. A semicolon separating dates indicates that the subject organ- ization was inactivated. A comma indicates that the component was relieved of assignment and later reassigned during a period in which the subject organization remained active. Stations. The list of stations shows the locations and move- ments of the organization. Temporary stations are not listed. The name given for each base is the one in use at the time the organization arrived. Webster's Geographical Dictionary was used as the pri- mary authority for the spelling of place names. For places not listed there, the NIS Gazetteers were used. For places not given in either of those sources, it was necessary to rely on station lists and other Air Force documents. Geographical place names, rather than base names, are generally shown for stations overseas. If the organization moved frequently, as some organizations did in the Mediterranean and Pacific areas during World War II, countries, rather than specific places, are shown. Stations for national guard organizations are given only for those periods in which the guard organizations were on extended active service. A single date indicates the arrival of the organization’s head- quarters or, if that could not be determined, the arrival of the first major element of the organization. Where double dates are given, the second date, if followed by a semicolon, shows when the organ- ization (or the first major element) began an extended movement either overseas or within a theater; if followed by a period, the second date indicates that the organization was inactivated. Commanders. The list of commanders gives the names of the organization’s commanding officers, the highest rank held by each during the period of command, and the date each assumed command. As a general rule, temporary or acting commanders are not shown. Because of difficulties encountered in obtaining data concerning com- manders of reserve and national guard organizations, commanders of such organizations are shown only for those periods the organiza- tions were on extended active service. Where double dates are shown, the second date, if followed by a period, indicates that the organization was inactivated; if followed by a semicolon, the second date indicates that there is, or may be, a gap in the list of commanders. Campaigns. The campaigns listed are those in which the or- ganization participated, the determination in each instance being based upon a careful analysis of the organization’s operations. If the listing shows Asiatic-Pacific Theater or European-African-Mid- dle Eastern Theater, the organization served, but was not engaged in combat, in the theater. If the listing includes American Theater, the organization either served in the theater area outside the United States, or was stationed in the United States for a total time of one year or more. The theater is not shown if any campaign in the theater is listed. When some components of the organization were engaged in activities that could not be attributed to the entire organization, those activities are not covered by the list of the organ- ization’s campaigns. For example, if a squadron on detached serv- ice from a group in the European-African-Middle Eastern Theater served in combat in the Asiatic-Pacific Theater, the campaigns listed for the group do not include the Asiatic-Pacific campaigns in which the squadron participated. A list of all the campaigns in which Air Force organizations have participated is provided in Appendix II: Theaters and Campaigns. It should be emphasized that the listings in this book are for groups, wings, divisions, commands, and air forces rather than for the headquarters of these organizations or for the squadrons. Conse- quently, units are cautioned not to use the listings in this volume as the basis or authority for claiming or displaying service streamers. The Awards Branch, Personnel Services Division, Directorate of Military Personnel, Headquarters USAF is responsible for determin- ing what service streamers each unit is entitled to display. Decorations. Under decorations are listed the citations and other awards made to the organization. In cases where citations were found to be suitable for such treatment, they are mentioned in the narrative in connection with operations (as well as listed under “Decorations”) in order to provide additional data about the activities covered by the citations. In many instances dates for citations have been omitted or have been revised and set in brackets because the dates given in orders pertaining to the citations are obviously incor- rect. For example, the dates given in an order may extend over a period before or after the organization was engaged in the activity for which it was cited. Information concerning the various citations and other awards that have been bestowed on organizational ele- ments of the Air Force is provided in Appendix III: Decorations. As in the case of the campaigns, the listings in this volume are not to be used by units as the basis or authority for claiming or dis- playing streamers and other devices that represent awards. The Awards Branch determines the awards to which each unit is entitled. xu Contents Page FOREWORD Hi PREFACE v EXPLANATORY NOTES ix INTRODUCTION 1 Air Force Combat Organization 1 Commanders 14 AIR FORCE COMBAT UNITS Groups 19 Wings 373 Divisions 431 Commands 437 Air Forces 457 APPENDIXES I.

There were pilots, navigators, bombardiers, gunners, and radio operators, clerks and typists, artists and flautists, teachers, mechanics, statisticians, and engineers — for it took many talents and skills to conduct and support the war in the air. All these persons, from privates to generals, had to be welded into an organization capable of giving direction and coordination to their diverse activ- ities. For combat the men were formed into squadrons, and squad- rons into groups. Above the groups were wings, and wings were organized into commands, and commands into the 16 air forces of the AAF. The upper part of the structure had to be built while the war was on, but the foundation was old. Some of the squadrons, two of the groups, and one wing had combat records from the First World War. One squadron, the oldest in the Air Force, could trace its history back to 1913. 79/3-79/7 The Army had established an Aeronautical Division in the Signal Corps on 1 August 1907 and had acquired its first plane in 1909. Army men had learned to fly, but for some time the aviators were not organized into units for operations. Consequently in 1913, when relations between the United States and Mexico were strained as a result of a revolution in Mexico, there was no aviation unit for service along the Mexican border. The Army, however, sent some of its flyers and planes to Texas, and on 5 March 1913 these were formed into the 1st Aero Squadron, a provisional organization made up of two companies. Later that year, in December, after the provisional 1 AIR FORCE COMBAT UNITS OF WORLD WAR II unit had moved to San Diego for training, it was organized officially as an Army squadron. Following Pancho Villa’s raid on Columbus, New Mexico, in March 1916, the squadron joined the force that Brig. Gen. John J. Pershing organized to try to capture the Mexican bandit. Thus the 1st Aero Squadron, which provided communica- tion and reconnaissance services during the Mexican expedition, was the first American aviation unit to take the field for a military campaign. Meanwhile, although war had broken out in Europe, little progress had been made toward expanding the Army’s air arm. Congress created an Aviation Section in the Signal Corps by an act approved on 18 July 1914, but the legislators provided little money for the new service. Moreover, the Signal Corps naturally used the meager resources to develop aviation as a means of communication, observation, and reconnaissance, rather than as an instrument for combat. One company of the 2d Aero Squadron was organized in 1915 and sent to the Philippines. The following year plans were made for five more squadrons. One, the 7th, was formed in February 1917 for duty in the Panama Canal Zone. Another, the 6th, was organized in Hawaii in March 1917. Three others, the 3d, 4th, and 5th, were being formed in the United States at the time the nation entered World War I in April 1917. World War I Pershing, who became commander of the American Expedition- ary Forces (AEF) soon developed a plan for the deployment of 260 combat squadrons to France. Later the plan was revised with the number of squadrons reduced to 202, all of which were to be at the front by 30 June 1919. In Pershing’s view, the main functions of the AEF’s Air Service were to drive off hostile aircraft and to obtain in- formation about enemy movements. Half of the 202 squadrons, therefore, were to be observation units assigned to 3 armies and 16 corps. Of the remainder, 60 were to be pursuit squadrons. But the plan also provided for 27 night-bombardment and 14 day-bombard- ment squadrons. The first American aviation unit to reach France was the 1st Aero Squadron, an observation organization, which sailed from New INTRODUCTION York in August 1917 and arrived at Le Havre on 3 September. As other squadrons were organized at home, they too were sent overseas, where they continued their training. It was February 19x8 before any American aviation squadron entered combat, but by Armistice Day, 11 November 1918, 45 combat squadrons (20 pursuit, 18 obser- vation, and 7 bombardment) had been assigned to the front. During the war the aero squadrons played important roles in such famous battles as the Aisne-Marne, St. Mihiel, and the Meuse-Argonne. Some, like the 94th Squadron that had Captain Eddie Rickenbacker for its commander, or the 27th that had “balloon buster” Franjc Luke as one of its aviators, made distinguished records in combat. Observation planes frequently operated individually, and pur- suit pilots often went out alone to attack a balloon or to meet the enemy in a dogfight. But the tendency was toward formation flying for pursuit as well as for bombardment operations. The dispersal of squadrons among the various army organizations made it difficult, however, to obtain coordination of aerial activities. Some higher organization was required. Squadrons with similar functions were formed into groups, the first of these being the 1st Corps Observa- tion Group, organized in April 1918. The following month the 1st Pursuit Group was formed, and by 11 November 1918 the AEF had 14 groups (7 observation, 5 pursuit, and 2 bombardment). In July 1918 the AEF organized its first wing, made up of the 2d and 3d Pur- suit Groups and, later, the 1st Day Bombardment Group. Some airmen, including William Mitchell, were advocating the formation of an air force that would concentrate control over mili- tary aviation for heavy blows against the enemy. In September 1918, for the Allied assault against the German salient at St. Mihiel, Mitchell brought together almost 1,500 American and French planes for coordinated operations in which observation and pursuit sup- ported ground forces, while the other two-thirds of the air force bombed and strafed behind the lines. Later, during the Meuse- Argonne offensive, Mitchell attained a somewhat smaller concentra- tion of air power for use in keeping the enemy on the defensive. In France the Air Service was part of Pershing’s expeditionary force. In the United States the Chief Signal Officer was responsible for organizing, training, and equipping aviation units until 21 May AIR FORCE COMBAT UNITS OF WORLD WAR II 1918. At that time the President created a Bureau of Aircraft Produc- tion and made it responsible for aeronautical equipment; training of personnel and units was the responsibility of the Division of Military Aeronautics, which had been created by the War Department on 27 April 1918. Although the bureau and division were recognized by the War Department on 24 May 1918 as forming the Army’s Air Service, no Director of Air Service was appointed until 27 August 1918. 79/9-/939 After the war the Army quickly demobilized most of its air arm, including the wing, all of the groups, and most of the squadrons. Almost immediately, however, it began to create new organizations for peacetime service. In many instances these new organizations had no connection with those that had been active during the war. For example, at Selfridge Field in August 1919 the Army organized a 1st Pursuit Group that was in no way related to the AEF’s 1st Pursuit Group, which had been demobilized in France in December 19x8. A little later, however, the Army began a series of organiza- tional actions that eventually enabled many active organizations to trace their histories back to World War I. In the case of the 1st Pursuit Group, for instance, the Army reconstituted the World War I group of that name and consolidated it with the active group. This process of reconstituting old units and consolidating them with active units has continued up to the present time. In 1920 an act of Congress (approved on 4 June) created the Air Service as a combatant arm of the United States Army. But the Air Service and the Air Corps that replaced it in 1926 (act of 2 July) did not control the combat units, for their training and operations came under the jurisdiction of ground forces. With this arrangement the Air Service and Air Corps were responsible for matters relating to personnel and materiel logistics, particularly training individual pilots and other specialists, and developing, procuring, storing, and distributing aeronautical equipment. The composition, organization, and command of the combat elements of the air arm during the i92o’s and early 1930’s were based on principles laid down by the War Department General Staff in 1920. These principles, as they related to military aviation, were INTRODUCTION reflected in a war plan that called for the following aviation organiza- tions as part of an expeditionary force: one observation squadron for each of 54 divisions and one for each of 18 corps; one observation group (four squadrons), plus one attack wing (one attack and two pursuit groups), for each of 6 armies; one attack wing, one observa- tion group, and one bombardment group for General Headquarters (GHQ). Thus the war plan placed the greatest emphasis on ob- servation aviation. It gave lesser roles to pursuit aviation, which was to destroy enemy planes and assist in attacking enemy troops and other objectives, and to attack aviation, which was to harass the enemy’s ground forces. It assigned a minor place to bombardment aviation, with the mission of destroying military objectives in the combat theater and in the enemy’s zone of interior. Furthermore, it placed aviation under the command of ground officers at division, corps, army, and GHQ levels. As a result, the structure was con- demned by Billy Mitchell and other Air Service officers who dis- counted the importance of observation aviation, sought recognition for bombardment as a major instrument of warfare, desired a greater proportion of pursuit units for counter-air operations, and wanted aviation units organized as an air force under the command of air- men. One of the important facets of the history of the Army’s air arm during the 1920’s and 1930’s was the conflict between air and ground officers over the composition, organization, and command of military aviation. While this is not the place for a detailed review of that subject, the progress that the airmen made toward gaining acceptance for their point of view is reflected in organizational changes mentioned in subsequent paragraphs. The principles behind the war plan were applied to the smaller peacetime organization that was to be capable of rapid expansion in an emergency. For several years the striking force based in the United States consisted of three groups, the 1st Pursuit, the 2d Bom- bardment, and the 3d Attack. There also was one observation group (the 9th), and there was one observation squadron for each of the Army corps. During the same period there were three composite groups on foreign service, the 4th being in the Philippines, the 5th in Hawaii, and the 6th in Panama. 6 AIR FORCE COMBAT UNITS OF WORLD WAR II In 1926 the Army began to expand its air arm, and in the years that followed new groups were activated: the 18th Pursuit (in Hawaii) in 1927; the 7th Bombardment in 1928; the 12th Observa- tion and 20th Pursuit in 1930; the 8th and 17th Pursuit in 1931; and the 16th Pursuit (in the Canal Zone) and the 19th Bombardment in 1932. Consequently by the end of 1932 there were 15 groups (45 squadrons). The distribution of the squadrons by function is sig- nificant. The number of attack squadrons (4) was the same as it had been a decade earlier, while the strength in observation aviation had decreased from 14 to 13 squadrons. The growth had, therefore, been in other types of aviation, the number of bombardment squad- rons having increased from 7 to 12, and pursuit squadrons from 7 to 16. Five more pursuit squadrons were activated in 1933, bringing the total strength to 50 squadrons. The most important change in the combat organization of the air arm in the two decades between World Wars I and II came on 1 March 1935. At that time the War Department established General Headquarters Air Force (GHQAF) and placed it under the com- mand of an air officer to serve as an air defense and striking force. Some observation units remained assigned to corps areas, but all the pursuit, bombardment, and attack units in the United States became part of the new combat organization. The combat elements of GHQAF were organized into three wings: the 1st Wing (with head- quarters at March Field) had two bombardment groups, one attack group, and three observation squadrons; the 2d Wing (Langley Field) had two bombardment and two pursuit groups, plus three observation squadrons; the 3d Wing (Barksdale Field) had an at- tack and a pursuit group, plus one bombardment, one attack, and two pursuit squadrons. The commanding general of GHQAF, who reported to the Army’s Chief of Staff and was to report to the com- mander of the field force in time of war, was responsible for the or- ganization, training, and operations of this air force. The Chief of the Air Corps still retained the responsibilities associated with per- sonnel and materiel logistics. The change of the 9th Group from observation to bombardment in 1935 should be noted because that redesignation was an indication of the decline of observation and the growth of bombardment avia- INTRODUCTION tion. Two years later the 12th Observation Group was inactivated. And the same year (1937) the 10th Transport Group, the first group of its kind, was activated. But there were no other significant changes, the number of groups remaining at 15 (10 in the United States and 5 on foreign service), until 1939. World War 11 In January 1939 President Franklin D. Roosevelt asked Congress to strengthen America’s air power, which, the President said, was “utterly inadequate.” On 1 September 1939 Hitler attacked Poland, and the Second World War began. In the months that followed, as Axis forces won one victory after another, the Army’s air arm expanded rapidly. By the end of 1940 there were 30 groups. Within another year, that is, by the time the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor and the United States entered the war, the number of active groups had increased to 67, but many of them were still in the process of being organized and few had aircraft suitable for combat. The air arm grew even more rapidly in the months following Pearl Harbor, and by the end of 1943 there were 269 groups. At that time 133 of the groups were in the United States: 77 were being manned or trained; 56, which provided the strategic reserve, served as part of the defense force, as operational training units (OTU’s) that prepared new units for combat, or as replacement training units (RTU’s) that trained replacements for organizations overseas. Early in 1944 most of the OTU’s and RTU’s were inactivated or disbanded, the.training activities being given to base units. As a result the num- ber of combat groups fell to 218, but the formation of new groups brought the figure up to another peak of 243 in February 1945. When Allied forces landed on the beaches of Normandy on 6 June 1944, the United States had 148 combat groups in the European- African-Middle Eastern Theater for the war against Germany. By August 1945, when combat operations in the Asiatic-Pacific Theater came to an end, the United States had 86 groups in the war against Japan. In addition to the expansion, other important changes had taken place in the air arm. By 7 December 1941 more emphasis was being AIR FORCE COMBAT UNITS OF WORLD WAR II placed on bombardment. Of the 67 groups active at that time, 26 were bombardment organizations; half of the 26 were heavy and the other half were medium and light bombardment groups, the light groups having replaced the attack organizations of an earlier time. There also were 26 pursuit, 9 observation, and 6 transport groups. During the war, pursuit units were redesignated fighter, observation became reconnaissance, and transport became troop carrier. With the development of B-29 aircraft, very heavy bombardment organ- izations were added to the combat force. In the spring of 1945, when America’s air strength in the overseas theaters of operations reached its peak, the 243 combat groups of the AAF were divided as follows: 25 very heavy, 72 heavy, 20 medium, and 8 light bombard- ment groups; 71 fighter groups; 29 troop carrier groups; 13 recon- naissance groups; and 5 composite groups. At the same time there were 65 separate squadrons, mostly reconnaissance and night fighter, which were not assigned to groups but to higher echelons of organ- ization. As the number of groups increased, the number of wings multi- plied. Earlier, during World War I and in GHQAF, wings had been composite organizations, that is, had been made up of groups with different kinds of missions. Most of the wings of World War II, however, were composed of groups with similar functions. The growth of the air arm resulted in important organizational changes and developments above the group and wing levels. The separation of the combat organization (GHQAF) from the logistic organization (Air Corps) created serious problems of coordination. To correct this condition, GHQAF was placed under the Chief of the Air Corps, Maj. Gen. Henry H. Arnold, in March 1939. The two organizations were separated again in November 1940, but about the same time Arnold joined the War Department General Staff as Deputy Chief of Staff for Air, a position that enabled him to coordinate the two sections of the air arm. On 20 June 1941 the War Department created the Army Air Forces with the Air Corps and GHQAF, the latter redesignated Air Force Combat Command, as its major components and with Arnold as chief. In an Army reorganization on 9 March 1942 the Air Corps and Air Force Com- INTRODUCTION bat Command were discontinued and Arnold was made Command- ing General of Army Air Forces. During the war most of the AAF’s combat groups and wings were assigned to numbered air forces. The first four of these air forces had their origins late in 1940 when GHQAF was becoming so large that its headquarters could not exercise adequate control over the training and operations of the various GHQAF organiza- tions. General Headquarters Air Force was subdivided, therefore, into four air districts (Northeast, Northwest, Southeast, and South- west), which were redesignated First, Second, Third, and Fourth Air Forces early in 1941. These four air forces remained in the United States throughout the war, but others were established for service overseas: the Fifth, Seventh, Tenth, Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Twentieth served in the Asiatic-Pacific Theater; the Eighth, Ninth, Twelfth, and Fifteenth operated in the European-African- Middle Eastern Theater, the Eighth being redeployed to the Pacific after the war ended in Europe; the Sixth was in the Panama Canal Zone and the Eleventh in Alaska. Some air forces, particularly the larger ones, had subordinate commands (or sometimes divisions) that provided an additional eche- lon of organization, by bringing together wings (or groups) with similar functions. An air force, such as the Ninth, could have a bomber, a fighter, a troop carrier, and a tactical air command, the number and kind depending upon the size, functions, and peculiar needs of the air force. There also were some separate commands, such as the Antisubmarine Command, which were not assigned to numbered air forces. The arrangement of the various layers of organization is best seen by looking at the organizational position of some particular squadron, such as the 93d Bombardment Squadron, which took part in the B-29 offensive against Japan in 1945. That squadron was assigned to the 19th Bombardment Group, of the 314th Bombard- ment Wing, of the XXI Bomber Command, of the Twentieth Air Force. But the organization was much more complex than is indi- cated by such a chain, for operational and administrative require- ments resulted in the establishment of organizations above the num- bered air forces. There was, for example, the U.S. Strategic Air 10 AIR FORCE COMBAT UNITS OF WORLD WAR II Forces in Europe, which had some administrative control over both the Eighth and Ninth Air Forces (the one engaged primarily in strategic and the other in tactical operations), and which exercised some operational control over the two strategic air forces in Europe (the Eighth in England and the Fifteenth in Italy). Furthermore, American organizations sometimes became part of combined (i.e., Allied) commands. In April 1942, for instance, an organization called Allied Air Forces was created in Australia to control opera- tions of Australian, Dutch, and American air forces; and in Febru- ary 1943 American, British, and French elements in North Africa were combined to form the Northwest African Air Forces. The complexity of these organizational arrangements was compounded by the assignment of AAF units overseas to United States Army or- ganizations, and by the relationships of those Army organizations to joint (i.e., Army-Navy) and combined commands. This volume is not concerned with all of this vast organization but with the AAF structure from groups to numbered air forces. Within those limits, the major attention is focused on the groups, the basic operational organizations in the aerial war that America fought in the years between the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 and the Japanese surrender on 2 September 1945. .7946-/956 Once the victory had been gained, the United States plunged into demobilization, just as it had done at the end of the First World War. Officers and men were sent home. Bases were closed. Air- planes were stored or sold. And by July 1946 the Air Force had only 2 groups that were ready for combat, although 52 were carried on the list of active organizations. A new Air Force had to be built on the ruins of demobilization, the goal being 70 groups, the strength that was authorized for peacetime. In addition, reserve and national guard forces would be available for active duty in an emergency. There was much opposition, however, to a large military establish- ment in peacetime, and to the financial burden such an establishment placed on the nation. Consequently, the Air Force had to cut to 48 groups. INTRODUCTION Then came the Korean War, precipitated by the Communist attack on the Republic of Korea on 25 June 1950. The United States rushed combat forces across the Pacific to strengthen those already present in the Far East. Others were sent to Europe to meet the in- creasing threat of Communist aggression in that part of the world. At home the air defense force was expanded. Under these conditions the number of groups jumped from 48 to 87 within a year. In June 1952, when the strength was stated in terms of wings rather than groups, the Air Force had 95. By the end of the Korean War on 27 July 1953 the number of wings had increased to 106. The expansion had been accomplished in part by ordering reserve and national guard organizations to active duty. Those organizations were called for 21 months, but some were relieved before the end of that period. In fact, some reserve organizations were in active service for only a few days, just long enough to assign their personnel to other organizations. Most of the reserve and guard elements that served the full term of 21 months were replaced by newly-activated organizations of the regular Air Force. The program for expansion had first provided for 95 wings, but that goal was revised in November 1951 when the Joint Chiefs of Staff authorized a force of 143 wings to be attained by mid-1955. In 1953 the goal was reduced temporarily to 120 wings by June 1956, but later the same year it was changed to provide for 137 wings by June 1957. Under these changing programs the strength of the Air Force, in terms of the number of active wings, increased steadily. By the beginning of 1956 there were 127 wings, made up of 392 combat squadrons. There had been many organizational changes in the period from 1946 to 1956, but the most important one in the view of the profes- sional airmen was that which gave the Air Force its independence. Congress provided the necessary legislation in 1947 when it created a Department of the Air Force and established the United States Air Force as a separate service equal to the Army and the Navy in the nation’s military establishment. On 18 September 1947, W. Stuart Symington became the first Secretary of the Air Force. And a week later, on 26 September, Gen. Carl Spaatz, who had succeeded Arnold 12 AIR FORCE COMBAT UNITS OF WORLD WAR II as Commanding General of the Army Air Forces, became the first Chief of Staff, United States Air Force. Earlier, on 21 March 1946, Spaatz had undertaken a major re- organization that had included the establishment of three new com- bat commands in the United States: Strategic Air Command (soon known everywhere as SAC), to provide a long-range striking force capable of bombardment operations in any part of the world * Air Defense Command (ADC), to defend the United States against attack from the air; and Tactical Air Command (TAC), to support the operations of ground forces. TAC and ADC were reduced from major commands to operating commands when they were assigned to the Continental Air Command (ConAC) at the time the latter was established on 1 December 1948. ADC was discontinued on 1 July 1950 but re-established as a major command on 1 January 1951. A month earlier, on x December 1950, TAC had been removed from the control of ConAC and again made a major command. As a result of these changes ConAC became responsible mainly for super- vising reserve and national guard affairs. In addition to its commands in the United States, the Air Force had combat forces stationed over- seas, with Far East Air Forces, United States Air Forces in Europe, Caribbean Air Command, and Alaskan Air Command as the major commands for the various areas of operations. The World War II commands, which had been subordinate to the numbered air forces, were eliminated in the reorganization of 1946, and the numbered air forces were made components of the major commands at home and overseas. The new organizational hierarchy thus contained the following levels: squadron, group, wing, air force, command. In 1948, and afterward, wings were re- designated divisions, and placed immediately below the numbered air forces in the organizational pyramid, new wings being constituted and activated to take the place of the ones that had been elevated to the division level. In addition to support and service elements, each of these new wings, as a general rule, had one combat group, which carried the same numerical designation as the wing itself. In 1952, however, the Air Force began to inactivate the combat groups and assign their combat squadrons directly to the wings. Consequently no organizations in the Air Force perpetuated the histories of the INTRODUCTION 13 World War II combat groups that had been inactivated. The Air Force decided, therefore, to bestow the histories of combat groups on like-numbered wings. For example, the 9th Bombardment Wing, created after World War II, received the history of the 9th Bombard- ment Group, together with the campaign credits and decorations that had been earned by the group during the war. Despite all the changes that had taken place since V-J Day, the Air Force in 1956 was to a large extent made up of elements that car- ried on the traditions of organizations that had been active during World War II. The history of each of those organizations had been shaped by many forces. Domestic politics, the national economy, and international affairs were important factors in fixing the size, and hence the number of active groups or wings, of the Air Force. Science and technology determined the kind of equipment available at any particular time. Fortune, too, had a part in forming the histories of the various organizations. It is evident, for example, that chance, rather than design, sometimes decided which organizations would be kept active and which would be retired. The results are reflected in the historical sketches presented in this book. Some groups, for instance, have lengthy records of service; others were created at a relatively late date or have been inactive for long periods. Some were sent overseas for combat ; others were kept at home. Some received the newest planes from the production lines; others were forced to use old, worn-out craft. But no organization had its life shaped entirely by forces beyond its control, for its own people, the men and women who gave the organization a living existence, made history in many ways. A fighter pilot flew out to battle and came back an ace. A gunner returned from a bombing mission to be decorated for bravery above and beyond the call of duty. But one did not have to be a hero to have a place in history. The mechanic armed with his wrench, the clerk with his typewriter — each had his own important part to play. And at their head to lead them was a commander who, by virtue of his authority and responsibility, had a special role in the historical process. Thus, through the workings of numerous and diverse forces, each organization acquired a historic character and personality of its own. 14 AIR FORCE COMBAT UNITS OF WORLD WAR II At the same time, each contributed to the development of a larger history that goes back to a day in 1907 when the Army named a captain to take “charge of all matters pertaining to military balloon- ing, air machines, and all kindred subjects.” COMMANDERS I.

The group, which began operations immediately, was organized to provide fighter cover, bombardment strik- ing power, and air transportation services for Wingate’s Raiders, who were operating behind enemy lines in Burma. The or- ganization consisted of a headquarters plus the following sections: bomber (equipped with B-25’s) ; fighter (P-5i’s) ; light-plane (L-i’s, L-5’s, and helicopters) ; transport (C-47’s) ; glider (CG-4A’s and TG~5’s) ; and light-cargo (UC-64’s). The group supported operations in Burma by landing and dropping troops, food, and equipment; evacuating casualties; and at- tacking airfields and transportation facili- ties. Received a DUC for operations against the enemy, Mar-May 1944. With- drew from the front late in May 1944 and, with the bomber section eliminated and the P-5i’s replaced by P-47’s, began a training program. Reorganized later, with the sections being eliminated and with fighter, liaison, and troop carrier squadrons being assigned. Transported Chinese troops and supplies from Burma to China in Dec 1944, and carried out sup- ply, evacuation, and liaison operations for Allied troops in Burma until the end of the war. Attacked bridges, railroads, barges, troop positions, oil wells, and airfields in Burma and escorted bombers to Rangoon and other targets during the early months of 1945. Changed from P~47’s to P-5i’s in May 1945, the fighter squadrons being en- gaged in training from then until the end of the war. Moved to the US in Oct 1945. Inactivated on 3 Nov 1945. Disbanded on 8 Oct 1948. Squadrons. 5th Fighter: 1944-1945. 6th Fighter: 1944-1945. 164th Liaison: 1944- 1945. 16 $th Liaison: 1944-1945. 166th Liaison: 1944-1945. 319th Troop Carrier: 1944-1945.

Moved to the CBI theater in Aug 1944. Began opera- tions in Sep 1944 by transporting supplies and reinforcements to and evacuating casualties from Imphal, Burma. Contin- ued to support Allied operations in Burma, flying in men and supplies from India, moving equipment required to construct and operate airstrips, dropping dummy cargoes to lead the enemy away from Al- lied offensives, dropping paratroops for the assault on Rangoon (May 1945), and evacuating prisoners of war who were freed by Allied advances. Meanwhile, part of the group had been sent\" to China, and for a short time (Dec 1944-Jan 1945) the group’s headquarters was located there. Operations in China included helping to evacuate the air base at Kweilin during a Japanese drive in Sep 1944, mov- ing Chinese troops, and flying many sup- ply missions, some of which involved ferrying gasoline and materiel over the Hump from India. The group, partially re-equipped with C-46’s in Jun 1945, en- gaged primarily in transporting men, food, arms, and ammunition until the end of the war. Redesignated 512th Troop Carrier Group in Sep 1945. Returned tc the US in Dec 1945. Inactivated on 24 Dec 1945. Redesignated 512th Troop Carrier Group (Medium) and allotted to the re- serve.

(Approved 21 Jan I 95 8 -) 1st FIGHTER GROUP Organized as 1st Pursuit Group in France on 5 May 1918. Began operations immediately and served at the front until the end of the war, using Nieuport-28, Spad, and Sopwith Camel aircraft. Pro- tected friendly observation balloons and planes, and made strafing attacks on en- emy ground forces, but engaged primarily in counter-air patrols in which the group’s pilots gained many victories over enemy aircraft and destroyed numerous observa- tion balloons. Two of the group’s pilots were awarded the Medal of Honor: 1st Lt (later Capt) Edward V Rickenbacker — 21 America’s World War I “Ace of Aces” who served as commander of the 94th ( Hat-in-the-Ring) Squadron— received the medal for action near Billy, France* on 25 Sep 1918 when, disregarding the heavy odds, he attacked a flight of seven enemy planes and shot down two of them; 2d Lt Frank Luke Jr — the “balloon bus- ter” — was awarded the medal for attack- ing and shooting down three German bal- loons on 29 Sep 1918 before his plane was hit and forced to land near Murvaux, France, where he died while defending himself against capture by enemy ground troops. Demobilized in France on 24 Dec 1918. Reconstituted in 1924 and consolidated with 1 st Pursuit Group that had been organized in the US on 22 Aug 1919. Redesignated 1st Pursuit Group (Inter- ceptor) in Dec 1939, and 1st Pursuit Group (Fighter) in Mar 1941. Trained, partici- pated in exercises and maneuvers, put' on 22 AIR FORCE COMBAT UNITS OF WORLD WAR II demonstrations, took part in National Air Races, tested equipment, and experi- mented with tactics, using Spad, Nieu- port, DeHavilland, SE-5, MB-3, PW-8, P-i, P-6, PT-3, P-16, P-26, P-35, P-36, P-38, P-41, P-43, and other aircraft during the period 1919-1941. Was the only pur- suit group in the Army’s air arm for sev- eral years; later, furnished cadres for new units. Moved to the west coast imme- diately after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and flew patrols for several weeks. Redesignated 1st Fighter Group in May 1942. Moved to England, Jun-Jul 1942. As- signed to Eighth AF. Entered combat with P-38 aircraft on 28 Aug and flew a number of missions to France before being assigned to Twelfth AF for duty in the Mediterranean theater. Moved to North Africa, part of the ground echelon landing with the assault forces at Arzeu beach on 8 Nov 1942. The air echelon arrived a few days later and the group soon began operations, attacking enemy shipping, es- corting bombers, flying strafing missions, and performing reconnaissance duties dur- ing the campaign for Tunisia. Partici- pated in the reduction of Pantelleria. Escorted bombers to targets in Sicily and later aided ground forces during the con- quest of that island by strafing and dive- bombing roads, motor transports, gun emplacements, troop concentrations, bridges, and railways. Flew missions against the enemy in Italy and received a DUC for its performance on 25 Aug 1943 when the group carried out a strafing at- tack on Italian airdromes, destroying great numbers of enemy aircraft that presented a serious threat to the Allies’ plans for landing troops at Salerno. Also escorted bombers to Italy, receiving another DUC for a mission on 30 Aug 1943 when the group beat off enemy aircraft and thus enabled bombers to inflict serious damage on marshalling yards at Aversa. Support- ed the invasion at Salerno in Sep and con- tinued operations with Twelfth AF until Nov 1943. Assigned to Fifteenth AF with the primary mission of escorting bombers that attacked targets in Italy, France, Ger- many, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, Rumania, Yugoslavia, and Greece. Received third DUC for covering the withdrawal of B-iy’s after an attack on Ploesti on 18 May 1944. Also flew straf- ing and dive-bombing missions in an area from France to the Balkans. Supported the landings at Anzio in Jan 1944 and the invasion of Southern France in Aug 1944. Continued operations until May 1945. Inactivated in Italy on 16 Oct 1945. Activated in the US on 3 Jul 1946. Equipped first with P-8o’s and later (1949) with F-86’s. Redesignated 1st Fighter-Interceptor Group in Apr 1950. Inactivated on 6 Feb 1952. Redesignated 1st Fighter Group (Air Defense). Activated on 18 Aug 1955. As- signed to Air Defense Command and equipped with F-86 aircraft.

Also took part in the Meuse- Argonne campaign, attacking the enemy behind the line, and conducting bombing operations that helped to protect Allied 26 AIR FORCE COMBAT UNITS OF WORLD WAR II ground forces by diverting German pursuit planes from the battle zone. Participated in one of the great bombing raids of the war on 9 Oct when 353 Allied planes (in- cluding 200 bombers) under the command of William Mitchell struck a concentra- tion point where German troops were pre- paring for a counterattack against the Allied offensive in the Meuse-Argonne area. Demobilized in France in Nov 1918, soon after the armistice.

Used DH- 4 B’s to patrol the border from Brownsville, Tex, to Nogales, Ariz, until 1921. Redes- ignated 3d Attack Group in 1921, and 3d Bombardment Group (Light) in 1939. Equipped with O-i, 0-2, A-5, A-12, A-17, A-18, A— 20, A-24, and other aircraft, 1921- 1941. Trained, participated in maneuvers, tested new equipment, experimented with tactics, flew in aerial reviews, patrolled the Mexican border (1929), and carried air mail ( 1934) . Furnished personnel for and helped to train new organizations, 1939- 1941. Moved to Australia early in 1942 and became part of Fifth AF. Redesignated 3d Bombardment Group (Dive) in Sep 1942, and 3d Bombardment Group (Light) in May 1943. Served in combat from 1 Apr 1942 until V-J Day. Used A— 20, A-24, and B-25 aircraft for opera- tions. The group had its headquarters in Australia until Jan 1943, but its squadrons operated from New Guinea, bombing and strafing enemy airfields, supply lines, in- stallations, and shipping as the Allies halted the Japanese drive toward Port Moresby and drove the enemy back from Buna to Lae. At the end of that campaign in Jan 1943, headquarters moved to New Guinea. For the next year and a half the group continued to serve in the Southwest Pacific, where it played an important role in the offensives in which the Allies pushed along the northern coast of New Guinea, taking Salamaua, Lae, Hollandia, Wakde, Biak, and Noemfoor. In Mar 1943 it took part in the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, which ended Japanese attempts to send convoys to Lae. In Aug 1943, when Fifth AF struck airfields at Wewak to neutralize Japanese airpower that threatened the ad- vance of Allied forces in New Guinea, the group made an attack in the face of intense antiaircraft fire on 17 Aug, de- stroyed or damaged many enemy planes, and won a DUC for the mission. In the fall of 1943 the group struck Japanese naval and air power at Rabaul to support the as- saults on Bougainville and New Britain. In an attack on shipping at Simpson Har- bor, New Britain, on 2 Nov 1943, the 3d group encountered heavy opposition from enemy fighters and from antiaircraft bat- teries on the ships. In that attack Maj Raymond H Wilkins, commander of the 8th squadron, sank two ships before he was shot down as he deliberately drew the fire of a destroyer so that other planes of his AIR FORCE COMBAT UNITS — GRO U PS 31 squadron could withdraw safely — an ac- tion for which Maj Wilkins was posthu- mously awarded the Medal of Honor. The group moved to the Philippines late in 1944. Equipped with A-2o’s, it bombed and strafed airfields; supported ground forces on Mindoro, Luzon, and Mindanao; attacked industries and rail- ways on Formosa; and struck shipping along the China coast. Moved to Oki- nawa early in Aug 1945 and flew some missions to Japan before the war ended. Moved to Japan in Sep 1945 and, as part of Far East Air Forces, became part of the army of occupation. Served in combat in the Korean War from 27 Jun 1950 until the armistice on 27 Jul 1953. Operated first from Japan and later from Korea, using B-26 aircraft. Flew most of its missions at night to at- tack such targets as airfields, vehicles, and railways. Capt John S Walmsley Jr was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions on 14 Sep 1944: fly- ing a night mission in a B-26, Capt Walms- ley discovered and attacked an enemy sup- ply train, and after exhausting his ammuni- tion he flew at low altitude to direct other aircraft to the same objective; the train was destroyed but Walmsley ’s plane crashed in the target area. The group re- turned to Japan in 1954.
