        "text": "PIZZA, ANDREW ANTHONY (1926-2021). Technician 5th grade, United States Army. According to his World War II draft card, Andrew Pizza was born in Brooklyn. As per the 1930 federal census, he lived with his parents, Edward and Genevieve, and a younger brother, on 21st Street in Brooklyn. That census reports that Andrew’s father was employed in a bakery shop. The 1940 federal census documents that the family lived on 7th Avenue in Brooklyn and his father was a foreman at a bakery supply company.\n\nPizza’s World War II draft card details that he resided at 195 21st Street in Brooklyn and his mother was designated next of kin. His employer was Mr. Joe Lowe and his place of employment was Bakery Supplies in Manhattan. Noted on his draft card is his discharge date of July 18, 1946. The registrar’s report, dated August 8, 1944, describes him as 5′ 8″ and 155 pounds with gray eyes, brown hair, light complexion with a large scar on his left leg caused by an accident. Pizza signed up for the draft on his eighteenth birthday (August 8). As per his World War II enlistment record, Pizza’s actual date of enlistment was October 1, 1944. He was single, entered the army as a private, and completed three years of high school. There is no other documentation regarding his service history. His daughter, Mary Ann, notes that he was discharged with the rank of technician 5th grade.\n\nAs per the 1950 census, the twenty-three-year old Pizza lived with his parents and siblings, Anthony, 20, and Rose Ann, 6, at the 195 21st Street residence. Andrew is documented as a laborer’s helper at the Edison Electric Company; his daughter reports that he was a mechanic. He and Rina Rosiello applied for a marriage license in Brooklyn in 1954. The couple celebrated sixty-seven years of marriage and had two children, Edward and Mary Ann. In 1974, the couple moved to Staten Island.\n\nAccording to his obituary page from the Hanley Funeral Home, which confirms his World War II service, “Andrew “Chubby” Pizza retired from Con Edison in 1988 after 40 years. He loved to garden and play cards. He enjoyed his stay in Florida and the Arrochar Friendship Club. He was very handy and could build or fix anything. He was happiest when spending time with family!” A funeral mass was held at Our Lady Queen of Peace Church. The family asked that donations be made to A Very Special Place, Inc., a social services organization, in New Dorp, Staten Island. He was survived by his wife, his children, grandsons Edward and Ryan, and his sister. Section 132, lot 42148.\n\nPLACIDO, STEVE (or STEFANO) (1926-2014). Seaman first class, United States Navy. Placido was born in New York to Stefano Placido, an Italian immigrant, and Rosalie Placido, an American of Italian descent. At the time of the 1930 census, his father Stefano, a cabinet maker, was 29 years old, his mother Rosalie 23, Steve (then known as Stefano) was 3 years and 9 months, and his younger brother Gastavo was just over 1 year old. The family lived in Brooklyn at 328 12th Street. As per the 1940 census, the family continued to live on 328 12th Street. Stefano Placido was then 39 and a cabinetmaker and his wife Rosalie was 33 and a dressmaker. They had three children: Stefano was 13, Gastavo 11, and a younger daughter named Mary was 9. Placido attended St. Saviour Elementary School and Manual Training High School (now John Jay Educational Campus) in Park Slope.\n\nIn 1943, Placido registered for the United States Navy at the age of 19. The registration card lists his first name as Steve, his employer’s name as Veteran and his father is listed as the person who will always know his address. That document indicates that he had a home telephone. His daughter, Susan Placido Lauser, reports that from 1944 to 1945, Placido served on board the USS Monterey (CVL-26), a small aircraft carrier, which made voyages to the Philippines including Leyte Gulf, Japan including Honshu and Okinawa. He is listed among the sailors aboard the USS Monterey on May 29, 1944, with his service having begun on May 14, and is also listed on the ship’s muster roll for March 31, 1945. There were many air strikes in Okinawa, Saeki, Kure, Tokuma, Misawa, Atsugi and Tokyo but the aircraft carrier was never captured. It was however, struck by Typhoon Cobra while in the Pacific and the ship almost sunk. Gerald R. Ford, the future 38th President of the United States, was also serving on the Monterey at this time. For his service, Placido was given the Philippine Liberation Ribbon, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal, American Campaign Medal, and the Victory Medal. Placido is listed on the muster roll for the USS Monterrey on April 1, 1946.\n\nIn 1949, Placido married Helen L. Miscione and the couple had two children: Susan (born in 1954), and Steven (born in 1956). As per his daughter, he was the owner of West Potato, Inc. According to the United States Public Records, he lived in Brooklyn from 1984-1996 and again from 1998 to 2005, then in Parksville, New York, from 1996 to 1998, and in New York City from 2005 until his death. Section 39/40, lot 38325, grave 821.\n\nPLAENER, ALFRED JOHN (1922-2007). United States Coast Guard. Alfred John Plaener was born in Manhattan to William Ludvig Plaener, born August 28, 1887, and Anna McCormack Plaener, born August 9, 1888. His parents had married in New York on February 2, 1918. William was born in Hamburg, Germany, and Anna, also later known as Anne, in Roscommon, Ireland. Both parents eventually became United States citizens, William on March 22, 1932, and Anna on May 1, 1956. When William filed his Declaration of Intention to become a citizen on March 31, 1925, he listed his address as 414 61st Street, Brooklyn, and his occupation as chef manager; he was 5′ 7″ in height, weighed 150 pounds, with light brown hair, blue eyes, and a fair complexion. By the time he was naturalized, in 1932, he was living at 261 67th Street in Brooklyn, and indicated that he had initially entered the United States from Bermuda, at which time his nearest relative or friend lived on 277 West 11th Street in Manhattan. Anna had entered the United States by way of New York City on March 15, 1905. The manifest for the S.S. Fort Victoria shows that both parents, already married, had been outside the United States and had returned together from Bermuda on March 24, 1921.\n\nAlfred had an older brother, William Robert, born October 24, 1919, also in New York City. In 1940, according to the federal census of that year, the family lived at 261 67th Street in Brooklyn and Alfred’s father was a manager at a restaurant. Alfred was living at this same address in 1993.\n\nPlaener registered for the draft on June 30, 1942, when he was 20 years old. According to his draft card, Alfred was 6 feet tall, weighed 175 pounds, and had a light complexion with brown hair and blue eyes. His brother William is described in almost the same way on his draft card, although William was 5′ 9″ tall. At the time Alfred registered, he worked at E.W. Bliss Company on 53rd Street and 2nd Avenue in Brooklyn. Although it is unknown what Alfred did while employed there, the Bliss Company manufactured metal pressing machines and pressed metal products and “during the Spanish-American War and World Wars I and II the company obtained important defense contracts for the manufacture of torpedoes.” Alfred’s father William also registered for the draft, and his 1942 registration card showed him working at Cosmo Cafeteria, 1321 Surf Avenue in Coney Island and living at 261 67th Street in Brooklyn.\n\nAlfred served in the military from December 28, 1942, until March 29, 1946. Although the Department of Veterans Affairs record for Alfred indicates that he served in the Navy, his gravestone more specifically identifies him as a veteran of the United States Coast Guard. This is not a discrepancy since the Coast Guard operates under the Navy in times of war.\n\nAccording to the 1950 federal census, Alfred lived with his mother and father, but his brother William was no longer in the household, perhaps because he was already married and living with his spouse, Jane Letitia Greffath. Alfred’s father was still a restaurant manager and Alfred worked as a bartender in a tavern.\n\nThe Trans World Airlines passenger manifest of July 22, 1955 shows that Alfred Plaener flew out of New York on Trans World Airline Flight No. 880-22. He returned to New York on August 18, 1955, arriving on Trans World Airlines Flight No. 861-18 from London, England.\n\nPlaener’s father died in August 1964. His mother died in 1971. Alfred’s brother, William, died on November 11, 1993, when he was 74. William, his wife Jane, their son Christopher, and his mother Anna are all interred in the same plot at Green-Wood, Section 131, lot 35217, but Alfred’s father William is not at Green-Wood, and Alfred is interred in a different plot. Section 103, lot 45067.\n\nPLATT, THERON GRIGGS (1917-1942). Second lieutenant, 90th Bomber Squadron, 3rd Bomber Group, United States Army Air Corps. Theron Griggs Platt was born in Brooklyn to Augustine Rice Platt, age 44, and Florence Griggs Platt, age 40. According to the 1920 federal census, Theron resided on East 21st Street in Brooklyn with his parents and six-year-old sister, Dorothy. All family members had been born in New York. Augustine Platt was a manager at the International Mercantile Marine Company (IMM), a holding company headed by J.P. Morgan. One of its subsidiaries was the White Star Line, which owned the RMS Titanic in 1912.\n\nThe 1925 New York State census, recorded when Platt was seven years old, shows the family residing at 2123 Albemarle Terrace in Brooklyn. Also in the household was Mary Driscoll, age 39, a servant. Augustine Platt was still employed as a manager at International Mercantile Marine Company. The 1930 federal census lists the family at the same Brooklyn address. Florence’s 83-year-old father, Rufus T. Griggs, a lawyer, was residing with them, as was Mary Driscoll. Augustine was still employed as a manager at International Mercantile Marine Company. Theron Platt, age 12, was in school, and able to read and write. On June 18, 1930, the Times Union newspaper printed an article about Theron’s grandfather’s estate. Rufus T. Griggs died at their Brooklyn home on June 7, 1930, and funds were left in his will to educate his two grandchildren.\n\nTheron attended Poly Prep Country Day School in Brooklyn. The Brooklyn Citizen newspaper printed an article on May 31, 1935, noting that he was one of 50 students attending Brooklyn schools to be awarded a set of Charles Dickens books as a prize for winning the David Copperfield-Charles Dickens contest held in conjunction with the showing of the David Copperfield film at the Loew theaters in Brooklyn. According to an article in the June 16, 1935 Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Platt graduated high school on June 7, 1935 and would be spending that summer with his family at their summer home at Sea Cliff, Long Island. Platt then attended Hamilton College in Clinton, New York, graduating on June 12, 1939. The Brooklyn Daily Eagle printed an article, on December 3, 1937, about his football activities in college.\n\nAt the time of the 1940 federal census, Theron, who was sometimes known as “Tom,” was residing at 34 The Oaks, in Roslyn Estates, New York, with his parents. Also in the home was Nellie May, age 45, a servant. Platt had completed his fourth year of college and was still a student. After obtaining his undergraduate degree, he went on to study forestry at Yale University but left after a year to join the military.\n\nPlatt’s World War II draft card, signed on October 16, 1940, shows him living in Roslyn, with his father as his contact. He was unemployed, 5′ 8″ tall and weighed 160 pounds, with gray eyes, brown hair, and a ruddy complexion. He enlisted in the United States Army on December 5, 1940, and his World War II enlisted men card shows that he served with Battery G Company, 207th Coast Artillery Anti-Aircraft Regiment, until February 10, 1941. He wanted to serve with the Army Air Corps and, on November 4, 1941, he enlisted again, this time at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, as an aviation cadet. The enlistment record indicates that his civilian occupation was in the field of acting. His religion was Protestant.\n\nPlatt served as a pilot in the Army Air Corps, holding the rank of second lieutenant with the 90th Bomber Squadron, Third Bombardment Group, and was stationed in Australia. According to an article in the November 7, 1942 Brooklyn Daily Eagle, after his commission as a second lieutenant, he flew as a pilot with his squadron from San Francisco to Hawaii on September 2, 1942. He later went on to Australia, where he was stationed at the time of his last flight. Sadly, 24-year-old Theron Griggs Platt was killed in action over New Guinea in the southwest Pacific on November 1, 1942. Edgar R. Cochrun, chaplain, kept a list of the men at whose funerals he had officiated. He wrote that Platt “died in plane crash following mission over enemy territory 2 November 1942, Landing gear of plane shot off by enemy fire” (this earlier date of death may be due to the time difference between Asia and North America.) His parents and sister, Dorothy Platt Nelson, survived him. He was awarded a Purple Heart. According to National Cemetery records, Platt was initially interred at the Ipswich United States Air Force Cemetery in Brisbane, Australia. However, his remains were transferred to the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu, Hawaii, on January 10, 1949. A cenotaph memorializes him at Green-Wood. Section 141, lot 27113.\n\nPOLESINELLI, FRANK JOSEPH (1919-2002). Corporal, Merrill’s Marauders, United States Army. Frank was born in Brooklyn to parents Barnard and Josephine Polesinelli. He attended Our Lady of Peace Grammar School through the eighth grade. The earliest record of the family is the 1940 census which describes Barnard Polesinelli as fifty-three and his wife Josephine Polesinelli as fifty. Frank was recorded as white, single and twenty-one years old and one of the eldest children, his sister Mildred also being twenty-one. He had four younger sisters: Rose who was nineteen, Mary who was eighteen, Antoinette who was eleven, and Lorion who was five. Frank had completed his school education till the 8th grade and worked as a peddler. The same 1940 census records indicate that he had worked thirty hours in the week prior, worked for himself and had an income of $182.\n\nIn 1942, Polesinelli enlisted in the army at Fort Jay on Governors Island in New York Harbor. His enlistment record describes him as 5′ 8″ tall, 158 pounds and lists that he worked as a huckster and peddler. His registration card indicates he lived at 571 Union Street in Brooklyn, his mother was his emergency contact and his employer was Frank Cassillo at 63 Garfield Place in Brooklyn.\n\nPolesinelli trained in Trinidad, Louisiana, and Georgia. As reported by his son, he volunteered for the 5307th Composite Unit (Provisional), also known as Merrill’s Marauders and named after Frank Merrill, the United States Army general who commanded the unit in the World War II’s Burma Campaign. When he volunteered, he did not know what his mission would be; volunteers were told that they would receive a special and dangerous assignment. Merrill’s Marauders was a special operations force active between 1943 and 1944 which fought in the China-Burma-India Theater. The Marauders advanced 750 miles in just over five months, carrying their equipment on their backs or on mules, in some of the harshest jungle terrain in the world. This was farther than any other United States Army advanced in World War II, despite hunger and disease. These men were considered expendable; they were not expected to survive. Polesinelli fought battles near Walawbum (February 24 through March 7, 1944) and Shaduzup (March 12 through April 25, 1944) as reported by his son. The special force also fought in Inkangahtawng, Nhpum Ga, and Myitkyina. During the siege of Nhpum Ga beginning on April 9, 1944, the 3rd Battalion broke through the enemy line. Polesnelli’s son reports that at Nhpum Ga, Burma (now Myanmar), his father was ill with amebic dysentery and was evacuated by small plane. The Marauders battled the Japanese Army on thirty-two separate occasions, including two battles for which the unit was not equipped or intended to take part.\n\nFor their service in Burma, the Marauders each received the Combat Infantry Badge, the Bronze Star, and they were awarded the Presidential Unit Citation (originally called the Distinguished Unit Citation). In 2020, the Merrill’s Marauders Congressional Gold Medal Act became law. It awarded the highest token of gratitude for the service, and sacrifice, of the men of that unit. In 1945, Polesinelli was discharged and he retired as corporal. He was married to Mary Jean; the couple had a son and a daughter. He was self-employed in the fruit and vegetable business. His death was attributed to natural causes. Section 5, lot 39944, grave 1.\n\nPONZI, EMIDIO LAWRENCE (1925-2018). Corporal, 1st Division, 6th Regiment, United States Marines. Born in Brooklyn and raised in Park Slope, Emidio was the second child of Vincent and Isabel Ponzi. Vincent Ponzi was an Italian immigrant and a street railway worker; his wife, Isabel, was born in New York. As per the 1940 census, the family lived at 187 8th Street in Brooklyn. At the time, Emidio had an older sister named Helen who was eighteen and he himself was fifteen years old and had completed his third year of high school.\n\nIn 1943, at the age of eighteen, Ponzi graduated from what was then Manual Training High School (now known as John Jay Educational Campus) in Brooklyn and enlisted in the Marines. His registration card listed his mother as his next of kin and his employer as N.W Gossard at 315 4th Avenue in New York City. He received training at the 4th Recruit Battalion at Marine Corps Recruit Depot, Parris Island in South Carolina, and began his service as private, fighting in the Pacific Theatre at the Battle of Okinawa with the 6th Marine Division. By 1946, after three years of service, Ponzi had become a corporal.\n\nIn 1951, Ponzi joined the New York City Police Department where he served for thirty-six years and retired as detective sergeant in the Brooklyn South Homicide Squad. He was one of the detectives on the Brooklyn South Task Force investigating the sniper shootings in southern Bensonhurst in 1981. In a May 26 Daily News report on the shooting investigation, he was quoted as saying that it appeared it was “random shootings by an unknown sniper firing from an altitude.”\n\nPonzi and his wife, Edith, had three children: Vincent, Isabel, and Joseph. After his retirement in 1987, the couple moved to Palm Harbor in Florida where they lived for many years. He is said to have made a lot of friends and was described as “a voracious reader.”\n\nIn 2015, Ponzi’s wife Edith passed away and Ponzi died three years later at the age of ninety-three. He was survived by his three children; his grandchildren Janine, Christine, Philip, Laura, and Jennifer and eight great grandchildren. One of his dearest childhood friends described him as a great man and friend, respected by all, especially his peers on the job and in life. Ponzi’s funeral mass was held at Our Lady of Pity Roman Catholic Church in Staten Island. Section 177, lot 40415, grave 1.\n\nPRICE, FREDERIC (or FREDERICK) P. (1917-1994). Captain, Company D Infantry, United States Army. Price was born in Oneonta, New York. His first name is recorded as Frederick on the birth index as well as on all subsequent documents issued prior to his military service. However, his name was often spelled with the “k” at the end. As per the 1920 federal census, he lived with his parents, Clinton and Mae, and his older brother, George, on Spencer Place in Brooklyn. Both parents were born in the United States – his father in Pennsylvania and his mother in New York. Although this census records his father as an inspector in the carpet industry, ensuing documents chronicle him as a civil engineer. Furthermore, his father’s first name is listed as Chilton. As stated by the 1925 New York State census, the Price family lived at 129 Rogers Avenue in Brooklyn. Frederic and his brother attended school and his father was a civil engineer. The 1930 federal census notes that the family continued to reside at the Rogers Avenue address and his father was a civil engineer for the War Department.\n\nDetails of Price’s early life and renowned baseball career are best depicted on the website “Baseball’s Greatest Sacrifice” by Gary Bedingfield, most of which is substantiated by Price’s son, Dan:\n\nFrederic P. Price was educated in Brooklyn at Erasmus Hall High School where he was a three-letter star in baseball, football and soccer. He attended George Washington University, Washington, D.C., where he played baseball and basketball, attracting the attention of New York Giants’ scout Pancho Snyder, and played for the Lormawood Club during the summer. Price left college after his first year and joined the Giants’ spring training camp a Gulfport, Mississippi, in 1937. He was sent to the Greenwood Giants of the Class C Cotton States League for the season and batted .233 in 139 games. The next year – 1938 – he was with the Fort Smith Giants of the Class C Western Association where he hit .277 in 141 games. Price advanced to the Clinton Giants of the Class B Three-I League in 1939, and batted .260. Still with Clinton in 1940, he hit .245 in 115 games and hoped to gain the first base job at Jersey City in the International League the following year.\n\nAs per the 1940 federal census, Price and his parents resided at 427 Eastern Parkway. Frederic is recorded as single, twenty-three years old and a baseball player. The transcription inaccurately details that his highest level of education was first grade.\n\nPrice entered “Fred” as his first name on his World War II draft card. The card documents that he was twenty-three years old and living at the Eastern Parkway residence. His father was designated next of kin. His employer was the National Exhibition Company located at 104 West 42nd Street in Manhattan. The registrar’s report, dated October 16, 1940, describes him as 6′ 0″ tall and 180 pounds with brown eyes and hair and a light complexion.\n\nThe November 20, 1940 issue of The Brooklyn Daily Eagle lists his name among 1,917 inductees from Brooklyn and Queens that were to report to the army on November 25, 1940. Beside his name is a “V” indicating he was a volunteer. Another article in the same issue, “Star on Giants’ Farm Team Goes to Bat for Uncle Sam,” reports, “Asked why he volunteered, and thus became one of the first called (to service), Price declared: ‘Well, you’ve got to get the thing over with, and I thought I might as well do it now.’ His enlistment was one year prior to the involvement of the United States in World War II which, according to Bedingfield, “meant serving a year and missing only one season.”\n\nAs per Bedingfield’s website:\n\nPrivate Price was assigned to Camp Upton on Long Island. Following six weeks of basic training he was assigned to Company D at the 122nd Reception Center, Camp Upton, and was detailed to drill recruits in fundamental marching. During this time, he had a few opportunities to play semi-pro baseball with Barton’s Nighthawks. When questioned at the time about whether he ever expected to pick up his baseball career again, Price explained, “If I didn’t love baseball, I think I would stay in the Army for a career. But I don’t think the world would seem right to me if I couldn’t play baseball. When my year is up, I will apply to Commissioner Landis for reinstatement and report back to Bill Terry (Giants manager).”\n\nPrice’s participation in baseball activities at Camp Upton is well-documented by The Brooklyn Daily Eagle. The June 3, 1941 article, “Camp Upton Nine Ready for Battle with All Comers: May Take on Dodgers in Addition to Teams from Colleges, Forts,” reports that Price shared coaching duties with Sergeant Stanley Kulakowski on the newly organized varsity baseball team. The article continues to relate that a tentative schedule of games was drawn up to play against New York University, St. John’s University, Long Island University, Fort Totten, and Fort Tilden, among others. The August 7, 1941 article, “Unbeaten Upton Nine to Meet Southampton,” details an upcoming game between the Camp Upton team and the Southampton team. The article relates that the Camp Upton team was on a 14-game winning streak and describes Price as the “star of the soldier team.” The August 20, 1941 issue of the newspaper features a photo of the Upton Baseball Squad with Price pictured with his teammates.\n\nBy October 1941, Price, having served his one year, was released from active duty. As cited earlier, his intentions were to be reinstated with professional baseball and report back to the Giants. However, due to the attack on Pearl Harbor, this never transpired. As per David Finoli’s book, For the Good of the Country: World War II Baseball in the Major and Minor Leagues:\n\nPrice, who had been released in October of 1941 after his one-year commitment, was still in the reserves when he was called back to active duty after Pearl Harbor and sent to the Asian Theater. His baseball record might not have been the thing legends are made from, but his war record was about to be. While fighting on April 10th, 1945 at Cebu in the Philippine Islands, First Lieutenant Fred Price was shot twice, first hit by shrapnel right below the right knee, a second time in the lower stomach.\n\nDan Price, Frederic’s son, has shared an excerpt from a document signed by Major W. A. Moreland, Adjutant General, describing Frederic’s combat activities:\n\nFIRST LIEUTENANT FREDERIC P. PRICE 01311570, Infantry, United States Army. On 10 April 1945 during the advance to take a strategic hill, Lieutenant Price’s company was subjected to heavy enemy rifle, machine gun and 20 mm gunfire. Due to the nature of the terrain, it was impossible to maneuver troops to either flank of the company and allowed the enemy to concentrate fire on a small area. Lieutenant Price, weapons platoon leader, observing several enemy positions, immediately ordered his platoon into firing positions and went forward to observe the effect of the fire. While crawling to a better observation post, he was seriously wounded in the knee by an enemy 20mm shell. Refusing to leave his post, he continued to direct fire for mortars and machine guns for a period of forty minutes while he was under constant enemy fire.\n\nAt the time Frederic sustained his war injuries, he was married to Helen Mildred (Ryan). The couple may have applied for a marriage license in Brooklyn on May 16, 1941, as per the New York City Marriage License Indexes. However, according to information shared by his son, the Prices were married in 1940.\n\nA Western Union telegram was delivered to Helen on May 5, 1945. This official notice related: “The Secretary of War desires me to express his deep regret that your husband 1/Lt Price Frederic P was seriously wounded on Cebu 10 Apr 45. Hospital sending you new address and further information. Unless such new address has been received, address mail for him quote rank, name, serial number.” In his book, Finoli quotes Dan, Frederic’s son, describing the stressful event: “It was a frightening time for my mother. She hadn’t heard from my dad for a month. She didn’t get the letter until May informing her that my dad had been seriously injured and where to send the mail. It was another month before she heard from him again.” According to Finoli, Frederic was hospitalized for two-and one-half months.\n\nAs per his son, Price was awarded two Purple Hearts and a Bronze Star for his service. In listing Price’s awards, Finoli also includes a Philippine Liberation Ribbon. On September 6, 1946, Price was promoted to the rank of captain. According to the American Baseball Bureau Questionnaire completed by Frederic, he served in the infantry from November 1940 to January 1946. In his book, Bedingfield states that Price was honorably discharged on January 14, 1946. Quoting Bedingfield, “Fred Price was the first professional ballplayer to voluntarily enlist for military service during WWII, and holds the distinction of being the longest serving.”\n\nAfter the war, according to Finoli,\n\nIn January of 1946, with his war injuries healed, he came home and reported to the Giants’ spring training camp. Unfortunately, there would be no spot on the team, as the Giants only would offer a position on their AAA minor league club. With a family to worry about, Price did not want to go to the minors again. The war had cost Price what might have been a promising major league career.\n\nPrice’s son shares that his father was an employee benefits manager for Equitable Life Insurance Company and then went on to work for SCM Insurance. As per Price’s baseball questionnaire, he liked basketball and fishing and his baseball ambition was “to play in a World Series.” According to his obituary notice in the New York Daily News, Frederic and Helen had three children: Stephen, John and Daniel (Dan). Price passed away in Hillsborough, Florida at the age of seventy-six. Section 86, lot 18066, grave 91.\n\nPUGLISI, VICTOR (or VITTORIO) (1919-2000). Private, 106th Infantry, Company E, United States Army. Vittorio Puglisi was born in Brooklyn. Per the 1920 federal census, Victor was living with his parents, Fred and Mary Puglisi, on Nostrand Avenue in Brooklyn. Fred Puglisi was 29, born in Italy, and working as a railroad conductor. Victor’s mother, Mary, was 19 years old and born in Italy as well. They all spoke Italian. The Social Security Claims Index lists Victor’s parents as Frederick Pugliesi and Mary Terino. The 1925 New York State census lists Fred Puglisi as a restaurant worker. A daughter, Florence, 1 year old, had been added to the family.\n\nBy the 1930 federal census, the family was living on Midwood Street in Brooklyn. Victor was then 10 years old, his father, Fidelio (Fred), was 40 and working as a counterman at a restaurant, while his mother, Mary, was 29, and sister Florence was 6. According to the 1940 federal census, the family was living on Martense Street in Brooklyn. Victor, at 30 years of age, worked part-time at a garage. His father was unemployed. Younger siblings were Florence, 16, and Jonny, 8.\n\nVictor’s New York National Guard service card and enlistment record shows that he enlisted on May 23, 1940, in Buffalo, New York (while still a resident of Brooklyn) in the 106th Infantry. He had completed two years of high school and was assigned to the field artillery branch of the National Guard. The 106th was inducted into federal service, as a unit of the United States Army, on October 15, 1940. Victor served as a private in Company E of the 106th Infantry until demobilized on October 7, 1945. The 106th Infantry Division was sent to Hawaii on March 20, 1942. After helping to secure the Island of Eniwetok from the Japanese in February 1944, the 106th landed on Saipan on June 20, 1944, five days after the initial invasion. They fought along rough jungle terrain and were able to defeat a last-ditch Banzai charge by Japanese troops. Moving on to fight on Okinawa in March 1945, the 106th Infantry repelled another Banzai charge and then was sent to occupy the Island of Lejima. When the war ended, the division arrived in Japan on September 12, 1945, for occupation duty.\n\nVictor and Rose Ann Squicciarini applied for a marriage license in Brooklyn on June 10, 1946. As per the 1950 federal census, they were living on East 45th Street in Brooklyn. Victor was 30 and working as a window trimmer at a department store, while Rose, 28, worked as a finisher at a perfume factory. Rose’s parents, Ignazio and Anna, also lived with the couple, along with Rose’s brothers Nicholas (see), also a World War II veteran, and Thomas. Everyone was employed.\n\nPuglisi’s last residence was on Staten Island. Victor’s gravestone identifies him as a “WWII veteran,” and he is interred with Rose, who died in October 2016. Rose’s parents and brother Nicholas Squicciarini are interred at Green-Wood next to the Puglisis. Section 129, lot 39044, grave 2.\n\nQUINN, JOHN RICHARD (1918-1977). Private, United States Army. John Richard Quinn was born in Jersey City, New Jersey. His parents were John J. Quinn and Kathryn O’Donnell. When he filed his draft registration card on October 16, 1940, he was living at 619 Rogers Avenue in Brooklyn. His mother, Katherine (rather than “Kathryn”), was listed as his contact. His employer was Royalace Paper Works Co., 234 Rogers Avenue, Brooklyn. His race was noted as white, and he had a light complexion, with blue eyes and red hair. His height was listed as 5′ 10″ and he weighed 152 pounds.\n\nAccording to Veterans Affairs records, Quinn enlisted in the United States Army on October 10, 1946, after World War II was over. However, his gravestone, issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs, identifies him as a World War II veteran, which might be in error. He was a private and was discharged on April 12, 1947.\n\nQuinn and Jeanne F. Roever filed for a marriage license in Brooklyn on June 6, 1942. By 1950, according to the federal census of that year, the couple was living in Brooklyn, and Quinn was working 40 hours per week as a shoe salesman in a retail establishment. His wife was a homemaker.\n\nQuinn died on August 27, 1977, according to Veterans Affairs records, and was interred at Green-Wood on August 30, 1977. Jeanne F. Quinn passed away on November 4, 2013 and is interred at Green-Wood with her husband. Section 206, lot 33384, grave FRC.\n\nREID, JOSEPH ROBERT (1926-1991). Corporal, United States Army.

Reinertsen was born in Brooklyn. Records from the 1925 New York State census report that he resided at 4619 5th Avenue with his parents, Nils Gabriel and Anna Marie, an older brother, Reinert, his uncle and cousin, Jack Brown and Jus Abrams, a lodger, Harry Simon, and a roomer, Hilmer Rykipnes. Both parents were born in Norway. Reinertsen’s first name and middle initial are recorded as Carl A. The 1930 federal census states that his family resided at 738 59th Street and his father was a yacht steward. There were no census listings for his uncle, cousin, the lodger, and the roomer. As in the 1925 census, his first name is recorded as Carl. However, he printed and signed his World War II draft card as Arnold Carl Reinertsen. His residence was 449 61st Street, and his mother, residing at that address, was listed as the contact person. He worked as a clerk for The New York Times, located at 1475 Broadway in Manhattan. The registrar’s report, dated February 15, 1942, notes that he was 6′ tall, weighed 188 pounds, had hazel eyes and blond hair, a light complexion, with a scar behind his right ear.\n\nReinertsen’s World War II Army enlistment record states that he was single, had completed three years of high school, and was skilled in general woodworking. His enlistment date was March 6, 1943. The transcription erroneously describes him as 7 ‘3″ tall with a weight of 111 pounds. As per his daughter, he served with the 116th Antiaircraft Artillery (AAA), was stationed in France, Germany and Belgium, and engaged in battles in the Ardennes (Battle of the Bulge), Central Europe, Normandy, Northern France, and the Rhineland. According to the Battle of the Bulge Association, the 116th AAA Gun Battalion engaged in various heroic activities from June 6, 1944, to December 31, 1944. Since Reinertsen served in this battalion, he may have engaged in the following assignments that it received: June 6, 1944 – defend beach installations on Utah Beach, as a part of the Normandy invasion on D-Day; July 12 to August 4, 1944 – ordered to abandon its antiaircraft mission and assume a tank destroyer role in the Chaumont area; August 6, 1944 – deployed to Mayenne to set up an antiaircraft defense, accomplished its goal, received an emergency request from the 16th Infantry Division to engage in a field artillery mission against the enemy, and saved the 16th Infantry from annihilation; August 25, 1944 – ordered to leave the Mayenne area, arrived in the Paris area two days later, and set up AAA defenses in Paris and at the bridges over the Seine River; September 8, 1944 –moved to Sedan, France, set up AAA defense on the bridges over the Meuse River, but did not engage in any action; September 29 to October 12, 1944 –called upon to protect the locks of the Albert Canal and bridges over the Maas River in Maastrict, Holland; October 12, 1944 –ordered to protect the VII Corps Artillery in Aachen, Germany, and was the first gun battalion to fire on German soil; and December 16, 1944 –continued to support the VII Corps Artillery between Stolberg, Germany and the front lines near the Roer (or Rur) River. Throughout its deployment, the 116th is credited with destroying 32 enemy aircraft.\n\nReinertsen’s daughter relates that although he was engaged in combat, his letters “…somehow always focused on the more uplifting and positive stories—of staying with a poor family in France and helping their daughter get a piano, etc. In his letters he tried to only convey positive stories to his mother, for example…telling her about the British family in the United Kingdom that took them in for Thanksgiving even though they didn’t have much.” In a letter to his mother, dated December 22, 1943, Reinertsen wrote:\n\nDear Mom,\n\nJust another letter to let you know I’m still safe and sound, and to ease any worries you might have. The weather is a little snappy, but you know Mom that’s the way we like it around Christmas. Speaking of Christmas, it’s only a few days off. We expect to have some sort of a party, you know Mom, to sort of cheer the boys up and bring them closer to home. Quite a few of my buddies have been invited to some of the homes about here for dinner and such. The people are really trying to be nice to us.\n\nI received a letter from you and Marion yesterday. It sure was swell to hear from home. It sure was swell to hear that Rolf is still working hard and feeling so well. I was surprised to find that Ray is still home. He must know what he’s going to do by now. Maybe after Christmas he’ll do what’s right. Well Mom the lights are going out soon, and there’s no more room so—good night – till tomorrow.\n\nYour Loving Son\n\nCarl\n\nAs per his enlisted records and report of separation, Reinertsen was honorably discharged on October 29, 1945. Reinersten’s daughter noted that her father achieved the rank of corporal (T-5), and that he was awarded the European-African-Middle Eastern Service Medal with a Bronze Arrowhead and the Good Conduct Medal. She also shared that although he left Alexander Hamilton High School after the eleventh grade, he earned his high school equivalency after the war. Her father’s primary place of employment after the war was Addressograph Multigraph Corporation in New York, where he worked for 25 to 30 years. Reinertsen married Ida Cecilia Agoglia in 1953 and the couple had two sons and two daughters. According to his daughter, “He was a good and loving father and son.” According to the California death index, he was residing in San Dimas, a suburb of Los Angeles County, at the time of his death. Section 41, lot 36080, grave B.\n\nREZK, MITCHELL G. (1913-1973). Staff sergeant, 773rd MP Battalion, 4900th Service Command Unit, United States Army. Mitchell was born in Brooklyn in 1913 to George and Amelia (Abourizk) Rezk. According to the 1915 New York State census, the family also included his father’s brother, Phillip Rezk. All three adults had immigrated from Syria in 1901. His father was employed as a tailor. Phillip’s occupation is listed as “Embroidery.” In 1916, Mitchell’s brother Victor was born. A second brother, George Jr., may have been born in 1917 or 1918. Another brother, Albert, born in 1919, only survived for two days. The 1925 New York State census reported the family living on Court Street in Brooklyn. Phillip was no longer living with the family, and George Sr. was reported to be in the “Cleaner and Drier” business.\n\nIn 1932, a new business venture on Court Street—Rezk’s Auto Driving School—was announced in the Times Union newspaper. Nineteen-year-old Mitchell was the proprietor. About one year later, an investigative article in the New York Daily News mentioned Rezk’s Auto Driving School among those offering to obtain license plates for a fee. (At the time, no fee was charged for in-person applications at the State office building across the street.) “Saving steps for saps” was the article’s catchy lede.\n\nAccording to the 1940 federal census, Mitchell and brother Victor were living at home with their parents. Mitchell was working as a bookkeeper and Victor as a clerk. Mitchell registered for the draft in October, 1940, at the age of 27. He was described on his registration card as 5′ 7″ tall, weighing 130 pounds, with brown eyes, black hair, and a light brown complexion. His employer was Sunnydale Farms, a dairy.\n\nIn May 1942, Rezk enlisted in Company C, 14th Regiment, of the New York National Guard, the state militia which had been nationalized with the advent of World War II. (The 14th Regiment Armory, its former home base, still stands, less than a mile from Green-Wood.) A few months later, Mitchell was inducted into the United States Army on August 24. His home address was 632 84th Street in Brooklyn.\n\nRezk served as a military police sergeant in the 773rd MP (Military Police) Battalion, 4900th Service Command Unit, at Fort MacArthur, in California. He achieved the rank of technician 3rd grade (tec 3), equivalent to a staff sergeant, a non-commissioned officer. The technician rank was created to recognize enlisted soldiers with special, non-combat skills. In his role as staff sergeant, Mitchell supervised clerical work and prepared reports for the outpatient and clinical departments of Fort MacArthur’s medical facility. On February 2, 1946, he was honorably discharged, having received the Good Conduct, American Campaign, and World War II Victory medals.\n\nIn June 1944, Mitchell and Alice Lucente obtained a marriage license in Brooklyn. In 1948, their son George was born. By the time of the 1950 federal census, the Rezk family was living on Fort Hamilton Parkway and consisted of Mitchell, Alice, and George, along with Mitchell’s parents and his brother Victor. Mitchell was working for an ice cream company—he had stayed in the dairy business. Victor’s occupation was listed as a clerk in a soda company—a happy pairing, perhaps, in the mind of young George. Mitchell and Alice also raised a daughter, Roberta, born in 1951. Along with ice cream sodas, George and Roberta may have enjoyed the thrills of the famous Coney Island Cyclone, partly owned and managed by their uncle Victor. He died in Brooklyn. Section R, lot 42537, grave N1.\n\nRICCIARDI, ANTHONY (or ANTONIO) (1915-1974). Corporal, 158th Infantry Regiment, United States Army. According to the New York City birth index, Ricciardi was born in Brooklyn. Records from the 1920 federal census report that he resided at 418 Lake Street with his parents, Joseph and Concetta. His father immigrated from Italy in 1897, and his mother, also from Italy, immigrated in 1900. His father worked as a shoemaker in a factory. His parents had eight children: Amadeo, Frank, Angelo, Gerard, Carmine, Rocco, Anthony, and Philomena. The 1930 census notes that the family still resided at the Lake Street address. Ricciardi’s father had passed away and his mother was head of household with five children still living with her. His oldest brother, Amadeo, married with a daughter, is documented as the head of a separate household at the same address. Ricciardi’s first name is recorded as Antonio. The 1940 census notes that the twenty-four-year-old Ricciardi was a shoemaker, and still resided on Lake Street with his sister, Philomena, and two brothers. His mother had passed away. The census documents his two brothers, Amadeo and Frank, as separate heads of household.\n\nRicciardi’s World War II draft card records his residence on Lake Street, his age as twenty-four, and his brother, Frank, as the contact person. He worked at Lippert Brothers Company at 1 Main Street, Brooklyn. The registrar’s report, dated October 16, 1940, notes that he was 5′ 2″ tall, weighed 125 pounds, had gray eyes and brown hair, and a light complexion. The Department of Veterans Affairs BIRLS (Beneficiary Identification and Records Locator Subsystem) Death File documents his enlistment date as September 5, 1941. As per his son, he served in the 158th Infantry Regiment, engaged in action in the Philippines on the Bicol Peninsula in southern Luzon and Lingayen Gulf, and “was very proud to have been a Bushmaster.” Those serving in the 158th were known as “Bushmasters.” The 158th Infantry Regiment has a long history. It was formed as the First Arizona Volunteer Infantry and engaged in the Indian Wars and the Mexican Expedition. On August 5, 1917, the 158th was drafted into federal service. It was deployed during World War I, World War II, and the war in Afghanistan.\n\nOn December 7, 1941, three months after Ricciardi’s enlistment, Pearl Harbor was attacked. The 158th Regiment soon was deployed to Panama to secure the canal and train in jungle warfare. According to the article, “Bushmasters Always Stand Tall,” on the Department of Emergency and Military Affairs website, by Specialist Wesley Parrell, “Arriving in Panama on January 2, 1942, the soldiers of the 158th began an intense training program in the jungles, which were better suited for insects and reptiles than they were for men. For weeks on end, the day’s long rains soaked the soldiers as they hacked through the thick vegetation with machetes, callusing their hands. Frequent dealings with the deadly snakes of the jungle, led to the unit adopting the name “Bushmasters” after the venomous pit vipers found in Central America.” The bushmaster snake became the distinguishing insignia on the shoulder patch of the 158th Regiment. The fighting skills of the “Bushmasters” were so renowned that General Douglas MacArthur personally selected and requested they be sent to his command in the Southwest Pacific Theatre. MacArthur lauded the Bushmasters: “No greater fighting combat team has ever deployed for battle.”\n\nAccording to the Fort Tuthill Military Museum, the 158th Regiment engaged in major campaigns from December 1944 through May 1945. Since Ricciardi served in this regiment from September 1941 to October 1945, he likely engaged in the following assignments: December 1944 – Arawe, New Britain Island; May 1944 – Wakde Island-Sarmi New Guineas; July 1944 – amphibious assault Noemfoor Island, New Guinea; January 1945 – amphibious assault Lingayan in the Philippine Islands; March 1945 – Batangas Province, Southern Luzon, Philippine Islands; April 1945 – amphibious assaults at Legaspi Southern Luzon, Philippine Islands and Bacon, Sorsogen Province Philippine Islands; May 1945 – Mt. Isarog Bicol Peninsula, Philippine Islands.\n\nThe 158th Infantry Regiment engaged in combat zones longer than any National Guard unit in all wars, was the first army unit trained in jungle warfare, was the regiment that traveled furthest in their 5 ½ years of active duty, more than any Army unit in any war, and was the first army unit to be sent overseas after Pearl Harbor.\n\nIn 1987, Bushmasters: America’s Jungle of World War II, by Anthony Arthur was published. This book not only details the history of the 158th Infantry Regiment, but also focuses on the personalities of some of the officers and enlisted men. Ricciardi is memorialized in this book in the recounting of an event involving the twenty-seven-year-old Ricciardi who took responsibility for safeguarding a seventeen-year-old fellow soldier, Jimmy Boyer, on the beach at Arawe.\n\nAs per the Department of Veterans Affairs BIRLS Death File, Ricciardi was discharged on October 1, 1945. Little is known of his life after the war. His last residence was in Brooklyn. According to the obituary in the New York Daily News, dated April 9, 1974, he was survived by his wife, Louise, and his two children, Anita Murphy and Anthony Jr. Section 137, lot 39369, grave 2.\n\nRIGNOLA, CARMINE (1923-2014). Private first class, 35th Tank Battalion, 4th Armored Division, Headquarters Company, United States Army. According to his World War II draft registration card, Rignola was born in Mineola, New York. His parents, Salvatore and Teresa (Tessie), were born in Italy. As per his father’s family tree and fact sheet on Ancestry.com, Salvatore was born in Carbora, Italy. He immigrated from Naples to New York in 1892 aboard the Olessia. He declared his intention to become a United States citizen on April 8, 1910 and submitted naturalization papers on March 19, 1913 in New York. Carmine’s mother was born in Egidio, Italy and immigrated to the United States before the age of 10. Salvatore and Teresa were married on May 14, 1905, in Brooklyn, and the couple had eleven children. The siblings, in birth order, are: Lucy, Domenica (Minnie), Dominick (see), Botlomia (Bertha), Florence, Thomas, Vincent, Carmine (Harry), Albert, Gloria, and Theresa.\n\nAs per the 1910 federal census, his parents, Salvatore (misspelled Sahatore) and Teresa lived at 117 3rd Street in Brooklyn with their three children: Lucy, Minnie and Dominick. According to the 1920 federal census, the family had grown to six children with the births of Florence, Thomas and Vincent. The Rignolas resided in the family-owned, but mortgaged, home at 251 6th Avenue and Salvatore was a stevedore at the New York Navy Yard. By the 1930 federal census, the Rignola family had moved to 1923 8th Avenue and had nine children living at home, ranging in ages from under one to seventeen. Salvatore was a self-employed plumber. Carmine’s mother passed away on May 31, 1931 at the age of forty-three. According to the 1940 federal census, the seventeen-year-old Carmine was living with his father and five siblings in their 8th Avenue home.\n\nAccording to Rignola’s World War II draft registration card, he registered on June 30, 1942 at the age of eighteen. He is described as 5′ 5″ tall and 131 pounds with black hair, brown eyes and dark complexion. He was employed by Virginia Dare Extract Company at Bush Terminal in Brooklyn. The Virginia Dare Company has been in business for over ninety years with headquarters on Third Avenue in Brooklyn, a production factory in Carteret, New Jersey, and facilities in Shanghai, Paris, and Madagascar.\n\nCarmine’s World War II enlistment record details that he was single, attended three years of high school and worked in the “manufacture of electrical machinery and accessories.” His enlistment date was February 10, 1943. On November 14, 1947, Carmine received his honorable discharge from the Army. Inscribed on it were his name, rank (private first class), unit (Headquarters Company 35th Tank Battalion 4th Armored Division), and date of discharge (January 9, 1946). Given his enlistment and discharge dates as well further information from his daughter that he drove a tank and served in Europe, he may have taken part in the following events as detailed in “4th Armored Division Campaigns during World War II”:\n\nThe 4th Armored Division landed at Utah Beach on July 13, 1944, a month after the D-Day invasion of the French Normandy coast. Within weeks, the “Breakthrough” division was sweeping across France. During the Battle of the Bulge, the unit provided badly needed support to the encircled US forces in Bastogne, Belgium. In late March 1945, the 4th crossed the Rhine River into central Germany and, by war’s end, had reached the Czech border.\n\nOn April 4, 1945, the “Breakthrough” division overran Ohrdruf, a subcamp of the Buchenwald concentration camp and the first Nazi camp liberated by US troops…The 4th Armored Division’s discovery of the Ohrdruf camp opened the eyes of many US soldiers to the horrors perpetrated by the Nazis during the Holocaust.\n\nThe 4th Armored Division was recognized as a liberating unit by the US Army’s Center of Military History and the United States Holocaust Museum in 1985.\n\nThe commanding general of the 4th Armored Division refused to sanction an official nickname for the 4th, believing that the division’s accomplishments on the battlefield made one unnecessary. “Breakthrough” was occasionally used, apparently to highlight the division’s prominent role in the breakout from the Normandy beachhead and liberation of France in 1944.\n\nIn his article “Fighting Men: The 4th Armored Division,” Mack Dean details:\n\nThe 4th Armored was amongst the busiest of the US Army’s armored divisions…In July, the division transitioned to France over the Utah beach and the first elements tasted combat on July 17. From that point on, the 4th formed as a mechanized spearhead, heading Patton’s drive through the French countryside towards Germany. The 4th Division’s tanks and half tracks blew through steadily weaker defenses until a lack of fuel, longer supply lines, and a rallying foe called for a halt. Later, when the German army attacked US forces in the Ardennes region of Belgium, the 4th Armored was well to the south, in the Saar region of France and Germany. On December 18th, 1944, the 4th attacked north to try to reach the 101st Airborne Division trapped in the town of Bastogne. It had broken contact and covered 150 miles in 19 hours. On December 26th, the 4th Division finally entered Bastogne, providing the 101st with a firm supply line that enabled the scrappy airborne troops to take the fight to the enemy.\n\nFrom the Battle of the Bulge, the war was practically downhill for the vaunted 4th Armored. After crossing the Rhine in late March of 1945, town after town fell to the division in a drive that ended on VE Day in Czechoslovakia.\n\nFor his service, Carmine received numerous medals, including: European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign, Army of Occupation Medal, American Campaign, and Army of Occupation of Germany.\n\nCarmine was not the only Rignola brother to enlist in the military during World War II. Three of his brothers also had the honor of serving their country. According to his brother Albert’s World War II enlistment records, Albert enlisted on September 9, 1943 as a private. His discharge date was February 27, 1946, as per the Department of Veteran’s Affairs BIRLS (Beneficiary Identification and Records Locator Subsystem) Death File. As detailed in his Department of Veteran’s Affair BIRLS Death File, his older brother, Vincent (see), enlisted on August 22, 1942 and was discharged on December 14, 1945. His brother, Thomas, gave the ultimate sacrifice. According to the January 31, 1945 issue of the Brooklyn Eagle, “Sgt. Thomas Rignola, 26, of 1923 8th Avenue was killed in action in Belgium on Dec. 31, his father, Salvatore, has been informed by the War Department. He had been overseas since November.”\n\nAfter the war, Carmine and Rita Caputo applied for a marriage license on July 24, 1948 in Brooklyn, as per the New York Marriage License Indexes. Their daughter states that they married on August 7, 1948. According to the 1950 federal census, the couple and their first-born daughter were living with Carmine’s in-laws in Brooklyn. Carmine and Rita were married for sixty-four years and had three children – Diane, Salvatore, and Elizabeth.\n\nRignola’s primary employment was with the New York City Transit Authority Bus and Trolley. The United States Public Records Index records that Carmine lived at 167 Amber Street in Staten Island in 1986. A subsequent Public Record from 1992, records him living at 1149 36th Street in Brooklyn.\n\nCarmine received a letter, dated May 8, 2001, from the Consulat General de France. In it, Richard Duque wrote:\n\nI would like to thank you for the part you played in the battles for the Liberation of France during World War II. I am pleased to send you the certificate of recognition issued by the French Secretary of State for Veterans Affairs, Jean-Pierre Masseret, and the Chairman of the Basse-Normandie Region, Rene Garrec.\n\nIn describing her father, Carmine’s daughter Diane shares about her father, who also was known as Harry:\n\nHarry’s grandchildren (Jacqueline and Stephen) were the apple of his eye. For enjoyment, Harry played cards with his brothers and brothers-in-law, as well as hunting, fishing, and searching for fresh mushrooms. He took great pleasure in cooking his precious mushrooms, which were a family favorite. In his later years, he kept himself busy attending flea markets. Harry lived a long, productive and happy life.\n\nSection 126, lot 44600, grave 3.\n\nRIGNOLA, DOMINICK (1912-1982). Rank and service branch unknown. Dominick was born in New York into a large Italian immigrant family. His father Salvatore was born in Carbora, Italy, and came to the United States in 1892 aboard the ship Olessia; his mother Tessie Rignola was born in Egidio, Italy and arrived in the United States in 1895. Salvatore and Tessie married in 1905 in Brooklyn when they were about twenty-four and eighteen years old, respectively. They had eleven children: Lucy, Domenica, Dominick, Bertha, Florence, Thomas, Vincent, Carmine (Harry), Albert, Gloria and Theresa.\n\nAccording to the 1915 state census, the Rignola family lived at 117 Third Street in Brooklyn. Salvatore Rignola worked as a porter and his wife Theresa did housework. Dominick was three years old and had two older sisters and a younger one. Per the 1925 New York State census, the Rignola family had moved to 284 1st Street in Brooklyn. Salvatore now worked as a bootblack and Dominick, who was twelve years old, attended school and was one of seven children.\n\nBy the time of the 1930 federal census, the family was living at 1923 8th Avenue in Brooklyn. Salvatore Rignola owned the family home, worked as a plumber, and both him and his wife Tessie were naturalized citizens. Now nine of their eleven children lived in the home with Dominick, aged seventeen and the eldest, working as a runner on Wall Street. Sadly, Tessie would pass away only a year later, at the age of forty-three.\n\nRecords show that in the summer of 1936, Dominick applied for a marriage license at the age of twenty-three and married Filomena Dilarante on July 5. Per the 1940 federal census, Dominick Regnola, as written there, and his wife, listed as Florence, rented their home at 437 20th Street in Brooklyn, just a stone’s throw away from Dominick’s father and siblings, and just across the street from Green-Wood Cemetery. Dominick worked forty hours a week with a yearly salary of $1,000 as a varnisher at a paint factory. It is possible that he worked with his younger brother Thomas who, as indicated by the records, had the same occupation. These records also tell us that Dominick had completed four years of high school and he and his wife had three children: twin daughters Mary and Theresa, aged six and a half, and a son named Salvatore, aged two.\n\nIn the fall of 1940, World War II draft records tell us that Dominick registered for service. The document describes Dominick as 5′ 4″ in height, one hundred and thirty-five pounds, with a dark complexion, brown eyes, and black hair. His wife Filomena is listed as his next of kin and Sapolin Company, at 183 Sorrain Street in Brooklyn, is listed as his employer.\n\nWhile precise details of Dominick’s time in service are unknown, family records tell us that Dominick came from a family of men who served during World War II. All four of his younger brothers, Thomas, Vincent (see), Carmine (see), and Albert, served during the war. Sadly, Thomas did not return home; the January 31, 1945 issue of the Brooklyn Eagle reported, “Sgt. Thomas Rignola, 26, of 1923 8th Avenue was killed in action in Belgium on Dec. 31, his father, Salvatore, has been informed by the War Department. He had been overseas since November.” Vincent served in New Guinea and Philippines as part of the Asia-Pacific War campaign against Japanese offensives; Harry (Carmine’s nickname) was a private, first class in the 35th Tank Battalion, 4th Armored Division, served in Europe and received several medals for his service; and records show that Albert served between 1943 and 1946.\n\nPer the 1950 census, Dominick lived at 454 20th Street and worked forty hours a week as a mechanic machinist. He and his wife now had four children: Salvatore , Theresa, Mary and Anne (aged four). According to public records, the last known address for Dominick was 437 20th Street in Brooklyn which was his first home address after marriage and his address when he registered for the draft. Section 134, lot 37830, grave 619.\n\nRIGNOLA, VINCENT J. (1921-1987). Private, United States Army. Vincent was born in Mineola, Nassau County, New York, into a large Italian immigrant family. His father, Salvatore, was born in Carbora, Italy, and came to the United States in 1892 aboard the ship Olessia; his mother Tessie Rignola was born in Egidio, Italy, and arrived in the United States in 1895. They were married in 1905 in Brooklyn; Salvatore and Tessie were about twenty-four and eighteen years old, respectively, at that time. The couple had eleven children: Lucy, Domenica, Dominick (see), Bertha, Florence, Thomas, Vincent, Carmine (or Harry) (see), Albert, Gloria and Theresa.\n\nAt the time of the 1925 New York State census, the Rignola family lived at 284 1st Street in Brooklyn. Salvatore worked as a bootblack and his wife Tessie did housework; Vincent, listed here under his middle name James, was four years old.\n\nBy the 1930 federal census, the Rignola family was living at 1923 8th Avenue in Brooklyn. Salvatore Rignola owned the family home, valued at $4000, and worked as a plumber. Both parents were naturalized citizens and the oldest two children no longer lived with them. Vincent was nine years of age at this time and attended school at P.S. 154 on 11th Avenue. Sadly, only about a year after this census was recorded, his mother Tessie passed away at the age of forty-three.\n\nPer the 1940 census, the family continued to live at the same house. Sal Regnola, as his name was written here, worked as a fireman. Vincent, who was now nineteen years old and had completed the first year of high school, worked as a laborer.\n\nIn February of 1942, Vincent Rignola registered for service when he was almost twenty-one years old. The draft records described him as 5′ 7″ tall with brown eyes and hair and a ruddy complexion. He weighed 180 pounds and a scar on his forehead was noted as a distinguishing physical characteristic. His father was listed as his next of kin and the Army Base at 58th Street in Brooklyn was listed as his employer.\n\nRignola served in New Guinea and Philippines as part of the Asia-Pacific War campaign against Japanese forces. Due to the conditions that he served in, Rignola was one of thousands of soldiers who suffered from malaria at a time when adequate medical care and supplies were a challenge. He received the Good Conduct Medal which is awarded to soldiers for exemplary conduct, efficiency, and fidelity throughout their active service, and was discharged on December 14, 1945.\n\nIn his military service to the country, Rignola was joined by four of his brothers: Dominick, who registered for service in 1940, Albert who served between 1943 and 1946; Carmine (Harry), who was a private first class in the 35th Tank Battalion, 4th Armored Division, served in Europe and received several medals for his service; and Thomas who tragically did not return home. The January 31, 1945, issue of the Brooklyn Eagle reported, “Sgt. Thomas Rignola, 26, of 1923 8th Avenue was killed in action in Belgium on Dec. 31, his father, Salvatore, has been informed by the War Department. He had been overseas since November.”\n\nIn 1948, Vincent married Elizabeth Salzone. Per the 1950 federal census, the couple lived at 502 Prospect Avenue with Elizabeth’s father, Joseph Salzone. Rignola was thirty years old, Elizabeth twenty-eight, and the couple had a one-year-old daughter named Mary. Rignola worked forty-eight hours a week as a chauffeur for a valve fitting company. The couple also had a second child named Theresa. As reported by his daughter, Vincent worked in the Department of Transportation for twenty years.\n\nRignola continued to live at 502 Prospect Avenue as late as the 1980s and this was his last address. When he passed away, he was survived by his wife, his two daughters and five grandchildren. He is buried next to his brother Carmine (Harry). Section 126, lot 44600, grave 4.\n\nRIZZO, GERARD (or JERRY) MICHAEL (1916-1967). Sergeant, United States Army Air Forces. Gerard was born in Brooklyn in 1916 to Michele and Teresa (née DiBuono) Rizzo, both of whom were born in Italy and immigrated to the United States around 1897. Michele worked as a hotel cleaner, according to census records. The 1910 federal census listed five daughters born to the Rizzos and living at home, ranging in age from 12 years to 11 months. The 1920 federal census noted two more Rizzos—Josephine, age 5, and Gerard (listed as Jeremiah), age 3½, youngest child and only son. He had six older sisters.\n\nThe available decennial census reports (the federal reports occurring on the decade; the state reports occurring on year five in between) could not capture the births and early deaths of two other Rizzo daughters: Lillie, who died in 1904 at about two months of age; and Susie, born 1911, who died in the 1918 Influenza Pandemic, according to the New York State Death Index.\n\nBy the time of the 1940 federal census, 24-year-old Gerard, known as Jerry, was the only child still living at home. His father was working as a porter in a “reception hall,” apparently the Grand Prospect Hall in south Brooklyn (which was in business 1903-2022). Gerard had graduated from Manual Training High School (now John Jay Educational Campus in Park Slope), and was working as a pin-maker in a jewelry factory.\n\nIn October of the same year, Gerard registered for the draft. According to his registration card, his employer was Joseph H. Meyers on 25th Street in Brooklyn. Gerard listed his mother as the person who would always know his whereabouts. He was described as 5’ 4 ½” in height, weighing 143 pounds, with brown hair and eyes, a ruddy complexion, and wearing eyeglasses.\n\nGerard Rizzi was inducted into the Army at Fort Jay, on Governors Island, in September 1942. His enlistment record notes that he had completed one year of college. A series of local news clippings served to track Gerard’s stateside progress: in May 1943, Corporal Rizzo was reported by the Brooklyn Daily Eagle to be in Casper, Wyoming, where the Army Air Base there trained bomb groups for overseas assignment and crew replacement. By early March 1944, Sergeant Rizzo was stationed at Tinker Field, Oklahoma, a supply and maintenance depot as well as the site of a Douglas aircraft factory producing the C-47 transport and the A-2o Havoc bomber aircraft. He also served as chief clerk at Walker Field, Kansas, the training base for the B-29 Superfortress bombers. The B-29s led the attacks on the Japanese home islands that began in March 1944.\n\nAccording to his great nephew, Ronald Spence, Gerard went on to serve in the Pacific Theater of the war, although the details are unavailable. It’s possible that because of his eyesight (as noted on his draft card, Gerard wore eyeglasses), his draft status was originally A1L, or “limited service,” meaning only for noncombat roles in the Army, usually stateside. In 1943, limited-service soldiers began to be either discharged or reclassified and sent overseas. Having served both in the United States and overseas, Rizzo was discharged from the Army on January 3, 1946, according to government records.\n\nIn 1955, the New York City Marriage Index recorded an application for a marriage license for Gerard and Anna Papa. According to his great nephew, Gerard pursued a career in banking and the couple had two children. In June 1967, Gerard died at the age of 51. His wife, Anna, died in 2009 and is interred next to him. Section Yard, lot 39000, grave 982.\n\nRIZZO, JOSEPH (or GIUSEPPE) S. (1914-1997). Private first class, 63rd Infantry Division and Artillery, United States Army. Rizzo was born in Brooklyn. His first name is recorded as Giuseppe on birth records. However, all records from 1920 and on document his first name as Joseph. The 1920 federal census states that the five-year-old Joseph lived on West 9th Street in Brooklyn with his mother, father and older sister, Pauline. Both parents, Philip and Frances, were born in Italy and his father was a brush-maker. By the 1925 New York State census, the family had moved to 161 West 9th Street and his father worked for a cement company. The Rizzo family had grown to three sons and a daughter with the births of James and Alfred.\n\nAs per Rizzo’s National Guard record, he served in the How. Co. 14th Infantry for three years. He enlisted on May 3, 1934 and was honorably discharged on May 2, 1935. Rizzo re-enlisted in the 14th Infantry on May 3, 1937 and received another honorable discharge on May 2, 1938. On May 3, 1938, he again joined the National Guard’s 14th Infantry, but no separation date is given.\n\nHis granddaughter, Tracey Lucey, shares that Rizzo married Theresa on June 5, 1938. According to the 1940 federal census, the couple lived on Lynn Street in Brooklyn. Rizzo, twenty-six years old, was a shipping clerk for a toy factory and Theresa was a machine operator in a paper box factory.\n\nRizzo’s World War II draft card details that he was twenty-six years old and lived at 65 Rapelyea Street in Brooklyn. His wife was named next of kin. Rizzo had his own business located at 301 Douglas Boulevard in Brooklyn. His accompanying registrar’s report describes him as 5′ 8″ and 140 pounds with brown eyes, brown hair and light complexion.\n\nAs per his World War II Army enlistment records, he entered service as a private with one year of high school. His enlistment date is February 23, 1944. According to the World War Two Veterans website, Rizzo is listed among those who served in the Battery 861st Field Artillery Battalion – the 63rd Artillery. This is substantiated by his granddaughter who states he served in the “Blood and Fire” division in France and Germany, liberating concentration camp prisoners. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum dedicates a page to the 63rd Infantry Division. Since Rizzo enlisted in 1944, he probably took part in many of the campaigns described by the museum:\n\nThe 63rd Infantry Division was created in 1943 and landed in southern France in December 1944, some six months after the massive Allied invasion of western Europe on D-Day (June 6). The “Blood and Fire” division advanced northward and eventually crossed the Saar River into Germany in early February 1945. At the end of the following month, on March 30, the unit took the town of Heidelberg, advanced southward into Bavaria, and crossed the Danube River.\n\nAs the 63rd advanced farther into the Bavarian countryside, on April 29-30, 1945, it liberated several Nazi subcamps attached to the Kaufering camp complex in the Landsberg region. One battalion of the division was ordered to search for and secure all the concentration camps in the area. Seven camps and hundreds of dead prisoners were discovered. The army reported that the camps were “full of starving and dying political prisoners. These people, many of them recently moved from Dachau, many of the from the Ghettos of Poland, were found in advanced stages of malnutrition, typhus, diarrhea, skin diseases, boils and abscesses, and mental and emotional illness.\n\nAccording to the museum, the 63rd “was recognized as a liberating unit by the US Army’s Center of Military History and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in 2000.” The 63rd Infantry Division was nicknamed the “Blood and Fire” division. As per the museum: “The nickname commemorates British Prime Minister Winston Churchill’s statement at the Casablanca Conference in January 1943 that “the enemy would bleed and burn in expiation of their crimes against humanity.’”\n\nAccording to his granddaughter, Rizzo received a Good Conduct Medal for his service to his country. His granddaughter also relates that he and his wife had two children. After the war, Rizzo was a shipping clerk and a truck driver. Section 1120D, Hillside Mausoleum Phase 1.\n\nROCHFORD, MARTIN XAVIER (1918-1995). Sergeant, 3rd Chemical Mortar Battalion, 3rd Division, United States Army. Martin was born in New York City to Martin Edwin and Anna M. (née Devins) Rochford; his father was born in Ireland while his mother was from New York. According to the 1920 federal census, the Rochfords, including Martin’s older siblings, James and Katherine, lived in a rented residence at 613 East 77th Street in Manhattan; Martin’s father worked as a highway paver. By the time of the 1925 New York State census, the family was living at a multi-unit building at 248 East 77th Street. That census indicates that Martin Edwin had been in the United States for 24 years and became a naturalized citizen in 1916. The father was still employed as a paver, his mother was identified as a housewife, and his older brother James was an office boy; two more sons, George and Thomas, had been added to the family. The 1930 census reports that the family was living in their own home (valued at $9,000) at 241 East 35th Street in Brooklyn. Martin’s father was a highway foreman, James worked as a clerk for the Edison Electric Co. and Catherine worked as a bookkeeper in the banking industry. Although always identified as New Yorkers by birth, Martin’s older siblings, James and Catherine, are listed as being born in Pennsylvania on that document. There were two more children in the family, Francis and Anna.\n\nMartin, the subject of this biography, attended St. Francis Prep, where he was a tackle on the football team and from which he graduated in 1937. His yearbook photo (below) was in The Brooklyn Tablet newspaper announcement and his photo was in Brooklyn Daily Eagle on its sports page on September 17, 1936. In 1940, the family still lived in the East 35th Street house; Martin E. Rochford was an assistant supervisor for the highway department and Martin Xavier was a clerk at a brokerage firm; his two older siblings no longer lived at home. His family does not recall their father ever working at a brokerage house but at some point in his life, he was a delivery truck driver for Railway Express.\n\nRochford registered for the draft on October 16, 1940. He had a home phone, still lived at the East 35th Street address in Brooklyn, and identified his mother as his next of kin. His draft registration card notes that he was employed by “Sperry’s” at 42 Flatbush Avenue Extension in Brooklyn. The Sperry Corporation was a well-known equipment and electronics company that developed gyroscope-based aviation instruments such as auto-pilots, airborne radar systems, the Ball Turret Gun and bombsights, and was a major military supplier during World War II. According to registrar’s report, Martin had brown hair, gray eyes and a ruddy complexion. As per his subsequent enlistment record, he was 6′ 4″ tall and weighed 220 pounds.\n\nOn September 9, 1941, Rochford enlisted in the United States Army in Yaphank, New York, when he was 23 years old. A photo of Martin published in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle on March 17, 1943 when he was home on furlough notes that he was a sergeant; that rank is also recorded on a card with his name from the National Jewish Welfare Board Card which notes that he was wounded during his service. He served with the 3rd Chemical Mortar Battalion, 3rd Division, in North Africa, Sicily, France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and Germany. There is a monument to that Battalion in Grove, Oklahoma. He participated in the Battle of the Bulge under the command of General George Patton. Mortar battalions supported infantry divisions and infantry regiments as they went into combat, often staying in the line as infantry units were rotated out of combat and new fresh units came to the front. As per Wikipedia, during the Allied invasion of Sicily in the summer of 1943, the first time the mortar was used in wartime to fire chemicals, 35,000 such rounds were fired in 38 days, of which more than 90% were highly explosive.\n\nIn November 1943, Rochford was admitted to the hospital in Italy with a penetrating shrapnel would to his left knee sustained in the line of duty. As per his hospital admission record, he returned to duty after the shrapnel was removed. For his service, Rochford received numerous awards and medals, including the World War II Medal, Europe-Africa-Middle East Campaign Medal with Arrow Head and Silver Star, Good Conduct Medal, Germany Army Occupation Medal, American Defense Medal, American Campaign Medal, Purple Heart, Rifle Marksman Badge, and the French Croix De Guerre with Bronze Star for action in Monte Casino, Italy. Martin was discharged on June 24, 1945, shortly after his brother, Thomas, was killed in action in the Pacific. Rochford’s son Patrick confirms his father’s service in Europe and Africa, reporting that his father engaged in actions in North Africa, then moved to Sicily and up the Italian peninsula, finally fighting his way through France and ultimately Germany. He also notes that he was wounded a second time in 1945 on the France/Germany border when he was shot in the hip. He was in a Paris hospital when the war ended.\n\nMartin married Agnes Regina Heavey on May 22, 1948, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Martin and Agnes had six children (Mary Ann, Jane, Martin Jr., Noreen, and twins, Patrick and Regina.). The 1950 census indicates that the family, including a daughter, Mary, lived at 389 Schenectady Avenue in Brooklyn and that Martin was a city policeman. Rochford spent 23 years as an officer with the New York Police Department. As per his son Patrick, the bulk of his time with the police force was spent at the Brooklyn Supreme Court attached to Judge Lefkowitz; he retired from that assignment. In 1988, Martin and Agnes lived at 2068 Brown Street in Brooklyn.\n\nAt the time of his death in 1995, he and Agnes had been married for 47 years; they are buried together at Green-Wood. His son relates that his father rarely spoke of his wartime experiences. He said, “I know he must have seen horrific things in his four years overseas but if it affected him, he never let on. He deeply loved his wife and children and spent every day proving it. He was the epitome a a family man and we all miss him dearly.” Section 8, lot 44609, grave 238.\n\nROHLFS, HENRY WARREN (1920-2014). Private, 1st Armored Division, United States Army. Warren (as he was referred to by his family and others) was born in Brooklyn to parents Henry Richard Louis Rohlfs and Charlotte Dorothea Marie (Patsie) née Pruchnow when they were forty-three and twenty-four years of age, respectively. Henry, the father, was born in New York to German immigrant parents; he was married at age twenty and had a daughter from this marriage, Henriette, who was about nineteen or twenty years old when Warren was born.\n\nIn 1922, just ten days after Charlotte gave birth to Donald Frank, Warren’s younger brother, she passed away. Days before her death, Charlotte, apparently contemplating death, wrote a letter to Warren, anticipating that she might not live to see Warren grow up. In the letter Charlotte expressed her love for Warren and wrote of the life she wished for him:\n\nWarren my little son – you are the joy of my existence – I pray for you night and day that you shall be a wonderful man and happy. I want you happy with just enough trouble to make you broad & big. Be clean in body and in mind. Believe this to be true in spite of what anyone else tells you: that for your own peace of mind and the happiness of the girl you marry and those you love keep clean – and as pure as you expect her to be. Oh! God you’re such a little fellow – You have the world to battle yet.I pray God will take care of me so that in my humble way I can lead your baby hands aright and see you well on the path towards a brilliant career whereby your fellow man will profit.\n\nWhy do I write this and cry, cry, like a heartbroken? Surely God will take care of me and I’ll bring another precious bundle home like I did you, you who tells me now you’ll help me take care of the “baby” when it comes, with your face all lit up in a wonderful glow. Two years old – I can hardly believe it. My baby no more – I love you.\n\nIn the years to come, Warren would lead an adventurous and impactful life, filled with travel, a passion for race car driving, sailing, and invaluable time spent with his family; a life his mother Charlotte would have been proud to see.\n\nPer the 1925 state census, the Rohlfs family lived in Brooklyn at 157 85th Street. Henry Rohlfs was forty-nine and worked in hardware. Henriette was now twenty-four and did housework, Warren was five and a student, and Donald, the youngest, was two years old. The family also had a housemaid, Selma Klaahs, who was twenty-eight years old and originally from Germany. All members of the family and the maid were American citizens.\n\nAccording to the 1930 census, the family continued to live at the same address. Henry Rohlfs owned the family home, valued at $35,000, and worked as a hardware merchant. His daughter, named as Etta C., was single; Warren, now aged ten, and his younger brother Donald, both attended school and all the family could read and write. Selma Klaahs, who spoke English and had been in the United States since 1923, continued to work for the family as a maid and cook. In the fall of that same year, Warren travelled to Germany. Ship records show his return trip to New York from the city of Bremen on September 22 aboard the S.S. Bremen that carried a total of twenty-nine passengers, twenty-seven of whom were immigrants with only Warren and a one-year old boy listed as United States citizens. A photograph from Warren’s trip to Germany, possibly taken at the Berlin Zoo, shows him wearing glasses and comfortably posing while holding a lion cub curled up in his lap.\n\nThe 1940 federal census reports that the Rohlfs family had moved to 9229 Shore Road in Brooklyn. The household now included just Henry Warren and his two sons; Henriette, listed here as Etta C., was married but lived in the same building. Henry Warren worked sixty hours a week at his own hardware store and Warren, who was nineteen years old and had completed the fourth year of high school, worked there as a helper, with an income of $570. Donald, the younger son, attended school and had completed three years of high school.\n\nIn 1941, Warren Rohlfs, twenty-one years old, registered for the draft. The records describe him as white, 5′ 7″tall, 168 pounds, with gray eyes, brown hair and a dark complexion. Rohlfs reported that he worked as an assistant production manager at Brewer-Cantelmo Company Incorporated at 116 East 27th Street in Manhattan; the company, still in operation today, creates hand-made, custom presentations. Rohlfs home address was still on Shore Road and his sister, named here as A.E. Delmhorst, was listed as his next of kin. Rohlfs enlisted in October of that year at Camp Upton in Yaphank, New York.\n\nWarren Rohlfs served for four years in Africa, Italy, and Ireland and was awarded the Purple Heart for injuries received at Kasserine Pass. The Battle of Kasserine Pass in North Africa was the first time the American Army engaged in battle with the armed forces of Nazi Germany. After an initial defeat, the American forces, along with British reinforcements, held the exits through the mountain passes of Western Tunisia and defeated the Axis forces. In August 1942, he was admitted for treatment of bursitis at an aid station. The records of that treatment note that he was a member of the Signal Corps.\n\nIn 1947, Warren married Jeanne Russo, a daughter of American and Canadian parents, and a graduate of St. Angela Hall in Brooklyn and Marymount College, Tarrytown. The wedding announcement in the New York Herald Tribune includes a photograph of Jeanne from the wedding which took place at St. Patrick’s Cathedral; Warren’s brother Donald was his best man. The wedding reception was held in the main ballroom at the New York Biltmore Hotel.\n\nWarren and Jeanne had four children: H. Warren Jr., Francis, Susan and Jaclyn. In 1958, Warren and Jeanne took a trip to Paris; travel records show their return to New York from Paris aboard the Trans World Airlines Flight 8751. These records also indicate that the couple lived in New Rochelle, New York, for some time after they were married and obituary records indicate that the couple spent 35 years together in Larchmont, New York, raising their four children.\n\nRohlfs ran F. A. Russo Incorporated, a photography business that served the advertising and media businesses of New York City. He was also commander of the American Legion Post 209 in New York City, and a member of the New York Sales Executives Club, the Toastmasters Roughriders Club, and served on the board of Junior Achievement of New York.\n\nWarren’s life was filled with family gatherings, an avid interest in race car driving, and sailing. He was an amateur race car driver and had a race car called Lotus; in a photograph, he is seen standing proudly alongside it with his children sitting in the car. He was also a founding member of the Madison Avenue Sports Car Driving and Chowder Society, a group that continues to meet in New York City to share their love for sports and automotive competition. Warren shared his passion for race car driving with everyone from celebrity race car enthusiasts to people who just needed some encouragement. In a message posted online in response to Warren’s obituary, Robert McGoey wrote:\n\nI met Warren Rohlfs when I was in high school in New Rochelle and he was racing a Lotus Eleven along with his partner Walter Cronkite. His encouragement to a young person resulted in a life long interest in sports car racing and my career of racing that lasted almost thirty years. I will never forget the look on the face of the gas station attendant in Larchmont when we pulled in to fuel in anticipation of a visit to race the next day at Bridgehampton. What a great guy.\n\nRohlfs also enjoyed sailing. A a family photograph from the early 1980s shows him aboard a Boat, “A Rainy Day,” with his brother Donald. In 1989, five years after his wife Jeanne passed away, Rohlfs retired to the open waters of the Pamlico River in Washington, North Carolina.\n\nIn 1995, at the age of seventy-five, Warren married Anne Stuart Harrington (nee Parker) in Palm Beach, Florida. In 2007, they moved to The Villages in Florida, where he enjoyed poker games and golf. He continued to enjoy spending time with his family and rented a beach house in the outer banks for many family reunions. In 2010, his last beach side family reunion was near Daytona Beach, Florida.\n\nWarren Rohlfs passed away in Florida at the age of ninety-four and a family service was held at Green-Wood Cemetery. On his gravestone, is inscribed, “Beloved Pop.” He was survived by his wife Anne, his children Warren, Frank, Susan and Jaclyn, stepsons Anthony and M. Neil Harrington, nine grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren. His wishes, according to his obituary, were that “you take someone special to dinner and express your love and appreciation for them.” Section 206, lot 32416.\n\nROMEO, JOSEPH (or GUISEPPE) (1910-1994). Rank unknown, unit unknown, United States Army. According to the New York City Birth Index, Romeo was born on September 9, 1910 in Manhattan. His first name is recorded as Giuseppe. As per the 1930 federal census, Joseph lived with his parents, Joseph and Catherine, and two brothers, Louis and Jack. Both of his parents had been born in Italy. Joseph, our subject, worked as an upholsterer in the furniture business. The Romeo family lived at 1159 40th Street in Brooklyn.\n\nAs per the Department of Veterans Affairs BIRLS (Beneficiary Identification and Records Locator Subsystem) Death File, Romeo enlisted in the service on December 21, 1942 and was discharged on December 15, 1945. Although the BIRLS record states that his birth date was August 31, 1910, in contrast to the New York City record, the enlistment and discharge dates are most likely accurate as his Social Security number and date of death on the BIRLS file correspond to other documentation. Unfortunately, there are no records of what branch he served, his unit, or place of service. His son shares that he is a veteran of World War II.\n\nIf in fact he sometimes reported a date of birth of August 31, 1910, then he is the Joseph Romeo who registered for the draft on October 16, 1940. At that time, he reported that he was living at 1159 40th Street in Brooklyn. He subsequently updated his Brooklyn address to 1305 38th Street and then 1171 39th Street. He designated his father, also Joseph, as next of kin, and reported that his employer was Harry Danziger on 42nd Street in Manhattan. As per the draft registration card, Romeo was white, 5′ 8″ tall, weighed 145 pounds, had brown hair and eyes, and a dark complexion.\n\nAccording to the Find a Grave website, Romeo was married to Anne, who passed away in 2002.

Private first class, Unit 211, United States Army Air Force. Ralph was born in Brooklyn to a large family. His parents were Frank and Dora Ronzo; Frank was born in New Jersey to Italian immigrant parents and Dora was a citizen by way of marriage, having immigrated from Italy at about two or six years of age, depending on the records. Married in around 1913, Frank and Dora were already parents to four children, John, Michael, Frank, and Joe, when Ralph was born. At the time of the 1925 New York State census, the Ronzo family lived at 550 Kingston Avenue in Brooklyn; father Frank Ronzo was thirty-five and worked as a laborer in the junk industry; his wife Dora was twenty-nine; Ralph was three years old and had a younger sibling named Philip.\n\nThe 1930 federal census shows that the family continued to live at the same address. They rented their home for thirty dollars a month and had a radio. Frank worked as a boiler in a junkshop and the eldest son John worked as a delivery boy for a hardware company. The whole family was able to read and write and except for the youngest, all the children attended school.\n\nPer the 1940 census, the family now rented a home at 412 Rutland Road. They had two more children: a daughter named Christina and a son named Vincent. Frank Ronzo worked forty-eight hours a week as a watchman at a city hospital; Dora was a homemaker; John and Frank were laborers; Joseph was a porter for a city hospital; Ralph, now eighteen years old, was a new worker. The five eldest children, including Ralph, had completed school through the eighth grade while Christina had completed two years of school. Their second eldest son Michael, no longer appears in the family records and is likely to have passed away.\n\nIn 1942, Ralph Ronzo was a stock clerk when he enlisted for service. The enlistment records describe Ronzo as single, white and having completed two years of high school. His 1945 draft records indicate that Ralph was twenty-three years old, 5′ 3″ inches tall, 140 pounds, with blue eyes, brown hair and a dark complexion. His home address was listed as 554 Kingston Avenue, the same as that of his mother Dora, who was listed as his next of kin.\n\nRonzo served in England, France and Germany; during his service he was shot in the leg and had to spend a considerable amount of time recovering at a hospital. Unable to do much, he learned how to hook rugs, a skill that he would come back to later in his retirement years. For his service, Ronzo was awarded the Purple Heart, American Defense Service Medal, Bronze Star, Good Conduct Medal, and European-African Middle Eastern Campaign Medal. Ronzo was not alone in his commitment to military service; three of his brothers also served in World War II, one in the Navy and two in the Marines.\n\nIn 1946, Ronzo married Frances Reveruzzi, also a Brooklyn native. The couple had two children: Dorothy, who was born in 1948, and Rose Ann, born in 1949. The 1950 federal census tells us that the family lived in the lower level apartment at 2231 West 1st Street, in the Gravesend neighborhood of Brooklyn. As per these records, Raply had attended school through the eighth grade at P.S. 91, then Tilden High School, but hadn’t completed it; he was a general exterminator for a private employer, worked forty hours a week and had earned an income of $2,600 the year before.\n\nPublic records from 1974 show that Ronzo continued to live in the same neighborhood but moved about fifteen minutes away to 144 Avenue T. About a decade later, at the age of sixty-two or sixty-five, Ronzo retired from his position as exterminator for New York City Housing. He had seen his friends continue to work and never get an opportunity to enjoy their lives and he didn’t want the same to happen to him. In his retirement years, Ronzo started hooking rugs, the same skill he had picked up during his hospital recovery while in service. He also learned to make handmade frames and those frames can still be found on the walls of his family’s homes. In 1996, Ronzo and his wife celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. When Ronzo passed away just about a month short of his eighty-eighth birthday, he was survived by his wife Frances (who died in 2020 and is interred at Green-Wood with him), his daughters Dorothy and Rose Ann, and his grandchildren Robert, Deborah, Jennifer, Lisa and Alex.
