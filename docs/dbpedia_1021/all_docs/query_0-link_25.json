Forces B-24 Liberator combat units during World War II including variants and other historical information. Heavy bomber training organizations primarily under II Bomber Command in the United States and non-combat units are not included.\n\nThe USAAF took delivery of its first B-24As in June 1941, although the B-24D was the first production model delivered in quantity in July 1942. B-24s were assigned to every combat Air Force; at peak inventory, the USAAF had 6,043 B-24 Liberators operating worldwide in September 1944.\n\nFollowing the end of World War II, the Liberator was rapidly withdrawn from USAAF service, being replaced by the Boeing B-29 Superfortress. Literally thousands of Liberators were flown to various disposal units where they were cut up for scrap. Some brand-new late-production B-24Ms from Convair/San Diego and Ford/Willow Run were flown directly from the factory to various reclamation sites such as the scrapyard at RFC Kingman, Arizona in 1945, as the war in Europe had ended and B-29s were doing most of the long-range bombing work in the Pacific.\n\nOnly a few Liberators were still around when the United States Air Force was formed in 1947, most of them being used for various research purposes. The last USAF Liberator, a Ford EZB-24M-20-FO serial number 44-51228 used by the Aeronautical Icing Research Laboratory for ice research, was struck off the rolls in 1953. For a time, it was on display at Lackland AFB, Texas, with the armament and gunner positions restored. It is currently at the American Museum at Duxford Aerodrome, England painted as 44-50492, a B-24M that was assigned to the 392d Bombardment Group, 578th Bombardment Squadron.\n\nNinth Air Force\n\nIX Bomber Command operated Liberators from airfields in Egypt; Libya and Tunisia during the Western Desert Campaign (1942â1943). Transferred B-24s to Twelfth Air Force in October 1943; reassigned to England to become tactical air force supporting American First Army (IX Tactical Air Command), Third Army (XIX Tactical Air Command), and Ninth Army (XXIX Tactical Air Command).\n\n98th Bombardment Group\n\n98th Bombardment Group\n\nDeployed to Middle East July 1942, First B-24Ds to be deployed overseas (Halverson Detachment). Stationed in British Palestine, Egypt, Libya, Tunisia. Participated in August 1, 1943 Attack on Ploesti Oilfields, Romania.Transferred to Twelfth (October), then Fifteenth Air Force, November 1943.\n\n343d Bombardment Squadron\n\n344th Bombardment Squadron\n\n345th Bombardment Squadron\n\n415th Bombardment Squadron\n\n376th Bombardment Group\n\n376th Bombardment Group\n\nDeployed to Middle East October 1942. Stationed in British Palestine, Egypt, Libya, Tunisia. Participated in August 1, 1943 Attack on Ploesti Oilfields, Romania.

Operated B-24s in Algeria, Tunisia and Sicily. Transferred Liberators to Fifteenth Air Force in November 1943, becoming tactical air force in Mediterranean Theater of Operations (MTO) primarily supporting Fifth Army (XII Tactical Air Command) in Italy, also operating in Southern France and Germany supporting Seventh Army.\n\nTwelfth Air Force had several B-17 Flying Fortress groups which were transferred from VIII Bomber Command in England when the command was formed in the fall of 1942. In Tunisia, the Liberator-equipped 98th and 376th Bombardment Groups were briefly transferred from Ninth Air Force in October 1943 to the command. All of Twelfth AF's heavy bomb groups were reassigned to Fifteenth Air Force in November.\n\nFifteenth Air Force\n\nActivated in Tunisia on November 1, 1943. Primary strategic bombardment Air Force of the Mediterranean Theater of Operations (MTO) operating from airfields in Southern Italy. Had 15 B-24 groups. Bombing raids against targets in Italy, then took part in raids on Germany, Austria, Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Romania.
