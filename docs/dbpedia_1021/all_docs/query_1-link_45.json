        "text": "I joined the 497th Sq. In July, 1944 directly after graduation from flying school at Douglas, AZ. I was assigned as co-pilot on Capt. Catlin's crew and flew with him until he was returned to the states. I was a general \"gofer\" after that and remember serving as sqdn. training officer and assistant operations officer for a while. I probably had one of the longest tenure in the group as I was not sent home until the fall of \"45 from our base at Schleissheim, Germany. 1st Lt. Robert G. Stonum I am Lt. Don Conley, pilot assigned to the 322nd Bomb Group, 451st Bomb Sqd. Captain Sterngold was flight commander. Col. Henry C. Newcomer was Squadron Commander and later became an Army General. I flew the number 2 position numerous times. I was never shot down, but many times had severe battle damage. Flew the 150th mission on Clark's Little Pill. Never lost a crew member in flight. Lost original co-pilot Charles Harris on a mission with another ship. He was a Pawnee Indian and an exceptional pilot. I've tried to attend our squadron reunions but am not able to attend every one. I would love to hear from anybody in the squadron as I am putting together a book of stories about our exploits during WWII. I finished WWII with over 50 missions.\n\nMy original crew consisted of Charles Harris, co-pilot, John Sloan, bombardier, John Garcia, engineer gunner, Walter Olson, radio gunner and Carl Hendrickson, tail gunner.\n\nI have contact with several former squadron members and am currently writing my memoirs about life after the war stateside. I was involved as VP of McDonald's Corporation. I personally flew Ray Kroc many times building the fledgling company and went on to become the franchise director. I was also deeply involved in the marketing and promotion of the company.\n\nI currently reside in the Palm Springs, CA area and am a member of The Palm Springs Air Museum. I have the deepest heart-felt regard for the US Air Force in WWII and would love hear from my brothers-in-arms. You can contact me.\n\nAll for now,\n\nDon Conley"
