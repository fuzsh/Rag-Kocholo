        "text": "Jimmy Stewart suffered such extreme PTSD after being a bomber pilot in World War II that he acted out his mental distress during ‘It’s a Wonderful Life’. Stewart played George Bailey in the classic movie and channeled his anger and guilt into the scenes where he rages at his family.\n\nStewart was haunted by ‘a thousand black memories’ from his time as an Air Force commanding officer that he took with him back to Hollywood after the war. Pilots who flew with him said that became ‘Flak Happy’ during World War II, a term to describe what is now known as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, or PTSD.\n\nStewart wrestled with the guilt of killing civilians in bomb raids over France and Germany including one instance where they destroyed the wrong city by mistake.\n\nStewart felt responsible for the death of his men and especially one bloodbath where he lost 13 planes containing 130 men who he knew well. Stewart’s anguish is laid bare for the first time in author Robert Matzen’s Mission: Jimmy Stewart and the fight for Europe, published by Paladin Communications.\n\nStewart never spoke about it, even to other veterans, and bottled up his emotions that came out in the acting parts he chose when he returned to Hollywood. He acted it out during It’s a Wonderful Life, where character George Bailey unravels in front of his family – the emotional core of the film after a lifetime of setbacks, including being unable to go to war while his brother becomes a decorated hero.\n\nFilms like Shenandoah and Winchester 73 allowed Stewart to explore his dark side which was never there before he went to war.\n\nMatzen writes that Stewart’s decision to join the military was less surprising than his decision to become an actor; his grandfather fought in the Civil War and more distant relatives fought in the Revolutionary War. His initial attempts failed because he was too skinny, despite trying to fatten himself up on ice cream and chocolate bars. Stewart was finally called up shortly before the assault on Pearl Harbor in 1941 which forced America into the World War II.\n\nAsked by a studio boss why he wanted to give up his life in Hollywood, Stewart said: ‘This country’s conscience is bigger than all the studios in Hollywood put together, and the time will come when we’ll have to fight’. Stewart was initially put in the Air Force Motion Picture Division because commanders wanted to use him to make films to convince more airmen to sign up.\n\nHe was also used for PR stunts until he demanded that he see combat like other airmen. Stewart’s chance came with the creation of a B-24 bomber group, the 445th, and he was appointed commander of the 703rd squadron. After 20 missions, the stress began to take its toll him and the only food that would stay in his stomach was peanut butter and ice cream.\n\nStewart did not leave the military and continued to serve until May 1968 when he retired after 27 years of service during which time he was a bomber pilot during the Vietnam War.\n\n####################################################################################\n\nMilitary Humor – Murphy’s Laws –\n\n#####################################################################################\n\nFarewell Salutes –\n\nEdward Albert – Milwaukee, WI; US Army Air Corps, WWII, PTO, Co.
