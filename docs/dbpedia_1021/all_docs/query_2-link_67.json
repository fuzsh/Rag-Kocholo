        "text": "Refueling in the Sky\n\nWhen the US Air Force needs aircraft refueled in mid-air, they turn to their primary fuel tanker, the KC-135. First flying in 1956, the Stratotanker has been keeping American air assets airborne for extended periods since the Vietnam War. Four turbofan engines mounted under the aircraft’s wings make it possible for the Stratotanker to takeoff at weights up to 322,500 pounds including fuel. The plane’s ability to refuel military aircraft midair for more than 50 years has proven it to be a tested, capable, and dependable refueler for the US Air Force and its allied partners.\n\nNever Forget in Utah\n\nThis KC-135E, named Never Forget, served with the Utah Air National Guard in Salt Lake City beginning in 1978. During its time with the 151st Air Refueling Wing (ARW), this aircraft assisted in the Guard’s mission to extend the global reach of the U.S. through refueling.\n\nNever Forget was the last remaining KC-135E assigned to the 151 ARW when it retired in 2009. On 21 May that same year, the aircraft flew to Hill Air Force Base, where it was then towed from the flight line to the Hill Aerospace Museum.\n\nBoom Operator\n\nMidair refueling with the KC-135 takes place using a “flying boom” operated by an Airman in the rear of the plane. These boom operators precisely attach the extended fueling hose to the receiving aircraft below, like a gas pump in the sky. Whether that aircraft is an F-35 or B-2, the KC-135 ensures Airmen can continue to execute their missions in the sky through fuel resupply.\n\nThis aircraft is on loan from the U.S. Air Force Heritage Program."
