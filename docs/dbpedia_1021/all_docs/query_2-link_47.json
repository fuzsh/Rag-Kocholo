Weber\n\ncopyright 2012 - 2024\n\n(revised: January 18, 2024)\n\nJoin the 460th Bomb Group on Facebook for more information\n\nFor updates to story and appendices after 1/19/2024 please visit\n\n460th-bomb-group.free.nf\n\nInsignia of the 15th Army Air Force\n\nThe two aircraft shown above are from the 460th Bomb Group, 763rd Bomb Squad as is evident from the tail markings which designate the 460th Bomb Group, while the yellow fuselage letters and engine cowls indicate the 763rd Bomb Squad. All four bomb squads in this bomb group had the same yellow and black tail markings but used different color letters and engine cowls to differentiate their squad. The 760th used blue markings, the 761st used red markings, and the 762nd used white markings. These aircraft also bear the Black Panther insignia or nose art of the 460th Bomb Group. The B-24 to the left has the olive drab color scheme prevalent early in the war, while the B-24 to the right has the natural aluminum finish predominant later in the war and which became the standard after April 1944, although many olive drab bombers continued to be produced for night, Lone Wolf, and troop transport use. Note that the aircraft on the left also has a lighter color, scalloped underbelly paint scheme which is indicative of manufacture at Ford's Willow Run Facility.\n\nForward\n\nI wrote this story several years ago and have added to it over time. It is an ongoing effort and a labor of love. Originally this work began as an effort to compile information about my dad's time in WWII and it grew to include information about the crew members, their experiences as prisoners of war, and what became of them afterwards. Eventually, my interest expanded to the history of the 460th Bomb Group and I am proud to serve as a sort of 460th Bomb Group historian. To that end I established the 460th Bomb Group on Facebook as a forum where members can search for answers and share information. I have compiled a significant amount of information and provide numerous appendices of 460th Bomb Group information at the end of this story. I believe this information is the most comprehensive and current information available online. My goal is to keep the memory of the 460th Bomb Group alive and to aid those seeking information and answers.\n\nI want to tell you about my dad's experiences in World War II, because I think it's important that they get passed along and recorded, and secondly because I am proud of his participation in that important part of our country's, and world's, history. He knew I felt that way because I told him so. All these years later, especially now that he's gone, that's one thing I'm so glad I did. I told him he was a hero. I remember that, incredulously, he asked me why I thought he was a hero. I told him because he had given everything that he had to give at the time to his country. It was, and is, the truth. Plain and simple, laid bare right then and there.\n\nIn his book The Wild Blue Stephen E. Ambrose included this poignant quote that has stayed with me as I researched and wrote this. It is attributed to P-51 fighter pilot Lt. Jefferson who provided his thoughts on bomber crews.\n\n\"Planes fell in flames, planes fell not in flames, an occasional one pulled out and crash-landed, sometimes successfully, sometimes they blew up. Men fell in flames, men fell in parachutes, some candlesticked (when their parachutes didn't open). Pieces of men dropped through the hole, pieces of planes ... Have you any idea of what it's like to vomit in an oxygen mask? ... These bomber guys had seen the inside of hell.\"\n\nBob Thompson tells another poignant story in his book Flying In Coffin Corner. A 97th Bomb Group airman had bailed out of his burning B-17 Flying Fortress after the aircraft had been attacked and was badly damaged by German Bf-109s from their nearby bases or Jagdgeschwaders. The Bf-109 was known more commonly by the Allies as ME-109. All the crew had bailed out and the aircraft was ablaze. One airman had jumped out the bomb bay and opened his chute too early. The chute hung up on the bomb racks or bay doors and he was left dangling in mid-air, flapping around in the slipstream. The burning plane flew on and the airman was doomed to a slow and agonizing death. Out of the fray came a German Messerschmitt, a dreaded Bf-109, known more commonly to the Allies as ME-109. The German fighter pilot dove directly into the formation weaving his way through the American heavy bombers. American gunners looked on stunned while the German maneuvered his plane into position near the doomed aircraft with its trapped and suffering airman. A short burst boomed from the German fighter's machine guns and the airman was mercifully put out of his suffering and certain horrid death. The German fighter peeled away. Time froze. All shooting had stopped, and the war was suspended briefly while the German flew out of the formation. The fighting then commenced in all its ferocity.\n\nStaff Sergeant Richard Lee Weber Crew at Chatham Field, Georgia, August 8, 1944\n\nThe picture of dad (above, left) was taken several years after he returned from the war. He donned his old uniform for a professional photograph. The original crew (above, right) was comprised of: standing (officers), left to right - Sam Hamilton (Pilot), Joe Rudolph (Copilot), Emmett Warren \"Bo\" Barger, Jr. (Navigator), and John Murphy (Bombardier); and kneeling (enlisted men), left to right - Robert \"Bob\" Seidel (Nose Gunner), John Bills (Tail Gunner), Harold \"Hal\" Adams (Flight Engineer & Top Turret Gunner), Otto \"Tex\" Mattiza (Left Waist Gunner), Delbert \"Dana\" Satterfield (Ball Turret Gunner), and Richard \"Dick\" Weber (Right Waist Gunner).\n\nMy father, Richard Lee Weber, Sr., serial number 35216570, flew bombing missions as a waist gunner from a remote airstrip in Spinazzola, Italy all those years ago. As a waist gunner, he was one of two fellows who stood at an open bay window on each side of their four-engine plane and shot at enemy fighter planes with a belt-fed .50 caliber machine gun. He fired from the right side of the aircraft and his view would have been like that in the picture below. As a waist gunner, at times he would also have been responsible for dispensing thin strips of shredded metal codenamed \"window\" and more often called \"chaff\" to confuse enemy radar. As the ship's armorer, dad was trained in the maintenance of all gun positions and bomb racks, and along with the bombardier was responsible for arming the bombs. At altitude the temperature could easily be 20 or 30 degrees below zero with near gale force winds coming in through the waist gunner's open window, causing frost to form on his machine gun, ammo boxes, and interior surfaces. If a crew member touched metal with his bare hands he risked leaving skin behind. There was no armored plating protecting the waist gunner's position; in fact the \"Pureclad\" aluminum skin separating him from the outside world was so thin you could push a screwdriver through it. Pureclad was an aluminum sheeting material that had a pure aluminum core and an exterior corrosion resistant aluminum alloy coating. At times, when the German fighter planes were attacking the bombers, the spent .50 caliber shell casings accumulated on the floor of the aircraft so deep the spent cartridges had to be shoveled out after the mission. Martin Middlebrook describes times like that in his very informative book The Schweinfurt-Regensburg Mission. Middlebrook indicates that after periods of extended shooting a waist gunner's face would be brass colored due to a fine brass powder that was ground off the shell casings as they entered and were ejected from the machine gun's receiver.\n\nI suppose, all said and done, dad was like the thousands of other young men who came from every American city, town, and farmyard in answer to their country's call and spurred on by outrage over Pearl Harbor and reports of the growing atrocities by the mad man in Germany, but to me he was different - he was my dad. He was part of a much larger effort, one that united the country and mobilized its citizens and industry. Citizens turned soldiers in droves. The largely untapped pool of labor, the American women, gave their all to take seats at workbenches or to stand on the assembly line, some served more directly in the war effort and donned military uniforms in the various armed forces branches. Industry retooled entire factories or built new ones to meet the demands of the US and its allies for equipment and munitions to beat back the Axis forces sweeping across Europe and the Pacific. President Roosevelt established the War Production Board which evolved over the course of the war to regulate industrial production for the war effort. The nation was committed to the war effort and what was referred to at the time as \"The Arsenal of Democracy\". There was no other time like it in US history. Industries stepped up to meet the demands of war. Production of automobiles ceased on February 22, 1942, but the auto industry stayed as busy as ever. Ford equipped itself to become a massive manufacturer of bombers, other auto manufacturers made jeeps, tanks, and even torpedoes. Small companies that previously made trinkets were called upon to make components for more sophisticated equipment like bomb sights. Companies that used to produce stockings now churned out parachutes. Even Frigidaire began making .50 caliber machine guns instead of refrigerators. All these products and supplies made the trek across oceans to the war fronts, just as the soldiers did.\n\nManufacturing was not the only industry to undergo redirection as a result of the war. Legislation such as the early 1942 Emergency Price Control Act granted the Office of Price Administration the authorities needed to set price limits and impose rations on food and other commodities. The War Food Administration was established in 1943 to oversee agricultural production and establish quotas designed to regulate quantities of foodstuffs and crops to ensure war needs were met as the nation's first priority. During the course of the war four series of various colored ration stamps were issued to address limited resources. Ration stamps became an aspect of every citizen's life. The ability to purchase sugar, coffee, meat, cheese, fats, canned fish, canned milk, and even gasoline and rubber products, if and when those items were even available, depended on the use of limited ration points. Cash of course was still required as stamps had no real monetary value, so if you had cash but no stamps you could not purchase a rationed item, at least not legally. At one point, blue ration points were used for acquiring bottled and and dried foods, while red points were used for meat, fish, and some dairy products. Points required for a particular item varied over time depending on how scarce the item was. A black market evolved around ration stamps and it was not long before forged stamps were discovered.\n\nSugar and rubber products were highly controlled because the war in the Pacific theater significantly restricted their production and availability. Sugar production was further impacted by a poor sugar beet crop yield in the United States and would be continued to be rationed even after the war. Some sources indicate that one of the reasons gasoline was rationed was to reduce driving to minimize wear on rubber tires. Rationing hardships, victory gardens, conservation, recycling and war bonds drives, and redirection of manufacturing and agricultural efforts formed the backdrop of life on the homefront, while far away on various continents wartime activities were being formulated and implemented, made possible to a large extent by the preparations and sacrifices of the everyday citizens back home. Of course, military personnel and bases endured hardships and lack of resources both due to scarcity and the changing logistics involved in delivery.\n\nThe Spinazzola airbase where dad was ultimately stationed was located in the province of Barletta-Andria-Trani in the Apulia (Puglia in Italian) region and was part of the larger Foggia Airfield Complex, a series of nearly two dozen bases and numerous auxiliary fields within a 25 mile radius of Foggia, Italy. Dad was an airman in the 15th Army Air Force, 55th Bombardment Wing, 460th Bomb Group, 763rd Bomb Squad and was part of the Samuel Marlin Hamilton crew. There was no separate Air Force branch at that time. Headquarters for the 15th Army Air Force was located in Bari, Italy. Foggia and Bari are both towns in the Puglia region and not too distant from Spinazzola. The 55th Air Wing was headquartered in Spinazzola and was comprised of the 460th Bomb Group located near Spinazzola, the 464th and 465th Bomb Groups both located near Panatella, and the 485th Bomb Group located near Venosa. These bomb groups flew B-24 Liberators, classified as heavy bombers, to targets in Nazi- and Axis-occupied Europe.\n\nAs for the bombing missions themselves, the American bombing campaigns differed significantly from those of its British allies - the Americans bombed in broad daylight, a practice known as daylight precision bombing, while the British bombed in the cover of darkness. The targets of the American air force were tactical and consisted of military, industrial, economic centers, and infrastructure, while the British targets were strategic and selected to impact the morale of the German people with the intent to demoralize the populace and pressure Axis leaders to bring the war to an end. However, the British did not begin the war bombing civilian population centers, in fact early in the war great care was taken to avoid bombing civilians. At one point bombing was even limited to harbors and ships at sea to ensure civilians were not bombed. Later in the war, the rationale became more of seeing little distinction between the factories, war machines, and supplies and the workers who manned the factories and produced the war materials. Consequently, America did bomb civilian population centers as not only designated targets but as targets of opportunity when primary and secondary targets were not viable. Civilians were also bombed inadvertently due to their proximity to tactical targets. Of course, the Germans bombed civilian centers and the debate will never be settled as to what side bombed civilians first. Since the British bombed at night, bombing accuracy was not as important when compared to the American bomber missions since the British targets were not tactical objectives like single point, discreet targets such as railroad marshalling yards, troop concentrations, oil production facilities, and aircraft and ball bearing factories. As a result, one source indicates the British bombsight looked like it cost about three dollars to manufacture and was entirely unlike the sophisticated and complex American Norden bombsight. The British targeted cities and towns and inflicted heavy casualties on the civilian population and workforce. Early on in the war the American philosophy of daylight precision bombing was under heavy scrutiny by top levels within the United States and British military organizations and at risk of being reversed due to high crew and aircraft losses. American General Ira Clarence Eaker was a vocal proponent of precision bombing in contrast to British Air Marshall Sir Arthur Harris. Harris was known as \"Bomber Harris\" to his countrymen and as \"Butcher Harris\" to the Germans for his bombing of civilians. During one meeting Harris conceded to Eaker that the British saturation bombing did kill civilians but that while German targets hit by Americans would be rebuilt in a matter of weeks, it would take the Germans 21 years to replace one of his civilian targets. Eaker was attributed with his own great quote about his mission and strategy - \"Gentlemen, you've been telling me my plan is impossible. The difficult we'll do immediately. The impossible will take a little longer\".\n\nOne concept that bomber advocates Harris and Eaker certainly shared was what was referred to as \"The Bomber Dream\". Keep in mind that aircraft had not made their mark as a strategic or tactical power in any war prior to WWII. Aircraft were used in WWI, but the technology was in its infancy and not fully developed on a scale necessary to impact the course of a global war. The Bomber Dream envisioned an aerial force of such magnitude, range, and destructive capability that its deployment and application could not only end wars, but obsolete them. Harris and Eaker shared this vision, but disagreed vehemently on the application of the bomber fleets. Others of the day merely saw the bomber fleets as support to ground and sea forces, while some others even thought of the air resources as just flying artillery. The course of WWII would change many of the positions of the naysayers, but as we know technology would continue to advance to the point of obsolescing the massive bomber fleets themselves and relegating their span of influence to a handful of years and the diminishing memory of history. While the Bomber Dream in its original sense may not have been achieved, the bombers of WWII did shorten the war and change history and I believe President Franklin Delano Roosevelt summed it up best when he stated \"Hitler built a fortress around Europe, but he forgot to put a roof on it\".\n\nTraining\n\nDad was an enlisted soldier from Columbus, Franklin Co., Ohio. He registered for the draft on June 30, 1942, but later enlisted as many did to ensure they would be considered for their choice of military service, the Army Air Forces. He entered into active service on April 12, 1943 at Fort Thomas, Kentucky. As a new recruit and air cadet, dad underwent a variety of testing to determine his experience and mental abilities. He sat for general classification exams, tests for mechanical aptitude, and radio aptitude. At the beginning of the war the Army Air Forces required that recruits were between the age of 18 to 30, had at least an 8th grade education, were no taller than 5 feet 10 inches, weighed no more than 170 pounds, and achieved a minimum classification score of 100. By the time dad enlisted, the physical requirements had been relaxed somewhat to allow those of up to six feet and weighing up to 180 pounds. This was done to broaden the selection pool.\n\nWhile dad did not qualify as a pilot, bombardier, or navigator, his scores qualified him for combat crew training as an armorer and gunner. He attended basic training as part of the 54th Training Group at Keesler Field, Biloxi, Mississippi where the focus was on physical training, military regimen, drills, marching, bivouacking, and some weapons training.\n\nWhile most crew members received gunnery training, except pilots and copilots who were exempted from such training, some enlisted members also received specialty training such as in armament, airplane mechanics, or radio operator mechanics. Their specialty training would define their main role on the aircraft, gunnery being a secondary role. Bombardiers and navigators received gunnery training if the training facility had capacity. Some enlisted airmen did not receive specialty training and were referred to as \"career gunners\". Dad attended Aircraft Armament Schools at Lowry and Buckley Fields, both in Colorado. In armament training dad learned the workings and assembly/disassembly of all gun types, how to strip a .50 cal. in one minute while blindfolded, how to accurately shoot pistols and .30 and .50 cal. machine guns. Special attention was paid to the aerial gunner's best friend, the Browning M2 .50 cal., affectionately known as \"Ma Duece\". This versatile heavy machine gun was designed by John Moses Browning himself towards the end of WWI and was the armament workhorse on the bomber fleet. Some airmen tell of how they were required to assemble a .50 cal. blindfolded and wearing gloves. He learned the details of the workings of the various turret types he may encounter on the B-24 models still in service. As an armorer, he learned about the various types of bombs and fuzes, how bomb and fuze type selection varied based on target characteristics, how to load bombs, and how to fuze them. He learned how to maintain and repair any malfunctioning weapon and armament system.\n\nA September 17, 1943 article in the Columbus Dispatch notes that after completion of gunnery school he entered aviation cadet training. On March 1, 1944 he received orders to report to Flexible Gunnery School at Tyndall Field, Florida to be trained on all aspects for his waist gun position. He was a Private First Class when those orders were received. Prior to March 1941 there was no separate school for flexible gunnery. However, the importance of the gunnery positions became more and more apparent since these were the airmen charged with protecting the aircraft and crew while under attack from enemy fights. Consequently, a five week flexible gunnery program was developed to provide customized training. He was a Private First Class at this time. Flexible Gunnery training differed from turret gunnery training because the gun was not fixed in relation to the gunner and the guns were attached by what came to be known as a flexible mount. The gunner swung the gun through its range of motion unlike the turret gunners whose guns rotated with them. At flexible gunnery school dad learned the workings and assembly/disassembly of .30 and .50 caliber guns and how to operate various sights such as the basic steel ring and end of muzzle bead sight as well as more sophisticated electronic optical sights which superimposed a lit ring on the target and compensated for speed of the gunner's aircraft. The latter was quicker to use and lessened eye strain. He learned how to determine the distance to an enemy aircraft based on the type of enemy aircraft (for length and wingspan) and how greatly the aircraft filled the sight picture. He learned how to sight moving targets by shooting clay pigeons from a moving truck or jeep. The clay pigeons were launched from towers of various heights to present a wide variety of angles to simulate combat conditions. He learned how to lead and follow through when both the target and the gunner were moving. He practiced shooting in both daylight and at night with tracer rounds. Although the .50 cal. machine gun could fire at a rate of around 1,800 rounds per minute, much attention was paid to ensure the gunner fired in short bursts to avoid overheating the gun and ruining the barrel. Eventually target practice entailed shooting from a moving aircraft at aerial targets and drogues pulled by another tow plane. Gunners were taught to recognize various aircraft, even if only a silhouette was presented. He also learned how to troubleshoot and repair 17 different alignment and malfunction issues associated with a .50 caliber machine gun. His training prepared him for the three essential and basic duties of a gunner - to sight, call-out, and defend against enemy aircraft.\n\nFinal qualification required 20 hits out of 100 rounds of .50 caliber ammunition on a moving target. Interesting to note is that altitude chamber training where the enlisted men were tested on the ability to function and deal with high altitude conditions eliminated more men than did poor gunnery skills. Following completion of all his training he was classified as an Airplane Armorer Gunner and as such he was qualified to serve as a senior armorer, aerial photographer, and waist gunner, which was his primary role during combat with enemy fighter planes.\n\nAfter Flexible Gunnery School, he received orders to report to Westover Field, near Springfield, Massachusetts for crew assignment. Here he learned what type of aircraft he would be assigned to. Likely options were the heavy bombers like the B-17 or B-24 to which about 90 percent of the airmen were assigned, but other alternatives included the medium bombers such as the B-25 or B-26. Dad was assigned the newest and most sophisticated bomber at the time, the B-24. He also learned who would be on their crew and met them for the first time. The crew was comprised of fellows from all walks of life across the United States. The officers were: Sam Hamilton, Pilot, from Alabama; Joe Rudolph, Copilot, originally from Rhode Island, but grew up in Massachusetts; Emmett Warren \"Bo\" Barger, Jr., Navigator, from Virginia; and John Murphy, Bombardier, from Massachusetts. The enlisted men were: Robert \"Bob\" Seidel, Nose Gunner, from Indiana; John Bills, Jr., Tail Gunner, from Tennessee; Harold \"Hal\" Adams, Flight Engineer & Top Turret Gunner, from California; Otto \"Tex\" Mattiza, Left Waist Gunner, from Texas; Delbert \"Dana\" Satterfield, Ball Turret Gunner, born in West Virginia, but grew up in Indiana; and Richard \"Dick\" Weber, Right Waist Gunner, from Ohio.\n\nThey were officially assigned crew positions and began to get to know one another. They were also given another physical since they were nearing the time to go overseas and into combat. The crew was given orders to report to Chatham Field, near Savannah, Georgia for Combat Ready/Overseas or Combat Crew training. Chatham Field was named after the Georgia county where it was located and at that time was a sub-base of Jackson AAF Base. The field was under the purview of the 1st Army Air Force whose mission was to train replacement crews.\n\nThe crew arrived at Chatham Field around June 15, 1944. This training usually lasted several weeks but varied based on need for replacement crews due to losses in the war theaters. Some sources indicate that the intensity or thoroughness of the training varied somewhat at times due to availability of aircraft, fuel, and ammunition. Here the crew began to function as a single, cohesive unit and started to learn to work effectively and to rely on each other's knowledge, training, and competence, the traits that might help them survive in a combat situation. While at Chatham they flew many hours, ran through their various check lists, and logged air time. They flew up and down the eastern coast, usually at altitudes less than 10,000 feet so that oxygen was not required. Once they flew to San Antonio, Cuba and spent a night. Flights to Cuba were called Rum Runs because most bombers came back loaded with inexpensive rum. They flew low over the surf at the Bahamas. John Murphy was even able to arrange some bombsight simulator training for the crew in an airplane hangar. They were able to view a huge moving map through the bombsight and get a basic understanding of all the factors that went into calculating the bomb drop. They also flew at night, much to the consternation of some crew members. However, Sam Hamilton's and Joe Rudolph's abilities impressed the crew and built the needed confidence in their pilot and copilot. They also practiced formation flying that would be the normal procedure during a real combat mission entailing close flight with numerous other aircraft. Flying a B-24 was tough work, that was one downside of the design. Flying required constant physical exertion by the pilot while attention was paid to the myriad of gauges on the console. Like most pilots and copilots, Sam and Joe worked out an arrangement to share the flying, trading duties to give the other a break every so often. Many pilots and copilots switched responsibilities every half hour or so.\n\nOverseas To War\n\nThey received orders in mid-August to report to Mitchell Field, NY to begin the journey overseas to join the war in Europe. They arrived at Mitchell Field on August 26, 1944. At Mitchell Field the crew was assigned a brand new B-24 bomber, serial number 42-50010. It was built in Fort Worth, Texas by North American, and the crew was very proud of the new aircraft. Pilot Sam Hamilton wrote home and told his family that the crew had decided to name their aircraft \"The Opp Daily - Strictly Front Page\" in honor of his Opp, AL hometown and local newspaper. This would have been an unofficial working name and probably never appeared as nose art on any aircraft the crew flew as the crew was not assigned a specific bomber once they were overseas. The crew had some leave time and got to visit New York and see the sights.\n\nThe enlisted men were all made corporals by mid-September and received orders to report to Grenier Field, New Hampshire. They were moving fast towards combat now and were only at Grenier Field briefly. The next stop was Gander Field, Gander, Newfoundland, the last destination on the North American continent before going overseas. They were at Gander Field for two or three days. While there, they learned they would be assigned to the 15th Army Air Force, although they did not know location or bomb group and squadron yet. They departed Gander in their new aircraft to fly to Lajes Field, Azores, off the coast of Spain, but some equipment malfunction caused them to return. Gander was experiencing bad weather so they landed at Goose Bay, Labrador. Their bomber was repaired and the next afternoon, they headed out for the Azores again. They were also loaded with cots to deliver overseas, so the crew got some sack time en route. Dad had somehow procured a mattress and slept in style compared to his crewmates. They arrived at Azores and stayed only briefly and departed to Marrakesh, Morocco. The war became much more real to the crew as they saw the wrecked German and Italian aircraft off the sides of the runway in Morocco. The detritus served as testament that this had been an active battle zone. I doubt the crew realized then that while the American crews counted their mission credits to achieve the required 35 or 50 missions to complete their tour, the German fighter pilots whose aircraft now littered the airfield had no such limits. They flew until they died in relentless pursuit of the Allied aircraft. The crew had about a day and a half of down time in Morocco and some of the crew made friends with the local ladies, exchanging American dollars, ballpoint pens, clothing, and just about anything else for the pleasure of their company.\n\nLeaving Morocco, they were provided sealed orders to be opened an hour after takeoff. They opened the orders as directed and learned they were going to Tunis, Tunisia. Tunis was the former home of the 15th Army Air Force before it moved to Italy and headquartered at Bari, Foggia Province, Italy on December 1, 1943. The 15th Army Air Force was formed by splitting the 12th Army Air Force and was initially commanded by General James Harold \"Jimmy\" Doolitle, famous for his post-Pearl Harbor raid on Tokyo. In November 1943 General Nathan Farragut Twining took over command and Doolittle then commanded the 12th Army Air Force. General Twining would remain the Commander of the 15th Army Air Force for the duration of the war in Europe and after the victory in Europe go on to briefly command B-29 bombing operations in the 20th Army Air Force in the Pacific Theater.\n\nDad and the rest of the crew of the Opp Daily - Strictly Confidential landed at a Tunisian airfield that had not long before been a Luftwaffe airbase and stayed the night in an adobe barracks. The next stop was Italy. By this time, the southern half of Italy was under Allied control. Patton beat Montgomery to Messina, Sicily on August 17, 1943 and that freed the way to the mainland. Italy was invaded by the Allies in Operation Avalanche via an amphibious landing beginning September 3, 1943 shortly after Sicily was fully Allied controlled and in a matter of days the situation changed quickly in southern Italy. The invasion was essentially a three-pronged attack in southern Italy with the third prong forces landing at Taranta, south of Bari. The British 1st Airborne Division easily occupied the important ports at Bari (on September 11, 1943) and Brindisi and British 8th Army troops scoured the area throughout September and into October 1943 and took control of the many airbases used by the Italians and Germans, including those around Foggia which was liberated on September 27, 1943.\n\nFoggia had been a hub for the Germans due to the presence of the various airfields and the nearby Port of Bari. Foggia had been bombed nine times by the allies, lastly on September 15, 1943. The armistice with Italy had been signed earlier, on September 8, 1943, but the bombing after that date was to destroy and contain German troop concentrations. A brief but interesting article appeared in various newspapers, even in the distant newspaper called The Age in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia on October 1, 1943. It talked about five unlucky Germans paratroopers who were engineers sent on a demolition mission to Foggia. They appropriated two cars and drove into Foggia intent on blowing up key buildings as the last step in the German withdrawal from the town. Unfortunately for them, they did not realize that the British had already occupied the town and were easily dispatch by riflemen before they could demolish their targets. The Australian newspaper referred to it as a \"Wild West Shootout\".\n\nThose captured bases would all become part of the 15th Army Air Force operations and they were extremely important, in fact their acquisition marked a turning point in the air war. Air bases in Italy greatly increased the range of bomber and allowed a deep penetration into the German heartland. Bombers previously flying from North African bases flew 900 miles to reach Munich or Weiner Neustadt, targets near the maximum operating range of the bomber fleet. Now at about 500 miles distance, these new Italian bases put important industrial targets and strongholds such as Munich and Vienna within easy range of the heavy bombers. Another great advantage of the proximity of the Italian bases to key German targets was increased meteorological report accuracy. Targets with range of Italian bases could easily be reconnoitered by weather aircraft in advance of the mission. Weather data was extremely important in planning and executing a successful mission.\n\nThe US Army Corp of Engineers repaired and converted the airfields to ones suitable for heavy bombers. Soon, instead of German Messerschmitts and Focke-Wulfs, there would be Allied bombers and fighters made from good old American steel and aluminum, many constructed on Ford assembly lines, rising to the skies from those same airfields. Although the Italian forces in southern Italy signed the armistice on September 8, 1943 surrendering to the Allied forces, the fascist forces in the north loyal to Mussolini continued to support Germany and the Axis forces. This resulted in a sort of civil war in Italy when the southern Italian regular troops, former Allied enemies now called \"co-belligerents\" instead of being considered full-fledged allies, joined causes with the Italian resistance fighters intent on destroying Germans and Italian fascists in aid of the Allied cause. An article of the time indicates that the co-belligerent status \"does not confer on her [Italy] any special rights or status. On the contrary, it is taken to mean that Italy is being given a chance to 'work her passage' and the final enforcement of the armistice terms will depend on how the Italians co-operate with the Anglo-American forces\". It goes on to indicate that the Allies' intent is to \"attempt to solidify the loyalty of the Italians to King Emmanuel\".\n\nLondoners read about Italy's co-belligerent status in the newspapers in late September and early October about the same time they read, on September 30, 1943 that the fall of Naples was just hours away. The Axis forces had been steadily pushed northward since the invasion and Rome was liberated on June 4, 1944. By the time dad arrived in Italy the active front had been pushed as far north as Florence and Pisa. Florence was liberated on August 4, 1944 and Pisa on September 2, 1944. When dad arrived the war was still being fought in northern Italy and missions were actively flown there. The fall of Naples and Foggia was the official end of Operation Avalanche. Once established, the 15th Army Air Force aided in the ultimate conquest of Italy via its missions to northern Italy, but its primary efforts were focused on targets in Germany, Austria, Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Romania. The 15th Army Air Force also flew missions in support of the invasion of southern France.\n\nThe crew of the Opp Daily landed at Gioia del Colle Airbase, about 35 miles north of Taranto. The airbase at Gioia had been captured earlier in the war by the British and now served in part as a supply depot and replacement center in support of the 15th Army Air Force. It was here that they learned they were assigned to the 460th Bomb Group. Sadly and to their dismay, they were relieved of the brand new plane they were so proud of and for which they had great hopes and plans. They learned they had merely shuttled the aircraft to the European Theater from the States. They had also learned the hard way the difference between replacement aircrews and the original or more tenured - new aircraft went to veteran crews, usually ones flying in lead position with radar navigation equipment and a Norden bombsight, not replacement crews. More lessons on this key difference would follow. I have not learned the disposition of the crew's original aircraft and it does not appear on the 460th Bomb Group's aircraft inventory list. I suspect it made its way to another bomb group.\n\nOn September 29th, the crew departed Gioia del Colle Airbase and flew in another aircraft the 40 or 50 miles to the 460th Bomb Group base in Spinazzola, near what is referred to as the spur on the boot of Italy. Their new home in Spinazzola was the headquarters of the 460th Bomb Group, one of the four bomb groups of the 55th Bomb Wing of the 15th Army Air Force. The 460th Bomb Group consisted of the 760th, 761st, 762nd, and 763rd Bomb Squadrons. Each squadron was typically comprised of 18 crews or 10 men or 180 men total, and 12 aircraft. A full formation from a bomb group would entail 36 aircraft, nine from each squadron. Their new base was one of the many air bases either captured from the Germans or constructed by the Army Corps of Engineers and which now comprised the Foggia air base complex. The wide flat agricultural plains in the Puglia and surrounding area where wheat was grown were ideal for new air bases and many of the nearby captured German and Italian bases had runways long enough for the heavy bombers. The 460th's base had an added advantage in that there was a small valley after the end of the runway. It was not uncommon to see heavily loaded bombers drop down into the valley and seemingly disappear after takeoff only to gain altitude and become visible once more.\n\nDad's crew was just one of 24 replacement crews to arrive at the 460th BG in September, another 24 would arrive in October. These seemingly large numbers of replacement crews were required as a result of losses as well as completion of the required number of missions. The crew's path from the United States to Spinazzola was similar to, but somewhat different than, the route the original crews flew when the Bomb Group had been first established and deployed to the European Theater in the first couple of months of 1944. Their route took them from Chatham Field, GA to Mitchell Field, NY to Morrison Field, FL to Waller Field, Trinidad, then across the equator to Brazil, then across the Atlantic Ocean and the equator once again on an 11 hour or so flight to Dakar, Senegal. From there it was onward to Marrakesh, Morocco, then over North Africa to Oudna 1 Air Base about ten miles southeast of Tunis, Tunisia, and then on to Italy.\n\nSpinazzola is a town in the Barletta-Andria-Trani province of the Puglia region. In English Puglia is known as Apulia and is the area that essentially encompasses the heel of the boot of Italy. The other provinces that comprise Puglia are Brindisi, Lecce, Taranto, and Foggia where the 15th Army Air Force headquarters was located. Some of these provinces also had towns or cities of the same name which added to the confusion for the new arrivals.\n\nUpon enlistment, dad and the crew signed papers that obligated them to the war effort for its duration and for six months following or until otherwise officially discharged. Now, after arriving at their new 460th Bomb Group base in southern Italy in October 1944, their intention was to meet that obligation by flying bombing missions for which they were well-trained in support of the Allied European campaigns against Hitler and the Axis forces. Somewhere along the way the enlisted crew members were promoted to Sergeants. Dad was ultimately promoted to a slightly higher rank and became the only Staff Sergeant on the crew. I suspect this was because of his added duties as Sr. Armorer and photographer. The fact that dad had worked for Curtiss-Wright Corp. as a final assembler in the Columbus, Ohio aircraft factory before the war may have given him an edge as well. I am sure dad's extra \"rocker\" stripe below his three upwardly pointing chevrons was in jeopardy at times due to his wild city-boy and volatile nature. I've seen stories about dad getting drunk with other crew members to the point of waving his Army-issued .45 caliber pistol around and had to be calmed down by his officers. Spirits often ran high in the war theaters. I've read about one incident where two officers did the same thing, actually firing through crew tents on one New Year's Eve. Dad had been a Golden Gloves boxer before the war and was not afraid of confrontation or of throwing or taking a punch. On one occasion he and Hal Adams had to build an outdoor volleyball court as punishment for some of their disruptive antics. Somehow dad kept his stripes and served as the senior non-commissioned crew member. Crew member John Bill's mentions in his memoirs that even though dad had his faults (i.e., being somewhat narcissistic and often speaking of his sexual prowess) that \"he was no coward\". Of course, for an unmarried city-boy in a foreign land to be somewhat boastful of his abilities with the ladies might hardly be considered a fault at the age of 20. I believe the \"no coward\" remark foreshadows dad's conduct in combat under extremely tense situations and is the reason a high honor was later convey upon him. More on that later.\n\nDescriptions of dad's aerial combat missions follow and the information used and often cited comes from many, sometimes conflicting, sources. I've done my best to present the most accurate depiction possible to document his missions and events until the end of the war in Europe. I've also included a significant amount of information about the events that followed dad's tenth mission, a milestone in my father's life, one that would become part of him the remainder of his years.\n\nOctober 1944\n\nFor the crew, newly arrived in Italy in late September, October at the 460th Bomb Group airbase near Spinazzola in southern Italy was a cold fall month full of rain and mud. October in Europe is generally regarded as the worst month for flying. For the crew this place was nothing like the Mediterranean paradise or sunny Italy image they had in their minds back in the States. Sadly, it was a foreboding of worse weather to come. Their base was not like many of the other bases, and especially not like the comfy quarters and nearby town amenities many of the \"Mighty 8th\" Army Air Force airmen experienced in England. Instead of inhabiting a base that had already been established, albeit perhaps previously occupied by former Axis forces, their base was still under unfunded construction having only recently begun to be carved out of muddy agricultural wheat fields and pastures. There were no built quarters to house them, no facilities, and no heat, instead they sheltered in mud-floored tents to keep them from the wind, rain, and snow.\n\nThe enlisted crew had been provided living quarters that consisted of a canvas tent that measured about 20 feet by 20 feet. It had no heater, no lights, and no floor, unless mud was considered a flooring material. After one rain, they awoke to find their shoes, boots, and other items washed toward one end of the tent due to the storm water that had come through, creating a swale in the middle of their tent. They quickly dug a small culvert around the upstream side and along the sides of their tent to divert future flows. Still, there was much down time as a result of the weather and the newly arrived crews busied themselves working on heaters for their tents. Most designs were modeled after those built by the more veteran crews. The damp chill increased and heightened the awareness of an impending winter and punctuated the need to construct and perfect the operation of their own makeshift fuel oil or aviation fuel heater and to find other ways to keep the cold and weather out. They built a heater out of a steel drumbarrel and some incendiary bomb canisters they found and used for stove pipe. Another metal drum was kept outside on a stand at sufficient elevation to provide good gravity flow and was used to store aviation fuel for the heater. The aviation fuel was pilfered from fuel storage and early on came from a fuel pipeline that was locked, but fortunately had a leaky valve. At the early stages of first establishment of the base, many of the first crews scavenged cooking fuel oil used in the mess areas. One of the crew acquired some copper tubing usually used for hydraulic lines on the aircraft and a shutoff valve and they were then able to feed and regulate the fuel, which was a great improvement and significantly contributed to the safety of the apparatus. The heater worked well and kept the damp and cold out of the tent. Somewhere along the way, they figured out how to get 220V power and found an appropriate bulb for light, although one of the crew nearly electrocuted himself while working with that high voltage. Crews did find one advantage of freezing weather - even the mud froze and could more easily be walked on.\n\nEven as sparse as accommodations were by the time dad and the crew arrived, conditions had been much worse for the original members of the 460th Bomb Group who arrived in December 1943 through February 1944. Steve Kuhn gives a little insight in a September 24, 2006 article in The North Platte Telegraph. Steve talks about finding his unerected tent dumped in the mud off the side of a rutted mud roadway in a pasture that looked more like a pond than the start of an airbase. He describes that he and the rest of the airmen first to arrive had three blankets apiece, but no cots and no beds. They gathered weeds and grass to spread over the mud so they could lay their blankets down. Kuhn mentions that the ship that was to deliver the bases' and headquarters' supplies had been sunk. Interestingly and somewhat humorous to note is that while basic equipment, facilities, and supplies were entirely lacking somehow the base had been delivered a vast supply of toilet paper. Now if only they had a latrine. Original crews had to straddle six inch wide deep trenches when nature called.\n\nWhat Kuhn most likely referred to about supplies having been sunk was a raid on the Port of Bari by 105 bomb-laden German JU-88s on December 2, 1943 while scores of ships were waiting in the harbor at Bari to unload. Numerous supply ships had arrived at the Port of Bari and carried the supplies, equipment, and aviation fuel necessary for establishing the 15th Army Air Force headquarters in Bari and many of the surrounding bases. The port was under British jurisdiction at the time due to its critical role as a through-point of supplies for Montgomery's 8th Army. There was no Allied air cover because the military leaders did not think the Germans had sufficient air forces within range to amass a meaningful aerial attack, even though German reconnaissance flights were often observed. The flights were not taken seriously and after a while not even fired upon. They were considered nuisance flights and distractions caused by the Germans. Little did the Allies know that what the German pilots observed was being reported and the reports of a packed and bustling harbor were being noticed by German leadership and military planners.\n\nThe German fighter-bombers came in from their bases in northern Italy and Yugoslavia just as darkness was falling around 7:25 PM. They scattered chaff, which the Germans called \"Duppel\" to confuse Allied radar and although they had aerial flares for target illumination to aid in the bombing, they did not need them because the entire port was brightly lit as the dock workers were working all night to unload the backlog of ships lined up gunwale to gunwale in the harbor. The devastating attack was the German's way of welcoming the 15th Army Air Force to Italy and letting the Allies know they were watched. It was clearly also payback for having been chased out of southern Italy just months before. Many of the JU-88s were undoubtedly the same aircraft that had flown just weeks before from the bases now being occupied by the Allies. Many ships were bombed and others caught fire from the proximity of other burning ships, burning debris, oil, and fuel. The raid was so devastating that it was called the \"Italian Pearl Harbor\" or \"Little Pearl Harbor\", but this raid got very little press for one very dark reason. One ship that was not directly hit but caught fire in the harbor inferno was the SS John Harvey, hull number 878, one of many liberty ships in the port. It had been built by the North Carolina Ship Building Company and launched less than a year earlier on January 9, 1943. Liberty ships were rapidly constructed and mass produced versatile cargo and troop transport ships used extensively in the war. 2,751 liberty ships were produced to plow the seas in support of the war effort. The SS John Harvey had been waiting in the port for five days while other ships were being unloaded around the clock. While the SS John Harvey may have looked like all its brothers and sisters in the port that day, it was very different. It carried a secret cargo the United States preferred not to become public knowledge; consequently, little information of the raid was released and what was released was downplayed. While the SS John Harvey was harbored and awaiting its turn to be unloaded, few knew of its top-secret cargo. The secret cargo in its dark hold was a weapon - enough liquid sulfur mustard gas to manufacture about 2,000 M47A1 100 pound gas bombs. Some reports indicate that the SS John Harvey carried actual gas bombs, other reports indicate it carried the chemical and bomb shells separately because the shells would not be filled with the chemical until shortly before the bomb was needed for loading due to fear of leakage. The chemical was mustard gas, a blistering agent outlawed by virtually all civilized nations. Nations which employed its use would be considered pariahs in violation of the Geneva Convention.\n\nRoosevelt had made clear his position on chemical weapons many times during the course of the war, even as early as December 1941 at the start of the war. On June 8, 1943 he stated quite clearly \"Use of such weapons has been outlawed by the general opinion of civilized mankind. This country has not used them, and I hope that we never will be compelled to use them. I state categorically that we shall under no circumstances resort to the use of such weapons unless they are first used by our enemies.\" Having the weapons available and deployed at fledgling air bases did not violate this position, but it certainly shows the readiness to employ such \"outlawed\" chemical force if provoked. It is both ironic and terrible that the weapons, while never used on the enemy, destroyed many Allied personnel and innocent civilians that day and over time due to the lingering effects of the concentrated chemical. Perhaps worse was the attempt, successful for many years, to cover up the entire event. Granted, the motive for cover up may have been to prevent the Axis forces from learning that the US had stockpiled chemical weapons in order that they would not do the same.\n\nOnce the SS John Harvey was ablaze the deadly garlic-scented chemical, a human pesticide, was released and began to spread in the water and air. Some volatized or evaporated and mixed with the smoke from the attack and spread with the breeze over the entire coastal and nearby inland area, wafting over villages and fertile fields that in the growing season would go on to produce olives and other foodstuffs consumed and distributed by the local farmers. The liquid form of the deadly chemical mixed with the oil and fuel in the water and coated the seamen and dock workers who had fallen or jumped into the water. There were significant casualties as a result of the raid itself and, further, as a result of the chemical weapon release. The release was kept secret and attending doctors were unaware of the affliction of the injured crews, workers, and civilians. Treatment that could have been administered to save lives was not provided because the cause of the affliction was not known. Simple measures such as removing chemical-laden clothing and bathing the patient were not performed. From a logistic perspective, the raid and aftermath delayed fully establishing and provisioning the bases for several months and the port was not reopened until February.\n\nThe SS John Harvey Burns and Emits Plumes of Smoke and Mustard Gas at Port of Bari\n\nIn total, during the course of the 25 minute raid, 28 ships were sunk or destroyed, three more were salvaged, and another 12 were damaged. Some sources indicate up to 1,000 military and merchant marine personnel and 1,000 civilians died as a result of the raid. Not one of the 105 German aircraft were downed. The results of the December 7, 1941 Pearl Harbor attack almost pale in comparison to the Bari utter devastation, especially when one considers that the Pearl Harbor attack was on an unsuspecting nation at peace while the attack at Bari was done by a known enemy intent on our destruction, one which had been regularly performing fly overs, in an active combat area, and on an armed and an otherwise battle-ready and war savvy foe. For many years afterwards, entire families were lost due to cancer, chronic and pernicious lung ailments, and other rare maladies perhaps attributable to the concentrated chemical exposure. I believe this is a case where the fast and furious victories over the past three months jaded military decision-making and sense of preparedness and created an environment of superiority and security.\n\nThe bombing of Bari had impacts on the establishment of the 460th Bomb Group. Ships laden with ground crew and support personnel and supplies that were originally destined for Bari had to be diverted to other ports as the Bari harbor and its facilities were being rebuilt and cleared of wreckage. As a result, the 760th Bomb Squadron docked at Taranto Italy on February 8, 1944, while the 761st, 762nd, and 763rd Bomb Squadrons docked at Naples on February 13, 1944.\n\nOf course dad and the crew would have known little of this background. The raid itself may have been talked about by some of the more tenured ground and air crews, those who arrived when the base was first established, but the chemical release would not have been common knowledge until pertinent military records were declassified in 1959, long after the war's end and the damage done. This is even though the US Chiefs of Staff issued a little publicized joint statement in February 1944 admitting to possession of the gas and emphasizing that its use would only have been for retaliatory purposes. Britain took a different tact - Churchill insisted that mustard gas casualties be listed as 'burns due to enemy action'. He feared Germany would gas English cities. Although records were declassified sixteen year after the raid, it wasn't until Glenn B. Infield published his 1971 book entitled Disaster at Bari that British and American veterans, merchant marines, dock workers, and civilians who suffered exposure took note. Britain finally acknowledged the incident and ultimately compensated surviving veterans by increasing their pensions. American Lt. Col. Dr. Stewart Francis Alexander played a key role in the days following the raid and had determined that mustard gas was the cause of the burns and respiratory issues. This then allowed those afflicted to be properly treated. His actions saved lives and he could have saved more had there been full disclosure from the start. Remarkably, by drafting a map of ship locations in the harbor and by locating on the map casualties and severity of burned patients he was actually able to determine the source of the gas as the SS John Harvey. When fragments of mustard gas shell cases were found there could be no further denial. His actions were ultimately recognized in Washington with a certificate of appreciation by the Surgeon General of the US Army in May 1988. Dr. Alexander noted in one interview years after the raid that the Germans knew about the gassing at Bari even before he did. Axis Sally, who regularly broadcasted to Allied troops from Germany, commented two or three days after the raid \"Well boys, how do you like being burned by your own mustard?\" Some recalled hearing \"I see you boys are getting gassed by your own poison gas.\"\n\nWith all the bad weather that kept dad and the rest of the crew inside as much as possible and the fact that the crew had still not been cleared as eligible for combat missions, they had a lot of spare time on their hands, despite the time they spent improving the tent and learning about life at a working combat air base. The crew welcomed the opportunity to squeeze in some gunnery practice when they could or to pick up some other new or refresher training or just to get to know some of the other airmen. If they were lucky, as a special diversion, they might find a way to get to headquarters in Bari to visit the PX and see the American Red Cross girls who served hot coffee, soft, warm donuts, and, better still, lipsticked smiles served with a side of perfume.\n\nPerhaps it was just the bad weather and the doldrums due to lack of activity that came with it, but the crew sensed there was no camaraderie, no esprit de corps in the Bomb Group. They felt that the veteran crews made no attempt to get to know them. There seemed to be no effort, even by the Group leadership, to build a team or to even share Squadron, Group, Wing, or 15th Army Air Force history, purpose, and accomplishments with the new arrivals. The sense that new arrivals were simply second class replacements pervaded the new arrivals and reinforced the feelings experienced upon having their original aircraft taken away and given to a veteran crew. This serious morale issue and the ever present Italian rain and mud were some of the things that the airmen remembered even after the war.\n\nThe new base life was different for some of the officers too. Sam Hamilton and Joe Rudolph spent a lot of time in formation training and learning the way things really got done in combat. Sometimes the crew would fly with them, but not always. Finally, they got the word that they passed their check-out flights making their crew available for combat missions. The weather was still bad and many missions were cancelled, but all knew that eventually the weather would break, as it always did, and a combat mission would be possible. Sure enough, on the evening of October 10th, the crew learned they were scheduled for their first mission the next morning. The briefing was scheduled for 6:30 AM.\n\nMission No. 1\n\nOctober 11, 1944, Wednesday. Target: Sauerwork Ordnance Depot, Vienna, Austria.\n\nJohn Bills's memoir has this mission as flown on October 10, 1944, but my research indicates it would have been on October 11th. The start of every mission began with a wakeup call and breakfast. Mission days and the butterflies that came along with them made many an airman stick to just coffee. Throwing up your breakfast while wearing an oxygen mask was as bad as it sounds. Even if it did freeze at altitude, it thawed on descent. The crews gathered their equipment, boarded trucks, and headed to the old barn which had been converted for military use to hear the mission briefing. Briefings provided information to the crew on the purpose of the mission, course information, size and composition of the task force, rendezvous point, initial point for the start of the bomb run, alternate targets, anticipated opposition, and weather conditions. Briefings began with a prayer by the chaplain and the various topics were presented by different personnel, such as the operations officer or the intelligence officer. This morning the intelligence officer showed the target and route on the large wall map and reported that the target was defended by 400 anti-aircraft guns. This was going to be a tough first run to one of the most strategic Axis cities.\n\nThe crew was assigned \"A for Able\" in the lagging position referred to as \"Tail-end Charlie\" where the least experienced crews flew to pay their dues. \"A for Able\" was the working name of the aircraft in military parlance. 460th Bomb Group aircraft, like most other aircraft, had radio-call designation or aircraft identification letters painted on the fuselage for identification purpose. \"A for Able\" would have had a large yellow capital \"A\" painted on both sides of the aircraft, yellow because that was the color code for the 763rd Squadron. Their Tail-end Charlie position was the last aircraft in the formation or \"box\" or subset of the formation and considered by many to be the most vulnerable position since it did not have aircraft behind it for coverage. Aircraft assignments were determined by the Squadron's Operations Office. Contrary to popular belief that crews had dedicated aircraft, any given aircraft was not flown by a single crew since crews needed to be rotated for rest and recuperation while the aircraft would fly daily if it was in operable condition. A kind Operations Officer would try to pair a crew with their preferred aircraft when possible, otherwise crews flew what was available. Many aircraft, especially those aircraft often assigned to a given crew were named by that crew and many bombers had customized art and typically the aircraft name painted toward the front, or nose, of the aircraft. Such aircraft would often be referred to by their crew-given name. Later in history, this artwork would become to be known as \"nose art\".\n\nA typical mission flight chart showing flight path from base to initial point to target and return. This chart is from the one of the 459th BG's missions to Bad VÃ¶slau. Text boxes with arrow leaders were added by this author for clarity.\n\nThose 400 anti-aircraft guns the crew was warned about in briefing meant there would be a lot of flak. Flak, the acronym for the German word \"Fliegerabwehrkanonen\" (meaning \"aeroplane defense cannons\"), is the burst of an anti-aircraft shell and is marked by a red and orange blast ending up in a thick, black puff of smoke in the sky. Anti-aircraft guns were modern cannons which fired shells that typically had projectile noses which were timed fuses that could be set, given the known shell velocity, so that the shell would explode at a desired altitude, hopefully near an aircraft. There were various calibers of flak cannons ranging from 12.7mm to 150mm. Perhaps the most feared and common caliber for air defense was the 88mm cannon. Its shells were slightly over three feet long, and the projectile itself weighed just over 20 lbs. The cannons could fire to an altitude up to around 49,000 ft. The 88mm shell was believed to be able to inflict damage sufficient to destroy an aircraft within 30 yards of detonation, and still inflict serious damage to 200 yards. The rate of fire is often seen quoted as three rounds per minute, but other sources indicate a rate of 15 to 20 rounds per minute. Some variability was likely a result of the experience of the flak cannon crew, which varied between 8 and 10 men. The 88mm cannons could be fired from a wheel-mount platform, a stationary cruciform platform, or a stationary \"V\" mount platform. For air defense, the cruciform mount was common and allowed the cannon to be rotated in any direction, while the \"V\" mount did not allow full rotation. Early on, sighting was done visually by optical instruments to determine range and elevation, but later radar control was introduced. Flak batteries were located in long \"flak belts\" which were installations of flak cannons over a wide geographic area, typically between envisioned the Allied aircraft approach and industrial targets. By this time in the war anti-aircraft fire was a tremendous concern for Allied bombers and accounted for the majority of Allied aircraft losses. Anti-aircraft batteries were concentrated around critical target areas more so than earlier in the war partly as a result of Axis forces having been pushed out of much of the Balkans. The Russians overran Bulgaria by September 8, 1944 and Romania had capitulated even earlier on August 23, 1944. Axis defenses and resources previously dedicated to those areas were then available for bolstering the defenses of more interior targets such as Vienna. Enemy fighter aircraft were still a threat and were often seen, but were not nearly as aggressive and numerous as previously in the war.\n\nEarly in the war, enemy spotters would gauge the elevation, speed, and course of the American bombers or similar information was received from German fighters engaging or trailing the formation. Searchlights and sound locators would be used to spot bombers during nighttime raids. Ordnance men would set the timed fuses accordingly for the desired altitude; the Germans had not perfected an effective proximity fuse as had the Allies. Later in the war, radar control was widely used to control the fire. Wurzburg A radar provided accurate data on the bomber formation. The information was processed through apparatus collectively referred to as the \"Predictor\" by the Germans (because the system was intended to \"predict\" where the aircraft would be when the shell reached it) and the \"Director\" or \"Fire Control Director\" by the Allies. The information combined other data that could affect projectile motion as well, such as muzzle velocity, ambient air temperature, wind direction, etc., and thereby provided the settings needed to prepare the gun and shell for firing. Interesting to note is that even though radar and its system of control was available, many still preferred the use of optical instruments for fire control and believed the results were better. Another technique for directing anti-aircraft fire or at least for providing the anti-aircraft gunners a fixed aim point was the Germans' use of what was referred to as a swarm of bees, not so jokingly referred to by aircrews as \"S.O.B.\" Swarm of bees was the result of the use of a special shell that would burst at a desired altitude and resulted in a puff of metal strips that would gently float or seemingly hang in the air for a while. Some believed that the strips also provided a sort of radar marker. In any event, a properly placed swarm of bees burst, such as in the flight path of a bomber formation, provided a nearly fixed point of aim and greatly improved anti-aircraft gunner accuracy.\n\nWhen the anti-shell exploded, hot, supersonic chunks and pieces of jagged, broken, and twisted metal shot off in all directions just like a fireworks shell, but with a steel burst instead of a beautiful aerial display. Some airmen called flak \"iron clouds\" or \"black mushrooms\". The sound was tremendous and could be heard as a sort of muffled \"krumph\" or crushing, crunching rumble sound even in the loud bombers. Some described the flak as being \"so thick you could walk on it\". The metal from a flak burst is called shrapnel. It is designed to destroy both planes and the people inside them. Sometimes the shrapnel penetrate one side of the aircraft and exit the other side, hitting nothing in between. Sometimes the shrapnel would pierce the thin skin of the aircraft and bounce around inside a bit. Sometimes, the worst of times, it would pierce one side and tear something inside apart. Maybe that something was mechanical, electrical, hydraulic, or human. Shrapnel was indifferent. The calculation was simple and intuitive - the more flak in the sky, the more metal there was whizzing around you.\n\n460th Bomb Group B24s in Flak B-24 Waist Gunners In Action\n\nThe black puffs, in the picture on the left, are where the anti-aircraft shells exploded sending shrapnel in all directions. German shells had fuses that were set by ground crews to explode at a calculated altitude. Fortunately, the Germans did not have the well-guarded American proximity fuse technology that allowed shells to explode when they detected a nearby aircraft or other target.\n\nA known area of intense anti-aircraft gun concentration through which the bombers must pass going to and coming from a mission was humorously (and ominously) called \"Flak Alley\" by the airmen. The German anti-aircraft guns were accurate to around 25,000 feet which is higher than the altitude from which the bombers could bomb with any reasonable amount of accuracy; consequently, there was no escape for the bombers and it was not unusual for fifty percent of the bomber formation to experience some amount of damage when flak was encountered on a mission.\n\nAfter the briefings, the crews were trucked to their aircraft on the flight line where they donned their flight gear. Over their normal clothing they wore a very heavy and stiff leather fleece-lined flight suit, jokingly referred to as a \"bunny suit\", which included coat, pants, boots, inner and outer gloves, and leather headgear referred to as a helmet. A separate steel helmet would be worn later. Next came their \"Mae West\" life preserver or flotation device followed by a parachute harness. A savvy airman would definitely have already checked at the equipment hut where they were issued their flight gear that the harness and parachute were compatible. Chest-mounted parachute pack and harness designs changed during the course of the war and the clips and rings used to attach the parachute to the harness were not always compatible. Some models of parachutes had D-rings that would fit into snap clips on the harness while other models had snap clips that would latch onto D-rings on the harness. Later in the war red and yellow color coding was added to the harnesses and parachute cases to more effectively ensure the harness and parachute were properly paired. A red coded parachute needed a red coded harness, yellow needed yellow. It was a sad airman indeed who discovered he could not attach his parachute to his harness in an emergency situation. Once over enemy airspace waist gunners also donned their steel helmets and three-piece flak suit - pieces for chest, back, and a sort of apron for the lower front. Flak suits provided some level of protection against smaller, lower velocity shrapnel but by no means bullet-proofed the airmen. Flak suits were heavy and cumbersome and would interfere with attaching a parachute pack. Fortunately, flak suits were designed with a quick release cord which allowed the suit to part at the shoulders and quickly drop off. Once clothed for battle the crew boarded with the rest of their gear.\n\nThe crew busied themselves while waiting for the green flare that signaled the mission was a go. Bombs were checked and would be checked again in flight. Each aircraft was carrying ten 500 lb. RDX bombs with nose and tail fuzes set for a slight delay. RDX was a general purpose high explosive. 21 aircraft from the 460th began takeoff at 7:35 AM and was lead by Maj. Charles F. Lincoln of the 762nd BS. Some sources indicate flares were used instead of radio communication to prevent enemy monitoring the frequency from knowing the start of a mission. The green flare rose brightly in the sky and, about thirty seconds after the aircraft in front of them, the crew's turn came for the taxi down the runway to reach takeoff speed. The lag was to ensure that enough distance was between each aircraft to prevent crashes on takeoff due to prop wash (severe air turbulence from propellers) from the preceding plane. 30 seconds or so also ensured that the aircraft were not too far apart once airborne and reduced formation time. Depending on load the bomber would need to reach 100 to 130 miles per hour for a successful takeoff. Once airborne the bombers would maneuver into the defensive formation they would maintain to the target. Formation was dangerous and sometimes resulted in collisions. Formation might take an hour or more and once completed aircraft followed their predetermined heading toward the target. The 460th rendezvoused with the 485th BG just three minutes behind schedule and the joined the rest of the Bomb Wing at 8:30 AM about five miles east of Spinazzola. Their fighter cover, P-38s, was first observed at 9:29 AM and continued to provide penetration, target, and withdrawal cover until they left the formation at 12:25 PM One aircraft from the 460th returned early due to engine problems.\n\nOnce the bombers had reached the Initial Point (IP), the point where the bomb run to the target actually began, and the point where the bombardier would take control, the course as described during briefing was fixed and no evasive maneuvers could be performed. Earlier in the air war there weren't such strict requirements on the approach to the target. Evasive and corrective maneuvers could be performed. However, Colonel Curtis LeMay of the Eighth Army Air Force observed that the lack of procedures resulted in scattering of the formation and reduced accuracy. As a result, in 1942 he implemented the stringent bomb run procedure. General Eaker was pleased with the results and made the bomb run procedure a requirement throughout the Army Air Forces.\n\nUntil the IP was reached, the bombers could usually make wide \"S\" turns to evade or bypass tough areas. The IP was typically 18 to 20 miles from the target and the run to the target was around five minutes. The bombardier had two alternative methods for controlling the aircraft on the bomb run. He could either employ a system that allowed the pilot to be informed of necessary course changes through the Pilot Director Indicator (PDI), a large round indicator gauge located directly in front of the pilot above the Rate-of-Climb and Airspeed Indicators on the main console, or by making those course changes through the use of the Norden bombsight and the autopilot system. The second method did not involve the pilot who monitored controls while waiting for the bomb drop and return of control of the aircraft. Once over the target, the bombardier looked for the aim point described in the mission briefing that morning. For an industrial site, the aim point was typically some building or other identifiable point which was essentially the centroid of the complex or facility. The aim point was selected to maximize the concentration of the bombs on the target. 20 460th BG aircraft were over Vienna at 11:47 AM. There was solid undercast so bombing was done by PFF from 23,000 feet. The 460th BG dropped 47.25 tons of bombs over Vienna. Due to clouds the drop was not observed but a \"bombs away\" photograph indicates the bombs fell short of target.\n\nThe daily mission report indicates that flak was \"heavy, slight, and accurate\" en route to the target and \"heavy, intense, and accurate\" over the target. Flak reports had three separate designations - anti-aircraft cannon size, intensity of fire (slight, medium, or intense), and accuracy. Heavy typically meant the cannons were firing 88mm or larger shells. On this first mission, the sky was filled with flak so thick the pilot couldn't always see. There were supposed to be only 400 anti-aircraft guns, but there turned out to be 1,200 of them, all waiting for the American bombers to fly over. The mission narrative indicates that the bomb group experienced IAH (intense, accurate, heavy) flak for six to seven minutes - \"Red, white and black bursts were observed, large white bursts, eight to a cluster, reached from 30,000' to 35,000'\". By this time in the war, Vienna was the second most heavily defended city in terms of numbers of anti-aircraft guns, the most heavily defended city being Berlin itself. Thomas Childers, in his book entitled Wings of Morning: The Story of the Last American Bomber Shot Down Over Germany in World War II, indicates that by fall of 1944 the Germans had approximately one million personnel assigned to anti-aircraft defenses and that there were over 50,000 German anti-aircraft guns pointed skyward. He describes the rupturing shells and resultant flak as \"sooty turbulence\" and as bone-jarring concussions that could start in an instant from the sides, front, above or below, causing the plane to \"bump\", \"shudder\", and \"stagger\" just from the shock waves. One pilot mentioned that during flak barrages he, like many before him, soon found it possible to sweat even when the temperature in the aircraft was 30 degrees below zero.\n\nMissions like this were tough and thoughts of what happened to 460th bomb group crews just the day before were fresh on the rookie crew's minds. The day before this first mission, one aircraft, the Sky Wolves, piloted by Gideon H. Jones from the 460th Bomb Group/760th Bomb Squad went down that day due to anti-aircraft fire. Their mission had been to the Piave/Susegan railroad bridge. The entire crew bailed out of their smoking and oil-covered bomber and were eventually captured although some evaded capture for several days and some were originally reported incorrectly as killed in action. Another aircraft from the 460th Bomb Group/762nd piloted by Harlan R. Logan had crew bail out over the Adriatic Sea when their ship iced up in a storm and went out of control. Subsequently, the pilot was able to regain control and land the craft safely, but the two crew members who jumped, navigator 2nd Lt. Wesley Olson and nose gunner/asst. engineer Cpl. Harold Ebe, were killed. Missing Air Crew Reports 9044 and 9202, respectively, document the losses of the Logan and Jones 460th BG B-24 crews that day.\n\nAs for dad and the rest of the crew on their jaunt to Vienna, they were able to drop their bombs on target, wheel around, and head for home. The median landing time for the 18 460th BG aircraft that returnedwas 3:10 PM. 13 had been damaged by flak. Later on the ground they counted at least 30 holes from flak in their bomber, including a large hole in John Bills's turret. Fortunately, John had crawled out just before the turret was hit when he realized he was not wearing his flak jacket or metal helmet. The shrapnel didn't find anyone on their crew that day. It just went in one side and out the other or bounced around until it wore itself out and lay smoldering on the floor. Other crews were not so lucky - one tail gunner with the 762nd Bomb Squad's Floyd Redman crew, John T. De Baun, was killed and another airman was wounded in the eye. Some crew members kissed the ground when they landed. They had survived their first mission. Original crew members, from left to right: Hal Adams, Bo Barger, Joe Rudolph, John Murphy, Sam Hamilton, Tex Mattiza, and Dick Weber.

Target: Three warehouses or factories near Banhida, Hungary, near the Yugoslavian border.\n\nAfter an unexpected day off due to a cancelled October 12th mission, the new day started with the pre-dawn sound of the \"wake up\" jeep coming nearer and then the sound of its squeaky brakes as it ground to a halt outside the tent. It was the 763rd Bomb Squadron's Operations clerk, William J. \"Rosie\" Roseborough, in his jeep. After some footsteps to the tent, in he stepped with a flashlight for the early morning wake up call. He woke each of the crew members, waiting to be sure they were really up. He had learned to keep a safe distance when waking up the airmen, regardless of whether they were officers or enlisted men. Some woke up swinging and many would have liked to connect with the guy who held the flashlight before dawn had even come. He often tried to easy them into the day by joking that he was waking them up for a picnic or milk-run mission. He always dodged questions about what the mission was, even though he knew. The savvy crewmen knew to ask what their fuel load was for the day - a heavy fuel load meant a long mission, probably Germany or Poland, less fuel meant a shorter mission, maybe to Northern Italy, Austria, or Yugoslavia. Knowing bomb type and load could provide some intelligence as well. Some advance information was better than none.\n\nSquadron Operations Clerks were indispensible in the day-to-day operations to ensure missions started on time and proceeded to take off smoothly. They handled much of the paperwork that went into running a squadron and documenting missions, crew, and aircraft status. A good Operations Clerk, like the 760th Bomb Squad's Bob Cutlter also served to keep Operations officers up to date on the goings on with crews and individual crewmen. Their role allowed them to talk to all crewmen at every rank and the Officers came to rely on their clerks heavily. Clerks were regarded as \"in the know\". Bob was jokingly referred to as \"Big Time Operator\" and Bob or one of the airmen actually named Bob's jeep \"BTO\" by painting the initials on the windshield.\n\nThe crew was getting a feel for the normal routine of the start of a mission day. They quickly dressed and headed out to the mess tent for breakfast offerings of oatmeal, canned fruit, scrambled powdered eggs, spam, bread, jam, and the ever present and necessary coffee, an endless supply of coffee. After breakfast they headed to the mission briefing to learn what was in store for them. Access to the briefing was strictly controlled and no one not on the mission or directly involved in its planning or administration could enter. After all were present and settled down, a black cloth was pulled off the mission map and groans were heard once the destination registered with the more veteran airmen. Today's run would be a tough mission and credit the crews two points toward the required fifty to complete their tour. The crews heard details of the mission as presented on the huge map with the colored ribbons leading from their base to primary and secondary targets. Last resort and targets of opportunity were sometimes mentioned as well. Bombing accuracy was stressed to the crews both to maximize the percentage of bombs on the target area as well as to minimize civilian losses. Due to the proximity of towns and living quarters to the military targets, bombing errors in hundreds of yards could well translate to hundreds of civilian casualties. All crew members were keenly interested in learning where the flak guns were believed to be located. The map showed the various outbound and return legs of the trip, as well as course deflection points, the initial point for the start of the bomb run, and, of course, the target itself. The briefing was completed within 30 minutes and was followed by a prayer led by the chaplain. The airmen then left for a separate specialty briefing for information on course, mission lead, and bomb drop. Pilots might be briefed with Squadron Commanders, Navigators by other officers in the War Room, and gunners by the Armament Officers.\n\nAfter briefings, they headed out for the Quonset hut near Dolly Tower to pick up their personal flight equipment which included their flight suits, parachutes, first aid kits, escape and evasion kits, flight boots, gloves, Mae West life vests, leather helmets, steel flak helmets, flak suits, and K-rations. The personnel issuing the parachutes often had sport with the aircrew. One ruse was to say that \"if the 'chute doesn't work, bring it back for a replacement\". Another good joke to pull was to question an airman's weight and say that the chute they were just issued was, say, only 24 feet in diameter and that they needed a 28 feet diameter chute. When the airman asked for the correct sized chute they were told there were none in Italy, but that they'd place an order. The crews had already made sure in the early morning that they carried no significant personal effects with them except for their dog tags and an identification card. Guys still carried pocket knives and such, but no sense giving the enemy any more information than necessary in the event of capture. The Stone crew hopped aboard 6X6 trucks for the ride to their assigned bomber.\n\nTheir bomber was fueled, equipped, and waiting for them out on the hardstand. The mission was going to be led by the 763rd BS's own Major Charles C. Ward, Commanding Officer of the bomb squad. Today dad and his pals would be flying in \"K for King\" in the tail-end Charlie slot. The ground crew chief stood waiting at the bomber for the turnover of the aircraft from ground crew to the air crew. He had the standard \"Form One\" with him which listed the repair, maintenance, and declared issues of the aircraft. The pilot would add any new items to it after the mission. Although there often wasn't much interaction between the aircrews and the ground crews, except for the ground crew chief who was there at the aircraft at the start and finish of each mission, the aircrews respected and relied upon the ground crew's work. The ground crews always did a great job making sure the bombers were in the best of shape possible for a mission and that as many planes as possible were ready to fly. Unlike crews who may not be assigned to a dedicated aircraft, ground crews were assigned to specific aircraft to familiarize themselves with the aircraft's maintenance and repair history, and its nuances. Consequently, ground crews often became very attached to aircraft for which they were responsible. Many aircraft were named and had what almost amounted to personalities. Ground crews took great pride in their work and considered the aircraft their own. The crews were grateful that the ground crews looked out for them. More than one ground crewman was known to break down upon hearing of the loss of his aircraft.\n\nAir crew and ground crew members with 460th BG/761st BS aircraft No. 42-52381 \"T. S. Express\".

[There is one interesting sidenote about crewmember, Ray Hunstsinger, in the above picture pertaining to an innovative repair of two hydraulic lines severed by anti-aircraft fire. The two lines controlled flaps and brakes and without those systems' functionality safe landing would have been nearly impossible. Ray was able to repair the lines using two condoms he carried around and used friction tape off of the navigator's tool. The aircraft landed safely. In 2003 Ray was finally awarded a Distinguished Flying Cross for his actions.]\n\nThe enlisted crew checked the bombs, guns, ammo, and other equipment while the officers ran through their own check lists. A mission ran on check lists, lots of them, from start to finish. Even though procedures became routine as lists were memorized by rote repetition, standard practice was to always use a physical list to ensure there were no oversights. Bombs were checked twice, once on the ground and again after the bomber was airborne. 36 aircraft from the bomb group began to take off at 7:45 AM but for some reason Maj. Ward's aircraft was unable to take off, so the Deputy Leader's aircraft took the lead. Finally, Sam Hamilton received the signal clearing him for takeoff and the huge bomber taxied northwest down the 6,000 foot long steel mat runway at a magnetic bearing of about 330 degrees and made its way into the air. The Marston perforated steel planking was loud under the wheels and the crew always knew when the wheels left the ground. Their bomber was about 30 seconds behind the aircraft that had just taken off. The bombers circled the base while they gained altitude and then entered the formation with the other aircraft. In the meanwhile, Maj. Ward and his crew had been assigned a replacement aircraft, took off, and assumed lead per the mission plan. The 460th rendezvoused with the 485th BG and the Wing formation was over Spinazzola at 9:00 AM. En route to the target one aircraft turned back due to issues with one of its engine cowlings. They jettisoned their bombs in the Adriatic Sea before landing at base.\n\nThe formation flew the planned route which took them over Yugoslavia and the Hungarian border and over Budapest. About an hour or so away from enemy airspace, they lowered the ball turret. They usually waited to lower it to maximize airspeed, reduce drag, and conserve fuel. They had encountered no air defenses and there were reportedly only four anti-aircraft guns. So far, so good. At 11:30 AM an aircraft which appeared to be the rare rocket propelled fight, the ME-163, was observed, but it only circled and did not engage. The hulking bombers made it to the initial point and the bomb run began. They thought it was nice that the designated target buildings were all lined up in a row. Nice and easy to bomb. The fighter escort, comprised of P-38s and P-51s, was observed only in the target area. The bombers came in low at about 16,000 or 17,000 feet and made easy targets on that sunny day for the anti-aircraft gunners over three miles below them. Flak was reported as SIH \"slight, inaccurate, heavy\". The flak lasted for about two minutes and was reported as \"large red and black in color, the red bursts breaking up into small burning particles\". Per John Bills's memoirs one aircraft was blown out of the sky with a direct flak hit, but I have not found any record of that event. The mission narrative report indicates that 10 miles south of the target a burst that may have been \"rocket flak\" was observed. Again, their ship was hit with shrapnel, this time taking out one of the turrets. Three other aircraft took flak damage as well. Still, at 11:37 AM over the primary target 33 of the 35 aircraft from the group dropped a mix of bombs. 17 dropped 42 tons of 500 lb RDX bombs with slightly delayed fusing and 16 dropped 34.75 tons of 500 lb incendiary bombs with instantaneous fusing. Results were not good as the target was overshot. One aircraft had its bombs hang-up and ended up dropping them about a mile past the target. One aircraft bombed and hit a target of opportunity near the marshalling yard, a large factory at Kapsovar. The group began their slow turn toward home, back along a pre-described route. All 35 aircraft returned to base. On September 7, 1999 Bob Seidel was interviewed as part of the World War II Prisoners of War Oral History Project done by the University of North Texas. Bob indicated in that interview that the crew could feel the bombs explode, feel the concussion, even when their aircraft was as high as 22,000 feet\n\nThroughout most of a mission, the airmen were tied to their ship like an unborn child is to its mother's womb. Radio cords for communication, electrical cords for warmth, and oxygen hoses for the very breath they breathed linked the men to their mother ship which seemed to do what it could to keep the airmen safe and alive. Humans were not meant to live in that lofty environment. Besides the dangers presented by an enemy bent on killing the airmen, nature itself had designs on the crew's lives. Frostbite was an ever present danger. The basic ability to breathe was another. At elevations above 10,000 feet the air was thin and the crew wore oxygen masks. Without oxygen at high altitude a man would pass out within a few minutes and die a few minutes later. The thing is, they'd never feel it coming on. Oxygen was supplied to the crew at their stations from fixed tanks located on the aircraft. There were also available small portable tanks the crew could use to move from one compartment to the other. I took these pictures of stationary and portable oxygen tanks on my flight with the B-24 Liberator \"Witchcraft\". The small green tank is located at a waist gunner's position and the overhead yellow tanks are located aft of the bomb bay. The regulators and the flexible tubes feeding the oxygen were prone to freezing and crew members needed to be sure to squeeze the rubber components from time to time to ensure the oxygen was flowing and that there was no ice build-up. The pilot or copilot would typically establish check-ins with all crew members, often every 15 minutes, as a safety precaution. Checks were typically done in order of location in the aircraft, from front to back - nose turret, navigator, top turret, radio, waist positions, ball turret, and tail turret.\n\nLeft: 460th B-24s on a Mission to Salzburg - The Smoke is from the Bombing and Smudge Pots\n\nthe Germans Would Light for Smoke Cover. Right: A German Anti-Aircraft 88mm Flak Battery Fires at Night.\n\nMission No. 3\n\nOctober 16, 1944, Monday. Target: Neudorf Aircraft Engine Factory at Graz, Austria.\n\nAfter a couple of days off, the crew were woken and readied themselves for another day of war in the skies. During their briefing that morning, they learned the primary target was the Nibelungen tank works at St. Valentin, Austria. Today there group was being led by Col. Bertram C. Harrison, Wing Executive Officer, and the second attack unit would be led by Lt. Col. Harold T. Babb, Group Commander. These men of the greatest generation were led by leaders who flew and fought on missions just like an enlisted airman, and they were respected for that.\n\nFrom the 460th BG, 44 bombers were scheduled to begin takeoff at 7:10 AM, but one was unable to do so because of a fire in its bomb bay. The group assembled over Spinazzola and joined there wingmates from the 485th BG based in Venosa just 20 or so miles away. They were in formation at 8:10 AM and ready for the planned route to the target. A couple of hours later at 10:15 AM the group spotted their P-38 escorts. Two aircraft turned back with supercharger and engine problems, both dropped their bombs in the Adriatic Sea before safely landing at base.\n\nThe group led the formation and made it to target but overcast conditions and lack of definitive identification of the target by PFF they were unable to bomb, and Harrison decided to proceed to the secondary target, the Graz-Neudorf aircraft factory. Some reports of the day indicate that while the 460th was unable to drop on the primary target although other bomb groups were able to bomb and severely damaged two assembly shops and several machine shops.\n\nFlak over the target was reported as M-IAH (medium to intense, accurate, heavy) and 16 460th BG aircraft were damaged. 40 460th BG aircraft began bombing Neudorf at 11:59 AM from 22,000 feet. 33 aircraft were able to drop on target. Numerous hits were observed on the factory's three main buildings - the western building took at least five direct hits, at least 10 hits were counted on the eastern building, and a small building between the two was also hit. All buildings were left heavily damaged and smoking. Several aircraft crossed enemy lines but were not able to bomb the target. Of those aircraft one had problems with its supercharger, four had engine problems, two had bomb rack malfunctions, and two experienced accidental release of bombs. One aircraft was able to bomb a target of opportunity, a factory south of Mittendorf at 11:35 AM. The daily mission report indicates that 90 bombs were jettisoned, so all aircraft were able to jettison bombs on the return somewhere over Austria and in the Adriatic Sea.\n\nThe 460th BG scored big on this mission, but they paid dearly for it. This was the mission on which one of the bombers, B-24H \"White K for King\", known as \"Kingfish\", aircraft number 41-28883 piloted by Alfred E. Preszler from the 460th Bomb Group/762nd Bomb Squad exploded in mid-air after it was hit by a bomb dropped from another aircraft and went down in flames. Of the ten man crew, all but two were able to bail out over Yugoslavia; three bailed out from the waist and five from the bomb bay. Five were captured and became prisoners of war, three escaped. Two airmen, bombardier 2nd Lt. Richard A. Hanford and nose gunner Cpl. Hubert C. Jackson, went down with the aircraft and died on impact. Note that aircraft 41-28883 is consistently cited as \"K\" in Preszler's MACR 9198, but as \"U\" in one crewmember's witness statement regarding a May 1944 incident documented as MACR 5068.\n\nAnother aircraft, 42-99798, from dad's own group, the 460th Bomb Group/763 Bomb Squad's own \"O for Oboe\" named \"Ashcan Charlie\" and piloted by 2nd Lt. Roger B. Berry took a direct flak hit just after bombs were released. The plane \"just disintegrated\" as one nearby crew reported. Richard \"Dick\" Schneider, a 763rd Bomb Squad tail gunner, saw the explosion and said the aircraft disappeared into tiny pieces like a clay pigeon does when hit directly by a shotgun blast on the trap or skeet range. Witnesses reported two chutes opening and a third on fire and falling. Amazingly, somehow two crew members survived. Missing Air Crew Reports 9198 and 9303, respectively, document the losses of Preszler's and Berry's aircraft and crews over Austria. Missing Air Crew Report 9303 mistakenly refers to Berry's aircraft as \"Ashean Charley\".\n\nThere was no hiding, no cover, and no running away for the bombers that day. All they could do is take whatever the enemy threw at them, feel the concussion of the nearby explosions, listen to the spray of shrapnel against their ship, watch daylight stream in through the holes, hold their course, and pray to almighty God it would pass soon. It was flaming hell in the sky that cold fall day over Austria, but dad and the rest of his crew, and 34 of the other bombers returned safely to their airbase home in Spinazzola, Italy with a median landing time of 2:40 PM, only to don their flight gear and climb back in their bomber the next day to do it all over again in a different part of Europe. Four aircraft had to land at friendly fields at Gioia, Loreto, and Iesi and the crews were later transported back to 460th BG \"Bomber City\".\n\nBomber City was a nickname given to the Spinazzola airbase. Spinazzola was the small city about seven miles to the slight northwest. During Col. Bertram Harrison's tenure as base commander, some referred to the base as Harrison's Flats. There was a closer town the crews would sometimes visit, Poggiorsini, about 2.5 miles southeast of the base. Generally speaking, however, the airmen were advised not to visit the Italian towns. There were still many fascist sympathizers in the country and in fact portions of mostly northern Italy were still occupied by Germans.\n\nThe look and feel of the base changed over time. Originally, the base was essentially a tent city and a quagmire of mud due to the frequent rains. Crews soon found out that with minimal shared cost, maybe $200 total, they could hire locals to "
