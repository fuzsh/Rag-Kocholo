It traces the lineage of each Army Air Corps and U.S. Air Force combat group or higher organization active in World War 11, from its origins to 1956.

As an important source of ready information, this volume not only serves as a reference tool for historians and researchers; but it also provides commanders with a corporate memory of vital statistics. With these facts, a unit documents its heritage, the basis for unit esprit de corps. Originally this volume had been printed in 1961. Its worth has been proven, and the demand for it has been great.
