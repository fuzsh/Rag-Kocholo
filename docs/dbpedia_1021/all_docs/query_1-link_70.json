        "text": "5TH AIR FORCE USAAF\n\nIN AUSTRALIA\n\n1942 - 1945\n\nNOTE:- The United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) was re-titled as the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) on 20 June 1941. Many units kept using old letterheads etc until new ones arrived and some units could not get out of the habit of using USAAC for quite some time.\n\nThe 5th Air Force had its early beginnings as the Philippine Department Air Force on 20 September 1941 under the command of Brigadier General Henry B. Clagett.\n\nIt was renamed to the Far East Air Force (FEAF) on 28 October 1941 and was under the command of Major-General Lewis Hyde Brereton. The FEAF fought in the Philippines at the outbreak of the Pacific War. They covered the retreat south to Java and then escaped back to Australia where they played a small part in the Battle of the Coral Sea (7-8 May 1942) and went on to became the nucleus of the new Fifth Air Force.\n\nAllotment of USAAF Units\n\nIn Australia on 27 May 1942\n\nOn 9 August 1942, the American Chief of Staff, General Marshall gave orders to establish the 5th Air Force and gave George C. Kenney immediate command of this new air force and all other Allied air units in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA). Kenney's headquarters were located in Brisbane.\n\nThe 5th Air Force USAAF was established in Australia on 3 September 1942 under the command of Major General George Kenney who had arrived in Brisbane, in the State of Queensland in Australia on 29 July 1942. Kenney made a lightning tour of bases in northern Queensland and summarily fired the entire command air staff.\n\nAt the time that Kenney had arrived, there were three fighter groups, 5 bombardments groups, two transport squadrons and one photographic squadron operational in the SWPA comprising 1,602 officers and 18,116 men.\n\nThe following two units were heavily hit by the Japanese when the war in the Pacific broke out\n\nand some members escaped to Australia to join up with units of the 5th Air Force.\n\nKenney's Deputy was Ennis Whitehead who was to command the advance base in Port Moresby. Brigadier General Ken Walker was placed in charge of the 5th Bomber Command, based in Townsville. \"Squeeze\" Wurtsmith (49th Fighter Group) was placed in charge of the 5th Fighter Command. Major Victor Bertrandais was placed in charge of the Services Command, also based in Townsville.\n\nKenney started construction of a central depot at Townsville and began planning the replacement of the battle scarred 19th Bomb Group with the 90th Bomb Group.\n\nBrigadier General Walker had earlier been told by Kenney to take charge in Townsville and reorganise the Northeast Area Command.\n\nOn 4 November 1942, the 5th Air Force commenced sustained action against the Japanese in Papua New Guinea.\n\nThe Fifth Air Force and the Thirteenth Air Force were combined to become the Far East Air Forces FEAF (not to be confused with the Far East Air Force - singular, under General Brereton in the Philippines in October 1941) under General George C. Kenney on 15 June 1944. General Ennis C. Whitehead was appointed to command the Fifth Air Force. Major General St. Clair Street was in command of the Thirteenth Air Force. Some US Navy search squadrons from the 7th Fleet and Aircraft Northern Solomons of the US Marine Corps air units were attached to the Fifth Air Force. Far East Air Service Command was also formed on the same date.\n\nNo. 2 U.S. Air Command\n\nCOMMANDING OFFICERS OF THE 5TH AIR FORCE\n\nAND ITS PREDECESSORS\n\nPHILIPPINES DEPARTMENT AIR FORCE\n\nFAR EAST AIR FORCE\n\nMacARTHUR'S ALLIED AIR FORCE\n\n5TH AIR FORCE COMMANDERS\n\nSTATIONS\n\n5TH BOMBER COMMAND\n\n28 OCTOBER 1941 - 1946\n\nBOMBARDMENT GROUPS IN THE 5TH AIR FORCE\n\n3rd Bomb Group \"The Grim Reapers\"\n\n- HQ Squadron\n\n- 8th Squadron\n\n- 13th Squadron\n\n- 89th Squadron\n\n- 90th Squadron\n\n- 46 Ordinance Co.\n\n- 2 Chemical Co.\n\nA-24s, A-20s & B-25s One of the oldest Groups in Air Force. 8th, 13th & 90th Aero Squadrons were forerunners of the Gp. and saw action in France in WW I. 19th Bomb Group\n\n- Headquarters Squadron\n\n- 28th Squadron\n\n- 40th Recon.
