Damaged landing at El Mirage Lake, CA 18Jan43. 61197 60th Troop Carrier Squadron, 63rd Troop Carrier Group, Victorville Army Flying School, CA. Crashed without a pilot at Blythe AAB, CA 16Dec42. The C-53 42-47379 took off from South Plains Army Air Field towing the Waco CG-4A glider being ferried to Victorville Army Flying School at Victorville, California. The flight plan included an overnight stop at Tucson, Arizona. In addition to the flight crew the aircraft also carried four passengers. It was almost dark when the tow plane/glider combination arrived over Blythe Army Air Field, California, 150 miles south of Victorville. Suddenly, the glider pilot saw a light blinking in the astrodome of the C-53, the normal night signal for the pilot to release the glider. Believing they were over Tucson, their planned overnight stop, the pilot released his glider and landed. Once on the ground he began staking down the glider and adding chocks to the ailerons, elevators and rudder. Just as he completed preparing the glider for an overnight stay the tower notified him that the C-53 pilot had radioed that the glider had landed at the wrong base. The tower operator added that the C-53 was landing to retrieve the glider. The C-53 copilot had erroneously given the cutoff signal. After the tow plane landed it took some time for base personnel to locate the tow rope in the fading light. The glider pilot tried to convince the tow pilot to remain overnight but he refused. Eye-witnesses indicated that the tow pilot appeared to be anxious to get underway. He taxied the C-53 to a point adjacent to the east end of the east-west runway and stopped. The glider copilot took a flashlight and motioned the tow plane into position on the runway. Then the glider was towed into position behind the tow plane. When the glider was in position the tow rope was hooked to the C-53 while the glider pilot hooked it to the CG-4A, one of many mistakes; the tow rope was not to be hooked to the glider until both pilots were in their seats with their safety belts fastened. The glider pilot instructed an aircraft mechanic from the base to get the flashlight and stand by the left wingtip of the tow plane so he could signal the tow pilot to take up the slack in the tow rope. Just before entering the glider the pilot noticed that the chocks had not been removed from the ailerons, elevators and rudder. He instructed his copilot to remove the chocks from the right aileron while he removed them from the elevators and rudder. He started for the left aileron when suddenly the glider began moving forward. The tow pilot had interpreted the half-moon signal given to take up the tow rope slack as the signal to take off. As the glider moved forward the glider pilot ran for the door of the glider but never made it; the glider was moving too fast. Before he and his copilot could get out of the way, the rear elevator struck them and knocked them down. The tow plane took off and made a 270 degree turn to the right, flew south a short distance, turned left and then made a 360 degree turn to the right. At this point the tow plane was over the south edge of the field at approximately 400 feet when the pilot released the glider. The aircraft accident report indicated that the pilotless glider collided with the tow plane damaging the left horizontal stabilizer causing the pilot to lose control of the aircraft. The C-53 stalled and crashed almost immediately followed by the glider a short distance away [8KIS]. 61203 Laurinburg-Maxton AAB, NC.
