Anderson, TG; all evaded for two days with the aid of Czech partisans, but were then captured and spent the rest of the war as POWs. All the crew survived except S/Sgt. Andrew Solock, the ball turret gunner. He perished in the plane crash. The survivors were shocked to learn that he hadn't gotten out. He was last seen by S/Sgt. Anderson sitting near the escape hatch putting on his shoes. (It was common practice for airmen who wore heated flight suits to remove their shoes.) Anderson said he had some difficulty getting out of the tail because the airplane was going out of control. It was surmised that S/Sgt. Solok may have been trapped in the airplane by the same forces. He was buried by the Czechs at Sidonia. 54 The seven uninjured crew members were put in a prison camp at Bratislava. On the night of September 1, Slovak camp guards took 26 Americans (Note: This number considerably higher than the 12 American air crew members reported evacuated on September 17) to the free territory of the Slovak anti-Nazi rebels near Banska Bystrica. On September 17, two B-17s with P-51 fighter escort flew in and evacuated the Americans gathered there. 55 Unfortunately none of the Wray crew were among those who were freed and evacuated. Those flown out from the <strong>2nd</strong> <strong>Bomb</strong> <strong>Group</strong> were, <strong>2nd</strong> Lt. Thayne L. Thomas, P; <strong>2nd</strong> Lt. Clarence B. Jackson, co-pilot on Lt. Bullock's crew; and SI Sgt. Robert D. Donahue, tail gunner from Lt. Tune's crew. The OSS, that arranged the rescue mission, swore the rescued men to secrecy as to how they were brought out. 1st Lt. Merrill A. Prentice, in number 42- 31885, was in the last airplane, in the last squadron of the last group. His navigator was <strong>2nd</strong> Lt. Charles H. McVey, whose regular crew was that of <strong>2nd</strong> Lt. McCloskey. McVey had met the officer crew members for the first time only a few minutes before take off. He was the only survivor from Prentice's crew. The plane was hit immediately after the attack began. There were hits in the wing and the ammunition box in the nose section started smoking. Prentice immediately yelled\" bailout!\" over the intercom. McVey went to the nose escape hatch and tried to pull the emergency handle, but the door bound and would not release. Lt. Prentice and copilot <strong>2nd</strong> Lt. Theo (NMI) Heath soon joined him and were trying to release the door by the handle. By now the plane was out of control and throwing them around. The motion stress was apparently causing the door to bind. McVey turned and saw bombardier, <strong>2nd</strong> Lt. Robert A. Laux, half slumped over the navigator's table. Only minutes before, McVey had helped Laux with his flak suit. Then another burst of shell fire blew the plexiglass nose off the ship. McVey was stunned, but realized he might have to go out the open nose, since the pilots were now trying to kick the hatch door out. The next thing McVey knew he was falling through space. Having been without oxygen for some minutes, he was not fully aware of what he was doing, and had difficulty pulling his rip cord. He did not get his chute deployed until he was fairly close to the ground. He was falling into a clearing, but had time to slideslip the chute into some trees at the edge of the clearing, thinking to avoid any Germans who might be about. Shortly after he landed, a plane which he thought Burial ceremony for four members of Lt. McCloskey s crew, from plane number 42-31473, \"My Baby, \" - S/Sgt. Schirmer, Sgt Pruitt, S/Sgt.
