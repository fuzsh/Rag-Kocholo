        "text": "History\n\nThe town's original name was KulaÅ¡evac. In August 1893, King Aleksandar ObrenoviÄ came to KulaÅ¡evac (Serbian Cyrillic: ÐÑÐ»Ð°ÑÐµÐ²Ð°Ñ), and built a fountain called Kraljeva Äesma (ÐÑÐ°ÑÐµÐ²Ð° ÑÐµÑÐ¼Ð°, \"The King's Fountain\"). In honor of King Aleksandar's contribution, KulaÅ¡evac was renamed to Kraljeva Voda (ÐÑÐ°ÑÐµÐ²Ð° ÐÐ¾Ð´Ð°, \"The King's Water\"). In 1903, King Petar KaraÄorÄeviÄ I built a villa on the site, helping strengthen the growing trend of turning the slopes surrounding Kraljeva Voda into a vacation spot. After World War II, Kraljeva Voda was renamed to Partizanske Vode (ÐÐ°ÑÑÐ¸Ð·Ð°Ð½ÑÐºÐµ ÐÐ¾Ð´Ðµ, \"The Partisans' Waters\") in 1946. The name change was out of respect for wounded Zlatibor Partisans who were murdered by Nazi Germany's army in November and December 1941, while they were recovering in the main hospital of Palisad in the northern part of Kraljeva Voda. In 1995, Partizanske Vode was renamed to Zlatibor, recognizing the mountain upon which the town rests."
