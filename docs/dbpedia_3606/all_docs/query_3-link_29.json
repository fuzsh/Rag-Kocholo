        "text": "History\n\nIt is an old town, first mentioned in 1253 AD as a place where many merchants rested and paid taxes while on their way to Dubrovnik. Voivode Stefan Vasoje, the son of King Stefan Konstantin (r. 1321-1322), received Sjenica as an appanage by Emperor Stefan DuÅ¡an (r. 1331â1355). During the reign of the Ottoman Empire, Sjenica was used as a fortified site. On a nearby hill the Ottomans built a fortress, which was later demolished. Next to the fortress was a merchants' quarter and few wooden residential homes. In the 19th century, Sjenica was considered a high priority because of its political, military and strategic significance, thus many military campaigns were led during the First Serbian Uprising. Soon after, a new turmoil came to the region with a resistance movement against Sultan Mahmud II's reforms. During the Ottoman-Albanian hostilities of 1901 the town was partly burnt by Albanian bands.[4] In the 1908-12 Ottoman parliament, the elected representative of Sjenica was Hasan Muhidin Bey (Hasan Muhedini), a local prominent Albanian.[5]\n\nIn 1917 when the area was under Austrian control a conference was held, in which the representatives drafted and signed a resolution for the union of the area with Bosnia or the establishment of an autonomous region.[6]\n\nFrom 1929 to 1941, Sjenica was part of the Zeta Banovina of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.\n\nDuring World War II the SS Polizei-Selbstschutz-Regiment Sandschak under Karl von Krempler was stationed here consisted of local Muslim population, during a period when many Serbs lost their lives. In 1943 Sjenica was the battleground of intense fighting between Partisans and the German army.\n\nGeography and climate\n\nSjenica is located at an altitude of 1,026 meters above sea level, making it one of the highest towns in Serbia and the Balkans. Temperatures fall below freezing on average 134 days per year, with the first freeze in late September and the last in early May. According to the KÃ¶ppen-Geiger climate classification, it has a humid continental climate (Dfb) with freezing and not so humid winters, and with warm and humid summers, but with cold nights.\n\nClimate data for Sjenica, Serbia (1981â2010, extremes 1961â2010) Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high Â°C (Â°F) 17.2\n\n(63.0) 19.4\n\n(66.9) 21.9\n\n(71.4) 26.0\n\n(78.8) 29.4\n\n(84.9) 32.2\n\n(90.0) 34.7\n\n(94.5) 36.2\n\n(97.2) 31.5\n\n(88.7) 26.7\n\n(80.1) 27.3\n\n(81.1) 18.0\n\n(64.4) 36.2\n\n(97.2) Average high Â°C (Â°F) 1.5\n\n(34.7) 3.0\n\n(37.4) 7.4\n\n(45.3) 12.2\n\n(54.0) 17.6\n\n(63.7) 21.0\n\n(69.8) 23.3\n\n(73.9) 23.7\n\n(74.7) 19.1\n\n(66.4) 14.8\n\n(58.6) 8.1\n\n(46.6) 2.6\n\n(36.7) 12.9\n\n(55.2) Daily mean Â°C (Â°F) â3.6\n\n(25.5) â2.7\n\n(27.1) 1.8\n\n(35.2) 6.5\n\n(43.7) 11.5\n\n(52.7) 14.7\n\n(58.5) 16.5\n\n(61.7) 16.2\n\n(61.2) 11.9\n\n(53.4) 7.8\n\n(46.0) 2.2\n\n(36.0) â2.1\n\n(28.2) 6.7\n\n(44.1) Average low Â°C (Â°F) â8.2\n\n(17.2) â7.5\n\n(18.5) â3.0\n\n(26.6) 1.2\n\n(34.2) 5.2\n\n(41.4) 8.1\n\n(46.6) 9.5\n\n(49.1) 9.4\n\n(48.9) 6.1\n\n(43.0) 2.4\n\n(36.3) â2.4\n\n(27.7) â6.1\n\n(21.0) 1.2\n\n(34.2) Record low Â°C (Â°F) â35.6\n\n(â32.1) â31.0\n\n(â23.8) â25.0\n\n(â13.0) â12.7\n\n(9.1) â6.4\n\n(20.5) â3.7\n\n(25.3) â0.4\n\n(31.3) â1.3\n\n(29.7) â9.3\n\n(15.3) â11.5\n\n(11.3) â26.2\n\n(â15.2) â29.6\n\n(â21.3) â35.6\n\n(â32.1) Average precipitation mm (inches) 46.3\n\n(1.82) 47.4\n\n(1.87) 46.4\n\n(1.83) 55.7\n\n(2.19) 71.5\n\n(2.81) 79.1\n\n(3.11) 66.9\n\n(2.63) 62.0\n\n(2.44) 75.6\n\n(2.98) 62.4\n\n(2.46) 74.1\n\n(2.92) 62.2\n\n(2.45) 749.5\n\n(29.51) Average precipitation days (â¥ 0.1 mm) 14 14 14 15 15 14 12 11 12 12 12 15 160 Average snowy days 13 13 11 4 0 0 0 0 0 1 7 12 61 Average relative humidity (%) 82 80 77 72 72 73 72 73 78 79 81 84 77 Mean monthly sunshine hours 87.0 101.3 145.6 162.3 206.2 229.5 264.4 246.1 179.6 145.7 96.6 72.6 1,936.8 Source: Republic Hydrometeorological Service of Serbia[10]"
