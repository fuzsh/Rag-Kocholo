        "text": "Opening credits are preceded by title cards featuring the lyrics of \"Sigh No More, Ladies,\" a song within the play.\n\nAccording to the 17 Aug 1993 DV, actor-turned-filmmaker Kenneth Branagh began pitching a screen adaptation of William Shakespeare’s Much Ado About Nothing in 1990. The project marked Branagh’s second Shakespearean adaptation after 1989’s Henry V. A 2 May 1993 LAT article noted the filmmaker chose Much Ado About Nothing for its accessibility, stating that three quarters of the play is in prose and, as described by Branagh, “very easy on the ear.” When the screenplay circulated, it received criticism from some financiers for being too dialogue-heavy. After Walt Disney Pictures and Paramount Pictures passed, The Samuel Goldwyn Company came on board to finance and distribute. The 24 Feb 1992 Var stated the arrangement was part of a two-picture deal, to include Branagh’s upcoming release, Peter’s Friends (1992, see entry).\n\nThe production budget for Much Ado About Nothing was listed as between $10 million and $15 million. According to the 27 Jul 1992 Var and 13 Oct 1993 HR, Goldwyn controlled worldwide distribution rights, with the exception of U.K. rights, which were sold to Branagh’s production company, Renaissance Films. Although Goldwyn greenlighted the picture without any partners, American Playhouse Theatrical Films and Columbia TriStar Home Video later provided funding when Playhouse paid $550,000 for initial television broadcast rights, and Columbia purchased home video rights for an estimated $1.65 million. Together, the sales provided roughly twenty percent of the production budget. According to a 1 Jul 1993 DV article, initial prints and advertising costs were $2 million.\n\nThe ensemble cast was paid on a “most-favored nations” basis, with equal salaries plus a portion of “back-end revenue.”\n\nPrinicipal photography began 3 Aug 1992. The film was shot in eight weeks at the Villa Vignamaggio in Greve in Chianti, Italy, where temperatures reached 100 degrees Fahrenheit nearly every day during the last month of filming, as noted in a 28 Sep 1992 Newsday brief. Production notes in AMPAS library files state that a small chapel, an “Etruscan-style open air bath house,” a fountain, and formal gardens were added to the site. Prison scenes were shot in a converted wine cellar. According to a 2 May 1993 NYT article, the Mona Lisa, Leonardo Da Vinci’s famous portrait, was painted at the Villa Vignamaggio, and during filming, Branagh stayed in the bedroom where Lisa Gherardini Giocondo – the subject of Da Vinci’s painting – had stayed. Filming wrapped the week of 21 Sep 1992.\n\nIn early 1993, Warner Bros. Pictures executives screened the film and expressed interest in distributing it. However, after rounds of negotiations, Goldwyn decided to handle distribution itself.\n\nPrior to theatrical release, Much Ado About Nothing screened in competition at the Cannes Film Festival, as noted in the 26 Apr 1993 DV review. The film was also shown at the annual Shakespeare Society of America convention in Atlanta, GA, as noted in the 17 Aug 1993 DV. A Los Angeles, CA, premiere took place on 10 May 1993 at the Mann National Theater, raising $40,000-$50,000 for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) film department, according to a 12 May 1993 LAT item, and the film was screened as the closing night finale of the 36th San Francisco International Film Festival on 13 May 1993, and the following night at the Seattle Film Festival.\n\nA platform theatrical release began 7 May 1993 in New York City, followed by a 14 May 1993 opening in Los Angeles, bringing the release to a total of eleven screens, according to the 11 May 1993 LAT. The release widened to over twenty screens in several other major cities on Memorial Day weekend. By Fourth of July weekend, it was set to expand to 200 screens, according to a 1 Jul 1993 DV article, and finally to 400 screens on 24 Sep 1993, as noted in the 15 Sep 1993 HR. Overseas, Much Ado About Nothing enjoyed a rare, four-week run in Moscow, Russia, at the American Trade Center, where ticket sales had to be conducted in U.S. dollars.\n\nOn 29 Sep 1993, Goldwyn launched a special educational promotion to attract high school and college students, by offering discounted student admissions and free study guides.\n\nCritical reception was positive. Commercially, the film fared exceptionally well for a Shakespeare adaptation. As noted in a 17 Jun 1993 WSJ item, Samuel Goldywn Co. called Much Ado About Nothing “the fastest grossing ‘art’ film ever,” and by 13 Oct 1993, HR reported a cumulative box-office gross of $22.1 million.\n\nA $200,000 Academy Awards “for your consideration” campaign was launched in Sep 1993, according to a 31 Oct 1993 LAT article. Over the course of several weeks, postcards, soundtrack CD’s, color brochures, and home video copies of the film were sent to AMPAS’s 4,5000 voting members. However, the film received no Academy Award nominations.\n\nAs stated in the 15 Sep 1993 HR, W. W. Norton published a book containing Branagh’s screenplay, notes, and still production photographs.\n\nEnd credits include the following statements: “Filmed entirely on location at Villa Vignamaggio, Greve in Chianti, Tuscany, Italy”; and, “Special Thanks: Gianni Nunziante, Sammie Daniels, Carla Bani, Sam Mughal, Guido Semplici, Tom Redfern, Martin-Bruce Clayton.”\n\nLess\n\nAt his country villa in Messina, Italy, Leonato gets word that his friend, Don Pedro, Prince of Aragon, will arrive that evening, having won a war waged against him by his half-brother.

Watching the happy couple kiss for the first time, Beatrice is overjoyed. She teases Don Pedro, inviting him to match her with a husband, and he asks if she would marry him. Beatrice declines. Although disappointed, Don Pedro develops a scheme to bring her and Benedick together. Leonato, Claudio, and Hero agree to help. The men fabricate a story about Beatrice’s “secret love” for Benedick, and discuss it within Benedick’s earshot. Likewise, Hero tells her female servant, Ursula, about Benedick’s love for Beatrice, while Beatrice eavesdrops. As planned, the sparring couple develop romantic feelings for each other. Continuing his efforts to thwart Claudio’s marriage, Don John draws Claudio and Don Pedro into the courtyard the night before the wedding. He points to an open window, where his henchman, Borachio, can be seen having sex with a brunette. Borachio cries out Hero’s name, and the men are led to believe the woman is Hero, while in reality, Borachio is having sex with Hero’s handmaid, Margaret. Later that night, Borachio brags about his exploits to Don John’s other henchman, Conrade. Don Pedro’s watchmen overhear, and arrest them. Dogberry, a dim-witted constable with a penchant for malapropisms, is informed. He tries and fails to convey the news to Leonato, just before Claudio and Hero’s wedding. Leonato instructs Dogberry to examine Borachio and Conrade himself, and rushes off to the chapel. There, after Leonato escorts his daughter down the aisle, Claudio throws her off the altar, strikes her, and accuses her of having lost her virginity to another man. Hero protests her innocence, but Claudio and Don Pedro remain convinced of her guilt. Leonato is disgusted by his daughter and wishes her dead. Certain that Hero is telling the truth, Benedick and Beatrice defend her honor. Friar Francis also suspects Hero is telling the truth. He suggests that Leonato deliver the false news that Hero has died, in hope that Claudio will regret his rash judgment. Benedick follows Beatrice into the chapel, where he confesses his love for her. She returns his affections, but makes him promise to kill Claudio. Benedick finds Claudio and Don Pedro, who have just received news that Hero is dead. He quits his service under Don Pedro, and challenges Claudio to a fight to the death. Meanwhile, Don John flees the villa. With the help of the prince’s watchmen, Dogberry elicits a confession from Borachio, who repeats the confession to Don Pedro and Claudio. Wracked with guilt, Claudio asks Leonato to punish him as he sees fit. Leonato instructs him to hang an epitaph on Hero’s tomb. At Leonato’s behest, Claudio also agrees to marry Hero’s cousin. The next morning, Benedick practices singing a sonnet he wrote for Beatrice. She interrupts him and asks if he challenged Claudio. Benedick assures her he did, just as Ursula rushes in with the news that Hero’s innocence was proven. Everyone returns to the chapel for Claudio’s marriage to Hero’s cousin. However, after Claudio swears to marry her before the friar, the girl removes her veil to reveal she is actually Hero. Claudio embraces his bride as she cries tears of joy. Afterward, Benedick calls Beatrice to the altar. When they realize they were tricked, however, the two renounce their affections. Claudio protests by stealing the sonnet from Benedick’s pocket and showing it to Beatrice. At the same time, Hero swipes a handwritten sonnet from Beatrice’s pocket and gives it to Benedick. After reading each other’s overtures, they decide to marry after all. Just as the double wedding celebration begins, Don John is escorted back to the villa by captors. Benedick urges Don Pedro not to worry about his brother’s punishment until tomorrow. He calls for music, and he and Beatrice lead the others in a dance.\n\nLess"
