        "text": "Then: Cher\n\nBorn in 1946, in El Centro, California, the global icon's career began in the early 1960s when she moved to LA and met aspiring singer Sonny Bono. The pair released several singles together, including 'Let the Good Times Roll' and 'Love is Strange', before Cher released her own debut solo album 'All I Really Want to Do', ranking in the Top 20 on the Billboard 200 charts.\n\nIn the years to follow, Cher enjoyed success both solo and alongside Sonny, who she was married to from 1964-75, dabbling in television as well. Their 1965 single 'I Got You Babe' stormed the charts, hitting the top spot on the US Billboard Hot 100 for three weeks, whilst Cher graced us with solo albums 'The Sonny Side of Chér' and 'Chér' in 1966.\n\nThe 1970s then saw the release of various albums, including 'Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves', 'Foxy Lady' and 'Bittersweet White Light'. Cher also featured in a few films, including Suspect, Moonstruck and Mask.\n\nNow: Cher\n\nThroughout the course of her career, spanning over five decades, the megastar has released a whopping total of 27 studio albums, three live albums, 10 compilation albums and four soundtrack albums - with 2023 seeing her release her first ever Christmas album, featuring popular tracks such as 'DJ Play a Christmas Song' and 'What Christmas Means to Me'.\n\nShe has featured in smash-hit films like Burlesque (2010) and Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again (2018), both acting and singing. - and with rumours of Mamma Mia 3 beginning to swirl, we may just see her return to her iconic role in the film franchise. Cher, and her ex-husband Sonny, were honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1998, following him sadly passing away.\n\nCher has won countless awards, from Grammys and Billboard Music Awards - and her talents in the world of acting have not been overlooked either, receiving multiple Golden Globes and Academy Awards as well.\n\nNow: Duran Duran\n\n16 studio albums later, and the addition/subtraction of the odd member here and there, Duran Duran have enjoyed a bountiful career.\n\nWith their success spanning across the globe, the megastars have collected plenty of Grammy and BRIT Awards over the years. The gang have also bagged themselves a spot on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, with a tour in 2022 as well as being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame!\n\nIn 2022, they performed at Queen Elizabeth II's Platinum Jubilee Concert, as well as the 2022 Birmingham Commonwealth Games Opening Ceremony. Then, in 2023, the band released their Halloween-inspired 16th album 'Danse Macabre', which featured special guests including former members Andy Taylor and Warren Cuccurullo.\n\nThen: Electric Light Orchestra (ELO)\n\nIn 1969, Birmingham-based musicians Roy Wood and Bev Bevan approached Jeff Lynne about joining them in creating music like no other artist, combining violins, cellos, string basses, horns and woodwinds to change the sound of rock. After initially declining, Roy joined the pair in 1970 and Electric Light Orchestra was born.\n\nTheir first album 'The Electric Light Orchestra' was released in December 1971, with their first single titled '10538 Overture' reaching Number 9 in the UK charts. As well as their fame growing, so did the group, with Bill Hunt, Andy Craig, Mike Edwards, Wilfred Gibson, Hugh McDowell and Richard Tandy all joining the band, ahead of their debut concert in 1972.\n\nJeff Lynne later became the front-man for the band, after the departure of multiple members of the group. By 1978, the band had set two music world records, hitting Number 1 in the UK Albums Chart with 'Discovery' in the year to follow.\n\nNow: Electric Light Orchestra (ELO)\n\nMany years, awards, band members and band names later, we now have Jeff Lynne's ELO. Jeff and his band have now played some huge events, including The Grammys in 2015 and Glastonbury in 2016.\n\nIn 2015, Jeff was presented with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and five years later, in 2020, was awarded an O.B.E. for his services to music.\n\nThe group were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2017 and in 2022 Jeff Lynne was nominated for the Songwriters Hall of Fame - in which he was inducted the following year.\n\nThen: Culture Club\n\nIn London, back in 1981, Boy George, Roy Hay, Mikey Craig and Jon Moss teamed up to create the iconic Culture Club. Unimpressed by their demos, EMI Records decided not to sign the band. Luckily for all of us, Virgin Records and Epic Records picked up on the gang, collectively releasing their records across Europe and the US.\n\nDespite Boy George's androgynous style catching the eye of the public and the media, the band's early singles 'White Boy' and 'I'm Afraid of Me' didn't make the charts - but, of course, that didn't stop the gang, with their third single 'Do You Really Want to Hurt Me' flying to the Number 1 spot in the UK, and becoming one of their biggest hits.\n\nNow: Culture Club\n\n40 years and six studio albums later, Culture Club have become one of the most successful British bands of all time. Picking up countless awards, ranging from Best British Group to Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll, the band is no stranger to the odd Grammy or BRIT. Providing huge hits like 'Karma Chameleon' and 'Time (Clock of the Heart)', the band's frontman, Boy George, even received recognition from the Royal family.\n\nThe band are still together, despite the departure of Jon Moss in 2018. In 2022, Boy George took part in I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here!, and was the fourth celebrity to leave the jungle.\n\nThe band are still performing, with Boy George & Culture Club joining Rod Stewart on his summer 2023 UK tour, as well as the frontman also joining Squeeze for a co-headlining tour in summer 2024.\n\nThen: Olivia Newton-John\n\nArguably, Olivia Newton-John's singing career began when she was just 15-years-old, after forming a girl group with some friends in 1963. After performing at coffee shops and local pubs with her friend Pat, Olivia was offered a solo deal with Decca Records in 1966. She then released her first song, a cover, named 'Till You Say You'll Be Mine'.\n\nOlivia soon began to dip her toes in the acting pool, starring in Toomorrow in 1970, before releasing her second single 'If Not For You', reaching Number 7 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\nThroughout the 70s, Olivia really began to make a name for herself as she hosted a popular BBC show, alongside releasing new music. In 1974 she represented the UK in the Eurovision Song Contest and finished in 4th place.\n\nWhilst at a dinner party, Olivia was introduced to film producer Allan Carr, who went on to offer her the lead role of Sandy in his upcoming film adaptation of the Broadway musical, Grease.\n\nThen: Sting\n\nThough it's hard to believe, Sting started out his music career with an abandoned guitar, missing the odd string or two. His real name is Gordon Matthew Thomas Sumner, and his relentless guitar and music practice aided him in his rise to fame by 1977, when he began to play the bass guitar for popular rock band The Police, who released multiple chart-topping albums in the years to follow.\n\nIn 1984, Sting was part of Band Aid's 'Do They Know It's Christmas?', before making his official solo debut in 1985 with his album 'The Dream of the Blue Turtles'.\n\nShowcasing even more of his talents, the star began to feature in films, working on soundtracks, acting and doing voice-overs.\n\nNow: Sting\n\nSting has now released 15 studio albums, six live albums, 10 compilation albums and seven soundtrack albums. He has won countless awards, including 17 Grammys and 25 American Music Awards.\n\nHe received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2000, and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003, as a member of The Police - the same year he received a CBE from the Queen for his services to music.\n\nIn 2022, The Police announced the release of a remastered version of their Around The World documentary, which originally came out in 1982. The new version, called The Police: Around The World Restored & Expanded, has restored footage as well as previously unseen clips.\n\nThe band hit a new milestone when their track 'Every Breath You Take' hit 1 billion views on YouTube in October 2022. That year also saw Sting sell his entire music catalogue, including his solo work and recordings with The Police, in February.\n\nThen: Bon Jovi\n\nJon Bon Jovi began his music career at the young age of 13-years-old, when he played piano and guitar in his first band, Raze. When he was 16, he met David Bryan and formed the band Atlantic City Expressway.\n\nOver the next few years, Jon formed various other bands, performing at clubs and opening for different bands. In 1980, he recorded his first single 'Runaway' at his cousin's studio - which made it to the airwaves via local radio stations.\n\nWhen the song began to gain attention, Jon gave his old pal David a call. The legendary band Bon Jovi was then officially formed in 1983, with singer Jon, keyboardist David, drummer Tico Torres, guitarist Richie Sambora and bassist Alec John Such.\n\nNow: Bon Jovi\n\nThe iconic band has since welcomed some new members, after the departure of some old ones. This includes Phil X, who now plays guitar for the group, and Hugh McDonald on bass.\n\nThe band have made history in the world of rock and roll. With a plethora of awards and recognitions under their belt, from Grammys to World Music Awards and everything in between, it was no surprise when they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018.\n\nIn 2023, the band continued to release new music, in the form of their seasonal track 'Christmas Isn't Christmas'. The following year even saw the release of their very own documentary, titled Thank You, Goodnight: The Bon Jovi Story, which marked the 40th anniversary of the band's recording career, and was made with the full cooperation of past and present members.\n\nThen: Diana Ross\n\nAt just 15-years-old, Diana Ross became one quarter of a girl-group named The Primettes, alongside fellow teenagers Betty McGlown (soon replaced with Barbara Martin), Mary Wilson, and Florence Ballard.\n\nIn 1960, an old neighbour of Diana's helped the group land an audition with their local upstart label Motown, who eventually signed them in 1961 - however, at this point the girls renamed themselves The Supremes. The group's 1964 song 'Where Did Our Love Go?' was a hit, and the group enjoyed years of success.\n\nDiana, however, parted ways with the band in 1970, releasing her first solo single 'Ain't No Mountain High Enough'. The star then began to feature on television specials and magazine covers, as her solo career skyrocketed.\n\nNow: Diana Ross\n\nDiana has achieved a globally ground-breaking solo career in music, television and film. The icon has provided us with timeless smash hits such as 'I'm Coming Out' and 'Upside Down'.\n\nTo this day, a whopping 27 of her singles have reached the Billboard top 40 in the US, with 12 of them in the Billboard top 10, and six of those reaching the Number 1 spot. Gaining herself countless awards, including the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, the superstar even bagged herself a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nShe made a spectacular return to music in 2021 with the release of her album 'Thank You', and followed it up with a tour by the same name, which included her incredible performance at the esteemed Glastonbury Festival, in the Legends slot.\n\nThen: Madness\n\nMike Barson, Chris Foreman and Lee Thompson originally formed the band back in 1976, under the name of the North London Invaders. Recruiting three more members, the band lasted a year as a six-piece before gaining the attention of Graham McPherson (AKA Suggs) at a garden party, in 1977, who then joined as lead vocals.\n\nOver the course of the next year, the band went through a flurry of members departing and joining the group, and after temporarily changing their name to Morris and the Minors, they officially renamed themselves Madness in 1979, with seven members.\n\n1979 proved quite the year for the group - whilst gaining a following in London, the band recorded their first single 'The Prince', which was a surprise hit, getting to Number 16 in the UK charts. They then toured with the Specials and the Selecter, before recording their debut album.\n\nNow: Madness\n\nThe band have changed their sound over the years, providing us with huge global hits such as 'It Must Be Love', 'House Of Fun' and 'Our House'. Despite breaking up in 1986, half-way through their seventh album, the band have had various reunions and re-releases of their classic songs.\n\nGaining various awards over their impressive career, including the Ivor Novello Award from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors, for Outstanding Song Collection, it's no surprise the band became the second ever act to be honoured on the Music Walk Of Fame in London.\n\n2023 saw the release of the band's 13th studio album, 'Theatre of the Absurd Presents C'est la Vie', which saw them complete their 'C'est La Vie Tour' dates in November of that year, as well as carrying out summer shows the following year. Moreover, Madness' 13th album saw them score their first ever UK Number 1 - 44 years into their distinguished recording career.\n\nNow: Kim Wilde\n\nKim has enjoyed a varied career. Famed for her hit debut single 'Kids in America', which aided her in winning the Brit Award for Best British Female solo artist, she has gone on to become a DJ, author and television presenter, selling over 10 million albums and 20 million singles worldwide.\n\nShe has provided us with a whopping 14 studio albums, five compilation albums and 60 music videos over four decades, with her latest album release being in 2018. She is still performing and embarked on a 'Greatest Hits Tour' in 2022.\n\nAs well as her musical talent, Kim has a keen interest in gardening - for which she has released several books, appeared on TV shows and won awards.\n\nThen: Annie Lennox\n\nAnnie began her rise to fame back in 1977 as a member of the British rock and pop band The Tourists. Three years later, Annie and her fellow bandmate David A. Stewart parted ways with the group, and formed a duo named Eurythmics.\n\nThey enjoyed great success together, providing hit songs such as 'Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)', 'The Miracle of Love' and 'Love Is A Stranger'.\n\nOver a decade later, Annie parted ways with David and embarked on a solo career, releasing her debut album 'Diva' in 1992. This proved a promising start for the singer, shooting to the Number 1 spot on the UK Albums Chart.\n\nNow: Annie Lennox\n\nSix studio albums later, Annie Lennox is not only an extremely talented singer-songwriter, but is now recognised as a political activist and philanthropist. With various Academy Awards and Golden Globes under her belt, the icon has also been presented with the American Music Award of Merit for her humanitarian efforts.\n\nIt therefore came as no surprise when she was appointed an OBE by the Queen for her \"tireless charity campaigns and championing of humanitarian causes\".\n\nIn 2022, Eurythmics received a nomination for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for the second time. Speaking about the nomination, Annie said: \"Dave and I have a long history. We've pretty much done everything it takes to survive in the industry of music, just like all the artists who've been nominated for the Hall of Fame. We each have our individual pathway and our own unique life stories, through music-making, recording, and performance.\" The group was officially inducted in a ceremony on 5th November.\n\nThen: Billy Joel\n\nBorn William Martin Joel in 1949, Billy Joel began studying piano at just four-years-old. 10 years later, he joined his first band The Echoes, which was later renamed The Lost Souls.\n\nDespite recording albums with various bands over the next few years, it wasn't until 1971 that he signed a solo recording contract, releasing his first album 'Cold Spring Harbor'. Despite keeping a low profile following a reported contractual dispute, Columbia Records tracked the singer down in 1973 and signed him - it was this year he then recorded his legendary album 'Piano Man'.\n\nHe went on to record multiple albums with the label, including his 1977 release 'The Stranger', which became Columbia's best-selling release, selling over 10 million copies and providing countless hit singles, such as 'Just the Way You Are' and 'Only the Good Die Young'.\n\nNow: Billy Joel\n\nBilly Joel has gone onto record a whopping 13 studio albums, achieving numerous awards and becoming an icon in the world of music. Gaining himself the nickname 'Piano Man', due to the roaring success of his single of the same name, Billy was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland. He was also inducted into the Madison Square Garden Walk of Fame, before receiving his very own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nAfter his 1985 compilation album, 'Greatest Hits Vol. 1 & 2', became one of the best-selling albums in the United States, it's no surprise that the legend has also won countless Grammy Awards, as well as American Music, Billboard and People's Choice Awards.\n\nHis 1990 shows were captured in the Billy Joel: Live At Yankee Stadium film, released in 2022 - with interviews and behind-the-scenes footage alongside the performances. The singer is set to come to the UK for just one date in 2024, performing in Cardiff as part of his world tour.\n\nThen: Donna Summer\n\nLaDonna Adrian Gaines' rise to stardom began in the 1950s, when she was just 10-years-old, performing at church and in school musicals. Before graduating, Donna headed to New York where she joined blues rock group Crow. After parting from the group, she moved to Munich to perform in a musical, Hair, and became fluent in German, taking part in other productions. Three years later, she moved to Vienna where she joined the Vienna Volksoper opera house, and briefly toured with a group named Family Tree.\n\nDespite releasing various singles in the years to follow, it wasn't until 1974 that Donna signed her first big record deal, releasing her first album, 'Lady of the Night', that same year. Despite initially signing as Donna Sommer, an error on the record cover changed the spelling to Donna Summer - and the name stuck!\n\nThen: Bryan Adams\n\nBorn in 1959 in Canada, Bryan Adams spent his early life travelling to various diplomatic postings with his parents. He bought his first guitar when he was 12-years-old, and left school to join a band named Shock. His love for music flourished from this young age, going on to use his college funds to buy a grand piano. He soon started working with bands in the Vancouver music scene, dabbling as a studio session singer.\n\nAt 15-years-old, he became the vocalist for pub band Sweeney Todd. Despite releasing a relatively successful album with the band, Bryan left when he was 16, and began co-writing recordings with Jim Vallance for some huge names throughout the 1980s. Bryan began to find solo fame after he signed to A & M records, for one dollar, in 1979. He then released his debut solo album in 1980, which was certified gold in Canada in 1986.\n\nNow: Bryan Adams\n\nByran Adams has gone on to lead an incredibly successful career, producing huge hits such as '(Everything I Do) I Do It For You', 'Heaven' and, of course, 'Summer Of '69'.\n\nHe has received the prestigious Order Of British Columbia Award, as well as being made an Officer of the Order of Canada for his contributions to popular music and philanthropic work through his foundation, helping improve worldwide education for people. He's also received the Governor General's Performing Arts Award, as well as the Allan Waters Humanitarian Award for his charitable concerts and campaigning over the years.\n\nIn 2002 and 2012, he became a recipient of the Queen's Golden Jubilee Medal and Diamond Jubilee Medal. Adding to the list, Bryan was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame, as well as multiple Canadian Walks of Fame. Of course, he also picked up plenty of Grammy, Billboard and Juno Awards over the year (to name a few).\n\nHe released his latest album 'So Happy It Hurts' in 2022, along with re-recording and releasing new music videos for several of his older tracks. In 2024, he carried out a six-date tour of the UK, with the shows seeing the legend perform tracks from his latest album, as well as songs from his impressive back catalogue.\n\nAs well as being an incredible musician, Bryan is an award-winning photographer, and he has even spoken about turning his hand to filmmaking.\n\nNow: Bee Gees\n\nSpanning over five decades, the band created an impressive 22 studio albums over the course of their career, including four soundtrack albums, including the iconic 'Saturday Night Fever'.\n\nHonoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the boys were also inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, Florida's Artists Hall of Fame, ARIA Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The Bee Gees were also appointed as CBEs for their contribution to music.\n\nSadly, Maurice passed away in 2003 and Robin Gibb passed away in 2012. Huge names such as Sir Cliff Richard and Ringo Starr paid tribute to the stars. In 2018, Barry Gibb paid tribute to his late brothers, after being knighted by Prince Charles at Buckingham Palace.\n\nThen: The Beatles\n\nIt was back in 1957 that the legendary Beatles formed, and it all started with a blossoming friendship between John Lennon and Paul McCartney. The two began performing together when John, who was just 16-years-old at the time, was performing the folk/jazz/blues band the Quarrymen. He was introduced to Paul, who was 15-years-old at the time, by a bandmate whilst setting up for a gig, and they played in the band together for a few years.\n\nAfter John's original Quarrymen band-mates left the group, members such as George Harrison, Stuart Sutcliffe and Pete Best joined the group, officially naming themselves The Beatles. It wasn't until 1962, after Stuart and Pete's departure, that Ringo Starr officially joined the crew.\n\nNow: The Beatles\n\nThe Beatles made music history during their 10-year reign, making a huge cultural impact with their influences on music, fashion and even film.\n\nThroughout their years, they provided us with timeless classics such as 'Here Comes the Sun', 'Hey Jude', 'Come Together' and 'Let it Be'. Sadly, John passed away in 1980, and George passed away in 2001. Ringo and Paul have since worked together on numerous projects and performances.\n\nNominated for well over 100 awards, it's no surprise that members Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr were knighted for their services to music in 1997 and 2018 respectively.\n\nThe band set numerous World Records, including Most Recorded Song, Most US Number One Albums, and Most US Number One Singles, and reined in countless Grammy Awards. The Beatles appear in the Grammy Hall of Fame, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the UK Music Hall of Fame (to name a few) - and, of course, have their very own shiny star of the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\n2016 even saw the release of their very own documentary, The Beatles: Eight Days a Week, about their touring years in the 1960s. This was followed by The Beatles: Get Back in 2021, which showed previously unseen footage and unheard audio of the band in 1969, including their last live performance as a group. Then, in 2024, The Beatles feature film Let It Be was made available to stream for the first time in 50 years, after being carefully restored by Peter Jackson's Park Road Post Production.\n\nThe remaining members of the band released their final song in 2023, titled 'Now And Then'. The song was created with the help of film director Peter Jackson, who helped to isolate some audio of John Lennon recorded in the 70s.\n\nThen: Paul McCartney\n\nPaul rose to fame as the co-vocalist in the legendary British rock band The Beatles. But it all started when Paul was just 15-years-old, when he met John Lennon and joined his band named the Quarrymen, in 1957.\n\nIt was just three years later that The Beatles were formed, enjoying their first hit single 'Love Me Do' in 1963. Beatlemania soon took over, with Paul being referred to as the 'cute Beatle'. Despite only staying together until 1970, the band made true music history and Paul continued with a solo career.\n\nNow: Paul McCartney\n\nPaul McCartney has gone on to become one of the most successful music composers and performers of all time. His services to music have led him to being knighted by Queen Elizabeth II, as well as being appointed as a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) the Order of the British Empire (MBE).\n\nWinning close to 20 Grammy Awards, Paul has also been inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame twice - as a solo artist and as a member of The Beatles. Of course, he has had his fair share of BRIT, NME, American Music and Critic's Choice Awards over his impressive career.\n\nPaul has been part of several bands over the years including Wings, and he continues to tour and release new music. In 2022, he surprised fans with a duet with John Lennon, who appeared on the screen behind him to sing part of 'I've Got a Feeling' at his Glatsonbury Festival headline.\n\nThen: Rod Stewart\n\nIt's hard to imagine, but Rod Stewart started off his working life as a newspaper delivery boy, with dreams of becoming a professional footballer. It wasn't until he was around 16-years-old that he became involved with instrumental rock band The Raiders in 1961. Over the next couple of years, Rod began to don his now iconic 'spiky rooster' hairstyle (thanks to a mixture of sugar water and his sister's hair spray) and was a member of several bands, including the Dimensions, Steampacket, Soul Agents, Shotgun Express and The Jeff Beck Group.\n\nAfter recording his first single in 1964, he was officially signed as a solo artist in 1968, and released his debut album 'An Old Raincoat Won't Ever Let You Down' in 1969 - whilst also performing as a vocalist in the band Faces.\n\nNow: Rod Stewart\n\nToday, Rod Stewart is one of the best-selling artists of all time, creating an astounding 32 studio albums in his time and a whopping 22 compilation albums, selling 120 million records worldwide.\n\nHis 30th album, 'Blood Red Roses', hit the Number 1 spot in the UK Albums Chart in 2018, showing that even after five decades he sure hadn't lost his touch. In 2021, he released his his 31st album 'The Tears of Hercules', and in 2024 his collaborative album 'Swing Fever' with legendary pianist Jools Holland - which hit the Number 1 spot in the UK album chart.\n\nThe icon's services to music and charity have led to him being knighted, as well as him being appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). He has been inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as well as the UK Music Hall of Fame, and has his very own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nThen: Blondie\n\nRock band Blondie made a name for themselves as pioneers of the American new wave scene in the 70s and 80s, with singer Debbie Harry's unique voice leading hit songs like 'Call Me', 'Heart of Glass', 'One Way Or Another' and 'Maria'.\n\nBlondie formed in 1974, when Debbie Harry and Chris Stein left their former bands in order to create a new group with Billy O'Connor (drums) and Fred Smith (bass). Originally named Angel and the Snake for two shows in August 1974, they renamed themselves Blondie in October 1974, as well as welcoming Ivan Kral on guitar. The band's new name was inspired by catcalling truck drivers, who used to exclaim \"Hey, Blondie\" to Debbie as they drove by.\n\nBlondie's debut self-titled album was released in 1976, and over the following year the band toured with artists such as David Bowie and Iggy Pop. In 1977 they released their second album, 'Plastic Letters', which hit the Number 10 spot in the UK and included tracks such as 'Denise' and '(I'm Always Touched by Your) Presence, Dear'. Their third album, released a year later in 1978 'Parallel Lines' was a huge success, flying to the Number 1 spot, and is widely considered their most successful to this day.\n\nNow: Blondie\n\n11 studio albums and an estimated 40 million album sales later, Blondie has become one of the most influential bands in music history, famed for their eclectic mix of musical styles, including disco, pop, reggae, and early rap.\n\nThe band were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006, as well as being inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2016. They have, of course, picked up their fair share of awards, including the NME Godlike Genius Award and Q Music Award for Q Inspiration Award.\n\nDebbie Harry even made it into the Guinness World Book of Records in 1999, age 53, as the Oldest Female Singer to Reach No. 1 in the UK Chart.\n\nThe group went on their 'Against The Odds' tour across the UK in April and May 2022, although co-founder Chris Stein unfortunately had to pull out of the shows due to a heart condition.\n\nOn top of performing a headline set at Glastonbury Festival 2023, the band has new music in the works.\n\nThen: Bruce Springsteen\n\nBruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen was born in 1949, and was around 15-years-old when he bought his first guitar for $18.95, after being inspired by seeing The Beatles live. It wasn't long before he joined a band named the Rogues and began playing for live audiences.\n\nLater in 1964, his mother took out a loan to buy him a $60 Kent guitar, which helped him on his way to become the lead guitarist, and later lead singer, of a band named the Castiles. The band recorded two singles, and played live at various venues in New York.\n\nBruce spent the next few years performing in various bands and trios, before being signed to Columbia Records in 1972, forming a new band named the E Street Band in order to record his debut album, 'Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.', which was released in 1973.\n\nNow: Bruce Springsteen\n\nBy the release of his third album, 'Born to Run', Bruce had achieved worldwide fame. Almost five decades later, he has released 21 studio albums, 23 live albums and has plenty of multi-Platinum certifications under his belt.\n\nBruce has produced huge hits over his time, including the epic track 'Born in the U.S.A.', 'Dancing In the Dark' and 'I'm On Fire'. Inducted into both the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Bruce has bagged himself 20 Grammy Awards, two Golden Globes and an Academy Award over the years. Bruce was also awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama.\n\nProving his endless talents, he even picked up a Tony Award in 2018 for Springsteen on Broadway, which was held at the Walter Kerr Theatre in New York City. In 2021, Bruce released a book with Barak Obama, based on their hugely successful podcast series, titled Renegades: Born in the USA.\n\nAfter releasing his latest studio album 'Only The Strong Survive' in November 2022, Bruce went on tour in 2023 and 2024 with his E Street Band - with them returning to the UK to perform four dates, in May and July 2024. A documentary is set for release in October 2024 showing the band's preparation for their 2023/2024 world tour.\n\nThen: Cyndi Lauper\n\nInspired by artists such as The Beatles and Judy Garland, Cyndi Lauper was just 12-years-old when she began writing songs and playing an acoustic guitar, which was given to her by her sister. From a young age, she began to express herself through eccentric clothing and a variety of hair colours.\n\nShe was just 17-years-old when she left home, and began performing as a vocalist with various cover bands. In 1978, Lauper met saxophone player John Turi and formed a band named the Blue Angel. Cyndi's voice on their demo tape began to gain attention, however she was not willing to sign a solo deal due to wanting the band to be involved.\n\nSadly, Blue Angels' album was not a success, and the band ended up splitting. Cyndi then spent 1981 working in retail stores, waitressing and singing in local clubs. She was eventually signed as a solo artist later that year, and released her debut album 'She's So Unusual' in 1983.\n\nCyndi Lauper\n\nCyndi is now undeniably a music icon, who has made a lasting impact. After her debut album, 'She's So Unusual', made her the first woman with four Top 5 hits from a single album, it comes as no surprise she's sold over 50 million records worldwide. Providing us with anthems such as 'Girls Just Want to Have Fun' and 'Time After Time', she earned herself two Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist.\n\nThe singer cemented her legendary status even further when she co-wrote music for the Tony Award-winning musical Kinky Boots - which led to her bagging a Grammy and being inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.\n\nA strong LGBTQ+ advocate, Cyndi co-founded True Colors United to aid homeless LGBTQ+ youth. She continues her social activism to this day, as well as continuing to record and tour, with her embarking on her 'Girls Just Wanna Have Fun Farewell Tour' in 2025.\n\nThen: Dire Straits\n\nDire Straits was formed in London back in 1977, under the name the Café Racers, by Mark Knopfler, David Knopfler, John Illsley and Pick Withers. Brothers Mark and David are from Newcastle upon Tyne, with Mark working as an art college teacher and David working as a social worker at the time of the band's formation. Pick had spent most of the 1970s playing the drums for various bands, so was no stranger to the world of music when the band formed.\n\nAfter the band had been turned down by a record label, the group sought out advice from DJ Charlie Gillett, the presenter of radio show Honky Tonk, on their demo track. When he liked what he heard, he decided to play the band's track 'Sultans of Swing' on his show. It was just two months later that they signed their first record deal, releasing their debut album 'Dire Straits' in October 1978.\n\nNow: Dire Straits\n\nNow, Dire Straits are one of the world's best-selling music artists, with six studio albums, three live albums and three compilation albums, their estimated album sales are over 100 million.\n\nThe group was active from 1977 to 1988, then once more from 1991 to 1995, providing us with huge hit songs such as 'Romeo and Juliet', 'Walk Of Life' and 'Money For Nothing', and welcoming members such as Alan Clark and Guy Fletcher.\n\nThey have won countless awards, including Grammys, BRIT, Juno and MTV Awards, and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018. They were even commemorated with a Heritage Award from PRS for Music, with a plaque placed at the location where they played their first gig in Deptford, London.\n\nThen: Erasure\n\nThe English synth-pop duo, consisting of Andy Bell and Vince Clarke, formed in London back in 1985. Vince was inspired to make electronic music from a young age, having been influenced by synth back Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark.\n\nThis led him to co-forming the electronic music band Depeche Mode, writing their first three singles, including 'Just Can't Get Enough'. Vince departed the group in 1981, furthering his career in the synth-pop group Yazoo. He left Yazoo, however, in 1983. It was after this that Vince placed an advert for a vocalist in the weekly music magazine Melody Maker - a move he would not regret, as he soon got a call from Andy Bell, who was quickly chosen by Vince. They soon released their first single 'Who Needs Love Like That' in 1985.\n\nThen: Genesis\n\nPeter Gabriel, Tony Banks, Anthony Phillips, Mike Rutherford and Chris Stewart were all members of a school band at Charterhouse School, in Surrey. By 1967, the disbanding of these groups led Anthony and Mike to form a new band, and thus, Genesis was born.\n\nUsing a friend's home-made studio, the group recorded a demo tape, consisting of six songs, including 'Don't Want You Back' and 'Try a Little Sadness'. Seeking to record professionally, the group sought the help of Charterhouse alumnus Jonathan King, who himself had achieved a UK Top 5 single with 'Everybody's Gone to the Moon'. This proved a good move by the band, as Jonathan immediately helped them sign a one-year recording contract with Decca Records, later releasing their debut album 'From Genesis to Revelation' in 1969. The boys were aged just 15 to 17-years-old at the time!\n\nNow: Genesis\n\n15 studio albums and a few changes of the line-up later, Genesis have become one of England's most successful rock bands. The group have spent 21 weeks in the UK Top 10, with over 20 UK Top 40 singles. Some of these iconic tracks include 'I Can't Dance', 'Land Of Confusion', 'Follow You Follow Me' and 'Mama'.\n\nThey have received Grammy, AMA and Progressive Music Awards in their time, as well as being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010. Genesis' success has inspired a number of tribute bands, which is no surprise with an estimated 150 million albums sold worldwide.\n\nVarious members of the group have continued incredibly successful careers since leaving Genesis, including Peter, Phil and Mike - who formed Mike and the Mechanics in 1985.\n\nThe group embarked on 'The Last Domino? Tour' in 2021 and 2022 after a 13-year hiatus.\n\nThen: Peter Gabriel\n\nPeter Gabriel was born in 1950, and from a young age his teachers and peers could tell he was musically gifted. Despite having measurable singing talents, Peter opted for piano lessons and soon developed an interest in drumming - with his mother purchasing him his first floor tom when he was just 10-years-old.\n\nHe wrote his first song, 'Sammy the Slug', when he was 12-years-old, and the following year he joined the Charterhouse School's band the Milords, on drums and vocals. By 1965, Peter and future band-mate Tony Banks were bonding over their love for music and disinterest in school activities, writing their first song together named 'She is Beautiful'. It was just two years later that the pair, along with Anthony Phillips, Mike Rutherford and Chris Stewart, formed the now world-renowned Genesis.\n\nNow: Peter Gabriel\n\nPeter rose to stardom in Genesis, however departed in 1975 and launched an incredibly successful solo career. Described as one of rock's most ambitious and innovative musicians, Peter has supplied us with nine studio albums, releasing over 40 singles.\n\nHuge hits such as 'Solsbury Hill' and 'In Your Eyes' aided Peter in becoming one of the best-selling artists in the world, picking up countless awards such as Grammys, MTV and World Soundtrack Awards. He even won a record nine MTV Awards at the 1987 MTV Video Music Awards for his hit track 'Sledgehammer'. It's no surprise, therefore, that Peter was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice (as a member of Genesis and as a solo artist).\n\nThen: Phil Collins\n\nPhil Collins was born in 1951 and was just five-years-old when he began playing the drums, after being gifted a toy drum kit for Christmas. It was clear from then that Phil had a gift for music. At that same age, after entering a talent contest at Butlins, legend has it that Phil had to stop his accompanying orchestra half way through his performance, informing them that they were out of key. It wasn't long before his uncle made him a real set, with his parents buying him more complete sets as the years went on.\n\nHe studied drum rudiments as a teenager, as well as reading and writing conventional musical notation, soon forming a band called the Real Thing. It was while being a member of a band called the Freehold, however, that Phil wrote his song 'Lying Crying Dying'. It wasn't until the mid 1970s that Phil then joined the English rock band Genesis, after the departure of their drummer John Mayhew.\n\nNow: Phil Collins\n\nAfter spending years enjoying fame within Genesis, Phil began to enjoy solo fame in the 1980s, before leaving the band in 1996. He then embarked on a chart-topping and historic solo career, releasing huge hit songs such as 'In The Air Tonight', 'You Can't Hurry Love' and 'Another Day in Paradise'. Known for his distinctive drum sound, Phil was recruited to write and perform songs for Disney's Tarzan in 1999. The songs were huge hits, with his track 'You'll Be in My Heart' winning him an Oscar, Academy and Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. His work on the soundtrack also led him to receiving the Disney Legend Award in 2002.\n\nDabbling in the world of film and television, Phil also made appearances on the big screen. He had a cameo appearance in Steven Spielberg's Hook, as well as starring in British rom-com Buster.\n\nPhil has been inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, as well as the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (once as a member of Genesis and again as a solo artist). Phil's iconic work has also bagged him his very own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, whilst his charity work led him to being appointed a Lieutenant of the Royal Victorian Order (LVO).\n\nHe took part in Genesis' reunion tour in 2021 and 2022 and at the last show addressed the crowd to say: \"It's the last stop of our tour, and it's the last show for Genesis. After tonight we've all got to get real jobs.\"\n\nThen: Roxette\n\nThe Swedish pop-rock duo, consisting of Marie Fredriksson and Per Gessle joined forces back in 1986 after they both left their previous music groups. Per fronted a band named Gyllene Tider, which Marie began singing with in 1981. It wasn't until five years later that Marie and Per began to sing together, after Rolf Nygren, Managing Director of EMI at the time, suggested doing so. Marie was around 28-years-old, while Per was around 27-years-old.\n\nLater in 1986, released their first single, 'Neverending Love', which featured on their debut album 'Pearls of Passion', under the name Roxette.\n\nNow: Roxette\n\nRoxette have become Sweden's second-best-selling music act, with ABBA taking the top spot. They have provided huge hits such as 'It Must Have Been Love' and 'Listen To Your Heart', which have accumulated over 5 million radio plays and both with BMI Awards.\n\nThe duo are thought to have sold over 75 million records worldwide, achieving both gold and platinum certifications for multiple albums. They also won countless awards, including Grammy's, MTV and World Music Awards.\n\nSadly Marie passed away in December 2019. On the day of her death, the music video for 'It Must Have Been Love' reached over 430 million views on YouTube.\n\nThen: Tears For Fears\n\nTears for Fears was formed by Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith in 1981, after the disbanding of their first group Graduate. The group started out as a new wave synthesizer band, slowly branching out into mainstream pop. The pair met when they were just teenagers, and as Graduate released an album named 'Acting My Age' and a single called 'Elvis Should Play Ska'. The releases performed moderately well, however in 1981 Roland and Carl departed from the band and created their own, named History of Headaches.\n\nTheir new band would follow the influence of artists such as Talking Heads and Peter Gabriel, and after the addition of surrounding musicians they changed their name to Tears For Fears. 1981 proved a monumental year for the group, with them being signed to Phonogram Records and then releasing their first single 'Suffer the Children'.\n\nNow: Tears For Fears\n\nThe group achieved huge worldwide success, with their debut album 'The Hurting' reaching Number 1 in the UK Albums Chart, their second album 'Songs from the Big Chair; reaching Number 1 on the US Billboard 200 and their third album 'The Seeds of Love' going platinum.\n\nThe duo have won BRIT and MTV Awards, as well as having been nominated for a Grammy Award, thanks to huge hits such as 'Everybody Wants To Rule The World', 'Shout' and 'Mad World'.\n\nDespite taking various breaks throughout their career, the band have toured consistently and played popular music festivals, such as the Newmarket Nights festival in 2016 and the Forest Live festival in 2019.\n\nIn 2022, the band released their 'The Tipping Point' album which was their first new album since 2004. They also performed at venues across the UK over the summer as part of their 'The Tipping Point' tour. In June 2023, the band released more new music, in the form of a radio remix of 'Rivers Of Mercy', to coincide with their return to the UK to perform three shows in support of their latest album.\n\nThen: Marvin Gaye\n\nSinger and songwriter Marvin Gaye started out as part of band The Marquees, he then went on to become a session musician which led to him signing for Motown Records, and it was his solo career that really took off.\n\nHe was a prominent part of Motown Records in the 60s, with songs like 'Ain't That Peculiar', 'I Heard It Through The Grapevine', 'Pride and Joy' and 'How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)'.\n\nHis success continued into the 70s, as he released hugely popular albums 'What's Going On' and 'Let's Get It On'.\n\nThen: Earth, Wind & Fire\n\nStarted by Maurice White in 1969, the Earth, Wind and Fire line-up included his brother Verdine and from 1974 their brother Fred joined as well. Other notable members include co-lead singer Philip Bailey and drummer Ralph Johnson.\n\nThe band's name came from Maurice's astrological sign which includes earth, air and fire. He tweaked the name to sound better and Earth, Wind & Fire was born!\n\nThe group's line-up changed several times over the years as they got their start, and it was their 1975 album 'That's the Way of the World' that really shot them to fame. Some of their biggest hits from their career include 'Boogie Wonderland', 'September' and 'Shining Star'.\n\nThe band went on hiatus from 1984 to 1987 but came together to release their 'Touch The World' album.\n\nNow: The Jam\n\nThe Jam broke up in 1982 having released six studio albums and one live album in their time together. The band members went on to join other bands as well as pursue solo careers.\n\nAlthough there is no word of a The Jam reunion, former bandmates Bruce Foxton and Paul Weller worked together on two songs from Paul's album 'Wake Up the Nation' in 2010. That same year, the two performed on stage together for the first time in 28 years during Paul's residency at the Royal Albert Hall in London.\n\nA documentary about The Jam aired in 2015 called The Jam: About The Young Idea and an interactive exhibition of the same name was opened in Liverpool the following year, complete with memorabilia from the band.\n\nNow: The Pet Shop Boys\n\nAmong numerous other awards, The Pet Shop Boys have won three BRIT Awards in their career, including a Lifetime Achievement Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music in 2009.\n\nTheir latest album to date is 2024 release 'Nonetheless', which is their 15th studio album after following 2020's 'Hotspot'.

His brother Duncan replaced him as lead singer.\n\nIn 2014, a new group called UB40 featuring Ali Campbell, Astro and Micky Virtue formed with the former UB40 band members. The rest of UB40 continued performing and releasing music under the original name.\n\nIn 2021, sadly saxophonist Brian Travers and Astro both passed away. The following year Ali Campbell embarked on a tour which was meant to include Astro, saying that he was performing in honour of his late friend and bandmate.\n\n2022 also saw UB40 celebrate their 45th anniversary with an album and tour called 'UB45', which came out in 2024.

Their name change came about after their manager Tony Hall was inspired by the tagline on a Coca-Cola advert. Eddy ended up joining the group, while Kenny left in 1974.\n\nThe group went on to bring out hits like 'You To Me Are Everything', 'Can You Feel the Force?', 'Can't Get By Without You', and 'Children of the Ghetto', and were the first all-black British band to get a Number 1 song in the UK pop charts.\n\nRay Lake left in 1991 and the group continued as a trio.
