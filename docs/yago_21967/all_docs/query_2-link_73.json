        "text": "Actor Ali Fazal is reminiscing his fondest memories of working in Death on the Nile (2022), a film directed by Kenneth Branagh based on the book by the same name by legendary author Agatha Christie. The actor recently took to Instagram and shared a throwback behind-the-scenes picture from the film’s set in which he can be seen goofing with his fellow actors as they sit on the floor and pose for the camera.\n\n​​​​​​​\n\nHe wrote in the caption, “Sinister and stupid he he .. when we had ample time to kill among other peeps!!! To the whodunnits of all time and being part of it and to these wonderful people I worked with not too long ago... Rose’s mould statue is accompanying us too... Agatha Christie’s Death on the Nile directed by Sir Kenneth Brannagh.. #agathachristie.”"
