        "text": "Laurence Olivier's \"Henry V\"\n\nPoster from the First Cinema Release\n\nUnited Artists, 1944\n\nUK Quad\n\n30 inches x 40 inches\n\n\"I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,\n\nStraining upon the start. The game's afoot:\n\nFollow your spirit, and upon this charge\n\nCry \"God for Harry, England, and SAINT GEORGE...!\"\n\nThere have been few renderings of the rallying cry, penned by Shakespeare in his Henry V, which are as poignant and spine-tingling as that delivered by Laurence Olivier in his 1944 film-version of the play. The lines come as an English army, which has landed in Normandy, prepares to charge once more at the enemy's lines during the Battle of Harfleur. It was no coincidence that Olivier chose to make this film at a time when English forces were again involved in a conflict in exactly the same geographical place. Accordingly the film was \"dedicated to the 'Commandos and Airborne Troops of Great Britain the spirit of whose ancestors it has been humbly attempted to recapture.'\"\n\nSt George's day is, of course, also the birthday of William Shakespeare. This scarce UK Quad size poster (measuring 30 inches x 40 inches) is for the first cinema release of Laurence Olivier's \"Henry V\" in 1944. The image in the poster depicts the exact moment in the film where Olivier delivers the famous \"Once more unto the breach\" speech which concludes \"Cry God for Harry, England, and Saint George!\". The predominantly red and white colouring of the poster mirrors the St George's Cross flag of England."
