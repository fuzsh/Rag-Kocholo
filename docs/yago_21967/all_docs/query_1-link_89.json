Branagh is best known for his exceptional adaptations of Shakespearean plays and directing blockbusters such as Marvel’s Thor and Hamlet which had earned several award nominations.

It received worldwide praise and three Oscar nominations. Branagh had also won the British Academy Film Award for best direction for the film and the movie was rated number 1 on the list of Greatest Shakespeare movies on Rotten Tomatoes. Ambitious and precise in his work, Branagh brought Shakespeare’s Hamlet to the big screen and it has been regarded as one of the best film adaptions of the play.\n\nMaking an immense impression on the industry with his work, Branagh has received prestigious awards including the Lifetime Achievement Award at the RomaFictionFest, and created a milestone for becoming the first man to be nominated for five different categories for the Academy Awards. Outside of his work on screen, Branagh has written books about the making of his films. His autobiography titled ‘Beginning’ was published in 1989.
