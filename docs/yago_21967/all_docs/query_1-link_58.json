        "text": "Kenneth Branagh made his directorial debut in 1989 with Henry V, which he also wrote the screenplay for and starred in as the title character. If you're the director... you can cast yourself as the lead.\n\nIn 2017 he portrayed the iconic Agatha Christie character Hercule Poirot in Murder on the Orient Express. We can look for him to reprise the role of the Belgian detective in this year's Death on the Nile.\n\nIf you're not familiar with the story, originally published in 1937, Death on the Nile is set in Egypt, where Poirot is on vacation. He’s off the clock from investigating crimes, but when there’s a murder, he finds he can’t turn his back on the troubling situation.\n\nThe 1978 film adaptation starred Peter Ustinov as Poirot, who was joined by Bette Davis, Mia Farrow, Dame Maggie Smith, Angela Lansbury and David Niven. Lois Chiles played Linnet Ridgeway Doyle, the role which Gal Gadot (Wonder Woman) will be taking on in the 2020 adaptation.\n\nComingSoon.net had a chat with Branagh asking if Poirot might return to TV, with him saying, \"He's been such a robust character since she (Agatha Christie) first produced him, invented him, all those years ago... and across all of those stories.\"\n\nHe went on to say, \"Of all her characters, I think he's the one to most likely to have that possibility.\"\n\nHe didn't give a hard yes, but it wasn't a no... so, we'll take it.\n\nBranagh addressed the forthcoming film specifically, saying, \"I do think that Michael Green, with his screenplay of Death on the Nile, has deepened and extended the possibility of what this modern version of the character might do.\"\n\nCircling back to TV, Branagh ponders the idea of expanding past the big screen, saying, \"I can imagine the possibility of him stepping across various media is entirely possible. I don't know how likely? But, it is certainly possible.\"\n\nSide note: He really likes the word \"possible.\"\n\nSumming up the chat, he ends on this note, saying, \"If there are enough hours in the day and enough people who want to see it, we'll try and make it happen.\"\n\nWell, there are 24 hours in the day, and who needs sleep?!\n\nIn the meantime, BBC Studios' BritBox has a complete collection of Poirot adaptations, starring David Suchet. There are 12 regular seasons (1989 - 2010) and a 2013 standalone season called \"Poirot's Final Cases.\""
