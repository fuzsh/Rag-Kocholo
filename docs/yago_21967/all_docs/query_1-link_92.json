        "text": "Last week, I made two references to Kenneth Branagh’s “Henry V.” One was in a review of the sublime new “Cinderella,” which Branagh directed. The other was in a column, in which I used Branagh’s Henry as an example of an inspiring character.\n\nBranagh’s “Henry V” came out in 1989. I remember seeing it one snowy night in December of that year at the Nickelodeon in Boston. (On the ride home, my friends Shawn and Randy and I saw a car swerve off Route 132 in Hyannis and go flying into a gully below, landing in some tree branches. The driver, who seemed more concerned about the wrapped presents in the car than the condition of the car or himself, appeared to be OK.)\n\nI don’t have a great ear for Shakespeare (“What’s that guy in the tights saying?”). But the Irish-born Branagh – who, yet to turn 30, directed, wrote the screenplay and played the title character – made a point in “Henry V” (and subsequent films) of bringing the bard to modern audiences in a way that seemed relevant and alive.\n\nAnd, boy, did he succeed.\n\nThe story involves young King Henry, new to the English throne, trying to prove himself worthy of his new position as the leader of his country. Up to this point, he’s been known as a playboy, a carouser, and so there are those who doubt his abilities to lead. When he lays claim to land previously considered to be on French soil, the French respond by dismissively sending him tennis balls to amuse himself with instead.\n\nBig mistake. Henry responds with a measured, confident fury that, again and again, inspires his army and intimidates his rivals as England and France go to war. The highlight is his fiery speech before the Battle of Agincourt. Unbelievable.\n\nHe is more than up to the challenge: He leaves his unruly past behind and proves he has the strength, courage, honor, intelligence and other virtues (even wit!) to be a great king.\n\nThe character and the movie blew me away, and I became an instant Branagh fan. I eventually got to take part in a small-group luncheon interview with him and two somewhat larger press conferences – all in Boston – for subsequent films, including “Dead Again” and “Hamlet.” (He was great, by the way: brilliant, friendly and hilarious, often in a self-deprecating way. My favorite moment was when he acted out, with a flawless American accent, two moviegoers ripping into him and one of his movies during a test screening. Gut-bustingly funny.)\n\nMeanwhile, especially in the early ’90s, I seemed to make a lot of references to “Henry V” in my movie-writing, and my friend-colleague Cindy, who edited a lot of my work at the time, would tease me about this.\n\nOne day, she came up to me and said she finally figured out why I loved ‘Henry V’ so much.\n\nI imagined it was because Branagh’s Henry was so passionate, sarcastic and cool (and noble and deep and all the rest). But Cindy had a more specific take on it.\n\nI had told Cindy lots of stories about my relatively wild youth. She also knew I had changed my ways once I got married and had kids.\n\nSo Cindy’s theory was this: I could relate to Henry. I had this, uh, free-spirited past, but I took my roles as husband and father seriously; I wanted to live up to the responsibilities that came with them. So I changed – consciously, willingly. I had to become, in many ways, a different person, adjust my priorities. I had to try to prove myself worthy of my new roles, just as Henry had.\n\nWow, I thought. Cindy was right. She wasn’t saying I could relate to what a cool badass Henry was, or his specific situation (which would be an indication of insanity on my part, I imagine). But I could relate to the challenge of changing one’s ways.\n\nI thought this was great.\n\nAnd Cindy’s theory provided me with a great lesson: that when we love a movie, or a movie character, it’s probably for a deep, very personal reason. It could be anything from “Animal House” to “Star Wars” – there’s something there that hits home.\n\nFor me, “Henry V” hit home. It still does.\n\nTim Miller’s reviews can be found at www.capecodonline.com/miller. To follow him on Twitter, go to @TimMillerCritic."
