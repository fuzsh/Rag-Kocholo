Burkina Faso has a relatively low urban population, with 30.69% of the population living in cities. The capital and largest city is Ouagadougou, or just Ouaga, with a population of 1.8 million, which covers 84.7 square miles.

Most of the 17 million people in Burkina Faso belong to one of two West African ethnic cultural groups: the Voltaic and the Mande. Voltaic Mossi make up about 50% of the population and are descended from warriors who moved to the area from Ghana around 1100, establishing an empire that lasted over 800 years.

In 1995, the ethnic composition of Burkina Faso was: 48% Mossi, 10% Fulani, 7% Lobi, 7% Bobo, 6.7% Mande, 5% Senufo, 5% Gurunsi, 4.8% Gurma and 3.1% Tuareg.

About 69 languages are spoken in the country, 60 of which are indigenous. About 40% of the population speaks Mossi, although the official language is still French, which was introduced during the country's colonial period.

The median age is just under 17 years old. A 2005 World Health Organization report estimated that almost 73% of girls and women in Burkina Faso have undergone female genital mutilation, which is done according to traditional rituals in the area. Burkina Faso is one of the last great strongholds of slavery in the world, and children in the country are often victims of slavery.

Burkina Faso Population History

The indigenous population, known as the Mossi Kingdom, was in control of the region since the 1000s. In 1895, they defeated French colonial forces to become a French protectorate. The indigenous army again fought the French in 1915, but this time the French won and executed the leaders of the African army. The nation finally got its independence in 1960. As an independent country, Burkina Faso's population flourished, going from growing at 1% annually in 1960 to the robust growth of today.

Since the turn of the millennium, Burkina Faso has experienced a couple of meningitis outbreaks which killed thousands.
