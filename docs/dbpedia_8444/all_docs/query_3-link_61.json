        "text": "Introduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nBackground\n\nBurkina Faso (formerly Upper Volta) achieved independence from France in 1960. Repeated military coups during the 1970s and 1980s were followed by multiparty elections in the early 1990s. Former President Blaise COMPAORE (1987-2014) resigned in late October 2014 following popular protests against his efforts to amend the constitution's two-term presidential limit. An interim administration organized presidential and legislative elections - held in November 2015 - where Roch Marc Christian KABORE was elected president. The country experienced terrorist attacks in its capital in 2016, 2017, and 2018 and continues to mobilize resources to counter terrorist threats mainly in its northern and eastern regions. It experienced over 100 attacks by violent extremists in the first quarter of 2019. Growing insecurity resulted in nearly 500,000 internally displaced persons and more than 2,000 closed schools. The Government of Burkina Faso has made numerous arrests of terrorist suspects, augmented the size of its special terrorism detachmentGroupement des Forces Anti-Terroristes(GFAT) in the country’s north, and joined the newly-created G5 Sahel Joint Force to fight terrorism and criminal trafficking groups with regional neighbors Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger. In 2017, the Sahara Branch of al-Qa’ida in the Islamic Maghreb, al-Murabitoun, Ansar al-Dine, and the Macina Liberation Front came together to form Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM). JNIM and other groups like Ansarul Islam and ISIS in the Greater Sahara operate in Burkina Faso. Burkina Faso's high population growth, recurring drought, pervasive and perennial food insecurity, and limited natural resources result in poor economic prospects for the majority of its citizens. (2019)\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nWestern Africa, north of Ghana\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n13 00 N, 2 00 W\n\nMap references\n\nAfrica\n\nArea\n\ntotal: 274,200 sq km\n\nland: 273,800 sq km\n\nwater: 400 sq km\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 76\n\nArea - comparative\n\nslightly larger than Colorado\n\nLand boundaries\n\ntotal: 3,611 km\n\nborder countries (6): Benin 386 km, Cote d'Ivoire 545 km, Ghana 602 km, Mali 1325 km, Niger 622 km, Togo 131 km\n\nCoastline\n\n0 km(landlocked)\n\nMaritime claims\n\nnone (landlocked)\n\nClimate\n\nthree climate zones including a hot tropical savanna with a short rainy season in the southern half, a tropical hot semi-arid steppe climate typical of the Sahel region in the northern half, and small area of hot desert in the very north of the country bordering the Sahara Desert\n\nTerrain\n\nMostly flat to dissected, undulating plains; hills in the west and southeast.

(2019)\n\nNatural hazards\n\nrecurring droughts\n\nEnvironment - current issues\n\nrecent droughts and desertification severely affecting agricultural activities, population distribution, and the economy; overgrazing; soil degradation; deforestation (2019)\n\nEnvironment - international agreements\n\nparty to: Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Paris Agreement, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Life Conservation, Ozone Layer Protection, Wetlands (2019)\n\nsigned, but not ratified: none of the selected agreements (2019)\n\nGeography - note\n\nlandlocked savanna cut by the three principal rivers of the Black, Red, and White Voltas\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPopulation\n\n19,742,715 (July 2018 est.)\n\nnote: estimates for this country explicitly take into account the effects of excess mortality due to AIDS; this can result in lower life expectancy, higher infant mortality, higher death rates, lower population growth rates, and changes in the distribution of population by age and sex than would otherwise be expected\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 61\n\nNationality\n\nnoun: Burkinabe (singular and plural)\n\nadjective: Burkinabe\n\nEthnic groups\n\nMossi 52%, Fulani 8.4%, Gurma 7%, Bobo 4.9%, Gurunsi 4.6%, Senufo 4.5%, Bissa 3.7%, Lobi 2.4%, Dagara 2.4%, Tuareg/Bella 1.9%, Dioula 0.8%, unspecified/no answer 0.3%, other 7.2% (2010 est.)\n\nLanguages\n\nFrench (official), native African languages belonging to Sudanic family spoken by 90% of the population\n\nReligions\n\nMuslim 61.5%, Roman Catholic 23.3%, traditional/animist 7.8%, Protestant 6.5%, other/no answer 0.2%, none 0.7% (2010 est.)\n\nDemographic profile\n\nBurkina Faso has a young age structure – the result of declining mortality combined with steady high fertility – and continues to experience rapid population growth, which is putting increasing pressure on the country’s limited arable land. More than 65% of the population is under the age of 25, and the population is growing at 3% annually. Mortality rates, especially those of infants and children, have decreased because of improved health care, hygiene, and sanitation, but women continue to have an average of almost 6 children. Even if fertility were substantially reduced, today’s large cohort entering their reproductive years would sustain high population growth for the foreseeable future. Only about a third of the population is literate and unemployment is widespread, dampening the economic prospects of Burkina Faso’s large working-age population.Migration has traditionally been a way of life for Burkinabe, with seasonal migration being replaced by stints of up to two years abroad. Cote d’Ivoire remains the top destination, although it has experienced periods of internal conflict. Under French colonization, Burkina Faso became a main labor source for agricultural and factory work in Cote d’Ivoire. Burkinabe also migrated to Ghana, Mali, and Senegal for work between the world wars. Burkina Faso attracts migrants from Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana, and Mali, who often share common ethnic backgrounds with the Burkinabe. Despite its food shortages and high poverty rate, Burkina Faso has become a destination for refugees in recent years and hosts about 33,500 Malians as of May 2017.

About 80% of the population is engaged in subsistence farming and cotton is the main cash crop. The country has few natural resources and a weak industrial base.Cotton and gold are Burkina Faso’s key exports - gold has accounted for about three-quarters of the country’s total export revenues. Burkina Faso’s economic growth and revenue depends largely on production levels and global prices for the two commodities. The country has seen an upswing in gold exploration, production, and exports.In 2016, the government adopted a new development strategy, set forth in the 2016-2020 National Plan for Economic and Social Development, that aims to reduce poverty, build human capital, and to satisfy basic needs. A new three-year IMF program (2018-2020), approved in 2018, will allow the government to reduce the budget deficit and preserve critical spending on social services and priority public investments.While the end of the political crisis has allowed Burkina Faso’s economy to resume positive growth, the country’s fragile security situation could put these gains at risk. Political insecurity in neighboring Mali, unreliable energy supplies, and poor transportation links pose long-term challenges.\n\nGDP (purchasing power parity)\n\n$35.85 billion (2017 est.)\n\n$33.69 billion (2016 est.)\n\n$31.81 billion (2015 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 126\n\nGDP (official exchange rate)\n\n$12.57 billion (2017 est.)\n\nGDP - real growth rate\n\n6.4% (2017 est.)\n\n5.9% (2016 est.)\n\n3.9% (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 31\n\nGDP - per capita (PPP)\n\n$1,900 (2017 est.)\n\n$1,800 (2016 est.)\n\n$1,800 (2015 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 211\n\nGross national saving\n\n9.3% of GDP (2017 est.)\n\n8.5% of GDP (2016 est.)\n\n5.3% of GDP (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 164\n\nGDP - composition, by end use\n\nhousehold consumption: 56.5% (2017 est.)\n\ngovernment consumption: 23.9% (2017 est.)\n\ninvestment in fixed capital: 24.6% (2017 est.)\n\ninvestment in inventories: 1% (2017 est.)\n\nexports of goods and services: 28.4% (2017 est.)\n\nimports of goods and services: -34.4% (2017 est.)\n\nGDP - composition, by sector of origin\n\nagriculture: 31% (2017 est.)\n\nindustry: 23.9% (2017 est.)\n\nservices: 44.9% (2017 est.)\n\nAgriculture - products\n\ncotton, peanuts, shea nuts, sesame, sorghum, millet, corn, rice;

Burkinabe children are forced to work as farm hands, gold panners and washers, street vendors, domestic servants, and beggars or in the commercial sex trade, with some transported to nearby countries; to a lesser extent, Burkinabe women are recruited for legitimate jobs in the Middle East or Europe and subsequently forced into prostitution; women from other West African countries are also lured to Burkina Faso for work and subjected to forced prostitution, forced labor in restaurants, or domestic servitude\n\ntier rating: Tier 2 Watch List – Burkina Faso does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so; law enforcement efforts decreased in 2014, with a significant decline in trafficking prosecutions (none for forced begging involving Koranic school teachers – a prevalent form of trafficking) and no convictions, a 2014 law criminalizing the sale of children, child prostitution, and child pornography is undermined by a provision allowing offenders to pay a fine in lieu of serving prison time proportionate to the crime; the government sustained efforts to identify and protect a large number of child victims, relying on support from NGOs and international organizations; nationwide awareness-raising activities were sustained, but little was done to stop forced begging (2015)\n\nFlag of Burkina Faso\n\nFlag of Burkina Faso\n\nFlag of Burkina Faso"
