There are more than two million people who have been internally displaced by the continuing violence. The United Nations estimates that this year 6.3 million of the country’s approximately 23 million people will be dependent on emergency humanitarian aid.",

        "text": "Germany is one of Burkina Faso’s top five bilateral donors, having been actively engaged in projects in the country since the 1960s, and is valued as a reliable, trusted partner. Cooperation activities are currently being carried out at the community level and because of the political situation the focus is on assisting people as directly as possible.\n\nThe last government negotiations between the two countries took place in September 2020; at that time Germany committed funds amounting to 71.45 million euros. Of that amount, 21.7 million euros was earmarked for projects under the Special Initiative “Transformation of Agricultural and Food Systems”. In 2022 and 2023, a total of 43.2 million euros for Technical Cooperation and Financial Cooperation was committed in writing. In 2024 as well, only government consultations are envisaged and commitments will be made afterwards in writing.\n\nDevelopment cooperation between Germany and Burkina Faso focuses on the following three core areas:\n\nTransformation of agricultural and food systems\n\nAreas of intervention: agriculture, rural development\n\nPeaceful and inclusive societies\n\nAreas of intervention: good governance, peacebuilding and conflict prevention\n\nConserving nature and natural resources, protecting life on Earth\n\nArea of intervention: water\n\nTransitional development assistance measures are embedded in the core areas. Together with the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), the BMZ developed the Sahel Resilience Initiative to bring about lasting improvements in the food and income situations of people in Burkina Faso, Niger, Mali, Mauritania and Chad. The assistance provided under the initiative includes support for restoring agricultural land and ensuring that schools are supplied with food."
