        "text": "You will observe the Burkinabé exchange greetings in what appears to be a shared prayer or ritual. Liter- ally, all they are saying is “good morning, how’s the family, how’s work, how’s your health…” Greeting is\n\na very important part of Burkinabé culture, and the only thing you really need to do here is to make an instant friend. Ignoring someone and not greeting him or her, however, is taken far more seriously than in western cultures. It is virtually a slap in the face\n\nto ignore someone that has greeted you, or to not greet at all. Foreigners can probably get away with being “cold” and “unfriendly” in some settings, but it is a good idea to greet everyone you pass by"
