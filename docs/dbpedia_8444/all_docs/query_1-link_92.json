        "text": "Africa\n\nGlobally, some progress on women’s rights has been achieved. However, work still needs to be done in Burkina Faso to achieve gender equality. 51.6% of women aged 20–24 years old who were married or in a union before age 18. The adolescent birth rate is 132.3 per 1,000 women aged 15-19 as of 2016, up from 129 per 1,000 in 2014. As of February 2021, only 6.3% of seats in parliament were held by women. In 2018, 11.2% of women aged 15-49 years reported that they had been subject to physical and/or sexual violence by a current or former intimate partner in the previous 12 months. Moreover, women of reproductive age (15-49 years) often face barriers with respect to their sexual and reproductive health and rights: despite progress, in 2020, 52.6% of women had their need for family planning satisfied with modern methods.\n\nAs of december 2020, only 45.1% of indicators needed to monitor the SDGs from a gender perspective were available, with gaps in key areas, in particular: unpaid care and domestic work and information and communications technology skills. In addition, many areas – such as gender and poverty, physical and sexual harassment, women’s access to assets (including land), and gender and the environment – lack comparable methodologies for reguar monitoring. Closing these gender data gaps is essential for achieving gender-related SDG commitments in Burkina Faso."
