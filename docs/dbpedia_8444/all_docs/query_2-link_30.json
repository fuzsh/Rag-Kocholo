The country also hosts 38,000 refugees, mostly of Malian origin. The number of people in need of humanitarian assistance increased by 35% between 2022 to 2023, from 3.5 million to almost 4.7 million.\n\nUNHCR maintains a robust operational presence across the country, with seven offices and 160 staff members. In line with its mandate, UNHCR advocates for the inclusion of forcibly displaced and stateless persons in national systems and programmes, and collaborates with stakeholders such as the Government, UN agencies, development actors, NGOs, and civil society organizations, in line with its 2022-2025 Multi-Year Multi-Partner Strategy and localization agenda. UNHCR plays a key role in leading the Protection, Shelter and Core Relief Items and Management of Temporary Hosting Sites (Gestion de Sites d’Acceuil Temporaires – GSAT)/Camp Coordination and Camp Management clusters and co-chairs the Program Management Team of the UN Country Team."
