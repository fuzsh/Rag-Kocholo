        "meta_description": "Background The number of malaria cases worldwide has increased, with over 241 million cases and 69,000 more deaths in 2020 compared to 2019. Burkina Faso recorded over 11 million malaria cases in 2020, resulting in nearly 4,000 deaths. The overall incidence of malaria in Burkina Faso has been steadily increasing since 2016. This study investigates the spatiotemporal pattern and environmental and meteorological determinants of malaria incidence in Burkina Faso.   Methods We described the temporal dynamics of malaria cases by detecting the transmission periods and the evolution trend from 2013 to 2018. We detected hotspots using spatial scan statistics. We assessed different environmental zones through a hierarchical clustering and analyzed the environmental and climatic data to identify their association with malaria incidence at the national and at the district’s levels through generalized additive models. We also assessed the time lag between malaria peaks onset and the rainfall at the district level. The environmental and climatic data were synthetized into indicators.   Results The study found that malaria incidence had a seasonal pattern, with high transmission occurring during the rainy seasons. We also found an increasing trend in the incidence. The highest-risk districts for malaria incidence were identified, with a significant expansion of high-risk areas from less than half of the districts in 2013–2014 to nearly 90% of the districts in 2017–2018. We identified three classes of health districts based on environmental and climatic data, with the northern, south-western, and western districts forming separate clusters. Additionally, we found that the time lag between malaria peaks onset and the rainfall at the district level varied from 7 weeks to 17 weeks with a median at 10 weeks. Environmental and climatic factors have been found to be associated with the number of cases both at global and districts levels.   Conclusion The study provides important insights into the environmental and spatiotemporal patterns of malaria in Burkina Faso by assessing the spatio temporal dynamics of Malaria cases but also linking those dynamics to the environmental and climatic factors. The findings highlight the importance of targeted control strategies to reduce the burden of malaria in high-risk areas as we found that Malaria epidemiology is complex and linked to many factors that make some regions more at risk than others.",

        "text": "Study area and datasets\n\nBurkina Faso is a West African country surrounded by Mali (north and west), Niger (east), Benin, Togo, Ghana, and Côte d’Ivoire (south). In 2020 its population was estimated to be 20,903,278 [21]. The climate is Sahelian in the northern part and Sudanese in the rest of the country. The dry and cool season occurs from November to February, during which the Harmattan, a strong wind originating from the Sahara, blows, characterized by a great thermal amplitude between day and night. From March to May, heat and dry conditions prevail. The highest rainfall period occurs in July and August. The level of rainfall goes from more than 1,300 mm in the southwest, the most productive region of the country, to less than 254 mm in the north.\n\nThe health system in Burkina Faso has three administrative levels: central, intermediate, and peripheral. The central level is composed of the central structures organized around the Minister’s office and the General Secretariat. The intermediate level includes 13 regional health directorates, and the peripheral level is made up of 70 health districts. The health district is the spatial unit of the national health system. In 2018, the median number of inhabitants of health districts was 255,000 (interquartile range: 177,331) [22].\n\nIn Burkina Faso, a case of malaria is defined as a person with fever and a positive Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) or thick blood microscopy diagnostic, following the WHO definition [23]. The national epidemiological surveillance includes an epidemiologic information system for priority diseases, based on the DHIS2 system, including malaria case collection on a weekly basis. The malaria case data from 2013 to 2018 was collected from the national epidemiological surveillance system, which undergoes quality checks at multiple levels and includes cross-checking with patient registers, ensuring data completeness and timeliness, with no significant issues found in our own data quality assessment.\n\nThe authors did not have access to any information that could identify individual participants during or after the data collection process.\n\nMeteorological data were collected for each health district from remote sensing using satellites through Google earth engine [24] from January 2013 to December 2018.We collected daily precipitation data (Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station Data, spatial resolution: approximately 5.56 km), average daily temperature, maximum daily temperature, and minimum daily temperature data (Latest climate reanalysis produced by ECMWF / Copernicus Climate Change Service, spatial resolution: approximately 27.78 km), 8-day normalized difference vegetation index (MODIS Terra Surface Reflectance 8-Day Global, spatial resolution: approximately 0.5 km), daily surface atmospheric pressure data (Latest climate reanalysis produced by ECMWF / Copernicus Climate Change Service, spatial resolution: approximately 27.78 km), and 8-day fire detection data (Fire Information for Resource Management System, spatial resolution: approximately 1 km). We provide a table of all the variables and their sources in S1 Table. Shapefiles of Burkina Faso Health districts were extracted from the GADM (version 3.6, Davis, CA, USA) Center for Spatial Sciences at the University of California, Davis and Open Street Map websites [25].\n\nStatistical methods\n\nWe used the number of weekly malaria cases and assumed a constant population within each year to estimate the overall incidence time series (2013–2018), estimating trend and seasonality. We used an additive decomposition to highlight the seasonality, using the LOESS (locally estimated scatterplot smoothing) method. LOESS regression is a non-parametric approach that uses a locally weighted regression to fit a smooth curve across the points of a scatterplot [26].\n\nWe also determined the different transmission periods through a change point analysis [27] of the mean using the Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT) algorithm and the Modified Bayes Information Criterion (MBIC) [28–30]. The change point analysis is a method applied on a series of time-ordered data to detect whether changes have occurred, determining the number of changes and estimating dates of changes [31, 32].\n\nWe also observed the density in the incidence through the epidemic years using ridgelines [33]. Ridgelines are a type of data visualization that displays multiple overlapping probability density functions or distributions. They are used to visualize the distribution of a continuous variable across different categories or groups.\n\nAn epidemic malaria year can be defined as the 12-month period commencing with the initial rise in the incidence of cases, corresponding to the onset of the primary peak, and extending through the subsequent year. The evolution of incidence across the country through epidemic years was assessed through choropleths incidence maps at the health district level. This could possibly allow observations of trends in spatial variations over epidemics years.\n\nWe investigated high-risk districts for each epidemic year and each transmission period to document the spatial pattern of the riskiest districts. We used a Poisson model purely spatial Kulldorf scan statistic [34] implemented in rsatscan [35]. Kulldorf scan statistics were used to identify hotspots and cold spots in a territory. This approach groups different spatial units adjacent to the study area into potential clusters. It was based on an elliptical window of different size, called a scan window, moving over the study area. They determine the randomness of the distribution of a phenomenon in space [34]. This randomness is used as a statistic test whose objective is to test the presence of a cluster within a region R with the following hypotheses:\n\nH0 = Random distribution of events in R\n\nH1 = Existence of a cluster ʗ of events, included in R, in which the probability of occurrence of an event is greater than that in the rest of R.\n\nIn our study a district was defined as a hotspot if it belongs to one of the significant clusters detected by the Kulldorf scan statistics. We used an elliptical window, a maximum cluster size set at 30% of the population at risk and the scan statistic was tested with 9999 replications of a Monte Carlo algorithm.\n\nAs malaria distribution has been shown to depend on environmental and meteorological factors that can favor vectors development and host-vector interactions [36, 37], we then produced choropleths maps for the main meteorological and environmental data retrieved for the entire period to characterize the districts environment. For the need to have a more detailed characterization of the districts environmental profile, we implemented a principal component analysis (PCA) [38, 39] on all the environmental and meteorological data from the 70 districts for the entire study period to create Synthetic Environmental National Indicators (SENIs). The PCA step can be considered as a denoising step which can lead to a more stable clustering. We then made a hierarchical ascendant cluster analysis to create environmental profiles for the districts [40, 41]. We performed the hierarchical clustering using the Ward’s criterion [42, 43] (based on the multidimensional variance).\n\nThe association between malaria and meteorological factors is complex due to the non-linear pattern of meteorological factors with the incidence., We fitted a multivariate generalized additive model (GAM) with a negative binomial distribution and a smoothing spline function on the SMIs values to model the malaria cases as a function of the SENIs [44]. A generalized additive model (GAM) is a generalized linear model with a linear predictor involving a sum of smooth functions of covariates. The GAM can be used with nonparametric smoothing terms instead of constant parameters [44–46], with the following the structure: (1) where μi = E(Yi) and Yi ~ exponential family distribution.\n\nYi is a response variable, Xi is a row of the model matrix for any strictly parametric model components, θ is the corresponding parameter vector, and the fj are smooth functions of the covariates, Xk\n\nFor estimation, the fi, are decomposed on a spline basis. We note bjk the kth function of the chosen spline basis. The smooth functions fj can be written as follows: (2) where βjk is unknown.\n\nThis allowed us to assess the non-linear relations between the SMIs and malaria cases. A first-order autoregressive correlation [47, 48] was integrated into the variance-covariance matrix to account for temporal autocorrelation of malaria cases. We used a spline smoothing function on each SENI, ƒj(SENIj) to estimate the variation of each indicators effect on the malaria cases.\n\nBurkina Faso having different environmental profiles (refer to clustering on environmental factors), we also estimated for each district the lag of time between malaria cases and rainfall for the entire study period. We chose rainfall because it appears to be one of the major meteorological factor affecting malaria incidence [19, 49, 50].\n\nWe used a univariate generalized additive model (GAM) with a negative binomial distribution and a smoothing spline function on the rainfall values to model the malaria cases as a function of rainfall for time lags ranging from 1 to 20 weeks. The model minimizing the generalized cross-validation (GCV) was the model highlighting the lag [46, 51, 52]. Generalized Cross-Validation (GCV) is a statistical method used for model selection and parameter estimation in various regression or smoothing techniques [51]. It is commonly used in generalized additive models (GAMs) to determine the optimal amount of smoothing or regularization to apply to the model. In GAMs, smoothing is used to capture non-linear relationships between variables and the response variable. GCV is a technique that helps determine the appropriate level of smoothing by balancing the model’s fit to the data and its complexity. The goal is to find the smoothing parameter that provides the best compromise between overfitting (capturing noise or irrelevant patterns in the data) and underfitting (oversimplifying the relationships and missing important patterns)\n\nAt this health district level, after performing another PCA this time using all the environmental, meteorological, and geographic data, building, for each of the 70 districts, Synthetic Environmental District Indicators (SEDIs) and discriminated for each epidemic year for the entire study period, we fitted a multivariate generalized additive mixed model to assess the relation between association between malaria and SEDI by district. To account for time process, a first-order autoregressive process was integrated into the variance-covariance matrix of the GAMM model. The logarithm transformation of the population for each district and for each epidemic year was used as the offset in order to compute the standardized incidence ratio.\n\nOur analysis incorporated spatially resolved environmental variables, such as rainfall, temperature, and vegetation index, which indirectly accounted for spatial autocorrelation in our study. By including these variables in the multivariate generalized additive models (GAMs), we captured the spatial patterns and variations in factors influencing malaria transmission. These variables provided valuable information on the spatial variability of environmental conditions, which are known to influence mosquito populations and malaria transmission dynamics. Consequently, the models effectively captured the spatially dependent relationships between environmental variables and malaria incidence. While explicit modeling of spatial autocorrelation through the inclusion of health district as a random effect could have provided additional insights, our approach accounted for spatial effects by including these environmental variables. This indirect consideration of spatial autocorrelation aligns with the available data and the objectives of our study, providing valuable insights into the spatial dynamics of malaria transmission in Burkina Faso.\n\nIn the final model, we used a spline smoothing function on each SMI, ƒj(SMIj) to estimate the nonlinear relationship between each indicator and malaria cases.\n\nWhile we utilized a robust dataset for our study, it is important to acknowledge potential limitations related to the data. The primary sources of these data are passive surveillance systems, which are inherently subject to certain biases. Cases of malaria may be underreported due to asymptomatic infections or less severe cases that do not seek medical attention. Moreover, misdiagnosis and uneven access to healthcare facilities across the country could also contribute to inaccuracies. While efforts are ongoing to enhance malaria surveillance in Burkina Faso, these challenges remain. Nonetheless, given the consistency in data collection and processing with quality checks in place, we believe the dataset provides a reasonably accurate picture of the spatiotemporal distribution of malaria across the country, despite these potential biases."
