        "text": "Together, we are taking on these challenges. We are reaching the poorest and most marginalised people. We are working with the Government and service providers to make sure they are effective and ordinary people can hold them to account. And we are building good hygiene into every water and sanitation project so that people get the full benefits.\n\nIn a world with so many competing priorities, we remain resolutely focused on tackling fundamental issues like these, because they transform people’s lives for good.\n\nFor the last two months of the dry season in Boulgou Province, southeastern Burkina Faso, people struggle to find enough water to drink, cook, keep clean and ensure their animals survive. Many rivers dry up, meaning that the only water source is the local pump.\n\nIf too many people rely on one pump, the underground water level can drop, meaning the pump has to work harder and breaks more often. The water may even run out. We launched a pilot project to tackle this.\n\nAs part of the project, Lucien Damiba, WaterAid Burkina Faso's Regional Learning Centre Coordinator, helps communities understand how to monitor local water levels and conserve supplies, to ensure they have enough all year.\n\n“We also train community volunteers to monitor how much water is in their area, from measuring rainfall, to tracking the level of water in wells and boreholes.”\n\nHelping communities become water experts has been successful in Boulgou – so much so that Lucien thinks this approach could have far-reaching, even global effects. \"It has the potential to change the future for drought-prone communities in Africa and around the world.\"\n\nLearn more about this exciting project >"
