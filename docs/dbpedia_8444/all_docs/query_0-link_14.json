        "text": "In a nutshell\n\nSeasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) involves giving children monthly courses of antimalarial medicines during the high malaria season (in places where malaria is seasonal). We estimate that it costs approximately $2,000 to $7,000 (depending on the location) to avert a death in areas where GiveWell supports SMC. We think SMC is cost-effective because we think:\n\nSMC reaches a high proportion (around 80% or more) of targeted children (who would not otherwise receive SMC).\n\nThere is strong evidence that SMC reduces malaria.\n\nSMC probably provides substantial additional benefits like increased later-life income.\n\nOverall, we are confident that the case for SMC is strong, and we have relatively few significant reservations (even compared to GiveWell’s other top charities). But we are still uncertain about factors including:\n\nwhether SMC campaigns would be funded by other malaria funders in GiveWell’s absence (which could mean our funding is not increasing the overall number of children reached with SMC as much as we think)\n\nan observational study of large-scale SMC programs finding smaller effects than randomized controlled trials\n\nthe impact of drug resistance on SMC, and how far the scale-up of SMC will increase drug resistance in the future\n\nGiveWell’s current top recommended organization for SMC is Malaria Consortium. Our page for Malaria Consortium’s SMC program is available here, and our cost-effectiveness analysis is here.\n\nPublished: January 2024; Last updated: April 2024 (October 2018 version, November 2017 version)\n\nSummary\n\nBasics\n\nSeasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) involves giving children monthly courses of antimalarial medicines, usually for four or five months per year, in locations where malaria is highly seasonal (i.e., a high proportion of cases occur in a relatively short period each year).\n\nGiveWell funding to Malaria Consortium supports SMC campaigns. Malaria Consortium uses the funding to (among other things) buy the medicines used in SMC, train community distributors to deliver the medicines door-to-door, and conduct monitoring to understand what proportion of children are reached. (More)\n\nHow cost-effective is it?\n\nAs of December 2023, we estimate that it costs approximately $2,000 to $7,000 (varying by location) to avert a death through SMC in areas where GiveWell supports SMC programs. This equates to being 10 to 28 times as effective as spending on unconditional cash transfers (GiveWell’s benchmark for comparing different programs).\n\nWe think that SMC is cost-effective because:\n\nMalaria is a major cause of child mortality in areas where GiveWell funds SMC. We estimate that the chance that a 3-59 month old child (the main target group for SMC) will die as a result of malaria is around 0.3% to 0.7% per year, depending on the location. We rely primarily on malaria-specific mortality estimates from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Model, which we think are broadly in line with World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, another widely used source. (More) We then adjust these estimates upward because we think malaria indirectly causes 0.75 deaths from other causes for every direct malaria death. This is based on evidence that malaria control programs often have larger impacts on mortality than would be expected from their impact on malaria alone. (More)\n\nSMC is effective at preventing malaria. We estimate that receiving SMC reduces malaria mortality by 79% during the period when it is delivered. This is based on a meta-analysis finding that SMC reduces malaria cases by 75%, to which we apply some small adjustments (more). We also assume that reduced malaria cases translate 1:1 into reduced malaria deaths (more). Our impression is that SMC is widely viewed in the global health community as an effective program, strengthening our confidence in these estimates. (More)\n\nSMC is a highly targeted program. It is delivered to a group at high risk of malaria (young children) in the high transmission season where most malaria occurs. We currently estimate that 70% of malaria occurs in this period in most countries in our analysis (more). We think this targeted program design contributes to its cost-effectiveness.\n\nIt is relatively cheap to reach children with SMC. We estimate that it costs Malaria Consortium approximately $5 to $6 per year (depending on the location) to reach a child with all their recommended cycles of SMC. This is roughly in line with the cost of other mass campaign programs we have seen (e.g., insecticide-treated net campaigns). Intuitively, reasons for SMC being relatively cheap include the drugs used being affordable and Malaria Consortium’s door-to-door campaign approach reaching a high proportion of targeted children. (More)\n\nSMC probably provides significant benefits beyond averting child mortality. In particular, we think that by averting malaria during a sensitive period of childhood development, it could improve children’s income in later life. This is based on two studies that find historical malaria eradication campaigns led to long-term increases in income. We use a combined estimate from these studies and discount this by 70% to reflect our uncertainty about the quality of this evidence. Even with this discount, we estimate that approximately 15% to 35% of the total modeled benefits of SMC come from increased income rather than averted deaths. (More)\n\nGiveWell funding increases the proportion of people protected by SMC. Without campaigns like the ones GiveWell funds, we estimate that virtually no children would get SMC from other sources. This is because campaigns are the only form of SMC delivery we have heard about, and our understanding is that WHO recommends that national governments prohibit the private sale of the SMC drugs in areas implementing SMC (more). We think it’s more likely that another funder would replace GiveWell’s funding for SMC campaigns in our absence (we roughly estimate a 10% to 65% likelihood depending on the location), since we think SMC is a high priority for funders and national malaria programs. Our adjustment for “diverting other actors’ spending away from SMC” lowers cost-effectiveness by 7% to 51%, depending on the location. But we think SMC remains cost-effective even after attempting to account for this possibility. (More)\n\nWe quantify this using a cost-effectiveness analysis, which allows us to compare across different programs. Here is a sketch, using estimates for Burkina Faso as an example.\n\nWhat we are estimating Best guess (rounded) Confidence intervals\n\n(25th - 75th percentile) Implied cost-effectiveness Donation to Malaria Consortium (arbitrary value) $1,000,000 Cost per child reached with SMC (more) $5.69 $5.30 - $6.50 19x - 16x Number of children receiving SMC (more) 176,000 Percent of children who would have received SMC without mass distribution (more) 0% Annual mortality rate from malaria and associated causes among children who do not receive SMC (more) 0.67% 0.31% - 0.95% 8x - 25x Proportion of malaria mortality occurring in SMC season (more) 70% 62% - 79% 16x - 20x Reduction in malaria mortality from receiving SMC (more) 79% 67% - 85% 15x - 19x Initial cost-effectiveness estimate Cost per death averted (child mortality only) ~$1,500 Moral weight for each death averted 116 Initial cost-effectiveness estimate 23x Summary of primary benefits (% of modeled benefits) Reduced child mortality 80% Reduced mortality among older children and adults (more) 4% 2% - 8% 17x - 19x Income increases in later life (more) 16% 9% - 22% 17x - 19x Additional adjustments Adjustment for additional program benefits and downsides (more) 19% 5% - 34% 16x - 20x Adjustment for grantee-level factors (more) -8% -17% - -4% 16x - 19x Adjustment for diverting other actors’ spending into SMC (“leverage”) (more) -0.3% Adjustment for diverting other actors’ spending away from SMC (“funging”) (more) -43% -64% - -23% 11x - 24x Overall cost-effectiveness (multiples of cash transfers) 18x\n\nWe’ve also considered other perspectives that might not be captured explicitly in these cost-effectiveness estimates (e.g., whether experts see SMC as a good investment). Overall, we don’t think any of these alternative perspectives undermine the case for SMC. Factors we’ve considered:\n\nSMC seems to have widespread support from the global malaria community.\n\nSMC appears to have relatively few unintended negative consequences.\n\nThere is evidence that SMC and the RTS,S vaccine delivered together are more effective than either intervention alone. We see this as important because we expect the vaccine rollout to play a major role in the malaria landscape in the future.\n\nHowever, we have spent considerably less time on these questions than we have on our main cost-effectiveness model. We hope to engage more with these questions in the future. (More)\n\nHow could we be wrong?\n\nOverall, we are confident that the case for SMC is strong, and we have relatively few significant reservations (even compared to GiveWell’s other top charities). But we are still uncertain about questions including:\n\nAre we crowding out other funders? We think there is a high chance (10% to 65% depending on the location) that SMC campaigns would be funded by other malaria funders in GiveWell’s absence. If this were the case, it would imply that our funding for SMC is less impactful than we think because it is not leading to an increase in the overall number of children treated with SMC. We attempt to adjust for this based on our analysis of malaria funding trends and conversations with national malaria programs and other funders, but our guesses about this are necessarily speculative. We are also uncertain about whether our funding will create a future expectation of continued SMC funding and reduce other funders’ future spending on SMC.\n\nOur current adjustment for diverting other actors’ funding away from SMC, which attempts to account for this factor, decreases cost-effectiveness by about 43% in Burkina Faso, and our 25th-75th percentile confidence interval is -64% to -23%. This implies that SMC is 11x to 24 times as cost-effective as direct cash transfers (“11x-24x”). (More) We hope to improve our estimates on this question in the future by investigating whether funding gaps that we didn’t fill were covered by other funders, but we haven’t conducted this analysis systematically yet. (More)\n\nIs there evidence that large-scale SMC programs lead to reductions in malaria? Although we generally rely on randomized controlled trials (RCTs), we are more confident if evidence from real-world programs shows an impact similar to that of studies conducted in experimental conditions. We have seen one large study of SMC in a real-world context that finds significantly smaller impacts (reductions in malaria cases of about 25% to 55%) than our analysis would suggest. Although we still see the experimental results as a more reliable guide to the impact of SMC, we see this as a negative update. We’re not sure what’s driving this difference, and we plan to investigate this in more detail in the future. (More)\n\nHow much of a threat is drug resistance? It is likely that widespread delivery of SMC will lead to increased resistance to the antimalarial drugs used in SMC. We include a -4% adjustment to account for this, but we have not reviewed data on this question since 2020, and it is possible we are underestimating the growth of resistance over time. This adjustment also only accounts for current drug resistance to SMC, and not for further development of resistance in the future. We are planning to spend more time analyzing resistance data and planning how to account for this in the future. (More)\n\nWill SMC remain impactful in the future? We’re unsure how changes in the malaria landscape will affect SMC. One trend we plan to monitor is the rollout of the malaria vaccine. This could lead us to estimate that SMC is either more cost-effective (because there is an opportunity to layer both interventions) or less cost-effective (because overall malaria burden could be lower). We’re planning to investigate this question in more detail in the future. (More)\n\nHow reliable are the malaria mortality estimates we rely on? Record keeping on the causes of mortality in malaria-endemic countries is not reliable. Our analysis relies on malaria mortality estimates from the Global Burden of Disease Project, and we’re unsure how accurate they are (more). We also adjust these estimates by assuming that malaria contributes to 0.75 deaths from other causes for each death attributed directly to malaria. This is a highly uncertain best guess (more). Our 25th-75th percentile confidence interval for mortality caused by malaria in Burkina Faso is 0.31% to 0.95%, which implies a cost-effectiveness of 8x to 25x.\n\nWould other ways of supporting SMC be more effective? To date, GiveWell has only supported SMC through direct funding for mass campaigns. It might be that we’re missing other ways of funding SMC that would be more effective (e.g., an advocacy campaign to encourage other funders to prioritize SMC). As of December 2023, we have only just begun thinking about this question, and we’re not sure whether or how it will affect our grant-making. (More)\n\nHow accurate was our analysis of SMC in hindsight? GiveWell’s cost-effectiveness analyses are “forward-looking” and aim to predict the impact a program will have at the time we make a grant decision. We have paid less attention to backwards checks to understand how accurate the predictions in our SMC grants were. This is a weakness in our approach and something we aim to improve in the future. (More)\n\nCost-effectiveness analysis accompanying this report: Link\n\nNote: The figures in this report are from our December 2023 cost-effectiveness analysis. Our estimates change over time as we gather new information and update our analysis, and so the numbers in this report may not exactly match those in our most recent cost-effectiveness analysis (available here).\n\nGiveWell’s current top recommended organization for SMC is Malaria Consortium. Our page on Malaria Consortium’s SMC program is available here.\n\n1. The basics of the program\n\n1.1 What is malaria and what are its impacts?\n\nMalaria is a disease caused by Plasmodium parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected mosquitoes. Symptomatic cases involve flu-like symptoms including fever, which can progress to severe illness or death. Some groups are at particularly high risk of severe symptoms including infants, children under five years of age, pregnant women, travelers, and people with HIV or AIDS.\n\nGlobally, malaria deaths fell from an estimated 897,000 in 2000 to 619,000 in 2021. There were an estimated 249 million malaria cases in 2022. The World Health Organization (WHO) African Region carries a disproportionately high share of the malaria burden. In 2022, the region accounted for approximately 94% of all malaria cases and 95% of deaths.\n\n1.2 What is seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC)?\n\nSeasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) involves giving children monthly courses of antimalarial medicines in locations where malaria is highly seasonal (i.e., a high proportion of cases occur during a relatively short period each year). SMC is delivered to all children in a given location (exceptions in footnote). The antimalarial medicines used are sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine (SP) and amodiaquine (AQ). SMC has scaled up rapidly in recent years. An estimated 2.6 million children were reached with SMC in 2014, rising to approximately 49 million in 2022.\n\nWHO has recommended SMC for deployment since 2012. The original WHO recommendation was for up to four monthly cycles of medicine for children aged 3–59 months in areas where more than 60% of the annual incidence of malaria occurs within four months and where resistance to the medicines used in SMC was low.\n\nIn recent years, some countries began to expand their use of SMC beyond the original WHO recommendation. These changes included delivering five cycles rather than four in some locations in Nigeria and Burkina Faso beginning in 2021 and pilots of SMC in Mozambique and Uganda in 2020-2021. In 2022, WHO updated its policy recommendation for SMC in line with these developments. The key changes included:\n\ndropping the requirement that SMC be delivered only in places where resistance is low\n\nallowing for variability in the number of cycles delivered\n\nmore flexibility on the age range for targeted children (although in most countries, WHO states that children under five will still be the highest priority)\n\nAs a result, SMC—which has historically only been delivered at large scale in countries in the Sahel region of West Africa, where drug resistance is low—is expanding in other areas with highly seasonal malaria transmission. Countries may also decide to deliver greater or fewer cycles of SMC, in line with the length of their peak malaria transmission seasons.\n\nGiveWell has funded a number of pilots and research projects to test the feasibility, acceptability, and impact of SMC outside the Sahel. At the time of writing (December 2023) we have not fully completed or published our analysis of SMC outside the Sahel. Our analysis in this report therefore focuses on analyzing the impact of SMC in the Sahel.\n\n1.3 How do SMC campaigns work?\n\nThe organization GiveWell has funded to date for SMC is Malaria Consortium. Key features of Malaria Consortium’s SMC program include:\n\nSMC is primarily delivered door-to-door by trained health workers (\"community distributors\") to eligible children.\n\nThe antimalarial medicines are administered over three days. The community distributor administers the first day’s doses of SMC (one tablet of SP and one tablet of AQ) and gives the remaining doses (two tablets of AQ) to caregivers to administer over the next two days.\n\nSMC campaigns are implemented under the leadership of each country’s national malaria program. Malaria Consortium collaborates with national malaria programs and other partners to support these campaigns. Its role includes providing the funding for the campaigns, procuring the antimalarial medications, training community distributors, and monitoring and evaluation.\n\nOur review of Malaria Consortium’s SMC program has more information.\n\n2. How GiveWell estimates cost-effectiveness\n\nGiveWell recommends programs that we believe save or improve lives as much as possible for as little money as possible. To estimate this, we produce a cost-effectiveness analysis (“CEA”) which aims to produce a best guess of the overall impact of a program per dollar donated.\n\nWe use moral weights to quantify the benefits of different impacts (e.g., increased income or reduced deaths). We benchmark to a value of 1, which we define as the value of doubling someone’s consumption for one year. The main moral weights we use for our analysis of SMC are in the table below.\n\nMoral weight\n\n(units of value\n\nper outcome) Doubling consumption for one person for one year 1 Value of increased income through averting a case of malaria in a person under age 15 with SMC 0.23 Averting the death of a child under five from malaria 116 Averting the death of someone aged over five from malaria 73\n\nFor more about how GiveWell thinks about cost-effectiveness, see our discussion on this page.\n\nAs of December 2023, our SMC cost-effectiveness analysis contains 18 locations in seven countries. In this report, our analysis focuses on Malaria Consortium’s SMC program in Burkina Faso, Togo, and various states in Nigeria only. We largely exclude the other locations from our discussion (details in footnote).\n\nThis report and accompanying cost-effectiveness analysis include 25th-75th percentile confidence intervals for specific parameters. See the summary table above and this sheet of our cost-effectiveness analysis. These intervals are based on GiveWell staff members’ subjective levels of uncertainty for each parameter (see footnote for more details on our method).\n\n3. How many people does SMC reach?\n\n3.1 Summary\n\nThe starting point for our analysis is an estimate of the number of children protected with SMC per $1 million spent. As of December 2023, we estimate that $1 million protects approximately 160,000 to 200,000 children per year with SMC (varying by location). A summary of our calculations is below, using one country (Burkina Faso) as an example:\n\nWhat we are estimating Value (rounded) Total number of SMC cycles delivered in Malaria Consortium-supported campaigns in Burkina Faso, 2018-2021, adjusted for non-adherence (more) ~21 million SMC spending by Malaria Consortium in Burkina Faso, 2018-2021 (more) ~$27.5 million Costs incurred by other NGOs on Malaria Consortium-supported SMC campaigns in Burkina Faso, 2018-2021 (more) $250,000 Subtotal: Average cost per SMC cycle delivered, excluding in-kind government costs $1.32 Donation to Malaria Consortium (arbitrary value) $1,000,000 Average number of cycles delivered per year in Burkina Faso (varies by district) (more) 4.3 Subtotal: Cost per year of SMC delivered $5.69 Total (children treated per year with SMC) ~176,000\n\nThe main uncertainties in our estimates are (more below):\n\nOur analysis relies on target population estimates (the number of 3-59 month old children in each location). We think these are drawn from administrative data, and we’re unsure how reliable they are.\n\nWe include other philanthropic actors’ financial contributions in our analysis, but until recently we did not have any information on these actors’ costs in Togo. We therefore use a weighted average of other countries’ cost figures in Togo, which we would expect to be less accurate.\n\n3.2 Cost per cycle of SMC\n\nWe calculate the cost per cycle of SMC delivered in each country based on three main estimates:\n\nthe number of SMC cycles delivered by previous Malaria Consortium-supported SMC programs\n\ncosts incurred by Malaria Consortium\n\ncosts incurred by other actors\n\nWe divide total costs by total cycles delivered to obtain the estimated cost per cycle in each country. This spreadsheet contains our full calculations.\n\nNumber of cycles delivered\n\nWe estimate the number of cycles delivered in SMC campaigns between 2018 and 2021 in this sheet using the following sources of data:\n\nTarget populations (i.e., the number of children aged 3 to 59 months) in districts with Malaria Consortium-supported campaigns. These figures are provided by Malaria Consortium, and our understanding is that they are based on administrative data from national governments. A key uncertainty in our analysis (discussed below) is that these may be based on outdated census data, updated with estimates of population growth.\n\nSMC coverage (i.e., the proportion of targeted children who receive SMC). Malaria Consortium conducts surveys after campaigns to understand what proportion of children in the target population received SMC. These surveys are discussed in detail in our separate review of Malaria Consortium. In summary:\n\nMalaria Consortium conducts separate surveys after each cycle of SMC (i.e., every month during the SMC season) and each SMC round (i.e., after the SMC season is complete, four or five months depending on the country). We use coverage estimates from the post-round surveys, which we think are likely to be more accurate (details in footnote).\n\nIn the most recent program years, post-round surveys measured average coverage across cycles at 92% in Burkina Faso (2018-2020), 85% in Chad (2018-2021), 78% in Nigeria (2018-2021), and 87% in Togo (2020-2021).\n\nOverall, we think that these surveys are high-quality and provide evidence that a high proportion of target children were reached in Malaria Consortium campaigns. Our main reservations are that the surveys rely on caregiver self-reports about whether their children received SMC (which we would guess somewhat inflate the true proportion of children reached) and discrepancies between post-cycle and post-round surveys in some locations. We account for the risk of bias these issues introduce with a rough -2% adjustment elsewhere in our analysis.\n\nFor each country, we multiply estimates of SMC coverage by the target population to estimate the total number of cycles delivered in each SMC campaign.\n\nFinally, we adjust our estimates of the number of cycles delivered to account for \"non-adherence.\" Community distributors give children the first day of medication for each SMC cycle directly, but caregivers give their children the remaining doses on days two and three. We would expect caregivers to somewhat over-report how frequently they adhere to this protocol because of social desirability bias (the tendency of survey participants to over-report \"good\" behaviors).\n\nAs of December 2023, we account for this with an adjustment of 93 to 94% (i.e., -7% to -6%), varying by country (details on our approach in footnote).\n\nMalaria Consortium’s costs\n\nOur estimates of Malaria Consortium’s cost per cycle are based on figures reported by Malaria Consortium to GiveWell on its spending on SMC campaigns between 2018 and 2021. Overall, these figures show that Malaria Consortium spent around $27.5m in Burkina Faso, $19.6m in Chad and $66.9m in Nigeria in these years.\n\nOther actors’ costs\n\nOther actors also contribute resources to the SMC campaigns that Malaria Consortium supports. The costs we include in our analysis are:\n\nSpending by other philanthropic actors on Malaria Consortium-supported campaigns. The campaigns that Malaria Consortium supports sometimes receive additional funding from other NGOs or multilateral organizations (e.g., UNICEF). We estimate that these costs are approximately $3m in Nigeria and $250,000 in Burkina Faso between 2018 and 2021 (details on our approach in footnote). In Togo, Malaria Consortium co-funds SMC in the districts it supports with UNICEF and the Global Fund, but we do not have information on these organizations’ costs. We therefore exclude Togo from our analysis and use an estimate that the cost per SMC cycle in Togo is the weighted average of all other countries' cost per cycle.\n\nIn-kind contributions from national governments. The campaigns that Malaria Consortium supports are ultimately managed by national governments’ ministries of health. We expect that Malaria Consortium’s funding diverts some ministry of health resources (e.g., staff time, office space, etc.) toward SMC campaigns that might otherwise have gone toward other activities. We estimate that these in-kind contributions account for 10-11% of total costs (varying by country). This figure is based on a costing study conducted as part of ACCESS-SMC, a program in which Malaria Consortium was one participant, in 2015 and 2016.\n\nWe use the cost per supplement excluding in-kind government contributions when estimating the number of children reached per $1m spent by Malaria Consortium (summarized in the table above). We consider these contributions (but not financial contributions from other philanthropic actors) that we include in our analysis to be “leveraged” (i.e., Malaria Consortium’s spending results in more of these resources being used for SMC and less for other activities that we think are less cost-effective). We account for this in our adjustment for other actors’ spending:\n\nWe exclude these costs from the cost side of the cost-effectiveness equation in the main part of our analysis.\n\nHowever, the benefit of these costs is already incorporated in our initial impact calculations. To account for them on the benefits side, we adjust the impact of the program downward to account for those funds not being spent on something else.\n\nWe think this approach is the best way to account for situations where GiveWell funding diverts other actors’ spending from a less cost-effective to a more cost-effective use. See this blog post for more.\n\nShortcomings and uncertainties\n\nOur biggest uncertainties (ways in which our estimates could be wrong and which could affect our bottom line the most) are:\n\nTarget population data. Our estimates of the number of children reached are based on data on the number of children aged 3 to 59 months in districts where Malaria Consortium works. These figures are based on administrative data from national governments, often old census data that has been adjusted to account for population growth. These may be inaccurate for various reasons (e.g., differential population growth at the local level, migration, or internal displacement).\n\nLack of information on other actors’ spending in Togo. We use a weighted average figure for other countries ($1.50) in place of a cost-per-cycle estimate in Togo. This is because Malaria Consortium co-funds its program in Togo with UNICEF and the Global Fund, but until recently we did not have information on these other actors’ costs. We would therefore expect our estimate in Togo to be less accurate than in other locations.\n\nNot accounting for older children being reached. Our current estimates assume that Malaria Consortium only delivers SMC to children under age five. In fact, Malaria Consortium’s surveys find that some older children are reached too (e.g., because a caregiver misreports a child’s age or distributors aren’t strict in enforcing age cut-offs). By not accounting for these children, we may be underestimating the number of children reached and the benefits of SMC. We have conducted some initial analysis suggesting that accounting for this could increase cost-effectiveness by roughly 5% to 10%, but this is a rough estimate and we have not yet fully vetted or published this work.\n\nLack of cross checks. We have not systematically cross referenced our estimates against independent data sources (e.g., costing studies conducted by independent research groups). We have conducted a rough internal analysis of nine SMC costing study estimates, indicating our estimates were slightly lower than but in roughly the same range as other published data (details in footnote). However, we have not investigated this in detail (e.g., to check whether the programs evaluated were similar to Malaria Consortium’s SMC program or to evaluate the costing methodology used), or published our analysis. We may do more work on this in the future.\n\nNot adjusting for survey biases. Our estimates of the number of SMC cycles delivered rely on coverage surveys that do not account for survey biases. We have conducted some rough internal analysis suggesting that we may be modestly overestimating coverage by not accounting for social desirability bias (survey participants tending to overreport “good” behaviors), but we have not yet deeply investigated this question or published this work. We plan to consider this in more detail in the future.\n\n3.3 The number of cycles delivered per year\n\nWHO recommends that SMC campaigns should deliver between three and five cycles of SMC per year at 28-day intervals, with the number of cycles depending on the local context (e.g., the length of the high-transmission season). The campaigns that Malaria Consortium supports deliver either four or five cycles, depending on the location. In Burkina Faso, where some districts receive four cycles of SMC and some receive five, we use an average figure of 4.3. This is because Malaria Consortium estimates that 70% of the target population lives in locations that receive four cycles and 30% lives in locations that receive five cycles.\n\nWe multiply the number of cycles per SMC campaign by the cost per cycle (excluding in-kind government costs) to estimate the overall cost per child per year (approximately $5 to around $6.30, varying by location).\n\n4. What impact does SMC have?\n\n4.1 Summary\n\nOur cost-effectiveness analysis models three main benefits from SMC:\n\nReduced mortality for children under age five (more).\n\nReduced mortality for older children and adults, from reduced malaria transmission in the community (more).\n\nIncreased long-run income, from improved health in a sensitive developmental window of childhood (more).\n\nA summary of the contributions of each type of benefit to our estimate of the modeled value of the program is below, using Burkina Faso as an example.\n\nWhat we are estimating % modeled benefits Reduced mortality for children under five 80% Reduced mortality for older children and adults (age five+) 4% Long-term income increases 16%\n\nWe also include a number of supplemental adjustments to account for additional benefits and offsetting impacts. Rather than explicitly modeling these, we have applied percentage adjustments based on our best guesses.\n\nWe divide these into intervention-level factors (e.g., costs averted from treatment of illness), which increase our cost-effectiveness estimate by 19% to 34% overall (19% in Burkina Faso) (more), and grantee-level factors (relating to the implementation of the program), which reduce our estimate by 8% (more).\n\nWe also include an adjustment to incorporate the impact of Malaria Consortium’s funding on other actors’ spending. This reduces our estimate by 8% to 51% (43% in Burkina Faso) (more).\n\nAfter factoring in all these impacts, we estimate that it costs approximately $2,000 to $7,000 (varying by location) to avert a death through SMC. This equates to being approximately 10 - 28x as effective as spending on unconditional cash transfers.\n\n4.2 Reduced mortality for young children\n\nWhat is the impact of SMC on malaria?\n\nSummary\n\nWe estimate that SMC reduces malaria cases among children receiving SMC by 79% during the SMC season. We also estimate a 1:1 ratio between reduced malaria cases and reduced malaria deaths, implying that SMC reduces malaria deaths among children receiving SMC by 79% in the SMC season. A summary of our calculations is below:\n\nWhat we are estimating Value The impact of being targeted for SMC, adapted from a published meta-analysis (more) 75% Adjustment for internal validity (study quality) (more) -5% Proportion of children who received SMC in studies in the meta-analysis (used to convert to the impact of receiving SMC) (more) 90% Ratio of reduced malaria cases to reduced malaria deaths (more) 100% Total (reduction in malaria deaths among children receiving SMC) 79%\n\nThe impact of being targeted for SMC\n\nTo estimate the impact of SMC, we rely on a systematic review and Cochrane meta-analysis , Meremikwu et al. 2012. This paper summarizes seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of SMC (then known as IPTc, intermittent preventive treatment for malaria in children).\n\nThe review’s main finding is that being targeted for SMC reduces malaria cases (clinical episodes) by approximately three-quarters (74%). We incorporate this figure into our cost-effectiveness analysis after applying several small adjustments.\n\nOverview of the Cochrane meta-analysis\n\nMeremikwu et al. 2012 summarizes seven RCTs involving 12,589 participants.\n\nThe review’s main finding is that SMC reduces malaria cases by 74% (rate ratio 0.26, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.38, data from six studies). Secondary analyses included:\n\nSevere malaria: SMC reduced severe malaria cases by 73% (rate ratio 0.27, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.76, two studies).\n\nCo-delivery with insecticide-treated nets: Two studies distributed nets to both intervention and control groups. SMC retained high efficacy in these studies against malaria cases (rate ratio 0.22, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.38).\n\nAll-cause mortality: There was no statistically significant impact of SMC on all-cause mortality (risk ratio 0.66, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.39), but the total number of deaths across all studies was very low and the studies were underpowered to detect an impact on all-cause mortality. The review concludes that SMC “probably produces a small reduction in all-cause mortality consistent with the effect on severe malaria.”\n\nThe review authors assessed each study for its risk of bias and determined that the evidence for malaria cases, severe malaria, and co-delivery with insecticide-treated nets was high quality. The evidence for all-cause mortality was assessed as moderate quality. We have not independently assessed these studies’ risk of bias.\n\nAdjustments to the meta-analysis\n\nWe conducted an updated version of the Cochrane meta-analysis of SMC on malaria cases:\n\nWe identified two additional RCTs (Tagbor et al. 2016, Matangila et al. 2015) published after the Cochrane review. Both found smaller effect sizes than the Cochrane meta-analysis. We added Tagbor et al. 2016 to our updated meta-analysis, but did not add Matangila et al. 2015 because courses were delivered at three-month (rather than one-month) intervals, and so are unlikely to have achieved similar reductions in malaria incidence to Malaria Consortium’s SMC program.\n\nOne of the RCTs (Dicko et al. 2008) included in the meta-analysis treated participants every eight weeks (rather than monthly, as in Malaria Consortium’s SMC program). We removed this study from our version of the meta-analysis.\n\nThis leaves six studies in the updated meta-analysis that measured the impact of SMC on malaria cases. After applying these updates, we estimate a very similar impact of SMC to the original Cochrane analysis (75% reduction; rate ratio 0.25; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.37).\n\nA World Health Organization report claims that SMC offers a high level of protection for about four weeks after the last course of medication, after which protection appears to decline. We have not independently vetted this claim. We note that some of the trials continued to collect malaria incidence up to six weeks after the last course was administered, which could underestimate the level of protection over a four-week period. In 2023, we received feedback from Professor Paul Milligan, Professor of Epidemiology and Medical Statistics at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, that using the main estimate from Meremikwu et al. 2012 to estimate the impact of SMC programs could mean we’re underestimating the impact of SMC on malaria (details in footnote). We have not yet deeply investigated this claim or understood how we could update our analysis to account for this.\n\nThe Cochrane review also notes there is substantial heterogeneity between the program results, meaning the variance between results of different trials is unlikely to have occurred by chance. The authors note there are insufficient trials to make meaningful conclusions about the causes of this heterogeneity. We reviewed two of the studies that find substantially lower reductions in malaria incidence (Dicko et al. 2008; Tagbor et al. 2016) and note possible causes in this footnote.\n\nComparing the meta-analysis studies to Malaria Consortium’s SMC program\n\nWe examined the six individual RCTs in our updated meta-analysis to understand whether there are any major additional differences between the programs they evaluated and Malaria Consortium’s SMC program. Our findings were:\n\nAll six delivered SMC cycles on a monthly basis, as in Malaria Consortium's program.\n\nFour of the six trials treated children with a combination of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) and amodiaquine (AQ), as in Malaria Consortium's program.\n\nAll six trials were conducted in West Africa, where most of Malaria Consortium’s programs operate.\n\nAll six trials only delivered SMC to children under 59 months of age, as in Malaria Consortium's program.\n\nThe number of courses ranged between three and five. Malaria Consortium’s program delivers four or five courses.\n\nCoverage of insecticide treated nets (ITNs) varied widely between <1% and 93%.\n\nWe conclude that the programs evaluated in these studies are reasonably similar to Malaria Consortium's SMC program, and therefore there is no need for an additional adjustment to account for differences between the programs. In our cost-effectiveness analysis, we therefore set our adjustment for external validity (the generalizability of the underlying studies to contemporary contexts) to 0% (i.e., no downward adjustment).\n\nAdjustment for internal validity (study quality)\n\nWe apply an adjustment of 95% (i.e., -5%) to the estimate from the meta-analysis to account for possible problems with the quality of the underlying studies (their \"internal validity\"). Our reasoning is:\n\nOur analysis suggests that the studies in the Cochrane review and our updated meta-analysis appear to be high-quality overall. Our best guess is therefore that the meta-analysis estimate is close to the true impact of SMC in the populations being studied.\n\nEven though we don't have specific, serious concerns about study quality, we use a default value below 100% based on our expectation that published studies are more likely to overstate an intervention's efficacy than understate it (e.g., because of publication bias).\n\nThe impact of receiving SMC\n\nWe estimate that the reduction in malaria cases among children who received SMC in the studies in the Cochrane meta-analysis was 79% :\n\nWe get to this figure by dividing the estimated effect of SMC on malaria cases (75%), adjusted for internal validity (95%), by an estimate of the proportion of children in the studies who received SMC (~90%); ((75% x 95%) / 90%) = ~79%).\n\nThe estimate of the proportion of children who received SMC is a weighted average of reported coverage rates from the six studies in our meta-analysis. See this spreadsheet for our calculations.\n\nOur uncertainties about this adjustment are:\n\nSpillover effects: We think that SMC provides indirect benefits to people who don’t receive SMC by reducing malaria transmission in the wider community (more below). Our current adjustment does not take these \"spillover effects\" into account. This could affect our analysis in two ways. Our best guess is that these factors lead us to underestimate the effect of SMC on mortality.\n\nSpillovers to the control group, which could lead us to underestimate the effect of SMC. All the studies we rely on in our meta-analysis randomized individuals to receive SMC, rather than whole communities. Our best guess is that some protection accrued to children in the control group who did not receive SMC (assuming they lived in the same communities as the children who did receive SMC). Our current analysis implicitly assumes that children in the control group got no benefit. This implies we could be underestimating the benefits of SMC on children who receive SMC.\n\nSpillovers to children who did not receive SMC in the treatment group, which could lead us to over- or underestimate the effect of SMC. Our conversion implicitly assumes that children in the treatment group who did not receive SMC received no benefit, and all the benefits of SMC were concentrated among the children who did receive SMC. In fact, children who didn’t receive SMC are likely to have gotten some benefit from reduced malaria transmission. We would expect this not to bias our results if coverage of SMC was similar between trial contexts and contemporary SMC programs (because the conversion doesn’t affect the overall benefit of SMC, just how it is allocated between children who do and don’t receive SMC). But the conversion could yield inaccurate estimates of the impact of SMC if coverage rates differed significantly between trial contexts and contemporary SMC campaigns (due to varying transmission patterns). We’re unsure whether this would positively or negatively update our analysis. Our concern about this is mitigated because we believe that coverage in contemporary SMC programs is relatively high (see our discussion above for more detail).\n\nCoverage measurement: We have not reviewed in detail how coverage was measured in these studies. We would guess that much of this data was based on self-reports from caregivers. This kind of data is at risk of being inflated by social desirability bias (the tendency for survey participants to overreport “good” behaviors). This implies we could be overestimating coverage (and therefore underestimating the impact of SMC on children who receive it).\n\nThe impact of SMC on malaria deaths\n\nThe trials included in the Cochrane review were underpowered to detect a significant effect on all-cause mortality. However, to convert our estimates of the impact of SMC on malaria cases into an estimate of their impact on mortality, we need to estimate the ratio between malaria case reductions and malaria mortality reductions.\n\nWe assume that the reduction in malaria mortality from SMC is proportional to the reduction in malaria incidence (e.g., if SMC reduces malaria cases by 79%, it also reduces malaria mortality by 79%). Our reasoning for this assumption is:\n\nWe would expect that a reduction in clinical malaria from SMC results in a similar reduction in malaria mortality, unless there was evidence that SMC was disproportionately likely to prevent non-severe cases of malaria.\n\nThe Cochrane review found that SMC prevents a similar proportion of severe malaria episodes (73%, rate ratio 0.27, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.76) and all clinical malaria episodes, though only two trials measured effects on severe malaria.\n\nThe Cochrane review found that all-cause mortality in the underlying studies was lower in the treatment groups than the control groups, although this difference did not reach statistical significance. The review authors conclude that “IPTc probably produces a small reduction in all-cause mortality consistent with the effect on severe malaria, but the trials were underpowered to reach statistical significance.” We have not yet tested the reduction in all-cause mortality implied by our primary analysis against this conclusion, but may do so in the future.\n\nWhat is the mortality rate among children who do not receive SMC?\n\nSummary\n\nWe estimate that there is around a 0.3%-0.7% risk (varying by location) that a child not receiving SMC will die from malaria or associated causes each year. We also assume that 70% of malaria cases occur during the season when SMC is delivered (and that these are the only deaths that could potentially be averted by SMC). A summary of our calculations for one country, Burkina Faso, is below as an example:\n\nWhat we are estimating Value Annual risk of death for malaria for children not receiving SMC (more) 0.38% Number of deaths indirectly caused by malaria for every one malaria death directly attributed to malaria (more) 0.75 Subtotal: Annual risk of death attributable (directly and indirectly) to malaria for children not receiving SMC 0.67% Proportion of malaria mortality occurring during the SMC season (more) 70% Total (risk of death from malaria or associated causes during the SMC season each year\n\nfor children not receiving SMC) 0.47%\n\nBaseline malaria mortality\n\nOur estimates of malaria mortality among children targeted for SMC are drawn from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) Global Burden of Disease (GBD) project. We use 2019 (the most recent published version of GBD at the time of writing) national-level estimates for malaria mortality among children 3-59 months old with the exception of Nigeria, where we use state-level estimates. In Nigeria (but not other locations), we also apply a rough adjustment of -5 to -35% (varying by state) to the GBD estimates. This is because we think the GBD estimates might not account for a recent increase in insecticide-treated net campaigns in some states in Nigeria, and could therefore overestimate malaria burden (details in footnote).\n\nThis results in estimates of annual malaria mortality rates ranging from 0.16% (Togo) to 0.38% (Burkina Faso).\n\nThese estimates are a source of significant uncertainty in our analysis. Our understanding is that the GBD estimates rely on a number of modeling assumptions, in part because raw data on malaria from health surveillance systems is relatively unreliable in many low-income countries. We have not investigated all the modeling assumptions underlying these estimates in detail and we’re not sure how accurately GBD can attribute deaths to specific causes.\n\nAn additional uncertainty is how the GBD estimates compare to other sources. In 2023, GiveWell commissioned Rethink Priorities to conduct a research project comparing the GBD estimates to widely-used estimates of malaria malaria mortality from WHO. Our understanding had been that the WHO estimates were generally lower than the IHME estimates. We were concerned that we could be systematically overestimating malaria mortality by using GBD estimates only.\n\nOverall, the report reduced our concern about this issue. The main findings of the report were:\n\nWHO’s estimates were historically significantly lower than GBD estimates (17% lower in 2019), but went through a significant methodology change in 2021 that has narrowed the gap.\n\nThe gap between sources is largest in areas outside sub-Saharan Africa, where the malaria disease burden is lower (and where GiveWell does not fund SMC).\n\nGBD estimates tend to record lower deaths among children under five, and higher deaths among older children and adults. This might be the result of GBD using verbal autopsy reports to inform its estimates, whereas WHO (and some other researchers) believe that these can’t distinguish between malaria and other febrile illnesses.\n\nWhile we’re still uncertain about the reliability of each source, and the verbal autopsy question, we opted not to change data sources following this project. The benefits of SMC are concentrated in children under five (where the gap between IHME and GBD is smaller), and so we think that switching would not not lead to major changes in our bottom line.\n\nNon-malaria deaths indirectly averted\n\nWe estimate that for each death directly caused by malaria, an additional 0.75 deaths are indirectly caused by malaria but attributed to other causes. Our reasoning is:\n\nDeaths may have several contributing factors while only being attributed to one cause. For example, malaria may increase the likelihood of death from malnutrition or other infectious diseases.\n\nMalaria control interventions often have a larger effect on all-cause mortality than would be expected exclusively from declines in malaria-specific mortality, which we interpret as evidence that averting malaria may also avert deaths attributed to other causes.\n\nWe are highly uncertain about what the exact value for this effect should be. Our rough estimate of 0.75 is based on triangulating three different sources of information:\n\nWe have spoken with malaria experts who told us that it is widely accepted there are roughly 0.5 to 1.0 indirect malaria deaths for every direct malaria death.\n\nIn our analysis of insecticide-treated nets (another malaria intervention), we estimate a ratio of up to 1.5 indirect deaths for every direct malaria death. While there are reasons to think this is an overestimate, this updates us toward thinking that high ratios are plausible (details in footnote).\n\nOur analysis of water chlorination programs, another intervention that reduces child mortality by averting infectious diseases, suggests a ratio of 2.7 deaths indirectly averted for every death directly averted from enteric infection. This also updates us toward thinking that a high ratio of indirect to direct deaths is plausible.\n\nTaking all three sources of information into account, we use a value of 0.75 as our best guess for the ratio of indirect malaria deaths to direct malaria deaths.\n\nThere are some additional lines of research we could use to check our estimate, but which we haven’t prioritized yet:\n\nAn analysis of what indirect deaths ratio would be implied by the estimates of reduced malaria and all-cause mortality in the Cochrane analysis (details in footnote).\n\nWe have seen one paper, Uyoga et. al. 2019, that uses the presence of the HbAS “sickle cell trait” (which is associated with high protection against malaria) to estimate the impact of malaria on other infectious diseases. The paper finds that the sickle cell trait is associated with strong protection against other conditions, implying additional evidence that malaria worsens other health problems. We have not fully looked into this paper or understood its methodology in depth, but we may do so in the future.\n\nHow seasonal is malaria mortality?\n\nAcross countries, we estimate that 70% of malaria deaths take place in the high-transmission season when SMC is delivered. Our analysis is sensitive to this estimate because we assume that SMC only averts malaria during the period when it is delivered.\n\nOur reasoning for the 70% assumption is:\n\nUntil 2022, WHO guidelines recommended that SMC should be deployed in areas where 60% or more of annual malaria incidence takes place within four months. Following the 2022 revisions to the guidelines, areas with 60% or more seasonal malaria remain the “priority target areas” for SMC. We therefore think of 60% as a reasonable minimum bound for this estimate.\n\nWe have reviewed an estimate from a single 2012 paper, which finds that the median proportion of malaria incidence in SMC-eligible sites occurring in the high-transmission season was 77%, and the mean proportion was 75.7%. We then adjust this modestly downward to 70% because our best guess is that, on average, the locations where Malaria Consortium currently delivers SMC have a less seasonal pattern of malaria transmission than those included in the 2012 paper.\n\nSome locations where Malaria Consortium delivers SMC have a less seasonal pattern of rainfall, and our understanding is that rainfall seasonality is correlated with malaria transmission seasonality. We would therefore expect these locations to have a lower proportion of malaria cases over an equivalent period of time. However, because of their less seasonal transmission, these locations typically have a five-month SMC delivery period rather than a four-month period. We therefore assume that the overall proportion of malaria that could be averted by SMC is the same as in locations with more seasonal transmission (70%).\n\nOur main uncertainty about this is that 70% is a rough best guess. We have not deeply investigated malaria transmission seasonality across locations. We believe that our cost-effectiveness model would benefit from additional research to inform this parameter, particularly data that would enable us to use location-specific estimates.\n\n4.3 Reduced mortality for older children and adults\n\nSummary\n\nWe estimate that SMC reduces malaria deaths by approximately 11% among older children and adults. This accounts for 2% to 14% of the total modeled benefits of SMC (varying by location). In Burkina Faso, our 25th-75th confidence interval is that this accounts for 2% to 8% of the total modeled benefits of SMC, with a best guess of 4%.\n\nThis is because delivering SMC to children under five disrupts malaria transmission, reducing malaria in the wider (untreated) population. A summary of our calculations for one country (Burkina Faso) are below.\n\nWhat we are estimating Value Reduction in malaria cases among children receiving SMC, according to one study of impact on the untreated population (Cissé et. al. 2016) (more) 60% Reduction in malaria cases among untreated older children and adults in Cissé et. al. 2016 (more) 26% Subtotal: How much did SMC reduce malaria among older children and adults, relative to children under 5, in Cissé et. al. 2016? 43% Adjustment for differences between Cissé et. al. 2016 and other SMC programs (more) -69% Reduction in mortality for children under five receiving SMC (discussed above) 79% Total (expected reduction in malaria mortality among people over age 5) 11%\n\nImpact of SMC on the untreated population\n\nOur analysis relies on a single published RCT we have reviewed, Cissé et. al. 2016. This study was not included in the 2012 Cochrane review. The study’s key features were:\n\nIt tested SMC in Senegal between 2008 and 2010 using a stepped-wedge study design. The sample size was large (approximately 14,000 children in year one, rising to approximately 160,000 in year three).\n\nThe intervention was similar to the program implemented by Malaria Consortium, involving monthly distribution of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) and amodiaquine (AQ) during the high-transmission season. It differed from Malaria Consortium’s program in that children up to age 10 received SMC.\n\nThe study found a 60% reduction (95% CI 55% - 67%) in malaria incidence (measured by rapid diagnostic test) in children living in areas that received SMC in a particular transmission season, relative to children living in areas not receiving SMC that transmission season.\n\nMalaria cases in the untreated population (older children and adults) in areas receiving SMC in a given transmission season fell by 26% (95% CI 18% - 33%) compared to people in areas not receiving SMC.\n\nThe study did not detect an effect on all-cause mortality. It was initially designed to have sufficient power to detect a decline in all-cause mortality, but mortality was lower than expected in both the treatment and control areas.\n\nOverall, we interpret Cissé et. al. 2016 as evidence that SMC reduces malaria among older children and adults who do not receive SMC. We use the 26% estimated reduction in malaria cases among this group as the starting point in our analysis. We divide this figure by the impact of SMC on the treated population in Cissé et. al. 2016 (60%) to estimate the ratio of SMC’s impact in the untreated vs the treated population (26% / 60% = 43%).\n\nAdjustment for differences in contemporary SMC programs\n\nWe account for differences between the Cissé et. al. 2016 study context and the contexts in which Malaria Consortium works today with a -69% adjustment. This incorporates two factors:\n\nDifferent age groups. Malaria Consortium’s program delivers SMC to children between the ages of 3 months and 5 years old (rather than up to 10 years old, as in Cissé et. al. 2016). We expect that because Malaria Consortium’s program treats a smaller proportion of the population, there would also be smaller effects on the untreated population. We account for this with a 47% (i.e., -53%) adjustment (details in footnote).\n\nHigher malaria transmission rates. We think that Malaria Consortium’s SMC program operates in areas with higher average malaria transmission rates than the areas in Senegal targeted in Cissé et. al. 2016. Our understanding (from an unpublished modeling study) is that this is likely to mean the indirect effects on the untreated population are proportionally lower. We account for this with a 65% (i.e., -35%) adjustment (details in footnote).\n\nWe multiply these factors together to produce our overall -69% adjustment ((47% x 65%) - 100% = -69%).\n\nShortcomings and uncertainties\n\nOur adjustment to account for differences between Cissé et. al. 2016 and Malaria Consortium’s program relies on estimates from an unpublished modeling study. We have not vetted the transmission model that the study relies on. One particular point of uncertainty is that the modeling study relies on Zongo et al. 2015, an RCT of SMC using a different drug regimen from the one used in Malaria Consortium’s program. We are unsure how this might affect our estimates.\n\n4.4 Long-term income increases\n\nSummary\n\nOur best guess is that averting childhood malaria cases leads to small income gains in adulthood. This contributes a substantial share of our estimated benefits for malaria programs. As of December 2023, we estimate that these benefits account for approximately 15% to 35% of the total modeled benefits of SMC (varying by location). In Burkina Faso, our 25th - 75th confidence interval is that this accounts for 9% - 22% of the total modeled benefits of SMC, with a best guess of 16%.\n\nTo create our best guess on the effect of reductions in malaria on later-life income, we rely on evidence from two historical quasi-experiments, Bleakley 2010 and Cutler et al. 2010, that measure the effect of eradicating malaria on later-life income in the Americas and India. Based on this evidence, we estimate that each case of childhood malaria averted increases adult income by 0.6%, and that these benefits persist over 40 years of an individual’s working life. A summary of our calculations is below, using one country, Burkina Faso, as an example:\n\nWhat we are estimating Value (rounded) Arbitrary donation to Malaria Consortium $1,000,000 Total children protected by SMC (aged 3 - 59 months) (discussed above) ~176,000 Number of children aged 5 - 14 in the national population for every child aged <5 (more) 2 Subtotal: Number of 5 - 14 year olds exposed to SMC spillovers per $1m spent ~353,000 Increase in annual income per childhood malaria case averted (more) 0.6% Baseline counterfactual malaria incidence (Age <5) (more) 60% Baseline counterfactual malaria incidence (Age 5-14) (more) 25% Reduction in malaria incidence for children aged <5 treated with SMC (discussed above) 79% Reduction in malaria incidence for children aged 5 - 14 from spillovers (discussed above) 11% Proportion of malaria cases occurring during the SMC season (discussed above) 70% Malaria cases averted by SMC per $1m spent (age <5) ~59,000 Malaria cases averted by SMC per $1m spent (age 5 - 14) ~6,500 Years until long-run income benefits start (more) 12.5 Years of long-term benefits (more) 40 Discount rate on future economic benefits (more) 4% Multiplier for resource sharing within households (more) 2 Totals Total children receiving a 0.6% long-term income increase ~65,000 Moral weight on a 0.6% increase in adult income for a child benefitting from SMC 0.23 Total units of value from income increases per year ~15,000 Total units of value from deaths averted ~81,000 % of total modeled benefits from long-term income increases 16%\n\nThe full reasoning for our estimates of the long-term impacts of malaria on income is in our separate report on insecticide-treated nets. A short summary of the evidence we use and how we apply it to SMC is below.\n\nWhat is the evidence that malaria reduces income?\n\nOur analysis of income effects relies on two studies of historical malaria eradication campaigns: Bleakley 2010 and Cutler et. al. 2010. These studies are summarized in detail in our separate report on insecticide-treated nets. In summary:\n\nBoth studies analyze the impact of malaria eradication campaigns (Cutler et. al. 2010 in India in the 1950s and Bleakley 2010 in the US in the 1920s and Colombia, Brazil, and Mexico in the 1950s).\n\nBoth find that the malaria eradication campaigns were successful at reducing malaria rates. People who benefitted from reduced exposure also saw faster income gains in adulthood relative to their peers in non-malarious areas. This suggests that averting malaria in childhood can increase income in later life.\n\nBleakley and Cutler are both retrospective, non-randomized studies that we believe are at elevated risk of publication bias. We are generally hesitant to rely on this kind of evidence in our analysis.\n\nOur overall estimate from combining these studies’ results is that averting one case of malaria for a child aged 0 to 14 raises their later life income by about 2.2%, on average. We then apply a replicability adjustment of -70% to this figure to account for our uncertainties about the evidence base (details in footnote). This results in an overall estimate of ~0.6% increased income per malaria case averted. Our calculations are available in this spreadsheet.\n\nOur approach\n\nWe apply this estimate to the expected reduction in malaria cases from SMC in each country in our analysis. Our analysis uses estimates of malaria incidence, the number of children we think will receive SMC per $1m, and the impact of SMC on malaria (details in footnote).\n\nWe then apply various adjustments to transform our estimates into the total benefit over the course of an individual's (and their household’s) lifetime:\n\nWe roughly guess that, on average, it takes 12.5 years for the impact of SMC on income to materialize for children who benefitted from SMC (details in footnote).\n\nWe use an annual discount rate of 4%. A discount rate represents the difference between how much we value increases in economic consumption now and projected economic benefits in the future. For more details on the analysis underlying this rate, see here.\n\nWe assume that each beneficiary will see benefits every year for 40 years of their life. This represents a rough guess about the average length of an individual’s working life.\n\nThe benefits of increased income via averted malaria are ultimately valuable for how much they increase a person's ability to consume goods and services. Increasing a household’s income may increase the consumption among multiple members of the household (for example, if a household has one income earner whose income increases by 10%, each member of the household may be able to consume 10% more than before). We make some rough assumptions about the likely number of household members over time and the number of wage earners in each household. We estimate that this effect doubles the overall benefit of the income gains achieved via SMC campaigns (a \"household multiplier\" of 2). See this spreadsheet for our calculations.\n\nShortcomings and uncertainties\n\nWhile we think it is plausible that averting malaria would lead to increased income in later life, we are fairly uncertain about our analysis. In particular, the historical evidence we rely on has a number of shortcomings (e.g., possible publication bias), and we’re unsure how far it generalizes to contemporary SMC programs. We discuss our uncertainties about the long-term impact of malaria on income in more detail in our report on insecticide-treated nets.\n\n4.5 Additional benefits and downsides\n\nSummary\n\nOur cost-effectiveness analysis includes a number of additional benefits and downward adjustments that we have opted not to explicitly model. Instead, we incorporate them as rough percentage best guesses.\n\nAs of December 2023, we sum these adjustments together to increase our estimate of the impact of SMC by 19% (Burkina Faso) to 34% (Nigeria). See the table below for a summary.\n\nWhat we are estimating Value Reduced malaria morbidity 9% Short-term anemia effects 9% Investment of income increases 5% Treatment costs averted from prevention 20% Adjustments for subnational malaria rates 3% Rebound effects / decreased immunity development -4% Development of drug resistance -4% Marginal funding goes to lower priority areas 0% to -15% Serious side effects -1% Failure to ingest first day’s doses of SMC -4% Total (adjustment for additional benefits and offsetting impacts) 19% to 34%\n\nWe are particularly uncertain about these adjustments (details on our method in footnote) and they should be thought of as rough best guesses. See this spreadsheet for our full calculations.\n\nAdditional benefits\n\nAs of December 2023, we include the following additional benefits in our analysis:\n\nReduced malaria morbidity (+9%): SMC results in averted morbidity by reducing malaria cases. This includes averted morbidity from cerebral malaria, which can involve significant neurological and cognitive impairments, as well as epilepsy. Our current adjustment for averted morbidity is 9%. In 2023, we conducted some rough internal (unpublished) analysis suggesting that we may be overestimating this adjustment (and the adjustment below for anemia) and that malaria morbidity is a lower share of benefits than we had previously assumed. We are planning to investigate this question in more detail in the future, but haven’t prioritized this yet.\n\nShort-term anemia effects (+9%). Malaria infection is a risk factor for anemia, and there is evidence that malaria control interventions reduce anemia. We account for this effect in our analysis with an adjustment of 9%.\n\nInvestment of income increases (+5%). We think that SMC might increase people’s incomes in later life (see above). If this is correct, some recipients might invest a portion of their increased income. We include a 5% adjustment to account for this. Including this benefit is consistent with our approach for other programs that we think lead to income increases, although the specific adjustment used varies case-by-case.\n\nTreatment costs averted from prevention (+20%). By reducing childhood mortality and morbidity, SMC may also avert costs that would have been incurred to seek and receive treatment for disease. These savings include the direct costs of treating malaria (incurred by households or the medical system), as well as indirect costs (e.g., caregivers taking time off work to care for sick children). We account for these savings with a 20% upward adjustment. This adjustment is consistent across all GiveWell’s top charities focused on improving child health. We chose to use a consistent figure because our model for estimating the value of costs of illness averted was very similar across these interventions (all around 20%), and we thought that explicitly modeling this benefit stream across countries would not be worth the added complexity. For more detail on our reasoning, see this summary.\n\nSubnational adjustments (+3%). Our analysis uses national-level data on malaria burden for most countries. We expect that, in general, SMC campaigns will be targeted toward higher burden areas than average. To account for this, we include a 3% upward adjustment.\n\nOffsetting impacts\n\nRebound effects (-4%). Some researchers have argued that another malaria program, insecticide-treated nets, may reduce opportunities for children to develop immunity and make them more susceptible to malaria over the long term (by averting cases in the short term). This could also apply to SMC. Three of the studies in the meta-analysis we rely on to estimate the impact of SMC (Meremikwu et al. 2012) investigated this question and found no evidence of a rebound effect in the high-transmission season after the SMC programs ended. However, we have not seen any evidence about the long-term risk of rebound effects. We include a small (-4%) adjustment in our analysis to account for the risk of rebound effects.\n\nDevelopment of drug resistance (-4%). SMC may increase the development of resistance to SP and AQ, the antimalarial drugs used in SMC. To understand more about this, we spoke with Professor Sir Brian Greenwood (Professor of Clinical Tropical Medicine at London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine) in 2017 about timelines for possible development of drug resistance. He told us:\n\nIt is very likely that, if SP and AQ are used on a wide scale for SMC, resistance will develop eventually.\n\nTimelines are uncertain, but he believes based on historical experience that resistance to SP/AQ is unlikely to develop in the next 5 to 10 years.\n\nSome resistance to SP has emerged in East Africa, but AQ has relatively little history of resistance.\n\nIf resistance to SP/AQ did develop, dihydroartemisinin-piperarquine (DHAPQ) may be a viable alternative, although we have not carefully reviewed the evidence for DHAPQ.\n\nWe revisited this question in 2020. Our analysis was based on a study of genetic resistance markers conducted before and after the first two seasons of mass SMC administration during ACCESS-SMC (in 2016 and 2018). The study found low prevalence of resistance to SP and AQ overall. However, the prevalence of drug resistance markers associated with SP grew from 0.4% to 0.7% during the study among children under five, and 0.2% to 1% among people aged 10 to 30 years. AQ resistance did not increase. At the time, we interpreted these results to be evidence of increasing resistance, but at a low enough level that it would be accounted for by our existing -4% adjustment.\n\nWe have not revisited our analysis on drug resistance in the Sahel since 2020 (we have since done additional analysis of drug resistance outside the Sahel, details in footnote). This is a significant uncertainty in our analysis and a possible way in which we’re overestimating the impact of SMC, as resistance is likely to have developed further since that time. We expect to update our analysis of resistance using more recent data in the future. We are also planning to spend time thinking about how we can monitor future resistance trends more effectively (e.g., by funding monitoring studies).\n\nMarginal funding goes to lower priority areas (0 to -15%): If there is not enough funding available to fully reach the SMC-eligible population, our guess is that some countries will make prioritization decisions to exclude some lower burden areas. In effect, providing additional funding for SMC allows these lower burden areas to be covered. This would imply we could be overestimating cost-effectiveness by using malaria burden data at the national level. We account for this with a downward adjustment (0 - 15%, depending on the location). Our estimates are based on a best guess about how each country's government would allocate SMC if we do not provide additional funding and what the impact of this on cost-effectiveness would be. To determine this, we consider:\n\nWhat prioritization the national government has done in the past (if any),\n\nThe variation in malaria prevalence across the country, and\n\nThe proportion of SMC funding in the country provided by GiveWell (as a proxy for scope to prioritize areas in the absence of GiveWell funding).\n\nOn this basis, we use a subjective -15% adjustment for Burkina Faso and -5% for Togo (details in footnote). We use a value of 0% for Nigeria, where Malaria Consortium supports SMC programs at the state level (and we therefore use state-level estimates of malaria burden, meaning an additional adjustment would be double-counting).\n\nSerious side effects (-1%): We include a -1% adjustment to account for the impact of serious side effects from SMC. Severe adverse effects associated with SP/AQ appear to be very rare. In 2019, we lightly reviewed (in this document) two large studies that tracked adverse events in recent SMC distributions in sub-Saharan Africa. found very low rates of serious adverse events and no deaths that were clearly attributable to SMC (although we did not deeply vet the study methodologies). We did a rough calculation using very pessimistic assumptions that suggests severe adverse events from SMC are very small in comparison to the magnitude of the benefits.\n\nWe revisited this question in 2023 based on a deeper (unpublished) review of a substudy in one of the earlier papers we reviewed. We would expect this substudy to have a stronger method for detecting adverse events than the other studies we previously reviewed (details in footnote). Using data only from this study, we calculated a worst-case estimate (using very pessimistic assumptions) implying that deaths caused by SMC are ~1.4% of the mortality reduction from SMC. We think this suggests that the true rate of mortality from adverse events, if it occurs, is probably between 0 and 3 children per 100,000 treated, whereas SMC averts 213 deaths per 100,000 children treated. Because this was in line with our current adjustment, we opted not to make a quantitative adjustment.\n\nFailure to ingest first day’s doses of SMC (-4%). Our estimates of the number of children reached with SMC per dollar donated rely on our analysis of the cost to deliver each cycle of SMC, which in turn relies on coverage surveys conducted by Malaria Consortium. Our understanding is that Malaria Consortium's coverage surveys are designed to assess whether children received the first day of SMC, but that they are not designed to measure the degree to which the medicines are fully ingested by program participants. We have heard of cases of children vomiting drugs back up, and these children may be recorded as receiving the first day’s doses even if they have not experienced the benefits. We account for the risk that this inflates our estimates of the number of children reached with SMC with a -4% adjustment.\n\nFactors we have excluded\n\nPossible interaction with insecticide treated nets (ITNs). It is possible that, in areas where children are protected by both insecticide treated nets and SMC, the impact of SMC could be lower (e.g., if deaths that would have been averted by SMC are already being averted by nets). Two of the RCTs in the Cochrane review promoted the use of nets to both the intervention and control group in addition to SMC, and found similar proportional reductions in malaria to studies that did not promote nets. Our analysis attempts to account for the impact of ITNs on malaria burden in each location where we fund SMC (more above). However, in light of this evidence we don’t make an additional downward adjustment for SMC leading to a lower proportional reduction in malaria than observed in the RCTs.\n\nDrug quality and dosage. Malaria Consortium told us that its policy is to only procure products from suppliers that meet WHO guidelines for pre-qualification quality assurance standards, and that these products are approved and quality-assured by the governments of countries where Malaria Consortium works. We have not yet asked Malaria Consortium for the details of these processes. If there were issues with drug quality or dosage, it could reduce the effectiveness of the intervention and lead to more rapid development of drug resistance.\n\n4.6 Grantee-level adjustments\n\nSummary\n\nOur cost-effectiveness analyses also include adjustments relating to the specific organizations we recommend rather than the intervention itself. These reflect aspects of the organization’s delivery of a program that might have an impact on cost-effectiveness. Rather than explicitly model these, we apply them as rough percentage best guesses.\n\nAs of December 2023, our estimate is that these factors reduce the cost-effectiveness of Malaria Consortium’s SMC program by 8% on net. A summary of our calculations is below:\n\nWhat we are estimating Value Risk of wastage 0% Quality of monitoring and evaluation -2% Confidence in funds being used for intended purpose -6% Total (adjustment for grantee-level factors) -8%\n\nAdjustments in detail\n\nRisk of wastage\n\nThe main adjustment that we have considered here is \"double treatment\" (i.e., a scenario where SMC is delivered to children who don't benefit or minimally benefit because they have recently received it elsewhere). We do not currently account for this risk in our analysis (i.e., we use a 0% adjustment). Our reasoning for this assumption is:\n\nOur understanding is that SMC is only delivered through mass campaigns like those supported by Malaria Consortium. SMC is a relatively recent intervention, and it has been rapidly scaled up in the countries supported by GiveWell. We therefore believe that we have a relatively comprehensive understanding of the SMC landscape, and we believe it is unlikely that there are other forms of SMC delivery we are not aware of.\n\nThe World Health Organization recommends that national governments prohibit the private sale of SP or AQ in areas implementing SMC. Our understanding is that this is because of the risk of toxicity from repeat doses, and to minimize the risk of increasing resistance to SP and AQ. This strengthens our confidence that children are very unlikely to receive SMC through other sources.\n\nQuality of monitoring and evaluation\n\nWe use a downward adjustment of -2% to account for the quality of Malaria Consortium’s monitoring and evaluation. This adjustment reflects our best guess at the extent to which methodological aspects of Malaria Consortium’s monitoring could inflate its estimates of the number of children reached with SMC.\n\nMalaria Consortium conducts monitoring surveys after the campaigns it supports to estimate the proportion of children who received SMC. We believe these surveys are high-quality overall and provide evidence that a high proportion of target children were reached. Our main reservations are that the surveys rely on caregiver self-reports about whether their children received SMC (which we would guess somewhat inflate the true proportion of children reached) and that there are discrepancies between different types of surveys (those conducted after each cycle of SMC and those conducted after each year’s SMC season) in some locations. Because our level of confidence in Malaria Consortium’s monitoring is high overall, we use a relatively low (-2%) value for this adjustment.\n\nConfidence in funds being used for intended purpose\n\nWe use a downward adjustment of -6% to account for the risk that GiveWell-directed funding for Malaria Consortium’s SMC program will not be used for its intended purpose. This figure incorporates two factors:\n\nChange of priorities (-1%). This refers to a scenario where Malaria Consortium uses GiveWell-directed funding for other work that Malaria Consortium sees as related to the program, but that we don't find valuable. This adjustment is small because Malaria Consortium used a small amount of funding provided by GiveWell in 2017 in unexpected ways (primarily supplemental monitoring), but has not done so since then.\n\nWithin-organization fungibility (-5%). This refers to a scenario where GiveWell-directed funding for Malaria Consortium’s SMC program frees up some Malaria Consortium funding and fundraising efforts that would have gone to SMC for other uses. Our best guess is that these other uses will be less cost-effective overall than SMC. This adjustment is relatively small because we think Malaria Consortium has limited unrestricted funding relative to the size of its SMC program. However, we know of one example where Malaria Consortium had the option of applying for funding for SMC and chose to apply for a different program because SMC is relatively well funded.\n\n5. How does the program affect other actors’ spending?\n\n5.1 Summary\n\nPart of our cost-effectiveness analysis involves asking what impact funding a program has on other actors’ spending. Additional funding for SMC may lead other organizations or governments to spend more (we refer to this as \"leveraging\" funding, or “crowding in”) or less (we refer to this as \"funging,\" from “fungibility,” or “crowding out”) on SMC than they otherwise would.\n\nWe include a “leverage and funging” adjustment in our cost-effectiveness analysis to account for this. As of December 2023, our leverage and funging adjustment is -8% to -51%, varying by location (-43% in Burkina Faso). A summary of calculations is below, using Burkina Faso as an example:\n\nWhat we are estimating Value Grant size (arbitrary value) $1,000,000 Value of Malaria Consortium spending on SMC in Burkina Faso (more) 0.105 Total units of value generated by Malaria Consortium spending ~105,000 Costs covered by other actors per $1m spent by Malaria Consortium (more) Burkina Faso government ~$118,000 Other philanthropic actors (UNICEF) ~$9,000 What would happen if we did not fund the program (more) The Global Fund and/or PMI costs would replace philanthropic costs 50% probability Nobody would replace fund the program 50% probability Estimated value of activities that would be funded by other actors instead of SMC Activities funded by the Burkina Faso government (more) 0.005 Activities funded by the Global Fund and/or PMI (more) 0.015 Change in value under different scenarios Nobody would fund the program (leverage) ~ -300 The Global Fund and/or PMI would fund the program (funging) ~ -45,000 Final adjustments Adjustment for diverting other actors’ spending into SMC (leverage) -0.3% Adjustment for diverting other actors’ away from SMC (funging) -43% Total: Adjustment for leverage and funging -43%\n\nWe think of these adjustments as particularly uncertain inputs in our analysis. Our biggest areas of uncertainty are:\n\nOur analysis of how other actors will behave if we do not make a grant are necessarily subjective guesses, as we can only speculate about their future priorities and decisions.\n\nOur adjustments rely on estimates of the value of other programs that other actors might fund instead of SMC. We outline the estimates and our reasoning for them below, but these are rough estimates based on limited information. We have also invested considerably less time in producing these estimates than we have in our main cost-effectiveness analyses, and they should be thought of as rougher guesses.\n\n5.2 Leverage\n\nLeverage refers to extra funding for SMC causing other actors to spend more on SMC than they otherwise would. We already account for the main part of this effect in our cost per SMC cycle calculations (where we exclude in-kind government resources that we think our funding leverages). This means the benefit of these resources is already baked into our main calculations. To account for these resources, we make a small negative adjustment here reflecting that they will not be used for other programs. We estimate that this effect reduces our initial cost-effectiveness estimate by a negligible amount (0.3% in Burkina Faso).\n\nWe use the following reasoning:\n\nWe think that each $1m spent by Malaria Consortium causes the Burkina Faso government to incur ~$118,000 of in-kind costs (e.g., staff time).\n\nWe exclude these costs from the cost side of the equation when we estimate the number of children reached by SMC and deaths averted in the main part of our cost-effectiveness analysis (more above). But the benefit of these resources is already incorporated in our initial impact calculations. We account for them by deducting the value of the programs we think they would have been spent on otherwise (see this blog post for more on why we use this approach).\n\nOur best guess is that if these resources were not used for SMC, the Burkina Faso government would have used them for something ~5% as cost-effective. In total, diverting these funds away from other programs “costs” about 600 units of value (calculation in footnote, more on units of value here).\n\nWe think there’s approximately a 50% chance that nobody would replace GiveWell’s SMC funding in Burkina Faso in GiveWell’s absence. This implies that the funding causes the government to divert its resources away from other programs into SMC. For more context, see below.\n\nOur final leverage adjustment involves multiplying ~600 units of value by 50%, and deducting the total (~300) from our estimate of the total value generated by Malaria Consortium’s spending. This equates to a -0.3% adjustment.\n\nIntuitively, the reasons this adjustment is small are (i) that the Burkina Faso government’s resources constitute a relatively small proportion of the total cost of the program, and (ii) that we think the other activities the Burkina Faso government might use its resources on are considerably less cost-effective than SMC. This means the value lost from diverting these funds away from other activities is relatively small.\n\n5.3 Funging\n\nFunging refers to extra funding for SMC causing other actors to spend less on SMC than they otherwise would. We estimate that this effect reduces cost-effectiveness by about 43% in Burkina Faso.\n\nOur reasoning is:\n\nAt the time we made our most recent grant, we thought that there was a 50% chance that other malaria funders (specifically the Global Fund and/or PMI) would replace GiveWell’s SMC funding in Burkina Faso in GiveWell’s absence (10% - 65% in other locations). This was a rough guess, based on our understanding of the SMC funding landscape in Burkina Faso. See below for more details on our reasoning.\n\nIf other actors were to replace GiveWell’s spending, this implies that the true impact of the spending is to free up their resources for other activities. Our best guess is that the activities other funders might fund instead are about 1/7 as cost-effective as SMC in Burkina Faso, and therefore we would lose ~90,000 units of value, relative to our initial estimate of the total value generated by Malaria Consortium’s spending (calculation in footnote).\n\nWe think that there’s a 50% chance that other actors would replace GiveWell’s SMC spending. For our final funging adjustment, we therefore multiply by 50% and deduct the total (~45,000 units of value) from our estimate of the total value generated by Malaria Consortium’s spending. This equates to a -43% adjustment.\n\nIntuitively, the reason this adjustment is relatively large is that we think there’s a substantial (50%) chance that the real impact of GiveWell’s funding for SMC in Burkina Faso is simply to free up other actors’ funding for other activities that we think are probably less cost-effective.\n\n5.4 Breakdown of our analysis\n\nPercentage of costs paid by different actors\n\nWe estimate the proportion of program costs paid for by different actors. These estimates are based on our cost analysis (discussed above). Overall, we think that for each $1m spent by Malaria Consortium on SMC:\n\nThe Burkina Faso government incurs about $118,000 in in-kind costs (e.g., staff time).\n\nOther philanthropic actors (e.g., in Burkina Faso, UNICEF has contributed a small amount of funding) incur approximately $9,000 in costs for delivering SMC.\n\nWhat would happen if GiveWell did not fund SMC?\n\nWe make guesses about what would happen to other actors’ spending on SMC if GiveWell did not provide Malaria Consortium funding to deliver the campaign. For Burkina Faso, we most recently estimated these probabilities as part of a January 2023 grant. We guessed that if GiveWell had not provided Malaria Consortium funding for the campaign:\n\nThere was a 50% chance that the Global Fund and/or PMI would replace Malaria Consortium’s costs (Scenario 2).\n\nThere was a 50% chance that nobody would replace Malaria Consortium’s costs (Scenario 4).\n\nThese guesses were based on our analysis of the malaria funding landscape (globally and in Burkina Faso). Some of the points we considered (more details on our grant page) were:\n\nSMC has been fully funded in Burkina Faso since at least 2019. (This includes funding from GiveWell donors.) All else equal, we thought this increased the likelihood that other actors would plug funding gaps in GiveWell’s absence.\n\nWe thought it was plausible that, if GiveWell reduced its support for SMC, the Global Fund would reallocate funding to cover some or all of the gap. We knew of one previous occasion where the Global Fund increased its support for Burkina Faso's SMC program using reallocated funding.\n\nThe Global Fund, which has historically been a major funder of SMC in Burkina Faso, appeared to have plateauing funding for malaria at the time we made the grant (details in footnote). By contrast, we expected funding needs for malaria control to increase over the years covered by the grant (e.g., because of population growth, inflation, and the introduction of new interventions). We thought this made it less likely that the Global Fund would cover the full funding gap for SMC than we had previously guessed.\n\nHow valuable is SMC, compared to the activities that other actors might fund instead?\n\nOur leverage and funging adjustments estimate the impact of shifting funding to or from SMC campaigns in Burkina Faso, relative to other activities that governments and other funders might fund instead. This means that we need to estimate the value of these other activities.\n\nTo do this, we compare activities in terms of \"units of value,\" an arbitrary unit GiveWell uses to compare the moral value of different types of outcomes (e.g., increased income vs reduced deaths). We benchmark the value of each benefit to a value of 1, which we define as the value of doubling someone’s consumption for one year. See this document for more details on how we think about comparing value across different interventions.\n\nOur analysis of leverage and funging for SMC in Burkina Faso involves three specific estimates:\n\nMalaria Consortium spending on SMC in Burkina Faso (before leverage and funging): 0.105 units of value per $ (more)\n\nActivities that domestic governments might fund instead of SMC: 0.005 units of value per $ (more)\n\nActivities that the Global Fund or PMI might support instead of SMC: 0.015 units of value per $ (more)\n\nOur estimates of the other activities that might be funded instead of SMC are based on considerably less work than our main cost-effectiveness analysis, and so we think of them as rougher guesses.\n\nMalaria Consortium spending on SMC in Burkina Faso\n\nWe estimate that each dollar spent by Malaria Consortium on SMC in Burkina Faso generates 0.105 units of value. This figure is the final output generated by our cost-effectiveness analysis, after factoring in all adjustments except leverage and funging.\n\nActivities that domestic governments might fund instead of SMC\n\nWe estimate that each dollar of in-kind resources that the Burkina Faso government contributes to SMC would generate 0.005 units of value if used for other activities. This is around 1/20 as valuable as our estimate of spending on SMC.\n\nIn summary, our approach is:\n\nWe estimate that 80% of these resources would be used on health programs, 10% would be used for education programs and 10% would be used on social security programs. This is a very rough best guess, for which we have not done any in-depth research.\n\nNext, we estimate the value of spending in each category (details on our approach in footnote). This results in the following estimates:\n\nHealth: 0.0056 units of value per $ spent\n\nEducation: 0.0028 units of value per $ spent\n\nSocial security: 0.0026 units of value per $ spent\n\nFinally, we take a weighted average of the value of each type of spending, with our guesses about how the spending would be allocated (80% health / 10% education / 10% social security) as the weights. This results in an overall estimate of 0.005 units of value per dollar spent.\n\nActivities that the Global Fund might fund instead of SMC\n\nWe estimate that each dollar that the Global Fund spends on other activities rather than SMC in Burkina Faso generates 0.015 units of value. This is around 1/7 as valuable as our estimate of spending on SMC in Burkina Faso.\n\nOur calculations for this estimate are available in this spreadsheet. In summary, our approach is:\n\nThe Global Fund funds HIV, tuberculosis (TB), and malaria programs. We assume that all funding that the Global Fund could use for SMC in Burkina Faso but actually uses for other activities is spent on programs combating these diseases.\n\nWe estimate the value of spending on each type of program (details on our approach in footnote). This results in estimates (here) that the Global Fund’s spending on HIV programs is 1.1x as cost-effective as direct cash transfers (GiveWell’s benchmark for comparing the value of different programs), and its spending on TB programs is 3.2x as cost-effective.\n\nFor malaria, we conduct a more detailed analysis, breaking down Global Fund spending by seven types of malaria program that it may fund instead of SMC in Burkina Faso (varying in cost-effectiveness from 0.5 to 13.6x, depending on the program).\n\nFinally, we estimate the overall value of the Global Fund’s spending on other activities. We calculate a weighted average of each of the programs discussed above in proportion to how likely we think it is to spend reallocated funding on that activity. These estimates are based on 2017-2019 data on how funding reallocated within the Global Fund portfolio in that period was used. We do not have permission to publish this data, and so our full calculations are available on a separate spreadsheet (only available to GiveWell staff). This weighted average produces our overall estimate of 0.0154 units of value per $ spent (equivalent to 4.6x as cost-effective as direct cash transfers).\n\n6. Additional perspectives beyond our cost-effectiveness model\n\n6.1 Summary\n\nIn theory, our cost-effectiveness analysis intends to capture the total impact of a program per dollar spent. But we recognize that our cost-effectiveness calculations are not able to capture every factor that could make a program more or less impactful. Focusing only on our cost-effectiveness model may mean we’re missing things that are difficult to quantify.\n\nAs a result, we think it’s helpful to look at other perspectives and types of evidence that may not be captured in our bottom line cost-effectiveness number. Some additional questions we have considered are:\n\nIs there evidence that large-scale SMC campaigns lead to reductions in malaria?\n\nShould GiveWell be promoting SMC in other ways?\n\nDo experts and practitioners see SMC as a good program?\n\nIs GiveWell’s funding of SMC crowding out other funders over the long term?\n\nIs it intuitively plausible that SMC is cost-effective?\n\nHow does our cost-effectiveness model compare to others?\n\nDoes SMC have unintended negative consequences?\n\nHow accurate was our analysis of SMC in hindsight?\n\nWill SMC remain impactful in the future?\n\nWe see asking these questions as a type of “cluster thinking,” or considering a program from multiple perspectives. The more additional perspectives we’ve considered, in general the more confident we are in our funding recommendations.\n\nOverall, the additional perspectives we’ve considered give us some additional confidence that SMC is a good investment. In particular, we find it encouraging that:\n\nSMC has scaled up rapidly over time (indicating widespread support from the global malaria community. (More)\n\nSMC appears to have relatively few unintended negative consequences. (More)\n\nThere is evidence that SMC and the RTS,S vaccine delivered together are more effective than either intervention alone. We see this as important because we expect the vaccine rollout to play a major role in the malaria landscape in the future. (More)\n\nBut we have spent considerably less time and effort engaging with these questions than we have on our main cost-effectiveness model. Major gaps in our analysis include:\n\nOver the long term, GiveWell’s funding for SMC could create an expectation of future funding. This could mean we crowd out funding from other funders (i.e., displace funding that would have gone to SMC into investments that may be less cost-effective). We have found it challenging to find evidence either way on whether this is happening. (More)\n\nWe have seen two other cost-effectiveness studies that find higher cost-per-death-averted estimates than ours, although we haven’t investigated them in detail. (More)\n\nWe haven’t conducted much “backwards-looking” analysis to understand if our projections about SMC were correct in hindsight (e.g., would other funders fill funding gaps in our absence?). (More)\n\n6.2 Is there evidence that large-scale SMC programs lead to reductions in malaria?\n\nWhy is this important? We generally rely on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for evidence about the causal impact of a program. But all else equal, it strengthens our confidence if there’s evidence that large-scale programs show similar impact to studies conducted in experimental conditions. There might be a number of reasons why these programs might not be delivered to the same quality at scale.\n\nHow we’ve accounted for this\n\nOur bottom line\n\nA large observational study of the ACCESS-SMC program found a smaller impact of SMC (~25% to ~55% reduction in outpatient malaria cases) than would be suggested by RCTs. We see this study as a small downward update to our best guess about the impact of SMC. We do not currently make an adjustment to account for this, but we may update our analysis in the future.\n\nIn more detail\n\nWe have seen several studies evaluating the impact of large-scale SMC programs. These include an observational study of the ACCESS-SMC project (a large multi-organization program in seven countries in which Malaria Consortium led delivery of SMC in three: Chad, Burkina Faso, and Nigeria) (ACCESS-SMC Partnership 2020), case-control studies designed to measure the efficacy of SMC from five countries in the ACCESS-SMC program, and an assessment of the impact of SMC on malaria rates in Burkina Faso and Chad from 2013 to 2018 and Nigeria from 2017 to 2018 based on administrative data on malaria cases in areas with and without SMC.\n\nWe have paid mo"
