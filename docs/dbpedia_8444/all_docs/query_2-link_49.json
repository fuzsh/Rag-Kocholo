        "text": "In general, women continue to gain access to land through their husbands, who by custom are required to make a portion of their agricultural plots available to their wife or wives. Women’s plots have a mixed status, between a gift and a loan. In some cases, they become the property of the women, particularly on the death of their husbands or on their own death, since their children inherit these plots. In other cases, the plot is ploughed back into the bulk of the inheritance to be shared on the death of the husband, or it reverts to the husband in the event of the wife’s passing. Most often the statutory right to inherit is superseded by the customary practice of a man’s property passing to the male members of his family. (Diarra-Doka 2014; Kaboré et al 2014).\n\nFurther complicating the land tenure security of women are the sometimes-unanticipated practical requirements to formalize and protect land rights. For example, to obtain an APFR one must first possess a national identify card. The government is now in the process of replacing national ID cards with biometric cards issued by the regional Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) organization.6 While approximately 90% of men had national ID cards, only 30-40 percent of women had these cards. It is unclear if women will still hold fewer biometric ID cards than men. However, if extra time and expense is required to obtain appropriate documentation in support of formalized land rights this often disproportionately impacts women, making it more difficult for them to pursue legal protection of informally recognized rights (ONF personal communication 2016).\n\nIn 2009/2010 the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA) commissioned AH Consulting to conduct a baseline agricultural survey prior to AGRA-sponsored interventions. Among many other items the survey includes information on how property rights to land are distributed within households. The survey sample size is 1,040 households in three regions (Boucle du Mouhoun, Région de l’Est and Les Cascades). The global result is that 96 percent of household parcels are “owned” by the head of the household, between 0.7 and 1.8 percent of the parcels are owned by the “spouse”, and 5.2, 3.5 and 0 percent (depending on the region) are owned by the “head and spouse”; and 5.6, 1.6 and 0.2 percent (depending on the region) are owned by the “head, spouse and children (AGRA 2014).\n\nWhile the AGRA study suggested that women faced obstacles to becoming proprietors of land, women sometimes find it easier than men to access loaned or borrowed land. Landholders are more willing to lend to women because women cannot claim permanent rights to land and are easier to evict. Married women usually have more avenues to access land than unmarried women, who often can only access their mothers’ fields. A widow can choose to be ‘inherited’ by one of her husband’s brothers and thus stay on the land, although the practice of levirate marriage is prohibited by law in Burkina Faso. Access to land loans may become easier and more secure for women as contracts are formalized through writing. Similarly, as the land market develops, an increase in the use of written transactions may provide women with more secure avenues to access land ownership (Kaboré et al 2014; Hughes 2014).\n\nAnother evolving influence on women’s access to land is the role played by the government and its partners sponsoring programs to increase agricultural development. Some examples suggest that development projects have undermined women’s rights by reinforcing traditional tenure institutions and ignoring the existing rights of women. Operation Rice, a water infrastructure project, undertook to improve lowland areas and then allocated the improved plots to household heads. Those lowlands had been controlled by the women to grow rice; when allocated to male household heads, the land was no longer accessible to women. In subsequent phases of the project, this gender bias was removed. Other development projects, such as the MCC Agriculture Development Project implemented in the Sourou Valley between 2009-2014, has ensured that significant proportions of newly-developed irrigation plots are assigned to women and women’s groups whose land rights are formally secured (FAO 2007; Davis 2014)."
