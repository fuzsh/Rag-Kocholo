        "text": "Burkina Faso is one of the poorest countries in the world with almost half of the country’s population living below the poverty line. Nevertheless, there have been positive trends with regards to infant mortality, maternal mortality, life expectancy and education. In recent years, Burkina Faso has also put in place a set of reforms aimed at moving towards universal access to health services with a social health protection scheme. The Global Fund is a key partner of the government in the health sector. In a country with one of the highest malaria burdens among the Africa region (fourth expressed as a proportion of the population), Global Fund’s investment is crucial and has demonstrated impact through increased access to diagnosis and treatment. The country is facing a generalized HIV epidemic with high prevalence in sub-populations (men who have sex with men, sex workers). Multidrug-resistant TB and TB/HIV co-infection remain priority areas for future investments.\n\nAHO PRIORITIES FOR HEALTH DELIVERY PLAN IN BURKINA FASO\n\nPerinatal deaths.\n\nInjuries and accidents\n\nTeenage pregnancies and low birth-weight babies.\n\nMalignant neoplasms\n\nDiabetes and hypertension.\n\nHIV/AIDS.\n\nEnvironmental health (prevention of outbreaks of dengue and diarrhoeal diseases and monitoring of food, water, and environmental determinants of chronic diseases).\n\nHospital information/surveillance systems.\n\nHealth promotion, focusing on healthy lifestyles (risk factors for heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, and cancers).\n\nRESOURCES (USD)\n\nAHO BURKINA FASO BUDGET 2020 (USD million) * based on 2017 pop 19.19 million World Bank\n\nSO BUDGET ITEM AMOUNT* 1 Combating communicable diseases 319 2 Tackling non communicable diseases 320 3 Addressing determinants of health & risk factors 318 4 Modernising health system and health service 315 5 Improving preparedness, surveillance and response 317 6 Developing good governance & corporate services 320 Total 1,919\n\nAHO estimates that it needs to spend at least USD100 per capita on health to meet the basic health needs of the people in Africa. This is too far below developed countries e.g. in England it is US$1,300 per capita (2017)"
