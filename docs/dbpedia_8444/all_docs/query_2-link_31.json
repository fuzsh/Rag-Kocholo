        "text": "Population media center began working in Burkina Faso in February of 2004\n\nBurkina Faso is a country approximately the size of New Zealand with a population of almost 16 million located in western Africa. The annual population growth rate of Burkina Faso is 3%, which left unchanged means the population will double by 2045.\n\nThe fertility rate in Burkina Faso is the eighth highest in the world, driven by large family size. In general, men and women want large families, but 29% of married women ages 15–49 reported to the Demographic and Health Survey that they would like to space or limit births, but they’re not currently using any method of family planning. In Burkina Faso, 5.93 children are born to every woman, and more than 39% of these children are subjected to child labor."
