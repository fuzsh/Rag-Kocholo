        "text": "Introduction\n\nBackground\n\nMany of Burkina Fasoâs ethnic groups arrived in the region between the 12th and 15th centuries. The Gurma and Mossi peoples established several of the largest kingdoms in the area and used horse-mounted warriors in military campaigns. Of the various Mossi kingdoms, the most powerful were Ouagadougou and Yatenga. In the late 19th century, European states competed for control of the region. France eventually conquered the area and established it as a French protectorate.\n\nThe country achieved independence from France in 1960 and changed its name to Burkina Faso in 1984. Repeated military coups were common in the countryâs first few decades. In 1987 Blaise COMPAORE deposed the president, established a government, and ruled for 27 years. In 2014, COMPAORE resigned after protests against his repeated efforts to amend the constitution's two-term presidential limit. An interim administration led a year-long transition, organizing presidential and legislative elections. In 2015, Roch Marc Christian KABORE was elected president, and he was reelected in 2020. In 2022, the military conducted two takeovers: In January, army colonel Paul Henri DAMIBA overthrew KABORE in a coup d'etat, and then in September, army captain Ibrahim TRAORE deposed DAMIBA and declared himself transition president. The transition government planned to hold elections by July 2024, but they may be delayed due to security concerns.\n\nTerrorist groups -- including groups affiliated with Al-Qaâida and the Islamic State -- began attacks in the country in 2016 and conducted attacks in the capital in 2016, 2017, and 2018. By early 2023, insecurity in Burkina Faso had displaced more than 2 million people and led to significant jumps in humanitarian needs and food insecurity. In addition to terrorism, the country faces a myriad of problems including high population growth, recurring drought, pervasive and perennial food insecurity, and limited natural resources. It is one of the worldâs poorest countries.\n\nÂ\n\nTip\n\nVisit the Definitions and Notes page to view a description of each topic.\n\nDefinitions and Notes\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nWestern Africa, north of Ghana\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n13 00 N, 2 00 W\n\nMap references\n\nAfrica\n\nArea\n\ntotal : 274,200 sq km\n\nland: 273,800 sq km\n\nwater: 400 sq km\n\ncomparison ranking : total 76\n\nArea - comparative\n\nslightly larger than Colorado\n\nLand boundaries\n\ntotal: 3,611 km\n\nborder countries (6): Benin 386 km; Cote d'Ivoire 545 km; Ghana 602 km; Mali 1325 km; Niger 622 km; Togo 131 km\n\nCoastline\n\n0 km (landlocked)\n\nMaritime claims\n\nnone (landlocked)\n\nClimate\n\nthree climate zones including a hot tropical savanna with a short rainy season in the southern half, a tropical hot semi-arid steppe climate typical of the Sahel region in the northern half, and small area of hot desert in the very north of the country bordering the Sahara Desert\n\nTerrain\n\nmostly flat to dissected, undulating plains; hills in the west and southeast; occupies an extensive plateau with savanna that is grassy in the north and gradually gives way to sparse forests in the south\n\nElevation\n\nhighest point: Tena Kourou 749 m\n\nlowest point: Mouhoun (Black Volta) River 200 m\n\nmean elevation: 297 m\n\nNatural resources\n\ngold, manganese, zinc, limestone, marble, phosphates, pumice, salt\n\nLand use\n\nagricultural land: 44.2% (2018 est.)\n\narable land: 22% (2018 est.)\n\npermanent crops: 37% (2018 est.)\n\npermanent pasture: 21.93% (2018 est.)\n\nforest: 19.3% (2018 est.)\n\nother: 36.5% (2018 est.)\n\nIrrigated land\n\n550 sq km (2016)\n\nMajor rivers (by length in km)\n\nVolta river source (shared with Ghana [m]) - 1,600 km\n\nnote â [s] after country name indicates river source; [m] after country name indicates river mouth\n\nMajor watersheds (area sq km)\n\nAtlantic Ocean drainage: Niger (2,261,741 sq km), Volta (410,991 sq km)\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nMost of the population is located in the center and south.

Almost 65% of the population is under the age of 25 as of 2020, and the population is growing at 2.5% annually. Mortality rates, especially those of infants and children, have decreased because of improved health care, hygiene, and sanitation, but women continue to have an average of more than 4 children. Even if fertility were substantially reduced, todayâs large cohort entering their reproductive years would sustain high population growth for the foreseeable future. Only about a third of the population is literate and unemployment is widespread, dampening the economic prospects of Burkina Fasoâs large working-age population.\n\nMigration has traditionally been a way of life for Burkinabe, with seasonal migration being replaced by stints of up to two years abroad. Cote dâIvoire remains the top destination, although it has experienced periods of internal conflict. Under French colonization, Burkina Faso became a main labor source for agricultural and factory work in Cote dâIvoire. Burkinabe also migrated to Ghana, Mali, and Senegal for work between the world wars. Burkina Faso attracts migrants from Cote dâIvoire, Ghana, and Mali, who often share common ethnic backgrounds with the Burkinabe. Despite its food shortages and high poverty rate, Burkina Faso has become a destination for refugees in recent years and hosts about 33,600 Malian refugees as of October 2022.\n\n(2018)\n\nAge structure\n\n0-14 years: 41.6% (male 4,868,488/female 4,727,316)\n\n15-64 years: 55.1% (male 6,116,674/female 6,590,775)\n\n65 years and over: 3.2% (2024 est.)

Burkina Faso is currently considered a high risk to travelers for circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPV); vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) is a strain of the weakened poliovirus that was initially included in oral polio vaccine (OPV) and that has changed over time and behaves more like the wild or naturally occurring virus; this means it can be spread more easily to people who are unvaccinated against polio and who come in contact with the stool or respiratory secretions, such as from a sneeze, of an âinfectedâ person who received oral polio vaccine; the CDC recommends that before any international travel, anyone unvaccinated, incompletely vaccinated, or with an unknown polio vaccination status should complete the routine polio vaccine series; before travel to any high-risk destination, the CDC recommends that adults who previously completed the full, routine polio vaccine series receive a single, lifetime booster dose of polio vaccine\n\nObesity - adult prevalence rate\n\n5.6% (2016)\n\ncomparison ranking : 175\n\nAlcohol consumption per capita\n\ntotal: 7.28 liters of pure alcohol (2019 est.)\n\nbeer: 1 liters of pure alcohol (2019 est.)\n\nwine: 0.08 liters of pure alcohol (2019 est.)\n\nspirits: 0.31 liters of pure alcohol (2019 est.)\n\nother alcohols: 5.88 liters of pure alcohol (2019 est.)\n\ncomparison ranking : total 57\n\nTobacco use\n\ntotal: 14.3% (2020 est.)\n\nmale: 22.1% (2020 est.)\n\nfemale: 6.4% (2020 est.)\n\ncomparison ranking : total 108\n\nChildren under the age of 5 years underweight\n\n17.5% (2021)\n\ncomparison ranking : 27\n\nCurrently married women (ages 15-49)\n\n73.5% (2023)\n\nEducation expenditures\n\n5.5% of GDP (2020 est.)\n\ncomparison ranking : 58\n\nLiteracy\n\ndefinition: age 15 and over can read and write\n\ntotal population: 46%\n\nmale: 54.5%\n\nfemale: 37.8% (2021)\n\nSchool life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)\n\ntotal: 9 years\n\nmale: 9 years\n\nfemale: 9 years (2020)\n\nEnvironment\n\nEnvironment - current issues\n\nrecent droughts and desertification severely affecting agricultural activities, population distribution, and the economy;

an IXP completed in September 2020 increased international bandwidth capacity by a third, while in mid-2021 the government was able to start the second phase of a national fiber backbone project; this will link the capital city to an addition 145 municipalities, and provide additional connectivity to terrestrial cables in neighboring countries; the activities of the militants in side areas of the country jeopardize overall security, and render it difficult for the telcos to safeguard their networks and equipment; Burkina Faso joins G5 Sahel countries to eliminate roaming fees (2022)\n\ndomestic: fixed-line connections stand at less than 1 per 100 persons;

aka National Armed Forces (FAN), aka Defense and Security Forces (Forces de DÃ©fense et de SÃ©curitÃ© or FDS)): Army of Burkina Faso (LâArmee de Terre, LAT), Air Force of Burkina Faso (Force Aerienne de Burkina Faso), National Gendarmerie, National Fire Brigade (Brigade Nationale de Sapeurs-Pompiers or BNSP); Homeland Defense Volunteers (ForcÃ©s de Volontaires de DÃ©fense pour la Patrie or VDP)\n\nMinistry of Territorial Administration, Decentralization and Security (MinistÃ¨re de l'Administration Territoriale, de la DÃ©centralisation et de la SÃ©curitÃ©): National Police (2024)\n\nnote 1: the National Gendarmerie officially reports to the Ministry of Defense, but usually operates in support of the Ministry of Territorial Administration, Decentralization, and Security; Gendarmerie troops are typically integrated with Army forces in anti-terrorism operations; specialized counterterrorism units include the Army's special forces, the Special Legion of the National Gendarmerie, and the Multipurpose Intervention Unit of National Police\n\nnote 2: the VDP is a lightly-armed civilian defense/militia force established in 2019 to act as auxiliaries to the Army in the fight against militants; the volunteers receive two weeks of training and typically assist with carrying out surveillance, information-gathering, and escort duties, as well as local defense, and were to be based in each of the country's more than 300 municipalities; in 2022, the military government created a \"Patriotic Watch and Defense Brigade\" (La Brigade de Veille et de DÃ©fense Patriotique or BVDP) under the FABF to coordinate the VDP recruits\n\nMilitary expenditures\n\n4% of GDP (2023 est.)\n\n2.9% of GDP (2022 est.)\n\n2.4% of GDP (2021 est.)\n\n2.4% of GDP (2020 est.)\n\n2.2% of GDP (2019 est.)\n\ncomparison ranking : 17\n\nMilitary and security service personnel strengths\n\napproximately 15,500 personnel (10,000 Army; 500 Air Force; 5,000 National Gendarmerie) (2023)\n\nnote: in 2022, government authorities announced a special recruitment for up to 6,000 additional soldiers and 1,500 gendarmes to assist with its fight against terrorist groups operating in the country; the government also put out a recruitment call for up to 100,000 VDP volunteers, and as of 2023 claimed about 50,000 had volunteered (the VDP's original recruited strength was 15,000)\n\nMilitary equipment inventories and acquisitions\n\nthe FABF has a mix of older, secondhand, and some modern equipment from a variety of suppliers, including China, Egypt, France, Russia, South Africa, Turkey, the UK, and the US (2024)\n\nMilitary service age and obligation\n\n18-26 years of age for voluntary military service for men and women (2023)\n\nnote: the military government implemented an emergency law in 2023 that allows the president extensive powers to combat terrorist groups operating in the country, including conscripting citizens into the security services\n\nMilitary - note\n\nthe FABF has a history of interference in the countryâs politics, having conducted eight coups since its formation in 1960-61, including the most recent in September of 2022; several combat units were disbanded in 2011 following mutinies; while the FABF is responsible for external defense, it has an internal security role and can be called out to assist internal security forces in restoring public order, combating crime, securing the border, and counterterrorism; indeed, for more than a decade, its focus has largely been counterterrorism and counterinsurgency operations, and it is actively engaged in combat operations against terrorist groups affiliated with al-Qa'ida and the Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham (ISIS), particularly in the northern and eastern regions; the FABF is struggling to contain the groups, however, and a large portion of the countryâ40% by some estimatesâis not under government control\n\nin the north, Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), a coalition of al-Qa'ida linked militant groups that act as al-Qa'ida in the Land of the Islamic Magreb's (AQIM) arm in the Sahel, has exploited ethnic tensions and perceptions of state neglect, as well as grievances over corruption, patronage politics, social stratification, and land disputes; in 2023, JNIM was active in 11 of the country's 13 provinces; the ISIS-Greater Sahara (ISIS-GS) terrorist group operates in the eastern part of the country (2024)\n\nTerrorism\n\nTerrorist group(s)\n\nTerrorist group(s): Ansarul Islam;
