        "text": "Background Despite snakebite antivenom being included on the WHO list of essential medicines, many parts of the world, especially Africa, lack effective and safe antivenoms. Methods A descriptive, field-based, cross-sectional study was undertaken from August to November 2020 in 40 out of 71 health facilities in Ndola district. Interviews and physical inspection were conducted at each facility. Results The study revealed that only three (8%) of all the private health facilities had antivenom available at the time of the assessment. Factors significantly associated with antivenom supply included lack of central country supply (90%), lack of demand of the antivenom (55%) and no budget allocation for the antivenom (95%). Conclusions Despite the high number of notified snakebites within Ndola district, there remains poor availability of snakebite antivenom within the district.\n\nBackground Snakebite has become better recognized as a significant cause of death and disability in Sub-Saharan Africa, but the health economic consequences to victims and health infrastructures serving them remain poorly understood. This information gap is important as it provides an evidence-base guiding national and international health policy decision making on the most cost-effective interventions to better manage snakebite. Here, we assessed hospital-based data to estimate the health economic burden of snakebite in three regions of Burkina Faso (Centre-Ouest, Hauts Bassins and Sud-Ouest). Methodology Primary data of snakebite victims admitted to regional and district health facilities (eg, number of admissions, mortality, hospital bed days occupied) was collected in three regions over 17 months in 2013/14. The health burden of snakebite was assessed using Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) calculations based upon hospitalisation, mortality and disability data from admitted...\n\nSnakebite envenomation is a global health issue that poses significant challenges in its treatment and management. This review aims to provide an overview of the global problems faced in the treatment of snakebite envenomation and the existing strategies to address them. Snakebite envenomation affects millions of people worldwide, particularly in rural and tropical regions. The lack of access to timely and appropriate medical care, including antivenom therapy, remains a major obstacle in many affected areas. Inadequate healthcare infrastructure, limited availability of antivenoms, and high treatment costs contribute to the burden of snakebite envenomation. The diversity of venomous snake species and the variations in venom composition pose challenges in the development of effective antivenoms. Issues related to antivenom production, quality control, and distribution further complicate the treatment landscape. To tackle these challenges, various approaches such as improving antivenom accessibility, developing novel antivenom formulations, promoting public awareness, and strengthening healthcare systems have been proposed and implemented. Collaborative efforts between researchers, healthcare providers, policymakers, and communities are crucial in addressing the global problems associated with snakebite envenomation. Snakebite envenomation remains a significant global health concern. Continued research, innovation, and collaborative efforts are essential to improving the prevention, treatment, and management of snakebite envenomation and reducing its impact on affected communities worldwide."
