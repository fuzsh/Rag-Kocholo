        "text": "Overview\n\nBurkina Faso is a landlocked country in West Africa bordered by Mali, Niger, Benin, Togo, Ghana, and Côte d'Ivoire. Formerly known as the Republic of Upper Volta, it was renamed “Burkina Faso” on August 4, 1984, by President Thomas Sankara. Burkina Faso means “Land of the Upright People”. The name was chosen to reflect the 2 major languages spoken in the country. “Burkina” means “men of integrity” in the Moré language and “Faso” means “father's house” in the Dioula language. It is one of the poorest countries in the world with few natural resources. The population of Burkina Faso is 14,326,203 and literacy is 21.8%, which is the lowest in Africa. French is the official language, but is not widely-spoken. Ninety percent of the people of Burkina Faso speak languages from the Sudanic language family.\n\nInhabitants of present-day Burkina Faso can be traced back to hunter-gatherers who arrived in about 12,000 BC. In 1896, the area became a French protectorate and gained independence in 1960.\n\nEducation\n\nEducation is compulsory from ages 6 to 16, but only 40% of primary school age children are enrolled and only 9.2% of secondary school age children are enrolled.
