        "text": "This page provides an overview of the key characteristics of Burkina Faso along its likely (or Current Path) development trajectory. The Current Path forecast from the International Futures forecasting (IFs) platform is a dynamic scenario that imitates continuing current policies and environmental conditions. The Current Path is, therefore, in congruence with historical patterns and produces a series of dynamic forecasts endogenised in relationships across crucial global systems. We use 2019 as a standard reference year, and the estimates generally extend to 2043 to coincide with the end of the third ten-year implementation plan of the African Union’s Agenda 2063 long-term development vision.\n\nBurkina Faso is a landlocked country in West Africa with a land area of 274 200 km2. It lies between the Sahara desert and the Gulf of Guinea, south of the loop of the Niger River. Burkina Faso borders Mali to the northwest, Niger to the northeast, Benin to the southeast, Togo and Ghana to the south, and Côte d’Ivoire to the southwest.\n\nIn 2019, Burkina Faso had a population of about 20.3 million, making it the fifth-largest country in West Africa. Its capital and largest city is Ouagadougou, with an estimated population of 2.5 million in 2019. The country’s economy is based primarily on subsistence farming and livestock raising. Highly variable rainfall, poor soil, and the lack of adequate communications and other infrastructure are longstanding problems.\n\nIn 1896, Burkina Faso was colonised by the French as part of French West Africa and gained independence in 1960. The country’s post-colonial history was characterised by several coups (in 1966, 1980, 1982, 1983, 1987) and coup attempts (in 1989, 2015, and recently in 2022). Thomas Sankara ruled the country from 1982 until he was killed in the 1987 coup led by Blaise Compaoré, who became president and ruled until his removal on 31 October 2014. On 23 January 2022, a military coup led by Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba ousted then president Kaboré. On 31 January 2022, the military junta restored the constitution and appointed Damiba president. However, in September 2022, military leaders headed by Captain Ibrahim Traoure seized power, vowing to improve security after years of attacks by groups affiliated with al-Qaida and Islamic State groups. Subsequently, relations with France deteriorated, and the country left the G5 anti-jihadi force created by several countries in the Sahel and ECOWAS to join the Alliance for Sahel States (AES). Constitutionally, Burkina Faso is governed as a semi-presidential republic with executive, legislative and judicial powers.\n\nAccording to the World Bank’s income classification, Burkina Faso is a low-income country. The country is a member of the United Nations, the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and the Community of Sahel-Saharan States. Burkina Faso was suspended from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the African Union after the 2022 military coup and subsequently announced that it would establish a confederation with Mali and Niger.\n\nBurkina Faso has a young and fast-growing population. Coming from a baseline of about 8.8 million people in 1990, by 2019 its population had more than doubled to 20.3 million people. Over the coming two decades, the country’s population is expected to grow significantly and reach 37.31 million people by 2043. In 2019, the population growth rate stood at 2.85% — the seventh highest in West Africa, although significantly lower than neighbouring Niger’s or Mali’s at about 3.9%. Population growth in Burkina Faso is driven by natural population growth. In other words, births are outstripping deaths.\n\nBurkina Faso’s population is young. In 2019, 44.2% of it was younger than 15 years old. The country’s median age is 17.5 years which is roughly in line with the average median age of 17.9 years for the group of Africa’s low-income economies. On the Current Path, Burkina Faso’s demographic structure is expected to change only slowly. Historically, the country’s fertility rate has been high. In 2019, it stood at an average of 5.2 births per woman, among the highest globally and above the average of 4.96 for its low-income peer group. By 2043, Burkina Faso’s fertility rate is expected to drop to 3.5 births per woman. As a consequence, the median age is projected to increase to 21.8 years, still the 14th lowest globally and the tenth lowest among Africa’s 23 low-income economies.\n\nIn 2019, the country’s average life expectancy was 62.3 years. On average, women reach 63.6 and men 62.3 years of age. The country’s low life expectancy stems from a high disease burden, driven to a large extent by low access to safe water and improved sanitation. With a death rate of 4.7 deaths per 1 000 people, Burkina Faso’s communicable-disease burden is higher than the average rate of its income peer group which stands at 4.1.\n\nOn the Current Path and over the coming two decades, the average citizen of Burkina Faso can expect to add close to 8 years to their life expectancy and live to 70.3 years — just slightly less than the average 70.8 years for Africa’s low-income economies. A higher life expectancy would be a boost to Burkina Faso’s workforce. By 2043, the country’s working-age population is expected to account for about 60% of the population compared to 53.3 in 2019. Indeed, the ratio of people of working age relative to the dependant population is improving but not fast enough.\n\nBurkina Faso’s population of about 20.3 million people is concentrated in the south-west and the centre of the country. At 0.741 people per hectare, overall population density is high compared to the average for Africa and Africa’s low-income countries. The high densities in the centre and south-east areas paired with difficult economic conditions as well as frequent droughts cause significant migratory flows to Ivory Coast and Ghana for seasonal agricultural work.\n\nBurkina Faso’s capital and largest city is Ouagadougou, which is located on the central plateau, followed by Bobo Dioulasso in the west. Bobo Dioulasso used to be the economic and business capital of the country before the railroad to the port of Abidjan in Côte d’Ivoire was extended to Ouagadougou. Burkina Faso is divided into 13 administrative regions that are administered by one governor each. The regions include 45 provinces and 301 departments.\n\nBurkina Faso’s people belong to two major West African cultural groups: the Gur (Voltaic) and the Mandé. The Voltaic are in the majority and include the Mossi, who make up about 50% of the population.\n\nThe IFs platform uses data from the Global Trade and Analysis Project (GTAP) to classify economic activity into six sectors: agriculture, energy, materials (including mining), manufacturing, service and information and communication technologies (ICT). Most other sources use a threefold distinction between only agriculture, industry and services with the result that data may differ.\n\nIn 2019, Burkina Faso’s service sector accounted for half of the country’s GDP, followed by the agriculture sector, which represented about 26.2%. In the future, the service sector is expected to remain the most important contributor to Burkina Faso’s GDP — its share is set to grow to 56.3% by 2043. At the same time, the contribution of the agriculture sector is forecast to shrink to 9.4%. The manufacturing sector, on the other hand, at 14.54%, currently the third largest contributor to Burkina Faso’s GDP, is forecast to increase by more than 8 percentage points to 22.9% in 2043.\n\nBurkina Faso’s expected trajectory roughly mirrors that of its low-income peers with the service sector representing both the current and future lion’s share of contribution to GDP, followed by agriculture and manufacturing sectors, which are respectively expected to lose and gain ground. This growth in the secondary sectors indicates a transition of the economy that could open up more employment opportunities.\n\nThe data on agricultural production and demand in the IFs forecasting platform initialises from data provided on food balances by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). IFs contains data on numerous types of agriculture but aggregates its forecast into crops, meat and fish, presented in million metric tons. Chart 9 shows agricultural production and demand as a total of all three categories.\n\nAt 2.1 million metric tons per hectare in 2019, Burkina Faso’s crop yield is lower than the average of Africa’s low-income economies that stood at 2.7 million metric tons per hectare. Rwanda, the frontrunner in this category, has a crop yield of 8.3 million metric tons per hectare, followed by Malawi with a yield of 7.2 million metric tons per hectare. By 2043, Burkina Faso’s crop yield is expected to increase to 2.7 million metric tons per hectare.\n\nThe lion’s share of Burkina Faso’s agricultural output is crops — mainly subsistence foodstuffs, with the surplus being sold as cash crops. Surplus cotton, shea nuts, sesame and sugarcane are exported, while sorghum, millet, corn (maize), peanuts (groundnuts) and rice are grown for local consumption. In 2019, the country’s crop production amounted to about 11.9 million metric tons compared to the average output of 13.8 million metric tons of its low-income peer group. This gap is projected to widen by 2043 with Burkina Faso expected to increase its output to 15.5 million metric tons versus the group’s average output reaching 20.05 million metric tons.\n\nMore importantly, already at present, Burkina Faso’s agricultural production does not meet demand. In 2019, the gap between production and demand amounted to almost 1 million (0.96) metric tons. By 2043, this gap is expected to be more than 10 times as big standing at 9.92 million metric tons. Fast population growth is rapidly fuelling agricultural demand. In combination with low productivity, competition over scarce resources is resulting in insecurity, as well as environmental degradation and high exposure to climate change related risks, food insecurity is a significant growing risk.\n\nThere are numerous methodologies for and approaches to defining poverty. We measure income poverty and use GDP per capita as a proxy. In 2015, the World Bank adopted the measure of US$1.90 per person per day (in 2011 international prices), also used to measure progress towards the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 1 of eradicating extreme poverty. To account for extreme poverty in richer countries occurring at slightly higher levels of income than in poor countries, the World Bank introduced three additional poverty lines in 2017:\n\nUS$3.20 for lower middle-income countries\n\nUS$5.50 for upper middle-income countries\n\nUS$22.70 for high-income countries.\n\nAs a low-income country, Burkina Faso uses the US$1.90 benchmark to define extreme poverty. The country’s poverty burden is high. In 2019, 37% of the population, which corresponds to 7.5 million people, was living below the poverty line. However, Burkina Faso’s poverty rate lies more than 10 percentage points below the average of its low-income African peers at 47.75%.\n\nIn 2019, Burkina Faso had the fifth lowest poverty rate among Africa’s low-income economies. The COVID-19 pandemic impacted food prices and worsened living conditions resulting in a significant increase in poverty. By 2043, in the Current Path forecast the country's position is expected to drop by 5 ranks. The number of people living in extreme poverty will increase to 7.71 million people by 2043, owing to the large population increase forecast for Burkina Faso.\n\nThe country’s poverty rate is projected to decline to 20.7% by 2043 — a solid reduction by about 16.3%, although a bit slower than the average rate of reduction in Africa’s low-income economies which will be 22.6%.\n\nThe IFs platform forecasts six types of energy, namely oil, gas, coal, hydro, nuclear and other renewables. To allow comparisons between different types of energy, the data is converted into billion barrels of oil equivalent (BBOE). The energy contained in a barrel of oil is approximately 5.8 million British thermal units (MBTUs) or 1 700 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of energy.\n\nIn 2019, Burkina Faso’s total energy production was 13 million barrels of oil equivalent. By 2043, it is estimated to increase to 20 million barrels. The country’s current energy mix is heavily reliant on gas, which accounted for over 80% of total production in 2019, followed by hydro at 10% and other renewables at 7%.\n\nThe Current Path forecast bodes for a gradual transition towards less gas and more renewables in Burkina Faso’s energy mix in the future. Hydro is set to remain more or less stable. By 2043, other renewables are expected to account for 78% of total energy production. Gas is set to drop to represent 15% of total production with the share of hydro accounting for about 6%. The anticipated share of other renewables in Burkina Faso’s energy production profile by far exceeds the average of 39% that is expected for Africa’s low-income economies. This can be explained by Burkina Faso’s significant renewable energy resources (mostly solar and wind) that can be exploited to power the growing economy.\n\nThe Stability scenario represents reasonable but ambitious reductions in risk of regime instability and lower levels of internal conflict. Stability is generally a prerequisite for other aspects of development and this would encourage inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) and improve business confidence. Better governance through the accountability that follows substantive democracy is modelled separately.\n\nThe intervention is explained here in the thematic part of the website.\n\nThe Stability scenario reflects significant interventions, including increasing regime stability, lowering levels of internal conflict, improving gender empowerment and addressing high levels of corruption, all of which can benefit the country substantially.\n\nIn 2019, Burkina Faso scored 0.72 on the governance security index — higher than the average score of 0.641 for its low-income peer group but still a reflection of the country’s underperformance. With a score of 0.76, Rwanda is the group’s best performer. The broader Sahel crisis has been destabilising Burkina Faso for more than a decade. The country has been severely affected by the rise of Islamist terror with several militias, partly allied with Islamic State or al-Qaeda, operating across the borders to Mali and Niger. According to the UN, the number of internally displaced people rose to over 1.5 million in 2021, a 50% increase compared to the 2020.\n\nSimilar to its neighbours Mali and Niger, Burkina Faso faces several security challenges. These include the Boko Haram insurgency in the Lake Chad Basin, the Sahelian insurgency led by The Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS) in northern Tillabéri, and the al-Qaeda-affiliated Jama’at Nusrat Al Islam (JNIM) activity in south-western Tillabéri. According to an ACLED report, more recently, ‘Burkina Faso has become the epicentre of the regional conflict’ and has replaced Mali.\n\nIn the Stability scenario, governance security in Burkina Faso is projected to improve by 11% in 2043 compared to Current Path forecast. By then, its income peer group on the continent is projected to score higher.\n\nThis section presents the impact of a Demographic scenario that aims to hasten and increase the demographic dividend through reasonable but ambitious reductions in the communicable-disease burden for children under five, the maternal mortality ratio and increased access to modern contraception.\n\nThe intervention is explained here in the thematic part of the website.\n\nDemographers typically differentiate between a first, second and even a third demographic dividend. We focus here on the contribution of the size of the labour force (between 15 and 64 years of age) relative to dependants (children and the elderly) as part of the first dividend. A window of opportunity opens when the ratio of the working-age population to dependants is equal to or surpasses 1.7.\n\nIncreasing access to modern contraception will bring down Burkina Faso’s total fertility rate more quickly than on the Current Path — from 5.17 in 2019 to 2.9 births per woman in 2043 versus 3.5 births on the Current Path. In the Current Path forecast, it would take the country almost another decade to get there. A lower total fertility rate would slow down Burkina Faso’s population growth and bring about a somewhat faster change in the population age structure. The latter will result in a more favourable ratio between people of working age and dependants, especially children.\n\nIn the interventions in the Demographic scenario, Burkina Faso has the potential to accelerate its demographic transition by increasing the ratio between workers and dependants from 1.142 in 2019 to 1.7 in 2043, compared to 1.5 on the Current Path, accelerating the transition by nearly a decade. In contrast, Africa’s low-income economies would on average get there by 2042 already (from 1.53 in 2019 to 1.74 in 2043).\n\nThis section presents reasonable but ambitious improvements in the Health/WaSH scenario, which include reductions in the mortality rate associated with both communicable diseases (e.g. AIDS, diarrhoea, malaria and respiratory infections) and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) (e.g. diabetes), as well as improvements in access to safe water and better sanitation. The acronym WaSH stands for water, sanitation and hygiene.\n\nThe intervention is explained here in the thematic part of the website.\n\nThe Health/WaSH scenario has the potential to increase life expectancy in Burkina Faso from 62.3 years in 2019 to 71.2 years in 2043 versus 70.3 years on the Current Path. The country would especially benefit from the interventions in the medium term. By 2032, the difference in the gain in life expectancy between the Current Path forecast and the Health/WaSH scenario surpasses a year. Burkina Faso performs worse on life expectancy than the average African low-income economy with a baseline of 63.8 years that is projected to increase to 70.85 years on the Current Path and to 71.4 years in the Health/WaSH scenario.\n\nThe Agriculture scenario represents reasonable but ambitious increases in yields per hectare (reflecting better management and seed and fertiliser technology), increased land under irrigation and reduced loss and waste. Where appropriate, it includes an increase in calorie consumption, reflecting the prioritisation of food self-sufficiency above food exports as a desirable policy objective.\n\nThe intervention is explained here in the thematic part of the website.\n\nThe data on yield per hectare (in metric tons) is for crops but does not distinguish between different categories of crops.\n\nIn 2019, crop yields in Burkina Faso stood at 2.1 metric tons per hectare, which is below the average of 2.7 metric tons per hectare for its low-income peers on the continent. According to the Current Path forecast, by 2043 yields in Burkina Faso will increase modestly to 2.7 metric tons per hectare — an increase of about 29%. In the Agriculture scenario, on the other hand, yields could increase by almost 150% over the same time period and amount to 5.2 metric tons per hectare.\n\nThe Education scenario represents reasonable but ambitious improved intake, transition and graduation rates from primary to tertiary levels and better quality of education. It also models substantive progress towards gender parity at all levels, additional vocational training at secondary school level and increases in the share of science and engineering graduates.\n\nThe intervention is explained here in the thematic part of the website.\n\nWith a mean of 3.7 years of education among the adult population in 2019, Burkina Faso’s educational outcomes are very poor; and at 3 years, educational outcomes for girls are even worse. Boys have a score of 4.3. The Education scenario has the potential to increase Burkina Faso’s mean years of education to 5.7 years by 2043. This represents an improvement of 0.4 years compared to the Current Path forecast of 5.3 years in 2043. Female education outcomes would still lag behind those for males (5.9 years versus 5.5 years, respectively). Globally, Burkina Faso ranks fifth lowest in terms of educational performance measured in mean years of education. Only Niger, Mali, Chad and Mozambique have even worse educational outcomes. The mean for the African low-income group is 4.4 years of education in 2019. By 2043, this will increase to 6.1 years on the Current Path and to 6.6 years in the Education scenario.\n\nThe Manufacturing/Transfers scenario represents reasonable but ambitious manufacturing growth through greater investment in the economy, investments in research and development, and promotion of the export of manufactured goods. It is accompanied by an increase in welfare transfers (social grants) to moderate the initial increases in inequality that are typically associated with a manufacturing transition. To this end, the scenario improves tax administration and increases government revenues.\n\nThe intervention is explained here in the thematic part of the website.\n\nChart 30 should be read with Chart 8 that presents a stacked area graph on the contribution to GDP and size, in billion US$, of the Current Path economy for each of the sectors.\n\nIn the Manufacturing/Transfers scenario, the service sector will experience the largest gain by far in terms of its relative contribution to GDP. Its contribution is expected to have increased by 0.6 percentage points in 2043. The service sector is followed by ICT that is projected to see its relative contribution to GDP increase by 0.1 percentage points in 2043. The ICT sector is followed by materials and manufacturing that both see smaller gains of 0.06 percentage points and 0.04 percentage points, respectively. It needs to be noted that the trend for both the relative contribution of the manufacturing and service sectors to GDP is not linear. The manufacturing sector peaks in 2035 when it is expected to add 0.7 percentage points in terms of its relative contribution to GDP compared to the Current Path forecast. The contribution of the service sector only starts picking up from about 2036 onwards.\n\nThe value of the service sector is forecast to increase by US$4.5 billion in the Manufacturing/Transfers scenario compared to the Current Path forecast. The Manufacturing/Transfers scenario has the potential for the manufacturing sector to contribute US$1.6 billion more to the economy by 2043 compared to the Current Path. The ICT sector is expected to contribute an additional US$0.5 million in this scenario, followed by materials at US$0.4 million.\n\nThe Leapfrogging scenario represents a reasonable but ambitious adoption of and investment in renewable energy technologies, resulting in better access to electricity in urban and rural areas. The scenario includes accelerated access to mobile and fixed broadband and the adoption of modern technology that improves government efficiency and allows for the more rapid formalisation of the informal sector.\n\nThe intervention is explained here in the thematic part of the website.\n\nFixed broadband includes cable modem Internet connections, DSL Internet connections of at least 256 KB/s, fibre and other fixed broadband technology connections (such as satellite broadband Internet, ethernet local area networks, fixed-wireless access, wireless local area networks, WiMAX, etc.).\n\nIn 2019, Burkina Faso, like most African low-income economies, had a low fixed broadband rate of 3.8 subscriptions per 100 people. In the Leapfrogging scenario, by 2043, fixed broadband is set to increase to 50 subscriptions per 100 people versus 31.5 on the Current Path. Regarding fixed broadband subscriptions, Burkina Faso performs above average compared to its income peer group on the continent. The latter recorded an average of 2.3 subscriptions in 2019 — a rate that by 2043 could increase to 48.3 in the Leapfrogging scenario or to 29 in the Current Path forecast.\n\nThe Free Trade scenario represents the impact of the full implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) by 2034 through increases in exports, improved productivity and increased trade and economic freedom.\n\nThe intervention is explained here in the thematic part of the website.\n\nThe trade balance is the difference between the value of a country's exports and its imports. A country that imports more goods and services than it exports in terms of value has a trade deficit, while a country that exports more goods and services than it imports has a trade surplus.\n\nIn 2019, Burkina Faso had a trade deficit that accounted for 9.7% of GDP. In the Free Trade scenario, the country’s trade balance is set to improve with the deficit accounting for 3.5% of GDP by 2037 before it starts growing again, arriving at a deficit of 6.2% in 2043 versus 3.5% in the Current Path forecast. Essentially, Burkina Faso is expected to have a negative trade balance by 2043, but in the Free Trade scenario the deficit would be higher than in the Current Path. However, the implementation of the AfCFTA in the Free Trade scenario would improve the short- and medium-term trade deficit for Burkina Faso compared to the Current Path forecast.\n\nThe Financial Flows scenario represents a reasonable but ambitious increase in worker remittances and aid flows to poor countries, and an increase in the stock of foreign direct investment (FDI) and additional portfolio investment inflows to middle-income countries. We also reduced outward financial flows to emulate a reduction in illicit financial outflows.\n\nThe intervention is explained here in the thematic part of the website.\n\nAt 8.9% of GDP in 2019, foreign aid played a slightly more important role for Burkina Faso’s GDP than for the average African country where aid accounted for 2.4%. In both the Current Path forecast and the Financial Flows scenario, the contribution of foreign aid to the economy is projected to decline significantly by 2043, dropping to 5.3% of GDP in the Financial Flows scenario and to 4.7% in the Current Path. In Africa, aid will account for on average 1.2% of GDP in the Current Path forecast and 1.3% in the Financial Flows scenario.\n\nThe Infrastructure scenario represents a reasonable but ambitious increase in infrastructure spending across Africa, focusing on basic infrastructure (roads, water, sanitation, electricity access and ICT) in low-income countries and increasing emphasis on advanced infrastructure (such as ports, airports, railway and electricity generation) in higher-income countries.\n\nNote that health and sanitation infrastructure is included as part of the Health/WaSH scenario and that ICT infrastructure and more rapid uptake of renewables are part of the Leapfrogging scenario. The interventions there push directly on outcomes, whereas those modelled in this scenario increase infrastructure spending, indirectly boosting other forms of infrastructure, including those supporting health, sanitation and ICT.\n\nThe intervention is explained here in the thematic part of the website.\n\nIn 2019, only 5.1 million people in Burkina Faso had access to electricity, accounting for about 25.3% of the population. In urban areas, access rates were almost seven times as high, reaching 63.8%. The interventions in the Infrastructure scenario have the potential to increase Burkina Faso’s overall electricity access rate to 70.8% by 2043 compared to 59.3% on the Current Path. This means that 4.3 million more people could benefit from access to electricity by 2043 (26.45 million versus 22.13 million).\n\nRural areas would benefit more from the interventions in the Infrastructure scenario than urban areas because they come from such a low baseline. Access rates in rural areas would increase from 9.5% to 58.8% by 2043 compared to 42.5% on the Current Path. In urban areas, the Infrastructure scenario accounts for an additional improvement of about 5 percentage points pushing the expected access rate to 87.2%.\n\nThe Combined Agenda 2063 scenario consists of the combination of all 11 sectoral scenarios presented above, namely the Stability, Demographic, Health/WaSH, Agriculture, Education, Manufacturing/Transfers, Leapfrogging, Free Trade, Financial Flows, Infrastructure and Governance scenarios. The cumulative impact of better education, health, infrastructure, etc. means that countries get an additional benefit in the integrated IFs forecasting platform that we refer to as the synergistic effect. Chart 55 presents the contribution of each of these 12 components to GDP per capita in the Combined Agenda 2063 scenario as a stacked area graph.\n\nThe synergistic effect of implementing improvements across all 11 sectors could increase Burkina Faso’s GDP per capita by an additional US$275.8. Among the sectoral interventions, the Agriculture scenario is projected to have the greatest impact on GDP per capita, leading to an increase of US$456.7 by 2043. The second and third largest impact on GDP per capita could be achieved in the Free Trade and the Leapfrogging scenarios, followed by the Infrastructure scenario: additions to GDP per capita of US$379.3, US$346.6 and US$244, respectively. The interventions in the Manufacturing/Transfers scenario would account for an increase of US$225.6, and the Stability scenario could result in a benefit of US$141.7. The Education, Demographic and the Health/WaSH scenarios would have the smallest impact on GDP per capita.\n\nSee Chart 8 to view the Current Path forecast of the sectoral composition of the economy.\n\nThe evolution of the various sectors in terms of their relative contribution to GDP does not follow a linear trajectory. In the Combined Agenda 2063 scenario and looking at 2043, the manufacturing sector will experience the greatest increase in terms of its relative contribution to Burkina Faso’s GDP compared to the Current Path — an additional 3.2 percentage points in 2043. This translates to an increase in GDP of USD$22.5. However, over the entire time period, the manufacturing sector loses in importance before it gains; it is only from 2033 onwards that its relative contribution starts growing very significantly.\n\nAgriculture, on the other hand, follows the reverse trajectory. Its relative contribution to GDP and therefore importance to the economy (compared to the Current Path) increases rapidly from 2019 onwards until about 2025 when it reaches a plateau that lasts for several years. In 2033, the percentage point increase in terms of added value comes to 1.6. By 2043, it is -1, meaning that the relative contribution of agriculture to the economy has become smaller compared to the Current Path. In absolute terms, agriculture would contribute US$5.7 billion more in the Combined Agenda 2063 than in the Current Path.\n\nThe boost for services via the Combined Agenda 2063 interventions is most pronounced in 2035 when the difference in percentage points compared to the Current Path is 1.2, the equivalent of an additional US$14.7 billion compared to the Current Path. ICT is also projected to increase its relative contribution to GDP compared to the Current Path adding up to 0.3 percentage points in 2043 translating to US$4.6 billion."
