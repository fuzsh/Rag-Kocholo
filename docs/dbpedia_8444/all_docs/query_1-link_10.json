        "text": "Demographic trends\n\ninBurkina Faso inPeople\n\nBurkina Faso’s yearly population growth rate is more than double the world average. More than two-fifths of the population is younger than age 15. Average life expectancy is just above 60 years—lower than the global average but similar to that of neighbouring countries.\n\nEconomy\n\nAudio File: National anthem of Burkina Faso\n\nHead Of Government:\n\nPrime Minister: Apollinaire Joachim Kyélem de Tambèla1\n\nPopulation:\n\n(2024 est.) 23,409,000\n\nHead Of State:\n\nPresident: Capt. Ibrahim Traoré (transitional)2\n\nForm Of Government:\n\ntransitional military regime1\n\nAbout nine-tenths of the population is engaged in subsistence agriculture or livestock raising. Difficult economic conditions, made worse by severe intermittent droughts, have provoked considerable migration from rural to urban areas within Burkina Faso and to neighbouring countries, most notably Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana. As many as 1.5 million people, or almost one-third of the country’s labour force, have been abroad at any given time. (In the early 21st century, however, unrest in neighbouring countries, particularly in Côte d’Ivoire, made it difficult for Burkinabés to find employment.) The development of industry in Burkina Faso is hampered by the small size of the market economy and by the absence of a direct outlet to the sea. Beginning in the late 1990s, the government began to privatize some state-owned entities in order to attract foreign investment.\n\nAgriculture\n\nRecent News\n\nAug. 16, 2024, 7:52 AM ET (Reuters)\n\nBurkina Faso conscripts magistrates for acting against junta, unions say\n\nAug. 16, 2024, 2:52 AM ET (Reuters)\n\nBurkina Faso newspaper suspends publication after reported abduction of journalist\n\nAug. 9, 2024, 3:23 AM ET (Reuters)\n\nBurkina Faso security ministry urges citizens to report on each other\n\nAug. 6, 2024, 2:54 AM ET (The Hindu)\n\nAfrican delegation explores collaboration opportunities with textile industries in Coimbatore region\n\nAug. 2, 2024, 2:33 AM ET (The Standard)\n\n35 civilians killed in double Burkina Faso attack\n\nAgricultural production consists of subsistence foodstuffs, with the surplus being sold as cash crops. Surplus cotton, shea nuts, sesame, and sugarcane are exported, while sorghum, millet, corn (maize), peanuts (groundnuts), and rice are grown for local consumption. Fonio (a crabgrass with seeds that are used as cereal), cassava (manioc), sweet potatoes, and beans are also grown. Livestock raising is one of the principal sources of revenue; animals raised include cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, donkeys, horses, camels, chickens, ducks, and guinea fowl.\n\nResources\n\nMinerals, particularly manganese and gold, are the chief sources of potential wealth for the country. There are gold mines at Poura, southwest of Koudougou, and smaller gold deposits near Sebba and Dori-Yalogo in the north exist. Reserves of nickel, bauxite, zinc, lead, and silver are also found in the country. Burkina Faso’s substantial manganese deposits at Tambao in the northeast potentially represent its most important resource and one of the world’s richest sources of this mineral. Exploitation is limited by existing transport inadequacies.\n\nManufacturing\n\nIndustry is limited to a number of plants that are mainly in the cities and larger towns. Chief manufactures include foodstuffs, beverages, textiles, shoes, and bicycle parts.\n\nFinance\n\nBurkina Faso’s currency is the CFA (Communauté Financière Africaine) franc, which has been officially pegged to the euro. It is issued by the Central Bank of West African States, an agency of the West African Economic and Monetary Union, which consists of eight countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo) that were once French colonies in Africa. Branches of the central bank in Burkina Faso are located in Ouagadougou and Bobo Dioulasso. Among the partially or wholly state-owned commercial banks, the most important is the Banque Internationale du Burkina in Ouagadougou.\n\nBurkina Faso is also a member of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), a body encompassing most states in western Africa, which attempts to integrate and harmonize the economic interests of the region. One of the poorest countries in the world, Burkina Faso relies heavily on international aid and on remittances from migrants to help offset its current account deficit.\n\nTrade\n\nBurkina Faso’s main exports in the early 21st century included cotton, gold, livestock, sugar, and fruit. Some of its exports are sent to African countries, but others, including cotton and minerals, are exported to countries such as Switzerland and Singapore.\n\nChief imports include petroleum, chemical products, machinery, and foodstuffs, which mainly come from African countries as well as from China and France. There is a deficit in the balance of payments, largely because of the relatively small amounts of exports, which are not of sufficient value to equal the value of imported materials required for promoting further development.\n\nTransportation\n\nA rail line links Ouagadougou to the port of Abidjan in Côte d’Ivoire. It is some 700 miles (1,100 km) long, of which about 320 miles (500 km) run through Burkina Faso. (For several years in the early 2000s, the line was closed because of civil war in Côte d’Ivoire). Running from east to west before crossing the border, the line serves the towns of Koudougou, Bobo Dioulasso, and Banfora.\n\nThe capital is also linked by road to the principal administrative centres in the country and to the capitals of neighbouring countries. Burkina Faso’s road networks are poorly developed, with only a small percentage of the network usable year-round. The remainder consists mostly of unpaved rural roads.\n\nInternational airports are located at Ouagadougou and Bobo Dioulasso. Numerous smaller airstrips are found throughout the country.\n\nGovernment and society\n\nConstitutional framework\n\nBurkina Faso’s constitution was adopted by referendum in 1991 and has since been amended. It allows for multiparty elections and a parliamentary republic with a president as chief of state and a prime minister, who is appointed by the president, as the head of the government. The president is elected by popular vote for a five-year term and may serve up to two consecutive terms. The legislative branch of the government is represented by the National Assembly, whose members are elected by universal suffrage for five-year terms. In 2014 popular unrest led to the dissolution of the government in October, followed by the establishment of a transitional administration in November. It was succeeded by a democratically elected government that commenced with the inauguration of a new president and a new National Assembly in late December 2015 and a new prime minister in January 2016. A military coup in January 2022 deposed the president, suspended the constitution, and dissolved the National Assembly and the government.\n\nLocal government\n\nBurkina Faso is divided into régions, which in turn are divided into provinces, which are further divided into départements. Each région is administered by a governor, and each province is administered by a high commissioner."
