        "text": "Until the end of the 19th century, the history of Burkina Faso was dominated by the empire-building Mossi. The French arrived and claimed the area in 1896, but Mossi resistance ended only with the capture of their capital, Ouagadougou in 1901. The colony of Upper Volta was established in 1919, but it was dismantled and reconstituted several times until the present borders were recognized in 1947.\n\nThe French administered the area indirectly through Mossi authorities until independence was achieved on Aug. 5, 1960. The first president, Maurice Yameogo, amended the constitution soon after taking office to ban opposition political parties. His government lasted until 1966, when the first of several military coups placed Lt. Col. Sangoule Lamizana at the head of a government of senior army officers. Lamizana remained in power throughout the 1970s, as president of military and then elected governments.\n\nRepeated military coups during the 1970s and 1980s were followed by multiparty elections in the early 1990s. In 1984, Upper Volta changed its name to Burkina Faso, meaning \"the country of honorable people.\"\n\nBurkina Faso's high population density and limited natural resources result in poor economic prospects for the majority of its citizens. Recent unrest in Cote d'Ivoire and northern Ghana has hindered the ability of several hundred thousand seasonal Burkinabé farm workers to find employment in neighboring countries.\n\nSource: The World Factbook, 2014\n\nArt\n\nBurkina Faso has more than 60 ethnic groups, each with their own social and cultural distinctions. Art made by the Mossi, Bobo and Lobi are the most famous. The Mossi are known for their antelope masks; the Bobo make large butterfly masks; and the Lobi carve wood. Burkina Faso is a leader in African art and culture and hosts the largest craft market in Africa.\n\nMusic\n\nBurkina Faso is home to 60 different ethnic groups, each with their own variety of folk music. Unlike most African countries, Burkina Faso has not yet had a popular national style. The Semaine Nationale de la Culture, held every two years since 1983, is a music festival that has helped produce the country's few stars, including Kaboré Roger, Simporé Maurice and Black So Man.\n\nThe Mande people of the southwest are known for balafon (xylophone) music, while the large, centrally located Mossi and their griots retain ancient royal courts and courtly music. The Fulbe of the north use complex vocal techniques with clapping percussion.\n\nRakiire\n\nBecause of the diversity of ethnic groups in Burkina Faso, many cultural practices are observed. One of the most important and widespread customs is Rakiire (cross-ethnic joking).\n\nLanguage\n\nFrench: Bonjour (Hello), Au revoir (Goodbye), Comment-allez vous? (How are you?), Je vais bien, merci. (I'm fine, thank you.)\n\nMossi: Yamb kibaré? (How are you?), Laafi bala, La yamba? (I'm fine, and you?)\n\nSports & Games\n\nSoccer, handball, cycling, basketball and boxing are popular in Burkina Faso.\n\nTypical Foods\n\nMost food in Burkina Faso comes with sauce. Staple foods are sorghum, millet, rice, maize, peanuts, potatoes, beans, yams and okra. Meat is not eaten often in the villages. Instead, villagers eat eggs and fish. Some fresh vegetables and fruits are available in towns.\n\nThe school week runs from Monday through Saturday. Public education is not free and many children's parents cannot afford to send them. There also is a shortage of schools in the country and even those who can afford to send their children may not be able to. According to UNICEF, only 81 percent of students reach the fifth grade.\n\nHowever, education is very important for the people of Burkina Faso; it is seen as the only vehicle out of poverty. Parents believe that education is the key to a well-paying job and therefore a better future. In Burkina Faso the educated are held in high regard. An educated child has a strong influence in the community and whatever he or she says is accepted and believed compared with a non-educated person's words. Education has strongly contributed to the well-being of the people and the nation.\n\nIn the recent past, boys had an edge over girls in their ability to obtain an education. But recently, the government policy has been to raise the rate of education for girls. There now tends to be a gender balance regarding who has access to education. Through both formal and non-formal education, all are taught to be respectful, polite, obedient, courageous and hard workers. Responsibility, family values and dignity are emphasized.\n\nThe constitution provides for freedom of religion and the government does not tolerate its abuse. Islam, Christianity and traditional indigenous religions are practiced freely without government interference. There is no official state religion and the government neither subsidizes nor favors any particular religion. The practice of a particular faith is not known to entail any advantage or disadvantage in the political arena, the civil service, the military or the private sector.\n\nThe law provides religious groups freedom of expression in their publications and broadcasts unless the judicial system determines that they are harming public order or committing slander; this has never occurred.\n\nForeign missionary groups operate freely and face no special restrictions. The government neither forbids missionaries from entering the country nor restricts their activities; however, missionary groups occasionally face complicated bureaucratic procedures in pursuit of particular activities. For example, some Christian medical missionaries have difficulty operating in the country because of a partial restriction on foreign physicians. But the restrictions are not aimed at religious groups.\n\nReligious instruction is not offered in public schools; it is limited to private schools and to the home. Muslim, Catholic and Protestant groups operate primary and secondary schools. The government monitors both the nonreligious curriculum and the qualifications of teachers employed at these schools. Unlike other private schools, religious schools pay no taxes if they do not conduct any lucrative activities. The government reviews the curriculum of such schools to ensure that religiously oriented schools offer the full standard academic curriculum.\n\nSource: International Religious Freedom Report, released in 2012 by the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor."
