        "text": "Overview\n\nUN-Habitat is committed to continue its long-standing cooperation with the government of Burkina Faso, which started in 1972. UN-Habitat’s technical assistance included support to the elaboration of urban policy, upgrading of urban settlements and environmental approaches to constructions. We are engaged in pursuing our work in partnership with the local authorities.\n\nOverview\n\nCountry: Overview\n\nPopulation (2018)\n\n29,890,567\n\nCountry: Overview\n\nTotal value of projects\n\nUS$ 50,000\n\nCountry: Overview\n\nNo. of projects (2018 - 2019)\n\nTotal: 1\n\nIn Burkina Faso, the urban population increased from 15,5% in 1996 to 31,5% in 2016. It is expected to reach 52% by 2050. Cities and towns of Burkina Faso are facing rapid sprawl, lack of planning, basic services and infrastructure, and weak governance and financial systems, among other challenges.\n\nUrban growth in Burkina Faso remains polarized in the two major cities of the country: Ouagadougou (46,4%) and Bobo-Dioulasso (15,4%), representing nearly 62% country’s urban population[1]. These cities are growing very quickly, without the necessary support measures in terms of planning, administration, infrastructure, equipment and services. This fast-paced urban growth results in sprawling and increase of informal settlements in the peri-urban areas.\n\nUrban numbers\n\nUrban Population (2018): 19.4%\n\nUrban Growth Rate (2015-2020): 4.99%\n\nThe urban population annual growth rate is 5.03%\n\nNews and Stories\n\nFeatured Stories &amp; Videos\n\nOur work\n\nFeatured Stories &amp; Videos\n\nCountry Beneficiaries\n\n‘’A team of UN-Habitat came to train us in plumbing and thanks to this project, I can handle most plumbing works and have skills such as fixing a tab or a toilet, even moving it if necessary and working on connections. I didn’t expect to have a training that kind and quality, I didn’t have anything to do, I was sitting at home all day, but thanks to this project I can handle things and be useful. It helped me a lot.’’\n\nSaadiya Zoumzara , Community Member, PSUP Plumbing Training\n\nDonors and partners\n\nThe UEMOA (Union Economique et Monétaire Ouest Africaine), is a sub-regional African organisation covering 8 countries in West Africa i.e Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d’Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Niger, Senegal and Togo. It’s headquarter is based in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. UN-Habitat and UEMOA signed a MoU (Memorandum of Understanding) in 2010 to mainstream their partnership on urban and housing thematic on the sub-region.\n\nDonors\n\nUnited Nations Office for Project Services\n\nUNEP\n\nCountry: View all news button\n\nLegacy content\n\nUN-Habitat Projects in Burkina Faso Supporting the implementation of the Urban Burkina Faso Country Programme\n\nDuration: January 2014 – 31 December 2016\n\nValue: US$977,500\n\nDonor: UNOPS - Switzerland\n\nImplementing Partners: Laboratoire Citoyennetes\n\nParticipatory Slum Upgrading Programme The Participatory Slum Upgrading Programme is being implemented with a focus on the development and adoption of inclusive policies and strategies for slum upgrading in line with the PSUP principles and contributing to the achievement of MDG 7 c and d.
