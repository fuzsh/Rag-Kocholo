The natural increase is expected to be positive, as the number of births will exceed the number of deaths by 712,969. If external migration will remain on the previous year level, the population will be declined by 34,248 due to the migration reasons. It means that the number of people who leave Burkina Faso to settle permanently in another country (emigrants) will prevail over the number of people who move into the country (to which they are not native) in order to settle there as permanent residents (immigrants).\n\nPopulation change rates in 2024\n\nAccording to our estimations, daily change rates of Burkina Faso population in 2024 will be the following:\n\n2,584 live births average per day (107.67 in an hour)\n\n631 deaths average per day (26.28 in an hour)\n\n-94 emigrants average per day (-3.91 in an hour)\n\nThe population of Burkina Faso will be increasing by 1,860 persons daily in 2024.\n\nDemographics of Burkina Faso 2023\n\nAs of 1 January 2024, the population of Burkina Faso was estimated to be 23,140,839 people. This is an increase of 2.93 % (659,381 people) compared to population of 22,481,458 the year before. In 2023 the natural increase was positive, as the number of births exceeded the number of deaths by 692,654. Due to external migration, the population declined by 33,273. The sex ratio of the total population was 0.986 (986 males per 1,000 females) which is lower than global sex ratio. The global sex ratio in the world was approximately 1,016 males to 1,000 females as of 2023.\n\nBelow are the key figures for Burkina Faso population in 2023:\n\n916,344 live births\n\n223,691 deaths\n\nNatural increase: 692,654 people\n\nNet migration: -33,273 people\n\n11,490,498 males as of 31 December 2023\n\n11,650,341 females as of 31 December 2023\n\nGrowth Rate 1952 - 2024\n\nBurkina Faso population density\n\nBurkina Faso population density is 84.5 people per square kilometer (218.7/mi2) as of August 2024. Density of population is calculated as permanently settled population of Burkina Faso divided by total area of the country. Total area is the sum of land and water areas within international boundaries and coastlines of Burkina Faso. The total area of Burkina Faso is 274,000 km2 (105,792 mi2) according to the United Nations Statistics Division .\n\nReligion in Burkina Faso\n\nReligion Number of followers Percentage of\n\ntotal population Islam14,519,31061.6 %Christianity5,303,31922.5 %Folk or traditional religions3,629,82715.4 %Religiously Unaffiliated117,8520.5 %\n\nSource: Pew Research Center. The Global Religious Landscape .\n\nNumber of followers estimated by Countrymeters (Monday, August 19 2024).\n\nBurkina Faso age structure\n\nAs of the beginning of 2024 according to our estimates Burkina Faso had the following population age distribution:\n\n45.8 51.7 2.5\n\n- percentage of population under 15 - percentage of population between 15 and 64 years old - percentage of population 65+\n\nIn absolute figures (estimate):\n\n10,606,372 young people under 15 years old ( 5,317,533 males / 5,288,839 females)\n\n11,956,177 persons between 15 and 64 years old ( 5,968,717 males / 5,987,461 females)\n\n578,290 persons above 64 years old ( 224,003 males / 354,286 females)\n\nWe prepared a simplified model of the population distribution pyramid which is broken down into 3 main age groups. The groups are the same as we used above: population under 15, between 15 and 64 and population which is over 65 year old.\n\n65+\n\n15-64\n\n0-14\n\nmale female\n\nNote: The pyramid provided is not corresponding to data given above because the age groups have different number of years.\n\nAs we can see the Burkina Faso population pyramid has an expanding type. This type of pyramid is common for developing countries with high birth and death rates. Relatively short life expectancy, as well as low level of education and poor health care are also describe such kind of population age distribution model.\n\nSource: The estimation data for section \"Burkina Faso age structure\" is based on the latest demographic and social statistics by United Nations Statistics Division .\n\nAge dependency ratio\n\nDependency ratio of population is a ratio of people who are generally not in the labor force (the dependents) to workforce of a country (the productive part of population). The dependent part includes the population under 15 years old and people aged 65 and over. The productive part of population accordingly consists of population between 15 and 64 years.\n\nThis ratio shows the pressure on productive population produced by the dependent part of population.\n\nThe total dependency ratio of population in Burkina Faso is 93.5 %.\n\nAs we can see the dependent part of population is comparable to the working part. It means that each working person in Burkina Faso must provide goods for himself and cover expenditure on one child or aged person additionally. The value of 93.5 % shows that the pressure on productive population in Burkina Faso is very high.\n\nChild dependency ratio\n\nChild dependency ratio is a ratio of people below working age (under 15) to workforce of a country.\n\nChild dependency ratio in Burkina Faso is 88.7 %.\n\nAged dependency ratio\n\nAged dependency ratio is a ratio of people above working age (65+) to workforce of a country.\n\nAged dependency ratio in Burkina Faso is 4.8 %.\n\nSource: The estimation data for section \"Burkina Faso age dependency ratio\" is based on the latest demographic and social statistics by United Nations Statistics Division .\n\nLife expectancy\n\nLife expectancy at birth is one of the most important demographic indicator. It shows the number of years a newborn infant would live assuming that birth and death rates will remain at the same level during the whole lifetime.\n\nTotal life expectancy (both sexes) at birth for Burkina Faso is 53.7 years.\n\nThis is below the average life expectancy at birth of the global population which is about 71 years (according to Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations).\n\nMale life expectancy at birth is 51.8 years.\n\nFemale life expectancy at birth is 55.7 years.\n\nLiteracy of population\n\nAccording to our estimates 4,524,060 persons or 36.09% of adult population (aged 15 years and above) in Burkina Faso are able to read and write. Accordingly about 8,010,407 adults are illiterate.\n\nLiteracy rate for adult male population is 43.03% (2,664,913 persons). 3,527,807 are illiterate.\n\nLiteracy rate for adult female population is 29.32% (1,859,147 persons). 4,482,600 are illiterate.\n\nYouth literacy rates are 47.56% and 43.24% for males and females accordingly. The overall youth literacy rate is 45.43%. Youth literacy rate definition covers the population between the ages of 15 to 24 years.\n\nSource: The estimation data for section \"Burkina Faso population literacy\" is based on the latest data published by UNESCO Institute for Statistics (retrieved March 13, 2016) .\n\nBurkina Faso population history\n\nYearPopulationGrowth Rate 19514,304,639N/A %19524,345,9320.96 %19534,390,3591.02 %19544,438,3891.09 %19554,490,3821.17 %19564,546,2081.24 %19574,605,6991.31 %19584,667,9091.35 %19594,731,9811.37 %19604,796,8651.37 %19614,862,2031.36 %19624,927,7241.35 %19634,994,3471.35 %19645,063,5451.39 %19655,137,1951.45 %19665,215,9521.53 %19675,300,0491.61 %19685,388,7841.67 %19695,481,4961.72 %19705,576,7781.74 %19715,674,3911.75 %19725,774,5541.77 %19735,878,2661.80 %19745,985,7191.83 %19756,097,7701.87 %19766,214,6191.92 %19776,336,9961.97 %19786,465,4192.03 %19796,601,8172.11 %19806,747,6602.21 %19816,904,6692.33 %19827,072,4242.43 %19837,250,3352.52 %19847,436,5952.57 %19857,630,3822.61 %19867,830,1322.62 %19878,036,2452.63 %19888,248,7872.64 %19898,468,9842.67 %19908,696,3762.68 %19918,931,5422.70 %19929,174,2732.72 %19939,425,8412.74 %19949,685,6142.76 %19959,954,3552.77 %199610,232,0802.79 %199710,520,3462.82 %199810,818,3832.83 %199911,126,9992.85 %200011,446,2122.87 %200111,777,6532.90 %200212,120,2752.91 %200312,475,3462.93 %200412,843,6272.95 %200513,227,8642.99 %200613,627,2283.02 %200714,042,3393.05 %200814,472,0733.06 %200914,917,2663.08 %201015,375,0623.07 %201115,845,5223.06 %201216,327,9203.04 %201316,824,0833.04 %201417,331,5193.02 %201517,850,4782.99 %201618,379,9472.97 %201718,922,0402.95 %201819,474,6452.92 %201920,038,7672.90 %202020,613,9202.87 %202121,218,5262.93 %202221,840,8652.93 %202322,481,4582.93 %202423,140,8392.93 %\n\nThe data is given as of 1st of January of an year."
