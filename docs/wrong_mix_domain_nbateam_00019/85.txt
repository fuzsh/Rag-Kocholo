JJ Redick, a former player and current ESPN analyst, is one of the candidates for the Los Angeles Lakers’ bench if Darvin Ham is fired.

After the Los Angeles Lakers were easily defeated by the Denver Nuggets led by Nikola Jokic in the playoffs for the second consecutive year, there have been reports that the current coach of the team, Darvin Ham, could be fired.

Although Ham has not officially been fired yet, many names have begun to emerge in the media as potential replacements for the Lakers’ bench. One of them is, somewhat surprisingly, JJ Redick.

ESPN NBA reporter Dave McMenamin appeared on the Dave Patrick Show and said: “JJ Redick certainly is a real candidate if they open up this coaching search. But there’s, I’d say, a half a dozen folks out there.”
