        "text": "Former NBA player and current ESPN color commentator JJ Redick is the front-runner for the Los Angeles Lakers' head coaching job, sources told The Athletic's Shams Charania.\n\nThe Lakers are also seriously considering New Orleans Pelicans associate head coach James Borrego, according to Charania.\n\nThe organization is in no rush to end its search process, Dan Woike of the Los Angeles Times reports.\n\nRedick was the first candidate to meet with the Lakers, doing so in early May. The two parties haven't had conversations about contract details, according to Woike. The franchise also met Borrego for a second time last week. The Lakers are reportedly interested in adding him as an assistant if they hire Redick as head coach.\n\nThe Lakers have interviewed several assistants, including Sam Cassell of the Boston Celtics, Chris Quinn of the Miami Heat, Micah Nori of the Minnesota Timberwolves, and David Adelman of the Denver Nuggets.\n\nThe franchise reportedly believes that Redick has coaching potential akin to legendary bench boss Pat Riley.\n\nRedick co-hosts the \"Mind The Game\" podcast with Lakers star LeBron James and also hosts the popular \"The Old Man and the Three\" podcast. James' agent, Rich Paul, said in May that Redick's candidacy isn't just to appease the NBA's leading scorer.\n\nThe Lakers dismissed Darvin Ham in May. He went 90-74 over two seasons with the organization and posted a 9-12 playoff record."
