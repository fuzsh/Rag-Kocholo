        "text": "Photo Jesse D. Garrabrant/NBAE via Getty Images\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers reportedly are \"zeroing in\" on former NBA player and current ESPN broadcaster JJ Redick as the \"front-runner to be the franchise's next head coach,\" according to Shams Charania of The Athletic and Stadium.\n\nPer that report, \"No final decision has been made yet, and the Lakers still have steps remaining in their head-coaching search process, league sources said. But the indications are strong that Redick is their leading choice at this stage.\"\n\nPer that report, the Lakers have already interviewed Boston Celtics assistant Sam Cassell, Miami Heat assistant Chris Quinn, Minnesota Timberwolves assistant Micah Nori and Denver Nuggets assistant David Adelman.\n\nBut the team has largely narrowed its search to Redick and current New Orleans Pelicans associate coach and former Charlotte Hornets head James Borrego, according to Charania.\n\nHe added that several team officials have reportedly become \"infatuated\" with Redick and that former Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski has \"become a respected unofficial resource for the Lakers during the process,\" given that he has a \"deep knowledge of candidates, such as Redick and others, [that] provides a lens into the culture the organization wants and the characteristics of a potential staff around the next head coach.\"\n\nThose characteristics reportedly include a candidate who will demand accountability within the locker room and \"tirelessly game-plan and provide a level of structure and organization,\" per Charania.\n\nRedick has never served as a head coach, bringing a lack of experience to the position, but he's quickly become a respected figure in the NBA podcasting and broadcasting space. His podcast with Lakers superstar LeBron James, the Mind the Game Pod, has fueled speculation that Redick would have the inside track for the L.A. gig given their relationship.\n\nAs a player, Redick was one of the best three-point shooters of his generation, averaging 12.8 points per game while shooting 41.5 percent from beyond the arc.\n\nOther coaches have successfully transitioned from the media space without coaching experience, most notably four-time champion Steve Kerr with the Golden State Warriors. Expecting Redick to become the next Kerr, however—one of the most decorated NBA coaches in the 21st century—is more than a little optimistic.\n\nThe Lakers are also in win-or-bust mode, given the ticking clock on James' career. Redick is walking into one of the highest-profile jobs in sports, with no experience and an expectation to win immediately. It will be a trial by fire if he's ultimately hired."
