        "text": "JJ Redick Getting Head Coaching Interest\n\nJJ Redick was a 15-year NBA vet and is an extremely smart basketball mind. He doesn't have any coaching experience at the professional level. Additionally, the move to NBA coaching would be a risk for both Redick and the franchise. Former players usually have to serve under established head coaches as assistants and get their opportunities that way. JJ would be jumping straight to the head position without any of the groundwork. Nevertheless, The Charlotte Hornets may be looking for a younger coach who's experienced with today's players to turn around their young roster. JJ might be that guy."
