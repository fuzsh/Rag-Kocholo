        "text": "The Los Angeles Lakers have confirmed the appointment of JJ Redick as head coach, as the former shooting guard enters his first coaching position.\n\nThe former Orlando Magic and LA Clippers player joins the franchise after a stint as an NBA analyst for broadcaster ESPN. Redick has no previous experience in coaching.\n\nIt was reported that the Lakers turned to Redick after failing to lure UConn Huskies coach Dan Hurley to California.\n\nOlympic Games Paris 2024\n\nLeonard withdraws from Team USA basketball ahead of Paris Olympics\n\n10/07/2024 at 15:57\n\n“We are thrilled to introduce JJ Redick as the next head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers,” Lakers vice president of basketball operations and general manager Rob Pelinka said.\n\n\"JJ is a fierce competitor and has an extraordinary basketball IQ and understanding of the modern game that will energise players and excite fans.\n\n\"His rigorous analysis will immediately unlock new opportunities for our roster while setting a foundation for player development over the long term.\"\n\nThe Lakers were ousted from this year's NBA play-offs in the first-round, falling to a 4-1 series defeat to the Denver Nuggets - prompting the dismissal of coach Darvin Ham.\n\nRedick has made clear he is joining the Lakers to win the championship, despite his inexperience.\n\n\"My motivations for doing this, it starts with the very simple foundation of service,\" Redick said in his first press conference.\n\n\"I think about the greatest moments, especially towards the end of my career was about helping players so it starts with the desire to serve players, to serve the Lakers organisation, to serve our fans.\n\n\"It's also about competition, and performance, collaboration, leadership, these are the things that drive me. They will all be important as I build out my staff, as we think about the people we want to draft and get in free agency and as we think about player development.\n\n\"When I think about the NBA today, the game is evolving, it's evolving fast and one of the things in coaching is you have to be adaptable. You have to be adaptable to your roster, in-game planning against your opponent and that's one of the things I'll strive to be.\n\n\"Lastly I want to say sitting in this seat, I know what the expectations are. Lakers have some of the most passionate fans around the world, the expectation is a championship. So it's my job, it's our staff's job, it's all of us, to deliver a championship-calibre team. That's what I signed up for.\"\n\nRedick also has a strong relationship with Lakers star LeBron James, with whom he co-hosts basketball podcast \"Mind the Game Pod\".\n\n--\n\ndiscovery+ is the streaming home of the Olympic Games, and the only place you can watch every moment of Paris 2024 this summer.\n\nNBA\n\nPaul: Wembanyama link-up 'definitely helped' in decision to join Spurs\n\n10/07/2024 at 09:45\n\nOlympic Games Paris 2024\n\nLeBron the difference as USA beat Germany in final Olympics warm-up match\n\nYesterday at 22:51"
