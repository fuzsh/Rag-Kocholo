        "text": "Andrew D. Bernstein/NBAE via Getty Images\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers are beginning an \"extensive\" head coach search to replace Darvin Ham, according to The Athletic's Shams Charania.\n\nCandidates include former Milwaukee Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer, Golden State Warriors assistant coach Kenny Atkinson and ESPN analyst JJ Redick, Charania reported.\n\nThe Lakers would also consider Los Angeles Clippers head coach Ty Lue \"if he becomes available,\" Charania reported.\n\nThe Lakers fired Ham Friday after being eliminated from the first round in five games by the Denver Nuggets. He had two years remaining in the contract he signed in 2022.\n\nHam will depart the Lakers with a 90-74 regular-season record as head coach.\n\nHis 9-12 postseason record likely contributed to his dismissal. Los Angeles was hoping for a second deep playoff run this spring after making it to the Western Conference Finals last fall.\n\nInstead, the Lakers bowed out in the first round after losing for a second straight season to the Denver Nuggets. They recorded only one win in both series combined.\n\nBefore focusing on the 2025 postseason, the Lakers will need to consider which coach is most likely to encourage LeBron James to stay in Los Angeles. He could become a free agent this offseason if he declines his $51.4 million player option for the 2024-25 season.\n\nBudenholzer led the Bucks to a title in 2021 and was named NBA Coach of the Year twice during five seasons in Milwaukee. He hasn't coached in the NBA since the Bucks fired him following their first-round exit last postseason, although he was reportedly a recent finalist in the Brooklyn Nets' head coaching search.\n\nThis isn't the first time the Lakers have considered Atkinson for the job. He was also a finalist for the position prior to Ham's hiring in 2022, according to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski. Atkinson previously coached D'Angelo Russell while leading the Brooklyn Nets from 2016 to 2020.\n\nLue's contract with the Clippers is set to expire after next season. He coached the Cleveland Cavaliers during James' tenure with the team, including their 2016 run to the NBA title.\n\nRedick has no coaching experience, but he is reportedly also a candidate for the position with the Charlotte Hornets. He also has a connection with the James, with whom the former 15-year NBA player hosts a podcast."
