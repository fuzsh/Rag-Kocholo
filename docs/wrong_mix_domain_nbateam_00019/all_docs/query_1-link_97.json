        "text": "As NBA teams continue to value the three-point shot, startups are getting into the business of bringing technology and analytics to the next generation of shooters; including shooters, currently in the NBA, who are looking for new solutions to achieve a higher shooting percentage.\n\nOne of the companies looking to capitalize in the technology-aided shooting business is RSPCT Basketball, which recently announced that prominent current NBA players Chris Paul and J.J. Redick as well as former NBA player Larry Hughes, have invested in the shot-tracking startup. RSPCT Basketball’s sensors are able to track a user’s shooting percentage using the device, as well as measure each shot’s accuracy and the full trajectory of an athlete’s shot from release point to result on the rim.\n\nThe company says their solution is already in use at all levels, from NBA teams such as the Indiana Pacers to youth academies such as now-investor Larry Hughes’ Youth Basketball Academy. It’s mission is to utilize technology to assist basketball players using the product to analyze their shooting more quickly and more efficiently, and, in turn, to make needed adjustments to their jump shot without spending days and months developing bad habits.\n\nThe way the process works is the data from the RSPCT Basketball system used the sensors attached to the backboard, combined with high-resolution cameras, to track a participant’s three-point shot. Combined with SMT’s augmented reality graphics system, this produces a deep look at the player’s shooting accuracy as well as their shooting patterns during the three-point competition.\n\nRSPCT is based in Israel and looks to bring data precision to shooting analytics in basketball. The company foresees a basketball world where every basket is a smart basket. The product tracks not only FG%, but also a shooter’s accuracy and trajectory, which provides additional insights about the player’s long-term success as a shooter. As the system collects more data (shots) from a shooter, it can provide more actionable data, knowing where a shooter’s strengths and weaknesses lie.\n\n“We’ve proven that our tech can help every basketball player and coach optimize their knowledge and talent, said Oren Moravchik, RSPCT’s founder and CEO. “With the massively talented and visionary basketball personas joining us and supporting our vision, we intend to bring that value to every backboard”.\n\nThe system was on full display during the Three-Point Contest during the 2018 NBA All-Star Weekend when RSPCT teamed up Turner broadcasting to show off the capabilities of the shot tracking system.\n\n“This system is going to give the production [team] a chance to show shot accuracy in rapid-fire succession,” said Chris Brown, senior director, technical operations, Turner Sports at the time. “We worked with RSPCT to integrate their system with SMT, and I think the [result] is going to be great for fans.”\n\nRSPCT had a popular tweet below when it showed through their technology how unlikely Kawhi Leonard's game-winning shot to beat the Philadelphia 76ers was in the NBA Playoffs this past May.\n\nJJ Redick has made a career out of shooting three-point shots and earlier this week signed a two-year, $26.5 million contract with the New Orleans Pelicans, after spending the previous two seasons in Philadelphia. In a statement he made regarding RSPCT Basketball, he said:\n\n“I’m constantly looking for ways to improve as a shooter. I believe this technology can provide an advantage in becoming a better shot maker. Every kid should shoot with this.” (RSPCT shooting system)"
