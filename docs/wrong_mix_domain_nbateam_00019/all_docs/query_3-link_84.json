        "text": "Tyler Kaufman/Associated Press\n\nNBA players are set to report in Orlando from July 7-9 for the restart of the 2019-20 season, but New Orleans Pelicans guard JJ Redick said \"there is absolutely no comfort level\" among players given the spike in coronavirus cases and ongoing social unrest, but he thinks playing is the right thing to do.\n\nThe veteran explained his thoughts in a statement to ESPN's Malika Andrews:\n\nThe eight seeding games for each team are scheduled to begin on July 30, with the Pelicans currently 3.5 games behind the No. 8 seed in the Western Conference.\n\nAs Redick noted, the restart comes amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\n\nTheLos Angeles Clippers,Denver Nuggets andBrooklyn Nets were each forced to close their team facilities at different points because of positive COVID-19 tests in the last week.\n\nAccording to theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, this week saw the highest single-day total of new coronavirus cases nationwide.\n\nThe NBA is planning to continue as scheduled, but commissioner Adam Silver told reporters June 26 the league could cancel if there is a \"significant spread\" of the disease within the NBA bubble.\n\nMeanwhile, players around the league have also been focused on the ongoing movement for racial justice following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody on May 25. Brooklyn Nets guard Kyrie Irving called on players to opt out of the restarted season to avoid taking attention away from the movement.\n\nRedick has discussed the ongoing unrest and the movement on social media and his podcast in recent weeks."
