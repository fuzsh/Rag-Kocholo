        "text": "How’s your summer? So much has been going on. We had an NBA Draft, Paul George and Klay Thompson grabbed new jerseys, we’re in the throes of summer league, and the Olympics will soon decide world supremacy in international hoops.\n\nI know what you’re thinking: What a perfect time for some updated Power Rankings! And you’re right.\n\nReminder: The Power Rankings don’t just rank 30 teams. We divide them into tiers, which teams can move in and out of. We currently have the tiers broken into six categories:\n\nCooper Flagg Positioning — The 2025 draft class is potentially loaded with star talent.\n\nAre they just filling out Play-In criteria? — They have to get to 10 teams somehow!\n\nPlay-In Tournament teams or better — They should be in the mix unless something disastrous happens.\n\nPlayoff teams — Teams that should only be happy with making the top six in their conference.\n\nOn the brink of contention — A piece away from us believing they can win the title.\n\nContenders — They are contending for the championship, barring a massive injury.\n\nAs always, I am sure we will all agree on the placement of all 30 teams, especially your favorite team.\n\nHere’s how the Power Rankings work:\n\nIt’s up to my discretion how the rankings shake out. For some teams, they’ll be hit in the short term. Others will be given the benefit for the long term. Yes, it is entirely subjective.\n\nIf I have a team ahead of another team, there’s no reason to ask why they’re ranked above the team you like. The answer is pretty simple: I think that team is set up better for success.\n\nYes, I watch the games. And yes, I watch your favorite team.\n\nThis is supposed to be fun, so let’s have fun.\n\nWith all that said, let’s dive into the summer edition of The Athletic’s NBA Power Rankings. (Last rank is based on end-of-season Power Rankings from April 16.)\n\nExpand all\n\nCollapse all\n\nLoading\n\nTry changing or resetting your filters to see more.\n\nTier 1 - The Contenders\n\n1\n\nBoston Celtics\n\n1\n\nLast Rank\n\nAdditions/re-signs: Luke Kornet, Xavier Tillman, Neemias Queta, Baylor Scheierman, Anton Watson\n\nSubtractions: None\n\nDid they get better? Not really, but the world champion Celtics don’t have to be much better. Boston locked up its core for at least the next two seasons and doled out big money to Jayson Tatum for his superstar extension. This team was the best in basketball last season and is coming off a dominant NBA Finals run. The Celtics remain the team to beat in the NBA, and the rest of the league has a lot of work to do to prove they can challenge them.\n\nBy the way, The Athletic’s commemorative book about the Celtics’ 2023-24 season is on sale now. Order a copy today. Books will ship on Aug. 2, 2024.\n\nEastern\n\nTier 1 - The Contenders\n\n2\n\nOklahoma City Thunder\n\n3\n\nLast Rank\n\nAdditions/re-signs: Isaiah Hartenstein, Alex Caruso, Isaiah Joe, Aaron Wiggins, Nikola Topić\n\nSubtractions: Josh Giddey, Lindy Waters III\n\nDid they get better? Absolutely. The additions of Caruso and Hartenstein transform this team to pretty much complete. The only things that could get in the way are health and inexperience. Yes, the Thunder got a taste of the playoffs as a group last year, and their convincing first-round sweep of New Orleans was great, but OKC showed its youth in the second round and has to apply its lessons from that. This should be the team to beat in the West. It’ll have to handle having that target on its back from here on out.\n\nWestern\n\nTier 1 - The Contenders\n\n3\n\nDallas Mavericks\n\n5\n\nLast Rank\n\nAdditions/re-signs: Melvin Ajinça, Naji Marshall, Klay Thompson, Quentin Grimes\n\nSubtractions: Josh Green, Derrick Jones Jr., Tim Hardaway Jr.\n\nDid they get better? In a word: yes. I love swapping out Jones for Marshall. Even though Thompson isn’t what he used to be, he’s still going to be a player opponents will be afraid to leave open. The Mavericks’ team defense might suffer a bit, but they’ll also have a full training camp with P.J. Washington and Daniel Gafford. I also think they pulled off the rarely successful salary dump by swapping Hardaway for Grimes, which helped them save money and get better.\n\nWestern\n\nTier 1 - The Contenders\n\n4\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves\n\n4\n\nLast Rank\n\nAdditions/re-signs: Joe Ingles, P.J. Dozier, Rob Dillingham, Luka Garza\n\nSubtractions: Kyle Anderson, Monte Morris, Jordan McLaughlin, Wendell Moore Jr.\n\nDid they get better? Not yet. I think the loss of Anderson will be significant. It’s been a few years since Ingles was super-effective on the court. If he can regain any of that magic, he’ll be a productive bench player. Dillingham (eighth overall pick) was a shrewd pickup on draft night, but this team might be too good for him to get significant time on the court. The 19-year-old lottery pick is probably a year away from being what they need.\n\nWestern\n\nTier 1 - The Contenders\n\n5\n\nDenver Nuggets\n\n2\n\nLast Rank\n\nAdditions/re-signs: DaRon Holmes, Dario Šarić\n\nSubtractions: Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Reggie Jackson\n\nDid they get better? They did not. Losing Caldwell-Pope and replacing him internally will not help. I do like the Šarić addition. He’ll help replace Jeff Green’s departure from a year ago. The Nuggets are hoping a longer offseason will have them refreshed to get back in the title hunt, but the expected financial crunch from the top has affected this roster.\n\nWestern\n\nTier 1 - The Contenders\n\nTier 2 - Brink of Contention\n\n6\n\nNew York Knicks\n\n6\n\nLast Rank\n\nAdditions/re-signs: Mikal Bridges, Pacôme Didet, Tyler Kolek, Kevin McCullar, Ariel Hukporti, OG Anunoby, Keita Bates-Diop, Cameron Payne\n\nSubtractions: Isaiah Hartenstein, Alec Burks, Bojan Bogdanović, Shake Milton, Mamadi Diakite\n\nDid they get better? Even though losing Hartenstein is big, I still think they got better with the Bridges move. If Mitchell Robinson can remain healthy (a big if), the Knicks can find a solid backup center to round out their rotation. If Robinson can’t remain healthy, then coach Tom Thibodeau has some tough decisions to make. The team chemistry will be off the charts. The Knicks can play many different styles, and their perimeter defense could be tremendous.\n\nEastern\n\nTier 2 - Brink of Contention\n\n7\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans\n\n9\n\nLast Rank\n\nAdditions/re-signs: Yves Missi, Antonio Reeves, Dejounte Murray, Daniel Theis\n\nSubtractions: Dyson Daniels, Larry Nance Jr., Naji Marshall, EJ Liddell, Jonas Valančiūnas, Cody Zeller\n\nDid they get better? I think they did, but the Pelicans still need an answer at center with the departure of Valančiūnas. I love the addition of Murray. He didn’t fix the Hawks’ defensive issues, but he will absolutely bolster an elite defense in the NBA (New Orleans ranked sixth last season). I like the Theis addition, but I’m not sure New Orleans can utilize him as its full-time center. We have to see what happens with Brandon Ingram due to the team’s perimeter logjam.\n\nWestern\n\nTier 2 - Brink of Contention\n\n8\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers\n\n13\n\nLast Rank\n\nAdditions/re-signs: Jared McCain, Paul George, Adem Bona, Kelly Oubre Jr., Eric Gordon, Andre Drummond, Caleb Martin\n\nSubtractions: Nicolas Batum, Buddy Hield, De’Anthony Melton, Mo Bamba, Paul Reed, Cameron Payne\n\nDid they get better? They absolutely got better. Depending on how you feel about Tyrese Maxey’s continued ascension, George is either Philly’s second or third star. Drummond could be massive for helping keep Joel Embiid healthy and maximized for a deep playoff run. Adding Martin was huge. But Embiid and the Sixers will still have plenty of questions to answer upon reaching the postseason … until they find their way into at least the conference finals.\n\nEastern\n\nTier 2 - Brink of Contention\n\n9\n\nMilwaukee Bucks\n\n12\n\nLast Rank\n\nAdditions/re-signs: AJ Johnson, Tyler Smith, Taurean Prince, Delon Wright\n\nSubtractions: Malik Beasley\n\nDid they get better? A little. I like the additions of Prince and Wright, though I’m not sure how much they move the team’s actual margins. Most of that will depend on how much Damian Lillard bounces back and meshes with Giannis Antetokounmpo. Khris Middleton being healthier than he’s been in recent years would also be huge. And, even though Doc Rivers wouldn’t wish taking this job on anybody, it’s on him to prove what this team can do with a full training camp.\n\nEastern\n\nTier 2 - Brink of Contention\n\nTier 3 - Playoff Teams\n\n10\n\nIndiana Pacers\n\n17\n\nLast Rank\n\nAdditions/re-signs: Johnny Furphy, Tristen Newton, Enrique Freeman, Pascal Siakam, Obi Toppin, James Wiseman\n\nSubtractions: Jalen Smith\n\nDid they get better? The Pacers are the latest team to take a chance on making the 23-year-old Wiseman a thing in the NBA. He’ll be tasked with replacing Smith in some way, but the Pacers are mostly the same team from last season. That’s not a bad thing considering they appeared in the conference finals. Indiana will try to find more defensive balance while maintaining its high-octane offense.\n\nEastern\n\nTier 3 - Playoff Teams\n\n11\n\nOrlando Magic\n\n15\n\nLast Rank\n\nAdditions/re-signs: Tristan da Silva, Gary Harris, Goga Bitadze, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Mo Wagner\n\nSubtractions: Joe Ingles\n\nDid they get better? Definitely. I’d still love for them to find a way for Tyus Jones to be their main point guard, but I love what the Magic did after a super-successful season for such a young team. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope will give a great presence on the perimeter. They still need more shot-makers, but that problem is more solvable if Franz Wagner can shoot the basketball again (career-low 28.1 percent last season, 35.9 percent clip through first two). The Magic, as is, are capable of winning 50 games next season.\n\nEastern\n\nTier 3 - Playoff Teams\n\n12\n\nPhoenix Suns\n\n8\n\nLast Rank\n\nAdditions/re-signs: Ryan Dunn, Oso Ighodaro, Mason Plumlee, Monte Morris, Bol Bol, Royce O’Neale, Damion Lee\n\nSubtractions: Drew Eubanks, Eric Gordon\n\nDid they get better? I do think the Suns are slightly better. Mason Plumlee should be an upgrade over Drew Eubanks. Monte Morris is a better fit for their backcourt needs than Eric Gordon. Ultimately, this comes down to how this team performs under new coach Mike Budenholzer. Will the stars be healthier and more accountable in championship-building tendencies? Can they get Bradley Beal to care in that way? Will Kevin Durant, who turns 36 in September, hold up physically with everything he’s asked to do? The Suns have ample talent but still so many questions.\n\nWestern\n\nTier 3 - Playoff Teams\n\n13\n\nGolden State Warriors\n\n10\n\nLast Rank\n\nAdditions/re-signs: Lindy Waters III, Buddy Hield, Kyle Anderson, De’Anthony Melton\n\nSubtractions: Chris Paul, Klay Thompson, Dario Šarić\n\nDid they get better? I actually think they did. Losing Thompson is a gut punch due to nostalgia and his place in franchise history. His replacement Hield can really shoot the ball, though. Anderson is a good defender and playmaker. Melton, when healthy, is a huge difference-maker in the backcourt. The Warriors feel a bit more balanced and reliable, as long as Draymond Green stops getting suspended.\n\nWestern\n\nTier 3 - Playoff Teams\n\n14\n\nSacramento Kings\n\n14\n\nLast Rank\n\nAdditions/re-signs: Devin Carter, Jalen McDaniels, Alex Len, Malik Monk, DeMar DeRozan, Jordan McLaughlin\n\nSubtractions: Harrison Barnes, Davion Mitchell, Chris Duarte, Sasha Vezenkov\n\nDid they get better? I love what the Kings did and do not understand the negativity surrounding the DeMar DeRozan sign-and-trade move. Sacramento absolutely got better, but its defense will remain as shaky as the prior two seasons. Carter was one of my favorite players in the draft. The Kings will be in the mix for top six in the West.\n\nWestern\n\nTier 3 - Playoff Teams\n\n15\n\nCleveland Cavaliers\n\n16\n\nLast Rank\n\nAdditions/re-signs: Jaylon Tyson\n\nSubtractions: None\n\nDid they get better? The Cavs believed coach J.B. Bickerstaff, not their roster construction, was the problem, so they replaced him with Kenny Atkinson and are hoping they can keep their defensive prowess while boosting offensive output. The Cavs’ big offseason move was signing Donovan Mitchell to his extension. Now, do they make decisions between Jarrett Allen and Evan Mobley? (The wise move is picking Mobley.) Do they move Darius Garland?\n\nEastern\n\nTier 3 - Playoff Teams\n\nTier 4 - Play-In Tournament Teams Or Better\n\n16\n\nLos Angeles Lakers\n\n11\n\nLast Rank\n\nAdditions/re-signs: Dalton Knecht, Bronny James, LeBron James, Max Christie\n\nSubtractions: Taurean Prince\n\nDid they get better? No, they haven’t, no offense to Knecht and Bronny. The Lakers seem stuck in neutral with their roster construction. They’re hoping JJ Redick replacing Darvin Ham as coach will be a massive improvement. Maintaining last season’s health would also be good. And the Lakers remain patient in thinking a significant trade will eventually materialize to boost things. For a team that needs a big man next to Anthony Davis, the Lakers seem to have failed in adding a necessary role player there. And banking on Davis and an almost 40-year-old LeBron staying as healthy as they did last season is a huge risk.\n\nWestern\n\nTier 4 - Play-In Tournament Teams Or Better\n\n17\n\nLA Clippers\n\n7\n\nLast Rank\n\nAdditions/re-signs: Cam Christie, Nicolas Batum, Kevin Porter Jr., Derrick Jones Jr., James Harden, Mo Bamba\n\nSubtractions: Paul George, Mason Plumlee, Daniel Theis\n\nDid they get better? Absolutely not. The Clippers have done an admirable job of filling in gaps due to George’s departure, bringing in Batum, Jones and Porter as replacements. The problem is those players don’t combine into one player on the court. The Clippers are already managing Kawhi Leonard’s knee after his Olympic departure. They’re hoping James Harden will be back to his old ways of carrying star-level responsibility. The Clippers are still good but are on shaky ground as they enter their new arena.\n\nWestern\n\nTier 4 - Play-In Tournament Teams Or Better\n\n18\n\nMemphis Grizzlies\n\n24\n\nLast Rank\n\nAdditions/re-signs: Zach Edey, Jaylen Wells, Cam Spencer\n\nSubtractions: None\n\nDid they get better? It depends on what you believe rookie Edey (ninth overall pick) can be at the NBA level. The Grizzlies are going to be better simply because Ja Morant will be back in action. We saw his impact on the team in his nine appearances last season before his season-ending shoulder injury (6-3 record, improved team’s net rating by 7.4 points in 318 minutes). It was a reminder of how dynamic Morant is. A healthy Grizzlies team is a playoff squad. Memphis needs a center next to Jaren Jackson Jr. on the court. It moved Steven Adams last year and will try to make Edey a thing. It could be the difference between the top six in the West and battling for the Play-In.\n\nWestern\n\nTier 4 - Play-In Tournament Teams Or Better\n\n19\n\nHouston Rockets\n\n21\n\nLast Rank\n\nAdditions/re-signs: Reed Sheppard, AJ Griffin, Aaron Holiday\n\nSubtractions: None\n\nDid they get better? Not really, but I’m not sure the Rockets needed to get better this offseason. They could still pull off a big trade with their resources. I’m not a big believer in Reed Sheppard, and I mostly think he’s a backup guard in the NBA. But this team is so loaded with talent and showed how dangerous it can be last season. Jalen Green turned the corner late in the season. Alperen Şengün is a star. The Rockets are for real by just sticking to the status quo.\n\nWestern\n\nTier 4 - Play-In Tournament Teams Or Better\n\n20\n\nMiami Heat\n\n18\n\nLast Rank\n\nAdditions/re-signs: Kel’el Ware, Pelle Larsson, Thomas Bryant, Haywood Highsmith, Kevin Love, Alec Burks\n\nSubtractions: Caleb Martin, Orlando Robinson\n\nDid they get better? Not at all. Losing Martin matters, and it feels like the Heat were waiting for the Mitchell-Cavaliers thing to fall apart. Now, they’re left trying to figure out how to build back their culture and turn into a major player in the East again. All of this is contingent on how much Jimmy Butler, who turns 35 in September, has left and if they want to maintain that partnership. The Heat, once again, will look for the diamond in the rough to fill in for departed players.\n\nEastern\n\nTier 4 - Play-In Tournament Teams Or Better\n\nTier 5 - Are they just filling out Play-In criteria\n\n21\n\nSan Antonio Spurs\n\n23\n\nLast Rank\n\nAdditions/re-signs: Chris Paul, Stephon Castle, Harrison Ingram, Harrison Barnes\n\nSubtractions: Devonte’ Graham\n\nDid they get better? Absolutely. I love the Spurs’ offseason so far. They brought in two very important veterans to raise the professionalism and approach of a team that was just throwing things against a wall to see what sticks last season. I think Castle will probably be the best player in this draft. And with Victor Wembanyama, all things are possible. This could be a Play-In team, even in the loaded West.\n\nWestern\n\nTier 5 - Are they just filling out Play-In criteria\n\n22\n\nAtlanta Hawks\n\n20\n\nLast Rank\n\nAdditions/re-signs: Zaccharie Risacher, Larry Nance Jr., Dyson Daniels, Nikola Djurisic, EJ Liddell, Cody Zeller, Vit Krejci\n\nSubtractions: Dejounte Murray, AJ Griffin, Saddiq Bey\n\nDid they get better? They did not, but they’re hoping there is addition by subtraction here. The Murray-Trae Young backcourt didn’t raise their level. Risacher doesn’t have the expectations of most No. 1 overall picks. Daniels could be a nice development project. Ultimately, the Hawks have switched out coaches and changed the main guys around Young. If this team is still mediocre, then what’s the next move?\n\nEastern\n\nTier 5 - Are they just filling out Play-In criteria\n\n23\n\nToronto Raptors\n\n26\n\nLast Rank\n\nAdditions/re-signs: Ja’Kobe Walter, Jonathan Mogbo, Davion Mitchell, Sasha Vezenkov, Jamal Shead, Ulrich Chomche, Immanuel Quickley, Garrett Temple\n\nSubtractions: Jalen McDaniels\n\nDid they get better? I think they’re mostly the same. We’ll see what happens with Gary Trent Jr. and his free agency. For the most part, the Raptors were so bad last season because they went hard on the tanking front to protect a pick they didn’t even keep. They’re banking on Scottie Barnes, Immanuel Quickley and RJ Barrett leading their future. The big money to Quickley greatly increases expectations for him. He now has to play like a franchise point guard.\n\nEastern\n\nTier 5 - Are they just filling out Play-In criteria\n\nTier 6 - Cooper Flagg positioning\n\n24\n\nUtah Jazz\n\n25\n\nLast Rank\n\nAdditions/re-signs: Cody Williams, Isaiah Collier, Kyle Filipowski, Drew Eubanks\n\nSubtractions: Kris Dunn, Omer Yurtseven\n\nDid they get better? We’re in a wait-and-see mode as far as gauging whether the Jazz improved. This will all depend on Lauri Markannen’s future with the team. Utah should be tanking to go after one of the top prospects in the 2025 draft. It’s something the Jazz should’ve done two years ago with Wembanyama available. I love the pickups of Cody Williams (10th overall pick) and Isaiah Collier (29th overall). The Jazz have a strong youth movement but still need that top prospect to develop and lead the rebuild.\n\nWestern\n\nTier 6 - Cooper Flagg positioning\n\n25\n\nChicago Bulls\n\n19\n\nLast Rank\n\nAdditions/re-signs: Matas Buzelis, Josh Giddey, Jalen Smith, Patrick Williams, Chris Duarte\n\nSubtractions: Alex Caruso, DeMar DeRozan, Andre Drummond\n\nDid they get better? Welcome to the teardown of the Bulls … something that should’ve happened a year or two ago. Caruso, DeRozan and Drummond were some of the best Bulls last season. Chicago is now going heavy with its youth movement, which should eventually lead to Nikola Vučević and maybe Zach LaVine getting moved. The Bulls are a lot worse now, and it’s a good idea.\n\nEastern\n\nTier 6 - Cooper Flagg positioning\n\n26\n\nDetroit Pistons\n\n30\n\nLast Rank\n\nAdditions/re-signs: Ron Holland, Tobias Harris, Wendell Moore Jr., Bobi Klintman, Simone Fontecchio, Malik Beasley, Tim Hardaway Jr., Paul Reed\n\nSubtractions: Quentin Grimes, James Wiseman\n\nDid they get better? The main addition here is J.B. Bickerstaff taking over as head coach for the recently fired Monty Williams. The Pistons had an atrocious coaching influence last season. They had to trade Isaiah Livers and waive Killian Hayes just to get Williams to stop playing them. Holland (fifth overall pick) is an interesting project. Harris is there to raise the floor of the team. Above all, the Pistons just need to provide Cunningham with actual help to see where his ceiling is.\n\nEastern\n\nTier 6 - Cooper Flagg positioning\n\n27\n\nPortland Trail Blazers\n\n27\n\nLast Rank\n\nAdditions/re-signs: Donovan Clingan, Deni Avdija\n\nSubtractions: Malcolm Brogdon\n\nDid they get better? As of right now, the Blazers are mostly running it back with a squad that really struggled last season. And they still want to build with guys like Scoot Henderson, Anfernee Simons and Shaedon Sharpe. Clingan was taken with the seventh pick, so they’re hoping he can provide the defensive anchor Deandre Ayton couldn’t. With Brogdon out, Henderson will get the keys full-time.\n\nWestern\n\nTier 6 - Cooper Flagg positioning\n\n28\n\nCharlotte Hornets\n\n28\n\nLast Rank\n\nAdditions/re-signs: Tidjane Salaun, Miles Bridges, Josh Green, Reggie Jackson, Seth Curry\n\nSubtractions: Davis Bertans, Bryce McGowens, Aleksej Pokusevski\n\nDid they get better? The Hornets have gone through massive organizational changes in terms of new ownership, management and coaching. The roster? We haven’t seen big changes yet, so that’s going to remain a work in progress. We know they have a star with LaMelo Ball. They have a budding star with Brandon Miller. Charlotte decided to bring back Miles Bridges. There are hints of solid role players, but next season will mostly be about how new coach Charles Lee changes Charlotte’s culture of losing.\n\nEastern\n\nTier 6 - Cooper Flagg positioning\n\n29\n\nBrooklyn Nets\n\n22\n\nLast Rank\n\nAdditions/re-signs: Nic Claxton, Bojan Bogdanović, Shake Milton, Mamadi, Diakite, Trendon Watford\n\nSubtractions: Mikal Bridges, Keita Bates-Diop\n\nDid they get better? Not at all. The Nets are gearing up for a teardown and rebuild through the draft. They regained some control of their draft situation in their move with the Rockets, so they’re going to reset everything. Sending out Bridges for a handful of first-round picks was the white flag. Bringing back Claxton could provide a big trade piece for them at the deadline. This is Cam Thomas’ team now … at least for next season.\n\nEastern\n\nTier 6 - Cooper Flagg positioning\n\n30\n\nWashington Wizards\n\n29\n\nLast Rank\n\nAdditions/re-signs: Alex Sarr, Bub Carrington, Malcolm Brogdon, Jonas Valančiūnas, Richaun Holmes, Saddiq Bey\n\nSubtractions: Deni Avdija, Landry Shamet\n\nDid they get better? I want this to be a yes. It will largely depend on how ready to play Sarr is. This year’s second overall pick has fun potential, but he could have a rough transition to the NBA. If they retain Tyus Jones (current free agent), that could also help. If Brogdon actually plays for Washington, the team would also benefit from that. If not, you’re relying on Jordan Poole to be better in Year 2 with the Wizards. As someone who predicted Poole for the scoring title last season, I’m staying far away from that concept.\n\nEastern\n\nTier 6 - Cooper Flagg positioning\n\n(Top photo of Klay Thompson and Luka Dončić: Tim Heitman / Getty Images)"
