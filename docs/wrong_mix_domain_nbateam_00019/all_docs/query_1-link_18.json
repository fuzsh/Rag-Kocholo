He’s driven, intelligent, a major competitor, and meticulous in his attention to detail. These are qualities that the best coaches all have.

It’ll be interesting to see if he’s a legit candidate for LA or Cleveland or Detroit. – 12:38 AM\n\nRyan Ward @RyanWardLA\n\nAccording to Adrian Wojnarowski (@wojespn), who spoke with Scott Van Pelt on SportsCenter, the Lakers haven’t offered the coaching job to JJ Redick yet, even though they interviewed him last weekend.\n\nInteresting… – 11:50 PM\n\nMore on this storyline\n\nMagic Johnson: I’m cautiously optimistic that this new hire is a success for both the Lakers and JJ Reddick. I enjoyed watching him as a player – great 3-point shooting, high basketball IQ, passion for the game, and mental and physical toughness. If he can bring how he played professionally to the Lakers – this could work out! But will his transition from star basketball player to head coach end up like Steve Kerr, Jason Kidd, Ty Lue, or Doc Rivers or the former NBA players turned coaches who weren’t successful? -via Twitter @MagicJohnson / June 20, 2024\n\nMagic Johnson: Naming a head coach was just the first step. Even bigger than naming JJ Reddick as the Head Coach, Rob Pelinka’s next step must be to improve the roster if we are going to compete against all the powerhouse teams in the West like the Nuggets, Timberwolves, Mavericks, Suns, Thunder, Spurs, and the Clippers. -via Twitter @MagicJohnson / June 20, 2024\n\nAssistant coaching candidates for JJ Redick’s staff will include former head coach and recent Trail Blazers assistant Scott Brooks, former Lakers guard Rajon Rondo, ex-Laker and current Dallas Mavericks assistant Jared Dudley and Cassell, according to league sources. -via New York Times / June 20, 2024"
