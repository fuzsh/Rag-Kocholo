        "text": "The disparity between the media and Lakers fans about Anthony Davis' defensive impact is still massive. Fans believed Davis made a case for Defensive Player of the Year, while the media somehow didn't name him a finalist for the award.\n\nPrior to JJ Redick's acceptance of the Lakers' head coaching position, he was a member of the media and didn't have Davis on the All-Defensive team.\n\nOn the Sirius XM NBA Radio show, Redick explained why he left him off his list.\n\nThis statement perplexes me. He's a top defender, but somehow, he's not on any of the All-Defense teams. Was he a casualty of a faux roster construction exercise?\n\nRedick explained that he weighed heavily on team defense, but players like Victor Wembanyama didn't get penalized for team performance, which seems to be a negative for AD.\n\nMaybe fans are suffering from Lakers exceptionalism, or perhaps, when Redick was a media member, he just underrated what Davis brings to a team on the defensive side of the ball.\n\nIt's not an uncommon position to be in. Currently, Davis is playing for Team USA and more casual fans who don't watch every Lakers game are seeing just how good he is as a player.\n\nAmong the world's best, he stands out, defending on the perimeter and making incredible blocks. However, head coach Steve Kerr is still seemingly slighting him, starting Joel Embiid over AD for now.\n\nMaybe that changes as the stakes get higher for Team USA as they enter the Olympics, but the truth is people are consistently late on Davis' greatness. While Redick can spin it any way he likes, when he thought of the ten best defenders, he left Davis off his list and then supported that action on air.\n\nNow he's on the sidelines and his tune seems different.\n\nHe has Davis as a top defender and is looking to use him as a \"hub\" on offense. There's no mistaking that AD is the best and most important player on the Lakers and a big part of Redick's job will be to ensure that he optimizes him.\n\nUltimately, execution will matter more than Redick's All-Defense team selections, no matter how wrong they were."
