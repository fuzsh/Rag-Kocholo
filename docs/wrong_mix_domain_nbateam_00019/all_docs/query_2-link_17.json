        "text": "Bart Young/NBAE via Getty Images\n\nLeBron James applauded the Los Angeles Lakers' decision to add JJ Redick as the team's new head coach, although he confirmed that he was not part of the hiring process.\n\n\"I'm not involved in the coaching hiring, but I'm excited about JJ,\" James said, per ESPN's Dave McMenamin. \"I'm excited about working with coach [Nate] McMillan. I haven't worked with him since the Olympic run [in 2008]. First time working with coach [Scott] Brooks, looking forward to that. So I'm excited about that. That's been the extent of it all this summer as far as the Lakers.\"\n\nThe Lakers hired Redick on June 20 before adding McMillan and Brooks as his assistants on Wednesday. Former head coach Darvin Ham was fired following Los Angeles' first-round defeat at the hands of the Denver Nuggets in the 2024 NBA playoffs.\n\nWhile James was briefly a free agent after declining his $51.4 million player option, he returned to the Lakers on a two-year deal worth $104 million. His new contract also includes another player option as well as a no-trade clause, per ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.\n\nAlthough James and Redick never shared the floor as teammates throughout their respective NBA careers, the two joined forces off the court after the sharpshooter's playing days were over. The pair hosted the Mind the Game podcast together before Redick was hired by the Lakers.\n\nWith the NBA's all-time leading scorer set to return for his 22nd season, his new head coach could keep him off the ball in order to maximize his energy for a playoff run. Shams Charania, Sam Amick, and Jovan Buha of The Athletic reported on June 20 that Redick outlined a system that would focus on Anthony Davis and have James operate without the ball in his hands during his interview with the team.\n\nAfter he was hired, Redick confirmed that he's focused on James improving his three-point volume.\n\n\"He and I have joked about this,\" Redick said on June 24, per Forbes Sports' Shane Young. \"He shot over 40% from three this year. I want him shooting threes.\"\n\nJames is coming off an impressive 2023-24 campaign, earning the 20th All-Star nod of his career. In 71 starts, the 39-year-old averaged 25.7 points and 7.3 rebounds to go along with 8.3 assists per game."
