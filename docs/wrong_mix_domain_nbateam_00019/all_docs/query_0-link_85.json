        "text": "“Anthony Davis is one of the two or three best defensive players in the NBA” JJ Redick responds to @termineradio ’s question about his decision to leave the #Lakers star center off his media All-Defensive ballot with @jumpshot8 and Ryan McDonough at #NBA2KSummerLeague\n\nJJ Redick: 'I felt a calling to coach. I'm just a sicko, and I'm a masochist'\n\nNonetheless, JJ Redick knew all of that coming in and still relishes the opportunity to coach the Lakers. After all, he wants to experience the thrill of the pressure that comes with competing against the best of the best under the blinding spotlight in Los Angeles. “I felt a calling to coach. Part of that is that I’m just a sicko, and I’m a masochist, and I want to sign up for high stakes, high pressure,” Redick said, per Ryan Ward of Lakers Nation.\n\nBut most importantly, Redick knows that he’s right where he belongs. And he will be fighting to stay where he is with everything he’s got. “The other is in my retirement, I realize what gives me fulfillment and what gives me drive and motivation, and that’s competition. That’s performance. That’s collaboration, being part of a team. I certainly felt all of that doing media,” Redick added."
