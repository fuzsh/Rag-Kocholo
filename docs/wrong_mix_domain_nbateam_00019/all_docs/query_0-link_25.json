        "text": "For the past few years, the New Orleans Pelicans weren’t really considered contenders in the Western Conference. mainly due to the unavailability of Zion Williamson. Things are different this year as NBA analyst JJ Redick has noticed the team’s rise in the standings.\n\nJust recently, the Pelicans dismantled the Brooklyn Nets at the Barclays Center in New York. In that 104-91 win, fans saw Zion Williamson drop 28 points, seven rebounds, and four assists in 32 minutes on the court. CJ McCollum added 16 points and five assists to seal the win for NOLA.\n\nThe Nets, on the other hand, were led by Cam Thomas with 25 points, three rebounds, and two assists. Mikal Bridges added 15 points, two rebounds, and two steals in the Nets’ 43rd loss of the season.\n\nAs a result, the Pelicans’ lineup strengthened their hold on the Western Conference’s fifth spot, and are closely inching their way to the Los Angeles Clippers’ place in the standings. Meanwhile, the Nets have are in 11th place in the East, and are not projected to make the playoffs this year.\n\nJJ Redick Warns Denver Nuggets About New Orleans Pelicans’ Massive Rise in the West\n\nWhile most analysts peg the Denver Nuggets to make the NBA Finals, former NBA star JJ Redick think that the Pelicans can make a surprising run by going deep in the postseason. Redick explains more in a video posted by Vito Corleonie on X:\n\nRedick bases his opinion on the rise of Williamson and the improvement of his game during the past two months. At this point in time, the All-Star forward has averaged 22.7 points on 58 percent shooting from the field, 5.8 rebounds, and 5.0 assists per game. His stellar showing has elevated the Pelicans to a top-ten ranking on both offense and defense among 30 teams in the league.\n\nWhile the Nuggets are the favorites to make the Finals, New Orleans can end up surprising everyone in the postseason, as warned by Redick. If that happens, expect a lot of jaws to be dropped at the direction of Williamson and the Pelicans.\n\nFor More Great Basketball Content"
