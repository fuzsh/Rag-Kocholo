        "text": "After a long standstill, JJ Redick was named the newest head coach for the Los Angeles Lakers. The Duke legend joins rare company of former players to have pivoted to coaching. But it’s unheard of for a first-timer to take command of the Lakers, probably the most influential franchise in NBA history. It’s a job that given the recent past comes characterized by surreal pressure and expectations. Such a scenario takes patience to accustom to. Colin Cowherd believes that’s a luxury the Purple and Gold have never provided to any coach.\n\nWhen speaking on the Colin Cowherd Show, the reputed sportscaster spoke highly of Redick’s genius and competitiveness. He insisted that he worries more about the Lakers’ management rather than the former Sixer’s competence. To bring his point forth, he used the precedent set by the last two champions – the Denver Nuggets and the Boston Celtics.\n\n“Just think about this. The two best teams in the league in my opinion, they are favored next year are the Celtics and Denver. Denver landed the Joker, the best player in the world, surrounded him with good players and it still took an excellent coach Michael Malone what was it seven years to win a title with the best player in his prime… The Celtics landed two excellent players maybe not as good as Joker. But Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum, excellent players that excellent coach Brad Stevens who’s now an excellent GM Brad Stevens took them seven-eight years” Cowherd expanded.\n\nThe revered media personality feels the NBA is no more a league of superstars but rather talent is uniformly distributed. Three stars aren’t easy to land nor do they warrant a championship. What’s essential is showing faith in the group and making supporting changes as they go along.\n\nEven if we analyze the current champions, the Celtics, they were once an incomplete team. Tatum and Brown were raw talents with unpolished skills and a limitless ceiling. Instead of showing desperation for a star, Stevens nurtured the tandem and made them the focal point of the system. In the years later they added incredible complementary components such as Derrick White, Jrue Holiday, and Porzingis that eventually led to a championship.\n\nThe Lakers too need to provide Redick with the freedom to devise his strategies and roster but also respectable time to understand the franchise to deliver on the championship expectations.\n\nThe sensitive history of Lakers coaches\n\nRedick is the eighth coach for the Lakers since 2011. In that span, they have only won a single championship which came in 2020 under Frank Vogel. The last coach to serve five years or more was the Zen Master Phil Jackson when he returned to the helm from 2006-2011. The longest tenure for a coach since then has been three seasons.\n\nThe Lakers have relentlessly pursued instant success rather than orchestrating a process that leads to success. They have tested multiple combinations, constantly rotated coaches, and made extreme roster changes. They have only stuck true to Davis and James. However, it’s quintessential that they provide Redick the time to adjust if they are hoping for success.\n\nAs a first-time coach, JJ Redick needs appropriate time within the system to completely immerse himself and foster a winning culture. He will also require ample observation period to decide the right roster requirements and accordingly advise the front office. As much as the players are important, the influence of a coach can make or break a franchise.\n\nEvery dynasty so far has had that commonality. The coach has been constant. The Spurs entrusted the keys to Gregg Popovich, the Warriors never touched on moving Steve Kerr and the closest example is Jackson who led Kobe Bryant to his final two championships only after two years of supervision.\n\nIf JJ Redick is given time, he has the traits that could make him a great coach. He has seen esteemed coaches and learned from them. Mike Krzyzewski, his Duke coach admitted Redick was among the smartest players he had worked with. It’s all about whether the Lakers can capitalize on his undiscovered potential and make the most of this move.\n\nEven Shaq’s former agent, Leonard Armato held his opinion about the Lakers’ hiring of Redick. To listen to his comments, watch this video of our conversation with the fierce brand builder in this video below."
