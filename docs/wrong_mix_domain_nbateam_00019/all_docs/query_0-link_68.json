        "text": "According to Jovan Buha, Los Angeles Lakers beat writer for The Athletic, the team could have interest in former NBA veteran JJ Redick as their next head coach.\n\nI think JJ Redick, if he does not get the Hornets job or he does not choose to join the Hornets, I think he would be an interesting candidate. He’s got LA ties, he used to play for the Clippers, he used to live in LA and most importantly he has a good relationship with LeBron James given that they are currently podcast partners on the Mind the Game podcast.\n\nBuha’s report comes just one day after the Lakers were eliminated by the Denver Nuggets in the first round of the 2024 NBA Playoffs. Although nothing is official yet, the Lakers will likely move on from current head coach Darvin Ham this offseason.\n\nCurrently, Redick is considered a frontrunner for the Charlotte Hornets’ head coaching spot.\n\nFormer NBA Player May Be Next Los Angeles Lakers Head Coach\n\nJJ Redick or Not, Changes Are Likely Coming in Los Angeles\n\nSince winning the championship in 2020, the Lakers have not made it back to the NBA Finals. This summer, star forward LeBron James has a player option for his age-40 season. As it stands, it appears likely the four-time champion will opt out of his player option and become a free agent for the first time since 2018. However, according to ESPN’s Brian Windhorst, James will likely remain with the Lakers.\n\nI don’t think LeBron James is gonna retire & I do think he’s gonna play at least one more season.. I really don’t see him leaving the Lakers.. I think he will opt out of his contract though because I think Bronny is entering the draft\n\nAdditionally, The Athletic is reporting the Lakers are open to drafting James’ son Bronny in the upcoming NBA Draft.\n\nAccording to Shams Charania, Jovan Buha and Sam Amick of The Athletic, the Lakers would consider the option of helping LeBron “fulfill his dream” by being teammates with his son.\n\nJames has made it clear in the past that he would like to team up with his son in the NBA.\n\nFurthermore, guard D’Angelo Russell also has a player option this offseason. After Game 5, Russell said he will “try to take advantage” of his “leverage.”\n\nWhen I signed my contract last year, I knew what position I was going to put myself in, so to be in that position now with a little leverage, I’ll try to take advantage of it.\n\nThe Last Word on JJ Redick\n\nDespite never having coached at the NBA level, Redick is an intriguing option. Due to his playing career and commentating/podcasting career, it is obvious the Duke alum has high basketball knowledge. Additionally, he has a good relationship with James. Hiring a first-year coach is risky, but Redick could be worth the risk. Ultimately, the Lakers’ season has been over for less than 24 hours up to this point. It is unlikely they will make a decision soon. However, Redick is certainly a name to keep an eye on."
