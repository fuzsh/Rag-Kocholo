        "text": "Glenn James/NBAE via Getty Images\n\nFormer NBA player JJ Redick is a \"real candidate\" to be the Los Angeles Lakers head coach if they move on from current coach Darvin Ham, per ESPN's Dave McMenamin.\n\nMaking an appearance on The Dan Patrick Show, McMenamin explained that the 15-year veteran could be on the Lakers' list.\n\n\"JJ certainly is a real candidate if they open up this coaching search,\" McMenamin said (7:15 in video). \"But there's, I'd say, a half a dozen folks out there.\"\n\nRedick, who retired from the NBA in 2021, is currently an on-air NBA analyst for ESPN and hosts two podcasts—The Old Man and the Three and Mind the Game, which he hosts alongside Lakers star LeBron James.\n\nWhile Redick has not been an NBA coach yet, he's emerged as a realistic candidate in this season's head coaching carousel. Along with being a potential candidate for Los Angeles, Redick interviewed for the Charlotte Hornets head coaching vacancy and is reportedly seen as a \"serious candidate.\"\n\nIf Redick doesn't end up with the Lakers, it seems he still could make his NBA coaching debut next season.\n\nLos Angeles has yet to fire Ham, but the team is reportedly expected to fire him \"likely by the end of the week\" after its first-round exit against the Denver Nuggets.\n\nTaking a chance on Redick as a head coach could be a risky move considering his lack of coaching experience. The 39-year-old would be among the youngest coaches in the NBA, but a youthful approach could pay off as Los Angeles looks to have a turnaround season."
