        "text": "Watch Rob Parker of Fox Sports Radio’s The Odd Couple blast the Los Angeles Lakers franchise for considering hiring former NBA player J.J. Redick as their next head coach and teasing the idea of drafting LeBron James’ derided son Bronny just to appease their star.\n\nCheck out the segment above as Parker calls out the Lakers for being an ‘embarrassment’ who is turning into a ‘mom and pop’ shop that LeBron is walking all over.\n\nRob Parker: “I got a message for Jeanie Buss and for the Lakers...\n\nSTOP THE MADNESS. YOU WILL REGRET THIS! WHAT ARE YOU DOING WHERE THE LOS ANGELES LAKERS ARE TURNING OVER ITS FRANCHISE TO LEBRON JAMES??\n\nWho by most accounts won’t win again. Most people believe he will NOT win again, and yet here you are a marquee franchise, not only in the NBA but in ALL sports. You will regret this by allowing this franchise to be run like a mom and pop store.\n\nIN THIS ON? [tapping a fake microphone] THIS IS THE LOS ANGELES LAKERS, THIS IS NOT THE CHARLOTTE HORNETS. IT’S NOT SOME MICKEY MOUSE FRANCHISE LIKE THE ORLANDO MAGIC. THIS IS THE LOS ANGELES LAKERS WHERE SOME OF THE GREATEST PLAYERS WHO HAVE EVER PLAYED HAVE WORN THIS UNIFORM. THERE ARE NEVER GOING TO BE EMPTY SEATS, I DON’T CARE WHAT YOU CALL THE ARENA OR WHO IS PLAYING THERE!\n\nThe idea and the notion about JJ Redick being at the top of your list to be your head coach?? It’s one thing if this is the University of Wisconsin at Great Bay and you wanna take a flyer on a novice. Shout out to Doug Gottlieb! The Lakers are not the organization that is giving people their first opportunity in this situation where supposedly you have a team that is ready to win. If you got LeBron James and you’ve got Anthony Davis, and you really believe you’ve got a chance, you can’t put LeBron’s podcast partner, his contemporary, and ask him to guide this team to a championship. It is EMBARRASSING where the Lakers are and what they’re doing. They will regret this. I know they don’t want to believe it.\n\nGO AHEAD, TURN THE KEYS OVER TO LEBRON AND LET HIM DRIVE THE CAR AROUND. HE’S 40 YEARS OLD! HE’LL DRIVE THE CAR WITH THE BLINKER ON FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS! GO AHEAD, IT’S A MISTAKE!\n\nYou can’t keep doing this. I get it, you got a championship with LeBron and you should be happy about that but turn the page. I would move away from LeBron at this point. The Lakers have leverage. In Milwaukee they have no leverage [referring to the Bucks holding onto Giannis’ brother], they got bowling alleys and Polish sausage. That’s all they have. So they have to take Giannis’ brother. This is the Lakers and they have leverage. You know what, LeBron? If you want to move from your mansion in Beverly Hills and you don’t wanna live here, and you don’t want the sun shining, and you don’t want the access to Hollywood and all the other stuff, and want to go somewhere else, OK, but we’re not just going to acquiesce and do whatever.\n\nI don’t think they should draft Bronny. It sends a terrible message to your franchise. The Lakers don’t have to do this. Other franchises do but the Lakers don’t. It's a dangerous thing. They’re contemporaries, they’re working together, it could end up being BAD.”\n\nColin Cowherd Raves Over this NFL Team's Potential\n\nAntonio Brown Makes Bizarre 'Apology' to Caitlin Clark After Twitter Blasts\n\nLivvy Dunne, Brittany Mahomes Shared Photos Teasing SI Swimsuit Launch\n\nTom Brady Admitted Roast Jokes 'Affected My Kids'\n\nColin Cowherd Reveals His Six Best NFL Win Total Bets For the 2024 Season\n\nDoug Gottlieb Confirms Being Green Bay Men's Basketball's New Head Coach\n\nColin Cowherd: Why Jared Goff, Not Tua, Deserves a Contract Extension\n\nRob Parker: If Mike Tyson Beats Jake Paul, Then the Fight Was Fixed\n\nColin Cowherd: Knicks Are Not a Great 'Team', They're a Great 'Story'\n\nColin Cowherd: How the Denver Nuggets Saved Their Season"
