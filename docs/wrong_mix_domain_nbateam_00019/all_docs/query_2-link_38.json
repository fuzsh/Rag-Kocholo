        "text": "TRAVEL IS FUN!!! Here is an empathetic shout out to everyone who travels a significant amount for work. Days like today in Denver expose business travel for what it is...fun at times, but mostly a grind and on days like today, a pain in the ass. I feel fortunate to have made it home to Texas. Many won't be as lucky and it may be a few days before people can get home. Kids' games will be missed, recitals missed, dinner with friends missed, I'd imagine births of children might be missed, along with some other very, very important stuff. Meanwhile, the Weather Channel will name this Winter Storm some stupid name, and cover it like it is Hurricane Katrina. Undoubtedly, they will tie it to El Nino, which is of course because of climate change, which is because of greenhouse gasses...if we'd only all dump our gas vehicles and purchase EV's!! ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ¤£ If you are among the millions of people currently upset with your employer because they have the audacity to expect you to come into the office 2-3 times a week, remember there are tons of people marooned in some crappy airport hotel/motel tonight, eating cold Chinese food that took 2 hours to deliver, frantically trying to figure out if they can get home at some point to see their families before they have to turn around and do it again next week. Safe travels and warmest wishes to those battling the weather to get home tonight. Business travel is hard. #businesstravel #denver #snow #returntooffice\n\n\"Mandatory Valentines\" are BS, our schools should return to \"Free Market\" giving of Valentines Valentines Day is upon us, and whether you loathe it or love it, Valentines Day parties in K-12 today don't resemble Valentine parties of decades past, and the parties of today don't resemble real life either. My kids are now 18 and 20, but I do remember getting them ready to attend their party when they were in 1st and 3rd grade. They each had to fill out roughly 30 Valentines, one for each classmate. In return, they would receive one from each of their classmates. We wouldn't want anyone feeling left out, so let's legislate the behavior of grade school kids to prevent anyone from having hurt feelings. Many people reading this don't remember a time when this wasn't the case. When I attended O' Dea elementary in Fort Collins, Colorado, every year we would decorate old shoe boxes with construction paper, doilies and crayons. We'd then put our boxes in front of the class and throughout the day you would put a Valentine in someone's box, and some people might put one in yours. Then at the end of the day you'd get all hopped up on juice and cookies and you'd get a chance to see who maybe had a crush on you, and it was a great litmus test to see if the girl you were crushing on maybe dug you back. It was like a prehistoric form of Tinder for grade schoolers...the feedback was less instantaneous than a dating app, but the dopamine hit as a result of getting a Valentine from that special someone was legit. Why? Because it was real. Nobody \"had\" to give a Valentine to anyone. I was a shy kid who attended speech therapy class once a day, I had glasses and was legally blind in one eye. I had to wear a patch over my good eye, the thought being that my bad eye would improve. Simply put, I was a little weird, different and usually my Valentines box had very few deposits. Was I bummed at times? For sure. But I would also get a few Valentines each year. Some of them I am sure were \"pity\" based, but at least the delivery of them was rooted in genuine empathy for the kid with the lisp and the patch...it was real, because it wasn't mandatory. I also learned that life isn't fair, and that it isn't supposed to be and wasn't meant to be. We don't give kids enough credit. If we didn't try so hard to legislate the behavior of kids, we might find they are far more empathetic, kind and understanding than we think. We may also find out that kids like me, the ones who maybe don't quite fit in, are a lot more resilient and stronger than we think. Sadly, we as parents, administrators and the public in general do just about everything we can to shield kids from experiencing any sort of awkwardness or pain. Maybe we should get out of the way and allow kids to experience those kinds of emotions while we can point out the lessons and somewhat control the narrative. We can start by not mandating Valentines for everyone."
