        "text": "Another season where the Los Angeles Lakers fail to conquer an NBA title and, just like last year, the Denver Nuggets ended their hopes in a heartbreaking fashion but more because of the dominant performance, even though some games were close at the end.\n\nThe idea of a change is more a necessity for the team, but doubts of on if it will on players or coachers is a topic of discussion.\n\nMany, like Charles Barkley, believe its time to renovate the roster and he may have a point. LeBron James is 39 years old, and his future is uncertain after not wanting to answer a question on whether he will continue or not in LA.\n\nAnthony Davis was set to lead the team once James left, but doubts about that have emerged and the supporting cast needs an upgrade.\n\nA coaching change might be in the horizon\n\nIf there Lakers were to make a change and move on from Darvin Ham, sources say that candidates have a legitimate shot at the position.\n\nAccording to reports, former NBA player JJ Redick is a \"real candidate\" to be the new Lakers head coach and he is not the only one.\n\nTyronn Lue is another option for the job if available. The current Los Angeles Clippers coach would be interesting, according to reports. Plus, this would mean that there is a chance that LeBron James could stay.\n\nThey became good friends in their time together in Cleveland with the Cavaliers and if Lakers fans want to have a shot of keeping James, this could be the only option.\n\nWith that said, a renovation in the roster is desperately needed so keep an eye on that as well."
