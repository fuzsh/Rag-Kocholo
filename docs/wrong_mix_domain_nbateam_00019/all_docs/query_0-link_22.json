        "text": "Former LA Clippers guard JJ Redick called out Milwaukee Bucks head coach Doc Rivers during a segment of ESPN's First Take, saying, \"I've seen the trend for years. The trend is always making excuses. Doc, we get it. Taking over a team in the middle of a season is hard... But it's always an excuse. It's always throwing your team under the bus... There's never accountability with that guy.\"\n\nAustin Rivers, Doc Rivers' son and former teammate of Redick with the Clippers, responded to these comments during an NBA Today segment, saying Rivers is always held responsible.\n\n\"For someone who is not accountable, he seems to always be held responsible. Considering he's the guy who is always fired whenever things don't go right,\" Rivers said. \"He got fired in the bubble for a 3-1 lead vs. the Denver Nuggets when half his team didn't want to be there... Then he gets fired for losing to a team that was favored over him, which was the Celtics last year.\"\n\nAustin Rivers then took some shots at Redick, saying his best years came under Doc Rivers, while also calling out his poor defense and limited offensive game:\n\n\"It's strange coming from JJ, and I have love for JJ... You're my bro, I love you, it's just your best years were with the Clippers... In terms of accountability, what are we doing here? Your best years in the NBA were when you played for him and the Clippers... I don't know if there's frustration there or if there's tension there between you, I know a lot of times we had to sit you towards the end of the game due to defensive reasons... Our whole system was drafted around you because you're a shooter, you're not a guy that can put the ball on the floor... It's just very ironic and kinda weird that you have this energy towards him.\"\n\nMichael Malone Reveals Hilarious Moment With Nikola Jokic After Ejection\n\nVictor Wembanyama Makes History vs. Nuggets"
