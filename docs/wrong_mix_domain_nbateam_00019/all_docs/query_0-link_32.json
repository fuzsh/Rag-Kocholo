With a new CBA, a similarly stationed player in Brandon Ingram almost certainly won't receive one in this climate.\n\nby Jack Tien-Dana\n\nMost teams don't a have single young guy as promising as the Rockets' cache of Jalen Green, Alperen Sengun, Jabari Smith Jr., Tari Eason, Amen Thompson, Cam Whitmore and Reed Sheppard.\n\nby John Wilmes\n\nJalen Brunson is living his dream in a very unique way, while Zach LaVine waits in limbo to achieve his again with a contract too large to trade."
