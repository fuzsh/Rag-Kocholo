        "text": "Jamie Schwaberow, Getty\n\nDuring what was considered an \"impressive\" visit with the Los Angeles Lakers, new head coach JJ Redick reportedly outlined how he would handle the team's current roster, per The Athletic's Shams Charania, Sam Amick and Jovan Buha.\n\n\"Redick described a system molded around this roster, focusing on elevating Anthony Davis' involvement, particularly late in games, and alleviating the constant ball-handling duties on James by utilizing him more off the ball,\" Charania, Amick and Buha wrote. \"Keeping James, who turns 40 in December, fresh down the stretch of the regular season and into the playoffs will be critical.\"\n\nThe Lakers are coming off a first-round loss to the Denver Nuggets and are looking to compete for a championship next year. The window for another title is still open, but last season's early exit proved a major shift is necessary.\n\nRedick's system could be the shift that helps James get his fifth title and Davis his second.\n\nRedick agreed to a four-year deal with the Lakers on Thursday, taking over after Los Angeles fired Darvin Ham and becoming just the fifth NBA head coach ever to have no previous coaching experience.\n\nThe 15-year NBA veteran is looking to display his high level basketball IQ after working in the media world since his retirement in 2021, and coaching one of the most historic franchises in the league will be a prime opportunity to do so."
