As NBA rumors heat up towards the end of the season, it has been heavily reported that the Los Angeles Lakers are interested in acquiring J. J. Redick and Bronny James.

According to Los Angeles Times, Redick is the frontrunner to become the Lakers' new head coach, while the team has a strong interest in drafting Bronny James, LeBron James's son.

Redick's name has been long mentioned in the race for the head coaching position. Lastly, The Athletic reported that he, Sam Cassell, and James Borrego were among the top three candidates.

As for Bronny James, it has been similarly rumored that the Lakers management was interested in drafting the young talent. However, James last stated that "It was never a dream" for him to play with his dad.

The future for the Lakers looks uncertain at the moment, with LeBron James's contract also coming to an end this year. In spite of the uncertainty, the team management is intent on keeping James and making changes to both the player and the coaching roster.

Los Angeles Lakers had an early exit to the season this year, losing 4-1 in the first round of the NBA playoffs to the Denver Nuggets. They sacked coach Darvin Ham in return.
