Los Angeles Lakers are hot on the search for a new coach after the sacking of Darvin Ham, and one of their candidates is former player J. J. Redick.

According to Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN, the Lakers have been drawn to Redick for a while now and are considering him as an option.

"But one name that the Lakers have been drilling down on in their initial research is J. J. Redick, our colleague at ESPN," Wojnarowski said with a smile.

"He's certainly somebody that the Lakers are intrigued with. They've been making a lot of calls to try to learn more about him, but expect this to be a wide-ranging and lengthy search for the LA," he concluded.

The NBA insider also notes that the Lakers' coach search will end this week. He states that alongside Redick, the Lakers will be asking for permission around the league to interview coaches.

Los Angeles Lakers had an early exit to the season this year, losing 4-1 in the first round of the NBA playoffs to the Denver Nuggets.
