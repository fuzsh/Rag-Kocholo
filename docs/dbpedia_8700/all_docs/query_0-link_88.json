Our programs offer an extensive variety of creative, age-appropriate recreation opportunities year round.\n\nRecreation Services is also committed to identifying the specific and unique skills needed to support our services and enhance the future growth of our employees.

Collectively, we have introduced a variety of resources focused on children's voices and leadership in decision making.\n\nMany of our resources help to establish an understanding of building welcoming and inclusive spaces for all children and youth, and help prepare us to enhance our programs and curriculums to ensure that newcomer and refugee children/youth have positive first experiences in our programs, facilities and the broader community.\n\nRecreation programs enhanced by this initiative: What’s Up!

These activity cards are the final product and can be used at home or in schools/programs to further enhance curriculums throughout Winnipeg.\n\nAnti-Racism in Sport\n\nThe City of Winnipeg is a partner on Immigration Partnership Winnipeg’sAnti-Racism in Sport campaign. The campaign seeks to help people identify, disrupt and eliminate all forms of racism in sport in Winnipeg through multiple activities, including: a research project, presentations, stakeholder training, public awareness, and the Anti-Racism in Sport Accord.\n\nThe Anti-Racism in Sport Accord commitments are basic actions that require goals to guide organizations to becoming fully anti-racist, including education and training, accountability, and awareness and action. The City is a signatory on the Accord, which launched on April 21, 2022.\n\nCanadian Centre for Child Protection\n\nThe Community Services Department is committed to working with the Canadian Centre for Child Protection (C3P) in order to ensure best practices and enhance our overall image and awareness in the area of child protection.\n\nThe Canadian Centre for Child Protection has been instrumental in assisting Community Services with preparing staff training, protocols and procedures, the development of a public awareness campaign, and in the direct delivery of staff training.\n\nWith the rollout of this partnership in 2016, Winnipeg was designated as the first jurisdiction in Canada to create a plan that focuses explicitly on the prevention of child sexual exploitation and the establishment of safe environments for children within municipal recreation and library facilities.\n\nPrograms and services enhanced by this initiative: all recreation, aquatics and library programs and facilities\n\nFor more information, visit Canadian Centre for Child Protection.\n\nEveryone Can Play Guide:\n\nA Guide to Winnipeg Recreation and Sports Subsidies\n\nThe Everyone Can Play Guide is available to ensure all children and youth have equal opportunities to experience the benefits of participating in sport and recreation.\n\nFor more information, visit Everyone Can Play - A Guide to Winnipeg Recreation and Sport Subsidies.\n\nHIGH FIVE® – Principles of Healthy Child Development\n\nThe City of Winnipeg is a registered municipality with HIGH FIVE®.\n\nHIGH FIVE training provides organizations with nationally-recognized certification that will assist them in working with children's programs in the sport and recreation community, and helps ensure that every child has a positive sport and recreation experience.\n\nRecreation Services Division employees apply the HIGH FIVE - Five Principles to our programs in order to provide quality experiences to participants, and support the safety, well-being and healthy development of children.\n\nWe also use the HIGH FIVE Quality Experience Scanning Tools (Quest), which were developed to provide organizations with practical, well-balanced tools for assessing and improving the quality of children’s developmental experience in recreation and sport activities.
