        "text": "A little bit about Hi-Five Doughnuts...\n\nJust like our namesake, Hi-Five Doughnuts is a friendly hands-on celebration of sweet indulgence and local pride.\n\nOwners Annie Harlow and Leslie Wilson began their journey in 2013 with two tables and a tent. Saving all their dough, the Ladies of The Morning built their food truck, Shelby, in 2014. Their ultimate goal was to build a storefront that would make Louisville proud. This dream was accomplished with the development known as Butcherblock, located on E. Main Street in Louisville, Kentucky. After six years in Butchertown, Hi-Five Doughnuts moved to 1940 Harvard Drive in the Historic Douglass Loop.\n\nAt Hi-Five, customers can build their own creations with a number of glazes and toppings to choose from. In addition to building your own doughnut, you can also choose one of the many staples we have become known for...Kentucky Fried Buttermilk Chicken Doughnut, the Bourbon Caramel with Bacon, or our Sugah Doughnut.\n\nNamed as one of the top Food Trucks in the South by Southern Living, the Ladies of the Morning are eager for the next step in their doughnut adventure."
