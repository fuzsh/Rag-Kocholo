        "text": "1) My boat is primarily used for wakeboarding, I tow riders and myself at 20-22mph. When riders and I used a hard edge away from the boat it slows the boat down and I am trying to alleviate having to feather the throttle for other drivers. They can't seem to get it just right when I am being towed, and its annoying being yanked around from 18-25mph. I am 6'3\" 200lbs and riders are around the same weight or a little less.\n\n2) Factory Volvo aluminum 3 blade.\n\n3) 14.3 x 21.\n\n4) WOT - 4800rpms - Average load on boat, 4-5 people and tops out at 48-50mph. Myself and 1/4 of fuel 4800rpms and 52-54mph. Not looking for awesome top end performance.\n\n5) 2010 Volvo Penta 4.3L GL ( SX-A) - 190hp\n\n6) 2010 Glastron GT 205XL ( 20' 8\" 2900lbs)\n\nI know they are quite pricey, but figured if it help grab the water more and reduce this issue then its money well spent.\n\nRe: High-five for Volvo 4.3GL\n\nIf the motor stays at say 2500 rpm and you slow down then yes a multi blade prop will enhance low speed stabiliy. But i suspect your motor is slowing down due to the strain of the load right along with your speed.\n\nThe one thing you can do is drop prop size say to a 18-19 four blade and see if the motor can pull the load with that \"gearing\". Its just like shifitng down in gears with a manual tranny and pulling a hill....You have to find the right gear for the speed and load you wish to pull....\n\nSolas makes some nice inexpensive 4 blades you can experiment with\n\nRe: High-five for Volvo 4.3GL\n\nIt seems like different message boards like different props. I have seen a MB that loves the Enertia ( as do I) and some really like the High-Five and iBoats seem to like Solarius progs.\n\nIt could be that the extra pull is working to drop you off planing speed. If this is the case a High-Five would help. With a High_Five and smart tabs I can stay on plan while towing a wakeboard or kneebord at 18-22 mph. With the High-Five and Samrt tabs I very seldom have to touch the throttle where as before it was a fight to matain speed from 18-20. The High-Five will cost you 2-4 mph on the top end. The difference between the Enertia and High-Five is 4-5 mph top end. The Enertia has just about the same pull as the 5 blade but I cant stay on plan as slow with it, so the 5 is on the boat 90% of the time.\n\nGood Luck\n\nDave\n\nRe: High-five for Volvo 4.3GL\n\nIt seems like different message boards like different props.

But youve added one huge variable \"Tabs\" they will lift a boat out of the hole and on plane much more effeciently than a prop...but you loose most of your wake theres always a price. Enertia are great props just not so cost effective...Now if they were 300 a pop im sure you would see much more activity id love to run one in a 22 just to see if it outruns my Solas but there 22 is a 3.5 inch barrel and my sx drive doesnt respond well to that size\n\nRe: High-five for Volvo 4.3GL\n\nVery good points about the trim tabs. I have the 80lb units and use the #1 spot (lowest pressure) with the High-Five and 2-3 with the Enertia. There is lot of difference between the lift of the two. If I were ask I woud have to guess the High-Five is about 25% of the difference and the tabs about 75%, but this is just a wag.\n\nTail_Gunner if you ever want to try a 21 Enertia, I would be more then happy to let ya try mine, I am just across the river from you It works great on SX drives.\n\nDave\n\nRe: High-five for Volvo 4.3GL\n\nVery good points about the trim tabs.
