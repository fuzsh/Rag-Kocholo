Located on Waterfront Drive in Winnipeg, Canada. Commission: City of Winnipeg\n\nDepending on your movement and perspective the piece changes meaning and scale — when the viewer is moving past it on the road it looks like wings in formation; when the viewer is across from it, the piece visually shifts into an abstract human hand. The targets can be hit by a home run – they also transform into roundels on a wing or fingerprints on a hand."
