        "text": "The Built, Not Bought Company!\n\nFactory Five Racing was founded in 1995. Over the years we have grown from a start-up business in a small garage to become the world’s largest manufacturer of \"build-it-yourself\" component car kits. We employ a full-time crew of about 40 people, and are located in Wareham, Massachusetts (about an hour south of Boston). We make our products right here in the USA, in the heart of New England where American manufacturing was born.\n\nXTF Pre-Runner Truck is a \"Build-It-Yourself\" Raptor on Steroids\n\nIntroducing the Factory Five XTF Pre-Runner Truck kit! Take your 2015-2020 Ford F-150 and turn it into an off-road beast with our full tubular chassis, long travel suspension and super wide 90” complete body package! This new kit is the ULTIMATE upgrade for your F-150 Truck, and you can order it now! We are scheduling production dates for August 2023 and later.\n\nType 65 Coupe — One of the Most Unique and\n\nStunning Shapes in Automotive History\n\nDesigned to be an accurate replica of the original 1965 World Championship Coupe, the Type 65 Coupe was made to capture the look and feel of the original 200 mph GT cars, but also use today’s engineering to make it more reliable and comfortable.\n\nThe Factory Five Mk4 Roadster is the world's best-selling, best-engineered, and best-performing replica of all time.\n\nThere is no better way to honor a legacy than to continue it. The Mk4 Roadster is designed to accurately reproduce the looks of the legendary 427 Cobra*, keeping its essence intact, while using modern technology, parts, and materials to improve performance, reliability, and comfort.\n\nThe Award-Winning Factory Five '33 Hot Rod\n\nA beautiful machine whose handling and performance match its good looks, our '33 Hot Rod has garnered a slew of awards and industry recognition, redefining what a modern hot rod build can be.\n\nPeriod-Correct Wicked Fast '35 Truck!\n\nThe all-new Factory Five '35 Hot Rod Pick-Up Truck delivers renowned Factory Five handling and performance, but in a cool, period-correct cruiser. Cool features like a bench seat, functional 5' truck bed, traditional doors and cab. Vintage style on the outside, and with a curb weight of 2,380 lbs., it is wicked fast!\n\nFactory Five and BluePrint Engines\n\nFactory Five uses BluePrint Engines in our cars. The crew at BluePrint Engines have designed several drop-in engine/transmission packages for Factory Five customers. If you have our Factory Five kit, BluePrint will sell you the running gear needed to finish your car. Brand-new, reasonably priced, high-performance, drop-in engines that are dyno-tested with full warranty and ready to run."
