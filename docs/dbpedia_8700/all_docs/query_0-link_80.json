        "text": "Why is the Northwest Angle Part of Minnesota?\n\nThis curious geographic anomaly remains in Minnesota due to an erroneous map consulted while drafting the Treaty of Paris in 1783. As part of negotiations to conclude the American Revolution, Great Britain recognized and approved a boundary between America and Canada that ran from the East Coast to the Mississippi River.\n\nWhile determining America's northern border, negotiators worked off a map from 1755 that incorrectly showed Lake of the Woods as being smaller and differently shaped than it actually is. This caused cartographers to believe Lake of the Woods, and, by extension, the Northwest Angle, were adjacent to the Mississippi Headwaters.\n\nIt wasn’t until 1798 that a British explorer proved the Headwaters was not actually connected to Lake of the Woods, and it wasn’t until 1842 that the lake’s actual northernmost point was established and properly plotted. But by that point it was too late. While the area was not considered to be economically valuable to the U.S., the government was reluctant to give up anything gained in the treaty that proclaimed independence from Britain.\n\nAnd so, the Northwest Angle—surrounded by water and Canadian land on all sides—remains part of Minnesota and the U.S.\n\nHow to Reach the Northwest Angle\n\nVisiting the Northwest Angle takes a bit of preplanning, and there are multiple ways to go about it. There’s effort involved in visiting this northernmost Minnesotan output, but as is usually the case, the reward is more than worthwhile. Because the Angle is so remote, reaching this far-flung location is an adventure unto itself.\n\nBoat, Snowmobile or Drive Across the Lake\n\nTo reach the Northwest Angle without going through Canada, take a boat, track vehicle or snowmobile across Minnesota’s portion of Lake of the Woods. Some of the Angle’s resorts can provide transportation in these ways to registered guests. Lake of the Woods Passenger Service offers rides for most of the year, as well—by boat in summer, or bombardier in winter. Depending on the conditions, some winters you may also be able to drive across the lake on an ice road.\n\nDrive through Canada\n\nThe route through Manitoba to the Angle is a lovely one, full of wilderness and wildlife and using both tar and gravel roads. Entering the Angle through Canada requires crossing the Canadian border coming and going. To do that, be ready to show a passport or other form of approved, border-crossing identification.\n\nSummer Activities\n\nFishing\n\nGiven its location on Lake of the Woods, the walleye capital of the world, it’s not surprising that fishing is a major activity here. Fish frequently caught here include walleye, pike, perch, bass, muskie and occasionally burbot. Many of the resorts in the area offer guide services that come with decades of fishing experience.\n\nGolf\n\nThe Angle is home to the Northwest Angle Country Club, a 9-hole golf course that has a view of the lake and seven sand greens. The sand greens are groomed regularly and are usually firm enough to putt on.\n\nBirding\n\nThe remote nature of this part of the state makes it a good habitat for a wide variety of birds. Birders can spot eagles, hawks, osprey, American kestrel, falcons, terns and piping plovers, among others.\n\nHunting\n\nWhite-tailed deer are prevalent here, and there are abundant opportunities to hunt bears, grouse and other waterfowl.\n\nHistory\n\nAt one time, several hundred people lived in this area, expecting it to be an important trading route. There’s a cemetery that exists from that time. Ancient native petroglyphs called Painted Rocks can be seen on the lake. People can visit Massacre Island, where 21 explorers were killed by Dakota Native Americans who believed they’d sold guns to the tribe's enemies. A Jesuit cross marks the site today."
