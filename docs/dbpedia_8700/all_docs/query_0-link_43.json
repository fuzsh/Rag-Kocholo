Adopt these 5 fuel-efficient driving techniques to lower your vehicle’s fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions by as much as 25%.\n\n1. Accelerate gently\n\nThe harder you accelerate the more fuel you use. In the city, you can use less fuel by easing onto the accelerator pedal gently. To be as fuel-efficient as possible, take 5 seconds to accelerate your vehicle up to 20 kilometres per hour from a stop. Imagine an open cup of coffee on the dashboard. Don’t spill it!\n\n2. Maintain a steady speed\n\nWhen your speed dips and bursts, you use more fuel, and spend more money, than you need to. Tests have shown that varying your speed up and down between 75 and 85 km per hour every 18 seconds can increase your fuel use by 20%.\n\nConsider using cruise control for highway driving, where conditions permit. Be mindful, however, that little variations in speed can actually be good when gravity does the work. Where traffic patterns permit, allow your speed to drop when you travel uphill, then regain your momentum as you roll downhill.\n\n3. Anticipate traffic\n\nLook ahead while you’re driving to see what is coming up. And keep a comfortable distance between your vehicle and the one in front of you. By looking closely at what pedestrians and other cars are doing, and imagining what they’ll do next, you can keep your speed as steady as possible and use less fuel. It’s also safer to drive this way.\n\n4. Avoid high speeds\n\nKeep to the speed limit and save on fuel! Most cars, vans, pickup trucks and SUVs are most fuel-efficient when they’re travelling between 50 and 80 km per hour. Above this speed zone, vehicles use increasingly more fuel the faster they go.\n\nFor example, at 120 km per hour, a vehicle uses about 20% more fuel than at 100 km per hour. On a 25-km trip, this spike in speed – and fuel consumption – would cut just two minutes from your travel time.\n\n5. Coast to decelerate\n\nEvery time you use your brakes, you waste your forward momentum. By looking ahead at how traffic is behaving, you can often see well in advance when it’s time to slow down. You will conserve fuel and save money by taking your foot off the accelerator and coasting to slow down instead of using your brakes.\n\nTake the free online ecoDriving course to learn more about how fuel-efficient driving can help you save money and reduce your greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nMore ways to use less fuel\n\nHere are more easy ways you can reduce your fuel consumption and costs:\n\nAvoid idling your vehicle\n\nTurn off your engine when you’re stopped for more than 60 seconds, except when in traffic. The average vehicle with a 3-litre engine wastes 300 millilitres (over 1 cup) of fuel for every 10 minutes it idles.\n\nMeasure your tire pressure every month\n\nDriving a vehicle with tires under-inflated by 56 kilopascals (8 pounds per square inch) can increase fuel consumption by up to 4%. It can also reduce the life of your tires by more than 10,000 kilometres. Find the right tire pressure for your vehicle on the tire information placard. It’s usually on the edge of the driver’s door or doorpost. Learn more about tire maintenance.\n\nUse a manual transmission properly\n\nPay attention to the tachometer, which shows engine speed. Use it to know when to shift a manual transmission for the best fuel efficiency. The higher the rpm, the more fuel the engine is burning. So shift through the lower gears smoothly and quickly, and build up speed in the higher gears.\n\nDon’t carry unnecessary weight\n\nRemove items such as salt, sand and sports equipment from your vehicle. The less it weighs, the less fuel your vehicle will use. The fuel consumption of a mid-size car increases by about 1% for every 25 kilograms of weight it carries.\n\nRemove roof or bicycle racks\n\nStreamline your vehicle by taking off the racks when you’re not using them. Aerodynamic drag can increase fuel consumption by as much as 20% on the highway.\n\nUse air conditioning sparingly\n\nAir conditioning can increase a vehicle’s fuel consumption by as much as 20%. Open the windows when you’re driving in the city, and use the flow-through ventilation system with the windows up on the highway. If you do use air conditioning, use the re-circulate option. It will minimize the impact.\n\nUse a fuel consumption display\n\nSee the impact of the 5 fuel-efficient driving techniques firsthand with the help of a fuel consumption display, a feature now standard on many vehicles. (Some newer vehicles come equipped with even more sophisticated displays that analyze speed variations, shift points for manual transmissions, and driving behaviours such as acceleration and braking times.)\n\nMany drivers consume 15% less fuel by acting on the feedback that fuel consumption displays provide.\n\nTrack your fuel consumption\n\nHow long can you go without filling your tank? Two weeks? A month?\n\nChallenge yourself to refill as seldom as possible and your monthly costs will come down.\n\nPlan ahead\n\nMap out your route, especially if it’s long\n\nListen to traffic reports and avoid accidents, road construction and other trouble spots\n\nAvoid roads that cut through major cities and are dotted with stoplights, intersections and pedestrians\n\nUse four-lane highways when you can\n\nCombine trips\n\nLonger excursions let your vehicle’s engine warm up to its most fuel-efficient temperature.\n\nRun your errands one after the other\n\nPlan your route to avoid backtracking and rush-hour traffic\n\nDrive less\n\nThe best way reduce fuel consumption is to drive less.\n\nWalk or bike to your destination. You’ll use no fuel and have a healthier lifestyle\n\nUse public transit\n\nJoin a car or van pool. You and your group will save fuel and avoid emitting tonnes of air pollutants a year\n\nWork from home when you can. Every day you telecommute reduces the amount of fuel you use by 20%\n\nChallenge yourself\n\nCommitted to saving money and shrinking your environmental footprint?
