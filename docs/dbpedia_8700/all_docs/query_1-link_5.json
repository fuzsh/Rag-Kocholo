        "text": "\"Everyone's a good bunch. Canadians are a good bunch.\" Comedian and actor Jonny Harris has crisscrossed the country visiting 105 (!) small towns to meet residents and learn how they thrive despite economic and social challenges.\n\nDive into small-town Canada to see why these towns are still standing.\n\nAmherstburg, Ont. (Season 9)\n\nFor 100 years, Amherstburg was famous for its amusement park; when the park closed, locals turned to a new attraction that will never go out of style: Amherstburg's remarkable heritage. Watch\n\nAvondale, N.L. (Season 3)\n\nAvondale, N.L.'s fishing and railway industries have come and gone, and the town has become a pit stop on the road to somewhere else. However, that's all changing with the construction of Eastbound Park, a world-class NASCAR racing facility, which is going to give people from all over the world a new reason to visit the town. Watch\n\nBamfield, B.C. (Season 1)\n\nJonny befriends a local socialite with a cannon, narrowly survives a fake Tsunami and discovers the true meaning of hard-core community. Watch\n\nBear River, N.S.(Season 6)\n\nWithout any industry or formal government, making it in Bear River requires a sense of enterprise, a communal spirit, and a touch of the outlaw. Watch\n\nBerwick, N.S. (Season 1)\n\nAs the residents of Berwick, Nova Scotia demonstrate, if you shake the barrel, the big apples will rise to the top. Watch\n\nBotwood, N.L. (Season 6)\n\nBotwood has been working to revive industry and lure former residents back home ever since the closure of a nearby mill shut down their busy port. Watch\n\nBristol, Que. (Season 5)\n\nFor years, Bristol had a reputation as a vacation destination, boasting a growing cottage community, a number of hotels and a legendary dancehall scene. But changing tastes and a shifting economy brought about by the disappearance of its logging and mining industries have left Bristol looking to get its mojo back. Now, a new group of entrepreneurs is using the land in new and interesting ways in order to make Bristol a destination once more! Watch\n\nBuxton, Ont. (Season 1)\n\nJonny rings the liberty bell where freedom reigns in Buxton, Ontario, a town of great historical significance where formerly enslaved people settled after escaping the United States via The Underground Railroad. Watch\n\nCalabogie, Ont. (Season 5)\n\nEvery year, hundreds of thousands of people come to Calabogie to have a good time on the ski slopes, raceway, winding roads, and golf courses. But those who call Calabogie home year-round, have gone without a backbone industry since its days as a resource town in the 60's. That means if you want to stay after you play, it's the rule of C - Cobble together a series of jobs, create a new business, or commute. Watch\n\nCampobello Island, N.B. (Season 5)\n\nNew Brunswick's Campobello Island is Canadian more by chance than by geography. The only year round and direct access to the mainland is a bridge to the United States, which makes for a unique Canadian/American cultural blend and many challenges. Watch\n\nCap Pelé, N.B. (Season 6)\n\nIngenuity and resilience are hallmark traits of Cap-Pelé; a small, Acadian fishing Village in New Brunswick that has seen its fair share of struggles. Watch\n\nCanso, N.S.

Watch\n\nCarcross, Yukon (Season 4)\n\nCarcross has unexpectedly landed on the world stage. From the outside, the future looks bright, but only if the local community can figure out how to welcome the outside world while protecting their land and traditional way of life. Watch\n\nChemainus, B.C. (Season 7)\n\nThings looked bad for Chemainus when its sawmill closed in 1983; the town used gorgeous murals to draw in tourists, but now it's looking for the next generation of visionaries to keep it on the map. Watch\n\nChurchill, Man. (Season 5)\n\nIn May 2017, the Polar Bear Capital of the World unexpectedly became a fly-in community. A year of skyrocketing costs and unemployment are taking their toll but the community continues to hang on by its Northern grit, ingenuity and community spirit. Watch\n\nCobalt, Ont. (Season 4)\n\nCobalt was founded during one of the greatest silver mining booms in history. Now, after a decades-long slump, Cobalt is hopeful they can make good on their namesake and strike it rich mining cobalt. Mining made the town, and Cobalters, believe that mining will save it. Watch\n\nColeman, Alta. (Season 1)\n\nJonny digs up the dirt on the Rocky Mountain mining town of Coleman, Alberta. Watch\n\nDawson City, Yukon (Season 9)\n\nDawson City's claim to fame is the Klondike Gold Rush, which attracted tourists from far and wide; the COVID pandemic put a stop to this thriving industry, but the town is struggling to bounce back. Watch\n\nEast Preston, N.S. (Season 5)\n\nEast Preston, NS is one of Canada's oldest indigenous black communities, with a history that begins more than a hundred years before Canada itself. Stigma and stereoytypes have lead to waves of encroachment from neighbouring suburbs that literally threatens to wipe this community's story off the map. In response, East Prestonians are doubling down on education, community support and empowerment of both young and old, ensuring that their community and its history will thrive for generations to come. Watch\n\nEdgerton, Alta. (Season 3)\n\nAs Edgerton, AB's local machine industry shut down, so did almost all the other businesses that served the area's farmers and their families. But in 2012, a group of childhood friends hoping to reverse the tide opened Ribstone Creek Brewery, in the hopes of getting the town back on its feet again. Watch\n\nEganville, Ont. (Season 2)\n\nWhile the surrounding areas flourish from the Ottawa Valley tech boom, Eganville has been left behind to struggle with empty storefronts, a dwindling population, and passing motorists who see little reason to stop. Since spike strips aren't \"tourist-friendly,\" the town is hoping its majestic white water river will float peoples' boats enough to get them out of their cars.Watch\n\nFenelon Falls, Ont. (Season 7)\n\nFor decades, Fenelon Falls made wood products, from lumber to Tinker Toys — until the industry moved on; now the town is becoming a vibrant destination for newcomers, cottagers, and day-trippers alike. Watch\n\nFogo Island, N.L. (Season 1)\n\nAn island off an island at the edge of a continent. Jonny takes the ferry to the edge of the earth, rugged Fogo Island, Newfoundland. Watch\n\nFort Colounge, Que. (Season 2)\n\nFort Coulonge QC was once a thriving logging town whose famous white pine helped build great cities like Chicago and New York, and whose way of life helped inspire great fashion like with Hipsters.

With that will come a boost in tourism and employment opportunities - a welcome change from a decade of decline. Watch\n\nFraser Lake, B.C. (Season 4)\n\nThe people of Fraser Lake recently took a one-two punch: they lost both their largest employer and their only grocery store. But the people in this hidden gem of a town have grit for days and they are going above and beyond to take care of their own. Watch\n\nGander, N.L. (Season 9)\n\nGander, Newfoundland, has become \"The Crossroads of the World\" once again thanks to new businesses, new residents, and newfound fame due to a hit Broadway musical. Watch\n\nGeorgetown, P.E.I. (Season 2)\n\nThe beautiful harbour community of Georgetown, P.E.I. works hard to keep itself looking ship-shape despite their poor financial state. Like a college student that spends all their loan money on nice clothes. There is hope that a wave of tourism is on the horizon, and Georgetown plans to be ready when its proverbial, and literal, ships come in! Watch\n\nGilbert Plains, Man. (Season 3)\n\nGilbert Plains, MB a once-bustling rural town and farming community, has been suffering from decades of severe population decline, unpredictable weather, and constant financial risk.

Watch\n\nGracefield, Que.

Watch\n\nGravelbourg, Sask. (Season 5)\n\nLike many rural communities in Canada, Gravelbourg is facing an uphill economic battle that has led to outmigration, and along with it a significant decline in French culture. But in recent years, more than 16 different nationalities have settled in the town including German, Korean, African, Lao, and Spanish people, and it's this growing international population in Gravelbourg that is helping maintain the local economy and keeping the town on the map. Watch\n\nHarbour Grace, N.L. (Season 5)\n\nHarbour Grace has been the homeport of pirates, the launch pad of Amelia Earhart and one of the most prosperous towns in NL (2nd only to St John's). But now, after a string of bad luck, Harbour Grace is a shadow of what it once was.
