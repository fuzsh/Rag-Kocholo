        "text": "Hey there, happy National High Five Day! Can you believe we’re celebrating the art of the high five? It’s wild to think about, but did you know that it’s always the third Thursday in April? Seems like a random choice, right? Well, stick around, because I’ve got a little idea brewing. How about we move it to October 2nd instead? Here’s why…\n\nNow, let’s rewind a bit. Picture this: it’s 1977, and the Dodgers are wrapping up their season. Dusty Baker and Glenn Burke, former teammates, decide to do something a little different during their last game together. They smack hands in celebration, and boom—the high five is born! If you haven’t seen the iconic photo of that moment, you’re missing out. ESPN even made a whole “30 for 30” short film about it!\n\nBut let’s be real, folks. As awesome as that first high five was, we’ve all had our fair share of high five fails. (Don’t worry, you’re not alone.) Ever found yourself awkwardly missing the mark or accidentally going for a fist bump instead? Yeah, been there, done that. Thankfully, HowToBeADad.com has come to the rescue with a step-by-step guide to perfecting the high five.\n\nSo, here are the golden rules to ensure you never botch a high five again:\n\nGet your hand ready: Form a nice, flat surface with your fingers together. No one likes a weak high five with fingers all over the place. Pro tip: try cupping your hand slightly for an extra satisfying smack.\n\nSignal the high five: No need to shout it from the rooftops, but make sure both parties are on the same page. Eye contact is key—no accidental fist bumps or awkward hugs allowed. It’s all about commitment!\n\nKeep calm and sync up: Take a deep breath and go with the flow. This isn’t a frantic swat at a pesky bug—it’s a high five. Smooth and steady wins the race.\n\nFocus on the elbow: This one’s crucial. Instead of staring at your friend’s hand like a deer in headlights, lock onto their elbow. Your brain will do the rest, guiding your hand to the perfect spot for a solid connection. Trust me, it works like a charm, especially for those on-the-go high fives.\n\nSo, there you have it—your crash course in high five mastery. Next time you go in for a high five, remember these tips and knock it out of the park. After all, life’s too short for awkward high fives, am I right?"
