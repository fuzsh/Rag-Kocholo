The first of the band's three sessions was repeated as a best of year selection at the end of 1982.\n\nFounder member Phil Hayes had continuing ties with Peel as the driving force behind Liverpool's celebrated Picket venue, which the Merseyside DJ was happy to support.[1] During one visit to Peel Acres, Hayes was apparently asked by Peel to autograph his copy of the only High Five LP.[2]\n\nAfter Peelâ€™s death, Hayes and Peter Hooton of The Farm were responsible for organising the John Peel World Cup, an annual tribute five-a-side charity football tournament held from 2008 as part of Liverpool Sound City.[3]\n\nFestive Fifty Entries[]\n\nNone\n\nSessions[]\n\nThree sessions.
