        "text": "Speeding and aggressive driving put your life and the lives of others in danger, and it’s never worth it. Learn about the risks and penalties.\n\nOn this page Skip this page navigation\n\nAggressive driving\n\nAggressive and high-risk driving have no place on the road. This includes:\n\nspeeding\n\ntailgating or following too closely\n\ncutting off other drivers, or cutting in front and then slowing down\n\nrefusing to yield the right of way\n\nhonking repeatedly, or for no reason\n\nrunning red lights\n\nexcessive lane changes or weaving through traffic\n\npassing too close to cyclists\n\nstopping on a pedestrian crosswalk at an intersection\n\nStunt driving and street racing\n\nStunt driving and street racing are dangerous and illegal.\n\nStunt driving includes:\n\ndriving 40 kilometres per hour or more over the speed limit on roads with a speed limit less than 80 kilometres per hour\n\ndriving 50 kilometres per hour or more over the speed limit\n\ndriving in a way that prevents other vehicles from passing\n\nintentionally cutting off another vehicle\n\nintentionally driving too close to another vehicle, pedestrian or fixed object\n\nDrivers caught driving 150 kilometres per hour or more are subject to stunt driving charges. This applies anywhere in the province, including sections of freeways with limits of 110 kilometres per hour.\n\nStreet racing includes:\n\ntwo or more motor vehicles driving in a way that indicates the drivers are competing\n\nchasing another motor vehicle\n\nchanging lanes repeatedly at a high rate of speed and weaving through traffic\n\nYou can find a full list of aggressive and high-risk behaviours that are considered stunt driving or street racing in the O. Reg. 455/07 of the Highway Traffic Act (HTA).\n\nRisks of speeding\n\nThe faster you drive, the higher your risk of losing control and being involved in a crash, which can be fatal or cause serious injury.\n\nThe risk of fatality or serious injury is 11 times higher in collisions at 50 kilometres per hour or more over a speed limit of 100 kilometres per hour, than when vehicles are involved in a collision while driving at, or below, the posted limit (2013-2017 Ontario data).\n\nThe laws of physics behind speeding affect everyone the same way. Speeding increases braking and stopping distances. It also reduces your field of vision, which makes it harder to react quickly to changing road conditions.\n\nPenalties\n\nDangerous driving behaviours are criminal offences under the Highway Traffic Act (HTA). Know the costs of speeding and aggressive driving – and the penalties you could face for it – before you get behind the wheel. The higher your speed, the bigger the risks and the higher the penalties.\n\nExcessive speed\n\nIf you are convicted of speeding, you may receive demerit points in addition to fines.\n\n3 points for going over the speed limit by 16 to 29 kilometres per hour\n\n4 points for going over the speed limit by 30 to 49 kilometres per hour\n\n6 points for going over the speed limit by 50 kilometres per hour or more\n\nThe fine will depend on how fast you were travelling over the posted speed limit:\n\nFines for driving over the speed limit (as of June 2020) How much over the speed limit Fine per kilometres per hour over the speed limit less than 20 kilometres per hour $3.00 20 to less than 30 kilometres per hour $4.50 30 to less than 50 kilometres per hour $7.00 50 kilometres per hour or more $9.75\n\nFor example, if you drive 40 kilometres per hour over the speed limit, you will be fined $7, times 40, for a total of $280.\n\nAggressive driving\n\nAggressive or careless drivers who put themselves and others at risk can be charged with careless driving. If you are convicted of careless driving, you can face:\n\nfines of up to $2,000\n\nsix demerit points\n\na maximum of six months in jail\n\na driver’s licence suspension of up to two years\n\nIf you are convicted of careless driving causing bodily harm or death you can face:\n\nfines from $2,000 to $50,000\n\nsix demerit points\n\na maximum of two years in jail\n\ncourts can impose a driver’s licence suspension of up to five years\n\na mandatory driver improvement course, upon conviction\n\nStunt driving or street racing\n\nDrivers who are involved in stunt driving or street racing are subject to:\n\nan immediate 30-day driver’s licence suspension\n\nan immediate 14-day vehicle impoundment at roadside (whether it is your vehicle or not)\n\na minimum fine of $2,000 and a maximum fine of $10,000\n\na jail term of up to six months\n\na post-conviction licence suspension of:\n\na minimum of one year and a maximum of three years for the first conviction\n\na minimum of three years and a maximum of 10 years for a second conviction\n\na lifetime suspension, reducible after 10 years under certain criteria, for a third conviction\n\na lifetime suspension, non-reducible, for a fourth and subsequent convictions\n\nsix demerit points\n\na mandatory driver improvement course, upon conviction\n\nOther penalties\n\nDrivers convicted of aggressive, careless or stunt driving will experience a substantial increase in their insurance rates or could become uninsurable.\n\nNovice drivers will face at least a 30-day licence suspension and possible licence cancellation for any conviction for the following offences:\n\nspeeding 30 kilometres per hour or more over the speed limit\n\nfollowing too closely\n\ncareless driving\n\nfail to remain at the scene of a collision\n\nstunt driving\n\nStay alert and drive safely\n\nBefore you leave on your trip\n\nDon't drive when you feel tired, nervous, stressed or overly emotional, such as after an argument or hearing bad news.\n\nAvoid being rushed by leaving earlier.\n\nCheck traffic and road conditions before you leave.\n\nWhen you’re driving\n\nBe patient when traffic is delayed and minimize lane changes.\n\nAllow other drivers to merge or change lanes.\n\nAvoid distractions while driving.\n\nAvoid emotional conversations with passengers.\n\nIf your device is safely attached to the vehicle, you can check traffic in real time on apps such as:\n\nOntario 511\n\nGoogle Maps\n\nWaze\n\nMaintain adequate following distance.\n\nUse turn signals, it’s mandatory.\n\nUse your high beam lights responsibly.\n\nTap your horn if you must (but no long blasts with accompanying hand gestures).\n\nBe considerate in parking lots -- park in one spot, not across multiple spaces.\n\nDo not use your cell phone or other electronic devices when you are driving. Learn more about distracted driving.\n\nIf you’re a passenger\n\nIf your driver is going too fast or is too reckless, ask them to slow down. If they don't listen, ask them to let you out in a safe place where you can call someone to pick you up.\n\nSpeaking up can help you and your friends stay alive.\n\n18% of passengers killed in fatal crashes in 2017 were between the age of 16 and 24 years old.
