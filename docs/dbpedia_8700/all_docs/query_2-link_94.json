        "text": "Nearest HI5 Redemption Center\n\nThe Hawai‘i Deposit Beverage Container Program (HI-5) is a State of Hawai‘i funded program that places a 5¢ redeemable deposit on each qualified beverage container. Why throw away your recyclables when the HI-5 program has more than 15 convenient redemption centers island wide. Just look for the HI 5¢ label on your glass, plastic and metal containers, and take them to any redemption center to get cash back and help protect the environment at the same time.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\nNO CAPS: Please remove the caps from the bottles. Pursuant to Hawai’i Administrative Rules Section 11-282-61, caps should not be included when redeeming by weight. Also caps may be made of different materials and currently not collected for recycling by Hawai`i County. Please toss your caps in the rubbish.\n\nLook for the HI-5 mark on beverage containers: soft drinks, soda, juice, tea, coffee drinks, water, beer, malt beverages, mixed spirits and wine coolers in metal, glass or plastic containers up to 68 fluid ounces.\n\nThey must be empty of liquid and debris removed.\n\nPlease leave the HI-5 label visible on beverage containers, usually located on the top of aluminum cans and the container label on the plastic and glass bottles. If the label falls off, it can be placed inside the container with the HI-5 label visible.\n\nPlease separate your containers prior to arriving at the recycling center. Containers must be separated by type: glass, plastic, aluminum, bi-metal.\n\nSAVE SPACE!
