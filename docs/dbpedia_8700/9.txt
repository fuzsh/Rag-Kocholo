Description

-Named High Five because Terry and Jim high fived each other about what an incredible boar he is. After just seconds of Jim driving him around the barn, we knew we had to grab him out of the NSR's Draft. On the sandy drive, in the dry dirt you can see where the front foot leaves and the hind leg follows and he is flawlessly structured. For a boar with this fat of a hind leg, this massive of a rib cage, this much spread down his back to be able to motor like he does is only one thing... generations of pedigree planning by the Rodibaugh family. High Five is absolutely a boar that you will want to tie into.
