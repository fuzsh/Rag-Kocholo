Manchester Museum is the UK’s leading university Museum with extraordinary natural history and humanities collections and typically welcoming over 500,0000 visitors annually. Dedicated to twin goals of building understanding between cultures and a more sustainable world, our vision is to become the world’s most inclusive, imaginative and caring museum and relevant to the diverse communities we serve.

hello future is Manchester Museum’s exciting £13.5 million transformation and will create a new Exhibition Hall, South Asia Gallery, Chinese Culture Gallery, the world’s first Centre for Age Friendly Culture, and a new entrance with visitor facilities that focus on inclusive accessible design.

The Portico Library is a 214-year-old independent subscription library and exhibitions space in central Manchester. Still housed in its original purpose-built Regency-period venue, it opens free to the public six days a week for exhibitions and events complementing its unique collection of books, archives and illustrations that spans over 450 years. All visitors can enjoy a meal or drink in the cafe and participate in the Library’s writing, research, arts and conservation programmes.

Early members and associates included Thesaurus inventor Peter Mark Roget, Prime Minister Robert Peel, author Elizabeth Gaskell, Guardian newspaper founder John Edward Taylor and Anti-Corn Law League leader Richard Cobden, plus physician and anti-slavery campaigner John Ferriar, leading suffragette family the Pankhursts and James Heywood MP, who proposed and successfully fought for the introduction of public libraries in the UK.

Today, as well as a centre for learning and literature in the city, the Library is also home to The Portico Prize and the Portico Sadie Massey Awards for young readers and writers.
