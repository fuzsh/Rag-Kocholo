        "text": "The Manchester Science and Industry Museum\n\nUndoubtedly my favourite museum, mainly because it was the first museum I visited as a child and all those memories come flooding back every time I visit. I can pinpoint this as the place where my fascination with Manchester history began whilst participating in Victorian ‘activities’ during a school visit, a definite highlight which sparked my fascination… I have been hooked on history ever since! This is why museums are so important and it is vital that they remain a part of our cities… everyone has a different experience and a reason to enjoy them.\n\nThe Museum is devoted to the history of science, technology and industry with an in-depth emphasis upon Manchester’s contributions to these fields. The museum is split into numerous buildings with exhibits from different periods of history, from the Industrial Revolution to modern-day, some are permanent and some alternate throughout the year. The displays range from the theme of power: gas, electric, water and steam – transport: railway locomotives, aircraft and cars – sewage and sanitation, textiles and the emergence of the computer age… which was conceived right here in Manchester with the first ever computer. The majority of exhibits are interactive and that is why the museum is so popular – gone are the days where museums were filled with ‘DO NOT TOUCH’ signs… this place encourages you to be intrigued and creative. The museum is situated on the world’s first railway station – Manchester Liverpool Road railway station – to which there is still an operational steam train locomotive that you can ride on weekends, although its journey is dramatically shorter than the original locomotives that operated from it in the nineteenth-century but still a great experience.\n\n– For an added experience try and visit on a day when the exhibits are switched on, the train hall and the cotton rooms come to life, an experience like no other.\n\nMy top 5 exhibits:\n\nThe Gas Gallery:\n\nA personal highlight of all the exhibits that the museum has to offer, not only does it explore the history of gas supply but it also creates a smell of ‘gas’ throughout the exhibit that further engages the senses, it brings the reality of the gas lamps that once lit the streets of Victorian cities to life. The exhibit plays host to many of the early gas powered street lamps, tracing the history of how coal was used to create gas and in turn was used to light the Victorian cities. From the entrance area that is lined with gas street lamps is a replica of a town gasworks and various exhibits of gas appliances.\n\nUnderground Manchester Gallery:\n\nThe Gas gallery is the perfect transition into the Underground Manchester Galley, from the history of the Victorian cities at street level stems the history of the underground. With a replica sewer tunnel (minus the sewage) that you can walk through you get a sense of how the Victorians were innovative with their ideas by creating such an effective sewage system.\n\nThe exhibit explores the history behind the sewage system, the toilet, sink and bath, the health implications of unsanitary conditions and the benefits that clean water and effective sewage systems had upon the city and its inhabitants. Public health was a major problem during the nineteenth-century, a problem that the Victorians were not quick to solve with many diseases going untraced due to their lack of understanding, the nineteenth-century industrial city was a place where disease spread rapidly and life expectancy was low. The exhibit depicts these harsh realities with a replica Victorian funeral, where regardless of age, class or gender, diseases within the city claimed thousands of lives. Information boards are dotted around the exhibit describing these diseases, such as cholera, their effects and how they easily could have been prevented… in the majority of cases prevention was through clean water and effective sewer systems. You are transported through the history of this battle to ascertain a clean water supply for Manchester, from Roman times to modern-day, a massive valve that controlled the water flow from the Thirlmere Aqueduct resides by the exhibit and replicates the sheer undertaking and grandeur of the task to bring clean water to Manchester.\n\nThe Electricity Gallery:\n\nBack up by the Gas Exhibit is the Electricity Gallery that, similarly, explores the history of how electricity became a necessity, the leading energy source and the implications it had upon life in Manchester and other cities. The Gallery is host to numerous replica scenes of how electricity changed our lives, from living room settings, kitchens, to early electric machines and generators. You have the opportunity to power up some appliances as well as feasting your eyes upon the old-styled televisions sets, hairdryers, microwaves, fridges and lamps… if anything the Gallery perfectly displays how much technology has advanced when you compare them to your appliances at home.\n\nFrom first stepping foot into the Gas Gallery exploring the early power sources, to exploring the Electricity Gallery you come to the upmost exhibit which explores the pros and cons of modern-day power sources of nuclear power. The exhibits take you on a detailed and interactive experience from the nineteenth-century to modern-day, an unforgettable piece of history to explore.\n\nThe Power Hall:\n\nThe Power Hall resides in the original railway transit shed and has an impressive collection of locomotives and depicts the evolution of engines: from water powered to coal burning combustion engines that revolutionised industry forever.\n\nThe locomotives that are on display:\n\nSouth African Railways GL Class Garratt – Built in 1929 by Beyer, Peacock and Co.\n\nPakistan Railways – A broad gauge locomotive, also built by Beyer, Peacock and Co.\n\nEricsson’s Novelty – A replica of the original locomotive of 1829\n\nBritish Rail Class 77 – Ariadne – An electric locomotive built by Metropolitan-Vickers in 1953\n\nThe Museum appears to have a recurring theme throughout the majority of its exhibits and that is the importance and implications that the Industrial Revolution had upon cities such as Manchester, this is apparent in the Power Hall as it explores the history and rapid development of machines and their power sources. Steam power, in particular, was a vital aspect to the success of the Industrial Revolution as they powered the mill engines that created the materials, cotton in particular here in Manchester, and also powered the locomotives that transported these materials in such great quantity. The Power Hall is a great testament to the ingenuity and revolutionary thinking of the Victorians to create such machinery that changed every aspect of society as Manchester hurdled towards prosperity and greatness.\n\nThe engines that are on display are:\n\nA beam engine used at Haydock Colliery\n\nA 1907 McNaught engine from Firgrove Mill\n\nGalloways pumping engine\n\n30-tonne hydraulic accumulator\n\nAs well as host to several oil, hot-air and diesel engines\n\nThe Textiles Gallery:\n\nFrom the machines that drove the trains come the machines that drove the mills and cotton industry to unprecedented levels, pushing Manchester to the forefront of world trade and making it the ‘Powerhouse of the world’ during the Industrial Revolution. The hall is brought to life when the machines are switched on giving a small sense of what it must have been like to work within the nineteenth-century textile industry. As you weave between the gigantic machines and read of the real life stories of those who worked in the mills, witness the artworks that decorates the hall and walk through a replica merchant’s office the story of Victorian Manchester becomes much more vivid. The exhibit also offers you the opportunity to get involved by exploring different fabrics that were used, the properties of these different fabrics, try out braiding and weaving for yourself and witness yarn being spun and follow the process of dyeing, printing and recycling.\n\nSo there you go, my top 5 exhibits at the Manchester Science and Industry Museum, of course there is so much more that the museum has to offer and I would highly recommend that you spend an entire afternoon just exploring all of the exhibits, time well spent I assure you!"
