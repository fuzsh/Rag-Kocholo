        "text": "Today’s Story from the Museum Floor is a guest post by Sarah Scott, one of Manchester Museum’s volunteers who facilitate objects handling for our visitors, she also volunteers behind the scenes, transcribing the Egyptology Correspondence Archives.\n\nManchester Museum is undergoing a major transformation over the next few years and this is the first in a series of posts that will chart the development of the collection and the building, and how this links with both the city and people of Manchester.\n\nFor more information about volunteering at Manchester Museum, have a look at our website. And find out more here about Manchester Museum’s transformation!\n\n#MMHelloFuture\n\nManchester Museum and Early Modern Collecting\n\nManchester Museum is about to undergo a fantastic transformation. ‘Hello future’ will see the creation of two new permanent galleries, a South Asia gallery and a China gallery, along with a new temporary exhibition space. What we know today as Manchester Museum is a patchwork story of development and transformation in order to both display and store an ever expanding and diversifying collection. The impetus for each expansion of the museum reflects a timeline of the history of Manchester and beyond, telling a story of some of the city’s people. The story of the Museum’s collection, however, began a long time before the Museum that we all know and love was built.\n\nCabinets of curiosity and early modern collecting\n\nSamuel Alberti in his book ‘Nature and Culture: Objects, Disciplines and the Manchester Museum‘, describes the museum as unique, although he theorises that it is not unique in its uniqueness. Like many other British museums its origins are born from the human desire to collect and to classify material things.\n\nThe idea of ‘material culture’ emerged during the second half of the nineteenth century when vast ethnographic collections were transported to Britain and other European nations from their colonies. The nineteenth century museum was, however, rooted in a much older tradition of exhibition and display.\n\n‘Material Culture’ from the British punitive expedition to Benin City, 1897 (Image from Old Naija: Home of Nigerian History and Cultures)\n\nThe tradition of ‘cabinets of curiosity’, displaying both human cultures and natural history specimens, dates back to the early modern period (generally defined as late 15th to late 18th century). Western European exploration and colonisation facilitated contact with large areas of the world and the movement of objects across the globe, many of which were displayed in cabinets of curiosity. Curiosities and monstrosities were highly sought after as were relics consisting of human body parts. The growth in interest was partly due to the Scientific Revolution with inventions such as the microscope and telescope changing the ways in which the world was viewed and interpreted.\n\nEarly collectors were predominantly wealthy, powerful figures including, royalty, aristocracy and senior church officials. Objects were primarily collected as part of a religious narrative or as symbols of power. The idea of collecting gradually spread to include merchants, scholars, natural philosophers and physicians and likewise there became greater diversity in the reasons for collecting and in the collections themselves. Objects were split into two clearly defined categories, naturalia and artificialia. Although the objects displayed and their interpretation have changed dramatically, these categorisations remain in many 21st century collections including that of Manchester Museum where the building is divided into two distinct collections.\n\n‘Musei Wormiani Historia’, a depiction of Ole Worm’s cabinet of curiosities in 1665.\n\nFor the early modern collector, naturalia, typically included rocks, minerals and animals, or at least the parts of them that did not decompose; shells, horns and tusks. Primacy was given to oddities and abnormalities referred to as ‘wonders of nature’; ‘unicorn’ horns, conjoined twins and ‘monstrous births’. Artificialia included pottery, coins, paintings, sculpture, machines and scientific instruments. From the late sixteenth century, imperial expansion in Africa, Asia and the Americas produced ‘exotic’ imports. Colonisation provided access to worldwide cultures. Maritime trade routes, and trade itself, provided the mechanisms for the movement exotic goods and objects.\n\nThe concept of a cabinet of curiosity started as private collections, however as these outgrew the drawing room, purpose-built rooms and buildings began to be constructed allowing wider access. Designed to inspire wonder, Naturalia objects were chosen for their size, appearance and also their exotic provenance, and Artificialia objects for the artifice of their creation, value and rarity. Like their modern counterparts, cabinets of curiosity were educational, providing encyclopaedic knowledge, however the aim was predominantly knowledge of Divine creation through the creation of a microcosm of the universe created by God. During the seventeenth century religious narratives were beginning to be challenged by an emerging sceptical tradition rooted in the Scientific Revolution and for many, the proof of the existence of God came in the form of the diversity and harmony of life that could be evidenced in these displays.\n\nThe ‘Scientific Revolution’\n\nThe Scientific Revolution changed the ways in which European people understood the natural world with a move from Aristotelian ideas to new philosophies based on observations and experimentation. Collecting and classifying played an important role in these new ideas, and while many cabinets of curiosity perpetuated a religious narrative, they likewise could challenge these narratives. Many museum collections began life as cabinets of curiosity. The first ‘public’ museum opened in England opened in Oxford in 1683 when the cabinet of curiosities belonging to Elias Ashmole was bequeathed to the university.\n\nThe Early History of Manchester Museum and its collection\n\nThe origin of The Manchester Museum and its collection lies in the cabinet of curiosity of Manchester manufacturer and collector John Leigh Philips (1761-1814). Philips came from a wealthy Manchester family involved in textile manufacturing. He was commander of volunteer militia during French Revolutionary Wars and a prolific collector of natural history. After his death his ‘entomological and ornithological’ collection was purchased for £400 by a group who, in 1821, formed the Manchester Natural History Society. The society first opened a private library and museum in St. Ann’s Place for governors and subscribers and guests, before moving to premises in King Street.\n\nThe Manchester Natural History Museum on Peter Street (centre), with the Theatre Royale on the right. (Image from the Local History Collection at Manchester Libraries)\n\nIn 1835 the society moved to a new, larger, purpose built Neo-Grecian museum designed by Charles Barry in Peter Street costing about £4,000. In 1837 Richard Cobden became president of the society, and by the following year there were 433 ‘hereditary governors’, 9 honorary members, and 76 annual subscribers. In 1838 it was decided that the museum would be opened to the public and an admission fee of a shilling would be charged. The museum was also opened to school children for the first time. In 1839 receipts showed that in the previous year the museum admitted 1286 ‘strangers’ (middle-class non-subscribers), 97 ‘residents of Manchester’ and 144 ‘mechanics’. 25 ‘school children’ and 14 ‘Sunday scholars’ also visited at six pence and 3 pence respectively. The revenue continued to increase however due to the ‘elite character of the society being compromised’ annual subscriptions declined.\n\nIn 1850 the museum absorbed the collections of the Manchester Geological Society. The geological society had been founded in 1838 by Edward W. Binney, with the aim of creating a geological and palaeontological cabinet. The museum on Peter Street displayed objects including a large Ichthyosaur fossil donated by Unitarian reformer and philanthropist James Heywood (now on display in the ‘Fossils Gallery’ at Manchester Museum), a hexagonal basalt pillar from the Giant’s Causeway and models of famous diamonds. Although the two societies shared the same premises they continued to be governed separately.\n\nThe Museum Collections\n\nThe collections grew through purchases and donations. Many of the Museum’s iconic objects were displayed in the ‘curiosity room’ on the ground floor, they included:\n\n‘Mr Potter’s Cow’, the last individual of a herd of white polled cattle in Lancashire (currently in storage at Manchester Museum).\n\n‘Vizier‘, Napoleon’s Arabian charger, now on display at Musée de l’Armée, Paris.\n\n‘Asroni’, a coffin containing an Egyptian mummy donated by cotton merchants William and Robert Garnett (later known as Asru, and currently on display in Manchester Museum’s ‘Ancient Worlds’ gallery).\n\nA Peruvian mummy\n\nThe ‘Manchester mummy‘, the embalmed body of a local woman, Hannah Beswick, who reputedly feared being buried alive so much that she arranged for a surgeon to preserve her remains.\n\nMr Potter’s cow, and Vizier (Musée de l’Armée, Paris)\n\nThe presence of this ‘cabinet of curiosities’ reflected the expansive power of ‘extended natural history’ in Victorian Britain. Other displays at the museum were arranged in a more disciplined way with emphasis on chronology and classification. By the middle of the nineteenth century displays included: Geology, Mineralology, Vertebrate Zoology, Reptiles, Birds, Fish, Crustaceans, Insects and Corals. Classifications reflected contemporary ideas of taxonomy promoted by the British Museum.\n\nManchester’s history is intrinsically linked with that of science, technology and the industrial revolution. Part two will investigate the impact of industrialisation, the transfer of assets to Owen’s College, and the opening of a new museum on Oxford Road.\n\nSarah Scott"
