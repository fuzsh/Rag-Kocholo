Renaissance collectors described their cabinets of curiosities in print to augment their collections and enhance their own fame.1 Together with narratives penned by travellers who visited them, these texts became intimately bound up with the collections. In the centuries that followed, curators of the museums that absorbed the Wunderkammern continued to account for their provenance. When the Glasgow bibliophile and archaeologist David Murray set out to list this literature at the turn of the nineteenth century, it took him seven years. His Museums: Their History and Their Use (1904) remains the most comprehensive work of its kind – the ‘charter text’ of museum history.2 Murray’s timing was no accident. Museums in Europe and North America were then at their largest and most powerful. New buildings were bigger and more numerous than ever before; objects flooded into them at an unprecedented rate; and thanks to an increasingly public focus, more people visited them than ever before. In 1890, at the crest of this wave, the Manchester Museum opened its doors as the grand centrepiece of Owens College, later the University of Manchester. This book is an account of the Museum’s first 100 years. As such, it follows the tradition of single-institution histories that Murray listed, which has blossomed in the intervening century.3 However, Nature and Culture is also an experiment in museum historiography: using one particular institution as a methodological prism, I refract several distinct techniques in writing museum history to illuminate twentiethcentury sites for display more generally. Between 1950 and 1990, alongside the learned studies of individual museums, there emerged a number of different ways of studying collections more synthetically. The collections, staff and architecture all provided fruitful topics for historical analysis, often (but by no means always) written by those working within museums.4 But it was from the emerging field of museum studies in the early 1990s that the history of museums reached a coherent maturity. Eilean Hooper-Greenhill, Susan Pearce and Tony Bennett replaced earlier progressive historiographies with accounts of the multiple genealogies of collecting and collections, variously informed by structuralism, post-structuralism and post-colonialism.5 Museums were cast as political\n\nNature and culture\n\n2\n\ninstruments, machines for making meaning and imposing particular behaviours on their visitors. These approaches have been developed and refined by art historians, cultural theorists, anthropologists and historians of science.6 In the chapters that follow I apply existing museum historiographies to new territory, I enrol methods from elsewhere, and I propose novel techniques. These are adumbrated in this introduction, then applied to the Manchester Museum in the chapters that follow. But why choose this particular institution? And, indeed, why study a museum at all? Too often museologists take the latter for granted. It stands reiterating that museums play a very particular role in the production and consumption of Western knowledge, in the elucidation of identity and the organisation of material culture. We should always compare the museum as a site for the production of knowledge with the laboratory, the lecture hall and the field; and as a site for informal consumption with the theatre, the concert hall, the garden and the mass media. Furthermore, comparisons should be made not only between sites, but also across time. We have by now a clear understanding of the shifts in the function and role of the museum from its origins in the sixteenth century to its apogee at the end of the nineteenth, but we know far less about the fate of museums in the last eighty years or so. The Manchester Museum is an ideal candidate for understanding cultures of display in twentieth-century Britain. Founded and articulated at the fin de siècle, as a sizeable urban museum it is big enough to be significant but not so large as to be unrepresentative. It is an accredited museum, indicating a professional level of collections management and public service. Its collections are designated, and therefore of international importance. And at the time of writing the Museum is part of the North-West England ‘hub’, demonstrating its history of political clout and regional leadership.7 It boasts ancient mummies, exotic (dead) quadrupeds and spectacular (living) reptiles. The Manchester Museum is a treasure trove of some four million priceless objects. It is irreplaceable, unique. And yet, the Museum is not unique in its uniqueness. By their very nature, every museum is inimitable, boasting distinctive collections with a singular history. Rather, the Manchester Museum is ripe for historical analysis because of its similarities with other institutions. It is a university collection, ranking with the Hunterian, the Pitt Rivers, the Ashmolean, the Sedgwick, the Hancock and the Petrie. It also functions as a provincial civic museum, alongside those in Glasgow, Birmingham, Sheffield and Leeds. And its collections are multi-disciplinary, like World Museum Liverpool, the Horniman and the original elucidation of the British Museum. Methodological light shone through the prism of the Manchester Museum will illuminate other collections. Museums and disciplines I return to this multi-disciplinarity throughout this book. My title, Nature and Culture, reflects the central theme – how nature and culture are constructed,\n\nIntroduction: museum historiographies\n\n3\n\nreinforced and differentiated with objects in museums.8 This is especially explicit in the first half of the book, which looks at the history of the Manchester Museum through disciplinary construction and development. For the disciplines that we take for granted as units of knowledge production in Western academia are not stable, coherent and eternal, but rather they are fluid, contingent groupings.9 They have commonly been studied as conceptual and political enterprises, but they are also material entities. As Simon Knell writes, ‘Natural scientists, archaeologists and art historians, in some respects, share a similar engagement with objects: they build whole subjects from material things.’10 Disciplines are constructed with buildings, tools, and objects of study; which fabric not only signals change but can also retard it. The investment in huge apparatus characteristic of twentieth-century physics, for example, is indicative of the maturing status of particular fields, but it also imbued them with a kind of inertia. Museums, with their massive collections, accumulate material culture like no other institution. The museum’s role in the construction of disciplines, I will argue in the chapters that follow, is distinct in interesting ways. The Manchester Museum opened as distinctions were being drawn between different sciences by men like Thomas Huxley, biologist, statesman and champion of Charles Darwin. Huxley’s protégé, the geologist William Boyd Dawkins, was the first curator of the Manchester Museum, appointed by Owens College to transfer and arrange the collections of the Manchester Natural History Society (MNHS) that the College had acquired in 1868. Chapter 1 is devoted to the story of the Society and its collections, the Victorian prologue to the main feature. It traces the development of the collection from a private cabinet to its grand neo-Grecian premises in the centre of industrialising Manchester. It sketches out the different categories within the collection, laying the groundwork for chapters 2 and 3, and introduces those who worked in and visited it, whose stories are taken up in chapters 5 and 6. William Boyd Dawkins’s arrival in Manchester prompted an auction of many of the more exotic specimens in the Natural History Society’s ‘curiosities’ gallery, an event that marked a gear shift in the disciplinary divisions within the collections. He replaced what he saw as an absurd miscellany with a continuous sequence, from palaeontology through archaeology to zoology and botany. Over the following decades, in Manchester as elsewhere, specialist disciplinary communities gradually crystallised around particular objects. For disciplines in museums were enacted not only in the material culture of the collections, but also through personnel and administrative structures. This specialist precipitation was contingent and uneven, and the disciplinary landscape did not necessarily match the divisions on the galleries. Rather, disciplines were contested, flexible and overlapping – one object could be claimed by different specialists. Chapter 2 maps out this gradual unravelling of Dawkins’s continuous sequence within the Museum. It accounts for the ascendance of zoology as the Museum’s driving political and intellectual force (cemented by developments in evolutionary thought and the significance of prominent endeavours\n\nNature and culture\n\n4\n\nsuch as economic entomology). As museums generally declined in prestige as sites for the production of natural knowledge from the mid-century, I chart the increasing distance (conceptual and physical) between the Museum’s collections and their cognate academic departments. In studying disciplines within and outside museums, the historian reveals not only distinctions but also hierarchies. Just as there were shifting relations of prestige between laboratory, field and museum, so within museums, different collections were afforded particular status at different times – dependent not only on the wider intellectual climate but also on funding, staffing and modes of display. At the bottom of this hierarchy at the Manchester Museum’s inception were the ‘historical’ collections, comprising a handful of artefacts that had survived Dawkins’s auction and some ancient Egyptian material on loan. From such humble beginnings, chapter 3 reveals the emergence of distinct and valued collections of anthropology, Egyptology and archaeology. Although never quantitatively significant, anthropogenic material nevertheless came to dominate the Museum’s practice and public face. Chapter 3 accounts for the disciplinary and material distinction between nature and culture, enacted through objects, specialist appointments and new buildings. What emerges in the first half of this book, then, is a map. As Ken Arnold writes, museums were ‘used to define where one discipline ended and another began, and indeed how they fitted together – which next to which’.11 The language of territorialism pervades discussions of disciplinarity – we speak of ‘fields’, of provinces of knowledge, of ‘charting’ terrain.12 Nature and Culture explores the place of different collections in the administrative and spatial layout of the museum. Where were different groups of artefacts and curators located, I ask – how were they arranged, and were such grammars of display shared between disciplines? The history of collections is a shifting intellectual topography involving both tangible and intangible factors: not only the location and classification of objects within the collection, but also the training and outlook of keepers. Just as on a political map nations build borders and sign treaties, so on the landscape of the museum curators construct boundaries and ally themselves with different disciplines. ‘Cultural cartography is not idle play with Venn diagrams’, argues its arch-proponent Thomas Gieryn, ‘maps of science give definitions of situations real in their consequences, both for those who rely on them and those who draw them.’13 The topography of knowledge is messy, contested and fragmented. To exploit the cartographical metaphor: disciplines have jagged borders, contingent cartographies and internal border disputes. The lives of objects The second half of this book shifts the focus from topography to objects. It draws on the work of sociologists, anthropologists and historians of science who have studied the social lives of things.14 Moving on from disciplines, chapters 4, 5 and 6 explore the history of the Manchester Museum through the trajectories of objects\n\nIntroduction: museum historiographies\n\n5\n\nand, especially, the relationships they form with people and with other things. Material culture is thus afforded a metaphorical ‘life’ or ‘career’. As Igor Kopytoff has suggested, we can ask of objects questions similar to those we raise when writing biographies of people.15 What are the key moments in the career of these things? How has their status changed over the course of their lives – what have been their significant ‘ages’? How has the political and social climate impacted on their trajectories? To study object biographies in this way is particularly fruitful in the museum context, not only because so many museum objects have exotic provenances, from far away or long ago, but also because we can learn so much from the lives of the most common of specimens. Elsewhere I have asked these questions of specific objects from the Museum.16 Here, by contrast, I explore the processes enacted upon objects and the communities that carried them out along the general lifespans of the Museum’s things. They begin outside the collection, of course, at the point of collection, at which time objects are dislocated from their original contexts, whether South American jungle, Egyptian tomb, or Derbyshire cave. Chapter 4 traces the routes by which objects were taken from these sources and brought to the Manchester Museum, and the motives of those involved.17 Whereas other studies have profitably analysed museum acquisition quantitatively and geographically, I use exchange theory to propose a fivefold typology of acquisition: by gift, purchase, fieldwork, transfer or loan.18 In each case I discuss the kinds of objects that arrived by these routes and how the people involved changed over time. Wealthy amateur collectors bought exotic specimens at auction; a museum entomologist hurried insects out of Sovietoccupied Vienna; university archaeologists excavated local ‘rescue’ sites. This way of studying the history of museums firmly links them to other spaces for collecting and display, including zoos and menageries, even when curators were seeking to distinguish museums from such tawdry places. From there and elsewhere objects experienced multiple exchanges on their way to the collection. They were rendered (ostensibly) inalienable by gift or commoditised by purchase. They brought with them traces of those involved in their trajectory, different people’s identities wrapped up in their meanings. But the careers of objects did not terminate once they were absorbed into collections. Far from it: many specimens were subject to considerable change and movement subsequent to their arrival at the Museum. Too often, object biographers ignore these afterlives, and I want to correct this in chapter 5 with an innovative attention to the history of museum practice. For museum collections are organic: (mostly) growing, (sometimes) shrinking and changing over time through accession and de-accession, new buildings and gallery renewal. I focus here on the practices enacted upon objects within the Museum and the communities of practitioners responsible. Like its predecessor, chapter 5 is not arranged chronologically but rather thematically. From the range of different things that happen to museum objects I have identified three clusters of processes – physical, textual\n\nNature and culture\n\n6\n\nand exhibitionary. Conservation and conservators, catalogues and cataloguers, exhibitions and their designers are the subject of this chapter, which also recognises the vast majority of items that were never displayed. Museum storage emerges as a surprisingly lively topic for historical analysis. Those objects that were on display were viewed and used by diverse audiences, and the final chapter is devoted to the ways in which the Manchester Museum staff engaged with these visitors: who they were, and how they used and responded to the collections. Techniques for audience engagement and/or control ranged from guidebooks to lectures to temporary exhibitions, and served to construct the Museum’s addressee, its ideal visitor. The Manchester Museum’s ambiguous status as a university collection with civic responsibilities is made explicit in chapter 6, and the diversity of the audiences become apparent. Lofty museum directors and lowly conservators populate earlier chapters – here we meet the schoolchildren, university students and museum volunteers who consumed, justified and contributed to the fruits of their museological labours. For the meanings of things varied not only over time and between sites but also according to who was viewing them. An object on display had relationships not only with other items and with its collectors but also with its audiences. These relationships are historically and culturally contingent, and never one-way. However didactic and interpreted an exhibition, visitors brought their own meanings and reactions to the Museum, and engaged not only with sight but also by listening, talking and touching. Shifts in visitor constituencies and in the ways they viewed things meant that museum objects (and the distinctions between them) were never stable. This chapter contributes to the burgeoning study of museum audiences, both historical and contemporary, in an effort to explore not only collectors and curators but also visitors; to understand not only how objects arrived at the Manchester Museum and what happened to them within the collection but also their use.19 Visitors breathed new life into objects. These later chapters trace the processes enacted upon objects. They share with the first half of the book an attention to what material culture means to different people. Nature and Culture is a study of the distinctions drawn between different things, how different processes changed their meanings over time, and the diverse people who gave them these values. It is a study of the construction of nature and culture on display. Notes 1 K. Arnold, Cabinets for the Curious: Looking Back at Early English Museums (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2006); P.

Philips was involved in textile manufacturing as a partner in his family-based firm, and served in the First Battalion of the Manchester and Salford Volunteers as Lieutenant Colonel.1 The range of objects gathered by Philips and his contemporaries in the eighteenth-century provinces cannot be categorised using modern disciplinary parameters. He collected voraciously: paintings, prints, etchings, books and insects. He juxtaposed natural objects and antiquities, fine art and printed material, demonstrating the diversity of natural history. Philips set out his collections in his home at Mayfield near Manchester, there to welcome esteemed visitors, who in turn conferred status upon him and his cabinet.2 He was well connected to regional and national-scale networks, joining the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society (the ‘Lit and Phil’) upon its foundation in 1781, maintaining a lifelong friendship with Joseph Wright of Derby, and corresponding with the renowned botanist James Edward Smith.3 Philips’s collection was to provide the seed of the Manchester Museum, and in this prologue I will trace the fate of his cabinet from his death in 1814. It draws to a close in the 1870s, by which time Philips’s objects had been acquired by Owens College, the forerunner of the University of Manchester. In charting the biography of the collection, I begin to explore the spaces, people and objects involved in the Manchester Museum, whose narratives will be taken up in the chapters that follow. These stories are played out against the diorama of the bourgeois cultural sphere of industrial Manchester, in the context of museum development in Britain. After his death, Philips’s collection was sold at auction for a total of £5,474 15s 3d. His ‘very extensive, valuable, and nearly perfect collection of insects’ in three mahogany cabinets was purchased by the nonconformist merchant Thomas Henry Robinson.4 Brother-in-law of the prominent banker Sir Benjamin Heywood, Robinson was a keen collector himself, having already gathered a considerable ornithological cabinet. By the early decades of the nineteenth century, however, the landscape of civic collecting in which Robinson moved was changing. Although learned groups such as the Lit and Phil had not been especially concerned with\n\nPrologue: the Manchester Natural History Society\n\nFigure 1.1 John Leigh Philips (1761–1814).\n\n11\n\nNature and culture\n\n12\n\nmaterial culture during Philips’s lifetime, voluntary associations in the 1820s were more interested in things.5 Increased access to personal collections reflected the changing status of the home as new notions of ‘private’ and ‘public’ were fashioned.6 The benefits of combined collecting and ownership in addition to (although by no means instead of) private collecting were apparent to the emerging middle classes in urban Britain. In other provincial centres such as Sheffield and Newcastle, literary and philosophical societies began to purchase sizeable private collections. And so it was to members of the Manchester Lit and Phil that Robinson turned when bankruptcy and lack of space prompted him to put the Philips’s collection up for sale once more. In June 1821 Robinson, by now a bookseller, met with nine other merchants and professionals in St Ann’s Place in the centre of the city: each of them contributed £10 and, as the ‘Manchester Society for the Promotion of Natural History’, agreed to purchase the collections as the nucleus of a museum.7 By the first formal meeting in August, nineteen others had joined, including the patrons of the new Society: Sir Oswald Mosley, lord of the manor of Manchester (and grandfather of the fascist leader), and Lord Stanley, later thirteenth Earl of Derby.8 On 13 September 1821, shortly after the first meeting, Robinson died, and the following month, the remaining members of the Society paid his family £400 for the Philips cabinet.9 But as their successors were to find out (see chapter 4 below), posthumous acquisition was rarely straightforward. Not until early 1822 did Robinson’s father grudgingly hand over a number of duplicate specimens he had retained on the grounds that they were not intended to be transferred with the collection.10 As a small group without their own accommodation, the naturalists contemplated strategies to ensure their survival. Union with the Lit and Phil was considered and discounted; an amalgamation with the Royal Manchester Institution (founded in 1823) was also rejected, ‘on the grounds of incompatibility of principles’.11 Slowly, however, as the ‘Manchester Natural History Society’ (MNHS), the naturalists carved out a space in Manchester’s cultural landscape, its remit bordering but not overlapping the Lit and Phil and the Royal Manchester Institution. From the 1830s, the MNHS was able to consider expansion rather than amalgamation. Briefly, in 1841 it declared itself the Manchester and Salford Natural History Society but in 1844 it adopted ‘The Manchester Natural History Society and Museum’, to emphasise the strength and grandeur of its new accommodation. The Museum on Peter Street Having initially housed the collections in St Ann’s place, rented from Mr Winter, a member of the Society, in 1824 the MNHS had transferred to more spacious accommodation at the top of King Street, later the site of the Reform Club, rented for 150 guineas per annum.12 These rooms were still too small for the growing collections, however, and members began a campaign to erect their own premises, following the\n\nPrologue: the Manchester Natural History Society\n\n13\n\nlead of the Royal Manchester Institution and other voluntary associations. Their ultimate success was by no means a foregone conclusion, as many civic collections elsewhere made do with adapted or shared quarters.13 But after several years of lobbying and raising funds, in 1832 the Society secured a plot of 1,200 square yards on Peter Street where it adjoined with Mount Street, in part of the town whose quieter residential character was giving way to institutions that would comprise the cultural counterpoint to the industrial city (see figure 1.2).14 Architectural tenders were invited the following year, and construction began.15 The new building on Peter Street, 36 yards wide and 14 yards deep, opened on 18 May 1835 at a total outlay of around £4,000. The ground floor comprised two large rooms and an entrance hall, with nine smaller rooms and a gallery upstairs.16 The Peter Street Museum was a grand affair, replete with a pillared façade (see figure 1.3).17 It was part of the Greek architectural revival in Manchester, echoing the original town hall on King Street. The Museum also resonated with the Royal Manchester Institution building on Mosley Street, designed by Charles Barry and opened in the same year. Both the town hall and the Royal Institution were within five hundred yards of Peter Street; the last great Grecian building in Manchester was even closer – the adjacent (indeed, overshadowing) Theatre Royal, completed in 1845. Thereafter, Gothic and Italianate styles dominated, as for example in the 1853 Free Trade Hall on the other side of the Theatre Royal. Juxtaposed with proliferating mills and the thousand warehouses in the city by 1830, Grecian and Gothic monuments alike emphasised the cultural sophistication of Manchester’s elite. As elsewhere in the provinces – such as the royal institutions in Liverpool and Hull – such buildings proclaimed British cities as heirs of ancient and medieval city-states. The MNHS building was to expand further in the middle of the century, as it incorporated the collections of the Manchester Geological Society.18 Founded in 1838, the Geological Society owed its existence to the efforts of Edward W. Binney, then a young solicitor and keen geologist, who was to be closely involved with the Lit and Phil. Like the MNHS, a collection was part of the Geological Society’s remit from the outset, and it soon boasted a considerable fossil cabinet. Its prize specimen, an ichthyosaurus found near Whitby, was purchased for the Society in part by the wealthy Unitarian reformer and philanthropist James Heywood, brother of Benjamin Heywood (see above) and brother-in-law of Robinson. Heywood also provided accommodation in his house on Mosley Street before the Geological Society and its collections moved to the nearby Royal Manchester Institution. By the later 1840s, however, the geologists were declining in membership and attendance. Following Oswald Mosley’s suggestion that there were too many different scientific societies in Manchester, the two organisations entered into an uneasy alliance in 1851.19 During the two years it took to transfer the Geological Society specimens from Mosley Street to Peter Street and incorporate them into the MNHS geology series, the societies added three further rooms to the back of the museum building. Nevertheless, the two groups continued to govern themselves\n\n14\n\nNature and culture\n\nFigure 1.2 Victorian Manchester, showing (1) the Manchester Natural History Society’s museum on Peter Street, (2) the original Town Hall, (3) the Royal Manchester Institution, (4) the original site of Owens College on Quay Street and (5) the site of the Owens College from the 1870s in Chorlton-on-Medlock.\n\nPrologue: the Manchester Natural History Society\n\n15\n\nFigure 1.3 The museum of the Manchester Natural History Society, Peter Street, c.1865.\n\nindependently, and they made uncomfortable bedfellows.20 Rows soon erupted over access to specimens, admission to the museum, and even charges for custody of umbrellas. They culminated in a bitter dispute over keys to the cases, during which MNHS Council accused Edward Binney of ‘ungentlemanly and disgusting’ conduct.21 Sharing a space, it seems, did not entail sharing behavioural codes, and the spat rumbled on until the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Manchester in 1861 prompted a truce. The Manchester Geological Society’s collection was only the largest of a series of acquisitions that extended the original core of Philips’s cabinet to form a large (if uneven) natural history museum. The small revenue of the MNHS afforded some purchases, beginning with the bird collection of a local surgeon (which laid the groundwork for the collection’s subsequent strength in ornithology) and 2,000 minerals and rocks from Joseph Strutt of Derby. According to the Manchester Guardian, the Society also bought the famed showman William Bullock’s ‘grand Mexican museum, consisting of birds, fishes, fruit, &c. &c.’22 These early purchases spurred the generosity of the region’s middle classes, and after the Society accepted its first donation – a South American Hammock from William Lever – gifts became the staple source of acquisition.23 Donors included members of the Society or correspondents further afield. And as more specimens entered the collection, some began to leave. Duplicate specimens were sold or exchanged exploiting a network of individuals and institutions across the country including the Zoological Society of London, which promised the carcass of a kangaroo ‘in case of its death, which\n\n16\n\nNature and culture\n\nis expected to take place’.24 Such exchanges, gifts and purchases remained the principal modes of acquisition throughout the history of the Manchester Museum (see chapter 4 below). The collecting networks established by the MNHS in the nineteenth century provided a framework for acquisition in the twentieth. Most items that arrived within the collection were incorporated within the ranks of taxonomically similar specimens, as the Society sought (vainly) to gather a ‘complete’ collection. But some specimens were so singular – either in their acquisition route, their characteristics, or their associations – that they remained distinct from the rest of the collection, their fame (or infamy) rendering them iconic. These included such notable quadrupeds as Mr Potter’s cow, last individual of a herd of white polled cattle in Lancashire, and ‘Vizier’, Napoleon’s Arabian charger.25 The cotton merchants William and Robert Garnett donated sarcophagi housing the mummified remains of ‘Asroni’ (later ‘Asru’), a royal maid of honour, thereby providing the Ancient Egyptian mummy that was ubiquitous in British collections from the seventeenth century onwards.26 More unusually, the collection also included not only a Peruvian mummy but also the embalmed corpse of Hannah Beswick, a wealthy local woman who reputedly held such a fear of being buried alive that she had arranged for the surgeon Charles White posthumously to preserve her body.27 White had then displayed her remains among the anatomical preparations at his house, which stood on the site that was later the town hall (see figure 1.2). Upon his death he had bequeathed the ‘Manchester mummy’ to a colleague, who in turn left it to the Society in 1828, together with the grandfather clock case in which Beswick’s remains were kept. The presence of such curiosities reflected the expansive character of ‘extended natural history’ in Victorian Britain.28 Antiquities and exotica were collected and used in the same way as local and foreign plants, animals and rocks. ‘models of famous diamonds’ and a ‘large Burmese idol’ sat alongside stalactites, turtle shells and a narwhal’s horn.29 These charismatic objects occupied the ‘curiosity’ room on the ground floor of the 1835 building, the rest of which was given over to a more orthodox arrangement. By the time the Geological Society’s collections arrived, some of the disciplinary lines that would shape the collection throughout the following century were evident, especially in the physical and conceptual position that earth sciences took as the basis of the Museum. Geology, mineralogy and vertebrate zoology were the foundation, while on the first floor the reptiles, birds, fish, crustaceans, insects and corals had coalesced into distinct parts of the collection. This gradual disaggregation reflected the emergence of distinct specialties within natural history literature and museums in the nineteenth century.30 Naturalists in the British Museum and elsewhere carved out distinct areas of expertise not only in periodicals and monographs, but also in catalogues and with specimens: the material culture of natural knowledge. From 1836, the MNHS had embarked upon a series of catalogues of distinct faunal groups within the collection, which, although short-lived, reflected the divisions within the collection.31 After the merger with the Geological Society,\n\nPrologue: the Manchester Natural History Society\n\n17\n\nthe Manchester naturalists imposed the British Museum’s taxonomic system across the collections.32 But who was undertaking this rearrangement, and on whose behalf? Visitors and staff Like other bourgeois associations in the early nineteenth century, access to the rooms of the Manchester Natural History Society was limited to three categories of person. Gentlemen members or ‘proprietors’ paid a considerable sum upon joining (at first ten, later three guineas) and a guinea or two per annum thereafter. They had a proprietary stake in the collection, and were able to visit freely. Proprietors were permitted to bring guests, the second category, which included ladies, other family members and gentlemen visitors who resided more then six miles from the city. Finally, honorary membership was bestowed upon nobility and gentlemen ‘residing some distance from Manchester’ with scholarly merit, or else generosity in donating books, specimens or money.33 It was by the judicious employment of honorary membership that the MNHS connected itself to wider intellectual and political networks in Britain and beyond. The American ornithologist and bird artist John James Audubon exhibited his paintings in the Society’s rooms while hawking his mammoth Birds of America (1827–38) around Britain.34 The Society subscribed to the series (although the volumes were later sold by the Manchester Museum – see chapter 2 below) and granted Audubon honorary membership. He thereby benefited from the relationship financially, and the Society was afforded prestige in return as Audubon’s star rapidly ascended. Closer to home, the patronage of Sir Oswald Mosley and Lord Stanley was critical: association with the landed gentry was a common tactic of the emerging urban bourgeoisie as they cemented their urban dominance.35 In the 1830s, however, the criteria for access to collections changed. Once the Peter Street building was open, other selected members of the middle classes were admitted, including from the mid-century professors from the nearby Owens College. Furthermore, the original bars to apprentices, servants and children were lifted. School groups could attend at 3d per pupil, ladies and strangers were permitted to enter on their own, non-subscribers were welcome (although often at the steep entrance fee of one shilling) and the working classes generally were granted entrance on certain days at 6d.36 This apparent inclusivity was in response to a national tendency to provide cultural and educational opportunities for the ‘lower orders’ of society. Museums began to provide not only an uplifting pastime for the upper-middling ranks, but also rational recreation for the masses.37 After the massive attendance at the Great Exhibition in 1851, reformers concluded that working people would flock to museums and galleries. Debates raged as to the desirability of gas lighting and Sunday opening to allow them to visit outside working hours (see chapter 6).38\n\n18\n\nNature and culture\n\nSuch endeavours met with mixed results. The MNHS Museum had been admitting working men from 1838, but a year later not a single application had been made for access.39 More successful was a mutual admission deal with the Manchester Mechanics’ Institute: 188 mechanics attended in February 1840.40 The MNHS later reduced adult entrance to 3d, and gradually more use was made of the Museum.41 ‘No opportunity affords so effectual a means of elevating the tastes and pursuits of the working classes and the young people of the district’, the Council boasted, ‘as frequent and intelligent resort to an extensive, and, comparatively speaking, well-arranged Museum of Natural History, such as that of the Society.’42 Although total visits overall peaked at over 50,000 in 1837, like comparable museums in Newcastle and Leeds, the numbers were generally between 20,000 and 30,000 until the 1850s.43 In 1840, the Society experienced the ultimate test of the success of the Peter Street Museum and other such institutions as instruments of working-class edification and control. As the social reformer Edwin Chadwick reported, On the holiday given at Manchester in celebration of Her Majesty’s marriage [10 February], extensive arrangements were made for holding a Chartist meeting, and for getting up what was called a demonstration of the working classes, which greatly alarmed the municipal magistrates. Sir Charles Shaw, the Chief Commissioner of Police, induced the mayor to get the Botanical Gardens, Zoological Gardens, and Museum of that town, and other institutions, thrown open to the working classes at the hour they were urgently invited to attend the Chartist meeting. The mayor undertook to be personally answerable for any damage that occurred from throwing open the gardens and institutions to the classes who had never before encountered them. The effect was that not more than two or thee hundred people attended the political meeting, which entirely failed, and scarcely five shillings’ worth of damage was done in the gardens or in public institutions by the workpeople, who were highly pleased.44\n\nThe civic elite rested assured that middle-class institutions were successful in luring the lower orders from alcohol and, worse, radicalism. The symbolic location of the Museum – built on the site of the Peterloo Massacre just a decade earlier – was indicative of the confidence of the Manchester bourgeoisie in inter-class harmony. Three successive free trade halls erected further down Peter Street reinforced the assurance of the Manchester middle class and the centrality of the Natural History Society within bourgeois culture. The new building and visitor numbers in the 1830s prompted a shift in the management of the collections. Originally, the specimens had been catalogued and cared for by the core members of the Society, who appointed themselves ‘honorary curators’.45 They were elected by ballot or council appointment according to their expertise (and probably their ability to donate valuable or interesting specimens). Such naturalists were not expected to get their hands dirty, however, and in the 1820s the Society had engaged the weaver-turned-taxidermist Timothy Harrop to work for the honorary curators as conservator, responsible for mounting and displaying the specimens. Upon the erection of the Peter Street building, the Society also appointed William Crawford\n\nPrologue: the Manchester Natural History Society\n\n19\n\nWilliamson ‘Chief Curator, General Manager and Superintendent’ at the tender age of nineteen.46 The son of the curator of the Scarborough Museum, Williamson had come to Manchester to be apprenticed to Dr Charles Phillips, a prominent member of the Natural History Society. His appointment did not go well. ‘If, before my acceptance of the curatorship of the Manchester Museum I had known all I subsequently learned,’ wrote Williamson later in life, ‘I should certainly have shrunk from taking the step.’47 His frustration stemmed from a clash with Harrop, who he claimed was ‘wholly ignorant of every branch of science except taxidermy, and . . . probably the worst bird-stuffer in Europe’.48 Harrop too was disgruntled, and with good cause: he had once instructed Williamson’s father in taxidermy, and Williamson Junior was then appointed over him, demanding a larger salary. The feud split the Council of the Society, pitting against each other those who advocated Williamson’s ‘scientific’ approach to display, and those who favoured Harrop’s more aesthetic methods. (Harrop was so concerned with appearance over all else that he installed only one glass eye in many of the birds, on the side that faced the audience.)49 Exasperated, Williamson resigned in 1838 to complete his medical studies in London. He later returned to Manchester, where he was instrumental in establishing the Ear Hospital, and taught natural history at the new Owens College (see chapter 2 below). Harrop also clashed with Williamson’s successor, Captain Thomas Brown, and was eventually relieved of his duties after a long absence in 1848. Brown was an accomplished taxidermist himself, as well as a conchologist.50 Brown had been stationed in Manchester as a militiaman in the 1810s, and after retiring from active service he made a living through scientific writing. He returned to Manchester and became involved in the fledgling Manchester Geological Society, succeeding as secretary Edward Binney (with whom he quarrelled bitterly). Continuing on the trajectory Williamson had started at Peter Street, Brown and his successor Thomas Alcock sought to establish the curators’ role as that of expert naturalist rather than glorified janitor, and additional staff were appointed to assist them.51 Like Williamson, Alcock was medically trained, and gave classes at Owens College and at the Museum. A keen naturalist, he kept a private museum at his home in Ashton-on-Mersey.52 He had been a member of the Society for some years before his appointment in 1862, and so enjoyed an easier relationship with the honorary curators than his predecessors: he gave them new powers, and dismissed several of the salaried staff who were not pulling their weight. But there was little Alcock could do to stem the decline of the Society and its collections that was increasingly evident in the 1860s. Other associational organisations, such as the avowedly haut bourgeois Manchester Botanical and Horticultural Society, were also struggling for members and funds. The future looked bleak. Transfer and dissolution But there was legislative light at the end of the tunnel. The Public Libraries and Museums Act of 1845 gave local authorities the power to levy a penny rate to\n\n20\n\nNature and culture\n\nmaintain museums and libraries. Sunderland, Warrington, Leicester, Ipswich and (notably) Salford took advantage almost immediately. Over the following decades, many voluntary association collections in Britain either seeded or were absorbed by Corporation-run institutes, fuelling an exponential increase in public museums between 1850 and 1900.53 These institutions were founded on the same wave of municipal reform as public libraries, parks and gardens. As the free library campaigner Thomas Greenwood wrote in 1888, ‘a Museum and Free Library are as necessary for the mental and moral health of the citizens as good sanitary arrangements, water supply and street lighting are for their physical health and comfort’.54 Accordingly, when the Manchester naturalists began to struggle, they turned to the Corporation. The building had long been overcrowded; staffing was still inadequate. Members were dying off so subscriptions were down and attendance (and with it door income) was declining. The latter was exacerbated by competition from Salford’s free museum at Peel Park less than two miles away, which had opened in January 1850. The Society’s hopes were in vain. After four years, negotiations with the Corporation broke down – partly because the city bridled at the Society’s demands for continued control over the collections, but no doubt also because of the financial circumstances of local government. The Society then considered offering the collections to Salford, but upon reflection anticipated similar problems to those encountered with Manchester. Salvation came from close to home in the form of Owens College, the first of the ‘civic colleges’ in provincial England.55 Founded in 1851, Owens had struggled through its first decade, but in the 1860s was beginning to thrive, with increasing students and the prospect of incorporating the Royal Manchester School of Medicine and Surgery. The naturalists were already familiar with the College, especially through Williamson’s and Alcock’s teaching.56 The College authorities agreed to take the collections, together with the proceeds of the sale of the Peter Street building and its land. Space prohibited an immediate transfer, as the College operated in cramped accommodation on Quay Street (in Richard Cobden’s old house), just west of the Museum. Larger premises were planned, however, on cheaper land in the suburb of Chorlton-on-Medlock a mile south of the city (see figure 1.2). They were designed by Alfred Waterhouse, a young Quaker architect trained and practising in Manchester, who had established his reputation with the Manchester Assize Courts and Strangeways Gaol, and was to cement it with the new Manchester Town Hall.57 In the meantime, the MNHS appointed an interim commission to manage the collections, led by the Unitarian solicitor and collector Robert Dukinfield Darbishire, who features throughout this book. He supervised the disposal of the society’s property and lands, and oversaw the running and maintenance of the collections in the meantime. For advice on the reorganisation of the Museum in College hands, and how best fulfil its educational potential, the commission approached the biologist Thomas Huxley, ‘Darwin’s bulldog’. He advocated a ‘public exhibition of a collection of specimens’ and ‘the accessibility of all objects contained in the museum to the curator\n\nPrologue: the Manchester Natural History Society\n\n21\n\nFigure 1.4 Thomas Henry Huxley’s original sketch of the ideal arrangement of a natural history museum in the advice he gave to the Commissioners of the Manchester Natural History Society in 1868. The ‘public division’ (I) can be seen between ‘curator divisions’ (II and III); cases were accessible to staff and researchers, but not to the general visitor.\n\nand to scientific students, without interference with the public or by the public’.58 Huxley and museum practitioners such as William Henry Flower, later Director of the British Museum (Natural History), were seeking to distinguish between those collections for public display and those for serious study by promoting the notion of the ‘new museum’. Research collections were to be kept in separate rooms in rows of densely packed cabinets, away from the select few specimens on public display (see figure 1.4). The cases in which these specimens are exhibited [Huxley advised the commission] must present a transparent but hermetically closed face, one side accessible to the public, while on the opposite side they are constantly accessible to the Curator by means of doors opening into a portion of the Museum to which the public has no access.59\n\nCurators sought to construct self-consciously scientific collections, setting aside privileged space for the expert. Research collections were to ‘be used only for consultation and reference by those who are able to read and appreciate their contents’.60 And whereas Huxley’s ideas were not strictly adhered to in the new Manchester Museum, the bifurcation of audiences, administratively and architecturally, was evident in its early years (see chapter 6 below).\n\n22\n\nNature and culture\n\nTo Alcock’s disappointment, the commission did not see fit to continue his tenure as curator. Rather, on Huxley’s advice, the commission appointed William Boyd Dawkins.61 Born near Welshpool, Dawkins had studied geology at Oxford under John Phillips. As an undergraduate he undertook cave research, excavating at Kent’s Hole, Torquay, and upon graduating, he worked for the Geological Survey under Huxley’s tutelage. Although Dawkins went on to establish himself as an authority in palaeontology and archaeology, it is in his capacity as a curator and latterly a member of the Museum Committee that he is of interest here and in the chapters below. During his long career in Manchester, he developed very strong views on the arrangement and role of museums, and these influenced the Manchester Museum for decades – even after his formal departure from curatorial duties.62 On 29 January 1868 the Natural History Society formally dissolved, and the commission took control of its collections; the Manchester Geological Society, which survived, would transfer its collections the following year.63 The new collection was to be purely scientific, comprising geology, zoology and botany, with no place for some of the more exotic specimens of the Society. Dawkins later complained that ‘in very many museums, art is not separated from natural history, nor from ethnology, and the eye of the beholder takes in at a glance the picture of a local worthy, a big fossil, a few cups and saucers, a piece of cloth from the South Seas, a war club or two, and very possibly a mummy’. These ‘articles which have no relationship with the rest . . . converted the whole into rubbish’.64 And so in 1868, Darbishire arranged for the ‘curiosities’ to be auctioned – that is, all the anthropogenic material except Carthaginian and Egyptian antiquities. (Among the lots was the Burmese Buddha, bought by the Salford Museum but returned in 1969 as part of an exchange.)65 The commission also sought to dispose of the some of the stranger items of the collection in an appropriate manner. After consultation with her surviving relatives, the Home Secretary and the Bishop of Manchester, Hannah Beswick’s remains were finally buried in an unmarked grave in Harpurhey Cemetery to the north of the city.66 The commission sent Napoleon’s charger, Vizier, to the Louvre (where it remained unpacked for many years in a lumber room).67 Darbishire’s law firm auctioned the Peter Street museum in July 1872.68 From the proceeds of the sale, £5,000 was to fund a new building and the remainder (some £15,000) formed an endowment fund for salaries and collection maintenance. The collections themselves finally arrived at the College in 1873, a surprising sight as they trundled in carts down Oxford Road, many of the larger quadrupeds visible to the citizenry.69 There they were stored in the College attics – ostensibly following Huxley’s arrangement – with the exception of the giraffe and the elephant, which remained on the ground floor.70 Dawkins used them on a limited basis ‘in teaching in the College and in addresses to working men and to the general public’ – students had to present a card signed by their professor to gain access.71 But Dawkins was increasingly distracted from the collections. Failing to secure the Woodwardian Chair of Geology at Cambridge, he was appointed first to the lectureship and then\n\nPrologue: the Manchester Natural History Society\n\n23\n\nFigure 1.5 Alfred Waterhouse’s conception of the Manchester Museum on Oxford Road, 1882. The building south of the tower (to the left of the picture) had yet to be completed: it would be designed by Alfred’s son Paul as the Whitworth Hall (1902).\n\nto the chair at Owens College (in addition to his curatorial duties), taking over Williamson’s geology teaching. In 1882, the first stone was laid for dedicated accommodation for the collections. The new building would form one side of the Owens quadrangle, the front face and gateway to the College. The building and its public aspect were timely. Further down Oxford Road, Darbishire and the other trustees of the estate of the engineering magnate Sir Joseph Whitworth secured a mansion and its parcel of land for a public park and art gallery, the Whitworth Institute. In the town centre, the corporation had recently adapted the Royal Manchester Institution to serve as the City Art Gallery. Liverpool, not to be outdone, boasted the new Walker Art Gallery. To design a museum to rival these civic monuments, the College turned again to Alfred Waterhouse, who was becoming the favoured architect for the northern university colleges – his chosen building materials earned them their sobriquet ‘redbrick’. His previous Owens building was an imposing but utilitarian non-historic Gothic sandstone pile. The Museum was even more monumental, with dense tripartite fenestration and full height buttresses (see figure 1.5). Steep red pyramidal roofs topped the façade, and a nine-storey tower provided the visual centre-point of the College. The popular conservatism demonstrated by this design was central to Waterhouse’s reputation, as was his attention to practicality and his ability to work within limited budgets. Nevertheless, the proceeds of the Peter Street sale did\n\n24\n\nNature and culture\n\nlittle to defray the total cost of the Museum. Together with the neighbouring Beyer laboratories, the final bill came to £95,000 – the remainder funded through public subscription and by the Whitworth Trustees.72 Waterhouse had been based in London since 1865, and since his previous Owens College commissions he had adapted Francis Fowke’s design for new premises for the new British Museum (Natural History) in South Kensington.73 The two museums may have shared an architect, but they were markedly different. The light Romanesque terracotta frontage of the BM(NH) contrasted with the imposing neo-Gothic edifice in Manchester. Rival conceptions of nature were built into the very fabric of the buildings. In South Kensington, the architecture reflected Richard Owen’s commitment to comparative anatomy, with multiple galleries leading off from a central index collection. In Manchester, the galleries were arranged in a single continuous path up the building, allowing the collections to be displayed as an evolutionary sequence (explored in more detail in chapter 2). Dawkins’s original idea was to present a few carefully selected specimens for public viewing, with the bulk in reserve storage; in South Kensington, Owen wanted an encyclopaedic collection with as much on display as possible. Thus the Manchester Museum collections, like other aspects of Victorian natural history, emerged from the voluntary sphere into a new space and form of ownership as the twentieth century loomed. In the hands of the College they were controlled not by wealthy amateurs, but by a new community of professional men of science. Gathered by wealthy late-Enlightenment collectors, the material cultures of provincial natural history formed the core of museums of learned societies in the early decades of the nineteenth century that were among a range of activities designed to display provincial civic pride. By the 1860s, these palaces of middle-class science were bursting at the seams and were proving burdensome as the societies ran into financial difficulties under competition from other cultural and educational sites. They turned to their towns to pay for the transfer to new accommodation, and the collections then became the responsibility of one of the various forms of civic committee – in this case, the Council of Owens College. Their museums were increasingly removed from the less savoury aspects of Victorian cultures of display by an increasing emphasis (however unheeded) on education, shaping the twentiethcentury understanding of the public museum. Despite considerable changes during the nineteenth century, the influence exercised by the urban elite endured, and is evident throughout the chapters that follow. Members of the haute bourgeoisie managed personal collections as owners, society collections as proprietors, and university collections as committee members. Despite the apparent permeability of museums in the second half of the century, if anything, the local middle-class elite strengthened their grip during this time. Whereas the personal museum was explicitly exclusive, the public educational museum was potentially a more potent a tool of bourgeois hegemony, an attempt to impose middle-class definitions of culture and nature onto other sections of\n\nPrologue: the Manchester Natural History Society\n\n25\n\nsociety. Whether or not the ‘lower orders’ paid much heed is of course another matter.74 Successful or not, natural history collecting and collections were one facet of middle-class cultural activities – art galleries, theatres, libraries – that served in part to educate the working classes, in part to reassure the urban bourgeoisie of the cultural sophistication of their town in contrast to other regions and to the capital. These functions and projected audiences feature throughout Nature and Culture, before becoming explicit again in chapter 6.

The meeting was packed with scientific celebrities, including the chemist Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev and the naturalists Sir William Thiselton-Dyer, E. Ray Lankester and Asa Gray. Owens College staff were energetic hosts, not least as they prepared their new museum for its first opening. William Boyd Dawkins, in his final act as curator of the collections, detailed the geology of the region for the delegates; he and other naturalists closely involved with the collection were pleased to announce ‘the new natural history museum of The Owens College’.1 Their audience was especially discerning. Most were familiar with other new natural history museums: the British Museum (Natural History), Harvard’s Peabody Museum, the new building of the Musée d’Histoire Naturelle in Paris, the Imperial Natural History Museum in Vienna, the Bohemian Museum in Prague and the California Academy of Sciences.2 Colonial expansion flooded imperial centres with specimens from around the world, renewing the confidence of European and American naturalists in their efforts to catalogue nature’s complete encyclopaedia. The decades around 1900 were considered by contemporaries and historians alike as the ‘heyday’ of natural history, and public appreciation of nature was demonstrated by new conservation movements.3 Lay consumption for natural history publications, activities and exhibitions was unprecedented. In the academic realm in which the Manchester Museum now operated, there emerged new projects such as plant ecology, which drew upon and perpetuated natural history practices.4 Thanks to the demands of medical education for life science instruction, zoology and botany were now firmly established in the syllabuses of British higher education establishments, which boasted chairs in life and earth sciences.5 This was especially the case in the English civic colleges that were soon to be chartered as independent universities, of which Owens College was prominent. The combination of academic demand and popular interest fuelled natural history posts at institutions that were otherwise principally dedicated to professional and industrial topics. Natural history museums thrived at the intersection of education, empire and leisure. On this historians agree, but few have turned their attention to the\n\nNature and culture\n\n32\n\nsubsequent fate of natural science collections in twentieth-century Britain. How did they fare in the century of the laboratory, mass media and the end of empire? To find out, I explore the cultural cartography and wider contexts of the Manchester Museum. I interrogate the shifting disciplinary boundaries within the natural history collections and between the Museum, the university, and the wider intellectual sphere. To do so one must assess not only the physical changes evident in buildings and galleries, but also intangible factors such as staff training. Material culture was employed in the physical space of the Museum to build disciplines and anchor communities of practice, whether"
