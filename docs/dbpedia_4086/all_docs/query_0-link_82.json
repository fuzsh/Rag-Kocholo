        "text": "Purpose of group (two paragraphs maximum)Manchester Museum, part of the University of Manchester, is one of the UK’s leading university museums. We are driven by our mission: to build understanding between cultures and a sustainable world, and our work is underpinned by our core values of inclusion, imagination and care. Through our collection of over 4 million objects, numerous specialist staff and award-winning galleries, we are a critical part of the research and environmental education infrastructure in the city and beyond. We are urgently transforming how we support ecological thinking and action, build more sustainable futures and inspire cooperation and change in our city. We believe that the ecological and climate crises are relevant to both aspects of our mission: they are as much cultural and social justice issues as they are scientific and environmental and both call for collective action and cooperation both globally and locally. We believe a better future requires us to rethink how we care and are convinced that our future is collaborative: actively supporting connections between individuals and groups, long term relationships, inclusion, and will be the hallmarks of our ethos of care.Skills/knowledge/resources your group has that it is willing to share with othersSKILLS & KNOWLEDGE\n\nComms – Social media, blogging, press releases… Community engagement, co-production, partnerships\n\nData – databases, cataloguing, gathering and analysis Learning – formal / informal learning and engagement, all ages, collections-based, research-based, creative, transdisciplinary\n\nFundraising – bid-writing, planning Project Management – planning to delivery and evaluation Report writing\n\nStorytelling (and use of collections), inc digital Research – collections-based – science – humanities, theory, practice, Indigenous and global south perspectives\n\nVolunteers – recruiting, supporting, maintaining\n\nRESOURCES\n\nSpaces – Museum public galleries and other spaces Specialist staff – curatorial, education and engagement, communications and marketing Collections – biodiversity and natural sciences, vivarium, botany, geology, global\n\nStatus – as partners, allies, supporters\n\nConnections – within University and beyond, local, national and international"
