        "text": "A guest post from Mattie Davies (they/them), our Inflatable Museum Support Assistant, about The Proud Trust and their visit to Manchester Museum.\n\nWhen I’m not at Manchester Museum, taking the Inflatable Museum out to schools or facilitating various other activities and events, I work at The Proud Trust as a youth work coordinator. The Proud Trust is a lifesaving and life-enhancing organisation that helps LGBT+ young people empower themselves, and make a positive change for themselves and their communities.\n\nOne of the youth groups that I coordinate is Turtles, a group for young trans and non-binary young people, or those questioning their gender, aged 11-15. This is an opportunity to learn and socialise with others in a safe, welcoming environment. Since our current location is just a 5 minute walk from Manchester Museum, what better opportunity to expand that safe, welcoming environment to the museum?\n\nSo one drizzly Saturday in November, I brought six trans young people to visit Manchester Museum. As we explored Manchester Museum’s spaces, I asked the young people to explore some ideas too: What exhibits and objects do you see yourself, your identity, or your community reflected in? How would you rewrite the labels on the exhibits and objects? What would you like to tell Manchester Museum about those exhibits and objects?\n\nWe started with the Fossils Gallery, which I knew would be a hit. A few of our young people are pretty big on dinosaurs, and dinosaurs are pretty popular in the trans community in general. My friends and I often joke about dinosaurs being trans culture – I was particularly excited to see dinosaurs mentioned on a sign at last summer’s Trans Pride Brighton March.\n\nHere’s what one young person aged 14 (he/him) had to say about Stan the T. rex:\n\n“Gendering animals based on appearance is very common, however it is only really acceptable to assign a gender to currently living animals, and gendering things like dinosaurs – such as Stan – is unnecessary… In saying that, pointlessly gendering humans nowadays is just as ridiculous and there is no need for it. Nothing needs pronouns given to them. We should accept this – with old fossils and humans.”\n\nAfter this reaction, we talked about how Stan got its name and then discussed another T. rex called SUE whose museum took the approach of using the gender neutral pronouns they/them for SUE.\n\n“GIVE THE T-REX A BOYFRIEND CALLED LARRY”\n\n– young people aged 14 (they/them) and 15 (he/him)\n\nOur next stop was the Living Worlds gallery, where we had a lot to see. Of course, we had to make a stop to see our namesake: the green turtle. I’m sometimes asked why the youth group is called Turtles, and I’m not really sure. The young people name our youth groups, so they chose the name Turtles.\n\nI made a point to stop by the animals highlighted in our Family Gorgeous ‘Museum Menagerie’ event last year: the lion, the snake, and the peacock.\n\nOne young person aged 12 (he/him) was particularly interested to learn that Victorians would wear peacock feathers on their jacket lapels to identify each other as gay men, and this was taken away as something new they had learnt that day.\n\nThe lion also led us into a discussion about homosexuality in animals. Penguins and swans, also on display in Living Worlds, have also been observed engaging in same-sex behaviour.\n\nAbout twenty percent of swan pairings are homosexual and same-sex coupling and adoption in penguins is well-documented in zoos.\n\n“LESBIAN SWANS”\n\n– young people aged 14 (they/them) and 15 (he/him)\n\nHeading upstairs to Nature’s Library, we found more turtles, butterflies, and relatable content – “Me,” said one young person aged 14 (she/her) as she took a picture of a grey slender loris\n\nButterflies are commonly used as metaphors for trans people and the process of transitioning. It’s not a metaphor that sits very comfortably for me; the emphasis on visible changes, associations with a certain type of femininity, and implications that transitioning is something that ever finishes, and not a continuous ongoing process for some people. All the same, the butterfly is a very important symbol of trans identity to some folk, and I respect that.\n\n“TRANS BUTTERFLIES”\n\n– young people aged 14 (they/them) and 15 (he/him)\n\nPerhaps more so than the Fossils Gallery, the Turtles especially enjoyed the Vivarium. When I asked what they enjoyed most about visiting Manchester Museum, most of the young people mentioned the frogs.\n\n“BISEXUAL FROGS”\n\n– young people aged 14 (they/them) and 15 (he/him)\n\nWhen I asked one young person aged 14 (they/them) why they wrote the above (the rest relating to our conversations), they simply responded: “bi people are cool and frogs are cool” – fair enough! “Some frogs can change sex” one young person aged 16 (he/him) observed.\n\nThe last question I asked the Turtles is where LGBT+ content belongs in museums. Does it belong in its own section? Does it belong in exhibits about human history, or in other exhibits about natural history?\n\nThere was no immediate answer as the young people considered my questions. Slowly, consensus grew that LGBT+ identities should be acknowledged across museum exhibits. One young person aged 16 (he/him) summed up our thoughts perfectly: “I think it should be in all sections, because it’s about people and it’s about animals and nature.”"
