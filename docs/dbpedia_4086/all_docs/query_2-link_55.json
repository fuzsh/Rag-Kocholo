        "text": "To make it easier to build your visit to Manchester Museum into your topic, we have developed a ‘journey’ for primary school pupils coming for a free self-led visit.\n\nThese are extended enquiries that we’re calling ‘Big Questions’, and will be themed investigations set by museum curators with genuinely open-ended questions we want to hear the children’s thoughts on.\n\nResources for Big Question experiences – including videos, downloads, activities, presentations and teacher notes – will all held in one handy package tailored to your topic, and everything will be adaptable for different children’s needs. Activities are linked to Museum Investigation Skills.\n\nThe ‘Big Questions’ available in Spring 2023\n\nWhat is the most important ancient Egyptian artefact in Manchester Museum?\n\nMeet Dr Campbell Price, who invites children to consider the meaning of the word ‘important’ and to explore some of the 18,000 objects from ancient Egypt and Sudan at Manchester Museum. Aimed at Key Stage 2 pupils.\n\nIs April the Tenontosaurus ‘real’?\n\nDavid Gelsthorpe, curator of Earth Sciences at the museum, introduces Stan the T Rex and our new Tenontosaurus, April. But what do we mean by real? Are dinosaurs in museums ‘real’? A great way of exploring bones, fossils, and ‘alive, dead or never alive’. Aimed at Key Stage 1 pupils.\n\nWho makes Manchester Museum?\n\nWhat jobs and skills are needed to make a museum? Explore the world of work in a cultural organisation, from curating and marketing to conservation and animal care. Aimed at any age, but especially at SEND pupils and classes.\n\nAre birds dinosaurs?\n\nClassification, adaptation and evolution will all be important as pupils meet curator David’s challenge to decide on this tricky question! Aimed at Upper Key Stage 2.\n\nWho are we?\n\nOur brand new South Asia, Chinese Culture and Belonging galleries have inspired this curator question, which invites pupils to consider how objects and portraits can represent individuals in a museum, and how they would represent themselves."
