        "text": "I grew up in Manchester, an old industrial city in northern England which rather unfortunately, became famous as the target of an IRA bomb which destroyed the city centre in 1995. But while the bomb may have gutted the city, it also served as a catalyst, forcing unimaginable changes and modernisation to occur - the city I visit today bears almost no resemblance to the one of my youth.\n\nManchester is also a world leader in science and research. The computer was invented here (my old high school even had a plaque dedicated to one of the old boys who was involved in its creation), The Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank is just down the road and scientists at the University of Manchester are heavily involved in research at CERN, including ground-breaking work using the LHC. These scientific credentials have led to Manchester having some truly excellent museums, in my highly biased opinion, some of the best the UK has to offer outside London.\n\nOne museum that means an awful lot to me is MOSI, previously known as the Manchester Museum of Science and Industry. Every summer, we would visit the museum at least once, for me it was a highlight of the holidays. MOSI is and always was, a hands-on museum and I have no doubt that the activities there helped foster and early love of science in me. This year MOSI has re-opened its main building after a £9 million refurbishment. The new look building is slick and modern, whilst retaining much of its old fashioned charm, the museum being housed in the old Liverpool Road Station buildings and including the world's first railway warehouse.\n\nWe spent much of our day between three of the main buildings (the museum spreads over five main areas in total) the Great Western Warehouse, Air & Space Hall and the Power Hall. The GWW is home to exhibitions on the history of science in Manchester, including a full scale replica of \"Baby\" the computer built at the University of Manchester that ran the world's first stored program in 1948. The Science Gallery here tells the story of Manchester scientists and includes four \"holodecks\" that immerse you in the worlds of John Dalton, James Joule, Ernest Rutherford and Sir Bernard Lovell. Around the corner is the Textiles Gallery where you watch old mill machines hard at work and explore the history of the textile industry - central to Manchester's past. Upstairs is Experiment, the hands on gallery aimed at children, although you will often see many adults competing to get a turn too. The exhibits are aimed at all ages; my 18 month old son loved the spinning gas globe, watching the bubbles in the viscosity tubes and dancing in the musical light beams as well as playing in the dedicated toddler zone which is located centrally to the other activities. Older children can enjoy many more hands on puzzles and games. All the activities have boards on the walls beside them, explaining how to use them and the science behind what you are doing.\n\nWe decided to eat lunch at the restaurant which is located in the Great Western Warehouse, right alongside Experiment. The food here is of exceptional quality and very well priced. My husband and I shared a stone baked pizza (yes it was big enough for two adults to share, although we do have small appetites) which was made to order in front of us. The drinks have free refills, still a rarity in the UK and almost unheard of in locations such as this, I also picked up a chocolate whoopie pie which ended up being split between two adults and a toddler with some still left over. The children's options is mainly a pick and mix stand with a good variety of healthy options with some treats available as well.\n\nMy husband and I wanted to check out the Air & Space and Power halls. These are much less exciting for young children - older kids might find them more interesting - so we left our son with his grandma at the hands on area and did these two buildings adults only. The Air & Space Hall has not yet been refurbished, and the difference is very noticeable. This enormous building houses dozens of aeroplanes, cars and motorbikes (many built by local firms) and whilst it is mostly a hands-off display, you can get very up close to many of the vehicles. Upstairs you can walk inside a cross section of a 747 and take a good look inside the cockpit and, nearby, a large screen TV shows a live-feed of the airfield at nearby Manchester International Airport. Also housed inside the hall is the museum's planetarium which gives daily shows on weekdays (weekends during school holidays) although children under six are not permitted to attend.\n\nAcross the road is the Power Hall which houses engines of all shapes and sizes, recollecting Manchester's industrial history. Massive steam powered engines sit beside those powered by gas, oil, hot-air and diesel, in fact the whole room is a steampunk lovers dream, one reminded me greatly of a steampunked firefly engine. Housed inside the former railway transit shed, the back of the building still has track embedded in the floors and here you can get up close with a number of trains, both steam and diesel, the scale of which when stood beside them, are simply breathtaking. One of the smaller steam trains has had portions of it's side removed, allowing you to marvel at the inner workings of the engine.\n\nOutside the Power Hall is a small working station from which you can take a ride behind Planet, a replica of Robert Stephenson's 1830 locomotive, operated for the museum by volunteers. Tickets are surprisingly cheap for the ten minute or so trip, enough so for me to opt to take my son for a ride despite being unsure of his reaction. The train passes by all the museum buildings, allowing you a nice relaxing overview of the museum's sprawling site. The track also briefly runs parallel alongside a mainline rail track connecting some of the major Northern cities and I cannot help but imagine some unknowing commuters being rather surprised to look out of the windows and find themselves running beside a 19th century steam train!\n\nThe museum is so large that we didn't find time to explore two of the buildings. The 1830 Warehouse focuses on the history of communications and electricity. The Electricity Gallery includes recreated rooms from the 1930s and 1950s alongside an English Electric turbo-generator once installed in a nearby power station back in the 1920s and displays on the future of energy supply. Here you can find further information on the role of Manchester in computer development, you can see half of the world's most powerful calculating machine c.1935 and the PEGASUS 1 mainframe computer from 1957. The 1830 Gallery also features a twelve minute audio-visual show the allows you to experience the working life of the warehouse.\n\nThe Station Building has displays on the history of photography, gas and the railway. The Making of Manchester Gallery is included here and tells the story of the city from Roman times (the museum is built within a few minutes walk of the ruins of Mamucium Roman fort which are freely accessible) up until the present day which is represented by a traffic light damaged in the IRA bomb. Finally, the basement of the Station Building hosts the Underground Manchester Gallery - a perennial favourite with kids. Although the story of sanitation may not sound that interesting, getting to tour a Victorian sewer complete with appropriate sights (and smells - yuck) and take a look at the history of toilets appeals to the potty humour of most school age children."
