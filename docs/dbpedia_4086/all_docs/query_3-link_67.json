        "text": "The museum says it is committed to becoming an ever more powerful source of inspiration for learning for more people and the transformation, driven by social purpose, will make the museum more relevant and welcoming to all ages and communities.\n\nIn 2015 the Treasury pledged £5m towards the South Asia Gallery, part of the overall project, and the museum predicts the extension will result in hundreds of thousands of new visitors, including an additional 11,000 school children each year.\n\n“With new world-class spaces for extraordinary objects and stories, more volunteering opportunities and imaginative partnerships, Manchester Museum will reflect and explore the needs, interests and opportunities of the diverse communities we serve,” said new director, Esme Ward. “The project will develop and transform the museum to bring more wonder and inspiration from around the world to the people of Greater Manchester and beyond.”"
