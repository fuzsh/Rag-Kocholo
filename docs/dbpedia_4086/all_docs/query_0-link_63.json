        "text": "The historic entrance to the University of Manchester has been vandalised. Red paint was daubed on and around the archway on Oxford Road in a suspected pro-Palestinian protest.\n\nThe location appears to have been chosen to have most impact as it is the way in to the oldest part of the Univesrity - the Old Quad - designed by Alfred Waterhouse. The attack follows Pro-Palestinian students occupying the University of Manchester campus to protest against the war in Gaza earlier this month.\n\nA University of Manchester spokesperson said: “In the early hours of the morning, 13 May, the University and Manchester Museum were subject to an act of criminal vandalism\n\nREAD NEXT: Emergency crews on scene after reports of fire at house in Bury\n\n“There has been some criminal damage primarily to the Manchester Museum and Queens Arch, with paint sprayed over part of the building early this morning. We have CCTV footage of the incident and are working with Greater Manchester Police who are investigating the incident. Meanwhile, specialist paint removal contractors have been called and will be dealing with the damage as soon as possible. The Museum will be open as usual.”\n\nGreater Manchester Police confirmed they were investigating the incident.\n\nOn May 1st demonstrators set up tents outside university buildings on Brunswick Park saying they will remain at the encampment until the university ‘meets their demands’. It came as similar events occured at campuses across the UK and US and followed several previous protests at the university over the conflict.\n\nIn March a group of approximately 50 students occupied a campus building as part of an ongoing campaign demanding the university end its relationship with a number of Israeli organisations.\n\nThe protest saw students occupy the Simon building for three days as part of a campaign to 'demand the end of UoM ties to Israel, in particular its partnerships with BAE Systems, Tel Aviv University and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem'."
