        "text": "There was still no sun on my second day in Manchester, but we continued to explore anyway. And what better place to go in dreary weather but a Victorian museum? So we spent the afternoon in the Manchester Museum, which dates back to 1867 and is housed in some neo-Gothic buildings at the University of Manchester. It has a little bit of everything, including exhibits of the natural and human history of Manchester, science, live reptiles, archaeology, dinosaurs, and lots of taxidermy animals.\n\nHanging in the museum’s atrium is this whale skeleton, one of its over 600,000 zoological objects, although most are unfortunately not on display. Those exhibited ranged from the beautiful to the grotesque, both in terms of animal and condition. It was really a curious museum, with some very modern presentations along with the old glass cabinets. Some was very scientific, and then you would come across a taxidermy goat wearing a sweater or something.\n\nI thought this flamingo had some sad elegance. It really is strange to look at a flamingo’s neck for a long time without feeling totally confused that it can be a real creature.\n\nWhile much of the taxidermy exhibited was birds, it was hard to miss this particularly terrifying tiger. At least he got to be scary in death and he probably causes a few nightmares in young visitors. I always feel bad for the tough carnivores who are put permanently in docile poses.\n\nHere is where the modern and the Victorian met most sharply at the lower level of the atrium. I’ve never seen neon signs used like this in an old natural history museum. The “Disasters” exhibit on the right had replicas of charred Pompeii bodies and the “Peace” exhibit behind it was full of folded paper cranes.\n\nUnfortunately pushed off to the side was my favorite item in the museum: the skull of Old Billy, the oldest horse on record at 62 years old. He was born in 1760 and lived in Warrington (my Manchester guide Helen’s hometown!), working as a barge horse, pulling barges in the canal from the shore. Here is a lithograph of Old Billy in his living years. Oddly, the skin from his head seems to be exhibited as a taxidermy in Bedford, England. RIP Billy.\n\nIn addition to Old Billy and the whale (new Brooklyn band name right there), were whole cabinets of skeletons. With the shiny black surfaces and artistic lighting, they looked quite striking.\n\nOne of the centerpieces of the Manchester Museum is Stan the T-rex, a cast of a dinosaur discovered in South Dakota. I love the ceilings of this gallery contrasting with the bones.\n\nI greatly enjoyed the walk around the small museum and all the strange specimens it held. I love that it still has some of its 19th century stateliness even while it attempts to modernize and keep people’s interest."
