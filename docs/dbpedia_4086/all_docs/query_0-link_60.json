        "text": "Rare Blue Treasure found in Manchester Museum Herbarium!\n\nGuest post from James Dowling, PhD Student (Biochemistry)\n\nThere I was, sorting through the endless piles of old papers and journals that made up the stockroom of the Herbarium.\n\nI was tasked with searching for âinterestingâ things, which is a very enigmatic term; it suggested, first of all, that there was something interesting to be found, which after hours of unloading boxes I was starting to think was a bit of a pipedream. But more so, it hinted that there was a very real possibility of finding treasure. A glimmering light in the proverbial rubble.\n\nTreasure, from the pirate stories of olde, has always been gold and silver. Never has it been blue. This made it all the more surprising when, beneath the dusty pages of so-and-so journal from 1905 number 27, I spotted something rather peculiarâ¦â¦.\n\nThe jacket was remarkably decorated, and clearly designed with great tact and care, bearing the date 1880 prominently near the bottom. I opened the little book up, and inside was something truly remarkableâ¦.\n\nBleached into the blue pages were a series of ghostly white silhouettes. When you gaze upon them, they appear to gaze right back at you â eternal imprints in time of what Dante might have believed to be a close-up of an angelâs wing.\n\nReturning to the front cover, I could see that, sadly, they werenât evidence of the divine lurking in Herbarium, but instead they were images of ferns from New Zealand.\n\nI brought the little oddity to Rachel, the curator of Botany at the Museum, and she was just as taken by it as I was. Whereas I would have left it on the side as something âcoolâ to look at every once in a while, she was much more astute in getting to the bottom of this mystery â what exactly is this thing?\n\nThatâs when we came across this paper, which described this book in great detail, along with matching photographs.\n\nAs it turns out, in 1880, a botanist called Herbert Dobbie produced something known as âThe Blue Booksâ. In this category are also included books from a couple of years later by another botanist, Eric Craig.\n\nApparently, in very vague fashion, Dobbie said 40 years after publication that he made them using âthe blue-print system which has just reached New Zealandâ. In brief, this involves exposing sensitised mounting paper to sunlight an then washing with potassium bichromate, leaving the characteristic white-on-blue visual effect.\n\nThe question still remained, however â why make these little books? Well, that part isnât so romantic â he stated that he literally wanted to make some money. Out of all the ways to make some cash, this is one of the most creative Iâve come across. To produce pretty books of hauntingly beautiful plants.\n\nThe amount of labour that went into making one âBlue Bookâ was enormous, and combined with no evidence to the contrary, there probably werenât many of these things made. In fact, only 14 copies are known to have survived, 11 of which are in New Zealand libraries.\n\nMaybe that means there are 15 known to exist now?\n\nCurrently, the fate of the little blue treasure has yet to be decided. It will either continue to reside in the Herbarium, though from now on much more appreciated than before, or it will be passed onto another collection.\n\nIt was such a treat to unearth this thing, some 140 years after itâs creation, in near-perfect condition. It begs the question as to what else lies lurking in the back of the Herbarium. Weâll see soon enough, but for now, itâs time to close the book on this one.\n\nBracken\n\nA Memoir\n\nby Daniel Quall King\n\n2019\n\nThis is Bracken, a Patterdale Terrier bitch,\n\n(photographed at her hairdresserâs) who\n\nlives with her dog, Buddy, at Abbey Farm in deepest\n\nNorfolk. They are part of the menagerie\n\nbelonging to Richard Bales and Isabel King.\n\nBut thatâs not what this is all about.\n\nBracken provided the word-association-football*\n\nkickoff for this memoir, thatâs all.\n\n* A Monty Python expression\n\nI lived in Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester, from 2004 to 2010. Having been retired for some years and being fancy-free and in a place where I could pursue an old interest, geology, at university level, I proceeded to take all the geology courses then available to older folk, and even managed an OU credit.\n\nAfter a couple of years of improving my knowledge of geology but having run out of adult courses, I thought Iâd see if the Manchester Museum at the University of Manchester needed any volunteers in that department. They didnât; but âDo you know anything about botany? They could do with some help.â âWell, no, but I could learn.â In this way I was set to spend some fascinating years with the people who were then the staff and volunteers in the Manchester Museum Herbarium.\n\nI was fortunate to live on a good bus route, so once or twice a week I headed off to the university and gradually got to know my way around the herbarium.\n\nThe museum, having grown like Topsy, is a bit of a warren; the herbarium is located in the tower and attic of Manchester Museum near the entrance to the original quadrangle.\n\nCast of Characters (Then)\n\nLeander Wolstenholme, Curator of Botany here giving a tour of the herbarium. A member of probably the last generation of research-centred curators, Leander was one of those people with an extraordinary memory for all things botanical. For some years he was an editor of the Journal of the Botanical Society of the British Isles. A person of great kindness and humour.\n\nLindsey Loughtman, the ever-helpful Curatorial Assistant (part-time).\n\nSuzanne Grieve, Curatorial Assistant (part-time).\n\nMatt Lowe, Curatorial Assistant (later at the Zoological Museum, University of Cambridge).\n\nPriscilla Tolfree, retired university librarian and lifelong plant enthusiast.\n\nAudrey Locksley, Patriciaâs botany pal and another very knowledgeable amateur.\n\nBarbara Porter, who collected rare ferns and had a garden full of them which she bequeathed to the University. We transplanted them to the universityâs Botanical Experimental Ground in Fallowfield.\n\nDave Bishop (Retired industrial chemist, Mersey Valley botany expert).\n\nDavid Earl, County Recorder for both the Lancashire vice counties (S, 59 & W, 60); another botanist with a remarkable memory. Fondly referred to by Patricia as âthe fount of all knowledgeâ.\n\nDaniel King, rank amateur, but very curious.\n\nThe story of the founding of the MMHerb is interesting enough, and a potted version of it is included at the end of this memoir. Once Matt Lowe trained me up to take photos and put them online at http://harbour.man.ac.uk/mmcustom/BotQuery.php , most of the material I was put to work on was in the Grindon Herbarium, a unique collection of specimens, illustrations and printed material.\n\nHowever, thatâs just to get the ball rolling. Or the seed germinating (sorry).\n\nOne morning I de-bussed as usual at Oxford Road and made my way to the quad and up to the herbarium for a morning of photography and putting-on-line. But when it came time for cuppas, up on the raised bit of platform that accommodated a couple of office desks and enough seats for a tea-break, sitting in a group approximating the demeanour of a court martial were Suzanne, Leander and Lindsey. I negotiated the steps and made for the kettle, but before I could do anything with it, an ominous âDannn â¦ â with interesting inflections emerged from Lindsey. No-one cracked a smile. So I smiled and said âHi!â, thinking, âThis is seriousâ. And I hadnât even dropped the camera. âWeâve got a proposal for you. You know the illustrations in the Grindon Herbarium? We thought you might be interested in identifying the publications they were taken from.â Nonplussed, I was, thinking the trio had misidentified me as the Yoda of the graphic world. The Grindon Herbarium isnât small, and over the many years Leopold Hartley Grindon had assembled the material, there must have accumulated many hundreds, perhaps thousands, of loose illustrations and articles taken from damaged or incomplete botanical books. What a job thatâd be! All I could do was look at Leander and ask, âHow long do you think it would take?â He looked away thoughtfully for a few seconds, and then, back in eye contact, he said âMaybe three or four yearsâ.\n\nTo make a long story somewhat shorter, the main result of a couple of years of research was two articles, with checklists, about the Grindon Herbarium and the sources of the illustrative and other material it contains. There are materials from 24 of the popular botanical periodicals of the day; and from books and serial publications, 78 (published 2007) in Archives of Natural History and another 17 (2009) for a total of 95. Of course, never having submitted an article for publication in a scholarly periodical, I relied a great deal on advice from Leander about the commentary in the articles.\n\nWe were all very pleased when the articles were accepted. They are in ANH Vol. 34 (1): 129-139, April 2007, and Vol. 36 (2): October 2009. The latter is in the Short Notes section, p.354 ff. Archives of Natural History is published by The Society for the History of Natural History (yes, really), which has offices in the Natural History Museum in London. This may be one of the least-known scholarly publications in the world, but has fascinating articles about such things as the great voyages of discovery and so forth. For the enthusiast, the Manchester Museum Collections Database contains within a larger number, the original 700 or so images from the Grindon. If you type botanical prints and drawings into the Botany search window, it brings up most of them.\n\nSo what happened to the bracken? When Bracken the pup got her name, it eventually reminded me of an item in Grindon â a pair of exquisite pen-and-ink drawings on tracing paper, as well as a set of printerâs proofs, of Pteridium aquilinum, or bracken to you and me. According to my information, the spores of ordinary bracken are so light that theyâve spread to all corners of the botanical globe, including the often very isolated islands of the South Atlantic. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pteridium_aquilinum .\n\nAlthough the original photo files of the illustrations are large and adequate to do justice to the extremely fine work in them, the software that uploads them into the KE Emu database condenses the information to such an extent that the delicacy and detail in the original are lost.\n\nHereâs what the online photo of the original looks like:\n\nBut what a good excuse to visit the herbarium and see the originals! The illustrations were made for the translation of Julien Marie Crozetâs 1771-1772 account of his voyage of discovery to the South Atlantic, published in 1891. Hereâs the relevant section:\n\nhttp://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks13/1306431h.html yields: H. Ling Roth, transl., Crozetâs Voyage to Tasmania, New Zealand the Ladrone Islands, and the Philippines in the Years 1771-1772. London: Truslove & Shirley, 143, Oxford Street, W.; 1891. p35ff:\n\nThe Food of the Inhabitants of the North of New Zealand.\n\nWe were extremely well received by the savages. They came in mobs on to the vessels and appeared there every day, and we went similarly to their villages and into their houses with the greatest security. This naturally gave us every facility for seeing how these people fed themselves, what were their occupations, their works, their industry, and even their amusements.\n\nWe have already noticed that the basis of the food of these people is the root of a fern absolutely similar to ours, with the sole difference that in some places the New Zealand fern has a much bigger and longer root and its fronds grow to greater length.[1]\n\n[1 The New Zealand fern is Pteris aquiline, var. esculenta, and the European species is Pteris aquiline. The difference is thus very slight. See Figs. 17 and 18.]\n\nHaving pulled up the root they dry it for several days in the air and sun. When they wish to eat it they hold it before the fire, roast it lightly, pound it between two stones, and when in this state they chew it in order to obtain the juices, which to me appeared farinaceous; when they have nothing else to eat, they eat even the woody fibre; but when they have fish or shellfish or some other dish, they only chew the root and reject the fibre.\n\nThese people live also principally on fish and on shellfish; they eat quail, ducks and other aquatic birds which abound in their country, also various species of birds, dogs, rats, and finally they eat their enemies.\n\nThe New Zealanders have no vessel in which to cook their meat; the general custom in all the villages we visited was to cook the meat and fish in a sort of subterranean oven. In every kitchen there is a hole one and a half feet deep and two feet in diameter; on the bottom of the hole they place stones, on the stones they place wood which they light, on this wood they place a layer of flat stones which they make red hot, and on these latter stones they place the meat or fish which they desire to cook.\n\nThey also live on potatoes and gourds, which they cook in the same way as their meat. Their habits in eating are dirty.\n\nI have also seen them eat a sort of green gum which they like immensely, but I was not able to find out the tree from which they obtained it. Some of us ate of this by letting it drop in our mouths. We all found it very heating.\n\nWe also remarked that the savages eat regularly twice a day, once in the morning, the other time at sunset. As they are all strong, hardy, big, well-formed, and with good constitution, one concludes that their food is very healthy, and I think it well to repeat here that fern root forms the basis of their food.\n\nGenerally speaking they appeared to me to be great eaters; when they came on board our vessel, we could not satisfy them sufficiently with the biscuit which they liked immensely. When the sailors were eating they would approach them in order to get a portion of their soup and of their salt meat. The sailors used to give them the remains on their platters, which the savages took care to clean out thoroughly; they were very fond of fat and even of tallow. I have even seen them take the tallow from the sounding lead or tallow otherwise used in the ship and eat it as a tasty morsel. They were very partial to sugar; they drank tea and coffee with us, and liked our drinks according as they were more or less sweetened. They showed great repugnance for wine, and especially for strong liquors; they do not like salt and do not eat it. They drink a great deal of water, and when I saw them very thirsty, I used to think that this desire to be continually drinking was caused by their dry food, the fern root.\n\nThe Manchester Museum Herbarium\n\nThe MANCH [coded for reference] herbarium is held within The Manchester Museum, part of The University of Manchester. It contains approximately 1 million specimens covering a world-wide distribution. It was founded in 1860 by the coalition of several major individual or corporate collections. In particular, the two nineteenth-century Manchester businessmen and amateur naturalists, Charles Bailey and Cosmo Melvill, inspired by the original and substantial collections of the Manchester Natural History Society, collaborated to collect and buy plant material from around the world, and arranged for their final deposition at the Museum. Bailey and Melvill alone provided a wide range of plant collections unequalled by any but a few major national museums. Also, at that time the museum acquired the very special collection of plants, many cultivated, together with illustrations and text, that were assembled by Leo Grindon in connection with his pioneering work in Adult Education.\n\nIn addition to this foundation material, the Museumâs Herbarium incorporates collections from thousands of other people, ranging from small personal herbariums donated or bequeathed, to material collected today by expeditions to tropical rain forests and other endangered habitats. There are also many items of historical importance and interest, such as specimens collected by Charles Darwin during the voyage of the Beagle, specimens collected by Admiral Franklinâs expeditions in search of the N.W. Passage, and collections of the great Swedish naturalist Linnaeus. In particular, the 16,500 Richard Spruce items (mostly Amazon and Andes hepatics) have a value far in excess of their number.\n\nDQK Note: At the time when I worked there, the herbarium collection was reckoned to be the fourth largest in the British Isles. Some of the others are at London (Kew and the Natural History Museum), Glasnevin, Edinburgh and Cambridge. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_herbaria_in_Europe#British_Isles .\n\nMy week at the Natural History Museum, London\n\nI spent a wonderful week at the Natural History Museum, London (NHM) on a placement. The aim of the scheme is to exchange knowledge, aid professional development and enable lasting change.\n\nI learnt and experienced so much â here are some highlights.\n\nMy host was Ranee Prakesh, Curator of Flowering Plants. After my induction, she gave me a tour of the herbarium and Darwin Centre gallery, both housed in a purpose built cocoon:\n\nIn the afternoon I learnt about NHMâs Digital Collections project, and then got to work. I scanned herbarium sheets on a Herbscan machine â an upside down scanner. Some of the sheets had writing on the back so both sides had to be scanned. The images would be added to the museumâs database later.\n\nOn the second day, I was shown how NHM staff use Emu, the museumâs database, and learnt about the current rapid digitisation project. Herbarium specimens are shipped to The Netherlands for imaging on a conveyor belt / camera system called Digistreet, then the data from the images will be transcribed in Suriname. The NHM staff were waiting to find out the quality of the data.\n\nI shared ideas with the plant mounting team, demonstrating âManchester styleâ (strapping) and having a go at the NHM way (glueing and pressing). They were surprised I cut my own straps from archival quality paper: sometimes the best way is not always the most expensive way. Thatâs one of the many things I love about curatorial work.\n\nI was shown how loans were documented and packed in the afternoon, and how the NHM staff process a loan on Ke Emu.\n\nDay 3 was spent in the herbarium store. Ranee explained how the herbarium sheets are arranged taxonomically according to APG, and filed geographically within this system. I spent some time sorting specimens to family and genus level in preparation for laying-in. The open plan workspace was visible through a window in the gallery so I had the public watching me at work!\n\nLater that day I had a tour of the Specimen Preparation Area to see the V-Factor volunteers at work. They were sorting through sediment from a quarry, looking for tiny fossils, and a different project is run each weekday in this area visible from the museum gallery.\n\nThe fourth day was spent in The Cryptogamic Herbarium. I had a short tour of the bryophyte collection then got to work repackaging mosses into individual capsules:\n\nI was showed round the historical collections and the fern herbarium in the afternoon. We discussed Integrated Pest Management and preventative conservation in relation to historic botany collections.\n\nI also worked alongside Ranee laying out specimens ready for the plant mounters. This involved placing the pressed specimen and label on a sheet of mounting paper and enclosing any loose material in a capsule. There was a large amount of newly donated material to be mounted and filed in the herbarium sent in from researchers and staff on expeditions.\n\nOn the fifth day I had a tour of the Linnean Society. Carl Linnaeusâs personal herbarium in particular was amazing to see.\n\nNext, I learnt about citizen science at the Angela Marmont Centre for UK Biodiversity. This is where the public gather or analyse data for research or curatorial purposes, such as transcribing data from a bird register, which is an NHM project called âNotes from Natureâ currently running on Zooniverse.\n\nTo wrap it all up there was a tea party at the end of my last day. It was lovely to see the staff I had met during the week and thank them all for giving up their time and making me feel so welcome. I am intending that some lasting change will happen at Manchester Museum as a result of my week at the NHM, particularly better storage for our type specimens and some changes to volunteering.\n\nMany thanks to all the curators and collections managers at the NHM who allowed me this fantastic opportunity."
