        "text": "The Currier Museum has recently completed the reinstallation of many of our galleries, including the entire second floor. The new galleries develop themes which cut across European, American, and Asian cultures, and combine historic and contemporary works.\n\nGuests are invited to explore the museum’s collection in new contexts with the inclusion of striking new additions.\n\nA 19th-Century Collection\n\nCollectors historically sought interesting objects from all over the world, a trend encouraged by international trade. The idea that Americans collected only American art is false. Moreover, artists came from all over the world to work in the United States, and many of the most famous American painters have strong international connections.\n\nNature and Nostalgia\n\nAmerican landscape paintings tapped optimistic memories. The 19th and 20th centuries were periods of tremendous change brought by war, industrialization, and the growth of cities. Views of nature reminded viewers of a simpler, rural past.\n\nWhile landscapes often avoid social problems, they sometimes address the destruction of nature. Philip Guston and Musa McKim’s paintings show how the White Mountains were restored after brutal destruction. Manchester’s massive mills were similarly saved from demolition, as shown by Charles Sheeler."
