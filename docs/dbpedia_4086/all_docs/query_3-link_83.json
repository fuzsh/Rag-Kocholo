        "text": "Welcome to this latest edition of Aerodrome and our regular look at the fascinating world of aeroplanes and the historic aviation scene in the UK.\n\nEven though we find ourselves in the depths of winter and the first Airshow events of the year are still many weeks away, the world of historic aviation never stays still and you can always find something to report on, if you just know where to look. Thanks to the kind assistance of a professional company in the field of aircraft dismantling and transportation, we have something really special for you this week, something which is of huge historic importance to the Manchester area, but also to the wider aviation preservation movement. Last year’s announcement that Manchester’s Science and Industry Museum has decided to close its Air and Space Exhibition Hall came as a bitter blow for many people in this part of the world, even though if we are being honest with ourselves, the writing had been on this particular wall for quite some time.\n\nIn our latest blog, we will be looking at the history of Manchester’s Air & Space collection, the reasons behind this significant decision and thanks to the fantastic people at GJD Services, a specialist aircraft asset management company, bring you a spectacular selection of images from behind the dismantling and re-homing operation itself. Marking the end of an aircraft display which brought pleasure to many thousands of people in the North West region, we look at where the various aircraft have ended up and whether enthusiasts will be able to see them on display in future.\n\nAn unusual home for an aircraft collection\n\nHistoric in its own right, the old Lower Campsfield Market building, just off Deansgate was perhaps an unlikely place to expect to find an impressive collection of preserved aeroplanes.\n\nFor most of the past thirty-nine years or so, visitors to Manchester city centre who had an interest in aviation history had the opportunity to gaze upon an impressive collection of aircraft, all gathered together in what was essentially an old market hall. Situated in the Castlefield area of the city, just off the famous A56 Deansgate Road, the Air and Space Hall building was across from the main Science and Industry Museum site with its own entrance, a celebration of Manchester’s rich aviation heritage, including several rather sizeable exhibits. In actual fact, the building which housed the exhibits had equal historic billing as the aircraft it protected, which made a visit to this collection all the more memorable.\n\nBuilt in 1876 to house the then open air Lower Campsfield Market, the building was constructed using an iron skeleton and the extensive use of glass panels and underlining its importance to Manchester’s proud and long-standing industrial heritage, it is protected by a grade II listing. By 1900, this impressive building became the City Exhibition Hall and over the years, many events and public exhibitions have been housed within its distinctive structure, quickly becoming one of the most famous buildings in the wider Manchester area and a reason many people ventured into the city centre.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the building was used for the construction of barrage balloons, which would be positioned around the region to defend against Luftwaffe bombing attacks. Following the end of hostilities, the building reverted to the City Exhibition Hall, where it would host such events as the 1953 Brighter Homes Exhibition, an impressive undertaking which included two completely built houses and all the latest consumer household labour saving devices.\n\nGiving some idea of the unusual display space inside Manchester’s Air and Space Museum, the aircraft had to be positioned between the iron supports which were holding the roof up.\n\nOf particular interest to this feature, the building took on its role as the the Air and Space Hall of the Museum of Science and Industry collection in May 1983 and in the process, offered this unique display venue for an impressive collection of aircraft and aviation memorabilia. Once inside, you can’t fail to be impressed by the construction of this historic building and how the museum team managed to shoehorn this collection of aeroplanes into what is basically an old market hall. The aircraft exhibits are arranged between sturdy iron support columns, which keep the original glazed roof structure safely in place, but dictate the position and viewing angles at which the aircraft exhibits can be displayed. There was also originally an elevated public viewing gallery, which extended around three sides of the museum and offered visitors a unique viewing perspective of the displays. Having enjoyed many a trip to the collection, this was definitely one of my favourite features of the Air and Space Museum and allowed for some interesting pictures to be taken.\n\nOver recent years, I am embarrassed to say that I had not managed to visit Manchester’s aviation collection as often as I had in the past and how my final visit proved to be something of a disappointment. Hoping to take up my usual photographic position on the elevated viewing gallery, I was told by museum staff that the condition of the building had made these sections unsafe and as it would cost them in the region of one Million pounds to put the building right, the balcony was out of bounds for the foreseeable future. That was a few years ago now and whilst it did highlight the plight of the museum and its collection, it should have probably put us on alert for what we are now coming to terms with. The museum staff member I was talking to went on to describe how the building was virtually impossible to heat effectively and the roof is now in poor condition and in need of significant and costly remedial works. The building is leased from Manchester Council and its listed status significantly increases the cost of any works they place tenders out for.\n\nWhat goes in has to come out\n\nThis Supermarine Spitfire FR.XIVe left the collection to go back to RAF Museum Hendon in 2014, perhaps an early indication of aviation things to come at the Manchester site.\n\nBack in 2014, I remember seeing pictures of the operation to dismantle a Spitfire FR.XIVe which was on display at Manchester’s Air and Space Museum and take it back to the RAF Museum at Hendon to form part of a new display down there. Reports and pictures showed how the team responsible for the task had to remove part of the glass frontage of the museum building to get the Spitfire out and I remember thinking at the time, I would have loved to have documented that process, just in the name of local history.\n\nWith that still in my memory, last year’s announcement that the entire collection was to be moved out of the old Campsfield Market building site put me on notice that I had to make an official approach to the museum, with the intention of covering this historic operation for posterity. As the start date for work to get underway approached, I had yet to hear back from the museum and assumed that for many perfectly understandable reasons, they were unable to facilitate my request, but when images of the operation began to circulate via social media, I certainly felt like this was a massive missed opportunity for me. Thankfully, I managed to make contact with the team who completed this specialised task and they graciously allowed me to use a selection of the images taken by team members during the various dismantling projects. The majority of the images illustrating this feature are being shown courtesy of Gary Spoors and his team from GJD Services and we are extremely grateful for their help. Please do not copy and republish the pictures without first seeking the permission of Mr Spoors.\n\nAvro Shackleton AEW Mk.2 WR960 ‘Dougal’\n\nWithout doubt the most impressive aircraft on display at the Air and Space Museum, how on earth did they get this Shackleton in, or perhaps more importantly, how were they going to get it out?\n\nFor its sheer presence alone, Avro Shackleton AEW Mk.2 WR960 ‘Dougal’ was undoubtedly the most impressive exhibit at the Air & Space Museum and begs the question, how on earth did they get it in. Perhaps more importantly for this feature, how were they going to get it out? An aircraft type which can trace its lineage back to the famous Avro Lancaster bomber, another high profile product of the Lancastrian aviation industry, the Shackleton was a long-range maritime patrol aircraft, used primarily on anti-submarine operations, but was also required to perform a number of other essential roles. Entering RAF service in 1951, the majority of Shackletons were powered by the mighty Rolls Royce Griffon engine and had the distinction of being the last aircraft in the illustrious line of four engined propeller powered bomber aircraft to see Royal Air Force service.\n\nBearing in mind the sheer size of the Shackleton and the lack of available space within Manchester’s Air & Space Museum, this is probably the last aircraft visitors expected to see on display, however, she certainly made for an impressive sight and a stunning centrepiece to this collection. The aircraft was constructed as an MR.2 variant at Woodford aerodrome during 1953 and went on to make her first flight early in 1954. She entered service with the Royal Air Force later the same year and throughout her service career would go on to represent Nos 8, 42, 205, 210 and 228 Squadrons, as well as spending time on charge with the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment. In 1972, WR960 returned to Woodford for conversion to Airborne Early Warning (AEW) configuration, which is how she was displayed in the museum.\n\nWith grateful thanks to the engineers involved, this next series of images show the Manchester Shackleton at various stages of dismantling, the only way they would ever be able to get this monster out of this grade II listed building.\n\nAs the British government of the day announced their intention to scrap the aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal in the 1970s, the Navy were concerned that their ships would lose vital airborne early warning support, which could not be allowed to happen. The solution was to remove the radar units from their Fairey Gannet aircraft and adapt them to fit inside RAF Avro Shackletons and even though these would clearly be land based aircraft, the impressive endurance of the Shackleton would greatly enhance the effectiveness of the Navy’s airborne early warning capabilities. Twelve Shackleton airframes would eventually be converted to AEW Mk.2 standard and operate in the colours of No.8 Squadron, originally at RAF Kinloss from early 1972, but following completion of significant runway strengthening works at nearby RAF Lossiemouth, moving there from August 1973. They would remain at Lossiemouth until the unit finally disbanded in 1991.\n\nAvro Shackleton AEW Mk.2 WR960 carries a distinctive piece of fuselage artwork, which tells an interesting story about the AEW Shackletons of No.8 Squadron. All twelve of the Squadron’s aircraft were named after characters from either ‘The Magic Roundabout’ or ‘The Herbs’ children’s TV programmes of the 1960’s, with WR960 proudly wearing the name ‘Dougal’ after the sugar loving dog from ‘The Magic Roundabout’ children’s TV series.\n\nThere doesn’t appear to be a definitive reason why these aircraft were named after these particular characters, but appears to be connected in some way with Shackleton T.4 VP293, which saw service with the Royal Aircraft Establishment. This particular aircraft apparently had a tendency to bounce on landing, something which earned it the nickname ‘Zebedee’, after the talking jack-in-a-box from ‘The Magic Roundabout’. Perhaps some members of RAF No. 8 Squadron spent time serving on VP293 and were only too aware of the aircraft’s unofficial nickname, bringing the tradition to their current Shackleton fleet. Whatever the reason, the unusual artwork on ‘Dougal’ and the story behind its origins only serves to further endear these mighty aircraft to anyone discovering the tale.\n\nA beautiful job, it looks as if ‘Dougal’ could be reassembled to fly once more, should someone be willing to stump up the millions to make that happen.\n\nArriving at her new home, the hope is that Avro Shackleton AEW Mk.2 WR960 will go on display at the Avro Heritage Museum in the not too distant future.\n\nViewed as a convenient stop-gap airborne early warning arrangement at the time, the Shackletons of No. 8 Squadron would actually go on to provide Britain with almost 19 years of continuous service, with the final AEW Shackleton aircraft retiring in June 1991.\n\nAs far as the recent Manchester Museum aircraft movement project was concerned, the removal of the Shackleton was the one people were most interested in, not only because of its historical connections to the region, but also because of the simple logistics of the operation. As you can see from the pictures attached, the aircraft was professionally dismantled by GJD Services, before sections were loaded on trucks for transportation to her new home, but not before glazed sections of the building’s front had been removed. The aircraft was transported the short distance to the Avro Heritage Museum, which is on the site where she was constructed and test flown some 68 years earlier. She will initially be held in storage, until arrangements can be made for her to go on public display.\n\nAvro 707A WZ736\n\nA view from the gallery. This image was taken many years ago, when it was still possible to gain access to the balcony and take an elevated view of the collection.\n\nAnother famous Avro design which has strong links to the aviation industry in the North West is the Vulcan and whilst the museum couldn’t actually boast one of these aviation behemoths as part of its collection (now wouldn’t that have been a sight), it could claim to be the home of an aircraft used during its development. The Avro 707A (WZ736) was a rather distinctive looking experimental jet aircraft, produced to test the tailless delta configuration to be used on the Avro Vulcan, but more specifically, the low speed handling characteristics of the aircraft. The aircraft was basically an airworthy 1/3rd scale version of the Vulcan.\n\nWZ736 was the second 707A experimental aircraft to be constructed and even though the Vulcan prototype had already flown by that time, it was decided to produce the aircraft nonetheless, with a view to speeding up the overall development programme. Constructed at the Avro facility at Bracebridge Heath, near Lincoln, the aircraft was transported by road to RAF Waddington, where it made its maiden flight on 20th February 1953. Piloted by American pilot Sqn. Ldr. J.C Nelson, the aircraft flew from Waddington to the Avro airfield facility at Woodford, near Manchester.\n\nWhilst the aircraft was at Woodford, powered flying controls were installed on the direct recommendation of Vulcan test pilot Roland Falk and it went on to provide valuable data for both the Vulcan project and high speed delta flight in general. Following its time at Woodford, WZ736 would go on to serve with the Royal Aircraft Establishment at both Farnborough and Bedford and was used in auto-throttle development trials, as well as a host of general flight research projects. Finally withdrawn from service in the summer of 1962, she was used as a spares aircraft to keep the other machines in the Avro 707 fleet flying.\n\nNot so mighty delta, the Avro 707 was used to gather flight data throughout the Vulcan development programme.\n\nPreparing to take flight, the Avro 707 and Bristol Belvedere being prepared for the journeys to their new homes.\n\nWearing its distinctive all-over deep orange paint finish, WZ736 made for an extremely futuristic aviation addition to the list of Manchester Air and Space museum exhibits and one which possessed strong links to one of the most important post war Avro aircraft designs, the mighty Vulcan. The colour of the aircraft is an interesting story in its own right, as most of the 707 research planes were finished in distinctive, colourful schemes, possibly to make them more visible and certainly to signify the specific flight trials the different airframes were involved with.\n\nStill a futuristic looking aircraft, WZ736 is now in the care of the Boscombe Down Aviation Collection and should be on public display again very soon.\n\nEnglish Electric P.1A WG763\n\nAnother product of the Lancashire aviation industry, the P.1A was an important development aircraft in the production of the supersonic Lightning fighter. It was previously positioned at the very front of Manchester’s Air and Space Museum.\n\nFor Workbench readers of a certain vintage, many of us would argue that the English Electric (BAC) Lightning was possibly the most exciting jet aircraft ever produced by the British aviation industry, particularly if we were fortunate enough to have actually seen one during its service career. Another product of Lancashire’s proud aviation heritage, this powerful supersonic fighter served as Britain’s primary interceptor aircraft throughout much of the Cold War period, possessing blistering performance statistics which would eclipse many similar aircraft in service to this day. Powered by a pair of Rolls Royce Avon engines stacked one on top of the other, the Lightning was always a fuel hungry beast and its designers were constantly challenged to try and provide more fuel carrying capacity for the aircraft, to allow it to stay in the air for longer periods.\n\nLightning WG763 which was previously on display at the Air and Space Museum, is a P.1A development aircraft and provided the English Electric Company with critical research data, as they sought to bring this incredible aircraft to squadron service status. She was effectively hand built by engineers at the English Electric’s Salmesbury factory near Preston and manufactured in this pristine natural metal finish. Built as the second P.1 Lightning, this experimental aircraft first flew on 18th July 1955 and was used to assess the potential fighting capabilities of the new jet, flying with cannon armament in its nose and also performing flight trials with various additional fuel carrying modifications. The Lightning P.1A is a deceptively large aeroplane and during her time at Manchester, provided visitors to the museum with a particularly polished aviation welcome, as she was situated at the entrance of the display, the first aircraft to greet you upon your arrival.\n\nNot a job for the inexperienced, the Museum’s aircraft were expertly dismantled by the GJD Services team, before transporting them to their new homes and in some cases, reassembly.\n\nThese fascinating images give a good indication of how these historic aircraft were designed and assembled.\n\nThe Lightning P.1A has also found a new home down at the Boscombe Down Aviation Collection, so even though she has to get used to new surroundings after spending so many years in Manchester, she at least has the Avro 707A for company.\n\nBristol Belvedere HC.1 XG454\n\nAnother image taken from the viewing gallery at the Air and Space Museum, this time featuring the beautiful Bristol Belvedere twin rotor helicopter.\n\nAn aircraft which came close to rivalling the Shackleton in the Air and Space Museum stature stakes, Bristol Belvedere HC.1 XG454 was one of the undoubted starts of the collection and an exhibit which appeared to be in remarkably good condition. This impressively large tandem rotor military helicopter has the distinction of being the only British designed aircraft of its type to have ever entered production and with just 26 machines produced, this is quite a rare bird. Designed as an effective heavy lift helicopter, the Belvedere was intended to perform a variety of essential tasks at a time when the flexibility offered by reliable rotary air power was appealing to all the world’s major air powers.\n\nThe Belvedere could be used for troop transportation, supply dropping, casualty evacuation and special operations duties, in all but the most inhospitable of operating environments. Also possessing numerous non-military attributes, a Belvedere was famously used to transport and lower the 80ft tall spire atop the new Coventry Cathedral in 1962, further underlining the effectiveness of good helicopter design. Unfortunately, the RAF service career of the Belvedere would turn out to be rather short, lasting just eight years from its introduction in 1961.\n\nBelvedere HC.1 XG454 made its first flight from the helicopter manufacturing site at Oldmixon, Weston in 1960 and was one of three pre-production machines later sent to the Belvedere Trials Unit at RAF Odiham. This unit would go on to reform as No.66 Squadron Royal Air Force in 1961. Following her relatively short service career, she was held in storage at RAF Henlow for the RAF Museum, before leaving by road in early 1983 to feature as one of the exhibits at the new Air and Space exhibition at Manchester’s Museum of Science and Industry, where she would stay for the next 39 years.\n\nA new home for a much-loved piece of helicopter heritage, Manchester’s Belvedere arrives at the Helicopter Museum at Weston-super-Mare.\n\nFollowing her recent move from the Manchester Museum site, this magnificent helicopter has had its ownership transferred from the RAF Museum to the Helicopter Museum and is now back in Weston-super-Mare, the town from where she made her first flight almost 62 years ago.\n\nAlthough it is incredibly sad that Manchester has now lost a significant feature of its aviation heritage, it is comforting to know these popular exhibits which were admired by so many local people, have all found new homes and will still be available for public viewing in the near future. At least we will be keeping our beloved ‘Dougal’, who will now be displayed on the very site where the aircraft was constructed almost 70 years ago. When the Shackleton is eventually unveiled as a major new exhibit at the Avro Heritage Museum, we will endeavour to be there to cover the event and inform Aerodrome readers about the occasion.\n\nIt was a shame that we were unable to document the entire dismantling process of the Manchester Air and Space Museum collection, if only for the preservation of local aviation history, however, we are extremely grateful to Gary Spoors and his GJD Services team for allowing us access to these magnificent images and giving us this fascinating insight into their highly specialized work. I must admit, I wouldn’t really like the responsibility of dismantling and moving something like a mighty Avro ‘Growler’!\n\nThat’s it for another edition of Aerodrome.
