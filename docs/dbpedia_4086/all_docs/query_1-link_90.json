        "text": "There must have been several copies – produced later by artist Wang Yuanqi – but they are rare now, and two are in the possession of the John Rylands Library at the University of Manchester in the UK.\n\nIn stages, they are being displayed as part of an ambitious new China Gallery at the Manchester Museum, which reopened in the northern English city last month after being closed for 18 months.\n\nLooking at it while standing in the gallery surrounded by visitors of all ages and backgrounds, I imagine Manchester depicted in a similar way.\n\nA modern scroll could start south of the city, then move north along Oxford Road to the Manchester Museum. It might continue past the unique Poetry Library (with its several shelves of Chinese verse) and cut across to pass the famous Factory nightclub on Princess Street, then through Chinatown, to the trendy Northern Quarter.\n\nWhich is why the new Lee Kai Hung Chinese Culture Gallery is so timely.\n\nAlthough, as its curator Bryan Sitch says when he shows me around not long after the opening, “It’s not actually about China”.\n\nInstead it’s about how China and Manchester have interacted over the past century and a half. Mostly harmoniously, sometimes not, but with the stories and artefacts collected in the hope that by celebrating the good parts, there will be even more harmony in the future.\n\nIt started after a gift, in 2017, by Manchester and Hong Kong businessman Lee Kai Hung.\n\nA quote from him about cultures living in peace together is inscribed around a wooden moon gate that visitors step through as they enter, passing to their right a cascade of “moon windows” by contemporary British artist Gordon Cheung and seemingly tumbling down into the atrium beyond.\n\nThe double effect of great circles indicates you are entering a sacred, or at least a special, space.\n\nAlmost everyone stops at the display containing a giant stuffed deer. Or is it even a deer?\n\nIn Chinese, the Père David’s deer, or milu, is called the sibuxiang, the “four not like”, because of its face like that of a horse, its tail like that of a donkey, its hooves like those of a cow and its antlers like those of a stag.\n\nIts reintroduction to China after becoming extinct in Asia is a good example of collaboration between West and East. Even though it started with a theft.\n\nA French missionary, Père David, spotted the species in 1866 in the hunting park of the Qing emperor. He learned that those 200 animals were the only ones remaining in the world and he bribed guards to let him get some live animals to send to France.\n\nWhich is just as well, because soon afterwards the emperor’s herd was slaughtered during the Boxer Rebellion, leaving the only remaining milu in Europe, mostly in the parklands of the Duke of Bedford, at Woburn, in the UK.\n\nIn the 1980s, London sent some of them to Beijing as a gift, and today there are more than 10,000 thriving in the semi-wildlands of China’s national parks.\n\nAs I walk through the gallery I have a strong sense that if I slow down, I will learn stories I did not know. And see ones I did know from a new perspective.\n\nThere is a large picture that changes colour as I walk past, like those lenti­cular postcards I loved as a child. The landscape goes from brown desert to lush green and back again.\n\nLike all of us, I have become used to this kind of before and after showing the loss caused by greed or climate change or both.\n\nBut this one has time-travelled the other way.\n\nIn the past century the Loess Plateau, in northern China, became desert. But a World Bank loan in the 1980s encouraged villagers to create terraces and slow down the soil erosion.\n\nA photo shows the Manchester team who went out to learn how it was done, and created a trial site in Gorton, on the edge of the city. Already it’s doing its work, and floods have been reduced.\n\nSitch shows me some of the many emails that reveal how widely he and the team, and their many collaborators in China and from Manchester’s Chinese community, have journeyed, both literally and subject-wide, to find stories for this exhibition.\n\nFor example, there is a night sky installation, celebrating what is sometimes called “Chinese Valentine’s Day”, the seventh day of the seventh month – usually early August – when two stars, Vega and Altair, are both visible in the night sky, albeit separated by the Milky Way.\n\nThe panels tell the story of Zhinü, the weaving princess, and Niulang, a cowherd. They fell in love, but the Queen of Heaven tried to keep them apart. She not only made them stars but also placed them as far away from each other as possible.\n\nA flock of magpies took pity and once a year, the story goes, they make a bridge, which is the Milky Way.\n\nWhen one of the front-of-house staff hears the story, she says, she feels like crying. “You’ll need tissues for this bit,” she says.\n\nIt’s symbolic of course: everything in this gallery is symbolic. Everything wants to say, in different ways, through different objects and stories, that we live under the same sky but we interpret it in different ways.\n\nNext door is the South Asia Gallery, with stories about Manchester’s links with the Indian subcontinent. Towards the end of the display there is a Brother sewing machine, probably from the 1950s or ’60s, in a prominent position on its own little table.\n\nI’m standing looking at it when an excited young woman, perhaps 18 years old, with a headscarf, begins talking to me.\n\n“We’ve got two of those at home,” she says, in a strong Manchester accent. “My grandfather was a tailor and he came from Pakistan. And he used to make suits and shirts.\n\n“They’re in the garage,” she continues. Then grins. “I’ll have to tell my mum. Honestly, we never had any idea they were special.”\n\nAnd she dances off to join her friends. I watch them as she recounts the story again and they all look back at the sewing machine with that same wonder.\n\nThis is sometimes the magic of objects. When institutions like museums celebrate the ordinary as well as the extraordinary, they enable us to celebrate our own lives – the differences that make us special, and the similarities that make us a community."
