        "text": "Telling LGBTQ+ stories – a process sometimes called ‘queering’ – is a key part of Manchester Museum’s LGBT+ History Month and Beyond programme. To mark and celebrate LGBT+ History Month, our Inflatable Museum Support Assistant, Mattie Davies (they/them), reflects on how museums can tell stories by and about lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer, and/or questioning people and communities.\n\nThe UK’s first LGBT+ History Month took place in February 2005, less than two years after Section 28 was repealed in England and Wales. Section 28 was a piece of legislation brought into place in 1988 which banned local authorities from “promoting homosexuality” or “teaching in any maintained school of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship”.\n\nI was in my final year of primary school when Section 28 was repealed, and until then it was illegal for me to learn about people like myself in school. Even afterwards, nothing materially changed for me. Had I encountered LGBT+ History Month when I was in school, it might have been a game changer. LGBT+ History Month aims to raise awareness of the LGBT+ community, celebrate its achievements, teach its history, and combat prejudice.\n\nThis February, Manchester Museum launched an LGBT+ History Month and Beyond programme including online talks and workshops, family events, and a special episode of the Manchester Museum Podcast, in which I sat down for a conversation with Dan Vo. Dan is a museum queerator (queer + curator), a patron of LGBT+ History Month, and the project manager for the Queer Heritage & Collections Network.\n\nUnlike other episodes of the Manchester Museum Podcast, it’s less me interviewing Dan and more of a conversation between the two of us. That’s partly because Dan is a fantastic interviewer himself – throughout the 2020 lockdown, Dan hosted an online talk show called #MuseumFromHome, mostly interviewing museum professionals. This is how Dan and I met, after he invited me first onto his takeover of the Queer Britain Twitter account, and second onto #MuseumFromHome.\n\nSo, how can museums tell LGBTQ+ stories? I think my answer can be broken down using three examples I give in the podcast.\n\n1. Empowerment – ‘Nothing about us without us’ is a campaign slogan that can be traced back to the disability rights movement, but it’s a slogan that rings true with all marginalised communities. Museums can only tell authentic LGBTQ+ stories by working with the communities they aim to represent and by empowering those communities to bring their authentic selves. My first real foray into combining my work in LGBTQ+ communities and my work at Manchester Museum was for LGBT+ History Month l\\ast year. In my role as a youth work coordinator at The Proud Trust (a life saving and life enhancing organisation that helps LGBT+ young people empower themselves, to make a positive change for themselves, and their communities) I started by bringing a couple youth groups to visit Manchester Museum. The visits built up to a takeover event, wherein our young people led activities from badge making to gallery tours, culminating in an open mic in which our young people read poetry, sang, danced, and performed music. It was a joyous event, and looking back after a year has passed, the reactions and reflections from the young people who attended still stands out for me as particularly memorable. As I say in the podcast, several young people shared how empowering it felt to present their authentic selves in the museum; I remember one young person in particular telling me how exciting it was to hear museum visitors correctly using neopronouns to refer to xem.\n\n2. Co-curation – Simply giving LGBTQ+ communities a seat at the table is not enough: museums need to relinquish power so that communities to tell their own stories – a practice known as ‘co-curation’. It’s also not enough to just celebrate LGBTQ+ stories with an event; these stories need to become fully embedded across the board – into the collections and exhibits that make up a museum and more. Every museum and every collection has LGBTQ+ stories to tell; whether they’re explicitly about LGBTQ+ people and history or they’re about the meanings the collections hold to LGBTQ+ people. For me, the Museum of Transology is the gold standard for co-curatorial approaches, holding the UK’s most significant collection of objects representing trans, non-binary and intersex people’s lives. I can’t fully do the collection justice here, so I really encourage you to take some time to explore the website for yourself: http://museumoftransology.com/. What it does, is to involve the trans, non-binary, and intersex community at every level of curation: communities are skilled-up in curation practices; they actually do the collecting; and they write their own labels to ensure that stories are told in their own words.\n\n3. Storytelling – A bit of a tautological answer, this one: How do we tell stories? With storytelling! Dan and I cover the power of storytelling and narrative in the podcast and, as much as I am a fan of cataloguing and archiving – putting things into neat boxes – I do honestly believe that storytelling is where museums hold the most power. The Bolton Museum Monologues – a series of five monologues created to coincide with Bolton Museum’s 2019 exhibition ‘Desire, Love, Identity: Exploring LGBTQ Histories in Bolton‘ – is a piece of work that really sticks with me.\n\nI was lucky enough to be invited to watch an evening performance of the Museum Monologues during LGBT+ History Month 2019 with The Proud Trust’s LGBT+ youth group in Bolton, Planet Rainbow and the young people who attended still fondly remember the experience and talk about its impact today – one young person has since told me that to be a queer historian is their dream job.\n\nSo why should we be queering Manchester Museum? Why should museums tell LGBTQ+ stories?"
