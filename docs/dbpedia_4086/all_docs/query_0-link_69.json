        "text": "From 1 April 2024, MDNW became part of the new MD North team. This blog will no longer be updated with information about the new programme.\n\nCheck out our fantastic new website\n\nThe new MD North website will be your go to place for news, events, grants, Accreditation – the whole works! You can also subscribe to our regular newsletter to keep up-to-date with all the opportunities from MD North.\n\nTake a peek now at: Museum Development North\n\nAbout MD North\n\nMD North is managed by a new partnership between York Museums Trust, the Manchester Museums Partnership, Cumbria Museum Consortium and Tyne & Wear Archives & Museums.\n\nThe MD North partnership is funded by ACE, with an award of £1.4m to deliver museum development activity in the north of England from 1st April 2024 until 31st March 2026. Our new partnership builds on the team’s experience of collaborative working across the north of England since 2018.\n\nOur support programme for museums in the north of England responds to Arts Council England’s Strategy, Let’s Create and addresses the four Investment Principles.\n\nThis is our final blog post before the MDNW team finish for Easter and, indeed, the final blog post of MDNW.\n\nFrom 1st April we become Museum Development North, merging with the current Museum Development Yorkshire and North East teams.\n\nFrom April we will be found at www.museumdevelopmentnorth.org.uk (we don’t expect anyone to be poring over the website on Easter Monday, we definitely won’t be!). The MDNW website at https://museumdevelopmentnorthwest.wordpress.com will stay up for a few more weeks but there won’t be any new content added to it.\n\nOur blog posts will be replaced with news on our website and a regular newsletter straight to your inbox if you have subscribed to MD North. Due to GDPR regulations we can’t take our list of subscribers to this blog over to the new website and newsletter so if you haven’t yet signed up to the new MD North newsletter and would like to do so, you can do that by clicking here – http://eepurl.com/iMx1pI [eepurl.com]\n\nSo, after 12 years of MDNW we have to get used to calling ourselves MD North. Throughout normal operations and the more crisis-induced times, we have tried to be a central point of focus and support, there for when you need us. And within the team we’ve had remarkable consistency; in 12 years there have been only 14 staff – original and new posts, maternity covers, secondments, apprentices and interns. Plus, only two external consultants as Accreditation Advisers.\n\nThat consistency should help make the new MD North programme look familiar to you – you will recognise the North West-based staff as well as meeting new staff; grant funding and development programmes will operate in a similar format to how they’ve been run across a sub-region.\n\nWe are saying goodbye at the end of this month to Bria Cotton, Programme Assistant, although Bria continues working at The Whitworth and is taking up a new role at Manchester Museum, and Baz Rashid, Museum Development Officer (Workforce & Skills) returns to his original post at Manchester Museum at the end of his secondment with us.\n\nCarrying on to MD North are:\n\nKaye Hardyman, Museum Development Officer covering Lancashire and Cumbria\n\nLynsey Jones, Museum Development Officer covering Cheshire, Merseyside and Greater Manchester\n\nAlison Criddle, Museum Development Officer (Environmental Responsibility)\n\nIt’s been a pleasure and a privilege to work with you all in the North West, and after Easter, we’ll see you all again as Museum Development North. But for now…\n\nCurator\n\nSalary: £29,777 – £33,024 plus benefits\n\nLocation: Wirral\n\nContract: Permanent\n\nWorking Pattern: Flexible Hours/Full Time\n\nHours: 36 hours per week.\n\nClosing Date: 19th April 2024 at 23:59\n\nInterview Date: 1st May 2024\n\nFrom Wirral Council:\n\nThere has never been a more exciting time to join Wirral Council.

Our vision is to secure the best possible future for our residents, defined by the community prosperity we create and supported by our excellent people and services. If you strive to #BeTheDifference and want to be at the heart of our change and improvement journey, then this could be the perfect job for you.\n\nCurator\n\nAbout the Role:\n\nWirral Museums is a vibrant service that cares for a diverse collection, across two sites on behalf of Wirral Borough Council and the people of the city region.\n\nWe bring stories alive through exhibitions, events, and activities across both of our venues. A passion for audience and community is at the heart of what we do. We are constantly striving to improve and encourage engagement with our growing audience.\n\nAbout the candidate:\n\nWe are seeking a Curator to lead and manage a team of talented staff. You will drive forward change and look at news ways to present our collection whilst developing audience and income sources.\n\nWorking alongside the Venue Manager, you will be responsible for the successful delivery of exhibitions, collections care and school’s service.\n\nWe would like to hear from you if you are experienced in line management and getting the best out of a team.

As an organisation we reach beyond the expected, push boundaries and strive to share knowledge. We aim to redefine what a museum can be. Would you like to be part of this?\n\nWe are looking for a Human History Curator with a passion for making the collections in their care as accessible as possible, so that our diverse communities can be inspired by the stories they tell. You will put audiences at the heart of everything we do, championing greater understanding, appreciation and engagement of the museum’s inspirational Human History collection. We want someone with the creativity, imagination and drive to celebrate archaeology and social history collections within our major capital development programme, Project Tullie which will transform the museum over the next decade.\n\nFrom butterflies to Pre-Raphaelites, treasure hoards to ticket machines, Tullie has a richly diverse and significant range of collections that includes Archaeology, Fine & Decorative Art, Social History and a Nationally Designated collection of Natural Sciences sitting at the heart of Carlisle’s unique heritage story. The Human History collection represents the breadth and diversity of Carlisle and Cumbria’s story: its role as one of the most important prehistoric trading posts in Britain, its internationally significant position on Hadrian’s Wall, the UNESCO World Heritage Site and the untold story of medieval Carlisle, the most besieged city in England. In more recent memory, the collection also records much of Carlisle’s social history from Border Reivers to its unique railway heritage, telling a story of Cumbria that spans ages and social classes.\n\nTullie House Museum & Art Gallery Trust is a major independent regional museum welcoming over 200,000 visitors every year. We are the lead organisation of the Cumbria Museum Consortium, an Arts Council England National Portfolio Organisation. Our Manifesto places collections at the heart of everything we do: we use them to inspire co-creation and active participation, celebrate diversity and champion equality, and foster a sense of pride in the people of Carlisle and Cumbria for their unique local history.\n\nThis is a unique opportunity to be part of a major programme of development for Tullie: Project Tullie is the Museum’s Futureplan for transforming the organisation into the creative and cultural heart of the region for the 21st century through a comprehensive redevelopment of the main Museum site. You will work with the Collections & Access Manager and the Curatorial team to develop dynamic and sector-leading gallery spaces that blend innovative storytelling, co-curation and interactivity into unique visitor experiences.\n\nPurpose of the Role\n\nTo curate and manage the Archaeology & Social History collections (which comprise the Human History Collection) to recognised professional standards, under the direction of the Collections and Access Manager, and to increase access to this collection for research, engagement, income generation and Project Tullie.\n\nTo work with colleagues across the organisation to develop innovative projects, exhibitions and events focusing on the Human History Collection in order to support the delivery of the museum’s Manifesto, Business Plan and Audience Development Plan objectives.\n\nTo manage national partnerships and engagement with interested parties associated with the Archaeology collection, including partners along the Hadrian’s Wall Corridor, UNESCO and the British Museum.\n\nSalary\n\n£29,300 – £31,004 per annum\n\nApplication Process\n\nIf you are inspired by the role and would like to apply for the position, please visit https://tullie.org.uk/get-involved/jobs/ and send your CV and a covering statement (of no more than 500 words), detailing any relevant experience and knowledge, and what interests you about this role to hr@tulliehouse.org by 12pm (midday) on Friday 19th April.\n\nCandidates invited to interview will be notified by 12pm on Tuesday 23rd April.\n\nInterviews will be held on Thursday 25th April – we strongly encourage candidates to attend in person, but a video option will be made available if this isn’t possible.\n\nWe are an equal opportunities employer and are fully committed to providing opportunities to all.

While we regularly hear from many of you through our smaller surveys on specific topics, this survey will provide us with the standardised, baseline data that we need to effectively advocate on behalf of archives to Government, national funders and other strategic bodies. Without up-to-date information about the several thousand archives across the country, we can’t make the strongest case possible to tackle the biggest challenges that we face as a sector.\n\nPlease note: if we have contacted your archive to take part in this year’s Local Authority Archive Benchmarking Exercise, please complete the benchmarking exercise instead.\n\nComplete the survey for your archive today [smartsurvey.co.uk]\n\nUpdate on Archives Revealed\n\nWith the award of our Scoping Grants in February 2024, the Archives Revealed funding programme is now finishing its current three-year cycle. The partnership is using the time between funding cycles to strategically evaluate the programme and explore expanding fundraising options. We will be publishing further information in June 2024 about the programme’s return and next funding rounds.\n\nARCHON codes\n\nAn ARCHON code is a unique identifier used for ISAD(G) compliant cataloguing which identifies entries in the Find An Archive Directory [discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk]. Find An Archive is an online database of contact and access details of archives within the UK and selected international archives. If you are an archivist or custodian of original materials (such as manuscripts, photographs, etc.) that relate to British history and if you can provide public access to them, you can apply for an ARCHON code. Once your archive receives an ARCHON entry and repository code, you can then add information about your holdings to our Discovery database and other UK archive networks.\n\nApply for an ARCHON code [nationalarchives.gov.uk]\n\nCalling all archives with Irish collections\n\nIn collaboration with our partners in the Virtual Record Treasury of Ireland [virtualtreasury.ie] research programme (VRTI), we’re hosting an event this September to bring together institutions from across Britain that hold Irish collections. The event will be an opportunity for archives to share knowledge of their collections and find out how they could contribute to the VRTI programme’s work to rebuild virtually the collections that were lost in the 1922 destruction of the Public Record Office of Ireland. We are seeking expressions of interest to attend this event and also proposals for short presentations on relevant collections.\n\nExpress your interest in the ‘Tracing Irish Records in British archives’ event [nationalarchives.gov.uk]\n\nSeeking feedback on our CMS and DAMS options\n\nWe are currently reviewing our website resources and are looking for feedback on our spreadsheet of Collections Management System (CMS) and Digital Asset Management System (DAMS) options for archives (found on our Cataloguing systems and archive networks [nationalarchives.gov.uk]webpage). We would like to hear from you if you’ve used the spreadsheet and found it useful or have any comments about the structure of the spreadsheet and how easy it is to use.\n\nPlease send any thoughts and feedback to us by Friday 12 April\n\nCall for nominations to serve on the ARA Board\n\nIf you’re an Archives & Records Association (ARA) member and are looking to use your skills and experience in a wider context and gain more knowledge of the sector at a strategic level, there is an opportunity to stand for election to the ARA Board. You will have the opportunity to have your say about how ARA can improve things in the sector.\n\nThe annual elections to the ARA Board take place at the Annual General Meeting (AGM). This year’s AGM is on 14 June 2024 and will be held online. The deadline for nominations is 14 April.\n\nLearn more about the call for nominations [archives.org.uk]\n\nGet your community archive on the map\n\nThe Community Archives and Heritage Group [communityarchives.org.uk] (CAHG) is a national group which aims to support and promote community archives in the UK & Ireland. It maintains a comprehensive listing of community archives, currently numbering over 750 archives, which are displayed on an interactive map [communityarchives.org.uk]. CAHG is running a project to increase the number and diversity of groups in the directory. Many groups don’t get round to creating an entry just because of time pressures, so for the next few months CAHG can help community archives create an entry [communityarchives.org.uk].\n\nNational eventsA guide to onboarding and mentoring an apprentice (online)\n\n26 March (10am – 12pm)\n\nThis workshop for employers will discuss onboarding and mentoring an apprentice, and explore what you need to do and consider throughout the process. We will explore what onboarding is and the five points of onboarding, who should be involved, and what your organisations already do. We will explore the importance and benefits of mentoring, how to support an apprentice and finding the right mentor. This session will be of interest to employers who are considering introducing an apprenticeship into their archive service but are not sure where to start and could benefit from further guidance.\n\nFind out more and register for the ‘guide to onboarding and mentoring an apprentice’ workshop[eventbrite.co.uk]\n\nMAPLE – new resources and support event (online)\n\n15 April (1pm – 1:40pm)\n\nThe Major Archive Projects Learning Exchange (MAPLE) was set up in 2007 to support organisations planning or managing large archive projects, primarily capital developments.
