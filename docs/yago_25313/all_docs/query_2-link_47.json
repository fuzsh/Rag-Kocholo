        "text": "Run For Your Wife (Salvese Quien Pueda!) and PS: Your Cat is Dead (PD: Tu Gato ha Muerto), two of Mexico City's most popular plays, celebrated 500 performances on the same evening, March 19.\n\nIt's a tradition in Mexico to celebrate each 100 performances of a show by inviting special guests to unveil a commemorative engraved plate that is later hanged at the foyer of the theatre. With this tradition, foyers of Mexico City's theatres are like museums with plates honoring all successful productions that have played at each theatre.\n\nThe guests at the 500th performance of Ray Cooney's Run For Your Wife! were Guillermo Ochoa, host of Televisa's news and entertaintment TV show \"Hoy Mismo\"; and Adal Ramones, host of another popular entertainment TV show called \"Otro Rollo\" which airs Saturdays at Televisa's channel 9.\n\nDirected by Rafael Perrin (Houdini: La Magia del Amor, The Woman in Black),Run stars Eugenio Derbez (Ninette y un Senor de Murcia, Me and My Girl), and is produced by Fela Fabregas. This hilarious comedy of misunderstandings and infidelities plays at the Teatro Mexico Thurs. at 8:30PM, Fri. and Sat at 7PM & 9:30PM and Sun. at 5:30PM and 8PM. For tickets call Ticketmaster Mexico at (52-5) 325 9000."
