        "text": "Mexican actress\n\nIn this Spanish name, the first or paternal surname is Vieth and the second or maternal family name is Paetau.\n\nMichelle Vieth (Spanish pronunciation: [miˈtʃel βjet]) is a Mexican actress and television personality known for her starring roles in Mexican telenovelas between the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nMichelle's mother and father met in Marshalltown, Iowa, United States. Her mother's family lived in Acapulco, Guerrero, Mexico at that time. Her father and his side of the family are from Marshalltown. For that reason, from a young age, Michelle was flying back and forth through both countries. At the age of 15 while in Acapulco, she was invited as an extra in the telenovelas \"El Premio Mayor\" produced by Emilio Larrosa, \"Acapulco, Cuerpo y Alma\" produced by Jose Alberto Castro and its English version produced by Carlos Sotomayor. But It was VP of Televisa and Producer Valentín Pimstein's last discovery for the company after discovering figures like Veronica Castro and Thalia. Pimstein saw something unique in Michelle so he took her to Mexico City and his team of specialists, who then decided that Michelle was going to be enrolled at the Centro de Educación Artistica (CEA) to study acting and modeling. Almost a year later, Pedro Damián, who was part of Valentin's team, called her and offered her to be Mi Pequeña Traviesa, marking her debut in television as an actress.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2004, she was on Big Brother Celebrity VIP2 Mexico, and exited the fourth week of the show, finishing in 11th place.\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nVieth was married to Hector Soberon from 2001 to 2004, and the marriage was later annulled. She was engaged but never married to Leandro Ampudia from 2004 to 2010, with whom she had a son, Leandro (born 2005), and a daughter, Michelle (born 2007). Since 2011, she's been in a long-term relationship with Christian Aparicio, and they have a son, Christian Aparicio, Jr. (born 2014), and a daughter, Selika (born 2016).[citation needed]\n\nMore than a decade ago, a private video of Vieth surfaced on the internet, a situation that she still considers heartbreaking and difficult to overcome. Vieth supports a citizen initiative that seeks the approval of the Vengeance Pornography Law, to prevent harassment through the network and the circulation of unauthorized sexual content of which she herself was a victim. After living it in her own flesh, Vieth contacted women's rights defender Matan Uziel from Real Women Real Stories, who helped her to tell her story.[1]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nTelenovelas, Series, Theater, TV Show Year Title Role Notes 1995-1996 Acapulco, cuerpo y alma Special appearance 1997-1998 Mi pequeña traviesa Julia Gonzalez/Julio Gonzalez Main role 1998-1999 Soñadoras Lucía de la Macorra Main role 1998 De Estos Locos Quedan Pocos Theatrical Performance 1998 Mi Preciosa Traviesa Theatrical Performance 1998 Festival Acapulco Herself/Presenter TV show 1999-2000 Mujeres engañadas Paola Montero Main role 2001 Amigas y Rivales Laura González Main role 2002-2003 Clase 406 Nadia Castillo Bojorquez Recurring role 2003 Mujer, casos de la vida real TV series 2003 Un Big Enredo Theatrical Performance 2004 Copa América Herself/Presenter TV special Program 2005 La Madrastra Viviana Sousa de San Román Main cast 2006-07 Mundo de Fieras Karen Farias Rivas del Castillo Main cast 2006 Emisiones del teleton Herself/Presenter TV show 2006 Big Brother VIP 2 Herself Reality Show-Finished 11th Place 2007-08 Al Diablo con los Guapos Pilar Guest star 2008 La traición Michelle Phillips Recurring role 2008-09 Cuidado con el Angel Ana Julia Villaseñor Recurring role 2012-13 La Otra Cara del Alma Daniela de la Vega Quijano/Daniela Aldama de la Vega Main role 2013 La Isla, el reality Herself Reality Show-Finished 18th Place 2013 Mexico Baila Herself Reality Show 2021-22 Mi fortuna es amarte Fernanda Diez Acuña Main cast 2023 Bola de locos Herself Episode: \"Amigos y rivales\"\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Award Category Telenovela Result 1998 TVyNovelas Awards Best Female Revelation Mi Pequeña Traviesa Nominated 1999 Debut of the Year Won 2004 Premios Bravo Best Actress in Television Won\n\nOther awards\n\nRecognition by Career from Government of Acapulco in 2006\n\nRecognition for Lifetime Achievement from Programa Mueveteb in 2006\n\nRecognition by the Ministry of Tourism Acapulco and the Trust for Tourism Promotion of Acapulco in 2009\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
