        "text": "soap opera actress Michelle Viethannounced in an interview for the “Hoy” program, that will sue her ex-husband, actor Héctor Soberón, for allegedly leaking his intimate video more than a decade ago, pointing out that their sexual human rights were violated and that when this situation occurred, the internet was not legislated. “It is a video that Héctor and I recorded in our house in Puerto Vallarta and that is cut with all the desire to do harm, I did not expose it, I did not bring it to light, I did not betray our privacy.”\n\nHow did Héctor Soberón react to the lawsuit filed by Michelle Vieth? In an interview for “Ventaneando”, the soap opera actor He expressed that this topic already has him fed upasking the protagonist of the telenovela “My little naughty”, that he already overcomes it and has a little dignity towards his children and his current sentimental partner.\n\nWe recommend you read:\n\n“This subject has tired me, every four years, look how funny, bring out something new, I don’t know what you want, get over me, right? Turn the page, you have children, have a little dignity towards your children, towards your family, towards your partner, be silent. Stop it, stop it, because mija, you have a demand, what better check, check your things well “.\n\nHector Soberon stated that he had lost 20 years of his life, after the scandal of the intimate video of Michelle Vieth, because After being identified as the person responsible for having leaked it, he received many attacks and work doors were closed to him. “If I spoke at this moment, what would I gain? The 20 years of attacks would return to me, the 20 years of accusations would return to me, 20 years of knocking on doors and having them closed, 20 years of threats.”\n\nWe recommend you read:\n\nLikewise, the actor said that when he met his ex-wife, she was 18 years old and when the video came to light, she was 20.\n\nOn the other hand, in the interview for the morning newspaper “Hoy”, the also star of “Soñadoras” and “My little naughty”, mentioned having been the first actress in Mexico to experience a case like this“which was the revenge pornography, which today in the United States is known as ‘revenge porn law’, the law that protects this type of event, yes, I would also like to be the last one”.\n\nGraduated from the Universidad de Occidente in 2010 with a degree in Communication Sciences, passionate about human journalism.
