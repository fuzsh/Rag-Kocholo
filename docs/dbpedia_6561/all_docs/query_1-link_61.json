        "text": "Ponytails and mullets, made famous by sportsmen and rock stars in the 1980s, are set to be banned in Iran as part of a crackdown on 'Western' haircuts.\n\nA private organisation devoted to Islamic fashion has issued a new list of culturally appropriate haircuts for men, the first such hair catalogue since 1979 Islamic revolution.\n\nThe country's culture ministry has reportedly backed the list, which includes pictures of models with short hair, both curly and straight, and some with gel in their locks.\n\nSeveral have elements of style, including long sideburns and in one case a quiff reminiscent of a 1960s Elvis Presley - but there is no long hair included in the images.\n\nMany young Iranian men wear Western hairstyles, including pony tails, inspired by Hollywood movie stars.\n\nBut several barber shops have reportedly been shut down and penalised in recent years for offering \"decadent cuts\".\n\nJaleh Khodayar is in charge of a Modesty and Veil Festival taking place later this month where the new styles are to be promoted.\n\nShe said they are aimed at confronting the \"Western cultural invasion\", by pushing cuts based on the \"law and culture\" of the Iranian society.\n\nShe added: \"The proposed styles are inspired by Iranians' complexion, culture and religion, and Islamic law.\"\n\nMs Khodayar went on: \"We are happy that the Islamic Republic of Iran's government has backed us in designing these hairstyles.\"\n\nShe said female hairstyles will be introduced in future and the styles would be featured in foreign exhibitions in the hope of spreading them to other Muslim countries.\n\nWomen in Iran must cover their hair in public to comply with Sharia law.\n\nSince Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was first elected president in 2005, annual summer crackdowns on immodest appearance have intensified.\n\nFemales who reveal strands of hair are at risk of being stopped in the streets for failing to respect the dress code."
