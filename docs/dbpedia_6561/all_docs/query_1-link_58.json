Traje refers to the customary clothing of the 28 existing Mayan language groups strewn across Mexico, Guatemala and Belize.

Almost an alchemist's dream come true! But the police do not always find these strange vehicles so funny.\n\nDirector: Boris Mitic\n\nProducer: Boris Mitic, Dribbling Pictures, Serbia\n\nTop | Program\n\nCARDBOARD DAYS\n\n51 minutes\n\n2003\n\nFilmed in Argentina\n\nThe film casts disturbing light on the biggest economic and social crisis in Argentina's history and the ways it impacts on broad sectors of the population. It focuses on the lives and labour of the so-called cartoneros, who scavenge the streets and rubbish tips of the richer districts of Buenos Aires in search of cardboard, to sell for a pittance. Cardboard Days also serves as a reflection on the remorseless Megalopolis, recycling, alternative lifestyles and economic inequity.\n\nDirector: Verónica Souto\n\nProducer: Justo Daract, Argentina\n\nTop | Program\n\nVENEZUELA BOLIVARIANA\n\n76 minutes\n\n2004\n\nFilmed in Venezuela\n\nThe film examines the Bolivarian revolution of Venezuela from the Caracazo riots of 1989 to the massive actions that brought revolutionary president Hugo Chávez back to power, 48 hours after a US-led military coup in 2002.

The film focuses on how the Bolivarian revolution transcends the national frontiers of Venezuela and contributes to the fight against neoliberal capitalism.\n\nDirector: Marcelo Andrade Arreaza\n\nProducer: Jose Lino Andrade, Calle y Media, Venezuela, Mexico and USA\n\nTop | Program\n\nTHE TAKE\n\n87 minutes\n\n2004\n\nFilmed in Argentina\n\nIn suburban Buenos Aires, Argentina, thirty unemployed auto-parts workers walk into their idle factory, roll out sleeping mats and refuse to leave. All they want is to re-start the silent machines. But this simple act -The Take - has the power to turn the globalisation debate on its head. What shines through in the film is the workers' demand for dignity and the searing injustice of dignity denied.\n\nDirector: Avi Lewis\n\nProducer: Naomi Klein, Klein Lewis Productions, Canada\n\nTop | Program"
