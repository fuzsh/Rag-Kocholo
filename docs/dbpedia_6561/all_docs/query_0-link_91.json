        "text": "Paris is a metropolitan city with its urban characteristics that have been shaped by its artistic monuments and history. There was a wave of immigration by white Americans to Paris at the beginning of the twentieth century. This wave of immigrants included several artists, journalists, and writers, who were disillusioned by the promises of the New World, America. These were as Gertrude Stein's described created a 'lost generation' in Europe. At the second half of the twentieth century, there appeared another wave of immigration to Europe, this time mainly by African-Americans. Their experiences and conditions differed from that of white pioneers. They were more liberal and stood for freedom rather than getting lost in Paris. Their previous situation in America was one of restlessness; they had to run away from hatred levelled against their skin colour or sexuality. They pointed to social problems back in America and pronounced the freedom of speech they earned Paris. This article aims to explore the extent to which the African-American literary experience of Paris after World War II differed from that of white American writers earlier in the century. The paper critically compares the selected fiction by accomplished authors such as Ernest Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises (1926), F. Scott Fitzgerald's 'Babylon Revisited' (1931), Richard Wright's The Outsider (1953) and James Baldwin's Giovanni's Room (1956). This article concludes that the two literary experience that were shaped in Paris vigorously differed in their motives and motivations in reflecting the expectations of exile, the experience of sexuality and the treatment of women.\n\nAt the same time that Breton, Joyce and Faulkner were redefining the symbolic centres of modernism in the interwar period, another diverse group of writers and artists was exploring metropolitan cultural centres as a means for exploring the aesthetics and ethics of cultural and sexual difference. As the next chapter discusses, many European writers, including Franz Kafka and Federico Garcia Lorca, were attracted to mythologising America (and especially New York) as a site of creative possibility. Conversely, another major transatlantic trend was for American writers to embark on the ‘dangerous pilgrimage’ (as Malcolm Bradbury calls it) of leaving their homeland, either permanently in the case of Gertrude Stein or temporarily for Ernest Hemingway and Henry Miller, as a rejection of what they deemed to be the worst excesses of American Progressivism.1 Unlike many Europeans burdened by the geographical proximity of war, for these American writers and others, such as Ezra Pound, Anais N...\n\nNew York City, and by extension the US, were the focus of great attention by Spanish travel writers at the beginning of the twentieth century, and one of the recurrent themes of their works was the presence of African Americans in this city. In tune with similar discourses both in America and Europe and influenced by racialist ideology, blacks were often portrayed as a ‘problem’ by these writers, whereas at the same time they exerted on them a fascination catalysed by the combination of ‘primitivism’ and modernity encapsulated in jazz music (Miranda-Barreiro 2013 & 2014). The interest in this city did not fade away in the decades following the Spanish Civil War and still remains strong today, producing a wealth of literary texts in different genres (travel writing, novel, short stories, poetry). In travel books, references to African Americans reflect how views on black people have evolved in Spanish society in the twentieth and twenty first centuries. In the 1940s, the so-called ‘black problem’ is still present in travelogues such as Joaquín Calvo Sotelo’s Nueva York en retales (1946). Other travel books provide a more positive account, as in Agustín del Saz’s Nueva York (1947), Diego Hidalgo’s Nueva York. Impresiones de un español que no sabe inglés (1949) and José Blanco Amor’s Reportaje a Nueva York (1950). Racial stereotypes related to the alleged primitivism of blacks persist in some of these texts, and often become present in the description of jazz music and jazz clubs. The racialism prevalent in the West before World War II is however less pronounced in this period, and it takes the shape of class discrimination, as the emphasis is often placed on African American’s assumed suitability for low paid jobs. By taking the aforementioned texts as case studies and using postcolonial studies as a theoretical framework, this chapter sets out to examine the evolution of the views that Spanish travel writers have had on African Americans during the Francoist dictatorship.\n\nThis essay expands the critical conversation on race, labor, and literature in the Panama Canal Zone by foregrounding the portrayal of white, U.S. workers in two popular texts, Harry A. Franck’s Zone Policeman (1913) and John Hall’s Panama Roughneck Ballads (1912). While existing scholarship has detailed the legal and economic policies that shaped the United States’ racialized form of labor management, the “gold and silver system,” in the Zone, it has largely ignored the literary discourse that emerged in response to the system’s incongruous values. This essay argues that literary depictions of white, American canal workers as hyper-masculine and hyper-productive “Panama roughnecks” rhetorically rationalized the gold and silver system’s privileging of white, US workers, while also producing narratives that destabilized its hierarchies of race, nationality, and skill set. These narratives also engendered new forms of identification that evaded or reimagined normative American understandings of race, genealogy, and national affiliation."
