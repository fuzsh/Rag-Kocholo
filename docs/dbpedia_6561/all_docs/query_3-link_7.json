The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:10 a.m. in room 2172, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Howard L. Berman (chairman of the committee) presiding. Chairman Berman. The committee will come to order. I believe the ranking member will be joining us in just a moment. But before I begin my opening statement, I want to make mention several procedural issues. In the context of all of our hearings, we request that the audience members do not hold up or wave signs, make gestures to attract attention, stand up and protest, stand up and shout or yell your views, or otherwise disrupt the hearing. And we will ask the Capitol Police to remove anyone from the room who violates this policy. It is the policy of the Capitol Police to arrest anyone ejected from a hearing room. After the ranking member and I make our opening remarks, the chairman and ranking member of the Middle East and South Asia Subcommittee will have an opportunity to make 3-minute statements. I would strongly encourage other members to submit their statements for the record or make any comments they may have during their time for questioning, which will be extended for this hearing only. Because we have such a large panel, I would ask all the witnesses to summarize their statements in 5-7 minutes. Your entire written statements will be made a part of the record. Finally, the ranking member and I have agreed that all members will be given 7 minutes to question the witnesses. This means that both the questions and answers must be completed within 7 minutes, and we will enforce that time limit strictly. It is not the intention of the chair to break for lunch. We are going to plow right through until we are done and now I will yield myself time for the opening statement. No, I am not bringing food, either. On June 12th, Iranians went to the polls in what was expected to be a close Presidential election. But instead of a down-to-the-wire contest, the Iranian Government almost immediately declared that the incumbent had been reelected in a landslide. This hearing takes place in the wake of 6 weeks of post-election turmoil and uncertainty, the most significant internal upheaval since the 1979 revolution. Hundreds of thousands of courageous Iranians have taken to the street in defiance of the regime to protest the election results. The regime responded brutally to these peaceful demonstrators. By the government's own admission, at least 20 protestors were killed and some 500 are in prison awaiting trial. Most human rights groups say the actual numbers are much higher, with some putting the number killed well into the hundreds. Iran also barred its domestic and foreign press from covering the demonstration; shut down cell-phone coverage and the Internet for long periods of time to limit communication among the dissidents; arrested foreign journalists; and, in total disregard of international law, broke into the British Embassy to arrest local hires. The people of Iran should know that the over 1 million Iranians living in America and hundreds of millions of other Americans stand in awe of their courage to stand up for free election. Have no doubt, the American people stand with you. Post-June 12 events in Iran raise many questions. Has the regime, as many have said, now lost much, if not all, of its legitimacy? Is the clerical elite now irrevocably divided? Has the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps become the dominant force in the country? If so, what are the implications of these developments? Should we expect further turmoil? Is the regime's survival in question? And, most important, what are the implications for United States and international efforts to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapons capability? The facts on the ground are deeply disturbing. Iran has made significant progress on its nuclear program, far exceeding expectations of the recent past. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, Iran has now installed more than 7,000 centrifuges, and has produced enough low-enriched uranium to fuel a nuclear explosive device, were that low-enriched uranium to be transformed into highly-enriched uranium. And some would point out that this describes only Iran's overt programs; in many quarters, the suspicion lurks that Iran also has a covert program that is even further along. The nuclear issue is urgent and it is of such overriding importance to America's national security--and to regional stability--that we can't afford to drop the ball. Whatever our feelings about the authoritarian regime in Tehran, that regime continues to hold the reins of power, and for now, I believe President Obama is correct in continuing to pursue a policy of engagement. Why? Because our previous policy of seeking to isolate the regime simply did not work. Nothing we have done has slowed Iran's drive to acquire a nuclear weapons capability. And only by making a good-faith effort to engage Iran can we build the support we need from the international community to impose the crippling sanctions necessary should engagement fail. But while it is important to pursue engagement, it is also critical that these efforts be time-limited and that the administration be prepared to try a different approach if Iran is not cooperating. As I understand it, that is exactly the administration's policy. The President recently said that Iran's willingness to engage will be reevaluated in early fall after the September 24-25 G-20 meeting in Pittsburgh. He has also said that ``[w]e're not going to create a situation in which talks become an excuse for inaction while Iran proceeds'' on its nuclear efforts. In short, if I can paraphrase the President, we should not allow Iran to run out the clock. I agree with the President's timetable. If by autumn the Iranians are not responsive to United States efforts to engage them, it likely will be time to move on, hopefully in close coordination with our allies in other key countries. That is also my approach regarding H.R. 2194, the Iran Refined Petroleum Sanctions Act, which I introduced with the ranking member in April, and which is now co-sponsored by well over half the Members of the House. My bill would impose sanctions on companies that are involved in exporting refined petroleum products to Iran or in helping Iran to increase or maintain its existing domestic refining capacity. This legislation would force companies in the energy sector to choose between doing business with Iran or doing business with the United States. The Iranian economy is heavily dependent on imports of refined petroleum, so this legislation--if it becomes law--would significantly increase economic pressure on Iran and hopefully persuade the regime to change its current course. When I introduced H.R. 2194, I said that I did not intend to immediately move it through the legislative process. I wanted--and still want--to give the administration's efforts to engage Iran every possible chance to succeed, within a reasonable time frame. I view the bill as a ``sword of Damocles'' over the Iranians--a clear hint of what will happen if they do not engage seriously and move rapidly to suspend their uranium enrichment program, as required by numerous U.N. Security Council resolutions. If engagement doesn't work, then I am prepared to mark up the bill in committee early this fall. Thus far, Iran has not been responsive--not on the bilateral front, and not even on the multilateral front. Last month, Iran cancelled its attendance at the G-8 Ministerial in Trieste, Italy. It has refused to set a date for the next P5+1 meeting. It is now late July--close enough to the administration's time-limit, and to my own, that Iran should be able to hear the clock ticking. I am now pleased to turn to my ranking member, the gentlelady from Florida, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen for any opening remarks she might want to make. Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for holding this hearing on Iranian internal political and economic developments and the implication for United States policy. We have an impressive group of witnesses, and I look forward to receiving their input. Mr. Chairman, I had hoped, however, that since this is the first full committee hearing on Iran we have held this year, and in light of your statement during the June 10th floor debate on the Foreign Relations Authorization Bill, that the committee would have hearings in July on how multilateral sanctions and the engagement process, the diplomatic process, has worked, that we would have heard from administration witnesses, and I hope that that will happen. I respectfully request a follow-up hearing with senior administration officials on this topic. As I mentioned in the hearing earlier this month on the proposed U.S.-UAE Civil Nuclear Cooperation Agreement, I am an equal opportunity worrier. Last July, in a hearing before this committee, I criticized the Bush administration's endorsement of an expanded incentive package under the P5+1, stating it granted undue legitimacy and leverage to the regime in Tehran, and the only thing we have to show for this approach is that Iran is now 2 years closer to nuclear capabilities. And my remarks, sadly, are as true today as they were then. Just in the 7 years since Iran's illegal nuclear program was uncovered, the United States position has gone from imitating the successful Libya model and calling for a complete, permanent, verifiable dismantlement of Iran's nuclear program; to calling for the cessation of enrichment reprocessing to temporary suspension, to the current United States position, whereby the U.S. has accepted a so-called Iranian civilian nuclear program, is pursuing direct engagement with the Iranian regime, and is now engaged in a proliferation of nuclear cooperation agreements with other countries in the Middle East. Secretary Clinton stated earlier today that the U.S. would upgrade the defense capabilities of, and extend a defense umbrella over, United States allies in the Persian Gulf. This was met with much concern and skepticism in Israel, where Dan Meridor, the Minister of Intelligence and Atomic Energy, told Army Radio, ``I was not thrilled to hear this American statement that they will protect their allies with a nuclear umbrella, as if they have already come to terms with a nuclear Iran.'' I would ask our witnesses today for their views on this U.S. approach, whether it signals an acceptance by the United States of a nuclear Iran, and how this impacts sanctions efforts and other efforts. Please comment. Turning to recent developments inside Iran and how these could affect the regimes' and our strategic calculations, the so-called supreme leader must now resort to manipulating elections and using force against unarmed demonstrators to preserve the regime's hold on power. Regime authorities have detained independent-minded individuals, repressed organizations under the guise of protecting the regime against what it labels as internal enemies, saboteurs, even revolutionaries. A process that has gone largely unnoticed outside of Iran is the rise of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps or IRGC. The rule of the mullahs has been significantly replaced by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, a quasi-military organization which has become the predominant power in that country. The IRGC controls large swaths of the economy and society. It uses its police and military forces to ensure obedience. It even has a dominant role in Iran's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile capabilities. And it is only in this context that we can fully understand what is now taking place in Iran following the sham elections of June 12. In addition to providing us their analysis of Iran's internal developments, I would appreciate it if our witnesses would address how these are affecting the regime's influence outside of the country and how we can capitalize on any political and economic vulnerabilities. For decades, Iran has spread unrest around the world, directly and through its proxies, such as Hamas and Hezbollah. Tehran has also facilitated attacks on United States forces in Iraq and in Afghanistan. The regime continues to pursue long- range missiles and seeks to enhance its chemical and biological weapons capabilities. The most salient issue is Iran's nuclear weapons program. Admiral Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, recently said, ``The clock has continued to tick on Iran's development of nuclear capabilities, and our time to stop them is running out.'' Ahmadinejad has declared many times that negotiations regarding Iran's nuclear program are dead. He reiterated that position on May 25th of this year and again last month. It is time for our policy to be based on facts and not on hope. It is long past time that we apply a badly needed sense of urgency to our policy toward the Iranian regime. It is time for us to fully realize that a regime that tortures, oppresses, and violently suppresses dissent, that only has disdain for its people, is not a regime that the U.S. should be legitimizing. I look forward to receiving the testimony of our witnesses today, listening to your recommendations on what the United States can do to support the people of Iran while undermining the ability of the regime to threaten its people, the region, and global peace and security. Thank you, as always, Mr. Chairman, for this hearing and the ability to ask great questions to our wonderful witnesses. Thank you. Chairman Berman. Thank you. And I am very pleased to recognize the chairman of the Middle East and South Asia Subcommittee, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Ackerman. Mr. Ackerman. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I don't think it is a secret that I have been a very active advocate of sanctions in Iran. For many years, I have thought it essential to force Iran to pay a price, some price, any price, for its regional subversion, its state sponsorship of terrorism and, most of all, its nuclear proliferation. In this last regard, however, I feel it may already be too late for sanctions. In April of last year, I warned that our thinking about the Iranian nuclear problem needed to change. I suggested then that ``Options that years ago would have seemed reckless have now become essential leverage if we are going to be successful in peacefully getting Iran to back down. With Iranian proliferation on the horizon, what is feckless is in fact reckless.'' That is what I said a year ago. As have many others, I supported the administration's efforts to engage Iran. In my travels through the Middle East and here in Washington, I have asked Israelis and numerous Arab leaders if they supported the President's approach to engage Iran. Every single intelligence chief, Minister, King, Prince, President, head of state, responded exactly the same way; America's engagement is long overdue and absolutely essential. And then when I ask them if they thought it would work, to a man, they said, absolutely not. I don't think they are wrong either. Recent events in Iran are instructive. But confronted by a challenge, Iran's rule is responded like any other pack of thugs with regime-sponsored violence and other disregard for human life. And it should be noted, the concerns and views of the rest of the world matter to them not in the slightest. In short, with their backs against the wall, Iran's rulers didn't care who or how many got hurt. Unfortunately, these events don't bode well for the administration's effort; whether or not bilateral discussions are going on right now or not, I don't know. But either way, I, frankly, have little hope that Iran's rulers will give up their nuclear ambitions in any case. What we have seen of late strongly suggests that Iran's rulers would gladly break the country in half in order to preserve their grip on power, and even given what has happened in Iraq and what has not happened in North Korea, I suspect Iran's thugocracy sees nuclear arms as their ultimate insurance policy. All of this is to say that we need to start thinking again, not just about sanctions and not just about what constitutes so-called crippling sanctions, but whether there is any level of economic sanctions sufficient to compel a change in Iran's nuclear program. And as we consider this question vis-a-vis Iran, I would suggest we think seriously about the decade of truly comprehensive sanctions on Iraq, which ultimately failed to resolve concerns about weapons of mass destruction that didn't even exist. Does anyone think that the Ayatollah Khomeini is a nicer guy than Saddam Hussein? This is reality; Iran is marching swiftly toward either a bomb or either a latent nuclear capability. This development is deeply destabilizing in an already deeply unstable region. Successful proliferation by Iran will most likely destroy the NPT and the international law against norm against nuclear proliferation. If left unaddressed by the United States and the rest of the international community, as seems to be the case right now, Israel will have to either live under Iranian nuclear sword or act preemptively themselves. In April of last year, I concluded by saying, I am not calling for another war; I want to prevent one. But we may have to go right up to the brink to be considered serious and credible---- Chairman Berman. The time for the gentleman has expired. Mr. Ackerman. To make nuclear weapons unacceptable. Chairman Berman. The gentleman from Indiana, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia, Mr. Burton, is recognized for 3 minutes. Mr. Burton. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I have been one of your strong supporters of 2194, and I can't for the life of me figure out why we are waiting month after month to bring that bill to the floor. It has 260 co-sponsors. Everybody understands the threat that Iran opposes, and we are sitting here talking. They have been developing a nuclear weapons program, as I understand it from staff, for almost two decades. They haven't made any allusions about stopping or creating any illusions about stopping that nuclear program. They are not going to stop. And unless we start imposing sanctions, real sanctions right now, like your bill would do, give the President the authority, we are giving him the authority to do it; let's do it. I mean, he has tried to reach out to them. He has said that he is willing to talk and all that other stuff. It ain't working, and it is not going to work. They have, as you just said, 7,000 centrifuges right now. They are developing a nuclear capability. And I know B.B. Netanyahu. And I know that he is a man that doesn't want to have a conflict over there. But I don't believe he or the Government of Israel is going to sit back if they have intelligence information and wait for them to complete a nuclear weapons program or a delivery system. We are messing around by waiting and not imposing sanctions today. Every day that we wait, we are risking a major conflict over there. Now, from the United States' standpoint, we are getting what 30, 35 percent of our energy from that part of the world right now. We don't need a conflagration that might involve nuclear weaponry. I mean, it would be horrible. And so, you know, the people over there, obviously, the people over there are good people. They like America for the most part, the people over there. It is not the people; it is the government. And we need to start putting pressure on that government post haste, and we haven't been doing it. If we start putting the hammer to them, if we give the President the authority and he starts getting our allies to stop them from getting refined oil back in their country, that will put extreme pressure on that government, because the people over there are already upset because of these elections. And there is a very good chance that the people of Iran would make some move to overthrow that government and bring in a real democratic government that they could live with. But for us to keep--I mean, I don't know how many hearings I have been to. I have been on this committee now for 27 years. I don't know how many hearings I have been to where we were talking about how we can work with Iran or how we want to work with Iran; we want to open up a dialogue. It isn't going to work. The one thing about North Korea, you know they are going to lie. Iran doesn't have to lie. They keep telling us they are not going to pay any attention to us, and they go right ahead. We need to impose sanctions now, not later. Chairman Berman. The time of the gentleman has expired. We have an excellent group of witnesses, some focused on the economic issues and some focused on the political issues in terms of the issues raised up until now and in Iran. I am going to introduce them in the order that they will be asked to testify. First is a familiar face to this committee, Patrick Clawson, deputy director of research at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. He previously spent 5 years at the National Defense University's Institute for National Strategic Studies, and 4 years at the IMF, the World Bank and the Foreign Policy Research Institute. He is the author or editor of over 25 books, including, ``The Last Resort: Consequences of Preventa deg.tive Military Action against Iran,'' published in 2008. And he has interesting ideas about how to take credit for the sun rising in the east. Abbas Milani is the co-director of the Iran Democracy Project at the Hoover Institution. He is also the Hamid and Christina Moghadam director of Iranian studies at the Stanford University. He has previously taught at the University of California at Berkley. Michael Rubin is resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and a senior lecturer at the Naval Post- Graduate School's Center for Civil Relations. He previously served as the editor of Middle East Quarterly and is a staff advisor on Iran and Iraq at the U.S. Department of Defense. He is the author of numerous books, including the forthcoming, ``Talking to the Enemy: The Promise and Perils of Engagement.'' Suzanne Maloney is a senior fellow at the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution. She previously served on the State Department Policy Planning Staff, and as director of the 2004 Council on Foreign Relations Task Force on U.S. Policy towards deg. Iran. She has published widely on Iran and her forthcoming book from Cambridge University Press will analyze Iran's political economy. Karim Sadjadpour is an associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. He was previously the chief Iran analyst at the International Crisis Group. He is a frequent media contributor for organizations such as the BBC, CNN, and the New York Times. He has lectured at Harvard, Princeton and Stanford Universities. Orde Kittrie is a professor of law at Arizona State University and a visiting scholar at the John Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. He is also a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, where he co- directs the Iran Energy Project. He previously served 11 years in the State Department where he worked on trade and nuclear issues. This is our excellent panel. And Patrick, why don't you start it off? STATEMENT OF PATRICK CLAWSON, PH.D., DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR RESEARCH, THE WASHINGTON INSTITUTE FOR NEAR EAST POLICY Mr. Clawson. Mr. Chairman, honorable members, thank you for the privilege of permitting me to testify today. I have prepared a statement that I would like to submit for the record. Chairman Berman. All statements will be included in the record. Mr. Clawson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me put on my economist hat to address the state of Iran's economy and its vulnerability to foreign economic pressure. First a word about Iran's overall economic situation. There is no country in the Middle East that has suffered more from the oil curse than Iran. Iran had spectacular economic growth when its oil income was modest. Indeed that oil revenue fueled the growth. But after the 1973 oil price rises, Iran became addicted to oil while the rest of the economy suffered. That was true under the Shah and has gotten worse under the Islamic Republic. For years, the different political factions in Iran have all agreed that the economy was in bad shape and that drastic steps were needed, but no one has been willing to tackle the entrenched interests, and so, therefore, the country's economy has suffered. The problem with the oil curse has been on full display in the last decade. Since 2000, oil prices have been on the rise. From 2000 to 2003, the average price was 50 percent higher than it had been in the 1990s. And from 2004 to 2008, things got even better for Tehran; each year the oil price rose 30 percent. With this windfall, Iran's economy has grown at 6 percent a year on average, which is faster than that of the United States or other industrial countries. However, it is a lot slower than the double-digit growth which should have been possible with this windfall. And Iranians have been profoundly unhappy about their country's economic performance because they realize what a missed opportunity the last few years have been. The oil windfall has been misused by President Ahmadinejad. He has taken that money and used it to engage in populous policies designed to secure short-term popularity at the expense of long-term growth. The budget for grants and subsidies went from $11 billion when Ahmadinejad took office to $25 billion this year. An equivalent increase in the United States would be if we spent an extra $550 billion a year on grants and subsidies. And that is just the explicit subsidies in the budget. There is also an implicit subsidy which comes from pricing oil and natural gas well below world market rates. The former central bank governor of Iran estimates those implicit subsidies at $45 billion a year; while the IMF estimates them at $85 billion a year. Even at the lower figure, the equivalent for the United States would be a $2.1 trillion subsidy. While this oil windfall has been largely wasted, it has had a substantial foreign policy impact. The additional oil income swamped the impact of increased foreign economic pressure. Iran could easily afford the higher price on its imports that came because of our sanctions operations. After all, Iran's imports tripled in the last 5 years. Given such a spectacular increase in the availability of foreign goods, it was hard to make the case that foreign sanctions were holding back growth. In short, the last few years have been a particularly difficult time for foreign economic pressure to have much impact on Iran. But the prospect for the next few years is entirely different. Oil revenues are declining instead of rising, and that is going to pose serious problems for Iran funding its imports and paying for its government budget. If oil prices stay at their current level, Iran's export earnings will be down $20 billion from last year. Now, at first, Iran could use its ample foreign exchange reserves to make up for the shortfall, but those reserves are going to run out, certainly within 3 years, and if oil prices fall, they will run out even faster. Then there is the government budget problem. The government spending has been increasing at a brisk pace under Ahmadinejad. At present oil prices, Iran will run a considerable budget deficit. And furthermore, Iran is not in a position to finance that deficit by borrowing from domestic banks because Ahmadinejad has ordered the banks to lend money for politically-favored but uneconomical projects. So the banks are in poor shape. In sum, the current situation in which Iran's economy is likely to do poorly in the next few years is a perfect moment for the international community to impose additional sanctions on Iran. No longer can Iran afford to offset the impact of those sanctions with a flood of higher oil income. On the contrary, the sanctions will come at a time of looming economic hardship, and there is excellent reason to expect that Iranian public opinion will blame the economic problems on the hardliners' isolation of Iran from the international community. In other words, we are in the position of being able to take credit for that which is going to happen anyway. And in politics, if you can get credit for making the sun rise in the East, take it. Foreign pressure will not cause Iran's economy to collapse, nor should that be our goal. But such pressure may well be able to contribute to what is becoming an intense debate inside Iran about the wisdom of a confrontational and isolationist policy toward the international community. That debate offers the best prospect for a fruitful resolution of a nuclear impasse, because those who want Iran to join the world are not willing to pay a high price for a nuclear program which they increasingly see as part of the Ahmadinejad agenda, not as part of a national project. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Mr. Clawson follows:]Patrick Clawson deg. Chairman Berman. Thank you very much, Dr. Clawson. And now, Dr. Milani. STATEMENT OF ABBAS MILANI, PH.D., CO-DIRECTOR, IRAN DEMOCRACY PROJECT, HOOVER INSTITUTION, DIRECTOR, IRANIAN STUDIES, STANFORD UNIVERSITY Mr. Milani. Good morning, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to the ranking member and the rest of the committee. Let me begin by saying that the last time I talked to this committee, Congressman Lantos held the gavel, and he embodied for me in his life and vision the best of America as the City on the Hill. I am humbled by his memory and would like to remind us of his service. I, too, have prepared a statement that I would like to submit to you, but I will try to make my presentation as much a direct answer to some of your questions as a summary of the statement, if I may. I think Iran is in a purgatory today. I think it is in a state of flux unlike anything that it has experienced in its 30 years. I can say with some certainty that I think it is the most serious crisis this regime has faced, the most serious political crisis this regime has faced. The problem is that neither of the two sides that are now facing off seem to have the power to dislodge the other or control the other. We are in what political scientists call a condition ripe for the rise of a kind of a Napoleon. That Napoleon might have already risen. The Revolutionary Guards, as you have indicated, have now become a virtual state within the state and run much of the economy, all of the military literally. They have their own intelligence agencies. They have their own prison. They have their own points of entry. They bring in counterfeit commodities that are estimated to gain them $15 billion, $16 billion a year alone on that account. So they, along with Khamenei and Ahmadinejad, this triumvirate I think organized already a coup in Iran. I think Iran, for all practical purposes, can no longer be called a republic, but Islamic government, an Islamic government run by this triumvirate. I think the days of Mr. Khamenei as Velayat-e Fagih. Velayat-e Fagih is a theological concept that indicates that the words of one man are the words of the divine and must end all debate, must end all tension within the regime. And up to now, Khamenei's words were in fact allegedly divine. They did in fact end all crises, but now, for 20 days, he has gone out of his way to try to make this election stick, and he has not succeeded. Last Friday's prayer by Rafsanjani was a direct challenge to Mr. Khamenei, was a direct challenge to everything he has said since the election. So what will happen in the next few weeks will tell us who will actually rule Iran in the next few years. I am not at all convinced that the triumvirate's coup attempt has succeeded. They have the upper hand because they have the military, because they have the goons, because they have the ability to pay this machinery of oppression. But look at the tape of Ahmadinejad's last visit to the city of Mashhad. Look at the few number of people who they succeeded to bring in the city of Mashhad, that was supposed to be one the strongholds, and compare that to the number of people, the millions, who came out for Rafsanjani. So I think part of the problem for the Obama administration is that this situation is in a flux, and we still do not know who shall emerge victorious in this battle. There are three major contradictions in Iran today. I think we need to be aware of them. The most important one is between the people and the regime. The people have shown now clearly, categorically, that they do not want this regime. Millions came into the streets, took life and limb in hand, and declared death to their dictator. There is no clear alternative of where they want to take the regime except that they want it to be more democratic. And their contradiction with this regime is fundamental and structural. This regime cannot solve the problem of the Iranian society. It cannot solve it because 1 million people join the labor force every year. Unemployment is double digits. For the youth, that is three-fifths of the society, unemployment is estimated to be between 25-40 percent. A disproportionate number of the educated entering the labor force are college- educated women. Another problem with the regime also related to women. Women have been relentless in fighting this regime and fighting the misogynist laws that occasionally exist in Islam against women. Women have not given up an inch, and they have continued to fight. And many of the social networks that they have created were in fact the networks that were used by the demonstrators after June 12th. The economy is a major problem for the regime. As Professor Clawson has suggested Ahmadinejad had his hand on $200 billion. Much of it is unaccounted for; $36 billion of it is simply unaccounted for. Where the rest has gone is very little clarity about this. We know he has spread some of it in the smaller cities and the countryside building roads, but that comes nowhere close to the total amount that he has squandered. We know he has given away $5 billion last year alone to regime proxies around the world. This is the figure that was suggested inside Iran from reliable sources with figures. How much to Syria? How much to Hezbollah? How much to Hamas? How much to Latin America? As we speak, Israel's Foreign Minister is traveling to Latin America to counter Iran's influence, not in the Middle East but in Latin America. All of this was possible because of the oil windfall, because of the oil curse. I think the tide is now beginning to turn for the regime. And I think the people, because of this contradiction, are irreconcilably opposed to the status quo. The second contradiction, and again in its depth and severity unlike anything the regime has ever experienced, is between elements of the regime itself. Karubi, Rafsanjani, Moussavi, Khatami, name only the four. These have been the head of one of the three branches of Iranian Government for a total of 34 years, longer than the regime has existed. Now they are in clear opposition to with Khamenei. Now they are part of the coalition for reform. They are not all of the same opinion, but they are all of the opinion that Khamenei has overreached, and that the election must go. That is an incredible moment of crisis. There is a third---- Chairman Berman. Dr. Milani, this is fascinating, but I think, if you could just bring it to a conclusion, there will be ample time for more hearing of your thoughts during the question-and-answer period. Mr. Milani. Okay, in terms of---- Chairman Berman. Just finish it up. Mr. Milani. I think on the question of engagement, my suggestion is that there must be engagement, but we must be very careful when this engagement begins. We must wait for the dust to settle in Iran to realize who wins this. Before we engage with someone, we need to know who that someone is. But engagement, I think there is, as you suggest, no other alternative but engagement as the first next step. [The prepared statement of Mr. Milani follows:]Abbas Milani deg. Chairman Berman. Dr. Rubin. STATEMENT OF MICHAEL RUBIN, PH.D., RESIDENT SCHOLAR, THE AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE, SENIOR LECTURER, NAVAL POSTGRADUATE SCHOOL Mr. Rubin. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen, honorable members, thank you for this opportunity to testify. On July 15th, Secretary of State Clinton spoke of engagement in the course of a broader foreign policy address. About the Islamic Republic, Clinton said, we know that refusing to deal with the Islamic Republic has not succeeded in altering the Iranian march toward a nuclear weapon, reducing Iranian support for terror, or improving Iran's treatment of its citizens. Secretary Clinton is correct to note the challenges the Islamic Republic poses but is incorrect to blame her predecessors rather than the Islamic Republic itself for the failure of diplomacy. It is a myth that the United States has not engaged Iran. Every administration since Jimmy Carter's has engaged the Islamic Republic. In each case, it was not lack of good will on Washington's part but rather the regime leader's disinterest which lead to failure. Ironically, the most hardline U.S. administration toward Iran was Bill Clinton's, at least in its early years. National Security Council official Martin Indyk made dual containment the central pillar of U.S. strategy. As Iranian sponsorship of terrorism and its pursuit of nuclear technology accelerated, the Clinton administration ratcheted up sanctions, issuing two executive orders in 1995, the prohibiting transactions that would lead to the development of Iranian petroleum resources; and then, second, imposing a ban on United States trade with and investment in Iran. Then, in 1996, Congress passed the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, which empowered the United States to act against private companies investing in Iran. Many U.S. policymakers, however, were unhappy with containment. There seems to be little justification for the treatment the United States currently affords Iran because of its nuclear program, former National Security Advisor Brzezinski and Scowcroft argued, suggesting an end to unilateral sanctions and proffering of incentives, such as greater commercial exchange. Iranian President Mohammad Khatami's election, however, lead the Clinton administration to renew its efforts at dialogue. Clinton jumped at the chance to bring Iran in from the cold. He ordered withdrawn and destroyed the FBI's report detailing the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp's involvement in the Khobar Towers bombing. Within weeks, Secretary of State Albright sent a letter to Khatami expressing Washington's desire for government-to- government dialogue. The initiative foundered after the Iranian Government refused to move forward with any dialogue so long as U.S. sanctions and trade bans remained in place. While former National Security Advisor Scowcroft criticized the Clinton administration for obstinacy, Clinton's caution was prudent. Years later Abdollah Ramezanzadeh, the Khatami Government spokesman, acknowledged Tehran's lack of sincerity explaining, ``We had one overt policy, which was one of the negotiation and confidence-building, and a covert policy, which was continuation of the activities.'' Still Clinton remained persistent in pursuit of dialogue. After Albright spoke to the American Islamic Congress in 2000-- sorry, the American Iranian Council in 2000, the Islamic Republic's ambassador at the United Nations said that Iran would be ``prepared to adopt proportionate and positive measures in return.'' While his response made headlines, a year later, Iranian authorities had not offered any discernible measures. Khatami explained that the United States had simply not offered enough for Albright's initiative to merit any response. Ultimately, Albright's unilateral concessions backfired. Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi responded to Albright's ``confessions'' of past U.S. malfeasance by demanding reparations. On July 16th, 2000, the Iranian Government tested a Shihab-3 missile, a deliberate attempt to undercut accelerating Arab-Israeli peace talks. Supreme Leader Khamenei poured cold water on any optimism when, in a July 27th statement, he urged that any negotiations, let alone rapprochement, with Washington would be ``an insult and treason to the Iranian people,'' a position which he retains. Despite the demonization of George W Bush, Bush was more open to diplomacy with the Islamic Republic than any other President since Carter. In 2001 and 2002, United States and Iranian diplomats met to discuss Afghanistan, and the next year Iranian U.N. Ambassador met senior United States officials Zalmay Khalilzad and Ryan Crocker in Geneva. Some say Bush missed a grand bargain opportunity in 2003, but as even pro-engagement officials, like former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage, acknowledge, this is more a myth that resulted from wrongly a deg.ascribing Iranian authorship to an attention-seeking Swiss diplomat's personal initiative. Many advocates of engagement say that its previous failure can be ascribed to the failure to provide adequate incentive or to truly embrace the strategy. Here the European Union provides insight as it long pursued engagement unencumbered by meaningful coercion. Beginning in 1992, the European Union undertook a policy of critical dialogue. Critical engagement did not lead to any noticeable improvement in Iran's human rights conditions, which indeed worsened during the course of the dialogue. Persecution of religious minorities like Bha'is increased and censorship remained heavy-handed. Between 1992 and 1996, the Iranian Government refused to allow a U.N. Special Representative on Human Rights in Iran to visit the country. Between 1995 and 1996, the height of the dialogue, Iranian use of the death penalty doubled. Engagement has also failed to alter Iranian support for terrorism or proliferation activities, issues which more directly impact United States national security. The 2007 National Intelligence Estimate indicated that the Islamic Republic maintained a covert military nuclear program until 2003. That is throughout Khatami's Dialogue of Civilizations. IAEA reports from the period suggest a deliberate counter effort that spanned many years to conceal material, facilities, and activities that were required to have been declared under the safeguard agreements. Earlier this summer, Hassan Rowhani, Iran's former nuclear negotiator, acknowledged to an Iranian interviewer that the Iranian leadership's previous suspension of uranium enrichment at the behest of European negotiators was more tactical than a true concession. We did not accept suspension and construction of centrifuges and continued the effort, she said; we needed a greater number. Despite finding in 2003 that Iran had been developing a uranium centrifuge enrichment program for 18 years, German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer corralled European Union authorities to urge giving the Islam Republic another chance so as not to diminish leverage. Too often, and this is my fear with the Obama administration, the desire to preserve leverage to wield in future diplomacy becomes a chief argument against ever utilizing or pursuing punitive measures based on an adversary's actions. In a diplomatic calculation, ensuring continuation of talks supersedes reality. Of course, diplomacy is the strategy of first resort. It always has been. Unfortunately, it does not always succeed. Engagement has shown itself no magic formula for three reasons, and I offer these in conclusion. First, it takes two to tango, what Carter, Bush the elder, Reagan, and Bush the younger learned, but their domestic critics have not, is that the impediment to engagement lies not in Washington, but in Tehran. When Under Secretary of State William Burns sat down with his Iranian counterpart in Geneva in July 2008, Mohammad Ja'afi Assadi, commander of the Iranian Republican Guard Corps ground forces, quipped that Washington's desperation showed that ``America has no other choice but to leave the Middle East region beaten and humiliated.'' For diplomacy to be effective, the target government must empower its diplomats to negotiate over contested issues and then abide by agreements reached. Unfortunately, Iranian diplomats hold no sway over Iran's nuclear program or terror sponsorship. These are the purview of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Office of the Supreme Leader. And lastly, the Obama administration appears intent to sequence policies. Comprehensive strategies, however, have not only diplomatic but also informational, military, and economic components. Absent any effort to lay the groundwork for either containment or deterrence, both military strategies, Washington is signaling to its allies that the U.S. commitment to protect them is empty. Arab states and Iran's neighbors---- Chairman Berman. Doctor, we do have to---- Mr. Rubin. Okay, I will. Appear more concerned than Congress that neither Obama nor Clinton have articulated by what metric the administration will judge success. This is of paramount importance to prevent Iranian officials from simply running down the clock. [The prepared statement of Mr. Rubin follows:]Michael Rubin deg. Chairman Berman. Thank you very much. Dr. Maloney. STATEMENT OF SUZANNE MALONEY, PH.D., SENIOR FELLOW, SABAN CENTER FOR MIDDLE EAST POLICY, THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTION Ms. Maloney. Thank you and good morning. Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to comment on the past 6 weeks of upheaval in Iran and the consequences of the these developments for the United States and our policy options toward Tehran. In the aftermath of events that have challenged all that we thought we knew about Iran, it is particularly valuable for the committee to address this issue and to engage in a serious reassessment of the most effective means for Washington to influence Tehran's policies and its future course. The Islamic Republic has entered a new and ultimately unpredictable phase of its perpetually gripping history. Iran and the regime are now forced to contend with an almost unprecedented array of internal challenges that are both complex and interconnected. The outrage over the electoral manipulation has spawned a genuine if still embryonic opposition movement, perhaps for the first time since the mid-1980s in Iran, that boasts at least a symbolic leadership and a compelling popular mandate. The other profound consequence for the Iranian regime, as some of the previous panelists have suggested, is the cleavage within the political elite. There has always been factional bickering within Iran, but we have never seen anything at this level. And we have never seen the direct assault on the authority of the Office of the Supreme Leader. In doing so, the crucial component of the Iran's elite has begun to separate itself from the regime to promote the opposing agenda of a nascent mass-based movement. This is highly significant. There are at least three potential directions that Iran's volatile course may yet take. Khamenei's power grab may yet herald the arrival of an increasingly despotic Iranian regime, unconstrained by the niceties of limited electoral institutions or any pretense of popular legitimacy. We can see in Iran's past some precedent for this. In the mid-1980s, the Iranian regime ferociously defended the system and the newly established theocracy against internal threats, both real and perceived. We may well see a reprise of that history. There are at least two alternatives scenarios that would seem more encouraging in the short term. The first would entail some negotiation of a modus vivendi among Iran's hardliners and the quartet of moderate leaders that others have referred to. This could look anything like a super-empowered reform movement in which you saw a kinder, gentler Islamic Republic, or a complete capitulation by the reformist leaders to become a sort of loyalist opposition along the lines of the Iranian freedom movement, which existed for well over a decade after the Islamic Revolution. The third potential scenario at present seems out of reach but remains the most dramatic threat to the Iranian regime. Given time and further catalysts, the elite defections and popular resentment might yet morph into something more powerful, and Iran might experience the genesis of a serious sustained opposition movement dedicated to ousting the current regime. Among the most important factors influencing Iran's future trajectory and the tools available to the international community are those related to the Iranian economy. As Dr. Clawson suggested, Iranians must contend with double-digit inflation; power shortages; a tumbling stock market; stubbornly high unemployment rates, particularly among the large, young population; increasing dependence on volatile resource revenues; and perhaps most ominously for the leadership, a rising tide of indignation among its people. Ironically, of course, Ahmadinejad was elected on the basis of a campaign back in 2005 that focused on the economic grievances of Iranians. And yet he governed on the basis of ideology. And as a result, the President himself bears much direct responsibility for the current state of Iran's economic affairs. His heavy-handed interference with monetary policy and free-wheeling spending contributed to spiraling inflation rates. His provocative foreign policy and reprehensible rhetoric has done more to dissuade potential investors than any United States or United Nations sanctions. His disdain for the technocracy and his somewhat quixotic economic notions have undermined much of the progress that was made in previous years to liberalize the Iranian economy and address its underlying distortions. And he spends like a drunken sailor, as Dr. Clawson has suggested. The senselessness of these policies provoked a firestorm of criticism through his last several years in office. Notably, the critiques were not limited just to his factional adversaries. Much of the disquiet voiced about the economic police of the Ahmadinejad regime has emerged from sources ideologically inclined to support the President and his patron, the supreme leader, including traditional conservatives with longstanding links to the bazaar and the centers of clerical learning. As both Dr. Clawson and Dr. Milani suggest, what had particularly galled many Iranians was the opportunity lost in the past few years. Iran's oil revenues during Ahmadinejad's first term exceeded 8 years of income earned during both the Khatami and the Rafsanjani presidencies. Nearly 40 percent of Iran's oil earnings over the past 30 years came during the past 4 years. And no one knows, as both Dr. Milani and Dr. Clawson have suggested, where much of the deg.this money has gone. The unrest of the past 6 weeks will only aggravate Iran's economic dilemmas and put durable solutions to the perpetual problems of uncontrollable subsidies, unaccountable spending, that much further out of reach. The crisis will persuade more Iranians who have the means and/or ability to leave the country. Even in advance of any multilateral sanctions, political risks and the increasingly unpalatable nature of the new power structure will dissuade investors and reduce the competitiveness of the Iranian economy. The events since June 12th have changed Iran in a profound and an irreversible fashion. It would be fruitless, even counterproductive, to proceed as if this were not the case. The United States must adjust both its assumptions about Iran and its approach to dealing with our concerns about Iranian policies. But the turmoil in Iran has not altered our core interests vis-a-vis Iran, nor has it manifestly strengthened the case for alternatives to the Obama administration's stated policy of diplomacy. As a result, I remain a supporter of the American strategy of engaging Iran. The United States is going to have to deal with an increasingly paranoid and dogmatic Iranian regime, one that is preoccupied with a low-level popular insurgency and schism among its leadership. Still, the Obama administration's interest in engagement was never predicated on the palatability of the Iranian leadership but on the urgency of the world's concerns and the less promising prospects of the array of policy alternatives. How do we draw thuggish theocracy to the bargaining table? The hurdles are not insurmountable. The context for the successful 1980 to 1981 diplomacy that lead to the release of the American hostages was at least as challenging of that of today. At that time, you also had a situation in which most of the moderates had been forced out of the Iranian Government, and the people who we were sitting across the bargaining table from were from a particularly hardline group of people whose authority, credibility, and ultimate goals were very much obscure. A successful agreement entailed months of work and many false starts, but a variety of tools, including secret diplomacy, the involvement of a third-party mediator as a guarantor for the eventual agreement, helped facilitate an outcome. Perhaps a critical factor in the success of the hostage negotiations was Iran's desperate need for economic and diplomatic options after the Iraqi invasion. In a similar respect, any U.S. effort to negotiate with Tehran will benefit from the identification of counterincentives that can similarly focus the minds of Iranian leaders and expedite the path of negotiators. This is the proper role for coordination with U.S. allies on an intensification of sanctions should engagement fail. And here we should focus our efforts on Beijing. We shouldn't presume too much with respect to the efficacy of sanctions. There are no silver bullets, and sanctions, in fact, haven't proven successful in the past in reversing Iranian policies. But they work best when they alter the perceptions, timing, and utility of swaying a critical constituency, and this is where our efforts should be focused. Finally, to conclude, let me just say that we are facing a situation of intense fluidity in Iran, and we should always be applying a test of the ``island of stability'' sort of rhetoric that was used by the Carter administration in the run up to the Iranian Revolution. We don't know simply whom we are going to be dealing with in a year's time in Iran. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Ms. Maloney follows:]Suzanne Maloney deg. Chairman Berman. Thank you. Karim. STATEMENT OF MR. KARIM SADJADPOUR, ASSOCIATE, MIDDLE EAST PROGRAM, CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE Mr. Sadjadpour. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, it is an honor to be here with you today. It took us 30 years, took the United States 30 years to finally prepare ourselves to recognize the legitimacy of the Iranian regime just when the Iranian regime has lost its legitimacy, and this is truly the dilemma the Obama administration faces dealing with a disgraced regime which presents urgent foreign policy charges, while at the same time not betraying this incredibly courageous population. I would like to make a few points about the domestic implications for Iran and also a few points about the implications for United States foreign policy. In my mind, there have been two important casualties of the last 6 weeks. The first is the moniker of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Iran has ceded any claims, any pretensions of being a republic. In my opinion, Iran has now become a cartel of hardline Revolutionary Guardsmen and hardline clergymen, who have made, as Abbas said, tremendous amounts of money the last few years and are unwilling to cede power. They describe themselves as so-called principle-ists, but in reality their real principles are power and greed. The other important casualty from the last 5 weeks has been the loss of legitimacy of the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei. For the last two decades, he had carefully cultivated this image of a magnanimous godfather who stays above the fray. But those days of Khamenei wielding power without accountability are now over. He has tied himself firmly with the fate of President Ahmadinejad, and it is unprecedented to have hundreds of thousands of people taking to the streets now chanting, ``Marg bar Khamenei,'' death to Khamenei. A word about the population. According to Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, who is the mayor of Tehran, himself a former senior Revolutionary Guard commander, 3 million people took to the streets in Tehran at the height of the protests. And I can tell you from talking to people throughout Iran, and just viewing the images, that these demonstrators have truly encompassed an incredibly wide swath of Iranian society. They transcended age, religiosity, gender, geographic location. The scale of the demonstrations has certainly decreased the last few weeks because the regime does repression very well, and they are able to prevent large amounts of people from congregating in one area, but the nightly protest chants of ``Allahu Akbar,'' God is great, reminiscent of the 1979 Iran revolution, in order to keep the momentum going, have continued unabated. Now a word about the opposition. The bulk of the leadership of the opposition and their brain trust is now either in prison, under house arrest, or unable to freely communicate. So you have this tremendous popular outrage, but you don't have the leadership which is able to tap into this tremendous popular outrage and channel it politically. That is the dilemma both the demonstrators and the opposition currently face. A word, however, about the costs of this repression for the regime, both the political costs and the financial costs. As Abbas mentioned, we have seen unprecedented fissures in Iran. It would be unheard of that a pillar of the 1979 revolution, Hashemi Rafsanjani, has come out now in the opposition implicitly questioning the legitimacy of the Supreme Leader. Former President Mohammad Khatami, who received 24 million votes not long ago, has called for a referendum. So truly at the level of the political elite, there is unprecedented fissures. I think what we should focus on and what would truly be devastating for Khamenei and Ahmadinejad would be fissures amongst the regime's security forces, namely the Revolutionary Guards. So far we haven't seen that, but the Revolutionary Guards are a very large entity, 120,000 men. And whereas the senior commanders are hand-picked by Khamenei, and they are going to likely remain loyal to him, the rank and file, both empirically and anecdotally, we have seen, are much more representative of Iranian society at large. Also a word about the financial costs of this repression. It cost a lot of money to have a state of martial law, to have overflowing prisons, to have communication blackouts, and to prevent Iranians from viewing satellite broadcasts from abroad. It is estimated that for the regime to jam the satellite broadcasts from Voice of America Persian Language Service and BBC Persian, it cost them several thousand dollars per minute. Multiply that over a 5-week period, and we see that the regime is truly bleeding tens of millions of dollars just to retain this level of repression. Now a brief word on the implications for U.S. policy. I would first say that I believe President Obama's overtures have played a role in accentuating the deep internal divisions within Iran. A couple months ago I encountered a fairly senior conservative, pragmatic official, Iranian official, in the Middle East, who remarked to me that there is a lot of pressure now on hard-liners in Tehran to justify their enmity toward the United States. What he said to me, to paraphrase, is that if Iran can't make nice with Barack Hussein Obama, who is preaching mutual respect on a weekly basis, and sending us noerooz greetings, it is pretty obvious the problem lies in Tehran and not Washington. And I think the cleavages we have seen in the last 6 weeks, the Obama administration's initial overtures, I think, had played a role in that. I do believe, however, that it is time to reassess U.S. policy postelection, and what I would argue is that we should not be thinking or talking about engagement yet. Just as we didn't want to intervene in Iran's internal affairs after the election by forcefully coming out in favor of the opposition, I think by prematurely engaging before the dust has settled in Tehran, we may implicitly endorse these election results, demoralize the opposition, and unwittingly tip the balance in favor of the hard-liners, namely Khamenei and Ahmadinejad. So I don't say renounce engagement, but let us hold off until the dust settles. I believe--yeah. Okay. Just one last point, and that is that we shouldn't underestimate the magnitude of this moment. Iran is the only country in the Middle East in which if you hear about popular protests, it doesn't give you indigestion. You hear about popular protests in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Jordan, it is not a hopeful sign. And Iran certainly, as we have seen, these young people are agitating for greater political voice, greater economic freedoms, greater social freedoms. And they may not achieve this within the next weeks or months or even years, but we should appreciate the magnitude of what has transpired the last few weeks, and we should certainly try to pursue policies which don't deter this moment and do not alter its trajectory. [The prepared statement of Mr. Sadjadpour follows:]Karim Sadjadpour deg. Chairman Berman. Thank you very much. And now our final witness, Professor Kittrie. STATEMENT OF ORDE F. KITTRIE, J.D., PROFESSOR OF LAW, ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY, CO-DIRECTOR, IRAN ENERGY PROJECT, FOUNDATION FOR DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACIES Mr. Kittrie. Chairman Berman, Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen, distinguished members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today. I have been asked to focus on how to use sanctions to leverage the economic vulnerability to which Dr. Clawson and others referred. Disappointingly, the Obama administration's outstretched hand has thus far been met with a clenched Iranian fist. Until now that outstretched American hand has been accompanied by the maintenance of existing sanctions. Congressional sanctions bills have, as the chair said, served as a kind of sword of Damocles, hanging high over the head of the Iranian regime. Yet Iran's nuclear power has raced forward, and Iran's leadership has continued to insist there are no incentives that could induce it to halt or even meaningfully limit its nuclear program. It has become increasingly clear if the Iran regime is going to be peacefully persuaded to halt its illegal nuclear program, we will first need to change its cost-benefit calculus. In light of this and the regime's brutal measures to crush the postelection protests, it is time both to increase the weight of the sword of Damocles hanging over the Iranian regime's head and to begin lowering the sword. In a moment I will suggest some ways in which the sanctions threat to Iran can be increased and made more imminent, but first a threshold question: Can strong sanctions really contribute to stopping an illicit nuclear weapons program? The answer is yes. For example, strong U.N. Security Council sanctions were a pivotal factor in inducing Libya's Government to allow British and American Government experts to enter Libya and completely dismantle its WMD infrastructure by April 2004. As the ranking member said, that should be our goal with regard to Iran. In addition, it was discovered in the wake of the United States occupation of Iraq, too late unfortunately, that strong U.N. Security Council sanctions had helped destroy Iraq's nuclear weapons program and prevent Saddam Hussein from restarting it between the Gulf War in 1991 and the coalition occupation of Iraq in 2003. However, the sanctions imposed on Iran by the international community thus far are much weaker than the sanctions that helped stop the Libyan and Iraqi nuclear weapons program. The Security Council's Iran sanctions are still far to weak to, A, persuade Iran's leadership that the benefits of proceeding with its nuclear program are outweighed by the sanctions costs of proceeding with it; to, B, meaningfully contain Iran's nuclear program; or, C, deter other countries that are watching from someday following Iran's lead. That is unfortunate, because Iran's heavy dependence on foreign trade leaves it potentially highly vulnerable to strong economic sanctions. The following are some ways in which Congress could both increase and make more imminent the sanctions to Iran. Number one, I urge the committee to do what it takes to position the Iran Refined Petroleum Sanctions Act for immediate enactment if no significant progress is made by the time of the G-20 summit meeting. If I understood correctly, the chair just announced for the first time that he sees early fall as a time frame for an IRPSA markup, and I commend him for that sharpening of his timeline. Number two, Congress can and should in the meantime continue its smaller steps to squeeze Iran's suppliers of refined petroleum and other strategic goods. Steps such as encouraging the executive branch and governments at the State and local level to use their own discretion and market power to put Iran's key suppliers to a business choice between the United States governmental and Iranian markets. Number three, while IRPSA is an excellent bill, a cut-off of Iran's refined petroleum supplies may not be sufficient to convince the Iranian regime that the benefits of its nuclear program are outweighed by the sanctions costs of proceeding with the program. There are a number of provisions in other Iran sanctions bills that I urge be passed alongside IRPSA. I list them all in my written statement. These additional provisions include, and I will highlight just a few, first, provisions that would cut off most remaining direct United States trade with Iran. According to recent reports by the Associated Press and other sources, the United States had $685 million in exports to Iran in 2008. That is an 80-fold increase over the $8 million in United States exports to Iran in 2001. An 80-fold increase. It will be harder for the United States to convince Europe to put stronger sanctions on Iran if the United States does not itself stop trading directly with Iran. President Clinton had in 1995 banned essentially all U.S. trade with Iran; however, the U.S. had in 1999 and 2000, in a gesture to the relatively moderate Khatami, eased the trade ban. The United States should reclose these exceptions to direct trade with Iran. Another step, another provision, that should be added or passed alongside, provisions such as those in H.R. 1327 that would encourage and facilitate State and local divestment from companies doing business with Iran; and finally, provisions such as those in the ranking member's H.R. 1208 that would strongly discourage and reduce the transshipment of sensitive goods to Iran through third countries. In conclusion, the United States' considerable leverage of Iran's suppliers of refined petroleum and other strategic goods may mean that aggressive unilateral sanctions could have a dispositive impact on Iran's economy and thus its nuclear program. In the face of persistent Russian, Chinese, and European reluctance to impose strong sanctions on Iran, creative and aggressive U.S. unilateral sanctions may turn out to be our last best hope for peacefully convincing Iran that the cost of its nuclear program is too high. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Kittrie follows:]Orde Kittrie deg. Chairman Berman. Well, thank you all very much. Very interesting, provocative testimony. I will yield myself 7 minutes, our new, once only time limit for this question-and-answer process. I am going to focus just first on the political issue. A few of you spent some time talking about--one of you referred to it, I think Dr. Milani-- as sort of a purgatory, an uncertainty. Dr. Maloney and Karim Sadjadpour spoke about how this thing might play out. But let me try and push you. You are experts, so you are supposed to predict when you don't know. Is the near-term existence--I mean, I took it at least some of you were approaching the point of saying the near-term existence of the regime is in question. And is the opposition movement more about restoring the legitimacy and integrity of the regime or about a regime change? A few of you who want to take that up could start with that. Mr. Milani. I think the opposition, in my mind, is divided in two groups. Some, like Rafsanjani, are more moderate. Rafsanjani, I think, wants a more refined version of the status quo. Moussavi and the rest of them, although they have not articulated it, I think want a return--some of them have implicitly said they want a return to the first draft of the Constitution. People forget the first draft of the Islamic Constitution did not have the concept of velayat-e fagih, where one spiritual ruler has absolute sway. The first draft of the Constitution was, in fact, a republican draft. Only when Khomeini realized that the opposition is weak, only when he realized that the crisis, the American hostage crisis, and the war with Iraq has created for him a situation did they ram through the Parliament, the constituent assembly, this provision of the law. I think that concept is now dead because Rafsanjani's words are no longer accepted. And many of the top clerics in Iran-- shi'ism has a very strong, peculiar structure. There are ayatollahs, and there are lower figures, hojjatoleslams. The ayatollahs have almost universally, with the exception of two, spoken against the status quo, spoken against the suppression; have considered it a sin to beat on innocent people. One old ayatollah, Mr. Montazeri, has basically issued a fatwa that says Mr. Khamenei no longer has the virtue, the capacity to hold the position that he has. So the crisis, I think, is a very serious crisis for the regime as we know it, but whether a democratic alternative will come out of it as we understand democracy is unknown. Chairman Berman. Anyone else want to come in on this? Mr. Sadjadpour. I would say in general that preelection this was a referendum on Ahmadinejad. Postelection, I think this is a referendum in many ways on Ayatollah Khamenei himself. And in general terms, Abbas is right that the opposition, I think, casts a very wide net. There is a diversity of opinions. But I would say broadly speaking, they want to see the disempowerment of the unelected institutions in Iran, namely the institution of the Supreme Leader and the Guardian Council, and the empowerment of the elected institutions, namely the institution of the Presidency and the Parliament. Ms. Maloney. I think that gets to the nature of your question, the near-term continuation of the regime, what kind of regime will it be? Clearly the de facto opposition leaders, the four political leaders, Rafsanjani, Khatami, Moussavi, and Karubi, who are the kind of nominal leaders of what we are calling an opposition, are not people who are looking to move beyond the system. They are looking for some substantial greater, or lesser in some cases, modification of the system, much as Khatami sought to do when he was President. What he has talked about is not dissimilar from what he tried to do in terms of limiting the Office of the Supreme Leader and elevating and empowering the elected offices of the Iranian system. What the population wants, I think, is still unclear. The protesters, in the aftermath of the election, tried very hard to make it clear that they were not, in fact, challenging the system. They focused their grievances on the election itself. But once you begin to attack the Office of the Supreme Leader, once you begin to say, ``Marg bar Khamenei,'' or, ``Ahmen eraft,'' reprising one of the famous lines in the newspaper in 1979 about the Shah, I think you begin to raise questions about the longevity of the system. They are not short-term questions, though. Mr. Clawson. If I may just quickly add, those who stormed the Bastille were loyal subjects of the King. I don't think that is how the French Revolution turned out. These things have a dynamic, and if Khamenei goes because of protests, expect further change. Chairman Berman. And that is a nice segue into the question of what does that change mean for the United States? What changes in tone or policy might follow on? A couple of questions that are very important from my point of view: What does it mean in the context of a uranium enrichment program? What does it mean in terms of the continued financial support for terrorist organizations? Is it foregone that those policies continue, or is what Dr. Clawson hinted at, the potential of greater change, in the offing? Mr. Milani. You know, when the confrontation between Israel and Gaza occurred, Iran did virtually nothing, virtually said nothing. And I think that was a reflection of the fact that they were economically straddled. They no longer had the $1 billion to give to Hezbollah to give out as insurance for rebuilding the houses. But when we think about sanctions, unless the sanctions are crippling, the sanctions have also a positive point for the regime. The regime has used the sanction as an excuse to cover its economic incompetence. It keeps blaming the United States for these problems. Unless we can come up with the kind of a sanction that will do to Iran what the international sanctions did to South Africa, and I would be all for that, a half-baked sanction that gives the regime the excuse to offer as an alternative this explanation for why there isn't energy in the street, why there are no lights at night I think would politically help the regime. Chairman Berman. So in the context of our earlier metaphor, the regime also tries to claim why the sun rises in the East, and it is the fault--okay. I am happy to recognize my ranking member, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. Questions for Dr. Rubin and Dr. Kittrie: Earlier this week Secretary Clinton stated that ``we want Iran to calculate what I think is a fair assessment, that if the United States extends a defense umbrella over the region, if we do even more to develop the military capacity of those allies in the gulf, it is unlikely that Iran will be any stronger or safer.'' Secretary Clinton also said that North Korea must agree to irreversible denuclearization before returning to multilateral disarmament talks. How can we account for such a contradictory position, given the President's June 4th statement that he said Iran should have the right to access peaceful nuclear power if it complies with its responsibilities under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty? Why would the administration now demand full denuclearization of North Korea, yet not do so for Iran nor Syria? Do you believe that this, in fact, is the administration's acceptance of a nuclear Iran? I will ramble on here, and then whatever time you have got left. The GAO recently reported that the International Atomic Energy Agency has provided Iran and other state sponsors of terrorism millions of dollars in nuclear assistance over the past decade. The GAO recommended that Congress consider restricting the U.S. contribution to the IAEA for its technical cooperation program. I have introduced legislation to do just that. I would like your comments on whether this would put significant pressure on the Iranian regime. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to the witnesses. Mr. Rubin. I will start, if I may, very briefly. The contradictory statements that come out of the administration on proliferation undercut our policies across the board. And anyone that looks at the North Korean press or the Iranian press will certainly see reference to the other in those cases. With regard to the broader problems, we see Iran's nuclear breakout as an untenable issue, untenable for U.S. national security. The problem is that other regional states, most specifically Israel, see it as an existential threat, and unless we are seen to have credibility in that our diplomacy is going to advance to the point where Iran will not become a nuclear weapons-capable power, then we risk Israel making a calculation based upon its own interests, which could plunge the region into chaos. Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Thank you. Mr. Kittrie. Thank you. The U.N. Security Council, in Resolution 1737 of December 2006, explicitly ordered Iran to, without further delay, suspend proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities, including all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, and work on all heavy-water-related projects. The IAEA--not the Obama administration, not the Bush administration, the IAEA--has explicitly stated, including in its June 2009 report, that Iran has not abided by those legally binding orders of the Security Council. I am troubled by the administration's implication that perhaps something less than the U.N. Security Council resolutions would be acceptable. The NPT regime is at stake, and I think we need to do whatever it takes from a sanctions perspective to make sure that Iran abides by those legally binding U.N. Security Council resolutions. Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Thank you. And I just have 3 minutes left. Can a regime that now defines itself and its domestic legitimacy by its nuclear weapons program be convinced to effectively discard that program? Mr. Rubin. I am not sure that it can be without some robust coercion. One of the things which I chafe at when I hear the media is the description of Iran's nuclear program. What we are actually talking about when it comes to a potential nuclear weapons program is the command and control of the Office of the Supreme Leader and Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. As Karim alluded to in his testimony, while we talk a great deal about the political spectrum, hard-liners, reformers and so on, when it comes to the IRGC, that tends to be a black box when it comes to the political factions therein. We simply don't know a lot about what is going on inside the IRGC, and that should scare us to death, considering it is not the Iranian people or the protesters in the street that are going to have any say in this program, it is going to be the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Office of the Supreme Leader. Should change come, Iranians are, of course, fiercely nationalistic. But our problem, and the International Atomic Energy Agency's problem, has been Iranian noncompliance with nuclear safeguard agreements. It would be a lot easier to verify Iran's intentions should there be much more significant change across the board in Iranian society. It should also lastly be noted that the Iranian people are far more moderate than the Iranian Government is, and therefore, if the Iranian Government were to somehow become much more accountable to its people, that would also have a moderating effect on the issues not only of nuclear intentions, but also of state support for terrorism. Mr. Kittrie. Your question is a good one, and as it happens, there are some very interesting precedents, both the Iraq and Libya precedents, where these dictators gave up their nuclear programs under pressure, and indeed, there are also a number of instances of where countries have given up actual nuclear arsenals, including Kazakhstan, Belarus, Ukraine, and South Africa. All had actual nuclear arsenals that they gave up. So if we play our cards right, I think there is reason for optimism. Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Thank you so much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to the witnesses. Chairman Berman. Thank you. I wish Iraq had told us they had given it up. The gentleman from New York, Mr. Ackerman. Mr. Ackerman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Engagement. I think I have seen the movie before. I would concede that I saw it in a different theater, but that doesn't disqualify me from thinking that I suspect that I can remember how it ends. If there is a chance that we could have engagement with Iran, with whom right now would we negotiate? I ask that question fervently believing that despite the fact that there may be some confusion over who comes out on top, I would be shocked if I thought any of you would suggest that they have stopped their nuclear weapons program while that dynamic is happening. Who would you talk to if you were the President and made a phone call? Or would you not talk to anybody until some of the dust settles, and it becomes clearer with that clock ticking within the alligator? Mr. Clawson. Personally, I would wait for their phone call. I think that the ball is in their court---- Mr. Ackerman. Okay. Mr. Clawson [continuing]. And that we shouldn't rush, and that we have shown the world that we are interested in engaging, and that---- Mr. Ackerman. So you would allow them to continue to develop their nuclear weapons program with the Israeli clock ticking at the same time? Mr. Clawson. I wouldn't be in any great rush to engage with them. Mr. Ackerman. Okay. Dr. Maloney? Ms. Maloney. I think that is the reality. I am sorry, Maloney and Milani, we often find ourselves conflated here, but I think that is where the administration is at this point. There have been a number of gestures that were made earlier in the year. The administration is prepared for a response and, I think rightfully so, is going to play out this clock. Mr. Ackerman. Okay. Dr. Milani? Mr. Milani. You know, my sense is that the two clocks, the nuclear clock and the democratic clock, are interlinked. This regime cannot be relied on to abide by its words. Even if it promises to stop its nuclear program, a regime that---- Mr. Ackerman. You have seen the movie, too. Mr. Milani. I have seen the movie. But I would say that engaging with them creatively and wisely helps the democratic clock. We will not have a resolution of the nuclear program unless we have a democratic regime in Iran. Every policy, in my view, that tries to stop the nuclear program must have the democratic clock. Mr. Ackerman. Okay. Dr. Sadjadpour? Mr. Sadjadpour. I am not a doctor yet, but, you know, I think there is a policy which reconciles these two goals of preventing Iran's--or deterring Iran's nuclear ambitions, while at the same time helping to facilitate the conditions for the Iranian people. But I would simply agree with what Patrick Clawson said, that the Obama administration has made tremendous efforts to reach out to Tehran. The dust hasn't settled in Tehran, so we shouldn't reach out yet. Mr. Ackerman. Okay. We are 0 for 4 on negotiating. Dr. Rubin? Mr. Rubin. If the Supreme Leader and the IRGC aren't prepared to talk on nuclear and terrorism issues, we need to consider what our plan Bs, Cs and---- Mr. Ackerman. 0 for 5. Professor Kittrie. Mr. Kittrie. The offer of dialogue is---- Mr. Ackerman. Press your button. Mr. Kittrie. The offer of dialogue is on the table. I don't think we should just sit back and wait. I think we should be squeezing the Iranians as time goes on in the ways I described. Mr. Ackerman. 0 for 5\\1/2\\. In order for us to have any effect on the process of stopping a nuclear program, we have often talked about big carrots and big sticks, which I think the administration has referred to previously, and certainly the chairman has advocated in the past. The question is really the big sticks, which we have not implemented whatsoever. Should we be right now, as quickly as we can, ratcheting up critical sanctions in which we get as many international players involved? Mr. Clawson. Mr. Chairman, as big a problem as the stick has been that Khamenei thinks our carrot is poisoned. He thinks that, in fact, our objective is to overthrow his regime through a velvet revolution. And so, therefore, he is completely unconvinced that doing a deal on the nuclear issue is going to bring him any benefit whatsoever. Mr. Ackerman. If there were big sticks in effect, if we indeed were able to realize a rapid implementation of sanctions that had a more crushing impact on their economy, does not that help us? Mr. Clawson. Our problem is he thinks we are going to keep up those sanctions until he goes. He thinks that our real objective is to get rid of him and to get rid of his system. So he thinks that the nuclear issue is just their latest ruse that we are using for our goal of a velvet revolution. Mr. Ackerman. My question is, don't economic sanctions help the people in the street? Ms. Maloney. Iran is a rational actor. The regime makes cost-benefit calculations. It has reversed policy on very critical issues, including the decision to end the war after Khomeini inveighed against that for years. Mr. Ackerman. Who would make that decision now? With everything going on, who would make that decision now? Is there anybody able to make that decision? Ms. Maloney. The Supreme Leader, deg. Ayatollah Khamenei. Mr. Milani. I don't think Khamenei is no longer in a position to make that decision. I think a clique of the Revolutionary Guards are as much in charge of Iran's foreign policy as Khamenei is, and I think without their say, that won't happen. Again, I think you have to remember there is something very unusual about the Iranian people. They are the only pro-American Muslim society. We need to keep that in mind. Mr. Ackerman. Yes. Mr. Sadjadpour? Mr. Sadjadpour. I think the most devastating blow to the Iranian economy would be a precipitous decline in oil prices. A $1 decline in oil price is about $900 million lost annual revenue for Iran. And a country which can most effectively bring oil prices down in the near term is Saudi Arabia. Mr. Rubin. If we are interested in diplomacy, coercion amplifies diplomacy. Chairman Berman. The time of the gentleman has expired, and the gentleman from Indiana, Mr. Burton, is recognized. Mr. Burton. You know, Mr. Chairman, it seems to me there is three avenues to solve the problem. One is a dialogue, and we have tried that, and it hasn't worked. That kind of thing was tried with Libya, and it didn't work. And then Ronald Reagan bombed the hell out of Libya, and that changed everything pretty quick. And when the Israelis decided to knock out the nuclear development program in 1982, and they were criticized for it, that changed the attitude of Iraq a little bit, although Saddam Hussein was still a lunatic. It seems to me that if we don't impose sanctions immediately, really strong sanctions, nothing is going to change over there. And I would like to give you an example. Most of you are too young to remember, but after the Treaty of Versailles in World War I, the Germans weren't supposed to have over 100,000 people in their military so they would never be a threat to Europe anymore. Instead, a man named Adolf Hitler used 100,000 people to train a multimillion-man army. And because we wanted to make sure there was peace in the world, and we were involved in trade, Rolls Royce engines were being sold to the Luftwaffe in Germany, and he built up the biggest military machine in history. And instead of trying to put economic pressure on Adolf Hitler, we tried to negotiate with him. We tried to talk to him. We didn't put any sanctions on him. And in 1938, Lord Chamberlain went to Munich, came back with a piece of paper saying, ``Peace in our time,'' gave away the Sudetenland, and 60 million people died. You know, we are in the atomic age. We are in the nuclear age now. If we don't deal with this now, we could see what happened in World War II to be child's play. There could be millions and billions of people killed in a nuclear conflagration, not to mention the economic problems that would arise after you have a war in the Middle East, where so much of our energy comes from. So we have to do something now. I mean, all this talk is great, and I really appreciate the intellectual approaches that you are talking about and how we ought to be talking to them and working with them. We have been trying. We tried, and we tried, and we tried, and it hasn't worked. And so it seems to me the next thing we do is we use the hammer, and that is a sanction. We take the chairman's legislation, and any other legislation we can come up with, get it passed, get our allies to work with us as much as possible, put a freeze on all their assets in the United States, hammer these guys really hard right now; and then if that doesn't work, and they continue with all these development programs, these centrifuges and everything else they are doing over there, then something is going to have to be done to stop them, because they want to destroy Israel, and they have said that we are not their best friend, and they don't much care about doing something like that to America. This is a world threat in my opinion. Just one voice up here, but I think a lot of my colleagues share this view. I think it is extremely important that all sanctions be put in place as quickly as possible. Let them know we mean business, and let them know that the next stage is going to be something that they are not going to want to have happen. It worked with Libya, and I think it would work there as well. We don't want to hurt those people. The people in Iran are good people. They like America. They dress like Americans in many cases. They try to live like Americans. But those guys in charge over there need to get the message, and these sanctions are the way to get the message to them, and they need to know what is going to happen next. Now, Israel is threatened. A nuclear weapons program that develops a nuclear capability with a delivery system threatens the very existence of a very small country called Israel. And they have nuclear weapons. Unless we do something and do it relatively quickly, in my opinion, we are going to see a real threat of a conflagration over there that nobody wants. And I hope you will just take what I have said to heart. I know you have differences of opinion. I know some of you have a much more pacifistic approach, a much more reasonable approach. But if you look at history and see what has happened in the past, you know that there is a real correlation between the way we treated what happened in World War II and what is happening right now. You have to let them know you mean business. You have to impose those sanctions, and they have to know what is coming next if they don't deal with it. And I yield back. Mr. Clawson. Sir, if I may say that as you indicated, the prospects for diplomacy are poor. Frankly, so are the prospects of resolving this problems deg. through sanctions. Mr. Burton. How do you know that? How do you know that? How do you know if we put the hammer on them as far as the bill that the chairman is talking about and the President would utilize, how do you know if we froze all their assets here in the United States, how do you know if we didn't get our allies to do some of this that it wouldn't work? To say that it won't work, the people are out on the streets right now because of the election. You think if the cost of everything goes up, and the unemployment rate goes through the ceiling that they are not going to want to do something about it? Mr. Clawson. Mr. Khamenei doesn't care much about the economy. Mr. Burton. Well, he will if they are out there in the streets after him with guns and knives and everything else. And that is what is happening. That is what happens when the people feel the pressure from sanctions that are severe. And we can do it. Their assets are here. Their production of oil, their need for oil and gasoline. This idea--I am about out of time. But this idea that you can negotiate with a tyrant who sends people into the surrounding countries to blow themselves up because they are going to go to Valhalla or someplace, I mean, he doesn't--he is a power-hungry man, and the only thing he understands, like any bully in a school yard or a world theater, is strength. And the first fist you give him is sanctions that are so severe that everybody feels it in that country, and then I think you will see a lot of uprising in the people. And then if that doesn't work, you have to do something else. Chairman Berman. Would the gentleman yield? Mr. Milani. Congressman, the United States negotiated with Hitler. The United States negotiated with Stalin. The United States, President Nixon unilaterally began negotiations with Mao Zedong that was personally responsible for the death of 30 million people and 10 million people during the Cultural Revolution. The fact that these are despots and dictators does not mean that we should not negotiate with them. It means we should not allow them to be dictators. A unilateral United States sanction helps Rafsanjani, Khamenei, and the regime, and it will because there is China out there. There is Russia out there. There is Venezuela out there. These guys have created an international brotherhood of despotism. You are not working in isolation. Germany, the United States ally, just sold $700 million of the most sophisticated equipment for censoring people and beating up people. Well, stop those, and you will stop the regime. Chairman Berman. The time of the gentleman who was around for the signing of the Treaty of Versailles has expired. Mr. Delahunt. Mr. Delahunt. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I don't know how you follow that, the Versailles Treaty. When was the Versailles Treaty tried? I guess, Mr. Milani, you know, I understand the hammer. I guess let me pose this question again to the panel, but let me start with Dr. Milani, because I think I agree with what he was going to say. The issue is, from where I see it, if we use the hammer, is there a likelihood that the nationalist impulse among the Iranian people will rally and support the current government? Mr. Milani. I think if the Iranian people feel like the nation is under assault, if there is a military strike, I would be extremely surprised if people don't rally around the regime. That is why I think a military option in this current situation is the only thing that will save this tyrannical triumvirate that has seized power. Mr. Delahu"
