        "text": "MONKS THE TRANSATLANTIC FEEDBACK (PLAY LOUDD)\n\nDirected by Lucía Palacios & Dietmar Post\n\nIf you had found yourself in mid-1960s Germany, flicking through channels until you came to the Ready Steady Go equivalent that was Beat-Club, you may have been somewhat surprised to see a five-piece group clad in black with dog collars andshaved tonsures grinding outa primitive organ and electric banjo-led number called 'BoysAre Boys And Girls Are Choice, bringing some serious avant-garde dissonance to the grooving pop kids. Gerry &The Pacemakers these were not. Decades ahead of their time, and releasing only one album before splitting to return home in 1967, the five American GIs who made up Monks were pioneering towards the more extreme frontiers of krautrock, metal and post-punk before any of these genres had even been dreamed of. This excel- lent documentary from DietmarPost and Lucia Palacios, which won a German TV Oscar in 2008, tells the Monks strange tale in a straightforward manner using witty and insightful interview footage with al original band members, spliced together with effective use of period footage leading up to the most unlikely of reunions ni 1999. Stuffed with extras, including the full brilliance of their Beat-Club performance, this is a fairly essential DVD for anyone interested in map- ping out an alternative rock n' roll timeline.-Euan Andrews\n\nTHE CASE OF THE THREE SIDED DREAM- A documentary film on the music and life of Rahsaan Roland Kirk.\n\nDirected by Adam Kahan\n\nRahsaan was a one of a kind musician, personality, satirist and windmill-slayer who despite being blind, becoming paralyzed, and facing America’s racial injustices – did not relent. His life’s work was exploring sound and making music. Beyond that, he was an outspoken activist who started a political movement to get more exposure for Jazz in America – particularly on TV.Dreams were important to Rahsaan. They planted the seed in his mind to play three horns simultaneously. His name came from dreams. When asked about his religious beliefs, he would say: “I’m from the Religion of Dreams”.At the age of 40, Rahsaan suffered a stroke which left him half paralyzed. Despite this, he continued to tour and play music, with the use of only one hand, literally until the day he died.\n\nQ&A with filmmaker Adam Kahan Thursday at 12pm PST.

Bird and Diz are gone, but giants still walk among us. One of those giants is Buster Williams. Buster has played with everyone – Miles, Sarah Vaughan, Nancy Wilson, Art Blakey, and on. In this intimate portrait, Buster trades stories, and plays, with some of the world’s greatest musicians – Benny Golson, Herbie Hancock, Christian McBride and others, and takes us on a journey through his life, legacy, and America’s greatest art form - the truly universal music called Jazz.\n\nQ&A with filmmaker Adam Kahan Thursday June 20th at 12pm PST Sign up and join in the Conversation!\n\nHOT STUFF- DONNA SUMMER\n\nDirected by Lucía Palacios & Dietmar Post\n\nFame is greedy. It devours people, skin and all. The documentary Donna Summer – Hot Stuff opens with scenes from a chat show in the 1980s. The host asks what the singer thinks of the cliches about her. ‘Disco diva?’ She just giggles: ‘Tss’. ‘Queen of sex?’ She sighs: ‘Urgh.’ Donna Summer rose to fame in the mid 1970s with her hits ‘Love To Love You Baby’ and ‘I Feel Love’, which feature her softly sung verses and sensual vocalizing over producer Giorgio Moroder’s futuristic Moog synthesizer beats. Fame followed her for the rest of her life. One critic from Time magazine reckoned that Summer simulated 22 orgasms on ‘Love To Love You’, while the record cover showed her in a nightdress. “I felt like a product,” said Summer later. “Like a bottle that someone had stuck a label on.” She did of course contribute to the product. One night, when the line ‘I love to love you’ came to her, she called Moroder. Directors Lucia Palacios and Dietmar Post conducted research for their fascinating film on both sides of the Atlantic. They spoke to the singer’s sister and brother and others who knew her well, like her former partner Peter Mühldorfer and the producer Harold Faltermeyer. Donna Summer’s voice appears frequently like a ghost, recorded during a phone call in November 2011. She says she is ‘good, great’. The interview arranged for the following summer never took place. In May 2012, at the age of 63, the singer died of lung cancer. Donna Summer’s career develops into a struggle for emancipation and control. She moves to LA to advance her success in America. Her album ‘Bad Girls’ is number one in the charts and in total she will sell over 130 million records. But according to Moroder, her label Casablanca Records is a ‘madhouse, piles of drugs, everyone was high at eleven in the morning’. Summer moves to the company newly founded by music mogul David Geffen, but she is soon dropped. ‘She Works Hard For The Money’ is another defiant hit for her. She later lives in Nashville and becomes a committed born-again Christian. Donna Summer deserves a place of honour in pop history’s hall of fame. The DJ and writer Hans Nieswandt rates ‘I Feel Love’ alongside ‘Autobahn’ by Kraftwerk as ‘the most modern song of the seventies’\n\nDECONSTRUCTING DAD- RAYMOND SCOTT\n\nDirected by Stan Warmow\n\n“ an enthralling film about pioneering composer and electronic-music pioneer Raymond Scott. Deconstructing Dad: The Music, Machines and Mystery of Raymond Scott tells the story of a truly pivotal figure in 20th-century music whose madly eclectic achievements remain largely obscure. Scott began in the '30s as a swing/big-band composer and conductor, later creating wonderfully weird scores for Hollywood films, cartoons and commercial jingles, and in the third act devoted his life to his first real love, audio technology. A musician-inventor like the more heralded Les Paul, Scott conceived and built literally dozens of electronic musical instruments. Many of his innovations were years ahead of their time, such as his best-known conception, the Electronium, an \"instantaneous composition and performance machine.\" An essential view inside the wonders of creative genius, American-style.”\n\nJohn Payne—LA Weekly\n\nQ&A with filmmaker Stan Warnow Friday June 21st at 2pm. Sign up and join in the conversation!\n\nDESOLATION CENTER\n\nDESOLATION CENTER is the previously untold story of a series of Reagan-era guerrilla music and art performance happenings in Southern California that are recognized to have paved the way for Burning Man, Lollapalooza and Coachella, collective experiences that have become crucial parts of alternative culture in the 21st century. The feature documentary splices interviews and rare performance footage of Sonic Youth, Minutemen, Meat Puppets, Swans, Redd Kross, Einstürzende Neubauten, Survival Research Laboratories, Savage Republic and more, documenting a time when pushing the boundaries of music, art, and performance felt like an unspoken obligation.\n\nDirected by Stuart Swezey, the creator and principal organizer of the events, DESOLATION CENTER demonstrates how the risky, and at times even reckless, actions of a few outsiders can unintentionally lead to seismic cultural shifts. Combining Swezey’s exclusive access to never-before-seen archival video, live audio recordings, and stills woven together with new cinematically shot interviews, verité footage and animated sequences, DESOLATION CENTER captures the spirit of the turbulent times from which these events emerged. The timeless power of DIY—do-it-yourself culture—is a recurrent theme throughout the film, spotlighting the true diversity of LA's early punk scene, where alienated young people—white, Latino, black, Asian, LGBTQ—joined together against the militarized police repression of the Reagan-era LAPD that was the backdrop of the film’s events. More than just the story of a series of wild and unorthodox happenings, DESOLATION CENTER holds true the spirit of freedom and possibility that Punk and its clarion call of creative deconstruction embodied.\n\nLIVE STREAM Q+A WITH FILMAKERS STUART SWEZEY AND MARISKA LEYSSIUS AND EDITOR TYLER HUBBY\n\nJANGLING MAN\n\nDirected by James Sharp\n\nJangling Man is the story of UK-based artist, poet, and Cleaners from Venus frontman Martin Newell.\n\nRegarded by many as an influential figure in the history of cassette culture and DIY recording, Newell has been an integral part of the British music scene since the 1970s, and his music career spans over six decades. He’s been produced by XTC’s Andy Partridge, andwritten for the likes of Captain Sensible of The Damned. Though it would be wrong to call him an \"unknown\", he has never been directly in the limelight. This film brings to light the amazing career and life work of the artist, who, on top of being the mostpublished contemporary British poet as well as an established gardener, continues to record and release music today. Directed and produced by James Sharp and co-produced and edited by Jim Larson, featuring interviews with Mac DeMarco, XTC’s Dave Gregory, DIIV’s Zachary Cole Smith, Cherry Red’s Iain McNay, Wild Nothing’s Jack Tatum, and more\n\nJOBRIATH A.D.\n\nDirected by Kieran Turner\n\nis a 2012 American biographical documentary film written, produced and directed by Kieran Turner. The documentary details the rise and fall of the first openly gay rock star Jobriath. The film features commentary by Jerry Brandt, Joe Elliott, Marc Almond, Dennis Christopher, Will Sheff, Justin Tranter, Kristian Hoffman, and Ann Magnuson, and is narrated by Henry Rollins. Jobriath appears in archival footage.\n\nThe film tells the story of Jobriath, known as the first openly gay rock star.] It begins when Jobriath was a member of the Los Angeles cast of Hair, where he played the role of Woof. The documentary then moves to New York where Jobriath has re-located and highlights his time with a band called Pidgeon, which quickly disbanded after one album. He then meets talent manager and promoter Jerry Brandt. After hearing some of his music, Brandt becomes his manager and gets him a record deal, reportedly worth $500,000 with Elektra Records. Brandt then starts a massive publicity campaign promoting Jobriath, in New York City and abroad in London and Paris, before anyone had even heard any of his music. Meanwhile, in interviews with the media, Jobriath is introducing himself to the world as \"the true fairy of rock 'n' roll\". After the release of two albums, his career never takes off, the gay community has shunned him for being too flamboyant and in your face gay, and music critics have basically dismissed him. He leaves the music business and returns to his mother's house for a brief period before moving back to New York where he re-invents himself as Cole Berlin, a cabaret act, performing gigs at piano bars. Shortly thereafter, he dies from AIDS in 1983.\n\nQ&A with filmmaker Keiran Turner Thursday June 27th at 12pm PST.

He went on to discover a young Bob Marley and gained international recognition as a solo artist and record producer, working with pioneering artists like the Heptones and the Congos. Soon he was being called upon by artists as diverse as The Clash and Paul McCartney to provide his unique sound. Narrated by Benicio Del Toro, the film captures the essence of a complex, enigmatic figure who was at once a mad genius and a mystic.\n\nBETTER THAN SOMETHING- JAY REATARD\n\nDirected by Alex Hammond and Ian Markiewicz\n\nFor Jimmy Lee Lindsay, known to his fans and detractors as Jay Reatard, life was a race against time. After growing up fast among Memphis crack addicts, he managed to blaze a path through the rough-and-tumble underground rock scene of the early aughts, releasing over 100 singles, EPs and full-length records in fourteen years. Then on January 13, 2010, not yet 30, he died.\n\nWith their feature documentary Better Than Something, filmmakers Alex Hammond and Ian Markiewicz let Jay tell his own story: a poverty-stricken childhood, teen years spent as a two-fisted tunesmith battling fans and band mates alike, and a short-lived adulthood of focused and relentless productivity.\n\nJay said \"I just try to make as much as I can with the time that I have.\" By any measure, that is exactly what he did. Better Than Something is both a testament to Jay Reatard's indisputable legacy and a tribute to his vital, thrilling, and all-too-brief life.\n\nQ&A with filmmakers Alex Hammond and Ian Markiewicz Thursday June 26th at 1pm PST .

In the '70s, built on the rhythms of the James Brown's JBs band, gospel and doo wop vocal harmonies, psychedelic and sci fi imagery, raw sexuality, and a dose of hippie spirit, Funk was music made by bands that jammed together. In the '80s its evolution computers and drum machines pushed Funk forward.\n\nIn Finding the Funk many of the key figures (Sly Stone, George Clinton, Boots Collins, Nona Hendrix, Bernie Worrell, Steve Arrington, Maceo Parker, Diamond of the Ohio Players, Mtume) and those they influenced (Shock G, D'Angelo, Mike D, Arthur Baker, Shelia E) tell the story. Amir 'Questlove' Thompson narrates the film and adds his own insights into the music.\n\nFinding the Funk is written and directed by Nelson George, author of critically acclaimed books on black music (Where Did Our Love Go, The Death of Rhythm and Blues, Hip Hop America) and director of documentaries on Misty Copeland (A Ballerina's Tale), baseball legend Willie Mays (Say Hey Willie Mays!), and Michael Jackson (Thriller 40.)

My brother read the article, and said, \"Right now, the Accolade is the greatest rock band in the world.\" Popular music—be it rock 'n roll, punk rock, heavy metal or hip hop, particularly in their initial introductions into the scene—represents an explicit challenge to authority. When parents, teachers, politicians, and mullahs proclaim this music is \"dangerous,\" they aren't wrong. It is dangerous. It is a threat to their conformist authoritarian status quo. Music is a form of self-expression, and self-expression, once unleashed, can't be silenced, not without a fight. The Accolade had released only one or two singles through their MySpace page, but an entire culture amassed against them, and in their persistence and courage they represented the spirit of rock in almost its Platonic ideal. And so, too, do Slave to Sirens, an all-female thrash metal band based in Lebanon, and the focus of Rita Baghdadi's engaging documentary \"Sirens.\"\n\nOTHER MUSIC\n\nIn the summer of 2016, New York City lost a beloved and influential hub of independent music culture. Other Music--located on East 4th Street between Broadway and Lafayette in the heart of Manhattan's East Village neighborhood--was more than just a store that sold CDs, records, tapes and magazines. It was a place where bands were formed, record labels were born and careers were launched. And it was THE place where a generation of New Yorkers at the dawn of the Internet age went to discover groundbreaking music by artists who would go on to become household names and underground icons: Animal Collective, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Vampire Weekend, the National, Interpol, TV On The Radio, Regina Spektor, William Basinski and countless others.\n\nWith more and more record stores, book stores and video stores closing everywhere, the communities that have built up around shops like Other Music are slowly dissipating and migrating to online forums. Nowadays most people are streaming music online rather than purchasing it digitally to download, much less going to stores to buy physical media. As the music industry continues to move in that direction and community hubs like Other Music struggle to remain in existence, we think it is important to celebrate what spaces like these have meant to people in the past-- and how their spirit can live on in an increasingly digital world.\n\nGOOD OL’ FREDA\n\nDirected by Ryan White\n\nFreda Kelly was just a shy Liverpudlian teenager when she was asked to work for a local band hoping to make it big. Though she had no concept of how far they would go, Freda had faith in The Beatles from the beginning, and The Beatles had faith in her.\n\nHistory notes that The Beatles were together for 10 years, but Freda worked for them for 11. Many people came in and out of the band's circle as they grew to international stardom, but Freda remained a staple because of her unfaltering loyalty and dedication. As the Beatles' devoted secretary and friend, Freda was there as history unfolded; she was witness to the evolution – advances and setbacks, breakthroughs and challenges – of the greatest band in history.\n\nIn GOOD OL’ FREDA, Freda tells her stories for the first time in 50 years. One of few films with the support of the living Beatles and featuring original Beatles music, the film offers an insider perspective on the beloved band that changed the music industry.\n\nQ&A with filmmaker Ryan White Wednesday June 26th at 11am PST.
