We appreciate hearing from you! Sharing a lovely message from Alice and Leonard Maltin. \"Hi David… Alice and I have never taken our High Holy Day services for granted. We know how fortunate we are to have a rabbi like you, who conducts such a warm, inclusive service, filled with music, and even humor. When you arranged for us to attend Kol Nidre services during our trip to Austin, Texas last week you inadvertently set us up to make a comparison. There was nothing wrong with rabbis or the cantor in Austin… but the service was routine and not involving, performed by rote. You and your services have spoiled us. We feel so lucky to have you in our lives. All good wishes for a happy and healthy new year! P.S. As a longtime SAG-AFTRA member, I was proud that our congregation opened its doors to the guild.\"\n\nHelp Our Temple Grow\n\nOur Membership is now open\n\nYou are invited to experience the High Holy Days in our beautiful Art Deco temple for no additional cost.

Many of the brave souls killed yesterday were reservists who left behind families, children, and dreams, to answer the call of duty with courage. They made the ultimate sacrifice fighting for their country, for the safety of their loved ones, and for humanity. In their selflessness, they gave their lives so that we may continue to live in a civilized world with peace and freedom. As this war takes a painful and heavy toll, FIDF honors the memories of these most noble individuals. We extend our deepest support to the grieving families, knowing that no words can adequately express the pain they endure. May they take comfort in the heroic legacies of their brave loved ones, and may their memories forever be a blessing. These tragic moments unite us and further propel us in our work to care for the young men and women of the IDF and their families who sacrifice everything on our behalf. On the front lines of humanity, we will prevail. Am Yisrael Chai. Forever.\n\nSHABBAT DINNER AND SERVICE held last November 17, 2023 Honoring the IDF along with our Mensch Awardees\n\nThe 2023 Mensch Awards/Shabbat Celebration were held on Nov 17; under the Joyce and Stanley Black Rotunda; housed in the beautifully renovated Barry and Rina Plost Lobby.\n\nCantors Ilysia Pierce and Nathan Lam, Music Director Sharon Farber, and former Temple President Jim Blatt were all honorees.\n\nRabbi David Baron and Elizabeth Frawley visited our Temple of the Arts campus of the Le Petit Gan preschool and its Director, Sophie.\n\nOur Rabbi with WITH IAC CEO Elan Carr at Israel solidarity rally for the hostages at our Temple's Saban Theatre attended by a full house of 2,000.\n\nThank you for joining us for an evening of music, inspiration and world-class musical performance under the stars with iPalpiti Artists International and Liberate Art, in association with Jewish National Fund-USA.\n\nALL proceeds benefitted 3500 Israeli residents in the Halutza region who live on the Southern Gaza border and who have suffered many casualties and have had many people from their community relocated.\n\nThank you so much for helping them rebuild their lives.\n\nSTAND WITH ISRAEL\n\nWAR IN ISRAEL: What is going on right now? - Urgent video update from StandWithUs in Israel.\n\nWe, the members of the clergy team of our Temple of the Arts, stand united with Israel during this time of the horrific attacks which have taken place throughout our beloved state of Israel.\n\nWe offer our prayers and commit ourselves to do everything necessary to support the citizens and the military of Israel.

I urge you to read the link below and stand together in one voice to condemn the barbarous regime of the mullahs. Let’s make our voices heard loudly to our elected representatives many of whom sadly seek US reentry into the failed agreement that emboldened this vicious regime and funded terrorism around the world. Last year at Yom Kippur, the brave protest leader Masih Alinejad spoke passionately at our service on the plight of those who protest against the regime. Her words were haunting and if you have been following the news you know that the mullahs sent out kidnap/hit squads against her just as we learned of the horrific attack against author Salman Rushdie. These events took place in our own country which gives you an idea of the lengths to which this murderous regime will go. I urge you to support the organization listed on the link or the World Jewish Congress, an organization that is making significant efforts to help those protesting in Iran.\n\nLet our voices be heard as one as we offer a special prayer for those who bravely protest. Let’s also reach out to women's rights and human rights organizations we have supported to become engaged in this effort. Thank you, Rabbi David Baron\n\nIran Regime, the World Record Holder in Executions of Women READ THE FULL ARTICLE HERE\n\nAbout the Temple\n\nTemple of the Arts owns and operates the historic art-deco Saban Theatre in Beverly Hills.
