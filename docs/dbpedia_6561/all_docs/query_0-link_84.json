The biography, which was published to mark the leader's 19th year as the terror outfit's supreme leader, said that the leader was \"affable\" and never considered himself superior to his colleagues, reported the BBC.

The biography, which was published to mark the leader's 19th year as the terror outfit's supreme leader, said that the leader was \"affable\" and never considered himself superior to his colleagues, reported the BBC. While clarifying disputed facts about his birth and upbringing, the 5,000-word biography claimed that the leader led a simple life. It listed the RPG 7 as his favourite weapon and said that the emir remained in touch with day-to-day Afghan and world events. The United States has announced a bounty of 10 million dollars on Mullah Omar, who has not been seen anywhere since U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. Analysts said that the publication of the biography by the militant group may be an attempt to counter the growing influence of Islamic State in Afghanistan. (ANI)"
