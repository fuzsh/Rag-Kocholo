Thanks also to Laura Booth for her stalwart editorial work. The research for this book has brought together material that I’ve been thinking about and working on for many years, and has therefore drawn on many different libraries and collections. However, the British Film Institute’s (BFI’s) library and its Special Collections have been absolutely invaluable and instrumental to the project, for which I would like to say a particular thank you. I have made particular use of the library’s press cuttings files, which are hugely useful sources but that do not always contain author, title, or page number information – hence their absence in some of the references to follow (as indicated). Neil Sinyard and Su Holmes have read sections of this book in draft form and it was hugely helpful to have their perceptive advice on a range of issues, so my heartfelt thanks go to them. My colleagues at the University of East Anglia (UEA) continue to be wonderfully sympathetic and intellectually stimulating company; extra special thanks go to Eylem Atakav, Richard Famer, Mark Fryers, Sarah Godfrey, Sarah Hill, Su Holmes again, Sarah Ralph, and Tim Snelson for enabling me to talk, sometimes at great length, about different aspects of this book and always being interested, or at least feigning interest very plausibly. The same goes for all the other friends and colleagues further afield who’ve done likewise over the years. Special thanks also to my work neighbours Rayna Denison and Mark Rimmer for putting up with my intermittent swearing. The University of East Anglia allowed this book to come into being by granting me a period of leave and offering other forms of support for the research and writing, for which much thanks, particularly to Keith Johnston and Mark Jancovich as Research Director and Head of School during the period in question. Thanks also to Sheldon Hall for doing some very helpful ­scanning from his extensive periodical collection. Some elements of Chapter 5 first appeared in ‘Staccato and ­wrenchingly\n\nviii\n\nf e mal e s t a r s o f b r i t i s h c i n e m a\n\nmodern: Reflections on the 1970s stardom of Glenda Jackson’, in Paul Newland (ed.), Don’t Look Now: British Cinema in the 1970s (Bristol: Intellect Press, 2010). Elements of chapter seven appeared in ‘The best exotic graceful ager: Dame Judi Dench and older female celebrity’, in Deborah Jermyn and Su Holmes (eds), Women, Celebrity and Cultures of Ageing: Freeze Frame (London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2015). I’m grateful to be able to draw on that work here. The final piece of the jigsaw was Chapter 4 on Rita Tushingham and the 1960s, research for which was supported by the Arts and Humanities Research Council and constitutes part of ‘Transformation and Tradition in Sixties British Cinema: Production Cultures, Cross Media Relations and National Branding’, a research project based at the Universities of York and East Anglia (grant number AH/L014793/1). Finally, on to the most important acknowledgements of all. Matthew Bailey, my husband, has been his usual amazing self: encouraging and supportive, endlessly thoughtful, providing me with those most precious commodities of all: time and space. It couldn’t have been done without him, not least because he read the whole thing and helped me make sense of it. And although it’s been great fun spending time with Jean, Diana, Rita, Glenda, Helena, Emily, Judi, and all the other remarkable women covered in this book, they have kept me at work late on numerous occasions and it’s always been good to get back home to my own little star Lara Bailey. My final thanks must go to both Matthew and Lara for their love, kindness, and fun, all of which kept me going.\n\nC H A PT E R 1\n\nIntroduction: Questions of Female Stardom in British Cinema\n\nThis book presents a diachronic study of female stardom in British cinema from the 1940s to the present day, examining its discursive construction by means of detailed case studies of seven specific stars whose careers collectively span the period: Jean Kent, Diana Dors, Rita Tushingham, Glenda Jackson, Helena Bonham Carter, Emily Lloyd, and Judi Dench. As the book’s subtitle suggests, these stars figure as its central ‘women in question’, borrowing the phrase from the film The Woman in Question (1950) that presented five different versions of the same woman (all played by Jean Kent) as seen through the eyes of five different people. Here the careers and personae of seven different women are used to provide multiple perspectives on the single, but multivalent, phenomenon of British female stardom. Founding star studies scholar Richard Dyer claimed that stars function as ‘embodiments of the social categories in which people are placed and through which they have to make sense of their lives . . . all of these typical, common ideas, that have the feeling of being the air that you breathe, just the way things are’.1 Two examples of these ‘common-sense’ social categories described by Dyer are gender and nationality, and these are the two identity groupings that form this book’s investigative parameters. It focuses on stars who are both British and female, and what it means when those two identities intersect in a star persona (while also engaging with their interaction with numerous other social categorisations, including ethnicity, class, regional identity, sexuality, and age). In undertaking this particular project, I build upon previous academic scholarship on British stardom, most notably Bruce Babington’s excellent essay collection British Stars and Stardom: From Alma Taylor to Sean Connery and Geoffrey Macnab’s insightful monograph Searching for Stars: Screen Acting and Stardom in British Cinema, both of which paid equal attention to female and male stars, with Babington’s book covering the entire twentieth century while Macnab focused more ­specifically on\n\n2\n\nf e mal e s t a r s o f b r i t i s h c i n e m a\n\nthe British film industry’s initial sixty years of existence.2 Both books did essential groundwork in setting out the ways in which British modes of stardom may differ from, and indeed define themselves against, Hollywood’s modus operandi.3 In addition, Sue Harper’s indefatigable overview Women in British Cinema: Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know has also been an essential reference point for my work here, particularly the first section of Harper’s book that explores the full range of women’s screen representation in British cinema from the 1930s to the 1980s, including its female stars (Andrew Spicer’s book Typical Men: The Representation of Masculinity in Popular British Cinema performs a parallel function in providing a history of male typology).4 What I am doing in this book both complements and supplements these previous analyses of British stardom and intervenes in debates on British film stardom in three specific ways. First, by focusing exclusively on the operations of female film stardom in the British context, I show both its centrality to the national film culture and examine its gendered specificities and how it operates in slightly different ways from the construction of British male stardom. Second, I extend the analysis of female stardom beyond the 1990s into the present day, thus making an important contribution to understanding of contemporary British film stardom. Third, rather than present an overview, I have chosen to base my study on very detailed analyses of a selected number of stars, finding in the microcosms of their individual careers a macrocosm of how British cinema stardom has functioned in relation to women. Although this book has seven ‘women in question’ rather than being a ‘single-star case study’, I hope that it possesses some of the virtues of that single-star approach that, as Lisa Downing and Sue Harris suggest (writing on Catherine Deneuve), provides a really good model for understanding in detail ‘the developments, breaks and lines of continuity that constitute [the star’s] image over the course of a career’.5 In the course of its contextualising introduction, six case study chapters and a conclusion that deals with the issue of whiteness and British female stardom, this book will explore and investigate the variety of British star femininities that have captured the public imagination over the last seventy-five years or so, while also acknowledging and interrogating some of the omissions and absences from that firmament.\n\n­\n\nfemal e s t a r do m in b r itis h c i n e m a 3\n\nBritish Film Stars ‘Female, Assorted, Innumerable’: Contexts and Parameters BUT IS THERE NO STAR MATERIAL IN ENGLAND? WHERE IS OUR STAR – OUR VERY OWN STAR? DOES SHE RUN A LIFT LIKE DOROTHY LAMOUR USED TO – THEN SHE SHOULD GO AND PESTER A FILM PRODUCER RIGHT AWAY IF SHE’S AS DYNAMIC. HAS A TALENT SCOUT MISSED THE PARTICULAR REP COMPANY SHE IS IN? BUT WHERE IS SHE? – WE OUGHT TO TRY AND FIND HER.6\n\nIt seems that female stardom has always presented problems for British cinema: finding stars, knowing what to do with them, keeping them. As this impassioned closing plea from an article in Picturegoer in 1945 quoted above -- made more so by being printed entirely in uppercase lettering – makes clear, the impulse to identify ‘our very own [female] star’ has at times been seen as a matter of utmost urgency, even desperation. The idea conveyed in this article that there may be a perfect star out there whose discovery can galvanise an ailing industry is a powerful and recurring one, as we shall see. But while this article suggested that British cinema just needed ‘to find a star’ (the title of the article), other commentators implied that the problem was not a lack of star potential among British actresses but rather with the domestic cinema’s inability to make proper use of the female talent at its disposal. Nothing illustrates that more effectively than Sue Harper’s discovery that when the Associated British Picture Corporation (ABPC) had Audrey Hepburn under contract in the early 1950s, they seriously considered a Gracie Fields biopic to be a suitable potential vehicle for her, completely misreading what she had to offer as a star.7 William Wyler and Paramount laboured under no such delusion, knew that she was a princess-in-waiting rather than a galumphing music hall entertainer, cast her in Roman Holiday (1953), and the rest was (Hollywood) history. This Hepburn anecdote seems to bear out what Christine Geraghty has also noted, which is how ‘British cinema even in its most successful or innovative periods has often been seen as a difficult place for an actress’.8 One actress, Anne Crawford, even went so far as to describe the domestic industry as ‘afraid of women’ in 1949, and actively hostile to them whatever they did: ‘If they find one with a mind of her own they label her “temperamental”. When we try the big-eyed, clinging vine technique they call us “dumb”. They get embarrassed if we wear something sensational.’9 This discomfort with the feminine is inextricably linked to a sense that British cinema is far more at ease with masculine stories and imagery. Kenneth Tynan’s observation on Ealing’s post-war output being all about ‘men at\n\n4\n\nf e mal e s t a r s o f b r i t i s h c i n e m a\n\nwork, men engrossed in a crisis, men who communicate with their women mainly by postcard’ has a far wider applicability to British cinema than that period or studio alone.10 From The Dam Busters (1955) to Zulu (1964), Withnail and I (1987) to Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998), to name just a few generically diverse examples, British cinema’s recurrent recourse to male-dominated homosocial narratives throughout its history is striking. And what has been its knock-on effect for British female stars? According to Raymond Durgnat, it has resulted in a climate in which ‘starlets, female, assorted, innumerable’ have experienced ‘extraordinary difficulty’ in forging star careers.11 Sometimes they have been accused of underperforming: ‘Why British girls fail to – Our men famous, but women disappoint’, reported the Daily Mirror in 1934, which surmised that ‘the non-success of the English girl’ in films was because she was ‘afraid to “let herself go” ’.12 Alternatively they have been burdened with impossibly high expectations, as when starlet Anne Heywood was placed on the Daily Express’s ‘star-o-meter’ in 1957 to see whether she could match the ‘sex appeal’ of Marilyn Monroe, ‘personality’ of Audrey Hepburn, ‘acting ability’ of Carroll Baker, ‘determination’ of Diana Dors, ‘poise’ of Grace Kelly, ‘experience’ of Susan Hayward and ‘intelligence’ of Deborah Kerr – not asking too much of her then.13 Arguably, the problem in developing female stars was not solely determined by gender but had more to do with a deep-seated antipathy towards the whole business of movie stardom – a certain incompatibility between ‘British’ and ‘stardom’, to adapt Truffaut’s famous phrase, noted by both Macnab and Babington. While 1909 saw the emergence of the ‘picture personality’ in America, later to become upgraded to the Hollywood film star, in Britain the story developed along different lines.14 Theatrical prowess was understood as the true marker of performative skill, and cinema both borrowed and was cowed by its prestige: Jon Burrows notes the ‘overdetermined fashion’ in which theatre stars dominated early cinema.15 Of course, the convenience of proximity had a lot to do with British theatre and film’s especially intimate interconnectivity, with Macnab pointing out that while Hollywood and Broadway are ‘a little over 3000 miles’ apart from ‘Pinewood or Elstree to London’s West End is only half an hour’s travel by car or train’.16 But beyond simple geographical fact, deeper prejudices and snobberies about a newer medium were also at work and endured for a long time thereafter. Even as late as 1995, journalist John Heilpurn noted how ‘sooner or later in Britain, everything comes back to theatre . . . The British are stage actors first, and last.’17 The theatre was also seen as a better bet for maintaining actorly range, something prized far higher than building a consistent movie-star image, with pioneering British director\n\n­\n\nfemal e s t a r do m in b r itis h c i n e m a 5\n\nMaurice Elvey even suggesting in 1920 that the very ‘process of starring’ was also ‘the process of cramping’ an actor’s development.18 Furthermore, film stardom was seen to entail an undue amount of self-disclosure that went against the grain of a national culture uneasy with the ‘vulgarity of self-display’.19 This fatally inhibited the development of an effective publicity machine to make nascent stars knowable as off-screen personalities as well as on-screen performers: emblematic here is Celia Johnson’s insistence on personal modesty, quoted by Babington: ’One doesn’t talk about oneself, does one?’20 The abiding impression of British cinema’s relationship with stardom is one of deep ambivalence. There is a perfect demonstration of this in two articles, both published in 1943 in Picturegoer and both authored by Lionel Collier. The first, from February of that year, asks, ‘Must we have stars?’ and goes on to express disdain for Hollywood’s garish display: ‘Well, do we really want to follow the American star system? Commercially, no doubt, it has been a great success. It is amazing what tripe you can put an accepted star in and get away with it.’21 But the second, from October, represents a total volte-face as Collier asks, ‘Are we making our own stars at last?’, delighting in the fact that ‘real strides are being made to further hitherto little-known talent’.22 Collier’s completely self-contradictory position on stardom sums up what Sarah Street later described as Britain’s ‘fascination and admiration for Hollywood’s success in building stars’ being counterbalanced by its equally ‘profound desire to distance itself from the concomitant dangers of industrial commodification’ that Hollywood’s star system represented.23 This sense of contradiction is evident at the very heart of British constructions of stardom. On the one hand, a distinctive ‘anti-star inflection’ often manifests itself. Babington senses it in the self-effacing, impersonatory, un-starry performances of male actors such as Alec Guinness, Peter Sellers, and Gary Oldman (and one can add to his list the more recent example of Michael Sheen).24 Christine Geraghty discerns something similar in the attempts made by a range of British actresses to slough off or deny stardom, from Margaret Lockwood making clear her preference for ‘acting as opposed to starring in’ a film to Julie Christie describing her battle against ‘the whole apparatus’ of stardom.25 But, on the other hand, the institutions of British cinema have never simply rejected stardom and all its works and it has been ardently longed for as much as it has been repudiated. There has always been a deep-seated longing for ‘homegrown stars’ who, as Sarah Street points out, can be ‘invested with a patriotic imperative as bearers of British national culture’.26 This longing for British stars of world-beating brilliance goes back a long way: back in\n\n6\n\nf e mal e s t a r s o f b r i t i s h c i n e m a\n\n1917, one film magazine’s question, ‘Is there an English Mary Pickford?’, instigated a year-long debate on its letters page about who might be worthy of being spoken of in the same breath as the colossally popular American star and perhaps even able to rival her.27 The same kind of discourses were still in full effect on the cover of the Radio Times on 11 May 1996, which was devoted to a composite image of Kate Winslet, Liz Hurley, and Emma Thompson, and was accompanied by an inside story on ‘Our girls in Hollywood’ and whether they were now challenging American stars for supremacy. The British public are especially encouraged to invest and revel in home-grown stars’ international award successes, particular Oscar wins, something that Babington reads as symptomatic of the deeply held ‘desire for British primacy’ in film.28 While Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet may have been amenable to being co-opted into an award-winning British actorly tradition, someone like Liz Hurley was slightly harder to place on that continuum, being known far more for her alluring appearance than her acting abilities. Hurley’s incongruity in that company points to British cinema’s frequent difficulty in accommodating glamour, which obviously overlaps with its overall ambivalence to movie stardom (which was seen to promote glamour at the expense of talent) and this has had particular consequences for the place of female stars in British cinema. Glamour is a competitive arena in which Hollywood’s female stars have generally been deemed to ‘win’, as Geraghty puts it.29 Jack Davies noted in the 1950s that while British screenwriters were ‘splendid’ at ‘funny old ladies’ or ‘comedy schoolmistresses’, their typewriters ‘seem[ed] to develop mechanical trouble’ whenever they tried to create ‘smart, sophisticated women’.30 But another writer made a case for actress Margaret Leighton as an exemplar of a very British form of glamour, rather more classy than the gaudy norm: ‘The word glamour may not seem entirely appropriate to describe Miss Leighton’s kind of attraction, but that is because the word has been vulgarised by its attachment to bobbysoxers’ idols.’31 A slight variation on this position of simultaneous boastfulness and defensiveness is to suggest that British actresses represent ‘natural’ beauty rather than the derogated currency of ‘artificial’ glamour, that ‘British girls, it seems, have still got something everyone wants – even if it isn’t the canned stuff that has been dished up to us as “glamour” ’.32 This line of argument stretches all the way from the dismissal of Mae West’s ‘extravagant make-up’ and ‘conventional, stiff waves’ back in 1934 in favour of ‘English beauty’ right through to the comparison of Sharon Stone’s ‘brassiness’ with the ‘fine-boned delicacy’ of Julia Ormond in 1996.33 If one sought a good example of how some of the tensions around\n\n­\n\nfemal e s t a r do m in b r itis h c i n e m a 7\n\nFigure 1.1 ‘English roses in Tinseltown’: Kate Winslet, Elizabeth Hurley, and Emma Thompson on the cover of Radio Times, 11 May 1996.\n\nstardom and glamour and British femininity coalesced then one could hardly improve on the moment of British star Ann Todd’s entry into Hollywood in the late 1940s. Todd had gained an international profile through the huge success of her film The Seventh Veil (1945), and her\n\n8\n\nf e mal e s t a r s o f b r i t i s h c i n e m a\n\ncoolly enigmatic allure seemed to answer the need voiced by one reader of Pictureoger for ‘glamour and lots of it’ in British films, because for ‘an austerity-sick audience, it is very welcome’.34 It looked like she may be able to crack America too, which, as Picture Post argued, would be a real fillip to Britain’s overseas profile: in order to combat that fact that Britain ‘export[ed] some ninety million precious dollars yearly to pay for the pleasure of seeing American feature pictures alone’ while ‘our returns on the showing of British pictures in the dollar regions are derisory’, we needed to build up and export more ‘lovely, melting stars’ like Todd.35 The actress duly went to Hollywood and appeared as a cool blonde in Hitchcock’s The Paradine Case (1947) and a Victorian femme fatale in So Evil My Love (1948) and described how her regal reception upon arrival differed significantly from the diffident treatment she was used to: ‘Over there you’re Miss Todd, the new British star, and you’re made to feel as if you’re the only star, the only person who matters, a queen arriving to meet her subjects.’36 But Todd also argued that British restrictions on overseas currency prevented her from doing her job properly: Our limited allowance is not enough for British stars to live on as they should live, in a place where things are judged by their face value and personal prestige means so much. The British industry is looked down upon because of this . . . as a visiting poor relation, whereas we should be ambassadors, said Miss Todd.37\n\nShe hammered home the point by wearing an ermine fur borrowed from Hollywood star Loretta Young to a film premiere in April 1947, and admitting as much: ‘It’s sad but we haven’t the dollars to buy furs here. They were shocked that any star could say such a thing’, commented Todd to a reporter, conveying the issue of British penury but also a certain amount of inverted snobbery in flouting the usual American star proprieties. 38 Todd’s borrowed fur was worn over a silk evening gown, which she said was ‘made from the parachute my husband used on D-Day’.39 Her choice of dress for the premiere connoted both impecuniousness, as a recycled piece of clothing made from repurposed military equipment, but also a powerful sense of national pride, with not only thrift but indomitable British courage and victory in war literally written across the star’s body, and then displayed within the Hollywood heartlands on Britain’s behalf. Ann Todd’s reported utterances and her eloquent outfit seem symptomatic of some of the contradictions at the heart of British female stardom – a compromised but proud glamour, a rejection of stardom’s excesses combined with an enjoyment of its prestige. Richard Dyer defined the power of stars in terms of their ability not only to represent different social categories but to ‘speak to dominant\n\n­\n\nfemal e s t a r do m in b r itis h c i n e m a 9\n\nFigure 1.2 A ‘lovely, melting star’: signed photograph of Ann Todd from a book of British and Hollywood star portraits, published by D. McKenzie, Glasgow, circa 1948.\n\n10\n\nf e mal e s t a r s o f b r i t i s h c i n e m a\n\ncontradictions in social life – experienced as conflicting demands, contrary expectations, irreconcilable but equally held values – in such a way as to appear to reconcile them’.40 In the persona of Ann Todd and many other British female stars, one can see how the ideological work of effecting ‘the dissolution of contraries, the embrace of wildly opposing terms’ is fully in evidence.41 Despite the high hopes pinned on someone like Todd, women stars have often been seen as of lesser importance in British cinema’s history and development. This can be seen in Films and Filming critic Richard Whitehall’s claim in 1963 that hardly any women had ‘ever counted for much at the box-office’, while those who had enjoyed significant success like Jessie Matthews, Phyllis Calvert, and Anna Neagle were dismissed as anodyne: ‘much of a muchness, all spiritually at home in South Kensington’.42 Inadvertently echoing this position decades later, albeit from a completely different direction, Jackie Stacey’s work on women’s memories of cinema-going in 1940s and 1950s Britain completely erased any mention of British female stars except as the (unspoken) binary opposite to Hollywood glamour.43 But this absence seems particularly strange given the huge box-office popularity of British stars during that time, with Anna Neagle, Phyllis Calvert, and Margaret Lockwood proving extraordinarily popular with British audiences, often more so than US stars, according to various popularity polls from the period run by trade journals such as Motion Picture Herald and Kinematograph Weekly.44 So powerful was their impact, images from their films even reverberated in the dreams of some spectators, with visions of Lockwood in The Man in Grey (1943) and Calvert in Madonna of the Seven Moons (1944) being cited in J. P. Mayer’s sociological research.45 Although a definite heyday for female British stars, the 1940s were by no means an isolated period in generating on-screen women that the British public admired. Decades earlier, silent star Alma Taylor had beaten the global megastar Charlie Chaplin into second place in a magazine poll to find the most popular British-born film actor in 1915.46 Cockney spitfire Betty Balfour, alliteratively dubbed ‘beautiful, British and best’ by Picture Show magazine in 1928, was a major box-office attraction of her era.47 And while Richard Whitehall mentioned in passing the very popular ‘dancing divinity’ of 1930s musicals, Jessie Matthews, he neglected to mention Gracie Fields as a very different but equally successful major musical star of the decade. Fields frequently outperformed her seductive foreign competitors in the domestic market, summed up in the statement of one Sunderland cinema proprietor: ‘Gracie was always a bigger draw than Garbo.’48 Gracie’s attractions may have more to do with gusto than\n\n­\n\nfemal e s t a r do m in b r itis h c i n e m a 11\n\nglamour, but British stars could also be figures of aspiration as well as homely familiarity. Margaret Lockwood was chosen to advertise beauty products like Lux soap and Drene shampoo to British female consumers on the basis of her huge fan following, while her beauty spot was imitated by women who drew them on with eyeliner pencil, according to some testimonies.49 Even today, certain British female stars are strongly coded as aspirational beauties, with Keira Knightley, Kate Winslet, Rachel Weisz, Emily Blunt, Helen Mirren, Emma Watson, and Gemma Arterton all fronting advertising campaigns for major cosmetics, skincare, fragrance, or fashion brands.50 British female stars have not only been very domestically popular at times, they have also enjoyed significant international success. Flying in the face of accusations that they lack star quality, they have often exerted a powerful allure for Hollywood producers and casting directors who have assigned them plum roles over their US competitors, from Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O’Hara in Gone with the Wind (1939) right through to Daisy Ridley as Rey in Star Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens (2015).51 Clearly there is another story to be told about British female stars, which is not about their inadequacy or marginality or absence but about their remarkable appeal and their notable box-office success in the face of a national film culture that has often regarded them and the feminine-focused stories in which they sometimes feature as ‘an unwelcome cuckoo-in-the-nest’.52 Rather than being negligible or ‘much of a muchness’, female British stars have been and still are a crucial component of the national film culture and of popular culture more broadly. Indeed, if we follow Raymond Durgnat in believing that ‘the social history of a nation can be written in terms of its film stars’, then their inclusion in the construction of that social history is vital for the insights they offer into women’s place in the national imaginary and the acutely gendered nature of Britain’s narrative of itself.53 The expectation that female British film stars will represent the nation and embody certain national and gendered virtues slots into a much longer cultural tradition of women being used to embody the nation. From Mother Russia or Britannia, to Marianne, the spirit of revolutionary France (whose statue was directly modelled on both Bardot and Deneuve in turn in the twentieth century, indicating just how closely yoked film stardom and national mythology can be), nation itself is often conceptualised as a feminine entity, as Susan Hayward points out: The woman’s body is closely aligned/identified with nationalist discourses. We fight and die for our mother-nation; the colonised referred to the colonising country as mother-country. When ‘she’ is invaded by the enemy, she is raped.54\n\n12\n\nf e mal e s t a r s o f b r i t i s h c i n e m a\n\nBut despite nationhood often being strongly gendered as feminine, the national status of actual women has conversely been much less clearly defined than men’s. As Alice Jane Mackay and Pat Thane point out in their work on the construction of the identity of the Englishwoman, women ‘had no fixed nationality. They were made to adopt that of their husband; on marriage to a foreigner they lost their English status’: it was no mere rhetorical flourish when Virginia Woolf announced that ‘as a woman I have no country’ in her 1938 work Three Guineas.55 Despite this, women were not exempted from patriotism but they were urged to express their allegiance to their country in an appropriately feminine fashion: Mackay and Thane contrast the Boy’s Own Paper telling its readership in 1879 that ‘your future efforts, boys’ would forge ‘a nation’s destiny’ with the contemporaneous equivalent publication for young women, the Girl’s Own Paper, counselling its readers that ‘the essence of girlhood is in spiritual qualities rather than in actions’, and that their primary role should be supporting men.56 By comparison, British imperialism, so crucial a component of national self-image throughout the nineteenth century and early twentieth, was predicated on masculinity to such an extent that the ‘core of the curriculum’ at the public schools that acted as the empire’s incubator ‘was masculinity’ itself.57 While ideas of national identity remained ‘pre-eminently masculine before the First World War’, according to the historian Alison Light, beyond this point there occurred a profound shift in which ‘the treacherous instability of former models of masculine power’ were revealed.58 Therefore, Light argues, the 1920s and 1930s ‘saw a move away from formerly heroic and officially masculine public rhetorics of national destiny . . . to an Englishness at once less imperial and more inward-looking, more domestic and more private’, in which ‘woman and the home’ were suddenly placed ‘at the centre of national life’.59 For all the abstract symbolic power of a Boadicea, Gloriana, or Queen Victoria, up to this point, the Englishwoman had been an ill-defined and ‘surprisingly illusive’ figure, according to Mackay and Thane, particularly in comparison with the much more clearly delineated Englishman.60 But in the interwar years, this previously inchoate female counterpart came into her own. One example of this was the ‘crisp commonsense’ femininity of Mrs Miniver, created in the late 1930s and then memorably rendered on film by Greer Garson in MGM’s morale-boosting 1942 film.61 Another was Laura Jesson as played by Celia Johnson in Brief Encounter (1945). For Light, the fact that Jesson, this ‘ordinary’ suburban middle-class married woman, could be read as a perfect exemplar of Englishness provided a powerful indication of just how far national mythology and imagery had shifted: as she suggests, the\n\n­\n\nfemal e s t a r do m in b r itis h c i n e m a 13 notion of finding its quintessence in ‘a housewife changing her library books and buying a new toothbrush would have seemed bizarre in 1914 and inconceivable in 1850’.62 This book’s chronological focus begins just at this point in British history when women were being granted a new representational significance in relation to nation, further intensified in propaganda encouraging their full participation in the war effort.63 The decision to span the seventy-five year period from 1940 to 2015 in this book’s analysis was partly a matter of editorial expediency but also because those years presented themselves as a discrete historical entity in which major change had occurred in British society, especially for women. From the upheaval of the Second World War and the long shadow it cast over the years that followed, to the renewed emphasis on domesticity in the fifties, from the advent of sixties ‘youthquake’ and seventies ‘Women’s Lib’ through to the first women Prime Minister at the end of that decade and the advent of post-feminist ‘girl power’ in the nineties, it is apparent how women’s social roles have been in a state of ongoing metamorphosis, even while certain elements of feminine identity seem to have remained stubbornly unchanged.64 While there has been a broadening acceptance of women’s lives not having to be defined exclusively by home and (heteronormative) family, these are still often presented, even now, as women’s highest and most noble callings. While avoiding any naïve sense that cinema straightforwardly ‘reflects’ reality, it is possible to trace those wider social and cultural developments through changing patterns of female stardom that mediated, responded to, and sometimes anticipated shifting expectations and ideals of femininity. Clearly film stars are not ‘typical’ women – indeed, their status as stars necessitates being singled out as ‘special’ – but they are still subject to the same kind of patriarchal strictures as their non-famous peers, and in fact those strictures are often amplified and intensified by the scrutiny that fame entails. This is abundantly clear from many of the misogynistic commentaries on female stars that I quote from in the chapters that follow. My admiration for the courage of these women in the face of the ideological obloquy to which they have been subjected, often but not always by a male commentariat, remains undimmed throughout this study. Their very particular stories, placed end to end, provide a ‘refracted’ view of the history of women in Britain from the 1940s to now, as seen through the ‘prism’ of film stardom.65 It is worth adding that the book’s periodisation also covers immense changes in the cultural position of cinema itself, from its mid-1940s peak as the primary medium of audio-visual entertainment and an essential leisure activity for a large proportion of the populace through a long\n\n14\n\nf e mal e s t a r s o f b r i t i s h c i n e m a\n\nprocess of decline and redevelopment before reaching its current position as an enduringly popular form of entertainment, but just one among many. Film stardom has also changed shape in accordance with this process of transformation, as we shall see. Contemporary British film stars, more than ever before, take their place in a complex intermedial celebrity landscape and, as Barry King argues, are compelled to be entrepreneurial and develop an ‘elastic’ persona to ‘cover all contingencies’.66 Indeed, their main platform in most cases is no longer their film work but a much more holistic idea of the self as multi-media ‘brand’, with social media playing an increasingly indispensable role in star labour. If one thing has intensified over the seventy-year period covered by this book, it is the level of scrutiny to which stars are subjected. While they had always been the object of gossip and debate, the advent of round-the-clock digital media coverage has upped the ante considerably. This not only entails being talked about and photographed but demands that the star (or their publicist) deftly manage their own online identity, and the analyses that follow attempt to take into account the effects of the changing shape of celebrity mediation over the decades. Two further essential points on the scope of this book and its case studies must be made. The first is the correlation of Englishness and Britishness in much of what has already been said and much of what follows. That ‘caps lock’ clamouring for a star quoted at the outset of this chapter says that it’s trying to find a star somewhere in ‘England’ but I think its scope is actually British and this is a typical oversight rather than a deliberate exclusion of Welsh, Scottish, or Northern Irish candidates. Rather, this kind of slippage reflects what Colls and Dodd describe as the problematic ‘Anglo-British tradition’, which makes Englishness the hegemonic identity of Britishness while confining other national identities within it to a ‘Celtic fringe’.67 Unsurprisingly, the same kind of Anglo-British hegemony has also operated within a British cinema industry ‘overwhelmingly English in its centres of production and ideological emphases’ and populated by what Babington refers to as mainly ‘anglicised’ stars.68 However, gender is a factor in this: although male stars such as Richard Burton, Stanley Baker, or Sean Connery have successfully forged images built on their Welsh or Scottish distinctiveness, it is difficult to think of female equivalents who have done the same, with Catherine Zeta-Jones and Kelly MacDonald perhaps coming closest (although they arguably achieved their international success through being able to disguise their accents when required – something Sean Connery’s never had to do).69 Likewise, it is interesting to note how Deborah Kerr’s Scottish origins were seldom emphasised and were overwritten instead with the hegemonic national identity of ‘English\n\n­\n\nfemal e s t a r do m in b r itis h c i n e m a 15\n\nRose’.70 The dominance of Englishness in the construction of British star femininity is reflected in this book by the fact that, without deliberate premeditation, all seven stars selected for analysis have ended up being English-British. The other common factor that links all seven of them is their shared whiteness. In addition, most of them are also either red-headed or blonde, the latter being ‘the most unambiguously white you can get’ in Richard Dyer’s estimation.71 British film stardom, both male and female, has always been overwhelmingly white in its constitution and still remains so, a problem that runs far deeper than a mere lack of opportunities for Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic (BAME) actors in British films, although this is certainly a factor. Rather it seems that whiteness is ‘hard-wired’ into many of British cinema’s ontological structures. In the case of BAME female representation, the strictures placed upon what kinds of femininity are prized and seen as worthy of elevation to star status appears to be crucial, and the ‘English rose’ category in which so many British female stars have been placed has traditionally been an ethnically exclusionary one. In addressing this issue, my concluding chapter moves beyond its star case studies to reflect instead on the grounds upon which it is decided who is a candidate for stardom in British cinema and who isn’t – in short, its longstanding and ongoing ‘unbearable whiteness of being’. While this chapter looks back over British cinema’s past, it also fixes its gaze on the prospect of a more ethnically diverse future for British female stardom in which BAME actresses can finally be accorded their rightful place.\n\nSources and Methods In my quest ‘to find a way of understanding the social significance of stars which fully respects the way they function as media texts’, the methods employed for my star analysis in this book follow the models pioneered by Richard Dyer which, as Sean Redmond and Su Holmes state: offered ambitious methodological tools for the analysis of stardom: an integrated model for mining the cultural significance of a star that involved textual and biographical analysis (assessing the ‘on- and off- screen’, ‘public and private’, ‘mediated and authentic’ life of the star); questions of pleasure and identification; and ideological and historical specificity. This synthetic approach enabled the meaning of the star to emerge out of the cultural world in which they signified.72\n\nOn that latter point, I am aware that, as Martin Shingler points out, analyses of how ‘a film star embodies or incarnates a particular set of social values or a specific and identifiable period within a culture’s history\n\n16\n\nf e mal e s t a r s o f b r i t i s h c i n e m a\n\nare invariably open to charges of reductionism and over-simplification’.73 I have attempted to avoid these limitations by offering analyses of my chosen stars’ personae that are fully attentive to their nuances and contradictions and envisaging each star as a refraction rather than simple reflection of their society’s mores and codes.74 I plan to delicately sidestep some of the complexities, deftly outlined by Shingler, of descriptive nomenclature within star studies, which has variously deployed ‘personality’, ‘persona’, and ‘image’ as interlocking and sometimes contradictory definitional terms.75 I will primarily use Dyer’s coinage of persona to cover the star’s total discursive production, encompassing on-screen characters and typology as well as the off-screen personality constructed through media coverage and fan talk of various kinds (the ‘real’ person who definitely exists or existed, and whose inner truth much of this material tantalisingly promises to disclose and reveal, ultimately remains unknowable). However, I also reserve the right to use terms such as ‘image’ or ‘type’ in my analysis wherever they feel appropriate and helpful. Another descriptive label carrying significant baggage is ‘celebrity’, and despite its often derogated status in opposition to ‘stardom’ (seen as more elevated and impressive), this concept is a vital point of orientation for this study. Alongside frameworks derived from star studies, I have also made use of ideas and approaches derived from the more methodologically interdisciplinary field of celebrity studies that draws on ‘media, television and cultural studies (as well as sports studies, popular music studies, work on digital culture and beyond)’ in order to take into account the broader permutations of what it means to be famous.76 I therefore conceptualise the fame of my chosen stars on a continuum of British celebrity femininity that goes beyond film stars to also encompass members of the royal family (whose entire purpose is to act as national figureheads), pop stars, sportswomen, stage or television actors, businesswomen, comediennes, politicians, television presenters, models, authors, YouTube stars, and others. Christine Gledhill’s suggestion in 1991 that ‘cinema still provides the ultimate confirmation of stardom’ no longer rings true in the 2010s, if indeed it ever did; most of the stars discussed in the chapters that follow worked in arenas beyond film, sometimes very extensively, on stage or on television or as recording artistes or writers or television presenters (or all five in the case of Diana Dors).77 My analysis accommodates their broader intermedial celebrity even if the common factor that draws them all together in this particular book is the fact that they have all been understood as British film stars at one point. The book’s primary research sources are magazine and newspaper coverage of stars, film reviews, trade press coverage, publicity, press books,\n\n­\n\nfemal e s t a r do m in b r itis h c i n e m a 17\n\nposters and other promotional materials, biographies, advertising campaigns for products endorsed by stars, sources generated by fan activities, and, since the 1990s, ever-accelerating online versions of all of the above. These have been read not only for the direct information they provide about particular stars but also for the indirect information they can offer on what Diane Negra calls the ‘broader, more nebulous patterns of popular feeling’ during any given period that feed into a star’s image and its reception, and that suggest possible reasons for their popularity at that particular moment in time.78 I have found some of the richest material for my study in newspaper coverage of stars, something that completely transformed as the British press became progressively more tabloidised, with the rise of ‘personality-based news’ by journalists like Donald Zec and Peter Evans and later Lynn Barber vital to this process.79 Film-focused magazines like Picturegoer, Photoplay, Empire, and Premiere, have also all been great sources of intense ‘star talk’. So too have more general interest men’s and women’s magazines, TV magazines, and the fashion and music presses. The discursive work around stars contained in all these publications, sometimes respectful in tone but sometimes more scurrilous and gossipy, continually plays with the idea of seeing ‘the real person’ behind the roles, adhering to the series of defining star oppositions set out by Dyer: public/ private, on-screen/off-screen, mediated/­authentic. Sometimes it appears that we hear the star’s voice verbatim, coming through in interview or other kinds of reported speech, but it is important to treat this as another element of their discursive construction rather than uniquely privileged access to the ‘true self ’ (even though it may be presented as such). These are not necessarily the star’s thoughts, although it is how their thoughts were being presented at a given moment. But at the same time I do not want to disregard totally what P. David Marshall calls ‘the work of active human agency’ that can be glimpsed in these utterances, and how stars’ confessions and disclosures, however circumscribed, can speak eloquently of their struggles for autonomy.80 These expressions of agency are arguably all the more important in thinking about stardom through the lens of gender, with female celebrities of various kinds often seen as particularly subject to commodification and manipulation, and being spoken for rather than being at liberty to speak for themselves. As I hope should become obvious from the chapters that follow, while I am primarily engaged in examining (from the standpoint of gender) how ‘a star image is made out of media texts’, to use Dyer’s phrase, I am also interested in what Barry King refers to as ‘stardom as a form of working’, and have been keen to uncover traces of star labour that are discernible from sources such as general and trade press coverage (Kine Weekly,\n\n18\n\nf e mal e s t a r s o f b r i t i s h c i n e m a\n\nMotion Picture Herald, and Variety have been crucial in that respect), publicity and marketing materials, and biographies.81 In the Hollywood context, Paul McDonald has made salient recommendations that star studies scholars should take a closer look at the talent agencies, personal managers, and publicists who ‘make, manage and control the capital of stardom’.82 That has been beyond the scope of my study here, except in passing references, but it is certainly the case that a thoroughgoing systematic account of British star practices covering the industrial mechanisms of how stars have been ‘discovered, developed, deployed, presented and evaluated within the film industry’ in Britain, mapping the contributions made by agents, publicists, and managers, would be a very welcome addition to existing scholarship on British cinema.83 In the meantime, this study aims to frame its stars as both ‘symbolic and economic entities’ and remain cognisant throughout of how they ‘operate as sources of capital for the film business’ – not merely textual constructions but industrial players and notional guarantors of profits.84 Material on audience and fan responses to British female stars has also been built into the chapters wherever available, from contemporaneous surveys, questionnaires, and polls, or letters to magazines and newspapers, to fan-club material if extant, and a more recent proliferation of material online in the shape of fansites and social media activity (although we cannot always infer a more general response to a particular star or film or performance from the views of a self-selected vocal minority, as is the case with all ardent fan-texts, whether digital or analogue). Finally, the films in which the stars appear are also an indispensable primary source for this study, providing examples of the star in action and motion, sometimes demonstrating what all the critics were raving about (or disapproving of) at the time, and offering an essential third dimension to any thoroughgoing consideration of film stardom. If stars can be understood as textual constructs, then one of the most important categories of text that contribute to that process of construction is the films, which are identified as their primary star output and expression. However, I must add that this book does not offer meticulously detailed scene-by-scene analysis of screen performance of the kind undertaken in other studies, not because it sees such work as unimportant but rather because to do it properly would require the word length of another book.85 While I agree that acting and other forms of screen performance have traditionally been neglected in Film Studies and sympathise with the attempts to remedy this with the turn towards probing micro-analysis of frames and sequences, it lies outside my remit here. The chapters that follow will occasionally alight upon a particularly telling moment of screen performance – a gesture,\n\n­\n\nfemal e s t a r do m in b r itis h c i n e m a 19\n\na look, or the way a particular line of dialogue is delivered – but their primary concern is with star personae as broader entities that incorporate but are not fully determined by what happens in the star’s films. Finally, although physical embodiment is crucial to star representation, this should not obscure the importance of sonic as well as visual dimensions in constructing a persona, a word that, as Shingler points out, actually means ‘through sound’.86 This all began with the transition to sound, which claimed victims in Britain just as it had in Hollywood. Mabel Poulton’s Cockney accent doomed her to oblivion but over-­ elocuted voices could prove just as problematic, as evident from the occasional hostility towards Jessie Matthews (born in Soho to a working-class family) on grounds of her bogus hyper-posh tones in the 1930s.87 Any account of British traditions of stardom is as much a story of voices as it is of faces and bodies. The speaking voices of British actresses have often been their primary national identifier and sometimes their most distinctive feature, from Joan Greenwood’s sexy, parodically plummy tones to the celebrated ‘sob-catch’ at the heart of Judi Dench’s voice, or the belllike clarity of Anna Neagle’s voice, evoked in David Thomson’s anecdote about hearing ‘a sweet voice boom “This is Anna Neagle speaking” ’ on a crossed telephone line and being ‘unnerved by such melody emitting from the technological maelstrom’.88 Despite the turn away from Received Pronunciation in the 1960s in favour of more diverse styles of speaking, the crucial association of class and voice never really went away. It was on account of her ‘brittle, upper-class, honeyed and moneyed tones’ even more than her ‘English rose’ looks that Helena Bonham Carter was judged ‘British, sir. British to the sweet little core’ when she first found fame in 1986.89\n\nChoosing the Women in Question In making my selection of star case studies, it was important to focus on figures who had not been extensively written about before but who deserved further scrutiny. In connection with that, I wanted to avoid writing about stars who had already been covered in academic work: one reason why there are no chapters on the aforementioned Lockwood, Neagle, or Calvert (in spite of their popularity), or Googie Withers, Virginia McKenna, Kay Kendall, Julie Christie, Ingrid Pitt, Mary Millington, Helen Mirren, Kate Winslet, or Tilda Swinton, despite each of them representing fascinating tendencies or moments in British cinema’s history from the 1940s to the present day.90 My inclusion of Diana Dors is the exception to this general rule, because she had already been written about by several scholars, but\n\n20\n\nf e mal e s t a r s o f b r i t i s h c i n e m a\n\nshe seemed too perfectly emblematic of the tensions around femininity, Britishness, and stardom to ignore in a book of this kind.91 I was keen to explore figures who were in some way representative of or of central relevance to particular moments in British film history: forties melodrama (Jean Kent), the sex-symbol craze of the fifties (Diana Dors), the British New Wave and ‘swinging London’ in the sixties (Rita Tushingham), seventies crisis and nostalgia (Glenda Jackson), eighties heritage film and nineties post-feminism and laddism (Helena Bonham Carter and Emily Lloyd), and the rise of the older protagonist in the noughties (Judi Dench). But, at the same time, it was important to avoid the pitfall that Richard Dyer identifies of undertaking an over-determined analysis in which the star is made to ‘simply reflect some aspect of social reality that the analyst cared to name’.92 Each of the stars discussed herein signifies much more than their epitomising of any one trend and I have tried to ensure that my analysis provides adequate breathing space for the full polysemy of their personae to emerge. While some of the stars I have chosen to focus on were major figures of their particular eras and often went on to sustain careers of remarkable longevity, the stardom of others proved more minor or ephemeral, as with the comet-like intensity but sudden burnout of Emily Lloyd’s career or the long slog towards and then rapid waning of Jean Kent’s stardom. Some of the stars I discuss may fall short of the more stringent selection criteria for stardom put forward by film scholar Paul McDonald but, as Babington points out, that approach may have limited applicability beyond the Hollywood industry anyway, particularly so ‘within the British context, in which the various criteria of stardom are often underplayed’.93 In any case, merely looking at the very uppermost tiers of stardom, as Sue Harper points out, offers ‘something of a blunt instrument’ for understanding the intricacies of any given film culture, in which lesser or auxiliary stars are an equally important part of the ecosystem.94 However, it is worth adding that I have chosen to avoid focusing on anyone who may be primarily understood as a character actress, despite acknowledging the vitality of that acting tradition in British cinema and recognising the greater degree of permeability between the categories of star and character player in British films than is perhaps the case in other national film cultures. Margaret Rutherford – the best example of a female ‘character star’ in British cinema – has already been written about extensively elsewhere by Sarah Street and Claire Mortimer, and while other character actresses from Edith Evans to Brenda Blethyn may have ‘starred’ in films, they seem to have been less subject to the paratextual discussion that usually surrounds a star, and that has been so central to my research methodology on this project.95\n\n­\n\nfemal e s t a r do m in b r itis h c i n e m a 21\n\nNor does this book include case studies of British actresses whose film careers have been wholly or predominantly or most successfully conducted in Hollywood productions, such as Dorothy Mackaill, Ida Lupino, Greer Garson, Julie Andrews, Kate Beckinsale, or even the English-born archetypal Hollywood megastar Elizabeth Taylor. Ditto someone like Barbara Steele who found her place as a star in European horror that, as Raymond Durgnat noted, seemed to know how to exploit her ‘strange, spiky, whiplash strength’ much more effectively than any British production, or contemporary British actress Amy Jackson who has found fame in the Indian cinema.96 While acknowledging the transnational framework for the vast majority of British film production from the 1960s onwards, my primary engagement in this study is with those female stars who are understood as British stars and whose careers have tended to remain more tightly tethered, whether willingly or not, to the British industry in all its compromised alterity and occasional glory. Each of the six chapters that follow focus primarily on a particular decade in which the chosen star (or stars in the case of Chapter 6) had the greatest impact or in which their persona was formed. So Chapter 2 emphasises the 1940s, Chapter 3 the 1950s, and so on. At the same time, the complexity and longevity of most of the star careers detailed are impossible to reduce to a single discrete ten-year period and so I have allowed the analysis to encompass the fuller range of their activities over time; this is particularly useful with someone like Diana Dors who periodically reinvented herself as a means of preserving her public profile. The six chapters also cluster conveniently into pairs. Chapters 2 and 3, dealing with Jean Kent and Diana Dors, have a shared concern with British stars who were constructed as ‘bad girls’, sexy antitheses to a presumed feminine norm of English/British niceness and modesty. Kent seemed happy to be one rung down from Lockwood and Calvert at Gainsborough Studios in the 1940s: their resident ‘girl in camiknickers’ to be brought in if a bit of extra sexual piquancy was required. She did a lot with fairly meagre and marginal parts until she got better and bigger chances in the late 1940s and finally became a star in her own right, even hailed as a British equivalent to pin-up girl Betty Grable at one point, with ‘everything that the sultry stars of Hollywood have got. And in the right places!’97 Unlike many of her contemporaries, Kent also appeared to relish being famous: ‘Life is grand fun. Stardom is a great thrill’ she was reported as saying in 1947 and it was ‘exciting to have one’s name in enormous letters outside cinemas’ – sentiments that seem to fly in the face of the usual British tendency to view stardom somewhat suspiciously.98 However, doing several films in quick succession in which she played characters older than her\n\n22\n\nf e mal e s t a r s o f b r i t i s h c i n e m a\n\nown age, including her multiple versions of one woman in The Woman in Question, had an unfortunate effect on Kent’s star career, making her prematurely aged in casting terms. Kent described herself as being ‘too old for young parts, too young for older ones’ when she was in her midthirties, stranded between categories.99 As she observed in the mid-1950s: ‘People are always telling me “My dear, you’ll be wonderful when you’re older.” But I am older. I’m getting older all the time. Jolly soon I’ll be too old.’100 This mid-life drought was not unique to Kent. Eileen Atkins observed a similar phenomenon in her own career and described it as ‘like being an athlete who has been running races for years and is suddenly told, when he is at his peak, that there is nothing to run anymore’.101 The problems posed by ageing while trying to sustain a star career reverberate throughout many of these case studies, reflecting a wider sense of cultural anxiety around women’s ageing. While Jean Kent was struggling to sustain a career in the 1950s, Diana Dors picked up the bad-girl baton and ran with it. She luxuriated in the trappings of stardom – furs, gowns, cars, swimming pools – and represented like no one else the promise (and perils) of consumerism for a society negotiating its way from austerity to affluence. So notorious was her lifestyle and image at this time that she became a byword for luxury and/or profligacy, which sometimes cropped up in the oddest places: when Salford City Council increased their expenditure rather than making budgetary cuts in 1957, they were accused of playing with ‘fancy Diana Dors figures’.102 Part of Dors’ game-plan was to conquer Hollywood, an objective that was very nearly fulfilled when she was offered a contract with RKO in 1956 and went off to the States to great fanfare. But events conspired against her and she never achieved the levels of success that had briefly, tantalisingly, seemed possible. More of a tall poppy than an English rose perhaps, she was chopped down to size and returned to Britain while, ironically, it was the more rosily inflected British female stars Deborah Kerr and Jean Simmons who ended up forging the more durable US careers around that time, fulfilling rather than confounding cultural expectations of English femininity. But Dors showed admirable grit and staying power by converting herself into a kind of British folk heroine, ‘a symbol of all that is ripe and robust in British entertainment’ according to television interviewer Russell Harty in 1977.103 While Kent and Dors encountered problems in advancing their careers in the 1940s and 1950s due to their status as British bad girls, female star typology began to change in the 1960s as it responded to and mediated broader social change. Moving into this decade, Chapters 4 and 5 look at two stars who found fame at opposite ends of the sixties, Rita Tushingham\n\n­\n\nfemal e s t a r do m in b r itis h c i n e m a 23\n\nand Glenda Jackson. Both were seen as epitomising a sense of newness and change, particularly in the way that they departed significantly from previous models of British female stardom. As commentators were quick to point out, neither would have been picked for the Rank Charm School due to their ‘unconventional’ looks and both suffered in the press as a result, with Tushingham labelled an ugly duckling and Jackson likened to a gargoyle. Their backgrounds differed from the norm too, both being from the Merseyside region and not taking the trouble to disguise the fact, and as Northern-girls-made-good they seemed exemplary of the era’s social mobility. In truth, in that respect they were exceptions to the general rule for actresses of this period, even those associated with new kinds of cinema. Julie Christie, Vanessa Redgrave, and Susannah York, for instance, were all securely middle class in background and the class breakthrough achieved by the British New Wave and its aftermath seems in retrospect to have been more to the benefit of working-class male actors, among them Albert Finney, Tom Courtenay, Michael Caine, and Sean Connery. But Rita Tushingham’s debut in A Taste of Honey (1961) added an important new female presence to the social-realist pantheon, and ‘Tush’ then managed to reposition herself as the perfect quirky ingénue to sum up the new questing spirit of the sixties: a ‘little female elf with big wide eyes’.104 The 1970s proved more challenging territory for Tushingham, as an actress so firmly associated with the previous decade and its youthful joie de vivre. In any case, this period saw the bottom fall out of British production as a result of withdrawal of US finance, a situation that had ‘dire consequences for the representation of women’, according to Sue Harper, and saw actresses generally having ‘to be content with slim pickings’.105 However, one female star who did flourish in the 1970s, and indeed enjoyed her greatest period of success during those years, was Glenda Jackson. Her flintier and more combative model of femininity was seen to match the period’s harsher mood, and she was frequently associated with the contemporaneous rise of the women’s liberation movement. While Jackson’s aura of sexual challenge was very modern in many respects, particularly her frequent appearance in explicit nude scenes, in other ways her persona harked back nostalgically to older Hollywood models of stardom, with Katharine Hepburn and Bette Davis evoked as reference points for Jackson’s updated take on the smart, spiky heroine. After the social and aesthetic challenges posed by new kinds of stars in the 1960s and 1970s, the 1980s saw a partial retrenchment in gender typology. The English rose returned with a vengeance in the cycle of period drama subsequently labelled heritage film, exemplified by the emergent young star Helena Bonham Carter. Like her frequent employer Merchant\n\n24\n\nf e mal e s t a r s o f b r i t i s h c i n e m a\n\nIvory, her name became synonymous with a certain kind of genteel romanticism about the past, and she was loved and criticised in equal measure for her ability to play the Edwardian ingénue so convincingly. Bonham Carter is one of two young actresses examined in Chapter 6, alongside Emily Lloyd who represented a rather different model of British female stardom that emerged around the same time. There were obvious semiotic differences between the early roles that defined them: the aestheticised sexual awakening of Helena Bonham Carter’s Lucy, kissing in a poppy-strewn field accompanied by Puccini in A Room with a View (1985) contrasts sharply with the sordid parlour groping from a seedy older man and sex in a garden shed experienced by Emily Lloyd’s Lynda in Wish You Were Here (1987). But both were teenage discoveries presented as ‘the next big thing’ when they made their divergent film debuts, and looking at them together offers some interesting insights into British cinema’s strategies for developing and showcasing young female talent around this time. While Lloyd was presented as a modern girl, an ordinary London teenager who just happened to be extraordinarily talented, Bonham Carter found herself mired in the past not just in the majority of her screen roles but in her overall image as an old-fashioned ‘little English rosebud’, forever laced up in corsets.106 In the long run, Bonham Carter was able to complicate and diversify that original image to build a more complex career while the initially more promising Lloyd, far more hotly pursued by Hollywood at the time, struggled with mental health issues and industry machinations, eventually dropping out of making films altogether. She is one of the great ‘what ifs’ of this book, representing a good many other charismatic and brilliant British actresses who have not been able to realise their full potential, for whatever reason. Still in her teens, Emily Lloyd was being described as a ‘national treasure’, somewhat surprisingly since this is a label more readily applied to older stars like Dame Judi Dench, the subject of this book’s final case study chapter.107 In comparison with Chapter 6’s teen discoveries, Chapter 7 examines the unusual case of someone who found fame as a film star much later in life. Suddenly becoming an Oscar-winner with real bankability while in her sixties, Dench seems to confound the usual narratives of female ageing that inevitably see it in terms of deterioration and decline. While venerated as an immensely skilled actress, she is also admired as a fun-loving celebrity as well as a role model for age-appropriate elegance. With the current prominence of older female British stars like Dench, Helen Mirren, Maggie Smith, and Charlotte Rampling, it does appear that things have moved on since the days when journalists were able to claim with confidence ‘no one loves a film star who looks forty’ or, heaven forbid,\n\n­\n\nfemal e s t a r do m in b r itis h c i n e m a 25\n\nFigure 1.3 Helena Bonham Carter versus the Kardashians: a British female star in meme culture (reproduced from http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ in-a-world-of-kardashians).\n\nolder.108 But as some barriers to stardom are broken down, others prove much harder to dismantle, as will be explored in this book’s conclusion. British female film stars have always been part of a much wider celebrity landscape and that has only been intensified by contemporary digital intermediality. But despite heightened competition for attention, the femininities they embody still seem to offer something distinctive and desirable. In early 2016, an online meme began to circulate that was captioned ‘In a world of Kardashians, be a Helena Bonham Carter’ over a characteristically quirky image of the British star. Just one version of a whole string of memes that compare the Kardashians, or sometimes specifically Kim Kardashian, unfavourably to other famous women who are perceived as having greater elegance or individuality, Princess Diana, Audrey Hepburn, Lucille Ball,\n\n26\n\nf e mal e s t a r s o f b r i t i s h c i n e m a\n\nand Janis Joplin among them, the Bonham Carter variant gained greater notoriety when it was posted and then removed from fellow actress Anne Hathaway’s Instagram account on the grounds of having unintentionally ‘thrown shade’ (criticised Kardashian by implication).109 As Holmes and Negra argue, female celebrities are continually pitted against each other in ways that suggest how disproportionately judgemental our culture is towards women, and indeed these kinds of memes are often repudiated on those grounds.110 But how interesting that in this case a British female star should be deployed as the diametric opposite of the devalued and derogated reality television and Internet celebrity represented by Kim Kardashian and her family. Some of the entrenched privileges around film stardom as opposed to other kinds of celebrity are in operation around this elevation of Bonham Carter, but so too are ideas of class and nationality, with the supposedly more admirable, authentic, and independent-minded stardom of Bonham Carter imbricated with her upper-class Englishness. If this kind of ‘classiness’ is often seen as the ‘unique selling point’ of the British actress, then it is a highly problematic way of carving out a niche in the celebrity universe, depending as it does on the derogation of other kinds of femininity by comparison. However, it’s certainly not a new way for British female stars to claim ‘special’ status. One can see exactly the same kind of snob appeal at work in the construction of Alma Taylor’s image back in the 1910s and 1920s. For example, the emphasis placed on Taylor’s plush upbringing in a country house once lived in (supposedly) by Anne Boleyn feels very similar to the continual references during Helena Bonham Carter’s early career to her illustrious ancestors, with both stars’ publicity materials being animated by the same ‘conservative emphasis on lineage and social distinctions’ that has been central to certain British formations of stardom.111 There are also uncanny similarities in the ways in which Alma Taylor’s and Helena Bonham Carter’s styles of dress were talked about, with Bonham Carter’s love of ‘vintage’ in the 1980s (‘her grandfather’s brown waistcoat, her father’s grey socks . . . her own baggy trousers and braces’) sounding very similar to Taylor’s rejection of film-star finery back in the 1920s (‘I’m not frightfully fond of clothes. At home, I enjoy myself in the oldest things I can find’), even down to the way both women’s fondness for masculine footwear was used to characterise them, with Taylor described as striding out in ‘a pair of brogues that claim no connection with “fashion” ’ while decades later Bonham Carter was summarised as describing her as an ‘unusual girl plodding steadfastly into the future in her Doc Martens’.112 As the proverb goes, there is nothing new under the sun. Indeed, researching this book has often felt like repeatedly peering down a kaleidoscope\n\n­\n\nfemal e s t a r do m in b r itis h c i n e m a 27 in which the view appears to change while always being comprised of the same basic elements just slightly agitated and rearranged. But I hope to provide a full examination of those component parts in what follows and convey something of the special character of British stardom when it has been mediated through female personae, to suggest models of analysis applicable to other national cinemas and media contexts, and to generate new knowledge of the intricate interactions of stardom, celebrity, gender, and national identity.\n\nNotes 1.

Certainly, in Janet Thumin, Celluloid Sisters: Women and Popular Cinema (London: Macmillan, 1992), which also uses women’s memories of films from the same period as a research resource, British stars figure more prominently as aspirational or glamorous figures worthy of ­imitation and adoration. 44.

Babington, ‘Introduction’ in British Stars and Stardom, p. 6. For Babington, the question of who is a star and who is ‘a significant performer’ lies much more in the eye of the beholder and ‘is less theoretically resolvable than is sometimes thought.’ (p. 8). McDonald later provided a very nuanced outline of the full ‘food chain’ of contemporary Hollywood stardom encompassing everything from ‘fireproof ’ A-listers through ‘stars’ and then ‘names’ down to ‘working actors’ and what lies beneath in Hollywood Stardom, pp. 19–24, and it would be interesting to apply a similar hierarchy to the operation of stardom in British film and television. 94. Sue Harper, ‘Thinking forward and up: The British films of Conrad Veidt’, in Jeffrey Richards (ed.), The Unknown 1930s (London: I. B. Tauris, 1998), p. 121. This also corresponds with the line of argument espoused by Bruce Babington that some British performers ‘remain local stars – but no less meaningful for that’.

I have also not included overseas stars who spent significant moments of their career making British films but worked across various national industries, such as Anna May Wong, Elisabeth Bergner, Lili Palmer, Mai Zetterling, or Ursula Andress, while still recognising their significance to the star landscapes of British cinema during their respective periods of popularity. 97.
