        "text": "Manchester United academy chief Nick Cox has praised U21 coach Mark Dempsey over the individual progress of his players.\n\nWhile results have been inconsistent, Cox says player development has been outstanding.\n\n\"I'm absolutely delighted,\" said Cox to manutd.com.\n\nYou want to win, and you want to play well, but our job is to help individuals to learn how to play the game for their own betterment.\n\nThe big thing for us on the matchday is [that] our boys apply themselves in a way that we think is going to prepare them for the first team.\n\nSo we are really pleased with the performances, particularly since the turn of the year. We've seen performances also turn into results and that really is down to Mark Dempsey and his team.\n\nI can't praise [him] enough and I know that he has a really skilled group of staff around him, not just coaches. We're really pleased with how the team are going and with how the staff are supporting the young players.\"\n\nBy playing above their age group, the young Reds in our Under-21s squad face more challenges, but Cox says this is a necessary step in aiding their individual development the overarching aim of our Academy.\n\nUltimately we are preparing them for life, hopefully, in the most competitive league in the world where they are going to be expected to win,\" he continued. The [key] driver for the Academy and for our staff is individual development.\n\nIn order to promote individual development, you actually have to stretch the players and sometimes put them in a difficult environment. So what we do with the Under-21s is keep the average age really low. For the first half of the season the average age of our Under-21s was 19 so we were regularly coming up against teams that were a year to a year-and-a-half older.\n\nWe could see the development and we could see the returns that the boys were getting from finding it really tough. The season panned out exactly as we thought it would and Dempsey and his team of staff did an incredible job.\n\nWe were really delighted to see the kind of progress people were making, and what's happening now in the second part of the season is a lot of those boys who found it tough are now finding it comfortable.\n\nTo see the amount of boys that are being really stretched and playing in some tough environments is exciting for us and fair play to the coaches I make their life difficult. [But] that's how you prepare footballers for the ultimate challenge which is to go on and make a debut.\""
