        "text": "(This photograph is from INPHO and includes influential former Spurs player and Republic of Ireland international Chris Hughton).\n\nFew countries have had more of an impact on the history of Tottenham Hotspur than the island of Ireland. Apart from having a huge fan base in Ireland, with supporters clubs ranging from Limerick to Belfast, it is quite surprising that so little has been written on the importance that Ireland (Northern and Republic) has had on the famous Tottenham Hotspur. From first generation to second and third generation players, many have put on the Lilywhite shirt of Spurs from first team to youth team level. As an Irish Spurs fan I thought that I’d write a short history about Spurs and Ireland and the role it has played in helping to influence Spurs to a certain degree, through chronicling every Irish (first, second and even third generation) player to have played for Spurs throughout the years, and briefly telling their footballing story (this is an updated and revised edition of my 2018 article). From Tony Galvin to Troy Parrott, I have tried my utmost to be as accurate as possible through my thorough research, trying to leave no player to have played for Spurs with Irish connections out. If I have left anyone out, or if I have made any errors I would greatly appreciate being informed.\n\nPlayers who have played for Spurs’ first team (includes friendlies and testimonials) and played for, or were eligible to play for the Republic of Ireland or Northern Ireland:\n\nJack Kirwan: Born in Dunlavin, County Wicklow, John Francis Kirwan was the first ever Irishman to play for Spurs. Kirwan was an outside left who played GAA (Gaelic football in his youth) for County Dublin, and he was a part of the Dublin side which won the All-Ireland Championship in 1894, and defeated Cork in the final. Also a talented footballer, Kirwan made the trip across the Irish Sea to England in the late 1890’s to start his footballing career. Starting off with Lancashire League side Southport Central, Kirwan soon caught the eye of Football League clubs, and after a bidding war took place between both Blackburn Rovers and Everton, the Irishman decided to sign for the latter in 1898, and in doing so became Everton’s first ever Irish player. He played for the ‘ Toffees ‘ for one campaign (he was a regular in their side), but ended up moving on in May of 1899, following in the footsteps of Scotsman and former teammate John Cameron. At the time Cameron was player-manager of Spurs and he happily gave Kirwan the opportunity of signing for the Lilywhites. At Spurs the outside left adapted well to life in north London, his consistent performances on the pitch, as well as his exciting an unpredictable style of play made him a fan favourite at Tottenham. He was quick, direct and skilful in his play which made life very difficult for opposing fullbacks. In his six seasons at Spurs, Kirwan made 340 appearances, scoring 98 goals. He was instrumental in helping then non-league Spurs win the 1900 Southern League, the 1901 FA cup and the Western League in 1904 under the tutelage of John Cameron, putting in a match winning performance against Aston Villa in the semifinals of the FA Cup. The Dunlavin man became an iconic figure at Spurs during the early days of their existence, and his somewhat maverick and highly effective style of play played a big part in this.\n\nJack Kirwan would depart Spurs for fellow London club Chelsea in the May of 1905, and at the ‘ Blues ’ he made 76 appearances, scoring 16 goals, and he played a part in helping the west London club win promotion to the old First Division in 1907. After leaving Chelsea he would later play for both Scottish club Clyde and then Leyton, before retiring from playing the game in 1909. Kirwan then took the step up to management, first taking charge of Dutch side Ajax Amsterdam, where in 1911 he helped them to win the Dutch Second Class Title, subsequently leading them into the first tier of Dutch football for the first time in their history. Later on in his coaching career he had one season with Italian side Livorno, but in between his time in Holland and Italy Jack Kirwan coached Irish side Bohemians and Southport Vulcan. For his native Ireland Kirwan won 17 international caps, scoring two goals. He was a member of the side that won the 1903 British Championship. Later on in his life, Kirwan who kept both the match ball as well as his medal from the 1901 FA Cup final, as well as other international caps for Ireland, would settle in the outskirts of London (Hendon) with his wife Edith. Jack Kirwan was the last surviving member of the 1901 FA Cup final winning Spurs team up until his passing at the age of 80 in 1959. Jack Kirwan was not only the first Irish Spurs player, he was also the first Irish legend at the club.\n\nDavid Quinn: The second Irishman to play for Spurs was inside forward and County Tyrone native David Quinn. First playing for Hudson’s Club who were based in Bootle Northwest England, Quinn later moved to Darwen in 1900 where he helped them to win the Lancashire League. Despite interest from a number of Football League clubs Quinn opted to sign for the Lilywhites in May of 1902. Life got off to a good start for Spurs when he scored on his debut against the London FA in a friendly in late 1902 (I acquired this information from the brilliant book the Spurs Alphabet). However, life thereafter at Spurs wouldn’t have been how Quinn would have anticipated, with appearances few and far between. The inside forward made eight more non competitive appearances for Spurs, as well as making his only competitive appearance for the north London club in a Western League match against West Ham United in February of 1903. He left Spurs during the summer of 1904, and it is unclear where he went or if his footballing career progressed.\n\nCharlie O’Hagan: Born in the small sea side town of Buncrana, County Donegal in July of 1881, inside forward Charles O’Hagan started his footballing career with St Columb’s Court before moving to County Derry side Derry Celtic. O’Hagan who was capped 11 times by Ireland scoring two goals, transferred to English club Everton in 1903 after being spotted playing for Liverpool based club Old Xaverians. The inside forward never ended up playing a senior competitive game for the ‘ Toffees ’ but he was a regular for their reserve side. O’Hagan signed for Spurs in 1904, making his debut for them against Brighton & Hove Albion in a friendly in September of that same year. In total Charlie O’Hagan who was a lively and entertaining player, made 49 appearances for Spurs, scoring 20 goals, and although he was never a regular at White Hart Lane, he did form a good partnership with his compatriot Jack Kirwan. He was released by Spurs in the summer of 1906 (arguably his greatest moment at the north London club came when he scored the goal that knocked Middlesbrough out of the FA Cup in 1905) and was picked up by Middlesbrough who he only stayed with for a couple of months, before moving further up north to Scottish side Aberdeen for a fee of £175, where he arguably had his best years in the game. O’Hagan spent four seasons with Aberdeen making 112 appearances for the ‘ Dons ’ scoring 24 goals. In 1910 he moved on to Greenock Morton before later playing for the now defunct Glasgow based club Third Lanark. During the First World War the Irishman fought with the Highland Light Infantry in France, but after the war was over and he had retired from playing at a relatively young age, he took charge of Norwich City for less than a season. He later made the interesting move to Spain to become the first ever non Spanish manager of Andalusian based club Sevilla.\n\nHe didn’t spend too long with Sevilla (only one season) but would later move to Germany to manage Berlin in what would be his final managerial role of a fascinating football career. Charlie O’Hagan would in later life turn his hand to journalism, sailing all the way from Derry to New York to make a life for himself. However, he passed away far from home in July of 1933.\n\nFrancis McMullan: Northern Irishman Francis McMullan (born in Castlewellan, County Down) in 1882 is part of the one and only club, players to have only played one competitive game for Spurs. McMullan at some point during the early 1900’s moved over to Liverpool where he first played for Old Xaverians before briefly being on Liverpool’s books. The inside forward joined Spurs in May of 1905 and made his one appearance for them in a Western League match against Brentford in 1906 (the Spurs Alphabet says that Spurs fielded a reserve side for this fixture as Spurs had to play Birmingham two days later in the FA Cup). McMullan was released by Spurs in the April of 1906 and it is unknown where he went after leaving them.\n\nMatt Reilly: From Donnybrook, County Dublin, Matthew Michael Reilly’s first sporting passion during his younger years was Gaelic football like many young Irishmen at the time. It was only when Reilly was with the Royal Artillery in Glasgow that he started to play football, he operated as a goalkeeper with junior side Benburb. Matt ‘ Gunner ’ Reilly as he was known later played for the Royal Artillery who were based in Portsmouth (he would end up going out on two loans during his time there), and he was a part of the side which reached the FA Amateur Cup final in 1896, losing to Bishop Auckland. A sharp shot stopper who was also good with his kicking, Reilly also played for the Army as well as Hampshire and Forfarshire. However, it was for Portsmouth as they were now known where he did well in the Southern League, and he won two international caps for Ireland for it. Interestingly during a game for Portsmouth against Swindon in January of 1904, Reilly resorted to punching a spectator after being struck by an object which had been thrown from the crowd. He would be banned from playing football for two weeks. After spending five seasons with ‘ Pompey ’ Reilly moved to Scottish side Dundee, where he spent a season making just three appearances. For the following season he moved to Football League side Notts County but after starting a good number of games to begin with he lost his place halfway through the season. He signed for Spurs that same year for a fee of £100 after impressing during a trial. He made 26 competitive appearances for Spurs during the 1906/07 season before returning to Ireland at the end of that campaign after being released, to join Shelbourne (he was a member of the Shelbourne side that reached the 1908 Irish Cup final). After retiring from the game the County Dublin man went back to Hampshire, Southsea to be precise, where he became a publican. However, in later years he returned to Dublin where he passed away at the age of 80 in 1954.\n\nJ.Doyle: On Dublin Bohemians books when he featured for Spurs on trial in a London Football Combination game against Fulham in February of 1916 as a guest. Doyle was a fullback by trade who didn’t go on to play any more games for Spurs.\n\nHarry McCleneghan: Goalkeeper Harry McCleneghan started his career with Belfast Distillery before trialling with Norwich City in 1914. It was actually while on trial with the ‘ Canaries ’ that he impressed Spurs in a South Eastern League game at reserve team level. McCleneghan signed for Spurs in February 1914 and would go on to make one first team appearance in a friendly against Chelsea and two appearances for the reserves, before being released at the end of the season. Like J.Doyle it is unknown where McCleneghan went after leaving Spurs.\n\nJ.McVey: Another guest for Spurs during World War One, J.McVey was on the books of Dublin club Shelbourne when the forward made two appearances for the Lilywhites during the war. Those appearances came in London Football Combination fixtures against Chelsea and Millwall during the 1916/17 campaign.\n\nMcCalmont: One of three Irish guests to feature for Spurs during the First World War, McCalmont was on the books of Belfast based club Linfield. The centre forward made two appearances for Spurs, the first coming against Arsenal in a London Football Combination game against Arsenal, while the second came shortly afterwards in a friendly against an RAF team in Reading.\n\nDick Rowley: Enniskillen born centre forward (he was also adept at playing inside forward) Richard William Morris Rowley’s family had a proud history in the British Army. With Rowley’s father being a major in the British Army. The Rowley family left Northern Ireland when Dick was a young child, and ended up settling in Hampshire, England where Dick was educated at Taunton’s Grammar School in Southampton. A talented sportsman, Rowley joined the army after leaving school and served in Lancashire and Wiltshire. However, Rowley started his footballing career while in Wiltshire with Tidworth United, later playing for Andover Town, Swindon Town, London Casuals and Southampton who he had a good spell with averaging a goal every other game. It was at Southampton where Rowley really made his name in the game and he attracted the interest of many clubs. However, it was then Second Division Spurs who bidded £3,750 in February of 1930 and Southampton simply couldn’t refuse. Rowley however, didn’t get as many games as Spurs would surely have anticipated (he made 24 appearances scoring ten goals, making his debut in the FL against Oldham Athletic) and the player who won six caps for Ireland throughout his career scoring two goals, spent a fair bit of his one season and a half at Spurs with the reserves. In December of 1931 the Ireland international left Spurs to transfer to Preston North End for £5,000. He spent three years at Preston before retiring in 1934. After retiring from the game he coached both at Lancashire AFA and RAF Uxbridge. He also became a pilot officer which later changed to flying officer, and then flight lieutenant. Dick Rowley passed away in Southampton at the age of 80 in April of 1984.\n\nBobby Browne: Derry man Robert James ‘ Bobby ’ Browne was born in February 1912. The Northern Irishman who played for his country six times (he made his debut against England in Belfast in 1935) was a half back by trade, and a talented one too. One of ten children (his youngest brother Leonard was killed when the HMS Firedrake was sunk) he started off playing for junior clubs Maleven and Cooney Rovers however, Browne began his senior career with hometown club Derry City in the early 1930’s. He played for the ‘ Candystripes ’ until 1935 winning both the City Cup and the North-Western Cup, when English side Leeds United were impressed by Browne who was playing in the game between the Irish League team and the English League, and came calling. He joined Leeds for a fee of £1500 and despite his small frame he settled in well to life at the Yorkshire based club. Before, during and after the war Browne made in total 121 appearances for Leeds. During the war he joined the police force in England, he later resigned and would become an Army PT instructor in Colchester, Essex. In the midst of all this he also guested for a number of clubs including Derry City when he was posted back to Ulster, Aldershot, Luton Town, Swansea Town, Colchester United, Watford and Spurs. For Spurs, Browne made three appearances in total, making his debut against Queens Park Rangers in the FLS in the September of 1942. After the war had ended Bobby Browne played for York City, before becoming player-manager of Thorne Colliery and then coach and caretaker manager of his old club Halifax Town in 1954. Browne passed away in 1994 when he was in early 80’s.\n\nH.Harris: Starting off with Belfast based club Distillery, inside forward H.Harris guested for north London clubs Spurs and Arsenal during the Second World War. For Spurs Harris made three appearances during the 1943/44 season, whilst serving with the Irish Guards.\n\nJohn Hayes: John Franklin Hayes was born in Northern Ireland in 1913 but emigrated to Canada as a 16 year old. Playing for Saskatoon Sons of England and Thistle in Canada, before then playing his only game for Spurs as a guest and as a relatively old player in 1952. Hayes guested for Spurs when he was introduced at half time to replace Spurs goalkeeper Ted Ditchburn in their friendly game against the Saskatchewan FA in their tour of North America. The goalkeeper was most likely recommend to guest for Spurs due to his experience in the game, as he was most probably the most experienced goalkeeper in Saskatoon, Spurs won the game 18-1! In later years he would coach a number of clubs and also referee games. Hayes passed away in September of 1974.\n\nJohnny Gavin: Limerick man John Thomas Gavin was a pacy goal scoring winger who enjoyed a distinguished career in the game. Born in April 1928, Gavin started his career in the game with Jamesborough United before signing for his now defunct hometown club Limerick City in 1947. He combined playing for the ‘ Super Blues ’ with working hard on the Irish railways, mainly as a painter. Capped internationally by Ireland on eight occasions scoring two goals, Johnny Gavin was scouted by Norwich City while playing for Limerick City and the then Norwich manager Doug Lochhead wanted to sign him, despite interest from London club West Ham United. Gavin signed for the ‘ Canaries ’ in 1948 and he spent six memorable years there scoring 76 goals in 203 competitive appearances. His time at Norwich City had impressed Spurs manager Arthur Rowe who secured the Irishman’s signing in October of 1954. Gavin only spent just over one season in north London (he resided locally in Ponders End) as he didn’t enjoy life as much as he did in Norwich. However, the former Limerick man did well at Spurs making a good impression at the club, scoring 15 goals in 32 appearances. However, Gavin was happy for return to Norwich in November, 1955 in a part exchange which saw defender Maurice Norman go to Jimmy Anderson’s Spurs. He endeared himself to the Norwich fans once more, and Gavin added to his goal scoring total during his second three year spell there, taking his total tally to 132 competitive goals in 338 appearances. He departed the ‘ Canaries ’ in 1958 and would go on to play for Watford, Crystal Palace, Cambridge City, Newmarket Town and finally Fulbourn Institute. In later years Gavin managed the Rock Hotel in Cambridge where he lived. He passed away in the city at the age of 79 in September 2007.\n\nBrendan McNally: A trialist who was playing for Dublin club Shelbourne, Brendan McNally was recommend to Spurs by his manager and former Arsenal player David Jack (born in Drimnagh, Dublin in January of 1935) and he made his one and only appearance for Spurs in a friendly against Accrington Stanley. A talented fullback (he predominantly played on the right) who played for junior clubs St.Finbarrs and St John Bosco FC during his youth, McNally also represented Ireland at schoolboy level. He was signed by Shelbourne in 1954 and in the same year he made the trip across the Irish Sea to trial for Spurs. Unfortunately for McNally heavy rain brought the game to a premature end on 52 minutes. And although scouted by Spurs after returning to Shelbourne, the Lilywhites decided not to bring the Irishman back to north London. Brendan McNally did however, return to England to trial for Luton Town in 1956 and he ended up being signed by the ‘ Hatters ’ who he made in total 134 league appearances for, scoring three goals. McNally had a good career with Luton in the First Division and he was a part of the side which made the 1959 FA Cup final where they lost to Nottingham Forest. After leaving Luton he played for Cambridge City and Dunstable Town before entering management, taking charge of former Spurs youth player Kerry Dixon at Chesham United before then managing Dunstable Town. The former fullback who won three caps for the Republic of Ireland at international level throughout his career, passed away in Luton in July 2011.\n\nDanny Blanchflower: Spurs’ original captain fantastic, Robert Dennis Blanchflower was a visionary of the game. For many Spurs fans Danny Blanchflower remains one of the greatest and most influential ever players to pull on the famous Lilywhite shirt of Tottenham Hotspur. With his exceptional vision and incisive passing ability, the Belfast born right half was the on the field brains behind Spurs‘ double winning success of the 1960/61 season. The on the field manager as he has been described by former teammates, had a profound impact on the history of our great club throughout its most successful period. Blanchflower was as I say a visionary, a man light years ahead of his time. He was also a hero to so many Spurs supporters including myself, even though he was long, long before my time. Danny Blanchflower (his mother played football at a relatively high level) was born in East Belfast, Bloomfield on the 10th of February 1926, Blanchflower would later attend Ravenscroft public elementary school and then the Belfast College of Technology. Having started out with Northern Irish side Glentoran as an amateur, Blanchflower earned himself a move to English team Barnsley after impressing during his 124 appearances for the ‘ Glens ’ and Barnsley paid £6,000 for him to join them in 1949. After a spell in Yorkshire with former Spurs manager Jimmy Seed, the Ulsterman then moved to Aston Villa before transferring in 1954 to Tottenham Hotspur a club whose name he had liked the sound of since he was a young boy. Blanchflower would spend ten years at the Lilywhites and while he did clash with Jimmy Anderson during the former Spurs managers reign at the club in the 1950’s. Danny’s time at Spurs was overwhelmingly positive and along with manager Bill Nicholson and that great team that we had during the early 1960’s, he helped to shape the history of Spurs. Voted the FWA Footballer of the Year in 1958 and 1961, he captained Spurs to winning the double in the 1960/61 season, the highly versatile and adaptable Belfast man also helped Spurs to win a further FA Cup, and also the European Cup Winners Cup in 1963, before departing them at the end of that season (Danny also won 56 caps for Northern Ireland during his career scoring 2 goals. He also captained them to the quarterfinals of the 1958 World Cup).\n\nHe later went abroad to play for the likes of Toronto City (guest), Boksburg (guest), and Durban City (guest) as well as serving the South African club as a guest coach. After retiring from playing the beautiful game, Blanchflower turned his hand to management, taking charge of Chelsea (unfortunately it was an ill fated reign at the ‘ Blues ’) and Northern Ireland (had Bill Nicholson had, had his way then Danny would have replaced him as Spurs manager in 1974). He also became a hugely respected football journalist where he wrote about the game for the Sunday Express, as well as commentating on football games on television. In later life Blanchflower was awarded a testimonial match at White Hart Lane in May of 1990 but just over three years later he sadly passed away after suffering from pneumonia in Cobham, Surrey. He was the definition of a legend of the game. Former Spurs teammate Eddie\n\nClayton had the following to say about Danny when I spoke with him recently: “ Danny was a very professional footballer and when he played he was very attack minded. He played with a smile on his face although he was still very serious about his football, but with Danny it was all about attacking football, he never thought about defending and that’s why he clashed with Bill Nicholson who was very defensive minded. Whereas Danny was attacking minded, he used to say look if they score one then we’ll score two, if they score two then we’ll score three and so on, and that’s how he was. That was Danny’s way of playing football, he was happy if we won 10-9! As a player Danny was very skilful and he was very good on the ball. He was also a good passer of the ball and even though he wasn’t very quick, his positioning and his reading of the game was very good. He was a good captain who was friendly, and he loved a bit of a laugh. However, he was still a serious guy and I would call him a true professional. ”\n\nPat Jennings: Legendary goalkeeper Patrick Anthony Jennings was one of Spurs’ all time great goalkeepers, and at one stage in his career arguably the best goalkeeper in the world. Jennings, who is from Newry, County Down, started his footballing journey with Newry Town before later playing for Newry United. The commanding young goalkeeper (17) was playing for a Northern Ireland youth side in the final of an English youth tournament against England at Wembley, when Bill McCracken who was a scout for Watford at the time was impressed by him and recommended him to the ‘ Hornets ’ who paid Newry Town £5,000 for his services. Jennings excelled for the then third division club, since making his debut in May of 1963. During the following season he played every league game for Watford as well as winning two caps for his country, Northern Ireland. Jennings, who was a superbly athletic goalkeeper who commanded his box excellently, as well as being able to comfortably pluck the ball out of the air (without gloves), was soon attracting the interest of a number of clubs. And unbeknownst to him in June of 1964, he was sold to Spurs after they had bid £27,000. Starting a 13 year spell with the Lilywhites, ‘ Big Pat ’ as he was known made 656 appearances for Spurs, winning the FA Cup in 1967, the League Cup three years later as well as in 1973, and of course the UEFA Cup in 1973. He was also voted the Football Writers’ Player of the Year in the early 70’s as well as the Players’ Player of the Year. A firm fans favourite with the Spurs fans, his association with the club was legendary and the sheer quality of his many, many excellent saves, along with with the way that he dealt with crosses and set pieces made him a defenders dream to be playing with. The goalkeeper who in total won 119 caps for Northern Ireland including playing at the World Cup, was amazingly sold to bitter rivals Arsenal at the end of the 1976/77 season following Spurs’ relegation to the Second Division, was Keith Burkinshaw’s decision. Although Jennings didn’t want to go over to the other side of north London, he ended up serving Arsenal really well during his eight years their.\n\nA member of the side which won the 1979 FA Cup, as well as making three other cup finals with the ‘ Gunners ’, Jennings made 327 competitive appearances for Arsenal before retiring from playing in 1985. However, Pat returned to Spurs in August of 1985 to maintain his match fitness for the 1986 World Cup with Northern Ireland. He went on to make one more competitive appearance for Spurs in the Football League Super Cup against Liverpool in the winter of 1986. After leaving Spurs again he signed for Everton as cover but never made an appearance for the ‘ Toffees ’ during his time their. After officially returning from the game he has coached goalkeepers at Spurs where he still coaches (now part time as an academy coach) and during the early 2000’s he was also a goalkeeping coach of Oxford United. Jennings’ son who is also named Pat was also on Spurs’ books as a youth player but would go on to have a good career in Ireland. Pat Jennings, along with Danny Blanchflower is a Spurs legend of the modern day.\n\nJoe Kinnear: Born in Kimmage, Dublin, but brought up in Watford, England, where he moved to with his family at a relatively young child. Joseph Patrick Kinnear started his career with St Albans City but was taken on trial by Spurs who had been impressed with his progress at the non league club, during the early 1960’s. The fullback who loved to attack was signed by Spurs as an amateur in 1963 while working in the printing trade, he eventually signed professional terms with the Lilywhites in February of 1965. A dependable player who was a good tackler (he also had pace) who managed well to combine both his defensive duties with his attacking duties, Kinnear made his competitive senior debut for Spurs in a Football League game against West Ham United in the April of 1966. He enjoyed a good 1966/67 season, first winning his first cap for the Republic of Ireland in a game against Turkey and then enjoying a good run in the Spurs side during the second half of that season after first choice full back Phil Beal had been ruled out for the season with a broken arm. Kinnear performed well in Beal’s absence and he was a member of the side which reached the 1967 FA Cup final and beat Chelsea (Kinnear started that game). He continued to be an important player in the seasons after Spurs’ FA Cup triumph, going on to become an important and reliable player for manager Bill Nicholson. Kinnear helped Spurs to win two League Cups, an FA Charity Shield and the UEFA Cup. During his ten year spell with Spurs, Joe Kinnear made over 200 appearances, and he only started to fall out of favour at fullback when Northern Irishman Terry Neill took over from Bill Nicholson. He left Spurs to move to south coast club Brighton and Hove Albion but a bad knee injury put an end to his professional career in the game. The Irishman who made 26 appearances for his country would later play for Dunstable Town before being player-manager of Woodford Town. Kinnear then turned his hand to coaching, beginning an interesting managerial career as trial manager of Nepal, before then coaching UAE side Sharjah.\n\nHe would go on to coach a number of clubs in Asia as well as managing Nepal on a permanent basis. However, Kinnear would also have a successful managerial career in England, managing the likes of Wimbledon where he won LMA manager of the year in 1994, Luton Town, Nottingham Forest where he managed future Irish Spur Andy Reid, and Newcastle United. He was also Director of football at both Oxford United and Newcastle United until resigning from his role at the ‘ Magpies ’ in February of 2014.\n\nChris McGrath: Christopher Roland McGrath was born in south Belfast in November 1954, and during his younger years he impressed playing for both Belfast and Northern Ireland Schools, where he was scouted playing by Spurs. McGrath was signed by Spurs as a young apprentice in July of 1970, first starting off as a midfielder he worked his way up the field to play as a forward. A future Northern Ireland international who would play under Spurs legend Danny Blanchflower (he won 21 caps and scored four goals) McGrath, who had a good sense of humour as a young man, would impress at youth level for Spurs (he signed professional terms in January 1972) and he made his competitive first team debut for them in a North London Derby against Arsenal in October of 1973. A player whose nickname during his playing days was ‘ Paddy ’, McGrath would play in a number of positions at Spurs of which included playing in midfield, on both wings (he had pace to beat his man) and up front as a central striker. He may not have lived up to his potential at domestic level for Spurs however, McGrath did do well in Europe, scoring some important goals during their 1973/74 UEFA Cup campaign (he featured in both legs of the final against Feyenoord). Chris McGrath made in total 38 appearances, scoring ten goals for Spurs, during his time their. After the 1973/74 season the Northern Ireland international struggled for appearances under manager Terry Neill, and McGrath was sold to Manchester United for £30,000 in October 1976, after initially being sent out on loan to Millwall the season before. McGrath spent five years at Manchester United but only made 38 competitive appearances for them, scoring one goal. He would later transfer to American side Tulsa Roughneck in 1981 before later playing for Hong Kong based club South China AA, and he would do well their, becoming captain of the team. He retired from playing the game in 1985.\n\nNoel Brotherston: Dundonald man (situated just east of Belfast) Noel Brotherston grew up on the Balybeen estate where he first developed his love of football. Brotherston was a stylish winger who played for North Down and Northern Ireland Schools, before playing in the Glentoran youth system for a time during the Northern Ireland troubles. Noel Brotherston who was the son of a Belfast shipyard worker, was spotted playing football by scout Bob Bishop who wasted no time in recommending the tricky winger to a number of clubs, of which included Spurs. The young man whose hero was George Best was signed by the Lilywhites as a 15 year old schoolboy in 1972, Brotherston impressed at youth level at Spurs with his highly skilled and direct approach to the game (he was also quick). And the teenager became an important part of the Spurs youth team that won the 1974 FA Youth Cup under the tutelage of manager Pat Welton. Brotherston then stepped up to reserve team level where he also performed well, and then in March of 1976 he made his one and only competitive appearance for Spurs in a league game against Aston Villa in when he replaced the injured Jimmy Neighbour however, he was replaced by Martin Robinson at half time. The Northern Irishman who represented his country on 27 occasions and who scored the winning goal in the British Championships final against Wales in 1980, wasn’t favoured by Spurs manager and fellow countryman Terry Neil. So at the end of the 1976/77 season Brotherston was given a free transfer by Spurs and he joined Second Division side Blackburn Rovers. At Blackburn, Brotherston became a cult hero making over 300 appearances, scoring over 40 goals and endearing himself to the fans in the process. After leaving Blackburn, Brotherston’s career took him to Bury, Scarborough, Swedish side Motala AIF and Chorley Town. Tragically the much loved family man who later became a painter and decorator, passed away in Blackburn of a heart attack in the May of 1995, the month that his beloved Blackburn Rovers won the Premier League.\n\nTerry Neill: Although many remember Terrence John William Neill as manager of Spurs, the Belfast man did appear once for them as a player during the clubs post season tour of Canada, Fiji and Australasia in 1976. Neill had enjoyed a good playing career during his younger years, first starting off with Northern Irish side Bangor as a youth player before moving over to Arsenal in 1959, first to their youth team before later being promoted to their senior squad. Neill captained Arsenal at the tender age of 20 and the former wing half turned centre half became a near permanent fixture for the ‘ Gunners ‘ over an almost eight year period. Making over 240 league appearances for the north London side, Neill who had won 59 international caps for Northern Ireland during his playing career, was a member of the Arsenal side which made the 1968 Football League Cup final. He would later become captain of Northern Ireland in the late 1960’s before leaving Arsenal to join Hull City as player-manager in July of 1970, but he left them a year afterwards (he also became player-manager fo Northern Ireland for a period during the 1970’s). Neill was hired as Bill Nicholson’s successor in 1974 but his time as manager of Spurs didn’t make him a fan favourite due to his links with Arsenal. The Belfast man narrowly avoided relegation from the First Division during his first season in charge of the club however, in his second season in charge Spurs managed to achieve a ninth place league finish. Neill returned to Arsenal this time as manager in 1976 to start a seven year spell with the ‘ Gunners ’ which saw him win them 1979 FA Cup. Interestingly Neill reportedly tried to sign Glen Hoddle from Spurs, during his time in charge of Arsenal, something which would have made him even less popular with the Tottenham faithful. Terry’s one and only appearance for Spurs came as a substitute in a post season friendly against Northern New South Wales in Newcastle, Australia in 1976. Nowadays Neill owns a couple of sports bars in the London area, as well as commentating on games on Arsenal TV.\n\nGerry Armstrong: Tall, physical and extremely versatile centre forward Gerard Joseph Armstrong had the perfect build to play Gaelic football in Ireland. In fact Armstrong played GAA seriously up until the age of 16, when he was serving a suspension from the sport and decided to try football. The Belfast born man who grew up on the Springfield road in the mid 1950’s, first played for St. Paul’s Swifts, who he once scored 35 goals in a season for. Armstrong later played for Cromac Albion and then Bangor who he helped to win the County Antrim Shield in May of 1975. Only part time with Bangor due to the fact that he was working with the Northern Ireland Housing Executive as a Senior Clerical Officer. Armstrong was spotted by Spurs playing for Bangor but looked set to sign for bitter rivals Arsenal however, Terry Neill did manage to secure his signing in the end, as Spurs paid Bangor £25,000. Spurs wanted to play the then 22 year old Armstrong as a centre half initially but he wasn’t content to be playing in that position. A striker who had great strength and good pace, Armstrong was a good team player who although wasn’t prolific during his time in north London, he did win admirers due to his direct and effective style of play. He was also good in the air and he scored a good number of headed goals during his career and this made life difficult for opposing teams defenders. Unfortunately for Armstrong he was a member of the Spurs side which was relegated to the Second Division in 1977 however, he played a good role in helping them to bounce back at the first time of asking. Gerry did play in central defence for Spurs during his time their however, even his versatility couldn’t stop him from being sold in 1980 to Watford as Spurs recruited a number of new additions. (he scored 10 league goals in 84 appearances for Spurs). Armstrong was much loved at Watford where he scored 12 goals in 76 appearances, the Northern Irishman who played 63 times for his country, scoring 12 goals, including a very important winner against Spain at the 1982 World Cup, was also a part of the Watford side which got promoted to the First Division in 1982.\n\nArmstrong’s success at the 1982 World Cup with Northern Ireland brought with it some new admirers, and in 1983 he signed for Spanish side RCD Mallorca for £250,000. He would later play for the likes of West Bromwich Albion, Chesterfield, Brighton, Millwall, Glenavon, Bromley, Waterford, Worthing (player-manager) and Whitehawk in what was a long career in the game. After retiring from playing the game Armstrong worked as a scout for Watford, had two spells as assistant manager of Northern Ireland and managed Whitehawk along with a number of other roles in the game. He also commentated on La Liga for Sky Sports for a number of years, and he is now a football analyst where he lives back in his home city of Belfast.\n\nJimmy Holmes: James Paul Holmes, of the Liberties in Dublin (born in 1953), was a very solid and dependable defender (adept at playing at left back and central defence) during his playing days. Holmes, who began his career with Dublin side St John Bosco (he also played for Ireland as a youth player) and who attended the Emmet Road Technical School, was spotted playing for St John Bosco by Coventry City scout Bunny Fulham, and he ended up signing for them in 1969. Then a central defender, Holmes anticipated danger well in games and he managed to settle in well to life at the ‘ Sky Blues ’. After initially playing for Coventry’s youth side, Holmes was a member of the side that reached the 1969/70 FA Youth Cup final against Spurs however, they lost over the course of three games. He would go on to make 128 league appearances for Coventry City over the next seven years, in addition he would also become the youngest ever player to make his debut for the Republic of Ireland at the age of 17 years and 200 days, in a game against Austria in 1971. It would be the first of 30 International caps for his country. The Dubliner who once played against Pele in later years, was a key player for Coventry during his time their. In March of 1977 he moved on to Spurs for a fee of £120,000, Holmes would go on to make 92 competitive senior appearances for Spurs (he scored two goals). He showed his qualities as a ball playing defender at the Lilywhites, and he became a reliable player for Keith Burkinshaw’s men, as he helped them to win promotion back to the First Division during the 1977/78 season. However, he was never to be the same player after suffering a horrific leg break in a World Cup qualifier against Bulgaria in Sofia, in 1979. The leg break would cause a number of other problems for Holmes but it meant that after being out for a year he was never again to be the player that he was before. In the February of 1981 he signed for Canadian club Vancouver Whitecaps. Holmes would later have spells with the likes of Leicester City, Brentford, Torquay United, Leicester United and Peterborough United as player-assistant manager.\n\nIn 1985 Holmes was awarded a testimonial match by the Irish FA at Dalymount Park in Dublin, as a Glenn Hoddle XI took on an Irish XI. After retiring from playing Jimmy became a police officer in the West Midlands and would later work a chauffeur a job which he still does today in Nuneaton, where he drives the mayor of Nuneaton around town.\n\nTom Heffernan: A player whose party trick was heading cricket balls, Thomas Patrick Heffernan was born in Dún Laoghaire in the April of 1955, and would grow up in the Sallynoggin district of the town. Heffernan began his playing career with Dún Laoghaire Celtic and it was their that he was spotted by a scout from Spurs. Heffernan had a successful trial with the Lilywhites and was signed by the club in 1977, meaning that he had to give up his day job in Dublin, working at a rehabilitation centre. The Irishman played for the youth team and the reserves at Spurs, a regular in both teams he made his one and only appearance for Spurs in a testimonial game against Arsenal in November of 1977. Heffernan would come on as a substitute and ultimately score a goal in the game. He departed Spurs for AFC Bournemouth in 1979 and would play under future Spurs manager Harry Redknapp down on the south coast during his second spell at the club in 1985. In between that the now primarily central defender played for Sheffield United, and then after leaving Bournemouth for a second time in 1988 he dropped in to the non league, playing for the likes of Swanage Town and Herston, as well as Parley Sports. Nowadays Tom Heffernan resides back in his native County Dublin.\n\nTom Sloan: Ballymena born midfielder Thomas Sloan was a player of small build who despite his size, was an industrious midfield player who had good vision and passing ability. Sloan started off with Raglan Homers before signing for Northern Irish side Ballymena United in 1978. The midfielder came on to the scene at Ballymena in the Northern Irish Premier Division (he made 40 appearances in total) and he was a member of the Ballymena side that reached the final of the Irish Cup in 1978 (they were defeated by Linfield). Sloan, who also made an appearance for Northern Ireland’s under 21 side during that fruitful year of 1978, also attracted the attention of English sides Spurs and Manchester United during the summer time. Tom Sloan was taken on trial by Spurs for their end of season tour of Sweden and Norway, and he played two games for the Lilywhites. The first was against FC Hamar, and the second game was against Kvik Halden. In the end Spurs decided not to take Sloan on but Manchester United did after he impressed during his subsequent trial their. The Ulsterman only made 11 league appearances for Manchester United during his four years on their books. The footballer who won three caps for Northern Ireland, left Man United to sign for Chester City in 1982. He would later return home to Northern Ireland where he had a good career, playing for the likes of Linfield, Coleraine, Carrick Rangers, Larne and Ballymena United once again. He would go on to work as a plasterer while playing Saturday morning football for his first club Raglan Homers.\n\nChris Hughton: Talented and highly effective left back Chris Hughton rose up through the youth and reserve ranks at Spurs to appear in 398 games for them and become one their best ever fullbacks in the process (born in Forest Gate, London in 1958). Hughton was the son of a Ghanaian father and an Irish mother, and he would go on to represent the Republic of Ireland with great distinction on 53 occasions, scoring one goal (Hughton would always go to great lengths to travel to Ireland games). The former St Anthony’s Catholic School pupil signed for Spurs as a part time professional (he combined his time at Spurs working as a lift engineer) in 1977 and excelled for them both at youth and reserve team level. Hughton signed full time professional in 1979 and he made his competitive senior debut in a league game against Manchester United two months later. A determined, offensively potent, consistent and archetypal left back who never gave up any challenges, Hughton was a great servant to both Ireland and Spurs throughout his career. With Spurs he played a key part in helping them to win two FA Cup’s during the early 1980’s, as well as the 1984 UEFA Cup when he performed excellently in the second leg of the final against Anderlecht, he was also a part of the Spurs side that shared the 1981 FA Charity Shield with Aston Villa (Hughton also helped Spurs to reach the 1982 League Cup final). He left Spurs to join West Ham United on loan in November 1990, before joining them on a permanent transfer the following month. He played for the ‘ Hammers ’ until 1992 before then transferring to fellow London club Brentford in 1992, spending one season with the ‘ Bees ’. He retired at the end of that season to become Spurs under 21 coach during that summer, before later becoming reserve team manager. Hughton would also become caretaker manager of Spurs as well as assistant manager on two occasions, also being assistant manager of the Republic of Ireland from 2003 to 2005.\n\nChris Hughton would then go on to have a successful career in management which lasts up until the present day. The former fullback has so far managed Newcastle United, Birmingham City, Norwich City and Brighton and Hove Albion, he also commentates on games for Sky Sports. Hughton is not only a Spurs legend but a real gentleman who is without doubt one of their most influential Irishmen.\n\nTony Galvin: Huddersfield born winger Anthony Galvin represented both Yorkshire and England Schools during his youth (born in July 1956) before going on to study for a Bachelor of Arts degree in Russian Studies at Hull University (he qualified for the Republic of Ireland through his grandfather on his mothers side, and would go on to win 29 caps, scoring one goal. He also played at Euro 1988). Galvin combined his studies with turning out for the university team, before then going on to go to Teacher Training College, while also playing for non league side Goole Town. It was during his time with Goole Town that he was spotted playing by Bill Nicholson and Spurs signed him in January of 1978 for £30,000 (he actually didn’t become a full time professional for Spurs until the summer time, so that he could complete his teacher training course). Galvin was a winger who would always hug the byline and would use his frame to go on powerful forward runs down the flank (he was strong), he also possessed very good stamina. Making his competitive first team debut for Spurs in a First Division game against Manchester City in February of 1979. Galvin did struggle to get a consistent run in the Spurs team until the 1980/81 season when he became an important player in the side which won the FA Cup (he assisted Ricky Villa’s famous goal in the final). However, he did suffer a number of disruptive injuries which massively hampered his playing time at the Lilywhites. Although he did win an additional FA Cup in 1982 and the UEFA Cup in 1984. Galvin who did until recently play for the Spurs legends team, was one of a number of players sold when David Pleat took over as Spurs manager in 1987.

The feisty and good pressing young striker started out with local club Johnville before being spotted and subsequently signed for Spurs as a 15 year old schoolboy apprentice in 1980. McCabe had a fairly good goal scoring record for Spurs’ youth team in the old South Eastern Counties League, and the former Gaelic footballer and hurling player would go on to progress to the reserves. However, during his time at Spurs the then young centre forward was tormented by injuries and this severely hampered his progress and meant that he was never able to reach his full potential at the club. Making his senior debut for Spurs as a substitute in Welshman Paul Price’s testimonial against Luton Town in October of 1981, after that game he was swiftly offered a professional contract by Spurs. He was however, let go (presumably as a result of his injury troubles) shortly before he turned 20. McCabe then took the unusual step of moving to Norwegian third tier club Vard Haugesund (McCabe is still fondly remembered in Norway for his goal scoring exploits) a side who where struggling in the league when McCabe arrived however, his goals pushed them up the table, and by the end of the season they had won promotion to the second tier of Norwegian football.

Carr was not only an attack minded fullback, but he was also one who kept good positioning, was difficult to get past, and who read the game well. The former Donahies Community School pupil who represented Dublin Schools during his youth, first really played for Stella Maris. It was their that he was scouted by Spurs and brought over on trial in the summer of 1992 as a 15 year old and duly signed for then manager Ossis Ardiles’s team.

After giving 12 years of great service to the Lilywhites he moved on to Newcastle United in August 2004, spending four years their and winning the 2006 UEFA Intertoto Cup. After leaving them he went on trial with Leicester City in 2008, but announced his retirement from football soon afterwards. However, in 2009 Carr started to train again this time with Birmingham City, and after being awarded an initial one month contract, he signed an extension to the end of the season. Like at his previous clubs Stephen Carr gave Birmingham great service and he would end up spending over four years their, helping them to defy the odds and win the 2011 Football League Cup.\n\nSteve Robinson: Lisburn man Stephen Robinson played for Lisburn Schools and Northern Ireland Schools during his youth before signing for Northern Irish giants Linfield as a trainee. It was at Linfield that Spurs signed Robinson in 1991, with the then striker signing professional terms with Tottenham less than two years later. Steve Robinson progressed up the youth ranks and up to reserve team level when he was thrust in to the action in a Premier League game against Blackburn Rovers in October 1993. The young striker made an additional league appearance for Spurs as a substitute not long after the Blackburn game, in addition to that appearance he also played three non competitive games for Spurs’ first team in friendlies. After a loan spell with Leyton Orient, the forward/midfielder was sold to AFC Bournemouth in the autumn of 1994. He excelled at the ‘ Cherries ‘, scoring 52 goals in 241 competitive appearances. Robinson would spend just less than four years at Bournemouth before moving on to Preston North End in 2000. A loan move to Bristol City and a permanent spell with Luton Town followed, before the Ulsterman retired from playing the game in 2008. Since retiring from playing he has held a post with the Irish FA, been assistant manager with Lisburn Distillery, managed Oldham Athletic as well as Motherwell where he is currently doing a fine job as boss, already leading them to two domestic cup finals.\n\nGerry McMahon: A young 14 year old with Northern Irish side Glenavon having previously been on Lurgan Celtic’s books, winger Gerard Joseph McMahon was seen as a hot prospect by top clubs over the water. Spurs bid £100,000 to secure his signing in 1992 although he would stay on at Glenavon until the end of the 1991/92 season, and in doing so he scored the winning goal in the 1992 Irish Cup final to defeat Linfield. After some time in the youth and reserves (also featuring for the first team in friendlies), as well as time on loan at Barnet, the skilful winger who was known for accelerating past players at speed, was given his first team competitive debut against Coventry City in the Premier League at the end of the 1994/95 season. ‘ Ged ‘ as he was known would go on to represent Northern Ireland at the highest level on 17 occasions, scoring two goals. During his time at Tottenham Hotspur however, he would also make 20 competitive domestic appearances, as well as scoring his one and only goal for Spurs in a UEFA Intertoto Cup game against Östers IF. McMahon trialled with the likes of Stuttgart and Udinese in 1996 before leaving Spurs for second tier side Stoke City. After two years with the ‘ Potters ‘ he left to go to a good St Johnstone where he would arguably spend the best two years of his career. Later Gerry McMahon would move back to Northern Ireland, first playing for Glenavon before then becoming their assistant manager and caretaker manager. He was also reserve team manager and assistant manager at Loughall. As well as being player-manager of Dromara Village, a role he held until 2014. Only last year McMahon returned to his old club Lurgan Celtic to play in goal against Banbridge in a league game! As there were no senior goalkeepers available to play the game.\n\nNeale Fenn: Born near to White Hart Lane in Edmonton, London, Neale Michael Charles Fenn played for Enfield, Middlesex and the Republic of Ireland Schools as a school boy (he was eligible to represent Ireland as he had an Irish grandmother). The young striker joined his boyhood club Spurs as a trainee in 1993 and the highly rated Fenn who was good with his feet and could link play well, would sign professional forms in 1995. He would make his competitive first debut for Spurs more than two years later after doing well in the reserves. His debut came with his reserve team striking partner Rory Allen in the third round of the FA Cup tie against Manchester United, and by all accounts the two young strikers did well however, Spurs lost by two goals to nil. Fenn would represent the Republic of Ireland’s B team and under 21’s during his career as well as being called up to the senior squad on two occasions, and after that Manchester United game he would go on to make a further 10 competitive appearances for Spurs, scoring one goal in a Football League Cup game against Carlisle United. Fenn would have loan spells with Leyton Orient, Norwich City, Swindon Town and Lincoln City as well as a trial with Dutch side RBC Roosendahl before leaving the Lilywhites after being released in 2001. He would play for Peterborough United, and after that go on a number of trials with lower league clubs before going to Ireland. In Ireland he played for Waterford United, Cork City, Bohemians, Dundalk, Shamrock Rovers and Swords Celtic before going in to coaching. Fenn has so far coached at a number of levels including managing Longford Town. He is currently manager of Irish Premier Division side Cork City.\n\nKevin Maher: Ilford born tenacious former central midfielder Kevin Andrew Maher is of Irish heritage and would play for the Republic of Ireland’s under 17’s, 21’s and B team. Maher had previously played for Essex Schools before joining Tottenham as a trainee in July 1993 (he turned professional in 1995). A skilled midfield player, Maher would do well in the youth ranks and the reserves, and he got his chance in the Spurs first team during the 1997/98 pre-season tour of Norway (he made his debut against Faaberg). Maher would play in all four of our matches of the tour but would subsequently only appear for the first team in one other friendly game. The midfielder was handed a free transfer to join Southend United in January of 1998 and he would give over ten years of tremendous service to the ‘ Shrimpers ‘ making over 400 appearances and scoring over 20 goals. During the latter stages of Maher’s playing career and after being released by Southend United in 2008, he plied his trade with Oldham Athletic, Gillingham, Dagenham & Redbridge, Bray Wanderers and Whitehawk. Since entering coaching following his retirement from playing Kevin Maher has held the roles of Chelmsford City head coach and manager of Southend United’s development squad. Maher is currently one of the favourites to succeed Sol Campbell as manager of Southend United.\n\nPaul McVeigh: Northern Irishman Paul Francis McVeigh was an exciting young talent with Lisburn Youth when Spurs brought him over to London in 1994 to sign him as a trainee. McVeigh, who operated either as a forward or a midfielder signed professional terms with the Lilywhites in 1996. Progressing well in the youth and reserve team, the Belfast man who was not the biggest of forwards, made his competitive first team debut for Spurs in a Premier League fixture against Aston Villa towards the end of the 1996/97 season. The nimble footed forward would play two more league games for Spurs scoring one goal, and during the following season he played a fair few games in pre-season but didn’t get any more first team opportunities after that. McVeigh trialled with both Cambridge United and Norwich City before moving to the latter on a permanent deal in 2000. He did well for the ‘ Canaries ‘ where he arguably enjoyed his best years in the game, making over 200 appearances for them and scoring over 30 goals. Winning 20 caps for Northern Ireland at the highest level McVeigh would later be loaned out to Burnley before trialling with Italian side Pisa and Plymouth Argyle, but in the end he ended up signing for Luton Town where spent two years of his career. After a trial with American side San Jose Earthquakes McVeigh rejoined Norwich City after a successful trial, and he played for them during the 2009/10 campaign before retiring from playing at the end of the season. Nowadays Paul McVeigh works as a motivational speaker.\n\nRoss Darcy: Yet another Irish player who suffered terrible injury troubles during his time in England, talented and classy central defender Ross Darcy was tipped for great things in the game. From Ballybriggin, County Dublin, Darcy started out at Glebe North before moving on to Dublin side and Stephen Carr’s former team Stella Maris. However, it was at the annual Milk Cup in Northern Ireland when Darcy was spotted by scouts from Spurs, and brought over to London where he signed with the Lilywhites as a trainee even though he also had the chance to sign for Manchester United. A former Republic of Ireland Schools international and future under 21 player, the centre half did well in the Spurs youth team and he was an important member of the under 18 side which reached the 1995/96 FA Youth Cup final, losing to Manchester United over two legs with Ross impressing in both. The Ballybriggin man continued to do well for the youth team however, he did suffer a quite terrible knee injury early on his career. This knee injury even when fixed by surgery would plague Darcy throughout his footballing career and he was never to be the same player that he was, but despite this the young man whose footballing idol was Paul McGrath did manage to feature in three pre-season friendlies for Spurs’ first team, the first of which came in a friendly against Peterborough United in July of 1998. He left Spurs the following year to join Barnet, he was loaned out to Dover Athletic in the winter of 2000 before returning to Barnet and eventually returning to Ireland where he played for Dundalk I. 2002. Darcy was forced to retire from the game in January of 2004 due to suffering persistent pains in his bad knee. The Irishman may not have had a too enjoyable playing career after leaving Spurs however, it was his younger years at the Lilywhites which still stay fondly with him. These days Darcy lives back in his native County Dublin.\n\nPeter Gain: Qualifying for the Republic of Ireland through his parents, Hammersmith born midfielder Peter Thomas Gain was a player who shone at youth level during his younger years at Spurs. A skilful and hardworking player, Gain represented the Republic of Ireland Schools as a schoolboy (he would go on to represent them as high up as under 21 and B level) before joining Spurs as a schoolboy in April of 1991. He signed as a trainee for Spurs in 1993 and then as a professional two years later. Peter Gain was loaned out to Football League side Lincoln City shorty after signing his first professional contract and he did well in his first spell at the ‘ Imps ‘ before returning to Spurs at the end of the season. It was during the next pre-season that he featured as a substitute for Spurs’ first team in a friendly against Birmingham City, it was to be his one and only appearance for the senior side. He joined Lincoln City on a permanent transfer during the same summer and he would become an important player throughout his six years their, as well as endearing himself to the Lincoln City faithful in his over 220 competitive appearances for them. He would later move to Peterborough United in 2005, spending close to three years their before spending the last years of his career in the non league with Dagenham & Redbridge.\n\nGary Doherty: Born in Carndonagh, County Donegal but brought up in Luton, England where his family moved at the age of six. A versatile defender/forward Gary Michael Thomas Doherty who would become somewhat of a cult hero at Spurs, started off with Luton Town as a trainee, working his way up the ranks at the ‘ Hatters ‘ before making over 80 competitive first team appearances for them, scoring 15 goals in four years. The former Republic of Ireland under 18 international who had won the European Championships in 1998, as well as played for their under 20 and under 21 sides, Doherty was signed for Spurs by then Director of Football and former Luton Town manager David Pleat in April 2000 for £1m. Doherty was a different type of player in the sense that he could play central defence and bring the ball out effectively from the back due to him being good on the ball. However, he also could play up front as a target man with him being good and dominant in the air. During the early days the Donegal man combined his time playing first team and reserve team football however, the former Republic of Ireland international who was capped 34 times by his country, started to get regular playing time in defence in the 2001/02 season. Yet just as he was starting to make good progress he suffered a broken ankle after a challenge from Eifion Williams in a Football League Cup tie against Torquay United. He did return to play the last few games of that season but ended up not being a regular for the start of the next campaign, combining the minutes that he did get up front as well as in central defence. The ‘ Ginger Pele ‘ as he was known was seemingly not a key player during the following 2003/04 season under Glenn Hoddle however, when David Pleat took charge for a second spell as manager during that season, Doherty got more minutes and despite rumours circling that he may be leaving Spurs, he stayed on for the entirety of that campaign. The central defender did however, leave Spurs during August of 2004 and after Jacques Santini took charge of the club, as Doherty moved to Norwich City for a fee of £1m after making more than 75 competitive appearances for Spurs including netting a memorable goal against Manchester United in a game at Old Trafford, and a brace in a league game against Sunderland.\n\nDoherty stayed with Norwich for almost six years before later playing for Charlton Athletic and Wycombe Wanderers. He retired from playing the game in December 2014.\n\nGavin Kelly: Hammersmith born and former Middlesex and Republic of Ireland Schools goalkeeper Gavin Kelly signed for Spurs as a trainee in 1997, and went on to do well at youth team level for Spurs. Signing professional forms with Spurs in 1999, Kelly got his first taste of first team football in the same year when he was loaned out to non league club Chelmsford City. Then in the following year he went out on another loan, this time to London club Kingstonian. After those two separate loans Kelly was for a period Spurs’ third choice goalkeeper, and during the 2001/02 pre-season Kelly was with the first team, and made three appearances for them in friendlies (he made his debut against Stevenage Borough). A fine shot stopper, he was put on the transfer list in 2002 and eventually signed for Kettering Town after going on a number of trials with other clubs. Later on in Kelly’s career he played for the likes of Welling United, Cambridge United, Leatherhead and Scarborough Athletic.\n\nCiarán Toner: A former Northern Ireland international from Craigavon, Ciarán Toner combined playing Gaelic football and football during his youth in Northern Ireland. Toner, who operated as a right sided midfielder but could also drop in to defence if needed (he possessed good strength) during his playing days, first started off with Glenavon as a youngster before being scouted and signed by Spurs as a schoolboy in May of 1995. He continued with Glenavon before moving to London permanently to join the Lilywhites as a trainee in the summer of 1997. A Northern Ireland under 21 and senior international (he won two caps for the seniors) Toner was a regular for the Spurs youth side during the late 1990’s, before progressing in to the reserves for the 2000/01 season. He continued to make good progress and during the 2001/02 season he made his one and only appearance for Spurs’ first team in a friendly against Stevenage Borough. Ciarán continued to play for the reserves for one half of that season, before going out on loan to Peterborough United. He was released by Spurs at the end of the season and after a couple of trials with other clubs he joined Leyton Orient for the start of the 2002/03 season. After spending two years with Leyton Orient Toner has since played for Lincoln City, Cambridge United, Grimsby Town, Rochdale, Harrogate Town and Guiseley. He was also a coach at York City for a spell before becoming player-coach of Gainsborough Trinity, and later head coach of Dearne Valley College Football Club. The bright young coach is currently Youth Development Phase coach of Rotherham United, a role that he has held since the summer of 2013.\n\nPaul O’Donoghue: Strong central defender Paul O’Donoghue was raised in Lewisham, London, the son of Irish parents from County Kerry. O’Donoghue who had played for Inner London Schools, Villacourt Rovers and Welling United during his youth, moved to the other side of London when he was spotted and signed by Spurs as a scholar in the summer of 2000 (he signed professional forms during the following year). The future Republic of Ireland under 19 and 20 international did a good job for the Lilywhites at youth and reserve team level, and he would manage to make three appearances for Spurs’ first team in pre-season friendlies during his youth (his debut came against Colchester United in July 2002). Paul O’Donoghue would be loaned out to Hornchurch in 2004, before going out on another loan the following year, this time to Heybridge Swifts whose manager at the time was former Spur Brian Statham. The Irishman who was an excellent Gaelic football player during his school days, would later sign for Heybridge Swifts permanently in 2005, before his career in the game ended quite abruptly shortly after a move to Beckenham Town. After he stopped playing football, O’Donoghue started to play Gaelic football once again, playing for Birmingham based club John Mitchels, Austin Stacks and Round Towers. He also traveled to Ireland, at one point playing Gaelic football for the Tralee Institute of Technology. He would go on to train as a teacher, studying first at the Tralee Institute of Technology and later the University of Limerick. Nowadays Paul O’Donoghue currently teaches PE at a London school.\n\nGeorge Snee: Dubliner George Snee played for well known Irish youth side Belvedere during his youth as well as the Republic of Ireland Schools. The forward and former Maynooth School pupil signed for Spurs as a 16 year old trainee in 1999, signing professional forms the following year. Snee was an exciting young player who was adept at playing out wide on both flanks, as well as in midfield. After progressing up the youth ranks he became a consistent player in the reserves, and his hard work was rewarded in the pre-season of the 2002/03 campaign when he got his opportunity as a substitute to play for Spurs’ first team in a friendly against AFC Bournemouth. Unfortunately for Snee he was released by the club at the end of that season, and after going out on trial for a number of clubs the Irishman who had represented his country up to under 20 level would sign for AFC Wimbledon for a short period in 2004. Snee would later play for Hampton and Richmond Borough before going on trial with Woking and then seemingly disappearing from the game. George was last known to be back in Dublin working as a Financial Derivatives Trader.\n\nStephen Kelly: Right back Stephen Michael David Kelly was a quite skilful, quick, determined and consistent player. Born in Finglas, Dublin the former footballer who started his footballing career with Dublin youth side Belvedere, joined Spurs as a scholar in July of 2000 (he signed professional terms in September). Kelly played in a talented Spurs youth side that included the likes of Dean Marney and Lee Barnard, and he managed to make that right back spot his own. ‘ Steo ‘ as he was known during his Tottenham days later progressed to the reserve team as well as being a regular for the Republic of Ireland’s under 21 team. Kelly made his competitive first team debut for Spurs after going out on three successive Football League loans, in a Premier League fixture against Charlton Athletic in December 2003 (the first of 44 competitive appearances for Spurs. He scored two goals) however, Kelly was very unlucky with injuries during his time at Spurs and this stopped him from getting consistent playing time. Capped 39 times at the highest level by the Republic of Ireland as well as playing at Euro 2012, Kelly had the unfortunate task of initially having to dislodge his compatriot Stephen Carr from the Spurs team. And even when Carr left Spurs in 2004, Kelly was then behind other right backs in the pecking order. He more often than not looked good whenever he played for Spurs and also potent in attack however, the Dubliner who scored Premier League goals against both Aston Villa and Birmingham City would eventually be forced to leave Spurs to find regular first team football. During the 2006/07 pre-season he departed Spurs for a fee of £750,000 to move to Birmingham City. While at Birmingham he was a regular and important player for a couple of seasons until new additions to the team kept him on the bench and out of the side. The right back moved out on loan to Stoke City in 2009 before returning to Birmingham for the start of the following season where he was faced with the challenge of keeping Stephen Carr out of the side. In the end he moved to Fulham before later going on to play for Reading and Rotherham United. Since he stopped playing ‘ Steo ‘ has been doing some radio work for radio station talkSPORT.\n\nRobbie Keane: A Republic of Ireland legend and the top scorer and winner of caps in their history, Robert David Keane is also an iconic figure in the history of Tottenham Hotspur. Born in Tallaght, Dublin in July 1980, clinical striker Robbie Keane was not only one of Ireland’s greatest ever players, but he is also a member of the Premier League’s 100 club (players who have scored 100 or more league goals). ‘ Keano ‘ started his playing career with local side Fettercairn United at a young age, before later moving on to Crumlin United. The extremely skilful and silky striker who learnt his trade by playing football on the streets of Tallaght, was impressing scouts with the ability that he was showing at Crumlin United. Keane was sought after by a number of big clubs but he ended up signing YTS forms with English side Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1996, before signing a professional contract a little over a year later. The Dubliner burst on to the scene at Wolves as a teenager and the then youthful striker netted an impressive total of 29 competitive goals in over 70 appearances for them. A number of big clubs came in for the confident young player but it was Coventry City who secured his signature after bidding a then record £6m for the teenager. Continuing to improve in his all round game Keane spent one successful season with the ‘ Sky Blues ‘ before moving to Italian giants Inter Milan in 2000 however, his time in Italy wasn’t a happy time. After making only six competitive appearances for Inter Milan, Keane left Italy to join Premier League side Leeds United on loan. After initially doing well he signed for them permanently before the start of the 2001/02 season. After another season at the Yorkshire based club he signed for Spurs in September 2002, starting a more than six year first stint at Spurs, and it was an extremely successful one too. Keane was not only a striker, he could also operate out wide or as a second striker and CAM. Pace was one of his strengths during his younger years, but for his biggest strengths as a played were his extremely quick feet and agility, as well as being a clinical finisher which made him so potent in front of goal (he was also extremely feisty and confident). Keane scored many goals for Spurs (well over 100), some of which were outstanding ones. He was a big game player for the Lilywhites and him being a member of the side which won the 2008 Football League Cup was just a small reward for his excellent service to the club.\n\nRobbie Keane left Spurs to join Liverpool at the end of the 2007/08 season for £19m, breaking many Spurs fans hearts in the process. However, like his time at Inter Milan earlier on his career, his spell with the Merseyside giants also wasn’t as successful as he would have hoped, as he only scored five goals in 19 league appearances for Liverpool. New Spurs manager Harry Redknapp managed to bring Keane back to the English capital on January transfer deadline day during the 2008/09 season. During his second spell at Spurs it was clear that Keane’s confidence had been damaged during his time up north, and although the Republic of Ireland’s captain was never to be the same player again he did give the same excellent work rate and leadership on the pitch, averaging a league goal every four games for Spurs. Loan moves to Celtic and West Ham United followed for Keane who eventually left Spurs permanently to join MLS side LA Galaxy in 2011. After a successful time in America, Keane did have a brief loan spell with Aston Villa before finishing his playing career as player manager of Indian Super League side ATK. Since he retired from playing Robbie Keane has held the positions of assistant manger of the Republic of Ireland and of Middlesbrough. I am intrigued to see where he goes next in his coaching career.\n\nMark Hughes: Dungannon man Mark Anthony Hughes started off with Donaghmore Youth, before progressing on to Dungannon United and later Dungannon Swifts. A hardworking, energetic and powerful midfielder, the Northern Irishman who would win two caps for his country at the highest level during a tour of the USA in 2006, was a solid and consistent performer for Spurs at youth level after joining them as a scholar in 2000. Hughes had soon progressed up to the Spurs reserve side where he also did well, always putting in a shift for the team. He would then make his first team debut for Spurs in a pre-season friendly against Oxford United during the 2003/04 season. Hughes would appear in four more friendlies during his time at Spurs however, he would leave the Lilywhites to further his footballing career. Having already experienced first team football on loan at Northampton Town, before joining Oldham Athletic on loan in November 2004, with the move being made permanent in 2005. He was released in the summer of 2006, Hughes then joined Thurrock before having a loan spell with Chesterfield. He has since played for Stevenage Borough, Chester City, Barnet where he enjoyed arguably the best years of his career, Eastleigh, Chelmsford City, Eastbourne Borough, Bishop’s Stortford and currently Isthmian Premier League side Cheshunt who he has been playing for since 2018.\n\nMark Yeates: Skilful Tallaght born wide man/attacking midfielder Mark Stephen Anthony Yeates started off with Greenhill Boys, a club that his father Stephen who played for Shelbourne and Shamrock Rovers and grandfather were involved with. Yeates later progressed to famous Dublin youth side Cherry Orchard, the technically gifted footballer then signed for Spurs as a scholar in July 2001 after coming over on trial to London with Willo Flood and Stephen Quinn, and he soon made his mark on the Tottenham youth side with his skill, directness and confidence. The determined Dubliner did well in the youth team (u17 and u19’s) and the reserves where he was making good strides, and during the early stages of the 2003/04 season he was loaned out to Brighton and Hove Albion. Playing mens football did Yeates good, and by the end of the season he had made his competitive senior debut for Spurs’ first team, appearing in a Premier League game against Wolverhampton Wanderers in the May of 2004, setting up a goal for Robbie Keane with a fine pass. A reliable player throughout his playing career, Yeates would make a further eight appearances for Spurs’ first team, scoring one goal in total. Capped as high up as under 21 level for his country the Republic of Ireland, ‘ Yeatesy ‘ would be loaned out to Swindon Town, Colchester United, Hull City and Leicester City during his time at Spurs. However, in July of 2007 he signed for Colchester United on a permanent basis. He spent two good years in County Essex before moving to Championship side Middlesbrough in 2009. Yeates would later have spells with Sheffield United, Watford, Bradford City, Oldham Athletic, Blackpool, Notts County, Eastleigh where he once registered 26 assists in one season, and most recently AFC Fylde who he is currently still on the books of, going strong at the age of 35. Unlucky not to win a senior cap for the Republic of Ireland during his career, Yeates’ first club Spurs is one that he still has extremely fond memories of.\n\nKieran McKenna: Born in London’s Irish community of Kilburn in May of 1986, Kieran Thomas McKenna moved to Enniskillen, Northern Ireland with his family at a young age. A midfielder who had good vision for a pass, McKenna played for Enniskillen Town and Ballinamallard Youth during his teenage years before signing for Tottenham Hotspur as a scholar in 2002. Capped by his country Northern Ireland at under 19 and under 21 level, McKenna played for Spurs’ youth and reserve team during his time their. He also made six appearances for Spurs’ first team in friendlies (McKenna made his debut against Stevenage Borough in July 2004) however, a bad hip injury for the young Northern Irishman kept him out of action for over two years, harming his development as a young player. At the age of 23 he was forced to retire from playing the game however, this didn’t stop McKenna from staying in the game. After doing his coaching badges he became a Spurs Academy coach before later having spells coaching Nottingham Forest’s Academy, Loughborough University, Vancouver Whitecaps and St Thomas Aquinas College before later becoming head coach of Spurs’ under 18 side, winning the 2013/14 PL South. He would be lured to his boyhood club Manchester United in 2016 to become head coach of their under 18’s, leading them to the 2017/18 PL North. However, once Ole Gunnar Solksjær was appointed manager of Manchester United in 2018 McKenna has been an assistant first team coach. The young coach undoubtedly has a bright future in the game.\n\nAndy Reid: A somewhat underrated but skilled midfielder, the son of former St Patrick’s Athletic player Bill Reid, former Republic of Ireland international Andrew Matthew Reid (he represented them on 29 occasions scoring four goals) had a good quality career in English football. Born in Crumlin, Dublin, Reid started off with Templeogue United before playing for Lourdes Celtic and then Cherry Orchard. While developing at Cherry Orchard Reid he attracted interest from a number of clubs, of which included Manchester United and Arsenal, in the end Reid signed for Nottingham Forest as a trainee in 1998. He made his competitive debut for Nottingham Forest against Sheffield United in 2000 and he would make a further 144 appearances for the Midlands based club, scoring 21 goals. A player who loved a long shot during his playing days, Reid signed for Spurs along with central defender Michael Dawson in 2005 after more than seven years with Nottingham Forest. He spent a season and a half at Spurs making over 25 appearances in the process (he made his debut against Portsmouth in a league game in February 2005), scoring one goal. However, he left Spurs to join then Championship club Charlton Athletic in the summer of 2006 for a transfer fee of £3m. Reid spent a successful year and a half with Charlton before moving to Sunderland in 2008. He later played for Sheffield United on loan and Blackpool before returning to Nottingham Forest, his first club in English football, and it was their that he ended his career in 2016 due to injury problems. The gifted attack minded midfielder who could see and execute a pass well, was a fine footballer who is now developing in to a fine young coach. Now a UEFA A licence coach, Reid is a coach for Nottingham Forest’s under 23 side as well as being the head coach of the Republic of Ireland’s under 18 side.\n\nKenny McEvoy: Speedy winger Kenneth McEvoy had bags of pace and trickery, and he was a very direct player during his time as a youth player at Spurs. Born in Waterford, Southern Ireland, McEvoy signed scholarship forms with Spurs in the summer of 2011 ready for the 2011/12 under 18 Premier League season. He did a good job for our under 18’s that season, and would later progress up to the clubs development side where he was a mainstay for a number of seasons. The former Republic of Ireland under 21 international made his one and only appearance for Spurs’ first team when he started for Spurs in Ledley King’s testimonial at the end of the 2013/14 season. McEvoy would spend the rest of his time at Spurs playing for the development side. He went out on loans to Peterborough United, Colchester United, Stevenage Borough and York City, joining the latter side permanently half way through the 2015/16 after having his contract terminated at Spurs. He was released by York City at the end of the 2015/16 season, later signing for non league club South Normanton Athletic before moving back to Ireland to sign for Waterford United in 2017 however, he returned to South Normanton Athletic during the same year, and that is the club who he was last heard playing for while living in County Derbyshire.\n\nAaron McEneff: From the Cornshell Fields area of Derry, technical central midfielder Aaron McEneff played for Don Boscos and Maiden City, and later Institute as a schoolboy. The former Northern Ireland under 17, 19 and 21 international who would later switch international allegiances to the Republic, was signed as a scholar by Spurs in the summer of 2012. A regular for the clubs under 18 side, then Spurs Technical Director Tim Sherwood once said that McEneff reminded him of a young Roy Keane. However, injuries did affect the player who later played for Spurs’ development side, and he wasn’t able to reach his full potential while at the Lilywhites. A very talented young player whose brother Jordan now of Arsenal was also on Spurs’ books as a youth player, Aaron McEneff had trials with Sheffield Wednesday and Nottingham Forest after being released by Spurs at the end of the 2014/15 season. He ended up returning to Ireland to sign for Derry City where he had a really good three year spell, developing a reputation as a bit of a goal scoring midfielder as well as being named in the 2017 PFAI team of the year. Linked with a couple of English clubs during his time at Derry, McEneff signed for Shamrock Rovers in 2019 as he continues to progress as a footballer at the age of 25 and is doing really well in the League of Ireland.\n\nDominic Ball: Welwyn Garden City born defender Dominic Martin Ball was a schoolboy at Watford before signing a two year scholarship with Spurs in 2012.
