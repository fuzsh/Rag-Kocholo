        "text": "“Of course I still give the coaches freedom to work, but I also give them direction, by saying for example, ‘I want that player to start making minutes in that position.’\n\n“So the final responsibility lies with me about how the second team performs and the flow of players that goes from the reserve team to the first team. This is totally new for the people at Manchester United, but I had already discussed it during the introductory talks with the club management.\n\n“They were immediately open to it. They looked at Ajax with admiration because of how the club always manages to get youth players successfully through the system.\n\n“There is a constant influx of talents at Ajax and I explained that’s because the basis of everything at the club is the youth Academy. When I was going home from my work at Ajax in the evening, I would often see the Under-8s or Under-9s training and I would stay to watch.\n\n“In the final phase of a player’s Academy years and the step up to the first team, it is all about the structure between the Academy Director, the reserve-team coach and the manager. This is what I mean when I talk about co-operation.\n\n“I talked to (Football Director) John Murtough about this at length before I came to Manchester and he set it up in such a way that I can work this way here too.\n\n“In the Netherlands, I had made the step towards taking more of a managerial role at Ajax. If you don't have competent people around you, you can't delegate and you're going to do it all yourself anyway.\n\n“But if you do have competent people, you have to bring them into your vision and then you can delegate tasks. An example is the training process with the senior team. I know this is in good hands with (coach) Mitchell van der Gaag.\n\n“Because he is at the training sessions, I can often take an overview view. Then, as a manager, you see a lot more than if you are working on the training exercises yourself.”\n\nThis might not be as revolutionary as Ten Hag has suggested, however. Under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer there was a close link-up between the first team and U23s, as they were then.\n\nThe Norwegian also regularly visited the Academy to watch both training and matches. So too did the legendary Sir Alex Ferguson, as former first-team coach Rene Meulensteen remembered.\n\n“He came to Littleton road, to the Cliff, a number of times, to see what we were doing and the environment we were trying to create,” Meulensteen told TGG. “The moment he showed his support for that programme it takes a lot of doubters away.”\n\nUnited have also had a fine record of progressing players from the Academy to the first team, with a homegrown player having featured in every United matchday squad since October 1937."
