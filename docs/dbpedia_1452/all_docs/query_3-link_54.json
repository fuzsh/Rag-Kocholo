        "text": "Lee Carsley will be named England interim manager for the Three Lions’ Nations League matches against the Republic of Ireland and Finland in September, according to widespread reports.\n\nFormer Republic of Ireland midfielder Carsley has been a candidate for the permanent role after leading England to the Uefa Euro Under-21 title in 2023, winning the tournament for the first time since 1984.\n\nCarsley’s predecessor, Gareth Southgate, was also England under-21 manager, going on to guide the senior side for eight years until his resignation after Euro 2024, where he oversaw a 2-1 defeat to Spain in the final on July 14.\n\nEngland manager: ‘Interim solution’\n\nSpeaking after Southgate’s departure, FA chief executive Mark Bullingham said their aim had been to name a new incumbent “as soon as possible”.\n\n“Our Uefa Nations League campaign starts in September and we have an interim solution in place if it is needed,” he added.\n\nEngland travel to Dublin on September 7 (5pm BST) and host Finland three days later (7.45pm) at Wembley, where they will then host Greece on October 10 (7.45pm).\n\nNext England manager: Lee Carsley stats\n\nNow 50, Carsley started his playing career at Derby County in 1994, helping the Rams reach the Premier League two seasons later.\n\nBlackburn Rovers paid £3.4 million for his services in 1999, only to suffer relegation from the top flight and fail to regain promotion the following year despite Carsley scoring 11 goals in his second season.\n\nA move to Coventry City for £2.5m in December 2000 also resulted in relegation from the Premier League, with Carsley leaving the Sky Blues in February 2002.\n\nHe became a Premier League regular during almost 200 appearances for Everton across six years before switching to Birmingham City in 2008.\n\nBirmingham-born Carsley became club captain and won the Players’ Player of the Season award in 2008-09, finishing his career with a spell as Coventry skipper in 2010-11.\n\nEligible for the Republic of Ireland through his grandmother, Carsley’s 40 caps included one appearance at the 2002 Fifa World Cup.\n\nAs a coach, Carsley had caretaker periods in charge of Coventry in 2012 and 2013 and was development manager at Brentford, where he won the Championship Manager of the Month award during a temporary reign as head coach between September and November 2015.\n\nCarsley moved on to coach at Birmingham and spent 13 days as caretaker manager of the Blues following Harry Redknapp’s exit in September 2017. England made him their under-20s boss three years later, and he has been in charge of their under-21s since July 2021."
