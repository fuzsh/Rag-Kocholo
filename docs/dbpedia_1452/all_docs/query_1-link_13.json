        "text": "Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag says he is taking charge of the club’s reserve side in a bid to instill more cooperation at Old Trafford.\n\nTen Hag believes that United’s reserve team — their Under-21 side — was “isolated” before he joined last summer.\n\nAnd the Dutchman explained to Voetbal International last month that he spoke to United football director John Murtough about overseeing the reserve team as part of the negotiations which brought him to Manchester.\n\nTen Hag said: “For me, cooperation between all the different departments is crucial to get the right culture in a club. Like at Ajax, when I entered Manchester United the reserve team was isolated.\n\n“It was no longer really part of the academy, but it wasn’t part of the first team either. I changed that immediately — just as I did when I entered Amsterdam.\n\n“At Ajax, the reserve team came under the responsibility of the manager. That was the only way I could have influence on the flow of young, talented players towards the first team.”\n\nThe idea at United is that Ten Hag will be a leading voice on which younger players train with the first team and which are available for youth games, rather than him actually picking the team itself.\n\nTen Hag has a good relationship with Travis Binnion and Mark Dempsey — who share Under-21s job. Dempsey was with Ten Hag in Spain for the set of friendlies they played before the resumption of the Premier League season.\n\n“Of course I still give the coaches freedom to work, but I also give them direction, by saying for example ‘I want that player to start making minutes in that position’,” Ten Hag added.\n\n“So the final responsibility lies with me about how the second team performs and the flow of players that goes from the reserve team to the first team.”\n\nAt Ajax, Ten Hag’s previous club, the reserve side — Jong Ajax — compete in the second tier of Dutch football. In England, however, United’s Under-21s play in the Premier League 2, a league consisting entirely of teams of that age group. They also take part in the Papa John’s Trophy.\n\nThe United Under-21s have only won once in 12 league games this season and are 11th of 14 teams in the Premier League 2 Division 1.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nErik ten Hag wants a forward - after missing out on Gakpo, who will United turn to?\n\nSeveral players from that side have been involved in the first-team set-up this season, most notably 18-year-old Alejandro Garnacho who has made 11 senior appearances so far this season.\n\n“I talked to (director of football) John Murtough about this at length before I came to Manchester and he set it up in such a way that I can work this way here too,” Ten Hag added.\n\n“In the Netherlands, I had made the step towards taking more of a managerial role at Ajax. If you don’t have competent people around you, you can’t delegate and you’re going to do it all yourself anyway.\n\n“But if you do have competent people, you have to bring them into your vision and then you can delegate tasks. An example is the training process with the senior team. I know this is in good hands with (first-team coach) Mitchell van der Gaag.\n\n“Because he is at the training sessions, I can often take an overview view. Then, as a manager, you see a lot more than if you are working on the training exercises yourself.”\n\nUnited’s first team are flying high in the Premier League after a 1-0 win at Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday saw them move up to fourth. Ten Hag’s side face Bournemouth on Tuesday for their next fixture.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nArsenal excellent, Tottenham flawed: When the 'Big Six' splash the cash, has it worked?\n\n(Photo: Getty Images)"
