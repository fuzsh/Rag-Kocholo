        "text": "Clint Dempsey joined Fulham in January 2007 from New England Revolution after being granted a work permit. The Cottagers had tabled a bid of $4 million, then the largest amount ever offered for an MLS player.\n\nA versatile player with good technical skill and the ability to run at defenders, Dempsey is a USA international who made his name in MLS with the Revolution. He caught the eye after a spectacular first season in which he played in 24 of 30 games and finished the season with seven goals scored and was named MLS Rookie of the Year for 2004.\n\nAfter the 2006 World Cup, where he scored his side's only goal against Ghana, Dempsey won the highest individual honour in USA football when he was named Honda Player of the Year for 2006. Long rumoured to be keen on a move to Europe, he trained with PSV, who had USA international DaMarcus Beasley on their books, but didn't impress enough to warrant a move.\n\nIn August 2006, Charlton offered $1.5 million for the player, which was turned down by MLS, but it prompted Dempsey to state he would not be staying in the league once his contract expired at the end of 2007, regardless of salary.\n\nInstead, he chose Fulham and played a key role in the Cottagers' escape from their relegation scrap in the 2007-08 season. Emerging as one of the club's top players, Dempsey's form helped the side to cement their place in the Premier League and was a key part of their run to the Europa League final in 2010, becoming the first American to appear in a major European final.\n\nOne of the first names on Mark Hughes' team sheet in the 2010/11 season, Dempsey became Fulham's all-time highest Premier League goalscorer when he grabbed a brace in the Cottagers' 3-0 win over Bolton in April, and was voted fans' player of the season.\n\nSuch success naturally attracted attention from the Premier League's bigger clubs, with Liverpool involved in a long-term courting process in their bid to bring Dempsey to Anfield at the end of another stellar season from the American, who scored 23 goals for Fulham. But with the Reds failing to match the Cottagers' valuation of the the forward despite his interest in a move to Merseyside, Dempsey opted to cross London to join Tottenham on the final day of the August transfer window.\n\nStrengths: A great dribbler, Dempsey has excellent vision and provides chances for team-mates in the final third.\n\nWeaknesses: Not the strongest of players, he sometimes does not have the impact on a game that his talent dictates.\n\nCareer high: Scoring important goals, particularly a stunning chip against Juventus, and helping Fulham to the final of the Europa League in 2010.\n\nCareer low: Failing to get a move to PSV after training with the club.\n\nStyle: Technical, creative, an attacking force on the flanks.\n\nQuote: \"The European success with Fulham was beyond anything we dared to imagine.\" Clint Dempsey. June 2010."
