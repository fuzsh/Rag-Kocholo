        "text": "On Wednesday, Seattle Sounders forward Clint Dempsey, 35, retired from professional soccer, ending his legendary 15-year career.\n\nThe Nacogdoches, Texas, native will go down as arguably the greatest U.S. soccer player ever and leaves the sport tied for the most goals in U.S. Soccer history with 57. He is second in Sounders history with 57 goals.\n\nDempsey is the only American to score in three World Cups. His legacy abroad includes a prowess for net that resulted in 72 goals for English Premier League sides Fulham and Tottenham Hotspur from 2006-13.\n\nâAfter a lot of thought, my family and I have decided that this is the right time for me to step away from the game,â said Dempsey. âIâd like to thank all of the teammates, coaches and support staff that Iâve worked with throughout my career. It has always been my dream to make it as a pro. Iâm grateful to have been on this ride. I would like to thank all of the fans who have supported me throughout my career with the New England Revolution, Fulham, Tottenham, Seattle Sounders and the U.S. menâs national team. Yâall have always made me feel at home, and it is something that I will always remember.â\n\nOne of the best ways that former United States menâs national team Head Coach Bruce Arena could describe Dempsey was, âHe tries s---.â\n\nArena gave Dempsey his first taste of the international stage in 2004 as a 21-year-old in a FIFA World Cup Qualifying match against Jamaica, five days after he was named MLS Rookie of the Year. All he would do next is don the U.S. kit 140 more times, score 57 goals and add 21 assists.\n\nOften reserved, at times enigmatic and nothing if not productive, Dempsey brought a creative flair no U.S. player had ever had and a chip on his shoulder the size of Texas. The fiery forward was fueled by motivation. He grew up in a trailer park in the backyard of his grandparentsâ house. He played pick-up with his bare feet on dirt fields. Goals were made up of T-shirts and rolled up socks.\n\nDempseyâs parents sacrificed everything for him to play. They commuted six hours round trip to Dallas, so he could play with the Texans, a renowned youth club. Dempsey and his four siblings split one meal when they dined out. His sister, Jennifer, passed away when he was 12. He recognized her every time he scored.\n\nFrom small Division I college Furman to the New England Revolution, from Fulham to Tottenham, from the Sounders to the USMNT, Dempsey succeeded everywhere he went. It was part skill, part swagger and all American.\n\nâAs far as Iâm concerned, Clint Dempsey is the greatest player in the history of our country,â said Sounders FC General Manager & President of Soccer Garth Lagerwey. âHis mark on both our club and the United States menâs national team is indelible, and his hard-earned reputation as a trailblazer for our nation in Europe helped pave the way for generations of future of Americans abroad.â\n\nIn 2006, Dempsey released a rap video called âDonât Tread,â a song littered with calls for respect. The U.S. Soccer community embodied that message. It embraced it as its own on its continual quest for more recognition on the world stage. There had never been an American abroad with as much success as Dempsey. He nearly single-handedly shifted a narrative. Not only could Americans play overseas, they could thrive.\n\nDempsey scored 60 goals in all competitions for Fulham from 2007-12. Fulham twice named him Player of the Season. He led the Cottagers to the UEFA Europa League Final in 2010. He finished fourth in the EPL in scoring with 17 goals during the 2011-12 season. Success with Fulham led Dempsey to Spurs in 2012, and he scored 12 more goals the following season.\n\nDempsey was the most decorated American abroad, which made his homecoming all the sweeter.\n\nâWhen Clint arrived in Seattle in 2013, in many ways it was a defining moment for our club,â said Sounders FC Owner Adrian Hanauer. âHis signing represented a new era in Major League Soccer, allowing our countryâs most accomplished player to return home and drive the game to new heights domestically. Five years later, thereâs no doubt in my mind that Clint helped us achieve that, both on the field surrounding our clubâs success over the past several seasons, and in our community.â\n\nClint Dempsey scores against Portland | Dan Poss\n\nDempsey scored 57 goals in his five years with the Sounders. He was twice an All-Star. He won every trophy available: 2016 MLS Cup, 2014 Supportersâ Shield, 2014 U.S. Open Cup. He was as much a face of the Sounders as he was the league as a whole. In 2016, a heart condition ended his season early and could have ended his career. Dempsey returned stronger than ever a season later, leading the Sounders in goals and earning 2017 Comeback Player of the Year honors.\n\nOn Wednesday, Dempsey walked away from the game of soccer, but what heâs done, and what heâs left behind, remains. He will live in the annals of U.S. Soccer. He will be fondly remembered as a pioneer, breaking down American soccer stereotypes, and he did it all his way.\n\nHe once said all he wanted to do was score goals and go fishing. Now, he has more time for the latter. He has more time to spend with his wife and four children. In 2004, he came quietly onto the scene, just a kid from Nacogdoches out to prove a point. And in 2018, he walks away just as quietly, having done just that.\n\nClint Dempsey tried s---, and everyone is better off because of it.\n\nThank you, Deuce."
