        "text": "Manchester United U21 coach Mark Dempsey is delighted with the progress of Dan Gore.\n\nGore impressed in Friday's 1-1 draw with Arsenal at Old Trafford.\n\nDempsey told the Manchester Evening News: \"He [Gore] was really good. I think he's a proper footballer, good with the ball, good without the ball, and he can travel with it. His final pass has to improve for me, that's the last bit for him, but the rest is great.\n\n\"I like to see him play football because he's one of them to get fans off their seats. He smashes into people, technically he's fantastic and he's been terrific all season. He's been captain a number of times and personality-wise, he's a quiet boy, but he's a leader.\n\n\"He leads by example. He's a local lad, he loves the football club and you see that in the way he plays. Whether he's playing at Old Trafford, a three-a-side at Carrington or at The Cliff, it's the same performance from the kid and we've all got a lot of time for Daniel.\""
