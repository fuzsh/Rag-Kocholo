        "text": "Erik ten Hag welcomed youngster Charlie Savage to Manchester United first-team training on Saturday, according to the Manchester Evening News .\n\nThe 19-year-old Welsh youth international - son of Mirror Football columnist Robbie - made his senior debut for United as a late substitute in a Champions League group stage clash with Young Boys last December, and also featured on the club's pre-season tour of Thailand and Australia.\n\nWith no first-team game for United this weekend, Ten Hag made a visit to Altrincham to watch the club's under-21s face West Ham on Friday night, a match which Savage started in midfield.\n\nThe teenager was then brought off at half-time in the game, with Ten Hag asking him to join the first-team group at Carrington the following day.\n\nTen Hag had watched the West Ham game alongside his assistant manager Mitchell van der Gaag and United's technical director Darren Fletcher, with the trio taking in a 1-1 draw.\n\nAfter the match, United under-21 boss Mark Dempsey told the MEN that Ten Hag's presence was welcomed, even though it may have intimidated some of his players somewhat.\n\n\"It’s wonderful. It’s great for everyone concerned,\" Dempsey said.\n\n\"I think one or two of our players went under if I’m honest, thinking the manager was here, but they have to deal with that. It’s good for him to come and see us.\n\n\"It’s healthy for everyone at the football club. It shows that he’s interested, for the boys it’s motivational.\n\n\"Without naming them, every player that has been with them [first-team] has come back with more belief, more energy.\n\n\"You can see that they’ve learned certain things. Of course, there’s nothing better than working with those players, they are your role models are your benchmark you know you’ve got to get to. You only ever improve by being challenged.\n\n\"I think we’ve seen lots of progress. Crystal Palace game [a 5-1 defeat], they were physically older and those types of things, without making excuses.\n\n\"They were supposed to have the weekend off, but we came in on the Saturday morning and went through things\n\n\"There’s been a steady progression since then. There have been some good performances, albeit not over the 90 minutes.\n\n\"They were fantastic in the first half an hour against Everton. Then against Liverpool and Fulham, some really good bits.\n\n\"I feel we dominated it more than we have than in any other game tonight, although they sat in and allowed us to at times.\n\n\"The disappointing thing tonight was that killer edge, that killer instinct, that our football teams have always had - we spoke about that.\""
