        "text": "Roy Maurice Keane (born 10 August 1971) is an Irish football manager and former professional player. He is the joint-most successful Irish footballer of all time, having won 19 major trophies, 17 of which came at Manchester United, in his club career. He served as the assistant manager of the Republic of Ireland national team from 2013 until 2018.In his 18-year playing career, Keane played for Cobh Ramblers, Nottingham Forest and Manchester United, before ending his career at Celtic. Keane was a dominating box-to-box midfielder, noted for his aggressive and highly competitive style of play, an attitude that helped him excel as captain of Manchester United from 1997 until his departure in 2005. Keane helped United achieve a sustained period of success during his 12 years at the club. He then signed for Celtic, but retired as a player less than a year later. Keane played at international level for the Republic of Ireland over a period of 14 years, most of which he spent as captain. At the 1994 FIFA World Cup, he played in every Republic of Ireland game. He was sent home from the 2002 World Cup after a dispute with national coach Mick McCarthy over the team's training facilities. Regarded as one of the best midfielders of his generation, in 2004 Keane was named by Pelé in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players. In 2007, The Times placed him at number 11 in their list of the 50 \"hardest\" footballers in history.Keane was appointed manager of Sunderland shortly after his retirement as a player and took the club from 23rd position in the Football League Championship, in late August, to win the division title and gain promotion to the Premier League. He resigned in December 2008, and from April 2009 to January 2011, he was manager of Championship club Ipswich Town. In November 2013, he was appointed assistant manager of the Republic of Ireland national team by manager Martin O'Neill. Keane has also worked as a studio analyst for British channel ITV's football coverage.\n\nWilliam Brady (born 13 February 1956) is an Irish former footballer, and assistant manager, of the Republic of Ireland national football team. Brady was a talented offensive midfielder renowned for his left foot and elegant technical skills such as his high-quality passing, vision, and close control, which made him an excellent playmaker. Despite a satisfactory work-rate and pace, he combined such with significant tenacity, an eye for goal from midfield, and accurate penalty taking as well. In addition to his footballing ability, Brady also stood out throughout his career for his professionalism. He found success both in England with Arsenal where he won an FA Cup and Italy with Juventus, winning two Serie A titles. Brady was altogether capped 72 times for the Irish national football team.Brady went on to manage two clubs - Celtic and then Brighton and Hove Albion - together with being the assistant manager of Ireland's national football team. He also held the post of Head of Youth Development at Arsenal, and is currently a frequent television pundit with RTÉ Sport."
