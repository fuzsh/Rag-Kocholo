        "text": "“Champions are not the ones who always win races – champions are the ones who get out there and try. And try harder the next time. And even harder the next time. ‘Champion’ is a state of mind. They are devoted. They compete to best themselves as much if not more than they compete to best others. Champions are not just athletes.” – Simon Sinek, Author\n\nJCA’s Hall of Champions pays tribute to the boys and girls athletes, coaches and contributors from the three schools that make up JCA: De La Salle (1920-1933), Joliet Catholic High School (1933-1989) and St. Francis Academy (1869-1989). JCA was established July 1, 1990. Joliet Catholic Academy has announced its eighth Hall of Champions class, which continues to speak to the depth of tradition and talent on and off the playing fields that the Angels and Hilltoppers have produced over the years.\n\nNominations can be submitted via mail or email to Alumni Relations Director Sue Bebar. Please attach a biography with submission. Nominees will come from the input of alumni, faculty, staff and friends of JCA as well as the Hall of Champions Selection Committee.

After high school graduation, she played Volleyball at Creighton University. She coached High School and Junior Club Volleyball in Nebraska from 1978 through 1990. Kathy began her career in Education in 1982 at Millard South High School in Omaha, NE, as a teacher, school counselor, and coach. Kathy then moved back to Lockport where she served as Varsity Volleyball Coach at JCA in the years 1996 through 1999. In her third year as Girls’ Volleyball Coach, she took the team to a fourth-place finish in the 1998 IHSA State Volleyball Tournament. In 1997, she also took on the roles of Girls Athletic Coordinator/Dean of Students where she instituted the Angel Golf Program.\n\nIn 2004 Kathy transitioned to JCA’s Counseling Department into the role of school counselor and returned to the coaching ranks as the Angel Golf Coach from 2009 to 2013. In her third year as golf coach, the 2011 team was the first Angel Golf Team to advance to the Sectionals and the first to advance to the IHSA State Girls Golf Finals. She was the first JCA coach to lead teams in two different sports to the IHSA State Tournaments. In 2014 Kathy became the Director of Counseling at JCA. Under her leadership the Counseling Department instituted a Homeroom Advisory Program and significantly expanded the use of Naviance to assist parents and students in post-secondary planning.\n\nKathy and her husband, Gary, have three children Jeremy, Lindsey and Tyler. In 2022, they both retired to Loudon, Tennessee where they are enjoying their beautiful surroundings and the game of golf.\n\nCory McLaughlin\n\nA teacher, coach, master motivator and great friend, Cory McLaughlin made a difference every single day at Joliet Catholic High School and Joliet Catholic Academy. And he did it with humility, without ego, for little fanfare. Affectionately known as “Coach Mac,” McLaughlin was always the first to arrive for Saturday morning meetings after a Friday night football game. Coaching and teaching was more than his profession – it was his life. One that he lived fully.\n\nMcLaughlin, who taught for decades at Dirksen, started as a football coach on the lower levels in 1977 at Joliet Catholic High School during the heyday of Gordie Gillespie’s run of renowned state championship teams. He moved up to the varsity as a defensive line coach in 1984. He became the defensive coordinator in 1986, wrapping up that job for Joliet Catholic Academy in 2012. He returned as the defensive line coach from 2013 to 2021. McLaughlin also took over as an assistant wrestling coach in 1977, eventually moving up to be the head coach, and he continued his career as Ryan Cumbee’s associate coach in 2020 as the Hilltoppers emerged as a state powerhouse.\n\nA lifelong bachelor, McLaughlin dedicated his days to helping kids. He bought players meals when they needed them. He saw the best in people, never the worst, striving to make moments and memories his players would remember. In looking at how revered the JCA football and wrestling programs remain, one can point to McLaughlin as a pillar of that success. He loved the school, his fellow coaches, the student-athletes, and everything about being a Hilltopper. And that is what he will always be.\n\nLeo “Count” Michalak\n\nLeo worked at Corn Products in Argo, Illinois as a welder and supervisor for 35 years. He attended Joliet Catholic High School in 1947-1948. Leo could not play sports because he had a paper route in the mornings and evenings. He transferred to Lemont High School, graduating in 1951. While at Lemont High School Leo played football, basketball, and baseball. The team went undefeated in football and earned Conference Champion Titles. Eight team members played all three sports while Leo played as an end, punter, and was on the kick-off team. His high school baseball team ended the season with a 13-1 record.\n\nLeo coached Lemont Pop-Warner football teams from 1974 through 1989 when Jim Boyter asked him to help coach freshmen football at Joliet Catholic High School. He continued at the sophomore level, coaching football until 2015. Leo began coaching youth baseball in 1968 continuing until 1989. Leo joined the JCHS baseball staff in 1989 and continued through 2015.

Leo also gave pitching lessons to several area players. This list includes professional players Chris Michalak (his son) and current JCA assistant baseball coach Ryan Quigley. In 2002, Leo was named JCA Assistant Coach of the Year and was recognized by the State of Illinois Senate as an Assistant Coach at JCA in 2009. Among his other accomplishments, Leo is a member of the Joliet Hall of Fame for Bowling. He twice bowled his highest game of 280.\n\nLeo and his wife Janis (Grant) Michalak have been married for 65 years and reside in Lemont.

Leo and Janis have nine grandchildren.\n\nLindsey Major ’07\n\nLindsey Major was a three-sport athlete in her time at JCA, earning three Varsity letters in Volleyball, four Varsity letters in Basketball, and four Varsity letters in Softball. She was a four-time All-Area and All-Conference selection in Softball; All-State and Super 60 All-Tournament selection in Softball; numerous All-Area and All-Conference selections for Volleyball and Basketball; and a Wendy’s High School Heisman Award finalist. Major was key in leading JCA to several Conference and Regional championships in all three sports as well as two State medals in Volleyball. She also led her travel softball team, Orland Park Sparks, to two Top 10 finishes in the ASA National Championships.\n\nMajor earned the University of Iowa John and Peg Slusher Catching Scholarship as an incoming Freshman. She was named the starting catcher and a Big 10 one-to-watch in her sophomore season but suffered a career-ending injury in that season.

Randle II ’97\n\nJames graduated from Joliet Catholic Academy in 1997 where he held the single season rushing record for some time until Ty Isaac broke this record in the State Football Championship game. James’ outstanding records also include being the first to rush for 300 yards in a playoff game along with rushing for 2,600 yards in a season. James was named All-Conference, All-Area and First Team Class 5A All-State along with MVP for Team Illinois.\n\nWhile James does not like to speak about his sports accomplishments, he would like to mention that he has been in the locker room of every level of football, but his biggest accomplishments involve being the best dad to his three children, Christian (18), Journee (16) and Kayden (13). He also takes pride in being a devoted husband to his wife, Rhonda, and the best brother to his sister, LaTonya. James also wants to acknowledge his parents, James Sr. and Shirley Randle.\n\nJames and his family reside in Princeton, Texas where he is currently an Employee Relations Partner in the Legal Department at Southern Glazer’s Wine & Spirits. He is also active as a personal trainer and motivator. James is honored that JCA has considered him to be inducted in the Hall of Champions for Athletics and he professes to be a lifetime supporter\n\nof Joliet Catholic Academy.\n\nRick Thayer ’77\n\nRick Thayer’s career as a football player took him across the country, but Joliet has always been his home. And Joliet Catholic has always had his heart. Thayer, who goes by Ricky, graduated from Joliet Catholic High School in 1977. He played running back and on the defensive line for back-to-back Class 4A state championship teams under the guidance of Gordie Gillespie. After continuing to play football at the University of Miami, Thayer transferred to Carroll College in Helena, Montana. As a sophomore, he played under coach Jerry Yost at Joliet Junior College, then played and graduated in 1982 from Hillsdale, where he was the team MVP.\n\nBack home, in 1985, Thayer was the general manager/owner of T&T (Thayer & Tomczak) Restaurant and Pub in Joliet along with his brother, Tom, and friend Mike Tomczak, both standout players for the Chicago Bears at that time. Ricky then opened Thirty Buck Restaurant and Bar with former Hilltopper teammate Eric Beltzhoover. Rick’s mom, Ann, was the cook, and you’ll never eat a better meal in your life. Ricky is married to Danna, and they reside in Joliet. You can see him most hours of the day at Thirty Buck, named after one of the more famous plays in the Hilltopper football playbook. Over the many years, Thayer also found time to help as an assistant coach in football for his alma mater.\n\nHe wants to thank all his coaches, but especially Gordie Gillespie, Tony Janc, Larry McKeon, Dale O’Connell, Pat Mudron, Jim Barello and Roger Gifford. His former teammates and coaches, however, were always thankful for him. Big and powerful with a heart of gold, Ricky Thayer will go down in Joliet Catholic history as a humble champion who never lost sight of where he’s from – and the place he’s always called home.\n\nMaggie (Karges ’04) Watson\n\nMaggie was a three-sport athlete for two years at JCA and then put her focus on volleyball. She was co-captain of the first Volleyball State Title Team at JCA and joined Sports Performance for Junior and Senior years. She is in the JCA record books for aces and serve receive percentage.

Much like the Dallas Cowboys under Tom Landry were known as America’s Team, the Hilltoppers under Gordie Gillespie were the pride of the Prairie State, creating an iconic run of four straight Class 4A state championships while finishing with an amazing 51-1 record.\n\nThe first state title came in 1975, with playoff wins over Bradley-Bourbonnais (20-7), Hillcrest (20-16), Naperville Central (20-8) and Springfield Griffin (34-14). The next year in 1976 saw the only regular-season loss, followed by the same result in the playoffs with wins over Hillcrest (28-14), Lake Park (34-14), Rockford Boylan (8-7) and Danville (16-8). In 1977 and 1978, the Hilltoppers went undefeated in both seasons. The 1977 team swept the playoffs, beating Crete-Monee (42-8), Glenbard South (20-3), Woodstock (26-7) and LaSalle-Peru (30-6). The 1978 team ramped things up defensively, posting shutouts in the entire playoffs with wins over West Chicago (22-0), Rich Central (26-0), Lake Forest (33-0) and LaSalle-Peru (25-0).\n\nThat span was impressive, stunning, and historic, making Joliet Catholic the measuring stick for football programs across the state.\n\nClass of 2022\n\nRonald Boyter ’67\n\nRon Boyter was born in Los Angeles and grew up in Reno, Nevada. All the Boyters are athletes, all love sports with Ron possibly the most passionate among them. His wife Peggy says he is a true sports’ genius in his deep understanding of sports. Ron emulated his heroes, national icon John Wooden, Arizona hero Lute Olsen, and Reno coach Ken Munley, Ron’s coach grades 6 through 9 in baseball and basketball. From Ken Munley he learned that sports teach an important lesson. In Coach Munley’s words: One for all and all for one. This became Ron’s motto for his own teams. A typical day would find Ron hopping on his bicycle, his baseball glove looped over the handlebar, riding off to find a game. Love for baseball and basketball led Reno Ron to hone skills and become a fierce competitor.\n\nAs a Freshman at Bishop Manogue High School, Ron was:\n\n• Elected Freshman Class president\n\n• Leading scorer in the Jr. Varsity Basketball team\n\n• Won the Nevada Conference high school batting title\n\n• A member of the Varsity Baseball team\n\n• One of two freshmen to earn a varsity letter\n\nThe summer after freshman year, Ron played with the local All-Star Baseball team, before abruptly having to move to Joliet with his family. Starting his sophomore year at Joliet Catholic High School was a challenge for Ron. Teams were forged and bonded Freshman year, making it tough to find his place. But with the support of teachers, coaches, and teammates, Ron became an active player in basketball, baseball and football for Catholic High. Coach Gillespie was among his favorites as were Jim Gannon and Tony Janc. Matt Laurich, his coach and math teacher, inspired Ron to pursue a teaching and counseling career. Fellow player Bob Ivnik became his best and life-long friend. Teammates Pat Mudron, Bobbie Gillespie, Tom Farnsworth, Jim Adamic and Dick Dempsey left lasting memories of Joliet. Ron was the first student athlete in Catholic High history to be named 1st team All-Conference in three sports (football, basketball and baseball) in one year, his senior year, in the Class of 1967. Ron accepted a sports scholarship to play both basketball and baseball at Cochise College in Douglas, Arizona, earning 4 varsity letters, 2 in basketball and 2 in baseball. At Cochise Ron found two great loves: the Arizona desert and the beloved Carole Ann Ulrich. The prettiest girl on campus, Carole became Ron’s best friend and stead-fast partner for 20 years. They matriculated to Northern Arizona University to finish their BA’s, married in 1971, in 1972 had son Scott. Ron no longer played college ball but loved playing intramural sports and serving as a dormitory head. Transformed from a player to a coach, he received his Masters in High School Counseling from NAU. Sadly, his wife Carole left them too soon after a long illness at age 36, just as Scott was about to start high school. Her influence and love lives on. Ron’s career spanned 34 years at Sahuarita High School, in a little rural town outside of Tucson. He coached Mustang basketball, baseball, football and golf. He served as both Vice Principal and then College Counselor. These days he often runs into former students and their parents, whose respect and affection continues. Blessed to coach son Scott, who went on to teach and coach at Sahuarita, Scott married his soulmate Mary Jo, first a kindergarten teacher and now Director of Curriculum in the district. Scott coached his son Kaden, just graduated from Sahuarita High School, soon to begin college at Grand Canyon University in Phoenix. The legacy continues. Titles and stats attest to the success Coach Ronald Boyter experienced at Sahuarita. The data cannot reveal the humble man, a gifted athlete, coach, teacher, and devoted family man. Living now in Green Valley, Arizona, a retirement community adjacent to Sahuarita, married 9 years to his high school sweetheart Peggy DeChecko, Ron is busy with golf and swimming, still enjoying the monsoons in his desert home of 50 years. Congratulations to Ron Boyter on a life well-lived.\n\nDave Douglas ’75\n\nDave Douglas has been employed at Joliet Catholic High School and Joliet Catholic Academy since 1985. Over an incredible 37-year coaching career, Douglas has been a part of ten IHSA Football State Championship coaching staffs (’87, ’90, ’99, ’00,’01, ’03, ’04, ’07, ’18, ‘21) and three IHSA State Runner-Up staffs (’96,’09, ’11). Douglas served as a lower-level assistant head football coach from ’85 to ’86 and joined head coach Jim Boyter’s varsity staff in 1987. From 1989 until 2012, he served as the offensive line coach for head coaches Bob Stone and Dan Sharp. In 2013, Douglas was elevated to associate head coach and has served in that capacity until now under current head coach Jake Jaworski. His offensive lines have paved the way for one of the most formidable rushing attacks in IHSA history. The 2007 Hilltoppers set an IHSA record with 6,609 rushing yards in a season. He’s coached offensive lines that produced two of the top 20 most total yards in a season in IHSA history (6,651 yards in 2007; 6,590 yards in 2011. The Hilltopper rushing attack also holds the single-game IHSA State Championship game rushing record with 747 yards on 64 attempts in 2011.\n\nThe Hilltoppers routinely send multiple offensive lineman to the collegiate ranks, with over 100 former Douglas proteges continuing their careers at the NCAA, NAIA, or NJCAA levels. Douglas’ career in education began as a math teacher at Custer Park Grade School in Braidwood in 1980. He joined the math department at Joliet Catholic High School in 1985. Throughout the years he has served in a variety of capacities, most recently as Assistant Athletic Director. Not only has Douglas enjoyed a storied coaching career in football for the Hilltoppers, his service to the JCHS, St. Francis Academy, and JCA athletic departments may be unmatched in school history. Douglas has served as head girls basketball coach, sophomore head baseball coach, varsity badminton coach, and most notably head softball coach over this 37-year career at the three schools (JCHS and SFA combined to form Joliet Catholic Academy in 1990). Douglas guided the JCA Angels softball program from 1990 to 2016, posting a 527-367 overall record. The Angels won nine regional titles, reached a sectional final and won 20 or more games in 16 of his 26 seasons at the helm. He passed the reigns over to fellow JCA Assistant Athletic Director and Tina Kinsella in 2016. Douglas credits several Hall of Famers that he had the opportunity to work with throughout his career including Gordie Gillespie, Bob Voss, Carl Hunckler, Mel Deskin, Bob Stone, and Dan Sharp.\n\nMike Grace ’88\n\nMike Grace is a 1988 JCA graduate and former professional baseball player with over 3 years of MLB service time. Grace was a 10th round draft pick of the Philadelphia Phillies in 1991, and he had a highly successful 4-3 record with a 1.65 ERA in Class A ball that year. In the final week of the ’91 season, Grace suffered a career threatening injury that sidelined him for 2 seasons, a period over which he endured 4 elbow surgeries. Grace returned to action in ’94, and the ’95 season was a breakout year for him. During the ’95 season, Grace had a combined 15-6 record with a 3.34 ERA in Class AA/AAA, and he was named “Pitcher of the Year” for the ’95 Eastern League Champions Reading Phillies. He was called up to Philadelphia in August and earned his 1st MLB win with a 1-0 victory over the LA Dodgers on September 5th.\n\nGrace won his first 6 decisions to start the ’96 season, a stretch that included a 19 inning scoreless streak and pitching his 1st complete game shutout with a 6-0 victory of the defending world champion Atlanta Braves. On June 2nd, Grace’s bid to make the All-Star team fell short, as he suffered a season ending injury that concluded his ’96 campaign with a respectable 7-2 record & 3.49 ERA. Grace recovered and returned to Philadelphia late in the ’97 season, and in his second game back he threw a complete game shutout over the NY Yankees with a 5-0 victory, a game in which he faced the minimum of 27 batters. That game proved to be the pinnacle of his career, as the cumulative effect of his injuries deteriorated his physical skills. He pitched his last MLB game on Oct 1st, 1999, and finished his MLB career with a modest 16-16 record & 4.96 ERA.\n\nSamantha (Tortorello ’02) Haas\n\nSam Tortorello graduated in 2002 from Joliet Catholic Academy.

He passed away in 2011 at age 87.\n\nClass of 2016\n\nJane Condon – Class of 1975\n\nJane Condon ’75, St. Francis’ first superstar athlete, earned varsity letters in five different sports: volleyball, basketball, softball, track and field, and tennis. Condon led the Angels to a 27-0 record in basketball during their first two years of Interscholastic Athletics competition, which began in the 1973-1974 school year. In ’74 she averaged 18 points per game in basketball, while finishing third in the I-8 conference meet in track, and fifth in the district meet in the discus, qualifying for state.\n\nAs a senior in ’75 she led the Angel volleyball program to a turnaround from 2-10 in “74 to a 10-5 overall record. In the inaugural softball season during her senior year, Condon led the Angels to a second place conference finish, at 9-5, and tallied an incredible 59 runs batted in. ’75 was also the inaugural year for girls tennis, and Condon teamed with Gerri Kiep to post an impressive 6-1 doubles record.\n\nCondon became the first female to receive an athletic scholarship to Lewis University. A 1984 inductee into the Lewis Athletics Hall of Fame, she earned 11 letters at Lewis in basketball, tennis, volleyball and softball. Condon graduated as Lewis’ career leader in scoring with 703 points (10.7 points per game). She helped the Flyers finish second in the state in 1978-79 and is one of the greatest athletes to ever come out of the Joliet area.\n\nShe has operated 1st Choice Temporary Service, Inc. since 1991, serving the Joliet and Will County areas specializing in warehouse, office, and industrial staffing needs.\n\nSharp said, “Jane was our first superstar athlete during the Title IX era and she blazed the trail for Angel athletes to follow in the inaugural years of Girls Interscholastic Athletics at St. Francis Academy. Gordie (Gillespie) used to say Jane was always the best athlete in the neighborhood, even when competing against the boys growing up. Her support of our girls athletic program continues to this day.”\n\nPat Mudron – Class of 1967\n\nPat Mudron ’67 is perhaps one of the most powerful athletes to ever play for the Hilltoppers on the gridiron, but he was a multi-sport star during his high school years. As a senior, Mudron won the 1967 state championship as a heavyweight in wrestling, going 27-0-1 in the process. He finished his high school varsity wrestling career an astounding 100-5-3, never losing a regular season match. Mudron was a two-time All-State honoree in football, in ’65 as a tackle, and in ’66 as a linebacker. He led the Hilltoppers to an 8-1 record his senior season, before the advent of the IHSA football playoffs. For his efforts in wrestling and football, Mudron was named the Will County Athlete of the Year in 1966-1967.\n\nHe earned a football scholarship to the University of Notre Dame, where he appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated tackling O.J. Simpson from USC in a game played in front of 100,000 fans.\n\nHis success continues on in his professional life, both as an insurance salesman for Mudron Kane Insurance and as a Joliet City Councilman.\n\nSharp added, “Gordie said that “Mud” was the best lineman he ever coached. He was a tremendous nose tackle, and he remains our first and only state wrestling champion. Pat continues to give back, both to JCA and the Joliet community through his efforts on the City Council.”\n\nMark Parker – Class of 1976\n\nMark Parker ’76 quarterbacked Joliet Catholic’s first state championship football team in 1975 to a perfect 13-0 record, where he passed for 1,237 yards. A star on the gridiron, Parker’s athletic exploits also carried over on the diamond and the hard court, making him one of the first and greatest all-time three-sport athletes to don the Victory Light (Coach Gillespie first added the Victory Light to the football helmets for the 1975 season). Parker led the Hilltoppers to a 34-15 overall record in basketball during his final two years of high school, earning team MVP, All-Area, and All-Conference honors both years. His senior year he led the area in free throw shooting percentage. In baseball, the talented catcher was named All-Area in his junior and senior seasons. In his senior year he led the Hilltoppers to a tie for the Illini-Eight Conference title with Joliet Central.\n\nAfter high school, Parker went on to star in three sports collegiately as well, first at the College of St. Francis, and then at Coe College in Iowa. He was inducted into their collegiate Hall of Fame for football, basketball, and baseball; a feat unfathomable in today’s collegiate athletics climate. When he left Coe, he became the first athlete to ever have his number retired. In 1980, Parker had a slugging percentage of .923. In his senior year, he hit 13 home runs. On the day his number was retired, he hit a grand slam homer. His memorable senior batting average of .461 was down from his sophomore batting average of .538, which led the nation’s collegiate players much of that season. Mark’s was recognized with four All Conference awards, three NCAA Division III All-America selections and three NCAA All District selections.\n\nParker went on to a successful teaching, coaching, and administrative career at the high school level, currently serving as the athletic director at Dike-New Hartford High School in Dike, Iowa.\n\nSharp said, “Mark is the greatest three-sport athlete in Joliet Catholic’s history. He had a tremendous amount of talent, but it was his cerebral approach to whatever sport he was playing that separated him from the rest. Gordie considered him one of the greatest quarterbacks he ever coached, at the high school or collegiate level.”\n\nJack Perconte – Class of 1972\n\nJack Perconte ’72 played seven seasons in the major leagues with the Los Angeles Dodgers, Cleveland Indians and Seattle Mariners, finishing up with the Chicago White Sox . His best season was .294 with 29 steals and 31 RBIs in 1984 with Seattle. A second baseman, he batted .270 for his career.\n\nHe played in college at Murray State University before being taken by the Dodgers in the 16th round of the 1976 amateur draft. He’s the author of two books on baseball and the website www.baseballcoachingtips.net.\n\nJack was a member of the first Hillmen baseball team to capture an Illini-8 Conference Title. In 1972 as a senior he finished second in the area in batting average (.434) and first in steals (13). He was a two-time All-Conference and All-Area nominee.\n\nSharp said, “Jack was an outstanding baseball player at Joliet Catholic, and set the standard as the first of our eight Major Leaguers. He continues to give back to youth baseball players today as an accomplished instructor and author.”\n\nPat Sullivan – Class of 1961\n\nPat Sullivan’s name is synonymous with basketball in the Joliet area. After beginning his coaching career at Providence Catholic, Sullivan spent 35 years at the University of St. Francis, where he served as the head basketball coach, athletic director, and athletic chairman until his retirement in 2010. Sullivan led the Saints to over 500 victories. The valedictorian of the 1965 graduating class at Lewis University, Sullivan was mentored by legendary area coach, and fellow JCA Hall of Champions member Gordie Gillespie.\n\nSullivan, a 1961 JCHS graduate is a member of numerous Hall of Fames, including the Joliet Area Hall of Fame, Lewis University’s Hall of Fame, and the Chicagoland Collegiate Athletic Conference Hall of Fame. 12 times throughout his career he received “Coach of the Year” recognition from various organizations. He also founded USF’s “Brown and Gold Night”, which has featured legendary speakers from the sporting world including Al McGuire, Mike Ditka, John Wooden, Ray Meyer, Dan Hampton, Paul Hornung, and Bart Starr to name a few.\n\nJCA Athletic Director Dan Sharp said, “Pat is known as one of the greatest college basketball coaches in the country. His ability to teach the game and prepare young men for life is his strength, and he was a mentor to me and so many other great coaches in our area. Anyone who played for or worked with Pat is a better person for it.”\n\nJohn Carroll – 1926-1934\n\nA new addition to 2016 JCA Hall of Champions is the “Legends Category”, which honors one coach or athlete from the pre-World War Two era. The Hall of Champions Committee is proud to announce John Carroll as this year’s nominee. Carroll is the all-time leader in wins among boys basketball coaches with a 193-80 record, guiding the Hilltoppers to three national championships during his coaching tenure. His 1926-27 team went 24-0 and his 1933-34 team went 29-3, both winning national titles.\n\nCarroll also coached the Hilltoppers in football during his tenure, and his undefeated (5-0) 1926 squad established what will likely remain an unbreakable record; they shut out every opponent. His 1928 Hilltopper team defeated Mount Carmel 12-0 in the inaugural game of what has become one of the most intense rivalries in the nation. (information courtesy of Kirk Girlbride, “A Chronicle of Hilltopper Football”)\n\nSharp added, “Joliet Catholic prides itself on the outstanding coaches throughout our history and Carroll was the first, winning national championships in the 1920’s and 1930’s. His teams were also the first to light up the Victory Light, beginning the tradition that continues today. When competing in the national tournament, the Christian Brothers would light up the Victory Light in order to let the city of Joliet know that our Hillmen were victorious.”\n\nClass of 2015\n\nClick Here to view the entire Class of 2015 Induction Ceremony broadcast by Joliet TV.\n\nMike Alstott (’92) –\n\nMike Alstott (‘92) led JCA to the Class 4A state football title in 1990, transformed himself into a fullback at Purdue University, then was drafted in the second round by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He played 12 years in the NFL, made six Pro Bowls, won the Super Bowl, and is now coaching high school in Florida.\n\n“What you hear constantly about Mike is his tremendous work ethic,” Sharp said. “He set a goal to play professional football, and no one worked harder to achieve that goal. He worked harder than anyone else out there to be the best, and he’s teaching what it takes to be the very best to his players today.”\n\nClick Here to View Alstott’s Hall of Champions Induction.\n\nTerry Gannon (’81) –\n\nTerry Gannon (‘81), a standout basketball player, led the Hillmen to regional titles as a junior and as a senior, earning a scholarship to the North Carolina State. He won the national championship under Jim Valvano in 1983, the same year he led the nation in 3-point shooting. He’s an announcer for ABC Sports.\n\n“Terry’s a multitalented young man, and Valvano recruited him for his shooting ability, knowing the ACC was going to the three-point line,” Sharp recalled. “He also was a tremendous pitcher in baseball. You combine his work ethic, preparation, personality and quick wit, and it makes him a great broadcaster.”\n\nClick Here to view Gannon’s Hall of Champions Induction.\n\nMark Grant (’81) –\n\nMark Grant (‘81) was drafted in the first round, 10th overall, by the San Francisco Giants only days after leading Joliet Catholic to the second of back-to-back state final appearances. He pitched in the major leagues for San Diego, Atlanta, Colorado, Houston and Seattle. He’s a color analyst for Padre games.\n\n“Mark pitched one of the greatest games I ever saw,” Sharp said. “It was at Joliet West, and he struck out 20 of 21 batters. Off the field, he’s one of the funniest, most enthusiastic, happiest people. He’s like a magnet — everybody wants to be around him. He has a strong passion for baseball, people, and JCA.”\n\nClick Here to view Grant’s Hall of Champions Induction.\n\nTippy Madarik (’40) –\n\nElmer “Tippy” Madarik (‘40) played football at the University of Detroit-Mercy before enlisting to fight in World War II. He later played in the NFL for both the Detroit Lions and Washington Redskins, and was noted for his versatility as a halfback, wingback or tailback in the single-wing offenses of that era.\n\n“We have Coby Fleener playing in the NFL right now with the Colts, but Tippy was our first,” Sharp said. “His family, the Madarik name, is woven in the fabric of our school. I’ve always heard about how great of player he was, and that says something that his legacy, from 1939 and 1940, still lasts to this day.”\n\nClick Here to view Madarik’s Hall of Champions Induction.\n\nLiz Tortorello-Nelson (’88) –\n\nLiz Tortorello-Nelson (‘88) was the first star of the volleyball program. She took consecutive Angel teams downstate, led Wisconsin to the Big Ten title and Sweet 16 of the NCAA tournament, and coached at Loyola University for 11 years. She’s an athletic director at Latin and works for the Big Ten Network.\n\n“When you look at the history and the tremendous job Christine Scheibe is doing with the program, it all started with Liz getting things going as a player,” Sharp said of Tortorello-Nelson, JCA’s first female winner of the Paddy McGowan Award. “The Tortorello name is synonymous with Angel volleyball.”\n\nClick Here to view Tortorello-Nelson’s Hall of Champions Induction.\n\nThe JCA administration would would like to offer a special thanks to our 2015 Hall of Champions Event Sponsors:\n\nAthletico Physical Therapy\n\nBrown & Brown Insurance– Manner & Wagner Famililes\n\nCarCare Collision Centers– Diana & Jim Missig\n\nD’Arcy Motors– Terry D’Arcy\n\nEdward Jones- Gloria & Ed Dollinger\n\nMinarich Graphics- Bill Minarich\n\nProvidence Bank & Trust\n\nRathbun, Cservenyak & Kozol, LLC- Frank Cservenyak\n\nTraditions Restaurant & Pub- Chris Adler & Mike Sheppard\n\nLaw Office of Vincent F.

He also coached college baseball at Ripon, Lewis and St. Francis for 59 years, finishing with a 1,893-952-1 record.\n\n“Gordie set the standard,” Sharp said of Gillespie, who’s in the College Baseball Hall of Fame, among others. “Hundreds of his players are in education as teachers, as coaches — his coaching tree is phenomenal. Every person being honored here has been touched somehow by Gordie. It’s amazing.”\n\nBill Gullickson (’77) –\n\nGullickson, a 1977 graduate, pitched the Hilltoppers to their first Final Four appearance as a senior and was drafted second overall by Montreal. He also pitched in the major leagues for Cincinnati, Detroit, Houston and the New York Yankees, ending a 14-year career with a 162-136 record and a 3.93 ERA.\n\n“Bill was taken second behind only Harold Baines,” Sharp said of the longtime White Sox outfielder. “That says a lot in itself. We’ve had a lot of major leaguers come out of our state championship baseball program, but Bill is probably the top one, period. He’s the one who started the run of greatness.”\n\nAllie Quigley (’04) –\n\nQuigley, a 2004 graduate, was great in three sports, earning All-American status as an outside hitter in volleyball and as a guard in basketball. She was an All-Area shortstop in softball. She holds the school record with 515 kills as the Angels won the 2003 state title in volleyball. And her basketball numbers?\n\n“I don’t know if anyone will touch her scoring records,” Sharp said of Quigley, who finished with 2,387 career points and scored a single-game best 49 against St. Viator. “She comes from a great Joliet family, she had a terrific college career at DePaul, and continues to shine with the Chicago Sky of the WNBA.”\n\nJim Stefanich (’59) –\n\nStefanich, a 1959 graduate, joined the PBA Tour in 1965 and bowled a 300 game in the 1974 Midas Open, which was televised live. He won the first of seven ABC titles at the age of 22, won 14 titles in a 24-year career, and was named to the PBA Hall of Fame in 1980. He went on to golf on the Senior Tour.\n\n“He’s an icon in Joliet,” Sharp of Stefanich, who made the cut in 20 of 24 PGA events over a seven-year period from 1992-2001. “When I was growing up, I remember watching that 300 on national TV. It put the PBA on the map. And he had a second career, a second act, in golf. Not many people can say that.”\n\nTom Thayer (’79) –\n\nThayer, a 1979 graduate, is a household name in Chicago because of his association with the Bears, winning the 1985 Super Bowl as an offensive lineman before becoming a color commentator for their games on WBBM-AM. He also played in the NFL for Miami and in the USFL with the Blitz and Arizona.\n\n“Tom won a state championship for Gordie, played for the national championship (1981 Sugar Bowl) at Notre Dame and won a Super Bowl with the Bears,” Sharp said. “Few people can claim that. He always has been very positive in promoting JCA, through his role in the media or by attending football games.”"
