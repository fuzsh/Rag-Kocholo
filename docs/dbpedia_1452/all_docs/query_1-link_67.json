        "text": "Brian Gabriel joined the Monmouth football coaching staff in 2004 and was promoted to Run Game Coordinator prior to the 2019 season. Gabriel also serves as Monmouth's offensive line coach; a unit which has churned out 43 all-conference selections, including at least one honoree in every season. The 2024 season will be Gabriel's 21st on the sidelines at Monmouth University.\n\nThe position of offensive line has been a significant strength of the Monmouth football program year in and year out. Gabriel has mentored 25 first team all-conference selections, while a total of 21 national honors have been awarded to Monmouth offensive lineman, including AP All-American selections Alex Thompson (2017 - second team) and AJ Farris (2019 - third team). Farris was a two-time Rimington Trophy Award winner at the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) level in 2020-21 and 2021.\n\nThe 2023 season saw Monmouth's offense continue its success from the 2022 campaign. The Hawks ranked 12th in total offense (431.5 ypg) and 13th in scoring offense (32.5 ppg) thanks in large part to a pair of consensus First Team All-Americans in running back Jaden Shirden and wide receiver Dymere Miller. Shirden finished third in the Walter Payton Award voting after leading the country in rushing for the second consecutive season (134.4 ypg) and once again headlined Monmouth's CAA award winners as the Offensive Player of the Year, running behind Second Team All-CAA offensive lineman Greg Anderson and Third Team selection Tyler Williams.\n\nMonmouth's offense did not miss a beat in its first season in the Colonial Athletic Association in 2022, highlighted by the emergence of Jaden Shirden, a consensus All-American selection at running back. Shirden finished third in the Walter Payton Award voting after he led the entire country in rushing at the end of the regular season, including FBS running backs, with 1,722 yards. Paving the way for Shirden on the offensive line were Greg Anderson and Justin Szuba, who were each were voted Third Team All-CAA.\n\nGabriel was elevated to Assistant Head Coach prior to the 2014 season, Monmouth's first as a member of the Big South Conference. In his role as recruiting coordinator Gabriel helped usher Monmouth into the Big South era by securing top talent. As the head of Monmouth's recruiting efforts, Gabriel was responsible for organizing recruiting weekends and coaching staff areas along with the creation and distribution of MU's mailing materials. He is also responsible for the promotion of and creating materials for Monmouth's two successful football summer camps (7 on 7 Passing Camp and Football Skills Mini Camp).\n\nDuring Gabriel's time in West Long Branch, Monmouth has won four conference championships, two as a member of the NEC (2004, 2006) and two in the Big South (2019, 2020-21), and has made three FCS Playoff appearances (2017, 2019, 2020-21).\n\nGabriel arrived at Monmouth after a two-year coaching stint at his alma mater Siena College. He served as offensive line coach for the Saints and was also responsible for game planning and offensive scouting, as well as all aspects of recruiting.\n\nWhile a student at Siena, Gabriel enjoyed an outstanding playing career as a four-year starter on the offensive line. During his senior season, he served as a tri-captain.\n\nA New Jersey prep product, Gabriel was a three-sport athlete at Pascack Valley High School. He earned three varsity letters as a member of the PVHS football squad. Gabriel was named team captain for the North Squad at the 1998 All-County game and he also earned the Talamo Award for outstanding academic and athletic achievement. Gabriel and his wife, Katie along with their daughter Teegan and son Nolan reside in Wall Township.\n\nThanks for visiting !\n\nThe use of software that blocks ads hinders our ability to serve you the content you came here to enjoy.\n\nWe ask that you consider turning off your ad blocker so we can deliver you the best experience possible while you are here.\n\nThank you for your support!"
