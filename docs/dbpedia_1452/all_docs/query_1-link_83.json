        "text": "Here are the top 15 stories everyone's talking about this morning:\n\n1. IMPACT WELCOME BACK BIG GUNS\n\nThe match is one of the highlights of the MLS Labor Day weekend slate: The Montreal Impact take on the Chicago Fire (Saturday, 8 pm ET, MLS LIVE) in a match that will mark Mauro Biello’s first game in charge as interim head coach. He looks set to have both Didier Drogba and Ignacio Piatti available after injury. However, even with those two on the on the field, the Impact still have to find a way past in-form Fire 'keeper Sean Johnson.\n\n2. SOUNDERS RUN THE NUMBERS\n\nMichael Bradley and Clint Dempsey passed on the USMNT match against Peru to play in Saturday night's match at CenturyLink as the Seattle Sounders prepare to face Toronto FC (10 pm ET, TSN2 and MLS LIVE). The Sounders have done the math on what they feel they need from their remaining games in order to secure a playoff spot. But are they also already looking at new transfer targets? Toronto FC, meanwhile, have to find a way to win without Sebastian Giovinco, the injured Italian who was just voted the Etihad Airways Player of the Month for August.\n\n3. CAN THE QUAKES MAKE IT FIVE IN A ROW?\n\nThe San Jose Earthquakes will be looking to win a fifth game in a row when they take on the Philadelphia Union on Saturday (10:30 pm ET, MLS LIVE). With their playoff hopes fading, the Union will be missing the league's leading assist man -- head coach Jim Curtin offers an interesting perspective on Cristian Maidana’s disciplinary incident, which resulted in suspension.\n\n4. CREW SC AIM TO IMPRESS\n\nColumbus Crew SC's constant team evaluation led to them making some of the biggest signings in team history this year. It's no wonder the club feels the responsibility to put on a show when they take on FC Dallas on Sunday (7 pm ET, FOX Sports 1 and FOX Deportes in the US, MLS LIVE in Canada).\n\n5. RED BULLS REVEL IN NEW VIBE\n\nRed Bulls general manager Ali Curtis receivied a standing ovation at the team's recent town hall meeting, and talked about how things have changed over the last few months. Yet it seems his side may not be done with new additions either, with a Philippines international joining former Jamaican Under-17 international Junior Flemmings on trial at the club.\n\n6. KREIS COMMITTED TO HIS COMMENTS\n\nWhile things are going great for the Red Bulls right now, rivals New York City FC are still trying to find their way on the field, with head coach Jason Kreis doubling down on some of the criticism he aimed at his squad. Here's an interesting NYCFC fact: One of the club's DPs is now officially in the Guinness Book of World Records.\n\n7. ORLANDO KEEP CHASE ALIVE\n\nOrlando City may currently sit in playoff position, but they still have a lot of work ahead of them beginning this Saturday against the New England Revolution at Gillette, where the match will be played on grass (7.30 pm ET, MLS LIVE). And while Orlando 'keeper Tally Hall has some ideas about what his team needs to do in order to reach the postseason, who will step up for Kaká to help them get a result?\n\n8. US READY FOR PERU AT RFK\n\nThe US national team take on Peru at RFK stadium tonight (7 pm ET, Fox Sports 1, UniMas and UDN) and, as Jurgen Klinsmann’s squad starts to take shape, ex-New York Red Bulls defender Tim Ream is hoping to solidify his position with the team. Will possession be key to the US getting a result?\n\n9. IS THERE A MISUNDERSTANDING?\n\nSpeaking exclusively to the Washington Post prior to Friday's game, Klinsmann opened up on a variety of topics, including suggesting that \"a lot of people don't\" understand what really happened at the Gold Cup, where the USA were ousted at the semifinal stage.\n\n10. CANADA SET FOR QUALIFIER\n\nCanada face Belize in the first leg of their third round World Cup Qualifier tonight (7:30 pm ET, TLN and CanadaSoccer.com) and before the match, Canadian Soccer is set to honor MLS legend Dwayne De Rosario for his contributions to the national team.\n\n11. WILL JOHNSON OUT TO SILENCE CRITICS\n\nWill Johnson is set to make his return to the Canadian side tonight, with the Portland Timbers midfielder keen to answer some of the critics who have questioned his commitment to the national team.\n\n12. YOUTH TEAMS GAIN EXPERIENCE\n\nIt was a tough day for the US youth teams, as the U23s lost 1-0 to England’s U21 side and the U20s lost 3-1 to host nation Serbia in the first match of the Stevan Vilotic Tournament. However, as the U17s continue their preparations for the World Cup, they managed to secure a 1-1 draw against Australia.\n\n13. MIXED FORTUNES IN ASIA\n\nThursday proved an interesting day for MLS’ international players. Justin Meram scored his first goal for Iraq in a win over Chinese Taipei, but AJ DeLaGarza and Guam, with their large number of US-born players, ended up losing out to Iran in a heavy 6-0 defeat.\n\n14. SAN ANTONIO SELLING STADIUM?\n\nWhile the San Antonio Scorpions continue to be linked with new ownership and a possible move to MLS, according to a new report there are parties interested in simply buying the team’s Toyota Field stadium, one of whom is apparently interested in fielding a USL team in the venue.\n\n15. RAMOS REMEMBERS THE BEGINNING\n\nJust how far has Major League Soccer come over the last 20 years? Let former MetroStars player and current US U20 head coach Tab Ramos talk you through his first experiences in the league."
