        "text": "Manchester United midfielder Charlie Savage made his Wales Under-21 debut in last night’s 2-0 defeat to Austria.\n\nThe 19-year-old was handed his under-21 bow by Young Dragons boss Matthew Jones.\n\nSavage played 66 minutes of the clash at the Stadion Hohe Warte, and he came off when his side were trailing 1-0.\n\nDonning the number 11 jersey, Savage had previously represented Wales up to under-19 level.\n\nThe Manchester United academy graduate shared a picture of him alongside his international teammates prior to kick off on his Instagram story with the message “Always a special feeling to represent your country.”\n\nCharlie Savage makes Wales Under-21 debut\n\nAfter impressing on Erik ten Hag’s first pre-season tour as manager of Manchester United, Savage has enjoyed a fruitful couple of months with the Red Devils.\n\nHaving started all six Premier League 2 clashes for United’s Under-21s side under Mark Dempsey, the Welshman will be hoping to impress Ten Hag with his performances at academy level.\n\nMORE UNITED STORIES\n\nThe talented left footer has regularly trained with the United first team at Carrington, and the invaluable experience he picked up on the pre-season tour will only benefit his development.\n\nLike his good friend Zidane Iqbal, the pair are patiently waiting to earn their second first team appearance for the Red Devils having made their debuts under former interim boss Ralf Rangnick, back in December, in the Champions League dead rubber against Young Boys.\n\nNeither Iqbal or Savage were loaned out during the summer, despite both attracting interest, but United’s stance could change during the January transfer window.\n\nWith nine games to be played during a jam packed October before the World Cup kicks off in November, Savage will be pushing to feature in either the Europa League or Carabao Cup – with United scheduled to face Aston Villa in November.\n\nEthan Wheatley makes England Under-17s debut\n\nManchester United Under-18s striker Ethan Wheatley made his England Under-17s debut in the Young Lions’ 5-0 defeat to Poland.\n\nFellow Manchester United youngster Finley McAllister played the first half of the defeat.\n\nWheatley, 16, scored his first goal for United’s Under-18s in a 3-0 win against Nottingham Forest on the opening day of the season."
