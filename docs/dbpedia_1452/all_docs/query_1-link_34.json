        "text": "FOXBOROUGH, Mass. – The New England Revolution today claimed midfielder and club legend Shalrie Joseph in the Waiver Draft, and he has been added to the team’s roster. Per club policy, further contract details were not released.\n\nJoseph, 35, re-joins his original MLS club after spending the last year and a half with Chivas USA and Seattle Sounders FC. Originally drafted by the Revolution in 2002 out of St. John’s, Joseph signed with the Revolution ahead of the 2003 season and played nine and a half seasons in Foxborough until he was traded to Chivas USA in August 2012.\n\nAfter playing the remainder of the 2012 season with the Goats, Joseph was traded to Seattle in February 2013. Seattle waived him earlier this year after he made 10 regular-season and two postseason appearances last year.\n\nJoseph has made 283 career appearances in MLS – including a Revolution-club record 261 appearances. He has scored 40 career goals and added 35 career assists in the regular season, including 37 goals (to rank fourth in the club’s records) and 34 assists (to rank third in the club’s records) in New England. Joseph was a finalist for the 2009 MLS Most Valuable Player award, and was a four-time MLS Best XI selection and an eight-time MLS All-Star selection.\n\n2011: A 2011 MLS All-Star. Made 32 starts in the central midfield for the Revs. Scored a team-high eight goals, matching his previous career high from 2009, and recorded one assist. Four of his goals were from the penalty spot to tie for second in MLS in the category in 2011. Tied for eighth in MLS in fouls suffered with 54 in 32 games. Scored his first goal of the 2011 season in the third minute at LA (March 20), the second-earliest goal to start a season in team history. Converted a penalty-kick attempt against D.C. United (March 26) after assisting on Zack Schilawski’s earlier goal. Missed the Houston game (April 17) while serving a red-card suspension after he was ejected from the Real Salt Lake game (April 9). Knotted the score in the 72nd minute against Sporting Kansas City (April 23), flicking on Kenny Mansally’s service from a set piece. His 49th-minute penalty kick against Vancouver (May 14) proved to be the game-winner. With the successful PK, Joseph moved into sole possession of first place on the Revs’ career penalty kick chart, breaking his tie with former captain Steve Ralston. Played his 20,000th career minute with the club in the 54th minute against Real Salt Lake (July 4), becoming just the second Revolution player in club history to reach the 20,000-minute played mark with the club. Also scored his fifth goal of the year off Benny Feilhaber’s free kick at RSL (July 4). Started and played the full 90 minutes in the friendly against Manchester United (July 13). Missed the Philadelphia game (July 17) while serving a yellow-card accumulation suspension. Converted a 90th-minute penalty-kick attempt at Colorado (July 23) to tie the game at 2-2, his third penalty-kick goal of the year. Buried a 69th-minute penalty-kick attempt against Chivas USA (August 6). Matched his single-season high with his eighth goal of the year against Dallas (Sept. 10). Tied Jay Heaps’ club starts record with 238 starts on Oct. 15 against Columbus, and claimed the record outright with his 239th career starts in the next game at Toronto (Oct. 22). Also tied Heaps’ club appearances record (243) in the season finale at Toronto.\n\n2010: A 2010 MLS All-Star. Made 22 starts, recording four goals and five assists. All four of his goals came in the last six matches of the season (Sept. 22-Oct. 16). Missed the first three games of the season with a right hip flexor strain before taking a leave of absence for personal reasons on April 24. Missed five league games while away from the team (April 24-May 20). Started the home opener against Toronto (April 10) and picked up an assist on Zack Schilawski’s third goal of the game. Returned to the starting lineup on May 22 at Toronto to play 90 minutes. Picked up two assists, including the game-winning assist on Zack Schilawski’s 80th-minute goal, against New York (May 29). Assisted Ilija Stolica’s goal against Philly (Aug. 28), and then assisted on Chris Tierney’s first-career goal on Sept. 4 against Seattle. Scored his first goal of the season – and 25th goal of his career – at Dallas (Sept. 22) from Tierney, snapping the team’s 238-minute road scoreless streak. Converted his penalty-kick attempt – the team’s first awarded PK of the season – on Sept. 25 against Columbus. Scored the go-ahead goal at Houston (Oct. 10) off Emmanuel Osei’s overhead pass off a free kick.

Earned MLS All-Star honors for the sixth time, but was unable to play in the match because of a bone bruise in his knee. Made 27 regular-season appearances – including 24 starts – playing as both a central midfielder and forward. His eight goals and eight assists were both career highs, and he tied Kheli Dube for the team’s goal-scoring lead, earning the team’s Golden Boot award. His eight assists tied him for fifth in the league. Wore the captain’s armband following the season-ending injury to Steve Ralston. Overall, appeared in 29 games, starting both MLS Cup Playoff matches, as well. Missed two games because of injury and one game because of suspension. Recorded either a goal or an assist in three straight games (assist at New York on March 28, assist against Dallas on April 4 and a goal at D.C. on April 17) early in the season. His goal against Chicago (May 9) snapped the Revs’ 269-minute scoreless streak. Added a pair of assists in the 4-0 win against New York (June 7), setting up Jay Heaps’ game-winning goal and Taylor Twellman’s 100th-career goal. The games at LA (July 4) and against Kansas City (July 11) capped a five-game spell he missed – including three SuperLiga group play matches (June 21, June 24 and June 28) – with a bone bruise in his right knee, the same injury that required him to withdraw from the MLS All-Star Game later in the summer. Returned to the lineup on July 19 against Chivas USA, assisting on Kheli Dube’s game-winning goal. Established a new career high with his sixth assist on Edgaras Jankauskas’ game-tying goal against Toronto (Aug. 1).

Played every minute of the Eastern Conference Semifinal Series against Chicago, serving primarily as a central midfielder but also seeing time at forward.

Started 27 regular-season matches, playing primarily as a defensive midfielder but also seeing limited action as a withdrawn forward and attacking midfielder. Recorded one goal and one assist. Collected his only assist of the 2008 season on Kheli Dube's game-winning goal in the sixth minute against San Jose (May 17). Had his penalty-kick attempt at Columbus (May 24) saved by William Hesmer, but Dube scored on the rebound. Missed his first match of the season on June 12 at Houston while with the Grenada National Team. Returned unexpectedly from international duty to start in the Revolution's 1-1 draw with New York (June 18) before departing for Costa Rica to meet up with Grenada for the second leg of its World Cup Qualifying series.

Was red-carded in the 74th minute of the Aug. 9 match against Chicago and served a mandatory one-game suspension at San Jose (Aug. 16).

Started both matches against Chicago in the Eastern Conference Semifinal Series of the MLS Cup Playoffs. Captained the team for the final four games of the year after Steve Ralston suffered a broken leg at Kansas City (Oct. 11).\n\n2007: An MLS Best XI selection at season's end. Was an MLS All-Star \"First XI\" honoree and started against Celtic FC at Dick's Sporting Goods Park in July.

Voted Revolution Most Valuable Player by the New England soccer media. Considered by most observers to have been the MLS Select team's best player in the Trofeo Santiago Bernabeau match at Real Madrid on August 23.

Recorded his first-career two-goal game against the MetroStars at Giants Stadium on Sept. 17, also adding an assist in that game.\n\n2004: In his sophomore season in MLS, Joseph staked a claim to being the premier contention midfielder in the league. Started and played in 23 regular season matches and all three Revs playoffs games, registering three regular-season assists. Missed two games in June to play in World Cup qualifying with Grenada. Also missed action because of a broken nose (two games) and a hip flexor/quadriceps injury (three games). Accumulated just four regular season yellow cards despite playing an aggressive style, a testament to his good timing and tackling technique.

One week later he made his first start in Dallas and was a fixture in Steve Nicol's starting lineup from that point on, missing just one game. Finished the season with two goals and two assists for six points and his strong partnership with José Cancela in central midfield helped spur the Revs to a 6-0-1 record during the final two months of the regular season. Played briefly in goal against Chicago on July 19.
