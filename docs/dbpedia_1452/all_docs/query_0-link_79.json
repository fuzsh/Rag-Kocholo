        "text": "Fulham’s American international was undoubtedly one of the season’s big success stories. An established figure in one of the Premier League’s “unfashionables”, Dempsey was largely overlooked at the start of the campaign but gradually emerged as an irresistible Fantasy force, capable of scoring goals from central midfield, the flank and, of course, whilst deputising up front.\n\nDempsey’s versatility makes him a prize asset for his club and, in Fantasy terms, also means that he’s likely to feature as the spearhead for several matches. This season he capitalised on that opportunity in some style, firing four goals in a three-match stretch as Russian striker Pavel Pogrebnyak sat on the sidelines. That spell, more than any other, tempted big investment, whilst a double Gameweek and a newfound ability to convert direct free-kicks, saw him edge towards essential status by the campaign climax.\n\nThe Statistics\n\nDempsey’s early season form hardly hinted at what was to come. As Martin Jol’s side stuttered, so Dempsey struggled in tandem, firing just a single goal and assist in his first six league starts as Fulham went without a win.\n\nThe Cottagers first victory arrived in style, with a 6-0 thrashing of QPR. Dempsey struck his second of the season in that game, but still reached Gameweek 9 with just two goals and three assists to his name: hardly the form of a player who was to emerge as the leading Fantasy midfielder.\n\nThe 2-0 away win over Wigan in Gameweek 10 was to start a run of 14 matches which saw Dempsey notch nine goals, including a hat-trick in the 5-2 win over Newcastle at the Cottage in Gameweek 22. By that point, the American’s ownership and price at last began to rise, having remained stable at his initial cost of 8.5. It immediately jumped to 8.8 following those three goals and would go on climbing to peak at 9.8 by Gameweek 37.\n\nDempsey ended last term with a run of seven goals in his final 11 league starts as he totalled an incredible 17 goals for the season. With seven assists and 22 FPL bonus points to his name, Dempsey saw off the claims of Tottenham’s Gareth Bale and City’s David Silva to establish himself as the top scoring Fantasy midfielder.\n\nWith a previous best of 12 goals and three assists, Dempsey had elevated himself into the heavy-hitter bracket. He was owned by 18% of FPL managers by the end of the campaign and had etched himself on our pre-season watchlists for 2012/13.\n\nThe Prospects\n\nDempsey’s future at Fulham is now critical, both to the West London club and to his prospects in Fantasy terms. Understandably, the suitors are circling Craven Cottage right now, eager to acquire the services of a midfielder who can raid the penalty box with such effect. Dempsey is a precious commodity and Martin Jol’s top priority this summer will be to keep him at the club.\n\nWith Moussa Dembele also attracting interest from the Premier League’s finest, Jol could see his midfield dismantled if the cheque books start to flutter big money in their direction.\n\nFor Fantasy managers, we need Dempsey to sit tight. We’re set to see the FPL push him into the upper echelons of the midfield price list, with a figure in the region of 10.0 perhaps likely. That would be reason enough to overlook Dempsey’s lure but, should he also end up a small fish in a big pond at another club, it could kill off his prospects entirely.\n\nAnother season at Fulham will likely see Dempsey feature in our squads when fixtures fall in his favour. Whether his price will be competitive enough to see him attract a high initial ownership remains to be seen. The suspicion is that Dempsey will suffer a significant hike, whilst also struggling to maintain the incredible standards set last term."
