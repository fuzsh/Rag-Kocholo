You go into everything game going to win but it’s an opportunity to look at every player in the squad and give them an opportunity to impress so that come September there’s a good competition for places.”\n\nIreland Under-21 Goalkeeper Josh Keeley said: “The call-up has given me motivation to kick-on. Going up and training with them and realising myself I’m in the senior set-up training with them, it’s put me one step closer. I’m looking forward to these friendlies, Croatia and England are two quality sides, it’s going to be good. These friendlies will set us up for September for those two big games.”\n\nFixture: Croatia U21 v Ireland U21\n\nDate: Friday, June 7\n\nKick-Off: 5pm (IST)\n\nVenue: Gradski Stadion, Vrbovec, Zagreb\n\nMatch coverage: Updates via @IrelandFootball on X\n\nRepublic of Ireland Under-21 Squad\n\nGoalkeepers: Tiernan Brooks (Notts County), Killian Cahill (Brighton & Hove Albion), Josh Keeley (Tottenham Hotspur),\n\nDefenders: James Abankwah (Udinese), Sam Curtis (Sheffield United), Anselmo Garcia MacNulty (PEC Zwolle), Bosun Lawal (Celtic), Alex Murphy (Newcastle United), Connor O’Brien (Accrington Stanley), Connor O’Riordan (Blackburn Rovers), Sean Roughan (Lincoln City)\n\nMidfielders: Baba Adeeko (Wigan Athletic), Matt Healy (Royal Francs Borains), Joe Hodge (Wolves), Andrew Moran (Brighton & Hove Albion), Conan Noonan (Shamrock Rovers), Rocco Vata (Celtic)"
