        "text": "Photo by Howard C. Smith/ISIphotos.com\n\nClint Dempsey has had a tremendous year, and now he's got the hardware to prove it.\n\nDempsey was named the Futbol de Primera U.S. Soccer Player of the Year on Wednesday, winning the award for the second time in his career. Among Dempsey's highlights with the national team this year was scoring a team-leading three goals at the CONCACAF Gold Cup.\n\nDempsey, who also won the award in 2006, bested Tim Howard and Landon Donovan, respectively, to garner the most votes among selected media and snap Donovan's four-year winning streak. Howard finished second in the voting for the fourth time in the last five years. In addition to the 2006 award, Dempsey had finished third in the voting in 2008 and 2010.\n\nWhat did you think of Dempsey's year? Surprised by any of the voting at all? Who else do you think had a standout year among those in the U.S. player pool?\n\nShare your thoughts below."
