        "text": "Volleyball Ireland made history yesterday as the first nation in the Small Countries Association Zone of European Volleyball to host and compete in a European Championship Finals.\n\nPool B of the u20 Women’s Championship is being held at the Sport Ireland Campus in Dublin with the national teams of Italy, Serbia, Ukraine, Poland, Finland, Czechia and Portugal joining the hosts Ireland.\n\nVolleyball Ireland President Clodagh Nic Canna welcomed guests to open proceedings.\n\n“Día dhaoibh gach daoine. Tá bróduil an domhain orm na clichí seo a oscailt innú. Céad míle failte romhaibh go léir go hEireann. Very Literally translated to English that means… God be with you all, the pride of the world is on me today for the opening of these games. 100 thousand welcomes to you all to Ireland.”\n\nThe 7 day event got off to a flying start, with a titanic battle between Serbia and Ukraine. With the Serbians coming back from deficits in several sets to take the opening match 3-1, (21-25, 27-25, 25-22, 28-26), before a stylish Italy overcame Czechia in straight sets (25-21, 25-19, 25-19).\n\nIreland’s first appearance at this level was a tough defeat to Portugal, but with some promising moments from the hosts, as opposite Avril MacHale scored well. Ireland, who have the youngest team in the finals fought well with plenty of spirit, in front of a proud local crowd.\n\nPoland cruised into a 2-nil lead against Finland, before the NEVZA team flicked on a switch. They dominated the third and ran Poland close in the fourth but it was the Poles who claimed an opening day victory 3-1 (25-11, 25-19, 17-25, 25-21).\n\nIreland will be back in action in Day 2’s final game at 8pm, whilst Italy and Portugal open the show at 1230, followed by Serbia v Poland (3pm) and Czechia v Finland at 530pm.
