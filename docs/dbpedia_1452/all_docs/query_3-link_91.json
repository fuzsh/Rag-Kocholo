        "text": "The forward arrives on the south coast after interest from several clubs in the Premier League and abroad over the last year.\n\nHe has enjoyed a breakout season, with the Republic of Ireland youth international starring for both club and country.\n\nSince he made his first team debut for Waterford, Akachukwu has amassed 35 senior appearances and also impressed at the Under-17 European Championships in May 2023.\n\nFollowing his international exploits, he notched his first senior hat-trick for Waterford in the League of Ireland promotion play-offs last season, as his side went on to reach the top flight.\n\nAfter finally confirming the move to Saints following his 18th birthday, Akachukwu commented: \"I’m buzzing. The standard is obviously really good and it’s a place I feel like I can thrive so I’m just looking forward to the season to get going.\n\n\"I’d say I want to progress into the First Team, I want to try and score goals, try to help the team as much as I can week in week out and just give it my all and see where it takes me.\"\n\nAcademy Director Andy Goldie added: \"Romeo and his family bought into the club and our vision at the beginning of last season and we're delighted to finally be able to welcome him to Staplewood having now turned eighteen years old last week.\n\n\"Having already been in with us during pre-season, he has impressed both Academy and First Team staff with his performances, attitude and humility, and we're very much looking forward to continuing to build on the great work that Mike Geoghegan and the staff at Waterford FC have done in developing him so far.\"\n\nViewing this page on a mobile device?
