        "text": "Dan Gore has made his first-team debut for Manchester United and coaches at Old Trafford believe the midfielder is poised for a successful career at the top level.\n\nThe tenacious midfielder player alongside Kobbie Mainoo as the heartbeat of the club's 2021 FA Youth Cup winning side and has made a big impression in senior training sessions. He had been included in multiple matchday squads at the start of this campaign but had not made an appearance.\n\nThe teenager made a notable impact at United’s training ground last year after a bust-up with senior striker Anthony Martial. The French striker reacted angrily to a robust challenge from the midfielder, who was promoted to United’s senior training during the World Cup last winter.\n\nGore’s challenge could have been excused as youthful exuberance, although Erik ten Hag and the coaching staff were compelled to intervene between the pair – with Martial escaping injury despite the roughness of the tackle. The French striker later apologised to Gore for his reaction.\n\nAs for the midfielder, he was told by coaching staff to tone down his challenging during training sessions – but his aggressiveness and physicality could certainly be a benefit to United’s first-team if channelled correctly on the pitch.\n\nTuesday night’s EFL Cup clash against Crystal Palace saw Gore – who joined United’s youth ranks from Burnley back in 2018 – come on as a substitute to make his senior Red Devils debut, an occasion which fittingly marked his 19 th birthday.\n\nUnlike Mainoo, Gore was not selected in Ten Hag’s side in the 2022/23 campaign but his progress impressed the Dutchman and United’s hierarchy while he was chosen to captain a young Red Devils side against Wrexham during a pre-season friendly.\n\nHave Your Say! What did you think of Gore’s debut for Man Utd ? Tell us what you think here.\n\nGore’s aggressiveness saw him dismissed just a few minutes after the break following an altercation with opponent Andy Cannon – although many believe that was the result of the official misreading the challenge, with the young United star thought to have been the player on the receiving end of the challenge.\n\nThat followed the teenager being awarded the club's Reserve Player of the Year award last season, where he has increasingly showcased his technical ability and willingness to break through the lines to complement his breaking up of the play and physicality.\n\nTen Hag has shown a willingness to integrate United’s young stars into his starting line-up – as he did during his time at the helm of Ajax – with Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho, who were also part of that 2021 FA Youth Cup winning side, now fixtures in United’s senior squad.\n\nUnited’s Under-21 boss Mark Dempsey previously told the Manchester Evening News: \"He [Gore] was really good. I think he’s a proper footballer, good with the ball, good without the ball, and he can travel with it. His final pass has to improve for me, that’s the last bit for him, but the rest is great.\"\n\nDempsey continued: \"I like to see him play football because he’s one of them to get fans off their seats. He smashes into people, technically he’s fantastic and he’s been terrific all season. He’s been captain a number of times and personality-wise, he’s a quiet boy, but he’s a leader.\n\n\"He leads by example. He’s a local lad, he loves the football club and you see that in the way he plays. Whether he’s playing at Old Trafford, a three-a-side at Carrington or at The Cliff, it’s the same performance from the kid and we’ve all got a lot of time for Daniel.\""
