        "text": "LEAGUE of Ireland players occasionally moan about ‘the magic plane’ when a former domestic star earns an international call-up not long after they move to a cross-channel club.\n\nBut since the advent of Brexit, graduates from the LOI and perhaps the Irish League, are more than likely to emerge as credible candidates for senior Ireland caps in due course. This is the natural career path for players from this island.\n\nThe appointment of a new Republic of Ireland national team manager always creates a sense of curiosity as to what changes they may make, and which players may be afforded an opportunity to become mainstays of the new regime.\n\nAs I illustrated here recently, regardless of who is given the task of managing the national team, there is a finite pool of players who are currently likely candidates to play in the games ahead.\n\nThe coach will have to operate within those limitations. There is not a significant number of potential players eligible for Ireland suddenly ready to switch to this country – so finding players ready to improve our options is not going to be easy.\n\nThere are essentially two options: Work off the panel of players coming through the underage system with foreign clubs but who have yet to break through to first team level; or else look within the resources within the island of Ireland.\n\nTaking the same metrics as I used to look at the players based abroad, I have looked at the stats for players who were in the League of Ireland Premier Division in 2023, or who are currently in the Irish League and are either former Republic of Ireland underage caps or are from this side of the border.\n\nNaturally enough, it must be acknowledged that the demands of different leagues are unique so a player who has a high passing percentage in the LOI, may not be quite as effective in another league. However, as Liam Scales has shown with Celtic, if the talent is there then it can emerge once the player settles into their new surroundings.\n\nThese figures that I will present are taken from competitive games in Wyscout, including any international underage games if the players in question appeared in them and they are in the database. For each position, I will give an explanation of how that compares with the foreign-based Irish senior international candidates.\n\nThe League of Ireland season kicks off this week so it will be interesting to see how these players perform and if there are any late bloomers ready to spring forward in their careers.\n\nIt is always worth recalling that Paul McGrath, Roy Keane, Ronnie Whelan, Curtis Fleming, Shane Long, Kevin Doyle, Stephen Ward, James McClean, Wes Hoolahan, Seamus Coleman, Matt Doherty, David Meyler, Stephen Quinn, Enda Stevens, Chiedozie Ogbene, Gavin Bazunu, Liam Scales, Ryan Manning, Alan Browne, Jamie McGrath, Evan Ferguson and many other Ireland internationals over the past number of decades have emerged via the LOI.\n\nShamrock Rovers centre-back Roberto Lopes also proved in his performances for Cape Verde at the recent African Cup of Nations that players from our system can perform to a very high level in international football if given the trust to do so.\n\nWhile some may not like the idea of home-based players making the national team squad, it is actually quite unusual for national teams in Europe to be solely made up of foreign-based players. If we look at the other League B countries in the UEFA Nations League, only Albania and Ireland did not have a home-based player in their squads in the last window in November.\n\nFor this study I have opted not to look at goalkeepers as this is a strongly stocked section of the national team, but I will include other positions just for comparison purposes.\n\nCENTRAL DEFENDERS\n\nIn the LOI last year, one centre-back seems to have stood out for his consistency and that’s Lee Grace of Shamrock Rovers. For Irish-eligible players, he topped the metrics for pass accuracy, forward pass accuracy and Pass to the Final 3rd Accuracy. His Pass Accuracy figure (88.6%) compares with his foreign-based counterparts with just five eligible CBs have a more consistent figure for that metric. Grace’s forward pass accuracy is bettered only by Liam Scales and Darragh Lenihan. Just Scales and Andrew Omobamidele were ahead of Grace for Pass to Final 3rd Accuracy so, on the ball, the Hoops defender impresses.\n\nIn terms of players to keep an eye on Drogheda’s Andrew Quinn, Shelbourne’s Gavin Molloy and St Pat’s captain Joe Redmond are all very strong performers. Emmanuel Adegboyega is now in the UK having joined Norwich from Drogheda last year and is on-loan to Walsall. At 20, he has room for development.\n\nTARGET MAN\n\nOne of the key arguments observers of the Ireland football team has made in recent times is that there is a lack of options concerning a technically strong central midfield player. The argument then is to go long to a target man striker but as my analysis shows, we do not have many options for strikers playing in the UK or abroad with those characteristics either.\n\nInterestingly, two players who were important players for Damien Duff’s Shelbourne in recent seasons catch the eye compared to their foreign-based counterparts. Sean Boyd has had his injury problems but when he is fit, the tall Dubliner has a better recovery ratio per game and a better record for aerial duels won than any of the Irish players in the top two divisions in England.\n\nThe second player to stand out, Jack Moylan, left Shels for Lincoln during the winter transfer window so his progress will be worth monitoring. Only Preston’s Will Keane has a better xG average than Moylan had with Shels last season – although Moylan did score four penalties which can skew the data. Moylan’s offensive duels won ratio of 38.1% is solid but would need to improve to get into the top half of the foreign-based players for this metric.\n\nTom Lonergan, Kyle Robinson and Jon Afolabi have all moved abroad since the end of last season. Afolabi had a very good xG for 2023 but this includes five penalties. He is now with KV Kortrijk in Belgium so he is again another player who can develop in the year ahead.\n\nDEFENSIVE MIDFIELDERS\n\nCentral midfield is an area of concern for Ireland. From a defensive perspective, the concession of goals from central areas proved very costly in recent years. Finding a player who can help protect our central defensive area is as important as looking for one who can run the game in possession, in my opinion.\n\nAcross the LOI and Irish League, some of the more effective midfielders defensively are experienced players – Drogheda’s 36-year-old Gary Deegan had an amazing year for recoveries of possession last season and it shows how hard a working side Kevin Doherty’s men are. 35-year-old Greg Bolger also impresses on this metric and Linfield’s Chris Shields – who I feel should have been capped during Dundalk’s Europa League run – is still impressing for recoveries.\n\nPlayers to watch in this area are Bohemians’ James McManus, aged 18, and Matt Healy, 21, who is now playing in Belgium. McManus also topped the LOI for interceptions from midfielders last season, so he clearly has potential. Healy also was the most effective midfielder from this group in terms of shot assists and he has done well in Jim Crawford’s Ireland U21 side in the past year.\n\nIn terms of defensive duels won, ex-Bohs midfielder Fuad Sule is showing his trademark game intelligence with Glentoran but young guns who impress on this metric are Ben McCormack, 20, who has just moved from St Pat’s to Waterford and Shelbourne’s Evan Caffrey, 20, while UCD’s Mark Dignam did well on this front last season.\n\nRegarding midfielders with clubs outside of Ireland, Jeff Hendrick (75.9%) and Will Smallbone (64.5%) were the top for Defensive Duels won, Alan Browne (4.4) and Josh Cullen (4.04) were the highest for average interceptions, Cullen (8.43) and Browne (7.7) were top for average recoveries and Smallbone (1.12) was the only deep midfielder with more than one shot assist per game.\n\nThe home-based midfield options do not seem likely to produce a solution to the international team’s problems in the short term but in the longer term, maybe the next key midfielder for Ireland will be playing at an Irish stadium this weekend?\n\nATTACKING MIDFIELDERS\n\nRegarding attacking midfielders, the data for xA (Expected Assists) is slightly skewed for players who take corners but there is no doubt that when he is in full flow, Shamrock Rovers playmaker Jack Byrne is a credible inclusion in an Ireland squad. He has been capped as an LOI player by both Mick McCarthy and Stephen Kenny and his set-pieces and eye for a pass means he can potentially work his way back into the national team picture. Graham Burke has also been capped as a Shamrock Rovers player and his stats are high across all of the markers included here.\n\nDrogheda United fans will know all about the creativity of Darragh Markey too and he had a very impressive record for average accurate passes into the penalty area in 2023, he creates more than a shot a game and he presses well. The 26-year-old certainly compares with all of the best home-based attacking midfielders.\n\nOf the younger players in this position, Joe O’Brien-Whitmarsh has moved to Southampton and hopefully will continue his progress there. Drogheda’s Warren Davis, 18, Bohemians’ James Clarke, 23, and Barry Coffey, 22, also have impressive elements to their games. On the whole, Byrne is the most likely to come into consideration for the national team if he has a good year.\n\nWIDE FORWARDS\n\nAs there are so few Irish eligible wide attacking players in the top two divisions in England and in Scotland’s top-flight, I grouped these with the attacking midfielders in the last analysis.\n\nIn terms of the LOI and Irish League, Dayle Rooney made the biggest impression last season, and it will be interesting to see how he progresses in full-time football. Michael Duffy has been very consistent across all metrics when fit and has been very close to winning a senior cap in recent years.\n\nAdam Foley is a very hard-working wide forward but is 34 now so not an option. Mark Doyle had a solid year but has now moved to American tier 2 soccer. Glentoran’s Daire O’Connor and Sligo’s Will Fitzgerald have good aspects to their game but not enough to suggest they’re ready to become internationals.\n\nFULL BACKS & WING BACKS\n\nIn my original study on foreign-based players I did not include full-backs or wing-backs as the number of options for the incoming head coach are so small it seemed pointless. However, that paucity of options means that some domestic players could have an argument for consideration.\n\nThe player who consistently suggests he is most ready to step up from the LOI is Shamrock Rovers’ wing-back Neil Farrugia. He has a respectable xA (Expected Assists) of 0.25 so essentially creates a chance that should be scored every four games and his passes to the final third are comparable with most players he is competing with.\n\nWhat surprised me was how strong Derry City left-back Ciaran Coll is compared to every other full-back in Ireland. His passing accuracy is at a very high level, while his recoveries per game average (12.71) and record in defensive duels (70.3%) shows he is one of the unsung defensive talents of the LOI. At 32, it is unfortunate that he is heading towards the back end of his career.\n\nSam Curtis, 18, shows up well from last year’s LOI stats and if he kicks on with Sheffield United in 2024, who knows how quickly he will emerge as a live candidate for the national team? Jesse Dempsey has moved to Italian football over the winter while Cork City’s Darragh Crowley’s crossing accuracy is remarkably high so the 23-year-old may be a player to monitor this year.\n\nTo compare the home-based players with their foreign-based counterparts, check the table below:\n\nAs the number of players in the top two divisions in countries outside of Ireland is so low, I dipped into League One for full-backs and wing-backs. The data suggests that Preston’s Robbie Brady still has a role to play for Ireland – especially considering the quality of his dead-ball deliveries.\n\nSeamus Coleman is the outstanding defender but has very low minutes to his name. Senior squad members Matt Doherty and Festy Ebosele are quite strong across most metrics – although Ebosele has room for improvement which experience will bring considering he was a winger up until recent years.\n\nNot surprisingly, Ryan Manning ranks very highly for passing stats while U21 squad members Anselmo Garcia-MacNulty and Tayo Adaramola are benefiting from first team football in Holland and Belgium respectively. Swansea’s Josh Key is included for reference having indicated that he’d like to declare for Ireland in recent months. Rotherham’s ex-Malahide United defender Peter Kioso may be the player who could be a surprise contender for the national team but it could depend on him staying at Championship level if his club fails to avoid relegation this season.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nCompared to the options we have in other countries, not an enormous amount of home-based players are ready right now to compete for an Ireland call-up. Shamrock Rovers stars Lee Grace, Neil Farrugia, Jack Byrne and Graham Burke are the ones most likely to be ready if needed but it will depend upon the positional needs of the Irish squad.\n\nThere are a lot of young guns who could become candidates within the next 18 months, and this analysis does not include First Division players who may have breakthrough seasons in Ireland’s top-flight in the year ahead.\n\nThe players who have moved abroad already – including Sam Curtis, Jack Moylan, Jon Afolabi, Matt Healy and Joe O’Brien-Whitmarsh – could be the graduates we end up looking back on as players we saw shining on home soil in the first instance. Of the players staying at home for the time being, James McManus is the one who catches my eye.\n\nIn terms of left-field players, could Shelbourne’s Sean Boyd be the battering ram a direct style would require? Time will tell on that one.\n\nRegardless of what happens, it is unquestionably worth keeping an eye on the LOI and Irish League for shooting stars."
