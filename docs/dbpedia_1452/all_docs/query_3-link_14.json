        "text": "The Republic of Ireland national football team represents the Republic of Ireland in men's international football. It is governed by the Football Association of Ireland (FAI).\n\nThe team made their debut at the 1924 Summer Olympics, reaching the quarter-finals. Between 1924 and 1936, the team competed as the Irish Free State and from then until 1950, it was referred to by the FAI as Éire or Ireland. During the same period, another Ireland team also existed; this was overseen by the Irish Football Association (IFA) and had previously been the sole national team for the entire island of Ireland. In 1953, FIFA decreed that for competitive matches in tournaments that both Irish teams could enter, the FAI team would be officially called Republic of Ireland while the IFA team was to be named Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland was allowed to keep using the title Ireland by FIFA in the British Home Championship (which was discontinued in 1984). The Republic of Ireland was the first nation from outside the United Kingdom to defeat England at home, in a fixture played at Goodison Park, Liverpool, in 1949. The team reached the quarter-final stage of the 1964 European Nations' Cup, where they lost to the eventual champions Spain.\n\nUnder the guidance of Jack Charlton, the team enjoyed their most successful era, reaching their highest FIFA world ranking ever at sixth in August 1993, and qualifying for UEFA Euro 1988 in their first appearance at the UEFA European Championship, reaching the quarter-finals of the 1990 FIFA World Cup in their first ever appearance at the finals, as well as making the last 16 at the 1994 edition. Charlton's successor Mick McCarthy lost out on the next two major tournaments but ultimately qualified for the 2002 World Cup, making it to the last 16, a feat repeated at the 2016 Euros by manager Martin O'Neill.\n\nThe team's home stadium is the Aviva Stadium, in Dublin, although some of their home games have been played in other stadiums across the country. Their traditional colours are green shirts and white shorts. The position of manager is currently vacant after the contract of Stephen Kenny was not renewed at the end of 2023. Séamus Coleman has served as team captain since 2016.\n\nCompetitive Records[]\n\nFIFA World Cup[]\n\nYear Round Position Played Won Drew Lost Goals for Goals against 1930 Uruguay 1934 Italy 1938 France 1950 Brazil 1954 Switzerland 1958 Sweden 1962 Chile 1966 England 1970 Mexico 1974 West Germany 1978 Argentina 1982 Spain 1986 Mexico 1990 Italy Quarter-Finals 8th 5 0 4 1 2 3 1994 U.S.A.
