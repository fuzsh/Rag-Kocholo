Kieron Dyer, Danny Mills and Richard Wright were drafted into the full England squad for their European Championship qualifier in Bulgaria, the following night. Only Dyer made the bench. Captain, Frank Lampard's yellow card against Sweden meant that he was suspended and that England only had six players on the bench. Unused substitute, 16-year-old Gary McSheffrey would have been the youngest ever England Under-21 player, but he never won a cap. This was the last match in charge for Peter Taylor, England's first full-time Under-21 coach. After securing qualification for the following year's play-off with six wins and without conceding a goal, Taylor was relieved of his duties so that the Football Association's Technical Director, Howard Wilkinson could take over."
