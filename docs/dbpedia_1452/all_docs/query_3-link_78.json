        "text": "OLLIE O’NEILL scored the goal that set Ireland on their way to the verge of history — but now they must finish the job.\n\nThe Under-21s are just one win away from reaching the Uefa Championship finals for the first time ever as they take on Italy today.\n\nNo matter what happens, they are assured of a two-legged play-off in September for the right to be at those finals in Georgia and Romania.\n\nBut Fulham ace O’Neill is sure that the Young Boys in Green can seize their moment, just as he did his last November.\n\nO’Neill, 19, came off the bench for his Under-21 debut with six minutes remaining against Sweden when it looked like all hope was lost.\n\nIreland had started the campaign by picking up seven points from their first five games.\n\nMaking it eight from six would have virtually ended any hope of qualifying for the finals.\n\nAnd then O’Neill struck with what was officially the last kick of the game.\n\nIreland won 1-0 and kicked on from there.\n\nO’Neill told SunSport: “The final whistle went straight after that but I’m told that isn’t supposed to happen.\n\n“You have to let the other team kick off.\n\n“So it is something in history that should never happen again. But it was just an amazing, incredible feeling. I don’t think I could have a moment like it anyway.\n\nBETTING SPECIAL - GET €50 IN FREE BETS WITH BOYLESPORTS\n\n“We knew we had to score in that game. But I think that game showed what we were about, we never gave up.\n\n“That is what I’ve always seen in the team, there is that mentality.”\n\nThe theme has continued. O’Neill started Ireland’s away game in Sweden, which they won 2-0, and they have followed it up with wins over Bosnia-Herzegovina and Montenegro.\n\nSuch momentum has them on the verge of making history.\n\nAnd O’Neill believes the past few months can give them belief.\n\nThe Cottagers striker continued: “We’ve won the last four but, even before that, I think maybe we were unlucky with missed penalties.\n\n“And it is one goal conceded in four games, so we’re hard to beat too.\n\nALL ON THE LINE\n\n“You have to take this chance. It’s a one-innings game, you have to go for it. I’m sure Italy are not relishing it as they have something to lose.”\n\nO’Neill’s “one-innings” reference, he jokes, is “the English in him”.\n\nBut while he was born in London, there was no choice to be made when the FAI came calling.\n\nHe said: “My grandparents are from Galway and Kerry on one side, and Waterford on the other. So it’s all four of my grandparents.\n\n“Both my mum and dad were born in London but had Irish upbringings. I suppose it’s a usual Irish story, my grandad was a builder and moved over for work.\n\n“But I go back a lot, I used to be in Galway every summer until I was 16, and I played a bit of GAA with Barna as my cousins were there.\n\n“I was back for a couple of days before this international break too, and also over at Christmas. But I cannot get over as much now with football.”\n\nHe has made rapid progress with Fulham’s Under-23s but is out of contract at the end of the month — and has attracted interest from Spurs.\n\nO’Neill added: “Pre-season is next so I’ll talk to the club. What happens might depend on a good pre-season. I may go out on loan, or stay with Fulham.\n\n“There are talks going on so I suppose there will be stuff in the papers but I’m just concentrating on being here.”"
