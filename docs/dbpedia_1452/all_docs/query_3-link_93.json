        "text": "We asked for your views on Rangers' 1-1 draw against Dynamo Kyiv in the first leg of the Champions League third qualifying round.\n\nHere’s what some of you said:\n\nCraig: Three highlights in this game were overall effort, the connection between players and of course, the goal. This \"project\" will take time but hard work and passion will get some good results in the short term. Not exactly a team in full flow but some very good individual performances.\n\nMark: I’m pleased with the performance in a tricky away tie. The new players that were introduced are showing signs of their potential. There is just a lack of cohesion at times, but this is to be expected given the squad upheaval. I was slightly disappointed in the amount of times we gave the ball away.\n\nPeter: We all malign Cyriel Dessers for many reasons but give him his due, he gets in good positions and can deliver a goal or two, but what a good goal that could be for next game.\n\nAlexander: Struggling somewhat, but let's have some faith in a decent manager and players who do not deserve to be maligned.\n\nLennie: Great result for us. We thoroughly deserved it. I can't understand why Scott Wright is getting a game for us, he’s not good enough.\n\nEmil: Good energy levels but poor technical skills, passing and lack of awareness was apparent.\n\nJack: I have supported Rangers for 70 years and this is the worst team I have seen. Dessers was the best performer and I think that sums it up. We have no midfield, a good goalkeeper and a one-man attack. Vaclav Cerny shows promise but Scott Wright, Mohamed Diomande, Ridvan Yilmaz and James Tavernier have no place in a Rangers shirt. We need a midfield general desperately.\n\nRobert: Our game changed when Jefte was introduced and Wright removed, a formula that the manager must continue with. Having natural left-sided players is proving crucial.\n\nDavid: Great result, gives us a fighting chance. What an advantage playing at Ibrox would have given us, we still need to sharpen up at the back though.\n\nGreg: A greatly improved performance by Rangers and a lot more shots flying in on target. They were lot more incisive going forward and there was a lot less of great build-up play that went nowhere that characterised the latter spell of Giovanni van Bronckhorst, Michael Beale and some of Philippe Clement. Has there been a change in tact?"
