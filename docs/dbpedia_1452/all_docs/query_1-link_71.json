Justin brings a wealth of experience that further enhances the excellent group of staff that we have throughout the Academy. Our focus on producing world-class players capable of excelling in Manchester United’s first team remains as strong as ever. Justin will work with our existing pool of elite coaches to provide each of our players with experiences that will help them grow and succeed in life and play professional football at the highest level possible.\n\n“Mark Dempsey will continue to play an integral role in providing all of our coaches with support and guidance and of course remains an invaluable link with the first-team. The new structure will further support players in making that step up to the next level for many years to come.”\n\nJustin Cochrane said: “Joining such a world-renowned Academy system is an extremely proud moment and I cannot wait to get started in this new and exciting role. From the first conversations, I could see the depth of top-level coaching talent that is already in place at the club.\n\n“I look forward to working with each of them to provide the right environment for our players to thrive and to continue the phenomenal record of developing players for Manchester United’s first-team.\n\n“I would like to take the opportunity to thank everyone at The FA for their support over the last three years, working alongside such a dedicated group of staff is a period of my career that I will never forget. Working within the national team set up to develop future England internationals was an incredible experience and I wish Gareth and his staff all the best for Euro 2020.”\n\nJohn Murtough, football director, said: “Developing young players is fundamental to who we are as a club and its importance to us can never be overstated. We welcome Justin’s appointment as part of our plan to bring the best external coaching talent to complement our existing group and further strengthen the work we are doing across the Academy.”\n\nHeads of Player Development and Coaching:\n\nJustin Cochrane – Head of Player Development and Coaching (U17-U23)\n\nTravis Binnion – Head of Player Development and Coaching (U14-U16)\n\nEamon Mulvey – Head of Player Development and Coaching (U9-U13)"
