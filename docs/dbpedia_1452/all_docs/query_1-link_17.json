United had brought in Paul McShane as their first over-aged player-coach in June last year, but he retired from playing at the end of last season and will now focus solely on coaching, as the assistant to U21s Lead Mark Dempsey.\n\nAs TGG exclusively revealed last week, David Hughes has also been brought in to coach the Professional Development Phase, having previously been Academy Manager at Cardiff City.\n\nUnited were left with berths to fill when U23s boss Neil Wood and his assistant Neil Ryan left at the end of last season."
