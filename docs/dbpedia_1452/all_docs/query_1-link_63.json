She took over the position on May 23, 2012.\n\nAs either a player or coach, Walker has participated in 19 of the last 20 NCAA Tournaments and was a part of Northwestern’s three consecutive NCAA titles from 2006-08 as an assistant coach. Heading into the 2023-24 calendar year, the Eagles' 119 wins since 2017 leads the country, while boasting six final fours, a national title in '21, three ACC regular-season titles and an ACC championship.\n\nIn 2023, BC advanced to a sixth straight Final Four and national title game after 13 straight wins. On its way to the Final Four, BC earned a third ACC regular-season title since 2018 and the program's first-ever ACC championship, ending UNC's streak of six straight titles with an 11-9 win.\n\nThe Eagles also knocked off Syracuse in the regular season finale, ending the Orange's 15-0 record and later defeated Syracuse in the Final Four.\n\nBC saw 10 players earn All-American status through at least one of three publications, while five were named an All-American in all three. Shea Dolce (Freshman of the Year), Sydney Scales (Defender of the Year) and Belle Smith (Midfielder of the Year) garnered ACC Player of the Year awards, joining three others that were named All-ACC.\n\nJenn Medjid was a top-five Tewaaraton finalist after leading the team with a career-high 83 points and 107 points. She ended her career second all-time in both categories with 252 goals and 332 points.\n\nShe has coached three Tewaaraton Award winners, 33 All-Americans and is a two-time IWLCA National Coach of the Year.\n\nThe Eagles continued to show why they're a perennial powerhouse, advancing to a staggering fifth straight national title. Boston College posted a 19-4 mark and finished the regular season as the No. 3 team in the country. North became the first player since Taylor Cummings (Maryland) from 2014-16 to collect the prestigious honor in back-to-back seasons. She led the Eags with 92 goals, a personal-best 115 points, and 139 draw controls. She was third in the country in goals, fourth in draw controls, and fifth in points. She also posted 16 hat tricks, including eight games with at least five scores. North was one of two players in the country with at least 90 goals and 100 draw controls this season. North broke the NCAA all-time goals mark earlier this season and stands as the all-time leader with 358 goals. She finished third among active leaders with 433 points and ninth with 373 draw controls. North was named the ACC Female Athlete of the Year for a second straight time and an NCAA Woman of the Year nominee. Five Eagles were named an IWLCA All-American, with Charlotte and Belle Smith earning first-team honors. Jenn Medjid, Sydney Scales and Courtney Taylor were named all-second team.\n\nBC finally broke through in 2021, winning its first-ever national championship. The Eagles went 18-3 on the season and finished the regular season as the #4 team in the country. Walker-Weinstein then led BC to an upset win over #1 North Carolina in the national semifinal, before beating #3 Syracuse 16-10 in the NCAA Final to win the title. Walker-Weinstein coached the Tewaaraton Award winner Charlotte North, who set an NCAA record with 102 goals on the year. North was also named the IWLCA, Inside Lacrosse and USA Lacrosse Magazine Player of the Year, as well as, the Honda Sport Award winner. BC had five IWLCA All-Americans in 2021 with North on the first team, Hollie Schleicher, Belle Smith and Cara Urbank on the second team and Jenn Medjid on the third team. Walker-Weinstein was named IWLCA National Coach of the Year and the Northeast Region Coach of the Year.\n\nIn 2019, she maintained her dominance, pushing the Eagles to their second consecutive undefeated regular season and ACC Regular Season title. Her Eagles shattered records just recorded in the previous season en route to their third straight national championship appearance. Walker-Weinstein produced four First Team All-Americans in Sam Apuzzo, Dempsey Arsenault, Kenzie Kent and Elizabeth Miller, as Apuzzo and Arsenault became the first pair of Eagles to be named finalists for the Tewaaraton Award in the same season. Apuzzo was named Attacker of the Year by both the IWLCA and ACC while Arsenault earned BC's first-ever IWLCA and ACC Midfielder of the Year honors under Walker-Weinstein's guidance.\n\nIn 2018, Walker led the team to their most historic season, finishing the campaign with an undefeated regular season record and their second consecutive trip to the NCAA Championship game. She once again received IWLCA Northeast Region Coach of the Year honors as the Eagles shattered records across the board en route to their first ACC Regular Season Champion title. Under her watch, the Eagles raked in numerous awards, including BC's first ever Tewaaraton Award recipient in Sam Apuzzo. A program-best four Eagles were named All-Americans by the IWLCA in 2018, as Sam Apuzzo, Dempsey Arsenault, Elizabeth Miller and Kaileen Hart were honored.\n\nIn 2017, Walker was honored as the Division I Intercollegiate Lacrosse Coaches Association (IWLCA) National Coach of the Year, as well as the Northeast Region Coach of the Year for leading the Eagles into the best-ever season in program history.\n\nIn 2016, Walker became the fastest coach in program history to net their 50th career win, doing so in only 74 games against Virginia Tech on April 16. The Eagles went 10-9 that season and earned a spot in the NCAA tournament. She also coached three players to IWLCA ACC All-Academic team, four players to IWLCA first and second All-Northeast Regional honors and two players to All-ACC honors.\n\nIn 2015, Walker led a program that cracked the top three in the national rankings before falling to Loyola (Md.) 19-12 in the second round of the NCAA Tournament in May. The 2015 season was highlighted by several accomplishments in the 2015 season. The Eagles finished the season 15-4 overall, their highest winning percentage (.789) since Walker began her tenure as head coach, while recording an impressive 8-0 record on the road last season. Additionally, Walker coached three Tewaaraton Award nominees, including the first Tewaaraton finalist in Boston College history with Sarah Mannelly while Kenzie Kent was named to the IWLCA All-Rookie Team. Three Eagles earned IWLCA All-American Status and the team was honored by the IWLCA for achieving a team GPA of 3.0 or greater under Walker in 2015. Boston College was 5-2 in ACC play during Walker’s third season as head coach.\n\nIn 2014 Walker led the Eagles to the quarterfinals of the NCAA Tournament, beating Bryant and Loyola before finally falling to Syracuse. During the 2014 season BC reached a national ranking as high as No. 4. She coached two players to IWLCA All-American honors and four to IWLCA All-Northwest Region honors. She guided the program to a 16-5 overall record and a 3-4 ACC record.\n\nIn her first year as a head coach in 2013, she guided the team to program tying record of 12 wins, despite playing the seventh-most difficult schedule in the country. She also led the Eagles to their second-ever NCAA Tournament appearance and coached BC to school records for ACC wins in a season (3) and consecutive games won within a season (8). The winning streak began with victories over then-No. 9 Virginia and then No. 6-Duke with the win over Duke marking the first time BC had defeated the Blue Devils.\n\nWalker spent the 2011 and 2012 seasons as associate head coach for Boston College. In that role, Walker served as the Eagles’ offensive coordinator and played a key role in recruiting, as well as in many other facets of the daily operations of the BC program. In 2012 the Eagles finished the season at 10-8 and 1-4 in the ACC. In 2011, Walker’s first season with the team, BC went 12-7 (1-4 ACC) and reached the NCAA tournament for the first time in program history.\n\nIn 2012, Walker helped guide BC’s first-ever ACC Freshman of the Year winner, Stanwick, as well as All-American Kristin Igoe. Stanwick, Igoe, and Rix each garnered All-ACC accolades marking the first time that three BC players earned such honors in the same season. The Eagles also set a program-record with 263 draw controls on the year while scoring 230 goals as a team - the third-highest total in school history.\n\nDuring the 2011 season, BC set a single-season program records goals scored (232). The Eagles defeated two ranked opponents - No. 7 Virginia and No. 20 Hofstra - on the season while Igoe and Brittany Wilton both garnered All-American honors.\n\nA former player herself, Walker continued to play at the elite level after her collegiate playing days competing on the U.S. Women’s Senior National Lacrosse Team from 2002-12. She won a gold medal with the team at the 2009 World Cup in Prague, Czech Republic and was also a member of the 2010-11 U.S. National Team that was undefeated on American soil.\n\nPrior to working with the Eagles, Walker was the associate head coach at the University of Massachusetts. During her tenure, Walker acted as the offensive coordinator, handled recruiting responsibilities and helped lead the team to two consecutive Atlantic-10 Conference championships. She also handled travel, budget management, video breakdown, and camps.\n\nFrom 2005-08, she was an assistant coach at Northwestern, where the Wildcats won three consecutive NCAA National Championships and three consecutive American Lacrosse Conference titles.\n\nWalker graduated from the University of Maryland in 2005 with a degree in American Studies. She played for the Terrapins and captained the team in her senior year. She was an IWLCA All American as well as an All-ACC selection. In 2005 she won the University of Maryland M Club `James H. Kehoe’ Award, and in 2004 and 2005 was a Tewaaraton candidate, the award given to the male and female Collegiate National Player of the Year.\n\nAt age 15, Walker was the youngest member of the World Championship Under-19 Team that won gold in Perth, Australia in 1999.\n\nWalker hails from Annapolis, Md. and currently resides in Boston, Mass."
