The Republic of Ireland are in Group C of the 47th running of the ‘Tournoi Maurice Revello’ alongside Bahrain, China and Mexico. Their first fixture will be on Monday 3rd June against China.

The tournament, considered the most prestigious of all friendly tournaments involving U-21 teams, has seen countless players go on to play at the highest levels of World Football including Zinedine Zidane, Cristiano Ronaldo, Cafu and Hristo Stoichkov, to name but a few.

It is the first time the Boys in Green have participated in the tournament for 17 years.

This will be Jack Taylor’s first taste of International Football and it’s another proud moment for everyone at Barnet Football Club and it’s Academy.

We wish Jack and his teammates the very best of luck.
