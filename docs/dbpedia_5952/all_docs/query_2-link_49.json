The deal is that Sylvia will get a great allowance and the ability to travel anywhere she wants. While on a trip to Paris she begins to find herself and develop into a confident, uninhibited woman. She attracts one of Gaylord's cad friends Reggie Durant (Basil Rathbone) and contemplates an \"affair.\" The film is a early b-studio talkie which is notable for its frank treatment of moral dilemmas and the gorgeous fashions and art-deco designs."
