An old-time burlesque star named Kitty gives Eddie advice: get a partner and re-brand yourself! Eddie spots fellow dancer, Rita, and asks her to join his act, which he aptly names “Eddie Kehoe and Partner.” Despite Eddie’s ego, Rita falls in love with him. However, Eddie is also the object of affection for other vaudeville performers including Cleo, leading Rita to become jealous."
