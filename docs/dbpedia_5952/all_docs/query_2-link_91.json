He had his first starring role in commercial theatre in 1949, playing Alexander the Great in Terence Rattigan’s ill-fated Adventure Story.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nScofield had his greatest success in the role of Sir Thomas More in Robert Bolt’s A Man for All Seasons, in which he appeared in London in 1960 and in New York City in 1961–62, winning the Antoinette Perry (Tony) Award (1962) and other honours.
