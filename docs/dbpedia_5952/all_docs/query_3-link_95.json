        "text": "For many years I saved a phone message from Julia Child on my answering machine. Back then, in the early 1990s, I was a television producer at KQED, San Francisco’s public television station. Despite my frequent encounters with talented artists through my work, as well as a growing friendship with chef Jacques Pépin, with whom I had been producing several seasons of PBS cooking programs, I can still remember the shiver of excitement when I retrieved a message on my office voicemail which began, in that unmistakable forceful warble, “Hello Peter, it’s Julia Child!”\n\nMy first thought was: ‘Of course it’s Julia Child! No one else on earth speaks like that. But why is she saying my name?’ The message went on at length; as it turns out, she wasn’t really interested in talking to me, she was calling because she knew I could pass along a message to her friend Jacques, who was taping shows in our San Francisco studio (this in the era before mobile phones). It ended, “Tell him I’ll be here in my office for, oh, I’d say an hour, an hour and a half…” I backed up the voicemail and replayed that last phrase, over and over. How often had I heard her use that very phrase on television, but referring to how long a roast should stay in the oven? “An hour, an hour and a half.” And now she was saying it to ME!\n\nFor years, I couldn’t bring myself to erase that mundane message. I am not generally a fanboy, but there was something about her folksy-but-refined lilt, and her matter-of-fact delivery of the eternal verities of cuisine and the clock, that I found irresistible: they were a touchstone to my own post-college years in Cambridge, Mass. (coincidentally, her hometown)—a time of my growing independence, when I learned to cook for myself and first discovered her TV shows and cookbooks. So I hung on to that message like a jewel.\n\nIt turns out I was not alone: two decades later, while doing research for the American Masters documentary I was making about Jacques Pépin, I was digging through boxes of his archive now housed at the Boston University manuscript library, when I came upon several microcassettes of audiotape stashed among his correspondence and photos. On the cassettes’ tiny labels I recognized Jacques’ handwriting – he had written only one word: “Julia.” I felt again that sudden frisson of excitement from 20 years earlier, palms suddenly damp. Perhaps these were private conversations between them, or Jacques’ own confidential reminiscences about her? I returned the next day with a handheld dictation recorder that used the same size microcassettes, and, attaching a little Radio Shack earbud, I listened to those mystery tapes.\n\nThe tapes were answering machine cassettes. On them were a few banal messages to Jacques and his wife Gloria from Julia Child. No secret interviews, no long-lost brainstorms on how to make culinary history. Just phone messages. “Hi Jacques, I know we’re going to see each other Tuesday, but we better decide what we’re going to do.” “Jacques, it’s Julia, sending greetings to you before the holidays!” In his many boxes of stored memories and accolades—including his commendations from French presidents and treasured letters from his friends Craig Claiborne, James Beard, Danny Kaye—Jacques had saved nobody else’s phone messages, only Julia’s. They were a touchstone for him too: the everyday sound of a longtime friendship and professional collaboration. (I found a way to incorporate brief snippets of those tapes into the film I made, Jacques Pépin: The Art of Craft, which includes a segment on their working relationship.)\n\nI’ve been thinking a lot about those phone messages—mine and Jacques’—since watching Julie Cohen’s and Betsy West’s new documentary Julia, which does a fine job capturing not only her professional and cultural accomplishments as a pathbreaker in the fields of American food and media, but also some of the personal idiosyncrasies and flaws that made her complex and unforgettable—someone whose voice you would want to save on a tape. It’s not only that she was a cultural icon with a famously imitated manner; she was a unique and formidable presence. I finally had the chance to meet her several times over the final decade of her life; in person, she managed to be warm, gracious, and often very funny, but with a barely disguised steely core of determination and focus—she could be flinty, a force you might not wish to cross.\n\nThat impression was reinforced over the years through reminiscences and anecdotes shared with me by Jacques and other frequent television colleagues of Julia. So I was relieved (if a bit surprised) to find that the recent documentary, while very affectionate and admiring of its subject, chose not be a hagiography, but a fully dimensional portrait that included some of her lesser-known traits: her salty language in private, her competitiveness, her occasionally retrograde references to gay men (despite the fact that so many of her culinary and television colleagues were gay). These are the warts that make people believably human, if not always 100% admirable. Jacques’ and my voicemails were the artifacts of a flesh-and-blood person, not an icon.\n\nIn my recollection of her, one of Julia’s qualities that both amused and dumbfounded me was her legendary resistance to anything resembling product placement or endorsement on her television programs. This trait could be seen as an admirable throwback to the purest noncommercial origins of public television, but it was also a sign of Julia’s orneriness. I recall one telling anecdote, which Jacques relayed to me:\n\nThe PBS series that Jacques and Julia taped together in her Cambridge home was generously underwritten by a major California winery. On one taping day, several of the winery’s top executives paid a visit to the set and were watching the recording from the makeshift control room. Each episode would generally end with Jacques and Julia tasting the food they had made and then discussing the kind of wine they would recommend drinking with the meal. I know from my own experience with Jacques that he was especially mindful not to over-emphasize California wines in our series, let alone to blatantly recommend our sponsor’s wines, but in our many series together and in the one with Julia, it was tacitly accepted that occasionally a sponsor’s wine bottles would end up somewhere in the concluding scene, if it made gastronomic sense. On this day, Jacques, knowing full well how these expensive series get funded, figured the episode might warrant concluding with a nod to a California wine that happened to come from the sponsor, who was sitting in the control room.\n\nWhen the moment arrived for the final shot, Jacques, with cameras rolling, turned to Julia and asked his leading question, “And what do you think we should drink?” to which Julia replied, “I think I’d like a beer!” Jacques froze momentarily, looked around the set, smiled, and said, “I don’t think we have beer here…” whereupon Julia reached under the table and brought out a bottle of beer, saying triumphantly, “I have some right here!” Jacques realized she had planned this little revolution all along.\n\nJulia’s fierce individualism—to the point of being contrary—often gets sandpapered away in the popular image of the folksy French chef with the clumsy hands. But it is precisely that quality that compelled her to labor for more than a decade before finally publishing Mastering the Art of French Cooking, and to shatter the many obstacles and prejudices she faced as a woman, and later a senior, on television.\n\nThe fact that both Jacques Pépin and I would separately hang on to phone messages from Julia is testament not to her fame, but to her uniqueness. Despite the imitations and spoofs, despite her larger-than-life image and her impact on so much of American life, she was, in the end, herself.\n\nWhen KQED changed its voicemail vendor, my saved message from Julia was vaporized. I was heartbroken. The jaunty message had been special to me not because it was important, but because it wasn’t: it was an ordinary artifact of an extraordinary person.\n\nThis article first appeared at EatDrinkFilms.com.\n\nJacques Pépin and I in 2015, on a break during filming of the documentary Jacques Pépin: The Art of Craft.\n\nIt's June again! So with all the usual caveats about how every one of this year's 153 films is worth your time, I am providing here a little cheat sheet of films, screenings and events I am particularly looking forward to at the upcoming Frameline festival, the fifth I have contributed to as Senior Programmer. I'm especially proud this year that 52% of all the films are directed or co-directed by women! And also that (having concentrated quite a bit on our world cinema section) we have films representing 39 countries.\n\nInternational Gems\n\nAnd Breathe Normally\n\nAn exquisite drama from Iceland that won a Directing Award at Sundance, this slow-burn feature is our World Cinema centerpiece for a reason - it's a deeply rewarding exploration of how two vastly different women from different continents forge a connection in a harsh world.\n\nHard Paint\n\nThis moody, sexy and ultimately uplifting romance is set in the gritty Brazilian city of Porto Alegre, featuring a lonely young protagonist who dances on his webcam to earn money. Hard Paint deservedly won the Teddy Award at this year's Berlin Festival for best LGBTQ narrative film -- it's terrific. And the directors will be here in San Francisco too!\n\nL'animale\n\nNot your typical coming-of-age story, L'animale introduces us to tomboy Mati and her Austrian family in a crucial moment of their lives, as she explores what real friendship (and love) mean and her parents try to sort out their complicated needs. I really enjoyed the smart script - director Katharina Mückstein will be here from Austria.\n\nMan in an Orange Shirt\n\nI worked the phones, emails and every angle hard to bring Frameline the U.S. premiere of this terrific BBC drama that charts two connected love stories set 60 years apart. Vanessa Redgrave gives a standout performance, as does up-and-coming British star Julian Morris, who will be at the Castro Theatre. Yes, this is also coming to PBS Masterpiece...but see it at the Castro first with Julian Morris in person!\n\nDelicious Docs\n\nBixa Travesty\n\nFierce, inspiring, electrifying - you won't want to miss this amazing profile of Brazilian performance artist/rapper Linn da Quebrada, a black transgender whirlwind who uses poetry to take on racism, machismo, gender inequality and homophobia. Another Teddy Award winner too!\n\nDykes, Camera, Action!\n\nAn excellent survey of the triumphs and pitfalls of representing authentic lesbian stories in films and TV, and the challenges facing queer women behind the camera. We'll follow the screening with an amazing panel focusing on queer women documentarians, moderated by B. Ruby Rich.\n\nThe Ice King\n\nI never knew the story of extraordinary British 1970s-80s figure skater John Curry, who single-handedly changed the sport by bringing balletic artistry into its vocabulary, and faced down homophobia along the way. The editorial craft in this archive-rich film is off the charts.\n\nTransMilitary\n\nOur opening night selection is a moving, timely, and important look at the situation facing the more than 15,000 transgender people currently employed in the U.S. military. Focusing on the experiences of four individuals, the personal film is told with heart and urgency, and is a vital report from the current front lines of the ongoing fight for LGBTQ inclusion in American life.\n\nEvery Act of Life\n\nThis is an affectionate and honest behind-the-scenes portrait of the Tony- and Emmy-winning playwright Terrence McNally, chock full of terrific performance footage from his memorable works including Love! Valour! Compassion!, The Lisbon Traviata, Ragtime, Master Class and so many more. Great interviews with Angela Lansbury, Nathan Lane, Audra McDonald...so you know why I fell for this one. McNally will be here for the screening too!\n\nOffbeat Specials and Oddball Surprises\n\nYours in Sisterhood\n\nThe premise is simple and brilliant: women across the country are filmed reading aloud unpublished letters to the editor sent in the 1970s to Ms. Magazine. It ends up being an amazing two-lensed portrait: it's both a fond remembrance of the heyday of second-wave feminism, and a commentary on the far-less-than-perfect status of women in today's American society. This ought to be a sleeper hit, do not miss it!\n\nChedeng and Apple\n\nThis is a goofy and occasionally grisly black comedy, whose charm is held firmly in place by the two older actresses in the leads who happen to be legendary divas in the Philippines. They play two best friends on the lam, one in search of her long-lost girlfriend and the other fleeing a crime (with evidence hidden in her Louis Vuitton bag). I coudn't stop giggling.\n\nWorldly Affairs\n\nThis year's annual showcase of sexy/romantic short gay films from abroad is exceptional this year, including new films from Israel, Québec, and San Francisco's own Travis Mathews (via Brazil).\n\n2018 Frameline Award: Debra Chasnoff (1957 - 2017)\n\nShe was a pillar of the Bay Area documentary scene and an inspiring filmmaker/activist, whom we lost too soon. Come enjoy this tribute to the amazing Debra Chasnoff (among other achievements, she was the first person to thank her same-sex partner when she won her Oscar), and stay for the screening of her groundbreaking documentary It's Elementary.\n\nNaturally there's so much more I could be crowing about - celebrities in the house, light comedies, artful experiments...email me if you want more highlights or are wondering about a film I haven't mentioned here. The full program is here and tickets are on sale now.\n\nEarlier this week I delivered the following introductory remarks to Frameline's retrospective screening of Looking for Langston by Isaac Julien. I thought I'd share them here.\n\nWhen Moonlight won the Oscar for best picture this year, it occurred to us on the programming team that it was an extraordinary breakthrough for LGBT film…but also that this film did not emerge fully blown, out of a vacuum. It is a direct descendant of a long line of fierce and poetic depictions of black queer lives, running back through artists like Patrik-Ian Polk, Cheryl Dunye and Marlon Riggs, to the filmmaker whose work we will see today. To help us and our audiences take some measure of the progress and current state of art-making for LGBTQ filmmakers of color, we’ve put together a special multi-film program called “Barriers and Breakthroughs: Illuminating Filmmakers of Color Before and Beyond Moonlight” – 14 films and 2 panels that together help paint a picture of the past achievements and current opportunities and challenges facing artists working across multiple racial and sexual identities.\n\nWe kick things off today by going to the source: what is arguably the first black queer film by a black queer filmmaker: Isaac Julien’s Looking for Langston, today presented in a beautiful new digitally restored format.\n\nIsaac Julien, who received the 2002 Frameline Award for his pioneering filmmaking, is a hard-to-categorize British visual artist: filmmaker, installation artist, video poet, trickster, who often addresses the intersections of histories, migrations, identities, and sexualities in his visual assemblages. Queen Elizabeth herself seems wise to his talents: just this week she used her annual Birthday Honours to name him a Commander of the British Empire – pretty heady stuff for the son of Caribbean immigrants from the island of St. Lucia, who grew up in the gritty East End of London quite far removed from Europe’s high-art circles.\n\nHis breakout film in 1989 is the work we are going to see today, Looking for Langston, a meditation on the Harlem Renaissance, the poet Langston Hughes, and both the legacy and the future of Black queer desire. Isaac had been moved and inspired on a visit to New York in 1987 to think about these matters not only because he was steeping himself in Harlem Renaissance poetry and photography—work created by artists many of whom were gay or bisexual, closeted and out—but also because his visit happened to coincide with the funeral of James Baldwin, which he witnessed with his partner Mark Nash. He returned to London and fashioned this dreamlike, theatricalized film scenario: part funeral, part club rave, part homage and part imagined love story - using images and sounds that leap across decades to create a dense intertextual pattern that is suffused with wit and passion. The passion is there from the start: the first voice you hear is that of Toni Morrison in her eulogy for James Baldwin….but the wit is right there too—as the camera floats through a stylized 1920’s funeral home, the body in the casket is none other than Isaac Julien.\n\nThe film is all about Looking—not just “Looking for” some kernels of truth about the elusive essence of Langston Hughes, but also \"Looking at\": the film is a luscious celebration of the black queer gaze. And you can spell that last word any way you want.\n\nOn its release, the film fought off an attempt by the Langston Hughes estate to block the use of several of the poems used in it—in fact at its first festival screening in New York, someone had to stand by the projector and push a mute button every time Hughes’ poetry was read in order for the festival to avert a court injunction. But over the years most of those wrinkles were ironed out. The layered audio track is worth paying close attention to—featuring not only Hughes’ words but the rapturous poetry of Essex Hemphill and Bruce Nugent, and wonderful period music as well as contemporary songs written by Bay Area composer Blackberri.\n\nToday the film stands as a milestone – or more accurately the Rosetta Stone – for what queer filmmaking could be. As the film scholar B. Ruby Rich mentions in her Frameline catalog note, given the context of both the triumph of Moonlight and our current threatening political climate, this may be “the most essential film revival of 2017.”\n\nWe’ll precede it with Isaac Julien’s rarely screened short film The Attendant, completed just a few years after Looking for Langston. Here the setting is also a kind of theatrical tableau – this time in a museum, where a middle-aged Black gallery guard locks eyes with a beautiful white boy—played, by the way, by John Wilson, who also appears as a fetching object of desire in Looking for Langston. This loaded moment in the museum sets off a witty sequence of erotic and symbolic encounters that manage to reference everything from the history of British slavery to Tom of Finland. Writing in the New York Times, Holland Cotter observed that “the film presents a complex sexual and racial dynamic of dominance and submission and a poignant sense of loss, which serves as a reminder that the piece, [like Looking for Langston,] was made at the height of the AIDS epidemic.“\n\nWe are really grateful to Isaac Julien and his gallery team in London for making these films available, as well as to Brian Freeman for first suggesting this timely program. Isaac is traveling to South Africa and not able to be here, but noted in an email to me that it was a special honor to bring these films to Frameline, since even though they have appeared in San Francisco before, they have actually never played here officially as part of the Frameline festival – and have never been seen at all in these digital restorations.\n\nI'm a bit late with this round-up but want to point out a few don't-miss screenings at the upcoming festival, which opened Thursday June 15 and runs through June 25, featuring 147 films from 19 countries. It seems that this year (my fourth as Senior Programmer), LGBTQ film has leapt to new levels of sophistication, so the program feels especially strong from a cinematic standpoint. (I say this not to take any enhanced credit for the quality of the program; in fact I played a somewhat smaller role for Frameline this year because I was finishing my Jacques Pépin documentary.) For a sense of what might be happening in the zeitgeist for LGBTQ film, check out the programming team's thoughts in David Lewis' insightful article from last week's San Francisco Chronicle. Now on to a few picks for Frameline41.\n\nWorld Cinema - a smorgasbord...\n\nThe Wound\n\nA striking, haunting drama set during a coming-of-age initiation ceremony among South Africa's Xhosa community, where notions of masculinity collide with forbidden affections. Sensitively written and performed.\n\nGod's Own Country\n\nSet on a rugged Yorkshire sheep farm, this tale of a love that begins to take root between a sullen lad and the new Romanian farmhand is a slow burn, featuring muddy (torrid) frolicking and memorable scenes of animal husbandry. What's not to like? Director Francis Lee in person at the Castro!\n\nI Dream in Another Language\n\nDeep in a Mexican rain forest, a handsome anthropologist travels to a remote village to record the last two remaining speakers of a dying indigenous language, only to find the the two men refuse to speak to each other. His quest takes him on mystical, spiritual and wonderful journey into the past.\n\nAgainst the Law\n\nI was fascinated and appalled to learn the tragic history of the persecution of gay men in the UK during the 50s and 60s. This drama recounts the story of one man, Peter Wildeblood, and skillfully interweaves documentary testimony as well.\n\nAmong the docs, hidden histories and biographies galore\n\nChavela\n\nA marvelous, archivally rich and revelatory look at the fierce, iconoclastic Mexican torch singer Chavela Vargas. Pedro Almodóvar may have re-discovered her in 1990s, but here her whole messy and thrilling life gets its due.\n\nThe Untold Tales of Armistead Maupin\n\nWhile yes, it's an unabashed valentine to the city of San Francisco and the charms and openness that attracted its favorite son to live and write here, it's also a poignant look back at the last four decades of gay and lesbian life in America, through a novelist's eye. Well-crafted and told. It was our opening night screening (sold out) but just added an encore screening by popular demand.\n\nThe Lavender Scare\n\nA gripping account of the decades-long effort at the highest levels of U.S. leadership to rid the U.S. government of homosexuals starting with the Cold War--and the battle for justice led by civil rights pioneer Frank Kameny. Filmmaker Josh Howard & author David Johnson in person.\n\nFab US Features\n\nAfter Louie\n\nThe incomparable Alan Cumming will be here to receive the 2017 Frameline Award and bask in what I know will be a thunderous reception to his beautiful performance as a man of a certain age trying to bridge a gap between generations. Wilson Cruz also expected in the house!\n\nSignature Move\n\nThe festival boasts some terrific South Asian-themed films this year. Jennifer Reeder's delightful feature traces a budding romance between a Pakistani-American lawyer and a former female lucha libre wrestler...while she also negotiates bringing her traditional mother around to a more modern acceptance of 21st century love. (Mom is played wonderfully by the veteran actress Shabana Azmi, who starred in Deepa Mehta's controversial Fire some 20 years ago!)\n\nFreak Show\n\nA celebration of being your true oddball self, this is a fun, music-filled, affirming--but not trivial--coming-of-age story set in a high school, where the resident gender-expansive \"freak\" has a few lessons to teach the mean kids. Starring the wonderful Alex Lawther (who played young Alan Turing in The Imitation Game) with a memorable turn by Bette Midler as his boozy mom, and cameos from Laverne Cox, John McEnroe and Abigail Breslin.\n\n\"Only at a Film Festival\" - some offbeat picks\n\nLooking for Langston\n\nA new digital re-mastering of Isaac Julien's 1989 classic meditation on the Harlem Renaissance and queer black desire--an especially timely reminder that the poetic, boundary-crossing Moonlight has deep and fierce precedents. A perfect set-up for attending our panels focusing on opportunities and challenges facing LGBTQ filmmakers of color.\n\nStumped\n\nDon't be fooled by the apparent grimness of the topic (it's the story of a quadruple amputee) - this is a unique, uplifting, wry and funny documentary about resilience and the quirks of the human spirit.\n\nThose Who Make Revolution Halfway Only Dig Their Own Graves\n\nThe longest title in the festival and definitely the longest film (clocking in at just over 3 hours), this is a cinephile's must-see. In a fictional re-imagining of the iconoclastic political activism that led to Canada's 2012 \"Maple Spring\" (think \"Occupy\" on steroids), the film deploys a brilliant arsenal of cinematic styles to ask some pretty deep questions about what real change demands. It critiques youthful rebellion while also eviscerating the status quo. Epic in every way. Bring a cushion."
