        "text": "Dear readers,\n\nThe other day I was driving with my brother, who was playing D.J., when one of his song selections took me by surprise. “I thought you hated Elvis Costello,” I said accusingly and maybe a little resentfully, thinking of the decades of fruitless arguing this perception had occasioned. Charlie shrugged. “I was wrong,” he said.\n\nAmong its other benefits, voting for the 100 Best Books of the 21st Century forced us all to question our perceptions, some long held. Did I love a book out of habit, or duty? Had I outlived my objections? Had I just read something at the wrong age — or did a book not hold up? It was a great exercise, not only in revisiting favorites but also in challenging assumptions. And it turns out, being wrong is one of the best things in life. (But I’m afraid my objection to “The Dud Avocado” is set in stone.) These are books and authors I’ve reconsidered as an adult.\n\n—Sadie\n\nWhy did I think I didn’t much like Calvino? I suspect I came to him too young, having picked up “Invisible Cities” in a storm of indiscriminate reading before college. Maybe someone I didn’t like in a freshman humanities class overpraised “If on a Winter’s Night a Traveler.” Maybe I didn’t like “Italian postmodernism,” or at least liked saying that. I don’t remember the exact reason; I am sure it was stupid.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
