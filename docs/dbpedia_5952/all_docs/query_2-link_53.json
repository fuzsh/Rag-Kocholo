        "text": "The Lede\n\nHow Maricopa County Became the Election-Conspiracy Battleground\n\nThe contest for an obscure administrative office has become the race behind the race, with stakes that could determine the Presidency.\n\nInfinite Scroll\n\nThe Late Streaming Era and “Emily in Paris”\n\nOver four seasons, the Netflix series has hollowed out, along with the streaming industry that spawned it.\n\nBooks\n\nThinking Like a Geologist Can Rock Your World\n\nStudying stones means contemplating timescales that stagger the imagination—and lay bare the forces behind our existence.\n\nOpen Questions\n\nWhat Does It Really Mean to Learn?\n\nA leading computer scientist says it’s “educability,” not intelligence, that matters most.\n\nEpisode 1: The Green Grass\n\nA man in Haditha, Iraq, has a request for the In the Dark team: Can you investigate how my family was killed?\n\nEpisode 2: I Have Questions\n\nA trip to a Marine Corps archive reveals a clue about something that the U.S. military is keeping secret.\n\nEpisode 3: Sounds Like Murder\n\nWe travel around the U.S. to find the Marines who were on the ground in Haditha on the day of the killings.\n\nEpisode 4: What They Saw\n\nTwo conflicting stories about what happened that day emerge—one from the Marines involved in the killings, and another from a very different perspective.\n\nEpisode 5: Four Brothers\n\nWas it a face-off with insurgents or the murder of four innocent brothers? We investigate what happened in the final house the Marines entered that day.\n\nEpisode 6: The Full Picture\n\nStartling new information emerges from deep within the investigation files. Then the In the Dark team gets a big break.\n\nEpisode 7: Innocent in My Eyes\n\nThe conflicting narratives about what happened in Haditha make their way through the opaque inner workings of the military justice system, until they reach a top commander who decides which story to believe.\n\nThe Election-Interference Merry-Go-Round\n\nClaims and counterclaims of “election interference” are ubiquitous these days. What does the term actually mean?\n\nRobert F. Kennedy, Jr., Steps Aside for Donald Trump\n\nAs Kennedy’s 2024 election campaign collapses, he has embraced a new role as the former President’s latest ally.\n\nCan Kamala Harris Keep Up the Excitement Through Election Day?\n\nAt the Democratic National Convention, the sense of relief was as overwhelming as the general euphoria—but the campaign against Donald Trump has only just begun.\n\nKamala Harris’s “Freedom” Campaign\n\nDemocrats’ years-long efforts to reclaim the word are cresting in this year’s Presidential race.\n\nListening Booth\n\nSabrina Carpenter’s Funny, Feisty “Short n’ Sweet”\n\nThe artist sings with wry, petulant specificity, whether she’s addressing a boyfriend, an ex-boyfriend, or that ex-boyfriend’s new girlfriend.\n\nListening Booth\n\nGillian Welch and David Rawlings’s New Album Steeped in Longing\n\nOn “Woodland,” even tracks ostensibly grounded in a feeling of satisfaction evoke that which has slipped away.\n\nCulture Desk\n\nThe Brief, Brilliant Career of a Forgotten Trailblazer of Modern Jazz\n\nCharles Bell recorded only three complete albums. Stop what you are doing and listen to them now.\n\nOn Television\n\nMourning the End of “Evil,” a Show Like Nothing Else on Television\n\nThe Paramount+ procedural’s unusually serious treatment of faith made it a bright spot in an increasingly risk-averse TV landscape.\n\nPop Music\n\nHow Post Malone Made Himself at Home in Country Music\n\nEveryone’s headed to Nashville these days, but no one is as comfortable there as he is.\n\nOn and Off the Menu\n\nBonnie Slotnick, the Downtown Food-History Savant\n\nIn the forty-eight years that she’s lived in the West Village, the owner of the iconic cookbook shop has never ordered delivery.\n\nDemocracy Needs the Loser\n\nThe observance of defeat, especially in an election, is often all that keeps a state from tipping into violence.\n\nWas Linguistic A.I. Created by Accident?\n\nSeven years after inventing the transformer—the “T” in ChatGPT—the researchers behind it are still grappling with its surprising power.\n\nOur Very Strange Search for “Sea Level”\n\nAs the oceans ebb and surge, staggering ingenuity has gone into inventing the measure. What can it tell us about living on our changeable planet?\n\nThe Trouble with Friends\n\nThe wonder, and the curse, of friendship is choice. Friends drift apart. Commonalities change. The relationship is not stagnant, and growing together is not the norm.\n\nThe Vigil Keepers of January 6th\n\nIn the aftermath of the assault on the Capitol, a trio of women with family members who participated in the riot moved to D.C. to seek their own kind of justice."
