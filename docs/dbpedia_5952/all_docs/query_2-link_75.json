With a budget of $800,000, the production was shot from 1 November 1928 through 21 January 1929 at a cost of $400,000 at the time production shooting was halted by Swanson. More than 200,000 feet of footage was directed by von Stroheim, with little more than one-third of the scenario shot. Synchronized sound retakes were shot on 9 December 1929. Franz LehÃ¡r was hired, at one stage in the rewrite stage, to compose music for the film, but that work was never completed or used. On 24 November 1931, a rewritten ending in which the prince discovers that Kelly has successfully committed suicide by drowning was shot by cinematographer Gregg Toland. This version was released in 1932 in runs that were limited to Europe and South America due to a clause in Stroheimâs contract. [?] Weinberg-Stroheim lists Ashton in the role of Kellyâs aunt in Africa. A restoration of the film was produced by Dennis Doros of Kino International in 1985. / Silent film.\n\nDrama.\n\nSynopsis: Synopsis (by Stroheim) available in Weinberg-Stroheim p. 212.\n\nSurvival status: Prints exist in the CinÃ©mathÃ¨que franÃ§aise film archive [35mm positive (two reels from the African sequence)]; in the George Eastman Museum film archive [35mm positive]; and in the Kino Lorber film library [35mm preservation positives].\n\nCurrent rights holder: (unknown)\n\nListing updated: 8 March 2011.\n\nReferences: Film credits, film viewing : Bogdanovich-Dwan p. 90; Bohn-Light p. 87; Brownlow-Behind p. 23; Drew-Speaking pp. 49-50; Everson-American p. 286; Fell-History pp. 114, 116, 117, 125; Hudson-Swanson pp. 14, 16, 196, 197, 198; Leish-Cinema p. 52; Quirk-Swanson pp. 15, 33, 211, 212, 213-214, 215, 218; Shipman-Cinema p. 102; Sinyard-Silent pp. 89, 90, 126, 127; Vermilye-Twenties p. 249; Weinberg-Stroheim pp. xiii, xvi, xviii, 209-238 : ClasIm-240 p. 44 : Website-GEM; Website-IMDb."
