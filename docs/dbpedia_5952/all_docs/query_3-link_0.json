        "text": "Austrian and British film director\n\nPaul Ludwig Stein (4 February 1892 â€“ 2 May 1951) was an Austrian and British film director with at least 67 films to his credit.\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nBorn in Vienna in 1892, Stein began his film career in Berlin in 1918. He worked exclusively in the German silent film industry until 1926, when he first went to Hollywood, and spent the next five years commuting between Germany and the United States, where he worked with stars such as Jeanette MacDonald, Lillian Gish, and Constance Bennett.\n\nIn 1931, Stein relocated to England after gaining a contract with British International Pictures, where he was assigned a number of big-name prestige productions, including some of the popular operetta films of the mid-1930s. These included Blossom Time and Heart's Desire starring his boyhood friend Richard Tauber, who also made cameo appearances in two of his post-war films Waltz Time and Lisbon Story. For most his career, Stein's credits tended to be films primarily aimed at female audiences, although later he also directed crime and spy thrillers. Stein remained in England for the rest of his life and career, becoming a British citizen in 1938.[1] He died in London in 1951.\n\nPartial filmography\n\n[edit]\n\nDirector\n\n[edit]\n\nActor\n\n[edit]\n\nZucker und Zimt (1915)\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
