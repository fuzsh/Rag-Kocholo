Can anybody recommend any? I’ve read general Greek myths (nasty beasties they in those, other than perhaps Chiron), Updike’s book Centaur, and HARRY POTTER but was interested in others that use the animals for a paper I’m writing on the use of Greek myth in modern literature.

Thanks

I think some of the Naria stories by CS Lewis has Centaurs…(I could be misremembering though)

Villians By Necessity has one…but that’s such a dumb book I don’t think it’d really work with the whole modern literature thing.

ermm nothing else pops into my mind.

In the first of Jack Chalker’s Well World series, some of the characters who pass through the zone gate are transported to a hex populated by centaurs and are themselves transformed.

John Varley’s Gaean trilogy **Titan, Wizard, Demon ** has a whole race of centaurs. Their mating habits (with genitals both fore and aft, so to speak) come in for a lot of discussion, as do their sometimes complex genetive schemes.

The animated centaurs in Disney’s Fantasia have 1940s hairstyles, not surprisingly considering when the film was made,

Yes, there are tens of centaurs trotting through the Xanth novels. The main ones that come to mind are the first trilogy ( A Spell for Chameleon, The Source of Magic, Castle Roogna ), Isle of View, and I want to say The Vale of the Vole as well.
