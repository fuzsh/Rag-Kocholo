        "text": "The Ditmars are the Australian Science Fiction Achievement Awards.\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nThe name arose via a joke. At a committee meeting to decide the name of the proposed award, lengthy discussions had gotten around to considering people the award might be named after. Someone suggested that a person thus honoured might be persuaded to fund the awards.\n\nDick (Martin James Ditmar) Jenssen seized an opportunity to relieve tedium by hazarding that he would be willing to pay for the awards if they were named \"Ditmar\" awards. What, he was asked, is a Ditmar? \"Digital Integrating and Tabulating Mechanism for the Advancement of Research\", he told them.\n\nHis offer was accepted, and he subsequently found himself paying for the awards for some years longer than he'd anticipated.\n\nNowadays, the awards process for the Ditmar Awards involves separate rounds for nominations and votes, but back in 1970 there was just a single round of voting. Also, a points system was used to determine winners that year.\n\nIn 1982, the Australian Natcon, Tschaicon, was billed as \"the First Australasian SF Convention\", and the Ditmar Awards presented that year were, at least in theory, Australasian awards.\n\nIn 2002, and again in 2010, Ditmar received a Ditmar. (Other instances of fans receiving awards named after themselves were when Forrest J Ackerman received a Forry Award in 2002 and K. Martin Carlson a Kaymar Award in 1984.)\n\nIn 2012, Robin Pen received a Ditmar Award for his \"The Ballad of the Unrequited Ditmar\", the Ditmar of that title being a Ditmar Award from the previous year.\n\nDitmar Rules (archived).\n\nWilliam Atheling, Jr. Award[edit]\n\nThe William Atheling, Jr. Award for Criticism or Review is a Special Category under the Ditmar Awards. \"The Athelings\", as they are known for short, are awarded for excellence in SF and speculative criticism.\n\nThey are named for the pseudonym used by SF author James Blish for his critical writing.\n\nThe award was first presented as part of the Ditmar Award ceremony, at Bofcon, the 15th Australian National Science Fiction Convention in Melbourne in August 1976.\n\nNowadays, the William Atheling, Jr. Award for Criticism or Review is considered a Ditmar Award. However, there was a time when the constitution governing the Australian Natcons referred to it as a separate award. It is still classified as a \"special award.\"\n\nThe history of nominations for the award indicates that it has not always been restricted to Australians. In 1989, the last year in which there was a Ditmar Award for International Fiction, there were published eligibility criteria for the William Atheling, Jr. Award that required the work to have been published in Australia, but did not require the author to be Australian.\n\nDitmar Award for Best Fannish Cat[edit]\n\nIn 1991, a Ditmar Award for Best Fannish Cat was presented at SunCon (in Brisbane, Australia). The Business Meeting at that convention voted to demote the award from a Ditmar Award to a Special Award of the Convention. However, that decision was reversed at the Business Meeting of the following Australian Natcon.\n\nAccording to Bruce Gillespie, “The person who was Chair of the convention in Brisbane stuffed up many aspects of the convention. She was also part of a non-Melbourne group who believed that every aspect of the Ditmars was a cruel plot by Melbourne fans to keep all the Ditmars for themselves. So she allowed members of the convention to vote for the categories as well as the items in the categories. Irresistible bait to Melbourne fans in general — who ganged up to include Best Fannish Cat in the categories.”\n\nThis still rankled as late as 2005, when a Swancon XXX progress report calling for nominations for the Tin Duck Award exhorted, “Please do not invent new categories. (e.g. No Best Fannish Cat. We’ve heard it before, and it wasn’t funny the first time).”\n\nBut Dudcon III, in 2010, revived Best Fannish Cat as a non-Ditmar Special Award of the Convention. Rules required nominees to be “natural members of the species Felis Catus” alive and resident in Australia at the time of the nomination.\n\nIn both cases, noted Gillespie, “the winners were very popular cats who had been met by many Melbourne fans. The general effect was to confirm the suspicion of Perth fans that Melbourne fans ‘did not take the Ditmars seriously.’”\n\n1991 Nominees for Best Fannish Cat[edit]\n\nApple Blossom, humans: Elaine Cochrane & Bruce Gillespie\n\nConstantinople, human: Phil Wlodarczyk\n\nEmma Peel, human: Terry Frost\n\nGodzilla, humans: Ian Gunn & Karen Pender-Gunn\n\nHoney, humans: Gerald Smith & Womble\n\nSatan, human: Phil Wlodarczyk\n\nTruffle, humans: Mark Loney & Michelle Muijsert\n\nTypo (winner), human: Roger Weddall\n\n2010 Nominees for Best Fannish Cat[edit]\n\nTabby Allen, human: James Allen\n\nFelix Blackford, human: Jenny Blackford\n\nPeri Peri Canavan (winner), human: Trudi Canavan\n\nFlicker Gillespie, humans: Elaine Cochrane & Bruce Gillespie\n\nPazuzu Sparks, humans: Cat Sparks & Robert Hood\n\nStuffed Cane Toads[edit]\n\nAnother 1991 scandal that pitted insurgents from Melbourne against sercon fen elsewhere in the country was the SunCon Ditmar trophies. Melburnian Mark Loney made awards of mounted taxidermied cane toads (a poisonous introduced pest endemic to Queensland, where the con was held). He intended them as a joke, to be presented at the ceremony, with the real Ditmars to be given at the closing ceremony.\n\nThe cane toads were presented, but the actual Ditmars trophies weren’t ready by the end of con. The real ones would be distributed later at a Nova Mob club meeting, but this did not placate the outraged.\n\nSpecial Awards[edit]\n\nConvention reports from 1971 indicate that the two Special Awards presented that year were considered to be Ditmar Awards.\n\nSome Other Awards[edit]\n\nThe Ditmar Awards should not be confused with the Melbourne Science Fiction Club Achievement Award nor the Peter McNamara Achievement Award nor the Pat Terry Award for Humour in SF.\n\nAward Winners[edit]\n\nComplete Ditmar Award Results\n\n1969[edit]\n\nEighth Australian Science Fiction Convention, Melbourne\n\n1969 Best Australian Science Fiction of any length, or collection[edit]\n\nPacific Book Of Australian SF, John Baxter\n\nFalse Fatherland, A.
