        "text": "These people fail to realize that it is on the inside that God must be defended, not on the outside. They should direct their anger at themselves. For evil in the open is but evil from within that has been let out. The main battlefield for good is not the open ground of the public arena but the small clearing of each heart.\n\n\"The British press is extremely centralized, and most of it is owned by wealthy men who have every motive to be dishonest on certain important topics. But the same kind of veiled censorship also operates in books and periodicals, as well as in plays, films and radio. At any given moment there is an orthodoxy, a body of ideas which it is assumed that all right-thinking people will accept without question. It is not exactly forbidden to say this, that or the other, but it is 'not done' to say it, just as in mid-Victorian times it was ânot doneâ to mention trousers in the presence of a lady. Anyone who challenges the prevailing orthodoxy finds himself silenced with surprising effectiveness. A genuinely unfashionable opinion is almost never given a fair hearing, either in the popular press or in the highbrow periodicals.\"\n\n\"If the intellectual liberty which without a doubt has been one of the distinguishing marks of western civilisation means anything at all, it means that everyone shall have the right to say and to print what he believes to be the truth, provided only that it does not harm the rest of the community in some quite unmistakable way.\"\n\nNo one had listened to her, not from the start. Hendrickson and his cronies on the national security staff had been so certain of their superiority, of their ability to take on any threat, and that overconfidence had backed them into this corner, cutting squares in the South China Sea, waiting for the imminent strike against their homeland.\n\n\"In 1907 [Fritz] Haber was the first to obtain nitrogen, the main nutrient required for plant growth, directly from the air. In this way, from one day to the next, he addressed the scarcity of fertilizer that threatened to unleash an unprecedented global famine at the beginning of the twentieth century. Had it not been for Haber, hundreds of millions of people who until then had depended on natural fertilizers such as guano and saltpetre for their crops would have died from lack of nourishment.\"\n\n\"When Haber returned victorious from the massacre at Ypres [where he supervised the chlorine gas dispersal], Clara accused him of perverting science by devising a method for exterminating human beings on an industrial scale. Haber ignored her: for him, war was war and death was death, regardless of the means of its infliction. He used his two day's furlough to invite his friends to a party that lasted until dawn, and, at its end his wife walked down to the garden, took off her shoes, and shot herself in the chest with her husband's service revolver.\"\n\n\"If they killed men as they did this fall, the Allies would be cooked in another year. He said we were all cooked, but we were alright as long as we did not know it. We were all cooked. The thing is not to realize it. The last country to realized they were cooked, would win the war.\"\n\n\"Once a generation of artisans discovered they could prosper from owning even temporarily the fruits of their mental labor they began investing that labor where they saw the largest potential return. Most failed of course but that did not prevent a trickle of inventors from becoming a flood. The virtual inexhaustible source for the raw material the fuel of industrialization had been discovered and Britain was home to the mother lode.\"\n\n\"In 1952 codes were small enough to be completely debugged, but hardware could not be counted on to perform consistently from one kilocycle to the next. This situation is now reversed. How does nature with both sloppy hardware and sloppy coding achieve such reliable results? There is reason to suspect that our predilection for linear codes ... is chiefly a literary habit ... a very efficient language will depart from linearity.\"\n\nEdmund Burke, Irishman and Episcopalian, was a strange figure in relation to the Scottish school. He knew many of its members; they heavily influenced his own view of history. But he had rejected their most characteristic conclusion, that the great driving force in the progress of civilization was economic change. Burke insisted it was the other way around: it was the elaborate network of civilized \"manners,\" meaning morality, law, and tradition grown up over generations, that made a system of commercial exchange based on trust possible, and hence human progress possible.\"\n\n\"Now then, bullies,\" he [Hook] said briskly, \"six of you walk the plank to-night, but I have room for two cabin boys. Which of you is it to be?\"\n\n\"Don't irritate him unnecessarily,\" had been Wendy's instructions in the hold; so Tootles stepped forward politely. Tootles hated the idea of signing under such a man, but an instinct told him that it would be prudent to lay the responsibility on an absent person; and though a somewhat silly boy, he knew that mothers alone are always willing to be the buffer. All children know this about mothers, and despise them for it, but make constant use of it.\n\nIn the old days at home the Neverland had always begun to look a little dark and threatening by bedtime. Then unexplored patches arose in it and spread, black shadows moved about in them, the roar of the beasts of prey was quite different now, and above all, you lost the certainty that you would win. You were quite glad that the night-lights were in. You even liked Nana to say that this was just the mantelpiece over here, and that the Neverland was all make-believe.\n\nOf course Neverland had been make-believe in those days, but it was real now, and there were no night-lights, and it was getting darker every moment, and where was Nana?\n\nAs soon as the three doctors had left the room, the Fairy went to Pinocchio's bed and, touching him on the forehead, noticed that he was burning with fever.\n\nShe took a glass of water, put a white powder into it, and, handing it to the Marionette, said lovingly to him:\n\n\"Drink this, and in a few days you'll be up and well.\"\n\nPinocchio looked at the glass, made a wry face, and asked in a whining voice: \"Is it sweet or bitter?\"\n\n\"It is bitter, but it is good for you.\"\n\n\"If it is bitter, I don't want it.\"\n\n\"Drink it!\"\n\n\"I don't like anything bitter.\"\n\n\"Drink it and I'll give you a lump of sugar to take the bitter taste from your mouth.\"\n\n\"Where's the sugar?\"\n\n\"Here it is,\" said the Fairy, taking a lump from a golden sugar bowl.\n\n\"I want the sugar first, then I'll drink the bitter water.\"\n\n\"Do you promise?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThe Fairy gave him the sugar and Pinocchio, after chewing and swallowing it in a twinkling, said, smacking his lips:\n\n\"If only sugar were medicine!\"\n\n\"We think we know what we are doing. We have always thought so. We never seem to acknowledge that we have been wrong in the past, and so might be wrong in the future. Instead, each generation writes off earlier errors as the result of bad thinking by less able minds - and then confidently embarks on fresh errors of its own.\"\n\n\"The battle is not to improve our circumstances, to supply us with money, to protect us from suffering, to keep us safe from pain and struggle, or to quickly fix whatever problems develop in our bodies. We are encouraged to pray for all these things, but we must always finish our prayer with that wonderful caveat that in our immaturity we find so annoying: if it be Thy will.\"\n\n\"But we have received a sign, Edith - a mysterious sign. A miracle has happened on this farm... in the middle of the web there were the words 'Some Pig'... we have no ordinary pig.\"\n\n\"Well\", said Mrs. Zuckerman, \"it seems to me you're a little off. It seems to me we have no ordinary spider.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said Zuckerman. \"It's the pig that's unusual. It says so, right there in the middle of the web.\"\n\nThe first and most important point is that our oaths to the gods prevent us from being enemies of each other. A man who has his conscience burdened with neglect of such oaths is not a man whom I would ever consider happy. I do not see how one who is an enemy of the gods can run fast enough away, nor where he can flee to escape, nor what darkness\n\nAll these soldiers of ours have their eyes on you, and if they see that you are downhearted they will all become cowards, while if you are yourselves clearly prepared to meet the enemy and if you call on the rest to do their part, you can be sure that they will follow you and try to be like you.\n\n..the gods are judges of the contest, and they will naturally be on our side, since it was our enemies who took their names in vain, while we, with many good things before our eyes, resolutely kept our hands off them because of the oaths we had sworn to the gods. So it seems to me that we can enter the contest with much more confidence than they can.\n\nThen it was certainly a terrible sight. The women threw their children down from the rocks and then threw themselves after them, and the men did the same. While this was going on Aeneas of Stymphalos, a captain, saw one of them, who was wearing a fine garment, running to throw himself down, and he caught hold of him in order to stop him; but the man dragged him with him and they both went hurtling down over the rocks and were killed.\n\n[Quoting Augustine]\n\n\"I carried inside me a cut and bleeding soul, and how to get rid of it I just didn't know. I sought every pleasure - the countryside, sports, fooling around, the peace of a garden, friends, and good company, sex, reading. My soul floundered in the void - and come back upon me. For where could my heart flee from my heart? Where could I escape from myself?\"\n\nNo one had every talked this way before. If we page quickly through world literature from its beginnings to the advent of Augustine, we realize that with Augustine human consciousness takes a quantum leap forward - and becomes self-consciousness.\n\n\"Seemingly senseless pain and trauma engulfs much of life. If you seek to follow Him, you must be content to trust His character rather than your ability to understand. The difference between a knife in the hand of an assassin and a knife in the hand of a surgeon is intent: both inflict severe pain. You must decide whether God is an assassin or a surgeon. But remember, your choice does not change God, only your opinion.\"\n\nHow frequently, in the course of our lives, the evil which in itself we seek most to shun, and which, when we are fallen into, is the most dreadful to us, is oftentimes the very means or door of our deliverance, by which alone we can be raised again from the affliction we are fallen into.\n\nWhat remained [of the Roman times]? noble roads sometimes overgrown with woodlands, the stupendous work of the Roman wall breached and crumbling, fortresses, market towns, country houses, whose very ruins the next comers contemplated with awe.\n\nBut of Roman speech, Roman law, Roman institutions, hardly a vestige. Yet we should be mistaken if we supposed that the Roman occupation could be dismissed as an incident without consequence; it had given time for the Christian faith to plant itself.\n\nAlthough the process of wearing down was spread over many years, and misery deepened by inches, we must recognize in the year 367 circumstances of supreme and murderous horror. In that fatal year the Picts, the Scots, and the Saxons seemed to work in combination. All fell together upon Britannica. The empirical troops resisted manfully... A wide open breach was made in the defenses and murderous hordes poured in upon the fine world of country houses and homesteads; everywhere they were plotted out.\n\n[Barbarians had breached the Rhine defenses and Stilla was fighting them intensely ] The British army, complaining that the province was being neglected, mutined...[They elected Constantine as emperor] Constantine, instead of protecting the island, found himself compelled to defend upon the continent, the titles that he had usurped. He drained Britain of troops and ... set forth.. to try his fortune. [After 3 years of fighting ] he was finally captured and executed. None of the troops who had accompanied him ever returned to Britain. Thus in these fatal years the civilized parts of the island were stripped of their defenders...\n\n\"...Luther saw it was the whole man who was corrupt and needed God's forgiveness, not just particular sins that one by one could be erased by proper Church-defined actions. The particular sins were but symptoms of a more fundamental sickness in man's soul that required healing. One could not purchase redemption, step by step, through good works or through the legalisms of penance or other sacraments, not to mention the infamous indulgences. Only Christ could save the whole man, and only man's faith in Christ could justify man before God.\"\n\n\"It is not the critic who counts, not the one who points out how the strong man stumbled or how the doer of deeds might have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred with the sweat and dust and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs and comes short again and again; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, and spends himself in a worthy cause... his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.\" - quoting --Theodore Roosevelt, \"Man in the Arena\" Speech (April 23, 1910)\n\n\"The fine-structure constant also answers to the name alpha, and it can be arrived at by taking the square of the charge of the electron divided by the speed of light times Planck's constant. What all that verbiage means is that one number, 137, contains the crux of electromagnetism (the electron), relativity (the velocity of light), and quantum theory (Planck's constant). It would be less unsettling if the relationship between all these important concepts turned out to be on or three or maybe a multiple of pi. But 137?\"\n\n\"A lake of clearest water was joined to the grand lake of Mexico by a channel capable of admitting the largest canoes. All was ornamented, painted, and admirably plastered and delightful with singing birds. When I beheld the scenes around me I thought within myself, this was the garden of the world. And of all the wonders I beheld that day, Nothing now remains. All is overthrown and lost.\"\n\n\"But what then if the memory itself loses anything, as falls out when we forget and seek that we may recollect? Where in the end do we search, but in the memory itself? and there if one thing be perchance offered instead of another, we reject it, until that we seek meets us; and when it doth, we say 'This is it' \"."
