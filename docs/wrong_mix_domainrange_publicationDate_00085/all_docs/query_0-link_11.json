Initially I attempted to keep the reviews of the individual books fairly brief, but found myself writing longer reviews as time went on. I have now reread the series, and written two versions of the review for each book: a short description on this page, and a long description – on a separate page for each book.\n\nOverview\n\nXanth is a magical land, which is somehow in our world, but not easily accessible. It occupies the same area as the state of Florida, although somehow removed from it. The inhabitants of Xanth refer to our own world as Mundania. (However, later in the series, from the end of “Air Apparent” onwards, the relationship of Xanth to Earth/Mundania changes, in conjunction with Ida’s moons. And Xanth becomes a world in its own right.)\n\nThe land is populated by various magical creatures and part humans: eg centaurs, dragons, elves, ogres, harpies, goblins, nymphs, fauns and merfolk. The humans who live there each have a single magical talent – a different one for each person. For example [for characters early in the series], Trent can transform any creature into another creature, Iris can project illusions, Dor can communicate with inanimate objects, Irene can make plants grow instantly, and Grundy Golem can translate the language of any creature, including plants.\n\nThe stories generally involve the characters in adventuring through the Xanthian wilderness, which is rather hazardous, with dangerous animals and plants, which have evolved magical ways of catching their prey. There are other hazards, such as the love spring, which if you drink from it, causes you to immediately fall in love with the first being of the opposite sex that you see. Or you could be captured by a tribe of goblins.\n\nThere are many islands off the coast of Xanth. Some of them appear and disappear, and are not all accessible from Xanth at the same time. (These are first mentioned in “Zombie Lover”, They are referred to in “Jest Right” as the Sometime Islands.) The author uses this as a way to extend the number of locations the questers have adventures in.\n\nEach story generally has a central character, who has to go on a quest, usually with companions, travelling across Xanth, having various adventures, having to make significant decisions, and making use of magic if possible. Generally there are romances as well. Usually the central character will begin by consulting with Humfrey, the Magician of Information (also known as the Good Magician). There are three Challenges to get into the Magician’s Castle. Then Humfrey provides an Answer for any Question, in exchange for some Service. The stories are often resolved in unexpected ways.\n\nAlthough all humans born in Xanth have a magical talent, only a few have really strong and useful talents. Those who have are called Magicians (if they are male) or Sorceresses (if they are female).\n\nThe main political entity in the Land of Xanth is the Kingdom of Xanth, also called the Human Kingdom of Xanth, especially by non-humans, who are not under its jurisdiction.\n\nOnly a Magician can become king of the Kingdom of Xanth. As a result, the monarchy does not necessarily follow the hereditary line. Ruling queens are not permitted. This convention is eventually circumvented in the book “Night Mare”, by the declaration that a female Magician (ie a Sorceress) can become the ruler, but must be referred to as “King”, not “Queen”. Again, eventually, as described in “Jest Right”, when Harmony comes to the throne, she takes the title of “Queen” instead of “King”, thus ending the practice of female rulers being called “King”. (However note that this is 9 years in the future of “Jest Right”‘s main story.)\n\nFor most of the Xanth series, we are given the impression that the Kingdom of Xanth is the only human kingdom in the Land of Xanth. But it becomes clear by the time of “Apoca Lips” that there are other human kingdoms in the Land of Xanth.\n\nOther species have their own forms of government. Some of these are monarchies, with a king or queen.\n\nAs the series continues, the focus changes to different characters from book to book, so that the minor characters of one book may become the central characters of a later book. Also, as time passes, some of the characters have children, and the series continues with the lives and adventures of the children.\n\nA major feature of the series is puns. The author goes a bit overboard with puns as the series goes on, as he tries to accommodate all the suggested puns that his readers send in. On the other hand, some of the readers’ contributions are quite good – generally the ideas and scenarios, rather than the puns. Some readers send in short narratives, which the author embeds in his stories, seemingly without much modification, which adds an interesting flavour to the stories.\n\nOne of the types of beings in the Xanth universe are demons. (All of the following also applies to the feminine form of the word, “demoness”.) There are two levels:\n\nDemons, spelled with a capital D (and occasionally referred to as Senior Demons, Great Demons, Capital Demons etc), who are associated with the planets (or other astronomical objects) and the forces of the universe.\n\n(In “The Source of Magic”, the listed Demons are related to abstract concepts rather than planets. Besides X(A/N)th and E(A/R)th , there are D(E/A)th, D(E/P)th, and T(E/N)th.)\n\nThese Demons are constantly trying to increase their status. This is the reason for the infamous Demon Wagers. There is a hierarchy within these Demons: Major Demons, Dwarf Demons and Minor Demons.\n\nIn the beginning of the series, these Demons’ names are given in the format of mathematical formulae, eg X(A/N)th. Initially, as described in “The Source of Magic”, the idea is that the Demons increase their status by modifying the variables. A bit later in the series, in “Golem in the Gears”, an increase in status results in a Demon getting more ornate brackets in their name. But later in the series, this format is abandoned, and their names given in normal print, eg “Demon Xanth”. (The word “Demon” is normally included, to distinguish the Demon’s name from the realm they rule, but may be omitted when it is not ambiguous.)\n\ndemons (or lesser demons), spelled with a small d, who are generally confined to the Land of Xanth, or the other magical realms.\n\nIn “Five Portraits”, Demoness Fornax (a Senior Demon) describes lesser demons as “infinitesimal fragments associated with a particular Demon” and that Metria, for example, “is a figment of Demon Xanth’s imagination, crafted somewhat in his image but of no actual consequence.”\n\nHowever, with both types of demons, a capital D is used when referring to them by name. Often (generally only with the lesser demons) their names form a word when combined with an initial D, eg, Demon Fiant = D. Fiant = defiant.\n\nAlso, of course, a capital is always used when beginning a sentence, eg “Demons don’t dream.”\n\nAs well as the land of Xanth, the stories describe a place called “the gourd”, or the Realm of Night, or the dream realm, where bad dreams are manufactured, and carried to their intended recipients by night mares – ie black female horses, who can pass through material objects. This land is ruled over by the Night Stallion. Ordinary people cannot usually go to this place physically, but if they look into the peephole of a hypnogourd, they are projected into the realm in spirit form, with their bodies remaining behind, although they feel as if they are physically present in that realm. But there are also some large gourds where the peephole is large enough for a person to enter the dream realm physically.\n\nThere is also the Day Stallion, who is the counterpart of the Night Stallion. Under his jurisdiction are the day mares, whose job it is to deliver pleasant dreams or daydreams.\n\nStarting from the book “Faun & Games”, a new series of worlds are introduced – the Moons of Ida (or the Worlds of Ida). Princess Ida has a tiny moon, Ptero, orbiting her head. It is possible for people to travel to this world in soul form, by releasing their souls from their bodies and leaving their bodies behind. On Ptero are counterparts of all Xanth’s characters, and also others who could potentially exist in Xanth. Ptero also contains a Princess Ida, who has another moon orbiting her head, and so on. This provides virtually unlimited settings for adventures to occur. The understanding of the nature of these worlds changes at the end of “Air Apparent”, and other ways of travelling to them are possible – eg magic doors in “Knot Gneiss”, and the Fire Sail Boat, Fibot, making use of Santo’s talent of creating tunnels through space, in “Jest Right”.\n\nIn a few stories from “Stork Naked” onwards, alternative realities are introduced – also referred to as alternative universes. Under certain restricted circumstances, characters travel to alternative versions of Xanth, where history has taken different courses.\n\nSome of the alternative universes are shifted in time relative to the primary universe. This concept is introduced in “Five Portraits”. There is a series of universes, each shifted one second from the universe next to it. So by travelling through this series, it is possible to get to a universe whose setting is at a different point in time than a character’s own universe. This travel is only possible with the assistance of a Senior Demon. It is similar to time travel, but avoids the problem of paradox.\n\nA theme often mentioned is the Adult Conspiracy (to Keep Interesting Things from Children), whereby adults conceal certain facts from children, such as how to summon the stork which brings babies. In particular this is emphasised in “The Color of Her Panties”, when Gwenny Goblin has to take on the responsibilities of becoming the first female chief of her tribe. To a lesser extent, the Adult Conspiracy is also responsible for adults enforcing rules on children, such as making them eat healthy meals, go to bed on time and attend their lessons. Often the Adult Conspiracy acts as an impersonal force, compelling people to follow the rules.\n\nThere is a certain amount of sexual innuendo in the series. This mostly takes the form of flirting and teasing, and descriptions of nudity. There is occasional sexual activity, usually described in discreet language, using euphemisms like “summoning the stork”, since it is storks which deliver babies in Xanth. The inclusion of sexual activity seems to be becoming more frequent and obvious (although still not described explicitly) in later books such as “Two to the Fifth” and “Jumper Cable”, which I find a disturbing development, especially since I imagine many of the readership are children. However, the author makes the following statements in the Author Note of “Jumper Cable”:\n\n“I have tried to slowly age the material, so that some four-letter words are used though generally bleeped out, and some adults signal the stork onstage instead of in the unmentioned background. But in general this remains a fun series, suitable for mature children if not for the freakable mothers of teens.”\n\nand\n\n“…Xanth is and always was an adult series…”\n\nAs the series continues, Xanth’s historical background is filled in, and reasons are given for many of the magical features of the land. The book ‘Question Quest’ has a history of Xanth up to that point, compiled by a reader, which the author has adopted, and to which he remains consistent. A copy of the history, which continues to be updated, can also be found at http://www.hipiers.com/timeline.html. (This link is not currently operating – see note at the bottom of this page.)\n\nBooks in the “Xanth” series\n\nA Spell for Chameleon (1977)\n\nBink is exiled to Mundania because he apparently has no magical talent.

They rescue Rapunzel from the Ivory Tower where she is imprisoned by the Sea Hag.\n\n[Golem in the Gears – long description]\n\nVale of the Vole (1987)\n\nThree travellers meet as they go to consult Magician Humfrey. They are Esk, the ogre/human, Chex, the winged centaur, and Volney the Vole.

Esk, Chex and Volney resolve to work together to get rid of the demons. They will all go to the beings of their races to ask for help. This requires each to go on a separate adventure, travelling to various parts of Xanth.\n\n[Vale of the Vole – long description]\n\nHeaven Cent (1988)\n\nDolph, the son of Dor and Irene, goes searching for the missing Magician Humfrey, in the company of the walking skeleton Marrow Bones.

Instead she finds herself in Mundania, and meets a young man called Grey Murphy. The two of them return to Xanth (and he is only too pleased to leave drear Mundania). She finds herself falling in love with him, especially after he rescues her from a tribe of goblins. But her parents say that as a Princess, she must only marry a Prince, or a person with a significant magical talent. And since Grey was born in Mundania, he hasn’t got a magical talent.

He meets a girl called Chlorine, who becomes his companion. During the subsequent adventure he is able to alternate his dragon form with the human form, but must not speak or reveal his true identity.\n\nTogether the Baldwins, Nimby, Chlorine, and others, try to combat the storm, which has entered Xanth, and is stirring up the magic dust, and causing chaos.\n\n[Yon Ill Wind – long description]\n\nFaun & Games (1997)\n\nForrest Faun has his own sandalwood tree, but when a neighbouring tree loses its faun, Forrest wants to find a new faun for the tree.

In the meantime Demon Earth discovers Nimby (who is actually Demon Xanth) trespassing in his realm, and raises a storm to prevent him from returning to Xanth.\n\n[Xone of Contention – long description]\n\nThe Dastard (2000)\n\nThe Dastard is a young man who has sold his soul to a demon, in exchange for the talent of “unhappening”. Whenever he encounters someone who has received enjoyment through some lucky event, he travels back in time and undoes the event, thus preventing the person from experiencing that enjoyment. Humfrey sends Becka, the dragon girl, and the three princesses Melody, Harmony and Rhythm to stop the Dastard’s deeds.

He is accompanied in this by Jenny Elf’s cat, Sammy, who has the talent of finding people and things, another cat called Claire Voyante, and Sesame Serpent, with transport provided by the duck-footed boat Para. They hope by this task to discover how to avert Xanth’s destruction by Demon Jupiter. However there are also other puzzles – why is Demoness Metria thwarting their deliveries, and why can’t Umlaut remember his past? And to make things interesting, Umlaut meets and falls in love with Surprise, the daughter of Grundy Golem and Rapunzel.\n\n[Up in a Heaval – long description]\n\nCube Route (2003)\n\nThe girl Cube is given the quest of finding the route to Counter Xanth, the contra-terrene territory won by Demon Xanth from Demoness Fornax. In the process she is to choose nine companions, who will be magically concealed within a pouch she carries, and may be brought out to assist her when necessary. The route takes her to various places in Xanth, to the world of Phaze, Mundania, and the Moons of Ida. However Demoness Fornax is determined to sabotage her mission.\n\n[Cube Route – long description]\n\nCurrant Events (2004)\n\nClio, the Muse of History, discovers a book she has apparently written, but which is unreadable because the writing is blurred. Magician Humfrey sends her on a mission to Dragon World, to persuade dragons to come to Xanth to replenish the dragon population. Then back in Xanth she meets Sherlock of the Black Wave, who has developed a magic talent with reverse wood, despite coming from Mundania. Clio and Sherlock continue the quest to find the Currant, which should enable her to read the unreadable volume. Their travels take them far and wide in Xanth, Counter Xanth and the Moons of Ida. They meet interesting people and experience dangers – as Clio has a curse on her, which means that she will encounter deadly dangers daily when away from her home on Mount Parnassus. A tentative romance begins between Clio and Sherlock.\n\n[Currant Events – long description]\n\nPet Peeve (2005)\n\nGoody Goblin is a rarity – a good-natured male goblin. He is given the task of finding a home for the pet peeve, a bird which constantly insults everyone. So, accompanied by the warrior woman, Hannah Barbarian, he travels through Xanth. In return for a favour from some dragons, they bring a program back from Robot World (one of the Moons of Ida) to produce a robot to assist the dragons to produce a nest. However, before they realise it the program is producing large numbers of robots, who are threatening to overrun Xanth.
