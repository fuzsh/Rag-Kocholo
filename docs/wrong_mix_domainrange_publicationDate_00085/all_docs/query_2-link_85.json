        "text": "D&D: BASIC TREASURE Scrolls A scroll is a piece of old paper or parchment upon which a high level magic-user, elf or cleric has written a magical formula. To use a scroll there must be enough light to read by, and the scroll must be read aloud. A scroll can only be used once, for the words will fade from the scroll when they are read aloud. A spell scroll can only be read by a magic-user, elf, or cleric, but a Protection scroll or a Treasure Map can be read by anyone. SPELL SCROLL: These scrolls may have 1, 2, or 3 spells written on them. If more than one spell is written on a scroll only the spell cast will disappear when read. Spell scrolls may have either magicuser or elf spells (75%) or clerical spells (25%). Magic-user and elf spells are written in a magical language and require that the spellcaster use a read magic spell in order to understand the scroll so that it may be used later. Clerical scrolls are written in a common tongue, but only clerics have the spiritual contacts necessary to make the spell work. Magic-users and elves cannot use clerical scrolls, nor can clerics read magic-user or elf scrolls. The DM may choose the spells on a scroll or the spells may be determined randomly by using the chart below (roll Id6) to determine the spell levels and then roll for each of the spells on the appropriate spell level list. Die Roll Level of Spell 1-3 1st level 4-5 2nd level 6 3rd level* 'See Higher Level Spells, page B18. CURSED SCROLL: Unfortunately, when any writing on a cursed scroll is looked at, the reader will immediately be cursed. It is up to the DM to make up each curse. Examples of a few common ones are: 1. The reader turns into a frog (or some other harmless animal). 2. A wandering monster of the same level as the reader appears next to the reader and attacks with surprise. 3. One magic item owned by the reader disappears (the item is chosen or randomly determined by the DM). 4. The reader loses one level of experience (as if struck by a wight); 1st level characters will simply die. 5. The reader's prime requisite must be rerolled. 6. Wounds will take twice as long to heal, and healing spells only restore half normal amounts. Only a remove curse spell (see the D&D EXPERT SET) can remove the curse of this nature. However, the DM may allow the cursed characters to remove it by completing a special adventure or performing a worthy but difficult task. PROTECTION SCROLL: A protection scroll may be read and used by any class. When read, it creates a circle of protection 10' across (unless the description or the DM states otherwise), which can move with the reader at its center. It will prevent any of the given creatures from entering this circle, but does not prevent spell or missile attacks from those creatures. The circle will be broken if anyone protected attacks one of the given creatures in hand-tohand combat. Protection from Lycanthropes: When read, this scroll will protect all those within the circle from a variable number of lycanthropes for 6 turns. The number of lycanthropes affected varies according to their hit dice, as follows: 1-3 hit dice: 1-10 (ldlO) affected 4-5 hit dice: 1-8 (Id8) affected 6 or more hit dice: 1-4 (Id4) affected Protection from Undead: When read, this scroll will protect all those within the circle from a variable number of undead for 6 turns. The number of undead affected varies according to their hit dice, as follows: 1-3 hit dice: 2-24 (2dl2) affected 4-5 hit dice: 2-12 (2d6) affected 6 or more hit dice: 1-6 (Id6) affected TREASURE MAP: A treasure map should be made by the DM in advance, and should show the location of some treasure hoard in the dungeon. The DM may choose any types of treasures to equal the total value given. These treasures should be guarded by monsters. Sometimes maps are only partially complete, or are written in the form of riddles, and can only be read by using a read languages spell. Rings A magical ring must be worn on a finger or thumb to be used. A ring may also be carried and put on when desired. Only one magic ring can be worn on each hand. If more than that are worn, none of the rings will function, with the exception of a ring of weaki (see below). Any ring may be used by any character class. Animal Control: The wearer of this ring may command 1-6 normal or 1 giant-sized animal (s) and the animals are not allowed a saving throw. The ring will not control intelligent animal races or fantastic or magical monsters. The wearer must be able to see the animals to control them. The control will last as long as the wearer concentrates on the animals and does not move or fight. When the wearer stops concentrating, the animals will be free to attack their controller or run away (roll reactions with a penalty of -1 on the roll). This ring can only be used once per turn. Fire Resistance: The wearer of this ring will not be harmed by normal fires, and gains a bonus of + 2 on any saving throws vs. fire Spells and vs. Red Dragon Breath. In addition, the DM must subtract 1 point from each die of fire damage to the wearer (with a minimum damage of 1 point per hit die). Invisibility: The wearer is invisible as long as the ring is worn. If the wearer attacks or casts spells, he or she will become visible. The wearer can only become invisible once per turn. Protection +1 : This ring will make the wearer's Armor Class better by 1. For example, a magic-user with no armor (AC 9) would have AC 8 when wearing it. The ring will also give a bonus of + 1 to all of the wearer's saving throw rolls. Water Walking: The wearer of this ring may walk on the surface of any body of water, and will not sink. Weakness: When this ring is put on, the wearer becomes weaker, and his or her Strength score becomes 3 within 6 rounds (1 minute). The wearer has a penalty of -3 on \"to hit\" and damage rolls. In combat, any successful hit will still do at least 1 point of damage. The wearer cannot take off this ring (unless a remove curse spell is used, found in the D&D EXPERT rules). The DM may choose to allow characters to remove the ring by performing some special task or adventure. Wands, Staves, and Rods A wand is a thin smooth stick about IV2' long. A rod is similar, but 3' long; and a staff is 2\" thick and 6' long. In D&D BASIC rules, wands may only be used by magic-users and elves, and staves may only be used by clerics. Unless otherwise specified, a wand, staff, or rod will contain 1-10 (ldlO) charges when found. Each item is described below: Wand of Enemy Detection: When a charge is used, this item will cause all enemies within 60' (even those hidden or invisible) to glow, as if on fire. B49\n\nTREASURE D&D: BASIC Wand of Magic Detection: When a charge is used, this item will cause any magic item within 20' to glow. If the item cannot normally be seen (within a closed chest, for example), the glow will not be seen. Wand of Paralyzation: This wand projects a cone-shaped ray when a charge is used. The ray is 60' long and 30' wide at its end. Any creature struck by the ray must save vs. Wands or be paralyzed for 6 turns. Staff of Healing: This item will heal 2-7 (Id6+ 1) points of damage per use. It may only be used once per day on each person, but will heal any number of persons once a day. It does not have nor use any charges. Snake Staff: This magical staff is a Staff +1 , and will inflict 2-7 (Id6 + 1) points of damage on a successful hit. Upon command, it will turn into a snake (Armor Class 5, Hit Dice 3, hit points 20, Movement rate 60' per turn, 20' per round) and coil around the creature hit. The command may be spoken when the victim is hit. Any victim man-sized or smaller will be held helpless for 1-4 turns (unless the snake is ordered by the owner to release the victim before that time), larger creatures are unaffected. Victims are allowed to make a save vs. Staves to avoid the serpents coil. When freed, the snake will crawl back to its owner and become a staff again. The snake is completely healed when it turns into a staff. If killed in snake form, it will not return to staff form and loses all magical properties. This item does not have nor use any charges. Rod of Cancellation: This rod is usable by any character. It will only work once, but will drain magical items it hits of all magic, making that item forever nonmagical. The target is treated as having an Armor Class of 9. The DM may adjust the Armor Class of an item if it is being used in combat (such as when trying to hit a sword). Miscellaneous Magic Items Bag of Devouring: This item looks like a normal small sack, but anything placed within it disappears and is lost forever 7- 12 turns later. It will not affect living creatures unless the entire creature is stuffed inside the bag. This is impossible to do except with very small creatures. Bag of Holding: This item looks like a normal small sack, but will actually hold treasures up to 10,000 coins in weight, but will only weigh 600 coins when full. An item to be placed inside the bag may be no larger than 10' x 5' x 3'. An object any larger than that will not fit inside. Broom of Flying: Upon command, the Broom will carry its owner and fly through the air at a rate of 240' per turn. It can carry 1 extra person, reducing speed to 180' per turn. Crystal Ball: This item can only be used by an elf or magicuser. Its owner may look into it and see any place or object thought of. It will work 3 times per day, and the image will only last for 1 turn. Spells cannot be cast \"through\" the crystal ball. The more familiar the object or area to be seen, the clearer the picture will be. Elven Cloak and Boots: Wearing the cloak will make a person nearly invisible, while the boots allow a person to move silently. A character wearing an elven cloak will only be seen on a roll 1 (on Id6). After attacking, the wearer will be visible for the rest of the turn. Gauntlets of Ogre Power: These gauntlets will give the wearer a Strength score of 18. If a weapon is used in combat while wearing these gauntlets, the wearer will gain the bonus of + 3 on \"to hit\" and damage rolls. If a weapon is not used, the wearer may strike with one fist each round. A punch will do 1-4 (Id4) points of damage, gaining a + 3 on \"to hit\" rolls only. The wearer may carry an additional 1000 coins of weight without being encumbered. Helm of Alignment Changing: This item looks like a fancy helmet. When the helm is put on, it will immediately change the wearer's alignment (the DM should determine the new alignment randomly). This device may only be taken off by using a remove curse spell (see the D&D EXPERT RULES); the wearer will resist the removal. The DM may allow the character to remove it by performing a special task or adventure. Helm of Telepathy: This item looks like a fancy helmet. The wearer of this helm may read the thoughts of any creature within 90' by concentrating on that creature. To make the helm work, the wearer must concentrate on the creature and not move. The wearer will understand the creature's thoughts, and may \"send\" thoughts to the creature; however, the creature may refuse to respond. Medallion of ESP: This magical medallion is strung on a chain to be worn around the neck. If the wearer concentrates for 1 round, he or she may read the thoughts of any one creature within 30'. The wearer may move normally but cannot fight nor cast spells while concentrating. The DM must check this item each time it is used: it will not work properly on a roll of 1 (on Id6). If this occurs, it will broadcast the thoughts of the user to everyone within 30'! The DM may allow a saving throw vs. Spells to prevent the medallion from reading a creature's thoughts. Rope of Climbing: This 50' thin, strong rope will climb in any direction upon the command of the owner. It may fasten itself to any protruding surface, and will support up to 10,000 coins of weight. EXAMPLE: The DM sets up the lair of 30 goblins (an average number for a lair). Their listed Treasure Type is \"C\". Finding line \"C\", the DM gets the following results when rolling percentage dice : Listing for Dice Treasure Type Type \"C\" Roll Result Copper pieces 20% 1-12 29 No copper present Silver pieces 30% 1-4 02 Some silver present Electrum pieces 10% 1-4 73 No electrum present Gold pieces Nil — (None; no roll needed) Platinum pieces Nil — (None; no roll needed) Gems 25% 1-4 25 Some gems present Jewelry 25% 1-4 42 No jewelry present Magic Items 10% Any 2 06 2 magic items present The DM then rolls to find the amounts of silver pieces and gems present in the goblin lair. Rolling Id4 for each, the results of 2 and 3 mean that 2,000 silver pieces and 3 gems are present. The value of the gems must be found. Rolling d% and using the gems table (page B47), the DM finds that they are worth 50 gold pieces each. The types of magic items must be found. Rolling d% and using the General Magic table, the results of 18 and 53 mean that the Sword subtable and the Potion subtable must be used to find the exact items. Rolling the appropriate die for each subtable, the DM finds that a sword + 1 and a potion of healing are in the goblin lair. The DM makes a note that the goblin leader will be using the sword + 1 in combat. The DM notes, with the room descriptions for the dungeon, exactly what treasures are in the lair of the 30 goblins. If there had been fewer goblins, the treasure would have been cut down to match their numbers. For example, if there were 10 goblins (V3 of the given number), there should be V3 (or less) of the rolled treasure: 600 silver pieces, 1 gem, and 1 magic item — probably the potion. B50\n\nPART 8: DUNGEON MASTER INFORMATION Before players can take their characters on adventures into dungeons, the DM must either create a dungeon or draw its map, or become familiar with one of TSR's dungeon modules. The \"B\" series of modules is designed for use with the D&D BASIC SET. The module included in this set may be used to start adventuring immediately, and will provide some ideas for designing dungeons. This section gives a step-by-step guide to creating a dungeon. The guide is followed by an example of part of a dungeon level. The example follows the same steps as the guide and illustrates each step. A set of suggested symbols is included for DMs to use when drawing a dungeon map. The same level is only part of a larger dungeon. The sample tower may be used to practice adventuring, and the dungeon outline may be useful if the DM wants to finish the dungeon. A. CHOOSE A SCENARIO. A scenario is a background theme or idea which ties the dungeon together. A scenario will help keep a dungeon from becoming a boring repetition of \"open the door, kill the monster, take the treasure\". A good scenario always gives the players a reason for adventuring. The DM should also design a dungeon for the levels of characters who will be playing in it. A good scenario will also give the DM a reason for choosing specific monsters and treasures to put in the dungeon. A scenario may be anything the DM can imagine. To help new DMs, some common scenarios are listed below and explained. The DM can fill in the details. Scenarios 1. Exploring the Unknown 2. Investigating a Chaotic Outpost 3. Recovering Ruins 4. Destroying an Ancient Evil 5. Visiting a Lost Shrine 6. Fulfilling a Quest 7. Escaping from Enemies 8. Rescuing Prisoners 9. Using a Magic Portal 10. Finding a Lost Race 1. Exploring the Unknown: The party is hired to map unknown territory. The area might once have been familiar but is now overrun or destroyed; a strange tower might mysteriously appear overnight in a familiar area. Dungeon modules Bl (In Search of the Unknown) and B3 (Palace of the Silver Princess) are examples of exploration scenarios. 2. Investigating a Chaotic Outpost: This scenario has to do with a Chaotic invasion (either in progress or about to begin). The characters must enter the enemy outpost, find out the strength and plans of the invaders, and destroy the outpost if possible. Dungeon module B2 (The Keep on the Borderlands) is an example of this type of scenario. 3. Recovering Ruins: The party is usually scouting an old village before permanent settlers move in. The ruins have often been overrun by a specific kind of monster which must be killed or driven away. The ruins could be part of (or underneath) a thriving town! 4. Destroying an Ancient Evil: The evil is usually a monster or NPC (the exact type not known by the players). Sometimes the evil has been deeply buried and re-awakened by recent digging. This theme is often used along with others; for example, an ancient evil may have to be destroyed before some ruins are resettled. 5. Visiting a Lost Shrine: To remove a curse or recover a sacred item, the players must travel to a shrine which has been lost for ages. The characters usually have only a rough idea of its location. The players may have to consult an oracle or seer during their visit. 6. Fulfilling a Quest: This is a scenario in which a king (or other NPC) provides a reason for adventuring. A variation of this is a special mission for \"the gods\". Quite often this scenario also involves the recovery of a sacred object or powerful magic item. 7. Escaping from Enemies: The player characters begin this adventure as prisoners, and must escape. The reason is clear and simple, especially if imprisonment is to be followed by the deaths of the characters. The DM must be careful to make escape possible (though not necessarily easy). 8. Rescuing Prisoners: Valuable and important persons are being held prisoners by bandits, a tribe of ores, or an evil magic-user. The party sets out to rescue the prisoners because they have been hired to (for an expected reward), for a debt of honor, or for some other reason. Sometimes the player characters are only hired to guard an individual who is talking over the demands for ransom. This scenario is the basis for the sample dungeon hereafter (The HAUNTED KEEP). 9. Using a Magic Portal: The \"magic portal\" is a device which magically sends creatures from one place to another. A magic portal is usually a door into another dimension or world, and thus may easily become the point of an invasion from one of these worlds. Portals may be known or secret. If known, the characters may be on a mission to destroy or guard a portal used by enemies, or perhaps to reopen or repair a \"closed\" portal. Secret portals can be used to make sure that the characters will visit an important area of a dungeon. Portals might operate both ways, or one way only (teleporting into but not out of an area). 10. Finding a Lost Race: The players find a once-human race which has lived underground for so long that it has begun to change. Its members might have developed infravision, changed color, or begun to fall back into animal ways. This scenario works well when used with Destroying an Ancient Evil, since Lost Races are often servants of the ancient powers. This scenario requires extra work and imagination by the DM, since details for the Lost Race must be invented. B. DECIDE ON A SETTING. It is not necessary to draw a detailed map of the dungeon first, but it is useful to have a general idea of what it will look like. When deciding on the shape of the dungeon, the DM should also outline ideas for rooms or areas in the dungeon. A few common settings include: 1. Castle or tower 4. Crypt or tomb 2. Caves or cavern 5. Ancient temple 3. Abandoned mine 6. Stronghold or town C. DECIDE ON SPECIAL MONSTERS TO BE USED. The DM should decide on what special monsters (not placed by using the Wandering Monster tables) will be used. Some monsters should be placed by the DM because of the scenario chosen, and the DM may create or change some monsters to fit the dungeon. B51\n\nDM INFORMATION D&D: BASIC D. DRAW THE MAP OF THE DUNGEON. A dungeon map is usually drawn on graph paper. The map should be made in pencil so that changes can be made. Before actually drawing the map, the DM should determine the scale. The scale of a map is the number of feet each square on the graph paper is equal to. Most maps are drawn to a scale of 10' per square. The scale depends on the size of the dungeon and rooms. If, for example, the rooms are all larger than 100' on a side, or if the dungeon is thousands of feet long, the DM may wish to use a scale of 20' per square. On the other hand, a small tower such as the one in the following HAUNTED KEEP is better at 5' or 10' to a square. The general shape of a dungeon is often determined by the setting. For example, a tower is usually round or square with smooth walls, while a cavern has an irregular shape and rough walls. If the DM has a good idea of where certain rooms and corridors will go, other sections of the map may be left blank, to be filled in later. Some standard dungeon symbols are given with the sample dungeon maps. E. STOCK THE DUNGEON. To \"stock\" a dungeon means to fill in the general details, such as monsters, treasure, and traps. Special monsters should be first placed in the appropriate rooms along with special treasures. The remaining rooms can be stocked as the DM wishes. If there is no preference as to how certain rooms are stocked, the following system may be used. Roll Id6 for CONTENTS, and then roll on the second table for TREASURE according to the result of the first roll. A \"Yes\" result means that Treasure is there along with whatever is indicated by the first roll. First Roll: CONTENTS Second Roll: TREASURE? Die Roll Result Die Roll 1 2 3 4-6 Monster Yes Yes Yes No Trap Yes Yes No No Empty Yes No No No 1-2 Monster 3 Trap 4 Special 5-6 Empty A Monster result means that the DM should roll on a Wandering Monsters table to determine the type present. A Trap may be located in an empty room or on treasure. A Special is anything not exactly a trap, but placed for special reasons. The DM should make up traps and specials, but some suggestions are given below. ROOM TRAPS: Poison gas: Save vs. Poison or die Fog: Looks like Poison gas, but harmless Pit: Id6 points of damage per 10' fallen Ceiling Block falls: Save vs. Turn to Stone or take Id 10 points of damage Pendulum blade from ceiling: Id8 points of damage Chute: No damage, but slide to the next level down TREASURE TRAPS: Poison needle: Save vs. Poison or die Spring-fired darts: 1-6 darts hit for 1-4 points of damage each Flash of light: Save vs. Spells or be blinded for Id8 turns Poison snake (see SNAKE in monster descriptions) Spray: Be sprayed with an unknown liquid that attracts Wandering Monsters; double chances for Id6 hours Illusion: Anything; often a monster (as phantasmal force) SPECIALS: Moaning room or corridor Room turns or sinks while the door locks Illusionary stairs or corridor Shifting block to close off corridor Trap door to tunnels Alarm that summons special monster Talking statue Magic pool whose waters have a strange effect Magic gate to another part of the dungeon Flying weapons which attack only if disturbed TREASURE: If treasure is in a room with a monster, use the Treasure Type for that monster (given in the monster description) to find the treasure in the room. If treasure is in a room without a monster, use the Unguarded Treasure table (below). The table is used in the same way as the Treasure Types table (page B45). Unguarded Treasure Dungeon Level 1 2-3 'Silver Pieces Id6 x100 ldl2xl00 Gold Pieces 50%: Id6 x 10 50%: Id6 x100 Gems 5%: Id6 10%: Id6 Jewelry 2%:ld6 5%:ld6 Magic Items 2%: Any 1 8%: Any 1 'Note that there are always silver pieces in unguarded treasure, and that other items are given in terms of the die rolled to determine the number present. F. FILLING IN FINAL DETAILS. Once the rooms have been stocked, the DM can fill in details about the corridors (such as traps or regular patrols of monsters). The DM should also \"stock\" the dungeon with some normal items, smells, sounds, and so forth. Inhabited and empty rooms could be given whatever normal furnishings would be common in the dungeon. The DM should be careful not to use too much nor too little detail; some detail will help the players imagine the areas that they are exploring, but too much detail is often just boring. CREATING AN NPC PARTY Since it takes time to create a fully detailed NPC party, many DMs will prefer to prepare them in advance for use as either Wandering Monsters or as planned encounters. The DM may choose the NPCs in a party or determine them randomly. A suggested system for rolling up an NPC party is as follows: 1. Determine the number of NPCs in the party: 5-8(rollld4 + 4). 2. Determine the class of each character (roll Id8): 1 Fighter 5 Dwarf 2 Magic-user 6 Elf 3 Cleric 7 Halfling 4 Thief 8 Fighter 3. Determine the level of each character (roll Id6): 1,2 First level 3,4 Second level 5,6 Third level 4. Determine the alignment of each character (roll Id6); the DM may only roll once, if desired, and make all the alignments the same: 1,2 Lawful 3,4 Neutral 5,6 Chaotic 5. Randomly determine or choose any magic-user, elf, and cleric spells. 6. Choose special treasures or roll for possible treasure (U + V). If a magic item is rolled up, a member of the NPC party will use it in combat if at all possible. 7. Decide on a marching order for the group. The DM may want to roll for NPC ability scores, also. B52\n\nD&D: BASIC DM INSTRUCTIONS WANDERING MONSTERS Besides the monsters which live in rooms, characters may encounter monsters which wander about the dungeon. These monsters are known as \"Wandering Monsters\". At the end of every 2 turns, the DM should check for Wandering Monsters. To do so, roll Id6: a result of 1 indicates that the party will encounter a Wandering Monster in the next turn. The Wandering Monster will be 20-120 feet away from the party when encountered (roll 2d6, multiply the result by 10) in a direction of the DM's choosing, and will be headed toward the player characters. Wandering monsters may be determined at random or selected by the DM. The Wandering Monster tables (below) give a balanced mixture of monsters for the dungeon levels. The DM may create his or her own tables. The dungeon may have certain areas where Wandering Monsters are encountered more often (such as on a roll of 1 or 2). The dungeon may have areas where the DM checks for Wandering Monsters every turn, or where a monster will appear when a corridor is entered. Wandering Monsters should appear more often if the party is making a lot of noise or light, but should not be frequent if the party spends a long time in one outof-the-way place (if they stop in a room for the night, for example). The DM may want to create special wandering monster tables for specific areas or dungeons. These might include the monsters which live in the area, patrols, and animals (vermin) which can be found there. An example would be a cave complex with goblins living in it. A wandering monster table for this area could have encounters with normal goblins, goblin patrols and perhaps a chance of running into bats or rats. Most Wandering Monsters are the same level as the level of the dungeon (in other words, they have a number of hit dice equal to the number of the dungeon level). The \"Number Appearing\" of some monsters has been adjusted to make them more appropriate for encounters on a dungeon level. Use the table for the dungeon level being explored.

THE HAUNTED KEEP can help show a new DM how to design a dungeon. Part of this dungeon is already designed, and enough other details are provided so the DM need not \"start from scratch\". If this sample dungeon is to be used in play, the players should not read the following section. The letters (A-F) correspond to those used in the guide (page B51) and illustrate each step in turn. A. CHOOSE A SCENARIO: \"In the distant past, the Haunted Keep was the castle of the Rodemus family. It was abandoned many years ago when the family mysteriously disappeared. It is now rumored to be haunted. Strange lights and sounds are often seen and heard in the ruins by passing townspeople. \"Recently, a tribe of goblins has been raiding the countryside. On their last raid they captured a dozen prisoners. The prisoners are all relatives of the player characters, who have banded together to rescue their relatives. The party has tracked the goblins to the Keep or castle, right up to the only door to the east tower. \"Most of the Haunted Keep is in ruins. Only two towers remain, connected by a gatehouse, and only the first floors of these towers are still intact. The Keep was built with rough granite blocks, now pitted with age. The door into the east tower is wooden and one hinge is rusted through.\" (The three paragraphs above serve as an example of the type of information that the DM might design and read to the players to give them the background of the adventure before it begins. The DM should also write notes describing the dungeon further, giving information which would not be read to the players:) What the players do not know is that the Rodemus family has become a family of wererats, and still live in tunnels under their old castle. The family has joined the goblin raiders and are using them to find the strengths of the surrounding countryside. If the raids show the country folk to be weak, the family plans to raise a goblin army and attack. The players will slowly discover this information, little by little, as the adventure proceeds. B. DECIDE ON A SETTING: A \"keep\" is a kind of castle. The HAUNTED KEEP has two towers connected by a gatehouse. The upper stories have collapsed, and the buildings now have only one floor. The rest of the castle is totally in ruins. The insides of the two towers should be similar, though not exactly the same. The gatehouse is split into two sections, divided by what was once a main road. The interior of the gatehouse will be similar to the towers, though there will be fewer rooms (see the dungeon maps on page B57). The catacombs (2nd level of the dungeon) are a series of caverns and crypts where the Rodemus family ancestors are buried, and lie under the ruins. The 3rd level, under the catacombs, is the mazelike lair of the Rodemus family of wererats. The prisoners will be scattered throughout all of the levels; however, the most important prisoners must be rescued from the center of the wererat lair. C. CHOOSE SPECIAL MONSTERS: The most common monsters on the 1st level are goblins. Other common 1st level monsters are giant rats (possibly hunted by giant ferrets), bandits, and hobgoblins. Common monsters in the 2nd level catacombs are ghouls, zombies, skeletons, goblins, hobgoblins, and giant rats. Common monsters on the maze-like 3rd level are wererats, hobgoblins, bugbears, and thouls, plus at least one wight and one doppleganger. D. DRAW THE MAP: To make it easier to draw and map, the towers are designed square rather than round. Since the east tower is small, the scale chosen is 1 square = 5'. The first thing needed is an entrance from the 1st to the 2nd levels. This is a trap door in the middle of a tower, so the first room drawn is room # 4. The trap door leads to a winding staircase and eventually to the catacombs. The next area drawn is the entrance to the tower itself. The outer walls are 10' thick. Rather than have the goblins post a guard at the entrance door, a pit trap is placed in the entranceway. Then the other rooms are drawn in, being careful to make sure that the player characters will have to go through several other rooms to each room # 4 (no matter which way they go). Finally, the DM decides to make room # 4 contain hobgoblins guarding 2 prisoners, room # 5 will be a goblin barracks, and room # 9 will be a goblin lookout post. Having no preference as to what monsters, treasures, or traps go in the other rooms, they are stocked at random. E. STOCK THE DUNGEON: Room 1: First the DM rolls Id6 to determine the room's contents. The result is a 5, so the room is empty of monsters and traps. The DM rolls again to check for treasure; the result of 4 indicates that the room has none. The room is totally empty of monsters, treasures, and traps. Room 2: The DM rolls a 2 when checking for contents, so there are monsters present. Using the Wandering Monsters table (level one) and rolling ld20, the result of 16 indicates that they are crab spiders (Treasure Type U). The monster description states that 1-4 crab spiders normally appear, so the DM rolls Id4; the result of 1 indicates that 1 crab spider is present. Rolling Id6 to check for treasure, the result of 2 indicates that treasure is present. Rolling d% and referring to the Treasure Types table, these are the results: Listing for Dice Treasure Type Type \"U\" Roll Result Pieces of copper 10% 1-100 21 None present Pieces of silver 10% 1-100 02 Silver present Pieces of electrum Nil — No roll Pieces of gold 5% 1-100 23 None present Pieces of platinum Nil — No roll Gems/Jewelry 5% 1-4 59 No gems present 14 No jewelry present Magic Items 2% Any 1 86 None present Separate rolls are made for gems and jewelry. The only treasure present is silver pieces; percentage dice are rolled to determine the number, and the result of 99 meant that the crab spider guards a treasure of 99 sp. The DM decides that the treasure is too small for a special trap. The stocking of this room is finished. Room 3: The DM rolls Id6 to check for contents; the result of 3 means that the room contains a trap. Rolling again to check for treasure, however, the result of 1 means that some booty or treasure has to be determined. Rolling d% and using the Unguarded Treasure table, these are the results: Dice Treasure Type Listing Roll Result Silver pieces Gold pieces Gems Jewelry Magic Items 100 xId6 50%:ld6xl0 5%: Id6 2%: Id6 2%:Anyl — 76 51 90 01 Silver always present None present None present None present 1 magic item present Rolling Id6 for silver pieces, the result of 4 indicates that 400 sp are present. To determine the magic item, a roll on d% gives the result of 44, indicating that a potion is left with the trapped silver B55\n\nDM INSTRUCTIONS pieces. The DM rolls ld8 and, consulting the Potion table, finds that a potion of healing is the magic item. For the trap, the DM selects a capsule of sleeping gas which will break open when the treasure is tampered with. Room 4: The DM selects 4 hobgoblins to occupy this room along with 2 prisoners and some treasure. Rolling the chances according to the given Treasure Type for hobgoblins (D), it is found that the monsters may have 3000 silver pieces and 1-8 pieces of jewelry. Since only 4 hobgoblins are on guard (out of a possible 24, or 1/6 of the possible Number Appearing), the number of silver pieces is reduced to 1/6 the rolled number (down to 500) and the minimum (1) piece of jewelry is used. Rolling 3d6 to determine its value, the result of 11 means that the piece of jewelry is worth 1100 sp. There is a trap door in the room, leading to the lower levels of the dungeon. Room 5: This area serves as the barracks for the goblins. No traps or treasure are indicated by dice rolls. Room 6: This room is empty (by dice rolls of 5 and 3). Room 7: The result of 1 (on ld6) indicates that a monster is present. It is determined by die roll (ld20, with a result of 7) to be 1 green slime. The roll for treasure is a 4, so there is nothing in the room but the monster. Room 8: As with room 6, this room is found to be empty. Room 9: Four goblin guards are placed in this room. Dice rolls show that they have no treasure. There is, however, a secret door in the room, also placed by the DM. F. FILLING IN FINAL DETAILS: Now that all the rooms are stocked, it is useful to make a dungeon Key and fill in final details. The Key should be complete enough that it (along with the scenario) is all the DM needs to run the dungeon. When expanding the Keep, the DM should create the feeling of a haunted house by adding spooky noises and some ghostly figures which appear suddenly in odd places (though harmless). Some of the placed monsters should be undead (skeletons, zombies, and wights). The DM should be careful, however, not to unbalance the dungeon with too many undead monsters. In the following Key, monsters will be presented in a standard form. This form will be followed whenever D&D monsters are used. The form is: Monster name (Armor Class, Hit Dice or level, hit points, Movement Rate, Number of Attacks, Damage, Save As, Morale, Alignment). This form will be used with the following standard abbreviations: Monster name (AC, HD, hp, MV, #AT, D, Save, ML, AL). Since saving throws for monsters are based on character classes, the following standard abbreviations will be used after \"Save\": F = fighter, C = cleric, T = thief, M = magic-user, D = dwarf, E = elf, H = halfling. Each room description will begin with the room number, followed by a note on the size of the room, in parentheses. Standard abbreviations for compass directions (N, S, E, and W for North, South, East, and West) will be used. For example, (20' N-S, 10' E-W) means that the room is 20 feet long and 10 feet wide. \"Square\" means that the room is exactly as wide as it is long. DUNGEON KEY Room #l (15' E-W, 10' N-S): This room appears to have once been a bedroom. It is filled with rotting, moldy bedroom furniture, D&D: BASIC but is empty of monsters, treasure, and traps. The dust on the floor has obviously been brushed to remove any footprints. Room #2 (10' E-W, 15' N-S): This room was once a guard post (when the Haunted Keep was a castle, before becoming ruins). A faded, ragged tapestry showing a hunt divides the room in half. Clinging to the side of the tapestry away from the characters (no matter which door they use, unless they enter through both at once) is a crab spider (AC 7, HD 2•, hp 10, MV 120' (40'), #AT 1, D 1-8 + poison, Save F: 1, ML 8, AL Neutral). On the north side of the tapestry is a wooden table and 3 wooden chairs. A few moldy cards lie on the tabletop. Against the west wall is a wooden chest. Any attempt to disturb the chest will bring an immediate attack by the crab spider. The chest contains 99 sp (silver pieces). Room #3 (15' E-W, 20' N-S): The walls of this room are carved with leering human faces along their length. A close examination of the north wall will reveal a crack around one particularly sinister face. The face is on a swivel and can be pried open. Behind it is a small iron safe cemented into the wall. The safe is trapped with sleep gas which will billow out unless the trap is deactivated. The sleep gas will fill a circular area 10' in diameter, but otherwise has the same effects as a sleep spell; however, any creature who saves vs. Poison will not be affected. Inside the safe are 400 sp and an unmarked bottle of clear liquid (a potion of healing). Room #4 (15' square): This was the office of the tower commander, though all furnishings have been removed. Two terrified prisoners huddle in one corner, their hands and feet in chains. Guarding the prisoners are 4 hobgoblins (AC 6, HD 1 + 1, hp 7, 9, 4, 5, MV 90' (30'), #AT 1, D 1-8, Save F: 1, ML 8, AL Chaotic) who will fight anyone who tries to rescue the prisoners. The largest hobgoblin has a locked iron box which contains 500 sp and a jeweled necklace worth 1100 gp. Underneath a rug in the middle of the floor is a trapdoor to the 2nd level. Room #5 (15' square): Once this room was a chapel, but now the altar is covered with dust. On the altar is a grime-covered statuette depicting a muscular man with a rat's head. Most of the twelve goblins (AC 6, HD 1-1, hp 5 each, MV 60' (20'), #AT 1, D 1-6, Save F: 1, ML 7, AL Chaotic) are either sleeping on crude bunks along the walls or playing dice games in a corner while two of them watch the door. If loud noises are made in the corridor outside, all the goblins will be awake when the party enters. They have no treasure. Room #6 (10' square): It is difficult to determine what this room was used for. It is empty except for a few splinters of wood, which may mean that the furniture was broken up (probably to serve as firewood). The room is empty of monsters, treasure, and traps. Room #7 (10' square): This room is similar to #6, but there is a green slime (AC none, HD 2•, hp 13, MV 3' (l'), #AT special, D special, Save F: 1, ML 12, AL Neutral) clinging to the ceiling. A cautious party will see the slime, but an unwary party will not see it until it falls on one of them. Room #8 (15' square): This room was once a guard barracks. The floor has collapsed and the ceiling leaks. The result is a 3' deep pool filled with scummy water. A partially waterlogged bunk floats in the water. A rusted iron statue of a beautiful warrior maiden lies at the bottom of the pool. The water is safe to walk through, and the statue is harmless and worthless. Room #9 (5' E-W, 10' N-S): This cubbyhole has a secret door and was used to spy on those walking down the corridor. There are now 4 goblins (AC 6, HD 1-1, hp 5, 3, 4, 1, MV 60' (20'), # AT 1, D 1-6. Save F: 1, ML 7, AL Chaotic) in the room, spying on anyone approaching in the corridor. They have no treasure. 856\n\nHAUNTED KEEP East Tower 3 T ( l & 9 6 _—— © 4 { 7 I t ) [ L i 1% m * 5 -O i -c 1 West Tower Scale: 1 square = 5' Haunted Keep — First Level East Tower N Ruins B57\n\nDoor Double Door Secret Door One Way Door False Door Revolving Door Concealed Door Archway Door Open Doorway Portcullis or Bars Trap Door In Ceiling Trap Door In Floor Secret Trap Door One Way Secret Door o HIM Well Pool Dais Altar Fireplace Table, Chest Bed Curtain Window Arrow Slit Railing Illusionary Wall Rock Wall Rock Column Stalactite Stalagmite Rubble Crevasse Sinkhole Submerged Path Subterranean Passage Depression Pool or Lake Stream Elevated Ledge Natural Chimney B58\n\nD&D: BASIC Sample Dungeon Expedition THE SITUATION: This party includes four 2nd level characters and a 1st level dwarf: Morgan Ironwolf, a female fighter (the caller); Silverleaf, an elf; Fredrik, a dwarf; Sister Rebecca, a cleric; and Black Dougal, a thief. After equipping themselves, these characters have journeyed to the Haunted Keep and discovered the trap door in room 4, leading to the second level. As caller, Morgan relays the party's actions to the DM after the characters decide what they want to do. DM: \"Having killed the hobgoblins, you open the trap door and find a set of stairs going down to the south.\" Morgan: \"We're going down the stairs.\" DM: \"After 30' you reach a round landing with two sets of stairs. One goes down to the east and the other goes down to the west.\" Morgan: \"Fredrik looks down the east staircase and Silverleaf looks down the west one. What do they see?\" DM: \"The party's torches mess up their infravision, so they can only see twenty to thirty feet. The west stairs go down ten feet and turn sharply south. The east stairs go down at least thirty feet. Also, Fred smells a rank, musty odor coming up from below.\" Fredrik: \"Hey everybody! There's something down there. I don't like it!\" Morgan: \"Anyone want to go down the east stairs? . . . OK, we're going down the west stairs.\" DM: \"You go ten feet down the west stairs; it turns south to 20', 30' down; the stairs end and you step into a 20' wide corridor that goes east and west. You see a door 10' up the west corridor on the north wall.\" Rebecca (mapping): \"That was the north wall?\" DM: \"Yes, the door is in the north wall.\" Morgan: \"We're going to the door. Silverleaf, Black Dougal, and I will listen.\" DM: \"As you step into the corridor, a breeze from the west makes your torches flicker.\" Rebecca: \"Is it strong enough to put them out?\" DM: \"No,\" (chuckling) \"not yet.\" Morgan: \"Then we'll listen at the door.\" DM (Rolling three dice for listening): \"You don't hear anything.\" Morgan (After a discussion with the others): \"We'll leave the door and go down the passage to the west.\" DM: \"After 30' there is a side passage to the south, 10' wide. The main corridor continues west. You notice the breeze is stronger and your torches are beginning to flicker even more.\" Fredrik: \"I don't like this.\" Dougal: \"You'ue got infravision.\" Morgan: \"We'll take the side passage.\" DM: \"OK. After 50' you find doors to the east and west. The passage continues south.\" Morgan: \"Silverleaf, Fred, and Black Dougal will listen at the west door.\" DM (rolling): \"Black Dougal hears muttering voices.\" Dougal: \"Do I understand them? I speak Common, Ore, Goblin and Elvish.\" DM (after deciding on a chance for Dougal to recognize goblin language through the heavy door, and then rolling): \"No, the voices aren't loud enough.\" Morgan: \"We're getting ready for combat. Fred and I will force the door.\" Dougal: \"I'll guard the rear!\" DM: \"OK. The party is set, with Black Dougal guarding the rear.\" (Rolling to see if the door is forced) \"it opens. You see half a dozen goblins.\" Fredrik: \"Let me at them!\" DM: \"You can't be surprised, but they can be ... \" (rolling for DM INSTRUCTIONS surprise) . . . \"no. Roll for initiative, please.\" Morgan: \"Fred rolled a 2.\" DM (rolling): \"The goblins have the iniative.\" (Rolling reaction for the goblins) \"They must have heard you, Fred. They charge, yelling, 'Kill the dwarf! Chop them to hamburger!' \" (Combat is now resolved, morale checks taken, etc. The goblins fight until all are dead. It is now time to check for wandering monsters, but the DM's roll indicates that none appear.) Morgan: \"OK, what does the room look like? We are checking the floor and ceiling, too.\" DM: \"The room is six-sided, 30' on a side and 20' high. The door you came in is the only one you see. There is nothing unusual about the floor or ceiling. Besides the bodies of the goblins, there is a wooden box along the northeast wall and a pile of old rags in the north corner.\" Morgan: \"Silverleaf is checking for secret doors, Fred is looking for traps, Black Dougal is examining the box, and Sister Rebecca is guarding the door. I'm prodding the rags with my sword — any movement?\" DM (after rolling for the appropriate chances): \"Silverleaf notices that one of the stone blocks in the southwest wall is slightly discolored. Fred does not see any traps. The box is the size of a small trunk; it is latched, but not locked. Morgan: nothing moves in the pile of rags.\" Fredrik: \"I want to have a look at that block, Silverleaf.\" Morgan: \"Fred examines the block.\" Fredrik: \"For traps.\" Morgan: \"Sorry, Fred; for traps.\" Dougal: \"I'm looking for traps on the box, too.\" DM (rolling for Fred, even though the block is not trapped; the DM also rolls for Dougal's \"find traps\" ability. The roll indicates that Dougal has failed to find the poisoned needle in the latch.) \"Neither of you finds a trap.\" Fredrik: \"I'm pushing, pulling, and trying to twist the block.\" DM: \"When you push it, a secret door opens in the west section of the southwest wall. You see a 5' wide corridor that goes south for 30' and ends at a door.\" Morgan: \"Fred and Silverleaf will guard the secret door, and Black Dougal will open the box. I'll search through the rags. Anything that looks like a cloak or boots?\" DM: \"Black Dougal, you find out that you missed a tiny discolored needle in the latch. Roll a saving throw vs. Poison, please!\" Dougal (rolling): \"Missed it!\" DM: \"Black Dougal gasps 'Poison!' and falls to the floor. He looks dead.\" Fredrik: \"I'm grabbing his pack to carry treasure in.\" Rebecca: \"I'm giving Black Dougal the last rites of my church.\" DM: \"OK. Meanwhile, Fred, you find the box is full of silver, perhaps two thousand pieces. Morgan, you do find a pair of old boots, but nothing like a cloak.\" Morgan: \"Fred will dump the silver and look for hidden compartments in the box. I'll try on the boots and see if I move silently — we could use a pair of elven boots!\" DM (rolling another wandering monster check): \"Fred finds a false bottom in the box. It contains another smaller box of carved ivory that holds two gold bracelets set with jade.\" Fredrik: \"How valuable do they look?\" DM: \"You think the jewel case is worth 100 gp and each bracelet is worth about 600 gp. Morgan seems to be moving very quietly.\" Morgan: \"GREAT! I'll put the case and jewels in my pack and then watch the door as the others take turns filling their packs with silver.\" Fredrik: \"I'll dump out Dougal's pack and fill it with coins.\" DM: \"OK; the loading will take four turns.\" (The DM makes the wandering monster checks. As the party finishes loading, a large party of bandits approaches. Since Morgan is watching the door, the DM gives a very high chance that the bandits B59\n\nDM INSTRUCTIONS D&D: BASIC will be heard.) \"As you finish loading, Morgan hears the tramp of many booted feet coming from the north. It's getting louder. . . .\" Morgan: \"We'll beat a hasty retreat through the secret door. Fred will go first, then me. Silverleaf is next, and Sister Rebecca will bring up the rear. She'll spike the door shut behind us.\" Fredrick: \"Before we do I grab Dougal's body. We can't leave him behind.\" DM: \"OK. As you reach the end of the secret passage, you hear a cry of discovery and a babble of voices from the room behind you. Black Dougal's tools and rations have been discovered.\" Morgan: \"What?! Didn't anyone bring his things along?\" All: \"No!\" Morgan: \"Nuts! We're going to be more careful from here on, gang. Anyhow, Fred will listen at the door. I have my bow ready.\" DM (rolling): \"Fred, you don't hear anything.\" Morgan: \"Fred will force open the door.\" DM (rolling): \"It opens. You see a square room, 30' on a side and 20' high. Your door is in the west section of the north wall. You don't see any other exits. The room appears to be empty.\" Rebecca: \"What about behind us?\" DM: \"The voices have died down and you don't hear anything.\" Morgan: \"We'll search the room very carefully, taking at least two turns. Silverleaf and Sister Rebecca are looking for secret doors and Fred is looking for shifting walls. I'm guarding the rear.\" DM (rolling for wandering monsters): \"OK. You search for two turns. You don't find anything, but something finds you. A secret door that Silverleaf and Sister Rebecca didn't find in the south wall opens, and two hobgoblins stroll in .. . .\" (At this point, the time scale shifts from turns to rounds. This encounter is the example at the end of COMBAT, page B28). Dungeon Mastering as a Fine Art The success of an adventure depends on the DM and his or her creation, the dungeon. The DM should have the dungeon carefully mapped out before play begins. Even so, a DM will quickly find that it is impossible to predict every possibility. After all, there are several players, and only one DM! It is not unusual for players to find a solution, or pose a new problem, that the DM has not even thought of. It is very important for the DM to be flexible. It is important that the DM be fair, judging everything without favoring one side or another. The DM is there to see that the adventure is interesting and that everyone enjoys the game. DAD is not a contest between the DM and the players! The DM should do his or her best to act impartially when taking the part of monsters or handling disputes between characters. \"That's not in the rules!\" The players will often surprise the DM by doing the unexpected. Don't panic. When this happens, the DM should just make sure that everything is done in the order given by the outline or sequence of events being used. Minor details may be made up as needed to keep the game moving. All DMs learn how to handle both new ideas and unusual actions quickly and with imagination. Quite often a DM can decide on a solution to a player's actions not covered by these rules. Other times, a problem may have no simple solution. One quick way for a DM to decide whether a solution will work is by imagining the situation, and then choosing percentage chances for different possibilities. For example, suppose the DM is running a combat that is taking place on a ledge next to an unexplored chasm. One player suddenly decides that his character has no chance to survive combat. The player announces \"My character wants to jump into the chasm to escape!\" There may be a chance that he will fall to a nearby ledge or land in a pool of water at the bottom of the chasm. The DM thinks about the dungeon for a minute, and remembers that an underground river flows through some of the lower dungeon levels, so there might be a pool below. Even so, the character will fall 60', and a normal fall will do Id6 points of damage per 10' fallen. This character has only 7 hp, and seems likely to die even if the water cushions his landing and reduces the damage. However, there should always be a chance to do something nearly impossible. A player should have, at the very least, a saving throw or a stated percentage chance of a miraculous occurrence saving the character. The DM answers: \"Looking down into the chasm, your character can estimate that he has a 98% chance of dying, no saving throw, if he jumps. If you decide your character jumps, roll percentage dice. A result of 99 or 00 will mean that your character lives, but any other result will mean that he will die in the attempt. Do you still want to jump?\" \"There's always a chance.\" The DM may want to base a character's chance of doing something on his or her ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, and so forth). To perform a difficult task (such as climbing up a rope or thinking of a forgotten clue), the player should roll the ability score or less on ld20. The DM may give a bonus or penalty to the roll, depending on the difficulty of the action (-4 for a simple task to + 4 for a difficult one). A roll of 1 should always succeed, and a roll of 20 should always fail. \"The DM is the Boss.\" The DM decides how these rules will be used in the game. A good DM talks about problem areas with the players and considers reasonable requests by them. The players should realize, however, that the final decision is the DM's: not theirs, and not this booklet's! If a disagreement holds up play, the DM may make a temporary decision and talk it over with the players when the adventure is over. If a player disagrees strongly enough, he or she may quit the game. It is up to the DM to create an adventure the players can enjoy. \"Everyone is here to have fun.\" The DM should make the adventure seem as \"real\" to the players as possible. All should avoid getting stuck in long discussions about rules or procedures. The game should move along with humor, as well as excitement. \"Everything is balanced.\" The DM should try to maintain the \"balance of play\". The treasures should be balanced by the dangers. Some groups prefer adventures where advancement between levels is swift. In such a case, since the treasures are generally greater, the monsters should be \"tougher\". Other groups prefer adventures where character development is more important, and advancement is slower. If the monsters are too tough, and if the parties are reduced by many deaths, then few characters will ever reach higher levels. (The DM should keep in mind that further supplements will detail character levels up to the 36th. It should be very difficult for a character to attain this level, but it should not be impossible). \"Your character doesn't know that.\" A player should not allow his or her character to act on information that character has no way of knowing (for example, attacking an NPC because the NPC killed a previous character run by the player, even though the NPC and current character have never met). If the players get careless about this the DM should remind them. The DM may, in addition, forbid certain actions to the characters involved. The DM should make it clear to the players before the adventure begins that characters may not act on information they don't have. It will save lots of time later. The following tips are optional suggestions, which the DM may or may not wish to use: MAPPING: Mapping during an adventure can sometimes be a difficult task. One way to save mapping time is to describe the map in terms of squares rather than feet. Such a description is easier for B60\n\nD&D: BASIC DM INSTRUCTIONS the mapper to follow, since the mapper need not translate feet to squares before drawing the map. Scale is very important when giving directions in terms of squares. Whenever the characters are expected to know the shape of a dungeon, the DM should draw this outline before play begins. Even if the outline cannot be given to the players, the DM should still draw in a starting door, room, or corridor. The DM can also save mapping time by drawing in complex rooms for the mapper. However, this should only be done in extreme situations. Players should learn to become good mappers, and the only way they will learn is by doing it themselves. MONSTER DESCRIPTIONS: When the characters first encounter monsters, the DM should describe what the monsters look like, instead of merely giving the name of the monsters. The players will eventually recognize monsters by their descriptions. MONSTER HIT POINTS: The DM should never reveal the hit points of the monsters. It is enough to tell the players how a monster reacts after a successful attack. For example: \"It's bleeding from a number of wounds and staggering a bit, but it's still fighting\". The players should not know the level of an NPC until they have adventured with him or her. SURPRISE: When monsters attack by surprise, the DM does not need to describe the monster. It is enough for the DM to describe the attack. For example: \"From out of the dark shadows, Morgan Ironwolf suddenly feels a paw reach out and claw her leg. She takes 3 points of damage.\" Of course, the monster should be described after the surprise round is over. Continuing the above example: \"You then see by your flickering torchlight that a huge bear-like creature with a head like a great bird is charging you!\" If the party had seen an owlbear before, it could just be named; however, the mysterious appearance of an unknown monster is part of the thrill of the game. MAGIC ITEMS: When describing magical treasure items, the DM should only do so in general terms. For example: \"A ring\" should be mentioned, not \"a ring of invisibility\". Characters must experiment to find out what an item does. Magical weapons and armor usually reveal their true natures after being used in combat. DIVIDING MAGICAL TREASURE: While it is not the DM's job to divide treasure between the players, the DM may offer suggestions. Non-magical treasure is usually divided evenly among all surviving players. Magical treasures may be divided by the players' choice, or by having each player roll d%: the highest roll would get first pick of magical items, the second highest would get second pick, and so forth. PLAYER ADVANCEMENT: If no one has reached the 2nd level of experience in three or four adventures, the DM should consider giving more treasure. If most of the players have reached the 3rd level of experience in this time, the DM should consider cutting down the amount of treasure, or increasing the \"toughness\" of the monsters. GRUDGES: Occasionally, a grudge develops between characters. A small grudge can often make the game more interesting, particularly if the grudge develops because the players are playing their character roles well. For example, a Lawful character might have a grudge with a Chaotic character who slew a prisoner after the Lawful character gave his word that the prisoner would not be harmed. If any grudge gets out of hand, the DM should try to subtly warn the players. If a grudge develops to a point where it is ruining the adventure, the DM may have a powerful creature interfere. The DM may plan an encounter with a gold dragon who tells the players that, unless the grudge ends immediately, severe steps will be taken (at most, the deaths of the offending characters). MINIATURE FIGURES: D&D adventures are more interesting to play when figures are used. Metal miniatures (about 15 to 25 millimeters high) are often used, for they can be easily painted to look like real dungeon adventurers. Many excellent figures are designed specially for fantasy role playing games. These are available from TSR or from local hobby stores. If metal miniatures cost more than the players want to spend, many companies make inexpensive packs of plastic figures. These are not specifically made for fantasy role playing, but can easily be adapted for it. Inexpensive plastic monsters of many sizes are also available in local stores. PLAYING SURFACE: Combats are easy to keep track of when large sheets of graph paper, covered with plexiglass or transparent adhesive plastic (contact paper), are used to put the figures on. The best sheets for this use have 1\" squares, and the scale of 1\" = 5' should be used when moving the figures. With water-based markers or grease pencils, an entire room or battle can be drawn in just a few seconds. When the battle is over, the board may be wiped off, leaving it ready for the next combat. Dominoes or plastic building blocks can also be used to outline walls and corridors. When using figures, the DM should make sure that a solid table top is used, so the figures won't fall over when the table is bumped.

While it was not possible to cover everything that might happen in a game, the ideas here give a solid framework to build on. And there is more to come! The D&D EXPERT SET expands the game, with lots of new monsters, spells, treasures, and information for character levels 4-14. The D&D COMPANION SUPPLEMENT adds even more, and explains characters to 36th level. To add to the games, TSR also publishes dungeon modules especially for use with DUNGEONS & DRAGONS® games. The \"B\" series of modules (including Bl: In Search of the Unknown and B2: The Keep on the Borderlands) are an excellent source of ideas to build on or add to a campaign \"world\". TSR is happy to answer questions about DUNGEONS & DRAGONS rules. When writing, leave room to put the answers with the questions, enclose a stamped self-addressed envelope, and send it to: D&D Questions TSR Games POB 756 Lake Geneva, WI 53147 B61\n\nGLOSSARY adventure — Any session where a DM and players meet to play a D&D game. alignment — The general pattern of behavior of monsters and characters in D&D rules. area (of effect) — The space and those objects and creatures within the space which are affected by the results of a spell, breath weapon, magical device and other attacks which can strike multiple targets.

Sometimes a little research is useful to improve a dungeon, flesh out a scenario, and provide inspiration for a campaign. Books on folklore, mythology, fairy tales, bestiaries, and knightly legends can often help the DM fill in important details of a campaign, but fictional tales and fantasy novels usually provide the best sources of inspiration. The following list includes some books which might prove useful. A title list followed by \"et al.\" means that the author has written more fantasy titles than those which can be listed in the limited space available. Note that some books listed as \"nonfiction\" are about myths or legends, but are labeled as non-fiction because they are not on the fiction shelves of the library or bookstore.
