        "text": "Inspirational Source Material\n\nA good D&D campaign is imaginative and creative. Sometimes a little research is useful to improve a dungeon, flesh out a scenario, and provide inspiration for a campaign. Books on folklore, mythology, fairy tales, bestiaries, and knightly legends can often help the DM fill in important details of a campaign, but fictional tales and fantasy novels usually provide the best sources of inspiration. The following list includes some books which might prove useful. A title list followed by “et al.” means that the author has written more fantasy titles than those which can be listed in the limited space available. Note that some books listed as “non-fiction\" are about myths or legends, but are labeled as non-fiction because they are not on the fiction shelves of the library or bookstore.\n\nFiction: Young Adult Fantasy\n\nAlexander, Lloyd — The Book of Three; Black Cauldron; Castle of Llyr, et al.\n\nBaum, L.
