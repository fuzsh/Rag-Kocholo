        "text": "Back in 1981, TSR released the ‘Basic’ Dungeons and Dragons game. It came in a red box and featured an evocative cover by Erol Otus. Written by Thomas Moldvay, this version of the game is often referred to as Moldvay D&D or, when including the follow-on ‘Expert’ ruleset, B/X D&D. By 1981 I was already well into the hobby and owned the D&D boxed set written by J. Eric Holmes and all the Advanced D&D books, so I never picked this up. For this reason, I missed out on Moldvay’s version of ‘Appendix N’ which was titled ‘Inspirational Source Material’.\n\nMoldvay’s reading list is much more complete than Gary Gygax’s Appendix N. Gygax’s list is missing several well-regarded fantasy authors, including Clark Ashton Smith, CS Lewis, Katherine Kurtz, and Lloyd Alexander. I read somewhere that when asked why he had not included Clark Ashton Smith Gygax stated that he had simply never heard of him and was not familiar with his work. That’s as good a reason as any. Back when I first got into Dungeons and Dragons, I simply assumed that since Gary Gygax was the creator of D&D (Arneson was nowhere mentioned) he was some sort of scholar concerning all things fantasy. Of course, that was not true. When Gygax wrote the original DMs Guide, he was a 40-year-old man with five kids and bills to pay. Frankly, I’m surprised he was as well read as he evidently was.\n\nThe Moldvay D&D boxed set was geared towards introducing and explaining the game to new players, both young adult and adult. For this reason, evidently, there is a young adult section for both fantasy fiction and non-fiction.\n\nBelow is the list that was presented on page 63 of the Moldvay Dungeons and Dragons Basic Rulebook.\n\nINSPIRATIONAL SOURCE MATERIAL\n\nA good D&D campaign is imaginative and creative. Sometimes a little research is useful to improve a dungeon, flesh out a scenario, and provide inspiration for a campaign. Books on folklore, mythology, fairy tales, bestiaries, and knightly legends can often help the DM fill in important details of a campaign, but fictional tales and fantasy novels usually provide the best sources of inspiration. The following list includes some books which might prove useful. A title list followed by “et al.” means that the author has written more fantasy titles than those which can be listed in the limited space available. Note that some books listed as “non-fiction” are about myths or legends, but are labeled as non-fiction because they are not on the fiction shelves of the library or bookstore.\n\nFiction: Young Adult Fantasy\n\nAlexander, Lloyd – The Book of Three, The Black Cauldron, The Castle of Llyr, et al.\n\nBaum, L.

For those not in the know, First Man is basically the story of Neil Armstrong and the circumstances leading up to his historic landing on the Moon.\n\nThe Good\n\nIt’s about the Gemini and Apollo programs, what’s not to like!? As a history buff and a fan of NASA I tend to love this stuff. Ryan Gosling portrays Armstrong and does a really good job, imo.\n\nThe Bad\n\nNot really a knock on the movie but more of a personal preference, I would have liked more space program, less focus on his family/civilian life. Others might feel differently.\n\nThe Ugly\n\nSo, about half way through the movie I start feeling nauseous. I’m thinking I’m coming down with something then realize that the movie is actually making me motion sick! The director Damien Chazelle made some interesting choices. He shows Armstrong’s Gemini launch from the perspective of the guys in the capsule, you never actually see the rocket – I actually thought it was pretty cool. But part of experiencing the launch was mimicking the shaking of the rocket. That’s when I think I started getting motion sick. Later, the capsule Armstrong is in starts rolling out of control – an actual incident that almost kills him and his crew mate – this is also shown from the astronauts’ perspective. Yeah, that didn’t help either. There’s a lot of ‘shaky jerky’ camera movement in the movie, including times when I didn’t think it was necessary. I do have issues with motion sickness, but damn!\n\nPolitical BS\n\nFirst Man is about American History and the Apollo space program so; of course, it becomes another flash point in the ongoing-never ending Culture War. Because why not?\n\nFrom the Right, the complaint is that the movie does not show Armstrong planting the American flag, because of that it is somehow anti-American. I find the complaint absurd. The American flag is all over the movie including a scene where Armstrong’s son unfurls the flag on his front porch while his dad is on his Gemini flight. They do show the American flag on the moon at one point. The movie is in no way anti-American. It drives me crazy that people complained about this without actually seeing the movie.\n\nFrom the Left, we’ve got the usual complaint that the movie is too focused on a bunch of white guys and that there are no faces of color. I find the complaint absurd. The movie is a historical look at the US space program in the 1960s through the eyes of the astronauts. They were all white, all male – their colleagues at NASA overwhelmingly the same. It wasn’t right, but that’s the way it was. What was Chazelle supposed to do, make Buzz Aldrin African-American?\n\nWhen I left the theater, I’d have given the movie a 6 or 7 out of 10, mostly because I was expecting the Right Stuff and that’s not what I got. The movie has stuck with me though. I wasn’t sure about some of Chazelle’s directing decisions but I’ve decided I like his style. I’d give it an 8 out of 10. Even with the ‘shaky jerky’ camera movement, I liked it a lot."
