        "text": "Back in 1981, TSR released the ‘Basic’ Dungeons and Dragons game. It came in a red box and featured an evocative cover by Erol Otus. Written by Thomas Moldvay, this version of the game is often referred to as Moldvay D&D or, when including the follow-on ‘Expert’ ruleset, B/X D&D. By 1981 I was already well into the hobby and owned the D&D boxed set written by J. Eric Holmes and all the Advanced D&D books, so I never picked this up. For this reason, I missed out on Moldvay’s version of ‘Appendix N’ which was titled ‘Inspirational Source Material’.\n\nMoldvay’s reading list is much more complete than Gary Gygax’s Appendix N. Gygax’s list is missing several well-regarded fantasy authors, including Clark Ashton Smith, CS Lewis, Katherine Kurtz, and Lloyd Alexander. I read somewhere that when asked why he had not included Clark Ashton Smith Gygax stated that he had simply never heard of him and was not familiar with his work. That’s as good a reason as any. Back when I first got into Dungeons and Dragons, I simply assumed that since Gary Gygax was the creator of D&D (Arneson was nowhere mentioned) he was some sort of scholar concerning all things fantasy. Of course, that was not true. When Gygax wrote the original DMs Guide, he was a 40-year-old man with five kids and bills to pay. Frankly, I’m surprised he was as well read as he evidently was.\n\nThe Moldvay D&D boxed set was geared towards introducing and explaining the game to new players, both young adult and adult. For this reason, evidently, there is a young adult section for both fantasy fiction and non-fiction.\n\nBelow is the list that was presented on page 63 of the Moldvay Dungeons and Dragons Basic Rulebook.\n\nINSPIRATIONAL SOURCE MATERIAL\n\nA good D&D campaign is imaginative and creative. Sometimes a little research is useful to improve a dungeon, flesh out a scenario, and provide inspiration for a campaign. Books on folklore, mythology, fairy tales, bestiaries, and knightly legends can often help the DM fill in important details of a campaign, but fictional tales and fantasy novels usually provide the best sources of inspiration. The following list includes some books which might prove useful. A title list followed by “et al.” means that the author has written more fantasy titles than those which can be listed in the limited space available. Note that some books listed as “non-fiction” are about myths or legends, but are labeled as non-fiction because they are not on the fiction shelves of the library or bookstore.\n\nFiction: Young Adult Fantasy\n\nAlexander, Lloyd – The Book of Three, The Black Cauldron, The Castle of Llyr, et al.\n\nBaum, L.
