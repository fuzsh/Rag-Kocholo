A TIMESCAPE HARDCOVER Distributed by Simon and Schuster Critics have long complained about science fictions normally skimpy characterization, but here is a story that is full of color and action and which also creates one of SFs memorable characters, the Abbess Radegunde. Joanna Russ tells us that this is part of a longer work, a future history, which she is currently writing (though this story is complete and may be enjoyed on its own). Souls BY JOANNA RUSS Deprived of other Banquet I entertained myself— —Emily Dickinson T ■ his is the tale of the Abbess Radegunde and what happened when the Norsemen came. 1 teU it not as it was told to me but as 1 saw it, for 1 was a child then and the Abbess had made a pet and errand boy of me, although the stem old Wardress, Cunigunt, who had outlived the previous Abbess, »id I was more in the Abbey than out of it and a scandal. But the Abbess would only say mildly, \"Dear Cunigimt, a scandal at the age of seven?\" which was turning it off with a joke, for she knew how harsh and disliking my new stepmother was to me and my father did not care and I with no sisters or brothers. You must understand that joking and calling people \"dear\" and \"my dear\" was only her manner; she was in every way an unusual woman. The previous Abbess, Herrade, had found that Radegunde, who had been given to her to be fostered, had great gifts and so sent the child south to be taught, and that has never happened here before. The story has it that the Abbess Herrade found Radegunde seeming to read the great illuminated book in the Abbess's study; the child had somehow pulled it off its stand and was sitting on the floor with the vol- ume in her lap, sucking her thumb, and turning the pages with her other hand just as if she were reading. \"Little two-years,\" said the Abbess Herrade, who was a kind woman, \"what are you doing?\" She thought it amusing, 1 suppose, that Radegunde should pretend to read this great book, the largest and finest in the Abbey, Souls 7 which had many, many books more than any other nunnery or monastery 1 have ever heard of: a full forty then, as I remember. And then litde Radegunde was doing the book no harm. '\"Reading, Mother,\" said the little girl. \"Oh, reading?\" said the Abbess, smiling. 'Then tell me what you are reading,\" and she pointed to the page. \"This,\" said Radegunde, \"is a great D with flowers and other beautiful things about it, which is to show that Dominus, our Lord God, is the greatest thing and the most beautiful and makes everything to grow and be beautiful, and then it goes on to say Domine nobis pacem, which means Give peace to us, O Lord.\" Then the Abbess began to be fright- ened but she said only, \"Who showed you this?\" thinking that Radegunde had heard someone read and tell the words or had been pestering the nuns on the sly. \"No one,\" said the child. \"Shall I go on?\" and she read page after page of the Latin, in each case telling what the words meant. There is more to the story, but I will say only that after many prayers the Abbess Herrade sent her foster daughter far southwards, even to Poitiers, where Saint Radegunde had ruled an Abbey before, and some say even to Rome, and in these places Radegtmde was taught all learning, for all learning there is in the world re- mains in these places. Radegunde came back a grown woman and nursed the Abbess through her last illness and then became Abbess in her turn. They say that the great folk of the Church down there in the south wanted to keep her because she was such a prodi- gy of female piety and learning, there where life is safe and comfortable and less rude than it is here, but she said that the gray skies and flooding win- ters of her birthplace caUed to her very soul. She often told me the story when i was a child: how headstrong she had been and how defiant, and how she had sickened so desperately for her native land that they had sent her back, deciding that a rude life in the mud of a northern village would be a good cure for such a rebellious soul as hers. \"And so it was,\" she would say, patting my cheek or tweaking my ear. \"See how humble I am now?\" for you understand, all this about her rebel- lious girlhood, twenty years' back, was a kind of joke between us. \"Don't you do it,\" she would tell me and we would laugh together, I so heartily at the very idea of my being a pious monk full of learning that 1 would hold my sides and be unable to speak.. She was kind to everyone. She knew all the languages, not only ours, but the Irish too and the tongues folk speak to the north and south, and La- tin and Greek also, and all the other languages in the world, both to read and write. She knew how to cure sick- ness, both the old women's way with 8 Fantasy & Science Fiction herbs or leeches and out of books also. And never was there a more pious woman I Some speak ill of her now she's gone and say she was too merry to be a good Abbess, but she would say, \"Merriment is God's flowers,\" and when the winter wind blew her head- dress awry and showed the gray hair — which happened once; I was there and saw the shocked faces of the Sis- ters with her — she merely tapp>ed the band back into place, smiling and say- ing, \"Impudent wind! Thou showest thou hast power which is more than our siUy human power, for it is from God\" — and this quite satisfied the girls with her. No one ever saw her angry. She was impatient sometimes, but in a kindly' way, as if her mind were else- where. It was in Heaven, I used to think, for I have seen her pray for hours or sink to her knees — right in the marsh! — to see the wild duck fly south, her hands clasped and a kind of wild joy on her face, only to rise a mo- ment later, looking at the mud on her habit and crying half-ruefully, half in laughter, \"Oh, what will Sister Laun- dress say to me? I am hopeless! Dear child, tell no one; I will say I fell,\" and then she would clap her hand to her mouth, turning red and laughing even harder, saying, \"I am hopeless, telling lies!\" The town thought her a saint, of course. We were all happy then, or so it seems to me now, and all lucky and well, with this happiness of having her amongst us burning and blooming in our midst like a great fire around which we could all warm ourselves, even those who didn't know why life seemed so good. There was less illness; the food was better; the very weather stayed mild; and people did not quar- rel as they had before her time and do again now. Nor do I think, considering what happened at the end, that all this was nothing but the fancy of a boy who's found his mother, for that's what she was to me; I brought her all the gossip and ran errands when I could, and she called me Boy News in Latin; I was happier than I have ever been. And then one day those terrible, beaked prows appeared in our river. 1 was with her when the warning came, in the main room of the Abbey tower just after the first fire of the year had been lit in the great hearth; we thought ourselves safe, for they had never been seen so far south and it was too late in the year for any sensible shipman to be in our waters. The Ab- bey was host to three Irish priests who turned pale when young Sister Sibihd burst in with the news, crying and wringing her hands; one of the brothers exclaimed a thing in Latin which means \"God protect us!\" for they had been telling us stories of the terrible sack of the monastery of Saint Columbanus and how everyone had run away with the precious manu- scripts or had hidden in the woods, and that was how Father Cairbre and Souls 9 the two others had decided to go 'walk the world/' for this (the Abbess had been telling it all to me, for 1 had no Latin) is what the Irish say when they leave their native land to travel else- where. \"God protects our souls, not our bodies,\" said the Abbess Radegunde briskly. She had been talking with the priests in their own language or in the Latin, but this she said in ours so even the women workers from the village would understand. Then she said, \"Father Cairbre, take your friends and the younger Sisters to the underground passages; Sister Diemud, open the gates to the villagers; half of them will be trying to get behind the Abbey walls and the others will be fleeing to the marsh. You, Boy News, down to the cellars with the girls.\" But I did not go and she never saw it; she was up and looking out one of the window slits in- stantly. So was 1. 1 had always thought the Norsemen's big ships came right up on land — on legs, I supposed — and was disappointed to see that after they came up our river they stayed in the water like other ships and the men were coming ashore in little boats, which they were busy pulling up on shore through the sand and mud. Then the Abbess repeated her order — \"Quickly! Quickly!\" — and before anyone knew what had happened, she was gone from the room. I watched from the tower window; in the turmoO nobody bothered about me. Below, the Abbey grotmds and gardens were packed with folk, all stepping on the herb plots and the Abbess's paestum roses, and great logs were being drag- ged to bar the door set in the stone walls round the Abbey, not high walls, to tell truth, and Radegunde was going quickly through the crowd, crying; Do this! Do that! Stay, thou! Go, thou! and like things. Then she reached the door and mo- tioned Sister Oddha, the doorkeeper, aside — the old Sister actually fell to her knees in entreaty — and all this, you must understand, was wonderful- ly pleasant to me. I had no more idea of danger than a puppy. There was some tumult by the door — I think the men with the logs were trying to get in her way — and Abbess Radegunde took out from the neck of her habit her silver crucifix, brought all the wa> from Rome, and shook it impatiently at those who would keep her in. So or course they let her through at once. I settled into my comer of the win- dow, waiting for the Abbess's crucifix to bring down God's lightning on those tall, fair men who defied CXir Savior and the law and were supposed to wear aiumal horns on their heads, though these did not (and I found out later that's just a story; that is not what the Norse do). I did hope that the Abbess, or CXir Lord, would wait just a little while before destroying them, for I wanted to get a good look at them be- fore they all died, you understand. I was somewhat disappointed, as they seemed to be wearing breeches with 10 Fantasy & Science Fiction leggings under them and tunics on top, like ordinary folk, and cloaks also, though some did carry swords and axes and there were round shields piled on the beach at one place. But the long hair they had was fine,“and the bright colors of their clothes, and the mon- sters growing out of the heads of the ships were splendid and very frighten- ing, even though one could see that they were only painted, like the pic- tures in the Abbess's books. I decided that God had provided me with enough edification and could now strike down the impious strangers. But He did not. Instead the Abbess walked alone ^towards these fierce men, over the stony river bank, as calmly as if she were on a picnic with her girls. She was singing a litde song, a pretty tune that I repeated many years later, and a weU- traveled man said it was a Norse cra- dle-song. I didn't know that then, but only that the terrible, fair men, who had looked up in surprise at seeing one lone woman come out of the Abbey (which was barred behind her; I could see that), now began a sort of whisper- ing astonishment among themselves. I saw the Abbess's gaze go quickly from one to the other — we often said that she could tell what was hidden in the soul from one look at the face — and then she picked the skirt of her habit up with one hand and daintily went among the rocks to one of the men, one older than the others, as it proved later, though I could not see so well at the time — and said to him, in his own language: \"Welcome, Thorvald Einarsson, and what do you, good farmer, so far from your own place, with the harvest ripe and the great autumn storms com- ing on over the sea?\" (You may won- der how I knew what she said when I had no Norse; the truth is that Father Cairbre, who had not gone to the cellars after aU, was looking out the top of the window while I was barely able to peep out the bottom, and he re- peated everything that was said for the folk in the room, who all kept very quiet.) Now you could see that the pirates were dumfounded to hear her speak their own language and even more so that she called one by his name; some stepped backwards and made strange signs in the air and others unsheathed axes or swords and came running to- wards the Abbess. But this Thorvald Einarsson put up his hand for them to stop and laughed heartily. 'ThinkI\" he said. 'There's no magic here, only cleverness — what pair of ears could miss my name with the lot of you bawling out Thorvald Einars- son, help me with this oar; \"Thorvald Einarsson, my leggings are wet to the knees;' Thorvald Einarsson, this stream is as cold as a Fimbul-winterl\" The Abbess Radegunde nodded and smiled. Then she sat down plump on the river bank. She scratched be- hind one ear, as I had often seen her do when she was deep in thought. Then Souls 11 'Grandmother, are you not asham- she said (and I am sure that this talk was carried on in a loud voice so that we in the Abbey could hear it): \"Good friend Thorvald, you are as clever as the tale 1 heard of you from your sister's son, Ranulf, from whom 1 learnt the Norse when 1 was in Rome, and to show you it was he, he always swore by his gray horse, Lamefoot, and he had a difficulty in his speech; he could not say the sounds as we do and so spoke of you always as Torvald/ Is not that so?\" I did not realize it then, being only a child, but the Abbess was — by this speech — claiming hospitality from the man and had also picked by chance or inspiration the cleverest among these thieves, for his next words were: \"I am not the leader. There are no leaders here.\" He was warning her that they were not his men to control, you see. So she scratched behind her ear again and got up. Then she began to wander, as if she did not know what to do, from one to the other of these uneasy folk — for some backed off and made signs at her still, and some took out their knives — singing her little tune again and walk> ing slowly, more bent over and older and infirm-looking than we had ever seen her, one helpless little woman in black before all those fierce men. One wild young pirate snatched the head- dress from her as she passed, leaving her short gray hair bare to the wind; the others laughed and he that had done it cried out: ed?\" \"Why, good friend, of what?\" said she mildly. \"Thou art married to thy Christ,\" he said, holding the head-covering be- hind his back, \"but this bridegroom of thine cannot even defend thee against the shame of having thy head uncover- ed! Now if thou wert married to me—\" There was much laughter. The Ab- bess Radegunde waited until it was over. Then she scratched her bare head and made as if to turn away, but sud- denly she turned back upon him with the age and infirmity dropping from her as if they had been a cloak, seem- ing taller and very grand, as if lit from within by some great fire. She looked directly into his face. This thing she did was something we had all seen, of course, but they had not, nor had they heard that great, grand voice with which she sometimes read the Script- ures to us or talked with us of the wrath of God. I think the young man was frightened, for all his daring. And I know now what I did not then: that the Norse admire courage above all things and that — to be blunt — every- one likes a good story, especially if it happens right in front of your eyes. \"Grandson!\" — and her voice toll- ed like the great bell of God; I think folk must have heard her aU the way to the marsh! — \"Little grandchild, thinkest thou that the Creator of the World who made the stars and the moon and the sun and our bodies. 12 Fantasy Hr Science Fiction too and the change of the seasons and the very earth we stand on — yea, even unto the shit in thy belly! — thinkest thou that such a being has a big house in the sky where he keeps his wives and goes in to fuck them as thou wouldst thyself or like the King of Tur- key? Do not dishonor the wit of the mother who bore thee! We are the ser- vants of God, not his wives, and if we tell our silly girls they are married to the Christus, it is to make them under- stand that they must not run off and marry Otto Farmer or Ekkehard Black- smith, but stick to their work, as they promised. If I told them they were married to an Idea, they would not un- derstand me, and neither dost thou.'' (Here Father Cairbre, above me in the window, muttered in a protesting way about something.) Then the Abbess snatched the silver cross from around her neck and put it into the boy's hand, saying: \"Give this to thy mother with my pity. She must pull out her hair over such a child.\" But he let it fall to the ground. He was red in the face and breathing hard. \"Take it up,\" she said more kindly, \"take it up, boy; it will not hurt thee and there's no magic in it. It's only pure silver and good workmanship; it will make thee rich.\" When she saw that he would not — his hand went to his knife — she tched to herself in a motherly way (or I believe she did, for she waved one hand back and forth as she always did when she made that sound) and got down on her knees — with more difficulty than was truth, I think — saying loudly, \"I will stoop, then; I will stoop,\" and got up, holding it out to him, saying, 'Take. Two sticks tied with a cord would serve me as well.\" The boy cried, his voice breaking, \"My mother is dead and thou art a witch!\" and in an instant he had one arm around the Abbess's neck and with the other his knife at her throat. The man Thorvald Einarsson roared 'Thorfinn!\" but the Abbess only said clearly, \"Let him be. I have shamed this man but did not mean to. He is right to be angry.\" The boy released her and turned his back. I remember wondering if these strangers could weep. Later I heard — and I swear that the Abbess must have somehow known this or felt it, for al- though she was no witch, she could probe a man until she found the sore places in him and that very quickly — that this boy's mother had been known for an adulteress and that no man would own him as a son. It is one thing among those people for a man to have what the Abbess called a con- cubine and they do not hold the children of such in scorn as we do, but it is a different thing when a married woman has more than one man. Such was Thorfinn's case; I suppose that was what had sent him viking. But all this came later; what I saw then — with my nose barely above the window slit — was that the Abbess slipped her crucifix over the hilt of the boy's sword Souls 13 she really wished him to have it, you see — and then walked to a place near the walls of the Abbey but far from the Norsemen. 1 think she meant them to come to her. I saw her pick up her skirts like a peasant woman, sit down with legs crossed, and say in a loud voice: ''Come! Who will bargain with me?\" A few strolled over, laughing, and sat down with her. \"AUI\" she said, gesturing them closer. \"And why should we all come?\" said one who was farthest away. \"Because you will miss a bargain,\" said the Abbess. \"Why should we bargain when we can take?\" said another. \"Because you will only get half,\" said the Abbess. 'The rest you will not find.\" \"We will ransack the Abbey,\" said a third. \"Half the treasure is not in the Ab- bey,\" said she. \"And where is it then?\" She tapped her forehead. They were drifting over by twos and threes. 1 have heard since that the Norse love riddles and this was a sort of riddle; she was giving them good fun. \"If it is in your head,\" said the man Thorvald, who was standing behind the others, arms crossed, '\"we can get it out, can we not?\" And he tapped the hilt of his knife. \"If you frighten me, I shall become confused and remember nothing.\" said the Abbess calmly. \"Besides, do you wish to play that old game? You saw how well it worked the last time. I am surprised at you, Ranulf mother's- brother.\" \"1 will bargain then,\" said the man Thorvald, smiling. \"And the rest of you?\" said Rade- gunde, \"It must be all or none; decide for yourselves whether you wish to save yourselves trouble and danger and be rich,\" and she deliberately turn- ed her back on them. The men moved down to the river's edge and began to talk among themselves, dropping their voices so that we could not hear them any more. Father Cairbre, who was old and short-sighted, cried, \"I cannot hear them. What are they doing?\" and I cleverly said, \"I have good eyes. Father Cairbre,\" and he held me up to see. So it was just at the time that the Abbess Radegunde was facing the Ab- bey tower that I appeared in the win- dow. She clapped one hand across her mouth. Then she walked to the gate and called (in a voice I had learned not to disregard; it had often got me a smacked bottom), \"Boy News, downi Come down to me here at once! And bring Father Cairbre with you.\" I was overjoyed. I had no idea that she might want to protect me if any- thing went wrong. My only thought was that I was going to see it all from wonderfully close by. So I wormed my way, half-suffocated, through the folk in the tower room, stepping on feet 14 Fantasy & Science Fiction and skirts, and having to say every few seconds, ''But I have tol The Abbess wants me,\" and meanwhile she was calling outside like an Empress, \"Let that boy throughi Make a place for that boyl Let the Irish priest through!\" until I crept and pushed and complain- ed my way to the very wall itself — no one was going to open the gate for us, of course — and there was a great fuss and finally someone brought a ladder. I was over at once, but the old priest took a longer time, although it was a low wall, as I've said, the builders hav- ing been somewhat of two minds about making the Abbey into a true fortress. Once outside it was lovely, away from all that crowd, and I ran, glori- ously pleased, to the Abbess, who said only, \"Stay by me, whatever happens,\" and immediately turned her attention away from me. It had taken so long to get Father Cairbre outside the walls that the tall, foreign men had finished their talking and were coming back — all twenty or thirty of them — towards the Abbey and the Abbess Radegunde, and most especially of all, me. I could see Father Cairbre tremble. They did look grim, close by, with their long, wild hair and the brightness of their strange clothes. I remember that they smelled different from us, but cannot remember how after all these years. Then the Abbess spoke to them in that outlandish language of theirs, so strangely light and lilting to hear from their bearded lips, and then she said something in Latin to Father Cair- bre, and he said, with a shake in his voice: \"This is the priest. Father Cairbre, who will say our bargains aloud in our own tongue so that my people may hear. I cannot deal behind their backs. And this is my foster baby, who is very dear to me and who is now having his curiosity rather too much satisfied, I think.\" (I was trying to stand tall like a man but had oiie hand secretly holding onto her skirt; so that was what the foreign men had chuckled at!) The talk went on, but I will tell it as if I had un- derstood the Norse, for to repeat ev- erything twice would be tedious. The Abbess Radegunde said, \"Will you bargain?\" There was a general nodding of heads, with a look of: After all, why not? \"And who wiU speak for you?\" said she. A man stepped forward; I recogniz- ed Thorvald Einarsson. \"Ah, yes,\" said the Abbess dryly. 'The company that has no leaders. Is this leaderless company agreed? Will it abide by its word? I want no treachery- planners, no Breakwords here!\" There was a general mutter at this. The Thorvald man (he was big, close up!) said mildly, \"I sail with none such. Let's begin.\" We all sat down. \"Now,\" said Thorvald Einarsson, raising his eyebrows, \"according to my knowledge of this thing, you begin. And according to my knowledge, you Souls 15 will begin by saying that you are very poor.\" \"But, no,\" said the Abbess, \"we are rich.\" Father Cairbre groaned. A groan answered him from behind the Abbey walls. Only the Abbess and Thorvald Einarsson seemed unmoved; it was as if these two were joking in some way that no one else understood. The Ab- bess went on, saying, \"We are very rich. Within is much silver, much gold, many pearls, and much embroidered cloth, much fine-woven cloth, much carved and painted wood, and many books with gold upon their pages and jewels set into their covers. All this is yours. But we have more and better: herbs and medicines, ways to keep food from spoiling, the knowledge of how to cure the sick; all this is yours. And we have more and better even than this: we have the knowledge of Christ and the perfect understanding of the soul, which is yours too, any time you wish; you have only to accept it.\" Thorvald Einarsson held up his hand. \"We will stop with the first,\" he said, \"and perhaps a little of the sec- ond. That is more practical.\" \"And foolish,\" said the Abbess po- litely, \"in the usual way.\" And again I had the odd feeling that these two were sharing a joke no one else even saw. She added, \"There is one thing you may not have, and that is the most pre- cious of all.\" Thorvald Einarsson looked inquir- ing. \"My people. Their safety is dearer to me than myself. They are not to be touched, not a hair on their heads, not for any reason. Think: you can fight your way into the Abbey easily enough, but the folk in there are very frightened of you, and some of the men are armed. Even a good fighter is cumbered in a crowd. You will slip and fall upon each other without meaning to or knowing that you do so. Heed my counsel. Why play butcher when you can have treasure poured into your laps like kings, without work? And after that there will be as much again, when I lead you to the hidden place. An earl's mountain of treasure. Think of iti And to give all this up for slaves, half of whom will get sick and die before you get them home — and will need to be fed if they are to be any good. Shame on you for bad advice- takers! Imagine what you will say to your wives and families: Here are a few miserable bolts of cloth with blood spots that won't come out, here are some pearls and jewels smashed to powder in the fighting, here is a tom piece of embroidery which was whole until someone stepped on it in the bat- tle, and I had slaves but they died of ill- ness and I fucked a pretty young nun and meant to bring her back, but she leapt into the sea. And, oh, yes, there was twice as much again and all of it whole but we decided not to take that. Too much trouble, you see.\" This was a lively story and the Norsemen enjoyed it. Radegunde held up her hand. 16 Fantasy & Science Fiction 'Teoplel'' she called in German, adding, \"Sea-rovers, hear what I say; I will repeat it for you in your tongue.\" (And so she did.) “People, if the Norsemen fight us, do not defend yourselves but smash everything! Wives, take your cooking knives and shred the valuable cloth to pieces! Men, with your axes and hammers hew the altars and the carved wood to fragkments! All, grind the pearls and smash the jewels against the stone floors! Break the bottles of wine! Pound the gold and silver to shapeless- ness! Tear to pieces the illuminated books! Tear down the hangings and bum them! \"But\" (she added, her voice sud- denly mild) \"if these wise men will ac- cept our gifts, let us heap untouched and spotless at their feet all that we have and hold nothing back, so that their kinsfolk will marvel and wonder at the shining and glistering of the wealth they bring back, though it leave us nothing but our bare stone walls.\" If anyone had ever doubted that the Abbess Radegunde was inspired by God, their doubts must have vanished away, for who could resist the fiery vigor of her first speech or the benefi- cent unction of her second? The Norse- men sat there with their mouths open. I saw tears on Father Cairbre's cheeks. Then Thorvald said, \"Abbess — \" He stopped. He tried again but again stopped. Then he shook himself, as a man who has been under a spell, and said: \"Abbess, my men have been without women for a long time.\" Radegunde looked surprised. She looked as if she could not believe what she had heard. She looked the pirate up and down, as if puzzled, and then walked around him as if taking his measure. She did this several times, looking at every part of his big body as if she were summing him up while he got redder and redder. Then she back- ed off and surveyed him again, and with her arms akimbo like a peasant, announced very loudly in both Norse and German: \"Whatl Have they lost the use of their hands?\" It was irresistible, in its way. The Norse laughs. CXir people laughed. Even Thorvald laughed. I did too, though I was not sure what everyone was laughing about. The laughter would die down and then begin again behind the Abbey walls, helplessly, and again die down and again begin. The Abbess waited until the Norsemen had stopped laughing and then called for silence in German until there were only a few snickers here and there. She then said: 'These good men — Father Cair- bre, tell the people — these good men will forgive my silly joke. I meant no scandal, truly, and no harm, but laughter is good; it settles the body's waters, as the physicians say. And my people know that 1 am not always as solemn and good as I ought to be. In- deed I am a very great sinner and scan- SouU 17 dal-maker. Thorvald Einarsson, do we do business.?\" The big man — who had not been so pleased as the others, I can tell youl — looked at his men and seemed to see what he needed to know. He said, \"I go in with five men to see what you have. Then we let the poor folk on the grounds go, but not those inside the Abbey. Then we search again. The gates will be locked and guarded by the rest of us; if there's any treachery, the bargain s off.\" 'Then I will go with you,\" said Radegunde. \"That is very just and my presence will calm the people. To see us together will assure them that no harm is meant. You are a good man, Torvald — forgive me; I call you as your nephew did so often. Come, Boy News, hold on to me.\" \"Open the gates!\" she called then. \"All is safe!\" and with the five men (one of whom was that young Thor- finn who had hated her so) we waited while the great logs were pulled back. There was little space within, but the people shrank back at the sight of those fierce warriors and opened a place for us. 1 looked back and the Norsemen had come in and were standing just in- side the walls, on either side the gate, with their swords out and their shields up. The crowd parted for us more slowly as we reached the main tower, with the Abbess repeating constantly, \"Be calm, people, be calm. All is well,\" and deftly speaking by name to this one or that. It was much harder when the people gasped upon hearing the big logs pushed shut with a noise like thun- der, and it was very close on the stairs; I heard her say something like an apol- ogy in the queer foreign tongue. Some- thing that probably meant, \"I'm sorry that we must wait.\" It seemed an age until the stairs were even partly clear and I saw what the Abbess had meant by the cumbering of a crowd; a man might swing a weapon in the press of people, but not very far, and it was more likely he would dimply fall over someone and crack his head. We gain- ed the great room with the big crucifix of painted wood and the little one of pearls and gold, and the scarlet hang- ings worked in gold thread that I had played robbers behind so often before I learned what real robbers were: these tall, frightening men whose eyes glis- tened with greed at what I had fancied every village had. Most of the Sisters had stayed in the great room, but somehow it was not so crowded, as the folk had huddled back against the walls when the Norsemen came in. The youngest girls were all in a comer, ter- rified — one could smell it, as one can in i>eople — and when that young Thorfinn went for the little gold-and- pearl cross. Sister Sibihd cried in a high, cracked voice, \"It is the body of our Christ!\" and leapt up, snatching it from the wall before he could get to it. \"Sibihd!\" exclaimed the Abbess, in as sharp a voice as I had ever heard her use. \"Put that back or you will feel the 18 FanUfy & Science Fiction weight of my hand, I tell youl Now it is odd, is it not, that a young woman desperate enough not to care about death at the hands of a Norse pirate should nonetheless be frightened away at the threat of getting a few slaps from her Abbess? But folk are like that. Sister Sibihd returned the cross to its place (from whence young Thorfinn took it) and fell back among the nims, sobbing, '\"He desecrates our Lord GodI\" 'Toolish girll\" snapped the Abbess. \"God only can consecrate or desecrate; man cannot. That is a piece of metal.'' Thorvald said something sharp to Thorfiim, who slowly put the cross back on its hook with a sulky look which said, plainer than words: Nobody gives me what I want. Nothing else went wrong in the big room or the Abbess's study or the storerooms, or out in the kitchens. The Norsemen were silent and kept their hands on their swords, but the Abbess kept talking in a calm way in both tongues; to our folk she said, \"See? It is all right but everyone must keep still. God will protect us.\" Her face was steady and clear, and I believed her a saint, for she had saved Sister Sibihd and the rest of us. But this peacefulness did not last, of course. Something had to go wrong in all that press of people; to this day I do not know what. We were in a com- er of the long refectory, which is the place where the Sisters or Brothers eat in an Abbey, when something pushed me into the wall and F fell, almost suf- focated by the Abbess's lying on top of me. My head was ringing and on all sides there was a terrible roaring sound with curses and screams, a dreadful tu- mult as if the walls had come apart and were falling on everyone. I could hear the Abbess whispering something in Latin over and over in my ear. There were dull, ripe sounds, worse than the rest, which I know now to have been the noise steel makes when it is thrust into bodies. This aU seemed to go on forever and then it seemed to me that the floor was wet. Then all became quiet. I felt the Abbe^ Radegunde get off me. She said: \"So this is how you wash your floors up North.\" When I lifted my head from the rushes and saw what she meant, I was very sick into the comer. Then she picked me up in her arms and held my face against her bosom so that I would not see, but it was no use; I had already seen: all the p>eople lying sprawled on the floor with their bellies coming out, like heaps of dead fish, old Walafrid with an axe handle standing out of his chest — he was sitting up with his eyes shut in a press of bodies that gave him no room to lie down — and the young beekeeper, Uta, from the village, who had been so merry, ly- ing on her back with her long braids and her gown all dabbled in red dye and a great stain of it on her belly. She was breathing fast and her eyes were wide open. As we passed her, the noise of her breathing ceased. Souls 19 The Abbess said mildly, \"Thy peo- ple are thorough housekeepers, Earl Split-gut.\" Thorvald Einarsson roared some- thing at us, and the Abbess replied softly, \"Forgive me, good friend. You protected me and the boy and I am grateful. But nothing betrays a man's knowledge of the German like a word that bites, is it not so? And I had to be sure.\" It came to me then that she had called him 'Torvald\" and reminded him of his sister's son so that he would feel he must protect us if anything went wrong. But now she would make him angry, I thought, and I shut my eyes tight. Instead he laughed and said in odd, light German, \"I did no house- keeping but to stand over you and your pet. Are you no^ grateful?\" \"Oh, very, thank you,\" said the Abbess with such warmth as she might show to a Sister who had brought her a rose from the garden, or another who copied her work well, or when I told her news, or if Ita the cook made a good soup. But he did not know that the warmth was for everyone and so seemed satisfied. By now we were in the garden and the air was less foul; she put me down, although my limbs were shaking, and I clung to her gown, crumpled, stiff, and blood-reeking though it was. She said, \"Oh my God, what a deal of washing hast Thou given usi\" She started to walk towards the gate, and Thorvald Einarsson took a step towards her. She said, without turning round: \"Do not insist, Thor- vald, there is no reason to lock me up. I am forty years old and not likely to be running away into the swamp, what with my rheumatism and the pain in my knees and the folk needing me as they do.\" There was a moment's silence. I could see something odd come into the big man's face. He said quietly: \"I did not speak. Abbess.\" She turned, surprised. \"But you did. 1 heard you.\" He said strangely, \"I did not.\" Children can guess sometimes what is wrong and what to do about it with- out knowing how; I remember saying, very quickly, \"Oh, she does that some- times. My stepmother says old age has addled her wits,\" and then, \"Abbess, may I go to my stepmother and my father?\" \"Yes, of course,\" she said, \"run along. Boy News—\" and then stopped, looking into the air as if seeing in it something we could not. Then she said very gently, \"No, my dear, you had better stay here with me,\" and I knew, as surely as if I had seen it with my own eyes, that I was not to go to my stepmother or my father because both were dead. She did things like that, too, some- times. Kr a while it seemed that everyone was dead. I did not feel grieved or frightened in the least, but I think I 20 Fantasy & Scien \"iction must have been, for I had only one idea in my head: that if I let the Abbess out of my sight, I would die. So I followed her everywhere. She was let to move about and comfort people, especially the mad Sibihd, who would do nothing but rock and wail, but towards nightfall, when the Abbey had been stripped of its treasures, Thorvald Einarsson put her and me in her study, now bare of its grand furniture, on a straw pallet on the floor, and bolted the door on the outside. She said: \"Boy News, would you like to go to Constantinople, where the Turkish Sultan is, and the domes of gold and all the splendid pagans? For that is where this man will take me to sell me.\" \"Oh, yesl\" said I, and then: \"But will he take me, too?\" \"Of course,\" said the Abbess, and so it was settled. Then in came Thor- vald Einarsson, saying: \"Thorfinn is asking for you.\" I found out later that they were waiting for him to die; none other of the Norse had been wounded, but a farmer had crushed Thorfinn's chest with an axe, and he was expected to die before morning. The Abbess said: \"Is that a good reason to go?\" She added, \"I mean that he hates me; will not his anger at my presence make him worse?\" Thorvald said slowly, 'The folk here say you can sit by the sick and heal them. Can you do that?\" \"To my own knowledge, not at all,\" said the Abbess Radegunde, \"but if they believe so, perhaps that calms them and makes them better. Chris- tians are quite as foolish as other peo- ple, you know. I will come if you want,\" and though I saw that she was pale with tiredness, she got to her feet. I should say that she was in a plain, brown gown taken from one of the peasant women because her own was being washed clean, but to me she had the same majesty as always. And for him too, I think. Thorvald said, \"Will you pray for him or damn him?\" She said, \"I do not pray, Thorvald, and I never danm anybody; I merely sit.\" She added, \"Oh, let him; he'll scream your ears off if you don't,\" and this meant me, for I was ready to yell for my life if they tried to keep me from her. They had put Thorfinn in the chap- el, a little stone room with nothing left in it now but a plain wooden cross, not worth carrying off. He was lying, his eyes closed, on the stone altar with furs under him, and his face was gray. Every time he breathed, there was a bubbling sound, a little, thin, reedy sound; and as I crept closer, I saw why, for in the young man's chest was a great red hole with sharp pink things sticking out of it, all crushed, and in the hole one could see something jump and fall, jump and fall, over and over again. It was his heart beating. Blood kept coming from his lips in a froth. I do not know, of course, what either said, for they spoke in the Norse, but I Souls 21 saw what they did and heard much of it talked of between the Abbess and Thorvald Einarsson later. So I will tell it as if I knew. The first thing the Abbess did was to stop suddenly on the threshold and raise both hands to her mouth as if in horror. Then she cried furiously to the two guards: ''Do you wish to kill your comrade with the cold and damp? Is this how you treat one another? Get fire in here and some woollen cloth to put over him! No, not more skins, you idiots, wool to mold to his body and take up the wet. Run now!\" One said sullenly, \"We don't take orders from you. Grandma.\" \"Oh, no?\" said she. 'Then I shall strip this wool dress from my old body and put it over that boy and then sit here all night in my flabby, naked skin! What will this child's soul say when it enters the Valhall? That his friends would not give up a little of their booty so that he might fight for life? Is this your fellowship? Do it, or I will strip myself and shame you both for the rest of your lives!\" \"Well, take it from his share,\" said the one in a low voice, and the other ran out.. Soon there was a fire on the hearth and russet-colored woollen cloth — \"From my own share,\" said one of them loudly, though it was a color the least costly, not like blue or red — and the Abbess laid it loosely over the boy, carefully putting it close to his sides but not moving him. He did not look to be in any pain, but his col- or got no better. But then he opened his eyes and said in such a little voice as a ghost might have, a whisper as thin and reedy and bubbling as his breath: \"You ... old witch. But I beat you ... in the end.\" \"Did you, my dear?\" said the Ab- bess. \"How?\" 'Treasure,\" he said, \"for my kin- folk. And I lived as a man at last. Fought . . . and had a woman ... the one here with the big breasts, Sibihd.... Whether she liked it or not. That was good.\" \"Yes, Sibihd,\" said the Abbess mildly. \"Sibihd has gone mad. She hears no one and speaks to no one. She only sits and rocks and moans and soils herself and wiU not feed herself, although if one puts food in her mouth with a spoon, she will swallow.\" “ The boy tried to frown. \"Stupid,\" he said at last. \"Stupid nuns. The beasts do it.\" \"Do they?\" said the Abbess, as if this were a new idea to her. \"Now that is very odd. For never yet heard I of a gander that blacked the goose's eye or hit her over the head with a stone or stuck a knife in her entrails when he was through. When God puts it into their hearts to desire one another, she squats and he comes running. And a bitch in heat will jump through the window if you lock the door. Poor fools! Why didn't you camp three hours' down-river and wait? In a week 22 Fantasy & Science Fiction half the young married women in the village would have been slipping away at night to see what the foreigners were like. Yes, and some unmarried ones, and some of my own girls, too. But you couldn't wait, could you?\" \"No,\" said the boy, with the ghost of a brag. \"Better ... this way.\" ''This way,\" said she. \"Oh, yes, my dear, old Granny knows about this wayl Pleasure for the count of three or four, and the rest of it as much joy as rolling a stone uphill.\" He smiled a ghostly smile. \"You're a whore. Grandma.\" She began to stroke his forehead. \"No, Grandbaby,\" she said, \"but all Latin is not the Church Fathers, you know, great as they are. One can find a great deal in those strange books writ- ten by the ones who died centuries be- fore our Lord was bom. Listen,\" and she leaned closer to him and said quiet- ly: \"Syrian dancing girl, how subtly you sway those sensuous limbs, \"Half-drunk in the smoky tavern, lascivious and wanton, \"Your long hair bound back in the Greek way, clashing the casta- nets in your hands — \" The boy was too weak to do any- thing but look astonished. Then she said this: \"I love you so that anyone permit- ted to sit near you and talk to you seems to me like a god; when I am near you my spirit is broken, my heart shakes, my voice dies, and I can't even speak. Under my skin 1 flame up aU over and 1 can't see; there's thunder in my ears and 1 break out in a sweat,, as if from fever; I turn paler than cut grass and feel that I am utterly changed; 1 feel that Death has come near me.\" He said, as if frightened, \"Nobody feels like that.\" \"They do,\" she said. He said, in feeble alarm, \"You're trying to kill mel\" She said, \"No, my dear. 1 simply don't want you to die a virgin.\" It was odd, his saying those things and yet holding on to her hand where he had got at it through the woollen cloth; she stroked his head and he whispered, \"Save me, old witch.\" \"I'll do my best,\" she said. \"You shall do your best by not talking and 1 by not tormenting you any more, and we'U both try to sleep.\" \"Pray,\" said the boy. \"Very well,\" said she, \"but I'll need a chair,\" and the guards — seeing I suppose, that he was holding her hand — brought in one of the great wooden chairs from the Abbey, which were too plain and heavy to carry off, I think. Then the Abbess Radegunde sat in the chair and closed her eyes. Thorfinn seemed to fall asleep. I crept nearer her on the floor and must have fallen asleep myself almost at once, for the next thing I knew a gray light filled the chapel, the fire had gone out, and Souls 23 someone was shaking Radegunde, who still slept in her chair, her head leaning to one side. It was Thorvald Einarsson and he was shouting with excitement in his strange German, ''Woman, how did you do iti How did you do itl\" \"Do what?\" said the Abbess thick- ly. \"Is he dead?\" \"Dead?\" exlaimed the Norseman. \"He is healedi HealedI The lung is whole and aU is closed up about the heart and the shattered pieces of the ribs are grown together I Even the muscles of the chest are beginning to heall\" \"That's good,\" said the Abbess, still half asleep. \"Let me be.\" Thorvald shook her again. She said again, \"Oh, let me sleep.\" This time he hauled her to her feet and she shrieked, \"My back, my back I Oh, the saints, my rheumatism 1\" and at the same time a sick voice from under the blue wool- lens — a sick voice but a man's voice, not a ghost's — said something in Norse. \"Yes, I hear you,\" said the Abbess. \"You must become a follower of the White Christ right away, this very minute. But Dominus noster, please do You put it into these brawny heads that 1 must have a tub of hot water with pennyroyal in it? I am too old to sleep all night in a chair, and I am one ache from head to foot.\" Thorfinn got louder. \"Tell him,\" said the Abbess Rade- gunde to Thorvald in German, \"that I will not baptize him and I will not shrive him until he is a different man. All that child wants is someone more powerful than your Odin god or your Thor god to puU him out of the next scrape he gets into. Ask him: Will he adopt Sibihd as his sister? Will he clean her when she soils herself and feed her and sit with his arm about her, talking to her gently and lovingly until she is well again? The Christ does not wipe out our sins only to have us commit them all over again, and that is what he wants and what you all want, a God that gives and gives and gives, but God does not give; He takes and takes and takes. He takes away everything that is not God until there is nothing left but God, and none of you will understand thatl There is no remission of sins; there is only change, and Thorfinn must change before God will have him.\" \"Abbess, you are eloquent,\" said Thorvald, smiling, \"but why do you not tell him all this yourself?\" \"Because I ache sol\" said Rade- gunde; \"Oh, do get me into some hot water I\" and Thorvald half led and half supported her as she hobbled out. That morning, after she had had her soak — when I cried, they let me stay just out- side the door — she undertook to cure Sibihd, first by rocking her in her arms and talking to her, telling her she was safe now, and promising that the Northmen would go soon, and then when Sibihd became quieter, leading her out into the woods with Thorvald as a bodyguard to see that we did not 24 Fantasy & Science Fiction run away, and little, dark Sister Hed- wic, who had stayed with Sibihd and cared for her. The Abbess would walk for a while in the mild autumn sun- shine, and then she would direct Sibihd's face upwards by touching her gently under the chin and say, ''See? There is God's sky still,\" and then, 'Took, there are God's trees; they have not changed,\" and tell her that the world was just the same and God still kindly to folk, only a few more souls had joined the Blessed and were happi- er waiting for us in Heaven than we could ever be, or even imagine being, on the poor earth. Sister Hedwic kept hold of Sibihd's hand. No one paid more attention to me than if I had been a dog, but every time poor Sister Sibihd saw Thorvald she would shrink away, and you could see that Hedwic could not bear to look at him at all; every time he came in her sight she turned her face aside, shut her eyes hard, and bit her lower lip. It was a quiet, almost warm day, as autumn can be sometimes, and the Abbess found a few little blue late flowers growing in a sheltered place against a log and put them into Sibihd's hand, speaking of how beautifully and cun- ningly God had made all things. Sister Sibihd had enough wit to hold on to the flowers, but her eyes stared and she would have stumbled and fallen if Hedwic had not led her. Sister Hedwic said timidly, \"Per- haps she suffers because she has been defiled. Abbess,\" and then looked ashamed. For a moment the Abbess looked shrewdly at young Sister Hed- wic and then at the mad Sibihd. Then she said: \"Dear daughter Sibihd and dear daughter Hedwic, I am now going to tell you something about myself that I have never told to a single living soul but my confessor. Do you know that as a young woman I studied at Avig- non and from there was sent to Rome, so that 1 might gather much learning? Well, in Avignon I read mightily our Christian Fathers but also in the pagan poets, for as it has been said by Ermenrich of Ellwangen: As dung spread upon a field enriches it to good harvest, thus one cannot produce divine eloquence without the filthy writings of the pagan poets. This is true but perilous, only I thought not so, for I was very proud and fancied that if the pagan poems of love left me unmoved, that was because I had the gift of chastity right from God Him- self, and 1 scorned sensual pleasures and those tempted by them. I had for- gotten, you see, that chastity is not given once and for all like a wedding ring that is put on never to be taken off, but is a garden which each day must be weeded, watered, and trim- med anew, or soon there will be only brambles and wilderness. \"As I have said, the words of the poets did not tempt me, for words are only marks on the page with no life save what we give them. But in Rome there were not only the old books. Souls 25 daughters, but something much worse. 'There were statues. Now you must understand that these are not such as you can imagine from our books, like Saint John or the Virgin; the ancients wrought so cunningly in stone that it is like magic; one stands before the marble holding one's breath, waiting for it to move and speak. They are not statues at all but beautiful, nak- ed men and women. It is a city of sea- gods pouring water, daughter Sibihd and daughter Hedwic, of athletes about to throw the discus, and runners and wrestlers and young emperors, and the favorites of kings; but they do not walk the streets like real men, for they are all of stone. 'There was one Apollo, all naked, which I knew I should not look on but which 1 always made some excuse to my companions to pass by, and this statue, although three miles distant from my dwelling, drew me as if by magic. Oh, he was fair to look on! Fairer than any youth alive now in Germany, or in the world, I think. And then all the old loves of the pagan poets came back to me: Dido and Aeneas, the taking of Venus and Mars, the love of the moon, Diana, for the shepherd boy — and I thought that if my statue could only come to life, he would utter honeyed love-words from the old poets and would be wise and brave, too, and what woman could resist him?\" Here she stopped and looked at Sis- ter Sibihd but Sibihd only stared on. holding the litde blue flowers. It was Sister Hedwic who cried, one hand pressed to her heart: 'Did you pray. Abbess?\" \"I did,\" said Radegunde solemnly, \"and yet my prayers kept becoming something else. I would pray to be de- livered from the temptation that was in •the statue, and then, of course, I would have to think of the statue itself, and then I would tell myself that I must run, like the nymph Daphne, to be ar- mored and sheltered within a laurel tree, but my feet seemed to be already rooted to the ground, and then at the last minute I would flee and be back at my prayers again. But it grew harder each time, and at last the day came when I did not flee.\" \"Abbess, you?\" cried Hedwic, with a gasp. Thorvald, keeping his watch a little way from us, looked surprised. I was very pleased — I loved to see the Abbess , astonish people; it was one of her gifts — and at seven I had no knowledge of lust except that my little thing felt good sometimes when I han- dled it to make water, and what had that to do with statues coming to life or women turning into laurel trees? I was more interested in mad Sibihd, the way children are; I did not know what she might do, or if I should be afraid of her, or if I should go mad myself, what it would be like. But the Abbess was laughing gently at Hedwic's amaze- ment. \"Why not me?\" said the Abbess. \"I was young and healthy and had no 26 Fantasy 4 Sdcncc Fiction special grace from God any more than the hens or the cows do! Indeed, I burned so with desire for that hand- some young hero — for so I had made him in my mind, as a woman might do with a man she has seen a few times on the street — that thoughts of him tor- mented me waking and sleeping. It seemed to me that because of my vows I could not give myself to this Apollo of my own free will. So I would dream that he took me against my will, and, oh, what an exquisite pleasure that was!'' Here Hedwic's blood came all to her face and she covered it with her hands. 1 could see Thorvald grinning, back where he watched us. \"And then,\" said the Abbess, as if she had not seen either of them, \"a ter- rible fear came to my heart that God might punish me by sending a ravisher who would use me unlawfully, as I had dreamed my Apollo did, and that 1 would not even wish to resist him and would feel the pleasures of a base lust and would know myself a whore and a false nun forever after. This fear both tormented and drew me. I began to steal looks at young men in the streets, not letting the other Sisters see me do it, thinking: WiU it be he? Or he? Or he? \"And then it happened. I had lin- gered behind the others at a melon sell- er's, thinking of no Apollos or hand- some heroes but only of the convent's dinner, when 1 saw my companions disappearing round a comer. I hasten- ed to catch up with them — and made a wrong turning — and was suddenly lost in a narrow street — and at that very moment a young fellow took hold of my habit and threw me to the ground! You may wonder why he should do such a mad thing, but as 1 found out afterwards, there are prosti- tutes in Rome who affect our way of dress to please the appetites of certain men who are depraved enough to — well, really, I do not know how to say it! Seeing me alone, he had thought 1 was one of them and would be glad of a customer and a bit of play. So there was a reason for it. \"Well, there I was on my back with this young fellow, sent as a vengeance by God, as I thought, trying to do ex- actly what 1 had dreamed, night after night, that my statue should do. And do you know, it was nothing in the least like my dream! The stones at my back hurt me, for one thing. And in- stead of melting with delight, 1 was screaming my head off in terror and kicking at him as he tried to pull up my skirts, and praying to God that this in- sane man might not break any of my bones in his rage! \"My screams brought a crowd of people and he went running. So 1 got off with nothing worse than a bruised back and a sprained knee. But the strangest thing of all was that while I was cured forever of lusting after my Apollo, instead I began to be torment- ed by a new fear — that I had lusted after him, that foolish young man with Souls 27 the foul breath and the one tooth miss- ingl — and I felt strange creepings and crawlings over my body that were half like desire and half like fear and half like disgust and shame with all sorts of other things mixed in — I know that is too many halves but it is how I felt — and nothing at all like the burning de- sire I had felt for my Apollo. I went to see the statue once more before I left Rome, and it seemed to look at me sad- ly, as if to say: Don't blame me, poor girl; I'm only a piece of stone. And that was the last time I was so proud as to believe that God had singled me out for a special gift, like chastity — or a special sin, either — or that being thrown down on the ground and hurt had anything to do with any sin of mine, no matter how I mixed the two together in my mind. I dare say you did not find it a great pleasure yester- day, did you?\" Hedwic shook her head. She was crying quietly. She said, 'Thank you. Abbess,\" and the Abbess embraced her. They both seemed happier, but then all of a sudden Sibihd muttered something, so low that one could not hear her. \"The — \" she whispered and then she brought it out but still in a whisper: 'The blood.\" \"What, dear, your blood?\" said Radegunde. \"No, mother,\" said Sibihd, begin- ning to tremble, 'The blood. All over us. Walafrid and — and Uta — and Sister Hildegarde — and everyone broken and spilled out like a dish I And none of us had done anything but I could smell it all over me and the chil- dren screaming because they were be- ing trampled down, and those demons come up from Hell though we had done nothing and — and — I under- stand, mother, about the rest, but I will never, ever forget it, oh Christus, it is all around me now, oh, mother, the bloody Then Sister Sibihd dropped to her knees on the faUen leaves and began to scream, not covering her face as Sister Hedwic had done, but staring ahead with her wide eyes as if she were blind or could see something we could not. The Abbess knelt down and embraced her, rocking her back and forth, say- ing, \"Yes, yes, dear, but we are here; we are here now; that is gone now,\" but Sibihd continued to scream, cover- ing her ears as if the scream were some- one else's and she could hide herself from it. Thorvald said, looking, 1 thought, a little uncomfortable, \"Cannot your Christ cure this?\" \"No,\" said the Abbess. \"Only by undoing the past. And that is the one thing He never does, it seems. She is in Hell now and must go back there many times before she can forget.\" \"She would make a bad slave,\" said the Norseman, with a glance at Sister Sibihd, who had fallen silent and was staring ahead of her again. \"You need not fear that anyone wiU want her.\" \"God,\" said the Abbess Radegunde 28 Fantasy & Science Fiction calmly, \"is merciful.\" Thorvald Einarsson said, \"Abbess, 1 am not a bad man.\" \"For a good man,\" said the Abbess Radegunde, \"you keep surprisingly bad company.\" He said angrily, \"1 did not choose my shipmates. I have had bad luck!\" \"Ours has,\" said the Abbess, \"been worse, I think.\" \"Luck is luck,\" said Thorvald, clenching his fists. \"It comes to some folk and not to others.\" \"As you came to us,\" said the Ab- bess mildly. \"Yes, yes, I see, Thorvald Einarsson; one may say that luck is Thor s doing or Odin's doing, but you must know that our bad luck is your own doing and not some god's. You are our bad luck, Thorvald Einarsson. It's true that you're not as wicked as your friends, for they kill for pleasure and you do it without feeling, as a business, the way one hews down grain. Perhaps you have seen today some of the grain you have cut. If you had a man's soul, you would not have gone viking, luck or no luck, and if your soul were bigger still, you would have tried to stop your shipmates, just as I talk honestly to you now, despite your anger, and just as Christus him- self told the truth and was nailed on the cross. If you were a beast you could not break God's law, and if you were a man you would not, but you are neither, and that makes you a kind of monster that spoils everything it touches and never knows the reason. Souls and that is why I will never forgive you until you become a man, a true man with a true soul. As for your friends—\" Here Thorvald Einarsson struck the Abbess on the face with his open hand and knocked her down. I heard Sister Hedwic gasp in horror and behind us Sister Sibihd began to moan. But the Abbess only sat there, rubbing her jaw and smiling a little. Then she said: \"Oh, dear, have 1 been at it again? I am ashamed of myself. You are quite right to be angry, Torvald; no one can stand me when I go on in that way, least of all myself; it is such a bore. Still, I cannot seem to stop it; I am too used to being the Abbess Radegunde, that is clear. I promise never to tor- ment you again, but you, Thorvald, must never strike me again, because you will be very sorry if you do.\" He took a step forward. \"No, no, my dear man,\" the Ab- bess said merrily, \"1 mean no threat — how could I threaten you? — I mean only that I will never tell you any jokes, my spirits will droop, and I will become as dull as any other woman. Confess it now: I am the most interest- ing thing that has happened to you in years and I have entertained you bet- ter, sharp tongue and all, than aU the skalds at the Court of Norway. And I know more tales and stories than they do — more than anyone in the whole world — for I make new ones when the old ones wear out. \"Shall 1 tell you a story now?\" \"About your Christ?\" said he, the 29 anger still in his face. \"No/' said she, \"about living men and women. Tell me, Torvald what do you men want from us women?\" 'To be talked to death,\" said he, and I could see there was some anger in him still, but he was turning it to play also. The Abbess laughed in delight. \"Very witty 1\" she said, springing to her feet and brushing the leaves off her skirt. \"You are a very clever man, Tor- vald. I beg your pardon, Thorvald. 1 keep forgetting. But as to what men want from women, if you asked the young men, they would only wink and dig one another in the ribs, but that is only how they deceive themselves. That is only body calling to body. They want something quite different and they want it so much that it frightens them. So they pretend it is anything and everything else: pleasure, comfort, a servant in the home. Do you know what it is that they want?\" \"What?\" said Thorvald. \"The mother,\" said Radegunde, \"as women do, too; we all want the mother. When 1 walked before you on the riverbank yesterday, 1 was playing the mother. Now you did nothing, for you are no young fool, but 1 knew that sooner or later one of you, so torment- ed by his longing that he would hate me for it, would reveal himself. And so he did: Thorfinn, with his thoughts all mixed up between witches and grannies and what not. 1 knew 1 could frighten him, and through him, most of you. That was the beginning of my bargain- ing. You Norse have too much of the father in your country and not enough mother; that is why you die so well and kill other folk so well — and live so very, very badly.\" \"You are doing it again,\" said Thorvald, but 1 think he wanted to lis- ten all the same. \"Your pardon, friend,\" said the Ab- bess. \"You are brave men; I don't deny it. But I know your sagas and they are all about fighting and dying and after- wards not Heavenly happiness but the end of the world: everything, even the gods, eaten by the Fenris Wolf and the Midgaard snakel What a pity, to die bravely only because life is not worth livingl The Irish know better. The pagan Irish were heroes, with their Queens leading them to battle as often as not, and Father Cairbre, God rest his soul, was complaining only two days ago that the common Irish folk were blasphemously making a goddess out of God's mother, for do they build shrines to Christ or Our Lord or pray to them? Nol It is Our Lady of the Rocks and Our Lady of the Sea and Our Lady of the Grove and Our Lady of this or that from one end of the land to the other. And even here it is only the Abbey folk who speak of God the Father and of Christ. In the village if one is sick or another in trouble it is: Holy Mother, save me I and: Miriam Virginem, intercede for me, and: Bless- ed Virgin, blind my husband's eyesl and: Our Lady, preserve my crops. 30 Fantaty & Science Fiction and so on, men and women both. We all need the mother.'' \"You, too?\" \"More than most,\" said the Abbess. \"And 17\" \"Oh, no,\" said the Abbess, sto|>- ping suddenly, for we had all been walking back towards the village as she spoke. \"No, and that is what drew me to you at once. I saw it in you and knew you were the leader. It is follow- ers who make leaders, you know, and your shipmates have made you leader, whether you know it or not. What you want is — how shall I say it? You are a clever man, Thorvald, perhaps the cleverest man I have ever met, more even than the scholars I knew in my youth. But your cleverness has had no food. It is a cleverness of the world and not of books. You want to travel and know about folk and their customs, and what strange places are like, and what has happened to men and women in the past. If you take me to Constan- tinople, it will not be to get a price for me but merely to go there; you went seafaring because this longing itched at you until you could bear it not a year more; I know that.\" \"Then you are a witch,\" said he, and he was not smiling. \"No, I only saw what was in your face when you spoke of that city,\" said she. \"Also there is gossip that you sj)ent much time in Goteborg as a young man, idling and marveling at the ships and markets when you should have been at your farm.\" She said, \"Thorvald, I can feed that cleverness. I am the wisest woman in the world. I know everything — every- thing! I know more than my teachers; 1 make it up or it comes to me, I don't know how, but it is real — real! — and I know more than anyone. Take me from here, as your slave it you wish but as your friend also, and let us go to Constantinople and see the domes of gold, and the walls all inlaid with gold, and the people so wealthy you cannot imagine it, and the whole city so gilded it seems to be on fire, pictures as high as a wall, set right in the wall and all made of jewels so there is nothing else like them, redder than the reddest rose, greener than the grass, and with a blue that makes the sky pale!\" \"You are indeed a witch,\" said he, \"and not the Abbess Radegunde.\" She said slowly, \"I think I am for- getting how to be the Abbess Rade- gunde.\" 'Then you will not care about them any more,\" said he, and pointed to Sis- ter Hedwic, who was still leading the stumbling Sister Sibihd. The Abbess's face was still and mild. She said, \"I care. Do not strike me, Thorvald, not ever again, and I will be a good friend to you. Try to control the worst of your men and leave as many of my people free as you can — I know them and will tell you which can be taken away with the least hurt to themselves or others — and I will feed that curiosity and cleverness of yours until you will not recognize Souls 31 this old world any more for the sheer wonder and awe of it; I swear this on my life.\" \"Done/' said he, adding, \"but with my luck, your life is somewhere else, locked in a box on top of a mountain, like the troll's in the story, or you will die of old age while we are still at sea.\" \"Nonsense,\" she said, \"I am a healthy, mortal woman with all my teeth, and I mean to gather many wrin- kles yet.\" He put his hand out and she took it; then he said, shaking his head in wonder, \"If I sold you in Constantino- ple, within a year you would become Queen of the place!\" The Abbess laughed merrily and I cried in fear, \"Me, tool Take me too!\" and she said \"Oh, yes, we must not forget little Boy News,\" and lifted me into her arms. The frightening, tall man, with his face close to mine, said in his strange, sing-song German: \"Boy, would you like to see the whales leaping in the open sea and the seals barking on the rocks? And cliffs so high that a giant could stretch his arms up and not reach their tops? And the sun shining at midnight?\" \"Yes!\" said I. \"But you will be a slave,\" he said, \"and may be ill-treated and will always have to do as you are bid. Would you like that?\" \"No!\" 1 cried lustily, from the safe- ty of the Abbess's arms, \"I'll fight!\" He laughed a mighty, roaring laugh and tousled my head — rather too hard, 1 thought — and said, \"I will not be a bad master, for I am named for Thor Red-beard and he is strong and quick to fight but good-natured, too, and so am I,\" and the Abbess put me down, and so we walked back to the village, Thorvald and the Abbess Radegimde talking of the glories of this world and Sister Hedwic saying softly, \"She is a saint, our Abbess, a saint, to sacrifice herself for the good of the people,\" and all the time behind us, like a memory, came the low, widess sobbing of Sister Sibihd, who was in Hell. \\AL we got back we found that Thorfinn was better and the Norsemen were to leave in the morning. Thorvald had a second pallet brought into the Abbess's study and slept on the floor with us that night. You might think his men would laugh at this, for the Ab- bess was an old woman, but 1 think he had been with one of the young ones before he came to us. He had that look about him. There was no bedding for the Abbess but an old brown cloak with holes in it, and she and I were wrapped in it when he came in and threw himself down, whistling, on the other pallet. Then he said: \"Tomorrow, before we sail, you will show me the old Abbess's treasure.\" \"No,\" said she. \"That agreement was broken.\" 32 Fantasy St Science Fiction He had been playing with his knife and now ran his thumb along the edge of it. '\"I can make you do it.'\" \"No/' said she patiently, \"and now I am going to sleep.\" \"So you make light of death?\" he said. \"Good! That is what a brave woman should do, as the skalds sing, and not move, even when the keen sword cuts off her eyelashes. But what if I put this knife here not to your throat but to your little boy's? You would tell me then quick enough!\" The Abbess turned away from him, yawning and saying, \"No, Thorvald, because you would not. And if you did, I would despise you for a coward- ly oath-breaker and not tell you for that reason. Good night.\" He laughed and whistled again for a bit. Then he said: \"Was all that true?\" \"All what?\" said the Abbess., \"Oh, about the statue. Yes, but there was no ravisher. I put him in the tale for poor Sister Hedwic.\" Thorvald snorted, as if in disap- pointment. 'Tale? You tell lies. Ab- bess!\" The Abbess drew the old brown cloak over her head and closed her eyes. \"It helped her.\" Then there was a silence, but the big Norseman did not seem able to lie still. He shifted his body again as if the straw bothered him, and again turned over. He finally burst out, \"But what happened!\" She sat up. Then she shut her eyes. She said, \"Maybe it does not come into your man's thoughts that an old wom- an gets tired and that the work of deal- ing with folk is hard work, or even that it is work at all. Well! \"Nothing 'happened,' Thorvald. Must something happen only if this one fucks that one or one bangs in another's head? I desired my statue to the point of such foolishness that I de- termined to find a real, human lover, but when I raised my eyes from my fancies to the real, human men of Rome and unstopped my ears to listen to their talk, I realized that the thing was completely and eternally impossi- ble. Oh, those younger sons with their skulking, jealous hatred of the rich, and the rich ones with their noses in the air because they thought themselves of such great consequence because of their silly money, and the timidity of the priests to their superi- ors, and their superiors' pride, and the artisans' hatred of the peasants, and the peasants being worked like animals from morning until night, and half the men I saw beating their wives and the other half out to cheat some poor girl of her money or her virginity or both — this was enough to put out any fire! And the women doing less harm only because they had less power to do harm, or so it seemed to me then. So I put all away, as one does with any dis- appointment. Men are not such bad folk when one stops expecting them to be gods, but they are not for me. If that state is chastity, then a weak Souls 33 stomach is temperance, I think. But whatever it is, I have it, and that's the end of the matter.\" '\"All men?\" said Thorvald Einars- son with his head to one side, and it came to me that he had been drinking, though he seemed sober. 'Thorvidd,\" said the Abbess, \"what you want with this middle-aged wreck of a body I cannot imagine, but if you lust after my wrinkles and flab- by breasts and lean, withered flanks, do whatever you want quickly and then, for Heaven's sake, let me sleep. I am tired to death.\" He said in a low voice, \"1 need to have power over you.\" She spread her hands in a helpless gesture. \"Oh, Thorvald, Thorvald, I am a weak little woman over forty years oldl Where is the power? AU I can do is talkl\" He said, 'That's it. That's how you do it. You talk and talk and talk and everyone does just as you please; I have seen itl\" The Abbess said, looking sharply at him, \"Very well. If you must. But if I were you, Norseman, I would as soon bed my own mother. Remember that as you pull my skirts up.\" That stopped him . He swore under his breath, turning over on his side, away from us. Then he thrust his knife into the edge of his pallet, time after time. Then he put the knife under the rolled-up cloth he was using as a pil- low. We had no pillow and so I tried to make mine out of the edge of the cloak 34 and failed. Then I thought that the Norseman was afraid of God working in Radegunde, and then I thought of Sister Hedwic's changing color and wondered why. And then I thought of the leaping whales and the seals, which must be like great dogs because of the barking, and then the seals jumped on land and ran to my pallet and lapped at me with great, icy tongues of water so that 1 shivered and jumped, and then 1 woke up. The Abbess Radegunde had left the pallet — it was her warmth 1 had miss- ed — and was walking about the room. She would step and pause, her skirts making a small noise as she did so. She was careful not to touch the sleeping Thorvald. There was a dim light in the room from the embers that still glowed under the ashes in the hearth, but no light came from be- tween the shutters of the study win- dow, now shut against the cold. 1 saw the Abbess kneel under the plain wooden cross which hung on the study wall and heard her say a few words in Latin; I thought she was praying. But then she said in a low voice: \"'Do not call upon Apollo and the Muses, for they are deaf things and vain.' But so m you. Pierced Man, deaf and vain.\" Then she got up and began to pace again. Thinking of it now frightens me, for it was the middle of the night and no one to hear her — except me, but she thought I was asleep — and yet she went on and on in that low, even voice Fantasy & Science Fiction as if it were broad day and she were ex- plaining something to someone, as if things that had been in her thoughts for years must finaUy come out. But I did not find anything alarming in it then, for I thought that perhaps all Ab- besses had to do such things, and be- sides she did not seem angry or hurried or afraid; she sounded as calm as if she were discussing the profits from the Abbey's bee-keeping — which I had heard her do — or the accounts for the wine cellars — which 1 had also heard — and there was nothing alanning in that. So I listened as she continued walking about the room in the dark. She said: 'Talk, talk, talk, and always to myself. But one can't abandon the kit- tens and puppies; that would be cruel. And being the Abbess Radegunde at least gives one something to do. But I am so sick of the good Abbess Rade- gunde; I have put on Radegunde every morning of my life as easily as 1 put on my smock, and then I have had to hear the stupid creature praised all day! — sainted Radegunde, just Radegunde who is never angry or greedy or jea- lous, kindly Radegunde who sacrifices herself for others, and always the talk, talk, talk, bubbling and boiling in my head with no one to hear or under- stand, and no one to answer. No, not even in the south, only a line here or a line there, and all written by the dead. Did they feel as I do? That the world is a giant nursery full of squabbles over toys and the babes thinking me some kind of goddess because I'm not greedy for their dolls or bits of straw or their horses made of tied-together sticks? \"Poor people, if only they knew! It's so easy to be temperate when one enjoys nothing, so easy to be kind when one loves nothing, so easy to be fearless when one's life is no better than one's death. And so easy to scheme when the success doesn't mat- ter. \"Would they be surprised, I wonder, to find out what my real thoughts were when Thorfinn's knife was at my throat? Curiosity! But he would not do it, of course; he does ev- erything for show. And they would think I was twice holy, not to care about death. \"Then why not kill yourself, impi- ous Sister Radegunde? Is it your reli- gion which stops you? Oh, you mean the holy wells, and the holy trees, and the blessed saints with their blessed relics, and the stupidity that shamed Sister Hedwic, and the promises of safety that drove poor Sibihd mad when the blessed body of her Lord did not protect her and the blessed love of the blessed Mary turned away the sharp point of not one knife? Trash! Idle leaves and sticks, reeds and rushes, filth we sweep off our floors when it grows too thick. As if holiness had anything to do with all of that. As if every place were not as holy as every other and every thing as holy as every other, from the shit in Thorfinn's bowels to the rocks on the groimd. As Souk 35 if all places and things were not clouds placed in front of our weak eyes, to keep us from being blinded by that glory, that eternal shining, that blazing all about us, the torrent of light that is everything and is in everything! That is what keep>s me from the river, but it never sp>eaks to me or tells me what to do, and to it good and evil are the same — no, it is something else than good or evil; it is, only — so it is not God, That 1 know. ''So, people, is your Radegunde a witch or a demon? Is she full of pride or is Radegimde abject? Perhaps she is a witch. Once, long ago, I confessed to old Gerbertus that I could see things that were far away merely by closing my eyes, and 1 proved it to him, too, and he wept over me and gave me much penance, crying, \"If it come of it- self it may be a gift of God, daughter, but it is more likely the work of a demon, so do not do it!\" And then we prayed and 1 told him the power had left me, to make the poor old puppy less troubled in its mind, but that was not true, of course. 1 could still see Turkey as easily as 1 could see him, and places far beyond: the squat, wild men of the plains on their ponies, and the strange, tall people beyond that with their great cities and odd eyes, as if one pulled one's eyelid up on a slant, and then the seas with the great, wild lands and the cities more full of gold than Constantinople, and water again until one comes back home, for the world's a ball, as the ancients said. \"But I did stop somehow, over the years. Radegunde never had time, I suppose. Besides, when 1 opened that door it was only pictures, as in a book, and all to no purpose, and after a while 1 had seen them all and no longer cared for them. It is the other door that draws me, when it opens itself but a crack and strange things peep through, like Ranulf sister's son and the name of his horse. That door is good but very heavy; it always swings back after a little. I shall have to be on my death- bed to open it all the way, I think. \"The fox is asleep. He is the clever- est yet; there is something in him so that at times one can almost talk to him. But still a fox, for the most part. Perhaps in time.... \"But let me see; yes, he is asleep. And the Sibihd puppy is asleep, though it will be having a bad dream soon, 1 think, and the Thorfinn kitten is asleep, as full of fright as when it wakes, with its claws going in and out, in and out, lest something strangle it in its sleep.\" Then the Abbess fell silent and moved to the shuttered window as if she were looking out, so I thought that she was indeed looking out — but not with her eyes — at all the sleeping folk, and thisVas something she had done every night of her life to see if they were safe and sound. But would she not know that / was awake? Should 1 not try very hard to get to sleep before she caught me? Then it seemed to me that she smiled in the dark, although I 34 Fantafy & Science Fiction could not see it. She said in that same low, even voice: \"'Sleep or wake. Boy News; it is all one to me. Thou hast heard nothing of any importance, only the silly Abbess talking to herself, only Radegunde saying good-bye to Rade- gunde, only Radegunde going away — don't cry. Boy News; I am still here — but there: Radegimde has gone. This Norseman and I are alike in one way: our minds are like great houses with many of the rooms locked shut. We crowd in a miserable, huddled few, like poor folk, when we might move freely among them all, as gracious as princes.- It is fate that locked away so much of the Norseman — see. Boy News, I do not say his name, not even softly, for that wakes folks — but I wonder if the one who bolted me in was not Radegunde herself, she and old Gerbertus — whom I partly believ- ed — they and the years and years of having to be Radegunde and do the things Radegunde did and pretend to have the thoughts Radegunde had and the endless, endless lies Radegunde must teU everyone, and Radegunde's utter and unbearable loneliness.\" She fell silent again. I wondered at the Abbess's talk this time: saying she was not there when she was, and about living locked up in small rooms — for surely the Abbey was the most splen- did house in all the world, and the big- gest — and how could she be lonely when all the folk loved her? But then she said in a voice so low that I could hardly hear it: \"Poor Radegunde 1 So weary of the lies she tells and the fooling of men and women with the collars round their necks and bribes of food for good be- havior and a careful twitch of the leash that they do not even see or feel. And with the Norseman it will be all the same: lies and flattery and all of it work that never ends and no one ever even sees, so that finally Radegunde will lie down like an ape in a cage, weak and sick from hunger, and wiU never get up. \"Let her die now. There: Rade- gunde is dead. Radegunde is gone. Per- haps the door was heavy only because she was on the other side of it, pushing against me. Perhaps it will open all the way now. I have looked in all direc- tions: to the east, to the north and south, and to the west, but there is one place I have never looked and now I will: away from the ball, straight out. Let us see—\" She stopped si>eaking all of a sud- den. 1 had been falling asleep but this silence woke me. Then I heard the Ab- bess gasp terribly, like one mortally stricken, and then she said in a whisper so keen and thrilling that it made the hair stand up on my head: Where art thou? The next moment she had tom the shutters open and was crying out with all her voice: Help me! Find me! Oh, come, come, come, or I die! This waked Thorvald. With some Norse oath he stumbled up and flung on his sword belt and then put his hand to his dagger; 1 had noticed this thing Souls 37 with the dagger was a thing Norsemen liked to do. The Abbess was silent. He let out his breath in an oofl and went to light the tallow dip at the live em- bers under the hearth ashes; when the dip had smoked up, he put it on its shelf on the wall. He said in German, '^What the devil, woman I What has happened?'' She turned round. She looked as if she could not see us, as if she had been dazed by a joy too big to hold, like one who has looked into the sun and is still dazzled by it so that everything seems changed, and the world seems all God's and everything in it like Heaven. She said softly, with her arms around herself, hugging herself: \"My people. The real people.\" \"What are you talking off\" said he. She seemed to see him then, but on- ly as Sibihd had beheld us; I do not mean in horror as Sibihd had, but be- holding through something else, like someone who comes from a vision of bliss which still lingers about her. She said in the same soft voice, \"They are coming for me, Thorvald. Is it not wonderful? I knew all this 'year that something would happen, but I did not know it would be the one thing I wanted in all the world.\" He grasped his hair. \"Wfio is com- ing?\" \"My people,\" she said, laughing softly. \"Do you not feel them? I do. We must wait three days for they come from very far away. But then — oh, you wiU seel\" He said, \"You've been dreaming. We sail tomorrow.\" \"Oh, no,\" said the Abbess simply, \"you cannot do that for it would not be right. They told me to wait; they said if I went away, they might not find me.\" He said slowly, \"You've gone mad. Or it's a trick.\" \"Oh, no, Thorvald,\" said she. \"How could I trick you? I am your friend. And you will wait these three days, will you not, because you are my friend also.\" \"You're mad,\" he said, and started for the door of the study, but she step- ped in front of him and threw herself on her knees. All her cunning seemed to have deserted her, or perhaps it was Radegunde who had been the cunning one. This one was like a child. She clasped her hands and tears came out of her eyes; she begged him, saying: \"Such a little thing, Thorvald, only three daysl And if they do not come, why then we will go anywhere you like, but if they do come you will not regret it, I promise you; they are not like the folk here and that place is like nothing here. It is what the soul craves, Thorvald 1\" He said, \"Get up, woman for God's sakel\" She said, smiling in a sly, fright- ened way through her blubbered face, \"If you let me stay, I will show you the old Abbess's buried threasure, Thor- vald.\" He stepp>ed back, the anger clear in 38 Fantasy 8r Science Fiction him. '\"So this is the brave old witch who cares nothing for death!'' he said. Then he made for the door, but she was up again, as quick as a snake, and had flung herself across it. She said, still with that strange in- nocence, \"Do not strike me. Do not push me. I am your friend!\" He said, \"You mean that you lead me by a string around the neck, like a goose. Well, I am tired of that!\" \"But I cannot do that any more,\" said the Abbess breathlessly, \"not since the door opened. I am not able now.\" He raised his arm to strike her and she cowered, wailing, \"Do not strike me! Do not push me! Do not, Thorvald!\" He said, \"CXit of my way then, old witch!\" She began to cry in sobs and gulps. She said, \"One is here but another will come! One is buried brt another will rise! She will come, ihorvald!\" and then in a low, quick voice, \"Do not push open this last door. There is one behind it who is evil and I am afraid—\" but one could see that he was angry and disappointed and would not listen. He struck her for the second time and again she fell, but with a desperate cry, covering her face with her hands. He unbolted the door and stepped over her and I heard his footsteps go down the corridor. I could see the Abbess clearly — at that time I did not wonder how this could be, with the shadows from the tallow dip half hiding every- thing in their drunken dance — but I saw every line in her face as if it had beeh full day, and in that light I saw Radegunde go away from us at last. Have you ever been at some great king's court or some earl's and heard the storytellers? There are those so skilled in the art that they not only speak for you what the person in the tale said and did, but they also make an action with their faces and bodies as if they truly were that man or woman, so that it is a great surprise to you when the tale ceases, for you almost believe that you have seen the tale hap- pen in front of your very eyes, and it is as if a real man or woman had sudden- ly ceased to exist, for you forget that all this was only a teller and a tale. So it was with the woman who had been Radegunde. She did not change; it was still Radegunde's gray hairs and wrinkled face and old body in the pea- sant woman's brown dress, and yet at the same time it was a stranger who stepped out of the Abbess Radegunde as out of a gown dropped to the floor. This stranger was without feeling, though Radegunde's tears still stood on her cheeks, and there was no kindness or joy in her. She got up without tak- ing care of her dress where the dirty rushes stuck to it; it was as if the dress were an accident and did not concern her. She said in a voice I had never heard before, one with no feeling in it, as if I did not concern her, or Thorvald Einarsson either, as if neither of us were worth a second glance: 'Thorvald, turn around.\" Far up in the hall something stirred. Soulf 39 ''Now come back. This way/' There were footsteps, coming closer. Then the big Norseman walked clumsily into the room jerkl jerki jerki at every step as if he were being pulled by a rope. Sweat beaded his face. He said, \"You — how?\" \"By my nature,\" she said. \"Put up your right arm, fox. Now the left. Now both down. Good.\" \"You — trolll\" he said. \"That is so,\" she said. \"Now listen to me, you. There's a man inside you but he's not worth getting at; .1 tried moments ago when I was new-hatched and he's buried too deep, but now I have grown beak and claws and care nothing for him. It's almost dawn and your boys are stirring; you will go out and tell them that we must stay here another three days. You are weather- wise; make up some story they will be- lieve. And don't try to tell anyone what happened here tonight; you will find that you cannot.\" \"Folk — come,\" said he, trying to turn his head, but the effort only made him sweat. She raised her eyebrows. \"Why should they? No one has heard any- thing. Nothing has happened. You will go out and be as you always are and I will play Radegunde. For three days only. Then you are free.\" He did not move. One could see that to remain still was very hard for him; the sweat poured and he strained until every muscle stood out. She said: \"Fox, don't hurt yourself. And don't push me; I am not fond of you. My hand is light upon you only be- cause you still seem to me a little less unhuman than the rest; do not force me to make it heavier. To be plain: I have just broken Thorfinn's neck, for I find that the change improves him. Do not make me do the same to you.\" \"No worse — than death,\" Thor- vald brought out. \"Ah, no?\" said she, and in a mo- ment he was screaming and clawing at his eyes. She said, \"Open them, open them; your sight is back,\" and then, \"I do not wish to bother myself thinking up worse things, like worms in your guts. Or do you wish dead sons and a dead wife? Now go. “As you always do, “ she added sharply, and the big man turned and walked out. One could not have told from looking at him that anything was wrong. I had not been sorry to see such a bad man punished, one whose friends had killed our folk and would have taken for slaves — and yet I was sorry, too, in a way, because of the seals barking and the whales — and he was splendid, after a fashion — and yet tru- ly 1 forgot all about that the moment he was gone, for I was terrified of this strange person or demon or whatever it was, for I knew that whoever was in the room with me was not the Abbess Radegunde. I knew also that it could t^ll where 1 was and what I was doing, even if I made no sound, and was in a terrible riddle as to what 1 ought to do Fantasy & Science Fiction when soft fingers touched my face. It was the demon, reaching swiftly and silently behind her. And do you know, all of a sudden everything was all right I I don't mean that she was the Abbess again — 1 still had very serious suspicions about that >— but all at once I felt light as air and nothing seemed to matter very much because my stomach was full of bub> bles of happiness, just as if I had been drunk, only nicer. If the Abbess Rade- gunde were really a demon, what a joke that was on her peoplel And she did not, now that I came to think of it, seem a bad sort of demon, more the frightening kind than the killing kind, except for Thorfinn, of course, but then Thorfinn had been a very wicked man. And did not the angels of the Lord smite down the wicked? So per- haps the Abbess was an angel of the Lord and not a demon, but if she were truly an angel, why had she not smit- ten the Norsemen down when they first came and so saved all our folk? And then I thought that whether angel or demon, she was no longer the Ab- bess and would love me no longer, and if 1 had not been so full of the silly hap- piness which kept tickling about inside me, this thought would have made me weep. I said, \"Will the bad Thorvald get free, demon?\" \"No,\" she said. \"Not even if I sleep.\" 1 thought: But she does not love me. \"I love thee,\" said the strange voice, but it was not the Abbess Rade- gunde's and so was without meaning, but again those soft fingers touched me and there was some kindness in them, even if it was a stranger's kindness. Sleep, they said. So I did. The next three days I had much secret mirth to see the folk bow down to the demon and kiss its hands and weep over it because it had sold itself to ransom them. That is what Sister Hedwic told them. Young Thorfinn had gone out in the night to piss and had fallen over a stone in the dark and broken his neck, which secretiy rejoic- ed our folk, but his comrades did not seem to mind much either, save for one young fellow who had been Throfinn's friend, 1 think, and so went about with a long face. Thorvald locked me up in the Abbess's study with the demon every night and went out — or so folk said — to one of the young women, but on those nights the demon was si- lent, and I lay there with the secret tickle of merriment in my stomach, caring about nothing. On the third morning I woke sober. The demon — or the Abbess — for in the day she was so like the Abbess Radegunde that I wondered — took my hand and walked us up to Thor- vald, who was out picking the people to go aboard the Norseman's boats at the riverbank to be slaves. Folk were standing about weeping and wringing their hands; I thought this strange Souls 41 because of the Abbess's promise to pick those whose going would hurt least, but 1 know now that least is not none. The weather was bad, cold rain out of mist, and some of Thorvald's companions were speaking sourly to him in the Norse, but he talked them down — bluff and hearty — as if mak- ing light of the weather. The demon stood by him and said, in German, in a low voice so that none might hear: \"You will say we go to find the Abbess's treasure and then you will go with us into the woods.\" He spoke to his fellows in Norse and they frowned, but the end of it was that two must come with us, for the demon said it was such a treasure as three might carry. The demon had the voice and manner of the Abbess Radegunde, all smiles, so they were fooled. Thus we started out into the trees behind the viUage, with the rain worse and the ground beginning to soften underfoot. As soon as the vil- lage was out of sight, the two Norse- men fell behind, but Thorvald did not seem to notice this; I looked back and saw the first man standing in the mud with one foo"
