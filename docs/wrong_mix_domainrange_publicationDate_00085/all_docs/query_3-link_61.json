That is, except for Bink of North Village. He was sure he possessed no magic, and knew that if he didn’t find some soon, he would be exiled. According to the Good Magician Humpfrey, the charts said that Bink was as powerful as the King or even the Evil Magician Trent. Unfortunately, no one could determine its form. Meanwhile, Bink was in despair. If he didn’t find his magic soon, he would be forced to leave…\n\n.\n\nThe Source of Magic\n\nOrdered by King Trent to determine the source of Xanth’s magic, Bink and his companions were harried by an unseen enemy determined to thwart them.

Dor was left with the burden of ruling and with Irene, who was entirely too willing to be his Queen!His only hope was to enter Mundania and find King Trent. Bravely He started forth, together with Irene, a golem, a centaur, and a young ogre, heading for the far south of Xanth. The entrance to Mundania, of course, lay to the north…\n\nOgre, Ogre\n\nSmash, himself, was part ogre.
