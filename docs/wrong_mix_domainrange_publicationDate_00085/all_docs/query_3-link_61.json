That is, except for Bink of North Village. He was sure he possessed no magic, and knew that if he didnâ€™t find some soon, he would be exiled. According to the Good Magician Humpfrey, the charts said that Bink was as powerful as the King or even the Evil Magician Trent. Unfortunately, no one could determine its form. Meanwhile, Bink was in despair. If he didnâ€™t find his magic soon, he would be forced to leaveâ€¦\n\n.\n\nThe Source of Magic\n\nOrdered by King Trent to determine the source of Xanthâ€™s magic, Bink and his companions were harried by an unseen enemy determined to thwart them. When even their protector turned against them, Blink still managed to reach his goal and carry out the Kingâ€™s ordersâ€¦\n\nbut the king did not expect Blinkâ€™s next act to destroy utterly the magic of Xanth!\n\nCastle Roogna\n\nMillie, a ghost for 800 years wants only one man Jonathan, and heâ€™s a zombie. To prove himself, Magician Dor volunteers to get the potion that can restore Jonathan to full life. But he has to go back through time to do it, to a peril haunted, ancient Xanth, where danger lurks at every turnâ€¦\n\n.\n\nCentaur Aisle\n\nDor was having trouble growing up to be the next Magician King of the Land of Xanth. He wanted no part in running the Kingdom. But now Good King Trent was leaving on a trade mission to the non magical Mundania, home of such unlikely beasts as horses and bears, so Dor had to take over for a week. After three weeks, King Trent still hadnâ€™t returned. Surely something terrible had happened to him? Dor was left with the burden of ruling and with Irene, who was entirely too willing to be his Queen!His only hope was to enter Mundania and find King Trent. Bravely He started forth, together with Irene, a golem, a centaur, and a young ogre, heading for the far south of Xanth. The entrance to Mundania, of course, lay to the northâ€¦\n\nOgre, Ogre\n\nSmash, himself, was part ogre. Although ogres were considered so stupid they coud hardly speak, and spent their time eating young girls, seven assorted females had suddenly turned to him for guidance and saftety? In Xanth, one visit to the Good Magician Humfrey worked wondersâ€¦\n\n.\n\nNight Mare\n\nAlthough the Nextwave of barbarian warriors was invading Xanth, Mare Imbrium discovered that ever since she had gained the half soul, the Night Mare had begun to mishandle her job of delivering bad dreams. Exiled to the day world with a message for King Trent, Mare met the relentless, unforgiving Horseman. For the Night Mare, it began to be all a horrible nightmare!\n\nDragon on a Pedestal\n\nThere is trouble in Xanth again. The Gap Dragon had escaped and was ravaging across the land, the forget spell was causing mass amnesia, three year old Ivy was headed right for a hungry dragon. Could things get any worse? Probablyâ€¦\n\n.\n\nCrewel Lye\n\nJordan was a ghost in Castle Roogna now. Although once he had been the most valorus of knights that is, until he was betrayed by two wily magicians and the woman he loves. Now, if he only can remember how he was killed, heâ€™ll be able to reassemble his body. And he is getting impatientâ€¦\n\n.\n\nGolem in the Gears\n\nGrundy Golem got no respect. So, to prove himself, he volunteered for a quest to find the long lost dragon, Stanley Steamer. On the way, he somehow manages to free a damsel in distress but not without incurring the wrath of the Sea Hag in the process. And when it comes to avenging herself on Grundy, the Sea Hag will never give upâ€¦\n\n.\n\nVale of the Vole\n\nWhen Esk, a young ogre nymph human, began his pilgrimage to the Good Magician Humfrey to rid himself of a seductive demoness, little did he know it would become a mission of mercy. A running river paradise and its harmless inhabitants were perishing in the wrathful wake of a greedy demon horde. Now it is up to Esk and his companions a beautiful winged centaur named Chex and a brave burrower Called Volney to search Xanthâ€™s treacherous reaches, gathering together a mind boggling company of creatures to defend the precious Vale of the Vole.\n\nHeaven Cent\n\nIn the mind of Xanthâ€™s precious shapeshifting Prince Dolph, the perfect was to see the world is to search for the missing sorcerer, Humfrey.

Especially when all you do is sit around Castle Roogna. But when Ivy uses the Heaven Cent, it takes her not to the top of Mount Rushmost, where the winged monsters gather, not to the sea where the merfolk swim but to Mundania, a world much like out own that is, boring. It is here that she meets a young college student so dull that he doesnâ€™t even believe in magic, or princesses, or Xanth!Does he have a lot to learn. The thrilling climax to the trilogy started in Vale of the Vole and continued in Heaven Cent.\n\nIsle of View\n\nLovelornLoveworn Love LostPerplexed Prince Dolph, Xanthâ€™s precocious shapeshifter, should be in love but isnâ€™t. Nonetheless, he must chose between two fianc es Nada the uninterested and Electra the uninteresting or all three of them will suffer the most dire consequences. Luckily a convenient catastrophe has popped up to distract Dolph form his dilemma the foal napping of young Che Centaur by goblins. And the only one who knows where Che is is a nice but remarkably naive elflike gir named Jenny from the World of Two Moons. If anyone can save the missing centaurâ€¦\n\nshe sure canâ€™t.\n\nQuestion Quest\n\nYouth is Wasted on the Young Being grown up is a dragâ€¦\n\nor so thinks Lacuna, one of the michievous Castle Zombie twins.

As she grew to womanhood, she wondered where where she would find the one true love with whom she could share her life. So, naturally, she sets off to find the Good Magician Humfrey to ask him for an Answer to the riddle of her heartâ€™s desire. But hUmfrey, for mysterious reason of his own, propels her instead on a perilous quest in search of truth, friendship, and, just possibly, happiness.\n\nGeis of the Gargoyle\n\nSince Xanth began, the gargoyles of that magical place have been under a magical compulsion to protect the purity of the Swan Knee River which flows in to Xanth from dreary Mundania.

So Gary does what any sensible Xanth resident with a dire dilemma would do.
