Lamar, Missouri, Birthplace of Harry S Truman, vintage postcard

A vintage postcard view of the Birthplace of President Harry S Truman, Lamar, Missouri. This is located a few blocks from the Barton County Courthouse at 1009 Truman Street, Lamar, Missouri.

Harry S Truman was born in this modest house on May 8, 1884. The pine tree at the left hand side of the house was planted by his father on the day Harry was born. The family only lived here for another eleven months before settling in Grandview, Missouri. In 1890, the family moved to Independence, Missouri where Truman spent the rest of his life outside of his time in Washington, DC where Truman served as a Senator from Missouri from 1935 to 1945. During Franklin D. Roosevelt's campaign for a fourth term as President, Truman was selected as the Vice-Presidential candidate, taking office on January 20, 1945. Less than 90 days later, Truman would become President when Roosevelt died on April 12, 1945. Truman was re-elected to serve a second term as President after he won an upset victory in the 1948 campaign against Thomas Dewey who was widely expected to easily win in a landslide election.
