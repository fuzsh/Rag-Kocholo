We visited the Harry S Truman Birthplace State Historic Site on June 25, 2023, and it was late in the day, but we were thankful that they were still open and that the tour was free. The home is located at 009 Truman St, Lamar, Missouri. When he was 10 months old the family moved. When he was 6 years old, the family moved and he grew up in Independence, Missouri. The guide was a sweet young lady who gave an excellent tour and even allowed us two separate tours because we had the dogs with us. We kept our tours short because of the same. It is interesting to learn about the birthplace of our 33rd President who was from our home State of Missouri. President Truman was the Vice President under President Franklin Roosevelt for 82 days when President Roosevelt died on April 12, 1945.

President Truman was born in this room on May 8, 1884.

This is a photo of a tree that is an offspring of the original tree that was here when President Truman was born.
