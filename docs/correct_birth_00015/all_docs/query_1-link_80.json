        "text": "Harry S. Truman Quotes\n\n“Without a strong educational system democracy is crippled. Knowledge is not only key to power. It is the citadel of human freedom.”\n\n“Not all readers are leaders, but all leaders are readers.”\n\n“Keep working on a plan. Make no little plans. Make the biggest plan\n\nyou can think of and spend the rest of your life carrying it out.”\n\n“In reading the lives of great men, I found that the first victory they\n\nwon was over themselves… self-discipline with all of them came first.”\n\n“A pessimist is one who makes difficulties of his opportunities and\n\nan optimist is one who makes opportunities of his difficulties.”\n\n“There is nothing new in the world except the history you do not know.”\n\n“For our day, and our children’s day, education must become a continuing\n\nadventure in human understanding, shared by all.”\n\n“If peace is to endure, education must establish the moral unity of\n\nmankind.”\n\n“The inherent dignity of man can only be exemplified through equality\n\nof opportunity for all. In striving toward that objective we look to the\n\nAmerican school as a standard bearer.”\n\n“The unfettered soul of free man offers a spiritual defense unconquered\n\nand unconquerable.”\n\n“To take full advantage of the increasing possibilities of nature, we\n\nmust equip ourselves with increasing knowledge.”\n\n“We must remember that we cannot insulate our children from the uncertainties\n\nof the world in which we live or from the impact of the problems which confront\n\nus all. What we can do and what we must do is to equip them to meet these\n\nproblems, to do their part in the total effort, and to build up those inner\n\nresources of character which are the main strength of the American people.”\n\n“What may have been sufficient yesterday is not sufficient today. New\n\nand terrible urgencies, new and terrible responsibilities, have been placed\n\nupon education.”\n\n“No nation can maintain a position of leadership in the world of today\n\nunless it develops to the full its scientific and technological resources.\n\nNo government adequately meets its responsibilities unless it generously\n\nand intelligently supports and encourages the work of science in the university,\n\nindustry and in its own laboratories.”\n\n“I think this country is great on account of its small educational institutions,\n\nmore than anything else. In institutions such as these the teachers and professors\n\ncan give individual attention to each member of class.”\n\n“Education is our first line of defense. In the conflict of principle\n\nand policy which divides the world (today), America’s hope, our hope, the hope\n\nof the world, is in education.”"
