        "text": "Harry S. Truman\n\nA skinny kid with glasses, Harry Truman didn't look much like a hero. Raised on his grandparent's farm in Missouri, Truman had loving parents and remembered his childhood as one of \"wonderful days and great adventures.\" Young Truman read \"everything I could get my hands onhistories and encyclopedias and everything else.\" Always neat and clean as a boy, Truman felt he was never popular. Later he would say, \"To tell the truth, I was kind of a sissy.\"\n\nTruman wanted to attend West Point, but his poor eyesight kept him out, and his family could not afford college. So Truman went to work as a timekeeper, bank clerk, and farmer. When the First World War began, he enlisted in the army.\n\nAs captain of a rough and tough artillery regiment, Truman learned that he possessed great courage and that he was an excellent leader of men. Returning home a hero, Truman began his life in politics, serving first as county commissioner, then as United States senator, and eventually as vice president.\n\nTruman had been vice president for only eighty-one days when President Franklin D. Roosevelt died. Suddenly Truman was president of the United States. He knew nothing about the late president's plans and policies and felt absolutely dazed when he took the oath of office. Although Truman felt unprepared to become president, others had great confidence in him. Perhaps John Nance Gardner said it best, \"Truman is honest and patriotic and has a head full of good horse sense. Besides, he has gutsÖ\" And so he did.\n\nKnown as \"Give 'Em Hell\" Harry, President Truman was plain spoken and meant what he said. He made many courageous and often unpopular decisions. Regardless of the opinion of others, Truman believed that he should always do right as he saw it and that he should take responsibility for his actions.\n\nTruman didn't shirk the hard decisions. He ordered the atomic bomb dropped on Japan to end the Second World War. He led the way to help the war-ravaged countriesally and enemy aliketo rebuild with billions of American dollars. He led the fight against communism by involving the United States in the Korean War and by joining European countries in an international alliance called NATO.\n\nAt home, Truman advanced civil rights by desegregating the armed forces. Although not successful, Truman fought for civil rights in all aspects of American life because he believed that African-Americans deserved equal rights."
