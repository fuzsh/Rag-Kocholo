I ask that Domestic(USA) select $4.95 for orders over $25.00 to cover Insurance and Tracking. For Orders less then $25.00, there is no tracking but i will cover cost if orders are lost or damaged by the post office. Reason for higher ship cost on orders under $25.00 is an insurance to cover lost or damaged orders. For orders over $25.00, i will not be responsible if you do not select the $4.95 option for tracking and insurance. So please select the correct option. Same goes for International. I will not be responsible for orders over $25.00 if you do not select the $16.25 Shipping option which has Tracking and Covers Insurance. if you have any questions, Please write me. We thank you for your business. All orders go out the same day orders are placed. Sincerely. Alan G\n\nReturns Accepted\n\nYes\n\nReturns Policy\n\nI will accept returns within 10 Days of Purchase."
