        "text": "Harry S. Truman was born in Missouri on May 8, 1884. He was Franklin Delano Rooseveltâ€™s vice president for just 82 days before Roosevelt died and Truman became the 33rd president. In his first months in office he dropped the atomic bomb on Japan, ending World War II. His policy of communist containment started the Cold War, and he initiated U.S. involvement in the Korean War. Truman left office in 1953 and died in 1972."
