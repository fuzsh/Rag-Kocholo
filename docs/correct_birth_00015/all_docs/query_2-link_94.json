        "text": "Presidential $1 Coin Program\n\nYear of Issue: 2015\n\nAuthorizing Legislation: Public Law 109–145\n\nBackground\n\nHarry S. Truman was born in Lamar, Missouri, in 1884. After serving in the Missouri National Guard and the U.S. Army, he was elected county court judge before serving two terms in the U.S. Senate.\n\nTruman was elected vice president in November 1944. In less than three months of his term, he was thrust into the presidency following the sudden death of his predecessor in April 1945. He told reporters, “I felt like the moon, the stars, and all the planets had fallen on me.”\n\nIndeed, Truman faced critical foreign and domestic challenges during his two-term presidency, including guiding the nation through the final stages of the war against Japan and avoiding a recession during the transition from war to peace; preventing the spread of communism; and addressing civil rights issues. Highlights of his presidency include the:\n\nTruman Doctrine, affirming the United States’ willingness to provide military aid to countries resisting communism.\n\nMarshall Plan, a strategy for reviving the economies of the European nations\n\nNegotiation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a military alliance to protect Western nations.\n\nFair Deal, a program outlining his agenda for domestic economic growth and social reform.\n\nUse of executive orders to end racial segregation in the armed forces and civil service.\n\nAppointment of eighteen women to high ranking posts, including Georgia Neese Clark, the first U.S. Treasurer.\n\nCoinage legislation enacted during presidency:\n\nPrivate Law 438, 79th Congress, 60 Stat. 1134-1135), approved March 22, 1946: Authorized a Congressional Gold Medal to General of the Army George Catlett Marshall and Fleet Admiral Ernest Joseph King.\n\nPrivate Law 831, 79th Congress, 60 Stat. 1297-1298, approved August 7, 1946: Congressional Gold Medal to General of the Armies of the United States John J.

Deviations from the weights of each of America’s four silver coins were to be six grains for the dollar, four grains for the half-dollar, three grains for the quarter, and one and one-half grains for the dime.\n\nAct of May 10, 1950: Amended section 3526 of the Revised Statutes relating to coinage of subsidiary silver coins. The gain arising from the coinage of silver from bullion was to be credited to a newly established silver-profit fund, among whose several uses was to cover the cost of distributing silver coins.
