The event also featured several competitions, including bubble blowing, nail driving, and a “call your husband for dinner” competition.\n\n“It’s humbling to be a part of, it always comes together so great, and like I said earlier, we’re just happy the showers got over early today. Now it is beautiful and perfect temperature,” said Kim O’Sullivan, Barton County Chamber Director.\n\nHarry S Truman is the only president to come from Missouri. His birthday is Wednesday, May 8."
