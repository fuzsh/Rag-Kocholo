The Truman family moved to Harrisonville, Mo., ten months after Harry’s birth.  The Trumans never resided in the house again, but Harry returned in 1959 when the State of Missouri dedicated it as part of Harry S Truman Birthplace State Historic Site. Marker dedicated to Harry’s accomplishments on April 19, 1959, when his birthplace became a state historic site.",
