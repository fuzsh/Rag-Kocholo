Truman change his middle name to just S?\n\nROY JENKINS, in his excellent biography of Truman, tells us that \"the S stood for nothing but S\". By way of explanation, he adds that the choice of form by Truman's parents stemmed from a desire to balance between the competing claims of Soloman Young (Truman's maternal grandfather) and Anderson Shippe Truman (his paternal grandfather). Whether either was satisfied, Jenkins adds, is not recorded. Truman was, therefore, born and registered as Harry S. Truman at Lamar, Barton County, Missouri on 8 May, 1884. I do not know if it is permitted to ask a question when giving an answer, but where did the story about Sergei originate from?\n\nT. D. Rees, Gosport, Hants.\n\nI ONCE READ in a book that his middle name was Swinomish. I have never heard or read this since. I do not know if this is even a real name. Not much help, I know, but this question has few road maps.\n\nJames MacDonald, New York, USA (jmacdona@datamonitor.com)\n\nIT SHOULD be noted that, because Trueman's middle name is actually \"S\", there should not be a full stop after it. Rarely do publications print his name correctly as Harry S Truman.\n\nSteve Baldock, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (aball@marketinc.co.au)\n\nThe correct answer is that he didn't change his name. It was always S from his naming day.\n\nJack Hill, St Albans, England\n\nI once read that every name of every US president is also a placename in the US. For example there are towns called John, Fitzgerald and Kennedy. The only exception to this is that there is no town called S.\n\nSimon Koppel, London\n\nTruman aside and more to the point, why are US citizens so obsessed with displaying their middle initials in this fashion?\n\nPete A Wigens, Stroud, Glos UK\n\nIn response to T. D. Rees: In the movie, '18 Again' it is suggested that Truman changed his name from Sergei, named for an east European uncle. Foreseeing the Russian troubles that would follow after world war two, he made up the story about the S. I'm not sure if it is true or not though.\n\nTim Kelly, Dunfermline, Scotland\n\nAdd your answer"
