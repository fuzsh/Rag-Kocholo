        "text": "Truman was born in Lamar, Missouri, on May 8, 1884. He was the oldest of the three children of John Anderson Truman, a farmer, and Martha Young. Harry graduated from high school in Independence, Missouri.\n\nA member of the Missouri National Guard, Truman volunteered to serve in World War I in 1917. He fought in France and then returned to the United States in 1919. That year he married Elizabeth (Bess) Wallace. They had one daughter.\n\nWith an Army friend, Truman opened a men’s clothing store in Kansas City. The business failed in the early 1920s.\n\nWorld War II in Europe soon ended, but war with Japan continued. Hoping to prevent more U.S. deaths by making Japan surrender, Truman decided to use the newly invented atomic bomb in Japan. In early August 1945 U.S. airplanes dropped atomic bombs on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The bombs killed more than 100,000 men, women, and children. Japan surrendered on August 14, 1945.\n\nAfter the war Truman helped the United States join the United Nations, a new international peace organization. He also introduced the Truman Doctrine. That policy said that the United States would fight the spread of Communism, the political system of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 1948 Truman approved the Marshall Plan. Under the plan the United States sent billions of dollars to help rebuild Europe. By strengthening the economies of western Europe, the plan prevented Communism from spreading there. That year Truman also ordered desegregation (the mixing of races) in the U.S. military.\n\nAfter beginning his second term in 1949, Truman presented a program of reforms called the Fair Deal. He wanted more public housing, more money for education, higher wages, government-protected civil rights, and national health insurance. Congress did not pass most of the Fair Deal reforms, but citizens debated Truman’s ideas for years to come.\n\nThe Korean War began during Truman’s second term. In 1950 Communist North Korea invaded South Korea. Backed by the United Nations, Truman ordered U.S. military forces to help South Korea. The war dragged on past the end of Truman’s presidency."
