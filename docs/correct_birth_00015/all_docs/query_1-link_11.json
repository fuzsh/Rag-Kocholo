        "text": "The Trumans move to 619 Crysler Street in Independence, Missouri.\n\nYoung Harry meets Bess Wallace for the first time in First Presbyterian Church’s Sunday School. He was six years old and she was five. “I saw a beautiful curly haired girl there,” Truman remembered years later. “I thought (and still think) she was the most beautiful girl I ever saw. She had tanned skin, blond hair, golden as sunshine, and the most beautiful blue eyes I’ve ever seen or ever will see.”\n\nIn January, Harry becomes seriously ill with diphtheria and is forced to drop out of the second grade at the Noland School. After starting to recover, he suffered a relapse and became paralyzed for perhaps a few months. His parents pushed him around in a baby carriage or laid him on the floor with a book to read. According to his sister, Mary Jane, it was during these months of immobility that he developed his lifelong love of reading.\n\nHarry Truman graduates from Independence High School.\n\nNo grading books or report cards survive to indicate what kind of student Harry was in high school, but Harry later reflected that he was, academically, “along about the middle.” In an essay on “Courage,” Harry wrote that “a true heart[,] a strong mind and a great deal of courage and I think a man will get through the world,” which describes fairly well the attitude he would try to bring to his presidency many years later.\n\nAmong Harry’s classmates was Charles G. Ross, who would forty-four years later become Truman’s White House press secretary.\n\nJune 28\n\nHarry and Bess are married on June 28 at Trinity Episcopal in Independence, Missouri.\n\nShortly before the wedding, Truman and Eddie Jacobson open a haberdashery at 104 West 12th Street in downtown Kansas City. After brief initial success, the store went bankrupt during the recession of 1921. Harry and Eddie remained close friends, and Jacobson’s advice to Truman later played a role in the U.S. government’s decision to recognize Israel.\n\nMay\n\nTruman is selected as one of the 10 most useful officials in Washington, D.C. in a poll by Look Magazine.\n\nJuly 21\n\nTruman is nominated for the office of vice president at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.\n\nJan 20\n\nTruman is inaugurated for his second term as president. In his inaugural address, he calls for a “bold new program” to help underprivileged peoples of the earth (Point IV Program).\n\nAug 10\n\nTruman signs the National Security Act Amendment, establishing a unified Department of Defense.\n\nMay 8\n\nTruman becomes the first former president to address the U. S. Senate while it is in formal session. The Senate honors him on his 80th birthday.\n\nJuly 30\n\nPresident Johnson signs the Medicare bill at the Truman Library. Mr. and Mrs. Truman will receive Medicare registration cards numbers one and two in January 1966. On his Medicare application form, Truman writes “Farmer” on the line next to “Former Occupation.”\n\nThis website uses cookies so that we can provide you with the best user experience possible.
