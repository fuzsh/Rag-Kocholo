        "text": "About This Statue\n\nPresident Harry S. Truman was born on May 8, 1884 in Lamar, Missouri and was raised in Independence. When the United States entered World War I in 1917, Truman enlisted in the Army, serving first as an artillery instructor. In Europe, he earned his men's respect and distinguished himself as captain of an artillery battery.\n\nReturning home after the war, Truman was elected a judge of the Jackson County Court in 1922.\n\nHe later served as a U.S. Senator from Missouri from 1935-1945.\n\nDuring World War II, he headed the Senate war investigating committee, checking into waste and corruption and saving perhaps as much as 15 billion dollars.\n\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt selected Truman as his vice-presidential running mate on the way to winning an unprecedented fourth term in 1944.\n\nEighty-two days after taking their oaths of office, Roosevelt died, leaving Truman to serve as president during the final months of World War II.\n\nTruman won election to a full term as president in 1948.\n\nMajor developments during his presidency included the formation of NATO, the start of the Cold War, establishment of a postwar economy, and racial integration of the armed services."
