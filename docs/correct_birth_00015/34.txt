On May 8, 1884, in Lamar, Mo., John and Martha Ellen Young Truman welcomed their first born child into the world. Harry S. Truman was named after his mother’s brother Harry Young, and received a middle initial “S” to honor his paternal grandfather Anderson Shipp Truman and maternal grandfather Solomon Young. However the letter “S” did not specifically stand for either Shipp or Solomon.

The Truman family moved to Harrisonville, Mo., ten months after Harry’s birth. The Trumans never resided in the house again, but Harry returned in 1959 when the State of Missouri dedicated it as part of Harry S Truman Birthplace State Historic Site.

Marker dedicated to Harry’s accomplishments on April 19, 1959, when his birthplace became a state historic site.
