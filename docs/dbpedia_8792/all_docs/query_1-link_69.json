        "text": "This snapshot presents strengths and weaknesses of national nutrition policy actions in Slovakia. Compare Slovakia with other European countries in our NOURISHING policy index.\n\n> Read the NOURISHING snapshot for Slovakia in English or Slovak\n\nSlovakia implements policy actions in only 5 out of the 10 policy areas of the NOURISHING framework. Of these 5 policy areas, the highest assessment achieved was moderate, in standards on food in schools and other specific locations (O), showing important gaps and weaknesses in nutrition and diet-related policy.\n\nNotable gaps were identified in food and drink availability within the immediate vicinity of schools and other out-of-education settings, which impacted otherwise well-designed standards for food offered in schools (O). Similarly, a lack of public awareness campaigns that increase healthy eating (I2) led to a fair assessment in the policy area, which also includes food-based dietary guidelines. Much more needs to be done in food marketing and advertising to young people (R) to decrease exposure particularly in/around schools.\n\nAs no policy action was taken in 5 policy areas, coupled with weak policy design throughout the entire framework, greater action is needed in all policy areas. Priority should be given to areas where no policy action was identified, specifically creating a healthier retail and food service environment (S), public food procurement and other supply chain actions (H), limits or removal of specific nutrients in food products (I1), nutrition education and skills (N2), and nutrition counselling in healthcare (G).\n\nDownload a full analysis and breakdown of Slovakiaâ€™s results\n\nThis country snapshot presents detailed results of the NOURISHING policy index for Slovakia. Full index results are outlined in the NOURISHING policy brief, which compares Slovakia with other European countries and explains the methods for producing this snapshot and the index.\n\nThe index assesses if national government policy actions exist across all areas of the NOURISHING framework and, if so, how well designed they are. We produced this assessment by benchmarking policies from Slovakia, collected through a comprehensive scan. You can view all benchmarked policies in our NOURISHING database.\n\nOverview of nutrition policy status in Slovakia\n\nRead more about the NOURISHING policy index\n\nDownload the NOURISHING policy brief\n\nDownload all 30 country snapshots as a bundle\n\nMOVING country snapshots\n\nWe also have snapshots of physical activity policies in 30 European countries.
