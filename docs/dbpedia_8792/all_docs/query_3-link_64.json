        "text": "Both Slovenia and Slovakia are very nice countries to visit. However, a big problem with Slovenian identity abroad is that it is often confused with Slovakia, and vice versa. As travel bloggers from Slovenia, let’s look into some main differences between the two countries.\n\nIt’s true that the names sound similar, and even their flags look very similar. But this is not a reason to think that Slovenia and Slovakia are the same country. The mix-up has led to many public and ridiculous confusions, some of which have involved high-profile politicians.\n\nDespite both countries having been independent for over two decades, it still happens that the wrong anthem is played at sports tournaments. For example, the Slovenian anthem was played for Slovakia at the IIHF World Championships.\n\nHere are the 5 things to remember:\n\nThere are two countries in between Slovenia and Slovakia\n\nSlovenia and Slovakia are both Slavic-speaking, of Catholic tradition, and were once (before 1918) part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Because of this cultural heritage, they are usually considered to be part of “Central Europe.”\n\nHowever, they are not situated in the same place. Slovenia is south of the Alps, by the Adriatic Sea, bordering Italy and Croatia. It is separated from Slovakia by two non-Slavic countries: Austria and Hungary. Slovakia is further north, between Poland, Hungary, Ukraine, and Czechia.\n\nTheir history is different\n\nBoth countries were former member states of larger nations and experienced different historical events that led to their formation. At the beginning of the 1990s, Slovakia emerged from Czechoslovakia (Slovakia is at the end of the word Czechoslovakia), while Slovenia emerged from Yugoslavia. While Slovenia suffered from a war conflict, Slovakia separated from its Czech neighbor in a peaceful way.\n\nSlovenia has a population of about 2 million, whereas Slovakia has a population of 5.4 million.\n\nSlovenia is a coastal country\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the geographic position of the two countries is very different. Slovenia is the only country in Europe that combines four diverse geographical regions namely: the Alps, the Mediterranean, the Karst, and the Pannonian Plains.\n\nFurthermore, being by the Adriatic sea, Slovenia is a coastal country, whereas Slovakia is inland, situated directly in Central Europe with no access to the sea.\n\n4. Melania Trump is from Slovenia, so is Slavoj Žižek (famous philosopher)\n\nSlovenian born Melania Trump comes from a small Slovenian town of Sevnica in central Slovenia.\n\nSlavoj Žižek is undoubtedly Slovenia’s biggest intellectual export. A Slovenian-born philosopher and psychoanalyst is referred to as both the” Elvis of cultural theory” and the biggest box-office draw postmodernists have ever had.\n\nGreen is more than a colour in Slovenia\n\nSlovenia and Slovakia are both amazingly beautiful countries and tourist destinations on the rise. They both offer unspoiled natural landscapes to explore, spa towns, lakes, caves, and gorges. However, with more than half of Slovenia’s surface covered in forests (62 percent), Slovenia is one of the most forested European countries.\n\nIt is a real GREEN PARADISE of Europe. The green color is recognized as the most typical color in Slovenia, its trademark.\n\nThe “Slovene green” expresses the balance between the calmness of nature. It stands for unspoiled nature and the commitment to keeping it that way, representing the harmony of all senses.\n\nRead also: 5 Mistakes to avoid when coming to Slovenia – (letsgoslovenia.si)"
