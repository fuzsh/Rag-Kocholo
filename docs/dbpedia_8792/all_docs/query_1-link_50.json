        "text": "About beverage containers\n\nWhich beverage containers will be part of Slovakia’s deposit return system?\n\nSlovakia’s deposit system applies to almost all beverages in plastic bottles or cans with a volume of 0.1 to 3 liters. Containers not covered by the deposit system include packaging for milk and milk drinks, syrups, and alcoholic beverages with an alcohol content of more than 15%. These containers can continue to be discarded into curbside recycling bins at home.\n\nHow can consumers recognize which containers are included in the deposit system?\n\nEligible containers are marked with the symbol of Slovakia’s deposit system, a large Z symbol inside a recycling arrows icon. This symbol will be located near the container’s barcode along with the text \"ZALOHOVANE\" (meaning “deposit”).\n\nWhat is the deposit/refund value for a bottle or can?\n\nThe amount of the deposit is the same for all types of disposable beverage packaging: 15 euro cents. This applies whether it is a plastic bottle or a can, and whether it is a small or large beverage container.\n\nCan consumers return a damaged bottle?\n\nBottles and cans should be handed in uncrushed and with a legible barcode, as this is the way the return technology can verify them and refund the deposit.\n\nWhat happens if a container is not returned?\n\nPlastic bottles and cans that are not returned as part of the deposit system forfeit their 15 euro cents deposit. More importantly, that container loses the opportunity to become part of efficient waste collection toward bottle-to-bottle and can-to-can recycling and helping the environment.\n\nWhat happens if an eligible plastic bottle or can is disposed of in the curbside recycling bin at home?\n\nIf a container is disposed of in the home recycling bin, the refund will be lost. Also, because of its contact with other kinds of household materials, the container will become more costly, complicated and energy intensive to recycle.\n\nWhat happens to old containers without a “Z”?\n\nIt will be possible to return only (undamaged) beverage containers marked with the Z symbol and the text \"ZALOHOVANE\" at the collection point in the store. Containers without the Z symbol and the text “ZALOHOVANE” should be placed into a home recycling bin for collection.\n\nCan consumers return the old containers without a \"Z\" directly to the seller in the store?\n\nOld containers without a \"Z\" will not be accepted and a refund will not be paid. This is also the case for containers purchased abroad, containers with a damaged label, and containers not part of Slovakia’s deposit system. These containers can be placed in the home recycling bin as before.\n\nIt is up to retailers to decide whether to collect and process old containers not part of the deposit system. The deposit system’s Central System Administrator (Správca zálohového systému) will only take back from retailers the plastic bottles and cans which are part of the deposit system.\n\nAbout return points and reverse vending machines\n\nWhere can empty containers be returned?\n\nEmpty plastic bottles or cans can typically be returned to grocery stores. Stores with an area of more than 300 m2 are obliged to take back containers, most often at an automated “reverse vending machine”. For other stores, taking back containers in the deposit system is voluntary. In smaller shops, the containers can be returned at the cash register, where the employee will verify them using a hand-held scanner.\n\nHow do consumers get the deposit refund paid out?\n\nFor consumers, the entire system is set up practically and easily. Consumers can return empty beverage containers to the store, by putting it in the reverse vending machine or returning it at the cash register and waiting for confirmation of the refund amount. The deposit refund can be used as in-store credit toward purchases, or the amount can be paid out at the checkout.\n\nHow do reverse vending machines work?\n\nReverse vending machines are used for receiving, recognizing, sorting, and storing empty beverage containers. They will also print a coupon with the amount of the deposit refund. As such, they work in the same way as existing reverse vending machines in Slovakia for the return of glass bottles.\n\nCan a deposit refund be spent at any store?\n\nNo. Although bottles and cans can be returned in any participating store in Slovakia, regardless of where the drinks were purchased, the refund can only be spent in the store where the containers were returned.\n\nIs there a map of return points?\n\nThe map of participating return points will be published by the Slovak deposit system’s Central System Administrator at www.slovenskozalohuje.sk and/or www.spravcazaloh.sk at the beginning of 2022. It will be continuously updated with additional participating stores.\n\nAbout the Slovak deposit system"
