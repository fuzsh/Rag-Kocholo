        "text": "Itâs a trend seen across the globe: continued uncertainty despite the vanishing everyday impacts of the pandemic is forcing brands to reconsider their approach to CX and keep in step with changing customer expectations. In Slovakia itâs no different, and rising prices are forcing companies to find new ways to drive value or introduce cheaper alternatives of its products or services to retain customers.\n\nThe Non-grocery retail sector performed well in Slovakia in 2022 â itâs the highest performing in the sector rankings â and the sectorâs adoption of omnichannel approach to CX may prove critical to its success. Customers have high expectations when it comes to their digital experience. Even minor problems within their experience may lead to dissatisfaction with a product and a service and brands need to innovate and invest to improve.\n\nOf those brands overcoming these challenges is Dr Max pharmacy, which climbs eight places and breaks into the top two of this yearâs CEE brand rankings. Established in 2006, Dr Max is currently among the leading pharmacies in the Slovak Republic, with 340 locations throughout Slovakia and an e-shop. The leading European pharmacy chain recorded growth in all key CEE pillars in 2022, with the largest growth in Integrity, a crucial pillar for any healthcare brand.\n\nThe pharmacy is constantly improving customer experience, innovating in the digital space, and growing the scope of its services. Recent initiatives include âMax Driveâ, a three-hour delivery service to any address in Bratislava, the Slovakian capital, and a quick diagnostics service at each of its pharmacies.\n\nDr Max provides free delivery to a customer-selected store, which matches customer demand in the face of an expected double-digit rise in inflation and steep increases in prices across the market. Loyalty cards, discounts to regular customers and a strong selection of private label products also attract new customers and an e-shop ensures customers can engage with the brand on multiple channels. The pharmacy considers its 1,500 highly educated and emphatic employees as their greatest strength â and itâs reflected in customer feedback. As one customer said: âDr Max has very pleasant and friendly staff, a wide range of goods with a very reasonable price. Pleasant environment, helpful staff, I never wait long."
