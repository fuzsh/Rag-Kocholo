Currently, applicants relying on educational qualifications must hold at least a Master’s degree.\n\nInformation and communication technology. Applicants will be eligible if they will be working in either managerial (namely, ISCO-08 category 133) or professional (namely, ISCO-08 category 25) roles in information and communication technology and have at least three years of experience (acquired within the previous seven years) in these fields, even if they lack any academic qualifications.\n\nCurrently, only applicants with a Master’s level education are eligible for a Slovak EU Blue Card.\n\nEmployers can now hire highly skilled talent from a wider pool of applicants, especially in the information and communication technology sector. This is particularly pertinent given current labor shortages in Slovakia."
