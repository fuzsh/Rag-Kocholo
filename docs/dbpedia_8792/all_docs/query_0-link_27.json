        "text": "W\n\nhile Hungary’s Tokaji region doesn’t lack for history, investment and direction and Switzerland isn’t short of money or connoisseurship, other parts of Central Europe (other than a revitalised Austria – see separate section) continue to do less well. The Czech Republic and Slovakia both produce some decent dry whites. In the Czech Republic whites from the likes of Grüner Veltliner and Gewürztraminer are produced in Bohemia and Moravia and in Slovakia some well-made reds originate from the Nitra region, as well as good stylish whites from Pezinok just north of Bratislava. Perhaps most significant is the emergence of Château Bela, producing fine Rieslings in Stúrovo, just north of Hungary. Further east, nothing of real note has yet emerged from the Ukraine or Moldova despite there being some modern winemaking input in the latter. In Romania the best potential would appear to rest with the sweet botrytised wines of Cotnari and Murfatlar but some outside investment would be an immense advantage.\n\nWine regions homepage\n\nView the winery reviews\n\nLearn about our ratings, price guides and value for money\n\nView the grape glossary\n\nView the general glossary\n\nLearn more about Wine behind the label\n\nPurchase Wine behind the label print edition\n\nPurchase Wine behind the label digital edition\n\nThe following wine producers have a full profile in Wine behind the label:\n\nA to Z of producers by appellation\n\nCh.
