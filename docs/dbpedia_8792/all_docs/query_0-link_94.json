        "text": "FOXBOROUGH, Mass. (May 28, 2024) â New England Revolution goalkeeper Henrich Ravas has been named to the Slovakia National Team roster for its preparatory training camp ahead of the 2024 UEFA European Championship. Ravas will join the Slovakia team in Austria after the Revolutionâs MLS match at Nashville SC on Saturday, June 1. The 32-player squad will play two warm-up matches before the final 26-man roster will travel to Germany for the championship: Wednesday, June 5 against San Marino, and Sunday, June 9 against Wales.\n\nRavas, the only MLS player on Slovakiaâs preliminary roster for the UEFA Euro 2024, has made eight league starts in his first season with the Revolution, with four additional starts in the Concacaf Champions Cup campaign. The 26-year-old backstop has recorded four clean sheets in all competitions. Ravas is in search of his first senior cap with Slovakia as he continues to receive a steady stream of call-ups to the national team, having dressed for 10 of the nationâs 12 UEFA European Championship qualifying matches in 2023. Ravas was most recently selected for two friendlies in March 2024.\n\nThe Revolution will visit Nashville SC at GEODIS Park this Saturday, June 1 for an 8:30 p.m. ET kickoff, available to watch on MLS Season Pass on the Apple TV app. Listen on the radio at 98.5 The Sports Hub (WBZ-FM), with Portuguese commentary available on 1260 AM Nossa Radio."
