        "text": "BLACK DYNAMITE is slowly approaching the end of Season 2. Of course, I couldn’t just end Season 2 without one more interview from one of the many talented cast members of this hilarious show. Black Dynamite (Michael Jai White) is still the tall, dark and handsome hero saving the day accompanied by his faithful posse Bullhorn (Byron Minns), Cream Corn (Tommy Davidson), and Honeybee (Kym Whitley).\n\nI had an incredible conversation with both Michael Jai White and Tommy Davidson about “Black Dynamite”. Although we don’t have that conversation on video, I was able to relay some of that conversation through another fantastic interview with Tommy Davidson!\n\nTOMMY DAVIDSON is a talented actor and comedian. Born in Washington DC, he brought his standup comedy routine to clubs in the Washington DC, Baltimore, and Philadelphia area in the 1980’s. His breakout role was in the comedy sketch show “In Living Color” where he joined forces with Jamie Foxx, Jim Carrey, and Damon Wayans. From there, his acting career took off.\n\nHe appeared in several films, including “Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls”, “Strictly Business”, Booty Call, and “Juwana Mann”. Along with “In Living Color”, other tv credits include “MADtv”, “The Bernie Mac Show”, “Malcolm And Eddie”, “Everybody Hates Chris”, and “Between Brothers”. He provided his voice to films such as “Lilo And Stitch” and tv shows “The Proud Family”, “Ren And Stimpy” and “Black Dynamite” to name a few. He was nominated as best supporting actor for the Black Reel Awards for Spike Lee’s “Bamboozled” and nominated multiple times for the Image Awards for performances in “The Proud Family”.\n\nTommy Davidson continues to share his gift of comedy as he sells out every venue that he headlines internationally and grace our tv sets and the silver screen with his voice. This talented comedian is on the move and he isn’t slowing down!\n\nI can’t watch an episode without laughing. It is hilarious!\n\nYes!\n\nTell us about how Cream Corn has changed between Season 1 and Season 2.\n\nTommy: He’s the same guy really. He’s just getting a little more adventurous. Black Dynamite makes this guy do things. He’s actually starting to come out a little bit. He’s taking shots. He’s getting into the action.\n\nHe’s not really staying in the background doing what Black Dynamite tells him anymore?\n\nTommy: Yes. He’s more proactive.\n\nDoes he ever get the same swagger and get all the girls like Black Dynamite?\n\nTommy: No.\n\nHow did you get involved with the show?\n\nTommy: Michael Jai White and I have been friends for years. He worked in a couple movies of mine. He had an idea and called me. He said, “You’re the only who can play this role.” And I said, “You’re right!”\n\nYou were in both the movie and cartoon version of “Black Dynamite”. Was there much of a difference?\n\nTommy: The cartoon version was so much easier. I’m a voiceover artist so I can do that stuff so well. It’s one thing to do camera, but the voiceover thing is a gift. It’s bonus really. When I was a kid, I watched so much cartoons and come to find out later on I did it really well. As my comedy and acting career started progressing, I got jobs in animation and I was even better at that than all the other stuff.\n\nDo you see some of yourself in this character?\n\nTommy: Yes, I do. (laughing). A smooth dude who doesn’t bother many people. He wants to make sure he does the right thing.\n\nAre there any aspects of playing Cream Corn that you enjoy?\n\nTommy: I love how he looks. He’s a really smooth little guy with the curls. He doesn’t have the big muscles, but you know who he is. He just flows in and out of each scene.\n\nDid you have any favorite episodes on “Black Dynamite”?\n\nTommy: One of the ones I like is the one shown in Comic Con (2014). Twelve Years A Slave In Reverse. It’s really funny. The blacks had no idea slavery existed. They are so entrenched in their own neighborhood, that Black Dynamite didn’t even know slavery existed.\n\nThe interesting thing about that episode, and this show in general, is that it doesn’t matter what color you are, black, white, etc.\n\nTommy: Yes, of course.\n\nIn addition to voiceovers, you’ve done a lot of comedy. Would you say you started in comedy first?\n\nTommy: Standup started everything. Then that went to tv, which then led to animation.\n\nWhat attracted you to standup comedy and acting in general?\n\nTommy: My friend asked me to try it out. I actually had a real good job as a chef at Ramada Inn. 19 years old in western Virginia. I was happy and I told my friend about it. He said, “You’re stupid dude! If I were you, I’d be going to Hollywood. I’d be a comedian and a movie star. You’re wasting your life.” He set me up in a club after three months of him bothering me. It was actually a strip club of all places.\n\nReally?\n\nTommy: Yes. My first two months of standup were pretty fun (laughing). Then clubs started hearing about me and I started expanding out. And that’s how it started.\n\nAlthough you are known for comedy, you have done a lot of drama also, right?\n\nTommy: Yes. There was a television show and I did a movie “Bamboozled”. I’m really good at drama.\n\nA lot of the great comedians are amazing at drama and overall incredible actors. After all comedy, is hard. It is about finding the rhythm, beats . . .\n\nTommy: It is about timing. Comedy is very dependent on the writing and other actors. You are more dependent on the outside. With dramatic acting, if you have the feeling, you have the scene. If you are going to cry in the scene and you can cry, you got it.\n\nAs far as upcoming projects, what do you have coming up?\n\nTommy: I will be doing an episode of “Real Husbands Of Hollywood”. I’m doing a one man show on Broadway. I’m working on “That 70’s Two” movie. I’m producing other tv series. I have five movies up my aisle I’m producing right now.\n\nWhat can tv viewers look forward to on “Black Dynamite” this season?\n\nTommy: Look forward to going even further than the last season.\n\nAlong with mystery guests all the time?\n\nTommy: All the time.\n\nThank you for taking time to talk with Eclipse Magazine.\n\nTommy: Thank you.\n\nYou know a show is going to be hilarious if you can’t stop laughing during chats with cast members Tommy Davidson, Michael Jai White, Byron Minns, Kym Whitley, and executive producer/director Carl Jones. In fact, Michael and Byron are creators and writers for the show. Great writing, unique perspective on social issues that span beyond the 70’s to the present, stylized animation distinct to this show, and colorful characters played by gifted actors all add to the mystique of “Black Dynamite”.\n\nIf you missed out on any episodes this season, all is not lost.
