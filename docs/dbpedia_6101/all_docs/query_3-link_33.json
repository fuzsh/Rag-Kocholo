In the course of his childhood, he moved with his family from Colorado to Wyoming before finally making their way to Oregon when he was five years old.\n\nDavidson was also a witness to the divorce of the parents he was adopted by at the age of five. His mother then raised him in Washington, DC, where he spent his childhood. It was not uncommon for Tommy as a young child to move from one place to another, and his family moved around the DC area throughout these early years, as well. As a child, he lived in various areas and districts of Maryland such as Silver Spring, Wheaton, and Takoma Park.\n\nTommy attended the University of the District of Columbia for a single semester after graduating from high school. During this semester he studied communications at the University of the District of Columbia. It was during this time that he had the opportunity to intern at the radio station at the university. In addition to working in the kitchen of the Walter Reed National Medical Center as well as bussing tables at IHOP, Tommy also supported himself financially by working in the kitchen of this hospital. Aside from working in the storerooms, he was also employed as a cleaner to make ends meet.\n\nTommy Davidson Net Worth:\n\nThere is an estimate that Tommy Davidson Net Worth is more than $6 million in terms of his net worth.
