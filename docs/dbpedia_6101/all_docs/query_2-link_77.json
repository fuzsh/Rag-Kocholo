He’s touched on his birth mother and being abandoned as a toddler, but in an upcoming episode of TV One’s Uncensored, Davidson shares more about his emotional story.\n\n“I actually was abandoned in the trash in 1966, in Mississippi, and she found me,” The Proud Family star says about the woman who adopted him, per EURweb. “She had gone down there with her husband to do some immunization and some voting drives during the civil rights movement,” he explains. “They were teachers at Colorado State. They went down there and they were working with my natural mother.”\n\nWhen the couple returned to Mississippi after a year, they made the gruesome discovery after neighbors told them that Davidson’s natural mother left him at the home. Not only were there pimps in the now-abandoned home using drugs, but they found an emaciated Davidson.\n\n“She saw a pile of trash outside of the house,” Davidson explains about his adoptive mother. “Something told her to look under this tire that was on top of the trash. When she moved the tire, she saw my foot. She uncovered the trash and there I was, starved. I had contusions on my skull. I was in a coma. I was 18 months.”\n\nDavidson spent two months in the hospital before being released to the woman who discovered him and would go on to adopt him. At the time, his natural mother could not be located. Despite being blessed with a new family that loved him, Davidson admits it was not easy fitting in as the only Black child. The family moved from Colorado to Washington, D.C. when Davidson was 5-years-old. From there, his struggles with his identity began.\n\nWatch the clip below:\n\nDavidson’s Uncensored episode airs Sunday at 10 p.m."
