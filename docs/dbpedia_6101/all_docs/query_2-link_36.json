        "text": "Archives of Maryland\n\n(Biographical Series)\n\nThomas Davidson (b. 1800 - d. 1868)\n\nMSA SC 5496-1632\n\nSlave Owner, Anne Arundel County, Maryland, 19th Century\n\nBiography:\n\nThomas Davidson was one of the premier slave owners in Anne Arundel County during the mid-nineteenth century. The sixth child of James and Amelia Davidson enjoyed a life of privilege and comfort. At the age of fifteen, Thomas converted to Methodism during a trip to Georgetown. He would remain a loyal member of the Methodist Episcopal Church for the rest of his life. On May 30, 1839, he married Jane Welsh in a Methodist service conducted by the Rev. Thomas O. Summers.\n\nOver the next two decades, the Davidsons struggled to establish a family, since four of their six children died before they reached the age of five. Their first child, Alice, was born on August 7, 1841, and died during her second year in 1843. Their second child, Thomas James, was born on June 21, 1843, and passed away in 1845. Their third child, Sarah Frances, was born on June 28, 1845, and died during her fourth year in 1849. Benjamin Reed, the Davidson's fourth child, was born on May 26, 1846, and survived to become one of Anne Arundel County's most reputable and esteemed physicians during the latter half of the century. He married Alice Gray at All Hallow's Parish Church, Anne Arundel County, on February 17, 1874, in a service conducted by Reverend C.K. Nelson. Dr. Davidson died on May 1, 1910. George Earnest, Thomas and Jane's youngest son,, was born on March 16, 1850, and died in 1906. The Davidson's last child, Mary, was born in 1852 and passed during her second year in 1854. It is possible that the emotional hardship from the loss of four children contributed to Jane Davidson's reputation as a mean spirited mistress, known for her \"brutality.\"\n\nThomas and Jane were the first white inhabitants of what is now known as Davidsonville in Anne Arundel County. Davidson owned so much property that he was eulogized as \"the chieftain [sic] of this village\" after his death in 1868. One of his main sources of income was rent on land leased to poorer whites and free blacks. Henry Branford, a forty-six year old free African American, was one of many impoverished residents on Davidson's farm.\n\nAs Davidson's wealth increased over the years, he was able to purchase a significant body of slaves. In 1830, Davidson bought two slaves from Joseph Stewart, a man named Ned and a young girl named Eliza. Later that year, Davidson bought a ten year old girl named Mary from John Beard. In 1834, Davidson bought yet another ten year old girl, this time a slave named Harriet from Caleb Stewart. Two of Davidson's final additions were twenty-four year old Nelly and six year old Catharine, purchased from James H. Wells in 1856. By 1860, Davidson had approximately twenty-five slaves laboring under his supervision.\n\nAs the war between the states became imminent during the late 1850s, many Maryland slaves fled from bondage in hopes of securing their freedom or reaching close friends and family members. The slave community in Davidsonville was no exception. On September 6, 1845, seven of Davidson's slaves ran away: Anthony, aged thirty-three; his wife Kitty, aged twenty; their two children, Jim, six, and Bob, eighteen months; Maria, a \"copper colored, good looking\" slave, aged twenty; and her two children, Nelly, six, and Nick, four. A week later, on September 19, Davidson placed a runaway slave ad in the Baltimore Sun advertising a one hundred and fifty dollar reward for the capture and safe return of his slaves. However, Davidson was not without benevolence. On January 1, 1849, he manumitted Harriet Ogle, thrity-eight, one of his former slaves, and her daughter Laura Amelia, eight months.\n\nLocal tradition maintains that Davidson manumitted thirty to forty thousand dollars worth of slaves upon hearing President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation in 1861, and stated that \"a great burden\" had been \"lifted from his shoulders.\" However, the facts reveal that on March 4, 1864, Davidson testified before the Honorable Nicholas Brewer, Circuit Judge of the second Judicial Circuit of Maryland, in an attempt to receive compensation from the state of Maryland for his lost chattel. In a sworn statement, Davidson provided substantial information about twenty-two of his former slaves, all of whom had fled from bondage during the early 1860s. On March 4, 1862, three slave men ran from Davidson's farm: Henry Ogle, twenty-four; Moses Ogle, twenty-two; and John Datson (also known as John Hall), eighteen. A few months later, on January 14, 1863, Harry Bowie, aged thrity-five, fled from bondage as well. That summer, on June 9, six male slaves disappeared: Jacob Digges, forty; Samuel Brown, thrity-five; Jenny Olge, eighteen; Bob Eads, nineteen; Jim Neale, twenty; and Peter Gassaway, fifty. In November of the same year, an astonishing twelve slaves ran away on the 26th: Mary Susco, eighteen; Louisa Hall, forty; her six children, Julia Chase, twenty-four, Bill Hall, eighteen, Lucy Hall, sixteen, Jolly (or Sally) Hall, twelve, Ellich Hall, ten, Eliza Hall, six; and four children of Julia Chase, Catharine, seven, Daniel, six, John Wesley, four, and Grandison, eighteen months. The combined value of Davidson's runaway slaves was $15,705.\n\nAmong his white peers, Davidson garnered a reputation as a humble Christian, philanthropist, and abolitionist. The first Methodist church in the area, Mount Wesley Chapel Methodist Episcopal Church, was built in the early 1840s on land either given or sold by Davidson. In 1859, Davidson donated land for a parsonage. Mount Wesley had a separate wooden building and possibly even a schoolhouse set aside for slaves to worship. If true, this proved an ideal locale for slaves to congregate, share news, and engage in fellowship. Today the church is known as Davidsonville Methodist and is located at 819 Central Avenue.\n\nThomas Davidson died on September 24, 1868. He was sixty-seven years old. It is reported that the cause of death was an accidental shooting near the South River. Davidson was said to be duck hunting with close family or friends. After his passing, the community mourned the loss of a \"man of great worth, of incompatible integrity, a friend of the government & humanity, a thorough Methodist and an ardent Christian.\" Three months after his death, the possessions in his house alone were appraised at $6,505.35.\n\nReturn to Introductory Page\n\nThis web site is presented for reference purposes under the doctrine of fair use.
