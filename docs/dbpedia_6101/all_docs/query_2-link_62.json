        "text": "Comedian Tommy Davidson says he can view the world through the prism of black and white because he was raised by a white family.\n\nThe “In Living Color” star was discovered by Barbara Jean Davidson, a white woman when she spied a toddler’s foot poking out from behind a tire in a pile of garbage in Greenville, Miss., who then went on to adopt him.\n\nDavidson, 56, writes in his upcoming memoir, “Living in Color” that he had no idea who his birth mother, Tommie Gene, was or if she was even alive until he was nearly 33 when his adoptive mother, who worked at HUD, tracked her down and made contact without checking with the comic first.\n\nThe call came when he was on set of “Woo” opposite Jada Pinkett Smith. After the conversation, Davidson confided in Pinkett Smith what had just happened and she kindly announced to the crew that there would be no more rehearsals that day, sending Davidson back to his hotel to process the life-changing news.\n\nAlthough he wept tears of joy and sadness, the “Strictly Business” star felt he wasn’t ready to deal with his birth mother just yet and didn’t connect with her for several months.\n\nIn 1998, Davidson was performing in Wisconsin, where she lived, and invited her and her family to the show. He calls the reunion “an out-of-body experience,” but found it difficult to “acknowledge her as my mother.”\n\nHe learned that Gene already had three other children before him and was struggling with addiction. She managed to turn her life around and now works as a minister traveling around the country giving sermons. After some intense conversations, Davidson says he was able to forgive her.\n\n“Because I realized that she didn’t abandon me on purpose,” he writes. “She had no control over what she was doing … What I learned was that a person can do the most awful thing imaginable — abandon her child — and still heal herself … Forgiveness can be powerful.”\n\n“Living In Color” hits bookstores on Jan. 28."
