Gibbs has served as Time’s deputy managing editor since 2011 and has written more cover stories—174 in total—for the magazine than anyone else in its history.

Gibbs will take over for Richard Stengel, who was selected to serve as undersecretary for public diplomacy and public affairs at the State Department.
