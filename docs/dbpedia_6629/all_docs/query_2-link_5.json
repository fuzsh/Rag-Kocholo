        "text": "As writer, editor, and ultimately Editor in Chief of one of the world’s most trusted news magazines, Nancy Gibbs has spent more than 30 years exploring the events that shape our social and political life. She was the first woman to hold the position of Editor in Chief at TIME and remains an Editor at Large. She is currently the Edward R. Murrow Professor of Practice and Director of the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government. Under her leadership, TIME accelerated its transformation from a weekly print magazine to a global, 24/7 digital news operation. As the most published writer in TIME’s near-100 year history and a bestselling presidential historian, she has developed an unparalleled sense of the changing national conversation.\n\nShe is the co-author, with Michael Duffy, of two best-selling presidential histories: The President’s Club: Inside the World’s Most Exclusive Fraternity (2012), which spent 30 weeks on the New York Times best seller list, and The Preacher and the Presidents: Billy Graham in the White House (2007). Her columns now appear in the Washington Post as well as TIME, and she has been a frequent guest on radio and TV news shows, including Meet the Press, CBS This Morning, PBS Newshour, Morning Joe, World News Tonight, This Week, and the Today Show. Politico has called her “The Poet Laureate of Presidents” and the Chicago Tribune named her one of the Top Ten Magazine writers in the country. She has interviewed five U.S. presidents; numerous US political leaders, world leaders, and business leaders.\n\nGibbs has lectured extensively on the press and the American presidency, including at the Bush, Reagan, Carter, Johnson and Truman libraries, the Aspen Institute, the Dallas World Affairs Club, the Commonwealth Club, the National Archives and Harvard Kennedy School. Gibbs has shown a unique ability to look beyond our increasingly tribal divisions to explore what we share in common and what that means for our future.\n\nGibbs has twice served as the Ferris Professor of Journalism at Princeton, teaching a seminar on politics and the press. In addition to the National Magazine Award, she is a recipient of the Matrix award, the Society of Professional Journalists Hall of Fame, the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Newswomen’s Club of New York, Folio’s Top Women in Media, and numerous other journalism honors."
