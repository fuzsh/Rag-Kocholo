        "text": "It's time for change at Time.\n\nThe magazine's Editor-in-Chief Nancy Gibbs -- the first woman to lead the magazine -- will leave at the end of the year.\n\nGibbs, who joined Time 32 years ago as a fact-checker, has spent four years as editor-in-chief and also the last two as editorial director of Time Inc.’s News Group, which includes Time, Fortune, Money, Time for Kids and Time Health.\n\nShe will step down from her top roles today, but will remain until the year's end to help with the transition. Time Inc. expects to announce a successor soon.\n\n“I’m grateful for every single day I’ve spent at Time, but it’s time for another chapter,” Gibbs said in a statement. “I am so proud of what we have accomplished together, and I know that this brilliant, talented staff will take Time to new heights. No one is more excited than I to see what they will do next.”\n\nIn recent years, Time Inc. -- along with most of the industry -- has faced declining circulation and print ad sales. Earlier this year, the company entertained purchase offers, but decided to remain on its own.\n\nUnder Gibbs' oversight, Time grew its digital audience and its video content offerings to 100 million, the publisher says. “Nancy successfully ushered Time into a new era, meeting the demands of growing digital and mobile audiences, as well as introducing the brand to new audiences while building on its tradition of excellent journalism,” said Time Inc. President and CEO Rich Battista in a statement. “She is leaving Time in a strong position, with the biggest audience in its history and more innovations ahead.”\n\nBorn and raised in New York City, Gibbs, who is 57, graduated summa cum laude from Yale, with honors in history. She has a degree in politics and philosophy from Oxford, where she was also a Marshall scholar.\n\nBefore her senior management rules, Gibbs held other jobs including writer, lead writer, and essayist. She has also co-authored two books with Michael Duffy, Time's deputy managing editor: The President’s Club: Inside the World's Most Exclusive Fraternity (2012) and The Preacher and the Presidents: Billy Graham in the White House (2007).\n\nGibbs told USA TODAY she does not plan to retire. \"I would love to go back to writing. That’s how I spent most of my career,\" she said in an interview Tuesday. \"I loved teaching. There are a lot of issues I care deeply about where I would like to figure out if there’s a way I can make a contribution. What I am looking forward to in the next few months is actually having the time and the space to do some exploring, even as I help here making sure this is the smoothest transition on this end.\"\n\nIn a memo to the staff, Gibbs hailed its talent and teamwork. \"Time’s culture of collaboration has made it the privilege of my life to work here. I found some of my greatest teachers and my best friends—and as it turned out, my husband (Waits May) who is all three.\" May was one of Time's first digital managers from 1993-2000 and a news desk editor prior to that.\n\n\"Time has thrived in a state of constant change, and so it's part of its life cycle that the time to change has come again,\" Gibbs said. \"As of today, I will step down as Editor-in-Chief, but I will remain to help in the coming months with the next reinvention and support the immensely important work you all do.\"\n\nMore: Time Inc. opts not to sell\n\nMore: 'Time' launches new Time Health brand and online news hub"
