        "text": "Time editor in chief Nancy Gibbs, who rose through the ranks over three decades from her start as a fact checker to become the first female top editor of the century-old publication, is stepping down. “I’ve loved every day of this, but there’s a time for everything,” Gibbs told me during an interview Tuesday morning at the lower Manhattan headquarters of parent company Time Inc. “It’s time for me to figure out what I’m gonna do next.”\n\nGibbs, 57, has spent her entire career at the magazine. She started fresh out of an Oxford master’s program in 1985, and came up alongside other name brands who occupied the editor’s chair, including Walter Isaacson, Jim Kelly, and Rick Stengel. Gibbs has written more cover stories than any other writer in the magazine’s history. “I think it’s always good to have an editor who has performed every trick in the playbook,” Isaacson told me when I profiled Gibbs in 2013.\n\nThe newsmagazines have been in a prolonged twilight. But, more than her predecessors, Gibbs has finally had to enforce the shotgun marriage between the publication’s print and Web-based newsrooms, as Time struggled to adapt to the rapidly evolving media landscape. Amidst the turmoil, she’s had some success. Over the past eight months in particular, thanks to a series of Donald Trump interviews and cover stories, Time has recalled some of the power and glory it enjoyed during the golden age of newsweeklies—the magazine apparently looms so large in Trump’s imagination that a fabricated Trump cover was found to be hanging in at least five of the 45th president’s golf resorts.\n\nGibbs plans to stay on through the end of the year to help with the transition. There’s no word yet on her successor, and Gibbs declined to comment on the matter beyond confirming that conversations have begun and that she will weigh in on the appointment. Edward Felsenthal, Time’s digital director, is a possible contender.\n\nGibbs is thinking about her next book and plans to continue to write for Time on occasion. Beyond that, she told me, “I’ve been thinking, are there places I could go and things I could do to address the challenges that are facing us as a country?” She said the decision to step down was her own, and that she informed Time Inc. management toward the end of the summer that she thought it was “time to figure out a transition.”\n\nGibbs is leaving the company amid a period of tumult that’s become familiar in recent years. Time Inc. recently implemented its latest round of cuts after rejecting several sale overtures that had temporarily driven up the company’s flagging stock price. The company is at work on a turnaround plan, but its quarterly financial performance remains poor."
