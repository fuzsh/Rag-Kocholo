        "text": "TIME Editor Nancy Gibbs will deliver a public lecture on ’Our tools, our brains, our souls: the transformations of technology’ during her visit to New Zealand as the 2015 John F. Kennedy Memorial Fellow.\n\nOUR TOOLS, OUR BRAINS, OUR SOULS: THE TRANSFORMATIONS OF TECHNOLOGY\n\nThis event is fully subscribed\n\nAll through human history, we have acquired tools before we fully understood their power. Nowhere is this more true than the digital tools that have changed everything about how we live, work, play, learn, shop, vote, parent. In the next five years, the amount of digital data will grow to 44 trillion gigabytes; more than a billion smartphones were sold last year. The promise of this technology is limitless, for growth, health, education, communication; but the changes are coming so fast that it is hard to step back and consider whether it is true that the Internet “democratizes the good and disrupts the bad.” How do we as families, communities, societies, monitor the impact of technologies that are so powerful and so deeply embedded in our daily lives?\n\nThe MC will be Matt Nippert, Fulbright alumni and award winning journalist.\n\nAbout TIME editor Nancy Gibbs\n\nNancy Gibbs is an editor of TIME, which has 50 million readers worldwide. She oversees the domestic, international and tablet editions of the magazine, TIME.com, TIME mobile and TIME for Kids. Gibbs was named TIME’s 17th managing editor on September 17, 2013. She is the first woman to hold the position.\n\nGibbs has a long history at TIME, serving most recently as deputy managing editor, where she oversaw TIME’s transition to a fully digital newsroom and led a working group to develop the framework for TIME.com’s mobile-based relaunch this fall.\n\nGibbs is one of the most published writers in the history of TIME, having been an essayist and lead writer on virtually every major news event of the past two decades, including four presidential campaigns and the September 11 attacks.\n\nShe is the co-author, along with TIME’s Michael Duffy, of two best-selling presidential histories: “The President’s Club: Inside the World’s Most Exclusive Fraternity” (2012), which spent 30 weeks on the New York Times Bestseller list, and “The Preacher and the Presidents: Billy Graham in the White House” (2007). She has written more cover stories for TIME than any other writer in its history and won the National Magazine Award for her cover story of TIME’s black-bordered September 11, 2001 special issue.\n\nGibbs was born and raised in New York City. She graduated from Yale summa cum laude, with honors in history, and has a degree in politics and philosophy from Oxford, where she was a Marshall scholar.\n\nShe joined TIME as a fact checker in 1985 and worked as a writer and editor before holding senior management positions. She has twice served as the Ferris Professor at Princeton, where she taught a seminar on politics and the press.\n\nShe lives in Westchester County, New York, with her husband, and they have two daughters.\n\nAbout the John F. Kennedy Memorial Fellowship\n\nThe John F Kennedy Memorial Fellowship was created following the death of President John F. Kennedy, for the purpose of bringing eminent Americans to New Zealand for speaking and teaching engagements in honour of the late President.\n\nThe Fellowship is administered by Fulbright New Zealand, and executed in partnership with the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs & Trade and the Embassy of the United States of America, Wellington."
