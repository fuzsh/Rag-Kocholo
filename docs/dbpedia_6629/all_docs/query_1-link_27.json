        "text": "To: Time Inc. Employees\n\nFrom: John Huey and Richard Stengel\n\nRe: Staff Announcement\n\nOn the recommendation of Rick Stengel, I am very pleased to announce that Michael Elliott is the new deputy managing editor of TIME and Nancy Gibbs is TIME's new executive editor. I have long admired Michael's range of skills which run broad and deep, and Nancy, as we all know, is the very embodiment of the TIME brand. It is great to have her take a senior role in TIME's management team. But I will defer to Rick to tell the story:\n\nMike Elliott is already number two on the masthead as international editor, but he is now going to play a much larger role on the domestic magazine and be my day-to-day deputy. Mike has served in his present capacity since 2005, when he was based in Hong Kong before I asked him to come back to the U.S. in 2006. (I had nothing to do with him becoming a U.S. citizen that year, though). In addition to his enormous experience in international coverage, Mike first came to the U.S. as a journalist in 1986 for The Economist to cover American politics and economics. Later, he became their Washington bureau chief and the first author of the magazine's Lexington column about Washington politics. Mike also served as diplomatic editor of Newsweek and editor of Newsweek International. From writing to editing to conceiving covers, Mike is a world-class journalist and the consummate magazine professional, and to have his voice and experience in the domestic magazine will be enormously valuable.\n\nNo one personifies TIME more than Nancy Gibbs. From her matchless prose (Politico called her \"the poet laureate of presidents\") to her superb ideas to her unique understanding of our readers, she has more than anyone else created the modern DNA of TIME. Nancy has written more cover stories than anyone in TIME history, a truly remarkable accomplishment and a record that will certainly never be broken. Rather than recite her greatest hits (which are too numerous to mention), I'll mention only one, her moving and unforgettable essay in the special black-bordered 9/11 issue which won the National Magazine Award that year. As a journalist, Nancy is timely and timeless: she has been the lead writer on almost every major news event from Oklahoma City to Hurricane Katrina to the drama of presidential election nights, but she is also the regular author of essays that deal with the most enduring of values and ideas--essays that are routinely anthologized. Her writing is a gift, and her editing is a gift to other writers. Now, Nancy is taking a managerial role in which she will be focused on staff development, generating ideas and covers, editing and assigning stories--and helping guide TIME into the future. There's no one better to do that than Nancy Gibbs.\n\nCongratulations to Mike and Nancy.\n\nJ.H. R.S."
