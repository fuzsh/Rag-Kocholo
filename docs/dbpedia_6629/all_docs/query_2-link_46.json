        "text": "For the first time in its 90-year history, Time magazine will have a woman in the top editor’s job.\n\nNancy Gibbs, 53, who has been at the magazine since 1985 and has authored major cover stories on politics, terrorism and culture, was officially named the new managing editor on Tuesday.\n\nShe replaces Rick Stengel, 58, who is expected to take a State Department position as under secretary for public diplomacy and public affairs after seven years running Time.\n\nHis appointment — announced by the White House Tuesday — requires Senate confirmation.\n\nStengel’s been on the 34th floor of Time Inc. and out of the day-to-day operations of the magazine since mid-July, when he first revealed to Time Inc. Editor-in-Chief Martha Nelson that he was considering going for the job.\n\n“It was imperative to me to get Rick off the magazine immediately to avoid any conflict of interest or appearance of a conflict of interest,” Nelson said.\n\nJay Carney, another Time alum, is President Obama’s chief spokesman.\n\nGibbs’ appointment was widely expected as far back as two years ago, when Stengel named her his deputy managing editor.\n\n“Obviously, I’m very gratified by the appointment,” said Gibbs of her official elevation.\n\nShe said being the first woman to hold the job would not color how she covered the world.\n\n“I doubt it will have any influence on what I cover,” she said. “I’m very mindful that Time is a very big, very global brand and I hope to make it an even bigger global brand.”\n\nThe move drew praise from one of Gibbs’ predecessors, Walter Isaacson, the Steve Jobs biographer who is currently running the Aspen Institute think tank.\n\n“This is not only an historic choice, it is also a brilliant one,” said Isaacson. “No editor knows better than Nancy how to connect with us about the way we live, the values we hold, and the issues we wrestle with. Such connectivity is at the core of 21st-century journalism in all of its forms.”\n\nGibbs, who penned more cover stories than any other writer in Time history, is the author of, “The Presidents Club: Inside the World’s Most Exclusive Fraternity.”\n\nGibbs faces deep challenges as the digital world has eroded the value of newsweeklies.\n\nTime’s annual profit approached $100 million in 1998, when it celebrated its star-studded 75th anniversary party at Radio City Music Hall. By last year, profit was estimated at just $10 million.\n\nGibbs also must work to dispel the notion that Time has a print-first mentality, which has demoralized the Web side in recent years.\n\n“I’ve heard the criticism, but I think it is changing,” Gibbs said. “There are no longer two separate staffs. That’s the only way this can work.”\n\nThe website relaunch, being designed by Big Human, is expected in November."
