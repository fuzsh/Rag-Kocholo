        "text": "Nancy Gibbs has been named the Managing Editor at Time Magazine, the first woman to hold that position in the 90 year history of the publication.\n\nShe succeeds Richard Stengel, who held the position for seven years. Gibbs was formerly his deputy but had filled in on occasion for him. She began overseeing covers of the magazine in early August. Gibbs started working for Time Magazine as a fact checker 28 years ago. She’s written more cover stories for the magazine than any other writer in its history.\n\nIn a phone interview with The New York Times, Gibbs mentioned that she felt her writing skills would help Time across all of its media–both digital and print. She also spoke to Time’s growing digital influence and how that her role as editor would be more “widely spread” than previous editors due to online, tablet and print mediums.\n\nGibbs also commented on the excitement of her colleagues about her history making new role.\n\nThis is a historic institution and there is something that excites people about seeing a woman run it for the first time."
