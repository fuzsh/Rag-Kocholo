        "text": "No matter how much technology changes, no matter how much the political environment changes, the human need for stories is every bit as powerful as the need for food and water and sleep.\n\nStorytelling as an important service and art form is always going to be important. Having more ways to tell a great story, having more platforms for storytelling is terrific.\n\nWhat print allows you to do is to have a contract with your reader that they’re willing to spend some time with you.\n\nEverything seems to be additional, rather than a replacement. That doesn’t worry me. I love print, but I also love what we’re finding we’re able to do on these other platforms as well.\n\nIf you want to have a much more manageable, edited and curated account of things that really matter and are interesting and surprising and provocative to think about, then the magazine is a very efficient vehicle for that.\n\nThis whole (change) process was launched and pursued completely independently of anything Newsweek was doing.\n\nThis is a fantastic time to be in journalism and the changes in technology only make it better."
