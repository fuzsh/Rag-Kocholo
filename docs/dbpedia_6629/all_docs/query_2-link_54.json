One study asked participants to edit their own summary of a short article they were provided. Eighty-three percent added words.\n\nIf you think your reader – colleague, donor, client – is busy then you owe it to yourself and them to make it shorter. Another study (from authors with a very creative book cover shown below) sent two survey invitation emails; one was 127 words, the other 49. The latter got a 78% higher response rate.\n\nWhy is that? The people who got the longer email incorrectly assumed the survey would be longer.\n\nA lot of lengthy writing doesn’t get rea d at all because we rightly assume it will take more time while discounting the possible positives – e.g., we learn more, we feel more connected. And even if the lengthier tomes get started, people often bail.\n\nThis isn’t a recommendation to write shorter, just better.\n\nAnd follow Nancy’s advice, make every word, sentence and paragraph earn it. And know that your bias is probably longer and to fight against that.\n\nShort, medium or long copy is never a (good) goal. Getting and keeping the reader’s attention is what matters.\n\nKevin"
