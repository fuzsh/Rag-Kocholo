        "text": "After 32 years, Time’s Nancy Gibbs is calling it quits.\n\nGibbs, who has held the editor-in-chief title at Time magazine for the past four years, will step down from the top job at the newsweekly immediately, Time Inc. announced, hours after Media Ink called for comment on exit rumors.\n\nGibbs, who will remain editorial director of Time Inc. News Group through the end of the year, could not be reached for comment at press time. She was hosting a panel discussion downtown on Tuesday night tied to the current Time “Firsts” issue — with Hillary Clinton and other prominent women on 12 different covers.\n\nGibbs is a best-selling author who has the most Time cover stories — more than 100 — of any writer in its 94-year history. The first female editor of the newsweekly, Gibbs has overseen Time during a particularly tumultuous period. While she has aggressively pushed Time.com, the core print product has seen profits wither to nothing.\n\nTime’s digital traffic peaked at 41.2 million in January in the wake of President Trump’s election — with the election of Donald Trump in January, but was down almost 20 percent, to 33 million, as of July, according to comScore.\n\nArchrival Newsweek stopped putting out a print edition altogether — then was sold to new owners at IBT Media, which revived a small press run weekly to augment the digital operation.\n\nUS News & World Report, once a formidable No. 3 in the category, long ago skipped the weekly run in favor of monthly specials highlighting things like best colleges and best hospitals.\n\nDuring Gibbs’ reign at the top, the parent company, Time Inc., in 2014, spun itself off from Time Warner and then, earlier this year, went through a reluctant effort to entertain offers to sell itself. That effort earlier this year saw the publisher rebuff the interest of Edgar Bronfman Jr. and others — before deciding to go it alone.\n\nChief Executive Rich Battista has made a major push into video and digital products, but the future still looks uncertain. Time said it expects profits to be flat for several more years. While legacy print products are attracting strong digital audiences, the revenue has not been enough to offset the decline in print advertising so far.\n\nThe departure of Gibbs, a 57-year-old native New Yorker, will mark another dramatic exit of a storied magazine editor.\n\nOn Sept. 7, Condé Nast announced that Graydon Carter was leaving as editor of Vanity Fair at year end after 25 years leading the monthly. On Monday, Elle Editor-in-Chief Robbie Myers told her staff she was exiting the fashion title after 17 years.\n\nIn a memo to her staff, Gibbs said, “Time has thrived in a state of constant change. And so it is part of its life cycle that the time for change has come again.”\n\n“As of today,” she wrote in the memo, parts of which were read to Media Ink, “I will step down as editor-in-chief but I will remain In the coming months with the next reinvention to support the immensely important work you all do.”\n\nA new E-i-C is expected to be named shortly, Battista and Chief Content Officer Alan Murray said in a separate memo."
