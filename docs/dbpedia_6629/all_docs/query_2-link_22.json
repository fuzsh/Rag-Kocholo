Now, it is one of the most uncertain.\n\nThis week Nancy Gibbs wasnamed the new managing editor of Time magazine, replacing longtime editor Richard Stengel as he moves on to a job at the State Department. Gibbs becomes the first woman to lead the editorial side of the newsweekly during its 90-year history. In the meantime, the magazine’s staffers—along with their colleagues at the other glossy publications in the Time Inc.portfolio, including People, Sports Illustrated, and Fortune—continue to exist in a uneasy state of limbo, as they wait … and then … wait some more to be spun off from a corporate parent that no longer wants them."
