        "text": "Nancy Gibbs, managing editor of TIME magazine, and Michael Duffy, deputy managing editor, will present the University of New England’s 2015 George and Barbara Bush Distinguished Lecture, which will take place on September 24 at 5 p.m. in the Harold Alfond Forum on UNE’s Biddeford Campus.\n\nThe lecture, titled “The Presidents Club: Inside the World’s Most Exclusive Fraternity,” is based on Gibbs’ and Duffy’s book with the same title, which spent 30 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list. It was the second of Gibbs’ and Duffy’s best-selling presidential histories, following The Preacher and the Presidents: Billy Graham in the White House (2007).\n\nGibbs is the first woman to hold the position of managing editor of TIME. She oversees the domestic, international and tablet editions of the magazine, TIME.com, TIME mobile and TIME for Kids.\n\nOne of the most published writers in the history of the magazine, she has been an essayist and lead writer on virtually every major news event of the past two decades, including four presidential campaigns and the September 11 attacks, winning the National Magazine Award for her cover story of TIME’s black-bordered September 11, 2001 special issue.\n\nGibbs was born and raised in New York City. She graduated from Yale summa cum laude, with honors in history, and has a degree in politics and philosophy from Oxford, where she was a Marshall scholar. She has twice served as the Ferris Professor at Princeton, where she taught a seminar on politics and the press.\n\nMichael Duffy has worked at TIME for 30 years covering the Pentagon, the Congress, the White House, national politics and national security. He has twice served as the magazine's Washington bureau chief.\n\nHe has written more than 50 TIME cover stories and won the Gerald R. Ford Award for reporting both on the White House (1994) and defense and national security (2005). With a team from TIME, he has shared in the Joan Shorenstein Barone Prize for Investigative Journalism awarded by the Kennedy School of Government in 1997.\n\nHe has been a Ferris Professor of Journalism at Princeton University and has appeared regularly on PBS’s “Washington Week in Review” for the past 15 years.\n\nBorn and raised in Columbus, Ohio, Duffy graduated from Oberlin College in 1980.\n\nGibbs and Duffy will give the sixth lecture in the George and Barbara Bush Distinguished Lecture Series, an annual event honoring the legacy of President and Mrs. Bush as political and community leaders. Since its inception in 2010, the series has brought to UNE Christopher Buckley, former vice-presidential speechwriter for George H.W. Bush; Her Highness Sheikha Moza bint Nasser of Qatar; Lieutenant General Brent Scowcroft; former White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card; and NBC News correspondent and author Jenna Bush.\n\nThe lecture is free and open to the public."
