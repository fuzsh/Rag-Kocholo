        "text": "Michael Duffy, a veteran journalist who is the executive editor and Washington bureau chief for TIME Magazine, will present Carleton College’s weekly convocation on Friday, Sept. 28 at 10:50 a.m. in the Skinner Memorial Chapel. Duffy will speak about his decades of experience covering national politics and his current position overseeing TIME’s coverage of national affairs. Convocation is free and open to the public; the addresses are also streamed live online and available for on-demand viewing after the event.\n\nDuffy joined TIME in 1985 as its Pentagon correspondent and has since written over 50 stories featured on the magazine’s cover. He has served off and on as Washington bureau chief since 1997. Duffy’s work has covered Congress and the White House as well as national security issues. An Ohio native and Oberlin College alumnus, Duffy worked as a staff writer at Defense Week magazine before taking the job at TIME.\n\nDuffy has coauthored two books with Nancy Gibbs, TIME’s deputy managing editor: The Preacher and the Presidents: Billy Graham in the White House (Center Street, 2007), which chronicles the relationship between various presidents and prominent evangelist Billy Graham, and The Presidents Club: Inside the World’s Most Exclusive Fraternity (Simon and Schuster, 2012), which looks at the personal relationships between the men who have held the presidency in modern history.\n\nBeyond his career at TIME, Duffy served as a Ferris Professor of Journalism at Princeton University from 2006 to 2007. He is also a regular panelist on PBS’s Washington Week in Review. Duffy has won Gerald R. Ford Journalism Reporting Prizes on two separate occasions: in 1994 for reporting on the presidency and in 2003 for reporting on national defense. Along with a team from TIME, he shared in the Joan Shorenstein Barone Prize for Investigative Journalism, awarded in 1997 by Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government.\n\nFor more information about this event, including disability accommodations, contact the Carleton College Office of College Relations at (507) 222-4308. Skinner Memorial Chapel is located on First Street between College and Winona Streets in Northfield."
