        "text": "Time magazine has a new top editor: Nancy Gibbs, a 28-year veteran of the title. She was named to the job of managing editor on Tuesday, succeeding Richard Stengel, who's leaving to join the State Department as under secretary for public diplomacy and public affairs.\n\nWith a celebratory champagne pour going on outside her office, Gibbs, who becomes the first woman to hold the top job in Time's 90-year history, took a few minutes to chat.\n\nFORBES: Congratulations! Is it surprising we've had a woman as executive editor of the New York Times and two women as anchors of the network evening newscasts before a woman was named managing editor of Time?\n\nNANCY GIBBS: I like the fact that glass ceilings are breaking all over. Probably very soon it won't even be something anyone notices when you have a woman taking over one of these jobs. I'm just excited to be the editor, although when my daughters heard the news and told me how proud it made them, that felt great.\n\nYou've written more cover stories than anyone else in the history of Time. What have been the most memorable?\n\nThe one I always remember, and I hope there'll never be any cause to repeat it, was the 9/11 story. We basically decided to stop the presses and do a whole special issue in about 24 hours, and the entire staff together reported the story. That was probably the one that stands out for me because I heard from so many people afterward how much it meant to them, how they saved it, kept it with the family papers as an important document.\n\nAs you probably know, I've written a lot about the presidency, so it's obviously exciting when you get to interview a president and write about it. I will say the thing that gives me the most street cred with my kids is when I got to interview J.K. Rowling and put her on the cover.\n\nIt's hard for me to pick a favorite. I've been grateful that Time's reach and mandate is so broad, anything you're interested in you can usually write about.\n\nWhen you came to Time, it was one of three huge newsmagazines, along with Newsweek and U.S. News & World Report. Now it's basically in a category of its own. Is that a good thing or a bad thing?\n\nIt's been a long time since we've even really thought about our competitive set that way. I feel like my competition is everything else that's competing for people's attention, not just other print magazines, newspapers and cable. It's your kid's report card and the games you want to play, all the things that compete for people's time.\n\nEven just within the news landscape, we've viewed our competition as being on every platform for a long time. The fun thing about that is I don't think if you'd told an editor of Time back when I started here that they'd not only be winning print awards but an Emmy award -- that we're operating in media that weren't part of our purview in the early days -- that's been the most exciting thing. We get to tell stories in more ways. We really get to be everywhere.\n\nIf Time is everywhere and competes with everything, what's the irreducible core? What is a newsweekly in the year 2013?\n\nThere was an interesting poll I saw last winter: Time was the most trusted news organization there is. That think, is the core. They trust us to do the work, to not be sensational, to not be glib or cynical. At the core they trust us to be respectful of them and their time and give them the news they most need in a way that most works for them. In a way, that's what Time has always been. Our value is in our name. We think Time is valuable. We respect their time. The fact that there's so much information out there now makes it that much harder to make sense of it. The need for what we do is greater than ever in our history. I'm the first editor who will take over with my digital audience bigger than my print audience.\n\nWhat does the coming spinoff of Time Inc. from Time Warner mean for Time magazine?\n\nI know what we hope it means. [New Time Inc. CEO] Joe Ripp appeared in my doorway I think the third day he was here on the job and it was to tell me both how important Time is to him personally and how important it s to his company. His message to me is the one he's telling all of us and telling his investors, which is we are now looking for opportunities to grow -- to take these extraordinary properties and figure out what are the news businesses we can launch now that we're going to have an opportunity to invest for the future. I have a lot of people here with ideas, but there hasn't really been a way to take those ideas and torture test them and figure out where to invest. Joe's been very clear that he wants invest in a way we couldn't when he had to send all our free cash flow to Time Warner.\n\nHave you gotten any advice from Rick Stengel or any of your other predecessors?\n\nIt's been great. I'm obviously still friends with Walter and Jim and all of them. They're hugely supportive, very excited. They all tease me a little because this is not exactly the path I'd chartered, but they've been great great inspirations to me. I'm hugely excited to take over a place that is as strong as it is because of the way they built it."
