        "text": "TIME magazine editors Nancy Gibbs and Michael Duffy was at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library on Tuesday, May 8 to discuss and sign copies of their book*, The Presidents Club: Inside the World’s Most Exclusive Fraternity.\n\nThe Presidents Club reveals the secret history of the private relationships among the last 13 presidents, exploring the backroom deals, rescue missions, secret alliances and bitter rivalries of the men who served as commander in chief.\n\n“Political junkies, historians, psychologists and main street citizens will find the tales of friendship, envy, conspiracy, competition and common cause irresistible.” – Tom Brokaw\n\nThe Presidents Club demonstrates how the Club has changed the course of history. Headlines include: After President Kennedy was shot, President Eisenhower came to the White House and wrote in longhand what President Johnson should say to a joint session of Congress; secret pointers that President Reagan gave President Clinton, including how to salute properly; President Nixon and President Johnson blackmailed one another; President Truman rescued President Hoover from the political graveyard and in the process, helped save Europe from starvation; and more."
