        "text": "The USC Annenberg Center on Communication Leadership & Policy (CCLP) is pleased to welcome Nancy Gibbs, the former Editor-in-Chief of TIME MAGAZINE, as a Senior Fellow. After graduating from Yale (summa cum laude), Gibbs was a Marshall Scholar at Oxford where she studied Politics, Philosophy and Economics.\n\nDuring her remarkable career at Time, she covered four presidential campaigns and wrote more than 175 cover stories, winning a National Magazine Award for her work on the special issue on the September 11 attacks. Her books include two best-selling presidential histories: “The President’s Club: Inside the World’s Most Exclusive Fraternity” (2012), which spent 30 weeks on the New York Times Bestseller list, and “The Preacher and the Presidents: Billy Graham in the White House” (2007). She is currently the visiting Edward R. Murrow Professor of Press, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government.\n\n“We are honored that Nancy will be joining us and a cohort of other outstanding reporters and scholars as a Senior Fellow,” CCLP Director Geoffrey Cowan said. “She will be an inspiration to students when we are lucky enough to have her in Los Angeles, and we look forward to having her wisdom as we look at issues involving the future of journalism, public discourse in America and the world, and Women in Communication Leadership.”"
