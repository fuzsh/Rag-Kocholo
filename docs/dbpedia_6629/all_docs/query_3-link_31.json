        "text": "13 September 2017\n\nNancy Gibbs steps down as editor-in-chief of Time\n\nGibbs will remain with the company until the end of 2017 as editorial director of Time Inc.’s News Group, a title she has held in addition to editor-in-chief of Time since 2016. Time Inc. expects to announce a successor soon.\n\n“I’m grateful for every single day I’ve spent at Time, but it’s time for another chapter,” said Gibbs. “I am so proud of what we have accomplished together, and I know that this brilliant, talented staff will take Time to new heights. No one is more excited than I to see what they will do next.”\n\n“Nancy successfully ushered Time into a new era, meeting the demands of growing digital and mobile audiences, as well as introducing the brand to new audiences while building on its tradition of excellent journalism,” said Rich Battista, Time Inc. president and CEO. “She is one of the most outstanding journalists in the business, and her distinctive voice has helped to define Time for more than three decades. She led coverage of so many major events—including four presidential elections—boldly and with integrity. She is leaving Time in a strong position, with the biggest audience in its history and more innovations ahead.”\n\n“For almost as long as I’ve been reading Time, Nancy has defined its unique and powerful voice. Both as editor-in-chief and, before that, as writer nonpareil, Nancy has had a unique ability to tell the story of our nation—and our world—in a comprehensive, compelling and compassionate way,” said Time Inc. chief content officer Alan Murray. “On top of that, she has been extraordinarily successful in guiding Time’s transition to new platforms, building a digital audience that has reached more than 60 million visitors worldwide—nearly 40 per cent of them millennials.”\n\nGibbs took on leadership of Time in September 2013. She established a new reporting structure to merge the print and digital newsrooms into one and enhanced collaboration between the brand’s business and editorial sides, as well as with other Time Inc. titles. She is the first woman to lead Time.\n\nTime Inc. is a member of FIPP.\n\nMore like this\n\nTime Inc. launches The Pretty, a stand-alone social video brand all about beauty\n\nTime Inc. study reveals consumers are open to custom content as a way for brands to connect\n\nFIPP Board appoints directors from Axel Springer SE, Time Inc. and Vikatan Group\n\nNorman Pearlstine to retire from Time Inc."
