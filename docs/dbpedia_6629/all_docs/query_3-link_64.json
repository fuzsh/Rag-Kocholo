        "text": "In his book Chautauqua: A Center for Education, Religion and Arts in America, author Theodore Morrison presents a photo of the original 1876 staff of the Chautauqua Assembly Daily Herald. Among those seated in front of a building marked “Editorial Rooms – Assembly Herald” is the publication’s founder and editor, Theodore Flood.\n\nThe caption reads, “Anyone consulting the bound volumes of the Assembly Herald may well wonder how so much thoroughness and order emerged from these editorial quarters.”\n\nMuch has changed about Chautauqua’s newspaper in the 136 years it has been published — name, office, staff size and average age, tone, content and technology — but its mission has remained the same.\n\nThe final morning lecture of the 2012 Season offered Chautauquans a preview of the upcoming presidential election from two veteran journalists.\n\nNancy Gibbs and Michael Duffy, editors at Time magazine, inspired the Week Nine morning lecture theme of “The Presidents Club,” with their book of the same name.\n\nThe Time editors’ casual discussion covered everything from Mitt Romney’s wealth to the relationship between Bill Clinton and President Barack Obama.\n\nNancy Gibbs and Michael Duffy, co-authors of The Presidents Club and editors at Time, present the final morning lecture of the 2012 Season at 10:45 a.m. today in the Amphitheater.\n\nAs editors at one of the most notable weekly news magazines in the U.S., Duffy and Gibbs will lend their expertise on the upcoming political season for the Chautauqua audience.\n\nThe duo has worked together for 25 years, and Duffy has covered eight presidential campaigns.\n\nDuring the late 1960s, Michael Duffy and his Nebraska-born, Congregationalist mother were driving to Ohio from somewhere in the northeast, and they stopped by the Chautauqua Institution.\n\n“I recall peering through a fence as if at the Promised Land,” Duffy said. “I’m hoping to get a little closer to the action on this trip.”\n\nDuffy and co-writer Nancy Gibbs will present their book, The Presidents Club: Inside the World’s Most Exclusive Fraternity, the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle selection for Week Nine, at 3:30 p.m. today in the Hall of Philosophy.\n\nNo one understands what it is like to be president, except those who have held the position.\n\nThere is no other role like it.\n\n“The presidency, in their mind, is something of a collective that they all remain part of,” said Nancy Gibbs, co-author of The Presidents Club, during Monday’s morning lecture in the Amphitheater.\n\nThe former presidents have all offered one another their support. When Franklin D. Roosevelt died, Herbert Hoover told Harry Truman he had the right to call for any service Hoover could offer to the country. Dwight Eisenhower told Lyndon Johnson he would be there for him any time Johnson needed him. Richard Nixon told Ronald Reagan, “I am yours to command.”\n\n“It’s absolutely Chautauqua. It’s history. It’s biography. It’s interacting across boundaries. It’s political.”\n\nSherra Babcock, the director of the Department of Education, gushed about The Presidents Club, a book by Time editors Nancy Gibbs and Michael Duffy, which also shares the same name as the morning lecture platform theme — it’s not a coincidence.\n\nFour years ago, Gibbs told Institution President Tom Becker and Babcock that she and Duffy were working on a book about the “private side of the presidency.” Becker and Babcock agreed it would be a perfect morning lecture platform theme.\n\nAfter years of patience and hard work, Gibbs kicks off the week at 10:45 a.m. Monday in the Amphitheater by exploring the roadmap of The Presidents Club.\n\nWelcome to the opening of the closing week in the 2012 Chautauqua Season.\n\nSaturday evening and again Tuesday, the Chautauqua Symphony Orchestra will assume the stage in the Amphitheater for their final performances of the season. Those will be the 20th and 21st concerts of their season’s artistic programming. They have been extraordinary in every way. They have played for 17 different conductors and with a wide variety of soloists and choirs. They have supported dance and opera and served as faculty for the School of Music. At the conclusion of Saturday’s performance, you are invited to the back porch of the Amphitheater to help recognize and celebrate the more than 40 years of service to the CSO by its principal cellist, Chaim Zemach. Chaim and his wife, Hildegard, have contributed greatly to the life of this community. I hope you will take the time to express your thanks to these lovely Chautauquans.\n\nThe position of United States president is one that only those who have occupied the Oval Office can understand, meaning current and former presidents share a bond that transcends political boundaries.\n\nWith both major political parties on the cusp of nominating their candidates for the most important job in the U.S., Chautauqua Institution offers a week of 10:45 a.m. Amphitheater lectures exploring the complexities and burdens of the presidency, and the relationships between those who have held it.\n\nThe week theme takes its title from the book The Presidents Club: Inside the World’s Most Exclusive Fraternity, and attendees will hear from authors Nancy Gibbs and Michael Duffy, a pair of presidential historians and a pair of presidential daughters."
