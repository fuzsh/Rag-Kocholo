        "text": "Medium, the pro-am Web-publishing outfit founded by former Twitter C.E.O. Ev Williams, is bringing on a new editor to oversee its content strategy, and Time magazine has lost another editor as it begins a new chapter under the ownership of Meredith Corporation. Siobhan O’Connor, most recently executive editor at Time, left the newsweekly after nearly four years on January 17, and will begin a new job as Medium’s vice president of editorial on February 5, reporting directly to Williams and based in New York.\n\nMedium—best known as an online community where people (often well-known people like politicians, executives, and journalists) can self-publish op-eds, personal essays, and reportage, potentially attracting a large audience—has gone through various iterations since its founding in 2012. The most recent is a subscription play, to which Medium pivoted last year after an ad-based model proved difficult. Some outlets—The Awl, The Ringer, and Pacific Standard, among others—had even moved their content over to the platform, but subsequently pulled out. (Backchannel, a tech-oriented publication that debuted on Medium in 2014, is now owned by Condé Nast, the parent company of Vanity Fair’s Hive; an array of lesser-known, niche publications still host content exclusively on Medium, which also syndicates articles from big shots like The New York Times and The Economist.)\n\nO’Connor and a small team of editors will focus largely on doing stories and commissioning paid writers to build out Medium’s membership program, as well as finding the best stories from Medium’s user-base to promote. Medium has struggled with people not quite understanding exactly what it is. (A blog network? A platform? A publisher? All of the above?) Now, like many media companies, it wants to be a place that compels readers to open their wallets for digital journalism, so the idea is to generate professionally edited features for which people would be willing to pay $5 a month after a monthly stipend of three free articles runs out. (The user-generated stuff will remain free unless the creator decides to put it behind the metered paywall, as a way to be compensated based on the extent to which readers engage.) O’Connor was traveling this week so wasn’t able to get on the phone to tell me more, but a Medium representative said to expect a mix of essays and reported pieces on a broad range of topics that generally aren’t news-driven."
