About Nancy Gibbs

Nancy Gibbs is Deputy Managing Editor of TIME magazine, the number 2 editorial position, and co author with Michael Duffy of the New York Times bestseller The Preacher and the Presidents; Billy Graham in the White House. Named by the Chicago Tribune as one of the ten best magazine writers in the country, she is the author of more than 140 TIME cover stories and now writes the back essay page. She won the National Magazine Award for the black-bordered special issue on September 11, 2001, and was the lead TIME writer on virtually every major news event from Oklahoma City to Hurricane Katrina, as well as the last five presidential campaigns. When the news is quiet, she has focused on stories exploring the intersections of religion, values and politics: after the 2008 election, Politico.com described her as “the poet laureate of presidents.”

She graduated from Yale summa cum laude with honors in history, and has a degree in politics and philosophy from Oxford, where she was a Marshall scholar. Her writing is included in The Princeton Anthology of Writing, Best Political Writing 2005 and numerous writing textbooks. She has twice served as the Ferris Professor at Princeton, where she taught a seminar on Politics and the Press.

Gibbs is a frequent guest on radio and television talk shows, including the Today show, Good Morning America, the CBS Evening News, Charlie Rose, and has appeared as an essayist on the NewsHour on PBS.
