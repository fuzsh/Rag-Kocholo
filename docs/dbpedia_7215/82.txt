As revealed by co-creator Alan Martin Today, it appears that there is a new film adaptation of comic classic Tank Girl on the way.

We haven’t seen Tank Girl on the big screen since director Rachel Talalay’s film adaptation of the comic series back in 1995, which starred Lori Petty as the title character. It seems time for this fair lady to return to the spotlight, as Martin tweeted this morning: “Just heard that Margot Robbie’s company have optioned rights from MGM to make a new Tank Girl movie – now several months into development. We haven’t been contacted by any of the parties involved with the project, so not sure if there will be any input from the original creators.”

Robbie launched her production company LuckyChap Entertainment in 2014. Viewers will probably remember her as Harley Quinn in 2016’s Suicide Squad and the upcoming Birds of Prey, and she also appeared as Queen Elizabeth I in Mary Queen of Scots. The company has thus far produced I, Tonya, Terminal, Dreamland, and next year’s Birds of Prey. There is no word on whether or not Robbie plans on starring in the film.

Tank Girl is a 1995 American science fiction film directed by Rachel Talalay. Based on the British post-apocalyptic punk comic series of the same name by Alan Martin and Jamie Hewlett originally published in Deadline magazine, it chronicled the adventures of Tank Girl in a Mad Max-esque wasteland ⁠— though with more weapons of war and mutants. Although it was a financial failure, heavily panned, and even disowned by the original creators and director, it still developed a cult following and is noted for its feminist themes.

No other details are known about the upcoming Tank Girl film, but we’ll let you know if and when further news is announced.
