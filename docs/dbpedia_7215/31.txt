"Tank Girl" is a comic-based movie with the flashy pop style of a real comic book, but that's a mixed blessing. It's a comic book that takes an hour and three-quarters to read, for one thing. And its storytelling isn't moved forward by anything better than an occasional need to turn the page.

But "Tank Girl" may be sending out a dog-whistle signal to its own special constituency, fans of an androgynous punk heroine who's so underground she's almost buried. A bigger phenomenon in England than it is here, the "Tank Girl" comic strip celebrates beer-swigging insouciance and a taste for heavy metal, the kind found in military equipment this heroine likes to commandeer. "Feeling a little inadequate?" the movie's Tank Girl taunts, as she rides on the enormous gun of her beloved tank. "My God, the sheer size of it!" she says of a huge gun in another scene.

Since this is thoroughly tongue in cheek, "Tank Girl" has a likable brashness, even when breathless, pointless plotting threatens to eclipse the movie's charms. Chief among its strong points is Lori Petty, a buzz-cut fashion plate in a Prozac necklace, who brings the necessary gusto to Tank Girl's flippancy.

"Ugh, you are SO dead," Tank Girl says to a messy corpse. "It's been swell, but the swelling's gone down," she says, by way of farewell. "To the Bat-tank!" she cries, making another getaway. The film is loaded with winking references to pop landmarks from "Star Wars" to "The Wizard of Oz."
