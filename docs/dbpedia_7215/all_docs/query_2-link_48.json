        "text": "When the \"Jazz Singer\" was released in 1927, it brought a whole new world of sound to the movies. And with it came the challenge for screenwriters to create dialogue that could entertain and captivate their audiences. Words that perfectly capture a moment or tug on our heartstrings or just make us weak with laughter.\n\nGreat movie quotes, such as \"May the Force be with you\" from \"Star Wars\", do more than just enhance the movies they are in. They also have the power to take on a life of their own and become embedded within mainstream popular culture.\n\nSo while technology has radically transformed the way movies are made since the early days of the \"talkies\", the power of words and dialogue remains the same. Here’s an overview of some of the very best movie quotes across almost a century of movie making.\n\n150 Best Movie Quotes... Ever!\n\nWhat makes a great move quote is subjective but can be considered as the film dialogue and phrases that people remember. Quotes that find their way into popular culture and become instantly recognizable, even if people haven’t actually seen the film it’s taken from.\n\nA great starting point for any list of movie quotes is the selection put together by the American Film Institute to celebrate the organization’s centenary in 2005. They used a jury of 1,500 film artists and critics to vote for the top 100.\n\nThe Infoplease list revises and updates the AFI selection to include more recent movies and films made outside of America to bring the grand total to 150 best movie quotes of all time. The emphasis is on short and standalone quotes rather than lengthier speeches or passages of dialogue. It’s a list that covers every genre from cartoons to political dramas and stretches from the very first talkies of the 1920s to modern-day blockbusters.\n\n1. \"You're gonna need a bigger boat.\" — \"Jaws,\" 1975.\n\n2. \"Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.\" — \"Gone With the Wind,\" 1939.\n\nAt the end of the film, Clark Gable's character Rhett Butler is leaving his wife, Scarlett. Scarlett asks what she'll do with herself after he leaves — his response is this famously harsh goodbye as he walks off into the night.\n\n3. \"Hasta la vista, baby.\" — \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day,\" 1991.\n\n4. \"I feel the need — the need for speed!\" — \"Top Gun,\" 1986.\n\n5. “Chewie, we’re home.” — \"Star Wars: Episode VII,\" 2015.\n\n6. \"I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse.\" — \"The Godfather,\" 1972.\n\nDon Vito Corleone, played by Marlon Brando, is assuring his godson Johnny that he'll get him the movie role he's after. When Johnny asks how he'll persuade the director, Vito offers this as an explanation.\n\nFun Fact: According to IMDB, this scene has been referenced up to 150 times in other media. Fittingly, Brando won an Oscar for this performance (although he declined it).\n\nYou might also like: Top 10 Gangster Movies\n\n7. \"Mama always said life was like a box of chocolates.

This little sorrowful snippet describes the spiral his life has been in since.\n\n11. “Not my tempo.” — \"Whiplash,\" 2014.\n\n12. \"You've got to ask yourself one question: 'Do I feel lucky?' Well, do ya, punk?\" — \"Dirty Harry,\" 1971.\n\n13. \"You had me at ‘hello.’\" — \"Jerry Maguire,\" 1996.\n\n14. \"Toto, I've got a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.\" — \"The Wizard of Oz,\" 1939.\n\nThis movie quote is delivered by the heroine Dorothy after she finds herself whisked away to the fantastical land of Oz.\n\nFun Fact: This movie quote is maybe misquoted more often than it is quoted correctly. Most people drop the words \"I've got a feeling\" from the line.\n\n15. \"Today, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.\" — \"The Pride of the Yankees,\" 1942.\n\n16. \"If you build it, he will come.\" — \"Field of Dreams,\" 1989.\n\n17. \"We'll always have Paris.\" — \"Casablanca,\" 1942.\n\n18. \"Here's looking at you, kid.\" — \"Casablanca,\" 1942.\n\nHumphrey Bogart says this famous quote four times over the course of the film.\n\nFun Fact: this line wasn't in the original screenplay, but was added due to a conversation between Bogart and co-star Ingrid Bergman.\n\n19. \"You've got red on you.\" — \"Shaun of the Dead,\" 2004.\n\n20. \"Is it safe?\" — \"Marathon Man,\" 1976.\n\n21. \"Wait a minute, wait a minute.

Come back!\" — \"Shane,\" 1953.\n\n24. \"Well, nobody's perfect.\" — \"Some Like It Hot,\" 1959.\n\n25. \"Houston, we have a problem.\" — \"Apollo 13,\" 1995.\n\n26. \"All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up.\" — \"Sunset Boulevard,\" 1950.\n\nThis line is delivered by Gloria Swanson at the end of the movie, as her character hallucinates and mistakes crime scene reporters for the film crew of a movie.\n\n27. \"Well, I don't want to survive. I want to live.\" — \"12 Years a Slave,\" 2013.\n\n28. \"Listen to them. Children of the night.

The script only said \"Travis speaks to himself in the mirror\", so De Niro took some liberties and was ultimately successful.\n\n39. \"I'll have what she's having.\" — \"When Harry Met Sally,\" 1989.\n\n40. \"You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve?
