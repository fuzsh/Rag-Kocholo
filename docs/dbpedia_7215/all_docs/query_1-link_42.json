Yeah, the film had a cast composed of some of the most colorful characters (Iggy Pop, Ann Magnuson) and character actors (Malcolm McDowell, Ice-T, and of course the almighty Lori Petty!) in show biz. And, its dystopic, resource-starved desert setting, intense action sequences, and lead female character mark it as a feminist (albeit funnier) precursor to Mad Max: Fury Road. But check out the soundtrack’s bona fides: assembled by Courtney Love herself, it features a Who’s Who of ‘90s female rock including Hole, Björk, L7, Veruca Salt, and Belly, among others. Plus, it even has tracks that were exclusive to its release, like a unique version of Devo’s “Girl U Want,” “Mockingbird Girl” by The Magnificent Bastards (a side project of the late Scott Weiland of Stone Temple Pilots), and a duet of “Let’s Do It, Let’s Fall in Love” between Joan Jett and The Replacements’ Paul Westerberg. In short, if there ever were a soundtrack that needed to be on wax, this would be it. Real Gone Music has done it right, too, with a gatefold jacket featuring the trademark comic book art and stills from the film, and the ETR Exclusive \"Bloody Swirl\" vinyl pressing limited to 300 copies!\n\nTracklist\n\nSide A\n\nRipper Sole - Stomp\n\nArmy of Me - Björk\n\nGirl U Want—Devo\n\nMockingbird Girl - The Magnificent Bastards\n\nShove - L7\n\nDrown Soda - Hole\n\nSide B\n\nBomb - Bush\n\nRoads - Portishead\n\nLet’s Do It - Joan Jett & Paul Westerberg\n\nThief - Belly\n\nAurora - Veruca Salt\n\nBig Gun - Ice T\n\nPlease note: This is a distributed title (which means another label pressed this release), so we do not have any extra jackets for this release in case of minor damage by the USPS in transit. To clarify, It will come packaged in a full-color jacket (as pictured) sealed with plastic wrap UNLESS requested in the comment section of your order to \"open the album & place outside of the jacket prior to shipping.\" This is a good way to prevent potential seam splits along the top of the jacket due to careless handling by the post office, and this service is free of charge. If you forget to write in the comments of your order about shipping outside of the jacket, PLEASE EMAIL US WITH YOUR ORDER NUMBER and ask us to update the notes on your order to ship outside of the jacket. Release days are hectic, especially the first few hours, so please give ample time for a response. We will get back to you as soon as possible. Thank you!"
