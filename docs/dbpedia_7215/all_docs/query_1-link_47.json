        "text": "ith other UK independant labels leaning into Halloween with their disc releases this October with two disdinctly non-horror titles, with the Hollywood adaptation of Alan Martin and Jamie Hewlettâs UK comic book, Tank Girl, and a Hong Kong take on Japanâs Lady Snowblood, starring the inimitable Angela Mao, Broken Oath.\n\nTANK GIRL (USA 1995)\n\nLimited Edition Blu-ray Box Set | 28 October 2024 | Â£26.99\n\nBrought to the screen by director Rachel Talalay (Freddyâs Dead: The Final Nightmare) and starring Lori Petty (Point Break) in its title role, Tank Girl is a slice of post-apocalyptic science fiction â and a bonafide cult classic â adapted from the hit comic strip created by Alan Martin and Jamie Hewlett.\n\nThe year is 2033, and the people of Earth have been suffering through a drought for over a decade. The planetâs water supply is now controlled by megalomaniac businessman Kesslee (Malcolm McDowell), the owner of the Water & Power corporation. But in Australia, at least, there is resistance. If Kesslee wants to take control of the last water well in the Outback, heâll need to contend with the Rippers â mutant hybrids of human and kangaroo â and Rebecca Buck, alias Tank Girl (Petty): a woman with a tank, a bad attitude, and a determination to rescue the world from the brink of oblivion.\n\nFirst published by the British comics magazine Deadline in 1988, Tank Girl began life as a comic strip before becoming a cult phenomenon in the 1990s. In 1995, the central character starred in a new run of stories under DC Comicsâ Vertigo imprint and this big-screen adaptation, which formed one part of a boom in comic book movies that also included The Shadow, Judge Dredd and The Phantom. Eureka Classics is presenting this limited edition of the film on Blu-ray for the first time in the UK.\n\nLIMITED EDITION BLU-RAY CONTENTS:\n\nLimited Collector's Edition Box Set [2000 copies]\n\nLimited Edition Hardbound Slipcase featuring new artwork by Tank Girl cover artist Greg Staples\n\nA limited edition 60-page collector’s booklet featuring new writing on Tank Girl by genre film experts Stacey Abbott and Kieran Foster\n\n1080p HD presentation on Blu-rayÂ\n\n5.1 DTS-HD MA and LPCM 2.0 audio options\n\nOptional English SDH\n\nNot a Bedtime Story â A new interview with artist Greg Staples on Tank Girl from page to screen\n\nAudio commentary with director Rachel Talalay and actress Lori Petty\n\nGirl U Want â A new appreciation of Tank Girl with film scholar and fan Lindsay Hallam\n\nA plethora of archival interviews with cast and crew, including Rachel Talalay, Lori Petty, Catherine Hardwicke, and more\n\nMaking Tank Girl â 1995 featurette\n\nTheatrical Trailer\n\nMore to be announced. All extras subject to change.\n\nBROKEN OATH [PO JIE] (Hong Kong 1977)\n\nA Hong Kong take on Japanâs Lady Snowblood, Broken Oath is an action-packed tale of righteous vengeance directed by Jeong Chang-hwa (King Boxer) and starring the first lady of kung fu cinema: the inimitable Angela Mao!\n\nOrphaned and angry, Lotus (Mao) is raised by Buddhist nuns before she is exiled for her violent ways â and skipping classes to improve her martial arts skills. Finding herself alone in the world, she quickly comes to discover the truth of her past: that her father was once a respected member of the Imperial Court who was murdered in cold blood, and that her mother gave birth to her in a jail cell after being unjustly imprisoned for killing one of the culprits. With revenge on her mind and a newfound accomplice in tow (Bruce Leung, Magnificent Bodyguards), she sets out to track down the men responsible for tearing her family apart â armed with both her considerable martial arts prowess and a nest of scorpions with which to poison her enemies.\n\nMade at the height of her fame following roles in Hapkido, Lady Whirlwind, Enter the Dragon and When Taekwondo Strikes, Broken Oath is one of Angela Maoâs very best films â and boasts action choreography orchestrated by Hsia Hsu (Drunken Master) and Yuen Woo-ping, one of the most respected stunt coordinators in both Hong Kong (The Magnificent Butcher) and Hollywood (The Matrix). Eureka Classics is presenting the film on Blu-ray for the first time anywhere in the world from a brand new 2K restoration.\n\nLIMITED EDITION BLU-RAY CONTENTS:"
