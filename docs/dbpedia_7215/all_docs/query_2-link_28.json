        "text": "We haven’t seen Tank Girl on the big screen since director Rachel Talalay’s film adaptation of the comic series back in 1995, which starred Lori Petty as the title character. But it looks like a brand new adaptation may be on its way, revealed by co-creator Alan Martin today.\n\nMartin tweeted this morning, “Just heard that Margot Robbie’s company have optioned rights from MGM to make a new Tank Girl movie – now several months into development.”\n\n“We haven’t been contacted by any of the parties involved with the project, so not sure if there will be any input from the original creators,” he added.\n\nRobbie launched her production company LuckyChap Entertainment in 2014. The company has thus far produced I, Tonya, Terminal, Dreamland and next year’s Birds of Prey.\n\nNo word on whether or not Robbie plans on starring in the film.\n\nThe first film in the Predator franchise in the wake of Disney taking over 20th Century Fox, Prey went direct-to-Hulu back in 2022, but the Alien franchise’s first film under the Disney umbrella is getting a big theatrical release this weekend. But that wasn’t always the case.\n\nAs you may recall, Alien: Romulus was originally announced as a Hulu movie, and director Fede Alvarez explains what changed – and when it changed – in a new chat with Variety.\n\nIt was back in 2021 that Alien: Romulus was planning a Hulu debut, which Alvarez says was “a reaction to theaters being completely gone” at the time, deep in the heart of the pandemic.\n\n“That decision was not made at the point where theaters were healthy,” Alvarez explains to Variety. “[But] it was always going to be an ambitious movie for [a streaming] platform.”\n\nHe continues, “I remember making an announcement to everybody that this movie was going in theaters, and there was a big cheer. I was like, wow, even the gaffer cares that this goes into theaters!”\n\nThe pivot to theatrical for Alien: Romulus looks to have been a smart one on the part of 20th Century Studios, as the film opened to $6.5 million in Thursday previews last night.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter notes, “Romulus bit off a strong $6.5 million in Thursday previews, putting the highly anticipated August event on course to open to a better-than-expected $40 million-plus in another win for the Disney film empire and the summer box office overall.”\n\nIn Alien: Romulus, “While scavenging the deep ends of a derelict space station, a group of young space colonizers come face to face with the most terrifying life form in the universe.”\n\nCailee Spaeny (The Craft: Legacy, Pacific Rim Uprising) leads the cast alongside Isabela Merced, David Jonsson, Archie Renaux, Spike Fearn and Aileen Wu.\n\nFede Alvarez co-wrote the script with Rodo Sayagues (Evil Dead). Ridley Scott is on board as producer for the film, the first movie in the franchise to be released by Disney.\n\nAlien: Romulus is based on characters created by Dan O’Bannon and Ronald Shusett."
