        "text": "Margot Robbie's film production company is working on a Tank Girl movie, according to co-creator Alan Martin.\n\nMartin took to Twitter on Monday to say a new Tank Girl movie is far into pre-production, though he isn't personally involved in the project.\n\n\"Just heard that Margot Robbie's company have optioned rights from MGM to make a new Tank Girl movie - now several months into development.\" tweeted Martin. \"We haven't been contacted by any of the parties involved with the project, so not sure if there will be any input from the original creators.\"\n\nTank Girl is a comic book series first published in the British comics magazine Deadline. It focused on the eponymous character who lives in a tank and loves violence, alcohol and her kangaroo boyfriend. It was created by writer Martin and artist Jamie Hewlett. The series ran until 1995 when Deadline ran out of business. Martin would come back to the series over the years, including reuniting with Hewlett for a Kickstarter-backed return in 2015. Hewlett went on to co-create the band Gorillaz and continues to stay involved with the group by making art and visuals.\n\nThe original Tank Girl movie hit theaters in 1995, directed by Rachel Talalay (Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare) and starring Lori Petty (Point Break, Orange is the New Black) as the title character. Malcolm McDowell, Naomi Watts, Iggy Pop, Ice-T and James Hong also starred in the movie. It received negative reviews from critics and made about $4 million at the box office against a budget of $25 million.\n\nRobbie may have wrapped filming her upcoming appearance as Harley Quinn in Birds of Prey, but the actress is likely returning to the role for the new Suicide Squad movie. The Suicide Squad is currently in the casting stage and set for summer 2021. Other than that, Robbie is confirmed to play Barbie. We last heard about that movie in July when new writers were brought on board. There is no word if Robbie will play Tank Girl herself, but the actress seems to have quite a bit on her plate.\n\nCheck out the video below for more on Robbie's upcoming Barbie movie:\n\nPetey Oneto is a freelance writer for IGN who would love to do nothing all day but get drunk in a tank with my kangaroo boyfriend, but, unfortunately, there are bills to be paid."
