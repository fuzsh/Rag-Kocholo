        "text": "\"Tank Girl\" is a comic-based movie with the flashy pop style of a real comic book, but that's a mixed blessing. It's a comic book that takes an hour and three-quarters to read, for one thing. And its storytelling isn't moved forward by anything better than an occasional need to turn the page.\n\nBut \"Tank Girl\" may be sending out a dog-whistle signal to its own special constituency, fans of an androgynous punk heroine who's so underground she's almost buried. A bigger phenomenon in England than it is here, the \"Tank Girl\" comic strip celebrates beer-swigging insouciance and a taste for heavy metal, the kind found in military equipment this heroine likes to commandeer. \"Feeling a little inadequate?\" the movie's Tank Girl taunts, as she rides on the enormous gun of her beloved tank. \"My God, the sheer size of it!\" she says of a huge gun in another scene.\n\nSince this is thoroughly tongue in cheek, \"Tank Girl\" has a likable brashness, even when breathless, pointless plotting threatens to eclipse the movie's charms. Chief among its strong points is Lori Petty, a buzz-cut fashion plate in a Prozac necklace, who brings the necessary gusto to Tank Girl's flippancy.\n\n\"Ugh, you are SO dead,\" Tank Girl says to a messy corpse. \"It's been swell, but the swelling's gone down,\" she says, by way of farewell. \"To the Bat-tank!\" she cries, making another getaway. The film is loaded with winking references to pop landmarks from \"Star Wars\" to \"The Wizard of Oz.\""
