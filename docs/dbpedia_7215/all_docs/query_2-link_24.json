        "text": "Last Updated on August 2, 2021\n\nLadies, lock up your sons, because a report from the official Tank Girl Facebook page says that Margot Robbie is gearing up to bring TANK GIRL back to the big screen!\n\nAccording to today's post, Robbie's LuckyChap Entertainment production company is now actively developing new ideas to welcome the beloved comic book character back into theaters after her team had purchased the rights to the character. The best part? Word of the acquisition comes directly from Tank Girl co-creator Alan Martin, and you just don't get anymore official than that!\n\nSo far, LuckyChap has stated that Robbie will serve as a producer on the project, but will not confirm if the Queenpin of Crime herself will star in the title role. Personally, I can't imagine a scenario where she would pass on playing the character, though it's best to wait until we hear the official word to get too excited.\n\nCreated by Alan Martin and Jamie Hewlett, Tank Girl first arrived as part of the debut issue of Deadline (1998), a UK-based magazine meant to serve as a printed forum for up-and-coming comic-related talent. Known to her friends and enemies as Tank Girl, the character's real name is Rebecca Buck. As Tank Girl, Rebecca pilots a tank that also serves as her home. After completing several missions for a mysterious organization, Tank Girl was labeled as an outlaw for her dabbling in outrageous sexual acts and torrid history of substance abuse.\n\nRelated\n\nAwesome Art Weâ€™ve Found Around The Net: Fargo, Fight Club, The Iron Giant, Jaws, Raging Bull, Thor\n\nIn 1995, director Rachel Talalay directed a TANK GIRL film, which starred A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN actress Lori Petty as the titular tank-lovin' badass. The bizarre feature saw Tank Girl among the few survivors of a dystopian Earth. With plenty of gas in her war tank, she fought against the tyranny of a mega-corporation that dominated the remaining potable water supply of the planet. Joining Petty for the off-the-wall comic book action film were Naomi Watts as Jet Girl, and Ice-T as T-Saint.\n\nFun Fact: TANK GIRL was the first and only film I'd ever been kicked out of. Apparently I was too young to witness Tank Girl's outrageous adventures up on the big screen.\n\nWhat do you think about there being a TANK GIRL reboot? Do you think Robbie will come to star in the film? If not, who do you think would be a great fit for the character? Let us know in the comments section below."
