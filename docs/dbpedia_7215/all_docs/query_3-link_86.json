[This is not a complete thought. What about the\n\npebbles?]\n\nSENTENCE The pebbles in Mystery Cove are round and multicolored.\n\nFRAGMENT Relaxes by taking a walk by the ocean. [This is not a complete thought. Who\n\nrelaxes?]\n\nSENTENCE Saki relaxes by taking a walk by the ocean.\n\nFRAGMENT When a sea star loses an arm. [This thought is not complete. What happens when\n\na sea star loses an arm?]\n\nSENTENCE When a sea star loses an arm, it can grow a new one.\n\nNOTE In speech, people frequently use sentence fragments. Such fragments usually arenât\n\nconfusing, because the speakerâs tone of voice and facial expressions help to complete\n\nthe meaning. Professional writers may also use sentence fragments to create specific\n\neffects in their writing. However, in your writing at school, you will find it best to use\n\ncomplete sentences.\n\nEXERCISE 1 Identifying Sentences\n\nOn the line before each of the following word groups, write sent. if the group is a sentence or\n\nfrag. if the group is a sentence fragment. Add correct punctuation if the group of words is a\n\nsentence.\n\nEX. sent. 1.The lava from the volcano was a boiling red river\n\n_______ 1. The tropical fish were green and blue\n\n_______ 2. Did Frank call you\n\nP:09\n\nÂ© Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company Module 1 2\n\n_______ 3. Spending a night in the woods\n\n_______ 4. Watch out for the wet paint\n\n_______ 5. When the lake is calm\n\n_______ 6. Mushrooms grow in the woods\n\n_______ 7. Look at all the snow\n\n_______ 8. The swimming pool was crowded\n\n_______ 9. Pea pods sizzled in the wok\n\n_______ 10. The hollyhocks by the house\n\nEXERCISE 2 Revising Fragments\n\nOn your own paper, revise the fragment below to make complete sentences. Add any words you\n\nmight need.\n\nEX. 1. The glowing moon\n\n1. The glowing moon looked like a pearl.\n\n1. dangling from the ceiling\n\n2. the blue sweater\n\n3. after seeing the falling star\n\n4. at the student art show\n\n5. cooking with vegetables and pasta\n\n6. visit with my grandfather\n\n7. a bowl of oranges\n\n8. on his trip to China\n\n9. singing on stage\n\n10. before breakfast\n\n11. in the lake\n\n12. knitting sweaters\n\n13. the small pond\n\n14. on his desk\n\n15. some yellow flowers\n\nP:10\n\nÂ© Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company Module 1 3\n\nMODULE 1: THE SENTENCE\n\nRUN-ON SENTENCES\n\nA run-on sentence is actually two or more sentences run together into one sentence.\n\nEXAMPLES The play begins at 2:00 we had better hurry.\n\nIâm looking for the basketball court I thought it was behind the gym.\n\nIce is water in its solid form, water vapor is water in its gaseous form.\n\nThere are two good ways to revise run-on sentences.\n\n1. Make two sentences.\n\nRUN-ON Anatole, turn the oven on we will make raisin bread.\n\nCORRECT Anatole, turn the oven on. We will make raisin bread.\n\n2. Link the two ideas with a comma and a coordinating conjunction (and, but, or).\n\nRUN-ON Separate the red pants from the white T-shirts before you wash them you will\n\nhave pink shirts.\n\nCORRECT Separate the red pants from the white T-shirts before you wash them, or you will\n\nhave pink shirts.\n\nA comma alone is not enough to link two complete ideas in a sentence. If you use just a comma\n\nbetween two complete ideas, you create a comma splice.\n\nRUN-ON The electric ray is a fish, it stuns its prey with electricity.\n\nCORRECT The electric ray is a fish. It stuns its prey with electricity.\n\nEXERCISE 3 Identifying Run-on Sentences\n\nDecide which of the following groups of words are complete sentences, and which are run-on\n\nsentences. Write run-on or sent. on the line before each item.\n\nEX. 1. RUN-ON Anton won four athletic trophies last year, Darryl won two.\n\n______ 1. I like Rosieâs new cat, but I prefer big dogs.\n\n______ 2. Stella went to Chile she met some of her relatives there.\n\n______ 3. Smoke rose from the campfire, it circled above our heads.\n\n______ 4. Big dogs can be frightening, or they can be as gentle as small ones.\n\n______ 5. Lions roared in the distance the tour group ran back to the bus.\n\n______ 6. Jogging is good for you, but you must wear proper running shoes.\n\n______ 7. The Braille alphabet uses raised dots that stand for letters and spell out words.\n\nP:11\n\nÂ© Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company Module 1 4\n\n______ 8. Should we go to Houston by airplane should we take a bus?\n\n______ 9. Bill, you can work as an usher, you can stand in the lobby and collect peopleâs\n\ntickets.\n\n______ 10. Robots are often used in factories today, for they can do some jobs well.\n\nEXERCISE 4 Revising Run-on Sentences\n\nOn your own paper, revise the run-on sentences below to form one or more complete sentences.\n\nEX. 1. The vase in the basement is Aunt Lydiaâs she got it on her trip to Greece.\n\n1. The vase in the basement is Aunt Lydiaâs. She got it on her trip to Greece.\n\n1. A mighty wind was blowing, the roof of the house was shaking.\n\n2. I love tongue twisters, I always mess up âPeter Piper.â\n\n3. My story is about someone as small as an ant, he lives in an acorn under a big oak tree.\n\n4. I love making up rap lyrics I donât like performing.\n\n5. I may become a firefighter one day, perhaps Iâll work for the police.\n\n6. The brick wall at the edge of the playground fell down no one was hurt.\n\n7. The sun is many times bigger than the earth, the sun is only a medium-sized star.\n\n8. My older sister is an actor she is an expert on makeup.\n\n9. Is that a riddle is it simply a nonsense verse?\n\n10. The story was written long ago in Persia, it is about a flying carpet.\n\nP:12\n\nÂ© Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company Module 1 5\n\nMODULE 1: THE SENTENCE\n\nTHE SUBJECT\n\nEvery sentence has two main parts: a subject and a predicate.\n\n1b The subject tells whom or what the sentence is about.\n\nEXAMPLE The smell of a wood fire makes me think of camping.\n\n1c To find the subject, ask yourself who or what is doing something or about whom or\n\nwhat something is being said.\n\nEXAMPLE My first dog loved eating turnips. [What loved eating turnips? My first dog did.]\n\n1d The subject does not always come at the beginning of a sentence. It may be in the\n\nmiddle or even at the end.\n\nSometimes you may have trouble finding the subject of a sentence. In such cases, find the verb\n\nfirst. Then ask yourself to whom or to what the verb is referring.\n\nEXAMPLES During the summer, your brother could cut grass to earn money. [The verb is\n\ncould cut. Who could cut? The answer is your brother, the subject of the\n\nsentence.]\n\nAcross the busy highway raced a deer. [The verb is raced. What raced? A deer\n\nraced. A deer is the subject of the sentence.]\n\nNOTE The subject is never found in a prepositional phrase.\n\nEXAMPLE In the drawer was a pair of scissors. [Pair is the subject of the\n\nsentence, not drawer.]\n\nEXERCISE 5 Identifying Subjects\n\nUnderline the subject in each of the following sentences.\n\nEX. 1. Behind the tree lurked a tiger.\n\n1. During the winter, our father enjoys making thick, steaming pots of vegetable stew.\n\n2. The bulletin board above Alishaâs desk is full of photos, banners, and ribbons.\n\n3. Bobbing in the water was a small sailboat.\n\n4. In a quiet corner of the library, Sam read a book.\n\nP:13\n\nÂ© Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company Module 1 6\n\n5. On the back porch railing perched a sparrow.\n\n6. The main character wore a tuxedo and slippers.\n\n7. Did Virginia Hamilton write M.C. Higgins the Great?\n\n8. As a child, my grandfather sold newspapers.\n\n9. Up the tree ran a squirrel.\n\n10. Harryâs cat will jump for a carrot.\n\n11. The zipper on my new winter jacket is stuck.\n\n12. Before winter, we should cover all of the old windows with plastic.\n\n13. When is Jarvis going to visit us?\n\n14. Renaâs boots were under the chicken wire in the shed.\n\n15. Across the busy street bounced a football.\n\nEXERCISE 6 Writing Complete Sentences\n\nAdd a subject to each of the word groups below. On your own paper, write your sentence with\n\nthe correct punctuation and capitalization.\n\nEX. 1. danced to the music\n\n1.

It does not include\n\ndescriptive words.\n\nCOMPLETE SUBJECT The large fender of the bike next to mine\n\nSIMPLE SUBJECT fender\n\nIf you leave out the simple subject, a sentence does not make sense.\n\nEXAMPLE The large â¦ of the bike next to mine is bent.\n\nSometimes the same word or words make up both the simple subject and the complete subject.\n\nEXAMPLE Honeybees gather nectar in the flowers.\n\nNOTE In this module, the term subject refers to the simple subject unless otherwise indicated.\n\nEXERCISE 7 Identifying Complete Subjects and Simple Subjects\n\nIn each of the following sentences, underline the complete subject once. Underline the simple\n\nsubject twice.\n\nEX. 1. The black umbrella by the front door is mine.\n\n1. His white-and-blue cotton sweater shrank two sizes.\n\n2.

Sometimes, however, part or all of the\n\npredicate comes before the subject.\n\nEXAMPLES Silently, the beetle struggled to climb out of the sink.\n\nSitting on the oily dock were a dozen gulls.\n\nOn Saturday night will you stay at your friendâs house?\n\nEXERCISE 9 Identifying Predicates\n\nUnderline the predicate in each of the following sentences.\n\nEX. 1.

[You might be pointing to a\n\npicture while saying the word that. That is a demonstrative pronoun.]\n\nEXERCISE 4 Identifying Demonstrative Pronouns\n\nUnderline the demonstrative pronoun in each of the following sentences.\n\nEX. 1. Are these the sandwiches for our picnic?\n\n1. That is the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\n2. This is my new friend, Alex.\n\n3. What is that?\n\n4. Are these the ingredients for your famous taco casserole?\n\n5. Those are skid marks from someoneâs tires.\n\n6. These are important qualities in a friend: loyalty and honesty.\n\n7. Is that the sweater you are wearing with the new skirt?\n\n8. This is the capital city of Wyoming.\n\n9. These were found in the gym after the volleyball game.\n\n10. Are those the buses for our field trip?\n\nP:36\n\nÂ© Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company Module 2 29\n\nRelative Pronouns\n\nA relative pronoun introduces an adjective clause. An adjective clause describes or adds\n\ninformation about the noun or pronoun that comes before it. Common relative pronouns\n\ninclude that, which, who, whom, and whose.\n\nEXAMPLES Summer is the season that I like most. [The relative pronoun that\n\nintroduces the adjective clause that I like most. The adjective clause adds\n\ninformation about the noun season.]\n\nShawna Frost, who is our art teacher, is Mattâs aunt. [The relative pronoun\n\nwho introduces the adjective clause who is our art teacher. The adjective\n\nclause adds information about the woman Shawna Frost.]\n\nEXERCISE 5 Classifying Relative and Demonstrative Pronouns\n\nClassify each underlined pronoun in the following sentences as either relative or demonstrative.\n\nRemember that the word that can be either a relative or a demonstrative pronoun. Be careful to\n\nidentify the word that correctly.\n\nEX. 1. The neighbors whom the Bensons met had moved here from Iowa.\n\n1. The garden gate, which was not locked, banged in the wind.\n\n2. This is a book about gold mines in the nineteenth century.\n\n3. Nancy Tilden, who won the tennis match, is Gabriellaâs best friend.\n\n4. The man whose sofa Rob bought was moving to a smaller apartment.\n\n5. That is a poem by Lindsey Martin.\n\n6. The poem that Lindsey wrote is quite beautiful.\n\n7. Those are the winners of the photography contest.\n\n8. The friends whom Latonya invited to the party accepted the invitation.\n\n9. Are these the tips for todayâs grammar lesson?\n\n10. Is that Chenâs scrapbook from the sixth grade?\n\nP:37\n\nÂ© Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company Module 2 30\n\nMODULE 2: PARTS OF SPEECH\n\nADJECTIVES\n\n2d An adjective is a word that modifies a noun or a pronoun.\n\nTo modify a word means to describe the word or to make its meaning more definite. An\n\nadjective modifies a noun or a pronoun by telling what kind, which one, how much, or how\n\nmany.\n\nEXAMPLES Rita went on a long journey. [The adjective long tells what kind of journey.]\n\nI need to wash my yellow sweater. [The adjectives my and yellow tell which\n\nsweater.]\n\nIt rained for forty days and nights. [The adjective forty tells how many days and\n\nnights.]\n\nNOTE Some teachers prefer to call possessive pronouns (such as my, your, and their)\n\nadjectives. Follow your teacherâs directions.\n\nAdjectives usually come before the words they modify. Sometimes, however, an adjective\n\ncomes after the word it modifies.\n\nEXAMPLE The grass was brown. [The adjective brown modifies grass.]\n\nNOTE The adjectives a, an, and the are called articles.\n\nEXERCISE 6 Identifying Adjectives\n\nIn the following sentences, draw one line under the adjectives and two lines under the noun or\n\npronoun each adjective modifies. Do not include the articles a, an, and the.\n\nEX. 1. The hungry giraffe peered over the leafy treetops.\n\n1. The driest area in the world is a desert in Chile.\n\n2. Put on the red jacket, grab the warmest scarf, and letâs go!\n\n3. Would you make a jelly sandwich for my lunch?\n\n4. I have not yet reached the third level of the newest game!\n\n5. Opossums in New Zealand have big eyes, pink noses, and brushy tails.\n\n6. The house was cold and dark when we arrived.\n\nP:38\n\nÂ© Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company Module 2 31\n\n7. In the story, a space traveler crosses a time dimension and lands in a new world.\n\n8. The weather forecaster says that the summer will be long and hot.\n\n9. The strong winds reached fifty miles an hour last night.\n\n10. The bright, frisky cat weighs seven pounds.\n\n11. Sylvia Earle explored deep waters to study sea life.\n\n12. Scott and I are going to make a raisin cake for the class party.\n\n13. Cara made green beans and grilled tomatoes for supper.\n\n14. Steve made a colorful diagram of the taproot system of a carrot plant.\n\n15. Farmers in Mali often work on rugged mountainsides to plant their crops.\n\nEXERCISE 7 Writing Adjectives for a Story\n\nComplete the story below by adding an appropriate adjective for each blank. Do not use the same\n\nadjective twice. Write your adjectives on your own paper.\n\nEX. [1]. This is an (what kind?) story about a rabbit and a turtle.\n\n1. amusing\n\nThe Hare and the Tortoise: A Fable Retold\n\n[1] One (what kind?) day in a(n) (what kind?) forest (how many?) years ago, there lived a\n\nrabbit and a turtle. [2] The rabbit, quick on its feet, knew that it was (what kind?) than the turtle,\n\nwho always took its time. [3] Yet, the (what kind?) turtle challenged the rabbit to a race. [4] The\n\n(what kind?) rabbit quickly agreed. [5] As soon as the (what kind?) race began, the rabbit took\n\nthe lead. [6] A (how much?) way ahead of the turtle, the rabbit decided to take a (what kind?)\n\nnap. [7] The turtle just kept plodding along the (which one?) path. [8] Eventually the turtle\n\nreached the (what kind?) line. [9] When the (what kind?) rabbit woke up, it knew that it was in\n\ntrouble! [10] The rabbit raced to the finish line, only to find the (what kind?) turtle waiting there.\n\nP:39\n\nÂ© Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company Module 2 32\n\nMODULE 2: PARTS OF SPEECH\n\nPROPER AND DEMONSTRATIVE ADJECTIVES\n\n2e A proper adjective is formed from a proper noun and begins with a capital letter.\n\nProper Nouns Proper Adjectives\n\nSiberia Siberian husky\n\nPersia Persian Gulf\n\na trip to Greece a Greek island\n\na street in Chicago the Chicago skyline\n\n2f This, that, these, and those can be used both as adjectives and as pronouns. When\n\nthey modify a noun, they are called demonstrative adjectives. When they are used\n\nalone, they are called demonstrative pronouns.\n\nADJECTIVE Take these eggs to Mr. Wong.\n\nPRONOUN Take these to Mr. Wong.\n\nEXERCISE 8 Finding Common and Proper Adjectives\n\nIn the paragraph below, underline the common adjectives once and the proper adjectives twice.\n\nDo not include the articles a, an, and the.\n\nEX.

[The action of dig is directed toward burrows.]\n\nWe saw the bonfire last Fourth of July. [The action of saw is directed toward\n\nbonfire.]\n\n3d An intransitive verb does not pass action to a receiver or an object. It simply\n\nexpresses an action or tells something about the subject.\n\nEXAMPLES The speaker coughed.\n\nThe giant stepped over the house.\n\nSome verbs may be either transitive or intransitive, depending on how they are used in a\n\nsentence.\n\nTRANSITIVE Last week Justin ran a four-minute mile.\n\nINTRANSITIVE Justin runs faster than anyone else on his team.\n\nEXERCISE 3 Identifying Transitive and Intransitive Verbs\n\nIn the following sentences, identify each italicized verb.

In some cases, the verb be is not followed by a noun, a pronoun, or\n\nan adjective. Be can express a state of being without having a complement.\n\nEXAMPLES Fiji is an island nation. [The verb is connects the noun nation with the subject\n\nFiji.]\n\nVergie will be better after she has rested. [The verb will be connects the adjective\n\nbetter with the subject Vergie.]\n\nLemuel seems tired today. [The verb seems connects the adjective tired with the\n\nsubject Lemuel.]\n\nThis cannot be!

How often? To what extent?\n\nWhen? or or\n\nHow? How long? How much?\n\nEXAMPLES The snake swiftly slithered away. [Swiftly is an adverb modifying the verb\n\nslithered; it tells how.]\n\nWe were playing the music quite loudly. [Quite is an adverb modifying the\n\nadverb loudly; it tells to what extent. Loudly is an adverb modifying the verb\n\nwere playing; it tells how.]\n\nMy suitcase is rather heavy. [Rather is an adverb modifying the adjective\n\nheavy; it tells to what extent.]\n\nNow we can see outside. [Now is an adverb modifying the verb can see; it tells\n\nwhen. Outside is an adverb modifying the verb can see; it tells where.]\n\nNOTE The word not is an adverb. When not is part of a contraction like hadnât, the\n\nânât is an adverb.\n\nEXAMPLES Havenât you studied long enough?\n\nDaniel isnât the only one working hard.\n\n3h Adverbs may appear at various places in a sentence. Adverbs may come before,\n\nafter, or between the words they modify.\n\nEXAMPLES Later the salmon will swim upstream. [Later comes before will swim, the verb it\n\nmodifies.]\n\nThe salmon will later swim upstream. [Later comes between will and swim, the\n\nverb it modifies.]\n\nThe salmon will swim upstream later. [Later comes after will swim, the verb it\n\nmodifies.]\n\nNOTE Avoid using very, too, and so in your writing. These adverbs have lost much of their\n\nforce because they have been used too much.\n\nEXAMPLES We were very tired after the track meet.\n\nWe were extremely tired after the track meet.\n\nP:52\n\nÂ© Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company Module 3 45\n\nEXERCISE 9 Identifying Adverbs and the Words They Modify\n\nUnderline the adverbs in the sentences below.
