After my \"oh my God, yes, I'm madly in love with Xena\" -outing yesterday, it's time to talk about another big icon of mine - Tank Girl.\n\nFor all of you who haven't read the comics yet, do it… now! Your life will change immediatly. There will be a new hero in your lifes - a heavily armed, badass kicking punk girl living in a tank most of time, making out with anarchistic kangaroos.\n\nThe comics were created by Jamie Hewlett and Alan Martin in the late 80s. Jamie Hewlett may also be known as the co-founder of the Gorillaz being responsible for the marvelous look of their virtual band members and videos.\n\nIf some of you do wonder, as I did, where they got all the inspiration for these wicked haircuts. Here is the answer."
