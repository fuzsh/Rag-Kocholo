        "text": "Emerging in the late 1980s, the character Tank Girl became something of a feminist icon as her visibility quickly grew in alternative comics and punk culture. Tank Girl, the central character of the British Tank Girl comics written by Jamie Hewlett and Alan C. Martin, is a fearless, potty-mouthed woman with a kangaroo boyfriend named Booga, a high tolerance for booze, a strong sex drive, and a penchant for violence. Despite her haphazardly shaved head, torn clothes, and combat boots, she wears lacey bras, often appears naked, and maintains a quick wit and a twinkle in her eye. The Tank Girl of the original Hewlett and Martin Deadline and Tank Girl comics of the late 1980s and early 1990s, those under consideration here, embodies the postfeminist individualism of the 1990s. She never seeks acceptance from or belonging to a female-identified group (or any group), and she never acts on behalf of a collective, certainly not a political one. She is hedonistic, if not nihilistic, and she tends to act out of boredom and sexual desire. She is also often drawn with an eye toward the male gaze. Even her girlfriends Sub Girl, Jet Girl, and Barney are barely mentioned the first several years of the comics, and early on Sub Girl and Jet Girl are most prominently featured in titillating full-page illustrations, expanding the visual world of Tank Girl as a playground primarily for men. As such, Tank Girl remains a peculiar case when studied through a feminist lens.\n\nTank Girl's timing, however, was impeccable. Her quick rise to fame coincided with Riot Grrrl culture and music in the United States, roughly 1989 through 1996,2 and an increase in British youth violence in the 1990s resulting in the term “ladettes,” described as hostile female youth who “adopted the attitudes of working-class antisocial males” and their drinking, swearing, and confrontational style (Muncer et al. 35). To blame were “new and aggressive cultural images of women in films and on television” (35). Tank Girl is mentioned by name. The original comics soaked into the pop culture Zeitgeist, resulting in the 1995 movie adaptation directed by Rachel Talalay and starring Lori Petty with a soundtrack assembled by Courtney Love. Female action heroes of the 1990s were rapidly expanding visual representations of women in popular culture and were considered to have transgressive and transformative potential. They “access a range of emotions, skills, and abilities” and derive “power from their ability to think and live creatively, their physical courage, and their strategic uses of technology” (Hills 39). As Yvonne Tasker notes, they were often “motivated by ... maternal instincts” (102), as Tank Girl is in the film, but Elyce Rae Helford explains that the film’s “insistence upon a sexualization of power\" is striking as “an instructive representation of the compromises and contradictions of the 1990s brand of postfeminism\" (299—300). The character “displays the aggressive individualism and ‘projected’ sexuality” of a postfeminism wherein younger women want “a lot of attention through sexual magnetism now” (297). Simultaneously, Tank Girl challenges the “power and supremacy of the phallus” just as she appropriates the phallus via the use of and relationship with her tank: “This mockery ... functions as a critique of masculine power, which is even stronger than her (sexualized) use of physical violence. She ridicules patriarchal sexual politics in every scene in which she is endangered” (303—304). The joke, often, is that men are stupid and controlled by their bodies; women just have to use that against them. Ultimately Helford says Tank Girl “is no feminist film\" (306), in part because Tank Girl's bratty behavior puts others in harm’s way for kicks. Yet this absurdity is part of the character’s lasting appeal. The film was a notorious failure, but the combination of Tank Girl’s style, the film, and the comics that preceded it solidified a place for the character in pop culture with new comics continuing to be released over 30 years later. ’\n\nIn all her contradictions, Tank Girl remains beguiling to readers interested in seeing her as a fetish object or relevant as a powerful, lawless woman confronting the patriarchy. Space for these dual, if not incongruous, impulses is created in the early Hewlett and Martin comics through various visual and linguistic choices and by breaking the fourth wall, thus forcing acknowledgment of the relationship between the reader and Tank Girl character and causing fissures in the reading experience. Charles Hatfield explains, comics “are always characterized by a plurality of messages. They are heterogeneous in form, involving the co-presence and interaction of various codes” (36). He argues that comics’ strength is “several kinds of tension, in which various ways of reading—various interpretative options and potentialities—must be played against each other” including between codes of signification, the single image and image-in-series, narrative sequence and page surface, and reading as experience and text as object (36). How readers interpret tensions depends on who the reader is and what they hope to find. Elizabeth Ellsworth notes in “Mode of Address: It's a Film Thing,\" neither audiences nor films are ever exactly who or what they think they are, and audiences may pleasure in texts in multiple and unanticipated ways (26—27). As such, “modes of address don’t necessarily work together compatibly” (27). Hewlett and Martin amplify this by deliberately complicating the reader’s ability to understand Tank Girl cohesively as a series, or as a character. Discussing the intertex-tuality of Tank Girl, Whelehan and Sonnet note that Hewlett and Martin take roles within the comics and declare “their own knowingness about the sexualised consumption” of Tank Girl (38). As such, “the character simultaneously addresses her male audience's complicity and subverts the ‘naturalness’ of the traditional structure of looking within the genre. A complex negotiation of meanings is thus set up by the inescapably gendered conventions at work” (38). The Tank Girl comics, then, invite “a ‘look’ from the reading constituency for whom the purpose of appropriating the Tank Girl image is resolutely not heterosexual, but women-identified\" (38).\n\nTank Girl is, to be sure, sexual and sexualized. Even the titles of books like The Cream of Tank Girl (2008) and The Hole of Tank Girl (2012), not to mention numerous story titles, foreground her body and sexuality. Yet other collection titles include Tank Girl: Skidmarks (2010), Tank Girl: Bad Wind Rising (2012), and even We Hate Tank Girl (2011). This contrary portrayal began as early as the first comics and accelerated over the initial few years. In a time when images of women in comics were limited, women comics authors even more so, and the experience of visiting comic books stores could be fraught for women and girls,4 Hewlett and Martin created productive cracks in the dynamic between author, reader, and character, providing an in-road tor readers resistant to socio-patriarchal conceptions of what women (in comics or otherwise) should be or how they should be read. Tank Girl's set-up allows readers to see her as empowered regardless of how she is sexualized, as the comics foreground an imperfect and not especially talented female “hero” who repeatedly overcomes obstacles to win the day.’ She uses her body to outsmart men who can only succumb to theirs, often to pull off a joke like when the President “drops his load ” (Hewlett and Martin, Hole 18), or when Tank Girl removes “censored” stickers from her breasts, killing her foe who loses too much blood to his penis (43), a joke recycled in “Milky Outlaw Babes No. 23 Tank Girl\" (285).6 She also uses her cunning and mechanical know-how in an era when women were not encouraged to be mechanically inclined. Tank Girl further encourages readers to make fun of other readers who limit her to a fetish object. Not only is she funny, but much of her humor comes at the expense of men, and the metanarrative’s humor does the same.\n\nThe Tank Girl character first appeared in Atonitan #1 (1987) as a standalone page (Hewlett and Martin, Tank Girl One 2). The authors’ friend, Philip Bond, had created a character named Rocket Girl, inspired by a girl who resembled Hopey from the Hernandez brothers’ Lone and Rockets comics (4). In Love and Rockets at the time, Hopey is a hardcore, combat-boot wearing lesbian punk with a shaved head. Martin explains, “when a stray photocopy of a tank picture found its way onto the Atonitan page, behind Jamie’s chunky-thighed gun-toting femme, she had to be called Tank Girl. I mean, what the hell else could we have called her?” (4). Based on this drawing, Brett Ewins of Deadline commissioned Hewlett and Martin to create Tank Girl (2). Hewlett and Martin claim they set Tank Girl in Australia because “it was flat and empty of buildings, and therefore very easy to draw” (4), but they also mention Mad Max as an influence. Moreover, Australia seemed “like another planet to us” and thus the “perfect stage” for Tank Girl’s “demented life” (5). This setting allows for the seamless inclusion of hardened and angry killer kangaroos, called Rippers in the film, though in both, Tank Girl starts dating one of them, Booga, who is something of a softy. Tank Girl begins as a drunk, party-girl bounty hunter, who quickly gives way to a preference for mass, inconsequential killing. However, this description sounds like a pejorative criticizing Tank Girl, and the beauty of the comic is its frenetic energy, lack of interest in serialized storytelling or traditionally heroic endeavors, punk visual style, and nonjudgmental attitude toward Tank Girl. It is difficult not to be amused by her escapades, mood swings, and approach. Perhaps this is because too few female adventurers existed in comics at the time, or perhaps readers found her daring, pleasurable, and freeing.\n\nTank Girl’s first comic image is a close-up of her head and shoulders next to the title, “Tank Girl\" (Hewlett and Martin, Hole 9). She has a shaved head, big smile, bright eyes, and a bandage on her forehead. Since she looks to the side, she is non-confrontational and easy to adore (Figure 24.1). The next image of her appears a page later (10). In this panel, she looks hard. Her teeth are well defined when before they were not, and she clamps a cigarette. Her face is mostly in shadow, her eyes obscured by glasses as she leans on a rock and aims her gun (10) (Figure 24.2). Tank Girl's image fits her action-packed and angry world. Punches fly, and her tank crashes into a party of kangaroos, one of whom. Rocky, she has been paid to kill. When they crash, Tank Girl giggles and kisses Rocky before having sex with him. They start kissing in one panel and, stand up talking in the next, he says, “1 spose this means I can go free now eh?” (13). She shoots him. This becomes a pattern in Tank Girl. She is hard and soft, angry and funny, scary and sexy, but she usually finishes the job and gets laid—when the story is that linear.\n\nFigure 24.1 Alan Martin and |amie Hewlett. \"Tank Girl.\" Deadline. Deadline Publications Ltd, 1988\n\nFigure 24.2 Alan Martin and Jamie Hewlett. \"Tank Girl.\" Deadline. Deadline Publications Ltd, 1988\n\nCertainly all iterations of Tank Girl foreground her sexuality, but they also focus on her desire, making her standout from other female action characters of the time. In her seminal piece on the male gaze in cinema, “Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema,” Laura Mulvey explains that women in patriarchal cultures stand “as signifier tor the male other, bound by a symbolic order in which man can live out his phantasies and obsessions through linguistic command by imposing them on the silent image of woman still tied to her place as bearer of meaning, not maker of meaning” (834). Film is especially complicit in this arrangement, as it is built on scopophilia, or the pleasure in looking, as the bearer of the look, the presumed male spectator, has access to the object of the look, the woman onscreen. This arrangement is reinforced by cinema’s set-up: the spectator watches from a safe distance in a dark room, and film feeds him images at 24 frames per second (pre-digital). Although comics share some characteristics with cinema, specifically their reliance on visual information in the form of successive panels or frames, reading comics necessitates an active reader to fill in gaps between images. Scott McCloud calls this “closure,\" meaning readers’ brains observe the parts but perceive a whole (63—64), filling in action that occurs in the gutter between panels. This process makes the reader “a willing and conscious collaborator” in meaning making (65). Hillary Chute writes, “While foundational feminist criticism has detailed the problem of the passive female film spectator following and merging helplessly with the objectifying gaze of the camera, the reader of graphic narratives is not trapped in the dark space of the cinema” (9). Quoting an article for Modern Fiction Studies Chute co-wrote with Marianne DeKoven, she further notes, “she must slow down enough to make the connections between image and text and from panel to panel, thus working, at least in part, outside of the mystification of representation that film ... often produces\" (qtd. in Chute 9). Therefore, graphic narratives offer the opportunity for “a constant self-reflexive demystification of the project of representation” (9). The reader continually negotiates their position as reader translating words and images and what takes place in between.\n\nIf images' meanings are not static, their sequential placement allows for even gaze-oriented images to be read subversively. To return to the ending of the aforementioned Tank Girl comic, from one panel to the next Tank Girl giggles, grabs Rocky’s face, and straddles him, fully clothed. Since Tank Girl and Rocky have sex in the gutter (the space between the panels), readers fill in what happens. Although Helford notes, an “insistence upon a sexualization of power” is at times undermined (in the film) by the male gaze (300—301),8 Whelehan and Sonnet explain:\n\ncertain female spectators at least interpret the mode of address of the image as being directed at men for sexual consumption, but who are nonetheless capable of appropriating the space of “the look\" in order to occupy the identificatory space of a fantasy of sexualised female power expressed through aggression. (39)\n\nSince Tank Girl is calling the shots both before and after, when she literally shoots Rocky, and because the gutter places meaning in the reader’s heads, they can intuit she dominates their sexual encounter.\n\nTank Girl’s sexuality is often discussed as queer, since her relationship with Booga begins polyamorously as her boyfriend, Stevie, is still sporadically in the picture. Also, both Rocky and Booga are not human. Tank Girl also has sporadic sexual encounters with female characters, though Whelehan and Sonnet note that for lesbian readers in the 1990s, the character was not “an object of homoerotic desire but as an image to be identified with” (39).’’ However, Tank Girl and Booga quickly settle into a heteronormative relationship. Even images of Tank Girl in, say, a bathtub with Sub Girl and Jet Girl (Hewlett and Martin, Hole 81) or at the center of an all-girl orgy, as she is briefly in “Sunflower” (181), seem drawn with an eye toward the male viewer, and the vast majority of sexual images of Tank Girl or other female characters (as the comics continue, they are all frequently naked) suggest a male gaze. As such, tensions between the story, gaze, and possibilities for, or thwarting of, subversive readings continually govern the reader's relationship to this world.\n\nTank Girl’s first full page of the comic, the “Prologue Bit!” returns her to being displayed and even denigrated by the narrator (Hewlett and Martin, Hole 14). She is centered on the page and in panels around it drawn in several positions—facing forward, to the side, and reclining—all in a lacey bra, skin-tight black pants, boots, and a block-letter “TANK\" belt buckle. She looks like a punk Madonna circa “Like a Virgin,\" especially since her “TANK\" buckle is a variation of Madonna's “BOY TOY\" belt (Figure 24.3).\n\nFigure 24.3 Alan Martin and Jamie Hewlett. \"Tank Girl.\" Deadline. Deadline Publications Ltd, 1988\n\nThis page feels designed to present her sexually, if not undermine her strength as a character. The narrator chides her, calling her bald, smelly, and hungover, among other things (14). Tank Girl burps and undercuts herself: “It’s a good job 1 never get sent out on any important missions like real soldiers do! I’m far too unfit and undisciplined, not to mention fat” (14). The joke is on her, because she is immediately given “a real humdinger of an important mission” (14). Taken as a whole, this page speaks to the tensions Hatfield mentions between codes of signification, single images, narrative sequence, and page surface. Hatfield says comics encourage “a near-simultaneous apprehension of the single image as both moment-in-sequence and design element” (48). This page can be seen as a total unit and sequence functioning linearly and holistically, allowing readers a moment of choice between how they engage with “the format or shape of the object being read” (52). If looking at this “Prologue bit!” holistically, her reclined figure dominates the page like a centerfold in pain (Hewlett and Martin, Hole 14). However, in different panels, she is smiling, her tank is stuck upside down between two rocks, and she scratches her head. The background image bleeds to the edge of the page, a post-apocalyptic, desert landscape surrounding her. This story foregrounds her moods and world, but the reader has a choice of enjoying just the image of her or engaging with the push and pull of the narrator and Tank Girl’s antagonistic repartee. In all, the first Tank Girl comic reifies the ongoing tensions between reading Tank Girl as feminist and/or fetishistic while exemplifying the animosity the narrator/authors initially have with Tank Girl that eventually expands to their readers.\n\nThe penultimate page of the first issue also introduces banter between Tank Girl and the narrator (who is sometimes the authors). One panel includes an illustration of Rocky's head with the word bubble, “If I climb she wont [sic] be able to follow me in that tank!” (Hewlett and Martin, Hole 13). The successive panel shows Tank Girl riding her tank, saying, \"He’s right. I ll have to follow on foot. Geeez how come I can hear everything he’s saying? Must be something to do with comics and all that crap” (13). This metanarrative approach opens up the text by revealing the artifice of the medium and breaking the fourth wall. Readers are pushed out of the story momentarily, and thus unable to fully \"lose themselves\" in the fictional world. This becomes important in Tank Girl, because although initially this approach adds comedy, it eventually becomes antagonistic with a certain type of reader—the horny male who feels entitled to Tank Girl’s story/body. Hewlett and Martin’s intertextual inserts, both within the captions or word bubbles and the exterior margins, might undermine their character, but they also force room for all kinds of readers, including female readers, to feel safe enjoying Tank Girl, because they make fun of male readers who objectify her. This often includes nodding to the sexualization of their character, which allows for something of a compartmentalization of Tank Girl. In other words, she can be seen as an action antihero and fetish object, and one does not necessarily negate the other. Whelehan and Sonnet note, “Such clashes of interpretation indicate the importance of recognising the role of the extratextual in accounting for the readership dynamics centered around ‘Tank Girl \" (40). Tank Girl in fact demands the reader engage with the narrator and/or authors. This insistence on recognizing the artifice of the comics format, and at times actually interrogating readers for their reading habits, both forces the \"slowing down\" and erases the possibility for passive spectatorship, theoretically allowing all readers to break out of certain reading positions. For example, if readers see themselves being called out by comics’ authors in metanarrative moments, it seems unlikely they will keep reading without at least a consciousness of their approach.\n\nAt times Hewlett and Martin literally separate out their meta-discussions from the main comics, which furthers this distance between different readers and provides readers who respond to Tank Girl primarily as an empowered feminist character the ability to make fun of what might now be called fanboys. This is most prominent in \"Blue Helmet,\" which marks a moment in Tank Girl when the authors were deliberately trying to upset reader expectations. Martin notes, “as soon as anyone thinks they’ve got her sussed,\" they change “the artwork, the storylines, or the universe that she occupies\" (Hewlett and Martin, Hole 7). He mentions a spread in The Daily Mirror, “How to Dress Like a Tank Girl,” that inspired them to create a look that \"only the most outlandish, demented freak would ever dare attempt. ... Tank Girl is sporting the unlikely combo of a pair of filthy old Y-Fronts over the top of some stripy cycling shorts, with an ‘inverted’ version of her trademark hair-tuft. Oh, how we chuckled” (7). This antagonism characterizes the friction between what the authors created, what the fans enjoyed, and how the character almost immediately had a presence in popular culture outside of the pages of Deadline.\n\nThe story of “Blue Helmet” is total nonsense. Brian Smell (not a recurring character) is reading the novel Bine Helmet by Jack Kerouac to impress Shit Face (also not a recurring character), a blue-haired girl who knows literature. The majority of the story takes place inside Blue Helmet, which is a mishmash of On the Road and Tank Girl. Jack and his buddy Allen pick up Tank Girl and Booga and find themselves accomplices to a variety of roadside robberies and murders before “Blue Helmet Part 2” ups the ante. They sneak into a Yogi Bear/ Flintstones campground where they meet a Banana Splits-looking group called The Hairy Banana Bunch. Tank Girl has a hallucinatory sexual encounter with Jack before her breasts grow faces. Eventually the police catch up to them, resulting in a chase and concluding with Booga performing oral sex on Tank Girl (197—212). The reliance on pre-existing pop culture to establish this preposterous world, coupled with sex, drugs, and violence, feels normalized for readers familiar with the comics. Just as Tank Girl enters Easy Rider in an early comic, here she and Booga join On the Road. In fact, a small drawing in the bottom margin of The Hairy Banana Bunch page says, “If you have no ideas, steal someone elses!” [sic] (207).\n\nMore remarkable is how Tank Girl is visually presented in “Blue Helmet.” By part two. Tank Girl’s look becomes differently confrontational outside of her new wardrobe and hair. After celebrating the end of the first “Blue Helmet” by bumping bare butts with her friend Barney (204), all parties lose their clothes (206). Tank Girl spends a couple pages in her black bra before the color shifts completely from dark blues to bright oranges as she hallucinates and disrobes for Jack (208—209). Initially Tank Girl is framed for the male gaze: her butt is centered in a panel that takes up two-thirds of the page. The row of panels below it shows her removing her shirt, though the gaze is played with, as she is only shown from the shoulders up, her breasts hidden in the gutter (208). In the first three panels of the next page, she is seen from behind and from the side, waist up, before she says, “You’re staring at my titties aren’t you!” (209). This sequence sets up the expectation of seeing her naked breasts, and when Jack starts to deny staring, she interrupts him, demanding: “Take another look at them Jack!\" (209). The panel reveals a close up of her breasts, which are now monstrous. They each have full sets of teeth, two eyes, tongues sticking out, and say “Voop! Voop! Jack responds with a scream (209) (Figure 24.4).\n\nNot only has Tank Girl called out Jack, and the reader, for sexualizing her, but she has also subverted their expectations, if not punished them for looking, by first imploring them to look and then shape-shifting to make her body horrific, clearly in control of how her sexuality is exploited. Her domination is reinforced in the penultimate panel of the comic, which shows Booga on his knees performing oral sex on Tank Girl under her long trench coat (212) (Figure 24.5).\n\nIf play with Tank Girl’s attire and sexuality was one response to her popularity, certainly “Son of Zoro,” the “lucky extra” that runs across the bottom pages of “Blue Helmet” is another. “Son of Zoro” features a boy with a makeshift “Zoro” mask over his face who represents the typical (aggravating) Tank Girl reader—and Hewlett and Martin are mocking him. This boy runs the gamut of emotions: happy to see Tank Girl, annoyed she is not front and center in the comic, and therefore calling for better writers (198—199). He gets excited when Tank Girl finally enters (“It’s her! It’s her!\" “Yum yum yummy!”) before she farts (“Disgusting. Farting. Don’t fancy her anymore!”) (200—201). He then criticizes Hewlett and Martin again, this time calling them “Idiots!” for repeating lines in panels, which they\n\nFigure 24.4 Alan Martin and Jamie Hewlett. Tank Girl 2 #4. Dark Horse Comics, 1993\n\nFigure 24.5 Alan Martin and Jamie Hewlett. Tank Cirl 2 #4. Dark Horse Comics, 1993\n\nalso do in their “It’s bad panel time!\" comment in the top margin of the same page (201). “Son of Zoro” mimics what the authors mention in interviews as their most devoted, or perhaps overly devoted, fans’ reactions to the comics and the Tank Girl character for better and worse—mostly for worse. By the next page, “Son of Zoro” is ready to write a letter of complaint before, “Woh!! Splash page!” knocks him out, to which he decides, “Time for a quick fiddle with my dick! To the bog!\" (202—203). “Son of Zoro” ends with the boy in an outhouse ejaculating (204) (Figure 24.6). Although “Son of Zoro” concludes in the first half of “Blue Helmet,” the final panel of “Blue Helmet 2,” which follows the panel of Booga kneeling under Tank Girl's coat, is of Brian Smell running into the distance, yelling, “I AM ENLIGHTENED AND INSPIRED! Come to my pants you brainy ladys! [sic] Yum yum!\" (212). However, a line across the bottom of the panel reads, “You are enlightened and full of shit!” (212), ridiculing both the character in the story and the reader who might think reading Tank Girl will impress girls.\n\nFigure 24.6 Alan Martin and [amie Hewlett. Tank Cirl 2 #4. Dark Horse Comics, 1993\n\nThe interplay between page design, character interaction, and reader reflection is key to moments like these that do not directly break the fourth wall but do call out the reader's position in meaning making, their feelings of ownership over the character, and their (base) reactions to her. Hatfield notes that “sophisticated” readers understand how comics exploit their design and are aware of tensions or possible contradictions between, say, text and image, layout, and reading experience and that there is no “stable\" conception of the page (65). Instead, awareness of tensions “may multiply the number of choices available to the reader and can result in even more intensive questioning of the page” (66). Furthermore, comics “always involves choosing among different options—different strategies of interpretation, different ways of understanding” (66). Even though the design of “Blue Helmet” suggests that “Son ofZoro” can be seen as a “lucky extra\" or a throwaway add-on, it is meant to be read alongside the primary story. Since Tank Girl plays with form frequently, regular readers would intuit this. Moreover, “Son of Zoro” connects to Hewlett and Martin’s transparent opposition to Tank Girl’s accessibility and popularity, as well as ideas about mode of address. It delineates who the comic thinks the reader is before toying with him. It also builds solidarity between Hewlett and Martin and readers who do not see themselves in “Son of Zoro.” Even though numerous popular culture references are included in Tank Girl, very little “girl culture” makes its way into the comics. This criticism of fanboys via “Son of Zoro,” then, could be especially significant for female readers invested in Tank Girl as a character, or even perhaps contending with fanboys in the real world. At minimum, female readers would feel seen and included.\n\nPart of the pleasure of Tank Girl is that she consistently conquers men who underestimate and undermine her. Moments in which the authors also make fun of their readers contribute to this pleasure and reinforce the feeling that this story world is, without question, Tank Girl’s dominion. Her desires and decisions drive the jokes and narrative, and the playfulness between text and visuals allows readers to fetishize her while simultaneously making fun of them for doing so. It does not matter that she does not have a true superpower; her superpower is her irreverence toward men, what Sergeant in “Tank Girl Chapter Three: Big Mouth Strikes Again” calls her “stagnant lack of respect\" (31). Her smarts, her tank, and her body are her tools for winning every time. Although the Tank Girl comics are full of the male gaze, Hewlett and Martin’s multifaceted approach, visually, narratively, and otherwise, made the character larger than the world she inhabits on the page, if not too big for it. For readers in the 1990s who needed to see her as such, Tank Girl outshined those elements of the comic that speak to male desires. Although many contemporary readers want to believe female characters are now permitted to have power, menstruate, be funny, enjoy sex, and express negative emotions, the truth is. Tank Girl still resonates. Perhaps it is the desire for a female character who always has the quickest wit and full bodily autonomy that endures. Certainly Tank Girl’s ability to enjoy everything that everyone says is bad for her continues providing respite for girls needing a break from the patriarchy.\n\nNotes\n\n1 From “Tank Girl in Ball Hanger.\"\n\n2 See Sara Marcus’s book Girls to the Prout: The True Story of the Riot Grrrl Revolution (2010).\n\n3 Tank Girl’s continued influence can be seen in other forms of popular culture as well, including Avril Lavigne’s Rock N Roll music video (2013), the Funosa character in Mad Max: Fury Road (2015), Grimes’s Kill V. Maim music video (2016), and Bo Peep in Toy Story 4 (2019). Margot Robbie’s production company LuckyChap Entertainment in fall 2019 also announced development of a new lank Girl film, with Robbie expected to play the title character.\n\n4 It could be argued that not much has changed. Certainly my own experiences visiting comic books stores are not consistently inviting or comfortable.\n\n5 It would be remiss to call Tank Girl an action “hero,” as she is more of an antihero. She lacks a moral compass and acts impulsively based on spontaneous desire. Though she may be likeable at times, she is also frequently unlikable, as when she uses her girlfriends or Booga as literal punching bags and targets of verbal abuse.\n\n6 Neither Tank Girl One nor The Hole of Tank Girl has page numbers, and the Table of Contents of 7 he Hole of Tank Girl is incorrect, going up to page 331 before starting over again at page 320. I have done my best to number pages tor inclusion, but I am also including issue titles, which may be an easier way to locate examples.\n\n7 Hopey’s look changes numerous times throughout Love and Rockets, but there is a clear connection between the skinhead iteration of Hopey and Tank Girl’s early look.\n\n8 I would argue that Rachel Talalay’s Tank Girl film continually plays with and subverts the male gaze, as it uses cinematography and editing to pull viewers in only to thwart their expectations. Like the meta-moments of the comics, often the joke is on the audience, who has been trained by Hollywood to believe male desire will be fulfilled. For example, in one scene with the Rippers, audiences are set up to believe Tank Girl and Jet Girl are going to strip. Cut to jazz music over a black velvet painting of a naked woman that tilts down to Tank and Jet working, fully clothed. Scholars also often analyze the shower scene as an example of the male gaze in the film. However, Tank Girl \"showers” fully clothed in sand. Little could be less sexy, which is the joke.\n\n9 They also mention the male audience was “disturbed” when numerous skinhead lesbians showed up for a Tank Girl lookalike contest (39—40).\n\nWorks Cited\n\nChute, Hillary.
