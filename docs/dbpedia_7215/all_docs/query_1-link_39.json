        "text": "Tank Girl is a 1995 motion picture based on English comic series drawn by Jamie Hewlett and written by Alan C. Martin.\n\nIn 2033, justice rides a tank and wears lip gloss.\n\nTank Girl\n\n[edit]\n\nIt hasn't rained in 11 years! Now, 20 people gotta squeeze inside the same bathtub. So it ain't all bad.\n\nOh, I was just thinkin' about leavin' this place. It's been swell, but the swelling's gone down.\n\nYou gotta think about it like the first time you got laid... You just gotta go, \"Daddy? Are you sure this is right?\"\n\n[Sitting on the barrel of her tank gun, Tank Girl pulls alongside the arms truck drivers.] Feelin' a little inadequate?\n\nNOW! EVERYBODY drop your gunsâ€¦ or I scrape off all her make-up. [She moves in on the Madam's face with a razor, then pulls back in disgust.] This might take me a really long time.\n\n[as Muhammed Ali] Oh, I'm so pretty. I'm-a gonna hit you so hard, your children will be born bruised!\n\nDialogue\n\n[edit]\n\nTank Girl: [to Sergeant Small] Quit pickin' on my girlfriend!\n\n[kisses Jet Girl]\n\nSergeant Small: Ugh... shit! God, that is..\n\n[he leaves in disgust]\n\nJet Girl: Thanks, I think it worked.\n\nTank Girl: [grinning] What worked?\n\nT-Saint: I say we kill 'em!\n\nDonner: I say we hump 'em.\n\nBooga: I say we eat crumpets and tea.\n\nDeetee: Tasty! Crumpets and tea. All in favor of crumpets and tea, say \"aye\".\n\nRippers: Aye!\n\nT-Saint: Shut up! Ain't gonna be no crumpets and tea.\n\nTank Girl: Who'd you used to be?\n\nT-Saint: A cop.\n\nTank Girl: Figures.\n\n[to Tank Girl and Jet Girl]\n\nDeetee: Okay, we're gonna give you babes a chance to prove yourselves. Call it an initiation.\n\nT-Saint: You fail, you die!\n\nDonner: Yeah, but first, you gotta strip.\n\nBooga: That's not in the plan.\n\nDeetee, T-Saint, Donner: Why not?\n\nDonner: And these are so you can hear us. [to Tank Girl] This one's for you. [to Jet Girl] And this one... I made especially for you. Let me help you put it on 'cause it's kinda tricky...\n\n[Donner 'accidentally' drops it down her shirt and fumbles for it]\n\nI'm sorry. How clumsy of me.\n\nJet Girl: Get off!\n\nDonner: It was hard to clip on.\n\n[Tank Girl and Jet Girl are captured and gassed with Nitrous Oxide by the Rippers.]\n\nT-Saint: How much are they paying you?\n\nTank Girl:[laughing maniacally] Two dollars and fifteen cents!!\n\n[Tank Girl and Booga are lying together]\n\nBooga: See, it's one of Johnny Prophet's dreams. See how the people are all free, and the water just comes down from the sky and it don't cost nothin'. With flowers, and rainbows...\n\nTank Girl: It's beautiful...\n\n[Jet Girl has a gun pointed at Small's head]\n\nSergeant Small: Fuck me...\n\nJet Girl: How many times do I have to tell you? I don't want to.\n\nWikipedia has an article about:\n\nTank Girl quotes at the Internet Movie Database"
