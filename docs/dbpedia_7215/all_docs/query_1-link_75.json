        "text": "I did a long post at the end of the year with mini-reviews of everything I‚Äôd read in 2015 (you can see that post HERE). I posted it New Year‚Äôs Day so it got very little action as I suppose everyone was hungover. üòâ I plan to re-post a few of those mini-reviews of my favorites from that list. I‚Äôll post the original but will add a little more as some were only a few sentences.\n\nIn the case of Tank Girl, I‚Äôve since seen the movie. Um. Urgh‚Ä¶. The film is, shall we say, not as good as the book?!? (Unlike Tank Girl, I‚Äôm being really f*%king polite by saying that). But I‚Äôll be posting a review of the movie tomorrow ‚Äì for now let‚Äôs talk about the Tank Girl graphic novel.\n\nTank Girl by Jamie Hewlett and Alan Martin\n\nWhat It‚Äôs About: (via Wikipedia)\n\nThe eponymous character Tank Girl (Rebecca Buck) drives a tank, which is also her home. She undertakes a series of missions for a nebulous organization before making a serious mistake and being declared an outlaw for her sexual inclinations and her substance abuse. The comic centres on her misadventures with her boyfriend, Booga, a mutant kangaroo.\n\nMy Thoughts:\n\nThis is the second (of two!) graphic novels that I‚Äôve read (the other being Watchmen). Wait ‚Äì is this a graphic novel? It‚Äôs more of a collection of several comics‚Ä¶ I think?? Is there a difference?\n\nThis sort of thing is something I have NO knowledge in but I have to say that I did enjoy Tank Girl. She‚Äôs a cool character and I really appreciated the (inappropriate) humor (it took me a while to read it all as I had to keep putting it away someplace where my young daughter wouldn‚Äôt grab it). I mean, Tank Girl has sex with a kangaroo. Whaaaat? It‚Äôs pretty damn bizarre but it‚Äôs fun and I was entertained.\n\nWhat I didn‚Äôt talk about in my mini-review was why I decided to read Tank Girl. My hubby bought it years ago and it had always been sitting in our bookcase (with that exact blue cover up there) but it wasn‚Äôt until last year when I‚Äôd run out of things to read that I decided to ask him about it as I did like the look of that image on the cover.\n\nTo be honest, although I hadn‚Äôt seen the movie, it looked really bad & was trashed by critics so I never gave the comic much thought. Well, hubby was all ‚Äúyou know why you‚Äôre drawn to that cover? Because its co-creator (Jamie Hewlett) also created Gorillaz with Damon Albarn‚Äù. That convinced me to finally check it out as I LOVE the band Gorillaz! I‚Äôve always thought their virtual cartoon band was a brilliant idea (helped by the fact that the music was equally as cool as the band members Hewlett designed) and I‚Äôve never understood why they weren‚Äôt absolutely huge in every country. Here they are:\n\nAnyway, as for Tank Girl, I loved its ‚Äúattitude‚Äù and the fact that the title character does NOT give a fuck. She‚Äôs violent, irresponsible, alcoholic, surprisingly dumb, and her boyfriend is a kangaroo yet you can‚Äôt help but like her. The ‚Äústorylines‚Äù are all over the place (kind of like the inside of the character‚Äôs mind, I suppose) but I didn‚Äôt care as it was, overall, a funny & enjoyable read. I don‚Äôt exactly know if I can recommend it, though, as it‚Äôs not for everyone. It would really need to be your type of thing if you‚Äôre going to check it out but I‚Äôm glad that I finally did."
