Set tracks to a futuristic Australia, loaded with wild adventure and armed to the teeth with the antics of Lori Petty, Malcolm McDowell, Naomi Watts, and Ice-T as a f**king Kangaroo! We’ve bolstered this bad boy with all NEW interviews and video essays with Actor Doug Jones and Alex Heller-Nicholas.\n\nThe year is 2033 and since a humongous meteor hit the earth, the world just hasn't been the same. No movies, no cable television, no water! A mega-villain, Kesslee (Malcolm McDowell), the leader of Water & Power, holds the world in his grasp since he controls all the water ... or so he thinks. Two colossal enemies stand in his way: (1) The Rippers - an army of half-men/half-kangaroo people whose sole purpose is to bring down Water & Power and (2) a chick with a tank and tons of attitude - aka Tank Girl (Lori Petty). Kesslee had better get a grip on reality and his water jugs because not even a run in her stockings is going to stop her from saving the world!\n\nDirector: Rachel Talalay\n\nCast: Ice-T; Iggy Pop; Lori Petty; Malcolm McDowell; Naomi Watts\n\nExtras:"
