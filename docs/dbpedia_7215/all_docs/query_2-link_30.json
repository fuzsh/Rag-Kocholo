        "text": "There are too many!\n\nMaybe you heard, but this Friday Iron Man 2 comes out. Last Friday, Paper Man was released. February had The Wolfman; March, Repo Man. At the tail end of 2009, A Serious Man and A Single Man joined the Oscar race. Later this year, there will be Solitary Man, Extra Man and the documentary Winnebago Man. Well, gee, that’s a whole lot of movies with the word man in the title! While this naming convention — Random-Descriptive Man — isn’t new (The Thin Man, The Third Man), it sure seems like it’s turning up more than usual. Because it is!\n\n2010 has had by far the most Random-Descriptive Man movies of any year since 1990, and over those twenty years, the convention has become more prevalent generally. (This is counting movies that you might have heard of, not ones that were never widely released.) Plus, to add a little dose of lady-criticism, we checked how many Random-Descriptive Woman movies have been made in the same period. Guess what? Not very many! Maybe Wonder Woman, possibly, finally coming to a theater in 2011, will help rectify the gender inequity in movie titles. (Which, no joke, is real: check out all the Random-Descriptive Wife and Random-Descriptive Girl movies there have been.)\n\n2010\n\nMan Movies: 7, The Wolf Man, Repo Man, Paper Man, Solitary Man, Iron Man 2, Extra Man, Winnebago Man\n\nWoman Movies: 0\n\nGirl/Wife Movies: 1, Exploding Girl\n\n2009\n\nMan Movies: 2, A Single Man, A Serious Man\n\nWoman Movies: 0\n\nGirl/Wife Movies: 2, The Time Traveler’s Wife, The Astronaut’s Wife\n\n2008\n\nMan Movies: 3, Iron Man, Yes Man, The Other Man\n\nWoman Movies: 0\n\nGirl/Wife Movies: 3, My Best Friend’s Girl, The Other Boleyn Girl, Kit Kitteridge: An American Girl\n\n2007\n\nMan Movies: 1, Spider-Man 3\n\nWoman Movies: 0\n\nGirl/Wife Movies: 0\n\n2006\n\nMan Movies: 3, Wicker Man, Inside Man, Little Man\n\nWoman Movies: 0\n\nGirl/Wife Movies: 2, Factory Girl, The Dead Girl\n\n2005\n\nMan Movies: 5, Cinderella Man, The Weather Man, The Perfect man, The Man, Gingerbread Man\n\nWoman Movies: 0\n\nGirl/Wife Movies: 0\n\n2004\n\nMan Movies: 1, Spider-Man 2\n\nWoman Movies: 2, A Good Woman, Catwoman\n\nGirl/Wife Movies: 1, Jersey Girl\n\n2003\n\nMan Movies: 0\n\nWoman Movies: 0\n\nGirl/Wife Movies: 0\n\n2002\n\nMan Movies, 1 Spider-Man\n\nWoman Movies: 0\n\nGirl/Wife Movies: The Good Girl\n\n2001\n\nMan Movies: 1, Harvard Man\n\nWoman Movies: 0\n\nGirl/ Wife Movies: 1, Birthday Girl\n\n2000\n\nMan Movies: 4, Family Man, Hollow Man, The Ladies Man, Company Man\n\nWoman Movies: 0\n\nGirl/Wife Movies: 0\n\n1999\n\nMan Movies: 3, Bicentennial Man, The Best Man, The Minus Man\n\nWoman Movies: 1, The 24 Hour Woman\n\nGirl/Wife Movies: 0\n\n1998\n\nMan Movies: 1, The Gingerbread Man\n\nWoman Movies: 0\n\nGirl/Wife Movies: 0\n\n1997\n\nMan Movies: 1, The Sixth Man\n\nWoman Movies: 0\n\nGirl/Wife Movies: 0\n\n1996\n\nMan Movies: 1, Glimmer Man\n\nWoman Movies: 0\n\nGirl/ Wife Movies: 2, The Preacher’s Wife, The Rich Man’s Wife\n\n1995\n\nMan Movies: 1, Dead Man\n\nWoman Movies: 0\n\nGirl/ Wife Movies: 2, Tank Girl, Party Girl\n\n1994\n\nMan Movies: 1, Renaissance Man\n\nWoman Movies: 0\n\nGirl/ Wife Movies: 1, My Girl 2\n\n1993\n\nMan Movies: 2, Meteor Man, Demolition Man\n\nWoman Movies: 1, A Dangerous Woman\n\nGirl/Wife Movies: 0\n\n1992\n\nMan Movies: 3, Encino Man, The Lawnmower Man, Medicine Man\n\nWoman Movies: 0\n\nGirl/Wife Movies: 0\n\n1991\n\nMan Movies: 1, The Marrying Man\n\nWoman Movies: 0\n\nGirl/Wife Movies: 2, My Girl, The Butcher’s Wife"
