        "text": "Based on Britons’ Jamie Hewlett and Alan Martin‘s wildly subversive comic-strip, Lori Petty stars in director Rachel Talalay‘s futuristic feminist sci-fi vult action-fantasy about a tank-riding anti-heroine, TANK GIRL\n\nIn the year 2033 – when drought and pollution have turned the Earth into a desert wasteland – the planet’s water supply is controlled by a despotic company that is opposed by a few courageous rebels who regularly risk their lives to poach the precious fluid. With resources scarce, Kesslee (Malcolm McDowell) — head of the powerful and evil Water & Power Corporation, the de facto government — has taken control of the water supply. Unwilling to cower under Kesslee’s tyrannical rule, a pair of outlaws known as Tank Girl (Petty) and Jet Girl (Naomi Watts) rise up, joining the mysterious rebel Rippers to destroy the corrupt system. Also starring Ice-T and Iggy Pop.\n\n“I loved this movie. I thought it was quite irreverent. A lot of movies try to be irreverent, but really aren’t. This was! It was original and fresh and the dialogue was funny.” (L.A. Weekly)\n\n“Lori Petty turns our Tank Girl into a woman for all seasons and reasons — Germaine Greer’s brains and Camille Paglia’s bravado and Dirty Harriet’s brawn…Man or woman — looking out the tumescent barrel of Tank Girl, you can’t help but feel a little uplifted.” (Globe and Mail)\n\n“With climate change going unchecked and drinking water shortages abounding, ‘Tank Girl’ predicted a totally possible post-apocalypse scenario.” (Black Girl Nerds)\n\nFriday, September 8\n\nDoors 8:10 pm | Movie 8:40 pm *Start times subject to change. Please arrive on time.\n\nAdvance tickets HERE\n\nTANK GIRL (Rachel Talalay, 1995 / 104 mins / PG) A girl is among the few survivors of a dystopian Earth. Riding a war tank, she fights against the tyranny of a mega-corporation that dominates the remaining potable water supply of the planet."
