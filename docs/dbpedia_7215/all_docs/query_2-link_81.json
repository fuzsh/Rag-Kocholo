        "text": "Typically, Hulu and all of the other major streamers lose a lot of titles at the end of the month. That’s just the reality of the streaming era, where even movies that belong to the studios won’t stay put on their outlets. But in August, Hulu is barely losing any titles at all. Given the constant turnover we normally get, this has to be considered a win for subscribers.\n\nAs an added bonus, most of the impending departures aren’t exactly critical favorites. Few will likely miss the poorly-reviewed Polaroid or Beautiful Disaster. But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t stay on top of what’s leaving Hulu in August. Almost every movie has the potential to be someone’s favorite, so you should make sure that your picks aren’t on the list. As usual, our favorite picks for the month are in bold.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nThis is also a great time to consider the Disney Bundle, which gets you Hulu, Disney+, and ESPN+ for just $14 per month. That’s basically like getting all three services, but only paying for two of them, and it’s pretty tough to beat. It’s also a great way to make sure you don’t miss anything on any of these services.\n\nTrying to catch all the best films and shows before they become unavailable at the end of the month?
