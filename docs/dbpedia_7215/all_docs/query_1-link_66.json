        "text": "Well that was quick. We just learned that Margot Robbie‘s production company, LuckyChap Entertainment, was developing a new film version of ‘Tank Girl’, and now it has been revealed that Miles Joris-Peyrafitte will direct. Joris-Peyrafitte directed Robbie in this year’s thriller ‘Dreamland’. Robbie will produce with her LuckyChap partners Tom Ackerley and Josey McNamara, and although it wasn’t clear at the time of the first announcement, it looks as though Robbie plans to star in this film.\n\n(Not to just automatically bitch like everyone else on the internet, but doesn’t she already play that exact same character as Harley Quinn in the DCEU?)\n\nNews of this film reboot was revealed when Alan Martin, who co-created the ‘Tank Girl’ comic books with Jamie Hewlett, posted the information on Twitter, along with the fact that he had not been contacted to consult on this project.\n\n‘Tank Girl’ is set in a Mad Max-ish post-apocalyptic desert wasteland, where the title character, a tank driver, performs missions for a shadowy organization before being branded an outlaw and going on the run. The movie adaptation was directed by Rachel Talalay and released in 1995. Lori Petty played the lead, and the cast also included Malcolm McDowell as the corporate CEO villain, Kesslee, who controls the little water that still exists; Naomi Watts who portrayed fellow freedom fighter, Jet Girl; and Ice-T, who portrayed mutant kangaroo Ripper T-Saint. Though the film was a box office disaster, making only $6 million on a budget of $25 million, critics have praised the film for its feminist themes and punk rock aesthetic (borrowed from the comics).\n\nReportedly, Jet Girl will also appear in this new version, and the plot will be similar, with Tank Girl leading a few insurgents in attempting to reclaim the scarce water supply from the ruling corporation.\n\nIn addition to starring in Joris-Peyrafitte’s ‘Dreamland’, Robbie acted as producer, so this looks like a strong re-teaming.\n\nCheck back for updates as they become available. Are you intrigued to see Robbie star as ‘Tank Girl’?"
