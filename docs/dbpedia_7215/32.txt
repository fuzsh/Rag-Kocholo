Brought to the screen by director Rachel Talalay (Freddy’s Dead: The Final Nightmare) and starring Lori Petty (Point Break) in its title role, Tank Girl is a slice of post-apocalyptic science fiction – and a bonafide cult classic – adapted from the hit comic strip created by Alan Martin and Jamie Hewlett.

The year is 2033, and the people of Earth have been suffering through a drought for over a decade. The planet’s water supply is now controlled by megalomaniac businessman Kesslee (Malcolm McDowell), the owner of the Water & Power corporation. But in Australia, at least, there is resistance. If Kesslee wants to take control of the last water well in the Outback, he’ll need to contend with the Rippers – mutant hybrids of human and kangaroo – and Rebecca Buck, alias Tank Girl (Petty): a woman with a tank, a bad attitude, and a determination to rescue the world from the brink of oblivion.

First published by the British comics magazine Deadline in 1988, Tank Girl began life as a comic strip before becoming a cult phenomenon in the 1990s. In 1995, the central character starred in a new run of stories under DC Comics’ Vertigo imprint and this big-screen adaptation, which formed one part of a boom in comic book movies that also included The Shadow, Judge Dredd and The Phantom. Eureka Classics is proud to present this limited edition of the film on Blu-ray for the first time in the UK.
