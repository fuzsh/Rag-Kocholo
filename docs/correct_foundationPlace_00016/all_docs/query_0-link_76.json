Other people supplied us with information about who we were and should be. It became more important to be compliant or avoidant rather than to be authentic, and we adopted rigid beliefs about what “should be.” We believed that if we could just “get it right,” things would be okay. When we “got it wrong,” our sense of security and self-worth evaporated.\n\nWe find by working the Steps and Traditions, we find the strength to be that which God intended, Precious & Free, with healthy, loving relationships. We find the Promises coming true, one day at a time.\n\nTwelve Steps\n\nTwelve Traditions\n\nTwelve Promises\n\nTwelve Service Concepts\n\nWe find by working the Steps and Traditions, we find the strength to be that which God intended, Precious & Free, with healthy, loving relationships.

There is only one requirement to join; a desire for healthy and loving relationships. Your first meeting will introduce you to The Twelve Steps, The Twelve Traditions, The Promises and more. These are the foundation of our program, and you will come to find great comfort in them, one day at a time as you walk the path of recovery from codependence."
