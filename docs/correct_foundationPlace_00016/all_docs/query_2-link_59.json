The Professional Services Division will operate as a separate business unit of Caldera, to provide services to meet the Internet and eBusiness infrastructure needs of customers. The new company will offer the industry's first comprehensive Open Internet Platform (OIP) combining Linux and UNIX server solutions and services globally. The OIP provides commercial customers and developers with a single platform that can scale from the thinnest of clients to the clustering needs of the largest data center. The Open Internet Platform combines the robust scalability of the UNIX system with the low-cost, developer-accepted Linux operating system. The products, solutions, and services developed for the Open Internet Platform will be available through more than 15,000 partners worldwide. Details of the Agreement Caldera Systems, Inc. will form a new holding company, Caldera, Inc., to acquire assets from the SCO Server Software Division plus the SCO Professional Services Division, including a highly skilled workforce, products and channel resources. Caldera, Inc. will have exclusive distribution rights for the SCO OpenServer product line, and is fully committed to servicing and supporting the SCO OpenServer customer base. SCO will receive 28% of Caldera, Inc., which is estimated to be an aggregate of approximately 17.54 million shares of Caldera stock (including approximately 2 million shares reserved for employee options assumed by Caldera for options currently held by SCO employees joining Caldera), and $7 million in cash. In conjunction with the acquisition, The Canopy Group, Inc., a major stockholder of Caldera Systems, Inc., has agreed to loan $18 million to SCO. SCO will retain its Tarantella Division, and the SCO OpenServer revenue stream and intellectual properties. Revenues for SCO OpenServer were $11.1 million in Q3 of FY2000. Net proceeds to SCO after expenses will be approximately 55% of future SCO OpenServer revenues. The investment banking firms of Chase H&Q and Broadview respectively, assisted SCO and Caldera Systems, Inc., in evaluting this acquisition. Caldera, Inc. will be headquartered in Orem, Utah, with locations worldwide. The boards of directors of both companies have unanimously approved the acquisition which is subject to the approval of Caldera Systems, Inc. and The Santa Cruz Operation, Inc. stockholders, and regulatory agencies, as well as meeting certain other closing conditions. The companies anticipate closing the transaction during October, 2000. Following the completion of the acquisition, Ransom Love, current president and CEO of Caldera Systems, Inc. will become CEO of Caldera, Inc., and David McCrabb, current president of the SCO Server Software Division, will become president and COO of Caldera, Inc. Jim Wilt, current president of the SCO Professional Services Division will become president of the newly formed Caldera Services Division. Doug Michels, president and CEO of The Santa Cruz Operation, Inc., will join the Caldera, Inc. board of directors. SCO will also appoint a second representative to the board of Caldera, Inc. Industry Impact \"This acquisition is an industry-changing event that puts Caldera front and center as the answer to the enterprise question,\" said Ransom Love, President and CEO of Caldera Systems, Inc. \"Caldera will further broaden and validate both the Linux and UNIX industries and communities, by providing open access to its unified Linux and UNIX technologies, and by offering support, training and professional services to customers worldwide. Caldera is fully committed to supporting and servicing the SCO OpenServer and UnixWare communities.\" Together, technologies from Caldera Systems and the SCO Server Software and Professional Services Divisions will provide enterprise-class solutions with worldwide support and distribution infrastructure. \"The new company will be a very strong entity that we believe will compete successfully on a worldwide basis, \"said David McCrabb, president of the SCO Server Software Division. \"Caldera, Inc. will incorporate a worldwide network of sales and support offices, a strong commercial UNIX system business, and a rapidly growing open source company. This combination will be a force to contend with in the worldwide market for Internet solutions on high volume platforms.\" \"Businesses implementing eBusiness or other Internet based customer interaction systems will benefit greatly from the Open Internet Platform,\" said Jim Wilt, president of the SCO Professional Services Division. \"Linux and UNIX technologies are cornerstones providing solutions to problems that businesses face every day.\" \"This transaction enables us to invest in the exciting growth opportunities we see for Tarantella,\" said Doug Michels, CEO of The Santa Cruz Operation, Inc. \"This growth is fueled by increasing business use of the Internet, by the continued attractiveness of thin-client computing, and by the accelerating adoption of the Application Service Provider (ASP) business model.\" Forum 2000 Caldera Systems will join SCO in hosting Forum 2000, to be held August 20-23, at the University of California, Santa Cruz.
