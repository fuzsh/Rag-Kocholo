        "text": "\"International institutions have been at the forefront of global advancement ever since the sovereign states decided to cooperate for common good instead of battling it out every time they felt the need to express themselves. Shanghai Cooperation Organisation is yet another example of regional cooperation relying upon well established institutional framework of normative mutual cooperation. As a member of international institutions family it deserves a well balanced analytical analysis of its role and functions.\"---Aleksandr Popov, Lektor/Lecturer, Juhtimise teaduskond/Department of Management, Estonian Business School\n\n\"SCO is an international institution existing in the cloud of misperceptions hardened into stereotypes and myths. This volume dispels the cloud and reveals the horizons of the SCO’s progress.\"---E. Troitskiy, Professor, Doctor of Sciences (Historty), University of Tomsk, Russia\n\n\"As an excellent collective work accomplished by outstanding scholars from SCO member states, this book reviews the history of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization since 2001, concentrates on economic, humanitarian, legal, trade, labor, migrant, and environmental issues of SCO, and explores its future development. The greatest feature of the book is that it integrates the views of scholars from member States and widens the perspective of observation, which help deepen our understanding of SCO and its future. In short, this book is full of insight and enlightenment, and is worth reading by everyone interested in SCO.\"---Ruan Jianping, Professor, Vice-dean, Political Science and Administration School, Wuhan University, China\n\n\"A very timely and valuable monograph by an outstanding team of scholars. The world politics is going through serious processes of transformation and paradigm shifts in the balance of power, this leads to sharp increase in the role of regional instruments of cooperation, such as SCO. The authors cover most of the aspects of cooperation within the SCO (from security to transport and logistics) and also give some critique to the organization’s law-making and activity in the geopolitical sphere. The latter is helpful to define the ways to enhance the capacity and political role of SCO in the future.\"---Anna Kondratyuk, Professor, PhD in International Law, Associate Professor, Rushford Business School, SSBM-Swiss School of Business and Management, Geneva"
