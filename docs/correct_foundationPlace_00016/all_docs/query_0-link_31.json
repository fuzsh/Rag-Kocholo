IBM in New York\n\nBoston, MA, USA - Friday, January 2, 2004 - The Free Software Foundation (FSF) will host two seminars on Free Software Licensing and the GNU GPL and a series of conversations with Professor Eben Moglen on the SCO v. IBM lawsuit. These events will take place at Columbia Law School in New York City on January 20 and 21, 2004.\n\nIn the last few months, the Santa Cruz Organization Group (SCO) has been sowing confusion and misinformation regarding the validity of the GNU General Public License (GPL) as part of their strategy to extort money from users of the kernel named Linux, which is licensed under FSF's GPL. These seminars and discussions will present the facts about the license from FSF, its creators, who authored the license in 1989. Today, the GNU GPL is the most popular and widely used Free Software copyright license.\n\nThe seminars will provide detailed study and analysis of the GPL, review GPL enforcement cases handled by FSF's GPL Compliance Laboratory, and consider legal ethics in Free Software Licensing. Daniel Ravicher, Senior Counsel to FSF, and Bradley M. Kuhn, Executive Director of FSF, will lead the seminars.\n\nThe first seminar, \"Detailed Study and Analysis of GPL and LGPL\", held on January 20, 2004, will give a section-by-section explanation of the GPL, and will educate lawyers, software developers, managers and business people on how to use the GPL (and GPL'd software) successfully in new Free Software businesses and in existing, successful enterprises.\n\nThe second seminar, \"GPL Compliance Case Studies and Legal Ethics in Free Software Licensing\" held on January 21, 2004, will present the details of a few different GPL compliance cases handled by FSF's GPL Compliance Laboratory. Each case offers unique insights into problems that arise when the terms of the GPL are not properly followed, and how diplomatic negotiation between the violator and the copyright holder can yield positive results for both parties. This seminar also includes a unit on the ethical considerations for attorneys who want to represent clients that make, use, or sell Free Software products.\n\nFSF will also host \"SCO Without Fear\", a series of two lunchtime conversations with Professor Eben Moglen, who serves on FSF's Board and as its General Counsel. He will discuss the SCO v. IBM lawsuit and SCO's attacks on Free Software, and their implications for the development and use of Free Software. Some of Prof. Moglen's earlier writings on the SCO v. IBM lawsuit can be found at http://www.fsf.org/philosophy/sco/sco.html. These conversations will also be held on January 20-21, 2004 at Columbia University in New York.\n\nMore details about these events are available at http://www.fsf.org/licenses/NYC_Seminars_Jan2004.html.\n\nAbout Free Software Foundation:\n\nThe Free Software Foundation, founded in 1985, is dedicated to promoting computer users' right to use, study, copy, modify, and redistribute computer programs.
