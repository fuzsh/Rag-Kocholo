The summit operates within a framework guided by established protocols and procedures, ensuring that discussions and agreements reflect the collective interests and priorities of participating nations. Below is an overview of the organizational structure of the SCO Summit:\n\nHeads of State and Government: At the apex of the organizational structure are the heads of state or government of SCO member states.
