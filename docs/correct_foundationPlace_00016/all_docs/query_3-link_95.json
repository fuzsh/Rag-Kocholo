        "text": "The Allsorts of Spectrum group had a visit from Comic Youth! During this session they crated these cool quick comics where they had a limited amount of time to draw in their square and then had to pass it on to the person next to them to do the next square! There were lots of twists and turns to the stories! Here’s some of the Comics created by the group.\n\nA huge thank you to everyone who made the Pride Edinburgh Youth Space 2024 so amazing!!\n\nWe partnered with Canongate Youth, Lifelong Learning, Totally Sound and Reel Youth Media.\n\n934 people visited us, for live music, delicious food from the Scran Academy, smoothies from the Scouts, stalls from The Junction, Crew, Chalmers, Healthy Respect, Edinburgh Zoo, Edinburgh Uni, (Un)seen, (Un)heard. There was arts and photography, facepainting and an incredible amount of love and joy!!\n\nPride month is over, but the joy from Edinburgh Pride is lingering with me. The past few months have been really hard – but being in the march with thousands of people supporting us, flanked on the pavements with so many more excited to see us? That’s healing, and gives me hope.\n\nAs part of LEAP sports Festival Fortnight the GLOW group in Perth got to visit Willowgate Activity Centre so our young people could try out Archery! Despite some rain we all had a great time!\n\nOur Forth Valley groups were successful in their funding application for LEAPS Festival Fortnights allowing them to have their very own all gender swimming party in the Mariners Centre Falkirk.\n\nWe had 9 young people take part and they all had a brilliant evening. One young person fed back “I never knew I could swim, I’d never done it in the wheelchair. It was good having someone here with that experience to teach me and the lifeguards were helpful for the floaties.”\n\nAs someone who is new to volunteering this was the first time I’ve supported the young people at Edinburgh Pride. It was truly a privilege to walk with them on the March. This year more than ever, we need to stand by young people and support them, by giving them space and opportunities to explore who they are!\n\nLast month, (Un)Seen, (Un)Heard were honoured to be invited to Edinburgh City Chambers to meet the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, and represent the ‘City of Diversity’. We invited along a group of young people and alongside Lavender Menace were delighted to share with Their Royal Highnesses the successes of our project so far, our plans for the amazing Edinburgh 900 project, and why it is so important for our city to protect and celebrate the diversity of Scotland’s young LGBTQ+ young people.\n\nOver the last couple weeks young people from the Allsorts of Spectrum group in Dundee have been designing t-shirts to wear at pride. Some young people choose to paint their t-shirt, other choose to use fabric pens, and some decided to print a design onto their t-shirt which is a technique they learned at a workshop they attended with McManus Galleries. They all came up with their own unique designs and we are looking forward to seeing them at pride!"
