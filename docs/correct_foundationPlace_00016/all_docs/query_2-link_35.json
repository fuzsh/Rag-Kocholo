        "text": "Eventually, despite all the confrontational political scenario - the BJP's pre election campaign that inflamed the tensions in the region - the recent meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the SCO member states witnessed Pakistan's role as a peace-loving state.\n\nThe Council focused on the implementation of the results of the SCO Heads of State Qingdao and the SCO Council of Heads of Government Dushanbe meetings held in 2018.\n\nThe Bishkek Summit of SCO took place at the most critical time of contemporary world.\n\nHe said the SCO states must synergize the various region-wide connectivity initiatives and work on complementing infrastructure connectivity with soft connectivity, including digital, cultural, touristic and academic.\n\nHe proposed setting up SCO Culture and Tourism Corridors, clustering multiple SCO destinations into a single package.\n\nImran emphasised on making the SCO more relevant to the daily lives of citizens by promoting food security and enhancing cooperation in health and humanitarian sectors.\n\nOn 23 September 2003, the meeting of the heads of government of the SCO countries in Beijing adopted the long-term program of multilateral economic cooperation until 2020.\n\nJointly organized by SCO Secretariat in Beijing and the current rotating president of the SCO Youth Council, Kyrgyzstan and aided by the SCO Countries Youth League (SCOLAR), the event saw hundreds of young leaders and volunteers from all the 18 SCO countries- eight members states, four observers and six dialogue partners - descending on the port city to put up a unified stand against the global menace.\n\nIt was also the first ever SCO meeting held in Pakistan since it became a member of the organisation in June 2017.\n\nIran has officially applied for membership in SCO while it is present in the organization as an observer state, Khaji noted.\n\nDuring the moot, the legal experts will discuss terrorist threats being faced by the region and ways and means to enhance counter-terrorism cooperation between SCO member states."
