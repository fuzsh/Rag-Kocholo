SCO's corporate headquarters are in Santa Cruz, California, with sales offices in more than 80 countries.\n\n1979 - SCO founded by Doug and Larry Michels as a UNIX� system porting and consulting company.\n\n1983 - SCO delivers the first packaged UNIX System (called SCO� XENIX� System V) for Intel� 8086 and 8088 processor-based PCs. It provides small businesses with the first affordable business-critical computing system.\n\n1984 - SCO creates a two-tier channel model for distributing general-purpose operating systems worldwide. SCO works with distributors, resellers, application developers, and computer manufacturers to build what is now a $4 billion market for Intel processor based solutions that run SCO server software.\n\n1985 - SCO delivers SCO XENIX 286 for Intel 80286 processor-based systems. SCO XENIX 286 delivers on SCO's commitment to \"upward compatibility,\" the ability of an operating system to run applications developed on earlier versions (in this case, SCO XENIX System V).\n\n1986 - SCO acquires division of Logica Ltd in UK, creating first SCO European headquarters.\n\n1986 - SCO establishes SCO XENIX 286 as the first OEM \"reference sell\" model for unbundled UNIX Systems - computer manufacturers recommend SCO XENIX 286 to customers who want to run a UNIX System on their computers.\n\n1987 - SCO hosts the \"386 Summit\" in San Francisco, the first gathering of computing manufacturers and software developers to preview the new era of 32-bit business computing on the Intel hardware platform.\n\n1987 - SCO hosts the first SCO Forum conference (called that year \"The SCO XENIX 386 Developer Conference\"). This unique educational conference for the international UNIX systems community is held each summer on the redwood-forested campus of the University of California at Santa Cruz, overlooking Monterey Bay.\n\n1987 - SCO ships SCO XENIX 386, the first 32-bit operating system (and first UNIX System) for Intel 386 processor-based systems.\n\n1989 - SCO ships SCO� UNIX� System V/386, the first volume commercial product licensed by AT&T to use the UNIX System trademark.\n\n1989 - SCO introduces SCO� Open Desktop�, the first 32-bit graphical user interface for UNIX Systems running on Intel processor-based computers.\n\n1990 - SCO acquires HCR, establishing SCO Canada.\n\n1990 - SCO delivers SCO� MPX™, the first packaged software to support the new Intel multiprocessor-based computers.\n\n1992 - SCO launches SCO OpenServer™ family of operating system products.\n\n1993 - SCO goes public on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange with ticker symbol, SCOC.\n\n1993 - SCO acquires IXI, establishing SCO's Cambridge development center.\n\n1994 - SCO acquires Visionware and establishes Leeds office in UK.\n\n1994 - SCO co-hosts the First International Conference on the World-Wide Web in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\n1995 - SCO delivers the first commercially distributed web browser, IXI Mosaic, licensed from NCSA.\n\n1995 - SCO acquires UNIX System source technology business from Novell Corporation (which had acquired it from AT&T's UNIX System Laboratories). SCO also acquires the UnixWare� 2 operating system from Novell.\n\n1996 - SCO launches first initiative of computer vendors to establish a standard UNIX system for volume Intel processor-based servers in the enterprise - the Big E initiative.\n\n1997 - SCO introduces Tarantella� web-enabling software, providing centralized deployment and management of server-based applications across the web.\n\n1997 - SCO delivers the first clustering solution for Intel processor-based servers.\n\n1998 - SCO delivers UnixWare 7 operating system, the most advanced server operating system for Intel processors.\n\n1998 - SCO launches the first initiative by computer vendors to establish a standard UNIX System for Intel processor-based servers in the data center - the Data Center Initiative.\n\n1998 - Project Monterey: SCO and IBM, with the support of Intel agree to develop a high-volume enterprise UNIX system for Intel IA-32 and IA-64 systems. The result will be a single product line that will run on IA-32, IA-64 and IBM microprocessor systems that range from entry-level servers to large enterprise environments.\n\n1998 - SCO delivers UnixWare for Intel's \"Merced\" (BL2) processor, the first stable UNIX System development platform for Intel's IA-64 processor (now called \"Itanium™\").\n\n1999 - SCO delivers UnixWare 7 Release 7.1, featuring new Webtop (based on Tarantella technology), plus new Business and Data Center editions.\n\n1999 - SCO delivers new Appliance Server Technology; Compaq Computer Corporation and Micron Electronics are first strategic OEM customers to use the new technology.\n\n1999 - SCO delivers UnixWare� 7 NonStop� Clusters software for Intel processors.\n\n1999 - SCO launches numerous Open Source initiatives: 1) Offers free Open Source applications and tools to SCO customers; 2) Extends Professional Services to include audits and deployment consultation for customers interested in installing Linux and Open Source technologies; 3) Invests in LinuxMall.com, the leading portal for Linux-related products and services; 4) Enters strategic agreement with TurboLinux to develop services for TurboLinux's TurboCluster Server and provide Linux Professional Services for TurboLinux customers."
