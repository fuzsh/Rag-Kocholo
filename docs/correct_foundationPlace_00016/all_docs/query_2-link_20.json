        "text": "Notable tech companies like Netflix, Texas Instruments, SCO (Santa Cruz Operation), Seagate, and Borland are among the tech companies that started in the Santa Cruz region. Founded in 1963, Plantronics (now known as Ploy) made the first headset used in outer space, and made history when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon and uttered the legendary words: \"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind\" through a Plantronics headset that went on to be worn by astronauts during the NASA shuttle missions.\n\nIn 2008, NextSpace Coworking opened in Downtown Santa Cruz and created a collaborative community that revolutionized the nature of work. In 2010, long-established independent ISP Cruzio opened their own coworking space, CruzioWorks. These spaces changed the game in the way tech companies and entrepreneurs work and connect.\n\nAs a result, Santa Cruz is a hub for freelancers, startups, as well as small to medium-sized companies who take advantage of the lower overhead and invaluable collaborative experience provided by coworking spaces.\n\nEntrepreneurs from those spaces have built successful companies in Downtown and in other areas in the Santa Cruz region. Fast growing startup Looker (acquired by Google Cloud in 2019) established tech companies like ProductOps, FullPower Technologies, and I heart Jane continue to be core tech companies working in the heart of downtown. The future of our tech sector looks bright as interest continues to grow in relocating or launching in an environment that many traditional tech hubs canâ€™t offer."
