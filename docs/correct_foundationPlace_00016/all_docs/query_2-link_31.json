        "text": "SCO Group -- the company behind a number of lawsuits relating Linux -- has filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, a step beyond the more common Chapter 11 bankruptcy status. It's not the end of the road for the much-hated company, but it's close.\n\nSCO Group already filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2007. Chapter 7 is like double secret bankruptcy. As explained by tech law site Groklaw: \"Chapter 11 means you are trying to reorganize and survive as a corporate entity. Chapter 7 means you've given up the ghost and are shutting down.\"\n\nThat's how it usually works, but SCO Group will continue to exist so that it can press on with litigation. Still, no one who SCO owes money to will be paid.\n\nSCO Group, originally known as Caldera, acquired assets of a UNIX vendor called Santa Cruz Operations in 2000. Since 2003, the outfit has sued several companies -- notably IBM, Novell and Red Hat -- claiming that these companies offer Linux distributions that infringe SCO Group's Unix related copyrights.\n\nSCO Group has had little success in court. In 2010, courts ruled in Novell's favor and decided that the rights to Unix never transferred to SCO. Nonetheless, the company moved to reopen the case against IBM again late last year.\n\nImage: Flickr/conveniencestoregourmet\n\nOpenAI Wants AI to Help Humans Train AI\n\nHaving humans rate a language model’s outputs produced clever chatbots.
