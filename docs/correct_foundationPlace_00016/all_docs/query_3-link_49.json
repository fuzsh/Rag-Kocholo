This plan provides services to members through a senior care organization and its network of providers. It combines health services with social support services by coordinating care and specialized geriatric support services, along with respite care for families and caregivers. SCO offers an important advantage for eligible members over traditional fee-for-service care. There are no copays for enrolled members enrolled.\n\nThank you for your website feedback!
