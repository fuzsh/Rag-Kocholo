He has been deeply committed and involved in the healthcare field for over 30 years.\n\nHe started his career as a massage therapist, yoga instructor, and a Holistic Health Educator and Consultant. After suffering severe injuries from a cycling accident in 1979, he came under the care of an osteopathic physician who helped him heal from his injuries and introduced him to the field of Osteopathic Medicine.\n\nUpon completing medical school, Dr. Bernstein specialized in the field of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. In 1995, Dr. Bernstein partnered with Watsonville Hospital to create the Wellness and Rehabilitation Center, the first hospital-based Complementary Alternative Medicine Clinic on the Central Coast of California.
