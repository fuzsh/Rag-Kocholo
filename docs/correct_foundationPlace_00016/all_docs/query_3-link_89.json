        "text": "The Public Land Survey System (PLSS) is Wisconsinâ€™s very first infrastructure and serves as the essential framework for property ownership. Without a properly maintained network of PLSS corner monuments, there is an increased risk of property disputes, inequitable taxation, disagreements about resource rights, confusion over easement locations, and unnecessary expenditures by private citizens and local governments. PLSS is the very foundation for determining the location of nearly every property description in Wisconsin.\n\nWho We Are: The PLSS Workgroup was formed by individuals and organizations in Wisconsin to advocate and advance the purpose and importance of the Public Land Survey System. Our goal is to educate and encourage State, County and Municipal agencies in improving, advancing and maintaining the Public Land Survey System statewide."
