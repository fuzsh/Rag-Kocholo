The SCO has been an observer in the UN General Assembly since 2005 and starting from 2009, the General Assembly has included an item on “Cooperation between the United Nations and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization” on its agenda every other year resulting in a relevant resolution.\n\nIn April 2010, the UN and SCO Secretariats signed the Joint Declaration on Cooperation, which includes information exchange and capacity building. In addition, SCO has also established partnerships with the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), World Trade Organization (WTO), United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), and United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism (UNOCT).\n\nThe UN and the SCO pursued their cooperation, particularly in the area of peace and security, including counter-terrorism and prevention of violent extremism, and sustainable development. The Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs (DPPA), as well as UNRCCA (United Nations Centre for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia) maintain regular contacts with the SCO Secretariat and its Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure in Tashkent.\n\nThe United Nations Secretary-General and other UN high-level representatives regularly attend the SCO Summits.\n\nSince 2017, DPPA has deployed a Liaison Officer to the SCO in Beijing."
