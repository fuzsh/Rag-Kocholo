        "text": "If I’d read this book sooner, I could have wasted so much less of my life failing to understand a very simple truth. So much of what we do in marketing simply starts from the wrong place. A super book! I enjoyed every word.\n\n“Jon Cohen has brought a fabulous dose of common sense, clear thinking and terrific examples to the subject of market research.\n\nAsking for Trouble is inspiring and funny. I found myself nodding along in agreement to Jon’s wisdom and wit. I thoroughly recommend this book.”\n\nThis book should be compulsory for anyone daft enough to think research is about asking questions. I nodded manically and laughed out loud reading Jon’s brilliant, often hilarious, tales of encounters with research respondents whilst in the pursuit of truth. It’s an original and a total joy. I loved it.\n\nIf you’re in the business of asking people what they think, stop reading these words and buy this book immediately. Your job is about to become much more rewarding.\n\nAn incredibly usable field-guide that is also wonderfully readable and intellectually stimulating. Quite a coup!\n\nI came away from it feeling like I do when I have looked at a really high-end cook book from someone like Ottolenghi: I’m glad I’ve read it and understand the complexity of the food. I’m even more glad he has restaurants so I don’t have to try and do this myself!\n\nIf you are even remotely interested in asking questions and/or finding answers, Jon will take you on a fabulous journey- this is his guiding metaphor- to the Land of Asking. He is a warm, witty and insightful guide- perhaps the Michael Palin that market research didn’t know it needed.\n\nAsking for Trouble is a must read for anyone wanting to understand their consumers and customers better. Its packed full of great advice, easy to understand frameworks and Jon’s engaging and entertaining anecdotes from talking to numerous people over the years. Highly recommended.\n\nAsking For Trouble is a Really Good Book. It is an extraordinarily easy read and very human. I would recommend this highly as a touchstone for all levels of marketers."
