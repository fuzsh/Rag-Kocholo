        "text": "Wondering how to become an author? Well, that answer will depend on the type of author you want to be.\n\nMaybe you’ve always been a writer at heart, and are ready to share your story with the world and earn the title of “author.”\n\nOr maybe you’re passionate about a certain topic and are ready to help others by sharing your expertise.\n\nRegardless of your reason – the issue still stands: you want to know how to become an author of a book and a bestselling one at that. So what is an author anyway? And how does becoming an author work?\n\nTo learn how to become an author, the short answer is: You write a book.\n\nSounds simple, right?\n\nBut writing is rarely simple. So, let’s go for the more complex dilemma: How to become an author of a book that actually gets read.\n\nYou want to author a book that’s phenomenal, polished, and packed with content that readers will truly connect with. So how do you do that?\n\nIn this guide, we’ll focus on how to become an author of a book that sells. But before we dive into the steps on how to become an author, it’s important you understand exactly what an author is.\n\nWhat does it mean to become an author?\n\nWhen you learn how to become an author, it means that you ideated, created, and produced a written work, most commonly a book, novel, short story, poem, or other literary work of prose.\n\nTraditionally, an author meant someone who had written a book, and this connotation still stands today, but it has expanded with societal changes. The term author can actually pertain to journalists, essayists, and those in the digital space such as bloggers or article writers.\n\nWriter vs author\n\nWhat’s the difference between a writer and author, you ask? Great question.\n\nWhile writer and author are often used interchangeably, there is definitely a difference between the two. An author is a writer, but a writer isn’t always an author.\n\nHow hard is it to become an author?\n\nWhile the path of learning how to become an author is easier with today’s technology and the rise of self-publishing, learning how to become an author takes determination, hard work, and usually a specific set of skills (which we’ll cover more on later).\n\nFor some, opportunity comes easier than it does for others. Some people become an author and find quick success, whereas others struggle for years to complete their book and publish it.\n\nFor most people, creating a consistent writing routine and actually getting the words written is the hardest part – in which case a book writing coach could be just the person you need in your corner, keeping you motivated and accountable.\n\nIt also depends on the book publishing method, which we’ll explain more on in the publishing section of this article. For example, traditional publishing deals are hard to come by, and it is a lengthy process. On the other hand, self-publishing makes becoming an author more accessible.\n\nHow to become an author in 8 simple steps\n\nNow that you have a deeper understanding of what being an author entails, it’s time to dive into the exact process of how to become an author.\n\nWhen learning how to become an author, here are the eight steps you should take:\n\n1. Invest in education\n\nLearning how to become an author doesn’t have any formal educational requirements. But at minimum, a high school degree is recommended. Becoming an author mainly requires that you have a strong set of skills, like the ability to read and write well.\n\nWhen learning how to become an author, having a degree isn’t required, but it can help.\n\nThere is a wide range of educational levels for authors, from those with a basic high school education to those who have completed doctorate programs. Pursuing a higher formal education degree can certainly help you learn how to become an author, but it’s not a requirement.\n\nOur society values higher education. When you’re exploring new careers, the first question is usually: What kind of education is needed for this job?\n\nSo, it isn’t any wonder that people researching how to become an author immediately ask what type of education or credentials are needed to write a book.\n\nA caveat to this: If you’re looking to publish a book on a specific topic, you must be an expert in that field or industry. A college degree helps build your credibility significantly, even though it is not completely necessary.\n\nCommon degrees to consider for aspiring book writers\n\nEnglish. Anyone with a college degree in English has spent the majority of their college career taking classes on writing development and reading literature for deep analysis. Those with an English degree usually have a strong command of writing, and study the works of famous authors.\n\nLiterature. Similar to a degree in English, a degree in Literature follows the same course syllabus in the sense that it is heavily focused on reading, analyzing, and writing about literary works.\n\nCreative writing. Writers with a degree in Creative Writing have undergone extensive academic courses surrounding creative writing fundamentals and storytelling. Creative Writing students are expected to write rigorously to improve their craft.\n\nHistory. Because history goes hand-in-hand with many literary subjects, those with a degree in History will have a well-rounded skillset to apply as an author.\n\nJournalism. Writers with a journalism background are likely educated on news-style writing, features, interview processes, and more. Those with a journalism degree often have experience as newspaper columnists or feature writers, which can translate well into an author career.\n\nPsychology. Those who study psychology have an in-depth understanding of human behavior and interaction, which makes for great writing, especially in fiction.\n\nCommunications. People with a communications degree often have experience in news-writing, marketing, public relations, and more, which are all fields that rely heavily on great writing skills.\n\nTheater/cinema. Those with a theater background make great authors and writers due to their creativity, understanding of character dynamics, and screenwriting skills.\n\nLiberal arts. Any degree in liberal arts is likely to be focused on heavy research and writing – no matter the field. Therefore, a liberal arts degree can set you up well for learning how to become an author.\n\nA degree in any subject you want to write about! If you have a particular industry or niche that you want to focus on in your writing, pursue a degree in that! For example, if I could re-do college all over again, I would pursue a minor degree in Women’s Studies, because I love to write about those topics.\n\nAlternatives to college degrees\n\nThere are also non-degree online education options for aspiring authors to consider. These are a great choice if you want to learn how to write a book or publish a book on your own. Programs like these are focused on achieving a specific goal, and can be completed at a quicker pace. (Example: Himalayan Writing Retreat)\n\nIf you get a traditional college degree, you likely will NOT learn how to write and publish a book. So, if you know for sure that you want to learn how to become an author, you’ll save time and money by investing in a course or program that’s specific to publishing.\n\nFor example, there are many online education programs specifically for aspiring authors, including self-publishing courses.\n\nBe sure to thoroughly do your research to make sure the program is a good fit for your needs.\n\nOnline education options\n\nSelf-Publishing courses. Start here if you want to join an education program that provides a complete roadmap to becoming a bestselling author.\n\nCoursera. Consider a program where you can select specific topics to learn about.\n\nUdemy. You can find cost-effective micro-courses based on specific topics around writing and publishing.\n\nMasterClass. There are limited courses for aspiring authors on this platform, but if you’re particularly interested in learning how to improve your writing from bestselling, world-renowned authors like Margaret Atwood, check this out.\n\nCreativeLive.

Learn the skills to become a successful author\n\nWhile there aren’t any formal education requirements to learn how to become an author of a book, there are certainly some important skills that many successful writers have in common.\n\nConsider these skills like prerequisites – you should aim to improve these skills if you truly want to learn how to become a writer.\n\nIn a society of high competition, possessing many of these skills will set you apart and increase your chances of gaining a solid readership.\n\nThe top skills needed to learn how to become an author are:\n\nExceptional writing development skills\n\nBeing an excellent writer who can communicate effectively through words is the premise of learning how to become an author successfully. We’ll cover more on the fundamentals of writing that you should master in the next section, but you can check out these writing websites to learn how to be a better writer.\n\nCreative storytelling that engages\n\nIt’s an art in itself! Whether you’re writing nonfiction or fiction, no matter what genre your book falls in, you need to be able to craft an engaging story that pulls readers in.\n\nThe ability to research well\n\nAsk any successful author, and they will tell you that a major factor in successfully writing a book is to conduct thorough research. You need to know your content in and out – whether you’re writing historical fiction, a children’s picture book, or a self-help book.\n\nSince you’re reading this article and researching how to become an author, there’s a good chance you’re already research-savvy!\n\nThe tendency to naturally observe people and places\n\nIn order to create life-size characters, make your story come alive, and describe people and events vividly, you need to possess the power of observation. If you’re not one to naturally sit back and watch from the sidelines, try improving your observation skills.\n\nVulnerability and grit\n\nAuthors put everything they possess into their writing. It takes vulnerability to put your words out there, and resilience to keep at it when the going gets tough. To learn how to become an author, you’ll need to overcome some serious mental blocks, and be courageous even when you’re overworked or fearing judgment.\n\n3. Master the fundamentals of book writing\n\nHaving an excellent command of writing skills builds a solid foundation on which to begin your author journey.\n\nMany people can write, but not many people can write well. And if you can’t write well, that’s okay!\n\nThe good news is that there are a number of ways to improve your writing.\n\nWriting isn’t necessarily a talent, it’s a craft. It can be cultivated. It can be strengthened. And with a growth mindset, you can improve your writing skills by mastering the fundamentals.\n\nSome basic examples of the fundamentals of writing are being able to express ideas clearly and in an organized fashion, using powerful word choice, developing a clear point of view, and using proper grammar and punctuation.\n\nHowever, there are a lot more fundamental writing techniques to learn and implement in your own writing.\n\nLearn the writing fundamentals. First, learn all there is to know! You can learn basic writing fundamentals by taking writing development courses, and reading books on writing.\n\nStudy the fundamentals. Be an avid, deep reader. Don’t just read to understand the story. Read to analyze how the author told that story. Study the author’s style, specifically in the genres you want to write in. By doing this, you’ll start to identify characteristics of remarkable writing.\n\nPractice, practice, practice. Put what you’ve learned into practice. Remember all the literary elements you learned about in school. Start actually using those in your writing. Try mirroring an author’s style that you admire. Write often and make it part of your everyday life. Write in a journal, complete writing prompts, write letters to friends, or write short stories.\n\nExplore different genres. Part of finding your author’s voice and developing yourself as a writer means experimenting with other genres that you may not have written on before. Use creative writing prompts to help you practice your writing fundamentals.\n\nShow, don’t tell in writing. This is the number one rule to writing, and it’s important for you to master it. Practice showing and not telling in your own writing, and understand when to use it.\n\nWhile you shouldn’t cut corners on your writing development, it’s important to not get stuck in this phase.\n\nAt the end of the day, you can read and take all the courses in the world, but the most growth and development you will experience is when you’re actually writing.\n\n4. Create a positive author mindset\n\nMany writers experience feelings of insecurity. Ernest Hemingway supposedly said, “There is nothing to writing. All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed.”\n\nIf writers are figuratively transforming the essence of their being into words on paper for others to read, then it’s no wonder the best writers suffer from their own insecurities and fear of judgment!\n\nFeeling inadequate is expected, and totally normal. But the ability to pursue your goal to learn how to become an author (despite your fear) is what will set you apart from all the other aspiring book writers out there.\n\nSteps to build a positive author mindset:\n\nOvercome imposter syndrome and self-doubt as a writer. Give yourself permission to be an author. Don’t shy away from calling yourself a writer – start owning it.\n\nAccept that you’re a work in progress. Don’t strive for perfection in writing. Maintain a growth mindset, and understand that there is always room for improvement. You are constantly learning, and improving, and there isn’t anything wrong with that. If you wait for perfection, it’ll never get done.\n\nSet a writing habit. Making writing part of your daily lifestyle is super important. If you tend to wait for inspiration as a writer, you’ll be left high and dry more often than not. We’ll cover more on how to set a writing habit in the next section.\n\nFocus, focus, focus. We’ve all been there. You sit down at the table to write, and find that an hour has passed and you’ve only churned out a few sentences. Find a focus technique that works for you and stick to it.\n\nThink courageously. Try not to get too bogged down in the negative “what-ifs.” What if no one likes my book? What if my writing sucks? What if this book is an entire flop? It’s okay to fear failure, but learn to shake it off and be courageous instead. For every negative thought you have, try to think of two positive thoughts!\n\nDefine your own success. Success means something different for every author. Some writers want to share their words with the world, while others simply want to build an author’s salary to support their writing. Whatever your reason is, get clarity around your definition of success.\n\n5. Write Your first book to learn how to become an author\n\nTo truly learn how to become an author, you have to write a book first.\n\nThe world is full of great writers with stories to share. The trouble for many is – they never get around to actually finishing a book.\n\nIt also depends on what type of book you want to write. If you want to write a nonfiction book, the process is different than learning how to write a novel. The same is true if you’re learning how to write a memoir.\n\nThis is where it can really get tough. But with grit, determination, and a clear game plan, you can do it. We’re cheering for you!\n\nHere are the steps to write a book and learn how to become an author:\n\nGet clear on your foundation\n\nBecause writing a book can be an uphill battle, you want to make sure your foundation is rock solid. This means getting clear on why you want to become the author of this book. Once you’re super clear on your foundation, you’ll be able to write your book with intention.\n\nFoundational questions you’ll want to ask yourself are:\n\nWhen do you want to have this book done by?\n\nHow will you position the book?\n\nWho are you writing this book for (your target reader)?\n\nWhat is your book’s topic or genre?\n\nWhy are you writing this book? Here are some reasons authors write a book:\n\nTo grow your income\n\nTo build a reputation/authority\n\nTo fuel a passion project\n\nTo share a story or knowledge\n\nBrainstorm with a mind map\n\nLetting your ideas flow freely with a mind map is an effective way to get those creative juices flowing. With so many ideas to explore for your book’s topic, mind map exercises will help you “brain dump” all your thoughts.\n\nFollow these steps to create a mind map for your book:\n\nSet a timer for 10-15 minutes to start.\n\nAlways be writing – don’t worry about grammar or spelling, just write out your thoughts without reservations!\n\nStart with a central idea, topic, or concept.\n\nAdd connecting branches of key ideas that relate to that central idea.\n\nJot down any words that tie ideas together.\n\nUse colored highlighters or sticky notes to organize similar concepts or ideas.\n\nCreate an outline\n\nUsing your mind map, start creating a basic outline for your book. Don’t get hung up on the details. Think of it in terms of a beginning, a middle, and an end. A simple outline will help you get the ball rolling as you start writing your first draft. As you dive deeper into the writing, your outline can get more detailed, and be revised as needed.\n\nSet a writing schedule\n\nCommit to your writing goals each and every day if you want to learn how to become an author. Set a specific plan for yourself, and set small milestones or goals, whether it’s by word count or time spent writing.\n\nYou can have all the ideas in the world, but if you aren’t setting time aside each day to actually write, then the chances of your book being completed will be low.\n\nTips for setting a writing schedule:\n\nSet up a distraction-free writing space\n\nPlan for short brain breaks to avoid burnout\n\nSet a daily word count goal\n\nDo NOT edit as you write\n\nHave a buddy keep you accountable\n\nUse book writing software to help you meet your daily goals\n\nSet a deadline to complete your book by\n\nWrite your rough draft\n\nSounds simple, but it’s definitely easier said than done. You can do it! The only way to write a book is to actually sit down and do it. You become a book writer by writing a completed book. Use your outline for guidance, and remember – don’t edit while you write!\n\nSelf-edit your book\n\nOnce your rough draft is completed, it’s important that you focus on self-editing your book. Although your book will go through a professional editing phase during the publishing process, if you self-edit thoroughly, your editor will be able to focus on other edits that you weren’t able to catch.\n\nTips for self-editing your book:\n\nDo a verbal read–through to find areas of improvement in your sentence structure and storyline.\n\nWork chapter by chapter to increase productivity and focus.\n\nDon’t get stuck in the editing phase.\n\nRemember that any points of uncertainty will be cleared up in the professional editing phase.\n\n6. Publish your book\n\nThrough blood, sweat, and tears, you’ve committed to writing your book, and have officially become a writer.\n\nNow, it’s time to take the next step and learn how to become an author. And that means publishing your book!\n\nHere’s how to become an author of a published book:\n\nDecide how to publish\n\nModern book writers are faced with a major decision on how to publish a book. There are two ways to publish: traditionally publish or self-publish.\n\nYou’ll have to weigh the pros and cons of each, including the cost to publish, and determine which route is more advantageous for you.\n\nIf you traditionally publish your book, this means that an actual publishing company will publish your book for you. However, landing a book contract with a traditional publisher is extremely competitive, and the chances are slim for most authors.\n\nSo what is self-publishing, you ask?
