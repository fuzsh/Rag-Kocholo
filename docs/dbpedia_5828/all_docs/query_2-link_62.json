Download book cover illustration (PDF: 1.92 MB; 1 page).\n\nDefining fairy tales\n\nWhat makes a fairy tale different from other types of stories?\n\nWhat do different fairy tales have in common?\n\nThere are examples of fairy tales from across the world, and the stories often have common themes and motifs.\n\nTraditional fairy stories were created by unknown authors at a time long before many people could even read or write.\n\nPeople told the stories to each other, or acted them out. They were passed down from generation to generation by word of mouth. The details of the stories might have changed slightly with each re-telling, but the main message remained the same.\n\nCollecting and adapting\n\nThe stories were later collected, written down and adapted by writers and scholars like Hans Christian Andersen (1805-1875), Charles Perrault (1805-1875), Andrew Lang (1844-1912), Jacob Grimm (1785-1863) and his brother Wilhelm Grimm (1786-1859).\n\nToday, we often associate fairy tales with children's literature, but they were originally intended for a mixed audience of adults and children.\n\nFairy tale elements\n\nA set phrase used at the beginning and end of the story:\n\nMost fairy tales begin with 'once upon a time' or 'a long time ago', and end with telling the reader that the characters 'lived happily ever after'.\n\nFairy tales are often set in the past, but not in a defined period of history, and they usually have a happy ending where the hero triumphs over adversity.\n\nRepetition:\n\nThere is often a lot of repetition which creates a certain rhythm to the story, and also helps people to remember and tell the story. Particular phrases or words might be repeated and events often happen in groups of three or seven.\n\nFor example, Rumpelstiltskin spinning the straw into gold on three occasions and demanding three rewards from the miller's daughter.\n\nAn element of magic:\n\nFor example characters who possess magic powers which they use for good or evil, or objects which can be used to make a wish. Some characters are able to change shape, such as the frog who is transformed into a prince.\n\nFairy tales often feature characters who are mythical or magical, such as witches, elves, and fairies.\n\nA problem which needs to be solved:\n\nFor example a physical challenge that can only be undertaken by the hero or central character.\n\nTypical character types:\n\nHero\n\nVillain\n\nHelper.\n\nSettings:\n\nFor example a forest and/or castle setting are common to many fairy tales.\n\nSuggested activities\n\nDraw a table or grid with titles of favourite fairy tales along one side, and some or all of the following elements along the other side:\n\nMagic objects or powers\n\nVillain\n\nHelper\n\nHero\n\nProblem to be solved\n\nRepetition — groups of three or seven; repeated phrases\n\nSet phrases at beginning and end of story\n\nRoyal family — king, queen or princess.\n\nRead the fairy tales aloud in the class and, for each one, put a tick or some notes against each story element on the grid. How many story elements do the fairy tales have in common? Ask the pupils to think of any other story elements which might be common to all or some of the fairy tales.\n\nLiteracy and English experiences and outcomes: [LIT 1-15a; LIT 2-15a; LIT 1-09a; LIT 2-09a; LIT 1-07a; LIT 2-07a; LIT 1-05a; LIT 2-05a; ENG 1-31a; ENG 2-31a]\n\nPrint out the large version of the cover illustration for 'My book of favourite fairy tales' above. Ask your pupils to look at it . What is it about the picture that tells you that this a book of fairy tales?\n\nCompare this illustration with other, more modern, covers of fairy tales books in your school or local library. Ask the pupils which style or illustration they like best, and which book / edition they would prefer to read.\n\nAsk your pupils to design their own book cover for 'Grimm's fairy tales'. You might like to provide a design brief. Pupils will need to consider the design of the whole cover, including the font and lettering of the title as well as the layout of the page. The design of the back cover could also be included, including the synopsis.Consider how important book covers are in encouraging people to buy the book. The design should aim to be attractive and eye-catching.\n\nExpressive Arts experiences and outcomes: [EXA 1-06a; EXA 2-06a; EXA 1-02a; EXA2-02a; EXA 0-05a; EXA 1-05a; EXA 2-05a]\n\nChoose one fairy tale, and research how it has been illustrated by different artists over ti me. Which parts of the story does each one emphasise? Ask the pupils to decide which key scenes they would choose to illustrate from this particular fairy t ale.\n\n[EXA 1-05a; EXA 2-05a; EXA 1-07a; EXA 2-07a]\n\nCreate a class fairy tale book. Each pupil, or group of pupils, can produce a page or illustrate a favourite fairy tale.\n\n[EXA 1-05a; EXA 2-05a]\n\nExplain that fairy tales were traditionally part of the oral tradition, and were passed on by word of mouth. As a class, listen to Macastory's audio re-telling of 'Hansel and Gretel'. Over subsequent days, ask individuals or groups of pupils to retell (and perhaps perform) the story from memory without referring back to the original story. How does the story change with each telling? Listen again to the original version. Did the pupils add any details or descriptions to the story? What might be gained or lost if the story was written down.\n\nAsk the pupils to think of fairy tales that they might know from film versions or pantomime shows. Compare a film version with a more traditional version of the story. Which elements do both versions have in common? How does the film differ from the traditional story? Think about telling a story in a different format — through dance, performance, or in a graphic novel / comic format.\n\n[ENG 1-31a; ENG 2-31a; EXA 1-13a; EXA 2-13a; EXA 1-05a; EXA 2-05a; EXA 1-02a; EXA 2-02a; EXA 1-07a; EXA 2-07a]\n\nDraw a grid with 26 boxes, one for each letter of the alphabet. Ask the pupils to brainstorm / think of a fairy tale-related word for every letter. Use the words to discuss how to define and describe the genre of fairy tales.\n\nDownload fairy tale mindmap activity (PDF: 134KB; 2 pages)"
