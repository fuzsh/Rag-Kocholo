        "text": "Writing your first novel can be a slightly daunting task. There are a million reference books out there, with advice on how to plot, how to develop characters, and even how to edit…\n\nBut, before you even consider these points, the first thing you need to think about is what kind of book you want to write.\n\nMaybe, even before this, you need to ask yourself, what kind of novels are out there?\n\nIn this article, I hope to clarify for you, what different types of books are out there, so you can decide what area of the fiction world you want to focus on.\n\nDo you want to write romantic epistolary novels? Or maybe you’re more interested in horror novels, or speculative fiction?\n\nThere are so many areas of prose fiction that writers can explore, but understanding the different types of novels that are out there first, is fundamental.\n\nWhat Is A Novel?\n\nThis might seem like the most basic question, but it is so important to understand what a novel is before you attempt to write one for the first time.\n\nA novel, by definition, is a work of fiction.\n\nGenerally, fiction novels sit between 50,000 and 120,000 words depending on the genre.\n\nNovels can be broadly split into 3 main categories, with sub-categories in each to drill down into taste.\n\nThose three categories are genre fiction, literary fiction, and mainstream fiction.\n\nWhat Is Genre Fiction?\n\nGenre fiction (also often referred to as popular fiction), unlike literary fiction, describes fiction that is written with the intent of fitting into a specific literary genre.\n\nMost writers agree that there are nine main subgenres within genre fiction.\n\nThese include horror, mystery/crime, romance, science fiction, thriller/suspense, westerns, historical, young adult, and fantasy.\n\nAlthough there are many more subcategories, most genre fiction will fit into one of these categories.\n\nExamples Of Genre Fiction\n\nTo make it even easier to spot and define genre fiction, I have listed examples below of a few recognisable novels in each genre.\n\nHorror Fiction Examples\n\nHorror Fiction Definition:\n\nThe main focus of horror novels is to create feelings of fear, dread, terror and sometimes repulsion in its audience.\n\nNovels in this genre should leave readers feeling these specific emotions.\n\nExamples:\n\nIt by Stephen King\n\nDracula by Bram Stoker\n\nBehind Closed Doors by B. A. Paris\n\nMystery/Crime Fiction Examples\n\nMystery/Crime Fiction Definition:\n\nMystery, crime, and murder mystery fiction novels are works of fiction that use narratives that centre on criminal acts, the investigation by either amateur or professional experts, and the resolution of that crime or mystery.\n\nExamples:\n\nDaisy Darker by Alice Feeney\n\nDream Town by David Baldacci\n\nThe Darkest Evening by Ann Cleeves\n\nRomance Fiction Examples\n\nRomance Definition:\n\nRomance fiction generally refers to novels that primarily focus on the relationship and romantic love between two, or more, people.\n\nA romance novel will typically have a ‘Happy Ever After’ or, at the very least, an emotionally satisfying ending.\n\nExamples:\n\nThe Notebook by Nicholas Sparks\n\nThe Time Traveller’s Wife by Audrey Niffenegger\n\nMe Before You by JoJo Moyes\n\nScience Fiction Examples\n\nSci-Fi Definition:\n\nScience fiction is a genre of speculative fiction which typically deals with imaginative or futuristic concepts.\n\nScience fiction novels will, more often than not, deal with ideas of advanced technology, scientific advancement, space exploration or time travel to mention just a few.\n\nExamples:\n\nWar of the Worlds by H.G.Wells\n\nTwenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne\n\nThe Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes by Suzanne Collins\n\nThriller/Suspense Fiction Examples\n\nThriller/Suspense Definition:\n\nThriller and suspense genres are often linked and both are genres that follow similar rules.\n\nIn general, these novel genres use fast-paced plots to affect the readers, and situations that evoke emotions such as anxiety, surprise, excitement and anticipation.\n\nThese genres of fiction are entirely dependent on the emotion you leave the reader with, rather than the structure you use to tell the story.\n\nSuspense and thriller novels tend to be stories that rely heavily on plot and plot twists.\n\nExamples:\n\nThe Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins\n\nVerity by Colleen Hoover\n\nGone Girl by Gillian Flynn\n\nWestern Fiction Examples\n\nWestern Fiction Definition:\n\nWestern fiction is a genre of literature set in the American “Old West” frontier and is generally set in the 19th or early 20th century.\n\nThis area of fiction is plot-driven and will generally combine aspects of crime, redemption and justice.\n\nExamples:\n\nThe Revenant by Michael Punke\n\nNo Country for Old Men by Cormac McCarthy\n\nThe Son by Philip Meyer\n\nHistorical Fiction Examples\n\nHistorical Fiction Definition:\n\nHistorical novels are set in another time and place, either real (they’re often based on historical events) or imagined, but during a culturally recognisable time.\n\nGenerally, most writers of historical novels will leap back at least fifty years to take their readers outside of the events they are currently experiencing and use setting to make readers feel they are living in another time and place.\n\nResearch is key and setting is vital in this genre.\n\nExamples:\n\nThe Book Thief by Markus Zusak\n\nWolf Hall by Hilary Mantel\n\nThe Girl with a Pearl Earring by Tracy Chevalier\n\nYoung Adult Fiction Examples\n\nYA Definition:\n\nYoung adult fiction is a genre of literature written primarily for audiences between the ages of 12 and 18.\n\nHowever, although these novels are written to target adolescents, more than half of YA readers are adults.\n\nNovels in this genre tend to be written from the viewpoint of young people, generally tend to be fast-paced, and cover a wide area of subjects that young adults might be facing.\n\nExamples:\n\nThe Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky\n\nThe Fault in Our Stars by John Green\n\nOne of Us is Lying by Karen McManus\n\nFantasy Fiction Examples\n\nFantasy Definition:\n\nFantasy fiction is a genre categorised in general by its inclusion of magical elements.\n\nIt is a genre of speculative fiction that typically includes fictional universes, and most fantasy novels are inspired by mythology, folklore, or traditions.\n\nSetting and deep characterisation are vital in this genre.\n\nExamples:\n\nA Game of Thrones by George RR Martin\n\nThe Colour of Magic by Terry Pratchett\n\nThe Lord of the Rings by JRR Tolkien\n\nWhat Is Literary Fiction?\n\nLiterary fiction, unlike genre fiction, is fiction that puts an emphasis on style, character and theme over plot.\n\nAlthough the definition of literary fiction can change and warp year on year, there are some fundamental aspects that remain the same.\n\nWorks of fiction that are classed as literary fiction generally contain the following:\n\nCharacter (rather than plot) driven\n\nExploration of deeper themes\n\nExploration of social, political, or emotional situations\n\nPotential ambiguous ending/not necessarily a ‘Happy Ever After’\n\nNo strict adherence to a structured plot\n\nNo strict adherence to standard formatting or prose style\n\nExamples Of Literary Fiction\n\nBelow, you can find three separate examples of literary fiction:\n\nThe Goldfinch By Donna Tart\n\nTheo Decker is the son of a devoted mother and a reckless, absent father. He survives an accident that otherwise tears his life apart. He is taken in by the family of a wealthy friend.\n\nThe Goldfinch is a haunted odyssey through present-day America. Combining unforgettably vivid characters and thrilling suspense, it is a beautiful, addictive, sweeping story of loss and obsession, of survival and self-invention, of the deepest mysteries of love, identity and fate.\n\nThis novel, published in 2013, won the Pulitzer Prize and was described by Stephen King as being ‘a smartly written novel that connects with the heart as well as the mind.’ It is character driven and delves into difficult topics.\n\nThe House Of Fortune By Jessie Burton\n\nThe House of Fortune is the long-awaited sequel to Jessie Burton’s bestseller The Miniaturist.\n\nIt has been described as a glorious, sweeping story of fate and ambition, secrets and dreams, and one young woman’s determination to rule her own destiny.\n\nJust like her debut, The Miniaturist, this fabulous sequel is beautifully crafted, the characters, their lives and the settings leap from the page and drive the book forward. It’s a perfect example of exquisitely written literary fiction.\n\nMaps Of Our Spectacular Bodies By Maddie Mortimer\n\nWhen a sudden diagnosis upends Lia’s world, the boundaries between her past and her present begin to collapse. Deeply buried secrets stir awake.\n\nAs the voice prowling in Lia takes hold of her story, and the landscape around becomes indistinguishable from the one within, Lia and her family are faced with some of the hardest questions of all: how can we move on from the events that have shaped us, when our bodies harbour everything? And what does it mean to die with grace, when you’re simply not ready to let go?\n\nThis entrancing novel is moving, heartbreaking and beautiful all at once. The language, formatting, and subjects discussed not only make this a stunning example of literary fiction, but are also the reasons this debut has been longlisted for this year’s Booker Prize.\n\nWhat Is Mainstream Fiction?\n\nMuch like literary fiction, mainstream fiction consists of novels that can’t be easily identified into a specific genre. Unlike genre fiction, which clearly sets out what you can expect from the novel, mainstream fiction can, and often does, cross book genres.\n\nUnlike genre fiction, mainstream fiction can be slightly harder to sell, doesn’t always have a clear audience and is generally sold on the back of author recognition and a dedicated audience.\n\nMainstream fiction generally follows a linear structure, more often than not has a happy ending (or at least a satisfying one), and readers don’t have to work hard to understand the story.\n\nLike literary fiction, mainstream fiction delves deeper into characterisation and may touch on philosophical issues, but unlike literary fiction, it does still focus heavily on plot and story.\n\nExamples Of Mainstream Fiction\n\nIt can be hard to tell the difference between mainstream fiction and literary fiction, but below you can see some examples of the most popular mainstream fiction on the market.\n\nBig Little Lies By Liane Moriarty\n\nBig Little Lies is a novel that explores complex relationships, difficult topics and sensitive issues, wrapped up in a story that could be described as a crime, thriller, psychological thriller or even domestic thriller. It is a complex story that relies heavily on characterisation, but plot and story are integral.\n\nIt is the perfect example of mainstream fiction and those who are already a fan of Moriarty’s work instantly know what to expect from this author’s books. They may not fit neatly in one genre, but they hit all expectations and leave the reader satisfied at the end.\n\nThe Lovely Bones By Alice Seabold\n\nAgain, this novel is intense in its exploration of grief; it’s complex in its characterisation and explores themes that set this book apart.\n\nThe plot of the book isn’t complex, but it is complete and the reader is left satisfied, but the genre of the book is not instantly clear. It sweeps between genres and picks up readers in multiple guises.\n\nOther authors who fit well into the mainstream fiction category are Maeve Binchy, John Irving, Dan Brown, Ian McEwan and Nora Roberts.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat Are The 9 Types Of Fiction?\n\nWithin fiction, there are many different subcategories that can help determine story type and therefore the audience these novels are marketed to.\n\nThese subcategories are:\n\nScience fiction\n\nMystery/crime fiction\n\nHistorical fiction\n\nThriller/suspense fiction\n\nYoung adult fiction\n\nRomance fiction\n\nHorror fiction\n\nFantasy fiction\n\nWestern fiction\n\nWhat Is The Most Popular Novel Genre?\n\nWell, that is one of the most difficult questions to answer – why? Because depending on who you talk to, and which data sets you look at, you may discover a different answer.\n\nDuring the pandemic, we saw a surge in reading and a change in reading habits. Depending on the state of the world, readers reach for different stimuli.\n\nRomance, both contemporary and historical, are always incredibly popular and for many years, romance fiction has not dropped out of the top five bestselling genres.\n\nHowever, crime and thriller books are forever competing for the top spots, with the likes of Lee Child, Gillian Flynn, and Colleen Hoover topping the charts consistently.\n\nFiction Genres\n\nAs you can see, there are so many areas of the writing world that you can indulge in, and so many subgenres of fiction to explore. With so many different types of novels out there, all you have to do is decide which one fits your style the most and then dive right in.\n\nAlways remember, there is no wrong way to write, and no right genre to start with… all you need to focus on, is getting those words onto the page and out into the world."
