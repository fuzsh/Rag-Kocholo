        "text": "Poetry by Anna Moschovakis\n\nMarch 15, 2016 • 6 x 9 • 112 Pages • 978-1-56689-420-3\n\nMoschovakis invents new forms, insisting that we can never tire of asking “how must I live in the world.”\n\nAnna Moschovakis measures words, crosses languages, and invents forms. In a mode of inquiry, friction, and barbed naiveté, these four long poems trouble notions of history, self-knowledge, and intimacy, insisting that “how to be” is a question we can never tire of confronting.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nAnna Moschovakis is the author of You and Three Others are Approaching a Lake, winner of the James Laughlin Award from the Academy of American Poets, and I Have Not Been Able to Get Through to Everyone, a finalist for the Norma Farber First Book Award and a selection of the Poetry Society of America’s New American Poetry Series. Her translations from the French include texts by Robert Bresson, Annie Ernaux, Samira Negrouche, Marcelle Sauvageot, Jean-Luc Nancy, and Albert Cossery. She teaches in the MFA programs at Pratt Institute and Bard College and was the 2016 Holloway Lecturer in the Practice of Poetry at UC Berkeley. Raised in Los Angeles, Moschovakis has lived in New York since 1993 and is currently based in the northern Catskills, where she is active in a nonprofit art and community space called Bushel in Delhi, New York. She is also a longtime member of the Brooklyn-based publishing collective Ugly Duckling Presse.\n\nThanks to a 2013 ADA Access Improvement Grant administered by VSA Minnesota for the Metropolitan Regional Arts Council, this title is also formatted for screen readers which make text accessible to the blind and visually impaired.
