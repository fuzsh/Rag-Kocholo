        "text": "Children each learn and develop at their own pace, and reading is no different from other skill building. It’s common for kids to find reading challenging at one point or another. But if learning to read becomes an ongoing struggle that leaves a child falling behind their peers, it’s possible that they have a learning disorder known as dyslexia.\n\nDyslexia is most commonly associated with trouble learning to read. It affects a child’s ability to recognize and manipulate the sounds in language. Kids with dyslexia have a hard time decoding new words, or breaking them down into manageable chunks they can then sound out. This causes difficulty with reading, writing and spelling. They may compensate by memorizing words, but they’ll have trouble recognizing new words and may be slow in retrieving even familiar ones.\n\nDyslexia is not a reflection of a child’s intelligence — in fact it’s defined as a gap between a student’s ability and achievement. Some youngsters with dyslexia are able to keep up with their peers with extra effort at least for the first few grades. But by the third grade or so, when they need to be able to read quickly and fluently in order to keep up with their work, they run into trouble.\n\nWith help and strategies for compensating for their weakness in decoding, students with dyslexia can learn to read and thrive academically. But dyslexia is not something one grows out of.\n\nHow common is dyslexia?\n\nIt is estimated that as many as one in five kids has dyslexia, and that 80 to 90 percent of kids with learning disorders have it. Sally Shaywitz, MD, co-director of the Yale Center for Dyslexia and Creativity, notes that many children go undiagnosed as struggles in school are incorrectly attributed to intelligence, level of effort or environmental factors.\n\nAlthough experts used to say that dyslexia occurred more often in boys than in girls, current research indicates that it affects boys and girls equally.\n\nA young person with dyslexia may:\n\nStruggle with learning even simple rhymes\n\nHave a speech delay\n\nHave trouble following directions\n\nRepeat or omit short words such as and, the, but\n\nFind it difficult to tell left from right\n\nIn school, children with dyslexia are likely to:\n\nHave difficulty sounding out new words\n\nLack fluency compared to other children their age\n\nReverse letters and numbers when reading (read saw as was, for example)\n\nFind it difficult to take notes and copy down words from the board\n\nStruggle with rhyming, associating sounds with letters, and sequencing and ordering sounds\n\nStumble and have difficulty spelling even common words; frequently they will spell them phonetically (hrbr instead of harbor)\n\nAvoid being called on to read out loud in front of classmates\n\nBecome tired or frustrated from reading\n\nDyslexia affects children outside of school as well. Kids with dyslexia may also:\n\nFind it difficult to decode logos and signs\n\nStruggle when trying to learn the rules to games\n\nHave difficulty keeping track of multi-step directions\n\nStruggle with getting the hang of telling time\n\nFind it especially challenging to learn another language\n\nBecome incredibly frustrated, which can effect their mood and emotional stability\n\nSocial and emotional impacts of dyslexia\n\nDyslexia affects a lot more than reading — it can also impact a child socially. “A dyslexic person who has word-finding difficulties can have trouble with their expressive language,” says Scott Bezsylko, the executive director of Winston Preparatory School, which specializes in teaching kids with learning disorders. “That has a social impact, in addition to your difficulties with reading and writing, that make you feel not so good about yourself.”\n\nKids with dyslexia — particularly those who have yet to be diagnosed — often suffer from low self-esteem because they worry that there is something wrong with them, and are often accused of not trying hard enough to learn to read. “A lot of our work with dyslexic kids is to help them rediscover that they are smart and capable,” notes Beszylko, “because they’ve stopped believing in themselves.”\n\nHow is dyslexia diagnosed?\n\nIf your child isn’t meeting expectations for reading, as parents you can ask the school district to perform an evaluation and share the results with you. The evaluation will test your child’s intellectual capacity and reading skills, to see if there is an achievement gap. It should also rule out other potential causes like environmental factors or hearing impairment.\n\nThe school should then make recommendations on how they can support your child and maximize her learning.\n\nIf you are unhappy with the quality of the evaluation, you can also secure a private evaluation by a psychologist, a neuropsychologist, a reading specialist, a speech and language therapist, an educational evaluator or a school psychologist. This external evaluation can also be used to advocate for your child and get the accommodations and services she might need.\n\nWhen should a child be evaluated?\n\nDyslexia can begin to reveal itself at a young age, and there are preschool evaluations that look at the child’s awareness of the sounds that make up words, and ability at word retrieval. However, Matthew Cruger, PhD, a clinical neuropsychologist at the Child Mind Institute, suggests waiting until kids are at least six years old and have had some formal instruction in reading to seek out a formal evaluation.\n\nBut Dr. Shaywitz notes that as soon as a gap between intelligence and reading skills is apparent — and evidence shows it can be seen in first grade — it’s a good idea to get help. Schools sometimes encourage parents to wait until the third grade to see if their child truly needs an intervention, but Dr. Shaywitz argues that the earlier intervention is important not only to help kids catch up but to boost their fragile self-image, which is damaged by continuing struggle in school and comparisons with peers.\n\nHow to help kids with dyslexia\n\nA dyslexia diagnosis does not mean your child will never learn to read. Dr. Cruger says there are a number of programs that can help, which might include these features:\n\nMulti-sensory instruction in decoding skills\n\nRepetition and review of skills\n\nIntensity of intervention — that is, more than being pulled out of class once a week for extra help\n\nSmall group or individual instruction\n\nTeaching decoding skills\n\nDrilling sight words\n\nTeaching comprehension strategies, to help kids derive meaning from what they’re reading\n\nReading programs that been shown to help kids with dyslexia include:\n\nThe Wilson Method\n\nThe Orton-Gillingham Approach\n\nPreventing Academic Failure (PAF)\n\nThe Lindamood-Bell Program\n\nRAVE-O\n\nDr. Cruger points out that traditional tutoring may actually be counter-productive for a child with dyslexia, particularly if it is not a positive experience. “If the child hates the experience of reading help, it’s not helpful,” Dr. Cruger notes. “And it’s not treating the source of the problem, the decoding weakness.”\n\nInstead, Dr. Cruger emphasizes that one of the most important ways to help kids with dyslexia is to make them more comfortable reading. This can be done in part by celebrating even small victories and accomplishments, while focusing less on correcting their errors.\n\nAccommodations for kids with dyslexia\n\nKids with demonstrated dyslexia are eligible for accommodations in school. “Dyslexia robs a person of time,” Dr. Shaywitz explains, “and accommodations give the time back to her.” Accommodations may include:\n\nExtra time on tests\n\nA quiet space to work\n\nThe option to record lectures\n\nThe option to give verbal, rather than written, answers (when appropriate)\n\nElimination of oral reading in class\n\nExemption from foreign language learning\n\nOther ways to support a child with dyslexia\n\nOne of the best ways to support a child with dyslexia — or any child who is struggling — is to encourage those activities that they like and feel good at, whether it is music, joining a sports team or anything else that helps build her confidence.\n\nTo help reinforce that dyslexia is not a marker of intelligence, it can also be helpful to talk about successful people — like Whoopi Goldberg and Steven Spielberg — who have also been diagnosed with dyslexia.\n\nOther things that may help your child with dyslexia include:\n\nListening to audio books as an alternative to reading\n\nTyping on a computer or tablet instead of writing\n\nApps that can make learning fun by turning decoding into a game\n\nUsing a ruler to help kids read in a straight line, which can help keep them focused\n\nEmotional support\n\nDyslexia can result in frustration, embarrassment, avoidance and low self-esteem as a result of difficulties performing tasks that seem to come naturally to others. Demystifying the learning disorder with your child can help him develop the tools — and resilience — necessary to manage it, both in school and in social circumstances. Some things you can do to help include:\n\nDiscuss the specific challenges that result from dyslexia: “You know how you have a hard time reading signs or copying notes from the board? That’s dyslexia.”\n\nAcknowledge their effort and celebrate hard work, even if there are still mistakes: “I know how difficult that reading homework was. I am so proud of how hard you tried.”\n\nHelp them recognize their strengths: “You showed such great sportsmanship and teamwork in the soccer game the other night, and that was a great goal you scored!”\n\nCombat negative self-talk: If your child starts saying things like, “I’m just stupid,” don’t ignore it. Instead, check out these ideas for helping kids who are too hard on themselves."
