        "text": "I was reading an article on React tips and tricks when I came across this entry about using the :empty pseudo CSS class to stop an element from rendering.\n\nThe example they give is a component that adds a red border to whatever is rendered as a child\n\nfunction PostWrapper({ children }) { return <div className=\"posts-wrapper\">{children}</div>; } ... .posts-wrapper { border: solid 1px red; }\n\nwith them going on to explain that if children was empty/null/undefined, there would still be a render of red.\n\nI can see why this might be useful in this situation, but I can't particularly see how/why one would try to render a component with a null value, and if one were to do so... Would it not be more readable in a code-sense to write something like:\n\nfunction PostWrapper({ children }) { if (!children) return; return <div className=\"posts-wrapper\">{children}</div>; }\n\nIdeally I would be more inclined to do this conditional check before I attempt to render the element like:\n\nconst UserData = (user) => ({ const {name, age, dob} = user; return !!user && ( <PostWrapper> <div>{name}</div> <div>{age}</div> <div>{dob}</div> </PostWrapper> ); })\n\nIs there benefit to doing the former over the latter?"
