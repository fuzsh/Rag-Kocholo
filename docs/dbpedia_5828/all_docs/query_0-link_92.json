        "text": "Affordability, sustainability, and equity are key to Tucson Water’s approach to structuring water rates. Even after the utility’s recent rate increases, Tucsonans still spend a smaller share of their paycheck on their water bill than what is recommended to keep this basic need affordable. By ramping up prices on higher usage and offering financial assistance aligned with national guidelines, Tucson Water can discourage water waste while offering water as a basic need to all customers.\n\nResources below can help customers access their payment portal, break down their water bill, learn how to read their bill or meter, and access financial assistance through Tucson Water CARES.\n\nLogin to Bill Portal\n\nWater Bill Resources\n\nWater Rates and Fees"
