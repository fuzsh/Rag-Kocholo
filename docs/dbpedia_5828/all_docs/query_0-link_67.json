        "meta_description": "<p>Brent Mason and Hayden Winstead can't stand each other. She plans exclusive parties for her rich family's charities. He's a rough and tumble cop who rigs explosives for a living. Could two people be any less suited for conversation? They think not and prefer to keep it that way.<br>Unfortunately, their two best friends are deeply, disgustingly in love. Forced together, the mutual attraction simmering beneath the surface of Brent and Hayden's non-relationship grows with every argument until it explodes into a scintillating night of mind-blowing sex. And it won't be the last, as far as Brent's concerned.<br>Hayden has a secret, though. Her father's company is relying on a merger to save them from financial ruin, and only Hayden's marriage to the CEO's wealthy son can secure the deal. If she's to protect her family, she'll have to forget Brent. And he has no intention of being forgotten. <br>Each book in the Line of Duty series is STANDALONE:<br>* Protecting What's His<br>* Officer Off Limits<br>* Asking for Trouble<br>* Staking His Claim<br>* Protecting What's Theirs</p>",
