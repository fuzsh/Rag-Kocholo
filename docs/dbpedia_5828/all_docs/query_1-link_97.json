To quiet the maternal angst, Sophy invents a boyfriend named Dominic and all is well-that is, until her sister's wedding when she must produce the real thing. At the eleventh hour and in utter desperation, Sophy contacts an escort service. Attending the wedding with \"Dominic,\" Sophy quickly realizes that there is no such thing as one little lie and the fabrications escalate. When the bubbles from the wedding champagne evaporate, she discovers that she likes her escort as more than a convenient arm decoration. What to do? Turn lies into sighs and a happily ever after.",
