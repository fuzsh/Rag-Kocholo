        "text": "Overview\n\nAphasia is a disorder that affects how you communicate. It can impact your speech, as well as the way you write and understand both spoken and written language.\n\nAphasia usually happens suddenly after a stroke or a head injury. But it can also come on gradually from a slow-growing brain tumor or a disease that causes progressive, permanent damage (degenerative). The severity of aphasia depends on a number of things, including the cause and the extent of the brain damage.\n\nThe main treatment for aphasia involves treating the condition that causes it, as well as speech and language therapy. The person with aphasia relearns and practices language skills and learns to use other ways to communicate. Family members often participate in the process, helping the person communicate.\n\nSymptoms\n\nAphasia is a symptom of some other condition, such as a stroke or a brain tumor.\n\nA person with aphasia may:\n\nSpeak in short or incomplete sentences\n\nSpeak in sentences that don't make sense\n\nSubstitute one word for another or one sound for another\n\nSpeak unrecognizable words\n\nHave difficulty finding words\n\nNot understand other people's conversation\n\nNot understand what they read\n\nWrite sentences that don't make sense\n\nPatterns of aphasia\n\nPeople with aphasia may have different strengths and weaknesses in their speech patterns. Sometimes these patterns are labeled as different types of aphasia, including:\n\nBroca's aphasia\n\nWernicke aphasia\n\nTranscortical aphasia\n\nConduction aphasia\n\nMixed aphasia\n\nGlobal aphasia\n\nThese patterns describe how well the person can understand what others say. They also describe how easy it is for the person to speak or to correctly repeat what someone else says.\n\nAphasia may develop slowly over time. When that happens, the aphasia may be labeled with one of these names:\n\nLogopenic aphasia\n\nSemantic aphasia\n\nAgrammatism\n\nMany people with aphasia have patterns of speech difficulty that don't match these types. It may help to consider that each person with aphasia has unique symptoms, strengths and weaknesses rather than trying to label a particular type of aphasia.\n\nWhen to see a doctor\n\nBecause aphasia is often a sign of a serious problem, such as a stroke, seek emergency medical care if you or a loved one suddenly develop:\n\nDifficulty speaking\n\nTrouble understanding speech\n\nDifficulty with word recall\n\nProblems with reading or writing\n\nFrom Mayo Clinic to your inbox\n\nSign up for free and stay up to date on research advancements, health tips, current health topics, and expertise on managing health.

Loss of blood to the brain leads to brain cell death or damage in areas that control language.\n\nBrain damage caused by a severe head injury, a tumor, an infection or a degenerative process also can cause aphasia. In these cases, the aphasia usually occurs with other types of cognitive problems, such as memory problems or confusion.\n\nPrimary progressive aphasia is the term used for language difficulty that develops gradually. This is due to the gradual degeneration of brain cells located in the language networks. Sometimes this type of aphasia will progress to a more generalized dementia.\n\nSometimes temporary episodes of aphasia can occur. These can be due to migraines, seizures or a transient ischemic attack (TIA). A transient ischemic attack (TIA) occurs when blood flow is temporarily blocked to an area of the brain. People who've had a are at an increased risk of having a stroke in the near future.\n\nComplications\n\nAphasia can create numerous quality-of-life problems because communication is so much a part of your life. Communication difficulty may affect your:\n\nJob\n\nRelationships\n\nDay-to-day function\n\nDifficulty expressing wants and needs can result in embarrassment, frustration, isolation and depression. Other problems may occur together, such as more difficulty moving around and problems with memory and thinking.\n\nJun 11, 2022\n\nClark DG.
