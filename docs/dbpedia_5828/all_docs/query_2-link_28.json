        "text": "What is Common Law Marriage?\n\nCommon law marriage, also known as marriage without formalities or informal marriage, is a valid and legal way for a couple to marry in Texas. Texas law states that a common law marriage may be proved by evidence that the couple:\n\n“agreed to be married”; and\n\n“after the agreement they lived together in this state as husband and wife”; and they\n\n“represented to others that they were married”\n\nNote: The language above is quoting directly from the Texas statutes. The Texas Legislature has not yet amended the statutory language since the Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, but despite that, same-sex common law marriages are now recognized in Texas. See the resources below to learn more about common law marriage in Texas.\n\nTexas law does not require the couple to be together for a specific period of time before they can declare themselves to be in a common law marriage. As long as both parties agree to the three elements listed in Section 2.401, they meet the requirements of a common law marriage. See the resource below for more details.\n\nWhile it is not a requirement, couples can register their common law marriage by filing a declaration with the county clerk.\n\nFor couples that choose not to declare their common law marriage, documents such as lease agreements, tax returns, and insurance policies may be requested in order to \"prove\" the marriage.\n\nIf no declaration was filed and there is a dispute as to whether a common law marriage existed, it may be necessary to go to court in order to prove the marriage. Texas law places a two-year statute of limitations on these types of proceedings. Since these types of court proceedings are often complex in nature, it is best to consult with an attorney or a family law practice guide for more information about your options.\n\nSee the resources below for more details.\n\nTexas Law\n\nEnding a common law marriage in Texas is similar to ending a formal marriage. If a common law couple decides to split up, they must file for divorce. See our Divorce guide for more on how to file. Please note: If court proceedings are not filed within two years of the separation, Texas law presumes a common law marriage never existed unless it is proven otherwise. See the resources below for more details.\n\nTexas Law\n\nFor those who are currently incarcerated within the Texas Department of Criminal Justice and have not declared their common law marriage with the county clerk, both the incarcerated person and the common-law spouse may submit to the warden an Affidavit of Informal Marriage form for visitation purposes. The incarcerated person may file an unsworn affidavit while the spouse must have their affidavit certified by a notary.\n\nSee the TDCJ Visitation policy below for more information on proving a common law marriage for contact visits."
