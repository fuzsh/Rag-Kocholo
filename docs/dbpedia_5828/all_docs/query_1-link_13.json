        "text": "A sweet love story…great vacation reading!\n\nWhere does Asking for Trouble rank among all the audiobooks you’ve listened to so far?\n\nI would actually say I preferred Rosalind James' other series of audio books (Escape to NZ) over this one, but that's because the other series is just so fantastic, it's hard to compare. This one was alright for me - as an audiobook - not bad at all. The story is so well-done! It just took me some getting used to a different narrator.\n\nWhat did you like best about this story?\n\nI love the fact that the main characters have known each other since they were teenagers, and have always liked each other. This was an easy transition from friends to romance, yet for Joe, the hero, this was difficult as he had so much at stake if things went wrong. I liked the way the characters grew and changed throughout the story - the way Alyssa went from being impetuous and immature to finding a true purpose and satisfaction in her career, and life with Joe. Steam level is pretty hot so if you don't enjoy that kind of thing, this one may not be for you. It is very tastefully written, and builds up over quite a bit of the story.\n\nWould you listen to another book narrated by Emma Taylor?\n\nYes, although, I think she can use a little more emotion with her male voices. The female ones were good, I just think that the other voices need a little more work. It was just hard to get used to a woman reading the male voices.\n\n• She does a great job going back and forth between the voices.\n\n• Voice quality -excellent\n\n• Good pace, tone, and varied emotions demonstrated\n\nWas there a moment in the book that particularly moved you?\n\nThe scene where Joe went to Alyssa's parents' house to ask her dad for his blessing to date his daughter. I thought it was really sensitive of her dad to help Joe realize there was a pathway to forgiveness for his past. I loved how Joe opened up to him and confessed - and felt relief.\n\nLater, Joe tells Alyssa she can come with him to visit the places in Las Vegas that he needed to and she explained that she was there for him - whether he wanted her to stay in the car -- or to come with him each step of the way. She just wanted him to let her in. Her dad had advised him \"when you want to close down, open up and let her see you.\", and he did just that.\n\nAny additional comments?\n\nConclusion: The story concludes with some pretty tear-jerking moments and I'm so happy these two worked things out in the end. The struggles they dealt with were very realistic and I hope you will discover and love these characters, and the story as much as I did.\n\nPlease note: I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. I was not compensated for my review, and I was not required to write a positive review. The opinion expressed here is my own\n\nAn easy read!\n\nAny additional comments?\n\nThis was a great read and I quite enjoyed it. The main characters are really good and very likable and there are several other ones that, while not main characters, are also well written and add more interest to the story.\n\nThe main characters are great. I especially like Joe, who just might be one of the more complicated and multi-faceted characters that Rosalind has created so far. He is such a sweet guy and I wasn't very far into the book before I was hoping so very much that he got the happy ending that he definitely deserved.\n\nIt also touches on the characters from the previous two books, which I loved. It's always nice to revisit other characters that I have enjoyed. However, even if you've not read the first two books, this can be enjoyed as a standalone book and you will not be lost.\n\nThe narrator is a new one for me, and while she did a decent job, it felt like a lot of what she said sounded very clipped, so that took some getting used to. But very easy to understand & good.\n\nIf you're looking for a sweet love story, this definitely fits the bill. It is a great and easy read. You won't be disappointed!\n\nI received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. I was not compensated for my review, and I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions expressed here are my own.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend this book.\n\nAsking For Trouble by Rosalind James is Book 3 in the author’s The Kincaids series. Is it ideal to listen or read them in order? Probably. Is it necessary, absolutely not! Whether you are listening/reading to this first, second, or third, you are in for a great romantic story. I won’t summarize the premise here; the description for the book takes care of that. I will say that the characters are very realistic (aside a couple being pretty rich, but that is just fun in this case), Alyssa in particularly reminds me of people that I have known over the years. The romantic build up for the characters, and in extension, us the listeners, is deftly done and the anticipation enjoyable. As a pair their chemistry is fantastic and really makes the story great. The description mentions steam, and it is a steamy story. If this is not of interest to you, I will say it is a book you could fast-forward through the steam and still have a substantial story worth your money and time.\n\nTheir separate backgrounds are interesting and Joe’s in particular is not overdone. I think Alyssa will particularly appeal to listeners/readers who are going through or have been through transitional times like moving to a new city or starting down a new career path. In short most, if not all, of us. Joe is a protagonist who is his own man. He has some demons but they veer into melodrama territory and they are explored in a realistic way. Joe is also a man who can take charge both in life and in a relationship, again without ever overstepping. James also creates fun and suspenseful settings throughout the book. Additionally, the author creates interesting minor characters and work subplots.\n\nReader Emma Taylor is easy to understand. I never had any problems misinterpreting words and she does a wonderful job of putting personality and character into her performance.\n\nThis book is one I will definitely returning to so I can return to these characters and their story and I wholeheartedly recommend you give Asking For Trouble a try.\n\nI received a free copy of this audiobook in exchange for an honest review. I was not compensated for my review, and I was not required to write a positive review. The opinion expressed here is my own.\n\nJoe and Alyssa - this is a good one!\n\nJoe was her brother’s college roommate, a quiet guy who had been coming to her family’s Christmases for 15 years. Alyssa had always had a crush on him. At 30, Alyssa had bounced from one job to another, leaving when the going got tough. Now home for Christmas again, Alyssa wants a job where she can make a difference. She joins a non-profit, comes up with a great idea, and is on her way. Or is she? Her boss tries to steal her idea!\n\nJoe is now partners with Alyssa’s brother, Alec. He’s a wealthy (but not as wealthy as Alec) software developer who still secretly has a thing for Alyssa. Now that they live closer together, will they ever get together?\n\nGreat conversations, back-country skiing, and depth of family make this another wonderful story by Rosalind James. Don’t wait – this is a good one!\n\nEmma Taylor does a good job narrating this story. Her voicing of the characters was consistent and easy to understand. Easy listening!\n\nI received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. I was not compensated for my review, and I was not required to write a positive review. The opinion expressed here is my own.\n\nOh, Joe.....(sigh)\n\nAny additional comments?\n\nAsking for Trouble is the third book in the series featuring the Kinkaid siblings. We meet Joe and Alyssa in a previous book, but don't really learn that much about them until this book, so it could easily be enjoyed as a stand alone story.\n\nThe youngest of the three Kinkaids, Alyssa is trying to get her life together in the shadow of her wildly successful older twin brothers, and makes a big life change by moving to the Bay area from Southern California. This puts her in the same city as one of her brothers and his business partner, his longtime friend and college roommate. The same friend/roommate that Alyssa has had a crush on for nearly 15 years.\n\nJoe has always had a thing for Alyssa, but she was always either too young, too far away or too uninterested (or so Joe thought), so he tries his best to be a good friend and an extra, less judgemental big brother. Initially so quiet and reserved, we learn that he is perhaps this author's most layered character to date and you can't help but fall in love with him and root for him to finally get the life he has always deserved. Being a romance, of course they get there eventually, but the twists and turns on the way make this a fabulous story.\n\nThis was a new narrator for this author's books, and it took awhile to get used to her voice and characters and she grew on me as the book went on. I highly recommend this audiobook if you are a fan of a compelling and sweet love story.\n\nI received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. I was not compensated for my review, and I was not required to write a positive review. The opinion expressed here is my own."
