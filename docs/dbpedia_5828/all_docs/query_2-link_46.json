        "text": "It is important to think of knowledge in a given field as consisting of three layers. First, there are the primary studies that researchers conduct and publish. Second are the reviews of those studies that summarize and offer new interpretations built from and often extending beyond the primary studies. Third, there are the perceptions, conclusions, opinion, and interpretations that are shared informally among scholars that become part of the body of epistemological traditions within the field.\n\nIn composing a literature review, it is important to note that it is often this third layer of knowledge that is cited as \"true\" even though it often has only a loose relationship to the primary studies and secondary literature reviews. Given this, while literature reviews are designed to provide an overview and synthesis of pertinent sources you have explored, there are a number of approaches you could adopt depending upon the type of analysis underpinning your study.\n\nTypes of Literature Reviews\n\nArgumentative Review\n\nThis form examines literature selectively in order to support or refute an argument, deeply embedded assumption, or philosophical problem already established in the literature. The purpose is to develop a body of literature that establishes a contrarian viewpoint. Given the value-laden nature of some social science research [e.g., educational reform; immigration control], argumentative approaches to analyzing the literature can be a legitimate and important form of discourse. However, note that they can also introduce problems of bias when they are used to make summary claims of the sort found in systematic reviews [see below].\n\nIntegrative Review\n\nConsidered a form of research that reviews, critiques, and synthesizes representative literature on a topic in an integrated way such that new frameworks and perspectives on the topic are generated. The body of literature includes all studies that address related or identical hypotheses or research problems. A well-done integrative review meets the same standards as primary research in regard to clarity, rigor, and replication. This is the most common form of review in the social sciences.\n\nHistorical Review\n\nFew things rest in isolation from historical precedent. Historical literature reviews focus on examining research throughout a period of time, often starting with the first time an issue, concept, theory, phenomena emerged in the literature, then tracing its evolution within the scholarship of a discipline. The purpose is to place research in a historical context to show familiarity with state-of-the-art developments and to identify the likely directions for future research.\n\nMethodological Review\n\nA review does not always focus on what someone said [findings], but how they came about saying what they say [method of analysis]. Reviewing methods of analysis provides a framework of understanding at different levels [i.e. those of theory, substantive fields, research approaches, and data collection and analysis techniques], how researchers draw upon a wide variety of knowledge ranging from the conceptual level to practical documents for use in fieldwork in the areas of ontological and epistemological consideration, quantitative and qualitative integration, sampling, interviewing, data collection, and data analysis. This approach helps highlight ethical issues which you should be aware of and consider as you go through your own study.\n\nSystematic Review\n\nThis form consists of an overview of existing evidence pertinent to a clearly formulated research question, which uses pre-specified and standardized methods to identify and critically appraise relevant research, and to collect, report, and analyze data from the studies that are included in the review. The goal is to deliberately document, critically evaluate, and summarize scientifically all of the research about a clearly defined research problem . Typically it focuses on a very specific empirical question, often posed in a cause-and-effect form, such as \"To what extent does A contribute to B?\" This type of literature review is primarily applied to examining prior research studies in clinical medicine and allied health fields, but it is increasingly being used in the social sciences.\n\nTheoretical Review\n\nThe purpose of this form is to examine the corpus of theory that has accumulated in regard to an issue, concept, theory, phenomena. The theoretical literature review helps to establish what theories already exist, the relationships between them, to what degree the existing theories have been investigated, and to develop new hypotheses to be tested. Often this form is used to help establish a lack of appropriate theories or reveal that current theories are inadequate for explaining new or emerging research problems. The unit of analysis can focus on a theoretical concept or a whole theory or framework.\n\nNOTE: Most often the literature review will incorporate some combination of types. For example, a review that examines literature supporting or refuting an argument, assumption, or philosophical problem related to the research problem will also need to include writing supported by sources that establish the history of these arguments in the literature.\n\nBaumeister, Roy F. and Mark R.

Thinking About Your Literature Review\n\nThe structure of a literature review should include the following in support of understanding the research problem:\n\nAn overview of the subject, issue, or theory under consideration, along with the objectives of the literature review,\n\nDivision of works under review into themes or categories [e.g. works that support a particular position, those against, and those offering alternative approaches entirely],\n\nAn explanation of how each work is similar to and how it varies from the others,\n\nConclusions as to which pieces are best considered in their argument, are most convincing of their opinions, and make the greatest contribution to the understanding and development of their area of research.\n\nThe critical evaluation of each work should consider:\n\nProvenance -- what are the author's credentials? Are the author's arguments supported by evidence [e.g. primary historical material, case studies, narratives, statistics, recent scientific findings]?\n\nMethodology -- were the techniques used to identify, gather, and analyze the data appropriate to addressing the research problem? Was the sample size appropriate? Were the results effectively interpreted and reported?\n\nObjectivity -- is the author's perspective even-handed or prejudicial? Is contrary data considered or is certain pertinent information ignored to prove the author's point?\n\nPersuasiveness -- which of the author's theses are most convincing or least convincing?\n\nValidity -- are the author's arguments and conclusions convincing? Does the work ultimately contribute in any significant way to an understanding of the subject?\n\nII. Development of the Literature Review\n\nFour Basic Stages of Writing\n\n1. Problem formulation -- which topic or field is being examined and what are its component issues?\n\n2. Literature search -- finding materials relevant to the subject being explored.\n\n3. Data evaluation -- determining which literature makes a significant contribution to the understanding of the topic.\n\n4. Analysis and interpretation -- discussing the findings and conclusions of pertinent literature.\n\nConsider the following issues before writing the literature review:\n\nClarify\n\nIf your assignment is not specific about what form your literature review should take, seek clarification from your professor by asking these questions:\n\n1. Roughly how many sources would be appropriate to include?\n\n2. What types of sources should I review (books, journal articles, websites; scholarly versus popular sources)?\n\n3. Should I summarize, synthesize, or critique sources by discussing a common theme or issue?\n\n4. Should I evaluate the sources in any way beyond evaluating how they relate to understanding the research problem?\n\n5. Should I provide subheadings and other background information, such as definitions and/or a history?\n\nFind Models\n\nUse the exercise of reviewing the literature to examine how authors in your discipline or area of interest have composed their literature review sections. Read them to get a sense of the types of themes you might want to look for in your own research or to identify ways to organize your final review. The bibliography or reference section of sources you've already read, such as required readings in the course syllabus, are also excellent entry points into your own research.\n\nNarrow the Topic\n\nThe narrower your topic, the easier it will be to limit the number of sources you need to read in order to obtain a good survey of relevant resources. Your professor will probably not expect you to read everything that's available about the topic, but you'll make the act of reviewing easier if you first limit scope of the research problem. A good strategy is to begin by searching the USC Libraries Catalog for recent books about the topic and review the table of contents for chapters that focuses on specific issues. You can also review the indexes of books to find references to specific issues that can serve as the focus of your research. For example, a book surveying the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict may include a chapter on the role Egypt has played in mediating the conflict, or look in the index for the pages where Egypt is mentioned in the text.\n\nConsider Whether Your Sources are Current\n\nSome disciplines require that you use information that is as current as possible. This is particularly true in disciplines in medicine and the sciences where research conducted becomes obsolete very quickly as new discoveries are made. However, when writing a review in the social sciences, a survey of the history of the literature may be required. In other words, a complete understanding the research problem requires you to deliberately examine how knowledge and perspectives have changed over time. Sort through other current bibliographies or literature reviews in the field to get a sense of what your discipline expects. You can also use this method to explore what is considered by scholars to be a \"hot topic\" and what is not.\n\nIII. Ways to Organize Your Literature Review\n\nChronology of Events\n\nIf your review follows the chronological method, you could write about the materials according to when they were published. This approach should only be followed if a clear path of research building on previous research can be identified and that these trends follow a clear chronological order of development. For example, a literature review that focuses on continuing research about the emergence of German economic power after the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\nBy Publication\n\nOrder your sources by publication chronology, then, only if the order demonstrates a more important trend. For instance, you could order a review of literature on environmental studies of brown fields if the progression revealed, for example, a change in the soil collection practices of the researchers who wrote and/or conducted the studies.\n\nThematic [“conceptual categories”]\n\nA thematic literature review is the most common approach to summarizing prior research in the social and behavioral sciences. Thematic reviews are organized around a topic or issue, rather than the progression of time, although the progression of time may still be incorporated into a thematic review. For example, a review of the Internet’s impact on American presidential politics could focus on the development of online political satire. While the study focuses on one topic, the Internet’s impact on American presidential politics, it would still be organized chronologically reflecting technological developments in media. The difference in this example between a \"chronological\" and a \"thematic\" approach is what is emphasized the most: themes related to the role of the Internet in presidential politics. Note that more authentic thematic reviews tend to break away from chronological order. A review organized in this manner would shift between time periods within each section according to the point being made.\n\nMethodological\n\nA methodological approach focuses on the methods utilized by the researcher. For the Internet in American presidential politics project, one methodological approach would be to look at cultural differences between the portrayal of American presidents on American, British, and French websites. Or the review might focus on the fundraising impact of the Internet on a particular political party. A methodological scope will influence either the types of documents in the review or the way in which these documents are discussed.\n\nOther Sections of Your Literature Review\n\nOnce you've decided on the organizational method for your literature review, the sections you need to include in the paper should be easy to figure out because they arise from your organizational strategy. In other words, a chronological review would have subsections for each vital time period; a thematic review would have subtopics based upon factors that relate to the theme or issue. However, sometimes you may need to add additional sections that are necessary for your study, but do not fit in the organizational strategy of the body. What other sections you include in the body is up to you. However, only include what is necessary for the reader to locate your study within the larger scholarship about the research problem.\n\nHere are examples of other sections, usually in the form of a single paragraph, you may need to include depending on the type of review you write:\n\nCurrent Situation: Information necessary to understand the current topic or focus of the literature review.\n\nSources Used: Describes the methods and resources [e.g., databases] you used to identify the literature you reviewed.\n\nHistory: The chronological progression of the field, the research literature, or an idea that is necessary to understand the literature review, if the body of the literature review is not already a chronology.\n\nSelection Methods: Criteria you used to select (and perhaps exclude) sources in your literature review. For instance, you might explain that your review includes only peer-reviewed [i.e., scholarly] sources.\n\nStandards: Description of the way in which you present your information.\n\nQuestions for Further Research: What questions about the field has the review sparked? How will you further your research as a result of the review?\n\nIV. Writing Your Literature Review\n\nOnce you've settled on how to organize your literature review, you're ready to write each section. When writing your review, keep in mind these issues.\n\nUse Evidence\n\nA literature review section is, in this sense, just like any other academic research paper. Your interpretation of the available sources must be backed up with evidence [citations] that demonstrates that what you are saying is valid.\n\nBe Selective\n\nSelect only the most important points in each source to highlight in the review. The type of information you choose to mention should relate directly to the research problem, whether it is thematic, methodological, or chronological. Related items that provide additional information, but that are not key to understanding the research problem, can be included in a list of further readings.\n\nUse Quotes Sparingly\n\nSome short quotes are appropriate if you want to emphasize a point, or if what an author stated cannot be easily paraphrased. Sometimes you may need to quote certain terminology that was coined by the author, is not common knowledge, or taken directly from the study. Do not use extensive quotes as a substitute for using your own words in reviewing the literature.\n\nSummarize and Synthesize\n\nRemember to summarize and synthesize your sources within each thematic paragraph as well as throughout the review. Recapitulate important features of a research study, but then synthesize it by rephrasing the study's significance and relating it to your own work and the work of others.\n\nKeep Your Own Voice\n\nWhile the literature review presents others' ideas, your voice [the writer's] should remain front and center. For example, weave references to other sources into what you are writing but maintain your own voice by starting and ending the paragraph with your own ideas and wording.\n\nUse Caution When Paraphrasing\n\nWhen paraphrasing a source that is not your own, be sure to represent the author's information or opinions accurately and in your own words. Even when paraphrasing an author’s work, you still must provide a citation to that work.\n\nV. Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\nThese are the most common mistakes made in reviewing social science research literature.\n\nSources in your literature review do not clearly relate to the research problem;\n\nYou do not take sufficient time to define and identify the most relevant sources to use in the literature review related to the research problem;\n\nRelies exclusively on secondary analytical sources rather than including relevant primary research studies or data;\n\nUncritically accepts another researcher's findings and interpretations as valid, rather than examining critically all aspects of the research design and analysis;\n\nDoes not describe the search procedures that were used in identifying the literature to review;\n\nReports isolated statistical results rather than synthesizing them in chi-squared or meta-analytic methods; and,\n\nOnly includes research that validates assumptions and does not consider contrary findings and alternative interpretations found in the literature.\n\nCook, Kathleen E. and Elise Murowchick. “Do Literature Review Skills Transfer from One Course to Another?” Psychology Learning and Teaching 13 (March 2014): 3-11; Fink, Arlene.
