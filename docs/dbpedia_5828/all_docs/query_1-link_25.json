My first task as a market researcher was to ask people what they thought about a black and white image of a scrawny cat with a bolt through its head. The question was simple: Did the image cross the line? Would the advertising shock people into connecting with the cause, or was it a picture of cruelty so disturbing as to turn the public off? Some twenty-five years on, I’ve asked over ten thousand people what they think about almost every challenge we face as a society and every product we consume. From teenage pregnancy to tissues and from cars to cancer, you name it, I’ve researched it. Through it all, one constant theme has dominated my working life:\n\nAsking is easy. The hard part is knowing what to do with the answer.\n\nThese are the questions I’ve been grappling with since my lunch with a dead cat. When you ask people for their thoughts and feelings:\n\nHow do you choose who to listen to and who to ignore?\n\nHow do you resolve conflicting and contradictory responses?\n\nHow do you even know if the people you are asking are telling you the truth?\n\nHow do you use the answers to make good decisions rather than bad?\n\nIt’s only natural to ask people what they think. It is not possible to create, build, launch or do something of value without asking your intended audience for their opinion. And yet, in both our personal and professional lives, we regularly receive confusing feedback, mixed messages and unreliable responses, and then we’re confronted with the challenge of working out what to do next.\n\nThe ability to interpret response has never been more important than it is today. As we begin to develop ideas in a post-Covid world, we cannot presume to know what people want, feel and think. The most successful businesses are invariably those best able to satisfy the changing needs of their customers. The finest marketing campaigns perfectly capture the prevailing mood of their target audience. Now is the time to invest in insight, empathy and understanding. Fortunately, we are blessed with instant access to more feedback than we have ever had before. Social media platforms have dramatically increased the opportunities for the public to share their opinions. The inseparable relationship people have with their mobile phones makes it possible for them to record their instinctive in-the-moment reactions to ideas as they go about their daily lives. The pandemic has accelerated the adoption of video calling as the new home for conversation, making it significantly more convenient for businesses to connect with their consumers across the globe. And yet, despite the wealth of feedback at our fingertips, it doesn’t get any easier to work out what to do with the response. In an increasingly opinion-rich digital world, it becomes ever harder to understand what people truly think of our ideas and make good decisions as a result.\n\nLet Asking for Trouble be your guide as you travel through a land that is both enlightening and disorientating, in equal measure. It is a tale of three parts:\n\nUnderstanding\n\nTruth\n\nA Guide to Good Asking\n\nPart One introduces an analytical framework designed to help you better interpret response. Part Two describes an approach to asking that will get you closer to the truth. And Part Three provides practical advice, hints and tips on how to get the most out of the experience of asking.\n\nThere is another part to the story. And that part is you. You are the golden thread that runs through every page of this book. My aim is not only to demonstrate the vital role you play in understanding response and getting closer to the truth, but also, to encourage you to better balance your own instincts with other people’s opinions, and ultimately, empower you to have more confidence in yourself and the decisions you make.\n\nWhether you’re a marketing director striving to grow your brands, an entrepreneur nurturing a new concept, a policymaker hoping to build a brighter world, an eager market researcher foisting images of emaciated animals on an unsuspecting public, or you’ve got a good idea and you want to know what people think; this book is for you.\n\nPart I\n\nUnderstanding\n\n‘Words are illusions’\n\nBodhidharma: Founder of Zen Buddhism\n\n1\n\nThe Illusion of Interest\n\nSome years ago, I spent the summer talking to troubled teenagers about sex. I needed to get their opinions on a range of ideas designed to encourage young men and women to consider contraception, and to think carefully about the consequences of unprotected sex.\n\nEverything was set fair. I was perched on a leather footstool in the living room of a small two-up two-down, in a forgotten housing estate at the heart of a broken seaside town. It was a warm summer’s afternoon, and the open patio doors welcomed a gentle sea breeze into the modest room that served as my place of work for the day.\n\nMy first four boys turned up, a tight-knit group of friends who lived in care. There’s an inextricable link between poverty and teenage pregnancy, and these lads were from tough backgrounds. Welcoming the boys into the living room, I sat them down on the sofas, handed over their financial incentive and introduced myself. The boys looked at each other, they looked at me, then back at each other – and they were gone. Through the open patio doors, clambering over the six-foot garden wall and away with the cash. Never to be seen again.\n\nLesson one: Asking people what they think of an idea relies heavily on having people to ask.\n\nMy next session was more successful. I met Finn.\n\nFinn was seventeen, and he was a dad. Kaylie, his daughter, was two, but he didn’t have much to do with her. Finn still saw his own father, lying by the bins as you turned left out of the lifts, a life destroyed by hard memories and harder drugs. Chatting together on that warm summer’s afternoon, it wasn’t hard to ask Finn what he thought. He was one of the smartest young men I had ever met and he had plenty to say. Asking was easy.\n\nSo, here’s the question:\n\nWhich of the two experiences of asking better reflects how people engage with ideas in the real world? The desperate leap over the garden wall or the conscientious living-room conversation? It’s no contest. Leaping lads beat friendly Finn every time. That is the trouble with asking. The interest shown in our ideas is an illusion.\n\nAsk people what they think, and they focus. It makes no difference whether you’re talking to a friend over a cup of coffee, seeking advice from a highly qualified team of experts, thoughtfully exploring the pros and cons of your idea in depth interviews, discussing alternative creative concepts with potential customers in research groups, or questioning one thousand anonymous souls online; the act of asking encourages people to pay attention to your idea in a way that is totally out of sync with how they would behave in the real world.\n\nWhatever the nature of your idea, be it an app or an advert, a product or policy, business or book, successful asking starts with the acceptance of this simple principle:\n\nWhen we ask people what they think, the focus on our idea creates an illusion of interest. They have only engaged because we have asked them to.\n\nThe illusion of interest is an inevitable and unavoidable consequence of asking people what they think. To make good decisions based on other people’s opinions, we must first acknowledge that the world of asking is a land of make-believe. Think of it like this. When we ask people for feedback, we’re having a nice, intelligent chat with Finn. But the conversation is an illusion. In the real world, our intended audience has jumped over the garden wall and is legging it down the street. And that makes all the difference.\n\nThe Disappearing Robot\n\nLeaning on a cardboard cut-out of a digital robot with an oversized head, Abdi smokes a quick cigarette before our chat. He searches for an ashtray, but all he can find is a plastic cup resting precariously on a small pouch – packed with information leaflets – that protrudes from the cardboard robot’s tiny waist. It’ll do. Abdi drops his cigarette into the pool of coffee lying at the bottom of the cup and ambles over to join the group.\n\nYou might recognise the happy robot stood by the double doors, welcoming all comers to the Selby Centre: a multicultural community hub in the bustling heart of Tottenham, North London.\n\nDigitAl\n\nHis name is DigitAl (Digit Al, get it?), and he was the centrepiece of an enormous multimedia campaign that accompanied the UK’s switch to digital TV, finally completed in October 2012. For years, Al was everywhere: on TV, social media, posters, newspapers, bus sides and bus stops. You couldn’t miss him.\n\nAl did a good job of communicating the information the public required for a smooth switchover, with one exception. For some reason, critical messages didn’t seem to be getting through to poorer, immigrant communities around the UK. Something wasn’t working. Digital UK, the government body set up to manage the switchover, held countless research groups to try and understand why. Abdi and his friends gathered around large, life-size cardboard cut-outs of Al before the start of the group, sharing with him their stories, cigarettes and empty coffee cups.\n\nYet moments later, when asked what they thought of the advertising featuring DigitAl, they didn’t recognise him. More than that, they were certain they had"
