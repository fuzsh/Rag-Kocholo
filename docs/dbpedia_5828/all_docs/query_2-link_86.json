        "text": "An IRS audit is a review/examination of an organization's or individual's books, accounts and financial records to ensure information reported on their tax return is reported correctly according to the tax laws and to verify the reported amount of tax is correct.\n\nWhy am I being selected for an audit?\n\nHow am I notified?\n\nHow will the IRS conduct my audit?\n\nWhat do I need to provide?\n\nHow do I know if the IRS received my response?\n\nWhat if I need more time to respond?\n\nWhat happens if I don't respond by the due date?\n\nHow far back can the IRS go to audit my return?\n\nHow long does an audit take?\n\nWhat are my rights?\n\nHow does the IRS conclude an audit?\n\nWhat happens when I agree with the audit findings?\n\nWhat happens when I disagree with the audit findings?\n\nWhy am I being selected for an audit?\n\nSelection for an audit does not always suggest there's a problem. The IRS uses several different selection methods:\n\nRandom selection and computer screening - sometimes returns are selected based solely on a statistical formula. We compare your tax return against \"norms\" for similar returns. We develop these \"norms\" from audits of a statistically valid random sample of returns, as part of the National Research Program the IRS conducts. The IRS uses this program to update return selection information.\n\nRelated examinations – we may select your returns when they involve issues or transactions with other taxpayers, such as business partners or investors, whose returns were selected for audit.\n\nNote: filing an amended return does not affect the selection process of the original return. However, amended returns also go through a screening process and the amended return may be selected for audit. Additionally, a refund is not necessarily a trigger for an audit.\n\nHow am I notified?\n\nShould your account be selected for audit, we will notify you by mail. We won't initiate an audit by telephone.\n\nAssistance is available to help you understand the letter/notice received:\n\nUnderstanding your IRS notice or letter\n\nTopic No. 654, Understanding Your CP75 or CP75A Notice Request for Supporting Documentation\n\nHow will the IRS conduct my audit?\n\nThe IRS conducts audits either by mail or through an in-person interview to review your records. The interview may be at an IRS office (office audit) or at the taxpayer's home, place of business, or accountant's/representative’s office (field audit). Remember, you will be contacted initially by mail. The IRS will provide all contact information and instructions in the letter you receive.\n\nIf we conduct your audit by mail, our letter will request additional information about certain items shown on the tax return such as income, expenses, and itemized deductions. If you have too many books or records to mail, you can request a face-to-face audit. The IRS will provide contact information and instructions in the letter you receive.\n\nDepending on the issues in your audit, IRS examiners may use one of these Audit Techniques Guides to assist them. These guides will give you an idea of what to expect.\n\nWhat do I need to provide?\n\nThe IRS will provide you with a written request for the specific documents we want to see. Here's a listing of records the IRS may request.\n\nThe IRS accepts some electronic records in lieu of or in addition to other types of records. Contact your auditor to determine what we can accept.\n\nThe law requires you to keep all records you used to prepare your tax return – for at least three years from the date the tax return was filed.\n\nHow do I know if the IRS received my response?\n\nFor any delivery service you may use, always request confirmation that the IRS has received your response. For example, if you use the US Postal Service, you can request one of their additional services to ensure delivery confirmation.\n\nWhat if I need more time to respond?\n\nFor audits conducted by mail – Fax your written request to the number shown on the IRS letter you received. If you are unable to submit the request by fax, mail your request to the address shown on the IRS letter. We can ordinarily grant you a one-time automatic 30-day extension. We will contact you if we are unable to grant your extension request. However, if you received a \"Notice of Deficiency\" by certified mail, we cannot grant additional time for you to submit supporting documentation. You may continue to work with us to resolve your tax matter, but we cannot extend the time you have to petition the U.S. Tax Court beyond the original 90 days.\n\nFor audits conducted by in-person interview – If your audit is being conducted in person, contact the auditor assigned to your audit to request an extension. If necessary, you may contact the auditor's manager.\n\nWhat happens if I don't respond by the due date?\n\nIt's very important that we hear from you by the date shown on your letter or notice. If you don’t respond by the date shown on the letter or notice, we will complete our audit and send you an audit report with our proposed changes to your tax return.\n\nHow far back can the IRS go to audit my return?\n\nGenerally, the IRS can include returns filed within the last three years in an audit. If we identify a substantial error, we may add additional years. We usually don't go back more than the last six years.\n\nThe IRS tries to audit tax returns as soon as possible after they are filed. Accordingly, most audits will be of returns filed within the last two years.\n\nIf an audit is not resolved, we may request extending the statute of limitations for assessment tax. The statute of limitations is a time period established by law when IRS can review, analyze, and resolve your tax-related issues. When the statutory period expires, we can no longer assess or collect additional tax, or allow you to claim a refund. It is generally three years after a return is due or was filed, whichever is later. There is also a statute of limitations for making refunds. For more information, see Statute Expiration Dates. Extending the statute gives you more time to provide further documentation to support your position; request an appeal if you do not agree with the audit results; or to claim a tax refund or credit. It also gives the IRS time to complete the audit and provides time to process the audit results.\n\nYou don't have to agree to extend the statute of limitations date. However, if you don't agree, the auditor will be forced to make a determination based upon the information provided.\n\nYou can find more information about extending a statute of limitations in Publication 1035, Extending the Tax Assessment Period PDF, or from your auditor.\n\nHow long does an audit take?\n\nThe length varies depending on the type of audit; the complexity of the issues; the availability of information requested; the availability of both parties for scheduling meetings; and your agreement or disagreement with the findings.\n\nWhat are my rights?\n\nPublication 1, Your Rights as a Taxpayer, explains your rights as a taxpayer as well as the examination, appeal, collection, and refund processes. These rights include:\n\nA right to professional and courteous treatment by IRS employees.\n\nA right to privacy and confidentiality about tax matters.\n\nA right to know why the IRS is asking for information, how the IRS will use it and what will happen if the requested information is not provided.\n\nA right to representation, by oneself or an authorized representative.\n\nA right to appeal disagreements, both within the IRS and before the courts.\n\nHow does the IRS conclude an audit?\n\nAn audit can be concluded in three ways:\n\nNo change: an audit in which you have substantiated all of the items being reviewed and results in no changes.\n\nAgreed: an audit where the IRS proposed changes and you understand and agree with the changes.\n\nDisagreed: an audit where the IRS has proposed changes and you understand but disagree with the changes.\n\nWhat happens when I agree with the audit findings?\n\nIf you agree with the audit findings, you will be asked to sign the examination report or a similar form depending upon the type of audit conducted.\n\nIf you owe money, there are several payment options available. Publication 594, The IRS Collection Process PDF, explains the collection process in detail.\n\nWhat happens when I disagree with the audit findings?"
