When I was young, my father used to admonish me by saying that I was "asking for trouble." How about now? Am I still ever volunteering for trouble? All we ever have to do is to be who we are. If our family and friends express disapproval, that's their problem. Unless, of course, we start fretting about it to the point that we start erasing real parts of ourselves to please others; then it becomes our problem. We are "asking for trouble."

A popular song in the 1960's stated, "I've Gotta Be Me." If you're being true to yourself and it isn't enough for the people around you, maybe it's time to change the people around you. We are here for a very short time and in this one quick and precious life, we owe it to our self to grow into the fullness of our being. We admire flowers, plants and trees when they are in full bloom. Don't we owe the same respect to our self?

Love yourself enough to move away from anyone who hurts you or doesn't treat you respectfully. It's unrealistic to expect everyone to like us. It's not unrealistic to expect everyone to show us respect. Your current situation is not your final destination. Like everything else in the natural world, we are in a constant state of change. If we trust our instincts and grow into the energies that want to become realized through us, we will attract new people who will like and respect our evolution. If we make ourselves small so that we "fit in," we really are asking for trouble.
