        "text": "PATRIK STOLLARZ/Getty Images\n\nArsenal have reportedly held preliminary talks with Freiburg regarding the potential summer signing of Caglar Soyuncu.\n\nAccording to Simon Jones of MailOnline, the 21-year-old defender has caught Gunners recruitment chief Sven Mislintat's eye. As well as Arsenal, Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea and AS Roma have been credited with an interest in the player.\n\nMislintat is said to be \"well aware of Soyuncu's progress and is weighing up a summer bid,\" although the Bundesliga side value the Turkey international at around £30 million. Arsenal representatives were in attendance at Turkey's recent 1-0 win over the Republic of Ireland to scout the player.\n\nJones also noted Soyuncu's playing style has drawn comparisons to Bayern Munich's Mats Hummels.\n\nThe Gunners have developed a reputation for being fragile at the back in recent seasons under manager Arsene Wenger and appear keen to strengthen the heart of their defence in the summer. Jonny Evans, who is available for £3 million should West Bromwich Albion be relegated, also reportedly remains a target.\n\nHowever, Soyuncu's potential arrival is likely to trigger more excitement among the Arsenal fanbase. Here's a look at what he could offer:\n\nThe defender has been a mainstay at the heart of the Freiburg side this season, making 21 appearances in the Bundesliga for his team. Despite his tender years, he has also already accrued 13 senior caps for his country.\n\nHis development has been impressive, having only arrived at the German club in 2016 from second-tier Turkish side Altinordu.\n\nThe Turkish Football Twitter account commented on his rapid rise last season:\n\nFrom that point, Soyuncu has gone from strength to strength. It's not a shock to see some big names linked with a player of tremendous promise.\n\nJulian Finney/Getty Images\n\nArsenal would benefit from adding a commanding young centre-back to the side. Laurent Koscielny has endured a number of injury issues this term, while Shkodran Mustafi is inconsistent alongside him. Per Mertesacker is set to retire, and there are doubts as to whether Rob Holding and Calum Chambers are at the standard required.\n\nSoyuncu could be a defensive mainstay at the Emirates Stadium if he were to arrive at the end of the season. However, if the high-profile clubs mentioned do retain an interest in the player, getting him to north London would be a big challenge."
