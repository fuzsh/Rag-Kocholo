        "text": "Caglar Soyuncu has looked a player reborn since the appointment of Leicester City’s interim management trio.\n\nA player who had started just one league game all season having been cast aside by Brendan Rodgers has begun both games under Dean Smith, Craig Shakespeare and John Terry. The Turkey international’s performances have justified his inclusion, leaving supporters baffled as to why he had been so readily discarded by the previous regime — particularly in the context of the team’s defensive issues all season.\n\nNow, just as Soyuncu has started to look more like his old self, it has emerged that the defender is set to sign for Atletico Madrid on a free transfer when his contract at Leicester expires in the summer. The Spanish club may be securing a player revitalised after a season spent largely in the shadows.\n\nSoyuncu’s fall from grace under Rodgers was spectacular.\n\nThe Northern Irishman had actually coaxed the best out of the centre-back upon succeeding Claude Puel in 2019. From being fourth choice, a defender prone to individual mistakes, Soyuncu was given a consistent run in the side and was named in the Premier League team of the season at the end of the 2019-20 campaign.\n\nNiggling injuries have been an issue in the period since, and Soyuncu’s form certainly dipped after Turkey’s poor showing at Euro 2020 — a tournament delayed for a year by the COVID-19 pandemic. There was a huge weight of expectation placed on Soyuncu’s shoulders at those finals. In a young Turkey team, he was a senior Premier League player who took on the responsibility as a leader. With that inevitably came criticism when results faltered. That seemed to sting him.\n\nRodgers still leaned on him at the start of the 2021-22 campaign, not least with injuries ruling out Wesley Fofana for most of the campaign and Jonny Evans, who was suffering from a plantar fasciitis problem. Soyuncu started every game in a congested first half of the season. But his form was inconsistent and he picked up a hamstring injury just before Christmas 2021.\n\nOnce he returned, Rodgers’ patience seemed to have snapped.\n\nHe was critical of Soyuncu after a 3-1 defeat at Tottenham last May, albeit without actually naming him, when he missed a 50-50 tackle with Cristian Romero in the build-up to the hosts’ second goal. “There’s no problem with the tackle,” said Rodgers. “We have to win the tackle. I’ve got a problem with us not winning the tackle. Romero was strong and aggressive and that’s what you want from your centre-half, so there’s no problem with the tackle.”\n\nThe Turk believed he was fouled and was privately upset when he learned what Rodgers had said after the match. That marked a shift in their relationship. Soyuncu remained on the bench for the remaining six fixtures of Leicester’s season.\n\nBelieving Soyuncu and Jannik Vestergaard were not up to the task, Rodgers sought to bring in another central defender that summer even before Fofana’s departure to Chelsea — a pursuit that went unfulfilled. Yet Soyuncu now knew his manager’s faith in his ability had drained away. His contract had a year left to run, but no suitors came forward. With Rodgers growing frustrated at a lack of summer transfer business, the pair were left to make the most out of a difficult situation.\n\nEven after Fofana’s departure to Chelsea, Soyuncu was an unused substitute for the opening five league games of 2022-23, with Rodgers preferring Daniel Amartey and Evans. When Amartey missed the home defeat to Manchester United on September 1, Rodgers opted to select Wilfred Ndidi as a centre-back rather than return to Soyuncu.\n\n“Cags, with the greatest of respect, has been out of form for a while in training,” Rodgers explained at the time. “Daniel Amartey was ill, so Wilf was our best option. Cags thought he was moving on, so it’s been a difficult period for him.”\n\nThe Turk did not even feature in the matchday squad for the next four fixtures, a period when he was also suffering from a knee issue. “There’s a lot that goes on behind the scenes,” offered Rodgers and when questioned again about Soyuncu’s absence. “Cags is a good man and it’s been hard for him. He had the chance then and did really well in that first season. I think it’s then probably been a mixed bag for him.\n\n“He’s there, he’s working, and if we feel he’s in that right moment to come in, we will do that. But you can only judge on what you’re seeing in training. His professionalism has been superb, but you’ve just got to always pick the team that’s the best collective.”\n\nBy December, Rodgers had surprisingly indicated contract talks had begun with Soyuncu’s representatives, adding: “Cags is a great guy. We want him to stay here.” But, by then, Soyuncu considered his future to lie elsewhere.\n\nWhile Atletico’s interest did not crystallise in the January window, the move is set to go through in the summer under freedom of contract.\n\nIt was Soyuncu’s displays in training that caught Terry’s eye following his arrival as part of Smith’s backroom staff earlier this month.\n\nThe former Chelsea centre-back has been working closely with Leicester’s defensive unit and with each player individually, both on the training pitch and in the video analysis room. He told Smith early on that they “had a player” on their hands.\n\nSmith spoke with Soyuncu to assess his mindset and has found the 26-year-old eager to play, despite his time at Leicester winding down.\n\n“I don’t know what’s gone on before I got here,” Smith said after Saturday’s win over Wolverhampton Wanderers, where Soyuncu started alongside Wout Faes in a back four. “All I can do is talk about since I arrived. I’ve seen a player who’s committed to the club, trains really well and his performance has shown that as well.\n\n“I sat down with him ahead of the Manchester City game and asked where he was at, to see if he felt he was in a good place. He just loves football. He wants to play football.”\n\nSoyuncu isn’t the only player to have responded to the arrival of the new coaching trio. Boubakary Soumare produced an excellent second-half display against Wolves, while Kelechi Iheanacho has scored in both games under Smith.\n\n“We’ve given them training sessions where they can impress us and, if they’ve impressed us, then they have the right to start,” said Smith when asked what they had done to provoke the reaction. “They’ve started and performed how we’ve seen them performing in training. I’ve not met a professional player who wants to play badly. They all like a pat on the back. They all like to be told they’ve done well, but the way we work is you’ll get that pat on the back and you’ll be told you’ve done well if you actually do it.\n\n“They’ve put in the work. They’re quality players. We’ve just given a platform to go and play.”\n\nSoyuncu’s future is not at this club. He is moving on in the summer, with La Liga and Champions League football ahead. But, over the last six games of what remains of the season, he seems determined to show that his excellence over the 2019-20 season was far from a one-off.\n\n(Top photo: Plumb Images/Leicester City FC via Getty Images)"
