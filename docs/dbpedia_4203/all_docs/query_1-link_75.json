        "text": "ANKARA\n\nThe Turkish national football team -- with a hope to bounce back in front of its fans -- is set for the Norway clash in a Friday 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifying match in Istanbul.\n\nThree players in Turkey, central defenders Caglar Soyuncu and Ozan Kabak, and central midfielder Orkun Kokcu were suspended for the match against Norway.\n\nMeanwhile, Norwegian star Erling Haaland, 21, is still having muscular problems as he did not play for his club Borussia Dortmund for a short while.\n\nNorway's main goal threat Haaland is likely to miss the Turkey match at Fenerbahce's Ulker Stadium.\n\nThe match in Istanbul's Kadikoy will start at 1845GMT.\n\nThings went reasonably well for Turkey in Group G until the previous match against the Netherlands in September.\n\nTurkey had a devastating 6-1 loss against the Netherlands in Amsterdam, which shocked the visitors and gave the Group G lead to the victors.\n\nNow in the third position in the group, Turkey racked up 11 points in six matches.\n\nThe Netherlands are on top of Group G with 13 points and leading it on goal difference.\n\nLike the leaders, the Nordic team has 13 points in Group G, currently at the second spot.\n\nOnly the group winners will automatically qualify for the 2022 World Cup. The runners-up in each group will face the playoff stage to fight for limited tickets for Qatar 2022.\n\nOn Friday, Netherlands will visit Latvia in Riga.\n\nMontenegro -- having eight points in the group -- will look for Turkey's mistake.\n\nLatvia have five points to come fifth.\n\nUnderdogs Gibraltar bottomed Group G, losing all their six matches.\n\n1st match of Kuntz as Turkey head coach\n\nTurkey in September hired Stefan Kuntz as the new head coach of its national team after Senol Gunes, whose contract was ended by mutual consent in the wake of poor results.\n\nKuntz, 58, is set for his first match as a Turkey manager.\n\nHe is a former football player and played for Turkish powerhouse Besiktas in the mid-90s.\n\nKuntz previously coached Germany's Under-21 team."
