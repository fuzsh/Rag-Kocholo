        "text": "Talk of a possible summer move to Arsenal for Caglar Soyuncu has been branded “total nonsense” by Freiburg director Jochen Saier.\n\nThe Turkey international defender is a man in demand, with his exploits for club and country bringing him onto the transfer radar of clubs across Europe.\n\nBundesliga champions Bayern Munich are keeping a close eye on a player performing on their domestic doorstep, while Arsenal are said to be keen on taking him to England.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nIt appeared as though the Gunners were about to get their man when Seyit Mehmet Ozkan, president of Soyuncu’s former club Altinordu, claimed that a deal had been done.\n\nFrieburg have, however, responded to those comments by moving quickly to rubbish any suggestion of an agreement being in place.\n\nSaier told Bild: “Ozkan can know little about the overall scenario. This is total nonsense. Arsenal did not contact me and there is no offer.”\n\nOzkan had stated at the International Football Economic Forum: “Caglar Soyuncu is set to join Arsenal.\n\n“Arsenal demanded his youth information from us. We'll earn from him if he joins Arsenal. Bayern Munich wants him too, but he's on the way to the Premier League.”\n\nSoyuncu is currently under contract at Freiburg until 2021.\n\nHe has been with the club since 2016, following their promotion to the German top-flight, and has impressed with his ability on the ball and growing maturity.\n\nAt just 21 years of age, Soyuncu is considered to be a hot prospect for the present and future.\n\nThat is why Arsenal are keen to buy into his potential, with it suggested that a €34 million will be changing hands this summer.\n\nFreiburg, though, are understandably reluctant to part with a prized asset and appear to be in no position to sanction a sale at present."
