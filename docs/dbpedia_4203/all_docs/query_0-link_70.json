        "text": "TÃ¼rkiye, formerly known as Turkey, are one of the most exciting young teams at UEFA EURO 2024, with a squad packed full of emerging talent and Champions League regulars.\n\nTÃ¼rkiye's form in the run-up to the European Championships has been shaky, with their last win coming against Germany in a friendly that finished 3-2 back in November 2023.\n\nItalian manager Vincenzo Montella will hope that he can find a winning formula that EUROs in Germany, with his side more than capable of getting past the group stages and into the knockout phase of the tournament.\n\nWith some key injuries and key players being excluded from the squad, this TÃ¼rkiye team is a work in progress. But with so much potential and talent in each key position, UEFA EURO 2024 is a fantastic chance for the squad dynamics to click and for the great individuals to become a great team.\n\nWe take a look at the players who will be key for TÃ¼rkiye, formerly known as Turkey, at UEFA EURO 2024, and which players' performances will be indicative of how well they do this summer.\n\n5. Samet Akaydin\n\n30-year-old central defender, Samet Akaydin, has surprisingly emerged as a potential starter at UEFA EURO 2024 for TÃ¼rkiye. The Fenerbache defender spent last season on loan at Panathinaikos, but has for the most part emerged as a solid option at the back for Vincenzo Montella's side after AtlÃ©tico Madrid's Ã‡aÄŸlar SÃ¶yÃ¼ncÃ¼ withdrew from the Turkish squad through injury. Samet Akaydin has impressed in recent friendlies, including their World Cup Qualifier with Wales where he was one of the best players on the pitch that night. Despite only being officially capped 3 times, Samet Akaydin's towering presence in the TÃ¼rkiye defence could be integral to their performance at UEFA EURO 2024.\n\n4. Orkun KÃ¶kÃ§Ã¼\n\nThe SL Benfica number 10 spent the majority of the season on the bench having fallen out with manager Roger Schmidt. The talent of KÃ¶kÃ§Ã¼ is undeniable, and with a potential summer move on the cards away from Lisbon, he will be hoping to put in standout performances for TÃ¼rkiye at UEFA EURO 2024 to attract suitors.\n\n3. Muhammed Kerem AktÃ¼rkoÄŸlu\n\nMuhammed Kerem AktÃ¼rkoÄŸlu is a 25-year-old winger who plays for Galatasaray. In the 23/24 season, AktÃ¼rkoÄŸlu registered an impressive 12 goals and 6 assists in the Turkish SÃ¼per Lig, translating to a goal involvement every 133 minutes. AktÃ¼rkoÄŸlu is a throwback to a classic inverted winger, playing out on the left flank and enjoys running directly at defenders. AktÃ¼rkoÄŸlu will be a wide outlet for Vincenzo Montella's side and can be a real game-changer at UEFA EURO 2024 for TÃ¼rkiye. AktÃ¼rkoÄŸlu finished the season in the top 5% of wingers in Europe for non-penalty expected goals (npxG).\n\n2. Semih KÄ±lÄ±Ã§soy\n\n18-year-old striker, Semih KÄ±lÄ±Ã§soy, has netted an impressive 11 goals and 4 assists for BeÅŸiktaÅŸ this season in the TÃ¼rkiye Super Lig. Despite his age, KÄ±lÄ±Ã§soy is incredibly versatile and can play anywhere across the forward line. KÄ±lÄ±Ã§soy is a very technical forward who is highly adept at dribbling and taking players on, he is great at drawing fouls and most importantly he is an excellent finisher. Where Semih KÄ±lÄ±Ã§soy may fall short for TÃ¼rkiye at UEFA EURO 2024 is in his lack of physicality and ability to hold up the ball.\n\n1. Hakan Ã‡alhanoÄŸlu\n\nThere is nothing that can be said about Inter Milan midfielder and TÃ¼rkiye captain Hakan Ã‡alhanoÄŸlu that hasn't been said already. Ã‡alhanoÄŸlu is a model professional and an incredibly well-rounded midfielder, who, at 30 years old, will be hoping to drive his nation to historic success at UEFA EURO 2024. TÃ¼rkiye made the semi-finals at EURO 2008, and Hakan Ã‡alhanoÄŸlu will hope that his free-kick-taking, goalscoring and playmaking abilities can drive TÃ¼rkiye even further as one of the best-performing underdogs at the tournament.\n\nBonus players: Arda GÃ¼ler & Kenan Yildiz\n\nTÃ¼rkiye's two brightest young wonderkids playing at Euro 2024, Arda GÃ¼ler and Kenan Yildiz are unknowns in terms of what role and impact they will have on the first team.\n\nIt's believed that GÃ¼ler may start on the right-hand side, whilst Kenan Yildiz will be introduced slowly into the TÃ¼rkiye national team setup after only making 7 appearances for the Turkish side.\n\nThe 19-year-old Real Madrid wonderkid, GÃ¼ler finally got his chance to shine towards the backend of the LALIGA season, with Los Blancos' Champions League run paving the way for rotation and first-team minutes. It hasn't quite clicked yet with the TÃ¼rkiye National Team with the youngster still finding his position for both club and country. TÃ¼rkiye manager, Vincenzo Montella, stated just days before the UEFA EURO 2024 that Arda GÃ¼ler's best position is on the right-wing, as opposed to playing as a number 10.\n\nIf you want more in-depth football analysis and exclusive newsletters like this, consider becoming a part of our growing community of cultured football fans with our free and paid memberships.\n\nYour support is vital to our ability to grow and improve our independent football newsroom.\n\nMore UEFA EURO 2024 stories:"
