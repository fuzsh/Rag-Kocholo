Turkiye Vs Portugal: Montella's side suffered another setback on Friday when it was revealed that Enes Unal had fractured a toe on his left foot, ruling him out of UEFA Euro 2024. Unal, 27, has managed only three goals in 33 caps for his country, but he made a positive impression for Bournemouth in the second half of last season after joining from Getafe. Turkey will kick off their Euro Cup 2024 campaign against Georgia on June 18, before facing Portugal and the Czech Republic in their final two matches in Group F. However, the Crescent-Stars will first face Italy and Poland in two warm-up matches. Turkish star Unal's Euro Cup Germany dream dashed by fractured toe.\n\n2.

The Turkish Football Federation (TFF) announced Unal's removal from the Euro Cup Germany extended squad due to a fractured big toe on his left foot. Consequently, Turkey will be without Soyuncu and Unal for this summer's tournament, as both players had to withdraw from the preliminary squad initially assembled by national team manager Vincenzo Montella. Turkiye Vs Portugal: Soyuncu's injury occurred while representing loan club Fenerbahce, resulting in a thigh injury that will keep him sidelined for at least three weeks. Meanwhile, Unal sustained a fractured toe during training, ruling him out of the competition. Enes Unal had been delivering impressive performances for Bournemouth, prompting the club to exercise a purchase option following a successful loan from Getafe. These injuries have further disrupted Turkey's preparations for UEFA Euro 2024. The national team is scheduled to commence their campaign against Georgia on June 18, followed by encounters against Portugal and the Czech Republic in Group F. Before the tournament's commencement, the Crescent-Stars will engage in warm-up matches against Italy and Poland. Turkiye Vs Georgia: The Turkish Football Federation focused on key players Despite these setbacks, the team retains optimism, counting on key players like Cenk Tosun and Hakan Calhanoglu to fulfil crucial competitive roles. The Turkish Football Federation (TFF) confirmed Unal's\n\n3. withdrawal from the extended squad due to his injury, presenting an additional challenge to Vincenzo Montella's final squad selection process. Prepare for an electrifying time at the Euro Cup. Secure your Turkiye Vs Georgia Tickets today and join the excitement as we cheer for our team on the big stage. The TFF disclosed that an examination and tests conducted after the Turkish National Team's training session on Saturday revealed a fracture in Unal's left big toe. Consequently, given the determination that Unal's injury will not fully heal during UEFA Euro 2024, he has been excluded from the Turkish National Team's Euro Cup 2024 extended squad. Turkiye Vs Portugal: Enes Unal has donned the Türkiye National Team jersey since 2015, earning recognition as the player of the year in Türkiye in 2022. Midway through the season, he was loaned to Bournemouth, where his stellar performances led to the English club exercising the purchase option, heralding their return to the Premier League after an extended absence. With a current market value of $19.54 million, as per Transfermarkt data, Unal's domestic and international impact has been significant. Turkey head coach Vincenzo Montella unveiled a preliminary 35-man squad for Euro Cup Germany this summer, with the roster set to be trimmed to 26 ahead of the competition's commencement. Turkiye Vs Portugal: Turkiye has to face Italy and Poland in their two warm-up fixtures The national team's preparation includes facing Italy and Poland in their two pre-Euro Cup 2024 warm- up fixtures before embarking on their campaign against Georgia on June 18th. Turkey is poised to confront Portugal and the Czech Republic in Group F this summer, with the Crescent-Stars striving to progress beyond the group stage for the first time since 2008.\n\n4. The initial squad featured three Premier League players: Altay Bayindir, Manchester United's backup goalkeeper, Enes Unal from Bournemouth, and Yunus Akgun from Leicester City. However, Unal's unfortunate toe fracture during training has sidelined the striker, dealing a significant blow to the national team: Turkey and Transfer Speculation. Additionally, Caglar Soyuncu's withdrawal from the squad, prompted by a thigh injury sustained at Fenerbahce, further complicates Turkey's preparations. Despite these setbacks, 32-year-old Cenk Tosun emerges as the squad's leading goalscorer, having amassed 20 goals for his national side. Tosun's role becomes even more pivotal in light of Unal's absence. Hakan Calhanoglu is set to captain the Euro 2024 squad Meanwhile, Hakan Calhanoglu, with 18 goals, is set to captain the squad at UEFA Euro 2024 in Germany. Notable inclusions also feature Roma's Zeki Celik, Galatasaray's Kaan Ayhan, and Lille's Yusuf Yazici, adding depth and experience to the Turkish lineup. Meanwhile, Arda Guler, who enjoyed regular appearances for Real Madrid in the latter stages of the 2023-24 campaign, has secured a spot in the squad. Turkiye Vs Portugal: The 19-year-old, currently standing at six, is eager to increase his international caps. Additionally, there are three uncapped players in the squad: Ahmetcan Kaplan from Ajax, Oguz Aydin from Alanyaspor, and Semih Kilicsoy from Besiktas. Their inclusion raises questions about whether they will make the final roster. As head coach Montella finalizes his selection, seven players are set to be cut from the squad. The absence of Unal creates an additional opening in the attacking lineup. Kerem Akturkoglu, who has scored five goals in 28 appearances for the national team, is anticipated to play a significant role this summer. However, notable exclusions from the squad include Halil Dervisoglu, who has six goals in 16 caps, and Kenan Karaman from Schalke 04, overlooked by Montella for Euro 2024."
