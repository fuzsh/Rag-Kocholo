        "text": "= MENS VOLLEYBALL LEAGUE PRESUMPTIONS =\n\nThese presumptions have been done by a Fenerbahce Fan (ME)\n\nAfter finishing the season with 2 trophies, this year the league will be even tougher. 5 clubs have invested heavily and formed good squads. Fenerbahce, Ziraat, Halkbank, Arkas, Ist. Bld. (Although Galatasaray is inferior to these 5 clubs, they could cause some upsets. I still believe they will end up in the 6th spot.) Hence, finishing at the 5th place could be seen as “normal” under these circumstances.\n\nEven though I think there is a possibility of us finishing in the 5th place, there is also a good chance that we could still win the title.\n\nI guess what I am trying to say is, expectations from our mens volleyball team should not be extremely high because of the other teams’ high investments this year. We could end up in any of the 5 top spots this year.\n\nBesides each teams strengths, there are also some weaknesses. Such as;\n\nZiraat Bankası ;\n\nSetter ; Selçuk Keskin\n\nOutside Hitters ; Leandro Maly-Salmon Riley\n\nMiddle Blockers ; Zafer Paşaoğlu-Yasin Sancak\n\nOpposite ; İvan Contreras\n\nLibero ; Akif Gürgen\n\nZiraat’s starting squad is extraordinary. But their subs are very weak.They will especially be very strong from outsides and opposite. Contreras is as strong as Gomez.They do not have any depth to their team so we’ll see how will they do in the lengthy and exhausting league. If they can finish strong, they are one of the favorites to win the title this year.\n\nHalkbankası ;\n\nSetter ; Nikolay İvanov\n\nOutside Hitters ; Todor Aleksiev (Todor Baev)-Mustafa Kavaz\n\nMiddle Blockers ; Kemal Kayhan-Alper Güllü (Murat Çağlar)\n\nOpposite ; Danail Milushev\n\nLibero ; Hasan Yeşilbudak\n\nHalkbank’s three Bulgarians are very talented, but their Turkish players are weak. Even after 3 Bulgarian player, they will went ahead and signed another 4th Bulgarian Todor Baev. Because there cant be 4 foreign players in the starting line up at a time, they will have to choose between the two, or simply sub each other.\n\nTheir coach Stoev is ver well respected in Bulgaria and as well as in Europe.He is my favorite coach along with Demeter.\n\nArkasspor ;\n\nSetter ; Hüseyin Koç\n\nOutside Hitters ; Piotr Gruszka-Suela Mendez\n\nMiddle Blockers ; Ahmet Toçoğlu-Gökhan Öner\n\nOpposite ; Paul Duerden\n\nLibero ; Nuri Şahin\n\nAlthough Arkas’s squad is very good and well balanced, they just cannot play good together. For example, Fenerbahce killed this team last season, but if we look at the players individually, this shouldn’t have been the case. This shows me that they do not play well together. Let’s see what they could do this year.\n\nİstanbul Büyükşehir Belediyesi ;\n\nSetter ; Ulaş Kıyak\n\nOutside Hitters ; Jeroen Trommel -(They will sign another foreign player unless Sacchi has stayed.)\n\nMiddle Blockers ; Ryan Millar-Özkan Hayırlı\n\nOpposite ; Volkan Güç\n\nLibero ; Barış Özdemir\n\nBelediye is a strange club. They sign high caliber players every year, but they cannot achieve any good results. This has been the case for a few years now. Even though they have signed Volkan, Ulas, and Millar, I think it will be the same this year and they will not win the title.\n\nFENERBAHÇE ;\n\nSetter ; Arslan Ekşi\n\nOutside Hitters ; Tomislav Coskoviç-Vladimir Grbiç\n\nMiddle Blockers ; Barış Hamaz-Fatih Ulusoy (Hakan Fertelli)\n\nOpposite ; Brooke Billings\n\nLibero ; Ali Peçen\n\nLet’s see our team’s situation. Last year we had Gomez. Whenever we needed a sideout, he would kill the ball. He also hit the ball really hard. We lost this guy. Instead we signed Billings.I don’t think Billings will be as good as Gomez. I hope he will be consistent. In all honesty, the other 4 teams’ opposites are better than Billings.\n\nBut, this does not mean that we cant win the title this year. Especially because we have Gyorgy Demeter. I love his work ethic and system play.\n\nWhen Demeter signed with us last year, I was ecstatic. He is one of my favorite coaches. He has brought the system that won us Turkish Cup, and much un anticipated League Trophy. Even though we have been eliminated from the European cups at the beginning of the season due to an unfortunate loss to Halkbank, he has brought the team’s morale and reflected that into the season.\n\nYou know there are some teams and coaches where they start very strong but they cant finish strong. We have the opposite with our coach.\n\nOur biggest loss was Gomez, but one of our best side is our coach and our incredible fans. Our fans that support and cheer for their teams non stop, started to show their help in volleyball matched after football and basketball as well. They are firing up our guys when we play and become a factor on the opposite team players. Some other team players have mentioned that these fans can “wake the dead from their grave”\n\nWith Fenerbahce’s investment on volleyball and our success fans are becoming more interested in the volleyball matches. The numbers have been growing very fast and I hope that this year it would be even more. Especially against Halkbank in the finals, their support was one of the major factors of winning the title.\n\nLastly, this year the league will be very tough. Fenerbahce may finish at the top or at the 5th spot.\n\nLet’s see what the regular season and the playoffs will bring. But something is certain that it will be a very exciting league.\n\nLars Louchek\n\nI tried to find out a team in which I could make a difference\n\nSinan Cem Tanık. We expect him to continue his volleyball life abroad but he suddenly binded himself to yellow-red colours. We talked honestly about his transfer to GS, 2 years Europe experience and his future targets.\n\n-Lets start your transfer to Galatasaray. You always said that you wanted to play abroad. How could Galatasaray convince you?\n\nAt first, the increase of the game level in Turkey directed me and then I got Turkish Teams listed in my mind. Later, I tried to find out a team in which I could make a difference and built for victories. According to these feelings, I thought Galatasaray is the best place.\n\n-What do you expect from Galatasaray this year? Will the transfers be enough for championship?\n\nI believe we would play good volleyball that audience would enjoy. Technical level and potential of the team is so high. It will be a hard and tiresome period but our team has enough capacity to finish this race ahead by playing balanced and resistant volleyball. Of course we need to work much.\n\n-What do you think about Turkey League when you look at the last season?\n\nQuality raised too much. Very good foreigners came. I saw Turkish players developed and enable to carry their teams. I could not see that when I was in but I had an opportunity to look from outside for 2 years and I noticed this change. That’s good but when I think about the player base, team number is excessive. However number of the sponsors is less. I think, this is the worst problem we have. In Poland, team structure is the academy structure. They select their managers and managers find sponsors to have incomes. Managers here do not have enough knowledge about volleyball and there would nothing be good for volleyball.\n\n-What about now? Many important transfers have been done. How would be the league this season for you?\n\nAs I told, league got harder. At the same time, many big teams have been renewed. This would create unexpected situations. There will be an exciting league in which challenge would be high, results would be unknown.\n\n-Do you like the transfers? Who is the most important transfer for you?\n\nPiotr Gruszka to Arkas, Brook Billings to Fenerbahçe and our libero Richard Lambourne will be important players for their teams.\n\n-You had an operation in summer. You were away from the national team. No one knows how serious your operation was. Should you talk about your injury and your existing situation?\n\nMy doctor TAHSİN BEYZADEOĞLU told me that he fixed a few serious state at the end of the operation I had in May. I do not want to mention techically much but it was for genetic reasons. A few complains of me were solved due to my volleyball life and I neglected to strengthen. I had setrenghtening and therapy seances 4-5 hours a day in SPORTMED during all summer. Doctors thought that I would play again in 3-4 months but with the help of seances, I start to play in 2.5 months. I am still working to strenghten and it will be for almost 1 year. I believe I would play volleyball with 100% capacity before the league starts.\n\n-I want to talk about the national team. Many different improvements exposed in a short time. First your generation played many important matches which Olimpic Qualification and European Championship. What will you say about those matches?\n\nWe had 2 great chances but we could not use these chances. We could not play what we want. We lose the matches that we thought to win. But we accomplish to raise the level. We can attend the big tournements now. By keeping the level and increasing the experience, our purpose is moving to better places on the next years.\n\n-A new rejuvenescence has been done. A wide and young squad has been built. How do you evaluate the play in European League?\n\nHonestly, game and result were not much important for me in this tournement. The aim was to prepare the young players for the future and prevent their tensions in national matches. Also to find out the useful players to add the base squad for the next European Championship. I guess the trainer Fausto Polidori thought like this and built the squad. He planned to make small actions and tests when he watch the young players with a few experienced players. That’s why comments are useless about the results.\n\n-You were able to be together in the second stage of these camps and meet trainer Polidori. How did you see the position of national team?\n\nNational team’s plans were made for the future tournements and the reason of the camp I joined was we had no chance to have training with Fausto, Selçuk and Fatih and had no chance to meet the young players in order to teach them volleyball . I believe it was so useful and have to be come round when there was enough time.\n\n-You had played 2 years in Poland. How was the last season for you?\n\nIt was different from the season 1 year before. Matches intensified with the national team. Poland League was different from the year before. I turned to my team so late after European Championship. We were a new team. Opposite player and the second spiker who is my opposite had changed. We could not catch the rhythm. We got much difficulties and lose many matches that we expected to win. We were 3rd in 2 years in which I played there. We were restful for the other 3rd grade but to be 3rd in the last season was observed as a failure.\n\n-How was the medium?\n\nSo funny. I settle with the American and German. The club was more professional than the year before. Everything was done which had to be done. Homes and cars were given to the players.\n\n-How was the season for you personally?\n\nNot a good season for me because of the injuries. The season before I was carrying the team but the last season, I was a duty player. I worked on services and receive. My receive developed so much. I was the second receiver after American Libero. That is nice. We had a problem with my trainer in Poland. I had not played in last 5 matches. I was just a service player.\n\n-I know there are many offers for you both in the country and abroad teams. What was the reason that you chose Poland?\n\nThey are the 2nd in the world and it was a good point to see their quality. There are many countries facing with predatory challenges and the name wars of star players. Poland is far away from these, only good play is important. That’s why I chose there in my first year abroad. After 1 year experience, I liked their traditions, volleyball intelligence and I got a wonderful offer from my team and setter. Finally I decided to stay there. There are 10 teams in Poland and 8 of them plays for top. That makes the league contentious and amusing. Also number of the sponsors and much money magnetize the star players.\n\n-How was the audience interest in Poland?\n\nWe had a 3000 persons capacity hall. Sometimes we we played 2-3 matches a week and tickets were sold for 11-12 euro. Every match is serious. Balls and signed shirts are sold. These increase the interest. Usually halls are full. 45k tickets are sold in 48 hours. Every match is in live broadcast on tv but this never decreases the interest.\n\n-What is the reason for that?\n\nNeither Soccer nor basketball is as popular as volleyball. There are many good players. National players are in the view.\n\n-As an abroad experienced player, what will you say about the foreign players? What is the benefit for Turkish Volleyball to increase or decrease of the number of foreign player ?\n\nContribution of the foreign players to the leagues that they play in is so much unquestionable. Number of foreign players should be fixed by evaluating the level of domestic players and country volleyball. For example for Russia that has so many good players and foreign player number should make a little difference but for the countries as Italy, Greece, France and Turkey, level should decrease sharply. Arise would contribute the league level but in middle or long term, national team potential would be affected negative.\n\n-Who do you think are the good and skilful players in Turkey?\n\nIn Galatasaray, young middle players Ahmet and Ibrahim, opposite player Kemal have potentials if they work hard in the future.\n\nsource: http://www.voleybolunsesi.com"
