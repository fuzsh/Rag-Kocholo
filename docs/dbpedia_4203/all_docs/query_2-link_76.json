        "text": "Nothing sums up the godawful weirdness of the last 15 months as much as the fact that we’re about to watch Euro 2020 halfway through 2021, in largely empty stadiums that will make every match look like the time Wimbledon played their home games at Selhurst Park. But at least it is going ahead and that is something to rejoice about.\n\nThe tournament represents a beacon of hope, a beam of light amid the gloom, proof of what people are capable of when they work together. This is a tournament about shared humanity. Right up until the moment some hairy-knuckled fool starts booing the taking of the knee. And then a lumbering centre back leaves one in on a sprightly attacker, who rolls around like he’s been shot while all over the continent proud fathers teach their children how best to demonstrate the five knuckle shuffle. Ah football… such a force for good.\n\nMeh. It’s still going to be enormous fun, a festival of football, a chance to see some of the world’s greatest players or, failing that, an excuse to drink every night.\n\nAnyway, here’s GQ’s hot take on the teams. Yes, we all know Cristiano Ronaldo is good, Robert Lewandowski can score goals and England will break our hearts, but have you got the skinny on North Macedonia? Do you know your Aleksandar Trajkovski from your Eljif Elmas? You don’t? Crikey, that’s embarrassing. Looks like you got here in the nick of time. Let’s get cracking…\n\nGROUP A\n\nItaly\n\nWorld ranking: 7\n\nBest Euros finish: Winners (1968)\n\nManager: Roberto Mancini. In his 1980s and 1990s heyday, which dovetailed happily with Channel 4’s Football Italia, he was a glorious attacking talent for Sampdoria and Italy. More conservative as a manager, he has nevertheless enjoyed success at Inter and Manchester City and took over as manager of the national team three years ago, after Italy failed to qualify for a World Cup for the first time since 1958.\n\nThe team: Italy won all ten of their qualifiers, including a 9-1 demolition of Armenia. But their group was ridiculously easy, featuring ties against the aforementioned Armenia, as well as Bosnia-Herzegovina, Liechtenstein and the Chorleywood Services XI. Italy has a proud tradition of producing defenders of impossible longevity (think Franco Baresi or Paolo Maldini), but even then, their centre back pairing of Leonardo Bonucci and Giorgio Chiellini looks ancient, with the pair almost approaching the age where boiled sweets are de rigueur and policemen look young. Their midfield of Marco Verratti, Jorginho and Nicolò Barella is strong, but up front they look a little limited. Nobody in the squad has more than 12 international goals.\n\nKey man: Gianluigi Donnarumma. It is often said that goalkeepers reach their peak later than outfield players, so for Donnarumma to have 25 caps by the age of 22 isn’t half bad. More impressively, he’s happy to give orders to the Dad’s Army pair of centre backs in front of him.\n\nOne to watch: Federico Chiesa. The 23-year-old has a startlingly appalling scoring record for the national team of one goal in 25 matches – and that against Armenia. But he has just come off an impressive debut season at Juve, including scoring the winner in the Coppa Italia Final. He is quick, hard-working and, crucially, versatile, playing anywhere across the front line or tucked in behind. If Italy are to score goals (which is sort of the point of the whole exercise) he may end up being vital.\n\nTurkey\n\nWorld ranking: 29\n\nBest Euros finish: Semifinals (2008)\n\nManager: Senol Gunes. In Turkey, the former goalkeeper has the national treasure status of David Beckham, Stephen Fry, Julie Walters and Red Rum, all rolled into one, having managed the national team to third place in the 2002 World Cup. The 68-year-old even has the Trabzonspor stadium named after him. He returned to the top job in 2019, after 15 years of club management.\n\nThe team: Turkey qualified just behind France and took four points off the world champions in the qualifiers, including an impressive 2-0 home win. Unusually for a team who has traditionally adopted the Kevin Keegan “Let’s win 7-6” approach to football, their qualification was built upon a rock solid defence, which kept eight clean sheets in ten qualifiers. With Leicester’s Caglar Soyuncu and Juve’s Merih Demiral holding together the back line, more creative players such as Milan’s Hakan Calhanoglu and Lille’s Yusuf Yazici are able to service the evergreen Burak Yilmaz and strike partner Cenk Tosun up front. Their match against Wales should be crucial in deciding the group.\n\nKey man: Burak Yilmaz. The team captain is one of only two players to have represented Turkey’s big four – Besiktas, Galatasaray, Fenerbahce and Trabzonspor. If you want to know who the other one is, look it up; I can’t remember where I wrote it down. His professional career will reach the 20-year landmark next year, yet Yilmaz is in the form of his life, having just led Lille to an historic Ligue 1 title win over perennial baddies PSG, scoring the winner from the penalty spot in the deciding match. His tally of 29 international goals places him second to the great Hakan Sukur.\n\nOne to watch: Caglar Soyuncu. Such is our obsession with the glamour clubs in the UK that Soyuncu could probably walk down Oxford Street completely unrecognised, in spite of being a star at the heart of Leicester’s defence in an epic season. But in Turkey, the 25-year-old centre back is footballing royalty, combining aerial prowess and intelligent reading of the game with athleticism and a calmness on the ball.\n\nWales\n\nWorld ranking: 17\n\nBest Euros finish: Semifinals (2016)\n\nManager: Robert Page might sound like he should be a member of Led Zeppelin, but he actually clocked up 41 caps for Wales, thanks very much. Filling in for the indelicately indisposed Ryan Giggs, Page has previously managed Port Vale and Northampton, so it’s something of a step up in profile. But as he showed in his handling of a recent curfew-breaking incident, he’s not afraid to take unpopular decisions.\n\nThe team: Nobody can forget Wales’ triumphant 2016 campaign, in which they outperformed England in defeat and knocked out Belgium. Back then, they were largely dependent on the world class talents of Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey. The bad news is the two are now four years older, and beginning to eye the glue factory with a little suspicion, but they are still undeniably dangerous players, fitness permitting. The good news is, their supporting cast is now considerably stronger, including Ben Davies, Joe Allen, Dan James, David Brooks, Ben Woodburn, Ethan Ampadu and Neco Williams. Plus there is Chris Gunter, who keeps on going, and will probably be winning his 300th cap in Euro 2088 – playing on Venus.\n\nKey man: Gareth Bale. I know, boringly predictable, but what can you do? Bale is a legend, arguably the most successful footballer this island has produced in 20 years. He’s scored in European Cup finals and World Club Cup finals and is a wonderful player to watch, particularly if you can ignore the top-knot. Those who see him as a busted flush might want to refer to the hat-trick he scored for Spurs last month. He will be eager to show he’s still got it and who are we to argue?\n\nOne to watch: Dan James made a magnificent start to his Manchester United career after joining them for £15 million from Swansea in 2019. Since then, his star has waned somewhat at Old Trafford, but he remains fast, skilful, dynamic and unpredictable, and the winger has an eye for goal too.\n\nSwitzerland\n\nWorld ranking: 13\n\nBest Euros finish: Last 16 (2016)\n\nManager: Vladimir Petkovic, an ethnic Croat from Bosnia with Swiss nationality, has been manager of Switzerland for the past seven years, masterminding the greatest successes in the nation’s history, outside of the realms of clock-making and muesli. He guided his charges to the last 16 in Euro 2016 and World Cup 2018 and qualified for Euro 2020, as you’ve probably realised by now. A former social worker who helped those with substance abuse issues, he has ample perspective of both the significance and triviality of football.\n\nThe team: Switzerland is known for being a tidy, efficient, well-run country (a friend who lives in Zurich lives in terror of leaving his bins out for an hour too long, because of the horrific neighbourhood judgement that will ensue). It’s not unfair to describe the national team as the embodiment of this. They might lack the magical creativity of other nations, but they are more than the sum of their parts. The spine of the team runs through the experienced figures of goalkeeper Yann Sommer, defender Ricardo Rodríguez (OK, he’s a left back, so the spine is slightly odd-shaped), Granit Xhaka and Xherdan Shaqiri in midfield, and Haris Seferovic and Breel Embolo up front.\n\nKey man: Xherdan Shaqiri might look like a cannonball with legs, but the Alpine Messi still represents that crucial X-factor for his nation, the one player capable of moments of inspirational magic, whether out on the wing or behind the striker. With 91 caps and 23 goals, he has consistently delivered for his national team, even if he has spent a good deal of time making the teas and slicing the oranges at Anfield of late.\n\nOne to watch: Breel Embolo. The 24-year-old may not display Lewandowski-esque prolific tendencies, as five goals from 43 caps attests, but the Cameroonian-born striker is strong, intelligent and versatile and adept at creating space for others. Along with Seferovic, who scored a hat-trick against Belgium in 2018, they form a decent front line.\n\nGROUP B\n\nDenmark\n\nWorld ranking: 10\n\nBest Euros finish: Winners (1992)\n\nManager: Kasper Hjulmand. A solid if unspectacular career in Denmark’s 2nd Division came to an end at the age of just 26 when Hjulmand suffered a knee injury. Unwilling to turn his back on the sport he loved, he turned his attention to management. His career has taken him outside Denmark only once, to an unsuccessful nine-month stint at Mainz, but he has made a strong impression in his first year as coach of the national team, including wins in Iceland, England and Austria.\n\nThe team: Denmark has an absurdly rich football heritage for a country of fewer than six million people. Think of the magnificent team of the mid-1980s or the astonishing 1992 Euros win. But even then, a world ranking of tenth looks generous. Ask yourself who you would rather be in a group with, Denmark, Germany or the Netherlands? Yet they undoubtedly have a team of more than competent professionals, players such as Kasper Schmeichel, Milan’s Simon Kjaer, Chelsea’s Andreas Christensen, Thomas Delaney of Dortmund, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg of Spurs and Martin Braithwaite of (somewhat unbelievably) Barcelona. Their recent 4-0 win in a World Cup qualifier away to Austria showed serious intent, but the memory of about 25 0-0 draws with Ireland in recent years is hard to dispel.\n\nKey man: Christian Eriksen. The midfielder formed an integral part of the Italian side’s push to the Scudetto last season and with 107 caps and 36 goals for his national team, has been virtually deified back home. As admired for his humble, unshowy nature as his mercurial talents, Eriksen has played for Ajax and Spurs, after beginning his career with Middelfart. Oh, do stop it.\n\nOne to watch: Andreas Skov Olsen. The 21-year-old forward has plied his trade in Serie A for the past two seasons with Bologna. A record of three goals in 52 league appearances is unspectacular, but he has the same amount of goals in six caps for the national side, including two in the win over Austria in March.\n\nFinland\n\nWorld ranking: 54\n\nBest Euros finish: Wherever they finish this time\n\nManager: Markku Kanerva. The former primary school teacher won 59 caps for his country as a rugged defender and had managed the side for the last five years. Leading the side to their first major tournament will have secured his status as Finland’s greatest cultural figure since Lordi won the Eurovision Song Contest in 2006.\n\nThe team: It’s not unusual for teams to be almost entirely dependent on one player – think of Portugal and Ronaldo, Austria and Alaba, Denmark and Eriksen – but when that star player plays for Norwich City, it might indicate that you’re not favourites to win the tournament. The Finnish squad is made up of players plying their trade in the US, Sweden, Cyprus, Poland and Scotland. They did extraordinarily well to finish ahead of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Greece in their qualifying group, but that may be the extent of their achievements this summer. That said, they will have the backing of neutrals everywhere.\n\nKey man: Teemu Pukki. The 31-year-old striker averages a goal every other game for Norwich and has led his side back to the Premier League thanks to another free-scoring season. He scored a phenomenal ten goals in qualification and could surpass the great Jari Litmanen as the nation’s all-time top scorer, with 30 goals to his name against Litmanen’s 32.\n\nOne to watch: Lukas Hradecky. As Bayer Leverkusen’s shot-stopper, Hradecky is the only other player in the Finnish side to have a day job in one of Europe’s major leagues. With 65 caps, the 31-year-old has plenty of experience and was named Finland’s footballer of the year in 2016, 2017 and 2018. He was between the sticks in nine of his side’s ten qualifiers.\n\nBelgium\n\nWorld ranking: 1\n\nBest Euros finish: Second (1980)\n\nManager: Roberto Martínez. The former Swansea, Wigan and Everton manager is regarded with mixed feelings depending on which of his former clubs you visit and the same could be said of his reputation in Belgium. He led them to third place in the 2018 World Cup, but with the extraordinary wealth of talent at his disposal, should they have gone all the way? They’ll certainly be looking to this time.\n\nThe team: Where do you start? This is the best Belgian side in history, with world class players filling every position. Any attack featuring Romelu Lukaku, Eden Hazard and Kevin De Bruyne is going to terrify defenders and a midfield marshalled by Youri Tielemans and Axel Witsel will supply wonderful cover. Which may be just as well, as the one area of concern is the defence. Collectively, Toby Alderweireld, Jan Vertonghen and Thomas Vermaelen are older than Cheddar Gorge. Nevertheless, they must have something about them because they only conceded three goals in ten qualifiers. And scored 40. And won all ten games. Now is the time to do it on the big stage.\n\nKey man: The obvious choices are De Bruyne and Hazard, but Lukaku has a ridiculous record in his national shirt. He’s just turned 28 and he’s scored 59 international goals. Fifty-nine! He top-scored for champions Inter in Serie A, with 24 goals and eleven assists. Get him on the end of a De Bruyne through-ball or a Hazard cross and things will happen.\n\nOne to watch: Kevin De Bruyne. OK, he’s not exactly a new young buck for the side, but this team is so settled, there really is little call for fresh blood. But it will be fascinating to see if De Bruyne can overcome his recent injury picked up in the Champions’ League final and play an integral role for his country, particularly in light of Eden Hazard’s less-than-spectacular season. Injury restricted De Bruyne to just six qualifiers, but he still managed to notch up four goals and seven assists in those six.\n\nRussia\n\nWorld ranking: 38\n\nBest Euros finish: Winners (1960, as USSR)\n\nManager: Stanislav Cherchesov. The former goalkeeper is one of a rare set of players who played internationals for three countries, without changing his nationality. Thanks to the break-up of the Soviet Union, he played for the USSR, the CIS and Russia. As a manager, he led Russia to the quarterfinals of their home World Cup. By the looks of him, he’s also the manager you’d least want to have a dust up with behind the bins of Wetherspoon's.\n\nThe team: Russia won eight of their ten qualifiers, losing to Belgium twice in the process. They thumped Scotland 4-0 and with players such as Yuri Zhirkov, Denis Cheryshev, Aleksandr Golovin, Aleksei Miranchuk and Artem Dzyuba, they have some decent talent at their disposal. But their showing at the last World Cup was on the back of a hugely patriotic home support and the truth is the squad only features three players playing in stronger overseas leagues. Their lowly world ranking is probably an accurate representation of their skill level.\n\nKey man: Artem Dzyuba. The 6ft 6in striker netted nine times in qualifying and has an impressive 29 goals in 51 games for his country. Last month, he bagged the title of top scorer in the Russian league by scoring four goals in the last game of the season for champions Zenit Saint Petersburg. Needs two goals to overtake Aleksandr Kerzhakov as Russia’s all-time top scorer. Also starred in an unfortunate masturbation video in 2020.\n\nOne to watch: Aleksei Miranchuk. An attacking midfielder, Miranchuk was part of a thrilling Atalanta side that finished third in Serie A and scored 98 goals. Brother Anton plays for Lokomotiv Moscow and missed out on selection for the final squad.\n\nGROUP C\n\nNetherlands\n\nWorld ranking: 16\n\nBest Euros finish: Winners (1988)\n\nManager: Frank de Boer. In 2000 de Boer captained a much-fancied Dutch side that was hosting the Euros. In the semifinal against Italy, he missed a crucial penalty as the game went to extra time. Then it went to a penalty shootout… and he missed again. He’ll be hoping for better luck this time around, although his record in management thus far (as Crystal Palace fans will testify) is less than stellar.\n\nThe team: The Oranje are back, qualifying for their first major tournament since 2014. And, as usual, they boast some fabulous youthful talent in their squad (that Ajax academy has much to recommend it). Frenkie de Jong and Matthijs de Ligt are astonishingly mature and don’t look remotely out of place next to the experienced heads of Memphis Depay, Daley Blind and Georginio Wijnaldum. But one towering name is conspicuous by its absence. Virgil van Dijk is a huge loss, the captain and anchor of the team, as he is with Liverpool. Among some encouraging results in the recent past was a dramatic 4-2 win over Germany. Less stellar was being outplayed by a Covid-weakened Scotland in a 2-2 draw in early June.\n\nKey man: Frenkie de Jong. Two years ago, de Jong was signed by Barcelona for an initial €75m. It took him a while to settle in, but now he is a key member of the team, as witnessed by his stunning man of the match display in the 4-0 win over Athletic Bilbao in last season’s Copa Del Rey. Comfortable on the ball, with an eye (and foot) for a superb pass, he is versatile, able to play at centre back or out wide, though his best position is centre midfield, in the thick of it all. One minor criticism is that he could add a few more goals to his game. He has only ever scored once for the national team.\n\nOne to watch: Matthijs de Ligt. Like de Jong, the young defender found his first season away from the warm embrace of Ajax somewhat trying. His early performances for Juventus indicated a youngster somewhat overwhelmed by the weight of expectation. But recent indications suggest that the 21-year-old is returning to his best form, which is just as well, because he carried a huge responsibility in the absence of his centre back partner van Dijk.\n\nUkraine\n\nWorld ranking: 24\n\nBest Euros finish: Group stage (2016)\n\nManager: Andriy Shevchenko. The former Ballon d’Or winner (in 2004) is something of a legend in his home nation, notching 48 goals in his 111 appearances for the national team. However, his exalted status did not propel him to success in a putative political career, so he returned to football and has managed the national team for the last five years.\n\nThe team: Of all the teams in the tournament, it’s particularly tricky to work out whether Ukraine are any good or not. On paper, they don’t seem to have that much going for them. Their starting striker plays for Gent. They are using Manchester City’s second-choice left-back in centre midfield. One of their star players can’t get a game for West Ham. And yet… they won their qualifying group ahead of European Champions Portugal and demolished Serbia 5-0. Back home, there is real optimism that this side can go further than the group stages for the first time in their history. But they will need goals from all over the pitch, in the absence of a stellar name up front. Oh, for their manager in his pomp.\n\nKey man: Andriy Yarmolenko. West Ham fans will attest that Yarmolenko is a frustrating player, with form and fitness regular problems. But when he is on song, he is a complete joy to watch. Like Arjen Robben, his trademark is cutting in from the wing and unleashing a long distance shot and it has helped earn him 38 goals in 92 caps for the national team.\n\nOne to watch: Ruslan Malinovskyi was a key man in Atalanta’s brilliant Serie A campaign and scored the only goal in their 1-0 win over Juventus in April, their first win against their opponents in 20 years. He scored eight goals from midfield and topped the Serie A stats with eleven assists, on his way to being named the league’s player of the month for May. It appears the talented midfielder is coming into form at just the right time.\n\nAustria\n\nWorld ranking: 23\n\nBest Euros finish: Group stage (2008, 2016)\n\nManager: Franco Foda. The former Sturm Graz manager made two appearances for West Germany while a defender for Bayer Leverkusen. He recalls being surprised at the enthusiastic reception he received when he came on as a substitute against Brazil in Brasilia. It turns out his name means “fucking for free” in Portuguese. Which is nice. He’s managed Austria since 2018.\n\nThe team: Let’s face it, Austria aren’t going to win Euro 2020 by playing gorgeous, free-flowing football like a cross between the 1950s Hungary, 1970s Netherlands and 1980s Brazil. In fact, they’re not going to win Euro 2020 at all. But, as the bruised shins of England will testify, they will not make life easy for their opponents, employing a rugged, muscular approach designed to intimidate and unsettle. They finished second in the easiest qualifying group, six points behind Poland and even contrived to lose to Latvia. But this side is nothing if not experienced and the wizened old pros Aleksandar Dragovic, Julian Baumgartlinger, Marko Arnautovic and the great David Alaba will bring their expertise to the fore.\n\nKey man: David Alaba. It seems unthinkable that Alaba is still only 28. He seems to have played for the Bayern first team for at least 20 years, though it is unlikely he was actually turning out for them aged eight. Indeed, he has played his last game for them, bidding them a tearful farewell at the season’s close to move to Real Madrid. Able to play anywhere from centre back to left wing, Alaba made his debut for Austria aged just 17 in 2009, since when he has amassed 79 caps and scored 14 goals. A world class performer, he is the national team's talisman.\n\nOne to watch: Marko Arnautovic. Yes, I know, he’s 32 and I should probably choose Hoffenheim’s 21-year-old midfielder Christoph Baumgartner. But Arnautovic is always worth watching, because not only is he a half-decent forward (with 26 goals for his country) but he is also hugely entertaining, capable of exquisite skill or the type of tackling that is more agricultural than a bale of hay.\n\nNorth Macedonia\n\nWorld ranking: 62\n\nBest Euros finish: This one\n\nManager: Igor Angelovski. The 44-year-old had a low key career as a player in Slovenia and Macedonia. As a manager, he guided Rabotnicki (me neither) to the double and has managed the national team since 2015. No, you can’t find anything else to say about him.\n\nThe team: There have probably been bigger international shocks than North Macedonia’s 2-1 win away to Germany in a World Cup qualifier in March, but none currently spring to mind. The joke at the time was: “Imagine what the result would have been if they had to play the whole of Macedonia?” But, in truth, North Macedonia is just Macedonia renamed, like Opal Fruits becoming Starburst, only with bigger geopolitical implications. It remains to be seen whether the Germany result was a complete aberration or the start of something extraordinary, but with players such as Eljif Elmas, Leeds’ Ezgjan Alioski, and Mallorca’s Aleksandar Trajkovski under the captaincy of legend Goran Pandev, this isn’t a bunch of bank clerks and postal workers. This could be fun.\n\nKey man: Goran Pandev. It’s possible that by the end of the tournament Goran Pandev will officially be the world’s oldest man, but he’s still absolutely vital to his team. The striker has played in Italy for 20 years, the last six of which have been at Genoa. This month also sees the 20th anniversary of his first cap, since when he has amassed 117 more and scored 37 goals – one of which was the only goal in the Nations’ League playoff win over Georgia that saw his side qualify for their first ever major tournament.\n\nOne to watch: Eljif Elmas. For many years, Pandev has carried the national team squarely on his shoulders. Now it is a job he can share with the 21-year-old midfielder Elmas, a regular starter for Napoli who has already clocked up 27 international caps. With superb vision and reading of the game, Elmas can play at centre midfield, on the left or behind the striker. He scored four times in qualifying and also nabbed the winner in the historic defeat of Germany.\n\nGROUP D\n\nEngland\n\nWorld ranking: 4\n\nBest Euros finish: Third (1968)\n\nManager: Gareth Southgate. Versatile defender, terrible penalty taker, sometime pizza salesman, waistcoat-wearer and all-round good egg. Southgate has many coats to wear, but a nation will be hoping that “managerial legend” is added to the list over the next month. A calm head, he has coped with the fraught job of managing England – with its attendant scrutiny and criticism – with aplomb, but the almost universal approval will start to suffer if England underperform this time around.\n\nThe team: It’s never easy, is it? England come to the tournament blessed with one of the strongest squads in their history, with an abundance of thrilling young talent, home advantage and a million excellent right-backs. But pre-tournament optimism has been drained by lacklustre games against Romania and Austria, the squad is exhausted after a weird and hectic season, Jordan Henderson has barely kicked a ball since dinosaurs walked the earth and now a collection of boneheaded numbskulls have started booing the team for expressing their objections to racism. So what does it all mean? England could very easily go out in the group stages or win the whole damn thing. This is my fence and I choose to get splinters up my bum.\n\nKey man: Harry Kane. England’s captain has shown himself to be one of the best strikers in world football and in qualifying he notched up a remarkable 12 goals and five assists in only eight games, placing him top of the scoring charts on the continent. Kane is utterly ruthless in front of goal, but is also a magnificent team player, with the willingness and vision to use a teammate if it is the better option. One can only hope that the transfer speculation swirling around him inspires rather than distracts him.\n\nOne to watch: Phil Foden. One of Southgate’s more pressing issues is working out who to include and who to leave out among his brilliant young attacking talents, including Mason Mount, Jack Grealish, Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford. But, after a ridiculous season, surely Foden has earned his place in the side. After years of hype, he has roared on to the world stage at Manchester City and is without doubt one of the premier young talents in international football.\n\nCroatia\n\nWorld ranking: 14\n\nBest Euros finish: Quarterfinals (1996, 2008)\n\nManager: Zlatko Dalic. A solid but unspectacular defensive midfielder in the Croatian league, Dalic has been manager of Croatia for four years, during which time he has led the Balkan nation to a World Cup final, no less. Cheers for that.\n\nThe team: England can attest that this Croatian side should never be underestimated. But now let’s underestimate them. The great Ivan Rakitić has retired, while Luka Modric, Domagoj Vida, Dejan Lovren, Ivan Perisic, Milan Badelj and Andrej Kramaric are all the wrong side of 30. (OK, Kramarić turns 30 on 19 June…) They topped their qualifying group ahead of Wales, but without ever truly convincing, as a defeat to Hungary and a draw with Azerbaijan testify.\n\nKey man: Luka Modric. The 2018 Ballon d’Or winner has 136 caps, the most in Croatian history, and 17 goals. He has spent the best part of 15 years pulling the strings in his country’s midfield, a tireless, diminutive presence who can often run games single-handed and almost without ever really being noticed. But time's winged chariot may finally be catching up with him, as a lacklustre showing against Chelsea in the Champions League semifinals recently demonstrated.\n\nOne to watch: Josip Brekalo. The small, slight winger signed for Wolfsburg five years ago, aged just 17, for €10m. He can play on either flank, at right-back or as a false nine and last month scored his first senior hat-trick in a 3-0 win over Union Berlin.\n\nScotland\n\nWorld ranking: 44\n\nBest Euros finish: Group stage (1992/1996)\n\nManager: Steve Clarke. The former Chelsea stalwart may have only won six caps as a player, but he’ll go down in Scottish folklore for his management skills, following a remarkable and emotional victory on penalties over Serbia that almost put my Glaswegian father-in-law in hospital.\n\nThe team: Scotland are, let’s face it, rubbish. A bunch of minnows who play in a Mickey Mouse league, who will be happy just to make up the numbers here and avoid an absolute thumping. They’ve only got two good players and they’re both left-backs. And if you believe that, you’ve not been paying attention. This Scotland side is determined to go far in the tournament and with players including Andrew Robertson, Kieran Tierney, Scott McTominay, John McGinn, Billy Gilmour and Ryan Christie, they have the skill to do it. But, more than that, this is a team with more spirit than a Famous Grouse distillery. And – be warned – they always, always raise their game against England.\n\nKey man: John McGinn. Robertson, McTominay and Tierney may be at bigger clubs, but McGinn is the all-action midfielder with an eye for goal who has the capacity to win matches. His performances were a major factor in Aston Villa’s successful season and he scored seven goals in qualifiers. With goals not necessarily the forte of Scotland’s attack, his role will be crucial.\n\nOne to watch: Billy Gilmour. The 19-year-old midfielder has played eleven times for his club and has clocked up 39 minutes of international football. And yet the hype around him continues to swirl, because reports from Chelsea indicate that he is something very, very special indeed. In a Scotland team long on perspiration but possibly lacking the odd spark of inspiration, his inclusion should be seen not as a risk, but a necessity.\n\nCzech Republic\n\nWorld ranking: 40\n\nBest Euros finish: Winners (1976, as Czechoslovakia)\n\nManager: Jaroslav Silhavy. The defender spent his entire career in the Czech league, making a record 465 appearances and also winning four caps for his country. His managerial career has also been exclusively Czech in nature, most recently with Slavia Prague. Silhavy has managed the national team since 2018.\n\nThe team: The Czech team of Pavel Nedved, Patrik Berger, Karel Poborsky, Vladimir Smicer and Tomas Rosicky may never be equalled, but this vintage features some delightful players. Not least among them is Leverkusen’s forward Patrik Schick, the team’s focal point up front. At West Ham, Tomas Soucek has been a revelation, while Vladimir Coufal has been one of the league’s best right-backs. Throw in skipper Vladimir Darida of Hertha Berlin, Sampdoria’s Jakub Jankto and Burnley’s Matej Vydra and you have a team that could pose problems for anyone – as England discovered in a rare defeat in October 2019.\n\nKey man: Patrik Schick. The 6’2” striker was a whisker away from joining Juventus in 2017, but failed two medicals for the club. On such moments are careers made and broken, but the 25-year-old has forged a decent reputation since then in Germany, where he has a reputation for unselfish hold-up play and a surprisingly deft touch for a big, physical player. He scored four goals in qualifying.\n\nOne to watch: Tomas Soucek. When West Ham signed Soucek as a defensive midfielder, it’s fair to say they probably weren’t expecting him to finish as the club’s joint top-scorer with ten goals. But his late runs into the box appear to bear fruit for his country as well, as a recent hat-trick in March in a World Cup qualifier against Estonia eloquently demonstrated. Soucek was named the Czech Player Of The Year in 2020.\n\nGROUP E\n\nSpain\n\nWorld ranking: 6\n\nBest Euros finish: Winners (1964, 2008, 2012)\n\nManager: Luis Enrique. The man who coached Barcelona to Champions League glory in 2015 enjoyed a stellar playing career at both Real Madrid and Barcelona and won 62 caps for his country. He took over as manager of Spain in 2018, only to step down in June 2019 for tragic family reasons. He returned to the role on November 2019 and only the hardest of heart would begrudge him success.\n\nThe team: The idea of a Spain tournament squad without any Real Madrid players is simply remarkable, but when Enrique left out Sergio Ramos, Nacho, Marco Asensio and Dani Carvajal, the unthinkable became a reality. Spain still have some remarkable talents – Sergio Busquets, Jordi Alba, Thiago Alcantara, Koke and Alvaro Morata spring to mind – but this is far from the dominant force that used to have matches won before they even set foot on the pitch. Covid disruptions have further hampered Spain’s preparations and if Busquets doesn’t make a recovery the whole team will suffer.\n\nKey man: Sergio Busquets. A positive Covid test for Busquets has left Enrique frantically hoping his skipper will be fit and ready in time to play a significant role in the tournament. He is crucial to the team. The chances are, you can’t really remember a huge amount of things Busquets has done in his career; he’s not that sort of player. But with his ability to break up play and then give the ball to more expansive teammates, he is an exceptional and crucial talent. His magnificent reading of the game has seen him win 123 caps and he is the rock upon which past glories have been built. In that time, the midfielder has scored a grand total of two goals, which says it all.\n\nOne to watch: Ferran Torres. It is a surprise to see such a youngster in Spain’s squad – Torres is only five. Although, in fairness, that is largely because he was born on 29 February. The Manchester City star can play anywhere across the front line, is quick, skilful and two-footed. He scored a hat-trick against Newcastle last month, so has form on his side.\n\nSweden\n\nWorld ranking: 18\n\nBest Euros finish: Semifinals (1992)\n\nManager: Janne Andersson. Named by FourFourTwo as the 17th best manager in the world in 2018 and declared Coach Of The Year at 2019’s Swedish Sports Awards (think SPOTY, but with more blondes and fewer weird musical interludes), Andersson has managed the Swedes since 2016 and done a thoroughly decent job of it, including leading them to the quarterfinals of the 2018 World Cup.\n\nThe team: If a team is defined by a player’s absence, it’s probably not a good sign. Modest, retiring wallflower Zlatan Ibrahimovic might be a tedious self-publicist, but he could still play a mean 90 minutes, even at the age of 39. With injury ruling him out, the team is still long on experience and organisation (six of the possible starting line-up are over 30) but short on inspiration.\n\nKey man: Emil Forsberg. RB Leipzig’s attacking midfielder can play on either wing or through the middle and has scored nine goals in 58 appearances for Sweden. He scored the only goal against Switzerland to take Sweden to the quarterfinals of the last World Cup and scored seven goals in an impressive campaign from midfield for Leipzig last season.\n\nOne to watch: Alexander Isak. The Real Sociedad forward enjoyed a spectacular season, with 17 goals in La Liga and a Copa Del Rey cup winner’s medal in April. He became the first Swedish player to score a La Liga hat-trick since 1949. Aged 21, he scored his first professional goal aged 16 and became the youngest ever scorer for Sweden when he netter aged 17.\n\nPoland\n\nWorld ranking: 21\n\nBest Euros finish: Quarterfinals (2016)\n\nManager: Paulo Sousa. The former Inter and Juventus midfielder was one of Portugal’s celebrated “Golden Generation” – the best team the nation had ever produced (at least until the current iteration). A chequered managerial career has seen him go through nine jobs in 12 years and he landed up at Poland in January of this year, succeeding Jerzy Brzeczek, who had overseen a successful qualifying campaign.\n\nThe team: Poland qualified comfortably, winning eight of ten matches, although their qualifying group might as well have been populated by clowns on bicycles, such was the kindness of the draw. Nevertheless, the team is more than just Robert Lewandowski, with players such as Kamil Glik (Benevento), Jan Bednarek (Southampton), Piotr Zielinski (Napoli) Mateusz Klich (Leeds) and Arkadiusz Milik (Marseille) all enjoying fine careers at top teams. That said, the form and fitness of Lewandowski will be vital if Poland are to go far in the tournament.\n\nKey man: Duuuuh. Take a guess... The Bayern striker has just enjoyed the most extraordinary season of a glittering career, netting a ludicrous 41 goals in 29 league games and breaking Gerd Muller’s 40-year-old record in the process. Lewandowski has scored 66 goals in his 118 appearances for the national team and could justifiably lay claim to being the best player in the world just now.\n\nOne to watch: Piotr Zielinski. The Napoli midfielder scored eight league goals in 36 Serie A appearances last season. With a superb range of short and long passing, Zielinski has been compared to Kevin De Bruyne and has been on Liverpool’s radar for some time.\n\nSlovakia\n\nWorld ranking: 36\n\nBest Euros finish: Last 16 (2016)\n\nManager: Stefan Tarkovic led his team to victory over the Republic Of Ireland and Northern Ireland in the playoffs to qualify for the tournament. He’s only ever coached in Slovakia, so isn’t exactly a world-renowned figure. Um… he has brown hair. I think.\n\nThe team: Slovakia are a country of rich footballing heritage, even if it may not be well-recognised. Although history dictates that, since Czechoslovakia split into two countries, the 1976 Euro win belongs to the Czech Republic, eight of the eleven starting line-up that defeated West Germany in the final were Slovak. Today, the country is unlikely to repeat the feat, not least because the midfield seems to consist entirely of people who should be sucking on boiled sweets and playing bingo. Which is to say, this is the oldest team at Euro 2020. But with talents like Juraj Kucka and Peter Pekarik supporting the great Marek Hamsik, they will pose a threat in one-off matches.\n\nKey man: Marek Hamsik. The attacking midfielder with a penchant for outlandish hairstyles has 126 caps and 26 goals for his country and made more than 400 appearances for Napoli, scoring 100 times in his 12 years at the club. At 33, he’s getting on a bit, but still oozes class on the ball.\n\nOne to watch: Tomas Suslov. The FC Groningen forward made his debut for the national team last November, aged just 18. After a successful season in Holland, he is being looked at by both Ajax and Wolves. As a youthful option coming off the bench, he may be crucial in supporting the ageing legs of those around him.\n\nGROUP F\n\nHungary\n\nWorld ranking: 37\n\nBest Euros finish: Third place (1964)\n\nManager: Marco Rossi. The Italian, a former defender for Brescia and Sampdoria, managed in Hungary’s domestic league, which, as you are all aware, is called the Nemzeti Bajnokság. After some success with Hungarian legends Honved, he was appointed manager of the national team in June 2018.\n\nThe team: It’s almost 70 years since Hungary dominated world football, but the “Marvellous Magyars” of Ferenc Puskas and Sandor Kocsis is still seen by some as the best international team in history. The current iteration falls somewhat short of that and contrived to finish fourth of five in a weak qualifying group, before securing their place at Euro 2020 thanks to wins over Bulgaria and (not unimpressively) Iceland. The reward for their endeavours is a group that will give them not a cats chance in hell of qualifying from.\n\nKey man: Adam Szalai. The Hungary captain is in his second stint as a striker for Mainz and has 23 goals and 70 caps for his country. In 2015/16 he finished a year-long dry spell by finally scoring after 40 goalless appearances. His teammates will be looking for more from him in this tournament.\n\nOne to watch: Roland Sallai. The 24-year-old Freiburg winger had already played in Hungary, Italy and Cyprus before making his Bundesliga debut in 2018. This season he played – and scored, more than ever before, with 28 appearances and eight goals. His service could be crucial to Szalai.\n\nPortugal\n\nWorld ranking: 5\n\nBest Euros finish: Winners (2016)\n\nManager: Fernando Santos. Once you have coached all three of Portugal’s footballing giants (Porto, Benfica and Sporting) there’s a logical next step and Santos became the national team coach in 2014. Two years later, he guided his charges to the European Championship, a feat made all the more unlikely by Cristiano Ronaldo’s injury in the final. He also led them to Nation’s League (ahem) “glory” in 2019.\n\nThe team: It’s fair to say that the reigning champions are a considerably stronger outfit than they were four years ago. Yes, Rui Patricio, Pepe, Jose Fonte, Joao Moutinho and a certain Cristiano Ronaldo are all five years older, but some magnificent players have been added to the mix. Among them are Manchester City’s Ruben Dias, Joao Cancelo and Bernardo Silva, as well as Bruno Fernandes, Joao Felix and Diogo Jota. Whichever way you look at it, this is an outstanding team, with a genuine chance of defending their title.\n\nKey man: Who do you think? The man is ridiculous. He has 174 caps and has scored an almost surreal 103 international goals. In a 19-year career, the 36-year-old has reinvented himself as a winger, attacking midfielder and, latterly, a target man and top scored by a mile in Serie A last season. He also scored eleven goals in qualifying. He will be beyond desperate to feature in – and complete – the final this time.\n\nOne to watch: Joao Felix. Carrying a €126m price tag is probably not easy and when Felix moved to Atletico Madrid aged 19, the weight was something of a burden. However, playing largely on the right wing, he has enjoyed a successful second season, in which he scored some key goals and helped his side to a thrilling La Liga title. He has been compared to Brazilian great Kaka, thanks to his quickness of both mind and feet, and if he’s on form should forge an excellent partnership with you-know-who.\n\nFrance\n\nWorld ranking: 2\n\nBest Euros finish: Winners (1984, 2000)\n\nManager: Didier Deschamps. As a player, the midfielder led his country to the World Cup and the European Championship. As manager, he’s already led his team to the World Cup. It’s not an unreasonable suggestion that he could do the double double. Leave a crumb for someone else, would you, Didier? There’s a good chap.\n\nThe team: Look for a weak spot. Just look for one. It’s not really there. Their defence comes from Real Madrid, Barca and Bayern Munich. Their midfield boasts Paul Pogba and the frankly absurd N’Golo Kante at its heart. Up front lurk the phenomenal trio of Kylian Mbappe, Antoine Griezmann and Karim Benzema. The team that won the World Cup in 2018 looked formidable (which also works in French – ha!) but is, if anything, even stronger now, with Mbappe maturing and Benzema back in the fold. Yikes!\n\nKey man: Kylian Mbappe. The 22-year-old already has 42 caps, 16 international goals and a World Cup winner’s medal, and has been top scorer in Ligue 1 for the past three seasons. By the time I was 22 I’d just learned that I could eat two large doners in one sitting. Makes you think… In 2018 Mbappe became only the second ever teenager to score in a World Cup final. The other was a chap called Pele.\n\nOne to watch: Karim Benzema. He’s not exactly a new kid on the block, but it’ll be intriguing to see how Benzema integrates with his teammates, having been exiled from the squad for six years following the alleged blackmail of Mathieu Valbuena involving a sex tape. Without the ban, Benzema would have added plenty more to his 82 caps and after an excellent season for an otherwise disappointing Real Madrid side, he will be eager to make up for lost time.\n\nGermany\n\nWorld ranking: 12\n\nBest Euros finish: Winners (1972, 1980, as West Germany, and 1996)\n\nManager: Joachim Low. Low has ridden the merry-go-round of international management more efficiently than most, straying in his job a staggering 15 years. With the 2014 World Cup win under his belt, he has earned the right to choose the moment of his own departure, which he announced in March. This tournament will be his last and he will want to go out on a high.\n\nThe team: Let’s be honest about this. You don’t normally begin the group stage of a tournament expecting the Germans to go out, but such is the horrendous draw they have been given that it could very easily come to pass. Both Portugal and France are faster, more dynamic and creative teams. That said, Germany are tournament experts (this is their 26th consecutive major tournament). Manuel Neuer will win his 100th cap against France and the recall of Thomas Muller will lift the responsibility of goals from the shoulders of Serge Gnabry, who managed eight in qualifying. Chelsea’s triumphant Champions League trio of Antonio Rudiger, Kai Havertz and Timo Werner will look to kick on. But this is far from a cake walk for Germany.\n\nKey man: Ilkay Gundogan. The midfielder has just enjoyed the best season of his career, with 17 goals for Manchester City. He was the Premier League’s Player Of The Month for both January and February and named in the league’s Team Of The Season. He will need to continue that spectacular form if Germany are to avoid ignominy.\n\nOne to watch: Jamal Musiala. In years to come, England may yet reflect that amid their wealth of young attacking talent, they missed out on the best of the lot. Musiala played representative football for England as recently as last year, when he played for the Under 21s, before opting to play for the German national team. In his first season at Bayern, he has appeared 27 times and scored six goals, the first of which made him Bayern’s youngest ever goalscorer. Frightening.\n\nNow read\n\nEvery Uefa European Championship-winning team, ranked\n\nGareth Southgate: ‘The format of Euro 2020 has to be open to change’\n\nEuro 2020 odds: the best betting tips for champion, top goalscorer and more"
