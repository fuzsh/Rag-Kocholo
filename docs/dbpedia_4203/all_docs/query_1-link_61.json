        "text": "The more I see of Leicester defender Caglar Soyuncu, the more I like him.\n\nHe is only 23 but the Turkey international looks like a defender who is made for the demands of the modern game - agile, aggressive and good in the air, but also brave on the ball too.\n\nSoyuncu is not the tallest defender at 6ft 1in but he has got a very good spring. On the ground, he gets in the faces of attackers and he also never panics when he is in possession.\n\nWhatever situation he is in, he never really looks troubled to me.\n\nWe saw very little of him at Leicester last season when he was fourth choice behind Harry Maguire, Jonny Evans and Wes Morgan after joining from Freiburg, but Foxes boss Brendan Rodgers obviously spotted something he liked in training.\n\nIt was refreshing to see Leicester go with a young, relatively untried player rather than spend big on a replacement for Maguire when he left to join United for Â£80m in the summer.\n\nGiving Soyuncu his chance looks like a very good decision now, with Leicester flying high in the table and boasting the joint-best defensive record in the Premier League.\n\nI am a fan of their entire back four, but Soyuncu and the experienced Evans have formed a brilliant partnership at the centre of their defence, as good as anything you will see in the Premier League at the moment.\n\nBoth of them were magnificent in Sunday's 2-0 win over Crystal Palace, and it was not just their defending that impressed me at Selhurst Park.\n\nThey were dominant in both boxes - Soyuncu scored their opening goal but Evans also went close to scoring a couple of times as well.\n\nIt was incredible for Leicester to beat Southampton 9-0 in their previous league game but their gritty performance against Palace was probably just as satisfying for Rogers.\n\nEveryone has - rightly - been talking about the Foxes as a real attacking force but the defensive responsibility throughout their team is also first class.\n\nSunday's display in a tough and very tight game against a team who were never going to just collapse was a great demonstration of why they are third in the table, and why they are well equipped to stay there.\n\nPalace dropped deep and made it difficult for Leicester to play their usual free-flowing style, but the Foxes always had a solid base at the back.\n\nPart of the reason for that was their full-backs, Ben Chilwell and Ricardo Pereira, did not look to get forward very much early on, but they also had the security of Wilfred Ndidi sitting in front of their back four.\n\nI liked the way Ndidi popped in and out between his two centre-backs when needed, and also went out wide to deal with any issues when his full-backs needed help. He covered a lot of ground.\n\nWith Ndidi in the team, his central defenders know they only have to worry about balls in behind them because if a team tries to play to feet in front of them, Ndidi will almost always be there.\n\nWhen he's not, Soyuncu is very mobile so he will come out to deal with any danger more than Evans does. It is a combination that works.\n\nTogether they helped to restrict Palace's threat and also acted as a launch-pad for Leicester's attacks and the kind of attractive football they are now becoming synonymous with.\n\nLeicester are flying too, only two points behind City, and it is significant that they are six points above Arsenal, who they play at the King Power Stadium next Saturday.\n\nI make the Foxes massive favourites going into that game - in terms of form, and the way both teams are playing at the moment, they should be very confident of winning it.\n\nIt is not a situation I would have expected at the start of the season but this is the perfect game for Leicester - and a chance for them to put even more distance between them and one of their so-called rivals for the top four.\n\nMartin Keown was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan."
