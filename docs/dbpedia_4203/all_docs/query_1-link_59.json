        "text": "Italy, the reigning European champions, will continue their Euro 2024 preparations with a friendly match against Turkey in Bologna on Tuesday evening. Italy have won three of their last four games, with their only draw coming against Ukraine, which secured their qualification.\n\nTurkey, on the other hand, had a strong qualifying run but suffered a heavy 6-1 loss to Austria recently.\n\nItaly are set to defend their title in Germany, aiming to repeat their unexpected 2021 triumph. They overcame the sudden departure of coach Roberto Mancini last year, with new coach Luciano Spalletti guiding them to second place in Group C, avoiding a playoff.\n\nItaly played two friendlies in the United States in the spring, defeating Venezuela and Ecuador. They have now gathered at Coverciano to face Turkey at Stadio Dall'Ara, followed by a match against Bosnia-Herzegovina in Empoli. They will then kick off their Euros campaign against Albania.\n\nTurkey, like Italy, will make their Euro 2024 debut in Dortmund. Coach Vincenzo Montella's team, who topped Group D in qualifying, need a morale boost after recent defeats to Hungary and Austria. After facing Italy, Turkey will play a final warm-up match against Poland in Warsaw.\n\nThe Sporting News looks at the key details ahead of this game, including how to watch it across the world, kickoff times, and the latest lineup news.\n\nWhat time does Italy vs. Turkey kick off?\n\nThis international friendly match takes place at the Stadio Renato Dall'Ara in Bologna, Italy and kicks off on Tuesday, June 4 at 9:00 p.m. local time.\n\nHere's how that time translates across some of the major territories:\n\nDateKickoff timeUSATue, Jun. 43:00 p.m. ETCanadaTue, Jun. 43:00 p.m. ETUKTue, Jun. 48:00 p.m. BSTAustraliaWed, Jun. 55:00 a.m. AESTIndiaWed, Jun. 512:30 a.m. IST\n\nItaly vs. Turkey live stream, TV channel\n\nHere's how to watch this international friendly match across selected areas of the world's major regions:\n\nRegionTVStreamingUSA—ViXCanada—\n\nDAZN\n\nUKPremier Sports 2Premier Sports PlayerAustralia—Optus SportIndiaSONY TEN 1 HDJioTV, Sony LIV\n\nUSA: This game is only available to stream via Spanish language streaming service ViX.\n\nCanada: This international friendly game streams live on DAZN.\n\nUK: Premier Sports 2 has live broadcast access for viewers in the UK with streaming on the Premier Sports Player.\n\nAustralia: Fans in Australia can stream this match live and on-demand on Optus Sport.\n\nIndia: Italy vs. Turkey is available to watch on SONY TEN 1 HD, with streaming on the JioTV App, and Sony LIV.\n\nIf Italy vs. Turkey is not available to watch live in your location or if you’re traveling abroad, you can use a Virtual Private Network (VPN).

Francesco Acerbi is out due to groin surgery. Nicolo Zaniolo, Domenico Berardi, Destiny Udogie, and suspended midfielder Sandro Tonali are also unavailable.\n\nGianluca Scamacca, recalled to the team, won't play against Turkey. He and Atalanta BC teammate Giorgio Scalvini are involved in their final league game of the season.\n\nNicolo Fagioli, recently back from suspension, is surprisingly included, while Manuel Locatelli is left out. Gianluigi Donnarumma will captain Italy as Ciro Immobile is missing due to injuries and form issues. Mateo Retegui is likely to start up front.\n\nItaly predicted XI (3-4-2-1, right to left): Donnarumma (GK) — Darmian, Buongiorno, Bastoni — Cambiaso, Barella, Jorginho, Dimarco — Pellegrini, Raspadori — Retegui.\n\nItaly subs (9): TBC\n\nFor Turkey, defenders Caglar Soyuncu and Ridvan Yilmaz, and forward Cengiz Under are out with injuries.\n\nHowever, Zeki Celik, Kenan Yildiz, and captain Hakan Calhanoglu are available. Calhanoglu, recently named Serie A midfielder of the year, is key for Turkey. Coach Vincenzo Montella will likely start Ugurcan Cakir as the goalkeeper, given Altay Bayindir’s lack of playing time at Manchester United.\n\nTurkey predicted XI (4-2-3-1 right to left): Cakir (GK) — Celik, Demiral, Ayhan, Ozkacar — Calhanoglu, Ozcan — Akgun, Guler, Yildiz — Unal\n\nTurkey subs (9): TBC\n\nItaly vs. Turkey prediction\n\nBoth coaches will test their players and tactics before the major tournament. Both teams have some defensive concerns. However, Italy is the favorite to win the match. They also have a good record against Turkey.\n\nBoth nations qualified for Euro 2024 automatically. Neither team has been very convincing recently, especially in defense."
