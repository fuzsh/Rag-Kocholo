        "text": "It is clear that FC Barcelona must start making important decisions regarding player sales. Why? If it eventually aligns its situation with LaLiga's financial fair play and falls under the 1/1 rule, it will still need to let go of some players to have the necessary financial muscle to face the 'top' signings it wants to make. These, of course, entail a significant financial outlay and require finding ways to make their registrations.\n\nAt this point, one of the unexpected names that has been considered as a possible protagonist of this sales operation is İlkay Gündoğan. The 33-year-old German midfielder has been deemed by the Culé sports management as a very attractive asset for a potential sale, provided the right offer comes in. While no one questions the undeniable quality of the Blaugrana's '22', it is also true that if there is an opportunity to profit from the market with him, it is now, as 'Gündo' is under contract with the club until 2025, although the institution has the option to extend the link with the midfielder for another year.\n\nIn this context, Gündoğan has aroused interest from more than one team that has shown willingness to learn about his current situation at the club. Two of the most renowned clubs are two giants of Turkish football: Galatasaray and Fenerbahçe. The president of 'Galata', Dursun Özbek, has expressed his desire to have the German to strengthen the midfield of his team, while it has recently been reported through the 'Spor Arena' newspaper that José Mourinho, coach of 'The Yellow Canaries', would have requested the incorporation of the former Manchester City player to bolster a project that has already signed several good players like Youssef En-Nesyri, Çağlar Söyüncü, and Allan Saint-Maximin (on loan).\n\nGündogan is clear about his desire to stay at FC Barcelona this season\n\nHowever, it seems that all these clubs will have to forget about their hopes of adding the German this summer. According to 'Mundo Deportivo', Gündoğan has no intention of leaving the Culé squad this season. The midfielder's entourage has informed Barcelona's sports management of his decision not to entertain offers, as he is happy in the city and has great ambitions with the Blaugrana club."
