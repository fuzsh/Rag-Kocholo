        "text": "GOOD LUCK MERT FURKAN BAYRAM Our first team goalkeeper Mert Furkan Bayram, who came through our Youth Development System , has been transferred to Alanyaspor, in Super League. Our goalkeeper, who was discovered at Altınordu Bornova Football Schools, was born on January 2, 2005, in Izmir. After playing in various age categories in our academy, he joined our first team squad in 2022-23 season. The 19-year-old national goalkeeper has played 25 matches till now for our U15, U17, U18, and U19 national teams and is currently guarding our goal in the ongoing U19 European Championship matches in Northern Ireland. A SUCCESSFUL SEASON Standing at 1.88 meters tall, our goalkeeper made his debut in the TFF 2nd League last season, impressing with his performance in 16 matches. In his first season in the 2nd League, our young goalkeeper managed to keep a clean sheet in 6 matches, catching the attention of the football community as a promising talent. REPRESENTING BOTH OUR NATIONAL TEAM AND ALTINORDU Two seasons ago, Mert Furkan Bayram, who visited our young goalkeepers receiving training at Sait Altınordu Facilities, said, \"I was 8-9 years old when I first came to these facilities and started my first training session. I trained at Sait Altınordu Facilities. Good goalkeepers are coming up behind us. I have been going to the national team with Arif Şimşir since I was 14. We are representing both our national team and Altınordu.\" FAREWELL MESSAGE FROM MERT FURKAN BAYRAM ‘Today it's time to leave Altınordu Club, where I entered at the age of 8 and spent 11 years... I would like to thank everyone who has supported me. I hope everything will be good for this club. Now it's time to move on to new adventures.’ The young goalkeeper, who is currently guarding our goal for the U19 national team at the ongoing U19 European Championship in Northern Ireland, sent a farewell message to our club from the camp. THANK YOU, MERT FURKAN BAYRAM Discovered at the bottom tier of our club's player development pyramid at Altınordu Football Schools, received his football education at the academy, and later wore our first team jersey, we fully believe that Mert Furkan Bayram will continue to play for bigger teams in Europe's top 5 leagues in line with our club's goals in the future. We know that you will proudly represent Altınordu at all the teams you join and continue to be a roll model for our young footballers. As Altınordu Football Club, we wish you endless success in your future football career. Good luck, Mert Furkan Bayram…"
