        "text": "Leicester City are not expecting to have Caglar Soyuncu available for the huge Premier League clash with Champions League rivals West Ham next weekend after he tested positive for Covid-19.\n\nThe centre-back remains in Turkey in a bubble at the country’s football federation headquarters near Istanbul after contracting coronavirus just before he prepared to leave and return to the UK.\n\nSoyuncu played all three of his country’s matches over the international break, but then a Covid-19 outbreak hit the camp.\n\nHe could not return, so Daniel Amartey stepped in for the 2-0 defeat to Manchester City, and he may be required again against West Ham at the London Stadium.\n\nCity are seven points ahead of the fifth-placed Hammers but that could fall to four before they meet if David Moyes’ side beat Wolves on Monday.\n\n“There was a number of players in Turkey that had a positive test and he was one of those,” said Brendan Rodgers, explaining the situation.\n\n“He’s still out there in Turkey in a bubble so we’re working on the best process to get him back and available.\n\n“He’s fine. He had a number of negative tests and just before he came back he had a positive test. It’s a process with the federation, looking at the best options, and hopefully we’ll get him back and playing as soon as we can.\n\n\"I very much doubt so (he will be available for West Ham), with the requirements of isolation and everything else. That's what we're working out. We need to confirm where we're at but I would think he is highly unlikely to play in that game.\"\n\nCity will certainly hope to have the centre-back available in a fortnight's time, when they play a historic FA Cup semi-final against Southampton at Wembley.\n\nFor now, with no Soyuncu, City could have four players out against West Ham, with Cengiz Under, Harvey Barnes, and James Justin currently recovering from injuries."
