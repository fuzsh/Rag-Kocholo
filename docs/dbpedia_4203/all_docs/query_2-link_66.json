He was even assistant coach under Carlo Ancelotti at the club so has learned his trade with the very best. He was a member of the French national team squad at the 2002 World Cup, Euro 2004, the 2006 World Cup when France reached the final and Euro 2008. Has 16 wins and five draws from his 33 games in charge so far.\n\nRecord\n\nFirst time to qualify.\n\nFIFA Ranking (75th) in the world\n\nMen to watch\n\nKhvicha Kvaratskhelia - The 23-year-old winger for Napoli is the national team's best player by some distance. He has notched 23 goals in just 68 games for the Serie A club so far and 4 goals and 1 assist in qualifying. A bright future beckons.\n\nPredictions & Latest Odds\n\nAvoiding defeat in any of their 3 group matches would be considered a success on their first appearance.\n\nHow they qualified\n\nGeorgia qualified for Euro 2024 after a 4-2 shootout win over Greece after the tense playoff final ended 0-0 in Tbilisi.\n\nOn the sidelines\n\nDinamo Tbilisi, founded in 1925, is the country's most famous club side. They play at the 54,000 capacity Boris Paichadze Dinamo Arena.\n\nFormation\n\n4-3-3\n\nAnalysis\n\nIn qualifying Georgia had a goal difference of -6 and finished fourth (out of 5 teams) behind Spain, Scotland and Norway, but qualified for the play-offs via their results in the Nations League. This form does not bode well for a squad with only Kvaratskhelia playing his football at a top club.\n\nSquad\n\nGoalkeepers: Giorgi Loria (Dinamo Tbilisi), Giorgi Mamardashvili (Valencia), Luka Gugeshashvili (Qarabag).\n\nDefenders: Guram Kashia (Slovan Bratislava), Otar Kakabadze (Cracovia), Solomon Kvirkvelia (Al-Okhdood), Lasha Dvali (APOEL), Jemal Tabidze (Panetolikos), Luka Lochoshvili (Cremonese), Giorgi Gocholeishvili (Shakhtar Donetsk), Giorgi Gvelesiani (Persepolis).\n\nMidfielders: - Gabriel Sigua (Basel), Nika Kvekverskiri (Lech Poznan), Otar Kiteishvili (Sturm Graz), Saba Lobzhanidze (Atlanta United), Zuriko Davitashvili (Bordeaux), Giorgi Chakvetadze (Watford), Levan Shengelia (Panetlikos), Giorgi Tsitaishvili (Dinamo Batumi), Anzor Mekvabishvili (Universitatea Craiova), Giorgi Kochorashvili (Levante), Sandro Altunashvili (Wolfsberger AC).\n\nStrikers: Giorgi Kvilitaia (APOEL), Khvicha Kvaratskhelia (Napoli), Budu Zivzivadze (Karlsruher SC), Georges Mikautadze (Metz).\n\nPortugal\n\nFixtures\n\nPortugal Kit 1\n\nCopyright © Soccerphile\n\nPortugal Kit 2\n\nCopyright © Soccerphile\n\nPortugal Kit 3\n\nCopyright © Soccerphile\n\nPortugal v Czechia, 18th June, Leipzig\n\nPortugal v Turkey, 22nd June, Dortmund\n\nPortugal v Georgia, 26th June, Gelsenkirchen\n\nCoach\n\nRoberto Martínez.

Widely considered Portugal's best player.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo - still going strong at age 39 but now plays his football for Al-Nassr in Saudi Arabia. Team captain and talisman, Ronaldo scored 10 goals in qualifying behind only Romelu Lukaku with 14. He is the the all-time top scorer in men's international football with 128 goals and counting.\n\nFrancisco Conceição - the 21-year-old is an exciting young talent at FC Porto but unlikely to get much playing time. One to watch for the future.\n\nPredictions & Latest Odds\n\nShould win the group at a canter and are potential winners, 4th favorites behind England, France and Germany.\n\nHow they qualified\n\nWon Group J winning all 10 matches scoring 36 goals and conceding just two.\n\nOn the sidelines\n\nDefender Pepe has made over 130 appearances for Portugal behind CR7 who has over 200! Englishman Anthony Barry is an assistant coach.\n\nFormation\n\n4-2-2-2\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe talent factory that is football-mad Portugal continues to churn out talent and the team is packed with star players from Europe's major leagues in almost every position.\n\nSquad\n\nGoalkeepers: Rui Patricio (Roma), Jose Sa (Wolves), Diogo Costa (Porto).\n\nDefenders: Nelson Semedo (Wolves), Antonio Silva (Benfica), Danilo Pereira (PSG), Joao Cancelo (Barcelona), Ruben Dias (Manchester City), Pepe (Porto), Goncalo Inacio (Sporting Lisbon), Diogo Dalot (Manchester United), Nuno Mendes (PSG).\n\nMidfielders: Joao Palhinha (Fulham), Bruno Fernandes (Manchester United), uben Neves (Al Hilal), Vitinha (PSG), Joao Neves (Benfica), Matheus Nunes (Manchester City), Bernardo Silva (Manchester City).\n\nStrikers: - Goncalo Ramos (PSG), Joao Felix (Barcelona), Rafael Leao (AC Milan), Francisco Conceicao (Porto), Cristiano Ronaldo (Al Nassr), Diogo Jota (Liverpool), Pedro Neto (Wolves).\n\nCzechia\n\nFixtures\n\nCzechia Kit 1\n\nCopyright © Soccerphile\n\nCzechia Kit 2\n\nCopyright © Soccerphile\n\nCzechia Kit 3\n\nCopyright © Soccerphile\n\nCzechia v Portugal, 18th June, Leipzig\n\nCzechia v Georgia, 22nd June, Hamburg\n\nCzechia v Turkey, 26th June, Hamburg\n\nCoach\n\nIvan Hašek, an ex-Sparta Prague midfielder, has spent much of his managerial career in the Middle East.\n\nRecord\n\n2000, 2008, 2016 First Round, 2012, 2020 Quarter Final, 2004 Semi Final, 1996 Finalists\n\nFIFA Ranking (36th) in the world\n\nMen to watch\n\nPatrik Schick - comes off a successful season with Bayer Leverkusen with 13 goals in all competitions and will be the team's main goal threat.\n\nPredictions & Latest Odds\n\nVying with Turkey to escape the group with Portugal.\n\nHow they qualified\n\nThe Czechs were Group E runners-up behind surprise package Albania winning four of their 8 games, with 3 draws and 1 loss.\n\nOn the sidelines\n\nEx-Chelsea keeper Petr Čech (now retired) still holds the caps record with 124 appearances.\n\nFormation\n\n4-3-3\n\nAnalysis\n\nWith several of the squad including Adam Hlozek and Patrik Schick of champions Bayer Leverkusen playing their football in the Bundesliga, the team should feel at home in neighboring Germany. Captain Tomáš Souček weighed in with 10 goals for West Ham United in the 2023-2024 season and is the driving force in midfield. Their final group game with Turkey on 26th June in Hamburg could be a straight shoot out for who goes through with expected group winners Portugal.\n\nSquad\n\nGoalkeepers: Jindrich Stanek (Slavia Prague), Vitezslav Jaros (Sturm Graz), Matej Kovar (Bayer Leverkusen).\n\nDefenders: Vladimir Coufal (West Ham United), Tomas Holes (Slavia Prague), David Zima (Slavia Prague), Ladislav Krejci (Sparta Prague), David Jurasek (Hoffenheim), Robin Hranac (Viktoria Plzen), Tomas Vlcek (Slavia Prague), Martin Vitík (Sparta Prague).\n\nMidfielders: Tomas Soucek (West Ham), Antonin Barak (Fiorentina), David Doudera (Slavia Prague), Michal Sadilek (Twente), Lukas Provod (Slavia Prague), Vaclav Cerny (VfL Wolfsburg), Ondrej Lingr (Feyenoord), Marej Jurasek (Slavia Prague), Pavel Sulc (Viktoria Plzen), Lukas Cerv (Viktoria Plzen).\n\nStrikers: Patrik Schick (Bayer Leverkusen), Adam Hlozek (Bayer Leverkusen), Jan Kuchta (Sparta Prague), Mojmir Chytil (Slavia Prague), Tomas Chory (Viktoria Plzen)."
