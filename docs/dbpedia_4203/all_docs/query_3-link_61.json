        "text": "Growing up in a city which lays claim to Homer, Caglar Soyuncu's odyssey was also far from straightforward.\n\nJust as scholars can't decide where the legendary Greek poet truly originated, the Leicester centre-back’s early coaches couldn't agree whether he was a striker, midfielder or defender.\n\nAnd like in those epic poems, it was the fall of one man which allowed Soyuncu to rise, albeit not quite as dramatically as the Trojan War.\n\n\"I started as a central forward and played there for a few years before they moved me into the midfield area,” Soyuncu tells talkSPORT.com.\n\n\"I was happy as a striker, I was happy as a midfielder, too. There was an injury problem which meant that I played in the defence.\n\n\"I don't think I'll play any other position from now on - I'm happy where I am.\"\n\nAnd with good reason. Soyuncu, 24, has gone from the second tier of Turkish football to one of Europe’s most highly-rated defenders in just four years.\n\nListen to live commentary of Everton vs Leicester on talkSPORT 2 tonight\n\nHis courage, flair, and willingness to take risks on the ball probably stems from his early days in attacking roles, but it is also rooted in childhood.\n\nSoyuncu left home when he was just a boy to follow his dream. He adds: \"I started playing in Izmir and when you start as a young child, you think about football, you play football, you just live football.\n\n\"Everyone loves football in the city and country where I am from.\n\n\"It became quite difficult around the age of 11 because I had to leave my family.\n\n\"So for 13 years I've been separated from them and that's quite tough.”\n\nFrom 2006, Soyuncu’s youth career saw him journey through Izmir, at Menemen Belediyespor, Bucaspor, and Gumusorduspor, before joining second-tier Turkish club Altinordu as an 18-year-old in 2014.\n\nMuch like we’ll forgive you for not knowing who any of those clubs are, it’s also likely you weren’t aware of Soyuncu until he stepped into Harry Maguire’s shoes at the King Power this season.\n\nBut this isn’t the first time Soyuncu has gone from unknown entity to high-profile star, it’s sort of what he does.\n\nNot since Said Altinordu - the man who actually had the club named in his honour - did Altinordu have a player called up to the Turkey national team.\n\nWhile playing more than 800 times for Altinordu over 27 years as a professional, the legendary Turk only made four appearances for his country.\n\nAt 24, Soyuncu already has 28 caps, earning a call up after his first season as a senior professional and becoming the first Altinordu player to receive that honour in 78 years.\n\nKids from clubs in Izmir just don’t tend to make the national team, Soyuncu was the first since 1997. Again, it was due to an injury, this time to Serdar Aziz. Not even Homer could write this.\n\n\"It's a great feeling, you represent your country and all the youngsters look up to you and idolise you, like I used to do when I was a child,” Soyuncu says.\n\n\"I can't explain in words how proud I feel, it's a very nice feeling.”\n\nWhat next for someone so clearly earmarked as a future great of Turkey? Freiburg, obviously.\n\nFor a 20-year-old Turkey international competing in the country’s second tier, all roads lead to Istanbul. Besiktas, Galatasaray, or Fenerbahce - take your pick.\n\n\"Besiktas and Galatasaray had actually made better offers,” Soyuncu reveals. “Then Freiburg came along and it was a very modest team.\n\n\"But they gave so much importance to their young players. So I took the challenge on, and that's why I signed for them.\"\n\nYou’ll have worked out by this point that Soyuncu does things differently.\n\nFew defenders would attempt a Cruyff turn against Raul Jimenez in their own box, or sit forwards like Christian Pulisic on their backside and scoop the ball over them.\n\nIn another first, nobody else from the Turkish second division had ever moved straight to the Bundesliga.\n\nHis meteoric rise continued in Germany and suddenly, in 2018, half of Europe wanted to sign him. Lille, Roma, Villarreal, Manchester City, and Arsenal, to name a few. Boy, the Gunners could do with someone like Soyuncu right now.\n\nBut the Turk must have worried whether, like Arsenal, he made a mistake during the 2018 transfer window.\n\nHe was left in the cold by Claude Puel - and then struggled to break Brendan Rodgers’ preferred partnership of Maguire and Jonny Evans.\n\nBut following the sale of Maguire to Manchester United for £75million last summer, Leicester did not opt to buy someone new. They had this £19m superstar they bought the year before - and if anything, he’s just as good. Leicester’s league position would certainly suggest they haven’t been weakened.\n\nRodgers tells talkSPORT: “When I came here, he was just outside of the squad, but he’s become a very important player for us. He’s a very humble guy who wants to improve his game.\n\n“He’s been outstanding. For his first season in the Premier League, he’s a proper man for such a young player.\n\n“He’s super quick, really strong, and he can play football. I’ve been delighted with Cags.”\n\nCags, or Lord Farquaad as fans call him due to his chiselled jaw and wavy locks, never doubted he would make it at the King Power.\n\n\"From the very early days, I believed that my opportunity would come and I would do my best to take it,” he adds.\n\n\"But it wasn't a fast start to my career at Leicester. I worked hard and believed in the manager. That's why I'm where I am now.\n\n\"It would be great to be successful at this great club. We are like a family here, not only the footballers, but the city as a whole, we are a big family and we can feel that.\n\n\"It would be great to play in the Champions League with this team. I would love to be part of it.”\n\nDespite some questionable form since the Premier League’s restart, Leicester look set to qualify for next season’s Champions League, vindicating every seemingly mad decision Soyuncu has made up to this point.\n\nHaving grown up idolising three-time Champions League winner Carles Puyol, and watching Turkey finish third at Euro 2008, Soyuncu is trying to set his own date with destiny next season by taking the stage in Europe's biggest international and domestic competitions.\n\nWhere will the next chapter of this epic poem lead? Well, the 2021 Champions League final is in Istanbul..."
