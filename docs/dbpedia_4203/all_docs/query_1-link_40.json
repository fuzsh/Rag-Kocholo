It's with his weaker right foot though, and it's blocked for it reaches the goal.\n\n90'\n\n+ 1\n\nStoppage time\n\nThere will be seven added minutes here for Germany to find an equaliser...\n\n86'\n\nSoooo close from Gnabry!\n\nHenrichs again scampers down the right and gets behind the Turkey defence. He plays a ball right along the face of goal and it only needs touch to go in, but Gnabry, sliding it at full stretch at the back post, can't quite get the necessary direction on it, and the ball goes wide!\n\n82'\n\nDebut for Ducksch!\n\nWhat a moment for the 29-year-old Bremen forward, who is reunited up top with his former Werder strike partner Füllkrug. Could he crown his debut with a goal?\n\n81'\n\nSubstitution\n\n77'\n\nGermany increasing the pressure\n\nSané delivers a wicked corner from the right that Turkey just about manage to clear. Gnabry then has an opening from the edge of the box but his effort is blocked.\n\n73'\n\nSubstitution\n\n73'\n\nSubstitution\n\n73'\n\nSubstitution\n\n72'\n\nTurkey lead again!\n\nTrapp guess the right way, diving low to his left, but Sari's penalty has too much power behind it and the ball squeezes under the Frankfurt goalkeeper.\n\n71'\n\nYusuf Sari\n\nGOAL!\n\n2:3\n\n70'\n\nPenalty to Turkey!\n\nFollowing a VAR review, the referee awards the visitors a penalty for a handball by Havertz.\n\n66'\n\nGermany in behind\n\nBranst releases Henrichs down the right, in behind the visiting defence. He gets to the byline and crosses into the middle but the goalkeeper watches the ball all the way and soon snuffs out the danger.\n\n63'\n\nSubstitution\n\n63'\n\nSubstitution\n\n63'\n\nSubstitution\n\n60'\n\nChance for Gündogan!\n\nGermany again break forward well and they work the ball from left to right. Henrichs spies Gündogan's run and slots it through to him. The captain turns his marker and cuts inside onto his left foot, but his shot is blocked at close range.\n\nMr. Reliable\n\nThat's now 10 international goals in 12 games for Germany for Füllkrug.\n\n© Getty Images\n\n54'\n\nÖzcan hits the post!\n\nTurkey very nearly take the lead again! Dortmund midfielder Salih Özcan receives possession just outside the area and shoots with his left foot. Trapp dives full stretch to his left but can't get there, and is only saved by the ball crashing off the post and bouncing clear!\n\n50'\n\nLevel again!\n\nA brilliant counter-attack from Germany. It all stems from a Turkey throw-in, deep in Germany's half. The hosts win it back and race forward with Wirtz, who effortlessly bamboozles Ayhan in the middle of the pitch before surging forward some more. He has Brandt and Sané with him as options but elects to slip it to his left to Füllkrug, who cuts inside his marker and drills a low shot inside the near post.\n\n49'\n\nNiclas Füllkrug\n\nGOAL!\n\n2:2\n\n46'\n\nUnder way again!\n\nTurkey get us started in the second half.\n\n46'\n\nSubstitution\n\nKick-off!\n\nHalf-time\n\n45'\n\n+ 2\n\nWell, well, well!\n\nTurkey lead! A cross from the right isn't dealt with and all of a sudden Yıldız is all by himself at the back post. He wastes no time in hammering the ball beyond Trapp in at the back post. That should make for an interesting second half!\n\n45'\n\n+ 2\n\nKenan Yıldız\n\nGOAL!\n\n1:2\n\n39'\n\nTurkey equalise!\n\nBardakcı spies some space down the Turkey left and pings a laser-guided pass into the path of Kadıoğlu, who ghosted in behind Sané. He scurries into the box and smashes an unstoppable shot past Trapp. Game on!\n\n38'\n\nFerdi Kadıoğlu\n\nGOAL!\n\n1:1\n\n34'\n\nSubstitution\n\n31'\n\nGreat chance for Yazıcı!\n\nTurkey's best opportunity of the game so far comes after some more intricate play around the edge of Germany's box. It's flicked through to Yazıcı, who gets a shot away from a tight angle on the left, but it's blocked for a corner.\n\n24'\n\nAttacking vibes\n\nThe visitors are producing some eye-catching, one-touch football around the edge of the Germany box. All that's lacking is the final ball, but so far Tah, Rüdiger and Henrichs have looked solid.\n\nThe difference\n\nHavertz's opening goal in the fifth minute.\n\n© Getty Images\n\n17'\n\nYıldız has a go\n\nYıldız shoots from long range, trying to catch Trapp off guard, but the Frankfurt goalkeeper watches it all the way and saves.\n\n16'\n\nAlmost two!\n\nAnother defence-splitting pass, this time from Kimmich, almost leads to Germany's second goal. The Bayern midfielder takes out three or four defenders in one fell swoop with his ball through to Sané, who is left with just the goalkeeper to beat. He shoots from outside the area but his effort rolls wide of the post.\n\n12'\n\nYazıcı takes aim\n\nA dipping, left-footed shot from outside the box whistles just wide of Trapp's post.\n\n9'\n\nBold visitors\n\nTurkey are by no means sitting back and defending deep, they're getting forward at every opportunity, trying to stretch the game.\n\n6'\n\nGermany lead!\n\nTurkey fail to properly clear a floated free-kick into the box and the ball is recycled out to Henrichs. He plays a stunning, defence-splitting pass into the path of Sané on the right and the Bayern man jinks into the box before cutting the ball back into the middle for Havertz to prod in from close range.\n\n5'\n\nKai Havertz\n\nGOAL!\n\n1:0\n\n2'\n\nLively opening\n\nKadıoğlu executes a brilliant turn down the Turkey left, completely fooling Sané before skipping into the box and getting past Tah. He crosses into the middle but it's hooked clear.\n\n1'\n\nAnd we're off!\n\nFlorian Wirtz gets the ball rolling for Germany in Berlin!\n\nKick-off!\n\nAnthems!\n\nBoth nations' anthems have been belted out. It's almost time!\n\nIn the tunnel\n\nThe players are primed and ready, jut awaiting the final instructions from the referee before taking to the pitch.\n\nPitch inspection\n\nJoshua Kimmich (c) and his Germany team-mates take a closer look at the playing surface in Berlin.\n\n© Imago Images\n\nSix changes for Germany\n\nNagelsmann has made several tweaks to his side following last month's 2-2 draw with Mexico. Marc-Andre ter Stegen's back injury has opened the door for Kevin Trapp to start, while Kai Havertz, Julian Brandt, Benjamin Henrichs, Joshua Kimmich and Niklas Füllkrug all start.\n\nGermany starting XI\n\nTrapp - Tah, Rüdiger, Henrichs - Kimmich, Gündoğan (c) - Havertz, Wirtz, Sané - Füllkrug\n\nGermany subs\n\nBlaswich, Baumann, Prömel, Hummels, Goretzka, Gnabry, Müller, Groß, Süle, Hofmann, Ducksch, Raum, Andrich\n\nTurkey starting XI\n\nBayindir - Çelik, Kabak, Bardakcı, Kadıoğlu - Akbaba, Ayhan (c), Yüksek - Yazıcı - Yıldız, Kahveci\n\nTurkey subs\n\nGünok, Çakir, Akaydin, Söyüncü, Özcan, Özdemir, Aktürkoğlu, B. Yılmaz, Ömur, Elmali, Sari, Kutlu, Özkacar, R. Yılmaz, Yıldırım\n\n'Special match' for Gündogan\n\nThe parents of Ilkay Gündogan are both originally from Turkey, whom the Germany captain is due to face for the first time. He said: \"It will be a very special match for me - no doubt about it.\" Gündogan revealed he travels at least once per year to the land of his ancestry, and praised both the wonderful city of Istanbul and Turkish cuisine ahead of the match.\n\n© IMAGO/Uwe Kraft\n\nNew ground for Nagelsmann\n\nJulian Nagelsmann will take to the national team dugout for the first time in Germany when his side face Turkey in Berlin. He led Germany to a 3-1 win against the US National Team and a 2-2 draw with Mexico in the US in his first two matches in charge last month.\n\n© IMAGO/MIS\n\nMontella's marvels\n\nTurkey's new Italian coach Vincenzo Montella enjoyed a dream first international window last month. A 1-0 win in Croatia and 4-0 victory at home to Latvia saw them seal their own spot in EURO 2024.\n\nWill the new boys be given a chance to shine?\n\nIt is an exciting time to be hitting form if you are a German player in contention for a national call-up, with EURO 2024 at home next summer firmly on the horizon. Leipzig goalkeeper Janis Blaswich, Hoffenheim midfielder Grischa Prömel and Werder Bremen striker Marvin Ducksch will all hope to get the chance to impress against Turkey after making the national team squad for the first time.\n\nWelcome along!\n\nThank you for joining us for live updates ahead of and during the Germany v Turkey friendly clash in Berlin on Saturday night.\n\nRelive Nagelsmann's winning debut against the USA\n\nHow might Nagelsmann's Germany line up at Euro 2024?\n\nFind out more about Euro 2024 in Germany next summer\n\nSee where the games will be held across Germany\n\nPlenty of eyes will be on Julian Nagelsmann's team selection in his second international window as Germany coach. With Turkey one of eight nations having already secured qualification for next summer's European championship finals, the clash in Berlin provides a chance to explore how the Euro 2024 hosts may shape up. With Jamal Musiala the biggest injury absentee, Sané and Wirtz might be entrusted with providing the impetus to Germany's attacking play, with both lighting up the Bundesliga at times this season. Niclas Füllkrug scored in both of Nagelsmann's first two matches in charge as Germany toured the US last month to take his impressive international scoring record up to nine in 11 appearances. Nagelsmann might be minded to hand Füllkrug's former Werder Bremen strike partner Marvin Ducksch his first taste of international action though, following his first call-up. Also in contention to make his Germany debut is RB Leipzig goalkeeper Janis Blaswich, with Manuel Neuer sitting out of international duty given his recent recovery from a complex injury, and news of Marc-André ter Stegen's withdrawal because of back troubles.\n\nTurkey coach Vincenzo Montella is likewise expected to want to use the trip to Berlin to give his side a real test ahead of Euro 2024. Borussia Dortmund's Salih Özcan features in a strong first-choice midfield alongside former Bayer Leverkusen star and current Inter Milan set-piece specialist Hakan Çalhanoğlu. Hoffenheim defender Ozan Kabak could well feature too after recovering from a shoulder injury to play in his side's last two Bundesliga encounters. One-time Schalke youth product Kaan Ayhan has recently worked his way back into the Turkey squad, with former Freiburg defender Çağlar Söyüncü making brief appearances for Atletico Madrid in recent weeks after his recovery from a groin problem. Experienced striker Cenk Tosun developed at Eintracht Frankfurt and played for various German youth national teams.\n\nWatch: The best Leroy Sané ever?\n\nWant more Bundesliga Action?\n\nMatch stats\n\nSané is enjoying his best season yet, with eight goals and six assists after 11 Bundesliga matches.\n\nWirtz has contributed eight goals for Bundesliga leaders Leverkusen, two less than club and countryman Jonas Hofmann.\n\nThese teams last met in October 2020 when they shared a 3-3 friendly draw. None of Germany's scorers that day - Julian Draxler, Florian Neuhaus and Luca Waldschmidt - are included in the current squad.\n\nOverall, Germany have by far the superior record in this fixture, with 14 wins, four draws and just three defeats across 21 games.\n\nNagelsmann's record as Germany boss currently stands and one win (3-1 vs. USA) and one draw (2-2 vs. Mexico). Both matches were played in the October international break.\n\nTurkey coach Montella was appointed in his role one day prior to Nagelsmann becoming Germany coach in September.\n\nCONFIRMED teams\n\nGermany: Trapp - Tah, Rüdiger, Henrichs - Kimmich, Gündoğan (c) - Havertz, Wirtz, Sané - Füllkrug\n\nSubs: Blaswich, Baumann, Prömel, Hummels, Goretzka, Gnabry, Müller, Groß, Süle, Hofmann, Ducksch, Raum, Andrich\n\nOut: Can (thigh), Führich (ill), Gosens (personal reasons), Günter (broken arm), Musiala (hamstring), F.
