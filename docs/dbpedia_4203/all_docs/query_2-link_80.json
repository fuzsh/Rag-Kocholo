        "text": "Fenerbahçe's Çağlar Söyüncü, who was bought by Fenerbahçe from Atletico Madrid for 8.5 million euros, made statements during the team's camp in Austria. Çağlar, who used words full of praise for coach Jose Mourinho, also made a confession about the Portuguese coach.\n\nThe 28-year-old defender's statements are as follows;\n\n\"THERE IS A COACH WHO HAS PROVEN HIMSELF TO THE WORLD\"\n\n\"I am really happy to be here again. We have a good atmosphere. There is a team spirit that has not been broken since last year. We have a legendary coach, a coach who has proven himself to the world. I hope we can pass these stages without any injuries and be ready for official matches.\n\n\"I KNEW HE WANTED ME\"\n\nOur coach was at Tottenham when I was at Leicester. We had humorous conversations during the matches. We competed against each other in the Conference League. We had conversations, but they were not serious. I knew he wanted me. I was very happy to come to Fenerbahçe. I transferred to Fenerbahçe without thinking.\n\n\"I WILL START TRAINING WITH THE TEAM IN 1 WEEK\"\n\nI talked to our doctors, and there is a small image in the MRI due to the injury from the last match of last season, although it is very small. I am not at the same level as my teammates. We will continue the recovery process without taking risks. We talked to our coach and doctor. We have 1 more week, then I will start training with the team.\n\n\"I WANTED TO CONTINUE AT FENERBAHÇE\"\n\nI told our president that I wanted to stay at Fenerbahçe since I came. I tried to reflect this in my football. I am happy because I played in Europe for many years, but I wanted to continue at Fenerbahçe. Our president asked me about my thoughts last season, and I said that my priority was Fenerbahçe. It has been 1 month since the end of the season, and I haven't answered anyone's phone calls. Our president, Acun Brother, Mario took very good care of me. My priority was Fenerbahçe, and it finally happened.\n\n\"IT'S NOT MY PLACE TO TALK ABOUT MOURINHO\"\n\nWhat I'm going to say may be cliché, but it's not my place to talk about our coach Mourinho. We are very lucky as a country and as football players that he came. It is important for such names to come to our country. It is also very important for young players from the academy. 16-17 year old kids are training with Mourinho. It's a great opportunity.\n\n\"WE WILL ELIMINATE HOLLAND AND ADVANCE\"\n\nI congratulate all my teammates. It's a proud situation. We made it out of the group. We are playing well. Of course, there are some shortcomings, but there are no return matches there. I am very sorry that I couldn't be there. Everything happens for a reason. I believe that we will eliminate Holland and advance. I am in contact with my friends there, of course. We talk after every match, good or bad. I talked to all my friends after the Portugal match. We have no problem in that regard.\""
