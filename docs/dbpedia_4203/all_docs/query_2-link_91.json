        "text": "ARSENAL'S pursuit of Freiburg defender Caglar Soyuncu has been labelled as \"total nonsense\" by the club director.\n\nReports emerged that the Gunners had beaten Bayern Munich to his signature according to the president of second-tier Turkish side Altinordu - Soyuncu's former club.\n\nSeyit Mehmet Ozkan, speaking at the International Football Economic Forum, said: \"Caglar Soyuncu is set to join Arsenal.\n\n\"Arsenal demanded his youth information from us. We'll earn from him, if he joins Arsenal.\n\n\"Bayern Munich wants him too, but he's on the way to the Premier League.\"\n\nBut those reports are way off according to Freiburg chief Jochen Saier.\n\nHe told Bild: \"Ozkan can know little about the overall scenario. This is total nonsense. Arsenal did not contact me and there is no offer.”\n\nArsenal sent scouts to watch Turkish international Soyuncu, 21, in action for Freiburg earlier this season.\n\nThey were again in attendance for his country's 1-0 win over the Republic of Ireland in March.\n\nBundesliga outfit Freiburg are expected to drive a hard bargain, however, and could want in excess of £30m.\n\nThey battled Sevilla and Besiktas to sign Soyuncu from second-tier Turkish outfit Altinordu for just £2.4m in 2016.\n\nThirteen-cap Soyuncu has gone on to display an all-round defensive game to rival the Bundesliga's best blockers - with comparisons drawn to Mats Hummels.\n\nThe Gunners have identified defence as an area in need of improvement.\n\nThey signed Greek ace Konstantinos Mavropanos from PAS Giannina in January and he made his debut in Sunday's 2-1 defeat at Old Trafford."
