INTERNATIONAL TURKISH FOOTBALLER

Welcome, Söyüncü!

The center-back, who will join our club at the start of the preseason, signs for four seasons after having spent the previous five at Leicester City.

Çağlar Söyüncü is now a new player for Atlético de Madrid following the agreement reached between our club and the Turkish footballer, who signs for four seasons. Born on May 23, 1996, in Izmir (Turkey), he will join the squad at the beginning of the 2023/24 preseason, which will start on Friday, July 7.

The player is 27 years old, a solid and strong central defender who is also skillful, very difficult to surpass not only because of his 187 centimeters in height and 82 kilograms in weight but especially due to his ability to win the position, his anticipation, and his clean tackling.

Having come through the youth ranks of Menemen Belediyespor, Bucaspor, and Gümüşorduspor, he made his professional debut in the 2014/15 season, wearing the Altınordu shirt, with whom he played 40 matches over two seasons before heading to Freiburg. In Germany, he continued to demonstrate his defensive qualities, playing 55 official matches over two seasons before his arrival at Leicester City.

With a total of 53 appearances for the Turkish national team to date, after his time in the Bundesliga, he landed at the King Power Stadium and played 132 matches with the 'Foxes,' being a key figure in their historic conquests of the FA Cup 2020/21 and the Community Shield 2021.

The Turkish center-back successfully completed the necessary medical examination at Vithas and then headed to the club's offices at the Cívitas Metropolitano, where he was received by our CEO, Miguel Ángel Gil, to finalize his contract with our club.
