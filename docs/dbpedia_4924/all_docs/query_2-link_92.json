        "text": "JACKSON, Miss. (AP) â€” The Mississippi Senate has confirmed an attorney as the newest member of the state Workers Compensation Commission.\n\nMark Henry of Brandon was nominated by Republican Gov. Phil Bryant in January. Senators confirmed him to the three-person commission on Thursday for a term that runs through 2024.\n\nHenry moves over from his job as director of the Mississippi Department of Employment Security.\n\nHenry was lead attorney and then chief of staff for Republican Gov. Kirk Fordice in the 1990s. Fordice named him an administrative judge for the Workers Compensation Commission in 2000, and Henry remained there until 2008.\n\nFrom 2008 to 2012, Henry was chief of staff for Bryant, who was lieutenant governor.\n\nWhen Bryant became governor in 2012, he named Henry to lead Employment Security."
