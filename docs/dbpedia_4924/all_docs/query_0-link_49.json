Kirk Fordice's funeral? - Lucille\n\nA: Jack sought help from Wright and Ferguson Funeral Home in Jackson.\n\nThey found the program which shows Stuart played a mandolin medley at funeral in 2004.\n\nFolks in Stuart's office sent word that he compiled the music just for the funeral, centering it around Ashokan's Farewell by Jay Ungar."
