        "text": "Since December 17, 1996, I've served as your friendly neighborhood editorial cartoonist. In that time, I've drawn over 6,000 cartoons for the Clarion Ledger. And, I've also been asked a gaggle of questions. Here are a few of them – with honest answers:\n\nWhy do you draw cars with tiny wheels?\n\nIn the late 1980's, I went to an Association of American Editorial Cartoonist convention. We had a portfolio review session, where seasoned cartoonists would review your work. I met with a cartoonist named Lee Judge, who was the cartoonist at the Kansas City Star. He looked at my collegiate cartoons and said, \"I like what you're doing here but if you're going to draw cartoons, you should make them look funny.\" So I drew car wheels tiny. It kind of stuck and I get asked about that nearly every question and answer session.\n\nWhy don't you draw cartoons I agree with?\n\nI will call you every morning when I get up at 4 a.m. and ask you what's on your mind.\n\nWhat if I told you I don't agree with you all the time?\n\nMy wife doesn't either and she married me. It doesn't hurt my feelings if you disagree with me. And I don't hate you if you do. I'm tired of the \"if you don't agree with me you're the enemy\" crud that has infected so many of us.\n\nDo you take suggestions?\n\nNo. I also rarely look at other cartoons. I don't want to accidentally copy an idea.\n\nWhy are your cartoons biased?\n\nI get this one frequently. The long answer: They are editorial cartoons — thus are my opinion. The short answer: Really?\n\n(This question makes my hair hurt.)\n\nWho was/is your favorite person to draw?\n\n1. Kirk Fordice. 2. Frank Melton. 3. Haley Barbour. 4. Chris McDaniel's possum. 5. Kenny Stokes. Honorable Mention: (Tie) Phil Bryant's, Trent Lott's and Mike Moore's hair.\n\nWhat's your favorite cartoon?\n\n1. The eagle head cartoon after 9/11 2. Bert Case about to get whacked by Kirk Fordice (because I have a copy of it signed by both men).\n\nThe Barbara Bush cartoon is deeply special to me because it took on a life of its own by giving comfort to parents who lost children. Every artist hopes their art can make a difference. I have been blessed to have one cartoon do so.\n\nWhy won't you argue with me on social media?\n\nLife's too short.\n\nHow long does it take for you to draw a cartoon?\n\nDepends on how detailed I make the art. I don't have as much time now to draw as I used to but still try to make the drawings halfway decent. The eagle head cartoon after 9/11 took six hours. I don't have six hours anymore!\n\nDo you use paper and pens or a tablet?\n\nI draw by hand (Micron pens on Bristol Board) and color on the computer. I still like to have an original. I can draw and paint on a tablet, though.\n\nWhy do you do radio, TV, books etc.?\n\nI have TV and radio shows on Mississippi Public Broadcasting. The shows allow me to meet and interview people who I find interesting and have great stories to tell. It also allows me to showcase Mississippi, a place I love.\n\nHow can you say that if you draw mean cartoons about Mississippi?\n\nIf I didn't love Mississippi, I wouldn't care. If I didn't care, I couldn't draw cartoons here.\n\nWhy haven't you left Mississippi? (I get this question from politicians)\n\nI like it here. My boys are native Mississippians and I'm proud of that. I saw how we responded after Katrina and know we have so much good in us — even on the not-so-good days. Mississippi is a beautiful but complex and at times frustrating place. But like a piece of grit irritating an oyster, we produce beautiful pearls.\n\nWhat annoys you?\n\nPoliticians who paint themselves as victims and feed off of fear. Potholes. Humidity. Bumper-to-bumper traffic. Melanoma. Racism.\n\nMore: Geoffrey Owens and a salute to the sacredness of work"
