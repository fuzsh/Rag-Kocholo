S. Army and retired a colonel in the U. S. Army Reserves after serving 18 years.\n\nHe founded Fordice Construction Company in Vicksburg and served as the president of the Associated General Contractors of America in 1990 and was named the Association's Man of the Year in 1992.\n\nFordice served a second term as governor after winning reelection in 1995.\n\nPatricia Owens \"Pat\" Fordice served her state tirelessly as first lady, promoting literacy, the arts, health issues, strong families, and volunteerism. U. S. Representative Chip Pickering's remembrances best describe why Mississippians loved their first lady, \"Regal yet approachable, she possessed a natural Southern elegance that transcended her term and endeared her to our hearts.\"\n\nGovernor and Mrs. Fordice raised four children and were beloved grandparents."
