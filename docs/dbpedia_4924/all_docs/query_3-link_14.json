He served in the Mississippi House of Representatives, 1928 to 1932; as a District Attorney, 1932 to 1937; as Circuit Court Judge, 1937 to 1947; and as United States Senator, November 1947 to January 1989. He died April 23, 1995, and is interred in Pinecrest Cemetery, DeKalb, Mississippi. The late Coy Hines and he were married in 1929. He was a Presbyterian. Survivors include his son John Hampton, daughter Margaret Womble, and six grandchildren. MEMORIAL TRIBUTES to JOHN C. STENNIS Proceedings in the Senate Monday, April 24, 1995. The Chaplain, Dr. Lloyd John Ogilvie, offered the following prayer: Let us pray: Almighty God, our hearts are at half-mast with grief over the catastrophic bombing of the Federal building in Oklahoma City. We mourn for the victims, especially the children, of this senseless crime and reach out with profound empathy to their families. We ask You to strengthen them as they endure incredible suffering. Graciously grant physical and emotional healing to those who survived. Most of all, comfort the children who ask ``why?'' and give wisdom to parents as they search for words to answer. We all need help in understanding an ignominious act of tyranny like this. We only can imagine the agony of Your heart, Father. If our indignation burns white-hot, it must be small in comparison to Your judgment. You have given us freedom of will and made us responsible for the welfare of our neighbors. Our hearts break with Your heart over those who willfully cause suffering. Therefore, we boldly ask for Your divine intervention for the speedy capture and punishment of these traitors against our Nation and the sacredness of human life. As You have given us victory in just wars, now give us a strategy to defeat the illusive and dangerous forces of organized terrorism. Lord God of this Senate, we are never more of one mind and heart than when dealing with a threat to our national security or in responding to a catastrophe in any one of our States. We rally in support of Senators Nickles and Inhofe as they continue to care for their people. We press on to the issues of this day with the strong inspiration of the 40 years of leadership of John Stennis in this Senate. May the memory of his faith in You and his courage in conflict give us determination to seek, as he did, to do our best. In the Lord's name. Amen. Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I will just take a moment to talk about our departed friend who served here for many, many years, Senator John Stennis. When he left the Senate in 1989, he had served in this Chamber for 41 years-- nearly one-fifth of the Senate's history. And those of us privileged to serve with him knew that he was one of the true giants of that history. Senator Stennis passed away yesterday at the age of 93, and I join all Senators in expressing our condolences on the death of our former colleague and in extending our sympathies to members of his family. Senator Stennis and I came from different regions of the country, from different political parties, and we had different views on many issues. But no one could know or serve with John Stennis without admiring his character, his integrity, or his patriotism. John Stennis loved the Senate and worked to make it a better place. He was the first chairman of the Senate Committee on Standards and Conduct and was the author of the Senate's first code of ethics. John Stennis also loved America, and as chairman of the Armed Services Committee, he never wavered from his belief that America's national defense should be second to none. John Stennis was also a man of remarkable courage. In his seventies, he was shot and left for dead by robbers outside his Washington home. And in his eighties, he lost a leg to cancer. On both occasions, he not only recovered, but he was also back at work long before anyone thought possible. Those of us who were here at the time will always remember the days when Senator Stennis returned to the Chamber and the outpouring of respect and admiration that he received. Mr. President, during his final years in this Chamber, Senator John Stennis was asked in an interview how he would like to be remembered, and he responded: ``You couldn't give me a finer compliment than just to say, `He did his best.' '' Today, his family, friends, and former colleagues can take solace in the fact that he will be remembered exactly how he wished--as a man who always gave nothing less than his best. Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, we in the Senate were shocked to hear the news of the passing of a cherished friend and a former colleague: former Senator John Stennis from Mississippi. Senator Stennis served in this Senate Chamber for 40 years--from the time of his election to the Senate in 1947, through his retirement in 1989. During that time, he dedicated himself to giving our Nation the gift of wisdom and leadership. Senator Stennis was greatly admired by all who had the honor to serve with him. As chairman of the Armed Services Committee, he served with several Presidents; during that time he led the committee through the darkest days of the Vietnam war. Although he often saw his position on that war opposed by some of his fellow Democrats, he always did what he believed to be correct and in the best interest of our Nation. For many years, Senator Stennis and I were neighbors in the Russell Building. I recall with great fondness the kindness and good cheer he showed to me and my office staff on the many occasions he stopped in to say hello. Senator Stennis completed his Senate career by serving with great distinction as President Pro Tempore of the Senate. I had the honor of serving with Senator John Stennis for almost my entire Senate career. Throughout the years, I came to appreciate and respect his qualities of integrity, ability, and dedication. Mr. President, John C. Stennis was a great American. He was a dedicated Senator who proudly represented the people of Mississippi with great distinction. We have lost a colleague, we have lost a leader; but most of all, we have lost a friend. Tuesday, April 25, 1995. Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to discuss the life and career of Senator John C. Stennis, who passed away earlier this week. Senator Stennis served in this Chamber for 41 years. His work here included serving as chairman of the Senate Armed Services and the Senate Appropriations Committees and as President Pro Tempore of this body. Among his legislative achievements was his ability to bend and flow with the times. Once a staunch segregationist, Senator Stennis cast his vote for the Voting Rights Act of 1982. One area in which he never changed, however, was in upholding the safety and security of this great country. Senator Stennis warned against overextending our military capacity. He also warned against wasteful defense spending. But he never wavered in his support of the country's national defense and ensuring that it maintained the military capacity to guarantee our freedoms and our liberties. During his four decades in the U.S. Senate, Senator Stennis was always an abiding example of integrity and fortitude. His respect for the institution of the Senate and the law of the United States made him an early opponent of the excesses and abuses of Senator Joe McCarthy. As a result, he and Senator Sam Ervin were named as the two Democratic members on the Watkins committee that investigated the recklessness of Senator McCarthy and led to his censorship. In July 1965, the Senate created the Select Committee on Standards and Conduct, the forerunner of our current Select Committee on Ethics. This was a controversial creation, and everyone knew that whoever chaired it would be in a difficult position. The Senate had traditionally relied upon the voters of a State to discipline a Senator for improper behavior, and institutional discipline is a painful problem in an institution that depends on the collegiality of its Members. The only logical choice for this important and difficult leadership position was Senator Stennis. The Mississippi Senator became so successful; and so respected in this position that the committee quickly became known as the ``Stennis Committee.'' Mr. President, the career of Senator John C. Stennis was marked, not only with legislative triumphs, but with numerous personal triumphs over personal adversity. In 1973, he was shot by robbers in front of his house and left for dead. In 1983, his beloved wife of 52 years, Coy Hines Stennis passed away. In 1984, a battle with cancer resulted in the loss of one of his legs and confined him to a wheelchair. While in the hospital recuperating from the surgery, he was visited by the President of the United States, Ronald Reagan. President Reagan later said that he had dreaded going to the hospital that day, for he feared the impact such a life-altering operation would have on a fiercely independent man like Senator Stennis. But the President explained, ``when I left, it was I who had been strengthened.'' He had been strengthened by the Senator's confidence, his faith, and his optimism. Those qualities defined Senator Stennis' outlook on life. On his Senate desk he kept a plaque that simply read: ``Look Ahead.'' ``That's my philosophy,'' he explained. Don't waste time lamenting the past. ``You have got to look ahead. I realize that life's not altogether what you make it. But that's part of it, what you make it yourself.'' Senator Stennis made for himself a wonderful life, and the Senate and the country can be grateful for it. When he retired from the Senate in January 1989, Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd called it ``the end of an era.'' And indeed it was. Perhaps a greater compliment came from a Republican Member of Congress from Mississippi, who said, ``We'll miss him. Even if he's a Democrat, he's a great man.'' As the Senate Democratic leader, I say that is a great statement, even from a Republican. In 1988, Congress established the John C. Stennis Center for Public Service Training at Mississippi State University. The center covers a range of historical projects, including an excellent oral history program. When a congressional historian approached him about an oral history of his own life and career, Senator Stennis initially opposed the idea, saying it would be too self- aggrandizing. The historian proceeded to explain that it was not only an honor, it was his duty to record for posterity his personal account of the historic events and decisions in which he had been involved. ``Well, sir,'' responded Senator Stennis, ``If you say its my duty, then I must do it, because I've always done my duty.'' It was not only his legislative accomplishments--and they were many--for which we so loved and remember him, it was also his commitment to God and country. No person who has ever served in the U.S. Senate was ever quicker to tell you what was wrong with this country. But no person was ever quicker to tell you what was right about it, either. Mr. President, Linda and I extend our most heartfelt condolences to the family of John C. Stennis: We share their grief and their loss. But we also thank them for sharing him with us, and I thank the people of Mississippi for selecting him to serve in the Senate for seven terms. Mr. President, I yield the floor. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President once again, the silver cord has been loosened and the golden bowl has been broken: ``Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.'' These words from Ecclesiastes--spoken probably ten centuries before the birth of Christ-bare the indelible stamp of permanency. Somewhere, every day, every hour, every minute, they are brought home to someone, and in their train, follow the inevitable pain and sorrow and tears, that we all must bear when loved ones and friends depart from us in this earthly life. The angel of death is no respecter of persons, and each of us will one day hear the beating of his wings-- Leaves have their time to fall, And flowers to wither at the north wind's breath, And stars to set-but all, Thou has all seasons for thine own, O Death! Mr. President, it was with sorrow that I heard the sad news over the past weekend that our former colleague and friend, John Cornelius Stennis, had passed away at the age of 93. When I came to the United States Senate in January 1959, John Stennis was a Member of this body, and we served together 30 years--until he retired at the close of the 100th Congress in 1989. So, it is with sadness that I pay tribute to the memory of this departed colleague today. As we grow older, we are obliged to bid farewell to some friend almost every day, and thus does the circle gradually, and all too rapidly, diminish; for-- There is no union here of hearts That finds not here an end. Mr. President, John Stennis was a man who achieved greatly in life. For 41 years and 2 months, he represented a great and patriotic constituency in this Chamber, where some of the greatest men of the Republic have served and aspired to serve, and that achievement alone would mark him as a man among men. When we add to this the fact that he served as a member of the Mississippi State House of Representatives for 4 years, as district prosecuting attorney from 1932 to 1937, and as a circuit judge from 1937 to 1947, we begin to realize what a wonderful career we are remembering today--60 years in the public service-- in elective positions, where neighbors and friends, who are often more critical than strangers, are the electors! What more could be said by way of eulogy? Volumes could be written and less said. Yet, that is the record of our former colleague and friend, who, in the merciful dispensations of an all-wise Providence, has now passed on to the other side. John Cornelius Stennis was born near DeKalb, Kemper County, MS, on August 3, 1901. He attended the county schools; graduated from the Mississippi State College in 1923, and graduated from the University of Virginia Law School in 1928. He was admitted to the bar in 1928 and commenced practice in his home town of DeKalb. I had the honor of serving on the Armed Services Committee and on the Appropriations Committee with Senator Stennis, both of which committees he had served as chairman before his voluntary retirement at the close of the 100th Congress. John Stennis was an honest man, and he was a good man, as good men go in this life--plain and modest. He was amiable, courteous, and courtly--a southern Christian gentleman, in every sense of the word. He was intellectually honest, a man of great moral rectitude, simply in his habits, and completely devoid of hypocrisy. He was a Senator who loved the Senate and who was dedicated to its traditions. He was conscious at all times, of the great trust confided in him by the people he represented, and he carried in his heart a great reverence for this institution and for the Constitution of our country. His was a steady hand, an upright character. He was a man of justice and fairness to all. He was unassuming in his manner, sincere and firm in his convictions. Devoid of envy, he was ambitious only to serve the cause of justice and humanity, and being of, for, and from the people, he gave his life to their service. In him, the great people of Mississippi had an ever faithful friend and servant. Mr. President, John Stennis was not a large man physically. He was actually rather slight. But he was a giant. The breadth of his character was huge, and the steel of his courage was formidable. Nothing defeated him--not the bruises of the legislative battlefield; not the frightful attack by thugs in the street, who almost caused his death, near his home; not the death of his beloved wife; not the loss of his leg to cancer. Nothing defeated him. Nothing held him down for long. He always got up again and went on. He struggled, but he prevailed and endured. And he did it all with a quiet, unassuming dignity. He was courtly--ever the gentleman. I called him a Senator's Senator. He represented everything fine about the Senate and everything fine about the human spirit. He was the cream of all things decent that one looks for in a leader and in a man. Had he lived in another age he would have been just as great, as respected, as beloved, and as revered as he has been in his own time. He would have enhanced any company in any situation in any age. But most of all, the indomitable fortitude stands out. There is a courage possessed by some men which is extraordinary--far beyond what most individuals can ever muster in even their best and bravest moments. It is rarely accompanied by bombast and breast beating. It is carried with a quiet and calm demeanor. No outward show is necessary. In his case, the kindly visage gave no clue to the inner steel. He bore his duties and his crises, his joys and his sorrows, with equal dignity. But it was awesome actually to watch. How many times have I come to this Chamber for a vote, bone-weary, and at some dreadful hour in the morning, and seen him sitting straight as an arrow at his desk! There he would be, 17 years my senior, frail, missing one leg, with a pleasant greeting for all, in spite of the hour. In this age of clock-watching, and quality-of-life avocation, that kind of dedication may seem an anachronism. But John Stennis was dedication and duty epitomized in the human flesh. He showed us by his example. He never lectured, never said, ``Do as I do.'' He just lived an exemplary life, and that was enough to teach all who were fortunate enough to be around to learn. He taught us how to be Senators, he taught us how to bear sadness and brutality without bitterness or surrender or despair. He did so by just being what he was. Mr. President, all that even the greatest of scientists can do is to try to interpret and apply the laws, the immutable laws, the eternal laws of God. Scientists cannot create matter and they cannot create life. They can mold and develop and shape and use them, but they cannot call them into being. They are compelled to admit the truth of the old nursery rhyme, which I am sure the Presiding Officer and the other distinguished Senator from Oklahoma will remember along with me: Nor you, nor I, nor anybody knows, how oats, peas, beans, and barley grows. But the Scriptures tell us of the laws of God, and reveal to us the Source from whence this Earth, the universe, and all of us who dwell here--for a split second, as it were--between two eternities: ``In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth.'' The Scriptures also reveal to us that God created man from the dust of the ground, and ``breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living soul.'' God then gave Adam a helpmate, Eve, and from those ancient parents, we have all descended, and from them, we have all inherited death. Only a Milton could so incisively provide a fitting epilogue to man's fall from grace. They, looking back, all the eastern side beheld of Paradise, so late their happy seat, waved over by that flaming brand; the gate with dreadful faces thronged and fiery arms. Some natural tears they dropped, but wiped them soon; the world was all before them where to choose their place of rest, and Providence their guide. They, hand in hand, with wondering steps and slow, through Eden took their solitary way. As so, it is our inevitable lot to die. But the Scriptures also tell us that we may live again in that long lost paradise from whence our parents came. There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name appears in extra- Biblical texts as early as 2000 years before Christ. His name was Job, and from his patient, suffering lips came the age-old question, ``If a man die, shall he live again'', and later from his lips came the answer to his own question: ``Oh, that my words were written and engraved with an iron pen upon a ledge of rock forever, for I know that my Redeemer liveth and some day He shall stand upon the earth; and though after my skin worms destroy this Body, yet, in my flesh shall I see God; whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another.'' Mr. President, many years ago I read a story of an old Anglo-Saxon king who had his barons at a great banquet. They were eating their venison and quaffing their ale. It was a bitter night outside. The storm raged. The snow was falling thick and fast. Suddenly, into the rude chamber in which they were gathered, there flew through some crack or crevice in the roof a little bird. Blinded by the light and perplexed, it flew wildly here and there and beat itself against the rude beams. Finally, it found another crevice and out it went again into the night. The king, advanced in years, spoke to his barons and said, That bird is like a life; it comes from out of the night. It flits and flies around a little while, blinded by the light, and then it goes back out into the night again. Mr. President, as we witness the passing of a great and good man like John Stennis, we may well take appraisal of our own public and private merits and remember that we, too, only flit about for a little while, our voices resound in this Chamber for a few days or months or years, and then we are gone. These things are evanescent. Real substantial qualities of honesty, integrity, gentleness, modesty, and generosity will make the life of John Stennis remembered when much of what we say and do here in this Chamber shall have passed away and perished. John Stennis is gone. . . . with your skysail set For ports beyond the margin of the stars . . . And those of us who had the honor and privilege of serving with him may say of him: His life was gentle, and the elements so mixed in him that Nature might stand up and say to all the world, ``This was a man.'' To the family and friends of John Cornelius Stennis, my wife Erma and I extend our deepest sympathy. I saw the sun sink in the golden west, No angry cloud obscured its latest ray. Around the couch on which it sank to rest Shone all the splendor of a summer day. And long, though lost to view, that radiant light, Reflected from the sky, delayed the night. Thus, when a good man's life comes to a close, No doubts arise to cloud his soul with gloom. But faith triumphant on each feature glows, And benedictions fill the sacred room. And long do men his virtues wide proclaim, While generations rise to bless his name. Mr. President, I yield the floor. Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to compliment my friend and colleague, Senator Byrd, for the tribute to our colleague, Senator Stennis, who served in this body so ably, so well, for so long. His service of 41 years--only the Senator from West Virginia would know who has exceeded that besides Senator Hayden, I guess--but he had a remarkable tenure in the Senate. I had the pleasure of serving with Senator Stennis. He was a person that had enormous credibility and reputation prior to my coming to the Senate going back for many years. He was even referred to in the Senate as a person known as the ethical watch guard of the Senate, and certainly a Southern gentleman in every single way. He was a real asset to this body, certainly to the State of Mississippi and to our country, as well. We shall all miss him, but not forget the contributions that he made to his State and country. I compliment my colleague from West Virginia for a beautiful tribute to a wonderful colleague and Senator. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my friend. Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I first want to commend the distinguished Democratic leader for his comments about our departed colleague and my good friend, Senator John C. Stennis. Today, there was a very appropriate editorial published in the Clarion-Ledger, in Jackson, Mississippi, describing the effect that Senator Stennis had, by virtue of his service in the Senate, on the State of Mississippi. I commend the editor for such a fine article and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From the Clarion-Ledger, April 25, 1995] John C. Stennis: Integrity Set Standard for Congress The accomplishments of former U.S. Senator John C. Stennis could fill pages. Stennis' long and full life ended Sunday at age 93, and during the next few days, Mississippians will hear many of the Senator's accomplishments recounted. His long and distinguished career in government left his mark on many of the policies of the United States, especially in military matters. There are many institutions that bear his name, even an aircraft carrier. Mississippi is a much different place, and a much better place, because of the policies and economic development projects he brought to the state. But, all of the political achievements, the things that most politicians are measured by, fall short when it comes to Senator Stennis. Stennis was, above all else, a man of integrity, a true statesman, whose adherence to honor and code of conduct made him legendary in the U.S. Senate, which he loved so dearly. That is indeed a rare quality, especially in the mean- spirited politics of today. Senator Stennis' reputation for fairness made him a trusted colleague and confidant of Presidents of both parties. He was known as the ``conscience of the Senate'' because of his high ethical standards and respect for the institution. Throughout his long career, integrity and service were watchwords. It is appropriate that, of the institutions that bear his name, the Stennis Center for Public Service at Mississippi State University seeks to encourage young people to public service careers. In his 1947 campaign, Stennis stated a simple creed: ``I want to plow a straight furrow right down to the end of my row.'' Senator John C. Stennis succeeded with that pledge. Mr. President, I want to invite the attention of the Senate to a couple of points that are made in this fine tribute. After talking about many of the things that Senator Stennis did for the State the editorial writer then says: But, all of the political achievements, the things that most politicians are measured by, fall short when it comes to Senator Stennis. Stennis was, above all else, a man of integrity, a true statesman, whose adherence to honor and code of conduct made him legendary in the U.S. Senate, which he loved so dearly. Mr. President, as I was beginning to think about putting this in the Record for the information of Senators, I realized that I sit at the desk that was occupied by Senator Stennis during the time he served in the Senate. As you know, there is a tradition here to put your name in the desk drawer like schoolboys used to. Senator Stennis' name is in this desk drawer which he wrote in there and put the date that he began service, 1947, and a dash, and never did, of course, put the date on which his service ended, which the distinguished Democratic leader pointed out was in 1989. One other aspect of this desk is that not only has it been occupied by many Mississippians over the years, Jefferson Davis, to name one, John Sharp Williams, a very distinguished Senator who had served as Democratic leader in the House before he was elected to the Senate, and then served three terms in the Senate and probably was one of the most respected national figures of his day serving in the Congress. And serving from Mississippi it made our State very proud. But Senator Stennis occupied this desk from 1947--well over 41 years, as the Senators know. But toward the end of his career he lost a leg to cancer, and this desk was located in the rear of the Chamber. So his wheelchair could move right up to the desk. But he never failed to rise and address the Senate even though he was confined to the wheelchair and had only one leg. He had the carpenters put a special place here where a bar could be fitted. There are two holes carved for wooden inserts in this desk to hold that bar. And the bar would rest inside the desk. Most Senators put the rule books of the Senate and a couple of other reference books in the top of their desk. But that had simply a bar there. He would put it there and pull himself up, and with that one leg stand erect to address the Senate because he respected the institution so much, its traditions, and its customs, always pointing out to other Senators that we should be in order; and having a tremendous influence because of his presence in this body. The Senate is much better off because of his service here. The State of Mississippi is truly blessed to have been the State represented in the U.S. Senate by John C. Stennis. Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I would like to speak for a few minutes this evening on a subject close to my heart, and that is the memory of our former colleague, John C. Stennis, who passed away on Sunday, April 23, at the age of 93. Senator Stennis served in this body for over 41 years, from 1947 to 1989. For a long number of years, as I was growing up and following the activities of the Congress of the United States, Senator Stennis was one of my heroes, and that was long before I came to U.S. Senate. John Stennis personified for me the image of what a Senator should be, and that image inspired me as I considered whether to seek a seat in the U.S. Senate in the 1972 election. From my first days in the Senate, John Stennis was a patient mentor, a strong and valuable colleague, and a cherished friend. It has been said that ``Great men are like eagles, they do not flock together. You find them one at a time, soaring alone, using their skills and strengths to reach new heights and to seek new horizons.'' Such an eagle was John Stennis. John Stennis was a Senator's Senator. He was gentle and courteous in conduct, but tough and strong in conviction and in character. He was a man of singular purpose and broad vision--yet he was sensitive, very sensitive, to the needs and the wishes of others. John Stennis personified the highest ideals of honor and integrity within the U.S. Senate. Members of the Senate from both parties and from widely divergent philosophical points of view treasured his steadfast leadership, his fearless courage, his kindness toward others, his unselfish devotion to public service, his love and respect for the U.S. Senate, the Congress, his reverence for the U.S. Constitution, and his unshakable faith in God. Senator Stennis was an outstanding lawyer and judge before he came to the Senate, and his judicial temperament marked every aspect of his Senate service. Time after time, the Senate turned to him to address the most difficult and divisive issues, such as the conduct of Senator Joseph McCarthy. When the Senate established the first Select Committee on Standards and Conduct, which was the predecessor of the Ethics Committee, it was only natural that Senator Stennis was selected as the first chairman. From 1961 to 1981, he served as chairman of the Armed Services Committee. As chairman, he set a standard that all of his successors strive to meet. He was a man of conviction, strong, moral character, and absolute and total courage. Despite much adversity--a life-threatening gunshot wound in 1973, right after I came to the Senate that tragedy happened, also the loss in 1983 of his beloved wife, Miss Coy, and the challenges of serious operations in later years, through all of that he served the people of Mississippi and the people of this Nation with courage and with strength. Chairman Stennis was the Senate's preeminent authority on military affairs. His career spanned the period of the cold war. He came to the Senate in 1947, the year the Marshall plan was announced. He left in 1989, the year the Berlin Wall came down. He played a very large role in those events and all the events in between. He had guided this body through the difficult years of the post-Vietnam era and through the subsequent revitalization of America's Armed Forces. Senator Stennis consistently supported a strong national defense even in times when it was not popular to do so. I recall clearly the first few years after I came to the Senate in the early 1970's, when virtually all defense programs were being challenged one after another on the Senate floor. Senator Stennis remained in the Chamber steadfast for hours and weeks and sometimes even months while the bill was pending in the Senate, making the case for maintaining a strong defense for our Nation. At the same time, Senator Stennis was downright intolerant of wasted and misspent dollars, and he consistently opposed those who simply wanted to write a Pentagon blank check. Senator Stennis remembered well the lessons of pre-World War II isolationism and he constantly opposed the recurring isolationist impulse, especially during the difficult post-Vietnam years. He was a rock of support for NATO at a time when there was strong opposition in the country to foreign military alliances. One of the first assignments he gave me when I got to the Senate was going to NATO and coming back and reporting to him on what I found there. Yet he remained skeptical of excessive military involvement overseas and he expressed great concern about the plans for intervention in Vietnam before that intervention occurred. Once the Nation was committed to war, however, he always believed that American forces should be provided with the means necessary and the backing to accomplish the objectives assigned to them. It was my privilege to serve with him since coming to the Senate in 1973 until he left in 1989. He was my friend. He was my mentor. He remained my hero. I will miss him, and I will miss his sound advice and wise judgment. During my first campaign for the Senate in 1972, I came to Washington to meet with Senator Stennis. This was before I was elected in November but after I had won the Democratic primary. I told him of my strong interest in military affairs, and I asked for his support in obtaining a seat on the Armed Services Committee if I should be elected. I will always be grateful for his assurances of support and his assistance once I arrived, and certainly all of that played a very important part in my Senate career. With his support, I obtained a seat on the Committee on Armed Services, and I promptly sought his advice on how I should fulfill my duties. He told me, and I recall it well, that the best way to learn about the Defense Department and the military services was to deal directly and extensively with the men and women in uniform as well as the civilian employees of the Department of Defense. He encouraged me to listen to their advice and understand their point of view, to remain open and objective but always to at least listen. He appointed me to be the chairman of the newly created Manpower and Personnel Subcommittee which gave me the opportunity to follow his advice in a great number of details and with considerable amount of time. Over the years, I listened to and learned from Senator Stennis as we debated the great issues of national security and other national affairs that faced our country in the 1970's and 1980's, and the lessons learned then still apply almost every day in the Senate in the 1990's. It was a marvelous education in the ways of the Senate, the conduct of national security affairs and the Constitution of the United States. In 1987, Senator Stennis became chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and I became chairman of the Armed Services Committee. It was my good fortune to have him continue to sit on that committee, to be able to begin my chairmanship with Senator Stennis at my side, because I frequently consulted with him and benefited from his advice on the problems and issues that arose under the jurisdiction of the Armed Services Committee as well as many other matters that came to the floor of the Senate. When Senator Stennis first came to this body, he said in his classic direct style, ``I wish to plow a straight furrow right down to the end of my row.'' There is no doubt he did exactly that. Senator Stennis grew up on a farm and he knew how difficult it was to plow a straight furrow with a mule. You cannot plow a straight line to your immediate goal or mark a stake in the field unless you keep your eye on the distant point that establishes your sight line. That is the way John Stennis lived. He staked out his immediate goals, but he always kept his eye on the distant goal, the values and principles that enabled him to plow a straight furrow right to the end of the row. Mr. President, I also remember well his advice to me when I came to the Senate. I hope I never will forget this. He said, ``Sam, some new Senators grow and some simply swell. Make sure you continue to grow.'' Mr. President, no higher honor has come my way than serving in the Senate with John Stennis. When he retired a few years back, I said then it was hard for me to imagine the Senate without John Stennis at his desk. It is now hard for me to imagine the Nation without the benefit of his talent, counsel, and his sterling example. We will miss him. We will all miss him. But his legacy of integrity and devoted service to the country will inspire the Senate and the Nation and young people particularly for generations to come. Mr. President, Colleen, my wife, and I extend our sympathies to his son, John Hampton Stennis, his daughter, Mrs. Margaret Stennis Womble, and to all of his grandchildren and great grandchildren, indeed, to all of his family and his friends, and we thank the people of Mississippi for sending this giant to the Senate for the number of years that he served. The people of Mississippi and the people of this Nation can be very proud of Senator Stennis. He will be remembered in history as one of the giants of the Senate. As long as there is a Senate, John Stennis will be remembered for his service, for his integrity, and for his character. I thank the Chair. Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I wish to pay honor today to one of the great Senators of this century, John Cornelius Stennis. His roots began at the turn of the century as a young farmboy, in the fertile soil of Kemper County, MS. And while his subsequent career was to take him to far away places, and to positions of great honor in our Nation's Government, his beloved home country was never far from his mind. Second only to service to his Nation, his dedication to the State of Mississippi was legendary. He had amassed a distinguished record of public service, even before coming to the Senate in 1947. A Phi Betta Kappa law school graduate, he served as a State Representative, district attorney, and State circuit court judge. But it was here in the Senate where we shall best remember him. For more than 42 years, this Nation had the benefit of his wisdom and his guidance. He was the epitome of a Southern gentleman, and fairness and integrity were constants in his conduct. It was no mere happenstance that he was our first chairman of the Select Committee on Standards and Conduct. He was for decades the foremost guardian of our Nation's defense, forcefully and relentlessly pursuing strong defense programs throughout the Cold War years. His credentials as ``Mr. Defense'' made even more remarkable his misgivings and warnings to the Nation on involvement in combat in Vietnam, and he was a major author of our first war powers legislation. Chairman of Armed Services, chairman of Appropriations, President Pro Tempore--his achievements here on this floor and in this body have been equaled by few. And who among us who knew him will ever forget his quiet courage? He quietly brushed aside the impacts of being shot and robbed while walking home. Years later, after loosing a leg to cancer, he refused to yield to adversity--always rising to address this body, exuding dignity and determination with every action. John Stennis was a patriot--a statesman--a Senator in the finest traditions of the word. He was one of the great lions of our assembly, and we will miss him. I read today where he once responded to a question about how he would like to be remembered. He said he hoped that one could say of him that ``He did his best.'' Well, that he did. And his best will serve as a reminder and a standard to all of us, for generations to come. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Georgia has touched on it when he said I wish to hoe a straight furrow right down the field, that was John Stennis. I can hear him now. He had those sayings about not swelling but growing in experience. The reverence and respect at that particular time was for Senators listening and learning and profiting from experience. Now the pledge is when you come to town you are not going to listen to anybody; you have a contract. You are going to vote for it. And by the way, do not give me any of your experience because in 6 years I am gone. It is an entirely different atmosphere. And when you see, as the Senator from Georgia has said in such eloquent terms, one of the finest, I am just deeply moved. John Stennis and I became very close amid serving on committees together, particularly the Appropriations Committee later on. But his family--the Peden clan--was from Fountain Inn, South Carolina, where Mr. Quillen was born along with other persons of eminence. Invariably he would come back to South Carolina for the annual Peden clan reunion. I figured, like the Senator from Georgia, that he was my sort of patron and leader. I listened to him many a time. I can tell you this. John Stennis was a man of this institution. We have Senator Byrd, who really reveres the Senate as an institution. John Stennis revered the U.S. Senate as an institution. And as much as we liked each other and as close friends as we were, when I was chairman of the Budget Committee, he followed it very, very closely. When I was chairman back in 1980, he would say, ``Fritz, you're right. We have to somehow pay our bills. We are eating our seed corn.'' He would make a little talk on the floor, not only with respect to military affairs, with tremendous authority, but with respect to fiscal matters. And later on, when I was not the chairman of the committee, but I talked to him and tried to get a vote with respect to that budget, he would say, ``I'm sticking with the chairman.'' I know how you feel about this, but we have got to stay with the chairman.'' I can hear him now. He was an institution man. And that says a lot for the stability of the body and the courtesy here and the ethics that we have. He set the highest standard of anybody I have ever known. I will never forget the afternoon he was shot. Invariably, we would get together down at the gym there at this time, 6:30 going on 7 o'clock, and get a workout. He said, ``You've got to try to keep up with Strom.'' That is my senior Senator. He said, ``You will find if you stay in good physical shape, you will be able to keep up with Strom.'' We would work out. They had this wheel that you get down on your knees and you go forward and pull it backward and forward, and everything else. He was on that wheel the afternoon he was shot. He left, if I remember correctly, about 6:15 and he was shot about 6:30 or 6:45. He later related, when I went to see him, he said: ``You know, I'm lucky. These fellows told me they wanted money and I did not have any money. And I said, ``Take my watch, anything else, my ring.'' And they cursed him and just fired five shots into his middle, his stomach, pancreas, and lungs--his insides. He walked up to his house and talked to Miss Coy, Mrs. Stennis, his wife. He said, ``Call an ambulance and call Walter Reed.'' The ambulance came. And as they lifted him up, he remembered well hearing the chief of police, who had reached the home at that time, saying, ``All right, take him over to George Washington Hospital.'' He raised up on that stretcher--the last he ever remembered, he said, prior to coming to some 9 hours later--and said, ``Take me to Walter Reed. They are waiting for me there.'' He said that was the real fortunate part, because when he got to Walter Reed, they had two Army surgeons who had finished a 2-week lecture course to the Army surgeons around the country on bullet wounds and shrapnel wounds and battlefield surgery and that kind of thing, particularly with respect to the loss of blood. His operation took 9 hours. I will never forget him saying that. He said, ``Had they not had that hard experience of when to stop and replenish and when to move forward . . .'' They had to sew up all his innards or he would have been long since gone. He came back and, as Senator Nunn points out, he did not slow down at all. Later, when the cancer got his legs, he did not. As Senator Cochran pointed out--who sits at the Stennis desk--he believed in this institution. He attended regularly all the sessions. He attended these debates. I think television has ruined us all. Perhaps some would listen back in their offices. But you do not have the open exchange in the most deliberative body. You are here and get quips that staff gives you. They have prepared remarks and they run out and the Record is full and it appears it is a deliberative effort. Not at all. Senator Stennis did not like that, and he said so. He attended the debates. He attended all the votes and he kept going until the very, very end. Unfortunately, he was not as conscious and alert as he could have been the last few years. I wanted to go to see him, but my staff who worked intimately with him on the Armed Services Committee and later on the Appropriations Committee, said that, ``Poor John would not recognize you right now.'' So he has gone to his just reward after the most distinguished career in the U.S. Senate of over 41 years. He was a Senator's Senator if there ever was one in this body. He was not only, as pointed out, an outstanding authority on military affairs, but he had that fundamental feel of paying the bills and being straightforward in his treatment here with all the Senators and setting the highest standard of ethical conduct that you could possibly imagine. We need that inspiration today that, unfortunately, we do not have. We are all going to miss him very, very badly. I am sorry tomorrow I cannot be at the session relative to the continued debate on product liability. I want to attend those services. But we will be back here at 4:45. But it is good that we have those who have served with him and remember him so well that will be there and be with his family. His daughter retired first in Charleston, where her husband was the dean at the College of Charleston and later up in Greenville, South Carolina. So I am looking forward to seeing that family. But I will never forget the inspiration he has given for all of us who have served with him to continue to serve. Wednesday, April 26, 1995. Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Senate Resolution 111, submitted earlier today by Senators Dole, Daschle, Cochran, and Lott. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The legislative clerk read as follows: A resolution (S. Res. 111) relative to the death of the Honorable John C. Stennis, late a Senator from the State of Mississippi. The Senate proceeded to consider the resolution. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the resolution is considered and agreed to. So the resolution (S. Res. 111) was agreed to, as follows: S. Res. Resolved, That the Senate has heard with profound sorrow and deep regret the announcement of the death of the Honorable John C. Stennis, late a Senator from the State of Mississippi. Resolved, That the Secretary communicate these resolutions to the House of Representatives and transmit an enrolled copy thereof to the family of the deceased. Resolved, That when the Senate recesses today, it recess as a further mark of respect to the memory of the deceased Senator. Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the resolution was agreed to. Mr. FORD. I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. Thursday, April 27, 1995. Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, Senator John Stennis will long be remembered as the ``conscience of the Senate'' for his personal religious convictions and his many years of work on the Senate code of ethics. I will always think of him as a friend, and as one of the most effective chairmen of the Defense Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee. We shared many of the same beliefs in that the United States should always strive for the most effective Armed Forces in the world, and his leadership was always deserving of respect and admiration. Despite physical ailments and the death of his beloved wife of 52 years, Senator Stennis remained committed to this body and to his countrymen. He could always be found in his offices, never leaving until the Senate had adjourned for the day. He never gave up when he believed that he was right. We need men and women who will fight for what they believe, and we should look to John Stennis as an excellent example of the forthrightness and dedication necessary to be effective leaders today. Since Senator Stennis retired from this body in 1989, the Senate has been denied his wisdom and his leadership. Our entire country mourns his loss. Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask Unanimous consent that all Senators have until the close of business on May 10, 1995, to submit eulogies for our former colleague, the Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Stennis, and that at that time eulogies be printed as a Senate document. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Tuesday, May 2, 1995. Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it was my honor, a unique honor and special pleasure to serve in this body as the State colleague of John C. Stennis for 10 years. I deeply appreciated the bond of friendship, respect and trust that developed between us as we worked together to represent the interests of the State of Mississippi, and its citizens, in the U.S. Senate. He had already established a reputation for intelligent leadership in this body when I arrived here, and I considered it my good fortune to be able to learn first hand from him and from his example. We were never rivals. We talked almost every day. He was always friendly and courteous to me, as he was with every other Senator. Although we were members of different political parties, that did not interfere with or detract from our relationship. Our State has had its share of demagogues, as all other States have, and I have deplored their excesses and have been embarrassed by them. But in Senator Stennis we saw a man as pure in heart and deed with less inclination to inflame the passions of the voters with exaggerated and flamboyant rhetoric as any we have ever elected to public office, and I admired him for that. He preferred to win a debate or an election on the basis of the well argued evidence, rather than to prey upon the fears or suspicions or prejudices of the audience. He was the kind of Senator I try to be. During his more than 41 years of service as a U.S. Senator, he was steady, conscientious and extraordinarily successful in every assignment and undertaking. From his earliest days to his last days he gave the full measure of energy and his ability to the service of this body and to his State. He saw that as his duty, and he took that as seriously as anyone who has ever served here. Others have recalled in their speeches the positions of responsibility he held and the legislation he authored and caused to be adopted. There were many of each, and they are persuasive testimony to his effectiveness as a Senator. I will not try to recount all of them. What may not be as easily measured is the influence he had in the Senate by the force of his character. He was the epitome of rectitude, of fairness, of decorum. His selection to be the first chairman of the Senate's Select Committee on Standards and Conduct was an illustration of the view that others in the body had of him, and the confidence they had in him to do what was right and just. That is why he was so admired and appreciated in Mississippi. He got things done that helped our State, and its people, but he was more than an effective Senator. He was totally honest and trustworthy. Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I join with my colleagues today in remembering a man who embodied the U.S. Senate perhaps better than anyone, Senator John C. Stennis. Known as a Senator's Senator and the conscience of the institution, his presence for 41 years in the Senate was formidable, yet comforting and reassuring. While his departure represents the passing of an era and is cause for our grief, it is also certainly cause to rejoice, for our friend is no doubt experiencing the rewards of a faithful heart and humble service. The legacy he leaves is one defined by his strength, integrity, and compassion. Growing up in rural Mississippi, John Cornelius Stennis learned the lessons that would last him a lifetime. Such lessons molded a man whose southern courtesy would become a mark of dignity and distinction. After receiving a law degree from the University of Virginia in 1927, young John Stennis spent 19 full years serving first as a State representative, then district prosecuting attorney and finally a circuit judge before being elected to the U.S. Senate in 1947. Much in the same manner Senator Stennis took so many of us under his wing, upon his arrival in the Senate, it was Senator Richard B. Russell who mentored the like-minded Mississippian. Soon, Senator Stennis' sharp mind and unmatched work ethic earned him seats on the powerful Armed Services and Appropriations Committees. As chairman of the new Armed Services Preparedness Subcommittee, Senator Stennis became a watchdog for the Department of Defense and the armed services. His fair investigations and scrutiny of these organizations quickly secured him a reputation which would never be tarnished: He was analytical, critical, and he held unwavering convictions. The impact John Stennis had over this 41 years in the U.S. Senate surpasses description. Early in his Senate career he courageously spoke against McCarthyism. While assuring America would have the strongest and most capable military on the planet, he demanded accountability for each defense dollar spent. While always standing by his commitment to a strong military, he also began to see the growing danger of our Federal deficit and supported necessary defense budget cutbacks. A consummate professional, Chairman Stennis commented more than once that his work was his play. Indeed, the joy with which he carried out our Nation's business was contagious-our Senator's Senator was humorous and likable, a role model to Members on both sides of the aisle. The trials Senator Stennis experienced during his sunset years in the U.S. Senate are almost unthinkable. He was shot twice by a burglar in 1973, but he returned to the work of the Senate; he lost his wife of 50 years in 1983, but he returned to the work of the Senate; and he lost a leg to cancer in 1984, but again he returned to the work of the Senate. Through all this, Senator Stennis remained a commanding presence. As the distinguished senior Senator from Virginia once put it, Senator Stennis ``. . . had a great spiritual reservoir that came to his rescue and served as a solid, strong, foundation for him.'' Well, the spiritual reservoir overflowed and served as a solid and strong foundation for the rest of us as well. To more than one Senator, John C. Stennis was more than a colleague, even more than a mentor. Indeed, I am not the only Senator still in this body who would call Senator Stennis a father figure--a figure worthy of our respect and deserving of our love. As long as he was in the Senate, I was his student--especially on the Appropriations Committee. Even when serving as chairman it was his counsel and leadership, his spirit and presence which guided me through the many hours of committee sessions and floor deliberations. To Senator John C. Stennis I owe a debt of gratitude that is both professional and personal. Seeing his patient and humble years presiding as chairman and as President Pro Tempore brought me peace of mind as I struggled through the difficult periods of my own service. And what would Senator Stennis' response to this tribute be? Well, about 7 years ago, upon his retirement, he remarked that he ``. . . was just trying to do what looked like to be the duty and keep it up the best he could.'' He certainly did, and much, much more. In the Book of Ezekiel, the third chapter, God declares the Prophet to be a watchman over the house of Israel. Ezekiel is commanded to warn the rebellious Israelities of God's impending judgment. Well, for the past several decades, John Cornelius Stennis has been our watchman. He has always cared for, and often admonished, a dignified yet sometimes unruly body of U.S. Senators. He has and will continue to represent the history of this body, to represent the integrity of this body and to represent the stature of this body. For his years of service, leadership, and friendship, I am eternally grateful. Wednesday, May 3, 1995. Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I would like to add my voice to those which have already lamented the passing of our dear former colleague from Mississippi, John Stennis. About 25 of us went down to Mississippi last week to his funeral to say goodbye to one of the true giants in the history of this institution. I recall about 10 years ago, some Senators, including myself, went to Senator Stennis' hometown of DeKalb, Mississippi, where the people of DeKalb and surrounding areas had gathered to help celebrate his birthday. There was a great outpouring of love and genuine affection from friends and neighbors who had known him, his father, and others before him. No one really knows an individual in the same way that the people of his hometown do, and you could see that as they came together that day. There was an authentic feeling of closeness and friendship. DeKalb is a small community, probably, smaller than the one I come from. The people there--the salt of the earth-- knew their favorite son, John Stennis, for his character and integrity. The great outpouring of affection which was on display that day was the best evidence anyone ever needed of his graciousness, honesty, decency, and dedication to principle. All of us there could see that he stood very tall with those who knew him best. John Stennis and I had much in common, both of us from southern families that go back for many generations. I used to enjoy the stories he would tell about his early years and how his father would raise cotton, transport it over to Alabama, and ship it down the river to Mobile. We were both judges at one time, which gave us a unique perspective on government, individuals, and human nature in general. John Cornelius Stennis was born on August 3, 1901, in Kemper County, in the red clay hills of eastern Mississippi. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from what is now Mississippi State University in 1923 and 4 years later, received his law degree from the University of Virginia. Just 1 year later, he was elected to the Mississippi Legislature. He later went on to serve as a district prosecuting attorney and circuit judge. After 10 years on the bench, he ran in 1947 for the Senate seat held by the flamboyant Senator Theodore G. Bilbo and was elected over five opponents in November. His campaign theme was ``I want to plow a straight furrow right down to the end of my row,'' and that philosophy guided the rest of his career in public service. Until his last campaign, in 1982, he was never seriously challenged for reelection. Even then, facing future Republican National Committee Chairman Haley Barbour, then only 34, he won by a 2-to-1 margin. In his early days in the Senate, John would work 16 hours a day, staying in the Senate until it adjourned and then studying in the Library of Congress. He was meticulous in his work, someone who would go over something again and again until he finally mastered its complexities. He was a commanding presence in the Senate Chamber, where his voice carried such resonance. Even after we had microphones, he would often speak without one. John Stennis served in the Senate longer than all but one other person in its history. When he retired on January 3, 1989, he had served for 41 years, 1 month, and 29 days. During the 1960's and 1970's, he was the most influential voice in Congress on military affairs. He was chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and was instrumental in the development of the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway, which was extremely important to both our States economically. He changed with the times, and began to support civil rights measures. Due to his integrity, diligence, and judgment, he was often called upon to investigate controversial political matters. It became routine to refer to him as the conscience of the Senate. He was a patriarch and teacher to younger Members. In his later years, while his voice remained clear and his mind sharp, he experienced serious physical problems. He was shot and seriously wounded by a burglar at his home in 1973, and had a leg amputated in 1984 due to cancer, but each time, he returned to his beloved Senate much sooner than had been expected. After he retired, Senator Stennis moved to Mississippi State University campus, home of the John C. Stennis Institute of Government and the John C. Stennis Center for Public Service, created by Congress to train young leaders. In one of his last interviews, he said, ``I do believe the most important thing I can do now is to help young people understand the past and prepare for the future.'' At that birthday celebration for John Stennis a decade ago, I had the honor and pleasure of speaking. I ended my speech with an old Irish prayer, which goes: May the road rise to meet you. May the wind always be at your back. May the sun shine warm on your face. And the rains fall soft on your shoulders, And may the Good Lord hold you in the hollow of his hand during the remainder of your days. He was a deeply religious man, and he told me he was particularly glad I used the prayer as a closing on that occasion. John Stennis' days are now over, and his passing gives us reason to pause, reflect, and remember that this body is a decidedly better institution, and the United States a better nation, for having had the benefit of this statesman's service for so many years. Thursday, May 4, 1995. Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to comment on the life and career of our departed colleague and my good friend, Senator John C. Stennis, whose long and full life ended on Sunday, April 23, at the age of 93. When Senator Stennis retired in January 1989, he had been in the Senate 41 years, 1 month, and 29 days. This made his service in the Senate longer than all but one other person in history. When I came to the U.S. Senate in November 1972, Senator Stennis had been a Member of this body for nearly 25 years, and I had the great honor and privilege of serving with Senator Stennis for 16 years--until he retired at the close of the 100th Congress in 1989. So it is with sadness that I pay tribute to the memory of this departed colleague today. John Stennis was a man who anyone coming to know him well would love and admire. I came to know him early on my arrival in the Senate. He was from my neighboring State, and I learned to follow his advice and leadership in certain areas of our service together. It was also my privilege to serve with John Stennis on the Appropriations Committee beginning in 1975. We had nearly identical subcommittee assignments on the committee. He was chairman of the then Public Works Subcommittee, now the Energy and Water Subcommittee, when I came aboard and I succeeded him as chairman of that subcommittee when he became chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee in 1978. We worked together on many matters of mutual interest, especially the Mississippi River and tributaries flood control works, and other infrastructure improvements throughout the country. He requested my assistance on the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway project and I was pleased to help floor manage the successful completion of that massive project which opened in 1985. The New York Times called the Tenn-Tom Senator Stennis' ``pyramid,'' and I am pleased to have had a role with Senator Stennis on this impressive project. Mr. President, in our committee assignments and work together, I was blessed as much as a fellow Senator could be blessed by association, counsel, and advice from our departed friend. As I mentioned earlier, it has been my honor and privilege to be closely associated with Senator Stennis for over 16 years of service together. As chairman and ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Stennis designated and commissioned me to floor manage and handle various appropriations measures including supplemental bills and continuing resolutions. He was my chairman, and I was always happy and enthusiastic to carry out his wishes on these matters. Mr. President, John Stennis was unqualifiedly and unreservedly a gentleman in the finest American tradition. He was a man whose word was as good as his bond. He had an almost reverent sense of discretion and personal taste in his relations to the greatest affairs of the Nation as in his relations to individuals. He was indeed a giant in the Senate. John Stennis was a Senator's Senator. He was gentle and courteous in conduct, but tough and strong in conviction and character. He personified the highest ideals of honor and integrity within the Senate. John Stennis also possessed an extraordinary, and indomitable, fortitude, spirit, and fearless courage. I think of the several personal adversities he confronted with such wonderful dignity and demeanor. In 1973, he was shot by robbers in front of his house and left for dead. In 1983, his beloved wife of 52 years, he called her Miss Coy, passed away. In 1984, he lost a leg to cancer and was confined thereafter to a wheelchair but, Senator Stennis bore these adversities with such great strength and courage that he served as a great inspiration to us all. We are thankful for his character, for his modesty and selflessness, for his devotion to the Senate and his family, for his outgoing good will to his friends, for his high honor as a man. Mr. President, I traveled with a number of my colleagues to the burial services for Senator Stennis on Wednesday, April 26, at the Pinecrest Cemetery in DeKalb, Mississippi. He was born in DeKalb County in the red clay hills of eastern Mississippi and his mortal remains were buried there in the family plot next to his beloved ``Miss Coy'' and near his parents. Many of the Stennis' buried there were known as professional people--doctors, lawyers, teachers, and legislators. I was deeply impressed with the tribute given Senator Stennis by his son, John Hampton Stennis. He stated Senator Stennis' campaign pledge and creed when Senator Stennis ran for the Senate in 1947, after having served as a circuit court judge for 10 years. That political creed was ``I want to plow a straight furrow right down until the end of my row.'' Obviously, Senator Stennis succeeded with that campaign pledge. And that philosophy seems to have guided his entire political career and his life. With those words John Hampton captured the spirit and philosophy of John C. Stennis. Senator Stennis taught through example. He was left both a challenge and a pattern of conduct for citizenship, as well as public life. What can our citizens today find in John C. Stennis to emulate? A course of conduct that inspires confidence; absolute personal dedication; noble purposes always foremost as a motive and objective; standards in public and private life unexcelled; a willingness to serve; a willingness to lead and endlessly carry the penalty of leadership, and above all else, the attainment of being an honorable man. I believe we find here a man and a record that fully live up to the everlasting call of the poet, Gilbert Holland, who said: God, give us men! A time like this demands Strong minds, great hearts, true faith and ready hands; Men whom the lust of office does not kill; Men whom the spoils of office cannot buy; Men who possess opinions and a will; Men who have honor; men who will not lie; Strong men, who live above the fog In public duty and in private thinking. Mary and I extend our heartfelt sympathy to the family of Senator Stennis--his daughter. Mrs. Margaret Jane Womble, and son, John Hampton Stennis, and to his grandchildren of whom he was so proud. Friday, May 5, 1995. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I just want to say a few words about two U.S. Senators, one recently deceased and one recently embarked on a spirited new part of life, both of them dear friends of mine--Senator John Stennis of Mississippi and Senator David Pryor of Arkansas. Mr. President, Senator Stennis served with my father in the U.S. Senate. My father, Milward L. Simpson of Wyoming, served here from 1962 until 1966. He was a former Governor of Wyoming from 1954 until 1958, then came to the U.S. Senate, elected to fulfill a 4-year term, or remaining 4- year term, of a young man who had been elected to the Senate and died before he was sworn in. John Stennis and Mrs. Stennis immediately greeted my father when he came here in the most cordial way. They were very dear friends of my parents. I must say that the philosophy of the western Senator, my father, and the southern gentleman, the Senator from Mississippi, were much the same with regard to national defense, fiscal matters, issues of substance in the social area, of the fabric of the country, and they became fast friends. I recall very distinctly my father called John Stennis ``Mr. Integrity.'' My father invited John Stennis, Senator Willis Robertson, and two other persons to Wyoming. I recall very distinctly, I was a young man practicing law in Cody Wyoming, and they asked me to join them. Dad took his two Senate friends fishing. You might imagine that John had not ever seen too much of Rocky Mountain trout fishing nor the attire that accompanies such activities. I will never forget him coming from his cabin, very nattily dressed, and he said, ``Milward, is that what we wear when we fish these trout?'' My father said, ``No, I think we need something more than that, something a little different.'' Off they went to enjoy a remarkable two days together. My father loved John Stennis, and when my father was the recipient of the Milward L. Simpson Chair of Political Science at the University of Wyoming, John Stennis served as his honorary chairman, and said, ``If there is anything I can do for my friend, Milward Simpson, I will do it.'' So it was a great affection and relationship, a true friendship. Then when I, of course, came to the Senate, John Stennis was the first to greet me. He said, ``If there is anything I can do to help you or smooth your path here, let me do it.'' And he did. He was more than charitable, kind, and attentive to me except, of course, when I tried to kill off the Tennessee Tombigbee Waterway. Then there was a definite strain in our relationship--momentary, fleeting. But he said, ``Alan, I cannot believe that you would do that.'' And he was right. I did not believe I could, and did not. That great waterway is a great tribute to the personal perseverance of John Stennis. But what he told me--and I shall never forget--he said ``Alan, I have been watching you.'' I had been here maybe 4 years at the time. ``I have seen you work. I know how hard you work.'' He really buoyed me up. He said, ``You want to remember something in the Senate.'' He said, ``People come here, and some grow and some swell.'' I shall never forget the phrase. ``Some grow and some swell.'' Indeed, we know both categories. I think I have done a little of both. But when I did swell, I was put down a peg or two, to get back to growing instead of swelling. So I want to just pay tribute to John Stennis, and I know my dear parents, both gone too, would have wanted me to pay tribute to a very dear and lovely friend, and to his memory, which will certainly be present in this Chamber for the remainder of time. He was deeply loved, a man of great stature, and truly a wonderful gentleman, truly a gentleman. So God bless his son and his daughter who survive him. They have a wonderful heritage. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, recently I received a letter from a Dr. Wayne M. Miller of Killeen, Texas. The letter was in reference to my recent eulogy for the late and beloved Senator John Cornelius Stennis. Dr. Miller wrote that he was deeply moved by the tribute, so much so that he sat down and composed a poem after hearing it. I call attention to the letter and to the poem enclosed with it because it demonstrates not only the sensitivity and talent of the writer, but also the power and the passion which words can evoke. In these days of often destructive, rude, and even dangerous rhetoric, let us stop and reflect on the tremendous power of our words. Such reflection may help those of us in public life and in the media to strive to use our voices to inspire rather than to inflame. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Dr. Wayne M. Miller's letter and poem be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in Record, as follows: Killeen, TX, April 27, 1995. U.S. Senator Robert C. Byrd, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC. Dear Senator Byrd, when I tuned in to a C-Span telecast last night, I caught the latter part of your eloquent tribute to the late Senator Stennis. It was truly one of the greatest speeches I have ever heard. To be sure, it had the two basic ingredients of a great speech: substantive thinking, and rhetorical skills to effectively express it. Although I am not a West Virginian, I have admired your accomplishments and the stature of your leadership. I was reared just eighty miles north of Wheeling, in a small town of Harmony, Pennsylvania. After serving as chaplain in the Air Force, I became a field director for American Red Cross-and am now retired with that organization. For the past sixteen years I have been teaching composition and rhetoric at Central Texas College. Would it be possible to have a copy of your outstanding speech? I would be ever so grateful! I am so happy that we still have statesmen of your caliber in our nation's capital. I am enclosing a poem which I wrote after listening to you on television. It reflects, in some small measure, my responsiveness to your deeply, moving words. Respectfully, Wayne M. Miller. Enclosure. To the Honorable Mr. Byrd, Distinguished U.S. Senator from the State of West Virginia, after hearing the stirring tribute delivered on the floor of Congress for the late Senator John Stennis of Mississippi (1901-1995): Your well selected words, like highly polished marble (Uniquely Mr. Byrd's!) Were fitted in a pyramid of architectural marvel- Arousing such a sentiment in the shaping of your thoughts Keen emotions were unharnessed from what common birth allots And, untouted, undergirds The daily warp and woof of our fabric of existence. You talked about our too brief pilgrimage, And you pricked our unsuspecting Achilles Heel When you sharpened our awareness of fragility That stamps the mold of our mortality- And your sobering reflection of the little bird That fluttered through the crack from the raging storm Into the blinding light of the banquet hall, And then, so very soon, fluttered out again- Demonstrated our fitful wandering, Our groping sightlessness, our straining stammering, Our hurried exit from the ever-blinding light Of the babbling banquet hall and ``much ado about nothing.'' You addressed so poignantly the human predicament In the never ending journey ``east of Eden''-- Never ending, that is, Until that special day of reckoning When all our shattered dreams, our broken vows . . . Will have their consummation In all-glorious transformation From the ugly to the beautiful And the painful to the joyful Where there will be no night, No parting and no sorrow. You led us like thirsting sheep To the oasis of our being-- The wells of spiritual refreshment There first we saw the mirroring of our impoverished selves And then experienced the waters that revive us And show us the way of day. You showed us what we are-- And what we can become In the ``long journey into night'' While we suffer in our little rooms, Waiting for the fateful end-- To be transposed by the Great Composer From our discords into harmonies, Rejoicing with the Children of the Light. Wayne Meredith Miller, 1995 Nominee for Poet of the Year. Proceedings in the House Monday, May 1, 1995. MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE A message from the Senate by Mr. Lundregan, one of its clerks, announced that the Senate had passed a resolution of the following title, in which the concurrence of the House is requested: Resolved, That the Senate has heard with profound sorrow and deep regret the announcement of the death of the Honorable John C. Stennis, late a Senator from the State of Mississippi. Resolved, That the Secretary communicate these resolutions to the House of Representatives and transmit an enrolled copy thereof to the family of the deceased. Resolved, That when the Senate recesses today, it recess as a further mark of respect to the memory of the deceased Senator. Tuesday, May 2, 1995. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Montgomery) is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. MONTGOMERY. Mr. Speaker, former Mississippi Senator John C. Stennis died on April 23 at the age of 93. He retired from the Senate in 1989. In the passage of time, we sometimes forget events and accomplishments, but we will not forget Senator Stennis. History will record Senator Stennis as one of the great statesmen of the 20th century. He was so well respected in Washington as a southern gentleman and as a man of unquestioned integrity and character. But along with his courtly southern manner, Senator Stennis was an effective leader who was tough when it came to maintaining a strong national defense and in looking out for his native state. Through more than 40 years in the Nation's capital, his first priority was to put Mississippi first. The legacy of John Stennis can be seen throughout the state of Mississippi, from the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway in the north, to Meridian's Naval Air Station to the Stennis Space Center on the gulf coast. At points in between, he was responsible for bringing Federal funds for water systems and economic development projects that helped improve the lives of his fellow Mississippians. As chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, he felt the United States should always deal from a position of military strength. He worked hard to see that our fighting men and women, both in the active forces and the National Guard and Reserve, had the equipment and training they needed to do the job. In honor of Senator Stennis' commitment to the military, Ronald Reagan announced during his presidency that the Navy's next aircraft carrier would be named the U.S.S. John C. Stennis. The ship is undergoing sea trials this spring and summer and will be officially commissioned later this year. Senator Stennis always called me ``his Congressman'' since I represented his hometown of DeKalb in Kemper County. It was a great honor to serve as his Congressman for 28 years and his colleague for 23. He was a remarkable man whose legacy will live on, here in Washington and in his beloved Mississippi. Legislative Censure November 12, 1954. FOR CENSURE OF SENATOR MCCARTHY Senator John C. Stennis, Democrat of Mississippi, spoke before the United States Senate on November 12, 1954, in support of the resolution to censure Senator Joseph McCarthy. Senator Stennis, a Member of the Senate's special censure committee, indicted Senator McCarthy for his alleged continued abuse of the Senate. The Senate had met in extraordinary session four days before to consider the report of the Select Committee appointed to study the censure charges. The bipartisan six-man group, under Chairman Senator Arthur Watkins, Utah Republican, was set up in August. On September 27, grounds for censure on two counts were presented: (1) Senator McCarthy had acted contemptuously toward a Senate Subcommittee investigating charges against him involving his finances; (2) Senator McCarthy had used ``reprehensible'' language to Brigadier General Ralph Zwicker during hearings on the discharge of Major Irving Peress, an Army dentist accused of pro-communism. Behind these charges was the implication that his investigating methods, his denunciation of all who opposed him, his defiance of President Eisenhower's authority, brought into disrepute the United States Senate. Although the debate was scheduled to begin on November 10, Senator McCarthy on November 9 released a long speech that he proposed to give before the Senate the next day. (He did not deliver it but inserted it in the Record.) Statements in that ``speech'' further inflamed some Senators. Senator Watkins opened the debate. Senator McCarthy subjected him to long cross-examination. Senator Case of South Dakota, also on the Select Committee, suggested that if Senator McCarthy would apologize for charge number one both charges might be handled without censure. In this atmosphere Senator Stennis spoke in ringing tones and with much physical aggressiveness before the crowded galleries and chamber. He made the issue not militancy against communism, as Senator McCarthy argued it should be, but McCarthyism--``political morality in senatorial conduct.'' Senator Bricker, among others, replied. On Monday, November 15, Senator Jenner led the debate for Senator McCarthy, and Senator Ervin, of North Carolina, called for censure. On November 16, Senators Watkins, Welker, and Case continued the debate, and Senator McCarthy entered the Naval Hospital at Bethesda, MD, with a disabled elbow. The Senate adjourned from November 18 until November 29. On Thursday, December 2, after three days of debate and preliminary voting on resolutions to soften the resolution, the Senate voted 67 to 22 to ``condemn'' the Wisconsin Senator. On January 20, 1955, the Senator lost his chairmanship of the Government Operations Committee and its Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations as a result of the 1954 elections, which returned a Democratic majority to the Senate. Speculation continued concerning his role as aggressive fighter against communistic subversion and as spokesman for Republican dissenters against Eisenhower. Mr. President, what is the question here? It is purely a question of political morality in senatorial conduct. To be more precise, the question is whether I, as a Senator, approve or disapprove of these proven acts as proper standards of senatorial conduct. Each Senator must make up his own mind about what are the proper standards; but, as Senators, let us remember that it is not as individuals that we are to make up our minds in this case. We are to make them up as representatives of the 161 million people of the United States; we are setting standards of conduct for a time-proven and time-tested institution which belongs to the people--the United States Senate. . . . This is not merely a question of an attack upon a Member of the Committee. I would not pass it by if it were. But that is not all it was. As I recall, I am the Member of the Committee who said that the remarks of the junior Senator from Wisconsin with reference to Senator Hendrickson belong in the category relating to the treatment of the Committee, because the Senator from New Jersey was a Member of that Committee, and the insult to him was not merely an insult to an individual. It was an insult to the constituted authority of the Senate, which was carrying out a constitutional mission. Moreover, there was an insult to a constitutional authority, the personnel of which had recently been expressly approved, including Senator Hendrickson, by a unanimous vote of the Senate. Is it a sufficient answer to say, ``Joe has done some good in hunting Communists''? Shall we destroy what have been considered the necessary processes in carrying out one mission because a man has done good in another field, on another mission? I cannot assent to such an argument. In view of the facts which I have related, do Senators believe that the mission of the Subcommittee was obstructed? Do Senators think there was an obstruction of justice? Of course, they do. There is no way to avoid such a conclusion. That is the final reason why I say there is no escape from an affirmative charge. Such conduct must be condemned. Otherwise, when challenge is made of these facts, and we fail to disapprove them, we adopt them as a standard. Let us be clear. Let us tell the youth of this country, ``This is the way. This is the high road of which the Senate approves, and upon which it likes to travel in the consideration of public business.'' That is the conclusion of this Member of the Committee. That is not all. After the report was filed and the subject set for special consideration by the Senate, and after the Senate had reassembled, the first words to be uttered on the floor by this same source of conduct were a continuation of the slush and the slime which have been poured on other committees which were charged with the duty of trying to look into the conduct. I have no personal resentment toward the junior Senator from Wisconsin for having made such statements. I feel sorry for him for having done so. I refer to Senator McCarthy's speech which was not delivered on the floor, but released to the press and inserted in the Congressional Record on the first day of the debate. It represented a continuation of the same pattern, his same course of conduct. It is another spot on the escutcheon of the Senate, another splash and splatter. Every Senator must decide this case for himself. As for the Senator from Mississippi, I cannot approve such slush and slime as a proper standard of senatorial conduct as we labor to carry on and transact the business of the people. For that reason, and that reason alone, I state my position here. I repeat that the question before the Senate is not a question of fact. The facts are agreed upon. The question is not, ``Do we approve or disapprove of everything that was done or everything that was said by every Member of the Committee at every turn throughout these proceedings?'' The question is one purely of political morality in senatorial conduct. To be precise, the question is, ``As a Senator, and not merely as an individual, do I approve or do I disapprove of these proven facts as proper standards of senatorial conduct?'' If we approve, then something big and fine will have gone from this Chamber and something wrong, something representing a wrong course, will have entered and gotten itself accepted as a proper standard of conduct. As we consider that question, I hope that in some way each Senator will seek and finally find divine guidance in deciding what his duty is, and, from the same source, find help and encouragement in performing that duty. Mr. President, I yield the floor. Memorial Services for John Cornelius Stennis A SERVICE in THANKSGIVING for THE LIFE of The Honorable John Cornelius Stennis Pinecrest Cemetery DeKalb, Mississippi APRIL 26, 1995 11:00 A.M. The liturgy, for Burial, is characterized by joy, in the certainty that ``neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.'' This joy, however, does not make human grief unchristian. The very love we have for each other in Christ brings deep sorrow when we are parted by death. Jesus himself wept at the grave of his friend. So, while we rejoice that one we love has entered into the nearer presence of our Lord, we sorrow in sympathy with those who mourn. May the souls of the faithful departed rest in peace. The Office for the Burial of the Dead Trumpet Hymn--Faith of Our Fathers. Opening Sentences. The Collect of the Day O God of grace and glory, we remember before You this day our brother John. We thank You for giving him to us, his family and friends, to know and to love as a companion on our earthly pilgrimage. In Your boundless compassion, console us who mourn. Give us faith to see in death the gate of eternal life, so that in quiet confidence we may continue our course on Earth, until, by Your call, we are reunited with those who have gone before; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. Most merciful God, whose wisdom is beyond our understanding, deal graciously with this family in their grief. Surround them with Your love, that they may not be overwhelmed by their loss, but have confidence in Your goodness, and strength to meet the days to come; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

The Apostles' Creed In the assurance of eternal life given at Baptism, let us proclaim our faith and say, I believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth. I believe in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord. He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary. He suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried. He descended to the dead. On the third day He rose again. He ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen. The Lord's Prayer Our Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed by Thy Name, Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on Earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.

Only to act justly, to love loyalty, to walk wisely before your God. a Remarks of John Hampton Stennis My sister, Margaret Jane, and I as we grew up in Kemper County during the 1940's were required to memorize passages. My mother handled the Bible; my father taught us patriotic sayings and poems. Among the first was the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag of the United States of America. Dad taught from the small plaque of the flag and the pledge (two fewer stars and two fewer words, but for him no different meaning) that I now hold. We were in the midst of World War II. He illustrated the meaning of the Pledge of Allegiance by Judge Learned Hands' address at ``I Am An American Day,'' entitled ``The Spirit of Liberty'': ``The spirit of liberty is the spirit which is not too sure that it is right; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which seeks to understand the minds of other men and women; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which weighs their interests alongside its own without bias; the spirit of liberty remembers that not even a sparrow falls to earth unheeded; the spirit of liberty is the spirit of Him who, near two thousand years ago, taught mankind that lesson it has never learned, but has never quite forgotten; that there may be a kingdom where the least shall be heard and considered side by side with the greatest.'' Our Dad's patriotism did not consist of short and frenzied outbursts of emotion, but in the tranquil and steady dedication of a lifetime. My father's oldest sister, Aunt Janie, had given him a copy of One Hundred and One Famous Poems With a Prose Supplement. We learned almost all these poems and many others, I shall share a few lines from some. be strong!
