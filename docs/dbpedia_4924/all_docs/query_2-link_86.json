        "text": "Contact: Maridith Geuder\n\nMississippi is joining more than two dozen states requiring the registration of practicing geologists.\n\nThe Registered Professional Geologists Practice Act of 1977 is designed to ensure the status of geologists whose work affects public health, safety or welfare. Passed by the Legislature in April, the law went into effect in July, said Darrel W. Schmitz, associate professor of geosciences at Mississippi State University.\n\nSchmitz is part of a five-person task force that proposed the legislation and was appointed by Gov. Kirk Fordice to a state registration board. Other members are chair Rick Ericksen of Ridgeland, Mississippi Office of Geology; independent oil and gas geologist W. Lester Aultman of Clinton; John W. Green of Terry, the firm of GeoScience Engineers; and Charles T. Swann of Oxford, University of Mississippi's Mineral Resources Institute.\n\nThe state will use a certification exam developed by the National Association of State Boards of Geologists. Those successfully completing the process will be issued an official seal to be used on all geologic reports, documents or other records offered to or filed for the public.\n\nSchmitz said Mississippi State is among four state institutions that will use the certification process to evaluate the preparation of their graduating geology majors. Others are Millsaps College, U.M. and the University of Southern Mississippi.\n\n\"Many jobs in geology are related to the environment, from geologic studies of solid waste sites to groundwater studies,\" the Eupora native said. \"The work that geologists do can have a profound impact on public welfare.\"\n\nHe said the board now is developing regulations to govern registration. In addition to placing the documents for review and public comment with the Secretary of State's office, a public meeting will be held Oct. 17 at the Department of Environmental Quality in Jackson.\n\nSchmitz said petroleum geologists and those who solely teach geology are exempt from the requirements, but may register if they wish. Applications will be available beginning next month, with a \"grandfathering\" period continuing through 1998.\n\n\"Those who are qualified will be 'grandfathered' in,\" Schmitz said. \"Newcomers, as well as everyone who wishes to register after the 'grandfather' period, must take the exam.\""
