        "text": "About\n\nThe Wind Ensemble is composed of the top 45-50 wind and percussion students on the Raymond Campus. All performers receive generous service awards for their musical abilities and dedication to the program. The level of literature performed is grade 4-6, with emphasis on exposing musicians to all styles of classic and contemporary wind and percussion literature.\n\nMusicians further have the opportunity to attain personal achievement through participation in the Mississippi Community and Junior College Band Director’s Association Intercollegiate Band. In addition to regular band duties, students are able to participate in various ensembles sponsored by the music and band departments: jazz ensemble, brass quintet, percussion ensemble and rock band, to name a few.\n\nInternational Exchange Programs\n\nThe band and music department at Hinds Community College is actively involved in international exchange programs with Bridgwater College in the United Kingdom. Small ensembles such as the brass quintet and Room101, the college’s top rock band, have participated in collaborative projects with instructors and students from the UK. In March 2012, these two groups will be traveling to begin a new collaborative project with Bridgwater College. This program will expand the new music industry program at Hinds while offering the students an international touring experience.\n\nPrestigious Events\n\nHinds Community College ensembles have performed at many events and events over the years: including a concert for General Colin Powell, former Mississippi Governor Kirk Fordice and several past governors at the State Convention honoring Volunteerism in America, and opening the ceremonies at the state capitol for National Day of Prayer. The Wind Ensemble has also been featured in concert at the Capitol District Band Director’s Clinic, the Mississippi Private School Band Director’s State Clinic, has performed for the Rotary Club of America’s Southeast Convention, opened for the Mississippi Symphony at Pepsi Pops and opened for the country group Montgomery Gentry at the Mississippi Coliseum, Symphony Hall in Chicago, Normandy Beach and Paris, France.\n\nThe Wind Ensemble meets part time during the fall semester, and full time in the spring semester. Selections from past performances include: Gavorkna Fanfare, EI Camino Real, The Thunderer, Tales From the Vienna Woods, Light Cavalry Overture, A Gershwin Portrait, Meditation from “Thais”, March Slave, Romany Life from “The Fortune Teller”, The Holst Suites, Barnum and Bailey’s Favorite, Scootin’ on Hardrock, The Barber of Seville, Slava!, The Marriage of Figaro, Lincolnshire Posey, and many other works by Grainger, Ticheli, Holst and Sousa. The band also features works of local composers and arrangers.\n\nAuditions for Wind Ensemble and Concert Band are held in November. Requirements and music are posted in the Hinds Community College Band Hall and online. Be aware that these materials change each year. Students must contact the band office for an appointment to audition."
