        "text": "If it is still possible for a progressive Democrat to win statewide office in the Deep South, the pollsters and consultants say, it is by forging a coalition between black voters and white women.\n\nThat theory will meet a significant test in next Tuesday's election for governor of Mississippi. Although Mississippi is one of the most conservative states in the nation and has enjoyed robust economic health in recent years, Dick Molpus, a Democrat, has managed to stay within striking distance of Gov. Kirk Fordice, a Republican, by seeking a large black turnout and appealing aggressively to women.\n\nIn that effort, Mr. Molpus, who has been Mississippi's Secretary of State for 12 years, has received some unexpected help from Mr. Fordice.\n\nTwo weeks ago, during a lunch meeting with reporters, Mr. Fordice mockingly imitated the soft drawl of Mr. Molpus's wife, Sally, who appears in a television advertisement criticizing the Governor's record on education. It provided just the opening that Mr. Molpus's stagnant campaign needed.\n\nMr. Molpus, 46, quickly condemned Mr. Fordice for insulting his wife, and added, \"Frankly, I'd like to take him out behind the woodshed.\" A few days later, after a televised debate, Mr. Fordice approached Mr. Molpus and told him, according to Mr. Molpus, \"This 61-year-old man will take you to the woodshed,\" adding, in Mississippi vernacular, that he would harm him.\n\nThe exchange, which the Fordice campaign refuses to confirm or deny, has helped Mr. Molpus focus attention on Mr. Fordice's bombastic brand of Mississippi machismo, and Mr. Fordice's approval ratings with women have deteriorated correspondingly.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
