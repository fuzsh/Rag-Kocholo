        "text": "Mississippi’s Republican governor said yesterday he was divorcing his wife of 44 years and will marry a recently widowed Memphis woman – his junior-high-school sweetheart.\n\nRumors about Kirk Fordice’s relationship with Ann Creson have swirled since the governor announced in 1993 that he and his wife, Pat, had “irreconcilable differences.”\n\nPat Fordice refused to say publicly she wanted a divorce – even though she disclosed last spring that her husband had bought a $230,000 home outside Jackson and never invited her to see it.\n\nFordice, 65, has refused to discuss the house, saying it was a private matter.\n\nOn Tuesday, Fordice was captured on videotape threatening a TV reporter who asked him about the European vacation he recently took with Creson while his wife remained home.\n\n“Let me tell you something, you invade my privacy this way, six months from now, I’ll whip your a–,” said Fordice, who will leave office later this year due to terms limits.\n\nWLBT-TV said Fordice and Creson were sweethearts in junior high school, and became reacquainted at a reunion in 1992.\n\nCreson’s husband, Roy Franklin Creson Jr., died last November.\n\nFordice’s lawyer said that “upon conclusion of his divorce, (the governor) plans to marry her.”"
