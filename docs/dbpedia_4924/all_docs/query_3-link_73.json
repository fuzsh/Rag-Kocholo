        "text": "U.S. Commission on Civil Rights\n\nRacial and Ethnic Tensions in American Communities: Poverty, Inequality, and Discrimination Volume VII: The Mississippi Delta Report\n\nChapter 2\n\nRace and the Public Education System in Mississippi\n\nELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION\n\nScholars have warned that absent innovative policy changes, Mississippi and the rural South will face a work force crisis as a result of the globalization of the regional economy and the shift away from unskilled industrial labor. Mississippi currently lacks the skilled and educated workers necessary to stimulate vigorous economic growth. The state has long been characterized by an out-migration of talent from the region, with a corresponding brain drain each year of college students who elect to leave the Delta upon graduation. According to the CEO of one Delta corporation, Mississippi is confronting a horrific problem in the area of public education, and as a result, he rejects nearly two-thirds of job applicants to his company because they are unable to meet his company's hiring criteria.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges facing the Mississippi public school system today is poverty. According to Dr. James Hemphill, special assistant to the state superintendent and director of external relations of the Mississippi State Department of Education, this is particularly evident in the Delta where the economy is so depleted that obtaining a quality education is extremely difficult. High rates of poverty coupled with a legacy of unequal educational opportunities for people of color, who make up more than one-third of the population, have left Mississippi's children at a substantial disadvantage compared with the rest of the nation.\n\nBackground\n\nIn 1990, 75.2 percent of the total U.S. population had a high school diploma or higher educational attainment. This figure was 77.9 percent for whites and 63.1 percent for blacks. In Mississippi, however, the figures were much lower with a rate of 64.3 percent for the total state population, including 71.7 percent for whites and 47.3 percent for blacks. The gap between educational achievement in Mississippi and the rest of the nation and that between black and white Mississippians are equally dramatic for those with a bachelor's degree or higher. Compared with 20.3 percent of the total U.S. population, only 14.7 percent of the Mississippi population had a bachelor's degree or higher. Nationwide the figures for whites and blacks were 21.5 percent and 11.4 percent, respectively, compared with 17.2 percent of Mississippi whites and 8.8 percent of Mississippi blacks. Only Arkansas and West Virginia lagged behind Mississippi in equivalent educational attainment.\n\nIn 1995, the national high school graduation rate was about 86 percent the same level as in 1990. In contrast, Mississippi had a graduation rate of 75 percent in 1995. And that number had declined to 73.8 percent by 1998. Although the total number of public high school graduates is projected to increase 20 percent between 1995 1996 and 2007 2008, in Mississippi the total number is expected to decrease 1 percent. Failing to complete high school has a direct impact on a person's potential for financial stability and success. In 1992, for example, high school dropouts were three times more likely to receive income from AFDC or public assistance than high school graduates who did not go on to college (17 percent versus 6 percent). And in 1998, high school graduates nationwide had an unemployment rate of 4 percent compared with 7.1 percent for those who had not completed high school.\n\nEducation constitutes a major expense for Mississippi. In fiscal year 1995, Mississippi spent $1.478 billion on education or 58.7 percent of all general fund appropriations. The Mississippi public school system comprises 149 school districts and three agricultural high schools, which in 1995 served 503,301 elementary and secondary students. It is difficult to approximate the number of private school students in the state because various sources provide different figures. The U.S. Department of Education estimates that in 1993, Mississippi had 221 private elementary and secondary schools that served 58,655 students. More recently, the Mississippi Private School Association was estimated to have 90 member schools representing 36,000 37,000 students, and the state s Catholic schools, which do not belong to the association, were calculated to represent an additional 10,000 students. Overall, the Mississippi Council of Chief State School Officers estimates that 88.7 percent of Mississippi's school-age children are in public schools compared with the national average of 90 percent.\n\nQuality of Education\n\nTestimony at the Mississippi Delta hearing brought forth a harsh indictment of the Mississippi public school system. Roger Malkin, chairman of the Delta and Pine Land Company in Scott, Mississippi, testified that his company, during the hiring process, has found that many young people applying for work with a high school diploma are functionally illiterate. Mr. Malkin testified, I think it's a tragedy, and I'm here as a U.S. citizen, a Mississippi citizen, and I think that public education in the United States is appalling, and we have to do something about it.\n\nAs in many high poverty areas, many Mississippi public schools are characterized by dilapidated buildings and insufficient resources. In June 1995, the State Department of Education visited, unannounced, the Quitman County schools and found filthy buildings, truant students, and depressing and appalling conditions. Clearly, the physical conditions of a school setting including lighting, air and ventilation, classroom space, and outside distractions can play a role in the educational process. Many schools in the Delta were built in the 1940s and 1950s and have not been properly maintained. Furthermore, it has been estimated that 30 percent of all Delta schools need additional classroom space to accommodate students adequately.\n\nMississippi uses a performance-based accreditation system to evaluate its school districts. The accreditation levels are from level 1, which is probation, to level 5, which is excellent. A level 3 is considered successful. For 1995, only one school district received a 5, and 19 school districts were ranked at level 4. The majority of school districts, 90 in total, fell into the 3 3.9 range. Twenty-four schools received a performance index between 2 and 2.9, and 19 received a performance index between 1 and 1.9. Of those 19 low-scoring districts, 10 were located in the Delta or its periphery. The student performance in Tunica County, for example, has been so poor that the district has been under state oversight since March 1997.\n\nGenerally, the literature on whether student performance is correlated with spending has been contradictory. Tables 2.1 and 2.2 show that the average total per pupil expenditure for the top 10 performing school districts is $3,963 and for the bottom 10 districts, the figure is $4,509. Thus, on average, the lowest ranking districts spend more money per pupil than the top performing districts.\n\nUnlike other states, Mississippi has not experienced an eruption of equity funding lawsuits. This may be attributable in part to the State Legislature implementing, over the governor's veto, the Mississippi Adequate Education Program. This program seeks to ensure that every school district will receive sufficient funds to provide an adequate education. The state will provide an increase of at least 8 percent for education services in every district. The program, implemented in 1998, will continue to be phased in over a six-year period, and will target an additional $130 million annually to education needs throughout the state.\n\nAnother factor affecting student achievement is the efficiency of the school district administration, including superintendents. Mississippi has 65 counties that elect, rather than appoint, their school superintendents. This is more than any other state. While many of the top performing districts have appointed superintendents, and while many of the worst performing districts have elected superintendents, testimony at the Mississippi Delta hearing suggested that data on this matter are inconclusive.\n\nTestimony at the hearing suggested that allowing appointment rather than election of superintendents would infuse and in fact give the district the ability to go outside the county lines to attract an effective leader. Dr. Ron Love, deputy superintendent, State Department of Education, testified that the most significant drawbacks of electing the school superintendent is that the talent pool that you've got to select from has got to live right there next door to you, and be affected by all the local politics in that community. So it can be very difficult for them to get some new blood into the community. . . .\n\nBut according to Dr. Hattie Nalls of the Adolescent Family Life Institute, Inc., both elected and appointed officials are subject to the same political influences. Although she said the community has a larger voice in the election of local officials, even in that, a lot of manipulation goes on, with some ministers, for example, encouraging their parishioners to vote for a particular person. And her criticism of appointed officials was similarly harsh because, based on Dr. Nalls observations, many appointed positions are decided before it gets into the chamber.\n\nTestimony at the hearing suggested that only a small minority of the 15,000 school districts around the nation have kept the position of superintendent as an elected one. And yet nearly half of Mississippi's school districts 63 out of 149 have kept the position elected rather than appointed.\n\nTABLE 2.1\n\nTop Ten Performing Mississippi School Districts\n\nSchool district\n\nPerformance index\n\nTotal per pupil expenditure\n\nState and local revenue\n\nFederal revenue\n\nRank in spending\n\nState average\n\nN/A\n\n$4,211 85.4% 14.6% N/A Pontotoc City 5.0 3,629 89.4 10.6 144 Booneville 4.9 4,066 89.3 10.7 92 Corinth 4.9 4,400\n\n86.8\n\n13.2 59 Clinton 4.9 3,644 93.0 7.0 141 Ocean Springs 4.9 3,704\n\n93.5\n\n6.5 137 Petal 4.7 4,188 90.8 9.2 74 Long Beach 4.7 4,079 91.9 8.1 87 Lamar County 4.7 3,485 91.4 8.6 151 Tupelo 4.7 4,664 92.2 7.8 28 Pontotoc County 4.7 3,775 89.4 10.6 134 Top average N/A 3,963 90.8 9.2 N/A\n\nNote: Total per pupil expenditure is calculated by using the total current expenditures from all sources of revenue divided by the nine months average daily attendance.

The state is currently focusing on improving the skills of its local school administrators whether elected or appointed.\n\nSeveral educators and community leaders suggested that the educational process must take place in the home as well as in the schools. Municipal judge and attorney Clell Ward stated in his interview with Commission staff:\n\nWe can't solve the problem through the school system. Parents need to have an understanding as to the importance of education first, and that might entail some sort of program to train parents in conjunction with a program to reduce teenage pregnancy. We need to train parents how to be parents and instill values.\n\nSimilarly, Dr. Martha Cheney, project coordinator for the Mississippi Public Education Forum, a private foundation funded by the state's business community, believes that there must be a stronger focus on the basics, which includes parents talking to their young children in the home during their preschool years.\n\nFunding, Resources, and Equal Opportunity\n\nTitle I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act\n\nThe Elementary and Secondary Education Act, enacted in 1965, established several programs that provided federal funds to local school districts. Title I of the act created a program specifically designed to improve educational opportunities for educationally deprived children. Funding levels are calculated based on the number of low-income children in the school district. The Title I program supplements local school efforts to improve the basic and advanced skills of students at risk of school failure.\n\nTitle I funds reach approximately 14,000 school districts and serve more than six million children annually. Since Title I's enactment, Congress has appropriated almost $97 billion to local school districts. In 1995, Mississippi received almost $122 million in Title I funds, which were distributed to 719 schools serving 246,524 schoolchildren. Approximately 75 percent of the funds were used for classroom instruction. In 1996, disbursements to Mississippi increased to $126.4 million.\n\nA 1993 U.S. Department of Education study of Title I found that recipients of services under the program in schools where at least three quarters of the children were poor scored substantially lower in math and reading than recipients attending schools where fewer than half were poor. Many of the Delta school districts that continue to perform poorly rely heavily on federal funds. For many school districts, receipt of Title I funds drive their per-pupil expenditures above the state average.\n\nThere appears to be disagreement among education leaders as to the costs and benefits associated with accepting Title I funds. Dr. Margaret Cheney, project coordinator of the Mississippi Public Education Forum, argues that residents of the Delta see the federal government as a sugar daddy because of the substantial federal assistance received under Title I and from the National Science Foundation.\n\nBut Dr. James Hemphill and Dr. Ron Love, both special assistants to the state superintendent, point to the benefits of federal funding. Dr. Hemphill testified at the Mississippi Delta hearing that Title I funding absolutely plays a role in raising student achievement levels in poverty areas. He believes that, without it, Mississippi public schools would be in desperate shape. Dr. Love arrived at the same conclusion. The single criticism with how the money is spent in the state of Mississippi was put forth by Dr. Hemphill, who testified that the funds should be focused earlier in a child's education.\n\nMississippi Teachers\n\nIn 1994, the U.S. Department of Education released a report finding that public school teacher salaries in rural settings are several thousand dollars lower on average than in metropolitan areas. For the 1993 1994 academic year, the average annual salary for teachers nationwide was $36,846. For the same year, Mississippi had the lowest average salary for public school teachers, $25,715. These numbers have increased only slightly: in 1998 the national average was $37,560, and the average in Mississippi was $27,720. Moreover, Mississippi's entry-level salary for teachers ranked near the bottom at $18,833.\n\nIn 1997, the State Legislature approved a three-year initiative to raise teacher salaries 10 percent, but even these raises are not expected to make Mississippi s average teacher salary competitive with those in other states. The State Department of Education maintains that while increased teacher pay was the primary legislative goal to address these concerns, there are other efforts underway to address teacher pay in a systematic way, which is essential in recruiting and retaining teachers.\n\nOn May 1, 2000, Mississippi Governor Ronnie Musgrove signed a bill into law that gives teachers a 30 percent pay raise to be phased in over the next six years. But teachers are disappointed because of a provision in the new law that requires the state revenue to increase by 5 percent before the raises are given. And although Governor Musgrove has promised to ask the Legislature next year to remove the revenue requirement, Maryann Graczyk, president of the Mississippi American Federation of Teachers, said, A lot of teachers do not have faith in the Legislature because of past broken promises. Some look at [the raise package] as another set of broken promises.\n\nTestimony at the Mississippi Delta hearing suggested that if all the graduates of Mississippi's 15 public and private education schools stayed to teach in Mississippi public schools (currently less than two-thirds of the graduates remain in-state), it still would not be enough to fill the void left by the teachers who are beginning to retire. Current stopgap measures include the use of approximately 1,500 teachers who have been awarded emergency teaching certificates, as well as a large number of long-term substitutes.\n\nThe current shortage of minority teachers is particularly acute. Minority students only account for about one-tenth of the students in teacher education courses in Mississippi. Moreover, many African American education students, especially those toward the top of the class, are recruited, with higher pay and better benefits packages, to work at schools outside Mississippi.\n\nDr. Andrew Mullins, former special assistant to the state superintendent of schools, notes that he has seen a precipitous drop in the number of minority teachers obtaining certification. Moreover, testimony delivered in the Mississippi Delta hearing emphasized that many of the poorest school districts, with the highest concentrations of minority students, are also the ones grappling with the most severe teacher shortages:\n\nThere is a severe shortage of teachers in [the Mississippi Delta]. In many cases there is a warm body or no body to instruct the children. We have seen a recent precipitous decline in the number of minority teachers and the number of minority teachers statewide applying for certification. The number of black applicants continues to decline. It is difficult to attract white teachers to all-black districts in many cases. These factors, coupled with experienced teachers retiring earlier, teachers leaving the profession due to classroom discipline problems, inadequate administrators and little or no parental support, create a real and worsening crisis for many of our Delta schools.\n\nFinally, the hearing testimony indicated that despite the fact that schools with high percentages of black students see the need for African American teacher role models, meeting that objective is becoming increasingly difficult in low-income areas such as the Delta. Dr. Love testified, You can [have] a district that's 97 percent black and at least 50 percent or more faculty will be white.\n\nMississippi Teaching Corps\n\nDr. Mullins, former special assistant to the state superintendent of schools, testified at the Mississippi Delta hearing about the Mississippi Teaching Corps, which offers structured entry into the teaching profession for liberal arts graduates from all over the country who have strong backgrounds in math, natural sciences, or foreign languages. The program, which requires a two-year commitment, combines full-time teaching with working toward a master's degree in education. The degree program, financed by the state, includes summer study with a small stipend.\n\nIn the summer prior to the first academic year, the teachers are required to enter into a certification process at the University of Mississippi at Oxford. Afterwards, the recruits are assigned to the most impoverished schools, which are primarily in the Delta. On the weekends, they return to the university to work on their master's degrees. Approximately 25 students enroll each year. In 1997, the class of 22 Teaching Corps students included two African American teachers.\n\nMembers of the Mississippi Teaching Corps are required to teach for a minimum of two years. Of the 25 teachers who were beginning their second year in 1997, five said they would be staying to teach for a third year. However, testimony at the hearing suggested that many Corps teachers leave pretty discouraged by the situation that they find themselves in.\n\nMississippi Critical Teacher Shortage Act of 1998\n\nThe state is now aware of the critical need for teachers, and it has funded several creative programs to help address the problem. These programs include the following:\n\nCritical Needs Teacher Scholarship Program. This program provides full scholarships (tuition, room, meals, books, materials, and fees) for full- or part-time students willing to teach in geographical shortage areas.\n\nWilliam Winter Scholarship Fund. Under this program, if a newly minted teacher agrees to teach for one year in both a subject and geographic shortage area, the state will repay two years of that teacher's educational training.\n\nUniversity Assisted Teacher Recruitment and Retention Grant Program. This program provides scholarships to teachers in shortage areas to seek a graduate degree.\n\nRelocation Grant/Reimbursement of Interview Expenses. One-time grant for teachers moving to teacher shortage areas and reimbursement of expenses incurred during the interview process at districts discretion.\n\nMississippi Employer-Assisted Housing Teacher Program. This program is a special home loan program for teachers agreeing to serve in shortage areas.\n\nMississippi School Administrator Sabbatical Program. This program reimburses the salary and fringe benefits (for one year) paid to teachers completing an approved full-time administrator preparation program.\n\nWhile these programs are a good start, more needs to be done if the teacher shortage problem is going to be resolved.\n\nThe Public Education Forum of Mississippi convened a task force in 1998 to examine factors contributing to public school educators leaving the profession. The task force determined that the three highest factors, in descending order, were inadequate salary, discipline problems, and better job opportunities. During the hearing, the following were suggested as possible reasons why teachers are leaving the profession:\n\nHigh pupil-to-teacher ratio. There was testimony at the hearing that a high pupil-to-teacher ratio, especially when there is a wide divergence of talent in the classroom, can lead to discipline problems and other stress factors that can contribute to a teacher's decision to leave the classroom.\n\nReducing years of service required before retirement from 30 years to 25 years. Some argue this is good because it allows teachers who are burned out or those teachers who are merely biding their time until they can retire to go ahead and leave. Thus, lowering the minimum number of years of service required for retirement can entice unproductive teachers to leave the profession. However, this policy change can also lead to a loss of highly productive teachers: Many teachers, when they reach their 25th year of teaching, will retire from the state and then go teach in a private school or across the line in another state. They can then draw retirement benefits from their 25-year teaching career in Mississippi, in addition to a salary from another school or state.\n\nPoor administrator support and mentoring. Some of the Mississippi Teacher Corps teachers have reported that they are placed into a classroom with little or no help from the school administrator or from fellow teachers, even though everyone knows the teachers have no classroom experience. There was also testimony at the Mississippi Delta hearing on the importance of implementing a master teacher program that would provide mentoring to new teachers. Each new teacher would be assigned an experienced master teacher for one year, who could nurture the new teacher's growth and advancement as an educational leader in the school.\n\nDesegregation of the Public Schools\n\nMississippi has had a history of denying equal educational opportunities to its minority children. For the first 50 odd years of this century, Mississippi's system of public education was one of separate and unequal for blacks. In 1916, the per capita expenditure for each white child of school age in Mississippi was $10.60, and for each black child, $2.26. In 1939, for every $9.88 spent for white instruction, $1 was spent on blacks. The 1943 ratios were $8.27 to $1.75 for whites and blacks, respectively. In anticipation of Brown v. Board of Education, and hoping to weaken the case against segregation, the state enacted legislation calling for equal resources for both black and white children and attempted to promote a public education system that was separate but equal.\n\nErle Johnston, former state director of the controversial Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission (1963 1968), writes that no state fought harder than Mississippi after Brown to thwart integration and discourage blacks from enrolling in all-white public schools. Only after the U.S. Supreme Court's rulings in two other important school desegregation cases, Green v. County School Board of New Kent County and in Alexander v. Holmes a full 15 years after Brown did Mississippi seriously begin the process of integrating its public school system.\n\nBy that point, white flight may have rendered school integration plans largely ineffective. There was significant white flight to private schools in the 1960s and 1970s, and to predominantly white suburban communities in the 1980s and 1990s. Indeed, white flight now has left Mississippi public schools not much more racially diverse than they were before desegregation began.\n\nA dramatic rise in private all-white schools in Mississippi occurred in the late 1960s. In the 1963 1964 school year, there were only 17 private schools, enrolling 2,362 students (916 of whom were black). By September 1970, there were 155 private non-Catholic schools, with an estimated student population of 42,000. In the Jackson school district, 9,000 of its 39,000 students left the public school system from September 1969 to September 1971.\n\nA white journalist who was a first grader in Leland, Mississippi, a small Delta town that began its first year of integration in 1971, wrote:\n\nAfter the Court's ruling, a flood of hysterical white Mississippi families fled to newly created segregationist academies-schools with Confederate-colonel mascots and rebel flag logos. . . . For white Mississippians who considered themselves enlightened, the idea of sending their children to all-white private schools twenty-five years ago was taboo . . . But today, those crude segregationist trappings have largely fallen away. . . . Today, many of the children of the early white graduates of Leland's integrated public schools are attending private academies.\n\nAs one black state legislator explained it: We just all quietly go about our own way. Folks from the academy ask me from time to time if I can help them find any good black children . . . I say What for? This same sentiment was expressed in an interview shortly before the Mississippi Delta hearing by Robert Davis, a professor of law at the University of Mississippi, who was an expert witness at the hearing:\n\nWhen it comes to interacting socially, the atmosphere in Mississippi is different from other parts of the country. The different races are not comfortable with each other separation seems to be promoted in different ways, including in professional groups, in social groups, in churches, etc. You basically have two societies that go about their lives and only get together when they have to. People don't seem to want bridges built.\n\nOf course, there was also testimony at the hearing to suggest that important social interaction is starting to take place among the races. According to Dr. William Sutton, president of historically black Mississippi Valley State University:\n\nI can see some changes . . . in the communities and the rotary clubs and on bank boards and also in the chambers of commerce that we are beginning to participate a bit more, and that will help, but we have a long ways to go.\n\nIn March 1998, members of President Clinton's Advisory Board on Race gathered at the University of Mississippi for a forum dedicated to gauging the community s progress on race. One newspaper reported that the old South and the new one clashed :\n\nA black student and a white student from Oxford High School declared their friendship with a heartfelt hug, but also pointed out that black and white students segregated themselves at lunch. Black speakers complained about the lack of a black doctor in town, adding that a non-white physician would have trouble attracting white patients. When a white man in the audience stood to proclaim that it was his freedom to wave the Confederate flag at Ole Miss football games, a white student responded by saying that most students would appreciate it if he did not.\n\nSome observers maintain that for both blacks and whites there is social pressure not to send their children to schools where they will be in the minority. Moreover, testimony at the Mississippi Delta hearing points out that as private schools flourish in a given community, support for the public schools can wane. Dr. Love, special assistant to the state superintendent, stated:\n\nI think the most dramatic impact the private schools [have] on public schools ha[s] to do with divided loyalties and community support for your public schools. I've worked in districts where there was very little private schooling, like Tupelo, and we enjoyed a great deal of communitywide [support] from local businesses and others. I think in the Delta on the other hand . . . you may have divided loyalties. . . . And that I think is the most crucial factor in terms of development of academies versus some other things. That's where the impact tends to be most negative.\n\nRobert Buck, counsel for the Greenville Public School District Board of Trustees, testified that he, too, believes private academies can drain away support from the public school system, especially due to the economic burden placed upon parents who send their children to private schools:\n\nIf you have persons who pull their children out of a school system into a separate school system, as a result of the desegregation of public schools that took place in the 60s and the 70s, you have those persons now having to devote their resources to support the private academies, and at the same time pay ad valorem taxes to support the public school system. I think it almost necessarily follows that those persons whose resources are now being stretched are going to be opposed to anything that would mean an increase in tax rates . . . It certainly is my impression, based on my observation and also the impression of many people that I talk to that in fact there has been an adverse effect upon support for public education as a result of the proliferation of private academies.\n\nThe problems surrounding the increase of predominately white private academies have plagued one small community in Tunica County for several years. Most residents of Tunica County are black, poor, and poorly educated. In Robinsonville, a small unincorporated area in Tunica County, local officials are planning to build an $8 million state-of-the-art elementary school for students in the area. At first glance, the proposed plan would appear to directly benefit the residents of Robinsonville. But in the area immediately surrounding the property where the school is to be built, an upscale residential development is also scheduled to be built. This development will undoubtedly attract higher income white families. As a result, area residents have organized with state and local officials to oppose the school, which many view as another plan to perpetuate the pattern of segregation that exists across the region.\n\nBecause Tunica County schools are operating under a 1970 mandatory desegregation order, the school board has to get approval from the Department of Justice before it can build a new school. To date, the Justice Department has refused to approve the plan, noting the likelihood that the new school would be populated by the predominately white residents of the surrounding residential development, and recommended other sites for the proposed plan that had a higher percentage of black students. Even if the Justice Department and the school board reach an agreement, the plan must then be approved by a federal judge.\n\nSome observers consider Brown v. Board of Education the moral pinnacle in the struggle for equality of opportunity between whites and African Americans. Others view public school desegregation as destructive to black identity and destructive to black control of the educational process for their children. Whatever one's view, it is clear that efforts to desegregate public schools in the Delta have largely failed. Dr. Arthur G. Cosby, a sociologist at Mississippi State University, suggests that the failure of the Mississippi school system to achieve integration has had a negative impact on education overall. He argues that while it appears that there are substantial resources being spent on education, these resources are greatly fragmented, resulting in a wasteful duplication of effort, a failure to achieve economies of scale, and suboptimal results from the resources that are spent.\n\nThe Link between Community Leadership, Successful Schools, and Integration\n\nDr. Hemphill testified that community leadership is absolutely paramount to successful schools:\n\nWe see many times that the most important reason students are not achieving is leadership, not necessarily funding, but leadership, and not necessarily educational leadership, but leadership in the communities. You have a community that expects a school district to provide a superior product, you ll have a good school district. If you have a community that doesn't expect that, then they probably will not do it.\n\nRoger Malkin, chairman of the Delta and Pine Land Company in Scott, Mississippi, testified that he thought part of the problem with public education at least in the city of Greenville was that the all-black school board is in favor of mediocrity, they're not particularly in favor of excellence. Mr. Malkin argued that there was a leadership problem in the black community, and he expressed discouragement over his belief that the blacks who have made it, and there are a lot of . . . financially successful blacks in Greenville, they never show up at public school meetings. Furthermore, testified Mr. Malkin, commitments to desegregation and integration would not take place until the public schools improved:\n\nWhat we must do everywhere in the United States is we've got to improve public education so it is a bargain. People don't think they're getting their money's worth any more, white and black, and I think the critical thing is to improve education in the public sector and they will come. Build it and they will come.\n\nBut according to Dr. Mullins, schools in the region have always been lacking. He explained in a recent Mississippi news article, You had an all white Legislature, with only one or two blacks as late as 1968. There wasn't much interest in improving the schools. In describing one of the reasons that black schools were systematically neglected and underfunded, Dr. Mullins said, You didn't want to educate a good field worker because they'd leave the field.\n\nIn Mississippi, it is estimated that there are approximately 500,000 students in the public school system (K 12), and approximately 50,000 in nonpublic schools (including approximately 35,000 in private academies, 10,000 in parochial schools, and 2,000 students in Episcopal schools). It is estimated that approximately 50 percent of the public school students are black, that approximately 25 to 30 percent of the parochial students are black, and that less than 2 percent of the private academy students are black.\n\nBut these numbers fail to illustrate the point that schools in some parts of the state are much more segregated and homogeneous than in others. In the Delta, many of the school districts are 95, 96, and 97 percent black. Dr. Love testified at the Mississippi Delta hearing, If you spent most of your life in the Delta, you [would] think every public school in the state was all black. Dr. Mullins concluded that in the Delta, [a]ll the whites went to private schools.\n\nResegregation of the Public Schools\n\nThe resegregation of children in America's schools has increased progressively since the 1980s. According to Harvard University education professor Gary Orfield, segregation of blacks in the South declined dramatically from the mid-1960s through the early 1970s, was stable until 1988, and has been rising since that time. Orfield reports that in 1991 1992, 36.6 percent of black Mississippi students were in schools with 90 100 percent minority populations.\n\nThe typical white student in a Mississippi public school attended a school with an average population of 31.5 percent black students. In total, blacks make up 51 percent of the total public school population in Mississippi. Of the public school districts, 67 are 60 percent or more black and 56 are 60 percent or more white. Only 30 school districts are close to being racially balanced with a white/black ratio of 40 percent white to 60 percent black.\n\nTABLE 2.3\n\nPercentage of Black and White Children in Mississippi Delta and Peripheral Delta Public Schools\n\nDistrict population\n\nSchool population\n\nSchool district % white % black % white % black West Bolivar 23.9 75.6 5.1 94.1 North Bolivar 18.7 80.5 1.9 98.6 Coahoma County 30.0 69.2 2.7 96.0 Holmes County 21.9 77.9 0 .1 99.9 Humphreys 31.8 68.1 3.3 96.6 Leflore 34.8 64.9 4.7 95.2 Quitman County 40.5 58.5 4.2 95.7 Sunflower 32.3 67.1 2.6 97.4 Clarksdale Separate 37.6 62.1 21.2 78.2 Cleveland County 49.7 49.3 27.5 71.6 Indianola 34.7 64.6 6.5 93.3 East Tallahatchie 51.0 48.8 33.3 66.7 West Tallahatchie 27.9 71.4 6.3 99.7 Tunica 24.4 75.4 1.4 98.6 Greenville Public 36.0 63.4 7.5 92.3 Western Line 67.0 32.1 44.1 54.9 Yazoo County 59.7 40.0 30.6 69.3 Yazoo City Municipal 35.2 64.4 13.8 86.1 South Delta 36.3 63.4 6.2 93.8 Drew 41.3 58.4 16.7 83.3 Shaw 32.7 67.3 5.1 94.8 Benoit 31.5 68.5 1.53 96.6 Mound Bayou 0.8 99.2 0.2 99.8\n\nNote: Numbers may not add up to 100%, reflecting other races.\n\nSource: State of Mississippi, Department of Education, Office of Accountability Reporting, Mississippi Report Card 95.\n\nIn some parts of the state where private schools were created in direct response to the desegregation orders, whites have returned to the public schools. This is not the case in the Delta, however, where the vast majority of white children attend private or religious schools and black children attend schools that are overwhelmingly black public schools. For example, in Holmes County, while the district population is 21.9 percent white, the public school K 12 enrollment is only 0.1 percent white. As table 2.3 indicates, these figures are representative of all school districts in the Delta.\n\nTestimony at the Mississippi Delta hearing suggested that it is unrealistic to imagine that the private academies would ever be closed, leading to an integration of the public and private school systems. Dr. Mullins remarked:\n\nI don't think that you can do that. I think that [it is] unrealistic to think of doing that. I think it's a waste of energy to even try to attempt to do that. The way you address that problem is to make your public schools as good as you can make them . . . These are private entities and you start trying to interfere in their business, I think you'll see a backlash that will hurt throughout the communities.\n\nDr. Love concurred with this testimony, adding that if the predominantly black public schools improve, it might sway some white students to attend. However, Dr. Love cautioned that the integration would likely be modest say, moving a school from 97 percent black to 90 percent black.\n\nTracking\n\nSome argue that even when a school is numerically integrated with both black and white students attending the same school, resegregation can occur inside the schoolhouse walls if students are tracked into different levels of courses.\n\nTestimony at the Mississippi Delta hearing regarding tracking was contradictory. Dr. Hemphill testified that while tracking was a tool used early in the desegregation process, I don't think it happens much any more. According to Dr. Hemphill, there is an accreditation system or a performance-based system that emanated from the 1982 Education Reform Act which was to improve the quality of educational programs and ensure equal access to a quality education for all students:\n\nWe have people in every district evaluating the testing procedures, and we the superintendent and the State Board of Education are extremely serious, and so anything like tracking or those kinds of things that might have once been out there, might not be the best educative program, districts are quickly moving away from that.\n\nHowever, Rims Barber, director of the Mississippi Human Services Agenda, testified that he was surprised to hear anyone say that tracking has been phased out, saying, We call them blue birds and red birds and buzzards, right, but if you're in the buzzard class, you know where you belong, right?\n\nMr. Barber also testified that the closely related phenomenon of ability grouping, or using a test to divide the students into different groups based on academic ability, occurs in many school districts throughout the state. According to Mr. Barber, [i]t may not even be policy any more. It may be just the way the principal in that school works. . . . [T]here is a fair amount of grouping and the lower groups tend to get trapped in it, tend to be the kids who get referred to special education in about the fourth grade.\n\nSpecial Education\n\nThere was testimony at the Mississippi Delta hearing that an agreement had been signed between the state of Mississippi and the Office for Civil Rights (OCR), within the U.S. Department of Education, to address the problem of overrepresentation of minority students in special education classes. After investigating five school districts throughout the state, OCR found significant statistical disparities in the percentage of African American students being placed in special education. Rims Barber, director of the Mississippi Human Services Agenda, testified that while the OCR agreement represented progress,\n\nthe general culture is that certain kids get pushed into the slow reading class and then into the special education class, at a certain age begin getting suspended, and then expelled or put into an alternative school.\n\nDuring the hearing, Robert Buck, counsel for the Greenville Public School District Board of Trustees, also testified that there was certainly . . . a problem with too many students being placed in special education. He said the problem had been acknowledged by the Mississippi Board of Education and that there was an effort to deal with the problem:\n\nThe fact is a lot of students are placed in special education because of cultural problems, environmental problems, as opposed to learning the ability to learn . . . a distinction needs to be made when a child scores low on a test, whether the child is scoring low because of a cultural background, environmental problems as opposed to the inability to learn.\n\nAlternative Schools\n\nApproximately one-fourth of 1 percent of the state's public school students are in alternative programs. However, these students are concentrated in certain grades and geographic areas. There was testimony at the hearing to indicate that some geographic areas had 10 times the normal rate of placements, and that placements to the programs tended to be black male middle school students who are over age for their grade . . . having flunked once or twice. Rims Barber testified that there were racial and ethnic tensions that resulted from this disparity, particularly parents who feel like the system is not treating my boy fairly. There was testimony at the hearing that about half of the students placed into alternative schools are black. Dr. Love, special assistant to the state superintendent, commented:\n\nI would say 75 to 80 percent of those who are in poverty are black. Those who come from broken homes and in some of the worst situations are black, and therefore, I think it's reasonable to assume those who get placed in alternative programs in larger numbers are going to be black.\n\nRims Barber testified that while he did not have definite statistics, the alternative schools that he observed were overwhelmingly black. And according to Judith Browne, a senior attorney with the Advancement Project, a student's race may be a factor that influences a disciplinary decision:\n\nIn school districts across the country, African-American and Latino children are constantly being suspended for the more discretionary offenses, such as defiance of authority and disrespect of authority. These categories of conduct clearly provide more latitude for racial bias to play a part in the use of disciplinary measures.\n\nHistorically, discipline problems in K 12 were dealt with by suspending or expelling troubled students. To address these discipline problems, the State Legislature's juvenile justice committee not the education committee spearheaded the effort to create alternative schools for these students.\n\nAs a result, Mississippi's school disciplinary actions have become increasingly harsh. Ms. Browne criticized the new zero tolerance measures because they often fail to meet sound educational principles and, in many cases, their application simply defies common sense. Ms. Browne added, In many instances these policies are being unfairly used against African-American and Latino children and children with special needs. Indeed, the quality of education that students receive at these alternative schools leaves much to be desired. According to the Advancement Project, [s]tudents at a Mississippi alternative school meet their bus in front of the local police department, where they are disciplined by police officers, if necessary . . . Teachers merely act as monitors. They provide worksheets and grade them but do not explain the work. Thus, there is no evidence that students will benefit from the structure or substance of alternative school programs.\n\nIn addition, the Advancement Project noted, The increase of criminal charges filed against children for in-school behavior has been one of the most detrimental effects of Zero Tolerance Policies. In a recent case, five black teenagers were arrested and charged with felony assault for throwing peanuts and pickles while on a school bus, after one of the peanuts accidentally hit the school bus driver. Such a charge carries up to a $1,000 fine and five years in prison. The students were suspended from school and had their school bus privileges revoked. After an attorney intervened on the students behalf, the criminal charges were dropped, but the students later dropped out of school due to a lack of transportation to their school, which was 30 miles from their homes. In another case, an 8-year-old in Mississippi was suspended in October 1999 for kicking his teacher. The child was not permitted to return to school for the entire year, and he was too young to be sent to an alternative school. According to Ms. Browne, these stories exemplif[y] the extremely harsh disciplinary approach that has taken over in many school systems, and the increasing invocation of the criminal justice system for minor school behavioral issues.\n\nMr. Barber conducted a survey of the alternative schools and concluded that many of the programs are not quality. She reported that one superintendent told his surveying team, I wouldn t put one of my good teachers over there with those kids.\n\nMr. Barber also testified that alternative schools were being used as a dumping ground, and the three principal cities that serve as migratory points for rural people in the area including Greenville, Vicksburg, and Natchez have the highest suspension rates in the state, nearly three times the state average. He also testified that it is extremely difficult to get good baseline data that would enable him to determine how effective the alternative schools were at reducing student suspensions and expulsions.\n\nMoore v. Dupree\n\nIn June 1996, the U.S. Supreme Court considered the voting rights implications of the repeal of a law providing that school district borders be automatically extended when land is annexed by a municipality. In Moore v. Dupree, the Court unanimously upheld a 1993 district court decision that a repeal of Miss. Code Ann. 37-7-611 (1971), a part of Mississippi's 1986 Uniform School Law, failed to comply with section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C. 1973c (1974).\n\nPrior to 1986, section 37-7-611 had provided for the automatic incorporation of the school districts of annexed land. In 1986, the State Legislature changed the law to permit municipal school districts to expand their boundaries only with the express consent of all school boards involved.\n\nThe voting rights issue focused on the fact that annexed residents could decide not to be included in a city school district but would still be able to vote for city council members, who in turn appoint the school board members. Thus, the annexed residents could indirectly vote for school board members of a school district to which they decided not to belong.\n\nThe Supreme Court agreed with the lower court's finding that the state attorney general had failed to preclear the statute as required by Clark v. Roemer. Clark held that a state must identify each change as necessary if the Attorney General is to perform his preclearance duties under 5.\n\nMichael Moore, the Mississippi attorney general, filed an action in the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia requesting a declaratory judgment that the repealer law was in fact precleared. In response, the Mississippi State Conference of the NAACP has adopted a resolution stating its objection to the attorney general's proposed action.\n\nThe Dupree case, which involved the city of Hattiesburg, is not the only example of this phenomenon. A companion to Dupree involves the Greenville municipality and its attempts to annex the Western Line School District. In addition, Jackson County is considering annexing land in South Hinds County, which would effectively merge the Hinds County School District with that of Jackson.\n\nThe legislative purpose in ending the automatic extension of school districts into annexed land is unclear. Some argue the legislative purpose is financial. When an urban district expands into counties and rural areas, the effect is that the urban district takes up the tax base of those outlying areas, making it more difficult for the outlying districts to operate and fund themselves.\n\nHowever, Robert Buck, counsel for the Greenville Public School District Board of Trustees, attributes the legislative purpose of the 1986 repeal to something else: racism. In a telephone interview shortly before the Mississippi Delta hearing, Mr. Buck stated:\n\nThe reason for the opposition to the expansion of school districts is racial in a sense that white parents in annexed areas do not want to send their children to the Greenville public school district. After desegregation, the Greenville school system has been more than 90 percent minority, although the population is about 55 percent black. . . . [W]e believe that the answer is that there was a trend all over the state wherein municipal school districts were becoming majority black and there were annexations taking place in larger areas, including Hattiesburg and Jackson. At the same time, there were people moving out of the municipalities and into the suburban areas in an attempt to escape the municipal public school systems. Those moves were being negated by virtue of the fact that the municipalities were expanding.\n\nAnd Mr. Buck reiterated this position at the Mississippi Delta hearing when he said the following about the motivation behind the 1986 repeal:\n\nThe underlying intent of the legislation was to make it difficult for districts such as Greenville and Jackson and Hattiesburg, where you have fairly large urban populations, and where unfortunately the public school districts are 90 percent black, 97 percent black, and whatever, to make it difficult for those districts . . . to then expand their lines out into the county . . . The motivation behind [the legislation was] at least in part an effort to curb or to control the expansion of what I would classify as urban, largely minority districts.\n\nMr. Buck testified that a single unitary system of education would enhance the education of all the students. Despite economies of scale or other economic advantages that would result from a unitary system of education, the political reality appears to be continued migration of whites out of the urban areas and continuing controversy over the 1986 repeal.\n\nIn February 1997, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled, by a 7 2 vote, to allow the state of Mississippi to continue enforcing the 1986 repeal. The U.S. Department of Justice subsequently precleared the repealer on May 7, 1998, and thus effectively settled the lawsuit.\n\nHIGHER EDUCATION IN MISSISSIPPI U.S. V. FORDICE\n\nBackground\n\nMississippi s system of public four-year universities was segregated by race from its inception in 1848 until 1962, when the first black student was admitted to the University of Mississippi by court order.\n\nThe racial identifiability of Mississippi's eight public universities changed little during the decade following the landmark admission of James Meredith. The student composition of the University of Mississippi, Mississippi State University, Mississippi University for Women, University of Southern Mississippi, and Delta State University (collectively, historically white institutions or HWIs ) remained almost entirely white, while that of Jackson State University, Mississippi Valley State University, and Alcorn State University (collectively, historically black institutions or HBIs ) remained almost entirely black.\n\nMoreover, the racial identifiability of these institutions persists: in the fall of 1996, the on-campus undergraduate enrollment ranged between 75 and 85 percent white at each of the historically white institutions, and averaged nearly 98 percent black at each of the historically black institutions.\n\nIn 1975, the parent of a Jackson State University student brought suit, claiming the state of Mississippi had, for decades, underfunded its historically black public universities. The plaintiff also argued that the state had not met the Brown v. Board of Education mandate to dismantle segregated education with all deliberate speed. The plaintiff argued Mississippi's higher education system was in violation of the 5th, 9th, 13th, and 14th Amendments to the United States Constitution; 42 U.S.C. 1981 and 1983; and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000d to 2000d-4a. The United States intervened as plaintiff and alleged violations of the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment and Title VI.\n\nFor 12 years the parties attempted to resolve their differences through a voluntary dismantling of the prior segregated system. Unable to achieve ultimate agreement, the parties proceeded to trial in 1987.\n\nThe respondents the Board of Trustees of State Institutions of Higher Learning (the College Board) maintained that the state had met the Brown mandate by adopting race-neutral policies. The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals applied their interpretation of the standard established in Brown and concluded that the state had fulfilled its affirmative duty to dismantle the former de jure segregated system of higher education through its adoption and implementation of good-faith, race-neutral policies and procedures in student admissions and other areas.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari. The Supreme Court vacated the judgment and remanded for further proceedings, holding that the mere adoption and implementation of race-neutral policies were insufficient to demonstrate complete abandonment of the racially dual system. The Court stated:\n\nEven after a State dismantles its segregative admissions policy, there may still be state action that is traceable to the State's prior de jure segregation and that continues to foster segregation. . . . If policies traceable to the de jure system are still in force and have discriminatory effects, those policies too must be reformed to the extent practicable and consistent with sound educational practices.\n\nThe application of the Brown principles to the context of higher education was confirmed: segregation and discriminatory policies that violate the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment may still exist in higher education even after the removal of a de jure segregated system.\n\nApplying the new standard, the U.S. Supreme Court identified admissions standards, program duplication, institutional mission assignments, and continued operation of all eight public universities as a list of constitutionally suspect remnants of the prior de jure system,\n\nfor even though such policies may be race neutral on their face, they substantially restrict a person's choice of which institution to enter, and they contribute to the racial identifiability of the eight public universities. Mississippi must justify these policies or eliminate them.\n\nOn remand, the district court ordered each party to submit proposed remedies. Without conceding liability, the College Board responded by presenting a detailed proposal for modification of the higher education system.\n\nImplementation of U.S. v. Fordice\n\nIn March 1995, U.S. District Court Judge Neal Biggers Jr. ruled that the state was perpetuating the vestiges of de jure segregation in the areas of undergraduate admissions, institutional mission assignments, funding, equipment availability, library allocations, program duplication, land grant programs, and number of universities.\n\nJudge Biggers ordered the state to spend more money to improve its historically black public universities. First, diversity scholarships would be funded to attract white students:\n\nIn 1997 and 1998, each historically black institution will spend approximately $150,000 on other-race diversity scholarships.\n\nSecond, graduate programs would be added at Alcorn State and Jackson State:\n\nFor Alcorn State University, the judge ordered the state to create a $5 million endowment, as well as matching grants of up to $4 million, to enhance its Small Farm Development Center. He also ordered the creation of an MBA program at Alcorn's off-campus center in Natchez.\n\nFor Jackson State University, the judge ordered the state to spend $20 million to establish an endowment and new programs in the fields of allied health (e.g., medical assistant), social work, urban planning, and business.\n\nAll these programs have been approved by the College Board and have been funded.\n\nAt historically black Mississippi Valley State University, Judge Biggers did not order the creation of new programs or endowments, but the state still decided to add graduate degree programs in the areas of elementary education and criminal justice.\n\nMany African American citizens of Mississippi heralded the Fordice decision as a major victory. Others, such as Dr. James D. Anderson, professor of education at the University of Illinois and author of the book The Education of Blacks in the South, 1860 1935, compared the rulings in the case to band-aids put on cancer. Dr. Anderson argued that the evidence brought before the court to demonstrate the existence of discrimination and inequality was as persuasive as you'll ever get. According to Dr. Anderson, the people involved in rectifying the situation were able to look at 130 years of Jim Crow and its negative impact on higher education, then address that negative impact with a token remedy, and then just move on. Dr. Anderson believes that the various remedies put into place were like grains of sand on a beach of what was needed to be done.\n\nDr. F. Kent Wyatt, president of historically white Delta State University, suggested that very few people embrace wholeheartedly the Fordice rulings. Robert Davis, associate professor of law at the University of Mississippi School of Law and author of a law journal article titled The Quest for Equal Education in Mississippi: The Implications of United States v. Fordice, said that dealing with the Fordice case and its aftermath has been both a legal and a political process; it s been impossible to reach a consensus on many of the issues involved, and many of the problems involved will probably never be fully resolved.\n\nScholarships Targeting White Students to Attend Historically Black Schools\n\nThe idea of targeting scholarships to whites to attract them to historically black colleges has generated controversy. Janell Byrd, a lawyer with the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund who specializes in higher education desegregation cases, said it was bizarre and ironic that the court favored race-conscious scholarship awards for whites and not for blacks, noting that the federal courts in a recent Maryland court case have said that race-conscious scholarships for blacks to attend white state colleges amounted to unconstitutional reverse discrimination. At least [Fordice] seems to say that it is OK and constitutional to provide other-race and race-conscious scholarships, and that is an improvement over the Maryland ruling, Ms. Byrd said. But in the long run [the Fordice] ruling doesn't seem to connect to the harm of lack of access for blacks to quality higher education that it was supposed to address.\n\nDr. Thomas Layzell, Mississippi commissioner of higher education, suggested that it might be quite some time more than a few years for the scholarships to cause any significant change toward integration, largely because it will take time for the historically black schools to add the professional programs and schools mandated by Judge Biggers. Moreover, even after these additions are made, it will take time for the schools to bolster their academic reputations to the extent required to attract white scholarship recipients. Professor Davis suggested that a degree from a historically black institution currently has a crippling effect on the graduate as he or she enters the job market.\n\nDr. James D. Anderson, professor of education at the University of Illinois, believes that scholarships are a good idea, but asks why they cannot also be used to attract minority students to historically white institutions. Why should the burden for integration fall on historically black schools? Why can t historically white schools offer the same incentives for African American students to attend the historically white institutions? he asked.\n\nHoward University Law School professor Ken Tollett Sr. appears to agree with Dr. Anderson, saying the Fordice decision gives no consideration to the enhancement of schools for blacks. It all has to do with attracting more whites to black schools. I haven't seen anything about how to bring more black students in to white schools. The whole premise of the analysis is subtly white supremacist.\n\nSchool Closings and Mergers\n\nJudge Biggers stopped short of ordering the closing of Mississippi Valley State University (MVSU), whose enrollment is overwhelmingly black, and merging it with predominantly white Delta State University (DSU), as the state had proposed. Moreover, the judge directed in his ruling that the Mississippi College Board undertake further study of any available educationally sound alternatives to the proposed consolidation of the two schools. The resulting report, titled Transformation Through Collaboration: Desegregating Higher Education in the Mississippi Delta, which was issued in March 1996, concludes that:\n\ndesegregated higher education in the Delta is not contingent upon consolidation of DSU and MVSU. Less drastic, more practicable and educationally sound alternatives are available. These alternatives can, over time, promote quality desegregated education where choice of institutions and success in them is not dependent upon race. . . .\n\nThere is clearly disagreement within the Mississippi educational community regarding closings and mergers of schools. On one hand, there is pressure to expand upon the current system by creating university satellite centers throughout the state. One such center is being developed in Greenville, Mississippi. Moreover, Dr. Layzell indicated that there is enormous pressure to expand such programming to the Mississippi Gulf Coast as well, as that is the fastest growing area in the state. Dr. William Sutton, president of historically black Mississippi Valley State University, testified that such centers are being opened throughout the state to enable full-time working residents to also attend college.\n\nOn the other hand, others argue that satellite centers are not necessary and that some of the eight public universities should be merged or consolidated. Robert Davis, professor of law at the University of Mississippi, argued against satellite centers because the state education system should not be driven by a goal for economic support. He believes the state university system can be supportive of the economy by producing highly skilled workers for businesses that want to locate to the state, adding that he has talked to business leaders and companies that have decided against locating to Mississippi because of the poor quality of education available in the state. Professor Davis wrote:\n\nThere is no reason for the State to attempt to continue the financing of eight universities. Mississippi currently funds fifteen two-year colleges and eight four-year colleges. Mississippi is the poorest state in the country and the least able to fund the schools that it supports. The State should work toward reducing the number of junior and senior colleges. This can be accomplished through merger, consolidation and closure.\n\nProfessor Davis reported that at the law school where he teaches, the University of Mississippi, which draws students from all of the state's public universities, the general quality of education and level of preparation are mediocre at best. He suggested that the focus of the Fordice litigation has been on preserving certain interests today rather than the quality of education 20 years from now. He believes that radical changes are necessary to improve the quality of Mississippi's system of higher education, and says that the current course of action spurred by the court in Fordice will result in insignificant changes:\n\nWhat I see happening 25 years from now is we will continue to tinker with improvements at a variety of institutions. We will tinker with attempting to get white students to attend Mississippi Valley State. . . . Or we will continue to tinker with improving Jackson State. . . . But the system remains and these choices that have been made historically by African American students and majority students, I don't see how the tinkering that [Higher Education Commissioner Thomas Layzell] seems to be satisfied with will make any major adjustment to how our students exercise their choices, given the options.\n\nProfessor Davis argued that if a consolidation approach is not given serious thought and study, the problem will continue to present itself as we deal with ill-prepared students from our undergraduate institutions. Specifically, he envisions a unitary, statewide system where some of the current universities could be used as branch campuses, but where duplication, waste, and inefficiency can be eliminated. According to Professor Davis, this waste includes eight college presidents . . . and all the attend[ant] administrative costs that go along with that. Professor Davis argued that while such a move would be more costly initially, it would lead to cost savings in the long run. Besides, he argued, even if consolidation did not yield a monetary savings, it should still be implemented in order to improve the quality of education and to bring about the kind of quality . . . product that I think we all would be interested in seeing here.\n\nThe chairperson of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, Dr. Mary Frances Berry, asked whether it is possible that the state of Mississippi was attempting to support too many public universities, diluting the quality of the education being provided. Dr. Berry said:\n\nHow in the world does the state of Mississippi have enough money to keep eight first-rate institutions of higher education going, when most states can t even keep one going? . . . I mean, are we seeing here simply a perpetuation of the inequities of the past and a sort of dumbing down of higher education in Mississippi to meet the requirements of what you can fund, and side stepping the whole issue of desegregation?\n\nDr. Berry asked whether merging Delta State and Mississippi Valley State universities would result in the creation of a first-rate institution and asked whether it is racial divide and politics that are preventing such a merger. Dr. Thomas Layzell, the commissioner of higher education, replied that, in America, politics always plays a role in higher education and that, besides, the consultants who looked at the issue of merging the two institutions determined that such a merger would be a poor choice from both an economic and educational standpoint. Dr. Layzell said the issue of merger within the state of Mississippi is dead, it's over with . . . we're moving on. We've got eight institutions.\n\nRather than concentrating on merging institutions, Dr. Layzell said, the College Board s view is to make each one of these eight institutions the best it can be at what it does. And this conclusion was reflected in a June 1998 order of the district court, following a status conference on the Fordice case. The order stated that the court will no longer consider the merger of Mississippi Valley State University and Delta State University, since the Board has stated to the court that this merger is not now deemed practical by the Board.\n\nSome have argued that school mergers and closings are more political than legal in nature, and therefore should be decided by the Legislature rather than the courts. Mark Musick, president of the Southern Regional Education Board, an accrediting organization, said one thing that Judge Biggers ruling showed was that federal courts can be as reluctant as state legislatures and governors to close universities and colleges: there are 38 historically black, publicly financed universities or colleges in the 19 states that once had segregated higher education systems, and in the last two decades of desegregation efforts, none has been closed.\n\nRobert Kronley, the primary author of Transformation Through Collaboration: Desegregating Higher Education in the Mississippi Delta, in explaining why the study recommended against consolidating Delta State University (DSU) and Mississippi Valley State University (MVSU), painted a picture of schools with very different faculty and student populations:\n\nMVSU s student body is nearly 99 percent black, compared with DSU, which is approximately 26 percent black.\n\nMVSU s entering class has lower ACT high school achievement test scores.\n\nMVSU s students come from lower economic circumstances.\n\nThe faculties of the two institutions are different in terms of [educational] degrees attained.\n\nMoreover, Mr. Kronley reported that he had reviewed testimony from the president of DSU which essentially said that were the institutions consolidated, it would be very, very difficult for many of the students traditionally admitted to Valley to thrive and . . . graduate at [DSU]. Finally, Mr. Kronley studied the financial consequences of combining the institutions and concluded that it would cost significantly more money to consolidate than it would to invest in upgrading both institutions pursuant to the final recommendations of his report.\n\nWhile opposing outright consolidation, however, Mr. Kronley and his team of researchers do advocate something he calls a Delta student. Mr. Kronley defines such a student as one who would enroll at any institution, whether it s a community college or a four-year institution in the Delta, but she would be able to avail herself of whatever resources were present at any of them. So it would be almost a common market of courses of opportunity to students throughout the Delta. . . .\n\nIncreased Admissions Standards for Historically Black Schools\n\nJudge Biggers decision imposes the same admissions standards for all of Mississippi s institutions of higher education. The new standards evaluate students on a blend of high school grades, class rank, teacher evaluations, and scores on standardized American College Tests (ACT). For years, admission was almost solely tied to ACT scores, a minimum of 15 (the top score is 36) at historically black universities and 18 at the five historically white institutions. Differential admissions standards, according to the district court, resulted in the channeling effect described in Fordice, which helped to maintain a racially dual system.\n\nUnder Judge Biggers decision, high school graduates with at least a 3.2 GPA can gain automatic admission to any of Mississippi's eight universities. Those with at least a 2.5 GPA must score 16 or higher on the ACT. Students with a 2.0 GPA must score 18 or higher on the ACT.\n\nThe new admissions standards were challenged, but the U.S. Supreme Court refused to block their enactment. Critics argued that their impact would be dramatic: Fordice plaintiff attorney Alvin Chambliss Jr. predicted that the higher standards would cause freshmen enrollments to drop 50 percent at Jackson State, Mississippi Valley State, and Alcorn State universities in 1996 1997; he said the new standards would put the black schools behind 50 years. Robert Kronley argued that the raised admissions standards put minority students at great risk.\n\nProponents, on the other hand, saw the new standards as an effective and immediate means to rid the state of one of the vestiges of segregation differential admissions requirements identified by the Supreme Court, as well as an opportunity to align Mississippi's universities with national and regional trends toward higher standards.\n\nThe new standards were implemented in the fall of 1996. It has been reported by the Southern Education Foundation that between fall 1995 and fall 1996, full-time black freshman enrollment at Mississippi's public universities dropped by 463 students, and most of the decline was at the three historically black universities: the number of black freshmen dropped by 12 percent at Alcorn State, by 24 percent at Jackson State, and by 27 percent at Mississippi Valley State. The foundation also reported, however, that this decline has been partially offset by increasing numbers of black freshmen enrolling at traditionally white institutions, as well as a 7.3 percent increase in the overall number of black students in the state's university system. In a June 1998 order of the district court, following a status conference on the Fordice case, the court ordered the university to monitor the various elements that affect freshman enrollment and advise the court of its findings.\n\nDr. Elias Blake Jr., a consultant to the Fordice plaintiffs and director of the Washington, D.C.-based Benjamin E. Mays Center, said that what is needed is a way to overturn this new legal doctrine that you can obey the mandates of Brown v. Board of Education for desegregation by increasing and perpetuating the historic denial of equal access to higher education and making opportunities for Black youth less equal. According to Dr. Blake, formerly the president of Clark College, a black college in Atlanta, If [Fordice] stands, [it] will be a new kind of Plessy v. Ferguson. In Plessy, Blacks got legalized segregation that increased inequality of opportunity. . . . [The Fordice] opinion allows desegregation in higher education to be made the enemy of equality and opportunity.\n\nOthers disagree with this assessment. For example, Dr. Leonard Haynes, a black college alumnus who serves as senior assistant to the president at American University in Washington, D.C., said he was confident that national education reform could equalize educational opportunities for students of color in K 12. If the K 12 system improves itself, implementing uniform admissions standards in Mississippi s universities won't be a problem, said Dr. Haynes, formerly the assistant secretary for postsecondary education during the Bush administration. However, according to Robert Kronley, there are some real questions in the Mississippi Delta about whether public schools currently offer curriculum of sufficient quality to prepare students to meet the higher standards. More importantly, said Mr. Kronley, there is nothing in the current plan that calls for systematic cooperation between K 12 education and higher education to ensure that there will be a change in the current situation.\n\nDr. F. Kent Wyatt, president of historically white Delta State University, said he did not see any reason to be concerned about the changes made with respect to admissions standards. He said the new standards are not stopping any legitimate student from obtaining a higher education, adding that any hard-working, sincere student in Mississippi is going to be able to obtain higher education, whether it be at a four-year university or a community college.\n\nFinally, Robert Davis, professor of law at the University of Mississippi School of Law, suggests that the admissions process should be made far more flexible than the reforms have made it. He argued that some students do not perform well on standardized tests such as the ACT and he suggested that testing abuses might occur which can reduce the scores of minority test takers. Professor Davis argued that everyone should be let into Mississippi's eight public universities. He believes that if newly admitted students are not adequately prepared for the coursework at a four-year school, they will quickly fail out and can attend the community colleges.\n\nSummer Remedial Programs for First-Year College Students\n\nSummer remedial programs in mathematics, reading comprehension, writing, and study skills have been implemented to help students who do not meet the new admissions requirements. Dr. Thomas Layzell, the commissioner of higher education, describes the nine-week programs as allowing open admissions . . . to students who did not otherwise meet the uniform admissions requirement. Students who complete the program can then choose any one of the eight state universities to attend, under the condition that they participate in a yearlong academic support program during the first year of study.\n\nDr. Layzell reported that during the summer of 1996, approximately 210 students participated in the program, with nearly 200 students completing it successfully. He said that while the vast majority of the students attended summer remedial programs at historically black institutions and then proceeded to enroll in those same institutions, a fair number of the students enrolled in historically white institutions.\n\nThe Southern Education Foundation reports that the number of students participating in the 1997 summer remedial program increased to 303 students, of whom 273 completed the program. Blacks accounted for 95 percent of the students in the program. Three-quarters of the students in the summer program 229 of them were enrolled at one of the three historically black institutions. Of the 287 black students who began the program, 208 (72.5 percent) ultimately enrolled in the fall of 1997. All 15 of the white students who participated in the program enrolled in the fall of 1997.\n\nSince the summer program is so new, information is not yet available regarding the graduation success rates for the students admitted through the program. However, Dr. Layzell reported that data suggested that they were doing fairly well in the fall term [of the 1996 1997 school year].\n\nThe programs last nine weeks, and only those students who complete a program successfully will be admitted to a university. Dr. Roy Hudson, vice president for administration at historically black Mississippi Valley State University, said that if the new standards had been in place during the 1994 1995 school year, more than 40 percent of the school s students would have fallen into this new conditional admission category. And, Dr. Hudson added, If that 40% of students who are trying to get into Mississippi Valley State, Alcorn State and Jackson State don't . . . we will lose them, period. Not even to a junior college.\n\nFewer students, of course, would mean fewer dollars for the schools. Dr. James Lyons, president of historically black Jackson State University, estimated in the spring of 1996 that acceptances to Jackson could decrease by as many as 500 students for the coming school year. Such a drop in enrollment would cost the university $2.5 million out of a $57.4 million budget. The decrease ended up being approximately half that amount 257 fewer students enrolled in 1996 than had done so the previous year which still cost the university over $1 million.\n\nOthers question the effectiveness of the summer remedial program as a tool for college preparation. Joyce Payne, director of the public black college office of the National Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges, said the planned summer programs were not likely to wipe out the educational deficits built up over 12 years of black students going to antiquated and substandard public schools. Researchers at the Southern Education Foundation appear to agree, stating that a court-approved summer program will not substitute for a comprehensive educational remedy that will systematically address the poor preparation that many black Mississippians get in elementary and secondary education.\n\nDr. James D. Anderson, professor of education at the University of Illinois, suggested students will be stigmatized by the summer programs. He argued that the way the programs are being set up sends a message to the rest of the students that those students shouldn't even be here. Dr. Anderson believes that schools have enacted similar programs in the past in a way that does not stigmatize students; he said that care should be taken to do the same in this program.\n\nFinally, there is concern about the expense of the summer program. Depending upon the institution, the program costs between $1,900 and $3,000 per student. Robert Kronley, senior consultant to the BellSouth Foundation and the Southern Education Foundation, suggested that:\n\n[A summer remedial program is] not a very great incentive for a kid who comes out of the high school in the Delta to go to take and doesn't qualify for immediate admissions, to decide that she really is going to go down the road, lose a summer job, have to pay money for this program, with the possibility that she's not even to be admitted to institutions.\n\nThe Southern Education Foundation reports that, of the 717 students who were eligible for the summer remedial program for the 1996 1997 academic year, only 218 enrolled because 120 students missed the enrollment deadline and 379 chose not to or were otherwise unable to enroll. States the foundation's report: Critics of the policy noted that students, particularly those from needy families, must work during the summer months and may have limited access to such a summer program.\n\nMoreover, the summer remedial program expense is being added to education bills that families are already struggling with: throughout the 1980s, the tuition and fees increased at both public and private institutions at twice the rate of inflation. In Mississippi, tuition at public colleges and universities is about 40 percent of the average minority income. But while costs are rising, tuition assistance is not. In 1976, students borrowed $1.20 for every dollar they received in federal grants. By 1995, students had to borrow approximately $4.30 for every dollar they received in grants.\n\nThe Appeal of U.S. v. Fordice\n\nIn April 1997, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled on the appeal to Judge Biggers March 1995 ruling.\n\nAdmissions Policies and Practices\n\nThe appeals court said the district court was within its discretion to implement uniform admissions standards among the state's public university system.\n\nIn the failed appeal, plaintiffs made two challenges to the new admissions policy. First, they argued that it would significantly reduce the number of black students eligible for regular admission to the university system, and thereby disproportionately burden black students with a loss of educational opportunity. Second, they argued that the court's reliance on the summer remedial program to compensate for the projected decline in regular admission of black students was inappropriate because the program was untested and incompletely defined at the time of trial. Moreover, they suggested that the summer program is not a viable option for the many black students who must work during the summer to pay for college in the fall.\n\nThe appeals court ruled, however, that the district court was within its discretion to make admissions standards uniform throughout the four-year higher education system. The court noted that the differential admissions criteria of the de jure past fostered both segregation of the races and the public perception that the institutions with lower standards the HBIs were of inferior quality. Moreover, the court said, Fordice does not require that all students who would have been admitted under the prior, unconstitutional admission standards be admitted under the reformed admission standards without regard to the educational soundness of the reformed standards. The appeals court was careful to point out, however, that if the new admissions policy was unable to meet its objectives, then the court should implement an alternative solution:\n\nAs contemplated, the new standards should result in the identification and admission of those applicants who, with reasonable remediation, can do college level work. . . . If . . . the spring and summer program is unable to any significant degree to achieve its intended objectives of identifying and admitting otherwise eligible applicants i.e., applicants who could, with reasonable remediation, successfully complete a regular academic program for whatever reason, then the program must be reevaluated. The District Court's proper retention of jurisdiction over this action indicates its intent to examine this important component of the admissions system once the relevant data becomes available.\n\nA study by the Southern Education Foundation suggests that the new standards have had a negative impact on access for entering black students: between fall 1995 and fall 1996, first-time, full-time black freshman enrollment at Mississippi s public universities dropped by 463 students. Most of the decline was at the three historically black universities: the number of black freshman dropped by 12 percent at Alcorn State, by 24 percent at Jackson State, and by 27 percent at Mississippi Valley State. With this decline, Mississippi in 1996 had fewer black freshmen and lower representation of them in the cohort than it did 20 years before. And recent numbers indicate a continuing downward spiral. Between 1995 and 1999, the total number of black freshmen enrolled at the state's campuses dropped 17.3 percent. And at black campuses, in 1999, 1,588 were enrolled compared with 2,314 in 1995.\n\nHowever, at the same time that first-time, full-time black freshmen enrollment is decreasing, the overall number of black students in the university system has increased by 7.3 percent since the new admissions standards went into effect. It is not entirely clear why this is the case, but the district court has directed the College Board to continue monitoring the various elements that affect enrollment figures and advise the court of its findings.\n\nElimination of Remedial Courses\n\nIn ordering the new admissions policies, the district court tacitly approved the elimination of most, perhaps even all of the remedial courses that had been offered at all of Mississippi's four-year colleges and universities, most notably by the HBIs. However, the court of appeals pointed to predictive data indicating that students admitted with the minimum qualifications required under the new standards are not predicted to achieve a C average during their first year in at least three of the historically white institutions. The court directed the lower court, on remand, to determine if remedial courses are needed to help ensure that students admitted under the new admissions criteria have a realistic chance of achieving academic success.\n\nFollowing a status conference on the Fordice case, the district court stated in a June 1988 order that it approved the request of the Board to continue remedial programs for some fully admitted students who are admitted under the new admissions standards and also for those students who successfully complete the summer programs.\n\nScholarship Policies\n\nThe district court found that basing scholarship eligibility on ACT cutoff scores is not traceable to the dual system and does not have current segregative effects. However, the appellate court found otherwise. The court said that because a scholarship requires a student to achieve a certain minimum ACT score to be eligible for the award, it follows that a student who has not achieved the requisite ACT score will not be considered, regardless of how impressive his or her grades or other academic achievements might be.\n\nThe court ruled this was constitutionally problematic for the same reason the Supreme Court found the use of the ACT in admissions to be so. The court said that just as there may be students who could do college level work yet might be precluded from enrolling in an institution that maintains ACT cutoffs in admissions, there may be students who have outstanding academic achievement that merits recognition apart from their ACT scores.\n\nThe court pointed out, however, that the practice of rewarding academic achievement as determined by standardized test scores is not per se unconstitutional even where it results in significant racial disparities in receipt of awards. Rather, said the court, the use of ACT cutoffs in the award of scholarships raises constitutional suspicion only because of the history of de jure segregation in Mississippi. The court said:\n\nUse of ACT cutoffs does not take place on a clean slate in Mississippi, however. The alleged practice of basing scholarship eligibility on minimum ACT scores flows from earlier discriminatory use of ACT cutoffs and therefore triggers further constitutional inquiry, under Fordice, into whether it continues to have segregative effects.\n\nThe court noted that district court findings and other evidence indicate that scholarships with ACT cutoff scores are disproportionately awarded to white students, and that black applicants to Mississippi universities are more likely to need financial assistance than white applicants. The court observed that [t]o the extent that academically accomplished black students are unable to achieve ACT scores that would qualify them for scholarships at the HWIs, they are discouraged from both applying to and matriculating at these institutions. The court concluded that while the potential segregative effect of the use of ACT cutoffs in determining scholarship eligibility is perhaps somewhat less pronounced than that of the use of ACT cutoffs in admissions, the evidence nevertheless indicated that such potential did exist. The court thus directed the district court to reform current policies consistent with sound educational practices, but added that we do not hold that reliance on ACT scores for scholarship purposes must be eradicated entirely.\n\nIn a June 1998 order of the district court, following a status conference on the Fordice case, it was determined that use of ACT scores as the sole criterion in awarding scholarships has been eliminated. . . . The College Board was directed to submit further information to the court concerning the issue of the educational soundness of the use of ACT scores as a criterion in conjunction with other factors in the awarding of scholarships both at the historically white institutions and the historically black institutions.\n\nThe Merger of Mississippi Valley State and Delta State\n\nThe appeals court stated that all parties apparently have concluded that merger of Mississippi Valley State with Delta State is neither required nor desired. The district court has since held that it will no longer consider the merger of the two institutions, and it directed the College Board to conduct a study of programs that can be implemented at Mississippi Valley State which will attract other-race students.\n\nThe appeals court strongly suggested that simply investing money into Mississippi Valley State will not, by itself, necessarily lead to integration:\n\nThere was testimony that the Louisiana experience with implementation of a consent decree to desegregate public institutions of higher education was not successful in attracting white students to historically black universities, despite investment of over $75 million in new academic programs at those universities. The evidence showed that there was no correlation between dollars expended on new program implementation and white enrollment in those programs. During the six years (1981 87) that the Louisiana consent decree was in effect, white enrollment in predominantly black universities increased by just 1.1%, while black enrollment in predominantly white universities decreased from 56% to 47% of black enrollment in the system as a whole.\n\nThe court of appeals did suggest, however, that well-planned programs which respond to the particular needs and interests of local populations can help to desegregate historically black institutions. Specifically, the court noted that evidence indicated that programs which are not duplicated at proximate institutions, are targeted to local demands, and are offered through alternative delivery systems (such as off-campus, evening, or weekend programs) have had success in attracting white students to historically black institutions in other states.\n\nFunding Analysis\n\nThe appeals court concluded that the present formula used to allocate funds among the different state universities does so as a function of the size of each institution's enrollment, faculty, and physical plant. The court noted that while the formula responds to conditions that to a significant degree have resulted from the mission designations (and consequently results in the historically white institutions receiving a greater proportion of funds), the manner in which the formula does so is guided by valid educational concerns and is not linked to any prior discriminatory practice.\n\nPlaintiffs had argued that the district court should have considered adjustments to the funding formula in two respects, neither of which the court found to have merit. First, plaintiffs argued that the formula should be adjusted for the higher cost of remedial education, citing evidence that a disproportionately high number of black students in Mississippi are underprepared for college and that such an adjustment would encourage the historically white institutions to provide remedial courses and to attract black students and would aid the historically black institutions in providing the remedial instruction needed by their students. The court of appeals concluded, however, that the plaintiffs failed to identify any traceable policy related to the funding of remedial education, nor did they identify any evidence that remedial education as structured under the remedial decree is or is likely to be underfunded.\n\nSecond, plaintiffs argued that the funding formula should be adjusted to take into account the proportion of students at a university who are in need of financial aid. The court of appeals concluded that the funding formula provided funds for scholarships and fellowships (which are only a portion of the total financial aid available to students at each university) on the basis of each university s tuition income. It is clear that the state universities which charge the highest tuition the three comprehensive historically white institutions also generally have the largest proportion of students who have little or no need for financial assistance. However, the court of appeals said the plaintiffs identified no traceable policy concerning the adequacy of scholarship and fellowship funds provided to the historically black institutions, and any potential segregative effects of the failure of the formula to take financial need into account is a function of the socioeconomic status of black applicants, not a traceable policy of the de jure system.\n\nThe court of appeals did note, however, the lower court's determination that the quality of fixed equipment (such as science lab furnishings), technical equipment, and scientific equipment at the historically black institutions are inferior to that at the historically white institutions. The appeals court made it clear that to the extent these disparities are attributable to the mission assignments and have segregative effects that will be reduced by additional funding, then relief may be in order.\n\nU.S. Supreme Court Rejects Further Review\n\nOn January 20, 1998, the U.S. Supreme Court, without comment, turned away the argument that the revised college admission plan and Mississippi s longstanding college funding formula have left in place remnants of the old segregated system. The appeal, which failed, had argued that the state, by not dismantling its structures that maintained its dual system, was continuing not only to segregate, but also discriminate by discouraging blacks from attending college.\n\nJustice Department lawyers had advised the Justices to reject the appeal because further issues remain to be resolved by the lower court. But government lawyers said the nation's highest court may need to review the case in the future.\n\nMississippi Senate Universities and Colleges Committee chairman Hillman Frazier (D-Jackson) said that the U.S. Supreme Court's decision should prompt more discussions among all sides in the suit. The court has spoken. We know what the thinking is of all parties, he said. This is a golde"
