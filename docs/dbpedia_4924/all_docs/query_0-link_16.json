        "text": "As tradition dictates in Mississippi politics, Eddie Briggs, a Republican candidate for governor in next Tuesday's primary, took the podium for his allotted time this week at the 110th Neshoba County Fair, a mandatory stop on Mississippi's campaign trail.\n\nIn front of a mostly white and mostly conservative crowd of fairgoers who sat waving cardboard fans in the sweltering heat, Mr. Briggs began by introducing his family. But before mentioning his own wife, he invoked the name of the current Governor's wife. ''You know,'' Mr. Briggs said, ''Mississippi has the best first lady in this nation in Pat Fordice.'' The crowd cheered.\n\nThroughout the remainder of his 10-minute speech, Mr. Briggs, the former Lieutenant Governor, never uttered the name of Mrs. Fordice's husband, Gov. Kirk Fordice, a Republican. The other Republican candidates here, including the front-runner, Mike Parker, a former Democratic Congressman who has since switched to the Republicans, never mentioned Governor Fordice, either.\n\nThat might seem odd, because when he came into office in 1991 as Mississippi's first Republican governor since Reconstruction, Mr. Fordice was hailed by his party as a forerunner of a new Republican dominance in the historically Democratic South. But now, as Mr. Fordice's second and final term nears an end, Mississippi Republicans are working to hold on to the power they gained in the last decade. And most believe the Governor and his well-publicized marital infidelity and rocky relationship with the state Legislature and the press are better left relegated to the past."
