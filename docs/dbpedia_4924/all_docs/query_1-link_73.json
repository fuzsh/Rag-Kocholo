Even though Mississippi was not one of the original 13 colonies, it is one of the oldest states in the country, joining the union shortly after the conclusion of the War of 1812. Since Mississippi joined the United States, the state has a total of 54 governors. The current governor of Mississippi is Tate Reeves, and he has held the office since 2020. He is a member of the Republican Party.\n\nWhen Was the Last Time Mississippi Had a Governor From the Democratic Party?\n\nSince 1992, the Republicans have been in control of the governorâ€™s office of Mississippi for all but one term.
