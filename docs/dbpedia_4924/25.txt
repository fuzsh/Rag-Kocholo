JACKSON, MS (Mississippi News Now) - Jackson detectives got quite a surprise Friday morning as a drug bust unearthed something quite unexpected; a gun that had belonged to former Mississippi Gov. Kirk Fordice.

Emblazoned on the side of the Glock .40-caliber pistol: Fordice's name, accompanied by the state seal.

It's a find Jackson Police Chief Lee Vance says is rare in their line of work.

"Usually something that's that easy to identify is usually something that they're going to try to move along or dispose of pretty quickly," said Vance.

Hunter Fordice, the former governor's son, said the gun was stolen in Vicksburg nearly three years ago, after someone broke into his brother Dan's truck and stole several things.

"There's no telling how many times it changed hands or what it may have been involved with," added Vance. "You have to step back and wonder if this individual even knew who Kirk Fordice was."

Detectives arrested 39-year-old Delvin Lackey and 34-year-old Kimberly Madison on drug possession and intent to distribute charges Friday.

Fordice served as governor for two terms, from 1992 until 2000.

He had been known as a staunch open-carry gun advocate, even going so far as to carry a personal pistol with him while jogging around Jackson.

Once JPD's investigation concludes, the Glock will eventually find its way back to the Fordice family, a point not lost on the former governor's granddaughter, Emily.

Shortly after news broke of the discovery, she posted about the gun on Twitter.

"I know it's material, but It sure feels good to have this back in the family after being stolen from us years ago," Emily wrote.
