        "text": "Friends star Courteney Cox has admitted her relationship with Irish rocker Johnny McDaid is “better” now they’re no longer engaged.\n\nThe actress broke off her engagement to the Snow Patrol star in 2015 and the pair spent months apart before rekindling their romance a year later.\n\nThe Friends star, 54, is based in Malibu, California, while 42-year-old Johnny lives in London.\n\nBut Courteney insists that despite their long-distance relationship, things are great between her and the Derry man.\n\nShe told Ellen DeGeneres: “He’s not my fiance. We were engaged to be married but now we’re just together.\n\n“We broke off our engagement and he moved to England, then we got back together and it’s actually better than it was before.\n\n“Everything’s better. Not because he’s in London — although I think the distance after that break-up, we were apart for six months, that really showed us a lot. It’s just better.”\n\nThe pair started dating in January 2014 after they were set up by mutual pal Ed Sheeran. They were engaged six months later, before calling it off in late 2015 but by March 2016 they had reconciled.\n\nCourteney said: “I mean, it’s expensive, it’s an expensive relationship, we go back and forth a lot. He’s incredible. He’s also an incredible writer. He writes tonnes of music.”\n\nThe actress, who has 14-year-old daughter Coco from her marriage to David Arquette, admitted earlier this month she doesn’t like calling Johnny her “partner” because it can sometimes cause confusion for other people.\n\nShe said: “He’s my guy, he’s my one. He’s my partner, that’s what he calls it, ‘my partner’. I’m from Alabama, so you don’t really say partner unless you’re the same sex... saying partner is difficult for me.\n\n“I was in Atlanta not that long ago and I was like, ‘Oh, I’m supposed to meet my partner in section F,’ and they were like, ‘Oh, I’m sure she’s going to be there, don’t worry about it.’\n\n“Not that it matters but it’s just a different way to speak.”"
