        "text": "COURTENEY Cox grinned and made a quick getaway when asked if Jennifer Aniston could get back together with her ex-husband Brad Pitt.\n\nThe Friends star, 54, smiled when asked directly about the prospect of a Brad and Jen reunion at the Hollywood For Science Gala in LA.\n\nStanding beside her long-time boyfriend Johnny McDaid, 42, Courteney was asked if her best pal was hooking up with the heartthrob after he attended her 50th birthday party.\n\nFlashing a cheeky smile, she said: \"We gotta go,\" before being whisked away.\n\nJust days after the party, Courteney and Jen jetted to Mexico for a luxury getaway but were forced to make an emergency landing en route after their private jet lost a wheel.\n\nHowever, they eventually made it to their destination safe and sound and Courteney insisted it hasn't put her off flying.\n\nLast month The Sun Online exclusively reported how Brad attended Jen's star-studded bash to publicly announce that they are still on good terms.\n\nThe pair, who divorced in 2005, have been friends for years - but 55-year-old Brad avoided promoting their friendship while he was still with Angelina Jolie.\n\nHowever, their relationship has \"come a long way\" since their split, and even grown further in the three years since Brad split from Angelina in 2016.\n\nAnd the sight of the pair hanging out at the bash sent the rumour mill into overdrive.\n\nSpeaking to The Sun Online, a friend explained: \"Brad and Jen have stayed friends for a long time, but it was awkward for them to meet up when he was with Angelina and because no-one saw them together, people assumed they weren’t friends. They are.\n\n\"They want everyone – all of their A-list mates and their exes – to know they’re on good terms and friendly.\n\n\"Brad coming along to a huge event like that was a public move, but he doesn’t care what people think – he and Jen are friends, they support each other and their relationship has come a long way since their divorce, and even since his split from Angelina.\"\n\nThe two stars instantly became a Hollywood power couple when they met in 1998 before tying the knot two years later.\n\nHowever, things turned sour when Brad met Angelina Jolie on the set of Mr and Mrs Smith in 2003, with the pair raising eyebrows when they started dating shortly after Brad's split from Jennifer.\n\nBrad and Angelina became embroiled in a public divorce battle after their split - particularly over custody of their six children, Maddox, 17, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and Vivienne and Knox, 10.\n\nMeanwhile, Jennifer found love again with Justin Theroux, marrying the American actor in 2015 before they divorced in 2017.\n\nSimilarly to Brad, Jennifer remains on good terms with her ex, with Justin posting a touching tribute to the former Friends actress in honour of her birthday yesterday.\n\nSharing a black and white snap of Jennifer raising an animal horn plaque above her head, showing off her toned arms in a black vest top, Justin wrote: \"Happy Birthday to this fierce Woman.\n\n\"Fiercely loving. Fiercely kind. ....and fiercely funny. [love heart emoji] you B.\"\n\nFans were delighted to see him share such an affectionate post to Jennifer, praising the Hollywood star for being so positive about his ex-wife on her special day.\n\nGot a story? email digishowbiz@the-sun.co.uk or call us direct on 02077824220."
