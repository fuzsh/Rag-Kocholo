        "text": "NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK: Courteney Cox recently reflected on her past use of anti-ageing injectables, openly admitting on March 7 episode of the 'Gloss Angeles Beauty' podcast that \"she messed up.\" The 'Friends' star, who is now 58, confessed that she realized she overdid it with fillers and now refuses to do too much to improve her appearance. Cox explained, \"It's a domino effect. You don't realize that you look a little off, so then you keep doing more 'cause you look normal to yourself.\"\n\nShe recalled, \"You look in the mirror and go, ‘Oh, that looks good'...You don't realize what it looks like to the outside person.\" After \"doing too many fillers,\" the 'Scream' star revealed that she \"had to have them removed.\" \"Thank God they are removable,\" she added. \"I messed up a lot, and now luckily… I was able to reverse most of that.\" Cox went on to share how her approach to aging has changed over the years since then too.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nCourteney Cox looks cozy in grey top and basic jeans as she walks hand in hand with boyfriend Johnny McDaid\n\nCourteney Cox’s ‘Friends’ male co-stars give her Hollywood Walk of Fame induction a miss, here’s why\n\nCourteney Cox now believes in ageing gracefully\n\nOver the years, Courteney Cox has been vocal about her opinions on ageing and the use of fillers. In a 2017 interview with New Beauty, she revealed that she has dissolved all of her fillers and explained why they make her feel more like herself. \"I’m as natural as I can be. I feel better because I look like myself. I think that I now look more like the person that I was. I hope I do,\" she said. Cox also acknowledged that her face felt better without the fillers.\n\nIn another February 2022 interview with The Sunday Times, Cox reflected on her past obsession with youthfulness. \"There was a time when you go, 'Oh, I'm changing. I'm looking older.' And I tried to chase that [youthfulness] for years,\" she said. \"And I didn't realize that, oh shit, I'm actually looking really strange with injections and doing stuff to my face that I would never do now.\"\n\nCourteney Cox reprises her role in 'Scream VI'\n\nCourteney Cox has reprised her role as Gale Weathers in the upcoming horror film 'Scream VI.' The character of Gale Weathers, a determined journalist, has been played by Cox since the first installment of the 'Scream' franchise in 1996. Cox is one of only three actors from the original four films returning for the latest installment, and the only one confirmed for 'Scream VI.'\n\n'Scream VI' was originally scheduled for release on March 31, 2023, but Paramount has announced that the film will now hit theaters on March 10, 2023. Cox recently attended the premiere of 'Scream VI' with her 18-year-old daughter Coco Arquette, whom the actress affectionately referred to as her \"Mini-Me.\" The event was star-studded, and Coco looked stunning in a pretty cherry red tea dress that added a splash of color to the occasion."
