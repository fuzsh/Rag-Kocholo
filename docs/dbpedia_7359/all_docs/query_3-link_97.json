        "text": "Flame-haired singer Ed Sheeran has revealed how he set up his best mate J ohnny McDaid with Friends actress Courteney Cox.\n\nSpeaking to Fleur East on the Hits Breakfast Radio Show, Ed explained that he was instrumental in getting the famous couple getting together having introduced them almost a decade ago.\n\nRevealing his matchmaking skills he said: “I introduced her to my best mate Johnny (McDaid - of Snow Patrol), who I wrote Shape of You and Bad Habits with.\n\n\"He's also godfather to Lyra, but yeah I introduced them like nine years ago. She just invited me round her house and I just kept going round and then one day I brought Johnny and he didn't come home.\"\n\nThe couple began dating in 2013 and announced their engagement a year later, but split amid reports they wanted to live in different countries.\n\nHowever after rekindling their romance they reunited in December after nine months apart.\n\nThe 56-year-old Friends actress shared a video message alongside Johnny, 44, in which they paid thanks to frontline workers in Derry, Ireland, which is where Johnny is from.\n\nThe couple have been conducting a long distance relationship but in the video, it would seem that Courteney crossed the Atlantic to be with Johnny, as the UK countryside provides a backdrop.\n\nEd has known Johnny for years and chose the Just Say Yes singer to be the godfather of his 10-month-old daughter Lyra, who he shares with his childhood sweetheart Cherry.\n\nTalking about becoming a father Ed said: \"It's just new responsibilities isn't it? It's less selfish. You know… If I have like a night out with my mates now it's like planned, and we do it like properly, rather than just having like random spur of the moment thing.\n\n\"But yeah she's great, she's ten months now, almost walking and it's the best. It's the best… It's definitely a shift, you have to completely change your life but it is the best thing that I've ever done.”\n\nThe Thinking Out Loud singer also shed light on being friends with another famous singer, Scottish star Lewis Capaldi.\n\nRevealing that the pair had spoken on the phone almost every day during lockdown he said:\" “ Most of my lockdown was spent on the phone to him. I met him at those gigs, he came and opened up for me.\n\n\"He reminds me so much of myself on my first album… I know how much pressure he's putting on himself and the label's putting on him, and everyone else in the world on his second album.\n\n\"And second albums are so important so we just called a lot, and just we've had long chats about life. He's great… we wrote a tune, and it's actually pretty good.\n\n\"It's not for my thing and I don't know if it's gonna end up on his project, but we definitely wrote a tune that was good.”"
