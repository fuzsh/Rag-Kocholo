        "text": "Courteney Cox’s best friend Jennifer Aniston is “wary”of her longtime partner Johnny McDaid.\n\nDespite the fact that the Friends alum has been dating the Snow Patrol rocker for more than a decade now, the 51-year-old actress is not sure about him.\n\n“Jen finds it really odd that Johnny won’t move to L.A. full time to live with Courteney and insists on living in London,” an insider told In Touch.\n\nThey added, “She thinks the whole long-distance thing after all these years is a red flag. She’s always polite to him, but she thinks he ought to be thanking his lucky stars to have landed Courteney.”\n\nCourteney and Johnny started dating in 2013 and got engaged in February 2014. However, in December 2015, the two called off their engagement.\n\nThey got back together a few months later in 2016.\n\nShe spoke of their falling out while appearing on the Minnie Questions With Minnie Driver podcast in April 2024.\n\n“We went to this therapist to talk about our boundaries – what we could and couldn’t accept about each other. Instead, he just broke up [with me] within the first minute. And I was like, ‘What?’ I was so shocked. I was in so much pain. I also don’t like surprises,” she had revealed."
