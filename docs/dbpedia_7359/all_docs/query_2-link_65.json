        "text": "SHE was the “good girl” of hit US sitcom Friends but Courteney Cox’s life off screen was more chaotic than anything the script writers threw at her.\n\nShe has endured anorexia rumours, a plastic surgery obsession, failed marriage and fertility struggles.\n\nBut at 55, with a new man in her life — and worth €130million — she is back to her best, confessing in recent years: “I feel like I’m 34.\n\n“I feel better than I’ve ever felt in my entire life. I take much better care of myself now.”\n\nAnd now the actress has added reason to be upbeat — she and her fellow Friends co-stars are to reunite for a one-off special.\n\nCourteney, Jennifer Aniston, Matthew Perry, Lisa Kudrow, David Schwimmer and Matt LeBlanc took to Instagram on Friday to announce the shock move with a photo captioned “It’s happening”.\n\nTo celebrate the epic TV reunion, we are running Friends week in The Sun — and today we shine the spotlight on Courteney.\n\nAlabama-born and the youngest of four children, she was ten when her dad, building contractor ­Richard and her mum, also called Courteney, divorced.\n\nA shy child, she dreamed of being an architect, and went on to study the subject before turning her ­ambitions to acting.\n\nShe had her first taste of showbiz in 1984, as the girl pulled on stage in Bruce Springsteen’s Dancing In The Dark video.\n\nRoles in TV series such as Family Ties followed, as well as parts in movies including Ace Ventura: Pet Detective alongside Jim Carrey.\n\n‘I WAS TRYING SO HARD TO KEEP UP’\n\nBut her fame went stratospheric when, having auditioned to play Rachel Green — which went to her BFF Jennifer — she landed the role of neurotic chef Monica Geller in Friends in 1994.\n\nShe spent a decade on the sitcom and also made four Scream movies, before going on to star in TV series Cougar Town from 2009 to 2015.\n\nSuper skinny, during her time on Friends Courteney was plagued by rumours she had an eating disorder.\n\nWhile she insisted this was not the case, she admitted later that she had got too thin.\n\nShe said: “When I was on Friends, there was a period when I was really thin and I thought I looked great. But in retrospect, it was not so good.\n\n“I did not have anorexia, but the press kept writing about it.”\n\nCourteney has also been open about the fact she struggled with growing older in the public eye — and for a period turned to plastic surgery to try to cling to her youth.\n\nShe said: “Hollywood — this business — makes it harder.\n\n“I grew up thinking that appearance was the most important thing.\n\n“That’s kind of sad because it got me in trouble. I was trying so hard to keep up, and I actually made things worse.\n\n“What would end up happening is that you go to a doctor who would say, ‘You look great, but what would help is a little injection here or filler there’. So you walk out and you don’t look so bad and you think, ‘no one noticed — it’s good’.\n\n“Then somebody tells you about another doctor, ‘This person’s amazing. They do this person who looks so natural’. You meet them and they say, ‘You should just do this’.\n\n“The next thing you know you’re layered and layered and layered.\n\n“You have no idea because it’s gradual until you go, ‘Oh s**t, this doesn’t look right’.\n\nCourteney had the fillers in her face dissolved and is now determined to grow old gracefully.\n\nShe said: “I’m as natural as I can be. I feel better be­cause I look like myself.”\n\nIt wasn’t just the ageing process that Courteney had to live out in the spotlight but also the pain of struggling with fertility issues, just like her character Monica.\n\nAfter marrying actor David Arquette, 48, in 1999, she endured seven miscarriages caused by antibodies that attacked the foetus.\n\nStill filming Friends throughout this time, Courteney said it was tough having to put her heartbreak aside so she could keep the audience laughing.\n\nShe said: “I remember one time I just had a miscarriage and Rachel was giving birth.\n\n“Oh my God, it was terrible having to be funny.”\n\nFinally, after two rounds of IVF, Courteney gave birth to daughter Coco in 2004, the year Friends ended.\n\nShe has spoken candidly about how difficult her journey to motherhood was, saying: “I had a lot of miscarriages and I don’t think that’s something people shouldn’t talk about because it’s . . . unfortunate, but it happens.\n\n“I just think it’s important to get things out there so people can realise they’re not alone.”\n\nDespite their joy at becoming parents, Courteney’s marriage to David did not survive, and in 2013 the pair divorced. Finding love with Snow Patrol musician Johnny McDaid healed her broken heart.\n\nShe and Irish star Johnny, 43, were introduced by her friend Ed Sheeran in 2013 and announced their engagement in June 2014, only to call it off 18 months later.\n\nNow they are back together, but not engaged, and living in different countries — she in LA, he in London.\n\nCourteney explained: “We broke off our engagement and he moved to England, then we got back together, and it’s actually better than before.”\n\nShe added: “Yes it is far, but I love London . . . I don’t like the flight home, it’s long, you can’t sleep, I hate it, but we just make it work.\n\n“He has been spending time here and then I go there and we try not to spend more than two or three weeks apart.\n\n“We are not married but it is not an elephant in the room for us, we’re OK.\n\n“Either way, whatever happens we are just focusing on the goodness of where we are.”\n\nJohnny is 12 years her junior, which conversely has made Courteney more relaxed about her appearance after years of insecurity.\n\nShe said: “He’s younger than me and with any other guy that would be the hardest thing in the world, but looks are not that important to him or his family.\n\n“External beauty isn’t even on his radar.\n\n“I used to worry about the age difference, but I don’t think it matters.\n\n“He appreciates beauty, but it’s deeper than that.\n\n“It’s deeper for me too, but luckily I find him gorgeous and extremely sexy.”\n\nReportedly Coco, now 15, was instrumental in getting her mum and Johnny back together.\n\nSources revealed how the teen was gutted when they split and urged her mum to give things a second chance.\n\nIt seems Courteney has a lot to thank Coco for — and now she hopes she can instil in her the self-confidence she herself never had.\n\nCourteney said of her daughter, whose godmother is Jennifer Aniston: “Coco has taught me so much.\n\n“I try to make Coco feel strong and confident by listening to her, listening to her feelings . . . She is incredible.”\n\nBut being the mother of a teenage girl is not without its challenges.\n\nCourteney added: “Sometimes I do wish her shorts were longer.\n\n“But I want to keep an open relationship with her.”\n\nAfter all the ups and downs of the past two decades, it seems life couldn’t be sweeter for Courteney.\n\nBut it wouldn’t be the same without a few bumps in the road.\n\nShe confessed: “The great part about getting older is that you learn so much about yourself.\n\n“Whether it’s through heartache or a good experience, you learn about the tricks you played on yourself or fell back on because you were comfortable with them.\n\n“I just wish I had this information a little sooner. I would have saved myself a lot of problems.”"
