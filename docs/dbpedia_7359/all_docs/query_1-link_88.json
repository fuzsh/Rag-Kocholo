        "text": "Courteney Cox covers the latest issue of New Beauty. To me, Cox still looks like sheâs doing sh-t to her face, but in this interview, she claims that sheâs stopped using fillers and sheâs as ânatural as I can be.â Which isnât the same as actually being natural, although Iâll give her credit for talking about this openly. So many women do too much, and it reeks of insecurity. Cox wears that on her sleeve – sheâs talked openly about knowing that she did too much and how afraid she was of looking old. Here are some highlights from New Beauty:\n\nShe wants to have another baby: Cox, 53, reveals that she “would love to have a baby now” with her boyfriend, Johnny McDaid. “I mean, I could carry someone elseâs egg. I may be one of the older people doing it, but I would love to, with Johnny that is. I know itâs crazy, but I would.”\n\nThe age difference between herself & McDaid (heâs 40): “External beauty isnât even on his radar. I used to worry about the age difference, but I donât think it matters. He appreciates beauty, but itâs deeper than that. Itâs deeper than that for me too, but luckily I find him gorgeous and extremely sexy.”\n\nHer 13-year-old daughter Coco âloves makeupâ and RuPaulâs Drag Race. âShe thinks itâs beautiful artistry and sheâs really good at it. Luckily, at school she can only wear mascara, but on the weekends you would think sheâs going out to a rager at 2 a.m. â eyeliner, mascara, highlighter on her cheeks â¦ I know some people think I should rein her in with the makeup, but itâs a form of self-expression. As long as sheâs not sexualizing herself, itâs really just what makes her feel good. Sometimes I do wish her shorts were longer â Iâm not going to lie. But I want to keep an open relationship with her. I care more about what sheâs watching than what sheâs putting on her face.â\n\nDissolving fillers: âIâve had all my fillers dissolved. Iâm as natural as I can be. I feel better because I look like myself. I think that I now look more like the person that I was. I hope I do. Things are going to change. Everythingâs going to drop. I was trying to make it not drop, but that made me look fake.â\n\nSheâs a good eater: âIâm a really good eater. About four years ago, I found out I have something called a MTHFR gene mutation, which dictates how my body methylates.

As for Coco loving RuPaul and makeupâ¦ thatâs amazing. And sheâs right, itâs best to pick your battles with a 13-year-old. Itâs likely just a phase and itâs relatively harmless and fun."
