        "text": "The glamourous couple were guests at an exclusive tipi party at Delamere Events in Oakmere on Saturday, July 27, thrown by Johnny’s sister and her husband, who live locally.\n\nActress Courteney shot to global stardom in the 1990s playing obsessive-compulsive chef, Monica Geller, in the seminal hit sitcom, Friends.\n\nRock heartthrob, Johnny, who plays guitar and piano for the band Snow Patrol, has been in a relationship with Courteney since 2013.\n\nDelamere Events is a popular wedding venue, offering exclusive use of its stunning lakeside event space at Cherry Orchard Farm on Abbey Lane, which is made of four overlapping indigenous American-style tipi tents.\n\nDirector, Ryan Cartwright, says he had ample warning of his superstar guests, adding: “I was told about six months ago they would be coming, so we had plenty of time to prepare.\n\n“But I wasn’t allowed to tell anyone though, for obvious reasons.\n\n“Honestly, they were absolutely spot-on guests. They were so down to earth, and so sincere.\n\n“Particularly for Courteney, who’s been in the limelight for so long, you might expect her to get a bit carried away with everything.\n\n“But you’d be wrong. You couldn’t meet a more down to earth lady. She was lovely with the guests, great with the staff. They were really chatty, and genuinely just nice people.\n\n“Celebrities always try to come across as down to earth, but it’s so nice when you meet them in their private lives are they’re actually the same.\"\n\nRyan says the business is ‘exceptionally busy’ with weddings and corporate events, and next year is set to be ‘the busiest we’ve ever had’.\n\nIt also throws ticketed public festivals and parties, with their next one, Octoberfest, coming up on Saturday, September 28.\n\nRyan added: “Get ready to raise your steins and don your lederhosen because Oktoberfest is just around the corner\n\n“We're excited to announce that the band is booked, and early bird discount tickets will be available soon.\n\n“Don't miss out on the beer festival of the year.”"
