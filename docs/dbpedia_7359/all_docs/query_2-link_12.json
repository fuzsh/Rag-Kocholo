        "text": "Courteney Cox and David Arquette wound up becoming more than friends after starring in Scream together in the '90s.\n\n\"We met on Scream 1, and on Scream 2 we were kind of on and off dating. And by Scream 3 we were married,\" Arquette told PEOPLE in 2010. By the time Scream 4 came out, the Friends actress and Arquette, who wed in 1999, were already parents to daughter Coco. The Never Been Kissed actor has called the slasher franchise \"sort of an amazing marker throughout our lives.\"\n\nIn 2010, however, the couple announced that they were separating after 11 years of marriage. While Arquette wanted their marriage to \"work out,\" both he and Cox filed for divorce in 2012.\n\nDespite going their separate ways, the exes have remained friends. \"He's my favorite person in the world,\" Cox told PEOPLE of her ex-husband. \"He's my best friend.

He quipped, \"I had to trick her.\"\n\nDecember 1996: Courteney Cox and David Arquette star in Scream\n\nThe costars were both on hand for the premiere of the original Scream.

[He was] like, 'David, you know she likes you and you should really get your stuff together,' \" the actor recalled. \"He gave me a real man-to-man talk and that had an impact on the course of my life.\"\n\nJune 12, 1999: Courteney Cox and David Arquette get married\n\nCox and Arquette exchanged vows at Grace Cathedral in San Francisco.
