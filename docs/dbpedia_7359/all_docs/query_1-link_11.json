I love her. I’ve always loved her.”\n\nBut he wouldn’t be drawn on whether the couple had rescheduled their big day, saying of the night: “Let us win an award first.”\n\nCourteney looked stunning in a simple white shift dress with long sleeves.\n\nAnd she told Us magazine the romance was definitely back on.\n\nCourteney said: “Well, we love each other and we are – yes we’re happy!”\n\nIt was the couple’s first public appearance together since news of their split in December.\n\nMORE:\n\nJust a few months ago Johnny was rumoured to be dating Irish blogger Meghann Scully after meeting her at the Oscar Wilde Awards in Hollywood in February but a spokesperson for McDaid insisted he had not been seeing anyone since his split with Courteney.\n\nCourteney and Snow Patrol star Johnny were then spotted together over Easter spending time in Malibu with Cox’s 11-year-old daughter Coco from her marriage to actor David Arquette.\n\nAfter they were snapped together, Cox’s representative told Us Weekly the couple were making steps towards rekindling their relationship.\n\nThe spokesperson told the magazine: “They really care about each other and they are spending time together.”\n\nMcDaid and Cox began dating in 2013, becoming engaged in June 2014 after a whirlwind romance.\n\nThey were introduced by their mutual friend Ed Sheeran.\n\nAlthough Cox was not wearing her engagement ring at the awards bash, it is rumoured the wedding will be in the autumn.\n\nSources say the pair are planning a wedding in Ireland and have looked at a number of venues including Castle Leslie and Ballintubber Abbey."
