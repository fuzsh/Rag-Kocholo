        "text": "We are all swept up in Sabrina Carpenter's relationship with Irish actor Barry Keoghan at the minute, with fans hilariously fascinated as to whether the Dublin native has told the popstar about Irish customs.\n\nHowever, despite the lyrics of her hit song 'Please, Please, Please', where Sabrina tries to navigate dating Barry due to his 'culture', the pop star is not the first non-Irish celeb to date someone from the country.\n\nToday's top videos\n\nFrom US sitcom icons to British heirs, here is a list of celebs who have been in long-term relationships with Irish people.\n\nJeremy Clarkson and Lisa Hogan\n\nFormer Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson has been dating Dublin woman Lisa Hogan for several years after mutual friends set the pair up.\n\nThe loved-up couple star on Clarkson's Farm together, where they get up to all sorts of hilarious antics as they attempt to figure out country life on Diddly Squat Farm in the Cotswolds.\n\nLisa recently gushed about the presenter to Prime Time's Miriam O'Callaghan, saying: 'He's very, very good company. And he does make an effort to make me laugh a lot, which I really appreciate. And we do get on'.\n\nCourtney Cox and Snow Patrol's Johnny McQuaid\n\nFriends star Courteney Cox is engaged to long-time boyfriend Johnny McDaid. The Derry native makes up part of Snow Patrol.\n\nHe began dating the Monica Gellar actress in 2013 after they met at a star-studded party she threw in her L.A home. The pair briefly broke up in 2015, but got back together shortly after and have been going strong since.\n\nMatt Le Blanc and Aurora Mulligan\n\nThere must have been something in the air on the Friends set! Like his co-star, Matt Le Blanc enjoyed a six-year relationship with Aurora Mulligan before they parted ways in 2022.\n\nThe pair met on the Top Gear set, where the Enniskillen native worked as a television producer. Matt, who was compared to an Irish uncle himself on social media, split with the Fermanagh woman due to their conflicting schedules.\n\nKerry Katona and Brian McFadden\n\nOne of the most iconic relationships of the 00's! Kerry Katona married Westlife's Brian McFadden in 2002 and they had two daughters together, Molly and Lily-Sue, before splitting in 2006.\n\nThe pair endured a rocky relationship, mudded by constant allegations of Brian being unfaithful including sleeping with a stripper on his stag do.\n\nThe Atomic Kitten singer no longer speaks to the Artane man, despite co-parenting their two adult daughters together.\n\nSpencer Matthews and Vogue Williams\n\nSpencer Matthews and Vogue Williams have proven time and time again that they are couple goals. The Made in Chelsea star married the Howth woman in 2018 on his lavish family estate in Scotland.\n\nDespite mocking his wife's Dublin accent, Spencer often voices his admiration for the former model on their podcast. The couple live in London with their three kids together, Theodore, Gigi and Otto.\n\nShaggy and his wife Rebecca Packer\n\nA recent resurfacing of a clip of Shaggy telling BBC Northern Ireland radio presenters that his wife is from Dundalk has shocked the nation!\n\nThe It Wasn't Me superstar explained how his wife, Rebecca Packer, is actually from Louth. Shaggy told Vinny Hurrell and Cate Conway that he regularly visits Ireland with their kids, even calling himself 'half Irish'.\n\nCat Deeley and Patrick Kielty\n\nPatrick Kielty and Cat Deeley are certainly a TV power couple! The This Morning presenter married the Late Late Show host in a stunning wedding in Rome in 2012.\n\nThe loved-up couple share two sons, Milo and James. They live in London, with Patrick travelling home each week to front the RTE show.\n\nTheo James and Ruth Kearney\n\nHollywood hunk Theo James is married to Dublin-born actress Ruth Kearney. The pair share a two-year-old daughter whose name they have never publicly shared.\n\nThey met at Bristol Old Vic theatre school. Theo and Ruth make every effort to keep their personal life out of the limelight, despite starring as on-screen lovers in ITV period drama Sanditon.\n\nThe couple, who tied the knot in 2018, made a rare red carpet appearance together at the Emmys in Los Angeles earlier this year.\n\nMichelle Heaton and Hugh Hanley\n\nPopstar Michelle Heaton married Irish businessman Hugh Hanley after she split from her ex Andy Scott Lee.\n\nThe UCD graduate helped the singer overcome her battle with drug and alcohol addiction, going on Lorraine to speak about his wife's time in rehab. The pair got married back in 2010, and live in Hertfordshire with their kids, Faith and AJ.\n\nConor Gallagher and Aine May Kennedy\n\nEngland footballer Conor Gallagher has been dating Cork woman Aine May Kennedy for five years. The pair are even parents to an adorable chow chow pup named Freddy.\n\nThe Chelsea midfielder, who reportedly earns a hefty salary of more than â‚¬3 million a year, often shares pics of the loved-up couple on social media.\n\nSo, there you have it, there are plenty of celebs who fell in love with Irish people.\n\nFrom the more memorable marriages like the highly-publicised Katona-McFadden wedding to lesser-known gems like Shaggy's Irish connection - there may be something to be said for Irish charm."
