        "text": "Katy Perry & Orlando Bloom\n\nKaty Perry and Orlando Bloom met at the 2016 Golden Globes over an In-N-Out hamburger. Bloom nabbed it from Perry’s table. She talked to him about it, and he fell in love with her quirky sense of humor. She wanted to know if those grilled onions were still in his molars.\n\nA year later, the lovebirds hit a roadblock when a scandalous photo of Bloom with Selena Gomez surfaced. Perry and Bloom put it behind them within a few months. They welcomed baby Daisy in 2020.\n\nKylie Jenner and Travis Scott's Bumpy Ride\n\nKylie and rapper Travis Scott met at the Coachella music festival in 2017. He introduced himself with a kiss, according to a festival attendee. A few months later they inked matching tats. And a year later, they welcomed a baby girl.\n\nThe billionaire beauty product maven and “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” star has had to face Scott being unfaithful to her which almost ended in divorce. It hasn’t been a smooth ride, but another baby on the way brought him home again.\n\nPink V Carey Hart\n\nOn their 12th wedding anniversary, Pink told Instagram that she and Carey Hart would have had 16 years together “if you count the 4 years we spent deciding if we were going to live together forever or kill each other.” The pair met in 2001 at the X Games. They broke up briefly in 2003 but then married in 2006.\n\nThe singer and the motocross racer split, yet again, in 2008, divorce papers and all, she even wrote some songs about it. After 11 months apart, they’ve been back together ever since.\n\nThe Three-Time Breakup of Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik\n\nSupermodel Gigi Hadid and popstar Zayn Malik have been a pair to watch. Not only are they one of the most beautiful showbiz couples, featured on the cover of every leading fashion magazine, but their relationship has dished some serious drama too. This includes three breakups: 2016, 2018, and 2019.\n\nThey met in 2015 and welcomed a baby girl in 2020. When Gigi met the former One Direction bandmember, she walked away from Joe Jonas and dove into a whirlwind romance with Zayn. Marriage rumors yet churn.\n\nHilary Duff and Matthew Koma\n\nMatthew Koma is a musician and a record producer. He met Hilary Duff in the recording studio working on her album “Breath In. Breath Out.” At first, it was a working relationship, but soon they began dating.\n\nBy 2018, they welcomed a baby girl and by 2019, everyone was ogling over the former Disney diva’s wedding gown. The split happened in 2017 while Koma was on tour, but it didn’t last long.\n\nThe Almighty Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez\n\nA secret romance took root playing partners-in-crime in the 2003 gangster movie flop. Rumors took off. Meanwhile, Affleck denied, denied, denied it, saying they’re just “really, really, really good friends.” Jennifer was married to Chris Judd, so PDAs were on the no-fly list. Shortly after however, from 2002 to 2004, they were the hottest couple in showbiz. Thus the birth of \"Bennifer.\"\n\nBennifer broke up big-time in 2004. The split lasted 17 years! A hard pill to swallow, even though we loved Ben and his new Jen (Garner, duh.) Still, as it was written in the stars, J-Lo and Ben would reunite once more. Flashforward and not only are they back together again! They got married in an intimate ceremony in Las Vegas in July of 2022.\n\nBeyoncé and Jay-Z\n\nBeyoncé sat down with Orpah and talked about how friendship is the foundation of their relationship. The pop stars were friends first for over a year. Beyoncé told the media queen, “I would not be the woman I am if I did not go home to that man.” But it was not always smooth sailing. A 2005 scandal rocked Beyoncé's world. It inspired her to write “Resentment,” a song about how it feels. Reliable rumors said he was with Rhianna.\n\nJay-Z responded eventually with his own album. The rapper admitted to being unfaithful and apologized. In the end, surviving it all has made their marriage strong.\n\nCourtney Cox and Johnny McDaid's Long-Distance Relationship\n\nThis couple began dating in 2013. They were engaged and then unengaged. Things were going well for the twosome until they wound up stuck living apart; with Johnny McDaid in Europe and Courtney in N.Y.C.\n\nThe 2020 lockdowns were to blame, but the “Friends” actress and musician joyously reunited at the end of 2020.\n\nPhil Collins and Orianne Cevey's divorce settlement\n\nIt wasn’t the first time Phil Collins and Orianne Cevey broke up, but it was the biggest-ever UK celebrity divorce at $46 million. The classic rock superstar met Orianne in 1994. Fluent in four languages, she worked on his tour as a translator. The 1999 marriage hit rock bottom seven years into it.\n\nThe monster divorce payout didn’t stop him from reuniting with her within 10 years. It took a turn to the worst after the singer sank into squalor. Zero hygiene plus his aggressive behavior ended it for good.\n\nThe Onset of Cardi B and Offset\n\nCardi B and Offset secretly eloped in Atlanta in 2017. They married under Belcalis Marlenis Almanzar and Kiari Kendrell Cephus, which are their actual names. The rappers, each worth about $25M, soon welcomed baby girl Kulture. But then, a year into matrimony, Cardi B ditched her 8-carat diamond ring for a breakup.\n\nOffset apologized publicly, saying he had one wish for his birthday—for Cardi to take him back. By February 2019, the 8-carat rock returned to its proper location, her finger.\n\nHailey Baldwin and Justin Bieber\n\nThe momentous event occurred in private at a courthouse in New York City. A year later, the two celebrated with friends and family. After years of Selena Gomez's drama, Bieber settled down with Hailey Baldwin.\n\nHe broke it off, temporarily, for one last try with Selena. Hailey and Justin prevailed.
