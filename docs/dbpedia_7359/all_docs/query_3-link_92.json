        "text": "Cheeky Ed Sheeran has just let the cat out of the bag on Courteney Cox's relationship - confirming that she's now living with her Snow Patrol boyfriend Johnny McDaid.\n\nEd Sheeran introduced the couple during his time spent in LA last year - and he's clearly happy with his matchmaking skills - hinting that wedding bells might even be on the horizon for the pair.\n\nSpeaking at an exhibition opening in London, Sheeran said:\n\n\"I'm not sure that it's public knowledge, so maybe I shouldn't have said anything - but, yes, they're already living together.\" \"Things are moving fast. He moved in and, judging by the last time I saw them, they couldn't be happier. \"They get on really well and are genuinely good friends, pardon the pun.\"\n\nWhen asked about the possibility of marriage, Sheeran added: \"I wouldn't be surprised, but it's still early days. They certainly enjoy each other's company and feel very comfortable with each other.\"\n\nEd became close to Courteney when he lived in her LA beach house last year - and the pair struck up an unexpected, but awesome friendship.\n\nAside from Ed's musings (seriously, he should go work in celebrity news), The Daily Mirror also reports that Johnny flew out his family to meet Courteney, and the couple enjoyed a romantic break in Venice for Valentine's Day."
