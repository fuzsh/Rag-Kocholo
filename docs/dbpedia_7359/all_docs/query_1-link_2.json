        "text": "\"So three years in, we broke up and it was really intense. We broke up in therapy. I didn't know it was coming, whether I should have or not,\" Cox admitted\n\nCourteney Cox is reflecting on what she learned after her longtime partner Johnny McDaid broke up with her in the first minute of a couples therapy session.\n\nWhen asked about the personal disaster in her life on the Minnie Questions with Minnie Driver podcast, the Friends alum, 59, admitted the Snow Patrol rocker, 47, blindsided her by ending their engagement in a therapy session “about five years ago.”\n\nCox, who later reunited with McDaid, explained, “So three years in, we broke up and it was really intense. We broke up in therapy. I didn't know it was coming, whether I should have or not.”\n\nRelated: Courteney Cox Says She Felt Like an 'Imposter' When She Was Younger: 'I'm Getting Older, I Take More Chances’\n\nThe actress shared that the pair went to therapy to discuss “boundaries” but instead, “he just broke up within the first minute. And I was like, what? We were engaged and I was so shocked. I was in so much pain.”\n\nCox — who called McDaid “an incredible human being” — noted that he had hit his breaking point in the relationship.\n\n“He wasn't trying to surprise me. He was in that much pain in the relationship,” she shared. “There was that much that needed to be dealt with that he had to protect himself around his heart.”\n\nThe Cougar Town star revealed the split led her to do “the most work on myself by far,” adding, “I learned how to reclaim my voice, boundaries. What were my motives in life? Like, what was my part in this?”\n\nRelated: Ed Sheeran Sings 'Johnny's Beard Is the Shape of You' for Courteney Cox and Johnny McDaid's 10th Anniversary\n\nCox said she was “so thankful for that breakup” because “when we got back together, it was a different relationship, but also because it really taught me how I operated in the world.”\n\nShe continued: “What were the things from my childhood that I needed? Like whether it was to be adored by men or things that I didn't know how to let go to be in a relationship. To not take things personally, my boundaries. I just went into myself and I had a great therapist.”\n\nCox and McDaid started dating in late 2013. They got engaged nine months later but called it off in late 2015. They reconciled the following year but have not gotten re-engaged.\n\nRelated: Courteney Cox Says She 'Expected' Daughter Coco to 'Need' Her More After Leaving for College\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nThe Homecourt founder said she understood McDaid’s decision to break up with her, explaining, “It takes a lot of bravery to end something that has so much passion or end anything. Any kind of relationship. It's so much easier just to stay and ride things out and make excuses and, you know, fear of pain is just too much to handle. But once you are bold enough to make decisions and go through the pain, you can't go around it.”\n\nCpx added that she encourages others — including her daughter Coco, whom she shares with ex-husband David Arquette — to deal with problems directly, no matter how difficult.\n\n“I'm thankful that Johnny was so bold and brave because it was life-changing for me and I'm sure for him,” she concluded.\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
