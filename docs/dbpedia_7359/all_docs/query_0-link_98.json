        "text": "Courteney Cox looked more loved-up than ever on the Brit Awards red carpet as she made a rare appearance with her beau Johnny McDaid.\n\nFriends actress Courteney, 57, and Snow Patrol rocker Johnny, 45, cosied up together as they posed for the camera on the BRITs red carpet for the event on Tuesday 8 February.\n\nThe pair have been together on and off since being introduced by Ed Sheeran back in 2013. They have since been engaged, however, decided to cancel their wedding plans.\n\nThe couple live separately and split their time between the US and UK which meant they didn't physically see each other for months during the pandemic.\n\nDespite their unconventional set-up, Courteney and Johnny seemed stronger than ever as they appeared on stage to present an award during the ceremony, hosted at the O2 Arena.\n\nBut how did they get to this point? Let's take a look...\n\nGet exclusive celebrity stories and fabulous photoshoots straight to your inbox with OK!'s daily newsletter . You can sign up at the top of the page.\n\nThe couple have had an on-off romance, starting when they first embarked on a relationship in 2013 after being introduced by mutual friend Ed Sheeran.\n\nIn a 2013 interview with OMG! Insider, Courteney Cox and Johnny McDaid's mutual friend Ed Sheeran took credit for their romance. \"My housemate [McDaid] who I've lived with for a year, I introduced him to Courteney Cox,\"\n\nIn 2019, Courteney told The Guardian that her first kiss with McDaid was the best of her life. \"I, actually, was the person who kissed first,\" she recalled. \"Ed Sheeran brought him over to my house one Sunday.\"\n\nAt the time the papers were convinced it was Ed that was dating Courteney and the tabloids were full of false reports.\n\nAfter a whirlwind love story, the pair got engaged after Johnny asked permission from Courteney's then ten-year-old daughter Coco before he got down on one knee at Jennifer Aniston's house.\n\n\"They made a plan to count down from three, and when they got to one, he was gonna get down on his knee and say, 'Will you marry me?'\" \"And she was gonna say, 'Will you marry him?'\"\" Courtney revealed on Jimmy Kimmel.\n\nHowever, an overeager Coco \"kept jumping the gun\" and repeatedly shouted out \"Three!\" way before her cue.\n\nJohnny also showed his commitment by getting her initials tattooed on his arm, but the couple had called off their wedding plans by the end of 2015.\n\nAlso in 2015, Johnny wrote some songs for Courteney's film Just Before I Go which also starred her ex-husband David Arquette with whom she shares her daughter Coco.\n\nDuring an appearance on Wendy Williams' talk show, David called Johnny \"amazing\" and \"a great man.\"\n\nCourtney described their split as \"brutal,\" and she recalled coming to the realization that she \"didn't know how to regard love the way Johnny does\" amid rumours he wanted a quieter, less social life than her.\n\n\"I definitely have learned a lot, and no matter what, I will be a better person from that breakup,\" she said.\n\nHowever, after going through a rocky patch, the couple reunited the following year, and have gone from strength to strength ever since.\n\nIn 2017, Courteney told NewBeauty that she wanted to have a child with Johnny McDaid. \"I would love to have a baby now,\" she said. \"I mean, I could carry someone else's egg. I may be one of the older people doing it, but I would love to, with Johnny that is.\"\n\nUnconventionally, they chose to live on separate continents and each travel back and forth between the UK and the US.\n\nDue to COVID travel restrictions, the couple went months without physically seeing each other last year.\n\n\"I just miss his physical touch,\" she said during a virtual appearance on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show.\" \"It's been hard. This is the longest time.\"\n\nLast year, Courteney also shared a rare gushing tribute to her beau on her Instagram page for his birthday.\n\n\"Happy Birthday to my best friend and love,\" she wrote. \"He's the kindest, most patient, best listener, curious, caring.\n\n\"Not to mention talented and gorgeous partner. I love you jmd. x,\" the actress added.\n\nWhile they are still unmarried, when People was asked whether the couple had an actual wedding ceremony, Johny responded by saying that they \"have one every morning when we look at each other.\""
