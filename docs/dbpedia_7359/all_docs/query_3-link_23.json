        "text": "Friends star Courteney Cox and Snow Patrol guitarist Johnny McDaid looked happy in love as they stepped out in New York for a date night.\n\nThe Scream star was spotted Tuesday night alongside her longtime partner as they grabbed a bite to eat. The 59-year-old looked stunning in a casual look as she paired a white t-shirt and jeans combination with a denim jacket. She accessorised the outfit with a cross-over black purse and white trainers. She completed the look with a pair of stylish sunglasses.\n\nJohnny, 47, also went for the dressed down look as he opted for an all black look, including a black leather jacket over the top of a zipped hoody.\n\nThe American actress and Brit musician have been dating since 2013. By 2014, they had announced their engagement. Despite things taking a downward turn and their engagement later being called off, the pair have remained an item - and look closer than ever.\n\nCourteney first met Johnny at a party in Los Angeles when they were introduced by mutual friend Ed Sheeran.\n\nThe actress was previously wed to Scream co-star David Arquette. The duo were married between 1999 and 2010 and share daughter Coco, 19 - to whom Jennifer Aniston is her godmother.\n\nIn April, David opened up about their marriage, saying he felt \"inferior\" at times. He said her mammoth earnings during the height of her Friends fame was a struggle for him as she earned up to $1million per episode for her portrayal of Monica Geller in the iconic sitcom.\n\nDavid, who was by no means failing in his career during their marriage, said her success was \"difficult\" to swallow as he desperately wanted to be the one to \"pick up the check\".\n\nHe told Andy Cohen Live at the time: \"In the acting world in general, you're always going on this rollercoaster of popularity and, you know, not able to get a job... so, it's like this weird thing.\n\n\"And then, when you're, you know, comparing yourself to someone who's at the, you know, top of the television, iconic world, it's kinda hard to put yourself there, so there was definitely, like, learning and dealing with that and a lot of pain and, you know, arguments or, you know, ego, early on.\""
