        "text": "When it comes to the cutest couples of all time Courteney Cox and Snow Patrol's Johnny McDaid are right up there.\n\nFor Christmas 2022 it looks like the pair packed their bags and headed to our shores where they tried to lay low but of course, this didn't go as planned.\n\nThe pair have been together since 2013 and at one point were engaged. They broke off their engagement but a few months later they were back together- when it's meant to be, it's meant to be.\n\nWhile Johnny is originally from Derry, the couple decided to hang out with family in Donegal. According to the Donegal Daily, the couple popped into the Boathouse Restaurant in Moville for a meal during their visit.\n\nWe would say staff had to look twice when they saw Courteney walk in! The restaurant posted a snap of them enjoying dinner and wrote, 'delighted to have Courteney Co, Johnny McDaid and family come to visit the Boathouse last night.'\n\nEnjoying an intimate family meal, the couple took in the local sights including Lough Foyne - certainly different views from what Courteney would be used to in L.A.\n\nThe pair also stayed to welcome in the New Year. They headed back down to Johnny's hometown in Derry to ring in 2023.\n\nAnd as most couples did on the night, they took a shot all loved up and even threw in one where they were giving each other a smooch as the bells tolled.\n\nThe Friend's star told fans she wasn't in the states and wished everyone a 'Happy GMT new year,' followed by white heart emojis.\n\nThis is not the first time the Hollywood star has graced our shores. Over Christmas of 2021 the couple were reported to have been spotted in Galway.\n\nIt was believed that they enjoyed a couple of nights at Lough Cutra Castle which is located on the outskirts of the Southern Galway town, Gort.\n\nEven though the couple had split in the past it seems now that nothing can keep these two apart.\n\nCovid had put a spanner in the works as they were separated by continents due to restrictions but as they say, absence makes the heart grow fonder and it seemed to work for the couple."
