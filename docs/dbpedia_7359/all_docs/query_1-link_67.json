        "text": "Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn have been together since 1983, have one son, and raised Goldie's children from her previous marriage (Oliver and Kate Hudson!) together. \"We have done just perfectly without marrying,\" Goldie told Woman's Day in 2007. \"I like waking up every day and seeing that he is there and knowing that I have a choice. There is really no reason to marry.\"\n\nAfter meeting in 1986 and getting engaged in 1993, Oprah and Stedman refer to their relationship as a \"spiritual partnership.\" \"The moment after I said yes to his proposal, I had doubts. I realized I didn't actually want a marriage. I wanted to be asked,\" Oprah wrote in a column for O, The Oprah Magazine. \"He and I agree that had we tied the marital knot, we would not still be together.\"\n\nThe notoriously private couple met on the set of The Place Beyond the Pines in 2011, and have opted to quietly raise their daughters as partners. Eva told Women's Health in 2019 that she hadn't even thought about having children before meeting Ryan. \"I mean, falling in love with him. Then it made sense for me to have... not kids, but his kids. It was very specific to him,\" she said.\n\nOlivia Wilde and Jason Sudeikis announced their split in 2020, and when many heard the news, they were shocked the couple wasn't married. Same! The actors had a seven-year engagement and two children, who they're currently co-parenting.\n\nRose Byrne and Bobby Cannavale have been together since 2012. The couple, who have two children together, refer to one another as \"husband\" and \"wife\" and wear bands on their ring fingers, but they never officially tied the knot.\n\nJack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez are not only the creative geniuses behind fashion house Proenza Schouler, they've been together since their junior year at Parsons School of Design. While they've successfully collaborated on the runway, they aren't married. Lazaro responded with a simple \"no comment\" when asked when the couple will tie the knot at \"The Atelier with Alina Cho\" speaker series at The Met.\n\nThe Colombian singer and Spanish soccer star met on the set of her \"Waka Waka\" music video in 2010 and have been together ever since, but they aren't eager to get married. \"We have a union, a love for each other, and a baby. I think that those aspects of our relationship are already established, and marriage is not going to change them,\" Shakira told Glamour in 2014. \"But if I'm ever going to get married, he's the one.\"\n\nThe Bridesmaids star has been in a relationship with filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson since 2001. They have four children and Maya refers to Paul as her husband, but they just never made it official. \"People know what that means. It means he's the father of my child, and I live with him, and we are a couple, and we are not going anywhere,\" Maya told The New York Times in 2018.\n\nAfter meeting at Chateau Marmont in 2007 and more than 10 years together, Leslie Bibb and Sam Rockwell are happy with the way things are—being unmarried. The secret to their strong relationship? \"We have a two-to-three-week rule and then we see each other,\" Sam told Us Weekly in 2018. \"Then you get too independent if it's four weeks, five weeks.\"\n\nThe Sex and the City star and '70s icon have happily made their relationship work since 2002 and don't need rings to prove it. \"I think when you’re beginning a young family and you're going to have children and set up this new family tree branch, it's obviously a wonderful commitment and it's meaningful,\" Bo told Fox News on marriage. \"But for us in our lives, it hasn't been yet.\"\n\nTennis star Anna Kournikova and singer Enrique Iglesias began dating in 2001, after meeting on the set of his \"Escape\" music video. Despite rumors constantly swirling that the notoriously private couple have tied the knot, they haven't. They did, however, welcome their third child in January 2020.\n\nThe Good Morning America host celebrated her 15th anniversary with Amber Laign in July 2020. The couple, who met on a blind date in 2005, were together for years before Robin publicly came out as gay in 2013. \"She's very, very supportive and she's been right there beside me every step of the way,\" Robin told Ellen DeGeneres in 2014.\n\nThey were costars on The Americans and have been together since 2014, but aren't official official. Keri was previously married to Shane Deary from 2007 until 2014, while Matthew has never been married. In addition to raising Keri's two children from her previous marriage, the couple has one son together.\n\nBetween both singers having previous messy divorces and busy careers, it makes sense that Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani have taken their time dating and not rushed in marriage—even if they seem like #endgame. But after years of dating, they finally (!) got engaged in October 2020.\n\nThe real reason Lauren Graham and Peter Krause haven't gotten married? No, it's not because they were TV siblings on Parenthood. They're just happy with how things are. \"I feel like close to five years in Hollywood, it's like, aren't we married already really? It's good the way it is,\" Lauren said on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in 2014.\n\nWhen Jon Hamm got his big break in 2007 on Mad Men, his longtime partner Jennifer Westfeldt was by his side. \"I don't have the marriage chip,\" Jon told Parade in 2010. \"But Jen is the love of my life, and we've already been together four times longer than my parents were married.\" They seemed like they'd be together, unmarried, forever, but sadly split in 2015 after 18 years.\n\nThe actors have an under the radar relationship, despite being together since 2007. In 2018, they welcomed a daughter and collaborated together on the film Wildlife—but don't expect a proposal anytime soon. The actress told The Daily Beast that getting married \"isn’t high on my list, we're not religious. But it's really nice to make a life with him.\"\n\nRicky Gervais and Jane Fallon met in 1982 at University College London and have built their lives together over the past four decades. \"We are married for all intents and purposes, everything’s shared and actually our fake marriage has lasted longer than a real one...but there's no point in us having an actual ceremony before the eyes of God because there is no God,\" Ricky told The Sunday Times in 2010.\n\nIf you thought Diane Kruger and Joshua Jackson were married during their 10-year relationship, you're not alone. I'd filed them away in the marriage folder in my brain before hearing the news of their 2016 split. Apparently, after her divorce from French actor Guillaume Canet, Diane stood firm against the notions of marriage. \"Without sounding pessimistic, I learned that I don't believe in marriage,\" she told Glamour. \"I believe in a commitment that you make in your heart. There's no paper that will make you stay.\""
