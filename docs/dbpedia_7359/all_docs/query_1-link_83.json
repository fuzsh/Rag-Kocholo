        "text": "Jennifer Aniston and Courteney Cox slipped into their bikinis while celebrating the last days of the holiday season in the sun.\n\nAniston and fiance Justin Theroux were photographed landing in Mexico on Friday (Dec. 27), E! News noted. The couple typically takes a trip south of the border around the New Year and, this time, they brought along friends including Cox, Howard Stern, Beth Ostrosky, Jimmy Kimmel and his wife, Molly McNearney.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Saturday (Dec. 28), the group was spotted lounging poolside in Cabo San Lucas. Aniston and Cox donned their bikinis, while Theroux wore cutoff shorts and a belt. The former \"Friends\" stars looked gorgeous as they soaked up some rays and relaxed."
