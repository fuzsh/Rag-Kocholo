        "text": "Courteney Cox has recalled how she was left in 'so much pain' when Johnny McDaid took her by surprise and called it quits on their relationship.\n\nThe Friends star explained that five years ago, when they'd been together for three years, they went to therapy together and during one session Johnny dropped the bombshell that he wanted to end things.\n\nToday's top videos\n\nHowever, now that Courteney can look back on the experience, she's 'so thankful' that he broke up with her because it meant they could do the work that was needed to have a stronger relationship.\n\nAccording to MailOnline, she said on Minnie Driver's podcast Minnie Questions: 'Johnny and I broke up five years ago... it was really intense. We broke up in therapy. I didn't know it was coming... He just broke up within the first minute. And I was like \"What?\" And we were engaged. And I was so shocked, I was in so much pain, I also don't like surprises.'\n\nCourteney continued to explain that Johnny wasn't trying to 'surprise' her but that he was in 'so much pain in the relationship' and that there was 'so much that needed to be dealt with' that he was trying to 'protect' his heart.\n\nShe said: 'So as opposed to like going \"F*** him\", getting in this mode of anger, I leant in and I did the most work on myself by far. I learned how to reclaim my voice, boundaries, what were my motives in life - like what was my part in this.'\n\nCourteney added that she's 'so thankful for that break-upâ€™ because it taught her about the things that she needed to address and because the couple had a completely different relationship when they got back together.\n\n'It takes a lot of bravery to end something that has so much passion, or end anything,' Courteney continued. 'I'm thankful that Johnny was so bold and brave because it was life-changing for me, and I'm sure for him.'\n\nWhen they did get back together, Courteney and Johnny, who first met in 2013 after being introduced by Ed Sheeran, didn't say they were engaged still but simply 'together'.\n\nThe couple had quite a whirlwind start to their romance as they got engaged in June 2014, less than a year after meeting. By November 2014 they had called off their engagement but were together again by March 2015."
