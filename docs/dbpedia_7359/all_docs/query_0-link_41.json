She’s my best friend. She’s my partner, in everything. When I write her poems, it’s just an extension of how I feel every second anyway, and that’s true for me.”\n\nThe couple explained that they are happy to just be together as marriage would ‘box them in’.\n\n“We get together. That’s our tradition. We don’t really have anything laid in stone because that would box us in. We just get together and see what happens,” he said\n\nCourteney added: “We hang out, sing songs, play music, eat and drink … and be together.”\n\nCourteney was previously married to actor David Arquette for over fourteen years but the couple split in 2013.\n\nThe couple has a daughter together, fourteen-year-old Coco."
