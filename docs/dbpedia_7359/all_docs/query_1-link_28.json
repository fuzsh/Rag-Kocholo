        "text": "While we may now know everything there is about Friends following the cast’s anticipated reunion – the stars themselves have been able to keep their personal lives relatively quiet when they’ve needed to.\n\nWe may have the obvious personal historical happenings, such as Jennifer Aniston’s marriage to Brad Pitt or Courteney Cox’s to David Arquette, but how many of the show’s stars are currently single? Who’s married? Do Ross and Rachel stand a chance IRL?\n\nSadly Matthew Perry answered one of those questions for us already when he confirmed he’d split with fiancee Molly Hurwitz after seven months of engagement, and three years of dating, this week.\n\nBut what about the rest of the cast, eh?\n\nJennifer Aniston\n\nIt would be remiss of us not to note we’re going by information already out in the public sphere on all of this, but it appears Jennifer has remained single – at least publicly – since her 2018 split with husband Justin Theroux.\n\nWhile we can only imagine she’s the epitome of one who’s living their best life, what with her Hollywood mansion and her millions, according to In Touch Jen was linked to a so-called ‘mystery man’ earlier this year.\n\nHowever, so far she’s yet to be seen out and about with this mysterious fella and has, instead, spent her time denying rumours she was set to adopt a baby. Of course.\n\nMatt LeBlanc\n\nAccording to reports, Matt has been dating former Top Gear producer Aurora Mulligan since 2016, after meeting on the BBC show.\n\nThe pair have kept their relationship under wraps, only making a handful of public appearances together – after first stepping out at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2017 – but haven’t been seen together recently.\n\nThe Joey Tribbiani actor was previously married to Melissa McKnight until 2006, with the couple sharing teenage daughter Marina.\n\nDavid Schwimmer\n\nDavid split from wife Zoe Buckman in 2017 and while he’s remained close with his former partner – with whom he shares 10-year-old daughter Cleo – the star is yet to confirm any new relationship.\n\nLisa Kudrow\n\nIt seems a lot of people aren’t aware Lisa married Michel Stern in the second season of the series in 1995. So while we were watching her play scatty Phoebe Buffay, Lisa was pretty settled in her home-life with Michel and their son Julian.\n\nCourteney Cox\n\nPreviously married to fellow-actor David – the pair sharing daughter Coco – Courteney is now loved-up with Johnny McDaid of band Snow Patrol.\n\nThe pair have been dating since 2013 and announced their engagement the year after before then calling it off.\n\nThe actor has been open about their relationship and that while they’re no longer engaged they’re very much loved-up and their pairing has never been better after their reconciliation.\n\nShe previously told Ellen DeGeneres: ‘He’s not my fiancé. We were engaged to be married, but now we’re just together.\n\n‘We broke off our engagement, and he moved to England, then we got back together, and it’s actually better than it was before.’\n\nSadly the coronavirus pandemic threw a spanner in the works and Courteney was separated from Johnny, who was stuck overseas after being stranded amid lockdown while the Monica Geller star was marooned in California.\n\nMatthew Perry\n\nAs previously explained, Matthew announced he and Molly had split after sharing in November 2020 that the pair were going to tie the knot after three years of dating.\n\n‘Sometimes things just don’t work out and this is one of them,’ the Chandler Bing actor said in a statement this week.\n\nHe added to People: ‘I wish Molly the best.’\n\nThe Friends reunion is available to watch on NowTV.\n\nMORE : Friends fans can’t get over Matt LeBlanc soaking up applause during reunion special"
