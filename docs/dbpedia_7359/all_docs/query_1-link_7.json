        "text": "This may be confusing to some, but Courteney Cox would rather call Johnny McDaid her “guy” or her “one” rather than her “partner.” During a Monday appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Cox opened up about her relationship with the Snow Patrol musician and attempted to clarify the status of their romance after Jimmy Kimmel asked about Cox’s “man friend.”\n\n“My man friend?” Cox replied. “That’s good. I don’t know if that would go over very well.” She opened up further by revealing McDaid uses the term “partner,” but it’s not her favorite word to describe the man she’s been romantically linked to since 2014 (they also got engaged that same year).\n\n“He’s my partner,” she said, before adding, “That’s what he calls it, my partner. And I’m from Alabama, so you don’t really say partner unless you’re in the same sex.”\n\nCox said she has experienced confusion when calling McDaid her “partner,” so it’s easier and better for her to use something along the lines of “my guy” or “my one.”\n\nShe explained to Kimmel, “I was in Atlanta not that long ago and I was like, ‘Oh, I’m supposed to meet my partner in section F,’ and they were like, ‘Oh, I’m sure she’s going to be there; don’t worry about it.’ Not that it matters, but it’s just a different way to speak.” Cox then added, “He’s my guy, he’s my one, but saying partner’s difficult for me.”\n\nEven though “partner” is apparently hard for Cox to use, it sure sounds like the two are in a committed partnership. She revealed to Kimmel that they even spent New Year’s together in England — with her daughter, Coco Arquette, in tow.\n\nCox and McDaid have encountered a lot of ups and downs in their relationship. They called off their engagement in 2015, but the two reconciled in 2016. It’s unclear if they are once again engaged, especially since Cox was wearing a ring on that finger while chatting with Kimmel.\n\nWhatever the case, during an appearance on NBC’s Running Wild With Bear Grylls in August 2016, Cox opened up about McDaid and admitted they worked hard to get back to a good place as a couple and as individuals.\n\n“It’s just… everything’s new,” Cox told Grylls. “And we have both really worked on ourselves on the parts that needed the most attention. And it feels really different.” She later added, “We were engaged for over a year, and then we broke up. There’s something about… you know, he’s from Ireland. And the way he regards love is precious. We have to treat it in a different way. It’s more special. You coddle it.”\n\nIn May 2016, McDaid discussed his love for Cox to People. He said, “I don’t know if you can put a label on what makes us work, but I know that I’ve never loved like I love this woman, so if that’s enough, then that’s enough.”\n\nAnd in a 2017 interview with NewBeauty magazine, Cox revealed her thoughts on having children with McDaid. “I would love to have a baby now,” she said. “I mean, I could carry someone else’s egg. I may be one of the older people doing it, but I would love to, with Johnny that is.”\n\nEven though Cox doesn’t prefer the term “partner,” there’s no denying these two love each other deeply and are committed to their relationship."
