        "text": "Friends star Courteney Cox has opened up on when Snow Patrol musician Johnny McDaid broke up with her.\n\nThe actress revealed that the Derry man ended their relationship three years into it when they were at a therapy session together.\n\nThey got back together, and in September 2023, they celebrated ten years since they met each other - after being introduced by Ed Sheeran.\n\nREAD MORE: Courteney Cox and Johnny McDaid spotted at NI restaurant\n\nREAD MORE: New archive series to air featuring young Jamie Dornan and Rory McIlroy\n\nSpeaking on the Minnie Questions podcast with Minnie Driver, Courteney said: “When I Johnny and I broke up, five years ago... So three years in, we broke up, and it was really intense.\n\n\"We broke up in therapy, I didn’t know it was coming, whether I should have or not, it was just like we went to this therapist to talk about our boundaries, what we could and couldn’t accept about each other... Instead, he just broke up within the first minute, and I was like, ‘What?’, and we were engaged. And I was so shocked, I was in so much pain, I also don’t like surprises.\n\n“And he’s an incredible human being, so he wasn’t trying to surprise me, he was in that much pain in the relationship, there was that much that needed to be dealt with, that he had to protect himself around his heart.\n\n“As opposed to going ‘f*** him’... getting in this mode of anger, I went in and I did the most work on myself by far. I learned how to reclaim my voice, boundaries, what were my motives in life, like what was my part in this?\"\n\nThe 59-year-old continued: \"And I'm so thankful for that break-up because a) when we got back together, it was a different relationship, but also because it really taught me how I operated in the world...\n\n\"I just went into myself and I had a great therapist, I went to the same one. I kept seeing him, the one that we met on the breakup day, and it was brutal to go to his office after that for a while, but then it was great.”\n\nCourteney added: “And I’m really thankful a) nothing will ever hurt me that bad again, and then b) most of all, most importantly, I completely changed.”\n\nThe actress also said: “It takes a lot of bravery to end something that has so much passion, or end anything, any kind of relationship, it’s so much easier just to stay and ride things out and make excuses.\n\n\"Fear of pain is just too much to handle, once you are bold enough to make decisions and go through the pain... you can’t go around it, so just go through it, and then when you do everything is easier...\"\n\nThe Friends star continued: “I’m thankful that Johnny was so bold and brave because it was life-changing for me, and I’m sure for him.\""
