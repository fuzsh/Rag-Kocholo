        "text": "Courteney Cox and Johnny McDaid have been together for more than a decade – except for a few months in 2015 that she's ultimately become thankful for.\n\nIn a recent discussion with Minnie Driver for her podcast Minnie Questions, the Friends alum opened up about her romance with the Snow Patrol rocker, revealing that their brief break up nine years ago, which ended their engagement, blindsided her.\n\n\"We went to this therapist to talk about our boundaries, what we could and couldn't accept about each other,\" Cox told Driver.\n\nWatch the video above.\n\nREAD MORE: Rapper cancels world tour after breaking foot at Coachella\n\nREAD MORE: Taylor Swift's school teachers remember her as a young star\n\n\"Instead, he just broke up – within in the first minute. And I was like, 'What?' We were engaged and I was so shocked. I was in so much pain. I also don't like surprises,\" she continued.\n\nCox, however, then explained that the temporary split from McDaid actually helped her when it came to her relationship with herself.\n\n\"I did the most work on myself, by far,\" Cox, who noted in retrospect she's \"so thankful\" for the brief split, said. \"I learned how to reclaim my voice, my boundaries.\"\n\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, subscribe to our newsletter here\n\nA-lister shares throwback photos with wife of 27 years\n\nWhen the couple did get back together, Cox said, it \"was a different relationship\".\n\n\"But also because it really taught me how I operated in the world,\" Cox said.\n\n\"What were the things from my childhood that I needed, like, whether it was to be adored by men, things I didn't know how to let go to be in a relationship. To not take things personally. My boundaries.\"\n\nREAD MORE: What happened between Italy's most influential influencer and rapper\n\nREAD MORE: Kate's offer to star undergoing chemotherapy: 'She was so kind'\n\nThe couple – who met at Christa Miller's house in 2013 after Ed Sheeran brought him over – is still together to this day, but they're not engaged.\n\n\"He's not my fiancé. We were engaged to be married, but now we're just together,\" Cox said on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in 2019.\n\n\"We broke off our engagement and he moved to England. Then we got back together, and it's actually better than it was before.\"\n\nCelebrities who were engaged for a really long time\n\n\"I think the distance after that breakup – we were apart for six months – that really showed us a lot,\" she continued. \"It's just better.\"\n\nCox, 59, was married to David Arquette from 1999 to 2013. They share 19-year-old daughter Coco Arquette.\n\nAs for McDaid, 47, Cox is the only public relationship he's had on record."
