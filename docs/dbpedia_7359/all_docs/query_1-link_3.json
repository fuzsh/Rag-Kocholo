        "text": "Courteney Cox says she walked into a therapy session and found herself single after just one minute.\n\nThe Friends star shared intimate details about her romance with musician Johnny McDaid, claiming that he blindsided her five years ago during a therapy session they attended to mend their relationship.\n\nCox says that she and McDaid, who have been together since 2013, sought therapy in hopes of resolving their issues. However, the 59-year-old actress says 47-year-old McDaid shocked her when he chose the very start of the session to abruptly break up with her.\n\n\"I didn't know it was coming,\" Cox said on Minnie Questions podcast with host Minnie Driver\n\nDespite the initial pain and surprise, Cox acknowledged the breakup as a pivotal moment that led to their profound personal growth.\n\n\"I'm so thankful for that breakup because when we got back together it was a different relationship, but also because it really taught me how I operated in the world -- what were the things from my childhood that I needed,\" she explained, speaking on the what she learned from the split.\n\nCox emphasized the importance of self-reflection and resilience in navigating the aftermath of such a significant split. She credited therapy and introspection for helping her reclaim her voice, set boundaries and understand her motives in life.\n\n\"Whether it was to be adored by men. Things that I didn't know how to let go to be in a relationship. To not take things personally. My boundaries, I just went into myself and I had a great therapist,\" Cox said.\n\nThe actress also highlighted the courage to end a relationship, acknowledging the fear of pain that often prevents people from making necessary decisions. However, she emphasized the transformative power of facing challenges head on, stating, \"Once you are bold enough to make decisions and go through the pain, everything's easier.\"\n\nCox and McDaid eventually reconciled, though they chose to end their engagement. Cox described the decision as \"strange\" but expressed gratitude for the growth it facilitated.\n\nCox took to Instagram in September to celebrate 10 years of love with McDaid, whom she first met through their mutual friend, Ed Sheeran.\n\nCox posted a montage of photos of herself with McDaid set to the first notes of Sheeran's hit song, \"Shape of You.\" The post ends with a video of Sheeran sitting next to the happy couple, singing a personalized version of the song featuring lyrics, \"Johnny's in love with your body.\" The cute video ends with Sheeran touching the Snow Patrol band member's face and joking, \"Johnny's beard is the shape of you.\"\n\n\"10 years ago this guy [Sheeran] introduced me to this guy [McDaid],\" Cox wrote over the beginning of the photos. She captioned the post, \"10 years!!! ♥️\"\n\nCox was previously married to David Arquette, with whom she shares daughter Coco. Their marriage lasted from 1999 to 2003.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nCourteney Cox Breaks Silence on Matthew Perry's Death With Favorite 'Friends' Moment\n\nAngela Bassett Jokes She'll Need Therapy After Sending Her Twins to College (Exclusive)\n\n'Love Is Blind': Chelsea Says Show Helped Her Seek Therapy\n\nJustin Timberlake and Jessica Biel Do Therapy Check-Ins (Source)\n\nTom Schwartz Says Regaining Trust With Tom Sandoval Feels Like ‘Couple’s Therapy’ (Exclusive)"
