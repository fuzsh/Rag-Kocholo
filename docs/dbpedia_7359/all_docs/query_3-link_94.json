It is understood she will be a bridesmaid in the wedding party as well.\n\nThe Snow Patrol star began dating Courteney back in September 2013 after reportedly being introduced by singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran.\n\nThey made their relationship official in January 2014 and began making numerous public appearances together at events throughout the year."
