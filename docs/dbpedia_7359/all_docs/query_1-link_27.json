        "text": "JOHNNY McDaid reckons the public fascination with his engagement to Courteney Cox is “bizarre”.\n\nThe Snow Patrol guitarist, 42, announced his engagement to the former Friends star in 2014, but despite continuing speculation they haven’t yet tied the knot.\n\nAnd it seems the big day isn’t imminent as the pair are currently on different continents.\n\nHe said: “I think people are curious. I’m often approached from a perspective of people thinking they know something when they don’t.\n\n“But often it’s just funny. I think I’ve gotten married 15 times in the last year.\n\n“There is a missing part of that equation, I’m on tour at the moment and Courteney is in LA.\n\n“So it would be really difficult for me to get married unless I do it by proxy or over Skype or something.”\n\nHe told the Belfast Telegraph: “It is a bit bizarre but it comes with the territory. I expect the curiosity but I also respect my relationship and my love.”\n\nThe Derry rocker was introduced to Cox by mutual pal Ed Sheeran in 2013.\n\nThey split one year after their engagement but later rekindled their romance.\n\nIt’s understood they plan to wed in a ceremony in Derry, followed by a bigger bash at Courteney’s Malibu home.\n\nHowever, the continuing commentary on their engagement doesn’t bother McDaid, who insists the couple have a very “normal” romance.\n\nHe said: “If you’ve ever been in love you know that love, it doesn’t change when it is analysed or if it’s public, it’s still love, and it has what all relationships have - challenges and joys.”\n\nDespite being based in London and spending much of his time in LA with Courteney and her daughter Coco, McDaid still maintains close links with his family.\n\nAnd he’ll get the chance to catch up with them when Snow Patrol play two Belfast dates next month as part of their latest tour.\n\nProving that he hasn’t forgotten his roots, he said his “heart has never left home.”\n\nThese days, he and his Snow Patrol band mates are busy covering plenty of ground with tour dates all over Europe.\n\nHe also opened up about his pride in the band’s lead singer Gary Lightbody, who recently spoke out about his battle with alcohol addiction.\n\nThe frontman told how he struggled with depression and eventually realised he had to quit drinking after a health scare provided a major wake-up call.\n\nThankfully, he had plenty of support from his band mates, with Johnny describing him as an inspiration for speaking publicly about his problems.\n\nHe said: “I’m immensely proud of him. Just as a human being, the courage it takes to face yourself and face your demons - because we all have them - but what Gary has done is he’s faced them very publicly.”"
