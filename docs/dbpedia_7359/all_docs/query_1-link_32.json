        "text": "Courteney Cox 'would love to have a baby' with Johnny McDaid\n\nThe good news about getting older is you generally get smarter about what your body needs. For Courteney Cox, 53, that's translated into health and beauty regimens that really work — and a solid understanding about what doesn't. \"I feel better than I've ever felt,\" she says in New Beauty's latest cover story. \"Hollywood makes it hard; this business makes it harder. I grew up thinking appearance was the most important thing. That as long as I looked OK, I would be OK, which got me into trouble.\" She admits she's gone through periods of too much tweaking (\"I've had all my fillers dissolved,\" she says) and now she's proud to be, as she puts it, \"as natural as I can be.\" Courteney's also discovered new ways of dealing with health issues, like a gene mutation that requires her to take a methylfolate and methylated B, which allows her to absorb folate in a way she wasn't able to when she was pregnant with her daughter, Coco. Now that her engine is running in tip-top shape, she's ready to for another challenge. \"I would love to have a baby now,\" Courteney says. \"I mean, I could carry someone else's egg. I may be one of the older people doing it, but I would love to, with Johnny that is. I would. I know it's crazy, but I would.\" Courteney and Johnny McDaid, 40, called off their engagement in December 2015. By the spring of April 2016, they were back together. Asked how he makes her feel beautiful, Courteney says, \"I used to worry about the age difference, but I don't think it matters. He appreciates beauty, but it's deeper than that. It's deeper for me too, but luckily I find him gorgeous and extremely sexy.\"\n\nRELATED: Courteney Cox and Jennifer Aniston, plus more celeb BFFs\n\nChrissy Teigen's embryo debt tweets are everything\n\n\"PAY YA RENT, embryo!!!\" So tweeted a perplexed Chrissy Teigen on Tuesday, June 20, after finding that she owed money to whomever is handling her future IVF options. Sharing a screenshot that read, \"OUTSTANDING EMBRYO STORAGE BALANCE DUE\" in a previous tweet, she wondered, \"Damn how's my embryo gonna be in debt before it's even born,\" which … well … fair question. Chrissy, who welcomed her daughter, Luna, with the help of IVF, has been open about the process in the past, defending herself against conservative critics. This week, she was feeling more jokey about the whole thing. When a follower asked if the embryo reference means she's pregnant, the model replied, \"no….storage as in…a freezer. not my uterus. why would i personally charge it rent lol.\"\n\nRELATED: Chrissy Teigen and John Legend's cutest family moments of 2016\n\nJohnny Depp's ex managers claim he lied about Amber Heard abuse allegations\n\nThe latest twist in Johnny Depp's ongoing court battle with his former managers at TMG involves Amber Heard. According to excerpts of the company's recently filed cross complaint published by Celebitchy, Johnny's business manager Joel Mandel \"was informed well after the fact through communications with various house staff and security that Depp had been extremely volatile and sometimes 'gotten physical' with Heard. Mandel was also later informed that Depp had violently kicked Heard during an incident that took place in or around 2014.\" The documents also refer to text messages Amber released during her divorce proceedings with Johnny — messages between her and an assistant that seemed to confirm Johnny kicked her on a private plane in 2014. \"Depp and his long-time assistant publicly denied the messages and outrageously accused Heard of manufacturing them,\" the documents allege. \"TMG is informed and believes that Depp knew full well that the text messages were genuine, but pressured and berated his assistant to falsely challenge the texts publicly.\"\n\nRELATED: Celebrity splits of 2017\n\nBrooklyn Beckham opens up about photography, his sister Harper and more\n\nNext week, Brooklyn Beckham is set to release his first photography book, \"What I See.\" He recently sat down with the Telegraph to discuss how he got into taking pictures and how his famous family figures into the book, which features 300 images. \"My dad bought me my first camera,\" he recalls. \"I just carried it around and started taking photos.\" Fast forward a few years and the 18-year-old is finishing up a photography course at a college in North London and planning to continue his studies in the field in New York this fall. Asked if he enjoys taking pictures of his mom, Victoria Beckham, his dad, David Beckham and his brothers Romeo and Cruz and sister Harper, he says he does. \"Especially my little sister. It's been amazing – really different. I haven't really remembered Romeo and Cruz being young, because I was young as well, but seeing Harper grow up is pretty cool.\" As for his own maturation process, the shutterbug looks forward to showing the world how serious he is about photography. \"… I feel like people will respect me more now that I'm moving to New York on my own. Once this book comes out, I feel people will take me seriously as a photographer,\" he says before adding, \"Hopefully.\" \"What I see\" hits shelves Wednesday, June 28.\n\nSeth Rogen and Stephen Cplbert really want Donald Trump Jr. to reply to their DMs\n\nDespite his efforts, Seth Rogen has made no progress in getting Donald Trump to quit his gig as president by contacting his son via Twitter. This week, Seth stopped by \"The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,\" where he said he initially followed Donald Trump Jr. \"to open a line of communication,\" according to the New York Post. Young Donald followed him back and Seth broke the ice with this DM: \"Hey man! It's Seth. Your father is trying to discredit our media, collude with Russia, and destroy the environment. It would be super cool of you to be like 'yo, dad, why don't you stop all this and go back to being just a guy on TV.' The majority of the world would be pretty psyched. Thanks!!!\" Alas, the message was seen the morning Seth sent it but Donald Jr. never replied. Last week, Seth tried again: \"Yo dude checking in. Seeing what's up. I think you see these. If not @StephenatHome was gonna help me get your attention. Hope you're good. Maybe ask your dad to resign? Thanks man! Peace.\" That message was also seen — but never replied to. As Seth and Stephen chatted about what could be done, Stephen shared a message with Donald Jr., too — something about getting together to \"burn one\" and not telling James Franco. Again, Donald Jr. saw the message and did not reply. Meh, you win some, you lose some …\n\nLady Gaga and boyfriend Christian Carino are still going strong\n\nThe love that was clearly in the air at the Super Bowl between Lady Gaga and Christian Carino has shown no signs of dissipating. The couple was spotted on a romantic stroll in the Hamptons this week, according to E! News. Lady G, 30, and her 48-year-old CAA agent beau had their arms around one another as they stepped over rocks to get to a breezy ocean view. Gaga hasn't said much publicly about the relationship, which apparently began prior to their football hang in February.\n\nEllen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi share a rare moment of PDA\n\nFor years, split rumors have followed Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi. But as the usually low-key couple proved during a stroll on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles on Tuesday, June 20, they're as happy as ever — a fact they sealed with a kiss. \"The truth is, and this is corny, I fall more in love with Portia all the time. I really do,\" Ellen told People in 2014. \"She surprises me all the time. It's what anyone experiences when you find that person that gets you, wants to take care of you, wants the best for you. We're really lucky because we know how rare it is.\"\n\nZoe Saldana's twins help their mom celebrate her birthday\n\nZoe Saldana turned 39 on Monday, June 19, and a slew of family members were on hand for the celebration. And, in her twin sons Cy and Bowie's case, cake. The actress shared an adorable pic of the 2-year-olds looking totally focused on their treats on social media after her husband, Marco Perego, presented the birthday girl with a white frosted cake outfitted with a single candle. According to the Daily Mail, the actress' mom, grandmother, sister, nieces and 4-month-old son Zen all joined in the festivities as well.\n\nJesse James accused of trying to cheat on his wife\n\nIs Jesse James back to his old behavior? Seven years after he split from Sandra Bullock amid a cheating scandal that involved multiple women, new rumors of infidelity have iht Jesse, who's now married to billionaire Alexis DeJoria. Speaking to InTouch, hair stylist Myla Harris says she and the \"Celebrity Apprentice\" alum traded sex-centric social media messages. She also claims she sent him nude photos and that he invited her to his home on multiple occasions. \"We messaged a few days on Instagram before he had me switch to Snapchat so our [later] conversations and pictures couldn't be saved,\" Myla says. \"He would ask me to come the day of,\" she recalls. At one point in April, she said she could come over after 6 p.m. \"He's like, 'No.' He needed me earlier.\" When she accused him being selfish, she says he blocked her on all social media. InTouch claims \"the relationship was never physically consummated\" and that neither Jesse nor Alexis replied when they were asked to comment.\n\nHelen Mirren reflects on changes in the beauty and fashion industries\n\nSome may have been surprised in 2014 when L'Oreal named Helen Mirren, then 69, its brand ambassador. Helen? Not so much. \"It was about bloody time!\" she said at a recent Cannes Lion event (via the New York Post). \"I thought, at last, there has been a shift [in the fashion and beauty industry] — I'm talking about age and beauty, but also diversity.\" She went on to cite the fact that she lived with a successful fashion photographer in the '70s and he was never able to get a magazine to put an African-American woman on its cover. \"Now, finally, the breakthrough has happened,\" she said. \"…And now it's great to see older women, different genders, different religions — the whole diversity of the world we are living in.\" Helen is currently working on a British campaign called \"All Worth It,\" which aims to provide young people with confidence training."
