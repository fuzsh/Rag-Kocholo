        "text": "Cheshire's most beloved farm shop, The Hollies, has played host to none other than Hollywood A-listersCourteney Cox and Johnny McDaid from Snow Patrol. The Little Budworth gem welcomed the Friends icon and her musician beau last week.\n\nThe family-run establishment took to social media to share a charming photo of the couple, announcing that Courteney and Johnny had stayed in their woodland lodges near The Hollies Farm Shop, reports the Manchester Evening News.\n\nIn their post, they mentioned that the pair enjoyed \"all spaces at our Little Budworth site\" throughout their visit.\n\nThe post set off a wave of excitement among fans, with many expressing shock that Courteney, best known for her role as Monica Geller on Friends, was in Cheshire.\n\nFans reacted with iconic Friends references, with one echoing Janice's famous line: \"Ohhhh. Myyyy. Godddd.\"\n\nAnother commented: \"The One where Monica visits The Hollies... WOW\".\n\nSome customers recounted doing double-takes, having spotted someone resembling the actress in the farm shop last week, only to be astonished to discover it was indeed her.\n\nInstagram user Sunday Girl recalled: \"Saw her queuing for coffee on Sunday and said to my fella how much this woman looked like Courteney Cox..only to now know it was her and not a doppelganger.\"\n\nOn Facebook, Amanda Jaundrill exclaimed: \"Wowsers! Always knew you were star class. Maybe she will recommend it to her 'Friends'.\"\n\nCheshire's most beloved farm shop, The Hollies, has seen its popularity soar, not least due to Love Island's Molly-Mae Hague naming it as one of her go-to places for indulgent treats.\n\nThe establishment is now so in demand that eager customers are often spotted queuing around the car park just to gain entry on weekends, all keen to explore the shop's vast array of local delights, unique gifts, and home decor ideas.\n\nAdding a touch of stardust to The Hollies' reputation, Hollywood actress Courteney Cox and Snow Patrol's Johnny McDaid recently graced the family-run business with their presence.\n\nAccording to The Hollies' management, the star-studded couple were guests at their Cheshire lodges for a family celebration.\n\nJohnny McDaid is currently touring with his band Snow Patrol, who played their latest show at Tramlines Festival in Sheffield, not far from Cheshire.\n\nNestled beside the renowned Delamere Forest, The Hollies seems an apt stop for the musician, especially as Snow Patrol's upcoming album, set for release in September, is titled 'The Forest is the Path'.\n\nThe Hollies took to social media to share glimpses of Courteney and Johnny's visit, complete with pictures of the pair outside their woodland accommodation and a charming canine companion. Their post read: \"Last week Team Hollies were home to a fabulous family attending a special event here in Cheshire.\"\n\n\"Johnny, Courteney and the McDaid family were a pleasure to host, breathing positivity and happiness into every area of The Hollies.\"\n\n\"We are over the moon that the family chose to spend their weekend at our Forest Lodges and make the most of all spaces at our Little Budworth site during their stay.\"\n\nThe local personalities expressed their excitement online after the star-studded visit: \"From our family to the McDaid family, we can't wait to see you again soon! Team Hollies x\".\n\nThe details behind the McDaid family's special occasion remain undisclosed, though Johnny, hailing from Derry, did recently celebrate his 48th birthday in July. It seems the festivities happened close by at Oakmere, indicated by Delamere Events' own social media post featuring the celebrity couple: \"Our celebrity visitors certainly caused a stir last week! I've had so many people asking what they were like and can honestly say they were so down to earth and proper nice! Thanks to @courteneycoxofficial and @jmd_snowpatrol for being so cool and letting me grab a pic with the team! \".\n\nCourteney Cox herself took to social media with an emotionally charged birthday tribute to her beloved other half, sharing: \"Happy birthday to the man who can do most anything. I love you always J.\"\n\nAccompanying her heartfelt sentiments were images of the duo enjoying various moments, including a fishing excursion where she revealed Johnny \"threw the fish back\", though she didn't disclose their exact location.\n\nIt's widely known that the couple's romance was sparked when mutual friend and musical legend Ed Sheeran played matchmaker at a party. They began their romance in 2013 but experienced a temporary cessation after three years.\n\nNevertheless, as often happens with enduring affection, they found each other once more in 2016 and have been inseparable since then."
