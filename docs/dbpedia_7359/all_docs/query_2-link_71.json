        "text": "Rock star Johnny McDaid of Snow Patrol fame just turned 58 and was treated to an adorable shout-out by his long-time girlfriend Courteney Cox, who called him “the man who can do most anything” on Instagram. Cox, who is two years older than McDaid, shared a photo dump of her boo performing on stage, piloting, and fishing last week. (In case you were worried, he threw the fish back into the water.) Fans flooded the post with their own good wishes, while the birthday boy’s sister, Aine McDaid, commented, “Best night ever … love love love.”\n\nMcDaid’s band, Snow Patrol, recently announced that their upcoming album, The Forest Is The Path, is slated for release on September 13. Two singles from the album have come out so far: “The Beginning” and “This is the Sound of Your Voice”. McDaid and his bandmates – Gary Lightbody and Nathan Connolly – have also been performing extensively and have a UK and Europe tour coming up in 2025.\n\nBut besides being the partner of a television icon and having his own very successful career, who is Johnny McDaid? Here’s everything we know.\n\nJohnny McDaid is an Irishman\n\nJohnny McDaid was born and raised in Derry, Northern Ireland and had moved to London when he was 17. His mother, Pauline McDaid, is a retired art teacher, and his father, the late John McDaid Sr, was a chartered accountant and a prominent figure in Derry. Notably, McDaid Sr served as a founding director of The Inner City Trust and was instrumental in getting the Peace Bridge installed in the city. Unfortunately, he passed away in 2011 after succumbing to cancer.\n\nWhen Cox visited Derry after she got engaged to McDaid, her to-be mother-in-law said the Friends star “felt at home”, per Belfast Telegraph, and visited the Peace Bridge to pay her respects. She was also more than approving of the Mothers and Daughters actress, saying, “We all love her.”\n\nHow did he meet Courteney Cox?\n\nThe two-time Grammy-nominated singer and Friends megastar have been together for more than a decade, though they have faced their ups and downs – including a period of separation.\n\nThey met thanks to Ed Sheeran, for whom McDaid has written several songs, when the “Shape of You” singer invited him to a house party at Cox’s in 2013. According to People, she had an “instant crush” on him and thought, “Oh, he’s intense … he’s really really handsome” … and the rest is history. A year later, they were engaged.\n\nWhy did they break up?\n\nCox and McDaid broke up three years into their relationship. To be precise, according to Cox on the Minnie Questions podcast, he broke up with her within “the first minute” of couples therapy. They then broke their engagement and lived apart for six months, per E! Online.\n\nDuring that time, the Cougar Town actress worked on herself, went to therapy and “completely changed”. Ultimately, she says she was “thankful” for the split because it was “life-changing”, per Belfast Telegraph. The couple got back together in 2016, and later that year McDaid got a tattoo of Cox’s initials on his wrist, per People.\n\nWhen asked about marriage plans, Cox told People in 2022, “I’m definitely not opposed to it. I just don’t think about it.”\n\nHe had to get spinal surgery\n\nIn June 2019, Snow Patrol had to cancel a host of concerts after McDaid had a serious neck issue. He underwent spinal surgery and took some time off to recover with his partner by his side, of course. “Happy to be taking care of my man,” wrote Cox in an Instagram post in July 2019 alongside a snap of McDaid post-surgery.\n\nWho else has he written songs for?\n\nIn addition to his prolific career as a member of Snow Patrol and formerly of the alt-rock band Vega4, McDaid is a highly sought-after songwriter.\n\nMcDaid started writing songs for other artists after Vega4 was forced to go on a hiatus; he even embarked upon a “writing tour of America”, he said, according to his bio on music website Polar Patrol, writing for anyone who wanted to work with him. He eventually got to work with Ed Sheeran as a writer and producer for X, which earned him a Grammy nomination.\n\nTo date, McDaid has written for BTS, Pink, Birdy, Lewis Capaldi, Alicia Keys, Keith Urban, Shawn Mendes, Kelly Clarkson and more."
