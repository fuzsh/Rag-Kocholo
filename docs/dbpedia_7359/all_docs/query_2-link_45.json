        "text": "Looking out for her friend. According to a new report, Jennifer Aniston thinks Courteney Cox and Johnny McDaid’s relationship has one major “red flag” in its way.\n\nThe 55-year-old actress has reportedly been “wary” of her Friends co-star’s boyfriend since the start of their relationship, a source told OK! Magazine. McDaid, a singer for the band Snow Patrol, started dating Courteney Cox in late 2013 following her divorce from ex-husband David Arquette. Cox and McDaid ended up getting engaged in June 2014, but eventually called off their engagement in late 2015 and took a break before choosing to continue their relationship without getting married.\n\nAccording to OK! Magazine’s source, Aniston finds McDaid’s lack of commitment concerning—and that includes his decision to continue living in the U.K. while dating Cox, who lives in the U.S. “She finds it really odd that Johnny won’t move to L.A. full time to live with Courteney and insists on living in London,” the insider shared, adding that Aniston “thinks the whole long-distance thing after all these years is such a red flag.”\n\n“She’s always polite to him, but she thinks he ought to be thanking his lucky stars to have landed Courteney,” the source noted.\n\nNews of Aniston’s alleged feelings about Cox’s relationship come just two weeks after the Scream actress opened up about the “shock” and “pain” of her 2015 breakup with the Snow Patrol musician. “Three years in, we broke up and it was really intense,” she said on an episode of the Minnie Questions podcast in April 2024. The 59-year-old actress revealed that she was blindsided by the split: “We broke up in therapy. I didn’t know it was coming,” she shared.\n\n“We went to this therapist to talk about our boundaries, what we could and couldn’t accept about each other. Instead he just broke up [with me] within the first minute,” she recalled. “And I was like, ‘What?’ We were engaged and I was so shocked, I was in so much pain. I also don’t like surprises.”\n\nCox doesn’t blame McDaid for his decision, despite how difficult it was to deal with at the time. “He’s an incredible human being, so he wasn’t trying to surprise me,” she said. “He was in that much pain in the relationship, there was that much that needed to be dealt with that he ended up protecting himself around his heart.”\n\nThe Cougar Town star went on to reveal that she is now “grateful” for their split for allowing them to both work on themselves before getting back together. “I am so thankful for that break-up because when we got back together it was a different relationship, but also because it really taught me how I operated in the world,” she explained.\n\nWhile Cox and McDaid called things off for awhile before deciding to rekindle things, one thing has always been a constant: Cox and Aniston’s friendship. The two actresses met on the set of the iconic TV series Friends, where they played Monica Geller and Rachel Green, respectively. Their on-screen chemistry translated into a close off-screen bond, and over the years, they’ve often spoken about their friendship in interviews and on social media. To this day, their dynamic is still one of the more enduring examples of Hollywood friendships—and in the word’s of Friends’ Phoebe Buffay, “boyfriends and girlfriends will come and go, but this is for life.”"
