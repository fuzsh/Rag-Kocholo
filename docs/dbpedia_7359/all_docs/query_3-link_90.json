It was a happy. Always hard to leave. But you sent us off nice.”\n\nThe Donegal home, renovated in 2018, was bought by Broderick’s family over four decades ago and the pair and their children are regularly spotted around the village during their visits.\n\nKilcar even has an underage GAA tournament, called the Broderick Cup tournament, after Broderick’s parents who often supported the local club."
