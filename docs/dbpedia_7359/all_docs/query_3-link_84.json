        "text": "Virgin Radio\n\n27 Sep 2023, 14:12\n\nCredit: Instagram\n\nIconic Friends actress Courteney Cox has celebrated her 10th wedding anniversary to Snow Patrol husband Johnny McDaid — with Ed Sheeran featuring prominently in the sweet montage.\n\nThe star, 59, posted a collection of throwback photos and videos with her partner and the singer. She explained over credits: “10 years ago, this guy introduced me to… this guy.”\n\nIn the post, musician husband McDaid can be seen sitting alongside friend Sheeran and his wife Cherry Seaborn as Sheeran begins to sing a spoof version of his hit Shape of You.\n\nCredit: Instagram\n\nThe lyrics include: “Although your heart is fallin’ too / Johnny’s in love with your body / And last night you were in his room / And now his bed sheets smell like you / Every day, discoverin’ somethin’ brand new / Johnny’s beard is the shape of you.”\n\nCox ended the video with a message for McDaid with a heart emoji and wrote: \"Happy anniversary J.\"\n\nThe couple were first introduced to each other by the Bad Habits singer at a party in 2013 following her divorce from actor David Arquette in May 2013. Sheeran and McDaid have collaborated on songs since 2013 including The Joker and the Queen, and Photograph.\n\nThey announced their engagement in June 2014, then called it off in 2015, but got back together a year later.\n\nCredit: Instagram\n\nThe Cougar Town star told People in January 2022 that 'love is precious'. She said about McDaid: \"He's a great advice-giver. I love his heart, his intentions. His morals.\n\n\"He's extremely talented and obviously musical, but he's a poet and a writer. He's just so smart, and I find that really sexy. And then he is gorgeous.\"\n\nCredit: Instagram\n\nCourteney said about calling off their engagement: \"He’s not my fiancé. We were engaged to be married, but now we’re just together. We broke off our engagement, and he moved to England, then we got back together, and it’s actually better than it was before.”\n\nTalking about making their long-distance love work, she said: \"As long as you have trust, then I think it doesn't matter where you are. You can be yourself and yet be excited when you see each other.\""
