        "text": "When Courteney Cox launched her home care brand, Homecourt, the connection to her Friends character Monica Geller was clear. But as she enters the skincare arena as the new , only fans of the show with keen eyes and even sharper memories will pick up on this overlooked connection.\n\nCox, a longtime fan of the brand, was first introduced to the line of products while filming Friends. But it gets better. They were even used as props in Monica and Rachel’s bathroom.\n\n“There are certain products that you love because they smell great and are so natural and fresh, but I want mine to be like that and be backed by science. That’s why I’ve always loved Dermalogica,” Cox tells BAZAAR.com exclusively.\n\nAhead Cox shares her top shelf beauty picks, the skincare advice she gives to her daughter, and more of her beauty wisdom.\n\nA lot of people are very skincare savvy now. How has your skincare routine changed over the years?\n\nI'm learning more about what my skin needs. It changes because, you know, , they do so much research and they're so innovative that they continue to come up with products that are specific to your needs. I am much more interested in all parts of skincare than I used to be. I just didn't realize, and as you get older, it's so important. I wish I'd known this stuff when I was in my twenties.\n\nWhat’s something you wish you knew in your twenties that you know now?\n\nI mean, the obvious is sun care. Don't lay in the sun and don’t fry. I always say to my daughter, Coco, your skin is incredible. Let me show you my chest. Then she's like, mom, I would never have that kind of skin. I'm like, yeah. Your face you always look at, but you forget your body. Wear sunscreen and care about your body. Really use the right products because it catches up.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite skincare products right now?\n\nI use the twice a day. I love it. It’s exfoliating. I really feel like it cleans my skin even if you dilute it. I'm a big exfoliator in general. If I could take the whole layer off, I would and just start fresh every day. I love the . I play tennis. I'm out in the sun a lot. And even if it didn't have sunscreen, I would use it. It's so illuminating and gives you so much moisture. I love the way it smells too. I use that and I use it all over my body because I'm lucky enough to be able to do that. I love the which I use at night. It's very hydrating and it smells good as well. But it really works. That's what I love about this.\n\nYou've been open about your relationship to things like fillers. What is your new approach to in-office treatments and fillers now?\n\nI love retinol serums especially the . I think it's great when you do treatments that use infrared or red lights. I think that's incredible. They have a wonderful treatment here called . That's incredible. But I do not believe in fillers. I shouldn't speak for other people because my skin is thinner. So it was not a good road for me to go down. To each his own, but I find that it's better not to do that.\n\nI don't think Botox is that bad. It wears off. So it's okay as long as you're not frozen and you can't move your face and you can't act and you can't show your emotion. I love getting a treatment. Dermalogica, they have flagship stores all over. And it's just nice to know that you're getting a treatment by a skin expert, someone who's really studied it.\n\nWhy is partnering with Dermalogica important versus you launching a brand-new skincare line through like Homecourt?\n\nI know a lot about and am obsessed with scents. I mean, obviously I do like to clean. That’s kind of embarrassing since I did play a clean freak [on Friends]. I mean, I know I love products, and I love Dermalogica, but this is 40 years in the making. So I wouldn't attempt to try to do something that I don't have the expertise around.\n\nWhat do you think of this celebrity skincare boom?\n\nI feel like celebrities have done so many sponsorships and have been a part of so many things, but you can tell when someone really believes in it. It's not just seeing beautiful ads at the airport, but actually you just can tell when someone's partnering with someone and it's because they love it.\n\nYou’ve posted some funny content on social. What is your approach?\n\nBe yourself. Be silly. That's just my personality. I like to think in terms of what would make me laugh. I don't give you just daily reports of where I am and what's happening. I do it kind of like little productions. It's exhausting. I'm not gonna lie. Cleaning the stars [on the Hollywood Walk of Fame] that took about five minutes. I was on my way to Jimmy Kimmel to promote Scream. And I was like, oh, let's do this really quick. And my partner Johnny said, \"There's no way you can't shoot something right now. We're gonna be late.\" I said, \"No, no, just pull over.\" And we pulled over and I just had some paper towels went into a place and it just worked. But then when it works really well, you feel like you've got to do something as good the next week. And that's when you're like, oh my gosh, really? And you compare it to the last one.\n\nSpeaking of Scream, if you were running from Ghost Face Killer, what is the one Dermalogica product you are taking with you in a hurry?\n\nMicrofoliant. When you sleep at night, if your skin isn't clean, it's a disservice. That's how everything rejuvenates and rests. It all takes place with your skin first. Just making sure it's clean is number one. This is a stupid story, but I have a friend that goes to bed with full makeup, just too tired and doesn't want to deal. And I said, \"Please, I'm begging you give it one month. Just wash your face before you go to bed just for one month.\" I swear she looked 10 years younger.\n\nSo earlier in our conversation you mentioned your daughter Coco. Do you two share skincare products?\n\nEverything. The problem is, I don't care if she takes it, if she leaves me a little note that says: If you're looking for this, I have it. I'm the kind of person that I might open the door like seven times to see what she took and then I call down. And she'll say \"I know I didn't take it\" before saying \"Oh, you're right. I forgot.\" Oh my God. It drives me crazy. I don't mind borrowing, but it's got to be actual borrowing."
