        "text": "wonderlandhaylor\n\nTaylor Swift and Harry Styles: a Haylor relationship retrospective\n\nTaylor Swift and Harry Styles: a Haylor relationship retrospective\n\nHarry Styles is the subject of most of Taylor Swift’s new album 1989. Here’s a complete recap of their relationship, from their first hookup in April 2012 to their current friendship.\n\n(this was not done by me, but it’s too perfect)\n\nTheir first hookup in April 2012\n\nTaylor dances to What Makes You Beautiful at the Kids’ Choice Awards\n\nTaylor and Harry first met at the Kids’ Choice Awards on March 31 2012. One Direction’s Liam joked the following day: “I thought Harry might have went to the bathroom just a little bit when we met her.” Also that week, Justin Bieber invited both Taylor and One Direction to his LA mansion, where they swam and “just hung out”. Bieber told Britain’s Daily Mirror that “one of the biggest artists in the world thinks Harry is so hot, but I have been sworn to secrecy.”\n\nDuring an MTV interview, One Direction teased a bashful Harry about Taylor. “Did any particular person stand out for you [at the Kids’ Choice Awards]? Just so we can get your drift … a really quick one.” When Harry finally mentioned Taylor’s name, his bandmates shouted, “Jackpot!” As the conversation moved on, Harry muttered to Louis Tomlinson: “I’m going to kill you!”\n\nDays later, both Harry and Taylor were spotted separately at New York’s Bowery Hotel. One Direction were in town for promotional duties while Taylor was on a trip with girlfriends.\n\nIn late April, One Direction began a tour of Australia and New Zealand, during which Harry revealed that he had exchanged numbers with Taylor: “We met in America. She is very talented. She’s very nice … We’re friends.” Harry photographed with Emily Ostilly in New Zealand\n\nHowever, the flirtation with Taylor came to an abrupt end when Harry was photographed kissing model Emma Ostilly during a night out in Auckland, New Zealand. A Taylor friend later told Vanity Fair that there was “a weekend where they got really close and he was all, like, ‘You’re amazing - I want to be with you. I want to do this.’” According to the friend, he then texted Taylor while on tour to alert her to pictures online where he was “kissing a friend good-bye.” When Taylor searched for the pictures, she discovered they were “making out with like their hands all up in each other’s hair.”\n\nIn the following months, Harry was linked to model Cara Delevingne while Taylor enjoyed a two-month summer fling with Conor Kennedy. In a July interview, Taylor was asked to name her favorite One Direction member and jokingly replied, “How could you possibly choose?!”\n\nThey reconnect in September 2012\n\nHarry and Taylor posed with fans at LA’s Katsuya in September\n\nThe pair were next seen together on September 6 2012, when Popstar reported that Harry and his bandmates watched Taylor’s final MTV Video Music Awards rehearsal. The couple later enjoyed a post-show meal at LA’s Katsuya with a group that included their mutual friend Ed Sheeran and Taylor’s bandmates. They posed separately for photos with fans inside the sushi restaurant.\n\nTaylor and her boyfriend Conor Kennedy had their final meeting on September 16. In October, a source revealed that the couple had “quietly parted ways a while ago. It was just a distance thing. No hard feelings. They’re fine.”\n\nBackstage at the Radio 1 Teen Awards\n\nOn October 7, both Taylor and Harry performed at London’s Radio 1 Teen Awards. They spent a lot of time together backstage, leading radio hosts to speculate on-air about whether they were romantically involved. The Sun reported that Taylor and a “mystery” member of One Direction had arranged to have dinner at the upmarket Luton Hoo Hotel after the concert. However, when the tabloid’s Bizarre columnist received a tip about the reservation, the meal was suddenly cancelled. When One Direction were later asked about the rumor during an Irish chat show appearance, Louis Tomlinson suggested that Harry “take this one”. However, Harry replied that he “didn’t get asked” to dinner.\n\nLater that month, Harry named Taylor as one of his celebrity crushes, alongside Rihanna and Rita Ora, telling Seventeen: “Taylor’s a really lovely girl. Honestly, she couldn’t be a sweeter person. She’s a great girl and she’s extremely talented. She’s one of those people you meet [who’s] genuinely a nice person. Some people you meet and they are not as nice as you make them out to be, but she’s one of those people who’s really just amazing. She deserves everything she has.”\n\nIn an interview published at the beginning of November, Harry told Cosmopolitan that he was currently dating someone: \"There’s someone I like. If you’re shown in the papers with other girls when you really like someone else, that’s difficult. But still, I think it’s important if you’re thinking about starting a relationship to do it away from the spotlight. I thought I [had a type] but this girl I like isn’t my 'type’. It’s more about the person. How they act, their body language, if they can laugh at themselves. I find ambition really attractive too - if someone’s good at something they love doing. I want someone who is driven.”\n\nStyles was photographed wearing his necklace on October 30. By November 7, it was in Swift’s possession\n\nDuring a promotional appearance in London on November 7, Taylor was photographed wearing a silver It’s A Paper Airplane chain identical to that owned by Harry, who replaced his chain with a new pendant. Also around this time, One Direction’s Niall Horan told People his favorite song of 2012 was Taylor’s “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.” When asked if he would ever date Taylor, Niall gave a small laugh, looked at Harry and answered with a succinct, “no.”\n\nRelationship goes public in November 2012\n\nHarry and Taylor backstage at The X Factor\n\nOn November 14, Harry flew from New York to LA to spend two days with Taylor. He accompanied Taylor to an LA television studio to rehearse for her X Factor performance. “He was sitting with her mum Andrea and she seemed won over too”, a source told The Sun. “After Taylor finished, he picked her up over his shoulder and carried her to her trailer. They were holding hands and flirting all day.” The source continued, “Taylor was really embarassed by what happened [in April] and was nervous about giving him another go. But this time they have spent more time getting to know each other. Harry is being careful because he doesn’t want to hurt her again. But he’s made it clear he likes her a lot. They’ve been quietly seeing each other again for a little while now.”\n\nHarry and Taylor were photographed together for the first time on Decmeber 2 2012 while visiting the zoo in Central Park, New York with friends.\n\nLater that night, they posed for photos with fans after dinner at SoHo’s Bond St. restaurant, where they dined with Ed Sheeran and Harry’s mother and stepfather.\n\nOn December 3, they made an apperance at the Hudson Hotel, as part of One Direction’s Madison Square Garden afterparty. They were joined for karaoke by Ed Sheeran and the rest of One Direction. They sang Dolly Parton’s “Islands In The Stream”, Elton John’s “Don’t Go Breaking My Heart” and the Backstreet Boys’ “I Want It That Way”. Harry’s father later tweeted that Taylor was “natural, kind and welcoming.” The pair were photographed arriving at Taylor’s hotel at 4am.\n\nOn December 6, they attended the birthday party of Taylor’s friend Emma Stone at the Crosby Street Hotel. A source told PEOPLE: ”Taylor and Harry were being very smoochie. They definitely looked like a couple.” They held hands and Harry seemed “really protective of her” and kept his arm around her during the party: “They’re not trying to hide it. The bar was packed.”\n\nAt Z100’s Jingle Ball on December 7, Harry and Taylor watched each other’s performances from side-of-stage, and kissed, hugged and danced backstage while other acts were performing. They left the event to take a red-eye flight to London on Taylor’s private jet. The rest of One Direction travelled on a commercial flight.\n\nTaylor accompanied Harry and the rest of One Direction for their promotional appearance on The X Factor Final in Manchester, England on December 10.\n\nOn December 11, Harry and Taylor had dinner at The Rising Inn in Derbyshire, England with Harry’s sister and her boyfriend.\n\nAn eyewitness told Heatworld: “Harry and Taylor were putting spoons on their noses and fooling around with each other and taking photos of each other. After that, they were stood talking and Harry kept putting his hand on Taylor’s bum. Taylor had her arms around him a lot and they were really close all night. They seemed like they got along really well and they got on with Harry’s sister and did seem like a normal couple. They were sat together opposite Harry’s sister and you could see Harry’s hand on Taylor’s lap the whole evening.” Later that evening, they were spotted grocery shopping at a nearby Tesco.\n\nOn December 12, the couple visited Bowness-on-Windermere in the Lake District. They posed for a photo with birds and stopped into the World of Beatrix Potter store. Taylor bought some soft toys, and she and Harry struck the workers as “nice and charming. They were dancing around to the seasonal music being played. Harry was being the most boisterous.” Later that night, they stopped for takeout at a curry house.\n\nOn the morning of Taylor’s birthday on December 13, Harry collected 23 pre-ordered cupcakes from a local bakery. Later in the afternoon, the couple left their private home and took a drive around the English countryside, a source told E! News. They then drove to a quaint village called Great Budworth and stopped at the George & Dragon Pub for a bite to eat. After staying there for just over an hour, Harry and Taylor were seen laughing and joking as they headed out and drove off. That night, they stopped by Fortune City takeaway restaurant in Harry’s hometown of Holmes Chapel.\n\nOn December 14, Harry drove Taylor to Manchester airport where she boarded an international flight to Germany. While there, she told an interviewer she had the “best birthday since I was about six years old.”\n\nOn December 18, Taylor accompanied Harry to LA’s Shamrock Tattoo Parlour, where they posed for photos with fans.\n\nHarry and Taylor visited Taylor’s mother at her house in LA on December 19\n\nThey were photographed on a skiing vacation in Park City, Utah on December 21. After a day on the slopes, the pair had dinner with friends at Grappa, where an onlooker told Us Weekly they “looked happy and in love.”\n\nHarry arrived in England on December 24 (and showed off his injury at a party with friends)\n\nHarry and Taylor were photographed by fans kissing at midnight after Taylor’s performance in Times Square on New Year’s Eve. They were later photographed returning to their hotel and left town on Taylor’s private jet early the next morning.\n\nBreak-up in January 2013\n\nOn January 3, Harry and Taylor were photographed having dinner and drinks at CocoMaya while on vacation in the British Virgin Islands’s Virgin Gorda. Us Weekly reported that the trip was a “surprise” for Taylor: “He planned it and whisked her away.” After dinner, the couple returned to their boat. However, later that night, a drunk Harry “left Taylor on their boat for a few hours without telling her where he was going.” When he returned, Taylor, “a former tetotaler who was also knocking back cocktails,” was “crying and furious. She called him a dick and accused him of running around with girls.”\n\nTaylor left the island the following morning; first taking a boat to an larger, adjacent island and then travelling by private jet back to Los Angeles. An eyewitness at CocoMaya remarked: “I would never have guessed a break-up would come judging by their body language. Taylor constantly had her head on Harry’s shoulder. They were very close to each other the entire time and constantly leaning into each other. My sisters and I even saw them share a kiss.”\n\nAt the 2013 Grammy Awards, Taylor used a British accent during her performance of We Are Never Getting Back Together. When asked for comment, Harry said: “She knows what she’s doing on stage. It was just another good Taylor Swift performance.”\n\nHarry and Taylor avoided each other at the Brit Awards in London weeks later. Asked about the possibility of running into her, Harry responded: “I’m not worried about seeing her at all. She’s a sweet girl, you know. I don’t have a bad word to say about her.” While Taylor said she \"directed” her performance of I Knew You Were Trouble at Harry, he thought “her performance was really good. She looked great.” Ed Sheeran joked about his awkward position at the ceremony: “I’m like Switzerland. If you talk to one about the other, the drama starts!”\n\nIn other interviews during this period, Harry said: \"I can’t say I’d have dated someone less famous to avoid [having songs written about me]. I think it’s people. You like people for who they are, so I couldn’t say I want to date someone less famous because of the hassle. You like who you like. At least she’s a great songwriter! It would be hypocritical for me to say she couldn’t do it because everybody writes songs based on personal experience.”\n\n“The only time [fame] gets really annoying is that if you get into a relationship and you get into a place where you really like someone and then things are being written in the papers that affect them and how they see you. Then it can get annoying. I think relationships are hard enough, so I think you have to completely ignore everything from outside. When you’re in the opening stages of a relationship as it is, you’re still under the pressure of getting to know everything about a person. If you have a lot of people from outside telling you what it is and they don’t even know you, telling you what your relationship is, that’s weird. So I think you sort of have to block it out and just have the relationship rather than think - we’re having this relationship play out on magazine covers.”\n\nThey were friends again by August 2013\n\nThe Sun reported in August 2013 that the couple had put their differences behind them. While Taylor was reported by some media outlets to have whispered, “Shut the fuck up” while Harry was on stage at the VMAs, other sources insisted Taylor was responding to her friend Selena Gomez, who declared she had no chance of winning the category One Direction were announcing. Taylor was seen giving One Direction an enthusiastic standing ovatation when they won an award.\n\nHarry and Taylor both attended an intimate afterparty hosted by mutual friend Ed Sheeran following the VMAs. Ellie Goulding, another attendee, said there was no tension between the pair and that they seemed to be “friends.”\n\nIn December 2013, Harry told J17: “I think a lot of the time, you still have feelings for an ex, and sometimes it doesn’t matter how long it’s been. Sometimes you feel like you have unfinished stuff, and it’s okay to get back together with them.”\n\nIn March 2014, Taylor and Harry both attended The Weinstein Company’s Pre-Oscar dinner party at the Montage Hotel. They were seen having a \"friendly 10-minute chat\" before the dinner. “They looked totally fine considering all their history.”\n\nAnother onlooker remarked that rumors of a feud appeared to be “wide of the mark,” with the couple seeming “totally cool with one another.”\n\nAlso in March, Harry bought a house in the same Beverly Hills neighbourhood as Taylor.\n\nIn October 2014, Gavin DeGraw revealed he had recently written a song with Harry: “It’s called “Not Our Fault” and I think it’s a winner. It’s about… if it doesn’t work out sometimes you can’t necessarily just blame it on yourselves, you know, sometimes it’s what’s going on around you. Sometimes it’s other things that have nothing to do with the two people involved, those factors that you can’t control. It touches on that type of subject. It’s a way of saying you’re giving up, but it’s not necessarily you’re giving up because you don’t love each other.”\n\nHarry also wrote the breakup song I Love You (“I love you/ More than you think I do/ And I love you/ Now you don’t want me to”), recorded by Alex and Sierra. The song has pointed references to various Taylor lyrics (“We lay there on the soft warm ground for a week and thirteen days”, “You’ve heard all this before/ I didn’t come back and I wasn’t there/ I won’t trouble you no more.”)\n\nWhile promoting 1989, Taylor said it was “a new concept for me actually, writing songs about things that have happened in romantic relationships and being able to run them past the person that they’re about.\" She has also said the song Style is about a relationship that is \"never really done … I think everybody has that one person who kind of floats in and out of their life, and the narrative is never truly over.”\n\ncxming-down\n\nTaylor Swift’s 1989 - Who are the songs about?\n\nI’ve seen some debate about this matter so I’m posting some of the things I’ve noticed from Taylor’s interviews / Listening Sessions just to clarify this matter. Reposting from my old post with some added quotes.\n\nGLAMOUR UK, NOV 2013 INTERVIEW\n\nInterviewer: So “Harry Styles: The Truth” album is on its way?\n\nTaylor: “Well, an album is supposed to be a chapter in a musician’s life…And sometimes you have to wait for the book to be written.”\n\n1. Blank Space:\n\n“I was on a boat once and I came up with the line ‘so its going to be forever, or its going to go down in flames’ and I didn’t use it for about a year until I was writing Blank Space and I was like ‘OH!” - She was talking about that time she broke up with Harry on a cruise in British Virgin Islands.\n\n2. Wish You Would:\n\n“There’s “I Wish You Would,” about an ex who bought a house two blocks from hers (whom she implies was Styles)” - Rolling Stones interview, 2014.\n\n“Okay so this is an idea called “I Wish You Would”. It’s kind of about this guy who’s like, he’s driving down the street at the middle of the night and he passes his ex-girlfriend’s house and it’s like, he thinks she hate him, but she’s still in love with him, very dramatic. This track is sick, hope you like this.” - Taylor’s voice memo in the 1989 Deluxe album\n\n“oh, some extra info on IWYW. cant remember if ive already shared this, if i have im sorry, if i havent then here. taylor wrote that after a couple of months after her and harry broke up, and they decided to become friends again, and she said this was the first time she had become friends with an ex to the point where they were comfortable enough to talk about why the relationship didnt work out. and he said how, after they broke up, he bought a house literally one road adjacent to hers. and every day he would drive home, and accidentally turn into her street, and told her how he just wanted to stop at her house and see her, but he never did. and she said this song is about while he was in the car making the decision to get out the car and see her, she was sitting in her bedroom, wishing he would make the move and go back to her and just pitch up at her house. she compared it to a classic movie where both parties want the same thing but neither has the guts to say anything. and that’s why the song has the lyrics of “driving straight ahead”, opposed to taking the left turn to see her.“ - Taylor’s 1989 listening party\n\nHarry bought an LA mansion in March 2014, which is near Taylor’s house (about 7 minutes away). However, he was already staying in LA in 2013 with Jeff Azoff.\n\n-\n\nTaylor once said this about Style, a song she definitely wrote about Harry: “I talk about in another song on the record a crooked love, which is kind of like never quite synced up right.”\n\nThe other song that she meant was ‘I Wish You Would’ in which one part of the lyrics of the song says: “We’re a crooked love in a straight line down.”\n\nTherefore both ‘Style’ and ‘I Wish You Would’ are about the same person, which is about Harry Styles.\n\n-\n\nHarry has also referenced IWYW lyrics in his song ‘Perfect’, written about Taylor:\n\n“And if you like midnight driving with the windows down” to Taylor’s “Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start”.\n\n3. All You Have to Do Was Stay:\n\nShe tweeted ‘Back In the studio’ days after she broke up with Harry. Taylor then later confirmed on tumblr that she wrote ‘All You Had To Do Was Stay’ at that studio session.\n\n4. How You Get The Girl:\n\nIt is hinted that she wrote it when she was still with Harry.\n\n“about how a guy broke up with his girlfriend because he is afraid of how in love he is and he wants to experience the world and date around but then he realizes what he lost and came back for it six months too late; also she said her friends’ boyfriends come and ask her from help when they do this kind of thing, and she says to follow the steps of this song” - Taylor’s 1989 secret sessions, hints at Harry.\n\n5. This Love:\n\nThis song is the oldest song on the track, and the linear notes described the song with the words “Timing is a funny thing”.\n\nHarry wrote a song about Taylor called ‘I Love You’ around the same time, where he also wrote “Maybe if I got my timing right, I wouldn’t end up alone”. Coincidence? I don’t think so.\n\n“this is the oldest song on the record and is co-produced I believe with Nathan Chapman, and is about how she was kinda with someone who wasn’t ready so they split up but they ended up back together” - Taylor’s 1989 secret sessions, hints at Harry.\n\n6. Clean:\n\n“Shake It Off” and “Clean” were the last two things we wrote for the record, so it shows you where I ended up mentally. “Clean” I wrote as I was walking out ofLiberty in London. Someone I used to date—it hit me that I’d been in the same city as him for two weeks and I hadn’t thought about it. When it did hit me, it was like, Oh, I hope he’s doing well.” - Taylor in Elle magazine interview, 2015\n\n“co-written with Imogen Heap (written when she was in London for the Red Tour and she went to her house which is two hours outside of London and is a single castle turret in the middle of this town with lots of horses and small town) and anyways it is about when she was in London and realized her ex was also there but she didn’t feel the usual sense of uneasiness and instead she felt fine and this is what this song is about” - Taylor’s 1989 secret sessions.\n\nHarry is British, he lives in London.\n\n-\n\nHarry has also referenced ‘Clean’ lyrics in ‘Olivia’, a song he wrote about Taylor:\n\n“This isn’t the stain of a red wine, I’m bleeding love” to Taylor’s “You’re all over me like a wine-stained dress I can’t wear anymore”\n\n“The summertime and the butterflies all belong to your creation” to Taylor’s “When the flowers that we’d grown together died of thirst, when the butterflies turned to dust that covered my whole room.”\n\nKeep reading\n\nkeepingupwithswift keepingupwithswift\n\nSo basically what this post is saying is the whole fucking album is about Harry Styles\n\nWell, to be fair I left out all the songs that isn’t about him.\n\nWelcome to New York - about herself\n\nBlank Space - about herself\n\nShake It Off - about herself\n\nBad Blood - about Katy Perry\n\nYou Are In Love - about Jack Antonoff and Lena Dunham’s relationship\n\nNew Romantics - about herself\n\nBut yeah the rest are about Harry\n\nTaylor Swift’s 1989 - Who are the songs about?\n\nI’ve seen some debate about this matter so I’m posting some of the things I’ve noticed from Taylor’s interviews / Listening Sessions just to clarify this matter.

It’s like, ‘S’up?’ ‘Miss you.’ That’s not gonna work (laughs). You need to do all the things in this song.” - GLAM interview, 2015, hints at Harry\n\n5. This Love:\n\nThis song is the oldest song on the track, and the linear notes described the song with the words “Timing is a funny thing”.\n\nHarry wrote a song about Taylor called ‘I Love You’ around the same time, where he also wrote “Maybe if I got my timing right, I wouldn’t end up alone”.

In this case I wanted it to sound kind of haunting, and so I sang this song differently than I’ve sung most of my other songs. I recorded it differently. You have multiple vocals going throughout the entire song. It’s about kind an experience I had where if you truly care about someone and you know they’re not ready to be in a relationship you will let them go, and it sucks to be the one has to let something go and cut someone loose when you don’t want to, but I think you have to be selfless in relationships when you know that it’s not the right time, and if you make that decision and that person is supposed to be in your life they’ll come back, and this was the way that I felt when that came back around.” - GLAM magazine, 2015. This is the only song she wrote alone and it also hints at Harry\n\n6. Clean:\n\n“Shake It Off” and “Clean” were the last two things we wrote for the record, so it shows you where I ended up mentally. “Clean” I wrote as I was walking out of Liberty in London. Someone I used to date—it hit me that I’d been in the same city as him for two weeks and I hadn’t thought about it.

He’s working with the best in the industry and has millions of fans desperate to see what he can come up with.\n\nSource: Daily Star\n\nHaylor (is dead) masterpost - 2016 edition\n\n*(Don’t take this seriously, I love reaching)\n\n**(I will keep updating this list as long as Haylor’s corpse keeps getting dragged out from the grave)\n\n31st Dec/1st Jan\n\n- Out Of The Woods video premiere.

He has changed it after the leak.\n\n(Rumor) 21st Jan\n\n- Haylorsecrets, an ‘insider’ blog dropped some tea explaining what went wrong between Harry and Taylor in 2015.\n\n23rd Jan\n\n- Taylor’s tumblr likes:\n\nText post about I Almost Do lyrics: “[…] I bet it never, ever occurred to you that I can’t say hello to you, and risk another goodbye”\n\n(Rumor) 25 Jan\n\n- 5Hexposed blog claims they have old receipts of Camila Cabello from Fifth Harmony trash-talking Taylor/Haylor with a friend on social media, pics were never released because of warnings from 5H’s management.\n\n30 Jan\n\n- Taylor’s likes:\n\nClean lyrics: “You’re still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can’t wear anymore”\n\n“Style was released in February […] now that she’s clean she’ll never risk it”\n\n31 Jan\n\n- Taylor’s likes:\n\nAnother photoset of Clean lyrics: “You’re still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can’t wear anymore”\n\n1st Feb\n\n- Harry tweets Taylor’s ‘22′ lyrics for his 22nd birthday:\n\n2nd Feb\n\n- Taylor’s likes on tumblr (she ignored Harry’s tweet, but liked this instead):\n\nKeep reading\n\ntameimpala222\n\nIt’s so funny how Treacherous’ secret message is ‘Won’t Stop Till It’s Over’ which is a line from Sweet Disposition by The Temper Trap, and automatically people link it to Jake because of All Too Well, even though the theme of Treacherous does not match any of the events of the Gyllenswift relationship, and the song itself was written in spring 2012 during/after the Haylor fling in April, with the same co-writer as ‘Come Back Be Here’ (which happens to be a song about Harry), and written consecutively in two days along with ‘Come Back Be Here’.\n\nThen we get Harry tweeting Sweet Disposition song lyrics twice in April 2012 during the Haylor fling (April 6 and April 23),\n\nGets a tattoo of Sweet Disposition lyrics ‘Won’t stop till we surrender’ on 16 June 2012 (which he got the lyrics wrong, but still).\n\n(Not a coincidence that the Treacherous secret message is ‘Won’t stop till it’s over, which is a line right before Harry’s tattoo lyrics ‘Won’t stop till we surrender’)\n\nAnd Taylor calls the song as her favourite song in an interview in Oct 2012 (during the time when she was already dating Harry), Sure Taylor has liked the song since 2009 but it’s pretty telling that the song is still her favourite in 2012, which also happens to be Harry’s favourite song at the time as well.\n\nThen Taylor approached The Temper Trap at the 2012 ARIAs to get the correct lyrics for Harry’s birthday, which is further proof that the song is significant to their relationship.\n\nAt this point we can safely argue that Sweet Disposition has become more of a Haylor thing than a Gyllenswift thing, yet people still scoff at us when we say the song is possibly about Harry…. *rolls eyes* Treacherous being about Harry is just as valid an interpretation as it is being about Jake or John.\n\nExpanded: Treacherous = Haylor?\n\nI know I said I’d be doing a proper Treacherous = Haylor post separately, but fuck it I’m just gonna dump everything here.\n\nOkay first, timeline. I’m gonna expand more on the timeline of Haylor’s April fling with the time that the song was written and how it actually syncs up.\n\n31 March 2012\n\n- Harry and Taylor meet at the Kids Choice Awards.\n\n- Harry tweets this (most likely referring to Taylor lmfao):\n\n5 April 2012\n\n- Justin Bieber invited both Taylor and One Direction to his LA mansion, where they swam and “just hung out”. Bieber told Britain’s Daily Mirror that “one of the biggest artists in the world thinks Harry is so hot, but I have been sworn to secrecy.”\n\n6 April 2012\n\n- One Direction is in New York for their SNL appearance. MTV interviews the boys and they tease Harry about Taylor.\n\n- Harry posts ‘Sweet Disposition’ lyrics on twitter (see post above about why it’s related to Treacherous and the Haylor relationship):\n\n8 April 2012\n\n- Taylor out and about in New York around the same time as the One Direction boys being in the city.\n\n- Unconfirmed sightings with her and a ‘mystery guy’ (Harry):\n\n- Taylor hanging out with girlfriends in New York:\n\n- One Direction and Taylor rumored to be at the Bowery Hotel together:\n\n(Bonus: A Taylor source later told Vanity Fair in 2013 about Taylor and Harry’s April fling as “a weekend where they got really close and he was all, like, ‘You’re amazing - I want to be with you. I want to do this.’)\n\n10 April 2012\n\n- One Direction leaves New York for Sydney, Australia.\n\n11 April 2012\n\nTaylor posts this picture on Instagram with the caption: “Recording for the next album. So happy.” The dress she’s wearing in this photo is the same as the one she wore on 8th April during her rumored date with Harry in New York.\n\n17 April 2012\n\n- Harry reveals to Australian newspaper The Herald Sun that he and Taylor have exchanged numbers and were texting, saying that: “We met in America. She is very talented. She’s very nice … We’re friends.”\n\n23 April 2012\n\n- Harry posts ‘Sweet Disposition’ lyrics on twitter again:\n\n- Harry caught ‘kissing’ Emily Ostilly in Auckland, New Zealand. According to a Taylor source for Vanity Fair in 2013, ‘he texted Taylor while on tour to alert her to pictures online where he was “kissing a friend good-bye.” When Taylor searched for the pictures, she discovered they were “making out with like their hands all up in each other’s hair.”’ Harry and Taylor’s relationship cooled down until they reconnected again 6 months later in September, 2012.\n\n2. Creation of ‘Treacherous’\n\nSo based on the Haylor relationship timeline, we’ve established that Taylor and Harry had a whirlwind fling in a matter of 11 days (about two weeks) from 31 March 2012 to 10 April 2012, and then communicated/texted while they were apart until 23 April 2012.\n\nNow let’s go into the timeline of the writing of Treacherous:\n\nDan Wilson, co-writer of Treacherous mentioned that he wrote two songs with Taylor within a period of two days sometime in spring 2012 (around 1:40 in this video) – the two songs being ‘Come Back Be Here’ and ‘Treacherous’.\n\nHere’s Dan Wilson in another interview in 2014 about writing Treacherous with Taylor:\n\nAVC: What’s the process when you’re writing with someone else?\n\nDW: It depends on how they work. With Taylor, we had been kind of circling around, very much aware of each other’s work for a while. We figured out these two days to work together and she came to my studio super excited and said, “I had an idea in the car.” And she sang me the first three or four lines of it and said, “I want to call it ‘Treacherous’ and maybe the chorus can go like this.” And we were writing the song in 10 minutes and she was just so full of excitement.\n\nDan Wilson also revealed in this interview that he had to sign an NDA (non-disclosure agreement) with Taylor when writing the songs, so we’ll never really find out who Treacherous is about. (But we CAN assume on our own, and I think a lot of it points to Harry)\n\nI’ve deduced that ‘Come Back Be Here’ is about Harry in this post, therefore there is also a high chance that ‘Treacherous’ is about Harry as well since both songs were written together.\n\nTaylor and Dan Wilson writing the songs in spring 2012 fits the timeline of the Haylor relationship, and Taylor was spotted in the studio recording for Red on 8 April 2012 so it’s very likely they wrote the songs during or after the Haylor fling (most likely after, I’m in the opinion that they wrote the songs in late April/early May).\n\n3. Treacherous = Style 0.5?\n\nWhat got me on this investigative journey in the first place is because of this post (thanks hun, you helped me a lot), and also because I always thought that Treacherous does not fit the popular opinion of the song being about Jake Gyllenhaal or John Mayer.\n\nFirst of all, just compare the confirmed Gyllenswift songs in Red (State of Grace, All Too Well, Red, WANEGBT, etc) with Treacherous, and you can see that the events or themes in Treacherous does not match the Gyllenswift relationship at all.\n\nThen we have Taylor singling out Treacherous and IKWYT as ‘being about the same person, in that Treacherous is before and IKWYT is after’ – which is significant because if these songs are about Jake like the rest of the album, there is no need to single them out in the first place, no? This makes me think that Treacherous and IKWYT is about a person who IS NOT Jake.\n\nSo now that we ruled out Jake, who else could it be? John Mayer? Okay first of all she really hates John Mayer do you really think she’s gonna waste any of her breath singing more love songs about him after she gone done that magnum opus pissing piece ‘Dear John’ in the previous album? I CAN somewhat see her writing IKWYT about John, but Treacherous?? Nah. I know I’m being a bit harsh but let’s be realistic here… And the secret message of Treacherous does not apply to John Mayer at all, so there’s that.\n\n(Talking about who inspired IKWYT is opening up a whole another can of worms on itself… there can be a solid argument that IKWYT was originally written with John Mayer in mind but I think it sort of morphed into something else later on. But that’s for another time! Let’s focus on Treacherous and Treacherous only.)\n\nIt was only when I applied Harry Styles to Treacherous that all the pieces started fitting together. Secret message of the song: ‘Won’t Stop Till It’s Over’ = Haylor related? Check. Timeline of the song creation with the Haylor fling matches up? Check. What about the song lyrics then?\n\nTwo headlights shine through the sleepless night\n\nAnd I will get you, and get you alone\n\nYour name has echoed through my mind\n\nAnd I just think you should, think you should know\n\nThat nothing safe is worth the drive and I would\n\nFollow you, follow you home…\n\nI’ll follow you, follow you home…\n\nI find it amusing that 2 years later, Taylor would go on to write another song in 1989 with similar lyrics and themes as Treacherous, which happens to be…. yup… you guessed it right… Style.\n\nTreacherous: “Two headlights shine through the sleepless night”\n\nStyle: “Midnight, you come and pick me up, no headlights”\n\nTreacherous: “That nothing safe is worth the drive”\n\nStyle: “A long drive, could end in burning flames or paradise”\n\nTreacherous: “Follow you, follow you home…”\n\nStyle: “Take me home, just take me home”\n\nOkay, just from the song lyric comparisons we could tell that Treacherous and Style have similar themes, but let’s confirm things even further with Taylor’s own words about the song:\n\nNPR interview, 2nd Nov 2012 (keep in mind Taylor was already dating Harry by this time):\n\n“I’ve had relationships with people that were really substantial and meant a lot to me, but I couldn’t write a song about that person for some reason. Then again, you’ll meet someone that comes into your life for two weeks and you write an entire record about them.“\n\nFor everyone arguing that Taylor couldn’t have possibly written two songs on Red about a mere two-week fling with Harry in April 2012…. here’s proof that she can. And she did.\n\nFrom USA Today interview, 17th October 2012 (keep in mind Taylor was already dating Harry by this time):\n\nAnother track, Treacherous, written with Wilson, is one of the most overtly sexual songs Swift has ever written and includes the line, \"I’ll do anything you say if you say it with your hands.”\n\n\"That song is about a person that I knew, from the minute I saw him, that it would end in fiery, burning wreckage,” she says. “There’s something about that magnetic draw that doesn’t really let up. You walk toward it anyway.”\n\nThe line about Treacherous being the most sexual song on the album is interesting, because Taylor would then go on to write similar risque-ish songs in 1989, like Style and Wildest Dreams, which happens to be about Harry as well.\n\nThen the line ‘it would end in fiery, burning wreckage’ in here reminds me of the line in Style ‘we go crashing down every time/could end in burning flames’… There’s definitely parallels in Taylor’s description of her relationship with Harry with the lyrics in Treacherous, and I don’t think it’s a coincidence.\n\nTaste of Country interview, 22nd October 2012 (keep in mind Taylor was already dating Harry by this time):\n\nI wrote ‘Treacherous’ with Dan Wilson, and we came up with a way to say, you know, ‘This is dangerous and I realize that I might get hurt if I go through with this, if I move forward with you. But… but I want to.’ You know? It’s like that kind of conflicted feeling of it being a risk every time you fall in love — especially with certain types of people [laughs].\n\nThat was a song that I’m really proud of, because it’s got this bridge that sounds like a second chorus. It’s got all these big vocals, and it’s kind of the intensity of that moment when you’re deciding to let yourself fall in love with someone.\n\nAnd again, Taylor is basically describing her relationship with Harry, as we would later find out in 1989.\n\nOther Taylor quotes about Treacherous, albeit unsourced:\n\nI wrote ‘I Knew You Were Trouble’ about the same person. That’s the before and after: ‘Treacherous’ is the before. ‘I Knew You Were Trouble’ is the after. [‘Treacherous’] is a song that I’m really proud of. It kind of covers ground that I haven’t covered before, that feeling of, even if it’s ill-fated, you want to pursue it to the very end. Even if we’re going down, I want in.“\n\n4. Summary:\n\nOkay so NOW we’ve already established that…\n\nSecret message of the song: ‘Won’t Stop Till It’s Over’ = Haylor\n\nTimeline of the song creation with the Haylor fling matches up\n\nThe lyrics and theme of Treacherous, as well as Taylor’s words about the song matches the Haylor fling/relationship\n\nCan we NOW finally accept the interpretation that Treacherous COULD be about Harry? I’m not saying it’s definitely about him, but I’m just gonna leave my case here and let you decide on your own…."
