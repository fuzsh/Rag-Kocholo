        "text": "Irina Shayk has an impressive dating history.\n\nWhile she's currently single, the 37-year-old supermodel can list actors, football players, NFL players, rappers and drummers among her exes. It's really a who's who of the world's biggest superstars.\n\nHere's the full list of Irina Shayk's high-profile relationships so far. Go girl.\n\nRob Bourdon\n\nWhile you may not recognise his name, you'll recognise his job. Rob Bourdon is the drummer for popular rock band Linkin Park and he dated Shayk from 2007 to 2009.\n\nThe pair kept things highly private. There aren't any photos of the two during their time together and they never disclosed why things ended, but multiple reports have confirmed they were together.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo\n\nIrina Shayk dated Cristiano Ronaldo for five years, marking the supermodel's longest relationship. Things started to get serious in 2010 after they reportedly met on the set of a Giorgio Armani shoot.\n\nAs one of the most famous models in the world, dating one of the most famous football players, the couple remained firmly in the spotlight for the entirety of their relationship.\n\nThey even appeared on the cover of Spanish Vogue together in a risque photo taken by renowned photographer Mario Testino. (Ronaldo was in the nude!)\n\nREAD MORE: The intrigue surrounding Cristiano Ronaldo and his children\n\nBut the cracks seemingly started to form after that, when Shayk signed on to film the Hercules movie with Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson. Their chemistry on set was reportedly so palpable that many speculated there was something more happening.\n\nShayk herself was even asked on a press junket what Ronaldo might think of her connection with Johnson: \"I don't know. You should ask him. This is good question.\"\n\nIn 2015, Ronaldo publicly announced their breakup. \"After dating for five years, my relationship with Irina Shayk has come to an end,\" he said in a statement to the Associated Press. \"We believed it would be best for both of us to take this step now. I wish Irina the greatest happiness.\"\n\nThe cause of their relationship breakdown hasn't been confirmed. However, prior to confirming the breakup, rumours swirled about an alleged feud between Shayk and Ronaldo's mother.\n\nShayk was quick to shut down the chatter in her own statement. \"Any negative rumours with regards to Irina and the Ronaldo family are completely false, and have not been a factor in the cause of the spilt. Irina has no further comment at this time.\"\n\nStars who stayed together after cheating scandals\n\nShayk spoke to Spanish outlet Hola! Magazine soon after about the lessons she's learned from her relationships, making a thinly veiled reference to how she felt while dating Ronaldo.\n\n\"I felt ugly and insecure,\" she told the magazine. \"I want a man who is faithful, honest, a gentleman who knows how to respect women. I don't think that men make us fall and make us feel unhappy, because that is not for men but for children.\"\n\nHer comments started speculation that their relationship had turned sour and that Ronaldo was unfaithful. Whatever happened between the two, it seems it didn't end amicably.\n\nFollowing their break up, Shayk lost 11 million followers on Instagram\n\nBradley Cooper\n\nSoon after she called it quits with Ronaldo, the Russian model was spotted with Hollywood actor Bradley Cooper. The pair officially dated for four years, until 2019.\n\nUnlike her glitzy relationship with the Al Nassr football star, Shayk kept things notably under wraps while dating Cooper. They were rarely photographed together and despite Shayk being spotted with a ring on her wedding finger, the two never confirmed an engagement.\n\nREAD MORE: Exes Bradley Cooper and Irina Shayk spark reunion rumours two years after split\n\nIn an interview with Glamour in February 2019, Shayk explained her aversion to sharing her personal life. \"I have a lot of friends who share a lot of their personal life on Instagram or social media, very publicly. I admire it and I think it's great â€“ but I think it's all about personal choice,\" she said.\n\n\"Because my work requires me to be out there, I just decided my personal life will be quiet. That's why it's called personal, because it's something for you and your family, and I feel happy with it.\"\n\nIn 2016, the couple shocked fans when they announced Shayk's pregnancy with their first child. Shayk gave birth to her and Cooper's daughter, Lea de Seine Shayk Cooper, in March 2017.\n\nIn July 2019, the pair confirmed they had split but will continue to raise Lea together. According to Shayk's comments about Cooper's role as a dad, it seems it's a successful transition from couple to co-parents. Even if she doesn't like it being called that.\n\nSinger and actress spotted on red carpet in rare joint appearance\n\n\"I never understood the term co-parenting,\" she told Elle in 2021. \"When I'm with my daughter, I'm 100 percent a mother, and when she's with her dad, he's 100 percent her dad. Co-parenting is parenting.\"\n\nIn the same interview, she also said Cooper is \"the most amazing dad\".\n\nThe two remain on good terms. Shayk shared even photos of the two on a family trip in the Bahamas in August 2022. While it sparked speculation the two were back together, it seems they're happy to remain friends.\n\nKanye West\n\nFor a hot minute following Shayk's split with Bradley Cooper, and West's from Kim Kardashian, the model and rapper were reportedly in a whirlwind relationship.\n\nThe two were first photographed together in France in June 2021, following months of rumours that the two were seeing each other.\n\nWhile it seemed unexpected from the outset, Shayk and West had actually been in each other's lives since at least 2010. The Russian model appeared in the music video for West's song 'Power'. She also walked in a 2012 Yeezy fashion show.\n\nHowever, by August 2021, things had fizzled out between the two.\n\nREAD MORE: Resurfaced music video shows Irina Shayk playing Kanye West's muse as couple's romance heats up\n\nTom Brady\n\nShayk laid low on the dating scene before she was linked with NFL quarterback Tom Brady in July 2023. After meeting at a wedding in May, the two were captured outside his house looking loved up."
