Courteney Cox has marked her 10th anniversary with partner Johnny McDaid by sharing a touching tribute on social media, filled with memories of their time together.

The Snow Patrol band member from Co Derry began dating the Friends actress in late 2013 and splits his time between London and Cox's US home.

Over the past few years, Courteney has been spotted by fans in Northern Ireland.

In an Instagram post on Monday, the actress shared a video with the caption: "10 years!!!"

It features snaps of the pair, with singer Ed Sheeran also featuring singing a short version of 'Shape of You' about the couple.

Courteney said: "10 years ago, This guy (Ed) introduced me to this guy (Johnny)."

One user commented: "Imagine being introduced to your partner by Ed Sheeran."

A second said: "You found your Chandler."

Courtney visited Bangor Marina in 2022 and was videoed waving at fans as Snow Patrol played a special acoustic gig that night.

Earlier his month, Snow Patrol revealed that two members would be leaving the band but that remaining members, including Johnny McDaid would continue to tour and release new music.

In a statement, frontman Gary Lightbody said: "Hi everyone, Sorry to be the bearer of such sad news but both Jonny Quinn and Paul Wilson have decided to leave Snow Patrol.

"We are heartbroken they have decided to leave us but we wish them nothing but happiness, success, joy, compassion and everything they want in all their future endeavours."

He added: "Nate, JMD and myself will continue with SP and there will be a new album next year but more news of that will come at an appropriate time, for now we want to pay homage and give gratitude for all Jonny and Pablo have given us and shared with us these past decades.

"Love to Jonny and Pabs, and love to you all."
