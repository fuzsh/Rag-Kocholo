Courteney gushed over how Johnny could do 'most anything' as she included pictures of him flying a plane, performing on stage, and catching a trout while out fishing.

She wrote: 'Happy birthday to the man who can do most anything. I love you always J.'

However, regarding the fishing picture, she added: 'Ps. He threw it back' along with an emoji of a fish, to indicate that they were practising catch-and-release fishing.

Their friends and followers quickly jumped to the comments to wish Johnny a happy birthday, with Jennifer Aniston leading the tributes, writing: 'Happy Birthday JMD' along with a love heart and a party face.

The couple, who have a 12-year age gap, have been dating since 2013, after being introduced by Ed Sheeran and quickly got engaged less than a year later.

They have had their ups and downs and briefly split in November 2014 and called off their engagement but were back together again by March 2015.

Courteney recently spoke about another painful split three years into their relationship when Johnny broke up with her during a couple's therapy session.

She now says she's 'so thankful for that break-up' because it taught her about the things that she needed to address and it gave her the chance to do the work that was needed to have a stronger relationship.
