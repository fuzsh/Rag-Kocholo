Courteney Cox and partner Johnny McDaid are celebrating their 10th anniversary with the help of pal Ed Sheeran.

The "Friends" alum took to Instagram on Monday to mark the milestone with a video montage featuring photos of her and McDaid, a member of the band Snow Patrol, from their past decade together.

"10 years ago this guy introduced me to this guy," she wrote in the video, referring to Sheeran and McDaid, respectively, crediting the "Thinking Out Loud" singer with being their matchmaker.

As the photos flash across the screen, Sheeran's song "Shape of You" plays in the background before revealing a unique twist on the popular song's lyrics from Sheeran himself.

"I know your heart is falling too, Johnny's in love with your body / Last night you were in his room, and now his bed sheets smell like you / Every day discovering something brand new, Johnny's beard is the shape of you," Sheeran sings as he touches McDaid's facial hair during the last line.

Cox ended the video with a message for McDaid, writing, "Happy anniversary J ❤️."
