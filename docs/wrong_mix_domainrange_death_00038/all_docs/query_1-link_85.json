Initially, the Oscars awarded two films with the 'Best Picture' trophy; and the award for 'Outstanding Picture'. Know about the iconic actor who founded the Oscar Awards.\n\nThe 2024 Oscar Awards will be held on Sunday, March 10, at the Dolby Theatre at Ovation Hollywood. These awards are given to celebrate all aspects of a filmâ€™s production, including crafts that tend to get less media attention. While celebrating films, it is natural to remember actor, comedian, and stunt artist, Harold Lloyd played, who played an important role in founding the Academy Awards. During the time of all-time greats like Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, Lloyd was one of the most popular comedy stars of the 'silent era' of Hollywood. It was a critical period in the development of the film industry that proved that the medium was both commercially viable and artistically rewarding and led to the emergence of great cinema within the 1920s.\n\n#Budget' 2024 with ET\n\nUnion Budget 2024 Live Updates\n\nHuge loyal fan of Harold Llyod\n\nHarold Llyod enjoyed a huge loyal fan base due to his signature personality. Though his films and shorts varied in terms of story, and rarely shared any continuity, they generally reflected the ambitions and struggles of general people as the protagonist found himself caught up in inordinately chaotic circumstances.\n\nLlyod establishes Academy Awards\n\nLloyd joined a group of actors and filmmakers in 1927 and founded the Academy Awards of Motion Pictures Arts & Sciences.

The Academy has added and changed many categories in the years since, but awards like Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Cinematography have remained the same.\n\nHarold Lloyd Gets Honorary Award\n\nThough Harold Lloyd never received any competitive awards, the iconic actor got an Honorary Award in 1953 for being \"a master comedian and good citizen.\" Honorary Awards are often used by the Oscars to reward artists whose work never received the attention it deserved at the time of their release.\n\nFAQs:\n\nWho founded the Academy Awards?\n\nIconic actor Harold Lloyd joined a group of actors and filmmakers in 1927 and founded the Academy Awards of Motion Pictures Arts & Sciences.
