        "text": "Eames, George A.\n\nDIED, at Lampasas Springs, May 21, 1885, Mr. George A. Eames, in his twenty-eighth year, eldest son of Mr. and Mrs. A. F. Eames. Many of the friends of Mr. Eames were thrilled with sadness when we learned the bereaved parents were coming to lay another son to rest by the side of his brother Willie, who was buried here [Columbus City Cemetery] in 1877. Thus one by one the shadows gather, one by one the blossoms wither from the gardens of our care, one by one the hearts we cherish, vanish down the stream of time. Dear friends, once more there is a vacant chair in your home, once more an aching void in your hearts; while you are bereft your loved one is blessed. It seems superfluous for me to speak of virtues so well known, parents know best the tenderness of his noble heart. Weeping brothers and sisters will miss his gentle words in the home circle. Friends will not soon forget his many manly virtues. The greatest eulogy I could pronounce is: He died a Christian. Parents, brothers, sisters, friends, if we are faithful here, in the resurrection morn, we will clasp the hand of our departed loved ones in blissful reunion while here, “The mourners throng the way.\n\nAnd from the steeple the funeral bell tolls slow\n\nBut on the golden streets the holy people are passing to and fro\n\nAnd saying as they meet, rejoice another so early has come\n\nThe Saviors heart is glad a younger brother has reached the Fathers home.\n\nColorado Citizen, June 11, 1885\n\nEames, Willie F.\n\nSad AccidentYesterday evening about 6 1/2 o’clock young Will F. Eames, one of the operators in the telgraph office at this place, was drowned in the Colorado river above the railroad bridge. In company with Gail B., son of Judge J. W. Johnson, he had went in bathing late in the evening and attempted to swim across the river. Not being an expert at swimming, and fearing he might fail, he requested Gail to follow along behind him and assist in case of need. Before reaching the other shore he gave out, and Gail endeavered to get him out, and came near being drowned himself in the attempt, but was unable to accomplish the desired object. They both sank, Gail got loose and came ashore, but young Eames never rose again. He was a clever young man, made a great many strong friends since his stay here, and his loss is deeply regretted. His parents reside in Mt. Vernon, Ill. His body was recovered at 10 o’clock last night.

[Place of interment unknown.]\n\nThe body was identified as that of Frank Earle, a man about 48 years old who had been arrested here on October 5th for disturbing the peace and was released from the county farm only last Friday.\n\nThe man had been drinkng whiskey and probably fell a leep in the cattle guarad and on hearing the approach of the train tried to get out but instead was hurled into eternity.\n\nEarle was a man of powerful physique and one of the best workers ever placed on the county farm.

Of the angel-child it may be said that--\n\nAs a cloud of the sunset slow-melting in heaven,\n\nAs a star that is lost when the daylight is given,\n\nAs a glad dream of slumber which wakens in bliss,\n\nShe has passed to the world of the holy from this.\n\n[Interment in Columbus Odd Fellows Rest]\n\nColorado Citizen, May 31, 1888, page 3\n\nEason, Adam\n\nOakland Remarks\n\nWe had a sudden death to occur near here last Sunday, that of Uncle Adam Eason, a freedman, who has lived in the neighborhood for over thirty years.

Eason, consort of Mr. Wm Eason, which occurred near Diamond Grove, on the evening of the 26th Ultimate in her 29th year. Mrs. Eason possessed many noble qualities and bore her afflictions with patience.

Physicians there were satisfied her case was serious and so informed her parents, she grew worse rapidly and passed away Monday.

I think he had been sick four days before he came here he was not confined entirely to his bed til Monday before his death but was able to sit up half his time having fever in the afternoon his disease was Camp fever, or perhaps more properly termed typhoid fever. He received a letter from you on the Saturday evening before he died he was delighted to hear from you and told me you were all well and that he would reply in a few days, which he never was able to do. He told me also that he was a member of the Methodist Church and remembered whilst in camp the Sabbath while many seemed to disregard it he was a consistent good man, very quiet he spoke often of you and children no fears were entertained contrary to his recovery til Monday Night, he went to the supper table though with some fever, drank a cup of coffee and said to Mr. Knight the coffee was good and was sweating, but about 10 oclock he was taken with severe pains in his bowels we sent for his physician, he appeared relieved in the morning but had great difficulty breathing and continued so til death he could talk but with shortness of breath prevented it. He was perfectly in his senses to the last. Mr. Knight brought him out here and no brother could have been more attentive and kind than Mr. Knight was to your husband. They buried him six miles from here. After your kind husband was laid out I looked at him and thought and felt so much for you and clipt a lock of his hair which I will enclose in this letter to you.\n\nIn conclusion we did all we could to alleviate or soften your husbands illness.\n\nI know from sad, yet sweet experience that it is some alleviation of our grief to find that your grief is shared by others, although the only true and permanent consolation can derive from Christ Jesus. Never til I lost my dear husband did I know how to feel for one in similar case, now I can enter into their grief, and my heart vibrates in unison with theirs. Should you wish to make inquiries you can do so by addressing me at Oakland, Texas.\n\nThere faith lifts up the tearless eyes,\n\nThe heart with anguish given;\n\nIt views the tempest passing by,\n\nLess evening shadows quickly flys\n\nAnd all serene in Heaven.\n\nHarriet B.

Elstner of Holman, Fayette county. The shooting occurred in the store of S. D. Chapman, and Mr. Chapman surrendered to the officers, acknowledging that he did the shooting. There had been previous trouble between the parties, the nature of which and the exact causes which led up to the shooting Tuesday morning, we did not learn. Elstner was shot through the lower lobe of one ear, one ball went through his mouth, cutting his tongue and knocking out two teeth, another brazed his back near the waist line, while the fourth struck his right shoulder blade, breaking same and ranging inward. This last named shot caused his death. Elstner was perfectly rational throughout the day, but a few hours after the shooting lost the power of speech. He was carried to his home near Holman Tuesday afternoon, and died that night about midnight. He leaves a wife and three little children in destitute circumstances. His remains were buried in the Catholic cemetery here Wednesday afternoon. Chapman was carried to Columbus Tuesday afternoon, and on Thursday was brought back for his examining trial. He waived examination, and was released under $2500 bond. The affair is deeply regretted by all our people.\n\nWeimar Mercury, November 10, 1900, page 6\n\nElterman, Floyd L.\n\nF. L.
