        "meta_description": "Title supplied by cataloger.; \"The address is sometimes given as 1225 Benedict Canyon Drive, but the official address of the mansion today is 1740 Greenacres Drive.\"Harold Lloyd was born on April 20, 1893 in Burchard, Nebraska. He was an American actor, comedian, film director, producer, screenwriter, and stunt performer who is best known for his silent comedy films. He was also a founding member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. He was one of the most popular actors of the silent film era along with Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin. Lloyd's performance hanging from the hands of a clock high above the street in Safety Last! (1923) is one of the most iconic images in all of cinema. Lloyd began acting at the age of 20 and became friends with filmmaker Hal Roach. In 1919 he was seriously injured while holding what he thought was a prop bomb. It exploded, causing him to lose the thumb and forefinger of his right hand. By 1921 Lloyd and Roach moved from short films to feature length comedies. The films were popular and highly profitable, making him one of the wealthiest and most influential figures in early Hollywood. Lloyd married actress Mildred Davis on Saturday, February 10, 1923 in Los Angeles. The couple had three children (one adopted). After the silent film era, his popularity waned and he basically retired from film. In 1944 he became director and host of a radio anthology series that lasted only one season. He became involved in civic and charity work and experimented with photography. He died on March 8, 1971.; The Harold Lloyd Estate, also known as Greenacres, was designed by Sumner Spaulding and built in the late1920s. It is located in the Benedict Canyon section of Beverly Hills.The property originally included a 44-room mansion, which was Lloyd's residence until his death in 1971, a golf course, and outbuildings. The property was later subdivided into multiple lots, but the mansion, remaining intact, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. In addition, the home is also a California Historical Landmark and a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument.Photograph caption reads \"Palatial living room at Harold Lloyd home on Benedict Canyon Drive houses pipe organ and movie projector booth.\" Part of the living room is pictured. Pictured are stuffed sofas and chairs, lamps, rugs and a fireplace. There are two sets of French doors with the draperies pulled back to let in the light. The large fireplace has a decorative screen and flowers and plants decorate the room. A hand railing is behind one of the sofas. The mansion is located at 1740 Greenacres Drive in Beverly Hills, near Benedict Canyon Drive.",
