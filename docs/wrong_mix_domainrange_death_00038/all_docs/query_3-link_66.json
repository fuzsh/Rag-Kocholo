        "text": "Question One:\n\nWhen ranking the silent movie actors, I take a few things into consideration, if they make me laugh, how they make me laugh, and if I want to watch more of their films. When taking these three things into consideration I ranked the comedians as my favorite being Harold Lloyd, second being Charlie Chaplin, and my least favorite being Buster Keaton.\n\nThe reason why I liked Harold Lloyd more than the other two actors is due to the way that he made me laugh. His persona was a character that was easy to relate to and that made him seem real.

His character is one that is easy to like and want to get to know better. He seems to have this personality that has an air of childish enjoyment that makes it easy to connect to. The amount of emotion that he shows in every situation, while a little much, is interesting to watch and leaves you feeling the same way he does in the scene. For example, at the end of “City Lights” when the tramp gives his signature smile, when the no longer blind girl realizes that her rich man is standing in front of her and isn’t a rich man, I was left with a similar smile on my face when the screen went"
