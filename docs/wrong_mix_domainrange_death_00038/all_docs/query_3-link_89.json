        "text": "CINCINNATI (WXIX) - It is the beginning of a new era for the Downtown branch of the Cincinnati and Hamilton County Public Library and the end of a $43.4 million renovation project.\n\nThe Downtown library, currently located in the two blocks of Vine, Prior, Walnut and East 8th Streets, has been a source of knowledge for thousands of Cincinnati residents since the early 1800s. The current location has been around since 1874 and has managed to survive for more than a century.\n\nFriday, July 12, will be the first official opening day for the library, and staff members are gearing up for a weekend full of celebrating the end of a 4-year plan.\n\nOut with the old, in with the new\n\nAttendees will find redesigned spaces, such as the kids and teens zones, the new Catherine C. and Thomas E.
