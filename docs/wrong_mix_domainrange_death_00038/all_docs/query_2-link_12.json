        "meta_description": "Title supplied by cataloger.; Original photograph has some light colored stains.Harold Lloyd was born on April 20, 1893 in Burchard Nebraska. He was an American actor, comedian, film director, producer, screenwriter, and stunt performer who is best known for his silent comedy films. He was also a founding member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. He was one of the most popular actors of the silent film era along with Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin. Lloyd's performance hanging from the hands of a clock high above the street in Safety Last! (1923) is one of the most iconic images in all of cinema. Lloyd began acting at the age of 20 and became friends with filmmaker Hal Roach. In 1919 he was seriously injured while holding what he thought was a prop bomb. It exploded, causing him to lose the thumb and forefinger of his right hand. By 1921 Lloyd and Roach moved from short films to feature length comedies. The films were popular and highly profitable, making him one of the wealthiest and most influential figures in early Hollywood. Lloyd married actress Mildred Davis on Saturday, February 10, 1923 in Los Angeles. The couple had three children (one adopted). After the silent film era, his popularity waned and he basically retired from film. In 1944 he became director and host of a radio anthology series that lasted only one season. He became involved in civic and charity work and experimented with photography. He died on March 8, 1971.; May Robson was born Mary Jeanette Robison on April 15, 1858 in Australia. A major stage actress of the late 19th and early 20th century, Robson is best known for the many films she appeared in when she was well into her seventies, often playing angry old ladies with hearts of gold. She died on October 20, 1942.; Architect Charles H. Kyson designed the 1925 Tower of Legends at Forest Lawn and Finn Haakon Frolich was the sculptor. The carved bass-relief symbolizes progress, genius and religion. The Tower was demolished in 1948 to make way for the 1951 Italian Gothic cathedral known as the Hall of The Crucifixion-Resurrection, which was designed exclusively to house two paintings on the life of Christ.Harold Lloyd is pictured at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California, to attend services for actress May Robson. He is walking towards steps, with lawns, some automobiles and the Tower of Legends behind him. Photograph dated October 23, 1942.",
