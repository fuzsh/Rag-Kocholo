        "text": "Harold Lloyd Cook, Jr., 70, of Sabetha, Kansas, passed away on June 6, 2024, surrounded by friends.\n\nHarold was born to Harold Cook, Sr., and Barbara (Philpot) Cook on September 8, 1953, in Fort Knox, Kentucky. Harold was a dedicated truck driver for Keim Transportation for an impressive 36 years, where his work ethic and commitment were deeply valued.\n\nWhen Harold wasn't on the road, he enjoyed fishing, bowling, and shooting pool. He was known for his kindness, generosity, and willingness to lend a helping hand whenever it was needed. Harold's warm personality and caring nature earned him the love and respect of many.\n\nIn addition to his civilian life, Harold proudly served his country as a United States Marine from 1969 to 1973. His service included a tour of duty in Okinawa, Japan. His service to our country will be remembered with gratitude and respect.\n\nHarold was preceded in death by his parents, and his brother, David Lee Cook.\n\nHarold is survived by his daughter, Jamie Michelle, and many close friends who affectionately called him \"Uncle Harold.\"\n\nHarold's legacy of dedication, service, and kindness will be cherished by all who knew him.\n\nHaroldâ€™s wish was to be cremated and to have no services."
