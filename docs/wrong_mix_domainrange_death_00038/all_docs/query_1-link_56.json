        "text": "Harold Lloyd (April 20, 1893 – March 8, 1971) was an American film star best known for his thrilling comedies of the silent era.\n\nQuotes\n\n[edit]\n\nLove is the closest thing to laughter and the closest thing to tears. Love is the motive power of everything in the universe that has beauty in it. Love is the reason for everything and the reward for everything.\n\nIt’s always seemed strange to me that we have to use the word love for so many things. And yet when you come to think of it, that’s all right, too, because love is in everything in some form or another. Without it, I imagine the flowers would stop blooming and the sun would stop shining and people would stop laughing, and even the rain wouldn’t fall.\n\nSo love is always growth.\n\nI think if I could have just one word for love—it would be understanding.\n\nLove must always be unselfish, and strangely enough, love is the only thing in the world that ever is unselfish. And if it isn’t unselfish, it’s only a counterfeit of love.\n\n\"What is Love? Twelve Men of the Screen Give Their Ideas\". Photoplay, February 1925, p. 36. (Photoplay Publishing Company).[1]\n\nI find that I would like now, best of all, to be a good conversationalist. I know I'm not one at present. Oh, I can sit and talk a little of this and that, but I realize that I haven't any definite or profound knowledge. I won't be satisfied with just a patter, a surface glaze of information. I don't want short-cuts to learning. I want to know all about the thing I study.\n\nI'd like to be able to hold my own, to meet on a common ground, with scientists, inventors, clerics, doctors, athletes, authors.\n\nThe most worthwhile thing in life is to store your mind with knowledge.\n\nI wish now that I had been able to go to college, if only so that I might have had appreciations earlier in the game.\n\nPeople often say to me now that I have my home, my career, fame (if you call it that), there must be nothing left for me to live for. But there is everything left to live for. All the things I don't know about, all the things I want to know about.\n\nPictures, I've discovered, were practically all I did know about up to very recently. I've had to work so hard, to concentrate so closely, that I never have had time to read or to travel or to think about other things. I'm just at the beginning of living...\n\n\"Discoveries About Myself\". Motion Picture, October 1930, pg. 58 & 90. (Brewster Publications). [2] [3]\n\nI love competition.\n\nI'd rather have to fight and worry than be peaceful and secure, any day.\n\nI've found that I'm a peaceful, easy-going sort of a fellow about all the small things in life. But when a big issue comes along and when I feel I'm right about it—well, I guess I'm pretty stubborn. Even nasty.\n\nI've taken up golf. I'm crazy about it. Doug Fairbanks and I play every day that we can get away from work. I not only like the game a lot, but I want to master it. I'm not satisfied just to play golf. I want to be good at it. That's the way I've come to feel about everything.\n\n\"Discoveries About Myself\". Motion Picture, October 1930, pg. 90. (Brewster Publications). [4]\n\nI find that I have great faith in human nature. I believe that people are good. I believe they are to be trusted. So far as I know, no one has ever betrayed my faith, in any way. If they ever have, I've been spared the knowledge of it.\n\nIf I couldn't have faith in human nature, I wouldn't want to live. It is the one thing that could destroy for me the joy of living.\n\nI've come to believe that life, under almost any conditions, is worth while.\n\nI found that out when I had my accident some years ago, and was in the hospital.\n\nI thought, for a couple of weeks, that I would be blind for life. I thought I would surely be so disabled that I would never be able to work again. I didn't suppose that I would have one five-hundredth of what I have now. Still I thought, 'Life is worth while. Just to be alive.' I still think so.\n\n\"Discoveries About Myself\". Motion Picture, October 1930, pg. 90. (Brewster Publications). [5]\n\nI used old comic clothes stuff in the early days. I had the big shoes, I had the tight clothes, in fact I played several different characters. I played one called Willie Work; he used to have wide shoulders, a little cat mustache, a high hat. Another one was called Lonesome Luke, and his clothes were tight with a little funny hat; he had a funny little mustache. But when I adopted the glasses, it more or less put me in a different category because I became a human being. He was a kid that you would meet next door, across the street, but at the same time I could still do all the crazy things that we did before, but you believed them. They were natural and the romance could be believable.\n\n1962 TV interview with Harry Reasoner.\n\nMy humor was never cruel or cynical. I just took life and poked fun at it. We made it so it could be understood the world over, without language barriers. We seem to have conquered the time barrier, too.\n\nDecember 1970, four months before his death [6]\n\nWikipedia has an article about:"
