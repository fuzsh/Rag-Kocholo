        "text": "1867 Â· The Chicago Water Tower\n\nThe Chicago water tower was built out of Lemont limestone by William W. Boyington and was used for firefighting and also drawing clean water from Lake Michigan. The tower gained prominence after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. Some believe that the tower was the only building to survive the Great Chicago Fire, but a few other buildings survived alongside the tower. The tower has become a symbol of old Chicago and how the city recovered from the fire. The tower has undergone only two renovations since 1913.Â\n\n1869 Â· Transcontinental Railroad Reaches San Francisco\n\nThe first transcontinental railroad reached San Francisco in 1869. The Western Pacific Railroad Company built the track from Oakland to Sacramento. The Central Pacific Railroad Company of California built the section from Sacramento to Promontory Summit Utah. The railroad linked isolated California to the rest of the country which had far-reaching effects on the social and economical development of the state.\n\n1885 Â· The First Skyscraper\n\nThe Home Insurance Building is considered to be the first skyscraper in the world. It was supported both inside and outside by steel and metal that were deemed fireproof and also it was reinforced with concrete. It originally had ten stories but in 1891 two more were added."
