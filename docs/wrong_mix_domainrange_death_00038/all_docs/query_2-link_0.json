        "text": "Harold Lloyd (born April 20, 1893, Burchard, Nebraska, U.S.—died March 8, 1971, Hollywood, California) was an American film comedian who was the highest-paid star of the 1920s silent era of film and one of cinema’s most popular personalities.\n\n(Read Lillian Gish’s 1929 Britannica essay on silent film.)\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nLloyd, the son of an itinerant commercial photographer, began acting as a child. He settled in San Diego, California, where in 1913 he started playing minor parts in one-reel comedies. He mastered the art of the comic chase in the short time he was a member of Mack Sennett’s Keystone comedy troupe. In 1915 Lloyd joined the new acting company formed by Hal Roach, a former actor who had turned producer. During this period he experimented with a comic character, the bewhiskered Willie Work. The most consistently successful of his early films, however, were those of the Lonesome Luke series, which began with Spit-Ball Sadie (1915). Luke quickly became a popular American screen character, appearing in dozens of movies over the next two years.\n\nBy 1918 the figure of the ordinary white-faced man in round glasses had replaced Luke as Lloyd’s screen trademark. This persona eclipsed Lonesome Luke in popularity, and by 1922 Lloyd was making feature-length movies. He developed his humour from plot and situation and was the first comedian to use physical danger as a source of laughter. Lloyd performed his own stunts and was known as the screen’s most daring comedian. In Safety Last! (1923), an outstanding success, he hung from the hands of a clock several stories above a city street; in Girl Shy (1924) he took a thrilling ride atop a runaway streetcar; in The Freshman (1925), one of the most successful of all silent pictures, he stood in for the football tackling dummy."
