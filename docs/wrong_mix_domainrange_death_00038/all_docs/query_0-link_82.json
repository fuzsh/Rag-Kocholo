See below.\n\n\"On the 16th of October 1832, came John SNODDY, resident of Montgomery township in said county of Owen, aged 74 years and 7 months on the 23rd September last, who makes the following declaration in order to obtain the benefit of the Act of Congress passed June 7, 1832. That he entered the service of the U.S. early in 1775 in the militia of North Carolina as a volunteer under General Rutherford in Rowan County, North Carolina where he then resided; also under Captain James Purviance and Lt. John Purviance, for a term of 3 months. In the month of April 1775 he finished this tour of service. He also served other tours of duty which he cannot recollect, but in 1778 he volunteered for a continued series of services until one or two months after the taking of Cornwallis at Yorktown in 1782. This service was under Major Micajah Lewis, who was after-wards killed in the lower part of North Carolina. Also under the command of Colonel Cleveland and Moses Guess, as service of about two years, were called \"Lewis Minutemen\". His residence was starting this service in Wilkes County. The service here spoken of was performed in counties of Burke, Lincoln, Rutherford, Wilkes, Rowan and Micklenburg and part of the time in South Carolina. He again entered the service under Major Joseph Dickson and Captain William Stuart for ca three or four months serving principally in North Carolina in Rowan and Micklenburg counties. Some of the names of the Continental officers who were occasionally united with troops in the corps to which he belonged were: Colonel Martin, Captain Knox, Captain George Davidson, Captain Lenoir, and Colonel Isaacs. He was in Surry County for about 3 months. He has long since been disconnected with his old companions in arms, having emigrated to Kentucky in 1782. He brought with him his certificate of his fidelity to his country herein enclosed - s/William Sharpe. This declarant further states that he lived 41 years in Kentucky, migrating there in 1782 after his little property had been destroyed by the Tories. Has lived in Owen County, Indiana for 9 years. He was born in 1758 in Rowan County, North Carolina. s/John Snoddy.\"\n\n(National Archives, Washington, DC, Revolutionary War Pension, File S-17, 100)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJanuary 1775 - Enlisted for 3 months as private under Captain James Purvines and General Rutherford in NC.\n\nJanuary 1778 - Enlisted for 2 years, private under Captain Gass and Col.

At about four o'clock Friday morning, August 7, 1903, just as another day was beginning for the living, at the wee small hour when natural sleep seems so restful, there came the Death Angel to this home and kissed away the dear mother so sweetly and so calmly that those who were at her side hardly knew the moment the last breath was drawn. Mary J. Snoddy, daughter of Ephriam and Catharine Bennett, was born in Lebanon, Ohio, August 28, 1832, and died at her home near Whitcomb, August 7, 1903, aged 70 years, 11 months and 21 days. She was married to John Snoddy, Sept. 2, 1857. To them were born seven children, two of whom are dead. Three daughters, two sons and eleven grand-children are left to mourn the loss of mother and grandmother. When two and one-half years old she moved with her parents to the farm where she died. With the exception of a few years her entire life was spent in this community. She was a member of the Presbyterian Church, joining a number of years ago. She learned then of the sweet promises of Jesus and ever confided in his mercies and has been faithful and true in her devotion unto him. She was bereft of her husband on March 24, 1902, since which time she has been cared for by her children. She has been in poor health for nearly four years, but was able to attend to her household duties until her husband's death, when her afflictions gradually grew worse and her family realized she would soon be called away. She bore her sufferings patiently to the end, and would often say she was ready to go. Pluming her wings as it were for the final flight to that blessed country where sickness and sorrow never come, God gave the call and she entered into rest forever. Mrs. Snoddy was a good neighbor, a loving mother and leaves a number of relatives and friends to mourn their loss. The home circle is broken, mother's chair is vacant, mother's song is hushed, but her example and works are with us today. [Obit provided by Marvin D.

NEVER MARRIED.\n\nNotes for ALEXANDER ABSALOM SNODDY:\n\nObit: Danville Courier, IN - September 17, 1903, page 8, column 4: Alexander A. Snoddy, son of Absolem and Irene Jones Snoddy, was born December 28, 1844, on a farm in Franklin township owned at the time by his father and still remaining as the property of some of the relatives. He died September 8, 1903, at the age of fifty-eight years, eight months and ten days.\n\nHis early life was spent on the farm, taking advantage of the opportunities offered for an education. He was left without a mother when he was three years old. The care of him fell to his sister, Silva. She cared for him as only a sister can when the mother is gone. She ministered to his wants all along his earthly pilgrimage. It was at her home and from her hands that he received the kindest of treatment during the last six months of severe sickness which was borne by him with such great patience the like of which can scarcely be found among the suffering anywhere.\n\nAlexander Snoddy loved his country and in October 1862, before he was eighteen years of age, he enlisted in the Union army - Company B, 54th regiment. His regiment left Indianapolis December 9, for the battlefield without much military discipline. On December 27-29, he was in three days of battle near Vicksburg in which his regiment lost 264 men. On January 11, he was in the battle of Arkansas Post in which the regiment lost no men. On May 1, he was in the battle of Shafer's plantation which occurred without the loss of men to his regiment. During the battle of Jackson, Mississippi, which lasted three days, two of his company were killed. They were marched from Jackson to Vicksburg which was a severe task indeed as food was scarce. They were compelled to subsist largely upon roasting ears and to wade dust shoe-top deep. In the fall of 1863, he marched through Louisiana, 200 miles west of New Orleans and returned in November.\n\nThe winter of 1862-63 was spent at Young's Point, Louisiana. This was a distressing time, as many of the soldiers died there. They could be buried in shallow graves because of so much water in the earth. He was sick there and spent a portion of his time in the hospital. Indeed, many of the boys were sick and at times it was difficult to find enough well ones for guard duty. He was mustered out of the service on December 8, 1863, at New Orleans.\n\nAfter coming home and remaining for a time, he felt constrained to return to the army. In August 1864, he re-inlisted in the 43rd regiment. During this last period, the service was not very severe. Yet, whoever spent time upon the field of war was injured more or less physically. Alexander enjoyed talking upon his army life and why not? Who has rendered his country better service than the one who took his gun upon his shoulder and marched in front of the cannon's mouth.\n\nHe was a good citizen -- honorable, upright and honest in all his dealings with men. If he owed a dollar, it was paid with 100 cents and not with 97 or 98 as many seek to do. He was a good neighbor, kind and possessed of jovial disposition. Such a trait of character is calculated to lighten the burden of those who came in contact with it. Thus, a life of nearly fifty-nine years which has been lived in this neighborhood ends.\n\nHe leaves a sister, Silva Masten, and a brother, James Snoddy, who lives in the far west, and many other relatives and a host of friends to mour their loss. Funeral services were held at the residence of Fay and Cyrus Masten, Thursday morning, conducted by Rev. Tincher, of Stilesville, after which he was borne in a beautiful oak casket embanked with flowers to the old Snoddy cemetery, two miles east of Stilesville. [Obituary provided by Marvin D.

HANNAH L.5 SNODDY (ABNER4, JOHN3, SAMUEL2, UNKNOWN1) was born Dec 05, 1827 in Logan Co, OH, and died Jan 13, 1902 in Ridgeway, Logan Co, OH. She married URIAH BALDWIN Sep 05, 1848 in Hale Twp, Champain Co, OH, son of DANIEL BALDWIN and HANNAH WILLIAMS. He was born May 30, 1824 in Champaign Co, OH, and died Feb 08, 1905 in Champaign Co, OH.\n\nNotes for URIAH BALDWIN:\n\n(Information from Jan Smith, JMSFIJI@cs.com, April 2, 2000.) Daniel Baldwin (father) was born in Tennessee about 1795-1800. He migrated to Ohio as a very young man, (from the book, The History of Hardin Co) and married Hannah Williams 11-6-1817 In Champaign County, Ohio (documented in County files). They gave birth to Uriah Baldwin 5-30-1824, Champaign Co. Hannah died 10-8-1847 in Logan County, Ohio. Daniel and Hannah were living in Logan Co. 1830, and then, in 1835 , moved to Hardin Co., Hale Township, onto land that was originally owned by Charles Allen. Daniel was a farmer, justice of the peace, and a judge during his lifetime. In 1840, they continued to live in Hardin Co.,and Hannah died 1847. In 1860 Daniel moved to Liberty Township, Logan County and married Miss Unknown Steward. There are many Baldwin's in Ohio. I have run across Nathaniel, Walter, Henry, Enos, Anna, who were living in the immediate area of Mt. Victory, Ridgeway, Ohio, and Logan County. I have not been able to link them. I have not been able to find Daniel's birthdate, parents names, siblings names, birthplace in Tennessee, what year he migrated to Ohio, who was with him, or the specific route he took. I am still searching. Uriah Baldwin was born 6-30-1824, Champaign Co. I do not know if he had siblings. He was a pioneer in Hale Township and owned 122 acres of land which he farmed all of his life. The land was 2 miles west of Mt. Victory and he lived there for 64 years. I THINK he received the land as his pay for fighting in the Confederacy, 135th Regiment, O.V.I., in the Civil War. He married Hannah L. Snoddy 9-5-1848 in Hale Township. Apparently, Uriah was a very weathly farmer. He was a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church. According to his newspaper obituary, which I have, he built the first house in the town of Ridgeway, and lived there 6 years before moving to the farm. This fact is disputed, as another man receives credit for the first house in the book, The History of Hardin Co.Uriah is buried in Hale Cemetery and his tombstone still stands. Uriah and Hannah had 7 children: Abner who married Mariah Richardson 5-24-1879, and were divorced at some time later. According to family history, Abner was an irresponsible man who couldn't care less about his wife and children (a real black sheep!). I do not have any information about the siblings except that 4 were still living at the time of Uriah's death 2-8-1905. At some point, Abner migrated across the US and settled in California. I do not know if other siblings or relatives were with him. Mariah was with him. They had several children: Lena Marie, Bd. 12-2-1882,D. 12-8-1960; Parker Pope, Bd.7-18-1880, D. about 1943; Lulu, Bd. 4-17-1885; J. Clark Washington , Bd. 8-8-1890; George Washington, Bd. 1-31-1893, D. about 1972. There is also an Inez Baldwin and I have not been able to determine if she is a child of Uriah's or a sister. I have a letter from her to the family in California, 1905, notifying them of Uriah's death. All of Uriah's children were born in Ohio. Abner's migration was after his marriage to Mariah. Uriah's children scattered to California, Chicago, Hawaii, Louisiana, and Chile during their lifetimes.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInformation from web site: http://heritagepursuit.com/HarHale.htm\n\nURIAH BALDWIN, farmer, P. O. Mount Victory, was born in Champaign County, Ohio, May 30, 1824, and is a son of Daniel and Hannah Baldwin. His father, a farmer by occupation, was born in Tennessee, and his mother in Ohio, in which State they were married, settling in Champaign County, thence coming to Hardin County in 1835. Mrs. Baldwin died here October 8, 1847, and her husband subsequently married a Miss Steward and moved to Logan County, Ohio, where he died March 6, 1866, his widow following him January 17, 1883. The subject of this sketch chose farming for his occupation, and some years ago bought 122 acres of land, to which he has since added forty acres, and is now living on the farm. He was married, September 5, 1848 to Hannah L., daughter of Abner and Hannah Snoddy. She was born in Logan County. Ohio, December 5, 1827. This union has resulted in seven children, of whom five are living, viz., Joan (wife of A. T. Sponsler), Daniel. Abner. Dora Inez, Beulah and an infant (deceased). Mr. and Mrs. Baldwin also raised and educated an adopted daughter, who goes by the name of Nettie B. Baldwin. During the late war, Mr. Baldwin was in the 100 day service, in the One Hundred and Thirty-fifth Regiment Ohio Volunteer Infantry, and was in several skirmishes. He lived for six years in Ridgeway, and built the first house in the place, but since then has resided on his farm. He and his wife are members of the Methodist Church. He has filled the offices of Assessor and Trustee of Hale Township for three years each.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nObit: Uriah Baldwin, whose serious illness was reported up to press time last Wednesday, yielded to that inevitable that evening (2/8/1905). By his death, Hale township and Hardin County lose one of their foremost pioneers. He was a man who came here before his teens and \"has truly grown up with the\n\ncounty\". History credits him with being the builder of the first house in Ridgeway. That house stood where the James Eaton residence now stands, on the west side of Main St. Mr. Baldwin and his family lived there for six years and then purchased a farm of 122 acres, two miles west of Mt. Victory. In later years he erected a fine brick residence on the farm on which he resided for 64 years. At times he added to his estate and lived to become one of the wealthiest farmers of the country. He was the son of Daniel\n\nand Hannah (Williams) Baldwin and was born in Champaign Co. 5/30/1824. In 1935, he moved with his parents to Hale Township, Hardin Co., where he resided until his death. He was united in marriage to Hannah L. SNODDY 9/5/1848. His wife died 1/13/1902. They had several children: Abner, Lena, Parker, Inez, George, Clark, Joan, Nettie, Daniel, Blanche, Beulah. Mr. Baldwin served in the Civil War ( 135th O.V.I.). He was a charter member of the Methodist Episcopal church. He will be buried in Hale Cemetery.\n\n(Obit provided by Jan Smith and Marvin D.

(SAMUEL4, JOHN3, SAMUEL2, UNKNOWN1) was born Aug 08, 1843 in Monroe Co, IN, and died Apr 03, 1922 in Coles Co, IL. He married (1) MARGARET LURETTA PAYNE Nov 05, 1865 in Monroe Co, IN.

He married (2) CATHERINE BOWER Feb 02, 1881 in Monroe Co, IN.\n\nNotes for JAMES MADISON SNODDY, SR.:\n\n(Information from Randi Richardson = gftl@bluemarble.net).\n\nBy the time of James' second marriage to Catherine Bower, he was caring for his elderly father, Samuel. Several civil suits that were brought to court by Samuel against James and, later, by Catherine against Samuel's estate, suggest that this living arrangement was not without problems. Catherine sued for divorce in 1894. A few years later, in 1896, a suit was brought against John Francis Snoddy so he and two of his brothers, Daniel and Charles, moved to Illinois. James, Jr. eventually ended up in Bloomfield, Indiana. The divorce waas never finalized, but James was living alone at the time the census was taken in 1900. In 1909, James applied for a military pension as a veteran of the Civil War. The pension was denied in 1910 because the information that James provided about his military experience could not be confirmed, and following the denial, James moved to Illinois to join his sons. He died there on March 5, 1922. His body was returned to Bloomington, Indiana, and buried in the Shields Cemetery beside his wife and three of his sons.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJAMES MADISON SNODDY was born in Monroe County, Indiana, on August 8, 1844. He was the youngest of several children born to Samuel and Jane (Shields) Snoddy, and he spent the majority of his life living in the Snoddy Schoolhouse District on what is now known as Snoddy Road.\n\nOn November 5, 1865, James married Margaret L. Payne. Together they had seven children: Samuel, 1866; John Francis, 1868; James Madison, 1870; Daniel W., 1871; Charles Robert, 1873; Sarah A., 1876; and Cora I., 1878.\n\nThe two youngest children, Sarah and Cora, died within a year or two of their birth, in 1877 and 1880, respectively. Margaret also died in 1880. Her cause of death was consumption.\n\nRaising five young boys was no easy job. Consequently, James married again just a few months later in 1881. His new bride was Catherine Bower, the widow of Dominic Bower.\n\nBy the time of his second marriage, James was already caring for Samuel, his elderly father. Several civil suits that were brought to court by Samuel against James and, later, by Catherine against Samuel's estate, suggest that this living arrangement was not without problems.\n\nSamuel, James' oldest son, died in 1890. Catherine in 1895. By 1896 three of the boys, John Francis, Daniel and Charles were living in Illinois. James, Jr. eventually ended up in Bloomfield, Indiana. At the time the census was taken in 1900, James was living alone.\n\nIn 1909 James applied for a military pension as a veteran of the Civil War. That pension was denied in 1910 because the information that James provided about his military experience could not be confirmed. And, following the denial, James moved to Illinois to join his sons.\n\nHe died there on March 5, 1922.
