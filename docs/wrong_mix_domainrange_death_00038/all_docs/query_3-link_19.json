        "text": "(1893–1971). American motion-picture comedian Harold Lloyd portrayed one of the most popular personalities of the silent-movie era and was the highest paid star of the 1920s. Appearing in more than 200 films in the 1910s and 1920s, Lloyd excelled at the visual humor of silent films, though he made many successful films after the coming of talkies.\n\nHarold Clayton Lloyd was born in Burchard, Nebraska, on April 20, 1893. The son of an itinerant commercial photographer, Lloyd finally settled in San Diego, California, where in 1913 he started playing minor parts in one-reel comedies. He mastered the art of the comic chase in the short time he was a member of Mack Sennett’s Keystone comedy troupe. In 1915 Lloyd joined a new acting company formed by Hal Roach, a former actor who had turned producer. During this period he experimented with a comic character, the bewhiskered Willie Work. The most consistently successful of his early films, however, were those of the Lonesome Luke series. Beginning with Just Nuts (1915), Luke quickly became a popular U.S. screen character.\n\nBy 1918 the figure of the ordinary white-faced man in round glasses had replaced Luke as Lloyd’s screen trademark. He developed his humor from plot and situation and was the first comedian to use physical danger as a source of laughter. Lloyd performed his own stunts and was known as the screen’s most daring comedian. In Safety Last! (1923), an outstanding success, he hung from the hands of a clock several stories above a city street. In Girl Shy (1924) he took a thrilling ride atop a runaway streetcar. In The Freshman (1925), one of the most successful of all silent pictures, he stood in for the football tackling dummy.\n\nLloyd’s peak of popularity was reached during the period of silent films, when emphasis was on visual rather than verbal humor, though he made many films after the coming of sound. His last was Mad Wednesday (1947). He was honored with a special Academy Award in 1952 for his contribution to motion-picture comedy. In 1962 Lloyd released Harold Lloyd’s World of Comedy, a compilation of scenes from his old movies, and Harold Lloyd’s Funny Side of Life. The reception given to both demonstrated the timelessness of his silent comedy. Lloyd died on March 8, 1971, in Los Angeles, California."
