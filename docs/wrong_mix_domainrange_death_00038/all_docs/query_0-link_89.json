        "text": "Carl Alexander\n\nThe funeral of George Alexander's little boy was held at Palestine on Tuesday at 12 o'clock and the interment in the cemetery at that place. Quite a sad accident which caused death happened to the 6-year-old boy of George Alexander Friday afternoon. The little fellow was at his father's saw-mill when one of the teamsters drove up with a load of logs and after unloading the boy thought he would ride up to the house which is only a short distance from the mill. In some way the boy fell off the wagon and one wheel passed lengthwise over the body, injuring the spine. Only a day or two previous the boy run a rusty nail in his foot and the injury received from falling from the wagon together caused lockjaw, from which he died at 2 o'clock Sunday morning. Mr. and Mrs. Alexander have the sincere sympathy of the entire community.\n\nWarsaw Daily Times, Kosciusko County, Indiana; 4 Jun 1901\n\nContributed by Scott Bowmar; Transcribed by Mark Barnhart\n\nVerne Allman\n\nCRUSHED BETWEEN TWO ENGINES. Brakeman Verne Allman Instantly Killed in Collision in Garrett Yards.\n\nOn Wednesday evening of last week, about 7:25 o'clock, Verne Allman, the twenty-year-old son of N. R. Allman, a prominent lumber dealer and contractor of this city, was instantly killed in a rear-on collision of the yard engine and \"pusher,\" both of which were being run backward. Engineer Howe and Brakeman Clarence Peck were returning from Avilla with the 2001, having pushed a west-bound freight up the grade, and met the yard engine, in charge of Conductor Ed. Turney, Switchman Allman and Engineer Moughler, on the east-bound main track near the coal chutes in the west part of the yards. Messrs. Turney and Allman were standing on the foot board of the yard engine. The former saw the impending danger when the 2001 was only about three feet away and cannot tell how he managed to escape. It is evident his companion never knew what struck him. Neither engine was running over five or six miles an hour, escaping steam from several other engines standing on adjacent tracks completely enveloping them. Engineer Howe supposed he had struck a car, as after the locomotives came together, they backed apart a few feet. Messrs. Howe, Moughler and the others hurried to the point of collision where they found the unfortunate young victim still in death between the two locomotives. He was badly crushed across the thighs and lower extremities and had sustained a fracture of the skull. The remains were at once taken to Tonnesen's undertaking rooms to be prepared for burial. Engineer Howe had used the customary precautions upon entering the yards with the \"pusher,\" telephoning from west end for instructions as to which track, he should come down. Not content with this he had brought the 2001 to a very slow speed, because of the darkness caused by the steam, and Fireman Gould had just started ringing the bell. The yard engine was also proceeding slowly, the crew having no knowledge that the \"pusher\" would be on the east-bound main, and thinking only that they must keep clear of No. 6, due some few minutes later. Conductor Turney at once looked after the safety of the passenger train, then laid down his lantern to take it up no more in railroad work. It has only been about a year since Ellery Pressler, a flagman of his crew, met death in his presence in the yards. Switchman Frank Neubauer might have shared the same fate, only that he had been left in charge of the dining car. Verne Allman was aged twenty years, eight months and nine days. Last winter he worked for the B. & O. as brakeman, but during the summer months was in the employ of his father at the latter's mill. On December 8 he again entered the service of the company and after a couple weeks on the road began working in the yards. He was very popular among his fellow employes and most obedient to parents and superiors in his work. He is survived by father, step-mother, two brothers and two sisters. Funeral services were conducted by Rev. J. A. Patterson from the M. E. church Friday afternoon at 2 o'clock and interment made at cemetery North.\n\nGarrett Clipper, DeKalb County, Indiana; 26 Jan 1905\n\nContributed by Scott Bowmar; Transcribed by Mark Barnhart\n\nMrs. Martha M.
