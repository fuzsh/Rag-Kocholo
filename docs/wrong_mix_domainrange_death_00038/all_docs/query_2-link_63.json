        "text": "Harold L. Way passed away peacefully on May 18, 2022 at Calvary Hospital in Bronx, New York. He was born on February 28, 1941 in Harlem, New York to Nellie (Doswell) Way and Claude Way. Harold was the third of five children. Barry, Claude, Fanny, and Norma pre-deceased him.\n\nAfter his honorable discharge with the rank of corporal from the United States Marine Corps in 1967, he studied at the New York Institute of Technology from which he earned a B.S. degree in 1977. His public service continued with twenty years in the New York Police Department; he retired from the 43rd Precinct in 1989.\n\nAs an avid lover of jazz, he had an extensive jazz collection which included his favorite artists from the icons, Miles, Dizzy, Trane, and Bird to future jazz greats. For many years, Harold was an accomplished marathoner and used his runs to discover images for his other passion, photography. Harold was a resident of Skyview Riverdale for over 50 years.\n\nHarold Way is survived by his fiancée, Ann Dukette; his godson Michael Zheng; his niece Pamela Way; and many more cousins, nieces, and nephews; and friends in the NYPD and the Skyview communities.\n\nA memorial service will be held on Wednesday, June 1, 2022, at Riverdale-on-Hudson Funeral Home, 6110 Riverdale Avenue, Riverdale, New York, from 4:00 pm until 7:00 pm. Private interment will take place at a later date in Calverton National Cemetery, Wading River, New York. In lieu of flowers, please consider donating in Harold’s name to wbgo.org, his favorite jazz station in the New York metropolitan area."
