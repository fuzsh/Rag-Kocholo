Know about the iconic actor who founded the Oscar Awards.\n\nThe 2024 Oscar Awards will be held on Sunday, March 10, at the Dolby Theatre at Ovation Hollywood. These awards are given to celebrate all aspects of a film’s production, including crafts that tend to get less media attention. While celebrating films, it is natural to remember actor, comedian, and stunt artist, Harold Lloyd played, who played an important role in founding the Academy Awards. During the time of all-time greats like Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, Lloyd was one of the most popular comedy stars of the 'silent era' of Hollywood. It was a critical period in the development of the film industry that proved that the medium was both commercially viable and artistically rewarding and led to the emergence of great cinema within the 1920s.\n\n#Budget 2024 with ET\n\nBudget Highlights: Your 2-minute guide\n\nTax tweaks, jobs & more: All that FM announced in Budget\n\nWhat's cheaper and what's costlier?
