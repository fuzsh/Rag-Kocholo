He died of old age, without any well - defined malady whatever. His strength has been waning for years past, but became suddenly exhausted a few weeks ago while at work in his office. He was taken home in a carriage and went to bed, never to rise again. He grew weaker and weaker until this morning, when the end came.\n\nJudge Van Buren was born in Kinderhook, Columbia County, N. Y., November 3, 1803. His father, Barnet Van Buren, was a politician of considerable note, who, some years later, represented his county in the New - York Assembly. His son, Evert, after receiving a common school education, entered a law office in Kinderhook and in the early part of 1827 was admitted to the New - York State bar. About the same time he married Miss Caroline Smith, daughter of Gen. Melancthon Smith, in Ghent, a town adjoining Kinderhook. In 1828 he removed to Penn Yan, and eight years later to Buffalo. While in the latter city he distinguished himself as counsel for the defense in the famous Rathburn forgery case. Mr. Van Buren had already made for himself a political reputation, and in 1830 had lost the nomination for State Senator from the Seventh District to William H. Seward by a majority of only one vote. He supported Martin Van Buren for the Presidency in 1836 as well as in 1840. In 1844 he stumped New - York State in the interest of James K. Polk. In 1848 he left Buffalo and returned to his former home in Penn Yan, which he left again for Chicago in April, 1856. In 1862 he was elected Judge of the Recorder's Court, the functions of which office he discharged faithfully for one term. At the breaking out of the Rebellion he was known as a strong War Democrat and supporter of Douglas. After retiring from the bench Judge Van Buren continued to practice till some seven weeks ago, when his many years and overwork compelled him to take to his bed. He has a wife and five children - James Van Buren and Augustus Van Buren of this city, Dr. Evert Van Buren of Nebraska, and Barnet and Frederick Van Buren, farmers in Champaign County, IL.

Funeral today at 11 a.m. at the family residence.\n\nThe subject of this notice was the only son of John Whitney, and was born in Fulton county, in this state, June 10, 1851. The family left the farm and came to Henry in the spring of 1859, and after residing in the city several years, removed to their farm adjoining the corporation, where they have since resided. Asa remained at home, working the farm with his father until about the time he was 21, when (March 18, 1872) he secured a situation the store of Pool & Jones, and remained with that firm until January 20, 1875, when being offered a situation in one of the departments of the establishment of Field, Leiter & Co., Chicago, accepted it and remained with that firm until his death which occurred on the 30th ultimo. The sickness which culminated in his death was of about three weeks duration, commencing in a bilious attack, soon merging into typhoid pneumonia; and although he had the attendance of three of Chicago's skillful physicians, and the care which only an anxious mother and sister know how to bestow, besides numerous friends untiring in their attention and anxiety for his recovery; all were baffled, and death secured him as its victim.\n\nA few hours before his death, realizing that his end was near, he called his mother, sister and brother-in-law (J. L. Saxton) to his bedside, and with a happy smile, brightening up his face, kissed them good bye, and then naming his many relatives in Henry by name, sent to each one the same message of remembrance and love. Then after bidding the other faithful attendants and friends farewell, and expressing his willingness to die, and his hope of entering a better world, he asked that his favorite hymn be sung: \"Nearer My God to Thee, Nearer to Thee.\" himself joining in the singing. One who was present speaks of it as the most affecting scene he ever witnessed.\n\nHis body was incased in a beautiful casket and brought home to the family residence, from whence, on January 1st, it was taken to our cemetery, and laid beside his little sister Nellie, who had preceded him some eight years to the \"Home of pure delight, Where saints immortal reign.\" The remains were accompanied home by a former roommate (Mr. Smith), himself also a clerk in the employ of Field, Leiter & Co., and the esteem in which the deceased was held by his employers is shown by their paying the expenses of this representative of their house, whilst on the sad errand of burying his friend and their faithful clerk. ..........

When he was one year old, the family removed to Pittsfield, where he attended school, somewhat irregularly, till twelve years old, when he went to live with an uncle in Chesterfield, remaining there for four years, working on his uncle's farm in the summer and attending school in the winter months. In February, 1843, he engaged himself to a farmer in Suffield, Conn., by whom he was released at \"Thanksgiving\" time, and entered the Academy in that place, defraying his expenses, as before, by manual labor. At the age of eighteen, he obtained the position of teacher in one of the public schools in Suffield, and met with such success as to awaken the desire to fit himself for teaching as a profession. In the spring of 1845, he accordingly entered the Academy at Easthampton, where he remained till the following November (with occasional intervals of farm work), when he assumed the charge of a school in West Suffield, which, though it had borne an evil reputation, was successfully administered by him. Here he formed the design of going to college, and returned to Easthampton Academy, where, and at Andover, he completed his preparatory studies. During his freshman year, he taught school in the town of Harvard; in the sophomore and junior years, at Dedham; and in the senior year, at Dennis. The year after graduating he was elected professor of mathematics in the Newton University, at Baltimore. He received the degree of Master of Arts in 1854, and entered the Dane Law School in the same year. In the autumn of the same year he went to Chicago and began the practice of law, \"without money and without friends,\" to use his own words; having, however, before his death, obtained a reasonable share of both.\n\nHe married, 1 January, 1857, Mary R., daughter of Clarke Partridge, of Medway, Mass., and leaves five children: the oldest and youngest sons; the others, daughters.\n\nHe died 26 March, 1872, at his residence in Winnetka, a small town some fifteen miles north of Chicago, of malignant jaundice, after an illness of a few days, leaving behind him an enviable reputation as a lawyer and as a man.

He subsequently suffered from two attacks of cholera, which aided in weakening a naturally strong constitution.\n\nOn the accession of General Taylor to the Presidential chair, Mr. W. was appointed Post-master in this city, which station he held for a considerable length of time. He was a facile and pungent writer, and an ardent politician. He made a great many warm friends, and of course had some enemies, as all men of his temperament will have. All however will be regret his untimely death.\n\nHe leaves in this city, three brothers; his associate editor, Mr. O. L. Wilson, the present sheriff of our county; Mr. J. L. Wilson and Mr. Henry L.
