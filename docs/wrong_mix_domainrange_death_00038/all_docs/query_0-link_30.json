        "text": "The Arcade Building at 629 Kiheka Avenue where James Youngdeer's film office was located in Pawhuska, Oklahoma. The top header image is from James Youngdeer's 1910, White Fawn's Devotion.\n\nReturn to Table of Contents for films\n\nSo Many News Clips\n\nGoing through news articles concerning the Osage, I came across one on Chief Baconrind appearing in a 1925 movie that was filmed in Osage County, Oklahoma, The Unknown Man. Its leading actor was a William Fitch, married to Rosa Logan, Osage daughter of John Logan and Mary Corndropper. She had a part in the film as well. My attention was partly drawn to this because Baconrind's daughter, Julia, had as a first husband (married 1922) Andrew Brave, and I was aware his sibling, Louis, had been a consultant on the movie Cimarron in 1931. Louis had moved, in 1928, to Hollywood, with his wife Marie Tessie \"Hummingbird\" Mobley, who was a mixed-Chickasaw opera singer and actress. She used her Indian name as her stage name, Lou-Scha-enya, appearing in Eddie Cantor's Whoopee in 1930.\n\nLos Angeles Evening Express, 19 June 1930\n\nChief Bacon Rind, 80 years-old Osage Indian, and 50 of bis tribesmen will soon be on their way to Hollywood to appear In Radio Pictures' 'Cimarron.' The Indians were signed by Doran Cox, assistant director, representing RKO. who returned from Oklahoma, where he has been filming prairie scenes for the forthcoming production. Cox Cox and Louis Brave, a full-blooded Oeagc, made a thorough search of libraries and family albums In the locale of the Edna Ferber story, seeking authentic data on costumes, types, and practices of the early Indian Territory days. Chief Bacon Rind will play the part of Big Elk In the Richard Dlx starring vehicle.\n\nTessie's sister, Marie, married a Muchmore, resided in Dallas, and captured famed footage of President Jack Kennedy's assassination. Thought I'd drop that in there.\n\nBut to get back to the movies. I knew about Cimarron. What was The Unknown Man? This seemed worth exploring, a movie made in 1925 that purportedly used talent from Osage County, Oklahoma and gave the general citizenry ample opportunity to appear in crowd scenes. I was surprised to find no information on it at IMDB.\n\nBelow is a collective drop of news articles on not only The Unknown Man, but another movie that was staged in Osage County, Oklahoma subsequently, and then yet another that was soon thereafter done on The Osage Reign of Terror. The director was an individual born James Young Johnson, who later went by the name of James Young Deer, then James Gordon Youngdeer, famed as the \"first documented film director of Native American ancestry\". By at least 1910 he was giving himself as full Winnebago and went to Carlisle Indian School (see the below news item from 1910 July 7). But when people poked at his story after his death they found lots of holes. Historians determined to find out who he was. To make a long and complex story short, what he was hiding was that his family was mixed Indian and African-American, his father's paternal side descending from the Nanticoke, eventually recognized by the state as a \"special class\" of people in 1881, only 31 individuals at first, including one of James' great-uncles, then recognized by the state in 1922 as an official tribe. His father's maternal line descended from a family listed in \"Free African Americans of Maryland and Delaware from the Colonial Period to 1810\". Always, in documents, his various family lines were listed as Black or Mulatto until 1880 when James Young Johnson was four years of age and they were given as white. James' father died in 1878, his mother in 1890, and he was in the service by 1898. I don't find him on the census in 1900, but in 1906 James married Lillian St. Cyr, a Winnebago whose stage name was Red Wing, and would soon become a star. He was James Younger Johnson, and they both gave themselves as Black, though Lillian St. Cyr was Winnebago.\n\nJames transitioned to being only Native American, dissociating himself from his past life, and from then on used the name James Young Deer (Youngdeer), his wife using it as well.\n\nIt was a complex situation. Historians wonder if James ever knew he was descended from Nanticoke Indians as his father died when he was a child, but I'm going to assume that he did. If you examine the Nanticoke families, as it often is with such groups, they were tight, the families married into one another. I find his grandfather, Major Clark Johnson, lived until 1891, his aunt Frances \"Fanny\" Johnson Booth lived until 1901, and his great-uncle Whittington Johnson lived until 1896. The three Johnsons who were members of the Nanticoke association, as well as the three Clarks were family, the Clarks through his great-grandmother Mary Clark, who had married Robert Johnson, and were parents of Whittington Johnson and Major Clarke Johnson. Virtually everyone on the initial list of 31 individuals would be relations in some way. But being recognized as descended from the Nanticoke wasn't going to cut it. Just as when James began filming Indian-themed movies in the east, the public was dissatisfied with eastern shrubbery and trees, wanting their Indians to be from across the Mississippi. James Young Johnson dealt with that complex Nanticoke and African-American heritage by fabricating a full Winnebago indian history, transferring his birth from Washington D.C. to Dakota City, Nebraska, and acquiring a father named \"Green Rainbow\". This would open doors of opportunity to him, as he set out to make Indian-themed movies, that probably wouldn't have been available to him as a mixed-blood Nanticoke, a people not recognized until 1881 and often viewed as mulatto. James' mother, Emma Young, was mulatto, not Nanticoke. His grandmother on his father's side, Lydia Ann LeCount, was mulatto, not Nanttcoke. Though there was considerable racism against Native Americans, it wasn't the same type of racism experienced by African Americans.\n\nLillian St. Cyr, first appearing in a film called \"The White Squaw\" in 1908, is sometimes mistakenly credited as the first indigenous film actress--and does it really matter who is first or second. She would be in many films by a number of different directors, including D. W. Griffith, but the 2nd film she was in was directed by her husband, James Young Deer, who made a career out of filming Indian-themed westerns that often featured his wife. The majority of these films were produced 1911 to 1914, the years for which he was head of production for Pathe Freres West Coast Studio, but the films he did in 1914 were in the U.K., to where he'd moved. Not by his own volition. He'd gotten into trouble, which I won't get into here, but having just escaped landing in prison for statutory rape and other allegations, he went to the U.K. to reinvent himself as a director of thrillers.\n\nJames Y. Johnson \"Youngdeer\" with wife Lillian St. Cyr, from Fred J. Balshofer's 1910 film \"Young Deer's Return.\"\n\nWinnebago Indians are Registered at Nadeau -- 1910, July 7, Los Angeles Herald -- Mr. and Mrs. James Young Deer in news as registering at the Nadeau, Young Deer a Winnebago who graduated Carlisle University.\n\nPledges Word, Indian to Return -- 1914, April 3, Los Angeles Times -- In trouble for statutory rape, James flees, and writes to the judge, from \"many thousands of miles away from you\"that he has lost his studio, everything, but that he promises to return.\n\nYoungdeer Case Dismissed -- 1914, Nov 25, Los Angeles Evening Express -- Prosecution witnesses and Carol Mason didn't appear. The case is dismissed.\n\nNow She's Gone. And Youngdeer Freed -- 1914, Dec 4, Los Angeles Times -- Prosecution witness Marie Wilkerson didn't appear and the case is dismissed.\n\nThen there's a disruption of activity, he and Lillian had already separated or were separated during this time, and in 1920 two more films are directed by him in the U.K. and then one in 1924. After having directed 32 films between 1909 and 1915, then 2 films in 1920, his IMDB career ends with the U.K. film, \"The Lieutenant Darin RN and the Water Rats\", released in 1924.\n\nThe book Starring Red Wing! The Incredible Career of Lilian M. St. Cyr, the First Native American Film Star by Linda M. Waggoner, does a great job of covering the early years of the marriage of Lillian St. Cyr and James, and one should refer to it for information on Lillian's life and those early years with James.\n\nFor more on the uncovering of James' identity see Angela Aleiss' \"Who Was the Real James Young Deer? The Mysterious Identity of the PathÃ¨ Producer Finally Comes to Light\".\n\nMy concern is with the years 1920 to 1926, filling in a gap of knowledge with James concerning his Oklahoma years. And that's where the news items I've gathered come in.\n\nBefore those years in Oklahoma, I need to begin with the movie, Watuska, as I believe we first see with this his association with a woman I will later be able to identify as Lillian Beatrice King.\n\nThe film Watuska, a Creek \"Princess\",\n\nand a marriage to Anomine Page in 1920\n\nThe Henne building in LA, where the office was for Youngdeer Productions/Film Corporation\n\nPhoto circa 1915, from Sons of the Revolution in the State of California web site\n\nIf you refer to the below articles, you'll see that on 5 March 5 1920 James Youngdeer announced the formation of Youngdeer Productions, a Los Angeles film company, and that it would be filming a movie called Watuska about \"a real Indian princess.\" On March 19, an article revealed that Watuska was the granddaughter of \"one of the most notable chiefs that ever ruled over the Creek Indian nation.\" Though in the header she is given as \"Princess Watuska\", the body of the articles off somewhat from the description of her as a \"princess\", clarifying that, \"The princess is a complimentary reminder of the old royal line.\" Who was this new American Indian actress that James was promoting? He doesn't say. On the 27th a Raymond Jareski was signed to play the half-breed \"Wolf\"\n\nThe \"Camera\" publication stated Cecil de Freitas was currently photographing the Watuska, a seven reel feature. Production started on 4 April, but by April 12 there are already problems. An article appears in which Youngdeer's studio is suggested to be opportunistically extracting money from individuals with promises of possible work. On May 13th le loses a suit filed against him for not having paid two assistant directors for nine weeks of work, individuals he had simply dropped.\n\nOne of those individuals who was sued as part of Youngdeer Film Corporation was an Anemone Page. James Y Deer on 18 April 1920 in Los Angeles, California is recorded as having married Anomine Page. That's a wife I don't think has been recorded and I've no clue who she is.\n\nOne of the assistant directors who filed suit and won was a John T. Loomis, who I find on the 1920 census as an actor employed by Mercury, as was also his wife, Dorothy.\n\nBy June 5, James was running from the law, sought by officers for selling stock certificates in a film producing venture without a permit. According to the officers, he and an \"Indian woman known as 'Red Wing' were last said to have been headed toward a government reservation in Oklahoma.\"\n\nYoungdeer Company Off to Bear Lake -- 1920 March 6, Los Angeles Evening Express -- Announcement of formation of Youngdeer Productions, and the filming of Watuska, a feature, at Bear Lake.\n\nPrincess Watuska, of American Royal Birth, is Film Star -- 1920 March 19, Los Angeles Evening Express -- Announcement of filming, Watuska, starring a \"princess\" of the Creek Indian Nation. Picture.\n\nRaymond Jareski Signs with Youngdeer Company -- 1920 March 27, Los Angeles Evening Express -- Will play Wolf in Watuska.\n\nYoungdeer Productions Begin -- 1920 April 4, The Tacoma Daily Ledger (Tacoma, Washington) -- J. P. Willis, Emily Dow and Youngdeer are officers of Youngdeer Productions which as begun work on Watuska.\n\nHelp Wanted - Male and Female -- 1920 April 9, the Pasadena Post (California) -- Youngdeer Productions advertises for talent for Watuska. Room 123 Henne Building, Los Angeles.\n\nFailed to Get Thriller -- 1920 April 10, Los Angeles Evening Express -- News report on incident of runaway horses while filming near Griffith Park for Watuska.\n\n$150 Weekly Salary, Bait to Ambitious -- 1920 April 12, Los Angeles Record -- Article on potential hires required to pay Youngdeer's company $50. S. F. Rogers is given as the director of the company. He is the Stanley F. Rogers living in LA in the 1920 census, with wife Edna, who gives himself as an actor in vaudville, his wife a musician in vaudville..\n\nJudgment Against Youngdeer Recorded -- 1920 May 13, Los Angeles Evening Express -- John T. Loomis and C. W. McKnight sue for payment as assistant directors, winning against Youngdeer Productions, Anemone Paige and Walter B. Bourge. Complaints also made my young women in Youngdeer's film acting school who had been promised work.\n\nMovie Impresario is Sought for Selling Stock Minus Permit -- 1920 June 5, Los Angeles Evening Express -- As title states. Believed to be with Red Wing \"headed toward a government reservation in Oklahoma\".\n\nStrangers -- 1921 June 10, The Central New Jersey Home News -- \"Jass [sic] Youngdeer, a Full Blood American Indian\", presents his Strangers at the Strand.\n\nStrangers -- 1921 March 11, The Central New Jersey Home News -- \"Chief Youngdeer\", presents his Strangers at the Strand.\n\nThe Stranger, advertised as Strangers played in Brooklyn. And in Antwerp, France, Royal Zoologie having formed the respected Royal-Zoologie theater, when forced to shut down its animal exhibits, from the 25th of February through the 2nd of March, Cine Zoologie featured by the Royal-Zoologie in Antwerp on a double bill with The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.\n\nThe Strangers at Cine Zoologie\n\nYoungdeer Film Company Presents \"The Stranger\"\n\nLillian Beatrice A. King aka Leila King\n\nJame Y Deer marriage to Anomine Page\n\nThat marriage to \"Anemone Paige\" kind of threw me for a loop as I'd already found another unknown marriage for James and thought I had things worked out concerning his running off to Oklahoma with, supposedly, Red Wing. Was it Red Wing, Lillian Youngdeer? Or was it someone else? Perhaps another Lillian Youngdeer?\n\nPrincess Watuska\n\nIn 1924, a movie was released in the U.K. for which James Young Deer shared director credit with Edward Gordon and Percy Moran, Lieutenant Daring RN and the Water Rats. One of the women featured in it was Leila King as Lola. IMDB had no information on her, and I thought it a little too coincidental that James Youngdeer would then show up in Oklahoma in 1924 with a woman named Lillian A. King, and that she would star in The Unknown Man and does other work on the film, such as continuity. She then stars in the 1925 What a Woman Can Do and the 1926 Tragedies of the Osage Hills. Might Leila King be Lillian A. King?\n\nI started researching her and found an Oklahoma Indian Land Allotment Sale document for a woman given as half Creek Indian, Lillian Beatrice King \"now Young Deer\". Then I found an article in which James Youngdeer identified Lillian King as having starred in Lieutenant Daring RN and the Water Rats. So it was the same woman.\n\nLillian Beatrice King as Lillian Beatrice Youngdeer\n\nAnd what about Princess Watuska, the Creek Indian whose grandfather was an important Creek chief? Lillian Beatrice King (1900 - 1956), born in Henryette, Okmulgee, Oklahoma, was the great-granddaughter of Chief William Chillicouthe \"Chilly\" McIntosh, who Wikipedia gives as \"an important figure in the history of the Creek Nation. Born in Georgia to William McIntosh, chief of the Lower Creeks and his wife Eliza, he was the half-brother of D. N. McIntosh, and the nephew of Roley McIntosh, another Creek Chief.\" Chilly was important because, with his father, he signed a treaty which sold Creek-claimed land in Georgia, an act that was against a Creek law, presuming to act for the entire Creek Nation. This was punishable by death, and Chief William McIntosh was killed and his house burned. Chilly escaped, taking refuge with the Cherokee, then in 1828 led the Lower Creeks, who would be known as the McIntosh faction, to their new home in the west.\n\nIt appears she was first married to Ray Whitetree, a Senaca Indian, by 1918, and military records reveal they are no longer married by 1919. In the January of 1920 census she is divorced and living with her family in Okmulgee, Oklahoma, working as a bookkeeper in a lawyer's office.\n\nDid she meet up with Youngdeer in Oklahoma or California? Jesse P. Wills had been one of the officers of Youngdeer Productions in Los Angeles, and one has to wonder how he came to be in California when he was working as a mail carrier in Verdigris, Rogers, Oklahoma in 1920. Why he was working as a mail carrier when he was a lawyer, I don't know. But how did he, too, make his way to Los Angeles in 1920, at the same time as Lillian King? How did they both meet James Youngdeer?\n\nWhen I first learned James had married Lillian King (well, as best as he could marry anyone else as he and Lillian St. Cyr never officially divorced), I believed they probably married around 1920 and, as another Lillian Youngdeer,she would have been the one headed with James to a reservation in Oklahoma, and not Red Wing.\n\nBut what about Anemone Paige (Anomine Page)? I couldn't find anything at all on Anomine Page other than her father was William. Though William Paige was given on the marriage license, I was inclined to wonder if this could be Lillian Beatrice King, whose father was named William. The certificate was in error with James giving his father as James, rather than George (I could swear I've seen this error in another document though I don't right now recall where, I have gone through a lot of documents concerning them), but his mother is correctly given as Emma. I have seen many other cases where parents would be not listed appropriately, it's not that uncommon, but I wondered if there was intentional obfuscation, such as with James becoming \"James Y Deer\". It's a name that's much the same as James Youngdeer but it could slip through the cracks as well and mean not being able to track a person's history.\n\nLillian, I knew, had married subsequently to an Earl Pearson, but I had been unable to find them in the census before 1950. Then I finally located them in the 1940 census, in Galveston, Texas. Earl's wife was given as Anemone Pearson, which confirms Lillian Beatrice King, aka Lillian A. King, as Anemone Page.\n\nEarle Rathke Pearson married Mrs. Lillian King Wright in Harris, Texas on 18, Jan, 1935. I don't know who Mr. Wright was.\n\n1924 - Arrowhead Motion Pictures in Pawhuska, Oklahoma and the Filming of The Unknown Man\n\nOsage, Oklahoma newspapers were abuzz with Youngdeer's appearing in Osage, Oklahoma in November of 1924 to film \"The Unknown Man\" under the company name of Arrowhead Motion Pictures. It was to be full feature length film, whereas James Young Deer had made his name with shorts--but no one wanted shorts anymore, they wanted features. The plot concerned \"a beautiful girl [and] the attempts of the villain and his confederates to beat her out of the valuable oil lease\". This was topical, considering the Osage Reign of Terror that was then being investigated, Osage Indians murdered for their headrights. Though some timelines for the Osage Reign of Terror don't show William King Hale becoming a suspect until September of 1925, and they wouldn't be arrested until January 1926, the FBI was already aware of William King Hale and his Burkhart nephews by at least April of 1924.I\n\nA description of the film's story appears to give the wronged woman in the story as white, but at least in a news article of 22 October, 1924, in the Pawhuska Daily Journal, the film's star was stated to be of \"Indian blood\"--and she was, indeed, mixed-Creek, though this isn't stated.\n\nPawhuska Daily Journal, 22 October 1924\n\nLillian A. King Versatile Woman\n\nHas Played Lead Parts and is Scenarist and Continuity Writer of Ability\n\nMiss Lillian A. King, with the Arrow Head Film Company of this city, is an Oklahoma product, hailing from Henryetta. She is of Indian blood and has had a varied career on the screen where she has played lead parts in a number of large productions. She is a woman of fine personality and of ability and of a type of beauty that has enabled her to play a most varied number of screen parts. She has appeared in numerous screen dramas in England and in this country but for the past few years has specialized in scenario work and continuity writing in which she has grown most proficient.\n\nAmong screen successes in which Miss King appeared in England are \"Belle of the Gambling Den,\" put out by the Master Company, \"Repentance\" by the B and Z company; \"The Man Behind the Scene\" by the British and Colonial; \"Dad's Boy\" by the Mutual, and many others. In Berlin, she was leading lady in a screen success, \"She and the Wax Figures\" staged by the Decla Bioscope. While in Spain, Miss King appeared in an attractive role in a play staged there among surroundings that were suitable to the theme. She has appeared in several successes of the screen in this country. Of a brunette type, she is capable of playing parts of great variation from the dark haired Spanish and Indian characters to the lighter haired Saxon types popular in this country.\n\nThe Arrow Head company has fitted out offices in the Arcade building where operations will be started looking toward the production of a comedy-drama with a local setting and local people within a short time. J. Gordon Youngdeer, manager of the company and who will direct the action, has word from two of the largest companies of the cast indicating that they will be in the market for anything that he will produce in this locality in the way of western plays. He expects to produce about six of the sort between now and the end of the year. He is now casting parts with local people to be used in the first western to be staged.\n\nAssuming she and Youngdeer were already married, there's no indication of this in the article. I'm unable to locate any news or materials on the other films Lillian was stated to have been in other than the 1921 Belle of the Gambling Den, filmed in the U.K., in which she isn't credited on IMDB. You'll notice that her appearance in James' 1924 Lieutenant Daring RN and the Water Rats isn't mentioned, as if she is being distanced from having previously worked with Youngdeer, who is given in this article as J. Gordon Youngdeer.\n\nThe 22 October article is written in a way to show that everyone in Pawhuska was already well-acquainted with the coming filming of The Unknown Man. Guy Marple, who write the story for The Unknown Man, was city editor for The Capital in Pawhuska, later becoming a district court official. The Capital was startet in Jan 30 1904 and the Journal on Dec 10 1904, and combined in 1925 to form the only daily newspaper in Osage County, The Pawhuska Journal-Capital.\n\nYoungdeer had begun advertising for talent in the Pawhuska Daily Journal on the 21st.>\n\nWas this another pay-to-play scheme? And then, if one is guaranteed a role in a film, however small, should we consider a pay-to-play scheme on that order to be a con and that the film is somehow not legitimate? I'm not going to say that Youngdeer hadn't run cons, and we know he had failed to pay workers and had taken money for roles that didn't materialize. But what about if people are willing to pay to be in a film? If a director goes to a town and presents them an opportunity, at their cost, to be in a film that showcases their area? Is that exploitation? Does it immediately invalidate the film?\n\nBut Youngdeer, at least in the papers, was out to give the impression that he wanted to build a studio in Oklahoma, preferably in Pawhuska, that would place the midwest on the map as a film center, so that movie-making didn't just belong, in America, to Los Angeles and New York.\n\nWhatever gave Youngdeer the idea to locate in Pawhuska, he already knew people there. Lillian having been officially introduced to the public on the 24th, on the 26th of October an article appeared in which it was stated that Youngdeer was surprised to meet up with, in Pawhuska, J. P. Willis, a lawyer who had previously worked with him, president of Youngdeer Productions in Los Angeles. J. P. was stated to be probably relocating in Pawhuska.\n\nJ.P. had been an officer with Youngdeer Productions on the Watuska film, which was shot, but apparently never finished, Youngdeer appearing to have abandoned filming prior to the news of his leaving because of having run afoul of the law in connection with its production. Jesse Palmer Willis, born in Iowa in 1892, had relocated with his parental family to Rogers, Oklahoma before 1910. By 1922, he had married, in Kay County, Oklahoma, Minnie LeSarge, who hailed from a well-known mixed-Osage family. Her parents were Louis Napoleon LeSarge and Mary Josephine Pappan. Louis LeSarge's parents had been Jean Baptiste LeSarge and Francoise Roy, of Osage and Kaw descent. On the Roy side, Minnie was related to the Revelettes, the Lesserts, the Roys who had been on the Nemaha Mixed-Breed Reservation, and so many other names that had gone on to marry full blood Indians and mixed-blood, and whites. On the Pappan side she had as her great-great grandfather the Kaw chief White Plume, who married a daughter of the Osage Chief Pawhuska (White Hair). She was on the Osage Roll, #1134. Though Willis and Youngdeer are no longer presented as associates, Willis would become involved in a business venture with Franklin Fitch, an area man who was the featured male lead in The Unknown Man. Jesse Willis' father, a hotel proprietor in Claymore, had owned a good deal of real estate there, and Willis fell in line. He and Fitch purchased the entire interest of a ranch/quarter horse farm in Claymore by July of 1925. Willis also purchased the Miller building in Pawhuska, which had been a major sports entertainment venue.\n\nWe can put together some partial credits for The Unknown Man based on news articles:\n\nFranklin Fitch as Kit Karzan\n\nG.

Walter Mosier would have been the son of Eugene Mosier, Osage, and Frances McGraw. Grover German was married to Mary Mosier, a daughter of Eugene Mosier and half-sister of Walter.

Poul was married to Vera Cottingham whose mother was Ida Ross, Osage. Alva Carter was likely the son of George Carter and Minnie Kennedy, who was mixed-Osage, Shelby McGraw may be the son of Alice Grass McIntosh, Cherokee, previously married to Chief James Bigheart.

Youngdeer and German would prefer to have Arrowhead studios in Pawhuska rather than in Tulsa or Bartlesville.\n\n1925 - The Filming of Stranger in the Hills in Osage County, Oklahoma, which becomes\n\nWhat a Woman Can Do\n\nBy January of 1925, before the premiere of The Unknown Man the news was being published that a local film studio was to be incorporated, with James Youngdeer hoping it would be in Pawhuska, and on March 12th it was published that a motion picture company had been formed, a venture that \"should commend itself to people interested in seeing Pawhuska remain a progressive city\". Officers were G. C. Schoenover, Barton Carter and Bill Bryant. Alva Carter, Buck Starr and Fred Whittaker were interested backers.\n\nG. C. Schoenover may have been Grover C. Schoonover. Grover's mother was Cherokee, Annie Mary Muskrat. He was married to Lola Perrier whose father, Louis Napoleon Parrier, was mixed-Osage, and her mother, Ellen Haynie, mixed-Cherokee. Barton Carter was likely the brother of Alva Carter, who had acted in The Unknown Man, sons of George Carter and Minnie Kennedy, who was mixed-Osage, Fred Whittaker was perhaps a barber from Fairfax.\n\nThe filming of a second feature, The Stranger in/from the Hills, was being planned in December of 1924 and begun about March 1924. Whatever the original story was supposed to be, in March it was announced the name had been changed to What a Woman Can Do, to fit a plot concerning young women from the east coming west and learning to be cowgirls, but there were also gypsies somehow involved in the plot. Many locals were again included, but it featured Hollywood talent Helen Holmes, \"Queen of the railroad serials\", who from 1913 to 1926 was in 141 films. Her career was at its end, though she did 12 films in 1925.\n\nWhat credits I can put together are:\n\nHellen Holmes\n\nLillian A. King\n\nStella King (who was a younger sister of Lillian's)\n\nA.R. Ranch owner - Val Vino\n\nSheriff - Bill Bryant\n\nBootlegger villain - Walt Naylor\n\nRanch Foreman (who resigns) - Lloyd Saunders\n\nOfficer - Frank Haste\n\nContinuity by - Lillian A. King\n\nStory by Guy Marple\n\nAfter some delays, the movie. produced by the Red Arrow Film Company, was apparently supposed to premiere June 11-13, Thursday, Friday and Saturday (or did they mean June 18-20), but I find nothing else on it. The next news item I locate, after the June 11th announcement of the premiere, is a July 28th item out of Bartlesville about the Arrowhead Film Company interviewing talent there for a new film, already in production, an office to be opened there with Shirley Shreeves in charge, who was stagemanager for the \"Cutler-Jack\" interest.\n\nDid this film premiere that weekend? What happened? Again, it's not listed on IMDB.\n\nMotion Picture Company Formed, Officers Elected and Work on Next Picture Will Start the Coming Week -- 1925 March 12, Osage Journal -- Officers of the new company are: president, G. C. Schoenover; vice-president, Barton Carter; secretary treasurer, Bill Bryant; members of the company who will be interested in backing the venture are Alva Carter, Buck Starr, Fred Whittaker and James Gordon Youngdeer. A charter will be applied for in the coming week. Anticipates a need for 150 to 200 people in the upcoming production.\n\nStart Work on New Film Soon, Arrowhead Film Company Will Have Extensive Cast fror \"Stranger from the Hills\" -- 1925 March 18, Pawhuska Daily Journal -- Youngdeer has been busy selecting cast for the past two weeks, with fifteen lead parts. Film has been ordered from New York and horses arranged.\n\n2 Bartlesville Men in Moving Pictures -- 1925 April 6, Bartlesville Examiner -- Val Vino and Shirley Shreves play parts in The Stranger from the Hills Val Vino is from Hollywood and Shirley Shreeves is an actor of \"note and experience\". Stella King, \"ingenue of Pawhuska\" will also appear.\n\nFilm Company Hard at Work, Working Today on Scenes to be Shot at Prue Place Near This City -- 1925 April 9, Osage Journal -- Filming at Carter Place near the race track. Stella King is mentioned as ingenue, of Pawhuska. Filming at Prue place. The name of the film changed from \"The Stranger from the Hills\" to \"What Women Can Do\".\n\nFinish FIlm in Coming Ten Days, Bad Weather and Rains Have Delayed Making of Production Considerably -- 1925 April 10, Pawhuska Daily Journal -- Working on \"What a Woman Do\".\n\nMarie Prevost May Appear Here, Popular Movie Star May Be Signed up to Play with Red Arrow Film Co. -- 1925 May 4, Pawhuska Daily Journal -- Prevost is in negotiations for the next film, \"What a Woman Can Do\" having recently completed filming. Prevost was a bathing beauty with the Mack Sennett comedies then went on to leading roles.\n\nShow Local Film The Coming Week, Picture of the Osage Almost Ready for Exhibition After Many Delays -- 1925 June 4, Osage Journal -- The local film produced by Red Arrow Film Company, Inc. will show at the Jackson Theater Thursday through Saturday the coming week. \"What a Woman Can Do\", featuring Helen Holmes, will have six or seven reels. College girls come from the east and become cowgirls under the coaching of Holmes as the foreman of the A.R. Ranch. The second half of the film will likely be made into another picture.\n\nLocal Film to Start Thursday -- 1925 June 11, Osage Journal -- Red Arrow Film Company's \"What a Woman Can Do\" will open for a three-day engagement Thursday at the Jackson Theater. A western production with many comedy touches.\n\nMiss Pawhuska Pays Examiner a Visit -- 1925 June 28, Morning Examiner (Bartlesville, Oklahoma) -- Miss Lorraine Ivers seeks to interview other bathing girls for a new motion picture by Arrowhead Film Company. She was accompanied by Lillian A. King. Scenes at a country club were already shot. Production begins after July 4th. Youngdeer will be opening an office in Bartlesville, in charge of Shirley Shreeves, stage manager for the Cutler-Jack interest.\n\nMr. and Mrs. J. P. Willis are New Owners of New Building Lately Finished on Fifth Street, Willis and Fitch Expect to Move Horse Ranch Here -- 1925 July 23, Pawhuska Daily Journal -- Miller Building on Fifth purchased by J. P. Willis from J. L. and Izora Miller. Known for wrestling and boxing bouns staged in the building. He and Franklin Fitch bought out an interest in the ranch/quarter horse farm from Mr. Blake at Claremore and recently purchased the entire interest.\n\n1926 - Thompson Moving Picture Corporation in Cushing, Oklahoma, and the movie Tragedies of the Osage Hills about The Osage Reign of Terror\n\nThe Thompson Hotel in Cushing, Oklahoma where Thompson Moving Picture Corporation located.\n\nSomething had gone sour, because a studio didn't materialize in Pawhuska or Bartlesville. Instead, one opened in Cushing, Youngdeer having teamed up with local hotel owner Frank L. Thompson, the purpose of this venture seeming to have been solely for the filming of Tragedies of the Osage Hills, which purported to tell the true story of the Osage Reign of Terror, William King Hale and the Burkharts having been arrested in January of 1926. Preliminary hearings had been held in March. It wasn't until June that the trials would begin.\n\nAlso given as a Thompson Film Company production, the only credits I've been able to dig up are:\n\nMiss Lillian A. King as Prairie Flower\n\nJack Rich\n\nWalt Naylor as a federal officer\n\nPatsy Mitchell\n\nKate Spencher as a bootlegger\n\nGene Slaton as a \"member of the notorious gang\"\n\nBob Selfridge\n\nJean Pack\n\nCharles King as Chief of the Outlaws\n\nLittle Bernice Williams\n\nSlim Williams\n\nEddie McClellan\n\nLela Walker\n\nSadie Davis\n\nEddie Ellis\n\nGeorge Somebody [sic]\n\nIt premiered on May 11th, 1926 in Cushing.\n\nAnnouncement of the premiere of Tragedies of the Osage Hills\n\nAd for Tragedies of the Osage Hills\n\nAd for Tragedies of the Osage Hills\n\nWas this film already being planned in 1925, and was perhaps a reason why the title Stranger in the Hills was changed to What a Woman Can Do? The film's production ended on a sour note with Youngdeer suing Thompson, in September of 1926, who he said had taken possession of the reels. Frank Thompson died not long thereafter on 5 January 1927.\n\nIn 1929, Reymond RedCorn published Arthur Henry Lamb's Tragedies of the Osage Hills: As Told by the 'Sage' of the Osage, which had stories on the Osage Reign of Terror, but included many more items besides. Did Lamb draw his title from the Youngdeer-Thompson movie, or had Youngdeer and Thompson gotten wind of this as a title for a prospective book?\n\nWill Open Movie Laboratory Here -- 1926 March 1, Cushing Daily Citizen -- Thompson Moving Picture Corporation opens at the Thompson hotel in Cushing, with James Gordon Youngdeer as vice-president and general manager. Will cater to public seeking motion picture advertisements, and producing some scenarios. Mrs. Youngdeer and Mr. and Mrs. Jack Rich of Los Angeles will assist. Known for the \"Unknown Man\" and considerable work done around Sand Springs.\n\nTragedies of the Osage Hills, Local Production, Given First Showing Here -- 1926 May 11, Cushing Daily Citizen -- 8000 feet of film and hundreds of Indians in a movie depicting \"what is said to be the real facts in the series of alleged murders committed in the Osage country\".\n\nTragedies of the Osage Hills -- 1926 May 11, Cushing Daily Citizen -- American Theater presents \"Tragedies of the Osage Hills\". The most sensational picture of the age.< Based on real facts of the atrocious murders committed in the Osage country. A picture that every citizen of Oklahoma should see. Hundreds of real Indians.\n\nLocal Film Given Last Showing Here -- 1926 May 13 , Cushing Daily Citizen -- \"The Tragedies of the Osage Hills\", filmed in and around Cushing, and company headed by F. L. Thompson, local hotel man, gives its farewell showing at the American Theater. Two prior days attracted large crowds. \"Each evening before the picture is started on the screen, the director 'rehires' his cast, making the selections for each character in the view of the audience...the last stage scene is of the tie of friendship, brought about by the American flag, between the Indians and white men\"\n\n\"Tragedies of Osage Hills\" -- 1926 July 29, the Edmond Sun (Edmond, Oklahoma) -- \"The Tragedies of the Osage Hills\" is an Oklahoma picture of the Osage murders and Hale, the King of the Osages. Playing in Edmond, Oklahoma.\n\n\"Tragedies of Osage Hills\" -- 1926 July 30, the Edmond Booster (Edmond, Oklahoma) -- \"The Tragedies of the Osage Hills\" at the Gem theater in Edmond. Three of the stars to appear in person. Wax figures of Hale and Ramsey.\n\n\"Tragedies of Osage Hills\" Has Its Own\"\" -- 1926 September 17, Stillwater Gazette (Stillwater, Oklahoma) -- Jmes Gordon Younggdeer sues F. L. Thompson, his partner in the \"movie\" project that started January 1926. He seeks to dissolve the partnership. Five prints were made of the film and the defendant has forcibly taken charge of the pictures to the exclusion of the plaintiff.\n\nThe research of others shows that the Great Depression found him living in a boarding house in the Mission District in San Francisco, reinvented as an Indian born in Oklahoma, now a theater instructor. On July 17 1930 he married, in Douglas, Cochise, Arizona, a Scottish immigrant, Helen Gilchrist, who died 6 June 1937 in Los Angeles. The informant was James who gave them as having lived in California 7 years, and that she'd been in the US 12 years. She was buried in an unmarked grave.\n\nI've seen it questioned if this was because the marriage was illegitimate, he and Lillian \"Red Wing\" having never divorced--and I have found that on James' death certificate his wife is listed as L. Margaret, which would be Lillian Margaret St. Cyr. But I've seen a lot of \"illegitimate\" marriages in my time doing genealogy, and I've never seen any one of them buried in unmarked graves because of it. I would instead believe it had only to do with financial constraints.\n\nLillian Margaret was not only listed as James' wife on his death certificate, she was also the informant.\n\nName: James Y Johnson\n\nGender: Male\n\nRace: White\n\nMarital Status: Married\n\nAge: 68\n\nBirth Date: 1 Apr 1878\n\nBirth Place: Wash, D C\n\nResidence Street Address: 250 W 67 St\n\nResidence Place: New York\n\nDeath Date: 6 Apr 1946\n\nHospital: Bellevue Hospital\n\nDeath Place: New York City, Manhattan, New York, USA\n\nCause of Death: Carcinoma of The Stomach, Cachexia\n\nBurial Date: 10 Apr 1946\n\nBurial Place: Long Island National Cemetery\n\nOccupation: Retired Gov'T Pension\n\nFather's Birth Place: Pennsylvania\n\nMother's Birth Place: Wash, D C\n\nFather: George G Johnson\n\nMothe:: Emma Johnson\n\nSpouse: L Margret\n\nInformant: M L Johnson\n\nInformant Gender: Female\n\nInformant Relationship: Wife\n\nExecutor: Margaret L Johnson\n\nExecutor Relationship: Wife\n\nCertificate Number: 8457\n\nIn their later years, James and Lillian \"Red Wing\" lived near each other in New York. Threads still connected them, and, after all, they were still married, but \"she had nothing good to say about him\".\n\nIt's an interesting story. It'd make a fascinating bio film, these several years working on films in Pawhuska and Cushing, if they could keep the story under control and not twist it into something completely unrecognizable. There had been so much tragedy in Osage county, and they were in the midst of the investigations into the osage oil murders--imagine also the somewhat diverting excitement of a film being produced there, and a film company perhaps even establishing itself in the area.\n\nWhat happened to The Unknown Man? FIve (probably) reels of movie all filmed in Osage County, with reservation people, and Chief Bacon Rind. And it's so gone that it's not even remembered on IMDB, though it was completed and premiered in Pawhuska.\n\nOne wonders happened to What a Woman Can Do , if it was premiered, or if there's no further mention of it because it was never completed.\n\nAnd Tragedies of the Osage Hills, which, however fictional, may have been the first treatment of the Osage murders? The likelihood is that it was trash exploitation. But what if it wasn't? We'll likely never know.\n\nDo any of these films exist or are they long since land-fill? Did Youngdeer really have a dream of making Pawhuska into a film center, or was it a con from the beginning, or was he the kind of person where it was going to have to ultimately crash and burn? No matter intentions, one hundred years later, wouldn't it be amazing to have these films that were made in the area, featuring people from the area? It's not going to happen, but I wonder what other materials might be out there on the making of these films?\n\n* * * * * *\n\nPersonal note. My paternal family was, for several generations, in Chautauqua County, Kansas, and Osage County and Kay County, Oklahoma, having moved to the area in the 1870s, and were on the Osage Reservation before Oklahoma became a state. Family members married Osage and Ioway tribal members, and neighbors were consistently Osage tribal members and descendants of individuals allotted on the Nemaha \"Mixed-Breed\" Reserve in Nebraska, so many of these names are already familiar to me through my genealogical research that broadly extends into historical community context as well.\n\nSeptember 2022.
