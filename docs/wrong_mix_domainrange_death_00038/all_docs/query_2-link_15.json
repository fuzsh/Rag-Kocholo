His first acting stint was with Thomas Edison. (You know you’re a pioneer in the film industry if you got your start working for Thomas Edison.) After a move to Hollywood, Lloyd received some bit roles before landing a steady gig with Roach studios as “Lonesome Luke,” a typical comedic role of that era.\n\nGrowing tired of the “Lonesome Luke” character, Lloyd created his most famous persona: a kind of everyman in ordinary clothes with a pair of horn-rimmed glasses who was constantly getting into trouble. Along with Charlie Chapman and Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd dominated the silent film-era comedy genre. His most iconic scenes have him dangling high above city streets from skyscrapers, clocks etc.\n\nAfter an incredible string of successful silent films, Lloyd was able to transition to the ‘talkies,’ but by the Great Depression, his popularity had begun to fade. After a career that included appearances in over 200 films, Harold Lloyd died in 1971 at the age of 77. He is interred in the Great Mausoleum at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, CA, specifically in the Begonia tier.\n\n(Source: wikipedia.org)\n\nDescription:\n\nSee Long Description above.Date of birth: 04/20/1893Date of death: 03/08/1971Area of notoriety: EntertainmentMarker Type: PlaqueSetting: IndoorVisiting Hours/Restrictions: 8:00 am to 6:00 pmFee required?: NoWeb site: [Web Link]\n\nVisit Instructions:\n\nTo post a visit log for waymarks in this category, you must have personally visited the waymark location.
