Thanks to the assistance of Steve Lewis, who is maintaining this website, new information is constantly being added. Your suggestions and comments are always welcome. My email address can be found at the bottom of this page. [AJH]\n\nThe 2015 Revised Edition of Crime Fiction IV is now available on CD-Rom. The price remains the same as for previous editions, $49.95, and can be ordered from Bill Contento through the Locus Magazine website. Unfortunately this will be the last CD-Rom edition of Crime Fiction IV. All future changes and additions will be listed only on this website through a continuing series of addendas.\n\nThese addendas have been appearing on this website for the past 10 years, but since all of that information is now included in the 2015 Revised Edition, it will no longer be directly accessible from this starting page. Below is Part 1 of these new addendas. Links will be added for Parts 2 and on as they are created.\n\nTo SEARCH for a specific author, title or phrase anywhere in the various parts of this Addenda, there two ways to most effectively use Google: (1) Do a normal search on Google but add crimefictioniv (or crimefictioniv.com) as one of the words sought. If searching for an author’s name, it is suggested that you do not use quotes. (2) Go to the Advanced Google search page and procede as directed, but be sure to include crimefictioniv.com in the box provided for the domain to be searched.\n\nPart 2 November 2015\n\nPart 3 December 2015\n\nPart 4\n\nPart 5\n\nPart 6\n\nPart 7\n\nPart 8\n\nPart 9\n\nPart 10\n\nPart 11\n\nPart 12\n\nPart 13 February 2018\n\nPart 14 May 2018\n\nPart 15 July 2018\n\nPart 16 September 2018\n\nPart 17 November 2018\n\nPart 18 January 2019\n\nPart 19 March 2019\n\nPart 20 June 2019\n\nPart 21 October 2019\n\nPart 22 December 2019\n\nPart 23 March 2020\n\nPart 24 May 2020\n\nPart 25 July 2020\n\nPart 26 October 2020\n\nPart 27 December 2020\n\nPart 28 March 2021\n\nPart 29 May 2021\n\nPart 30 September 2021 [Final Addenda to CFIV.]\n\nPART 1:\n\nMost of these entries represent new information, and such entries contain additional information to provide some bibliographic context.
