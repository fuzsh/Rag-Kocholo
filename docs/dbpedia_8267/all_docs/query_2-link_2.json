Time is running out. The Evening Star is storming the gates. If the artifact falls into the wrong hands, it could mean the downfall of other preserves and possibly the world.\n\nWill Kendra learn to use her fairy gifts in time?\n\nWill Seth stay out of trouble?\n\nAuthor: Brandon Mull | Illustrator: Brandon Dorman\n\nPaperback, 435 pages, Ages 9-12.
