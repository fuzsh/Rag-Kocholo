        "text": "Removing the stopper from another vial, Kendra sprinkled the contents over Seth's clothes. They waited, but there was no reaction. Looks like we'll have to save the day wearing handkerchiefs, Kendra sighed.\n\nThey're nice and silky, Seth called.\n\nYou're a nut, Kendra said. She turned to Mendigo.\n\nMendigo, collect our clothes and our things and watch for us to come out of the house. When we come out, you need to hurry and meet up with us.\n\nMendigo started tugging at her shirt. Mendigo, wait to collect my clothes until after I shrink, and leave us with the handkerchiefs.\n\nMendigo picked up Tanu's pouch and Seth's clothes.\n\nHey, Seth cried, let me see if I can carry the glove.\n\nKendra retrieved the glove from the pocket of Seth's pants, telling Mendigo to leave the glove with them. She handed it to Seth. He draped it over his shoulder and started walking. It looked cumbersome. Is it too big? Kendra asked.\n\nI can handle it, Seth said. When we turn big we'll be glad we have it. Speaking of which, drink your potion and let's get going. I don't want to turn big and get crushed in the brownie hole.\n\nKendra unstopped a third vial and drank it. Seth was right, it made her tingle. It felt like her limbs were on pins and needles, as if they had fallen asleep and now feeling was returning most uncomfortably. As she shrank, the tingling304 sensation intensified. Whenever Seth knew her leg had beenasleep, he always tried to poke the tingly limb. It drove her crazy. This was much worse, stinging tingles starting at her fingertips and toes and racing through her whole body.\n\n-- Advertisement --\n\nBefore Kendra fully recognized what was happening, her shirt was all around her like a collapsed tent. She crawled to an opening through one of her sleeves. Close your eyes,\n\nSeth, she called, noticing how high and squeaky her voice sounded.\n\nThey're closed, he said. I don't want nightmares.\n\nKendra found the other handkerchief, turning it into a makeshift toga. Okay, you can look.\n\nYou know, Seth said, if we turn big while we're in the dungeon we'll be trapped down there.\n\nKendra walked over to one of the empty vials lying on the ground. Grunting and shoving, she tipped it upright.\n\nRelative to her new size, it was nearly as big as a garbage can.\n\nThe glass is thick, Kendra said. I can barely move this empty one.\n\nSetting down the bulky glove, Seth tried to lift the bottle. He could barely hold it off the ground. Too bad we can't bring a spare, he said. We'll just have to hurry.\n\nMendigo, remember, watch for us and meet up with us when we come out. Mendigo now looked enormous, like some eerie monument.\n\nSeth slung the glove over his shoulder. Come on.\n\nKendra looked up. Through the gaps in the branches above her, she saw stars coming out. She followed her brother down into the yawning hole.305Brownie Doors\n\nAlthough the dirt near the opening of the brownie hole was crumbly and loose, the ground soon became smooth and firm as the tunnel sloped downward. Near the entrance Kendra and Seth needed to crouch in some places, but before long the tunnel increased in diameter so they could comfortably walk upright. At first roots poked through the walls and ceiling, but as they descended deeper, roots became scarce, and the floor of the tunnel leveled out. The dirt felt cool against their bare feet.\n\nI can't see a thing, Seth said.\n\nYour eyes will adjust, Kendra said. It's dim but it isn't black.\n\nSeth turned around. I can see a little light looking back, a very little, but it is pitch black looking forward.306 You must be going blind, I can see way down thetunnel.\n\nThen you take the lead.\n\nKendra led them deeper into the tunnel. She wasn't sure what Seth was talking about. Sure, it was dim, but there was enough light from the entrance even to reveal the texture of the different stones embedded in the tunnel walls.\n\nCan you still see? Seth asked.\n\nHaven't your eyes adjusted yet?\n\nKendra, it is totally black. No light. I can't see you. I\n\ncan't see my hand. And I can't see any light looking back.\n\nKendra looked over her shoulder. The way back appeared equally as dim as the way ahead. You see nothing?\n\nMy night vision is fine, Kendra, Seth said. I could see pretty well when I went to the grove, and there wasn't much light there. If you can still see, then you can see in the dark.\n\nKendra thought about the overcast night at the pond when she had assumed light was filtering through the clouds.\n\nShe remembered seeing into cells in the dungeon that Seth thought were black. And now here she was, deep under-ground, and despite the dwindling twilight outside, no matter how far they walked from the entrance, it had stopped getting dimmer.\n\nI think you're right, Kendra said. I can still see pretty well. The light hasn't faded for a while.\n\nI wish those fairies had kissed me a little, Seth said.\n\nJust be glad one of us can see. Come on.307 The tunnel wound back and forth several times beforeKendra came to a stop. I see a door up ahead.\n\nDoes it block the way?\n\nYes.\n\nWell, let's go knock.\n\nKendra started forward.\n\nJust a second, Seth said. I lost my handkerchief. No peeking. Here it is. Okay, lead the way.\n\nA round wall filled the entire tunnel. In the wall was an oval-shaped door. When they got close, Kendra tried the knob. It was locked. So she knocked.\n\nAn instant later the door opened swiftly, and she was looking at a thin man about her same height. He had a long nose, leaflike ears, and smooth skin, like a baby's. He looked\n\nKendra and Seth up and down. Brownies only, he said, closing the door.\n\nWhat happened? Seth asked. Could you understand that?\n\nBrownies only, Kendra translated. A little guy opened the door, said that, and closed it. She slapped the door.\n\nPlease, we need to get into the house, it's an emergency!\n\nThe door opened a crack. The little man peered out with one eye. Now, why would you go and learn Rowian when everyone knows brownies don't talk to strangers?\n\nRowian? Kendra asked.\n\nDon't play coy with me, young lady. I've met a few fairies and nymphs who knew the rudiments of the brownie tongue, but never a miniature human.\n\nI'm Kendra, she said. I love brownies. You cook308 wonderful food and you repaired my grandparents' houseafter it was ruined.\n\nWe all do what we do, the brownie said humbly.\n\nMy brother and I need desperately to get into the house, and this is the only way. Please let us pass.\n\nThis way is meant only for brownies, he said. I may be the least of your troubles. There are magical barriers in place to prevent others from entering the house through our passage.\n\nKendra glanced at Seth, who was watching the exchange dumbfoundedly. But we're allowed to enter the house, we're guests there.\n\nCurious way for guests to enter.\n\nMy grandparents are the caretakers of Fablehaven.\n\nSomebody has sabotaged them, so we are trying to sneak in to help. We have to hurry. If this potion wears off, we'll clog up your tunnel.\n\nCan't have that, the brownie said thoughtfully. Very well, seeing as you're brownie-sized, and seeing as you belong to the house, and seeing as you explained yourself so patiently, I see no harm in letting you pass. On one condition. You both must wear blindfolds. You are about to enter a brownie community. Our secrets are our own.\n\nWhat's he saying? Seth asked.\n\nHe says we have to wear blindfolds.\n\nTell him to get on with it, Seth said.\n\nWhat's he saying? the brownie asked.\n\nHe says he'll wear a blindfold.\n\nFair enough, the brownie said. One moment. The309 brownie closed the door. Kendra and Seth waited. She triedthe knob. It was locked.\n\nWhat's he doing? Seth asked.\n\nI don't know, Kendra said.\n\nJust as Kendra was beginning to wonder if she had been abandoned, the door opened. Two blindfolds, the brownie said. And two blankets, more your size. I can't abide that fine material dragging in the dirt.\n\nWhat's he saying? Seth said.\n\nHe brought blindfolds, Kendra relayed.\n\nAsk if I have to wear one since I can't see in the first place, Seth said.\n\nJust wear it, Kendra said. And he wants us to switch our handkerchiefs for blankets.\n\nKendra and Seth traded the handkerchiefs for the blankets, making the exchange in such a way that they remained strategically covered throughout. Then the brownie tied on the blindfolds. I'll be your guide, dear, a female voice said to Kendra. Put your hand on my shoulder.\n\nTell your friend I'll be guiding him, the male brownie said.\n\nHe's going to guide you, Seth.\n\nThe brownies led them through the door and along the tunnel. Soon the ground became hard. It felt like polished stone. Even with the blindfold on, Kendra could tell that they had entered a lighted area. The brownies gave occasional instructions like step up or duck your head, which\n\nKendra relayed to Seth. Occasionally she heard murmuring,310 as if their passage was stirring hushed comments from acrowd.\n\nAfter they had walked for some time, the glow faded, and the polished floor became dirt once more. The brownies came to a halt. The male brownie removed the blindfolds.\n\nThey were standing at a door that looked very much like the previous one. Is it dark? Kendra asked.\n\nI can't see a thing, Seth said.\n\nJust follow this passage, the brownie instructed. It will lead straight to the dungeon. I suppose you know your way from there. I can't say whether the barriers will impede you.\n\nThat risk is yours to take.\n\nThank you, Kendra said.\n\nHere are your clothes, the female brownie said. She held up a lovely dress and a pair of moccasins, all made from the silk of the handkerchief. Kendra accepted the dress, and the female brownie handed Seth a shirt, jacket, pants, and slippers fashioned from the same material.\n\nNow, that is improvising, Kendra said. The clothes look wonderful.\n\nWe all do what we do, the female brownie responded with a small curtsy.\n\nThe brownies held up the blankets in such a way as to allow Kendra and Seth privacy as they put on their clothes.\n\nKendra could not believe how comfortably the dress fit her.\n\nJust my size, Seth said, pulling on the slippers.\n\nKendra turned the knob and opened the door. Thanks again, she said.\n\nThe brownies nodded congenially. She and Seth stepped311 through the door, closed it behind them, and proceededdown the gloomy tunnel. These are the silkiest clothes ever, Seth said. I'm going to use them as pajamas.\n\nIf you drink a shrinking potion every night, Kendra reminded him.\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nEventually the curved dirt walls of the tunnel gave way to stone, and the corridor became more square. The air began to smell less earthy and more dank. I think we're getting close, Kendra said.\n\nGood-I'm sick of the dark, Seth said.\n\nI'm not sure the dungeon will be any brighter, Kendra said.\n\nMaybe we'll find a way to reach a light switch, he said.\n\nWe'll see.\n\nThe corridor ended at an elaborately engraved brass door. I think this is it, Kendra said. She tried the handle, and the door swung open to reveal a room illuminated by trembling firelight. The source of the light was off to the left along the same wall as the tiny door, so they could not yet see it.\n\nI can see, Seth whispered excitedly.\n\nI think we must have made it past the barriers, Kendra said.\n\nSeth pushed by her and stepped out into the room. Like the walls, the floor was composed of stone blocks mortared together. Seth stared off to the left. Hey, it's the room where they make the ----\n\nA huge, veiny hand suddenly seized him. The glove he312 was carrying dropped to the ground as Seth was yanked outof sight.\n\nSeth! Kendra cried. A second hand shot through the doorway into the tunnel. She tried to dodge the grasping fingers and retreat, but the nimble hand grabbed her without difficulty.\n\nThe hand pulled Kendra from the tunnel and lifted her high in the air. At her diminished height, the room looked vast. When she saw the large cauldron bubbling over a low fire, she realized it was simply the room where the goblins prepared the glop. In the wavering firelight, Kendra recognized her captor as Slaggo.\n\nVoorsh, I caught some strays to sweeten the glop,\n\nSlaggo grated in his guttural voice.\n\nAre you daft? Voorsh sneered. No snatching brownies.\n\nHe sat on a table in the corner picking his teeth with a knife.\n\nI know that, you twit, Slaggo griped. They aren't brownies. Have a smell.\n\nKendra was trying to pry apart the fingers that were clutching her. It was no use; they were thicker than her leg and covered in calluses as hard as stone. Slaggo held her up to Voorsh's snout, and he took a couple of sniffs, slit nostrils flaring.\n\nSmells like people, Voorsh said. Something familiar to the odor...\n\nWe're Kendra and Seth, Kendra shouted in her squeaky voice. Our grandparents are the caretakers of\n\nFablehaven.313 It speaks Goblush, Slaggo said.Thinks she's an imp, Voorsh chuckled.\n\nYou have to help us, Kendra cried.\n\nPipe down, Slaggo said. You're in no position to issue orders. I remember these two. Ruth brought them through here not long ago.\n\nRight you are, Voorsh agreed. And considering how things have changed...\n\nWhat do you mean how things have changed? Kendra yelled.\n\nHe means seeing as your grandsires are now prisoners in their own dungeon, Slaggo said, it might be a fine prank to watch them gobble down their own flesh.\n\nYou read my mind, Voorsh gurgled.\n\nWhat are they saying? Seth asked.\n\nThey're talking about cooking us, Kendra said.\n\nGrandma and Grandpa are imprisoned here.\n\nIf you cook us, you'll pay, Seth shouted. You'll be guilty of murder. Grandma and Grandpa won't be imprisoned forever!\n\nThis one speaks like people, Slaggo grunted.\n\nIt has a point, Voorsh sighed.\n\nYou can't cook us, Kendra called. The treaty protects us.\n\nTrespassers in our dungeon forfeit all protection,\n\nVoorsh explained.\n\nBut the runt may be right about Stan and Ruth, Slaggo said.314Course, if Stan and Ruth don't know, they can't rightlypunish us, Voorsh mused."
