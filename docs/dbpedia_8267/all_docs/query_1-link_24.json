A goblin appears in Kendra's class, Seth gets bitten by some sort of demon, and they can't get a hold of their grandfather. Soon they are whisked back to Fablehaven - but are they any safer there? Not only do they have enemies wishing to penetrate the preserve, but soon they realize that there is an enemy from within, too."
