You'll find me talking about YA, Romance, Christian Romance, LDS Romance, and occasionally other genres and hobby titles. I always include content info in my reviews so you know what you're diving into. I enjoy helping publishers and authors promote their books here and over at Prism Book Tours. Outside of blogging, I'm a total Marvel geek, Austen fan, and enjoy hanging with the family (husband, four kiddos, and pup)."
