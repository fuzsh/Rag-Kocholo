        "text": "American author (born 1974)\n\n\"Five Kingdoms\" redirects here. For the biological term, see Kingdom (biology).\n\nBrandon Mull (born November 8, 1974) is an American author best known for his children's fantasy series, Fablehaven, as well as Dragonwatch, The Candy Shop War, the Beyonders trilogy, and the Five Kingdoms series.[2][3] He also began the Spirit Animals series.\n\nIn June of 2020, Mull married Erlyn Madsen. Together, they have a total of eleven children, with four from his previous marriage and seven from hers.[4]\n\nHe is inspired by J. R. R. Tolkien, C. S. Lewis, and J. K. Rowling.[5]\n\nEducation and early work\n\n[edit]\n\nBrandon Mull went to Mt. Diablo Elementary School in Clayton, California.

He currently lives in Alpine, Utah, and is a graduate of Brigham Young University in Utah.[6] While at BYU Mull led the sketch comedy group Divine Comedy.[7] Mull served a two-year mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Chile.\n\nAs a child, Mull was known for a strong imagination. He would sometimes spend hours in his bedroom, without toys, just imagining and acting out stories that were in his head. In school, his constant day dreaming sometimes irritated teachers while others encouraged his imagination.[8]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nMull has worked as a comedian, a filing clerk, a patio installer, a movie promoter, a copywriter, and briefly as a chicken stacker.[9]\n\nMull's first attempt at publishing a novel failed and was never published. The failure led him to a job working as a marketer for the film Saints and Soldiers. It wasn't until after the film company he worked for was acquired by a publishing company that Mull successfully published his first novel, Fablehaven.[8]\n\nFablehaven is currently optioned by Schaffer Studios.[10]\n\nPublished works\n\n[edit]\n\nFablehaven Series\n\n[edit]\n\nFablehaven\n\n[edit]\n\nFablehaven is about siblings Seth and Kendra Sorenson who find out their grandfather and grandmother run Fablehaven, one of the magical reserves where mythical creatures can live in peace.
