        "text": "Back in Dec. '08, I started a thread called \"What you have to read before Articles of the Federation and Destiny\" which was an attempt to list out all of the books that are consistent with the Pocket Books Trek universe. This list is longer than that list...\n\nBy consistent, I mean by sharing characters, events or situations. I know that there are some inconsistencies of events and characters in the list, Ogawa's child's gender and the fate of her husband from Genesis Wave to Titan, for example. Such is life in a shared universe. Absolute consistency is impossible in a constantly evolving shared universe, so I go more for the intent of consistency, than the actual success of it.\n\nIn cases like these, I assume that while we may see an event such as the Genesis disaster in one separate \"Myriad Universe\" where Ogawa's life turned out one way, a near identical event happened in the \"standard\" universe as well, where Ogawa's life turned just a little differently.\n\nFor the five series based on the televised Trek, I sought out a \"core continuity\", books that were released with novel-to-novel consistency in mind. Largely this would be where that series serialized story-telling began. From there, I included other books that cross-referenced into that series by way of characters, events, places and situations.\n\nFor the lit-only series, I included that series run of books, and noted where it crossed over into the larger lit-line.\n\nI was going to mine through the various author's annotations for every bit of continuity gold I could find, but this project has taken up a lot more time than I thought it would, and I have to sleep sometime. Instead, I provided links to author annotations.\n\nThis list is not meant to be definitive or comprehensive. Many of the books herein just don't quite fit in the Trek universe anymore, and if you don't want a book here in your \"personal continuity\", then so be it.\n\nI also know that there are connections that I missed, forgot about or just plain never knew about. I hope that anyone discovers or knows about a book that should be on here, that they post it here in this thread, and that this list can be updated annually or so.\n\nI would like to thank the people who responded in the original thread with info that I incorporated here.\n\nSci\n\nSteve Mollmann\n\nChristopher\n\n8of5\n\nSemah\n\nUpdate 4/21/11:\n\nI would like to thank the following people who posted in this thread and in the The Continuity Of Days Gone By thread who contributed to the first update.\n\nGreg Cox\n\nChristopher\n\nRyan23450\n\nToddCam\n\nDevilEyes\n\nKingDaniel\n\nDigificWriter\n\nIdran\n\nThrawn\n\ncaptcalhoun\n\nAlso, I have quotes from the original thread from Sci and Mr. Mollmann peppered throughout.\n\nAnd a special \"thank you\" to the TrekLit forums helpful moderators:\n\nLightningStorm\n\nRosalind\n\nOnward. By series...\n\nTOS\n\nTNG\n\nDS9\n\nVOY/ENT\n\nNew Frontier\n\nStargazer\n\nSCE/COE\n\nVanguard/Titan/Klingon Empire\n\nMinis, Anthologies, One-off novels, Comics and Misc.\n\nMirror/Myriad Universes\n\nAddendum One: Authors Annotations\n\nAddendum Two: Strange New Worlds\n\nTOS \"core continuity\" is a little harder to define as there has never been a serialized approach taken to the series. Below are books or series that were released with direct links to the larger book continuity.\n\nNew Earth\n\nThe New Earth concept was created Diane Carey and John Ordover and crossed into the Gateways event that spanned the Trek lit line.\n\nWagon Train to the Stars (Diane Carey)\n\nBelle Terre (Dean Wesley Smith with Diane Carey)\n\nRough Trails (L.A. Graf)\n\nThe Flaming Arrow (Kathy Oltion and Jerry Oltion)\n\nThin Air (Kristine Kathryn Rusch and Dean Wesley Smith)\n\nChallenger (Diane Carey)\n\nGateways: Chainmail and the novella \"Exodus\" from Gateways book seven: What Lay Beyond (Diane Carey)\n\nGreg Cox\n\nFive books by Greg Cox that tie themselves together through the use of Gary Seven, Khan, and Shaun Christopher. They are all tied to the larger novelverse through the use of the flag for Khan established in the novel Section 31: Abyss, a part of the post-finale DS9 series. (Although the depiction of the Tal Shiar in Assignment Eternity differs somewhat from the depiction in the \"Vulcan's Noun\" series.)\n\nAssignment Eternity\n\nThe Eugenics Wars: The Rise and Fall of Khan Noonian Singh, Volume 1\n\nThe Eugenics Wars: The Rise and Fall of Khan Noonian Singh, Volume 2\n\nTo Reign in Hell: The Exile of Khan Noonian Singh\n\nThe Rings of Time\n\nCox referenced \"The Aliens Are Coming\" by Dayton Ward from Strange New Worlds III and the backstory for Ralph Offenhouse established in TNG: Debtor's Planet in The Eugenics Wars. Cox took the name of Gary Seven's benefactors, \"The Aegis\", from DC Comics 2nd TOS series written by Howard Weinstein.\n\nErrand of... by Kevin Ryan\n\nThese are included as they incorporate the Palais de la Concorde, the seat of Federation government created for the larger novelverse, and events from this series were alluded to in the Vanguard book Open Secrets. However, according to author Kevin Ryan, the character Karel of the House of Gorkon was supposed to be the Gorkon of Star Trek VI (although he is never explicitly identified as such), which is inconsistent with the character's appearance in Vanguard. YMMV.\n\nErrand of Vengeance\n\nThe Edge of the Sword\n\nKilling Blow\n\nRiver of Blood\n\nErrand of Fury\n\nSeeds of Rage\n\nDemands of Honor\n\nSacrifices of War\n\n\"Vulcan's Noun\" (by Josepha Sherman and Susan Shwartz)\n\nThis series takes Spock from the end of the TOS movie era into the TNG movie era. The final book in the series included an appearance by Christine Vale, a character created in the SCE series, then used in the TNG A Time to... series, before finding home in the Titan series. Also seen (or mentioned?) is Federation President Min Zife, originally seen in the A Time to... books A Time to Kill and A Time to Heal by David Mack.\n\nAlso referred to, with modifications necessitated by later canon, were characters and situations established in \"Rihannsu-verse\" books (See below).\n\nEvents from Vulcan's Heart were mentioned in The Lost Era novel The Art of the Impossible, Articles of the Federation, and Titan: Taking Wing.\n\nVulcan's Forge\n\nVulcan's Heart\n\nVulcan's Soul\n\nExodus\n\nExiles\n\nEpiphany\n\nSection 31: Cloak by S. D. Perry was a part of the Section 31 mini that crossed over into the post-finale DS9 books. Cloak established the anti-31 cabal of Starfleet officers that Elias Vaughn of the DS9 novels is a member.\n\nGateways book one: One Small Step and the novella \"One Giant Leap\" from Gateways book seven: What Lay Beyond by Susan Wright were a part of the Gateways event that spanned the lit line.\n\nEx Machina by Christopher L. Bennett used the Andorian naming convention established in the post-finale DS9 books and made a brief mention of events from the novel Section 31: Cloak. Ex Machina also refers to Sulu's backstory as established in The Kobayashi Maru by Julia Ecklar and elements of the Star Trek: The Motion Picture novelization by Gene Roddenberry (although the novelization itself differs from later established canon). It also establishes Willard Decker's multi-species crew experiment later referred to in the Titan series and is consistent with The Captain's Daughter and \"Night Whispers\" from Enterprise Logs.\n\nForged In Fire (By Martin and Mangels) and Sulu's role in it was foreshadowed in the Lost Era's Serpents Among The Ruins by David R. George III.\n\nA Choice of Catastrophes (forthcoming) by Steve Mollmann and Michael Shuster\n\nCast No Shadows by James Swallow features Elias Vaughn from the post-finale DS9 lit.\n\nForgotten History by Christopher L. Bennett is consistent with his Star Trek: Department of Temporal Investigations: Watching the Clock novel.\n\nConstellations anthology-- The story \"Devices and Desires\" was referenced in TNG: Before Dishonor.\n\nIntroduction by David Gerrold\n\n\"First, Do No Harm\" by Dayton Ward & Kevin Dilmore\n\n\"The Landing Party\" by Robert Greenberger\n\n\"Official Record\" by Howard Weinstein\n\n\"Fracture\" by Jeff Bond\n\n\"Chaotic Response\" by Stuart Moore\n\n\"As Others See Us\" by Christopher L. Bennett\n\n\"See No Evil\" by Jill Sherwin\n\n\"The Leader\" by Dave Galanter\n\n\"Ambition\" by William Leisner\n\n\"Devices and Desires\" by Kevin Lauderdale\n\n\"Where Everybody Knows Your Name\" by Jeffrey Lang\n\n\"Make-Believe\" by Allyn Gibson\n\nMere Anarchy compilation\n\nThings Fall Apart by Dayton Ward and Kevin Dilmore\n\nThe Centre Cannot Hold by Mike W. Barr\n\nShadows of the Indignant by Dave Galanter\n\nThe Darkness Drops Again by Christopher L. Bennett\n\nThe Blood-Dimmed Tide by Howard Weinstein\n\nIt's Hour Come 'Round by Margaret Wander Bonnano\n\nChristopher L. Bennett's annotations for Ex Machina...\n\nhttp://home.fuse.net/ChristopherLBen...hinaNotes.html\n\n...Mere Anarchy: The Darkness Drops Again...\n\nhttp://home.fuse.net/ChristopherLBen...ction.html#ExM\n\n...and \"As Others See Us\" from Constellations.\n\nhttp://home.fuse.net/ChristopherLBen....html#AsOthers\n\nCaptain Pike\n\nThe following books about Captain Christopher Pike are all largely consistent with each other, and have tenuous ties to the novelverse\n\nVulcan's Glory by D.C. Fontana\n\nThe Rift by Peter David (which also includes the original security team of Meyers and Boyajin, who appeared in PAD's TOS comics and were mentioned in Strike Zone. )\n\nLegacy by Michael Jan Friedman\n\nBurning Dreams by Margaret Wander Bonanno, while not inconsistent with the above books, still followed it's own path. It was consistent with the relationship established between Spock and Saavik in Vulcan's Heart, and included the character of Moves-With-Burning-Grace from the Marvel Early Voyages comic and the SCE series. Also mentioned was the Palais de la Concorde, the Federation seat of power established for the lit.\n\nConnected\n\nEnterprise: The First Adventure by Vonda McIntyre is referenced in multiple novels, particularly in the \"Rihannsu-verse\"\n\nThe Final Reflection by John M. Ford-- the book within the book was named as a favorite of Worf's in the DS9 short story \"Broken Oaths\" by Keith R. A. DeCandido in the DS9 anthology Prophecy and Change. Articles of the Federation established the the Klingon game of klin'zha, established in TFR, is still a popular game in the Empire. The Kinshaya, recent member of the Typhon Pact, were established in TFR. Klingon Imperial Intelligence as developed was established in TFR. The IKS Gorkon series established that Klingons still enjoy watching holo-vids of \"Battle Cruiser Vengenance\", as established in TFR. The Withiki from TFR were mentioned in the SCE tale The Future Begins.\n\nStrangers From the Sky by Margaret Wander Bonanno makes reference to The Final Reflection.\n\nThe Pandora Principle by Carolyn Crowes established the background for Saavik that was later used for the character in other works, including Unspoken Truth by Margaret Wander Bonanno.\n\nTwilight's End by Jerry Oltion was referenced in SCE's Ishtar Rising.\n\nUnspoken Truth by Margaret Wander Bonanno utilized the background established for Saavik in The Pandora Principle.\n\nThe Captain's Daughter by Peter David established the backstories for Demora Sulu and John Harriman that were later used in the Lost Era novel Serpents Among the Ruins. The Captain's Daughter is consistent with PAD's short story \"Shakedown\" from the anthology Enterprise Logs.\n\nIn The Name of Honor by Dayton Ward established Chancellor Kesh, who served as Klingon Chancellor before Gorkon. One of the Chancellor-class vessels of the IKS Gorkon series was named after Kesh. However, like the Errand of... series, the depiction of Gorkon herein is not consistent with what has been established in the Vanguard series.\n\nThe Brave and the Bold book one, \"The First Artifact\" is part of the same story that includes segments set in both the DS9 and Gorkon continuities.\n\nThe Last Round-up by Christie Golden established the Huanni, a race later used by Golden in her post-finale Voyager books.\n\nSCE-- The Future Begins\n\nWhile The Future Begins By Steve Mollmann and Michael Schuster is a tale of the SCE, it focuses on Scotty, trying to tell his life story while including many of his novel appearances. For a full accounting of this book's crossovers, see the SCE page.\n\nTOS novels and short stories referenced in The Future Begins (with thanks to Steve Mollmann):\n\nNovels:\n\nEngines of Destiny by Gene DeWeese\n\nThe Kobayashi Maru by Julia Ecklar\n\nTraitor Winds by L.A. Graf\n\nHome is the Hunter by Dana Kramer-Rolls\n\nDyson Sphere by Charles Pellegrino and George Zebrowski\n\nCrisis on Centaurus by Brad Ferguson\n\nShort Stories\n\n\"Dorians Diary\" by G. Wood in Strange New Worlds III\n\n\"Ancient History\" by Robert J. Mendenhall in Strange New Worlds IV\n\n\"Bum Radish: Five Spins on a Turquoise Reindeer\" by T. G. Theodore in Strange New Worlds IV\n\n\"Full Circle\" by Scott Pearson in Strange New Worlds VII\n\nComics\n\n\"Out of Time\" (DC's 1994 TNG special)\n\n\"Old Debts\" (DC's 1995 TNG special)\n\nThe Rihannsu-verse\n\nThe history of the Romulans used in the Vulcan's Soul trilogy, was largely based (with significant modification to accomodate later established canon) on the history created by Diane Duane in her book The Romulan Way. Duane wrote a whole series of books utilizing her \"Lower Decks\" crewmen who appeared in other books by other authors of the era, creating a loose continuity of their own.\n\nSeveral aspects of the \"Rihannsu-verse\" clash with later canon, including the depiction of Remus, the Romulan political structure and aspects of the Federation government.\n\nDiane Duane (with Peter Morwood)\n\nAll of Duane's TOS books included at least one of her distinctive Enterprise crew members including Harb Tanzer, Naraht the Horta, Janice Kersarus or Lia Burke.\n\nThe Wounded Sky\n\nMy Enemy, My Ally\n\nThe Romulan Way (with Peter Morwood, Duane's husband)\n\nSwordhunt\n\nHonor Blade\n\nThe Empty Chair\n\nSpock's World\n\nDoctor's Orders\n\nRules of Engagement (by Peter Morwood)\n\nDiane Carey- Fortunes of War\n\nEvents from Diane Carey's books following Enterprise crewman Piper and an attempted coup by Vice-Admiral Rittenhouse and it's aftermath were later brought up in The Lost Years (\"The Rittenhouse scandal\") as the reason for Kirk's promotion to Admiral.\n\nDreadnought!\n\nBattlestations!\n\nJ. M. Dillard and The Lost Years\n\nJ. M. Dillard wrote several novels with her own \"Lower Decks\" cast, and then wrote the first book of the Lost Years series. She incorporated elements from Spock's World and The Romulan Way into the tale, along with plot elements from Dreadnought! and her own characters. The following are written by Dillard except where noted otherwise.\n\nMindshadow\n\nDemons\n\nBloodthirst\n\nThe Lost Years\n\nTraitor Winds (by L. A. Graf)\n\nA Flag Full of Stars (by Brad Ferguson)\n\nRecovery\n\nA.C. Crispen-- The Yesterday Saga\n\nThe second of A. C. Crispen's books about Zar, Spock's son with Zarabeth from All Our Yesterdays, featured a number of references to other books, including cameos from Diane Duane's Naraht the Horta and J.M. Dillard's Ingrit Tompson.\n\nYesterday Saga\n\nYesterday's Son\n\nTime For Yesterday\n\nReferenced in Time for Yesterday\n\nThe Entropy Effect by Vonda McIntyre\n\nEnterprise: The First Adventure by Vonda McIntyre\n\nCrisis On Centaurus by Brad Ferguson\n\nDeep Domain By Howard Weinstein\n\nThe Vulcan Academy Murders by Jean Lorrah\n\nThe IDIC Epidemic, also by Jean Lorrah is connected as it is a direct sequel to The Vulcan Academy Murders. (Both books are also referred to in the Vanguard novel Precipice.)\n\nThe \"Nexus trilogy\"...\n\nIngrit Tompson from J.M. Dillard's books appears in \"The Final Nexus\".\n\nThe Abode of Life by Lee Corey\n\nChain of Attack by Gene DeWeese\n\nThe Final Nexus by Gene DeWese\n\nDiane Carey's \"George Kirk\" duology\n\nFinal Frontier (used the \"Rihannsu\" model for the Romulans)\n\nBest Destiny\n\n\"Though Hell Should Bar the Way\" by Greg Cox from Enterprise Logs is consistent with these works.\n\nOther books with \"Rihannsu-verse\" Connections:\n\nUhura's Song by Janet Kagan (utilizes McIntyre crewman \"Snarl\")\n\nShadow Lord by Lawrence Yep (references McIntyre's Sulu backstory)\n\nHow Much for Just the Planet? by John M. Ford (Utililized the Klinzhai model for Klingons established in The Final Reflection)\n\nDwellers in the Crucible by Margaret Wander Bonano(Utilizes Rihannsu and Klinzhai models for Romulans and Klingons)\n\nStrangers from the Sky by Margaret Wander Bonano (mentioned in Spock's World)\n\nDreams of the Raven by Carmen Carter (Klinzhai model for Klingons)\n\nMusic of the Spheres-- by Margaret Wander Bonano (Unpublished but readily available novel by our own Garamet that utilized the Rihannsu model for Romulans. Contact her and she'll e-mail you a copy.)\n\nIt's worth noting that, even though it is no longer accurate to canon, many of the authors in the \"Rihannsu\" era would use the Star Trek Spaceflight Chronology written by Stan Goldstein, Fred Goldstein and Rick Sternback as a reference point in dating their books.\n\nTNG -- Core continuity\n\nThe A Time to... series was the beginning of the serialized approach to TNG story-telling. I start TNG's \"core continuity\" there...\n\nThe A Time to... series featured Lieutenant Christine Vale, who was created as Enterprise security chief in SCE: Belly of the Beast, and used consistently thereafter. A Time to Be Born/Die used the Androssi, a race also created for the SCE series. A Time to Love/Hate used the Riker/Troi backstory established in Imzadi.\n\nTNG\n\nA Time to Be Born by John Vornholt\n\nA Time to Die by John Vornholt\n\nA Time to Sow by Dayton Ward and Kevin Dilmore\n\nA Time to Harvest by Dayton ward and Kevin Dilmore\n\nA Time to Love by Robert Greenberger\n\nA Time to Hate by Robert Greenberger\n\nA Time to Kill by David Mack\n\nA Time to Heal by David Mack\n\nA Time for War, a Time for Peace by Keith R.A.

DeCandido\n\nBefore Dishonor by Peter David\n\nGreater Than The Sum By Christopher L. Bennett\n\nDeath in Winter followed up on several Stargazer characters. Q&A crossed over into the New Frontier, Titan and IKS Gorkon continuities as well as referencing every book featuring Q to date. Before Dishonor referenced the short story \"Devices and Desires\" by Kevin Lauderdale and also served as a sequel to Vendetta.\n\nDestiny by David Mack\n\nGods of Night\n\nLost Souls\n\nMere Mortals\n\nTNG\n\nLosing The Peace By William Leisner\n\nTyphon Pact: Paths of Disharmony by Dayton Ward\n\nIndistinguishable From Magic By David A.

DeCandido--\n\nIncluded here as it continues the story of President Nanietta Bacco and her administration started in TNG's A Time for War, A Time for Peace.\n\nShip of the Line by Diane Carey established elements of Scotty's background that were later utilized in the SCE book, The Future Begins.\n\nSection 31: Rogue by Michael A. Martin and Andy Mangels was part of the Section 31 mini that tied into the post-finale DS9 books and introduced the character of Ranul Keru, who would eventually make his way briefly into the DS9 fiction before finding a home in the Titan series.\n\nGateways book three: Doors Into Chaos and the novella \"The Other Side\" by Robert Greenberger from Gateways book Seven: What Lay Beyond crossed directly into the post-finale DS9 and New Frontier series while crossing over with the entire lit-line at the time.\n\nImmortal Coil by Jeffrey Lang had a brief nod to the character of Ranul Keru, created for the Section 31 novel, Rogue, who later became a part of the crew of Titan. The Cold Equations trilogy by David Mack is a direct sequel to Immortal Coil.\n\nThe Battle of Betazed guest stars Elias Vaughn of the post-finale DS9 series. Certain events from this book are directly picked up in VOY: Old Wounds.\n\nDiplomatic Implausibility by KRAD established the crew of the IKS Gorkon, who would later be the stars of their own short-lived series. It also foreshadowed events yet to come in the post-finale DS9 series.\n\nThe Brave and the Bold book two, The Final Artifact\" also by KRAD, is a part of a story that connects to both the DS9 and Gorkon continuities.\n\nThe Buried Age by Christopher L. Bennett uses Q in a way that works with Q & A, and the Mabrae, a race established in TBA is later seen again in Christopher's Greater Than The Sum.\n\nDebtor's Planet by W.R. Thompson. Backstory for Ralph Offenhouse utilized in The Eugenics Wars: The Rise and Fall of Khan Noonian Singh.\n\nMere Anarchy collection\n\nA Sea of Troubles by J. Steven York and Christina F.

His TNG works include...\n\nStrike Zone\n\nPAD's first Trek novel ever laid a lot of ground and introduced a lot of plot elements that he would later revisit. The Selelvians would later become major players in New Frontier and the Kreel have most recently been mentioned as having been conquered by the Kinshaya, a race originally mentioned in John Ford's The Final Reflection and most recently, political players in the recently formed Typhon Pact as related in A Singular Destiny. This book also featured the first appearance the second generation security team of Meyers and Boyajin. This team would follow PAD into his DS9 book and into the New Frontier series.\n\nThe character of Kobry and the powerful Cognocenti were holdovers from PAD's original DC comics run on TOS at DC.\n\nA Rock and a Hard Place\n\nThe character of Quentin Stone is mentioned by name by Katerina Mueller in the story \"Performance Appraisal\" in the New Frontier anthology No Limits.\n\nVendetta\n\nThis novel began the beginning of PAD's development of the character Elizabeth Shelby and her captain, Morgan Korsmo, that would become part of her New Frontier backstory. The character of Korsmo was mentioned in the first New Frontier book as the previous Captain of the Starship Excalibur, and Korsmo appeared in that capacity in the story \"Making a Difference\" in No Limits.\n\nSeveral plot elements from Vendetta would later be picked up on in PAD's most recent TNG novel, Before Dishonor.\n\nImzadi and Imzadi 2: Triangle\n\nThe Riker/Troi backstory established in Imzadi would later be used in A Time to Love and A Time to Hate.\n\nImzadi 2 featured a cameo from Elizabeth Shelby in her role of first officer of the Excalibur under Korsmo.\n\nPAD's Q novels were all mentioned in Q & A. A Riker from an alternate future would view scenes from Q-in-Law in the Guardian of Forever in Imzadi.\n\nQ-in-Law\n\nQ-Squared\n\nI,Q (written with John DeLancie),\n\nHis Young Adult trilogy featuring Worf at Starfleet Academy introduced four characters that would all later become prominent players in the New Frontier series.\n\nWorf's First Adventure\n\nLine of Fire\n\nSurvival\n\nMichael Jan Friedman\n\nThree of MJF's TNG books are consistent with his Stargazer series in the depiction of the crew.

To accommodate this, the core-novels will be listed as either part of the \"Primary Core Continuity\" or the \"Secondary Core Continuity.\" The \"Primary core continuity\" is the \"main\" DS9 story, and the \"secondary core continuity\" are books and stories that aren't a part of the main story, but were released with deliberate connections to it.\n\nPrimary Core Continuity\n\nAvatar book one by S.D.

The Double Helix storyline crossed over directly with the New Frontier series and Stargazer continuities.\n\nSection 31: Shadow by Dean Wesley Smith and Kathryn Kristine Rusch was part of the Section 31 mini that spanned the lit-line.\n\nThe Badlands duology by Susan Wright features a Voyager tale set in the novel continuity.\n\nThe Brave and the Bold book two features a Voyager tale. the BatB ties directly into the post-finale DS9 books and the IKS Gorkon series.\n\nTales From the Captains Table featured the Captain Chakotay short story \"Seduced\" by Christie Golden.\n\nA Time for War, A Time for Peace by Keith R.A. DeCandido established the \"holographic Kahless\" made possible by classified emitter technology obtained by Voyager. Full Circle established that the tech was supplied to Kahless by Belanna Torres.\n\nTNG: Before Dishonor, by Peter David, guest starred Janeway and Seven of Nine and had major repercussions in the Voyager series.\n\nThe Destiny trilogy by David Mack featured appearances by several from Voyager characters and directly crossed-over with Full Circle.\n\nA Singular Destiny Keith R.A.

DeCandido that fits into the same mirror-continuity that has crossed into both the DS9 lit and the New Frontier series.\n\nMyriad Universes: Infinity's Prism featured the novel Places of Exile by Christopher L.

Swann that featured Archer and Porthos.\n\nMyriad Universes: Shards and Shadows includes the alternate universe Enterprise tale \"Noabunga\" by Dave Stern.\n\nEnterprise notes from Sci...\n\nThe post-finale ENT novels also feature United Earth Interior Minister Haroun al-Rashid and Andorian Ambassador Avaranthi sh'Rothress, both of whom were first established in Articles of the Federation as early Federation Presidents from the 22nd Century. As with Titan: Taking Wing, the ENT Relaunch also uses the long form of Romulan names and the Rihannsu language established in Duane's novels (as well as the Andorian genders and naming conventions established in the DS9 lit. --tt) .\n\nTGTMD and KM's establishing Nathan Samuels as United Earth Prime Minister places the ENT Relaunch in continuity with Tales of the Dominion War's \"Eleven Hours Out\" and with the Myriad Universes novel A Less Perfect Union. COE's mention of a United Earth President implies that United Earth has a republican parliamentary government, perhaps similar to, say, Ireland's or Italy's or Israel's.\n\nNew Frontier by Peter David\n\nThe New Frontier series, created by Peter David and John Ordover was the first book-only Trek series.

DeCandido\n\nConnections with other series\n\nNew Frontier has had two Captain's Table stories, one novel and one short story.\n\nTNG: The Q-Continuum trilogy was consistant with New Frontier continuity by acknowledging Dr. Selar's transfer to Excalibur.\n\nDouble Helix: Double or Nothing was a part of the Double Helix series that spanned the entire Trek-lit line. The main villain of the series was a Thallonian, a species developed for New Frontier, and The First Virtue had scene that featured Thallonians in Thallonian Space.\n\nGateways book six: Cold Wars and \"Death After Life\" from Gateways book seven: What Lay Beyond were a part of the Gateways crossover that spanned the Trek-lit line. Calhoun and Shelby also appeared briefly in the TNG and DS9 entries in the series. The Excalibur and crew appeared (sans Calhoun and Shelby) in the Gateways finale TNG: The Other Side by Robert Greenberger.\n\nTNG: Diplomatic Implausibility featured cameos via communications with Worf from Soleta, Kebron and McHenry.\n\nA Time to Kill made reference of the Danteri Empire.\n\nSCE: The Future Begins tied in with the New Frontier: Excalibur trilogy.\n\nDS9: Warpath featured a brief appearance by a Thallonian crewmember.\n\nTNG: Q&A featured cameos from Elizabeth Shelby on Space Station Bravo and Katerina Mueller on the Trident.\n\nThe Destiny trilogy and A Singular Destiny featured reports of Mackenzie Calhoun's Excalibur preparing for a suicide attack on a Borg Cube before finding a way to defeat it.\n\nSCE/CoE\n\nThe Starfleet Corps of Engineers series (later shorted to Core of Engineers) was a monthly e-book series focusing on the troubleshooting engineers of the USS DaVinci developed by Keith R. A, DeCandido and John Ordover.\n\nCrossovers\n\nThe series crossed over into the larger novel-verse in any number of ways including (but not limited to)...\n\nCold Fusion crossed directly into the post-finale DS9 works, taking place in between Avatar and Section 31: Rogue.\n\nHere There be Monsters served as an epilogue to the Gateways series that spanned the lit-line.\n\nInvincible introduced the Nalori, seen later in the Vanguard series.\n\nThe Foundations trilogy introduced the crew of the USS Lovell, who would go on to supporting roles in the Vanguard series.\n\nWar Stories featured the character of Janice Kersarus, from Diane Duane's \"Rihannsu-verse\" books.\n\nIshtar Rising referenced TOS: Twilight's End by Jerry Oltion.\n\nRing Around The Sky featured the legacy of The Furys established in the Invasion! mini.\n\nSmall World introduced the Koa, whom joined the Federation in Articles of the Federation.\n\nMalefictorum, Lost Time, and Wounds book one and two connect with the DS9 fiction circa Worlds of DS9.\n\nThings Past: Early Distant Warning served as a prologue to the Vanguard series.\n\nAppearances and mentions in other series\n\nCharacters created for SCE that became regulars in other series include Enterprise security chief Christine Vale-- who became a regular in both TNG and Titan lit, Da Vinci security officer Rennan Koyna-- who joined the Enterprise crew in Greater Than the Sum, and Da Vinci engineer Nancy Conlon-- who joined the Voyager crew in Full Circle.\n\nThe crew of the USS Lovell appeared in the Vanguard books Summon the Thunder, Reap the Whirlwind and Open Secrets.\n\nA young Lieutenant David Gold makes an appearance in Terok Nor: Night of the Wolves.\n\nA Time to... series makes mention of the DaVinci, her crew, and villains the Androssi in several of the books.\n\nThe Destiny trilogy mentions the crew of the Da Vinci saving a planet from the Borg by making it disappear.\n\nA Singular Destiny features appearances by Fabian Stevens and Dominica Corsi, as well giving general updates on several of the Da Vinci crew.\n\nIndistinguishable From Magic featured appearances by Sonya Gomez, Tev and the DaVinci.\n\nSCE short stories appeared in Tales from the Dominion War \"(Field Expediency\" by Dayton Ward and Kevin Dilmore) and Tales from the Captains Table (\"An Easy Fast\" by John Ordover).\n\nSci's SCE notes...\n\n\"COE ties into other novels in numerous ways, including tie-ins to NF and Vulcan's Noun's two seemingly contradictory depictions of Scotty's post-\"Relics\" life in The Future Begins, and references to the Romulan War-era United Earth President Lydia Littlejohn, the Palais de la Concorde and Zife Administration, and to the events of Prime Directive by Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens all in that same entry. Given Prime Directive's contradictory depiction of the Federation Council and Federation President, presumably only the main story of PD is kept (in the same way that you describe the detail of Alyssa's child changing between Genesis Wave and Titan.)\"\n\nSteve Mollmann's notes for The Future Begins...\n\n\"As far as references in tFB to things that aren't political minutia (but rather other minutia), the Scotty backstory for the book also draws from Michael Jan Friedman's Crossover, Gene DeWeese's Engines of Destiny, Julia Ecklar's The Kobayashi Maru, and Diane Carey's Ship of the Line. Several short stories also factor in, such as \"Out of Time\" (DC's 1994 TNG special), \"Old Debts\" (DC's 1995 TNG special), \"Dorian's Diary\" (SNWIII), \"Ancient History\" (SNWVI), \"Bum Radish: Five Spins on a Turquoise Reindeer\" (SNWVI), \"Full Circle\" (SNWVII), \"Safe Harbors\" (Tales of the Dominion War), and \"Through the Looking Glass\" (No Limits). Note however, that \"Old Debts\" has Scotty meeting Robin Lefler in 2371 (which is inconsistent with the NF: eXcalibur trilogy... and tFB itself!) and that \"Full Circle\" got a sequel in SNW09 that is inconsistent with tFB. It also references ideas originally put forth in Spectre, which is of course part of the \"Shatnerverse\" continuity. And \"Out of Time\" and \"Ancient History\" are mutually inconsistent.\n\ntFB also has off-handed references to a number of other stories, usually in the form of alien species or planets. These include the Blood from the New Earth miniseries, the Azziz from \"The Music Between the Notes\" (in The Lives of Dax), Xaraka XII and galaxy Telpha-Z from the Gold Key comics, the Hamalki and the Deirr from Diane Duane's various novels, Mythra from Mission to Horatius, and the Withiki from the oft-referenced The Final Reflection. Among others. Other references include Dana Kramer-Rolls's Home is the Hunter, L.A. Graf's Traitor Winds, the Pellegrino/Zebrowski Dyson Sphere, Brad Ferguson's Crisis on Centaurus, the fanon technical manual Starfleet Prototype, and the Unlimited comic story \"None but the Brave\".\n\nOf course, referencing the Gold Key comics is infinitely problematic. Traitor Winds ties into the various other \"Lost Years\" stories: The Lost Years, A Flag Full of Stars, and Recovery. Kirk's home on Crisis on Centaurus is brought up again in Time for Yesterday.\n\nThe Eugenics Wars gives a description for the Khanate's flag that is borrowed from Section 31: Abyss. It also references the Dayton Ward short story \"The Aliens are Coming!\" in one of the early SNW volumes. Conversely, A Time to Sow referenced a Greg Cox short story, \"Bedside Matters\" in The Amazing Stories.\n\nAnnotations\n\nChristopher L.
