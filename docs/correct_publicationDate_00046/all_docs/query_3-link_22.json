        "text": "Pop culture continues to find new and innovative ways to plant itself on the web and two of our contributors, Aaron Rosenberg and Bob Greenberger, along with fellow novelist Steven Savile, are trying something new. ReDeus is a new fictional world that will come to life on the Internet as a subscription-based site that will offer, for starters, three serialized stories set in a shared world. Not only that, they’re fundraising in an unusual way too, through Kickstarter. We wanted to know more, so we digitally sat down with the three for a conversation.\n\nComicMix: Where’d the idea for ReDeus come from?\n\nSteven Savile: I was actually invited to the party after Aaron and Bob had already come up with the core concept of the gods and monsters returning, so it’s best I let them field this particular question.\n\nAaron Rosenberg: Me, it was all me! :)\n\nNo, seriously, it was Bob, our friend Paul, and I. We’d been talking about the economy, and writing projects, and the changing face of publishing, and we agreed that we needed to find new ways to get stories out to our audience. I had an idea about putting things up on the Internet, and Bob and Paul both liked the notion, so we ran with it. Then we started talking about the kind of world we’d want to build, something cool and unique and interesting with enough room for all of us to tell stories and then some. We all agreed that near-future was the way to go, and then the question was “how is it different from today? What changed?” I don’t remember which of us came up with “the gods were all real—and they’ve returned!” but the minute it was stated all three of us said “YES!!!” And we took it from there. Paul had to bow out, unfortunately, but Bob and I both already knew Steve and were already working with him on some other projects, so we approached him and he was happy to step in.\n\nBob Greenberger: Basically we had to forgo one Jew with a beard for a Swede with a beard. We think it’s an upgrade.\n\nCMix: Why three writers rather than one of you?\n\nSavile: Personally, I love the collective aspect of it. Writing is by necessity a lonely business but there is something very gratifying about the act of collaboration, the idea that what comes out of all three of us together is greater than what might emerge from my mind alone, or Bob’s or Aaron’s, plus it is an absolute delight to learn from these guys. They’re not only great people, they’re great friends, and how often in this life do we get to work with real friends? Not often enough would be my answer.\n\nRosenberg: Two reasons, really. First, the world is just so much richer for the three of us. I can come up with a world on my own—I’ve done it enough times—but that means it’s all from my perspective, my style, my tone. With three of us, one of us will come up with something and one of the others will say “Hm, that’s cool, but what if we do this to it?” and it’s something the first person never thought of but it makes everything that much better. We really build off each other’s creativity, crafting a setting that’s more complicated, more engaging, more exciting than any of us would have had alone.\n\nThe other reason is the scope of the project. Putting up a new piece of content every single day—if any one of us were to do this, he’d run himself ragged. With three of us, we can split that up. Each of us writes one storyline. Each of us handles one type of additional content. It becomes more manageable. And you get materials from three different viewpoints.\n\nGreenberger: I love collaboration and brainstorming so have a blank slate and starting to fill it in is very exciting. This is a huge concept worthy of deeper exploration, which three can do better than one. Who knows, maybe it will grow from there and more will be invited to come explore with us?\n\n(more…)\n\nJames Marsters has been added to the cast of the pilot remake of Hawaii Five-0 for CBS, portraying a villain. He told Australia’s Herald Sun, “They saw me in a fight sequence and something about it made them think ‘Let’s keep him around for a little bit’. I’m like a poor man’s Jackie Chan. But I have to say of all of the pilots that I knew about this year, this one stands the best chance of actually making it to the light of day. So I’m pretty hopeful.”\n\nPop culture reinventors Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci wrote the pilot for showrunner Peter Lenkov. The series picks up from the original by focusing on Chris McGarrett, son of Steve McGarrett (Jack Lord). Casting includes Alex O’Loughlin as Chris, Lost veteran Daniel Dae Kim as Chin Ho Kelly and Battlestar Galactica’s Grace Park as Kono Kalakaua. The remake is likely to make the 2010-2011 prime time schedule, although formal announcements are not expected until mid-May.\n\nMarsters, who appeared with Kim in Angel, reflected on constantly being cast as the heavy. “I think frankly it’s because I got known for a villain early on,” he told the paper. “When I first came to LA, the only job on TV I’d had was as a very nerdish priest on Northern Exposure. I really lucked into that role. I was actually playing a killer on stage at the time for John Pielmeier who wrote Agnes of God, but I just happened to score this priest role on Northern Exposure.\n\n“So when I came down to LA the only thing I had on my reel was this nerd character, so I got put up for a bunch of nerds. I scored a couple of guest spots as people who were uncomfortable in their own skin. Then Buffy was looking for somebody at the last minute, and I don’t know why but they thought I could do accents, so they called me in. And I lucked into that role, and ever since everyone thinks of me as a villain. So, I’ll take it man. The villain is a good role.\n\n“Cos when you’re a villain, you’re standing in the shadows, not having to do much, then when the hero walks by you pop him a couple of times, big music sounds, and you go home. Whereas if you’re the hero, you have to have long scenes with guilt, and you have to be running around all night sweating, and then at the very end of the night you get popped in the face by the villain, who looks cool and gets all the credit.”\n\n(more…)\n\nWhen the BBC series [[[Merlin]]] debuted two years ago, it was quickly described as a British version of [[[Smallville]]], that is a reimagining of the classic tale skewed towards teen characters for a more mass audience.\n\nThe difference, though, is that when Smallville debuted nine seasons ago, it was one of the sharpest written series on the air. The messages conveyed through dialogue, the foreshadowing, and rich experience of watching Clark Kent master his powers was slowly revealed.\n\nMerlin, which aired in America on NBC last summer and returns this summer on SyFy, has had poor writing and lazy character development. The first season is released as a five disc DVD set on Tuesday and you can decide for yourself how palatable this look at the Arthurian legend is.\n\nRather than a Merlin who ages backward, this teen is a bit of a doofus, prone to gaffes but is a loyal and steadfast friend to the court. At a time when Uther Pendragon has forbidden the use of magic, Merlin comes to the court to train under Gaius, the King’s physician. As a result, every episode involves him using magic at great risk, and every episode has him learning some valuable lesson.\n\nTo be kind, the series has been very liberal in its interpretation of the characters with most being recognizable in name only. In addition to goofus Merlin, there’s gallant Arthur (Bradley James), the apple of Uther’s eye and being trained to succeed the king. He’s a callow youth only now beginning to understand the gravity of his destiny thanks to Merlin. Then there’s Guinevere (Angel Coulby), a peasant’s daughter and handmaiden to Morgana (Katie McGrath), a ward of the king and herself trying to comprehend the magic growing within her. Of course, Merlin likes Gwen, Gwen likes Arthur and Arthur likes himself. It’s complicated.\n\nIn addition to Gaius (Richard Wilson) being new to the story, there’s the chained dragon Kilgharrah, who seems to know Merlin’s destiny and provides counsel. Often, Merlin ignores it and makes the dragon, voiced by John Hurt, cry mournfully.\n\nThese thirteen episodes are largely repetitive as one or another gets into trouble, the others rally to his/her defense, Merlin does good but often pays for it in comical ways. There’s very little in the way of true danger or variety making the season a tedious one. Word is, the second season is far stronger, but they’re already lost me.\n\nThe cast, headed by Colin Morgan, is an attractive one and several guest stars could have enriched the show, starting with Michelle Ryan’s witch Nimueh. No doubt they’d all be more interesting to watch if they had good storylines or dialogue. Anthony Stewart Head is wasted as Uther, given a largely one-dimension bastard of a character to play. When his reasons for banning magic are revealed, it makes sense, but makes us sympathize with him no more.\n\nAll the tropes from [[[Excalibur]]] to [[[Mordred]]] are present, foreshadowing the legendary times ahead, all adapted in vaguely recognizable ways.\n\nThe episodes are accompanied by two making-of featurettes adding up to over an hour of information on the cast and the production. A 16 minute featurette also explores the episode focusing on the Black Knight in addition to a photo gallery, wallpapers, and a set of video diaries which are mildly amusing.\n\n(more…)\n\nWhile Pocket Books’ publishing program has to avoid the five year mission era of Captain Kirk and the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise until 2012 when the second film from J.J. Abrams is released, that doesn’t mean there won’t be stories set in the original universe.\n\nStar Trek: Vanguard, a novel series conceived by former editor Marco Palmieri and writer David Alan Mack in 2005, continues to tell stories during that fertile period for the United Federation of Planets and this week it has been confirmed that the series will continue with the just announced Star Trek: Vanguard – Declassified.\n\n“This is an idea David and I hatched a few months ago, which was eagerly accepted by our editor at Pocket, Jaime Costas,” Dayton Ward wrote on his website.\n\nVanguard tells of the Taurus Reach, a sector of space near the Tholian border and where powerful alien artifacts speak of a once-powerful race that ruled that portion of the galaxy. The UFP is fully exploring it and has built Starbase 47 as its base of operations but such a large establishment has piqued the curiosity of the Klingons and Romulans. Over the course of the five novels to date, the sprawling story and large cast of characters have learned many secrets and work to preserve the galactic peace.\n\n“The plan is for this collection to be released in mass-market paperback, and indeed count as the sixth book in the current series. Each novella will feature one or more of the series’ rather large cast, with tales spanning the length of Operation Vanguard from inception right up to and perhaps even past the events of the fifth book, Precipice. Further, these aren’t intended to be throwaway tales, but will be considered integral parts of the storyline and may also even set up situations for the series’ next novel-length installments. To be honest, we’re in the midst of figuring out a lot of that as I write this. Any or all of what I just typed could change, depending on where any unhinged brainstorming takes us.\n\n“’Wait,’ I can hear you saying out there in the audience, “who the hell is we?” I’m glad you asked. The four novellas will be written by Kevin Dilmore, David Mack, Marco Palmieri, and me.”\n\nThe series to date has included the 2005 inaugural novel, Harbinger (Mack) along with Summon the Thunder (Ward & Dilmore), Reap the Whirlwind (Mack), Open Secrets (Ward) and Precipice (Mack). There was also a prequel of sorts in the eBook Distant Early Warning – Star Trek: SCE. #64 (Ward & Dilmore). Declassified is expected for release sometime in 2011.\n\n(more…)"
