        "text": "My First novel to jump in is Destiny: Gods of Night by David Mack, I understand this to be a good jumping in point, still there's things I've Obviously Missed. I know Riker is on the Titan and this Happens Post nemesis, but Picard and Crusher Married did this happen in another novel?\n\nPicard and Crusher finally got over themselves and began a relationship in 2005's TNG: Death in Winter by Michael Jean Friedman. 2008's TNG: Greater than the Sum by Christopher L. Bennett, which was published the month immediately before Destiny: Gods of Night, establishes that they decided to tie the knot in between Greater and its immediate predecessor, TNG: Before Dishonor by Peter David (2007). Over the course of Greater than the Sum, Picard and Crusher agree to conceive a child, and Crusher is pregnant by novel's end.\n\nAnd the weapons the Enterprise uses to destroy the Borg where were they obtained?\n\nThe transphasic torpedoes were established in VOY's series finale, \"Endgame, Parts I & II\" (2001). They are based on technology brought to the present from an alternate timeline's 25th Century, in which the U.S.S. Voyager did not return from the Delta Quadrant in 2377.\n\nI figure after all the Destiny Novels to move onto the Typhon Pact Series and then the Cold Equations series is this a good Plan?\n\nWell, Trelit series kind of go in different directions after that. The Star Trek: Voyager and Star Trek: Titan series go off and have the U.S.S. Voyager and U.S.S. Titan go on long-range exploration missions to the Delta and Beta Quadrants, respectively, and they're separated enough that they're not as much affected by developments back in the Federation.\n\nIf you're looking for a more TNG/DSN bent, then after finishing Destiny, I would recommend reading in this order:\n\nTNG: Losing the Peace by William Leisner (2009)\n\nStar Trek: A Singular Destiny by Keith R.A. DeCandido (2009)\n\nTyphon Pact: Zero Sum Game by David Mack (2010)\n\nTyphon Pact: Rough Beasts of Empire by David R. George III (2011)\n\nTyphon Pact: Paths of Disharmony by Dayton Ward (2011)\n\nTNG: Indistinguishable from Magic by David A. McIntee (2011)\n\nTyphon Pact: The Struggle Within by Christopher L. Bennett (2011)\n\nTyphon Pact: Plagues of Night by David R. George III (2012)\n\nTyphon Pact: Raise the Dawn by David R. George III (2012)\n\nTyphon Pact: Brinkmanship by Una McCormack (2012)\n\nTNG: Cold Equations: The Persistence of Memory by David Mack (2012)\n\nTNG: Cold Equations: Silent Weapons by David Mack (2012)\n\nTNG: Cold Equations: The Body Electric by David Mack (2012)\n\nIf you're interested in VOY, I'd recommend reading Kirsten Beyer's novels after Destiny:\n\nVOY: Full Circle (2009)\n\nVOY: Unworthy (2009)\n\nVOY: Children of the Storm (2011)\n\nVOY: The Eternal Tide (2012)\n\nThe TTN novels set after Destiny are:\n\nTTN: Over a Torrent Sea by Christopher L. Bennett (2009)\n\nTTN: Synthesis by James Swallow (2009)\n\nTyphon Pact: Seize the Fire by Michael A. Martin (2010)\n\nTTN: Fallen Gods by Michael A. Martin (2012)\n\nIf you enjoyed Destiny, I would also recommend that you pick up David Mack's Mirror Universe novels:\n\nThe Sorrows of Empire (2007; expanded edition 2010)\n\nRise Like Lions (2011)\n\nYou may also enjoy the Star Trek: Vanguard series. Set during the TOS era, they are:\n\n- VAN: Harbinger by David Mack (2005)\n\n- VAN: Summon the Thunder by Dayton Ward and Kevin Dilmore (2006)\n\n- VAN: Reap the Whirlwind by David Mack (2007)\n\n- VAN: Open Secrets by Dayton Ward (2009)\n\n- VAN: Precipice by David Mack (2009)\n\n- VAN: Declassified anthology (2011)\n\n- Almost Tomorrow by Dayton Ward\n\n- Hard News by Kevin Dilmore\n\n- The Ruins of Noble Men by Marco Palmieri\n\n- The Stars Look Down by David Mackâ€‹\n\n- VAN: What Judgments Come by Dayton Ward and Kevin Dilmore (2011)\n\n- VAN: Storming Heaven by David Mack (2012)\n\nIf you enjoyed Destiny, I would also recommend that you pick up David Mack's Mirror Universe novels:\n\nThe Sorrows of Empire (2007; expanded edition 2010)\n\nRise Like Lions (2011)\n\nYou could easily enjoy just those two novels with no problem, but they are actually part of a longer MU series. The other books in the series are three anthologies:\n\n*Glass Empires, which contains three short novels:\n\nENT: Age of the Empress (this picks up right after the end of ENT MU two parter and continues that story)\n\n*TOS: Sorrows of Empire (this story was expanded into a separate full length novel mentioned by Sci)\n\nTNG: The Worst of Both Worlds (follows Picard and Vash with appearances by a few other familiar faces)\n\n*Obsidian Alliances:\n\nVOY: The Mirror Scaled Serpent (the first MU appearances by the Voyager characters)\n\nDS9: Saturn's Children (fills in the gaps between the last DS9 MU TV episode and another novel)\n\nNF: Cutting Ties (the first appearance of the MU versions of the NF characters)\n\n*Shards and Shadows: A collection of 12 short stories which continues some of the stories from the previous collections, features the first MU stories for Titan, Stargazer, Capt. April's Enterprise crew, and Vanguard, and a couple of stories that don't really fall into one series."
