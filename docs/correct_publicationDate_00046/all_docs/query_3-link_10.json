For original audio books, in-universe references, picture books, photo comics, and fictional retrospectives, see List of Star Trek tie-in fiction.\n\nThe Star Trek franchise's first tie-in publications were James Blish's 1967 volume of episode novelizations and Mack Reynolds's 1968 young adult novel Mission to Horatius.[1] Since 1968, more than 850 original novels, short story collections, episode and film novelizations, and omnibus editions have been published.\n\nNovels based on Star Trek, The Next Generation, Discovery, and Picard are currently in print. As recently as 2020, novels based on Deep Space Nine, Enterprise, and Voyager were published. Original concept and flagship series such as New Frontier, Titan, Seekers, and Vanguard have also been published since 1994.\n\nOfficial publishers of Star Trek novels include Simon & Schuster and U.K. publisher Titan Books. Bantam Books published novels from 1967 to 1981. Past publishers include: Western Publishing, Random House imprints Ballantine and Del Rey Books, Science Fiction Book Club.[1][2] Publishers Heyne and Cross Cult publish German-language translations of Star Trek novels.\n\nIn 2001, Pocket Books estimated there were 85 million copies in print.[3] Michael Epstein, writing for Television Quarterly in 1996, said Star Trek was \"by far the biggest series of fiction in the history of western literature\".[4]\n\nKey: All novels published as paperback editions, except where indicated. †\n\nHardcover first edition\n\n^\n\nChildren's or young adult book\n\n◊\n\nPublished as an ebook exclusive\n\n‡\n\nIncluded in omnibus or collection\n\n#\n\nPublished as a numbered novel\n\n≈\n\nVariant or retitled novel\n\nTeal\n\nBook line or flagship series name\n\nNavy\n\nMiniseries name\n\nPink\n\nCrossover series name\n\ned.\n\nOmnibus or collection editor(s).\n\net al.\n\nMultiple authors, see note\n\nMain article: Star Trek (Bantam Books)\n\nBantam Books was the first licensed publisher of Star Trek tie-in fiction. Bantam published all their novels as mass market paperbacks. Bantam also published Star Trek Lives! (1975) by Jacqueline Lichtenberg.\n\nShort story adaptations of The Original Series episodes written by James Blish and J. A. Lawrence. Mudd's Angels (1978) includes the novelizations of \"Mudd's Women\" and \"I, Mudd\", and an original novella by Lawrence. The Day of the Dove (1985) is a variant of Star Trek 11 (1975). Mudd's Enterprise (1994) is a variant of Mudd's Angels.\n\nFor the photo comics adaptations of The Original Series episodes, see List of Star Trek tie-in fiction § Star Trek Fotonovels.\n\nTitle Author(s) Date Catalog / ISBN Star Trek 1 [I] James Blish January 1967 F3459 Star Trek 2 February 1968 F3439 Star Trek 3 April 1969 F4371 Star Trek 4 July 1971 S7009 Star Trek 5 February 1972 S7300 Star Trek 6 April 1972 S7364 Star Trek 7 July 1972 S7480 Star Trek 8 November 1972 SP7550 Star Trek 9 August 1973 SP7808 Star Trek 10 February 1974 SP8401 Star Trek 11 [II] April 1975 Q8717 Star Trek 12 James Blish and J.

The novels are not numbered; however, library catalogs and booksellers applied numbers to the novels in publication order, including Mudd's Angels and The New Voyages. In 1993, the series was reprinted by Titan Books as Star Trek Adventures using a different number scheme.[5] The name given to the reprint series has been retroactively applied to Bantam's series by book discovery websites such as Goodreads and LibraryThing.\n\nFurther information: § Star Trek Adventures reprints\n\nNo. Title Author(s) Date Catalog / ISBN 1 Spock Must Die!
