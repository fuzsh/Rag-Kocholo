        "text": "Flesh and Stone, medical crossover on the way from IDW\n\nThere's something special on the way from IDW in July, a new one-shot crossover comic, featuring all the regular doctors from all five Star Trek TV series! Here's how StarTrek.com describe the forthcoming adventure, Flesh and Stone:\n\nWhen a lethal metamorphic virus strikes a Starfleet medical conference, Doctors Beverly Crusher, Julian Bashir Katherine Pulaski and the EMH join forces -- with assists from Dr. Leonard McCoy and Dr. Phlox -- to save the day.\n\nThis crossover is happening with the support Qualcomm Tricorder XPRIZE, who are promoting their competition to encourage the development of a real-world tricorder-like device. As XPRIZE's Rob Hollander, told StarTrek.com:\n\nWhile XPRIZE is currently catalyzing a future where a Tricorder-like device is a common household item, we are thrilled to have inspired this parallel Star Trek story centered around the use of the Tricorder, further blurring the line between science fiction and reality.\n\nThe story will be written by IDW regulars Scott and David Tipton, with art by the Sharp Brothers, who also produced the cover. Scott Tipton commented on the comic:\n\nThere aren’t very many ‘firsts’ left in the world of Star Trek, so when IDW and XPRIZE came to us with the opportunity to team up all six of Trek’s doctors for the first time, how could we say no? The tricky part is how to get them together, since some of them are separated by about two hundred years. How does it happen? You’ll just have to wait and see…\n\nThat's not the only first here. If I'm not forgetting something, it's not just doctors; this will be the first comic to feature all five TV series, and indeed the first to feature Enterprise characters for (presumably) more than a single panel!\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nDrex Files: NX-01, Enterprise class\n\nEnterprise NX-01, rendered by Rob Bonchune.\n\nFor the second instalment of the Drex Files in Exile I thought it fitting to have a good look at what is perhaps Doug Drexler's most significant contribution to the world of Star Trek, his great starship design, the NX-01. This file gives us a good look at the final NX-01 model, built by Pierre Drolet, with Doug guiding us through some of the details via orthographic views produced by Eden FX. So here's Doug on the NX-01:\n\nI had a field day detailing out the NX, and every nook and cranny is accounted for. Pierre Drolet did an incredible job implementing them in this high rez build.\n\nI added details that I hoped would allow for cool ideas later on, if and when the opportunities presented themselves. But I had to be cautious about obvious details to the ship that were not approved, because they could get me into trouble. Yes, The chain of command was heavy on Enterprise. Herman Zimmerman, our stalwart production designer was once balled out because I labeled a nacelle as a nacelle on a framed blueprint in the drydock observation room. He was told that it wasn’t a nacelle until the front office said it was. So I tucked gear behind doors and hatches, and then wrote up notes “suggesting” the vessels potential.\n\nThe dedication plaque refers to the class as NX (This was a request from on high), but according to naval tradition, the first ship of a new contract is what the class is named, so Enterprise class. My main mission was to inject as much of the original Enterprise into this ship as I possibly could, and I made sure that the basic dynamic between the saucer and the nacelles was the same. To a person with a sharp eye, the NX-01 is loaded with TOS Easter eggs\n\nThis is an unusual render of the Enterprise in that there is a lot of ambient light. It really shows off the panel detailing. Like Andy’s “D”, every panel was designed and fitted painstakingly to the function and form of the ship. All sections have their own distinct personality and are not simply cloned and repeated. It was designed by someone who full well knows how close you guys like to look, because I’m one of you. Something you probably never heard before, is that the nacelle struts were originally much finer, like the TOS ship. Dan Curry thought that they didn’t look like they could support the nacelles, and that it looked silly. All due respect to Dan, but that is one of the things I loved about the TOS ship. It suggested a technology beyond our own. On the original show, the nacelles defied gravity. I was sorry when the TMP shp heavied them up. Don’t get me wrong, it still looks great. Just not what I wanted for the NX. Ok… look at the struts, notice that there is a tapered fairing on the leading edge. Those were the original struts, well… a little heavier than that. A third more. But everything behind that was add on. I emphasized that front fairing so that in some light conditions it would be all you would see, and feel more like my beloved TOS Enterprise.\n\nContinue after the jump for many more views of the NX-01, and more of Doug's notes on the design:\n\nHere is nearly the same angle but with the ambient turned down, the the key turned up, and a bigger lens. Notice how the larger lens stacks things up a bit, and flattens them out. These lighting conditions push the plate detail back, and emphasize the ship’s self light and luminosity. Truth be told, the fronts of the bussard collectors are too red and lazy for my taste. I would have pushed to the orange side and had a much more volatile and seething kinetic look there like TOS. It was not to the taste of our bosses. I found (and all due respect), that during the Berman years, anything brassy, meaning what they perceived as loud, was pushed into the background. The musical score became wallpaper, and colors were desaturated. One day I came into the living room, and Enterprise was on… Hey! What’s wrong with the TV? There’s no color!… Then someone walked onto the scene in the blue uniform. Oh! The color IS on! It’s just that Enterprise was shot in all blues and greys. Very monochromatic. Anything colorful was crushed out of the picture.\n\nHere again is nearly the same shot with a lot of ambient light, and no clear key. I wish that the brightness of the ship had been a little more like this, closer to… you guessed it, the original Enterprise. The NX appeared dark and dingy on actual show. Against space it was often hard to see. Not to my taste. An Enterprise should not be pushed into the background, it should show boldly. It’s gallant and bright, and wears a white hat. But that was all part of the Berman look. If it stood out too much it was pushed back. the logic was that this would bring the characters to the forefront. I understood, but did not subscribe to that theory, although it was an interesting one.\n\nFrom the above view you can clearly see the original nacelle pylons. they would have extended a bit on the Z axis, but would not have encroached upon the aft impulse engines. One thing that I would have loved to have seen were those square cargo doors on top and bottom of the saucer open. That would have created a zero G tunnel though the ship. Catgo containers would be floated into the tunnel, then pushed onto receiving decks where they would be processed and stowed in fitted wells.\n\nIf you examine the saucer inpulse engines mounted in those prominent notches at the back of the saucer, you will see that if you took just the aft half of the exhaust cone, and pushed the stbd and port pieces together, you would have the TOS impulse cone. Another fun reflected detail is the airport style control tower dome at the back of the saucer. I don’t think an Enterprise is an Enterprise without that. The boys who designed the original ship came from an aviation background, and that is a prominent feature on the that ship. The top obs dome is primarily a command center for supervising the frequent engine tear downs the ship should have experienced while deployed. The bottom dome would have served a similar function, but would have had a secondary function as flight control for the shuttle pod drop bays. The top and bottom dome would be connected by a tunnel containing a ladder and a small lift, similar to the lift in engineering. The gravity orientation in the bottom dome is inverted, so anyone in there would be standing upside down in relation to the rest of the ship. Another interesting note is that the lower sensor dome was lifted intact from the TOS Enterprise.\n\nSpeaking of lifted intact, the forward deflector dish is the dish from the original Enterprise, squeezed on the Y axis. Another carryover finger print is that the nacelle pylons when seen from the front, do not line up with the centerline of the nacelles. The pylons insert into the bottom of the nacelles, just like you-know-what.\n\nOn the original Enterprise, the ends of the nacelles with their hooded cones suggested exhaust. That was remedied by adding spheres. That was a cool solution, suggested a different technology, and did away with the possibility of thrust coming from them. I kept that for the ends of the NX nacelles, but split the sphere in two. Now Dea, cover your ears. If the fronts of the nacelles look like penises, I compounded that by making the ends of the NX nacelles look like a girls butt in a thong. I thought that was fair.\n\nHere are a few more beauty shots of the Enterprise, rendered by Doug:\n\nIn future posts we'll take a closer look at some of the details on the Enterprise, as well as Doug's refit design, a look at the interiors, and much more. You can find a lot of that already in Doug's NX-01 gallery on Facebook; one of many albums highlight his work and love of Star Trek. And for more of the Drex Files in Exile, check out my index page to find listings of previous reports.\n\n↧\n\nQ drops in on nuTrek, and other comics news\n\nJuly is looking like it's going to be pretty exciting for Star Trek comics. io9 have announced issue thirty-five of the nuTrek ongoing series will be the first in a six part story featuring Q! io9 spoke to the series' writer, Mike Johnson, about The Q Gambit, who revealed a few details about the story, including what it is that draws Q to the new timeline:\n\nAt first: curiosity. A beloved Trek character from the original timeline makes a cameo appearance at the beginning of the story (issue #35) and tries to convince Q to leave the new timeline alone. But Q can't resist a new sandbox to play in and cool new toys to play with: toys like Kirk, Spock and the rest of the Enterprise crew. Ultimately we'll learn that there is something unique to the new timeline that affects Q directly, although he would rather the humans not know what it is.\n\nJohnson also revealed that this will take place at the leading edge of Q's personal timeline, so all the Q adventures we already known from the prime-timeline have already occured from his point of view. Johnson also talked a little about Q's take on nuKirk and Spock:\n\nQ is intrigued by Kirk's refusal to accept no-win scenarios. It drives him a little crazy, actually. Spock is more of a puzzle for Q given that he is only half-human. For Kirk and Spock, Q presents a challenge on an order of magnitude beyond what they've encountered in their still-young careers. Nero and Khan were dangerous, but neither had control over space and time the way Q does.\n\nUPDATE: StarTrek.com have now posted about this too, and their summary seems to suggest even more crossover in this series:\n\n...the mischievous Q sends James T. Kirk on a quest that will witness the Enterprise joining forces with familiar faces from Trek lore, beginning with the crew of a very familiar space station.\n\nSo there's only really one \"very familiar space station\" in Star Trek, Deep Space 9 (sorry Vanguard). With six issues to play with, could we be seeing Q take the nuTrek crew into crossovers with each of the other Trek series? (I've no inside information, just speculating.)\n\nStarTrek.com also confirm the new-to-Trek artist credited on the cover is Tony Shasteen, who's previous credits include Batman and Vampire Diaries comics.\n\nAlso recently announced for July is the first ever all prime-series crossover comic, Flesh and Stone, which IDW have now posted a slightly longer description of in their press release:\n\nStar Trek Special: Flesh and Stone, written by longtimeStar Trek scribes Scott and David Tipton, takes place at a Starfleet medical conference, which is crashed by a deadly metamorphic virus. The EMH and Doctors Beverly Crusher, Julian Bashir and Katherine Pulaski (with some help from Leonard McCoy and Phlox) join forces in a race against time to find a cure - only to discover that the answers lie in another place and time! The clock is ticking and only the medical officers of Starfleet can save the day.\n\nAnd as if that's not enough excitement for one month, July will also see the release of issue two in John Byrne's New Visions photo-comic series. Byrne recently posted a few panels from that issue on his forums:\n\nOne of the little things I've started doing -- part of the whole \"characters appearing even tho they don't have dialog -- is spotting various guest stars into the backgrounds. People who played a character on one episode, and then were gone. For instance, in the second issue is a short backup that has a three panel appearance by Marla Magivers. It takes place before the Khan story, so I figured she'd be wandering around somewhere!\n\nChris Ryall also recently posted a preview from one of the photo-comics on his blog. This page has a different sort a guest star, with Gabriel Rodriguez, the artist of IDW's Lock and Key series, appearing:\n\nBack on Byrne's forums, Byrne also gave some details on the eventual omnibus edition of the New Visions comics: The first omnibus will contain three of the double-length issues, including the first photo-comic, which was released as a stand-alone annual. That issue is also set for a reprint to coincide with the publication of issue one of the ongoing series, and will have a rebranded cover, putting under the New Visions banner.\n\n↧\n\nA closer look at Hallmark's 2014 Star Trek Keepsake ornaments\n\nHallmark have released their 2014 \"Dreambook\", their catalogue of Keepsake Christmas tree ornaments. Following the same format of the past few years, there are three Star Trek decorations this year: A starship, with light effects, which this year is the USS Vengeance. A figurine in the Star Trek Legends series, with Mr Sulu joining the crew this time. And a TOS diorama with sound effects, which this time depicts Spock and the Horta from The Devil in the Dark. Here's the Star Trek page from the Dreambook:\n\nHallmark have also, already, put up the product pages for each ornament on their website. The Vengeance and Sulu pages include new big images of both. The Horta scene doesn't yet have a new photo, instead using the old concept art, but you can hear the soundclip the ornament will play if you visit the page. Here are the images of the other two; doesn't the Vengeance look amazing!\n\n↧\n\nBook bits: Ships of the Line 2, and pop-ups!\n\nIt's an all \"non-fiction\" books news today. Starting with exciting news that there's a second Ships of the Line book on the way! StarTrek.com have announced a new hardcover book will collect just about all the images from the Ships of the Line calendar series, including al those previously published in the first Ships of the Line book back in 2006, plus an additional seventy-five images from calendars since then. Doug Drexler and Margaret Clark will be returning to edit, with text commentary from Michael Okuda.\n\nThe newly expanded book is due out in October, which I think makes it very likely this is the recent mysterious Untitled Star Trek book which has appeared in listings.\n\nIf pages and pages of pretty starships in plain old 2D just aren't exciting enough for you, then you'll be pleased to know the new Star Trek Pop-Ups book will be following in November. The book will be written by Star Trek regulars Paula M. Block and Terry J. Erdmann, with pop-up art by Courtney Watson McCarthy. Amazon have now released a cover for this one, which features the TOS movie-era Enterprise. But fear not, the book is set to feature pop-ups from across the franchise, including Borg, Klingons, and Captain Proton!\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nLatest Starships Collection details\n\nA few bits of news from The Official Starships Collection: Starting with the latest previews from StarTrek.com, who have posted new images and descriptions of the models and magazines coming as issues twenty and twenty-one, the Klingon Vor'cha class, and the USS Enterprise-E:\n\nThe die-cast model is carefully based on the original studio model, and carries the original TNG paint scheme rather than the more colorful version that was used when the ship appeared on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. The accompanying magazine looks at how Rick Sternbach redesigned the classic Klingon battle cruiser for the 1990s and explores the writing staff’s plan to reinvent the Klingons as a cross between Viking and Samurai warriors.\n\nEvery time this Enterprise appeared there were subtle differences and the die-cast model is based on the CG version of the ship that was created for Star Trek: Insurrection. The accompanying magazine takes a look at John Eaves’ original design concepts and the complicated history of the physical and CG models that were used onscreen.\n\nThe Collection's website has also been updated recently, with a new images revealing the Vor'cha cover:\n\nStarTrek.com also recently announced the next country The Collection will be launching in will be Japan, where it's set to start in May. The series will be distributed by Deagostini, and like the test run in Japan last year will feature more extravagant packaging than the rest of the world, with each magazine and modelling coming in a large box (see my previous report for a look at how those work).\n\nThe Japanese website is a different design to all the others, but offers the same basic subscription package with the same extra bits for subscribers. The Japanese site pictures a completely different design Borg Cube to that has been released to UK subscribers, or pictured on any of the other international sites, who knows if Japan will actually get a different model.\n\nFinally, The Collection's Facebook page recently posted a survey for UK readers. They want to know how much interest there would be in a couple of extra product ranges they are thinking about creating. Specifically they have floated the idea of doing more dedication plaque replicas (following the Enterprise-D one offered to subscribers), suggesting doing the Enterprises, Voyager, Defiant, and Prometheus. The other idea floated is some sort of special edition of the Star Trek Haynes Manuals, which were written by The Collection's project manager, Ben Robinson. They don't specify what form this specialness will take; I guess we'll find out if the survey gets a positive response.\n\n↧\n\nComic covers\n\nGot some new comic covers to enjoy. First up, Amazon have added listing for two new omnibuses on the way from IDW. There's a particularly snazzy new cover (I think probably by Michael Stribling, but that's unconfirmed) for their second Gold Key Archives book, which collects together remastered versions of issues seven to twelve of the classic TOS comic series. This book is expected in October:\n\nBoldly going... where it all started! Presenting the first comic book adventures of the U.S.S. Enterprise and her crew! Fully remastered with new colors, Volume 2 collects the Gold Key issues #7-12, including stories such as \"The Voodoo Planet,\"\"The Legacy of Lazarus,\"\"The Brain Shocker,\" and more.\n\nDue in September is the eighth omnibus of the nuTrek ongoing series. This will be a bigger book than previous omnibuses in the series, containing six issues (rather than four) comprising three two-part stories: Parallel Lives, I, Enterprise, and Lost Apollo. The next story after these is the six-parter, The Q Gambit, so I guess they wanted to make sure these were all sorted before releasing that whole story as Volume Nine. The cover reuses Joe Corroney's artwork for issue thrity-three, part one of Lost Apollo.\n\nThe new Five Year Mission of the Enterprise continues as Captain Jane Tiberius Kirk and her crew encounter a never-before-seen enemy in deep space! That's right... Jane Kirk. Plus, the crew of the Enterprise have never faced a threat like the one they face now: their own ship!\n\nFinally StarTrek.com have posted the two covers for July's second issue in Harlan Ellison’s City on the Edge of Forever, The Original Teleplay. The standard cover will be one of Juan Ortiz's retro designs, while Paul Shipper will be providing the subscriber variant cover:\n\nThe adventure sends Captain Kirk, Mr. Spock and Yeoman Rand back to the Enterprise following their first encounter with the Guardians of Forever, only to find a darker, more vicious crew of renegades awaiting them. Can they return the timestream to its proper state? And will they even survive long enough to try?\n\nFor more information and links to my previous coverage on all the current Star Trek comics, hit the \"comics\" button on my schedule page.\n\n↧\n\nVideo game updates: Latest from Online, Timelines, and Infinity Wars\n\nHere's some video game news. First up, Star Trek Online's latest round of updates includes a new Undine (aka Species 8472) lock-box, which introduces the usual assortment of new ships and equipment to players of the game. There are two Undine ships, the Nicor class bio-warship, and the Dromias class bio-cruiser.\n\nThose ships come with special abilities: The Nicor class can summon other 8472 ships to create a lower-power version of the planet destroying weapon, while the Dromias can open a portal to Fluidic Space, flooding an area of normal space with liqudiy stuff that upsets other ships.\n\nThe equipment available via the lock box also includes Undine armour and weapons for characters, so everyone can dress up like a Species 8472:\n\nYou can find out more about the Undine lock-box on the STO website. The Undine focus is because Species 8472 are coming back into the spotlight in Online as the major adversary in the latest update, Season 9: A New Accord. This video introduces the new Undine Story arc, you'll find more details on STO's website:\n\nMeanwhile another online Star Trek game is just starting to become a reality. Jon Radoff, CEO of Disruptor Beam, recently talked to Polygon about Star Trek Timelines, and gave this summary of what they hope to achieve with the game:\n\nWe've created this amazing galaxy generator which will populate what I think will be this big galaxy filled with content so there's always new things to explore and discover,\" Radoff said. \"... and as you explore you run into conflicts, but the conflicts more often than not are not necessarily resolved by a phaser or with violence. It's going to be a big part of this game, leveraging the story elements, the crafting elements, a new tactical mission system that we're developing that will have the option to fight, yes, but also science will play a role, diplomacy, other kinds of non-violent problem resolution will be part of it because that's really what Star Trek is about.\n\nIt's something that historically Star Trek licenses have struggled with. People are consistently a little bit disappointed with a lot of Star Trek games, because most just become another combat simulator, with ship-to-ship combat or running around planets firing phasers at everything. That's not what we want to do.\n\nFinally, another online game has just got a touch of Star Trek. Infinity Wars, an animated online card game, has just had a set of TNG cards added to the game. StarTrek.com have previewed the fun animations, which look like this (continues after the jump):\n\n↧\n\nCushions, bottle openers, and more of the latest Star Trek stuff\n\nFeeling a lack of Star Trek in some corner of your life? Here are the latest Star Trek bits and pieces to plug those gaps:\n\nThinkGeek's latest TOS uniform product sees the Starfleet uniform design applied to cushions. You'll need to make sure you only place these on furniture made from the latest flame retardant materials, as the red one will attract phaser fire, lightning, and the like.\n\nAnother staple of recent Star Trek tie-in stuff is things shaped like the USS Enterprise. A few years ago the USS Enterprise bottle opener was released with a silvery finish, and now it's back in three new versions. You can now get the Enterprise in either white, black, or gold, each of which comes in a box to match the colour. I think the white one looks especially effective for the Enterprise:\n\nContinue after the jump for lots more stuff, including puzzles, screen wipes, and busts:\n\nAta-Boy, who have previously brought us Star Trekbadges and mouse mats have added a big new range of screen-wipes. They are offering lots of TOS and TNG designs, including ships, characters, emblems and quotes. Each wipe can be adhered to the back of your tablet or phone, where it gives a bit of Star Trek decoration, and then peeled off when needed to clean the screen. Here are a couple of the ship designs:\n\nAquarius have also recently expanded their Star Trek range, with another jigsaw puzzle, this time featuring the USS Enterprise, as well as magnetic logos, and a several (pretty generic) posters. Here are the puzzle and magnets:\n\nAnother growing range comes from Diamond Select Toys, who last year released a Spock bust bank. On the way this year is a second bank, Captain Kirk. DST have revealed artwork for this in their latest catalogue:\n\nFinally, if you want a higher end bust, there's some bad news. Titan Mechanise have previously announced a large range of Star Trek busts in their Masterpiece Collection, with numerous TOS and TNG characters planned. So far only Kirk and Picard have been released, and it seems most of the rest, which have been repeatedly delayed, will not make it. Responding to a question on Facebook, Titan have confirmed Spock, Worf, and Khan, are still on the way, but that will be all because:\n\nThe other designs which were announced are sadly now not currently scheduled due to the global orders being too low.\n\nThe three remaining bust are still suffering continued delays, with the latest estimates from Entertainment Earth and Forbidden Planet suggesting an August or September release.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nDrex Files: New York World's Fair in the Trekverse\n\nThis year, this month in fact, marks the fiftieth anniversary of the 1964 New York World's Fair, a showcase of innovation and futuristic architecture, themed on the Star-Trekian ideals of \"Peace Through Understanding\" and showcasing \"Man's Achievement on a Shrinking Globe in an Expanding Universe\". Why do I mention this half century old exhibition here? Well the gleaming world presented at the Fair quickly found itself brought to life in the Star Trek future, with the futuristic designs making their way to distant worlds, starships, and other parts of future Earth. In this Drex Files in Exile, Doug Drexler guides us through the Fair's influence on him, and his predecessors, in Star Trek.\n\nDoug Drexler, then and now.\n\nDoug's life long love for the Fair began in his childhood, when he regularly visited:\n\nTwice a week and for two summers, impressionable eleven year old Doug Drexler was dropped off by his Dad at the front gate of the world of tomorrow. It did not neccessitate a slingshot around the sun, nor did it call for call for Mr. Atoz and his Atavachron. The lad’s awe inspiring and futuristic destination was not some far flung decade, but then and there in 1964. It rose from the most unlikely of places… a landfill in Flushing Meadow. It was the New York World’s Fair, and it was the proverbial world of tomorrow. It would impress him to the core.\n\nAs Spock observed, time could be perceived as a river, with eddies and backwashes. Someone else was washed up onto that shore, and our paths undoubtedly crossed at the jetting waters of the iconic Unisphere, or trekked side by side along the undulating Kodak Moon Deck, or stood in line at Ford’s Magic Skyway. My fellow time traveler was Walter “Matt” Jefferies… aviator, illustrator, art director, and he would become one of the most important artistic influences in my life.\n\nThe 1964-65 New York World’s Fair was the largest international exhibition ever buit in the United States, and it was all about THE FUTURE. Never before, and never again would there be such an amazing conglomeration of optimistic, sci-fi, wet dream, futurism in one place. Matt Jefferies absorbed it all with intense fascination. And so the New York World’s Fair was the birthplace of the Star Trek design ethic. I would never be the same because of it…\n\nAlbert Whitlock Jr.'s Starbase 11 matte painting\n\nThe real world Starbase 11 at the World's Fair\n\nPerhaps the most iconic influence of the Fair in Star Trek can be seen in the form of Starbase 11, as seen in the TOS episode Court Martial. The Starbase, depicted in Albert Whitlock Jr.'s iconic matte painting, includes the New York State Pavillion and the nearby Astro-View Towers, almost exactly duplicated on a distant alien world. Some of the few remaining structures at the original site, these have recently been declared a \"National Treasure” by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, paving the way for their ongoing preservation and restoration. Doug explains how these structures found there way into the Trekverse:\n\nLong before there was Internet, there were World’s Fair’s. That’s how new ideas were introduced, and affluent American corporations opened their dream labs to the wide-eyed public. The NYWF was nicknamed “The Billion-Dollar Fair” and it’s official theme was Peace through Understanding. Robert Moses, the Fair’s chairman proclaimed that it “had something for everyone.” American industry was booming, and corporations had money to burn. Forty years later, Matt would tell Mike Okuda and I what an impression it had made on him. When he returned home to southern California, there was a message “… from a guy named Roddenberry.” The Fair’s impact on Star Trek would be considerable.\n\nContinue after the jump to see where else in the Trekverse the Fair has found itself:\n\nDoug revisited Starbase 11 himself many years later in an illustration for the book New Worlds, New Civilizations. He added several more World's Fair buildings to expand the view to previously unseen parts of the base:\n\nThis was an updated version of Starbase 11, the Albert Whitlock matte painting from the original Star Trek series (1966). I created it for a book tie-in called \"Star Trek: New Worlds, New Civilizations\" (1999). The idea was that the base continued to expand over the years. Visible are the Ford Pavilion, Travelers Insurance, and Johnson Wax.\n\nBack in the sixties, the World's Fair had established itself at a smaller scale from the very first episode of Star Trek, the video communications device seen in The Cage takes it's form and function directly from the Bell Video Phone, a device introduced at the World's Fair.\n\nFollowing the example of Jefferies and his contemporaries, modern Star Trek productions has also channelled the New York World's Fair aesthetic. Here's Doug with a miniature seen in Voyager:\n\nThat's me with a miniature we built for the Star Trek: Voyager episode \"Lifesigns\" (1996). It is part of the Utopia Planitia fleet yards on Mars. The New York State Pavilion influence is evident.\n\nLike their predecessors' example, Doug and other members of the art department on more recent productions have also taken buildings almost directly from the Fair into the Trekverse. Starfleet Command for example:\n\nThe General Motor’s pavilion was one of the largest buildings at the fair. Approximately 4.000 tons of structural steel and 10,500 cubic yards of concrete went into it’s construction. The distinctive canopy that served as the pavilions entrance soared 10 stories over a reflecting pool, and was visible for miles. Housed within was the popular Futurama ride, which predicted moon bases and vacation hotels under the sea. It was a huge inspiration to thousands of kids who grew up to be scientists, engineers, and yours truly.\n\nMany years later in the DS9 episode Homefront, VFX supervisor Gary Hutzel called Mike looking for a model of starfleet command... and he needed it yesterday. The GM pavilion came instantly to mind. To me, the soaring canopy reminded me of the billowing sail of a ship of the line. I showed it to Mike, and he handed it over to Anthony Fredrickson. Anthony slammed it together using an old levelor blind and spare parts. The train was made out of bird feeders and cassette racks. Considering he had no time, he did a marvy job, but it was not as elegant as I would have liked. Still a kick.\n\nSeveral buildings made it into another part of San Francisco, a century earlier, too:\n\nA shot Mike Okuda and I put together for Star Trek: The Motion Picture – The Director’s Cut, while working at Foundation Imaging. On the bluff (left) are visible New York World's Fair Buildings - Ford, Travelers, and the New York State Pavilion.\n\nIf you'd like a better look at the real world buildings that have migrated to the Trekverse, Doug has a big gallery of images on Facebook, and indeed if you follow Doug on Facebook you'll find a wealth of information about the New York World's Fair. You can also find out more about the influence of the Fair, including features on Doug, in recent reports from The New York Times, and New York Daily News. For further reading, Doug also recommends a book which gave him a lot of information on the Fair to expand upon his own experiences, The 1964-1965 New York World's Fair, by Bill Cotter and Bill Young.\n\nDoug's fascination with the New York World's Fair doesn't stop at sneaking it into Star Trek, he actually now owns a few relics from it too! Here's Doug with his very own Luminaire, one of the distinctive pixel-like street lights once at the World's Fair.\n\nYou can see more of this and some of Doug other World's Fair memorabilia in two of his galleries on Facebook, here, and here.\n\nFor more of the Drex Files in Exile, check out our index page here on The Trek Collective. And for more from Doug, you can befriend him on Facebook, where you'll find lots more about the World's Fair, Star Trek, and more.\n\n↧\n\nComic bits: July releases, photo-comic preview, and I, Enterprise excerpt\n\nA few bits of comics news. Starting with the July line-up from IDW. There are three Star Trek title's in IDW's July solicitations. That's one less than I was expecting, as John Byrne's New Visionsphoto-comic series was in line for a release this month too, after the first issue in the bi-monthly series coming in May - Evidently it's not quite perfectly bimonthly! The three titles that are coming have already been previewed, as the two crossover titles, and classic bit of TOS, are all quite high profile. If you've missed all the news about them, here are the solicitation summaries:\n\nStar Trek (ongoing) #35: The Q Gambit, Part 1\n\nWritten by Mike Johnson, with art and cover by Tony Shasteen, or a subscription photo-cover.\n\n\"The Q Gambit\" begins here! The crew of the new STAR TREK film franchise encounters the classic Trek villain Q for the first time, only in this all-new 6-part galaxy-spanning adventure developed in associataion with screenwriter/producer Roberto Orci! The mischievous Q sends James T. Kirk on quest that will see the Enterprise joining forces with familiar faces from Star Trek lore, beginning with the crew of a certain space station…\n\nHarlan Ellison’s The City on the Edge of Forever, The Original Teleplay #2\n\nWritten by Harlan Ellison, Scott Tipton and David Tipton, with art by J.K. Woodward. Cover by Juan Ortiz, or subscription cover by Paul Shipper.\n\nHarlan Ellison’s Hugo and WGA Award-winning teleplay, visualized for the first time! Captain Kirk, Mr. Spock and Yeoman Rand return to the Enterprise following their first encounter with the Guardians of Forever, only to find a darker, more vicious crew of renegades awaiting them! Can they return the timestream to its proper state? And will they even survive long enough to try?\n\nStar Trek Special: Flesh and Stone\n\nWritten by Scott and David Tipton, with art and covers by The Sharp Brothers.\n\nWhen a Starfleet medical conference is crashed by a deadly metamorphic virus, Doctors Beverly Crusher, Julian Bashir and Katherine Pulaski have to race against time...to find a cure. The answers lie in the distant past, deep within the files of Dr. Leonard McCoy! All of Star Trek's medical officers team up for the first time ever!\n\nWhile there is apparently not a photo-comic coming in July, John Byrne is still busy working on future issues, and has posted another preview from one of them on his forums. Here's the Enterprise encountering a newly created alien ship:\n\nFinally, out this week is issue thirty-two of the nuTrek ongoing series, the second part of the Science Officer 0718 origin story, I, Enterprise. Here's a seven page preview (continues after the jump):\n\n↧\n\nStarships Collection previews\n\nReady for a look at the next few ships in The Official Starships Collection? Well, Things From Another World now have listings up for issue twenty-five, the USS Prometheus, and issue twenty-six, the 22nd century Tholian ship. Alas they are only previewing cover artwork, not the ships models this time:\n\nThese two should be showing up first in the UK, in July and August. Not quite so far off, Eaglemoss have also recently updated The Collection's website with preview images of issue twnty-one, the USS Enterprise-E, and issue twenty-two, the Krenim Temporal Weapon, which will be starting to appear in a month or so:\n\nFinally, The Collection's Facebook page have also been previewing, with a high res look at the Vor'cha class model from issue twenty, as well as the cover and a spread from inside the magazine (which you can find after the jump):\n\nFor a listing of all the ships in the Starships Collection, including links to all my previous previews and reviews, see my index page.\n\n↧\n\nBook bits: DTI, Klingons, New Frontier, and Serpents\n\nSome Star Trek books news. Starting with a little update on Christopher L. Bennett's third Department of Temporal Investigations story, the forthcoming ebook novella, The Collectors. Listings for this are now online, which gives it a release date on October this year. Bennett has previously spoken about the novella, which will feature the DTI's time travel technology storage facility, the Eridian Vault, and the 31st century temporal agent, Jena Noi.\n\nComing a little sooner is Keith R.A DeCandido's new Klingon \"non-fiction\" book, The Klingon Art of War. The G and T Show recently talked to DeCandido about the book, who summarised what the book will entail:\n\nIt's been written in the same vein as Sun Tzu's Art of War.. It's more like a philosophy book than anything; it's a guide on how to live your life as a proper warrior. I joked that it's my first self help book.\n\nThe way the book is structured is: The original book, The Klingon Art of War, was written and published not to long after Khaless's disappearance/ascension/whatever. And it was also after the the Hurq invasion.\n\nWe've got the original text, that was from a couple of thousand years ago, and that is followed by modern commentary by a modern Klingon author named Karatak, who was mentioned in passing in a Next gen episode in the second season, who provides this modern commentary; more anecdotes and such, on how the different precepts apply to more modern Klingons. This way I can use examples from the tv show, from the novels, as well as other stuff I made up.\n\nAlso due in May, and starting to show up right about now, is Jeff Mariotte's TOS movie-era return to A Private Little War's planet Neural, Serpents in the Garden. Simon and Schuster have now released an excerpt from this one, you can find all of chapter one, on their site.\n\nFinally a little rumouring for New Frontier. Andorian fanatic and all-round Trek-fan, Therin of Andor, has posted on the TrekBBS, reporting news from a friend of his who apparently met Peter David at a recent comic convention in Salt Lake city, and informed Therin that Peter David mentioned there are plans afoot for a new New Frontier novel. If so it will be the first since Blind Man's Bluff in 2011.\n\nFor more details of current and forthcoming books, hit one of the books buttons at the top of my schedule page, to find listing of the year's releases, and links to my previous coverage.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nDST searches for Spock, finds Kirk\n\nAt the past weekend's Chicago Comic and Entertainment Expo Diamond Select Toys previewed two new additions to their Star Trek range. Expected in the autumn this year will be the fourth Excelsior class variant in their model starships range. Having gradually worked backwards through the timeline, the USS Excelsior NX-2000 will be joining the Enterprise-B, the battle damaged-B, and the Excelsior NCC-2000. Eagle-eyed starships fans should note the latest NX variation features not just a registration change, but a different bridge module and shuttle-bay, plus the area between the impulse engines is darker. Here's an image posted by DST on their Facebook page:\n\nAlso on display is DST's second bust bank, which is Captain Kirk, to join the existing Spock bust. Image again via Facebook:\n\nGoing back to The Search For Spock, also on the way this year is a phaser from that film. Entertainment Earth now have a listing up for that, suggesting an October release, and showing this new image:\n\n↧\n\nEnterprise's final season bluray extras\n\nOut this month is the fourth, and, lamentably, the final, season of Star Trek: Enterprise on bluray. Ahead of the US release, StarTrek.com have got the bluray producer, Robert Lay Jr. to talk about his experiences working on all the Enterprise blurays. Amongst that Lay also summarised the key extra features in this final season:\n\nThe centerpiece of the season four special features collection is the two-hour documentary film “BEFORE HER TIME: DECOMISSIONING ENTERPRISE.” This four-part documentary sheds light on the development and production of the series’ final season, still considered by fans as the show’s shining hour, with an amazing collection of episodes that finally helped the series fulfill its promise as the prequel chapter in the Star Trek saga. Almost every episode in this season helps bring the storytelling one step closer to the world of Star Trek: The Original Series.\n\nTo close out this Blu-ray collection, we’ve also put together another reunion piece: this time bringing together members of the show’s writing staff from all four seasons. Fans who’ve picked up the previous sets are well aware of the many drastic changes in the writing staff and creative direction during the show’s entire run. We felt it was really important to reunite the key group of individuals responsible for some of the more significant creative developments during the series’ run.\n\nThis feature-length writing staff reunion special tracks the complete creative arc of the series from its rocky beginnings to the chaotic and frantic development of the Xindi War story arc, and ultimately the highly satisfying mini-arcs developed for season four by writers and longtime Star Trek fans such as Coto, Mike Sussman, and Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens, who relished the opportunity to finally tell stories that could help lay the foundation for some of the classic elements first seen in The Original Series.\n\nSince the show left the air in 2005, fans have been wondering about the lost tales of the NX-01 crew leading up to the founding of the Federation. Viewers will be thrilled to discover some of the incredibly mind-boggling plots and ideas Coto and company had planned for season five and beyond, including an origin tale for the cloud city of Stratos first seen in the TOS episode “The Cloud Minders,” a mini-series set in the Mirror Universe, more tales centered around the Gorn and the Orion Syndicate, and, more importantly, the complete details for the storyline cooked up by the Reeves-Stevens which was being considered by William Shatner to reprise his iconic role of Kirk… Tiberius Kirk!\n\nCBS have also released an excerpt from the writers reunion:\n\n↧\n\nDoing the ebook shuffle\n\nUPDATE: We interrupt this ebook news article with breaking novel news: Dayton Ward has just announced on Twitter that his post-The FallTNG novel, due mid-2015, will be titled Armageddon's Arrow. He gave this short summary in a follow-up tweet:\n\nI've been wanting to do a TNG story that's sort of TOS in flavor, with Picard & the gang encountering some weird alien stuff :)\n\nNow, back to novellas: Just a few days ago a listing appeared for The Collectors, Christopher L. Bennett's latest ebook novella, and his third Department of Temporal Investigations story. Initially listed for an October release, if you look now you might notice it's been pushed back to December.\n\nFear not though ebook readers, for that has just made room for another of this year's new ebooks to find a publication slot. There are now listings up for Q are Cordially Uninvited..., a TNG novella set to show us the wedding of Jean-Luc Picard and Beverly Crusher, with a certain, undoubtedly uninvited, guest. This ebook now sits in the October slot. The listings also reveal the author, Rudy Josephs; a name that might seem familiar, as he has two previous stories under his belt, the most recent of which was the second nuTrekStarfleet Academy young adult novel, The Edge, which was published in 2010.\n\nIt also appears that Scott Pearson's TOS novella, The More Things Change, has been brought forward a month, now due in June instead of July.\n\nLess far off, this month sees the second Star Trek ebook of the year, Michael A. Martin's Seasons of Light and Darkness. Unless you've read it already, this one remains a bit of a mystery, as Simon and Schuster seem to have decided not to bother with a blurb this time. It has been previously established it will feature Doctor McCoy, early in the events of The Wrath of Khan. Simon and Schuster have now released an excerpt, which takes us back a little earlier in McCoy's timeline. You can read that, on their website.\n\nContinue after the jump for reminder of all the ebooks on this way in the coming year:\n\nThe schedule as it stands (which seems to be rather more flexible with ebooks than paperbacks), is as follows:\n\nTitan: Absent Enemies, by John Jackson Miller (February 2014)\n\nThe first story set after The Fall, this takes us on a diplomatic adventure on the USS Titan, as well as featuring a cameo from the USS Aventine. The novella is a sequel to the TNG episode The Next Phase, and is also John Jackson Miller's first Star Trek outing - He will be returning next year with an Aventine focused novel.\n\nOrder: Amazon.com, Amazon.co.uk, Amazon.ca, Amazon.de, Amazon.fr, Amazon.es, Amazon.it, Amazon.co.jp, iTunes.\n\nTOS: Seasons of Light and Darkness, by Michael A.

Things From Another World now have listing up for that celebratory issue, including the covers (the green one is the Previews exclusive) and a blurb:\n\nStar Trek Magazine marks our 50th US issue with a celebration of Star Trek's inception, half a century ago. We're kicking off the anniversary party early, and celebrating the true birth of the starship Enterprise in 1964 on the drawing board of legendary production designer Matt Jefferies. Doug Drexler pays special tribute to his mentor, and sheds light on what inspired this iconic design. We also explore how that first Enterprise set the tone for generations, with a history of starships bearing that name, and commemorate 46 years of Star Trek on UK TV screens.\n\nMeanwhile issue forty-nine has just come out, which includes a feature on Khan. Visionary Trek’s Michael Clark and Sina Alvarado contributed to this feature, and have posted preview pages (which you can also find after the jump):\n\n↧\n\nBook bits: The Missing, Light Fantastic, Foul Deeds, and more\n\nStar Trek books editor Margaret Clark was recently interviewed by Visionary Trek's The Captains’ Table podcast. She spoke about all aspects of her Star Trek work, from comics and reference books through to her current role shaping the novel and ebook line. That includes a few teases of things to come, such as revealing she already has ten of 2015's books sorted, and four of 2016's! That sets her up to focus on the rest of 2016, where she has already submitted ideas for book projects to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of Star Trek.\n\nA little less far off she also teased some of this year's titles. Including this summary of Una McCormack's DS9 novel, The Missing:\n\n...when we arrive at Deep Space Nine, Beverly Crusher is the acting CMO of the station, and she comes across her predecessor, from the Enterprise-D, Katherine Pulaski, comes to Deep Space Nine, and the two women don't exactly see eye to eye...\n\nA few tidbits were also mentioned:\n\nAdmiral Riker will be guest starring in John Jackon Miller's Aventine/TNG novel next year.\n\nPaula Block and Terry Erdmann's Quark ebook, Lust's Latinum Lost (and Found), has gone down so well behind the scenes that the writing partners are already down to do another Quark novella, this time with even more Ferengi involved.\n\nClark confirmed Peter David is in talks to write a new New Frontier novel.\n\nKirsten Beyer's third Voyagernovel in the current trilogy, Atonement, will most likely end up coming in either September or July in 2015.\n\nThe Captain's Table have also recently interviewed a couple of the authors as well. Continue after the jump for a few highlights from those podcasts:\n\nVisionary Treks talked to Jeffrey Lang about most of his Star Trek works, including lots of hints of what his new Data novel, The Light Fantastic, will be exploring:\n\nA big part of what this story is about is how does their [Data and Lal's] relationship develop. In that single episode of Next Generation, Lal was around for all of, maybe a day or two, before she went into cascade failure. And this is about what their relationship is like; what Data finds about being a parent; what it's like to have a child. Especially a child who isn't exactly typical; Lal isn't an infant, she's not an adolescent, she's not an adult, she's kind of all that at the same time.\n\nIt's also a caper, because I've always wanted to do something like a crime.. not crime exactly, the seedy underbelly of the Federation, the Alpha Quadrant, what's going on there.\n\nIt's a bit of a buddy story, because it gets Geordi La Forge, and Data off together doing adventurous things. I love them together, I think Geordi and Data are great together. I think it's the next chapter in their development, because in all of the previous incarnations, Geordi's always the older brother, he's always the one who's sort of guiding Data and telling him.. and in this story Data I think finally kind of moves past him in some point.\n\nIn another interview, with Greg Cox, they mostly discussed his most recent book, the TOS/Voyager crossover, No Time Like the Past, but also looked ahead to his movie-era TOS book coming at the end of the year, Foul Deeds Will Rise, including discussing Chekov's prominence in the story:\n\nChekov actually gets to shine a bit. He is the security chief upon the Enterprise-A, and bad things, Foul Deeds indeed, happen aboard the Enterprise-A, and Chekov ends up having to do quite a lot of the work. Especially since I in fact conveniently arranged to get Spock get off the ship for most of the book, and I did this quite deliberately, and gave Spock his own B-plot, not just because Spock is cool and deserves his own B-plot, but honestly the idea was to get Spock of the ship so Chekov could have a chance to shine and Kirk can't just turn to Spock when he needs a problem solved.\n\nYou can hear lots more from the authors and editors discussing much more of their Star Trek work and more, by listening to the full podcasts from Visionary Treks linked above.

DeCandido's first Star Trek book in a few a years. While it's not a novel this time, DeCandido is returning to familiar ground with a look at Klingon culture, in a new reference-ish sort of book, The Klingon Art of War.\n\nIn the book DeCandido guides us through Kahless' ten precepts; giving his original Klingon commandments, presented alongside numerous examples of the principles in action, from ancient pre-Kahless times, through to the Destiny-era of the 24th century novelverse.\n\nStarTrek.com have now posted a few preview pages, giving us a look at the first precept (continues after the jump):\n\nAlso previously released is the ninth precept title page:\n\nAnd if you're curious, the blurb lays out all ten precepts:\n\nPassed down from the time of Kahless, ten precepts have shaped Klingon culture and indoctrinated Klingons in the Way of the Warrior. With this new translation, people from all walks of life—and all worlds—can harness the ancient Klingon wisdom and learn to embody courage, discipline, and honor.\n\n• Choose your enemies well.\n\n• Strike quickly or strike not.\n\n• Always face your enemy.\n\n• Seek adversity.\n\n• Reveal your true self in combat.\n\n• Destroy weakness.\n\n• Leave nothing until tomorrow.\n\n• Choose death over chains.\n\n• Die standing up.\n\n• Guard honor above all.\n\n↧"
