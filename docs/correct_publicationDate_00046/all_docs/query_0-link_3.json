Or, maybe you just clicked on a link by mistake while on your way to something more interesting.\n\nDoesn’t matter. Welcome!\n\nSo…about me. Yeah…well, you see, it’s like this: Until recently, I was a software developer and analyst, having become a slave to Corporate America after spending eleven years in the U.S. Marine Corps. Why did I join the military? Pretty simple, really. I’d gotten tired of people telling me what to do all the time, and was looking for a change.\n\nWhoops.\n\nIn truth, I joined for a handful of different reasons, from carrying on a family tradition to wanting a challenge unlike anything else I’d faced to that point to simpler stuff like just wanting to see the world. I’m proud of my time spent in uniform. I gave Uncle Sam eleven years, and he gave me a long list of skills and experiences that have continued to serve me to this day. I think I got the better end of that deal by a fairly wide margin.\n\nIn September 2014, I said goodbye to my day job and embarked on a bold new journey as a full-time writer.\n\nThough I was born and raised in Tampa, Florida, fate and circumstances have seen to it that my family and I now call Kansas City home."
