        "text": "MERE ANARCHY\n\nA new six-part epic covering thirty years of Star TrekÂ® history, continuing with an adventure that takes place during the historic five-year mission!\n\nBook 1: THINGS FALL APART\n\nMestiko: a world on the brink of interstellar space travel -- and under covert Federation observation. When the Payav, Mestiko's dominant nation, learns of a rogue pulsar sweeping through their star system and threatening to destroy all life on their planet, the Federation is faced with a daunting choice: stand by and witness the extinction of a thriving civilization, or violate the Prime Directive and mount a desperate effort to protect the planet from total devastation.\n\nThe Starship Enterprise, newly under the command of James T. Kirk, is sent to aid the doomed planet. Kirk and his officers -- Spock, Mitchell, Kelso, Scott, Sulu, and Dr. Piper -- must use an experimental, untested technology to save the planet before it's too late!\n\nA new eBook from the authors of A Time to Sow, A Time to Harvest and Summon the Thunder"
