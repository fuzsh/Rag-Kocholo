In contrast to the setting of the other Star Trek TV shows, it takes place on a space station instead of a starship, so as not to have two series with starships at the same time (the starship USS Defiant was introduced in season 3, but the station remained the primary setting for the show).\n\nThe show is noted for its well-developed characters, its original, complex plots, religious themes and for starring the only black captain in any of the televised incarnations of Star Trek. The series often showcased darker themes, less physical exploration of space, and (in later seasons) an emphasis on many aspects of war.\n\nEmissary by J.M.

Her Dickensian quote of Jacob Marley is so visceral that if the quote fails to move you to tears, then you may possibly be dead.\n\nMy first quote comes from Surprised by Joy by C.S. Lewis. In his spiritual autobiography, Lewis discusses his early years and how his home was filled with the magic of books. As a lifelong lover of books and reading, I adore this quote because it describes the idyllic existence of all people of the book.\n\n“I am a product of long corridors, empty sunlit rooms, indoor silences, attics explored in solitude, distant noises of gurgling cisterns and pipes, and the noise of wind under the tiles. Also, of endless books. My father bought all the books he read and never got rid of any of them. There were books in the study, books in the drawing room, books in the cloakroom, books (two deep) in the great bookcase on the landing, books in a bedroom, books piled as high as my shoulder in the cistern attic, books of all kinds reflecting every transient stage of my parents’ interest, books readable and unreadable, books suitable for a child and books emphatically not. Nothing was forbidden me. In the seemingly endless rainy afternoons I took volume after volume from the shelves. I had always the same certainty of finding a book that was new to me as a man who walks into a field has of finding a new blade of grass.”\n\nMy second quote comes from Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird, which I have read twenty-five times and each and every reading of it stills fills me with wonder and joy.\n\nMiss Caroline began the day by reading us a story about cats. The cats had long conversations with one another, they wore cunning little clothes and lived in a warm house beneath a kitchen stove. By the time Mrs. Cat called the drugstore for an order of chocolate malted mice the class was wriggling like a bucketful of catawba worms. Miss Caroline seemed unaware that the ragged, denim-shirted and flour sack-skirted first grade, most of whom had chopped cotton and fed hogs from the time they were able to walk, were immune to imaginative literature. Miss Caroline came to the end of the story and said, “Oh, my, wasn’t that nice?”\n\nThen she went to the blackboard and printed the alphabet in enormous square capitals, turned to the class and asked, “Does anybody know what these are?”\n\nEverybody did; most of the first grade had failed it last year.\n\nI suppose she chose me because she knew my name; as I read the alphabet a faint line appeared between her eyebrows, and after making me read most of My First Reader and the stock-market quotations from The Mobile Register aloud, she discovered that I was literate and looked at me with more than faint distaste. Miss Caroline told me to tell my father not to teach me any more, it would interfere with my reading.\n\n“Teach me?” I said in surprise. “He hasn’t taught me anything, Miss Caroline. Atticus ain’t got time to teach me anything,” I added, when Miss Caroline smiled and shook her head. “Why, he’s so tired at night he just sits in the living room and reads.”\n\n“If he didn’t teach you, who did?” Miss Caroline asked good-naturedly. “Somebody did. You weren’t born reading The Mobile Register.”\n\n“Jim says I was. He read in a book where I was a Bullfinch instead of a Finch. Jim says my name’s really Jean Louise Bullfinch, that I got swapped when I was born and I’m really a -”\n\nMiss Caroline apparently thought I was lying. “Let’s not let our imaginations run away with us, dear,” she said. “Now you tell your father not to teach you anymore. It’s best to begin reading with a fresh mind. You tell him I’ll take over from here and try to undo the damage -”\n\n“Ma’am?”\n\n“Your father does not know how to teach. You can have a seat now.”\n\nI mumbled that I was sorry and retired meditating upon my crime. I never deliberately learned to read, but somehow I had been wallowing illicitly in the daily papers. In the long hours of church – was it then I learned? I could not remember not being able to read hymns. Now that I was compelled to think about it, reading was something that just came to me, as learning to fasten the seat of my union suit without looking around, or achieving two bows from a snarl of shoelaces. I could not remember when the lines above Atticus’s moving finger separated into words, but I had stared at them all the evenings in my memory, listening to the news of the day, Bills to Be Enacted into Laws, the diaries of Lorenzo Dow – anything Atticus happened to be reading when I crawled into his lap every night. Until I feared I would lose it, I never loved to read. One does not love breathing.\n\nThis long passage mirrors my own early childhood and how the skill of reading was an almost organic experience which grew out of my daily reading interactions with my mother and my grandmother.\n\nBooks on the Nightstand Podcast Comes to an End\n\nFor several years, I have been a weekly listener to the Books on the Nightstand Podcast hosted by Michael Kindness and Ann Kingman. This was the first podcast I discovered dedicated to the world of books, reading, and readers. I am saddened because on today’s podcast Michael and Ann announced that BOTN was coming to an end. I would like to thank Michael and Ann for the many hours of listening pleasure that they have given to me and I will certainly miss our weekly time together.\n\nThey have four or five podcasts remaining and on one of those podcasts they will highlight some other great book podcasts that we can use to fill the void created by the loss of BOTN.\n\n#HotandSticky Summer Novel Writing Challenge\n\nBrandon Sanderson’s Introduction to Science Fiction and Fantasy Writing\n\nMy reads for this weekend and into the new week include the following:\n\nMaster Evernote: The Unofficial Guide to Organizing Your Life With Evernote by S.J.

This is my first experience with a Toibin novel but it serves as a a catalyst for me to explore more of his literary fiction.\n\nBrooklyn tells us the story of Eilis Lacey, resident of a small Irish town, in the years following World War II. Ellis lives with her widowed mother and sister and her three brothers have moved to England for employment so they can send money back to help support their mother. Following a supper with a visiting Irish-born, American priest, the family is convinced to send Eilis to the priest’s parish in Brooklyn for the opportunities that living in America can offer. When she arrives in Brooklyn, Father Flood helps Eilis to secure lodging, employment, and admission to a 2-year night course leading to certification in bookkeeping. Following two-years in America, Eilis is compelled to return to Ireland because of a familial necessity and she is confronted with the decision to remain in Ireland or return to the life that she has established in America.\n\nThis book was a most enjoyable read and I will return to it again in the future."
