        "text": "MEN IN BLACK AT THE REN FAIRE!\n\nJohn Rast went to the Ren Faire looking for a fight. Well, a simulated fight, with blunt swords and safety equipment. But when his final opponent turns into a living, fire-breathing dragon, John finds himself in the fight of his life. It’s John or nothing stopping a disaster in its tracks—and the only real weapon at hand is his mom’s Volvo. So John decides to let it roll . . .\n\nAnd that's when destiny comes to call. John is spirited away to the well-hidden base of Knight Watch, the organization that stands between humanity and the real nasties the rest of the world doesn’t know about.\n\nKnight Watch would be John’s dream job—except for the storm goddess that destroys his parents’ house, the abandoned mall replete with too much dead, and the Fetch that aims to make John’s domain a final resting place. All this has John’s putative allies in the Knight Watch worried that John is the one bringing bad things into multiple worlds. John and his reluctant teammates have to figure out who, or what, is pulling the strings before all of Knight Watch falls prey to a well-concealed puppetmaster and far worse things enter this world.\n\nThings that Go Bump at High Noon!

Mike Resnick [The Buntline Special] reveals what Doc Holiday thought was so funny on his last day.

Jane Lindskold [The Firekeeper Saga, The Star Kingdom Series (with David Weber)] teaches us not to underestimate a schoolmarm when her students are in jeopardy. And Shane Hensley [Deadlands] cooks up a stew that threatens to send every famous lawman in history to their graves!\n\nPlus, a dozen more stories of how the west was wilder than any history book could contain, such as a new Native American legend by Stephen Graham Jones and a Mormon troubleshooter straddling the line between his faith and the supernatural by D.J. Butler.\n\nThe west that was rides again with west that could have been in this follow-up to Straight Outta Tombstone!\n\nContributors:\n\nMike Resnick\n\nD.J.

The world is a paradise—and then, in a moment, it ends. The council that controls the Net falls out and goes to war. Everywhere people who have never known a moment of want or pain are left wondering how to survive.\n\nBut scattered across the face of the earth are communities which have returned to the natural life of soil and small farm. In the village of Raven's Mill, Edmund Talbot, master smith and unassuming historian, finds that all the problems of the world are falling in his lap. Refugees are flooding in, bandits are roaming the woods, and his former lover and his only daughter struggle through the Fallen landscape. Enemies, new and old, gather like jackals around a wounded lion.\n\nBut what the jackals do not know is that while old he may be, this lion is far from death. And hidden in the past is a mystery that has waited until this time to be revealed. You cross Edmund Talbot at your peril, for a smith is not all he once was. . . .\n\nPraise for the Science Fiction of John Ringo\n\n\"MARVELOUS!\" —David Weber\n\n\"Explosive. . . .

Is interstellar travel so far beyond our current imaginings that it will take a fundamental transformation of humanity in order to make it possible? And, if so, will we remain Homo sapiens or become a new and unique species: Homo stellaris (the People of the Stars)?\n\nHerein are original science fiction stories by award-winning authors such as Kevin J. Anderson, William Ledbetter, Todd McCaffrey and Sarah A. Hoyt, supplemented by accessible nonfiction essays describing the science behind the fiction from people who should know—Sir Martin Rees (Astronomer Royal of the United Kingdom), Mark Shelhamer (Chief Scientist for the NASA’s Human Research Program), and more.\n\nThis collection of original stories and essays was inspired by a gathering of scientists, science fiction authors, and futurists at a series of annual meetings held by the Tennessee Valley Interstellar Workshop.

The best of military epic fantasy as the bestselling Saga of the Forgotten Warrior series continues.\n\nThe Great Extermination has begun.\n\nIn the Capitol, Grand Inquisitor Omand Vokkan hatches a plot to kill every member of the untouchable caste in all of Lok, down to the last man, woman, and child. As a member of the Order of Inquisition, Vokkan has no official say in the creation of Law, but he has powerful allies willing to do his bidding. Through them, he has convinced the Judges that the genocide will be swift, complete, and without complication. Nothing is farther from the truth.\n\nLord Protector Devedas has sworn to uphold the Law. Once, he and the traitor Ashok Vadal had been like brothers. Now, he hunts Vadal and the Sons of the Black Sword, heretics and rebels who seek to live outside the rule of the Law. All Devedas must do is find and kill his best friend and order will be restored to Lok.\n\nThe rebels seek the secret kingdom spoken of by the Prophet Thera, a paradise where water is pure and food plentiful, where there are no castes, where the people rule themselves, and are not slaves to the Capitol. Ashok Vadal is not sure he believes in such a Paradise, but he—along with his allies—does seek refuge in the rebellion’s hideout in Akershan. But Vadal, a former High Protector who has turned his back on the corrupt Law, will not merely wait meekly, hoping that fleeing to Akershan will spare the rebellion from the clutches of the Great Extermination. No, if it’s a war the Capitol wants, Vadal, who has faced down gods and demons, will be all too willing to give it to them.\n\nNEW YORK TIMES BEST-SELLING AUTHOR.

There is no USA, but America and India have become the dynamic portions of a star empire. After dealing with a terrorist plot on the isolated system of New America, Her Majesty’s special agent Robert Rogers finds his loyalties tested as he fights to defend the sometimes prickly colonists of New America, and to foil a conspiracy within the British imperial government which he serves.\n\nRogers is dismayed to find that the news he uncovered of the secret alliance between the hostile alien Gharnakh’sha and the star-spanning Islamic Caliphate has been suppressed. Worse, the fact that the Sons of Wilkinson, New America extremists Rogers previously thwarted, were in league with the Gharnakh’sha and the Caliphate has caused all New Americans to come under a cloud of imperial suspicion.\n\nWhen the Gharnakh’sha threaten once more, Rogers must decide whether or not to “go rogue,” and help the New Americans resist an oncoming occupation. What’s more, the only hope for the colonists may be to deploy a super-weapon which Rogers has so far done everything in his power to prevent them from ever using!\n\nAbout Her Majesty's American:\n\n\"White presents thought provoking observations about humanity in an alternate future, with clever twists and turns.\"—Booklist\n\n\"With a strong combination of alternate history, science fact, and science fiction, White (the Starfire series) takes readers into a future of interplanetary colonization and threats both foreign and domestic.\"—Publishers Weekly"
