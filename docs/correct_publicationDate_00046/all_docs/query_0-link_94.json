        "text": "Pocket Books editor Marco Palmieri was also greatly helpful in making certain that a number of continuing story threads I wanted to set in motion in this book would be carried forward into the other Mirror Universe projects.\n\nWorking on a project like this, I would have been lost without the first-rate reference works of Michael and Denise Okuda ( The Star Trek Encyclopedia, The Star Trek Chronology) and Geoffrey Mandel ( Star Trek Star Charts).\n\nAnd, lest I forget, none of this would exist at all if not for the brilliance of “Mirror, Mirror” scriptwriter Jerome Bixby, and the rest of the cast and crew of the original Star Trek television series, including the original “one man with a vision,” Gene Roddenberry.\n\nThe Worst of Both Worlds\n\nThanks, most of all, to Margaret Clark for coming up with the basic idea for this story, then trusting me to write it. Also to my friends and family in Seattle, who provided a great deal of logistical support while I was trying to write this in the midst of an extended family reunion.\n\nAnd particularly to Sumi Lee, for loaning me a VCR on which I could watch various crucial episodes over and over.\n\nAbout the Authors\n\nMIKE SUSSMAN has written or co-written more than thirty episodes of Star Trek, including the two-part Enterprise episode “In a Mirror, Darkly,” hailed by The New York Daily News as “the best hours of Enterprise yet.” Sussman began his television writing career in earnest when he was hired as a story editor during the seventh season of Star Trek: Voyager. In 2001, he was one of the first writers to come aboard the next chapter in the Star Trek saga, Enterprise, eventually rising to the level of producer. His other scripts include “Twilight,” which was broadcast as the “Number 1 Fan Favorite episode” during the final season of Enterprise. After leaving Star Trek, Sussman worked as a writer and supervising producer on the CBS drama Threshold. He lives in Los Angeles and can be visited on the Web at www.mikesussman.net.\n\nDAYTON WARD has been a fan of Star Trek since conception (his, not the show’s). His professional writing career began with stories selected for each of Pocket Books’ first three Star Trek: Strange New Worlds anthologies. In addition to the numerous credits he shares with friend and co-writer Kevin Dilmore, Dayton is the author of the Star Trek novel In the Name of Honor and the science fiction novels The Last World War and The Genesis Protocol as well as short stories that have appeared in Kansas City Voices magazine and the Star Trek: New Frontier anthology No Limits. Though he currently lives in Kansas City with his wife and daughter, Dayton is a Florida native and still maintains a torrid long-distance romance with his beloved Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Visit him on the Web at www.daytonward.com.\n\nKEVIN DILMORE, for more than eight years, was a contributing writer to Star Trek Communicator, penning news stories and personality profiles for the bimonthly publication of the Official Star Trek Fan Club. On the storytelling side of things, his story “The Road to Edos” was published as part of the Star Trek: New Frontier anthology No Limits. With Dayton Ward, his work includes stories for the Star Trek: Tales of the Dominion War and Star Trek: Constellations anthologies, the Star Trek: The Next Generation novels A Time to Sow and A Time to Harvest, ten installments of the original eBook series Star Trek: S.C.E. and Star Trek: Corps of Engineers, the first installment of the Star Trek: Mere Anarchy mini-series, and the Star Trek: Vanguard novel Summon the Thunder. A graduate of the University of Kansas, Kevin lives in Prairie Village, Kansas, with his wife, Michelle, and their three daughters, and is a senior writer for Hallmark Cards in Kansas City, Missouri.\n\nDAVID MACK is the author of numerous Star Trek novels, including the USA Today bestseller A Time to Heal and its companion volume, A Time to Kill. Mack’s other novels include Wolverine: Road of Bones;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine—Warpath;Star Trek: Vanguard—Harbinger, the first volume in a series that he developed with editor Marco Palmieri; Star Trek: S.C.E.—Wildfire; and numerous eBooks and short stories.\n\nBefore writing books, Mack co-wrote two episodes of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. He co-wrote the episode “Starship Down” with John J. Or-dover. Mack and Ordover teamed up again to pen the story treatment for the episode “It’s Only a Paper Moon,” for which Ronald D. Moore wrote the teleplay.\n\nAmong Mack’s upcoming projects are another installment in the Star Trek: Vanguard saga and a number of original novels.\n\nAn avid fan of the Canadian progressive-rock trio Rush, Mack has been to all of the band’s concert tours since 1982.\n\nMack currently resides in New York City with his wife, Kara.
