        "text": "THE HOTTEST MILITARY SCIENCE FICTION SERIES OF ALL TIME CONTINUES WITH A COLLECTION OF TALES SET IN DAVID WEBER’S NEW YORK TIMES BEST-SELLING HONORVERSE\n\nThe hottest military science fiction series of all time continues. The mission: to boldly explore David Weber’s Honorverse; to deliver all the action, courage, derring-do, and pulse-pounding excitement of space naval adventure with tales set in a world touched by the greatness of one epic heroine—Honor Harrington.\n\nNew Honorverse tales by Timothy Zahn & Thomas Pope, Jane Lindskold, Jan Kotouč, and Joelle Presby. Plus “First Victory,” an all-new novella by David Weber!\n\nIt’s always high noon on Proxima Centauri b. Original stories about the final frontier.\n\nYOU TELL ’EM THE SPACE COWPOKES A’COMIN’ AND HELL IS COMIN’ WITH ’EM!\n\nAdventure! Danger! Revenge! And a mail-order robot gunslinger in a wedding dress? Only in the wildest parts of space could this happen. It’s time again to get in your ramshackle rocket ship and journey to the universe’s western territories with this follow-up to Gunfight on Europa Station.\n\nMeet the employees of a space bordello as they’re drawn together to pull a con on a con. Or the crew filming a Western on a colony ship only to fight gravity and each other. Or a soldier on a backwater planet hiding from her past when it—and the military—finally tracks her down. Each voyage invokes the type of Western yarns you’ve loved before, but with a science fiction upgrade you’ll get to enjoy anew.\n\nTaking you on this ride is another set of astounding space opera authors such as Walter Jon Williams (Hardwired), Susan R. Matthews (Under Jurisdiction), Dayton Ward and Kevin Dilmore (Star Trek), Brenda Cooper (Project Earth), Milton Davis (Changa’s Safari), John E. Stith (Naught for Hire), and Peter J. Wacks (Caller of Lightning).\n\nTen tales of the West . . . not as it was, but as it might be!\n\nSECRETS REVEALED. HORRORS UNCOVERED. BODIES GO MISSING.\n\nBOOK TWO IN THE ISHMAEL JONES SERIES FROM BEST-SELLING AUTHOR SIMON R. GREEN\n\nIshmael Jones is called in to solve the mystery of a rogue secret agent who came in from the cold to spill all he knew, only to end up murdered in detention. Then his body goes missing. Then other people start dying. Has the murdered agent risen from the dead to get his revenge? How can all this be happening in one of the most secure interrogation centers? As Ishmael and his partner Penny dig deeper into what’s really going on, secrets are revealed and horrors are uncovered, but so many people are dying they have to wonder if anyone will be left to reveal the answer to.\n\nROGUE AGENTS SWEPT UP IN THE SEARCH FOR AN ANCIENT RELIC IN A UFO NOVEL AS ONLY TIM POWERS COULD WRITE IT!\n\nSebastian Vickery has learned something about UFOs that he shouldn’t have—and Naval Intelligence, desperate to silence him, orders his old partner, Agent Ingrid Castine, to trap him.\n\nBut Castine risks career, liberty, and maybe even life, to warn Vickery—and now they’re both fugitives, on the run from both the U.S. government and agents of the Russian GRU Directorate, which has its own uses for the UFO intelligence.\n\nWith the unlikely aid of a renegade Russian agent, a homeless Hispanic boy, and an eccentric old Flat-Earther, Vickery and Castine must find an ancient relic that spells banishment to the alien species, and then summon the things and use it against them—in a Samson-like confrontation that looks likely to kill them as well.\n\nSweeping from the Giant Rock monolith in the Mojave Desert to a cultist temple in the Hollywood Hills, from a monstrous apparition in the Los Angeles River to a harrowing midnight visitation on a boat off Long Beach Harbor, Stolen Skies is an alien-encounter novel like no other.\n\nThe Long-Awaited New Entry in Wen Spencer’s Popular Tinker Series\n\nThe war against the oni heats to a flashpoint even as Tinker learns that the enemy has a dangerous new weapon, the nactka. What’s more, the Stone Clan has sent its most famous warlords, the Harbingers, to take control of the allied war effort. Are these elves friends or foes? Tinker’s newfound baby siblings are up for grabs. The babies, though, are wood sprites and aren’t going to take things lying down. Team Mischief go!\n\nA relic of humanity’s violent past, this old weapon stands ready for the Emperor to wield.\n\nThe Galactic Imperium of the Myriad Worlds slumps into centuries of decadent peace enabled by a flood of advanced technology from the mysterious nonhuman “Shapers.” Among the great Families, only the once-mighty clan of Sinclair-Maru remembers the maxims of the warrior Emperor, Yung I, ready to defend the Imperium from any threat.\n\nStubbornly clinging to the Honor Code, Family prodigy Saef Sinclair-Maru finds himself in command of an outmoded, under-equipped frigate of the Imperial Fleet. With spies and assassins on every side, trusting only in his considerable skill and the bizarre competence of his companion, Inga, Saef must complete his mission, restore the greatness of his Family, and uncover the chilling plot meant to extinguish humanity’s light from the galaxy.\n\nAll males born in The Tharn’s Lands are twins. One adventurous twin, Rist, travels with sold ice to see how it is used by Warmlanders. After trouble with the Solar Priests, he has to travel farther downriver, where he encounters a two-thousand-foot waterfall and a vast lowland below. Making good his escape, he finds himself in the Sisterdom of ShadowFall, a domain within Motherland, a yet more advanced matriarchal civilization. Through demonstrated skills and persistence, he overcomes prejudice and barriers, distinguishing himself as a heroic warrior.\n\nRist’s twin, Rusk, is present back home when others uncover a large green cylinder from The Ice. This eventually is discovered to be an ancient flying craft operated by a Developing Intelligence Rusk will call Una. Rusk goes downriver to search and find Rist. Adventures ensue, resulting in a return to The Tharn’s Lands and a revolution there.\n\nFrom their primitive, mist-bound homeland at the foot of receding glaciers, to warmer and more civilized lands downriver and below, twin diminutive “bird-rider” warriors venture southward, taking with them the seeds of revelation and revolution. On the Moon, human colonies have likewise evolved. Those two worlds after the next Ice Age are very different places from today, but human emotions, personalities, and reactions remain unchanged.\n\nThe Thaw Trilogy is a tale of future conflicts—the clash of ancient institutions and ancient technologies on an unfamiliar Earth, and remnant human colonies on Earth’s Moon.\n\nThe Thaw Trilogy, incorporates three stories that first appeared in Analog—“Thaw” (July/August 2013), “Flow” (November 2014 - Hugo nominated), and “Fall” (July/August 2016)."
