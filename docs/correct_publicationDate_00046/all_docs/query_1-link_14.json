        "text": "What Judgments Come is a Star Trek novel.\n\nDescription[]\n\nOperation Vanguard has risked countless lives and sacrificed entire worlds to unlock the secrets of the Shedai, an extinct alien civilization whose technology can shape the future of the galaxy. Now, Starfleet's efforts have roused the vengeful Shedai from their aeons of slumber. As the Taurus Reach erupts with violence, hundreds of light-years away, on \"The Planet of Galactic Peace,\" Ambassador Jetanien and his counterparts from the Klingon and Romulan empires struggle to avert war by any means necessary. But Jetanien discovers their mission may have been designed to fail all along… Meanwhile, living in exile on an Orion ship is the one man who can help Starfleet find an ancient weapon that can stop the Shedai: Vanguard's former commanding officer, Diego Reyes.\n\nThe end of the epic saga begins.\n\nSummary[]\n\nApril 2270[]\n\nTimothy Pennington goes to visit Diego Reyes on Caldos II where he was silently sequestered after being removed from Vanguard. Pennington wants to know about the events surrounding the end of Project Vanguard. Though he knows the story will never be allowed to be published, Reyes begins telling him what he knows.\n\n2268, Vanguard[]\n\nAboard the Omari Ekon, Pennington tries to find out from Reyes what happened to him between when his prison transport was destroyed and when he resurfaced aboard the Omari Ekon; he also wants to know why/how Reyes betrayed Starfleet by giving the Klingons information about Vanguard station. Reyes replies that he never betrayed Starfleet but that his relaying information about Starbase 47 was motivated by survival and to prevent the Klingons from hurting people during their raid. When Pennington leaves the Orion ship, he meets with T'Prynn who sent him to survey Reyes' situation and seek his cooperation.\n\nCervantes Quinn is back to being a brawling, drunken bar fly. When Pennington tries to reconnect with his friend, Quinn is confrontational and pushes him away.\n\nAdmiral Nogura and his senior staff wish to extract Reyes but Holly Moyer, the senior JAG officer, reminds them that such an operation would be illegal. Serrosel ch'Nayla and T'Prynn tell Nogura that Reyes has indicated his willingness to cooperate with Starfleet. Nogura approves using Reyes to find out where Ganz obtained the Mirdonyae Artifact he delivered to Vanguard.\n\nNogura arranges to have Doctor Ezekiel Fisher conduct a medical exam of Reyes during which the doctor injects him with a microscopic transceiver that allows Reyes to receive undetectable messages from T'Prynn. Reyes agrees to retrieve the Omari Ekon's navigational logs.\n\nThe crystalline polyhedron containing the captured Shedai Wanderer has been transferred to the USS Lovell where Ming Xiong is attempting to communicate with her. The Wanderer is aware of their efforts and senses the Shedai imprisoned in the other crystal but she is busy figuring out how to escape and doesn't desire to communicate.\n\nReyes and T'Prynn try to access the Omari Ekon's logs through an electronic poker game on the large gaming deck. Their efforts fail but they glean information on the computer's security system. Nogura approves a second attempt. Meanwhile, Starfleet sends in two operatives from Vanguard's security personnel to extract Reyes without informing Vanguard's senior staff, including Nogura, about the attempt. Reyes cooperates with the officers as they under orders to kill him if he does not. The officers are killed in the attempt and Reyes is caught by the Orions. Ganz fumes over the incident and decides to have Reyes killed against Neera's orders. T'Prynn becomes aware of this and has Reyes extract the navigational logs before Ganz can make his move. With transport inhibitors in place, the only was off the ship is through the station gangway.\n\nXiong tries again to contact the Wanderer who continues to ignore him. Once again she comes in contact with the other Shedai who tells her that he is the first Shedai, named the Progenitor. He tells the Wanderer to patiently wait for an opportunity to escape.\n\nReyes fights his way off the Omari Ekon. A fire fight erupts between the Orions and Starfleet on the gangway. Intelligence officer ch'Nayla is killed in the exchange; Pennington loses an arm protecting Reyes and T'Prynn. Reyes kills Ganz, shooting off his head.\n\nThe Omari-Ekon soon departs from Vanguard. Reyes is placed under house arrest until he can be debriefed. Pennington has his arm amputated; later T'Prynn mind melds with him to relieve his phantom pain.\n\nXiong and T'Prynn use the captured navigational logs to track down the origin of the Mirdonaye Artifact to the Eremar system which is the former seat of the T'kon Empire. Nogura plans to dispatch the USS Sagittarius to investigate the system in two weeks once it is done undergoing maintenance in the station docking bay.\n\nThe Nimbus III colony collapses amid riots and deaths, notably the Romulan senator D'Tran. Jetanian and Lugok agree to keep trying, even though it seems a lost cause.\n\nAs Xiong and the Lovell's crew attempt to contact the Wanderer again, she begins to use the energies of the communication signal to strengthen herself and weaken the crystal's energy field. She quickly breaks out and begins attacking the containment chamber. The crew evacuate the secondary hull. After the Wanderer pierces the hull, the Lovell severs its secondary hull. Moments later, the Wanderer destroys the secondary hull and immediately attacks the spherical primary hull. The Sagittarius comes to the Lovell's aid and the Wanderer flees the system, vowing to herself to return and destroy her enemies.\n\nQuinn refuses to go on any more missions for Starfleet and T'Prynn.\n\nHostilities between the Klingons and Tholians in the Taurus Reach escalate as it becomes inevitable that the three powers in the sector will openly clash. Meanwhile Nogura is concerned about another Shedai attack on Vanguard.\n\nReyes invites Fisher to join him on Caldos II before being secreted to his forced exile.\n\nApril 2270[]\n\nReyes asks Pennington what happened after he left and when Pennington left Vanguard. Pennington responds, \"I was there until the end, mate. The bitter, bloody end.\"\n\nReferences[]\n\nCharacters[]\n\nVanguard personnel and residents[]\n\nAllie • Jon Cooper • Ezekiel Fisher • Joe Gianetti • Toby Greenfield • Mary Jane Hetzlein • Haniff Jackson • Carol Marcus • Holly Moyer • Serrosel ch'Nayla • Heihachiro Nogura • Tim Pennington • Cervantes Quinn • T'Prynn • Marshall Watts • Ming Xiong\n\nReferenced only\n\nGinther • Nezrene • Tom Walker\n\nDefiant personnel[]\n\nThomas Blair • Jane Hamilton • Clarissa Nyn • Kamau Mbugua • Ravishankar Sabapathy • Terry Shull • T'Lehr • Trethishavu th'Vlene\n\nReferenced only\n\nStevok\n\nLovell personnel[]\n\nMahmud al-Khaled • Jeffrey Anderson • Kurt Davis • Jessica Diamond • Moves-With-Burning-Grace • Brian O'Halloran • Daniel Okagawa • Folanir Pzial • Araev zh'Rhun • Sasha Rodriguez\n\nReferenced only\n\nBernd Perplies • Frances Porter\n\nOmari-Ekon personnel[]\n\nDrev • Ganz • Lekkar • Nakaal • Neera • Tonzak\n\nReferenced only\n\nZett Nilric • Trianna\n\nNimbus III residents[]\n\nD'tran • Jetanien • Kanjar • Lugok, son of Breg • Sergio Moreno • Carla Schiappacasse • Tara Varney\n\nReferenced only\n\nAdinolfi • S'anra • Thies\n\nOther characters[]\n\nFestrene • Hazthrene • Ja'tesh • Kraloq • Shedai Progenitor • Diego Reyes • Tozhene • Shedai Wanderer •\n\nReferenced only\n\nApollo • Shedai Apostate • Sakud Armnoj • Lora Brummer • Oriana D'Amato • Rana Desai • Hallie Gannon • God • Garold Hicks • Mike Ilucci • Kera • Atish Khatami • James T.
