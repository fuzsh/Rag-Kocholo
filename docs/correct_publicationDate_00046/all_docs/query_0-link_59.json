For the love of god, Montressor!\"\n\nand\n\nI would take a second job as a Pocket Books proofreader if it meant I could go to Shore Leave every year. Like JD, it's only a matter of when I go to Shore Leave, not if.\n\nAmateurs! Some people do not get \"groveling\" properly!\n\nI'd shine his shoes.\n\nHell, I'd lick his shoes.\n\nOk, maybe that's going a little too far...\n\nJim Johnson said:\n\nWhich would also guarantee that the hotel would have to remodel, perhaps removing that disgusting carpet.\n\nWell, I did say \"judicious.\" If employed with the proper quantity and placement, the problem could be solved, and we wouldn't even have to close the bar.\n\nHowever, the notion of forcing a replacement for that carpet has its appeal....\n\nAllyn Gibson said:\n\nOr you can be like me, and just walk up and heckle them.\n\nI should have sent you over to that annoying woman in the other corner who chose to take up a full couch in the bar with her partner, and who got real pissy when people wanted to share the couch in a very crowded bar with very limited seating. She nearly got that plate shoved down her throat.\n\nCome to think of it, the explosives would have worked well on her too.\n\nTBonz said:\n\nThe thing that hosed me this year would be the extra rent-a-car cost on top of airfare, hotel, etc. Last year, I split it with two other ladies which made me able (barely!) to swing the trip.\n\nThat's not counting the therapy I needed after seeing that gawdawful carpet. Or hearing that lame band that took up valuable bar seating.\n\nMaybe we can swing it again another year. Especially since it doesn't look like I'm going to WorldCon this year and may be able to save the $$$.\n\nI'll buy you a pair of sunglasses for the carpet! As for the other-- yeah, explosives would work .\n\nFor everyone's edification, here's the current Trek author guest list:\n\nEmily P.
