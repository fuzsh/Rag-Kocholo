        "text": "“Hi Diddle Riddle”/ “Smack in the Middle”\n\nWritten by Lorenzo Semple Jr.\n\nDirected by Robert Butler\n\nSeason 1, Episodes 1 & 2\n\nProduction code 6028\n\nOriginal air dates: January 12 & 13, 1966\n\nThe Bat-signal: We open at the Gotham City World’s Fair, specifically at the exhibit for the Republic of Moldavia, where the prime minister is holding a “friendship luncheon.” A cake is brought out, which is adorned with two figurines, one of a guy in a silly hat and overalls that is, I guess, supposed to symbolize Moldavia, shaking hands with Uncle Sam.\n\nHowever, as the PM cuts into the cake, it explodes. It’s a small explosion, enough to ruin the cake (too bad, it looked yummy) and also shoot a message into the air, which then parachutes down. It’s a piece of paper with a riddle on it: “Why is an orange like a bell?”\n\nThe cops on the scene bring the riddle back to police headquarters, where Commissioner Gordon, Chief O’Hara, and a ton of other cops are all standing around with their thumbs in their ears. The prank indicates that the Riddler is back in town, and none of the gathered police think they can handle him. So Gordon goes to the red phone that will call Batman.\n\nAt Wayne Manor, Alfred gets the phone and says he’ll fetch Batman. In the sitting room, Bruce Wayne is speaking to a bunch of folks on the subject of helping fund anti-crime centers. He briefly laments that such places didn’t exist when his parents were killed by a criminal, but he’s interrupted by Alfred. After making excuses, he meets up with his ward, Dick Grayson, and they go to answer the phone. Upon being informed that the Riddler is at it again, he assures Gordon that he’ll meet him at police headquarters. He hangs up, pulls back Shakespeare’s head to reveal a dial that slides a bookcase aside to reveal a very clearly labelled pair of poles—one says “BRUCE,” the other says, “DICK,” and the wall behind says “ACCESS TO BAT-CAVE VIA BAT-POLES.” You gotta love the thoroughness.\n\nBy the time they’ve slid down to the Batcave, they’re in costume as Batman and Robin. They hop into the Batmobile and zoom off to Gotham City. They park in front of police headquarters and run inside.\n\nRobin solves the riddle: they both must be peeled/pealed. (“What idiots we are!” says Chief O’Hara, and truer words…) Batman thinks Riddler’s target might be the Peale Art Gallery. And given that the cops couldn’t even figure out a stupid riddle, Batman advises that they sit this one out and let him and Robin handle it.\n\nThey drive to the gallery, parking at the back. Then a recording of the Riddler calls the Bat-phone in the Batmobile and asks Batman to riddle him this: there are three men in a boat with four cigarettes and no matches. How do they manage to smoke? (How Riddler got that number is left as a mystery.)\n\nUnable to solve the riddle, they climb up the back wall to find the Riddler holding a gun to the head of Gideon Peale, the owner of the gallery, who’s handing him a cross. They burst through the window and put the Bat-cuffs on him for stealing the cross at gunpoint—at which point, two photographers show up, and Peale explains that the Riddler loaned the cross to the gallery for an exhibit, and the “gun” was a lighter. (Robin then figures out the riddle: throw one cigarette overboard, and it made the boat a cigarette lighter.)\n\nThe Riddler asks what it is that no man wants to have, yet no man wants to lose. Robin answers, “A lawsuit!” which is just what the Riddler is hitting Batman with. It’s a one-million-dollar lawsuit for assault, slander, and false arrest.\n\nBruce checks through his father’s law books, but can’t find anything useful. The Riddler has a case, and the suit will force Batman to reveal his true identity. Alfred reminds him how much the truth will devastate Dick’s aunt, Harriet Cooper. They go down to the Bat-cave and examine the legal documents the Riddler handed Batman, and they find two hidden messages: First, when is the time of a clock like the whistle of a train? (When it’s two to two.) Second, what has neither flesh, bone, nor nail but has four fingers and a thumb? (A glove.) Robin figures that it’s an address: 222 Glover Avenue, which is the address of a new discotheque called What a Way to Go-Go. Batman goes in alone (Robin is underage; he stays with the Batmobile), telling the maître-d that he’ll stay at the bar, as he doesn’t want to attract attention. (That ship, of course, has already sailed, as the entire bar is gawping at him.)\n\nHowever, several of the staff are members of the Mole Hill Gang, whom the Riddler is using as his henchmen—as is Molly, a redhead who asks Batman to dance (after hitting him with a riddle of her own). Batman drinks his fresh-squeezed orange juice (which the Mole Hill Gang has spiked) and dances with her until he collapses. Robin runs to help him, but the Riddler hits him with a tranq dart before he can even get out of the Batmobile.\n\nLuckily, Robin was smart enough to flip over the label that says “START BUTTON” over the label that says “ANTI-THEFT ACTIVATOR,” so when the Riddler tries to steal the Bat-mobile, the “start button” instead causes the exhaust pipes to shoot loud fireworks. Since he can’t steal the car, the Riddler settles for stealing the sidekick, as he, Molly, and the Mole Hill Gang take the unconscious Robin into the tunnels to their underground lair, where the Riddler puts Robin’s head in a vise and starts closing it slowly.\n\nBatman is conscious, but still woozy from the mickeyed OJ, so he doesn’t notice the Bat-signal, and the cops (who take his keys away, as he’s in no condition to drive) think it’s better not to tell him, especially since he’s so busy lamenting the loss of Robin.\n\nBy morning, Batman has recovered, and he’s trying to locate Robin, to no avail. Down at the Mole Hill Gang hideout, we discover that the vise wasn’t to crush Robin’s head, but hold it still while the Riddler made a mold of it. He then wakes Robin up and tricks him into contacting Batman via Gordon to pose him two more riddles: What kind of pins are used in soup? (Terrapins.) What was Joan of Arc made of? (She was Maid of Orleans.) Batman figures out the clue: the old Turtle Mill on Orleans Cove. He hops into the Batmobile and drives off.\n\nMolly has changed into a duplicate of Robin’s costume, and she’s used the mold to form a face mask. The Riddler gives her Robin’s belt, and then they head to Orleans Cove and activate the homing transmitter. Batman chases them down, disabling the Riddler’s car—but Riddler was expecting it, and he and Molly wore helmets. Molly lies on the ground pretending to be hurt as Robin while the Riddler runs off, and Batman takes her to the Batmobile.\n\nOnce in the Batcave, Molly reveals herself—but Batman knew it was her, as the breathing holes in the mold made the nostrils too big in the mask. Batman also used the hidden Bat-laser beam to burn off her revolver’s firing pin.\n\nMolly panics and runs to the atomic pile that serves as the Batmobile’s nuclear power source. Batman tries to rescue her, but she falls into the reactor and is killed.\n\nBatman goes to police HQ, where Gordon has a recording of the phone conversation between Batman and the Riddler from earlier. Batman and Gordon listen to it, along with O’Hara, and Batman hears subway trains in the background. Using the mobile crime computer, he figures out where the call came from (how is unclear), and heads to the subway station, using an explosive to gain ingress.\n\nHe almost captures the Riddler, but he manages to escape by cutting Batman off with bullet-proof glass. After Riddler and the Mole Hill Gang depart, Robin reassures him that he knows what the next caper will be, because he overheard the Riddler’s riddles for this one: how many sides does a circle have? (Two—inside and outside.) What President of the United States wore the biggest hat? (The one with the biggest head.) It means he’s going to rob the head office of the Gotham City National Bank. (Just go with it.)\n\nHowever, the Riddler and the Mole Hill Gang are tunneling under the Moldavian exhibit at the World’s Fair. They pump laughing gas into the air vents, and then Riddler (wearing an elephant-shaped gas mask, because, why not?) goes up and tells awful jokes, which the PM and his guests only laugh at because of the gas, and then they fall unconscious.\n\nThe Mole Hill Gang join the Riddler, preparing to steal a mammoth made entirely of old postage stamps—but then Batman and Robin burst out of it, Batman having realized that Robin screwed up the riddles. (“A Trojan mammoth?” laments the Riddler.) Batman and Robin engage in fisticuffs with the Mole Hill Gang and the Riddler (with everyone still wearing gas masks, so it’s way easier to work in the stunt doubles), with the Dynamic Duo eventually being triumphant, though the Riddler gets away.\n\nThe lawsuit is dropped, as Riddler never appears in court. Bruce and Dick discuss the case, and while the Riddler did get away, Bruce is satisfied that they stopped an international incident by preventing the theft of the mammoth (though he never mentions the damage done to the artifact by Batman and Robin hiding inside it and then bursting out of it). However, he deeply regrets Molly’s death.\n\nFetch the Bat-shark-repellant! We get our first look at all the regular toys—the Batcave, the Batmobile (with its emergency Bat-turn-lever and Bat-ray projector and hidden Bat-laser beam), the Bat-phone (the one in Gordon’s office, the one in Wayne Manor, and the bat-shaped one in the Batmobile), the Bat-signal, and the Bat-a-rang so they can Bat-climb up the wall. We also get the Bat-laser gun that Batman uses to undo the cage over the window, the Bat-hook that he hangs it on, because Robin shouldn’t just drop the cage to the ground from that height (“Pedestrian safety!”), the Bat-scope (which Robin can use to spy on the discotheque in a manner that is probably illegal), the Batostat Anti-Fire Activator, the Bat-gauge, and of course the Bat-cuffs.\n\nHoly #@!%$, Batman! When Bruce asks Dick if he wants to go “fishing,” Dick says, “Holy barracuda!” When the Riddler reveals that his gun is a lighter, Robin cries, “Holy ashtray!” And when Batman blasts his way into the Riddler’s hideout, Robin yells, rather boringly, “Holy smoke!” but when Riddler seals them in with bullet-proof glass, he cries, “Holy showcase!”\n\nGotham City’s finest. Gordon actually asks each of his top cops if any of them can handle the Riddler. They all look away shame-facedly, and Gordon then calls upon Batman. However, Gordon does do one useful thing: record the phone conversation between Batman and Riddler, thus providing Batman with the clue to find Robin.\n\nThese two episodes also have the only appearances of Inspector Basch (played by Michael Fox).\n\nNo sex, please, we’re superheroes. Batman tells Molly that she interests him “strangely,” and he does the Batusi with her after drinking the spiked orange juice. He deeply laments her death.\n\nSpecial Guest Villain. Frank Gorshin makes his debut as the Riddler, arguably the best of Batman’s gallery of rogues, and certainly your humble rewatcher’s favorite. He’ll be back in “A Riddle a Day Keeps the Riddler Away”/”When the Rat’s Away the Mice will Play” later this season.\n\nJill St. John also gets billing as a special guest star, the only time someone other than the villain is credited at the beginning of the episode.\n\nNa-na na-na na-na na-na na. “Poor deluded girl! If only she’d have let me save her! What a terrible way to go-go.”\n\nBatman deciding that the violent death of a human being is a good occasion to make a pun related to the place where he first met her.\n\nTrivial matters: This episode was discussed on The Batcave Podcast episode 1 by host John S. Drew with special guest chum, New York Times best-selling author Dayton Ward.\n\nThis episode was based on Batman #171 (May 1965), a story entitled “Remarkable Ruse of the Riddler” by Gardner Fox, Sheldon Moldoff, and Joe Giella.\n\nThe cliffhanger voiceover simply said to tune in tomorrow, “Same time, same channel,” without the ever-popular Bat- prefix.\n\nGordon’s office looks different from how it will appear in subsequent episodes, with the bookcase in a different location, and no sign of the larger exit.\n\nThis is the only time Bruce ever mentions his parents and their violent death, the catalyst for his becoming Batman.\n\nThe opening shots of the Gotham City World’s Fair used footage from the 1964 World’s Fair in New York City.\n\nBatman’s dance is only referred to as the Batusi in William Dozier’s voiceover at the top of “Smack in the Middle” that shows scenes from “Hi Diddle Riddle.” However, the dance became quite popular for a bit there…\n\nPow! Biff! Zowie! “Riddle me twice, Batman!” The first part of this initial two-parter serves as an excellent introduction to the series, giving us the standard setup, showing us a moralistic Batman who is mindful of the law and doing the right thing, fiercely protective of Robin, and a user of tons of gadgets. We get the Batmobile startup sequence, the meeting with the commissioner and O’Hara, climbing up a wall, and the climactic fight scene.\n\nBut the best thing we get is the Riddler. Of all Batman’s villains, Frank Gorshin is the finest, completely throwing himself into the part, from the Riddler’s acrobatic gyrations in his most manic bits, to his wide-eyed glee in his quieter moments, his odd gestures, and his constant giggling. Gorshin fully inhabits the role, and it’s an absolute joy to watch.\n\nThe riddles are, of course, quite lame, but to some degree, that’s part of the point. Batman even states in Gordon’s office that the Riddler gets his enjoyment from matching wits with Batman more than anything.\n\nUnfortunately, Part 2 drags somewhat. Where “Hi Diddle Riddle” is well paced and includes some great moments (Riddler’s lawsuit, the Batusi, the hilarious ineffectiveness of the Gotham City Police Department), “Smack in the Middle” is slow and draggy. Molly’s death is clumsy and unconvincing (tragedy is a bad fit for the show’s daffy pop-art sensibility, and the show will stay away from character deaths for the most part going forward, probably in part due to how badly it fell over here), there are too many scenes of the Batmobile driving through the mountain roads, and Riddler and the disguised Molly driving on the same roads, and it’s just endless. For that matter, Molly’s death also takes too long, and the lawsuit plot, which actually promised to be an interesting twist on the usual hero/villain interaction, was completely dropped until it was waved off at the very end. In addition, the cliffhanger is kind of weak, although it’s possible that this one was written before they realized they’d be doing it as two separate episodes; indeed, this two-parter feels like it was written to be a one-hour episode, not two half-hour ones.\n\nStill, this is a good introduction to the series, setting the tone for the show going forward.\n\nBat-rating: 7\n\nKeith R.A.

The umbrellas all then open on their own inside the store, spraying gas, blowing fireworks and confetti, and making horrible noises and spitting out gas and comedy snakes. At police HQ, O’Hara says it’s like a fingerprint—the Penguin, who has an umbrella fetish, and he was just released from prison three days ago. Gordon picks up the Bat-phone.\n\nAt Wayne Manor, Dick is struggling with his French lessons. Bruce reminds him that language is the key to world peace. Dick allows as how that’s true, but his attempt to conjugate French verbs is interrupted by the Bat-phone. After telling Aunt Harriet that they’re going fishing (didn’t they use that cover story last week?), they head off in the Batmobile to Gotham City.\n\nBatman finds it curious that there was no actual robbery, even though the umbrella thing was a perfect setup for one. Curious as to the Penguin’s state of mind before being released from prison, Batman interviews Warden Crichton, a progressive thinker on reforms in prison. For the week leading up to inmates’ release, they’re permitted to wear civilian clothing, and the warden also surreptitiously videotapes them in their cells during that period. They play the tape in Gordon’s office, and it’s clear that Penguin is completely unreformed—he’s been spending his time in prison trying (and failing) to come up with a plan for a new caper.\n\nPenguin’s henchman (also in his civvies including, hilariously, his domino mask) contemplates how totally awesome it would be if Batman was also a criminal. That prompts Penguin to come up with an idea involving umbrellas—but the henchman discovers the hidden camera before he can speak his plan out loud.\n\nBatman checks the city records to find any new umbrella factories that have been opened in the past few days—they find three, one of which was opened by “K.G. Bird,” a.k.a. “cagey bird,” a.k.a. Penguin.\n\nAt the K.G. Bird & Co. umbrella factory, Penguin explains his plan: nothing. He’s going to keep doing crazy umbrella-related stunts with no actual crime, and wait for Batman to “deduce” his next move, and use that as his caper. His next umbrella giveaway is at a bank. Batman and Robin show up and collect all the umbrellas under an asbestos pad (really a normal moving pad, but whatever) to protect everyone from the pyrotechnics.\n\nThe Dynamic Duo head to K.G. Bird & Co. to confront Penguin, but they’re frustrated by the fact that he hasn’t committed an actual crime yet.\n\nAfter they leave, Penguin’s henchmen launch a giant orange umbrella onto the street, which has a normal sized umbrella dangling from the handle. Batman climbs up to retrieve it, and it’s got a plaque on it: a special Batbrella. They take it back to the Batcave to examine it, but they find nothing. So Batman decides to take a spider-shaped bug and visit the umbrella shop as Bruce Wayne and leave the bug there so they can eavesdrop on his plans.\n\nBruce takes his father’s old umbrella in for repair, and tries to plant the bug—but he sets off an alarm. Penguin throws a net on him and gasses him with his umbrella. Assuming it’s industrial espionage by a rival umbrella factory, he has his thugs throw Bruce into the furnace.\n\nThe heat of the furnace causes Bruce’s shoes to smoke, which wakes him up. He has a cigarette lighter, which he tosses into the furnace. The butane in the lighter causes the furnace to go boom and allow Bruce to escape. Penguin lets him go, as he believes Bruce to be a criminal himself. Bruce returns to the Batcave, and he and Robin continue to muster their brainpower to try to figure out what the (nonexistent) clue is in the Batbrella.\n\nAt 6pm, Penguin activates the listening device in the Batbrella. (Why he waited this long is anybody’s guess.) Batman and Robin are studying the Batbrella. At first, the Dynamic Duo think that the colors symbolize the colors of a jeweled meteorite, but the museum where it’s housed is impenetrable.\n\nThey look at the Batbrella some more, and Robin notes that the colors look like a beautiful dawn. Then it hits Batman: Dawn Robbins, the actress, is in town filming a picture called The Mockingbird, produced by Ward Eagle, and she’s staying at the penthouse of the Pelican Arms—it’s the perfect Penguin ornithological crime (a turn of phrase not actually used in this episode, more’s the pity)!\n\nBatman tells Robin how easily Penguin could kidnap her, and Penguin and his henchmen are taking notes. Heroes and villains each separately head out toward the Pelican Arms. Batman and Robin head up to her penthouse (which is a relief to the bored actress, who is weary of her life as a starlet because nothing exciting ever happens) to protect her.\n\nAcross the way, Penguin and his thugs use a Penguin Rope and umbrellas to rappel into the penthouse and gasses Robbins and her manager. Batman and Robin ambush him, wearing gas masks, but then Penguin activates the Penguin Magnet, which attaches the pair to the wall via their metal utility belts. Penguin escapes with Robbins, and asks for a ransom of $200,000, to be delivered in the front hall of Wayne Manor. Batman and Robin intend to hide in the two suits of armor in that hall and ambush the Penguin once Robbins is safe. However, Penguin hears all that over the bug in the Batbrella.\n\nPenguin’s thugs gas Alfred, and then Penguin himself gasses both suits of armor, rendering Batman and Robin both unconscious. They leave Robbins (still sedated) next to Alfred on the couch. They repair to the K.G. Bird factory to divide the loot—but then Batman and Robin ambush him. Penguin used the same words Batman did when he kidnapped Robbins, so Batman realized that Penguin had been eavesdropping. They put dummies in the armor and waited back at the factory to take him down.\n\nAfter a particularly goofy umbrella-swordfight, they’re taken down, and are sent back to Crichton.\n\nBruce holds a society gathering in the mansion. Gordon is among the guests—as is Robbins.\n\nFetch the Bat-shark-repellant! When the penthouse proves too high to throw the Bat-a-rang, Batman uses the Batzooka to shoot the Batrope up. (One of Penguin’s thugs instantly recognizes the sound of the Batzooka, which makes you wonder how often he uses the fershlugginer thing.) The Penguin, not to be outdone, has his own gadgets, all named after himself.\n\nHoly #@!%$, Batman! Upon seeing the Penguin in his civvies while in prison, he cries out, “Holy haberdashery!” (The Penguin is wearing his hat.) When they “discover” that Penguin’s scheme is to kidnap Dawn Robbins, he cries out, “Holy popcorn!” And when Penguin activates his Penguin magnet, Robin’s responses are “Holy lodestone!” and “Holy flypaper!”\n\nGotham City’s finest. As with last time, Gordon asks for volunteers to tackle the Penguin, but O’Hara tells him to stop being silly, and just call Batman already. However, Gordon anticipates Batman’s desire to speak to Crichton, and flies him in by helicopter. He makes up for this rare burst of competence by it never occurring to him that Penguin would rent an umbrella factory under an alias.\n\nNo sex, please, we’re superheroes. Dawn Robbins is doing a photo shoot for Fungirl magazine. She thinks Batman is “sorta cute,” and later is quite melancholy at Bruce’s party, as she has fallen for Batman, whom she’ll probably never see again. It is never revealed whether or not Bruce decided to try to comfort her in her misery…\n\nSpecial Guest Villain. Burgess Meredith debuts his role as the Penguin. He’ll be back in “The Penguin Goes Straight” / “Not Yet He Ain’t” later this season. Ernest Borgnine was apparently considered for the role.\n\nNa-na na-na na-na na-na na. “What a stupid thing to say.”\n\nRobin’s apt and regretful utterance upon being reminded that prisoners actually are supposed to get released after their sentence is over.\n\nTrivial matters: This episode was discussed on The Batcave Podcast episode 2 by host John S. Drew with special guest chum, Paul K. Bisson.\n\nThe story was based on the 1965 comic book story “Partners in Plunder” in Batman #169 by Ed Herron, Sheldon Moldoff, & Joe Giella.\n\nWe actually get the standard explanation of why Batman chooses to dress like a bat—because the form of a giant bat is scary to the cowardly criminal mind—but we get it from Gordon at the party, not Batman (or Bruce).\n\nPenguin mentions a hideaway in Alaska, a rare occasion when any regular character on the show admits to the possibility of being away from Gotham City.\n\nIn addition to Penguin, this episode marks the debut of David Lewis’ Warden Crichton, who will continue to manage Gotham State Penitentiary through all three seasons.\n\nPow! Biff! Zowie! “The baleful bird is about to chirp!” What I particularly love about this episode is the same thing I liked about the Riddler lawsuit angle last time, only this time the twist on the expected hero-stops-villain dynamic is actually followed through on. Penguin doesn’t need to come up with a scheme, he just has to leave Batman with a sufficiently multifaceted clue—an umbrella of many colors—and his deductive powers combine with his vivid imagination (not to mention his ability to jump to absurd conclusions) to provide him with the very crime he is trying to prevent.\n\nIt’s kind of amusing that the oh-so-lawful Batman actually considers the illegal wiretapping of a private citizen. Keep in mind that at this point, Penguin is not a criminal; Batman himself said that he’s paid his debt to society, having served his sentence. At this stage in the game, he hasn’t actually committed a crime, certainly not one that warrants a warrantless eavesdrop. And then Penguin uses the exact same thing to actually commit his crime.\n\nBurgess Meredith is far less broad in this first appearance—his trademark “waugh! waugh!” is nowhere to be heard, and his waddle is less pronounced when he walks. His sneering tone, aided by the cigarette holder that is perpetually held together by his teeth, is quite familiar, though, but the characterization is more aristocratic, befitting the character’s costuming.\n\nYou also have to wonder if writer Lorenzo Semple Jr. was indulging in a bit of social commentary on prison reform, with Crichton’s constant references to his progressive policies—policies that are abject failures with the Penguin. The decade prior to this episode being aired was when U.S. prisons first attempted a greater emphasis on corrections and rehabilitation rather than punishment.\n\nBat-rating: 8\n\nKeith R.A.

Come on by and say hi!\n\n“The Joker is Wild” / “Batman is Riled”\n\nWritten by Robert Dozier\n\nDirected by Don Weis\n\nSeason 1, Episodes 5 & 6\n\nProduction code 8709\n\nOriginal air dates: January 26 & 27, 1966\n\nThe Bat-signal: We open at Gotham State Penitentiary—”one of the state’s busier locations”—where one of Crichton’s reforms is a softball game. The Joker is pitching for his team. Among the spectators is O’Hara, who’s impressed with the job Crichton has done on the Joker—the notion of the Joker taking time away from prison-break-plotting to play softball. (Actually, O’Hara says “baseball,” even though they’re playing softball. Not the sharpest knife in the drawer, is the chief.)\n\nAfter throwing two strikeouts, the catcher switches the balls with one under his chest protector. When the batter hits it, there’s an explosion, and a spring under the pitcher’s mound releases, and sends the Joker flying over the wall. (How the Joker contrived to get a giant spring under the pitcher’s mound of a wide-open field in a prison is left as an exercise for the viewer.)\n\nO’Hara calls Gordon, both of them taking every opportunity to make “he sprung himself” jokes, and then Gordon calls Batman. Dick is in the midst of his piano lessons with Aunt Harriet, Bruce sitting nearby looking incredibly pained at his awful Chopin. The Bat-phone comes as a relief from his crappy ivory-tickling, and Batman and Robin head down the Bat-poles, into the Batmobile, and off to police HQ.\n\nJoker left a bust of himself at the base of the spring under the pitcher’s mound. Batman and Robin deduce that it’s a clue to other places that have busts on pedestals, like museums—specifically the Gotham City Museum of Modern Art which is today opening a Comedians Hall of Fame exhibit.\n\nThey drive to the museum, parking in front of a sign that says, “NO PARKING, G.C.P.D.”—Batman actually hesitates before parking there, but a uniformed officer tells him it’s okay and moves the sign. Inside, they order the museum to be cleared, but they enter to discover that the Joker is included in the exhibit. They go off to talk to the museum’s director, while security locks the museum up tight. The guard says it’s burglar-proof—nobody could break in.\n\nOnce the doors are closed, Joker himself emerges from inside the bust, as do his henchmen, who were hiding in the Stan Laurel, Oliver Hardy, W.C. Fields, and Ernie Kovacs busts. The Joker chortles with glee at outwitting Batman, and now they can steal the fabulous jewels! And then they run to the next gallery over, which is really and truly labelled “Hall of Fabulous Jewels.”\n\nTo Batman’s confusion, the director isn’t in his office. He then realizes that, while nobody could break in, someone could break out. They go back to the front entrance and then very easily break into the supposedly burglar-proof museum and then fisticuffs ensue. A sword comes loose from the wall and clunks Batman on the head, and Robin, sufficiently distracted by Batman’s plight, is captured by the henchmen.\n\nBut even as they head out, Batman is already conscious—but playing possum until he can toss a smoke bomb. Batman and Robin take care of the four thugs, but Joker gets away through an absurdly convenient trap door. He runs to his hideout under the Gotham Pier Amusement Park, swearing never again to be done in by Batman’s utility belt. So he’s created his own utility belt (which looks just like Batman’s, only with the Joker’s face on the buckle). Two more of his thugs, and his moll, Queenie, are impressed with the belt, and Joker hits on his next caper: stealing the S.S. Gotham, a new luxury liner launching Saturday.\n\nBruce and Dick meet with Gordon and O’Hara. Bruce is a majority stockholder in the Gotham Shipping Company, which owns the S.S. Gotham, and Gordon assures Bruce that Batman and Robin will be christening the boat, which also means the opening will be quite secure.\n\nCertainly more secure than having the police involved, given that a brick comes flying through the window, with a clown doll attached to it. Gordon goes to the Bat-phone to tell the caped crusader—leading to an uncomfortable exchange of glances between Bruce and Dick—but Alfred informs Gordon that Batman is out for the day. Bruce asks O’Hara if he can keep the doll as a souvenir, and even though it’s a weapon used in an attack on a law-enforcement headquarters, O’Hara hands it over to a civilian, thus destroying the chain of evidence. The chief then has the gall to speak ill of Bruce as someone who’d be of no help against the Joker, conveniently forgetting his own paralysis in the face of the villain.\n\nIn the Batcave, the Dynamic Duo examine the doll, but find no clues on it. It can’t indicate the circus—it left town weeks ago, according to Gordon—but there’s a production of Pagliacci being televised live in Gotham tonight.\n\nCut to the opera, where Batman unmasks the opera singer in the clown mask as actually being the Joker. (And he just sang “Vesti la Giubba,” which is pretty impressive.) But his costume also includes sneezing powder that emits from one of the buttons, and he sneezifies Batman and Robin, making them easy pickings for Joker’s thugs, who hold the Dynamic Duo.\n\nJoker tries to unmask Batman and Robin on television, but before he can do it, Batman manages to pull out another smoke bomb from his utility belt, using it to set off the sprinklers. Joker responds with a smoke bomb of his own. Batman chases him up to the catwalk, but Joker wraps him in colored paper and gets away.\n\nThey return to the Batcave to see a news report speculating that Batman and Robin may have met their match—and then Joker takes over the newscast and does an episode of What’s My Crime? to give “Fatman and the Boy Blunder” a hint as to his next caper. He indicates that it involves a belt and a switch (but not an electric switch), and also gives the hint: “What’s wrong with this sentence? ‘He who laughs last laughs good.'” Grammatically, that should end with “laughs well,” which clues them into Professor Laughwell, who’s just returned from Africa with a collection of masks and rare art. They head to the warehouse, climbing the wall to find Joker rummaging through the collection.\n\nThe Dynamic Duo burst in and fisticuffs ensue (surprisingly without sound effects), but the Joker gets away—but not before switching the Caped Crusader’s utility belt with a replica of Joker’s own. Batman throws a smoke bomb, which gives off fireworks, confetti, streamers, and signs reading, “PHOOEY ON BATMAN,” “POOR BOY WONDER,” and “HOORAY FOR THE JOKER.” This prompts Batman to say that he’s hit them “below the belt.”\n\nThe media has a field day, with Gotham City Times headlines all declaring the incompetence of Batman, Robin, and the police over the course of several days. Batman and Robin are stymied—they study the fake utility belt and find nothing, nor do they have any idea what the Joker’s next caper will be.\n\nJoker shows how he’ll stop Batman when they steal the luxury liner: a gag cork in the bottle of champagne that Batman and Robin will use to christen the S.S. Gotham. That evening, the Dynamic Duo arrive to christen the boat (Gordon starts the festivities despite the fact that Bruce Wayne hasn’t shown up yet, ha ha), despite the jeers of the crowd who want to know why they’re participating in silly photo-ops when there’s a Joker to be chased down. Gordon hands Batman the bottle, calling it “the finest French champagne,” as if there could possibly be any other kind of champagne. (If it’s not from the Champagne region of France, then it isn’t champagne, it’s sparkling wine.)\n\nBatman notices the jimmied cork, and then says he suddenly has a headache and takes a pill—telling Robin to take one, too, in case it’s contagious. Robin rightly scoffs at the notion of a contagious headache, but Batman says, “Doctor’s orders,” despite no doctor being available, and Robin shrugs and takes the pill.\n\nAs soon as Batman christens the boat, gas is released, rendering everyone unconscious. The gas-masked thugs carry Batman and Robin off to the hideout under the amusement park. Joker cuts in on a TV signal to broadcast from his hideout, requesting that the title to S.S. Gotham be turned over to him, or the Dynamic Duo will be executed on TV. (Interestingly enough, this time Joker evinces no interest in unmasking Batman and Robin like he did the last time he had them helpless on live TV.)\n\nBut the pills they took are universal drug antidotes (really!), and they stop playing possum and fisticuffs ensue (this time with sound effects, thus guaranteeing our heroes’ victory). The day is saved, and Bruce and Dick watch a newscast talking about how Gotham’s citizens will sleep soundly tonight. Dick then has to have another piano lesson, to his chagrin, though he’s mollified by Alfred’s offer of milk and cookies.\n\nFetch the Bat-shark-repellant! They study the doll with the hyper-spectrographic analyzer (no “bat” prefix), and Batman keeps a purple smoke bomb and a universal drug antidote in his utility belt.\n\nHoly #@!%$, Batman! When Bruce says he and Dick will be late for their “ballgame” (code for the Bat-phone), he says, “Holy Koufax!” a reference to contemporary Los Angeles Dodger pitcher Sandy Koufax. When Gordon reveals the coily method of the Joker’s prison break, Robin’s reply is, “Holy jack-in-the-box!” Upon Batman expressing concern that the Comedians Hall of Fame is a distraction, Robin cries, “Holy red herring!” His response to Batman realizing that the Joker was inside the museum all along is “Holy stuffing!” and “Holy ravioli!” is his not-at-all-offensive response to the realization that the Joker’s going to hit the production of Pagliacci. When he sees Batman wrapped in colored paper, he cries “Holy serpentine!” as he helps the Caped Crusader extricate himself. He dismissively says, “Holy grammar” at Joker’s “he who laughs last…” clue, but is much more enthusiastic in his “Holy safari!” upon realizing that Laughwell’s collection is the Joker’s next target. When Batman throws what he thinks is his smoke bomb, but turns out to be Joker’s, he cries, “Holy 4th of July!” He laments, “Holy headlines” when seeing that they’re portrayed as “page-one dumbbells” in the newspaper.\n\nGotham City’s finest. It never occurs to Gordon or O’Hara that the Joker might hit the Comedians Hall of Fame exhibit, even though there was a newspaper article that specifically mentioned that the Joker would not be one of the inductees into that hall. When Batman mentions it, they’re in awe of his genius.\n\nLater, Gordon and O’Hara are depressed and stymied by Batman’s absence, unsure what they can possibly do without him. This so traumatizes them that O’Hara hands over a piece of evidence in an act of vandalism against police HQ to a civilian.\n\nNo sex, please, we’re superheroes. At the museum, there’s a gaggle of young women who squee over Robin, but neither hero pays them any mind. At the end, Queenie tries to charm her way out of arrest, to no avail.\n\nSpecial Guest Villain. The trifecta of male villains is completed in this third set of episodes with Cesar Romero as the Joker. Romero famously refused to shave his mustache for the role, so they just covered the ‘stache with the harlequin makeup that is the character’s hallmark. (It’s actually way more noticeable on 21st century hi-def televisions than it was on the old analog TVs of the day, though I do recall noticing it occasionally when I was a kid.)\n\nNa-na na-na na-na na-na na. “Holy headlines! We look like page one dumbbells!”\n\n“Too true, Robin. The responsibility of the press is to report the truth despite what it might do to our image. Our main concern is to a frightened public whom we seem to be failing.”\n\n“Gosh, you’re right—I can’t help thinking of only myself, I’m sorry.”\n\nRobin bitching about the headlines, Batman pointing out that he’s being a doofus, and Robin admitting to being one.\n\nTrivial matters: This episode was discussed on The Batcave Podcast episode 3 by host John S. Drew with special guest chum, Billy Flynn of Geek Radio Daily.\n\nThe story was partly based on the 1952 comic book story “The Joker’s Utility Belt” by David Reed, Dick Sprang, & Charles Paris, one of the three stories in Batman #73. Also, Joker breaking into TV broadcasts is similar to what he did in his very first appearance in Batman #1, breaking into radio broadcasts. The character would be seen to do it again in the comics, as well as in the movies (both the 1989 Batman and 2008’s The Dark Knight) and the 1990s animated series.\n\nWriter Robert Dozier is the son of show developer William Dozier. This is the only story he wrote for his Dad’s show. He would go on to co-create the short-lived $weepstake$ in 1979.\n\nThe Joker’s game show What’s My Crime? is a riff on the long-running What’s My Line? (in its sixteenth year when this episode aired). Cesar Romero appeared on the show twice.\n\nThe cliffhanger voiceover for the first time has William Dozier saying the words, “Same bat-time, same bat-channel,” though the caption still reads “Same time, same channel,” as with the previous two cliffhangers.\n\nQueenie is based on one of Joker’s henchwomen from the comics, who discovered Batman’s true identity, but died before she could reveal it.\n\nIn The Dark Knight, the Joker, played by Heath Ledger, wore an opera mask very similar to the one from this story that the Joker wore while playing Pagliacci.\n\nWhile Crichton doesn’t appear, we do see more of his prison reform attempts, as seen in “Fine Feathered Finks”/ “The Penguin’s a Jinx.”\n\nPow! Biff! Zowie! “Come, my puckish partners in plunder!” If you want to start an argument among geeks—well, it’s not that hard, really, but one way to get one going is ask who the best Joker is. There are those who will swear by Jack Nicholson in the 1989 film, others extoll the virtues of Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight (he won an Oscar and everything!), and plenty of wonderful voice actors have done him in animated productions, from Larry Storch in the 1970s to Larry Weinrib in the 1980s to Mark Hamill in the 1990s to Kevin Michael Richardson in the 2000s. (Jared Leto will no doubt further complicate the argument in next year’s Suicide Squad.) For my money, with all respect to Ledger (and none to Nicholson, who was dreadful in the role; he was way more effective as Jack Napier than he was as the Joker, which is getting it entirely backwards), the best ever remains Hamill, as no one—live action or voice—has come close to his perfect rendering of the Clown Prince of Crime in the Batman, Superman, and Justice League animated series that ran from 1992-2003.\n\nBut it would be wrong to underestimate Cesar Romero. It’s easy to dismiss him when compared to the much darker psychotic lunacy of Hamill, Nicholson, and Ledger, but he brings a manic wonderfulness to the role. Unlike Frank Gorshin’s acrobatic craziness, which was leavened by calm moments, Romero’s Joker is entirely vocal—but incredibly effectively so. Like Gorshin, he has a distinctive laugh, and he’s written as a fan of alliteration, plus he doesn’t have the calm moments Gorshin uses. Indeed, the closest Romero comes to calm is when he’s being dismissive (usually toward his henchmen and moll when they’re being dumb), instead giving a steady barrage of gleefully manic craziness.\n\nThe story itself is fun in that it shows the Dynamic Duo dealing with failure and the consequences of it. Robin in particular is hurt by all the negative press; Batman seems unaffected.\n\nIn fact, Adam West’s usual calm in the face of craziness backfires a bit here in one aspect. The newscaster mentions his eight-year-old son, who included Batman as part of his before-bed prayers, and Robin mentions the boy several times in the episode. Meant to tug at the heartstrings, those mentions would be much more effective if West showed some—any—reaction to it. Honestly, he manages more reaction to the awful piano playing at the top of “The Joker is Wild” than he does to disappointing an eight-year-old.\n\nBat-rating: 7\n\nKeith R.A.

His getaway vehicle is an ice-cream truck. A cop pursues him on a motorcycle, but Mr. Freeze ices the road behind him, and the cop washes out. After expositioning to the audience about Mr. Freeze—that he can only exist in temperatures of 50 degrees below zero (or colder)—Gordon and O’Hara go to the Bat-phone.\n\nBruce and Dick are having lunch with three players for the local baseball team, the Gotham City Eagles, including their star pitcher, Paul Diamante. They beg off dessert, claiming a double date, and head to police HQ. Batman feels a certain amount of guilt—in their last tussle, Batman accidentally spilled one of Mr. Freeze’s instant-freeze experiments onto the man himself, forcing him to live in a suit that keeps his body at 50 below. That is an expensive proposition, so they can expect a crime wave. The Dynamic Duo head back to the Batcave to consult the anti-crime computer.\n\nMr. Freeze has a hideout in the mountains, where he’s able to keep the interior at the temperatures he needs to survive—but can also make parts of the room 76 degrees, which is handy for his henchmen.\n\nBatman tests his anti-freezing pill, but it’s not enough to keep him from freezing to death in Mr. Freeze’s native temperature. At best, it allows him to tolerate zero degrees, which still gives Mr. Freeze a 50-degree advantage.\n\nFive fake Batmen and five fake Mr. Freezes have been hired to appear in public to confuse the police and Batman himself. O’Hara is dumbfounded by patrol reports that have Batman sighted all over town at the same time. Gordon calls Batman to let him know, and they map out the appearances, realizing that all the Batmen are converging on the diamond exchange.\n\nSure enough, Mr. Freeze is robbing the diamond exchange, including the Star of Kashmir, the most valuable diamond in the world—or, rather, the second, as the manager Mr. Perkins informs him.\n\nA guard sets off the alarm, prompting Mr. Freeze to freeze him solid. Then the five fake Batmen, as well as the five fake Mr. Freezes, all enter, to the confusion of the customers. The real Batman arrives with Robin, and fisticuffs ensue. Mr. Freeze is the only who doesn’t participate in the fight, as he’s too busy icing the floor. Robin almost biffs the real Batman by mistake at one point. In the confusion, Mr. Freeze escapes with his henchmen, taking time to ice the Batmobile’s turbines before getting away.\n\nBatman and Robin look up in the sky, and it’s not a bird, but it is a plane, which is skywriting: “STRIKE ONE FOR BATMAN.”\n\nThe anti-crime computer informs them that Mr. Freeze is likely to strike a jewelry shop next. He stole the Star of Kashmir, and left a fortune in loose diamonds on the floor of the exchange. He’s obviously after particularly valuable pieces. The computer gives several likely targets, but they hit on Ghiaclio Circolo (which Robin, who’s studying Italian, translates as “the Ice Circle”) as the most likely, as it’s the most valuable in the world. It’s owned by Princess Sandra of Molino, who’s flying into Gotham for a charity baseball game.\n\nPrincess Sandra—who was born Sandra Carolson of Brooklyn—is in the royal suite at the Gotham City Hotel, wearing the Ghiaclio Circolo around her neck. Mr. Freeze enters her room inside a crate labelled as meat that must be kept frozen. One of her staff sounds the alarm, but Mr. Freeze freezes him—and when he falls down, he shatters (off camera), causing another staffer to faint.\n\nMr. Freeze takes the diamond from around the princess’s neck, just as Batman and Robin arrive. The scuffle is brief—Mr. Freeze tries to get away by setting the drapes alight, but they catch up to him and he’s forced to freeze them on the street, just as a plane skywrites strike two. He’d been hoping to toy with them more, but that’s the way the ice cube crumbles.\n\nLuckily, Gotham City Hospital has a Mark 7 Super Hypertherm Deicifier, into which the Dynamic Duo are placed and saved.\n\nPrincess Sandra is throwing out the first ball in the charity game, which is between the Eagles and the Windy City Wildcats. She does so from Bruce Wayne’s private box, and then the ballgame starts. But Paul Diamante isn’t pitching, to everyone’s surprise. Just as that announcement is made, a plane skywrites, “THREE STRIKES, YOU’RE OUT, BATMAN.”\n\nSaying he has to go to a board meeting, Bruce leaves the box. Even though he’s not on the board, Dick follows. They arrive at police HQ in costume to find that Diamante was kidnapped by Mr. Freeze—Diamante means “diamond,” and he pitches on a baseball diamond, thus keeping the theme going. Mr. Freeze calls the commissioner with his demands: he’ll give Diamante back in exchange for Batman. Batman, of course, agrees, as Diamante is the idol of millions of young boys who will grow up to be men, and he can’t let their idol die. (We’ll just dance past the implication that (a) girls don’t like baseball and (b) Batman has a different standard for famous people, as it sounds like that if he was Paul Diamante the bricklayer instead of Paul Diamante the famous pitcher, Batman would let him rot.)\n\nRobin, though, surreptitiously placed a tracker on Batman, which he explains to a surprised Alfred, who just brought him a strawberry sundae. (Extra energy wouldn’t hurt.) Batman’s in the middle of nowhere, where he meets a helicopter. Mr. Freeze’s thugs deposit a dazed Diamante on a park bench and club Batman on the head. Robin follows along, making sure Diamante’s okay, but not bothering to untie him (really?).\n\nBatman wakes up in Mr. Freeze’s lair, a section that’s 76 degrees. Mr. Freeze has the utility belt in the cold half of the room—yet he doesn’t bother to unmask him. Twice Batman tries to attack Mr. Freeze on the cold side of the room and fails. Mr. Freeze leads him to the dining room, where Robin has been captured.\n\nMr. Freeze provides them with a last meal: roast beef, spinach, and baked Alaska (Batman turns down a cold sherry). Batman tries to appeal to him to give up so he can get the medical help he needs, but Mr. Freeze wants revenge for what Batman did to him. They once again try to attack, but the cold is too much for them.\n\nFinally, Mr. Freeze narrows the warm field so only one person can fit. Batman lets Robin stay in, and Batman then dives in and punches Mr. Freeze in the nose. Turns out he was wearing thermal underwear that kept him warm, and was faking up until now. What he gained from faking all this time is unclear.\n\nHe gives Robin the controller, and Robin makes the whole room 76 degrees. But after Mr. Freeze suffers a bit in normal temperatures, he makes a small area at 50 below for him.\n\nThen the thugs show up, and fisticuffs ensue, with the Dynamic Duo victorious.\n\nThe next day, Diamante has a photo op with Gordon and Princess Sandra. Bruce and Dick, meanwhile, are deeply disappointed that Aunt Harriet had the cook make baked Alaska for dessert…\n\nFetch the Bat-shark-repellant! For the first time we get the “Atomic batteries to power, turbines to speed,” “Get ready to move out” sequence with Batman and Robin as they start up the Batmobile. Batman tries to survive in the portable freeze chamber. The anti-crime computer has an interdigital Batsorter—which, apparently, interdigitally sorts bats?\n\nBest of all, they mark the appearances of the fake Batmen on the giant lighted lucite map of Gotham City, which is handily labelled, “GIANT LIGHTED LUCITE MAP OF GOTHAM CITY.” One assumes there’s also the tiny lighted lucite map of Gotham City, the giant dark lucite map of Gotham City, the giant lighted marble map of Gotham City, and, of course, the giant lighted lucite map of Metropolis.\n\nHoly #@!%$, Batman! When realizing that Mr. Freeze will need to bankroll his chilly lifestyle, Robin declares, “Holy iceberg!” Alfred’s serving of iced tea after Batman tested the portable freeze chamber leads to Robin declaring, “Holy blizzard!” As they mark the appearances of the fake Batmen on the giant lighted lucite map of Gotham City, Robin mutters, “Holy schizophrenia.” Upon realizing the Batmobile’s turbines are frozen, he declares, “Holy iceballs!” Alfred’s interrupting Robin’s preparation to go after Batman is met with an on-the-nose, “Holy interruptions!” and he declares “Holy Sherlock Holmes” when explaining to Alfred why he put a tracker on the Caped Crusader.\n\nBreaking the pattern, he, for reasons passing understanding, says, “Leaping lumbago!” when they realize the fake Batmen are targeting the diamond exchange.\n\nGotham City’s finest. Gordon says to O’Hara that those elected to protect the city must follow the due process of the law—which means that either the commissioner, the chief of police, or both is an elected post. The notion that a plurality of citizens in Gotham might have actually voted for one of these two for their job is a scary-ass proposition…\n\nRobin calls the GCPD on his way to the mountain, but O’Hara and his people don’t make it to the mountain hideout until after the fight is over because they took a wrong turn on Route 49. I hate when that happens.\n\nNo sex, please, we’re superheroes. Gordon at one point refers to Batman and Robin as two fine specimens of manhood. Wah-hey! Princess Sandra and Bruce Wayne apparently have some kind of past, though only Sandra makes mention of it.\n\nSpecial Guest Villain. George Sanders makes his only appearance as Mr. Freeze. This is the first villain specifically created for the show (though he was based on the comics villain Mr. Zero, who first appeared in Batman #121 in 1959) and the first to inspire the comics, as Mr. Zero was changed to Mr. Freeze to match the TV villain in Detective Comics #373 in 1968. Mr. Freeze will return twice in season 2, played by Otto Preminger in “Green Ice” / “Deep Freeze” and by Eli Wallach in “Ice Spy” / “The Duo Defy.” He’s one of only two villains to be played by three different actors on the show, the other being Catwoman (Julie Newmar, Lee Meriwether, and Eartha Kitt).\n\nNa-na na-na na-na na-na na.\n\n“Nothing. Not one single mark—er, I mean, red cent. No money! None!”\n\nMr. Freeze’s answer to the question of how much money he wants for Diamante’s release.\n\nTrivial matters: This episode was discussed on The Batcave Podcast episode 4 by host John S. Drew with special guest chum, Andrew Leyland of the Hey, Kids, Comics! podcast.\n\nTeri Garr makes a cameo at the top of “Instant Freeze” as one of the victims of Mr. Freeze’s skating rink meltdown, one of her first TV appearances.\n\nOther guests in this episode include Shelby Grant, who would appear in Our Man Flint the same year, as the princess, longtime character actor Robert Hogan as Diamante, and Dan Terranova doing a hilarious parody of Ben Casey as the doctor who saves Batman and Robin.\n\nWhen talking with Diamante, Dick compares him to Sandy Koufax, the Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher. This is the second reference to Koufax made by the character, having cried, “Holy Koufax!” in “The Joker is Wild.”\n\nWe’re back to “same time, same channel” without the Bat-prefix at the end of “Instant Freeze.”\n\nPow! Biff! Zowie! “Have you ordered the airplane to go zoom-zoom-zoom?” This is a particularly enjoyable couple of episodes. One of the refreshing things about watching the show right now is that it started in medias res. These are not Batman’s first encounters with the villains in question, and in the case of Mr. Freeze we have the added bonus of a particular animus he has for Batman.\n\nAnd it’s justified, too. Everyone else insists it was an accident and Batman isn’t responsible, but Batman himself evinces at least a little guilt at what happened: because of Batman, Dr. Schimmel, a.k.a. Mr. Freeze, can only survive in sub-Arctic temperatures. It’s a horrible thing to have to deal with.\n\nIt gives Mr. Freeze’s plots to ensnare Batman significantly more bite, because he’s not in it to challenge Batman or to play games with him; he has a very genuine desire for revenge. Some of that bite is lost by George Sanders playing the bad guy with a comedy German accent, but he’s having so much fun in the role, it’s hard to complain about that overmuch.\n\nOf course, you have to wonder why Dr. Schimmel didn’t just put his device that can freeze parts of rooms and not freeze other parts on the market. He’d make a mint in selling to meat storage units alone!\n\nThe episode would get a higher rating but for the climax. It makes no sense, none, that Batman was faking it for all that time and then suddenly decided to reveal himself at the end. He could have taken Mr. Freeze down the minute he woke up in the room—what did he gain by pretending to be frozen in the room? Even Batman’s most ridiculous feats have some basis in reality, however miniscule, and however warped this particular reality is, but this has absolutely no sense to it whatsoever.\n\nIn addition, why go to the trouble of establishing that Princess Sandra is actually from Brooklyn if you don’t do anything with it? And why did Mr. Freeze melt an ice rink, anyhow? What was the point? How’d he get the planes to skywrite so fast? And finally, why is the second episode called “Rats Like Cheese”? There are no rats and no cheese in the episode. It’s like it was the placeholder rhyme title and they never replaced it…\n\nBat-rating: 6\n\nKeith R.A. DeCandido is always talking about the weather but never does anything about it.\n\n“Zelda the Great” / “A Death Worse than Fate”\n\nWritten by Lorenzo Semple Jr.\n\nDirected by Norman Foster\n\nSeason 1, Episodes 9 & 10\n\nProduction code 8705\n\nOriginal air dates: February 9 & 10, 1966\n\nThe Bat-signal: The First National Bank is robbed by someone wearing a bulletproof vest that’s so strong it doesn’t even make an impact on the wearer when the guard tries to shoot the thief. This is an annual occurrence: every April Fool’s Day, an unknown bandit steals exactly $100,000 from somewhere in Gotham. After two years of this, the cops throw up their hands and call Batman.\n\nBruce, Dick, and Alfred are on the roof of Wayne Manor, peering through a telescope, so they don’t hear the Batphone. Luckily, this is the one and only time Gordon decides to try both the phone and the Bat-signal, and so the Dynamic Duo head off. (Oddly, they go in the back way, rather than pull up to GCPD HQ’s front door.)\n\nThey retrieved the bullet that ricocheted off the bulletproof vest, but the lab report turned up negative. Batman, Robin, Gordon, and O’Hara ponder the motives of a thief who only steals a hundred grand every April. O’Hara suggests that they’re stealing to pay their taxes, but Batman rejects the notion that a tax-paying citizen would resort to crime. O’Hara hangs his head in shame at that utterly ridiculous notion.\n\nSince they don’t have a lead, Batman suggests they make a lead. (That’s not unethical at all!) He plants a story in the Gotham City Times that the money stolen was counterfeit.\n\nBatman’s equipment finds multiple fibers on the bullet that somehow were completely missed by the GCPD lab. (Budget cuts?) It includes thirteen layers of multicolored silk, and also ambergris, which is used in perfume. They deduce that it must be a woman committing the robberies—and it’s not Catwoman, as she’s still in jail.\n\nWe cut to the Gnome Book Store, which is a front for Eivol Ekdol, an inventor. He is joined by Zelda the Great, the magician who moonlights as the April Fool’s thief in order to pay Ekdol for the equipment she uses in her act. Ekdol is livid at the newspaper report of the counterfeit money, especially since he has a fantastic escape act for her—the “Doom Trap.” He won’t tell her how she can escape from it until he gets paid. Since Batman and the police will be watching every bank in Gotham like hawks, Ekdol suggests she steal the Star of Samarkand, which will be on display.\n\nBatman and Robin head to the shop where the Star is being displayed, replacing it with a fake that has a homing device inside. Batman, Robin, and a couple of undercover cops will be nearby, as is the Batmobile. But Zelda sees through the ruse, and sets a trap of her own, luring Aunt Harriet out of Wayne Manor with a story of Dick being hit with a baseball. Then, disguised as an elderly widow, she enters the jewelers, sprays purple gas from her cane, and when the smoke clears, she’s changed back into her trademark orange outfit and the emerald is gone.\n\nThe Dynamic Duo leap into action, but the image of Zelda is an illusion created by mirrors, and they find the fake Star ditched outside. Gordon then calls with the news that the aunt of Bruce Wayne’s ward has been kidnapped, with a ransom demand for $100,000—but nobody can find Wayne! (Big shock…)\n\nAunt Harriet is being held over a fire by Zelda, who calmly sits nearby knitting. Batman goes off to “find” Bruce Wayne, leaving Robin behind with Gordon and O’Hara—the latter having called every club a millionaire might be at. But then Bruce shows up, and Gordon brings him to a TV station, where they provide a phone number for the kidnapper to call. Zelda calls the number and is going to give ransom instructions, but first they inform her that the money she stole is actually quite real. She doesn’t need the $100,000 ransom because she actually has that amount already. (Outrage is also expressed that a woman would stoop to such trickery. Bruce, Robin, and Gordon are evasive on the relative morality of their own trickery, both with the fake Star and the fake story about the not-really-fake money.)\n\nZelda agrees to free Aunt Harriet, which she does so by leaving her blindfolded on a street corner. They get her home, and a doctor gives her a clean bill of health. Alfred feels guilty, as he was down in the Batcave when the fateful phone call arrived, although he makes up for it by producing a matchbook from the Gnome Book Store that fell out of Aunt Harriet’s pocket when they brought her home.\n\nBruce, however, does his butler one better—he knows that Zelda is the perpetrator. Batman and Robin zip down to the Batcave and hop into the Batmobile, where Batman explains how he figured out who it is. They already knew it was a female magician, but there are more than two dozen female magicians licensed to perform in Gotham. But the kidnapper’s description of Aunt Harriet’s peril perfectly matches that of the closing act Zelda the Great performed on Dick’s birthday the previous year.\n\nAt the Gnome Book Store, Ekdol admits that he has no idea how to escape from the Doom Trap. Ekdol’s plan is to put Batman in the trap; once the Caped Crusader figures out how to escape, they’ll know how to do it. And then they’ll kill him. Or, rather, the two hoods who have paid Ekdol for the privilege of killing Batman will kill him.\n\nZelda’s iffy on the killing part—the kidnapping and robbery was bad enough—but she also anticipated Ekdol’s (stupid) plan and planted the matchbook on Aunt Harriet. She expects Batman will be by any second.\n\nThe hoods hide in two sarcophagi with peepholes for their machine guns, while Ekdol and Zelda hide in the former’s control room. When the Dynamic Duo shows up, they are lured by a note to the back room, where they’ve left a fake bat in the Doom Trap. Batman and Robin walk right into the trap and Ekdol closes it and locks it with the hilariously large magnetic padlock.\n\nEkdol releases the gas, and they keep their heads down, as the gas is lighter than air, which means it must have hydrogen in it. So they can use their utility belts as a conductor for the electricity in the grille to cause the gas to explode, breaking them out.\n\nImpressed by their bravery, Zelda warns them about their impending doom, and so they duck. The hoods wind up shooting each other dead, as the sarcophagi were facing each other. Oops.\n\nThey capture Ekdol, but Zelda surrenders on her own.\n\nSome time later, Bruce visits Zelda at Gotham State Penitentiary. (Her prison outfit includes a pillbox hat in black-and-white stripes.) He’s impressed with Zelda’s saving Batman and Robin’s lives, and so he offers her a job doing magic at a children’s hospital after she serves her time.\n\nFetch the Bat-shark-repellant! We never do find out what exact tools Batman and Robin use to try to get out of the Doom Trap, but whatever it is (sounds like a bat-drill?) can’t get through the “jet-age plastic.” And he does use a bat-a-rang to klunk Ekdol on the head and takes Zelda away in bat-cuffs.\n\nHoly #@!%$, Batman! When Bruce uses a lecture on Latin American Studies as a cover to abandon Aunt Harriet, Dick says, “Holy Venezuela!” Upon discovering the multiple layers of multicolored silk worn by the thief, Robin cries, “Holy rainbow!” Robin yells out a particularly enthusiastic “Holy Hallelujiah” after they come to terms with Zelda for Aunt Harriet’s release. Upon realizing that the bad guy is the same woman whom Dick saw perform on his birthday, he exclaims, “Holy birthday cake!” When they’re trapped in the Doom Trap, Robin cries, “Holy phone booth!” and when the gas is released, he laments, “Holy graveyard,” thinking this might be it. After the hoods shoot each other, he says, “Holy crossfire” (to which Batman responds, “Hoist on their own murderous petards”).\n\nGotham City’s finest. The cops have failed for two years to nail the April Fool’s thief. Also when Batman informs Gordon that the thief is a woman, the commissioner is shocked at the very notion of a female criminal, even though Robin just mentioned Catwoman a few minutes earlier.\n\nMost embarrassing, though, is the crime lab. They find no traces of anything on the bullet, yet Batman’s able to find more than a dozen different fibers on it. You have to wonder if Bruce Wayne might have done more good for the war on crime if he donated some of his fancy-shmancy equipment to the cops, who are obviously woefully underequipped…\n\nNo sex, please, we’re superheroes. The woman who runs Stonewin Jewelers is dewey-eyed and captivated by the very presence of Batman and Robin. Later, so is Zelda, to the point where she gives Bruce Wayne a flower that she wishes him to give to Batman.\n\nSpecial Guest Villainess. Academy Award-winning actor Anne Baxter plays Zelda. Baxter will return as Olga, Queen of the Cossacks in several season 3 episodes. Both Zsa Zsa Gabor and Bette Davis were considered for the role of Zelda; Gabor would eventually turn up as Minerva in the series finale, “Minerva, Mayhem, and Millionaires.”\n\nNa-na na-na na-na na-na na. “Hello, criminals, wherever you are out there. Do you hear me, criminals?”\n\nGordon’s hilarious opening to his TV broadcast to Aunt Harriet’s unknown kidnapper.\n\nTrivial matters: This episode was discussed on The Batcave Podcast episode 5 by host John S. Drew with special guest chum, Dan Persons of Cinefantastique Online, Mighty Movie Podcast, The Chronic Rift, and Hour of the Wolf.\n\nThis episode was adapted from “Batman’s Inescapable Doom-Trap” by John Broome, Sheldon Moldoff, and Joe Giella, in Detective Comics #346. In the original story the magician was a man named Carnado the Great.\n\nOriginally, this two-parter was to be called “The Inescapable Doom-Trap”/”Zelda Takes the Rap,” using the original comics story as the inspiration for Part 1’s title.\n\nCatwoman is referenced, even though she won’t appear until later in the season.\n\nThis is a rare occasion when the cliffhanger doesn’t involve either of the Dynamic Duo being in danger, and an equally rare occasion when sound-effects-laden fisticuffs do not ensue.\n\nOne of the hoods is played by Victor French, who would later make a career out of standing next to Michael Landon on Little House on the Prairie and Highway to Heaven.\n\nAlfred’s guilt over Aunt Harriet’s kidnapping is at least in part due to his changing his usual day to dust the Batcave from Wednesday, as there’s a TV show on Wednesday nights that he has become addicted to. Ahem.\n\nPow! Biff! Zowie! “Aw, c’mon, you crook, you can’t be all bad.” This story has a most interesting example of the hypocrisy of Batman.\n\nI hear the shock from my noble readers even as I type this. There are incarnations of Batman that could be accused of such, but surely not the Adam West version! He is a paragon of virtue! He wouldn’t even park in a no-parking zone until a cop moved the sign away! He wouldn’t throw a bomb in a particular direction because he might hurt some ducks! He regularly lectures Robin on all sorts of nonsense!\n\nAnd all that’s true. In fact, just a little while ago, in “The Joker is Wild”/”Batman is Riled,” one of those lectures was about the press, and how their job is to report the facts, not serve as the Dynamic Duo’s publicity agents. The point was that the press is where you get facts, not spin.\n\nYet here we are with Batman—having said that he’ll “make a lead,” which sounds pretty dodgy just on the face of it—asking the Gotham City Times to commit fraud. He asks them to print a lie in a major American newspaper and pass it off as truth. The very notion of a free press is compromised by Batman’s actions.\n\nThen insult is added to the injury by putting a fake emerald out and telling Stonewin Jewelers to pass it off as the Star of Samarkand, thus lying to all the customers who came to look at this one-day-only display.\n\nNow in most Batman stories in which the Caped Crusader employed such a tactic, I wouldn’t say a word. But this particular iteration of Batman is so self-righteous on the subject of what is right and what is wrong, what is proper and what isn’t. In this very two-parter, he expresses amazement at the very notion of a tax-paying citizen also being a criminal. Yet here’s Batman perpetuating a fraud. Shame, Caped Crusader, shame shame shame!\n\nIn any case, despite the title character’s horrid behavior, this is a fun story, partly because of the novelty of a female villain. Of particular note is that this is an early case of genderbending, as the magician in the original comics story was a man. Better still, Zelda is more than a match for Batman, since she proves herself an excellent schemer. She sees through the ruse with the Star of Samarkand, and still manages to steal the piece and kidnap Aunt Harriet. Later, she anticipates Ekdol’s (stupid) plan, and lured Batman to the bookstore before Ekdol even explained why he wanted Batman lured there.\n\nI must admit to eliciting great glee from Ekdol’s hilarious plan: building a trap so amazing that the guy who built it can’t get out of it. But Batman’s so awesome that he can do it for him! It almost makes up for how awful Jack Kruschen is in the role with his not-very-Albanian Albanian accent…\n\nBest of all, though, is that the story doesn’t rely on a lot of the show’s worst crutches: very few bat-devices, no leaps to unconvincing conclusions, and they escape from the Doom Trap by using their brains, not an oh-so-convenient device in the utility belt.\n\nBat-rating: 8\n\nKeith R.A. DeCandido is at 2050 Events this weekend in Daytona Beach, Florida. He will have a table where he’ll be selling and signing books, and also be doing some programming, including a Farscape panel with Gigi “Chiana” Edgley.

A woman doing Madeline cosplay approaches him and hands him a set of roses, proving that whatever country he’s the king of, they have crappy security for their heads of state. The flowers explode in a barrage of fireworks, a recording of the Riddler’s giggle, and a sign that reads, “When is a person like a piece of wood?” (Wah-hey!) The GCPD is, of course, helpless before this baffling riddle, so they call Batman.\n\nAlfred interrupts his polishing of the bat-pole (wah-HEY!) to answer and summon Bruce and Dick, the former having just beaten the latter at chess. They slide down the newly polished bat-poles and head to police HQ. Robin solves the riddle: that a person is like a piece of wood when he’s a ruler, showing that a) he doesn’t have a dirty mind and b) plastic rulers weren’t very common in 1966. Gordon figures it has something to do with King Boris, and Robin makes the leap in logic that it has to do with the chess competition with a $25,000 reward, but Batman thinks that’s too small potatoes. The king’s itinerary includes the Miss Galaxy competition and an appearance at the Queen of Freedom monument. Both involve queens, who are also rulers—the Miss Galaxy winner gets a tiara made of diamonds and emeralds.\n\nCut to the lowest-budget beauty pageant in the history of the world—seriously, I’ve seen high school auditoriums more sophisticated than where they hold this pageant—and Batman and Robin are backstage observing the pageant, waiting for the Riddler to strike and checking out the ass on the contestant at stage right. The winner, a busty blonde with an aggressively worked-on tan, is crowned, and then the Riddler pops up from a trapdoor in the stage and steals her tiara. Batman and Robin stand with their thumbs in their ears, but it turns out it was for a reason: they replaced the tiara with a fake, that also has a homing transmitter.\n\nThey race to the Batmobile, but then the Riddler pops out of the sewers to say he knew it was a fake all along, and gives him a new riddle: What room can no one enter? Then he tosses them the fake tiara, which has another riddle attached to it. Riddler gets away—easy to do when Batman and Robin again sit with their thumbs in their ears, not moving until after he escapes into the sewer. They open the second riddle: What is the beginning of eternity, the end of time and space, the beginning of every end, and the end of every race? (Except the piece of paper has bad punctuation—missing a comma and no question mark at the end. Shame on you, Riddler!)\n\nThey go to the Batcave. The first riddle’s answer is a mushroom (okay, sure), and so Robin looks up the Royal Mushroom Club. (Seriously?) Robin’s about to look it up on the bat-computer, but then Batman chastises him by channeling cranky old people in the 1990s by saying that he should just use the phone book instead of the computer, and Robin apologizes for being so lazy. At no point do they ever actually solve the riddle that was in the tiara, the answer to which is the letter E.\n\nThe Riddler’s current henchmen are the River Rat Gang (including Mousey, the woman who gave Boris the flowers), who are slicing cheese with the world’s most ungainly cheese slicer, when the Riddler gloats that Plan 13Z will be a great crime.\n\nKing Boris is hosting a reception at the Royal Mushroom Club. He is offered a tour of the wine cellar, which he is very excited about—he analogizes it to a little boy being shown expensive bicycles. Okay, then. But the steward who invites him to the wine cellar is one of the River Rat Gang. Batman and Robin show up and warn King Boris that he’s in great danger. The king poo-poohs the notion two seconds before he’d kidnapped through another trapdoor. (This city is chock full of them…) The Riddler has left two more riddles: How much dirt is in a hole three acres square and two hundred feet deep? (None—it’s a hole.) What won’t run long without winding? (A river.)\n\nThey go to the Batcave, where Batman has elaborate drawings of sections of Gotham City scanned into the Bat-computer. At one of the bends in the river is the now-closed Gotham Water and Power Plant, which is three acres square and two hundred feet deep. At the plant, where the king is all tied up, the Riddler assures Boris that he will return him unharmed to Gotham once he’s lured Batman and Robin to their doom. (One of the River Rat Gang offers Boris some cheese, but he refuses on account of there’s no port.)\n\nBatman and Robin arrive and, naturally, climb the wall of the power plant. Batman reminds Robin that the most important thing is to reassure the world that anyone may visit the United States and be safe: it’s the essence of our democracy, which is news to me, as I always thought one-person-one-vote was the essence of democracy, but never mind. They break in on the Riddler, but the criminal was ready for them, dropping a sticky net right on them. They’re then tied to two drive shafts that will spin fast enough to tear Batman and Robin to pieces. He leaves them with a final riddle: When is a woman in love like a welder?\n\nRiddler then leaves them to spin wildly (or rather for their spectacularly unconvincing stunt dummies to spin wildly), and then the mechanism shorts out. (Batman somehow managed to free his hand from the net and use a torch to damage the mechanism.) Batman very dizzily frees himself and then unties Robin. The unsteady heroes head out.\n\nBack at his hideout, the Riddler gloats over his triumph over Batman and Robin. He asks the River Rat Gang what is it that is always coming but never arrives? The answer is “tomorrow.”\n\nKing Boris reports what happened to Gordon, and then Batman calls Gordon and tells him to keep it quiet that the two of them are still alive. The presentation of the miniature replica of the Queen of Freedom by King Boris is being broadcast on live television. The king presents the replica, which is placed in the Museum of Fame, located in the Queen of Freedom’s torch. The TV host then shows off some other items in the museum, including a model of the old commodities building, a bust of Gotham’s first mayor, and a really terrible painting of Batman and Robin.\n\nMousey—now back in the Madeline outfit—places a small explosive in a police callbox, which draws attention to the note she’s also left: a ransom demand for a million dollars, or the Riddler will blow up the Queen of Freedom. Batman suggests they give in to the ransom demand, but the City Council won’t meet until the next day, after the Riddler’s deadline, so there’s no way to get that kind of cash. Batman suggests a private source, and it’s Gordon who actually suggests Bruce Wayne.\n\nBruce, claiming ignorance of what it’s about, gladly hands over the money, showing uncharacteristic behavior for a millionaire. And while he meets with Gordon, “Batman” climbs in the window—one of the River Rat Gang wears a Batsuit—and tells Gordon to let Batman and Robin handle the money delivery, with no cops around. Bruce, knowing it’s a fake, tells Gordon that it’s a good idea. Luckily, Gordon’s not quite as stupid as he seems. He saw through the disguise, but said nothing because he wanted to keep Bruce safe from danger.\n\nIn the Batcave, Batman finds Robin fiddling around with the atomic pile (yeeeeeeeep) because he thought he heard some rumbling and wants to make sure there isn’t anything wrong (YEEEEEEEP!). Batman pulls him off that to help solve the last riddle: a woman in love is like a welder because they both carry a torch. The bomb is in the torch, placed in the replica when King Boris was Riddler’s prisoner. (They show a rather appalling lack of concern for the possibility of their friggin atomic pile malfunctioning, but whatever…)\n\nRiddler and the River Rat Gang wait in the torch room while the cops leave Bruce’s bag of filthy lucre, and then depart, enabling Riddler to enact Plan 136AAA. He picks up the money, and then goes to deactivate the bomb—but the replica is gone! In its place is a note, in which Batman totally trolls Riddler by leaving him a riddle: what squeals louder than a caught rat? The answer: several caught rats.\n\nThe Dynamic Duo then strike a blow for art lovers everywhere by jumping through the painting, destroying it. Fisticuffs ensue, damaging a considerable amount of artwork in the process, and the bad guys are hauled off to jail.\n\nLater, back at Wayne Manor, Aunt Harriet announces that she’s bringing some out-of-town friends to see the Queen of Freedom monument. She invites Bruce and Dick along, but that’s the last place they want to go.\n\nFetch the Bat-shark-repellant! They use the very conveniently located Homing Receiver Scope on the Batmobile dashboard to try to trace the Riddler. The Batcave also has a computer with a weird ergonomic keyboard that can summon up elaborately drawn images of Gotham City rather than photographs for some reason.\n\nHoly #@!%$, Batman! Not a particularly religious pair of episodes, as we’ve only got two holies: In “A Riddle a Day…,” when the Riddler pops out of a sewer cover, Robin says, “Holy sewer pipe!” Upon realizing the bomb is in the torch of the Queen of Freedom in “When the Rat’s Away…,” he cries, “Holy conflagration!”\n\nGotham City’s finest. While the GCPD is initially stumped for hours by a riddle that a teenager who avoids his algebra homework solves in half a second, they generally perform better than usual this week. In particular I’m grateful that Gordon saw through the fake Batman.\n\nNo sex, please, we’re superheroes. Mousey says that Batman and Robin are kinda cute, even though they’re on the other side of the fence.\n\nAlso, I never noticed this until Alfred was polishing them, but Bruce’s bat-pole is much thicker than Dick’s. Ahem.\n\nSpecial Guest Villain. Frank Gorshin is the show’s first returning villain, back after having survived the explosion at the end of “Smack in the Middle.” When he thinks he’s killed the Dynamic Duo, he expresses glee at the fact that he did what the Joker, Mr. Freeze, and Penguin couldn’t.\n\nNa-na na-na na-na na-na na. “Gee, I never met royalty before. It’s pretty thrilling.”\n\n“Royalty? You’ve never met royalty? And just whom do you think stands before you, my cherub? I am the prince of puzzlers! The count of conundrums! The king of crime!”\n\nMousey forgetting that she met royalty earlier in the episode when she gave him flowers at the airport, and the Riddler showing his skill with alliteration.\n\nTrivial matters: This episode was discussed on The Batcave Podcast episode 6 by host John S. Drew with special guest chum, your humble rewatcher! Yes, it was me talking with John about this episode on the podcast…\n\nThe cliffhanger this time says that the next episode will be tomorrow, same time (without prefix), but same bat-channel. I had honestly forgotten how long it took them to settle on the iconic “same bat-time, same bat-channel” thing in both voiceover and text.\n\nWhile the show filmed in Los Angeles, and any outdoor shots were done there, they would often use New York City as the background whenever it was blue-screened in or stock footage was employed. Gotham City has traditionally been a stand-in for either New York City or Chicago, and the former seems to be the primary model in the TV series, as the Queen of Freedom, complete with torch, is an obvious stand-in for the Statue of Liberty (though the torch interior of Lady Liberty doesn’t have a museum and is way smaller).\n\nReginald Denny plays King Boris. He’ll return in the Batman movie as Commodore Schmidlapp, which would be his final role before his death in 1967.\n\nMousey is played by Susan Silo, who switched to voice acting in 1974 and never looked back, having worked extensively in voiceover work in the intervening 40 years, most recently as Yin on Legend of Korra and Nettie Pisghetti in Curious George. She was also Jungle Janet on The Tick and Dr. Karbunkle on both iterations of Biker Mice from Mars.\n\nPow! Biff! Zowie! “One bad turn deserves another.” This episode, and The Batcave Podcast, are kinda responsible for this rewatch. See, when my cohort on The Chronic Rift podcast, John S. Drew (also one of my oldest friends) started up TBP, he cast around to the various Rift regulars to serve as second commentor, and I jumped at a Riddler episode because I always loved Frank Gorshin’s giggling bad guy the best. John assigned me to this one.\n\nIt was, honestly, the first time I’d watched the 1966 Batman in a dog’s age. I had long avoided it as a campy relic of my youth, but I found myself falling in love with it all over again. As a child, I just viewed as fun. As a young adult, I dismissed it as absurd. As an older adult, I’ve circled back around to fun again.\n\nAnd this episode is pretty much a quintessential Batman episode. The GCPD are stymied by simple detective work, Batman and Robin make stunning leaps in logic to track down a villain who’s so caught up in his gimmick he sows the seeds of his own defeat. I mean, think about it, if the Riddler just went ahead and committed the crimes, he’d be in much better shape. He could’ve stolen the Miss Galaxy tiara and kidnapped King Boris while Bruce and Dick were still playing chess.\n\nBut ultimately what makes the episode shine is the same thing that makes every Riddler appearance but one shine: Frank Gorshin. He’s just as manic and gleefully insane as he was last time. The screen just lights up when he’s on it. Which is good, as the riddles aren’t as much fun this time, and to make matters worse there’s one that winds up not being solved nor having anything to do with the plot….\n\nAlso, the cliffhanger is spectacularly lame, as it happens entirely off-camera in “A Riddle a Day…” and thus does nothing to make our hero look resourceful, instead making the writer look lazy. It’s the first time we don’t really see how the cliffhanger is resolved, and it just feels horribly anticlimactic. (It doesn’t help that the dummies used for the rotating scenes are incredibly obviously fake.)\n\nBat-rating: 8\n\nKeith R.A. DeCandido has a bunch of things out now or being released very soon: “Back in El Paso My Life Will be Worthless” in The X-Files: Trust No One (now available in trade paperback, eBook, or audio), “Streets of Fire” in V-Wars: Night Terrors (now available in audio, paperback and eBook available for preorder), “Send in the Clones” in The Side of Good/The Side of Evil (paperback and eBook available for preorder), and the Stargate SG-1 novel Kali’s Wrath (on sale soon).\n\n“The Thirteenth Hat” / “Batman Stands Pat”\n\nWritten by Charles Hoffman\n\nDirected by Norman Foster\n\nSeason 1, Episodes 13 and 14\n\nProduction code 8719\n\nOriginal air dates: February 23 and 24, 1966\n\nThe Bat-signal: A chef reports for work in a very low-rent kitchen, when the Mad Hatter and two of his goons burst in on him. He steals the chef’s hat—thanks to the Lenny Henry show Chef! I will always think of a chef’s hat as a “culinary condom“—and then uses the super-instant mesmerizer in his big-ass top hat to render the chef unconscious. He does the same to a man wearing a deerstalker on a street corner, and the manager of a silver shop.\n\nGordon and O’Hara muse on these hat-related crimes, which he really and truly says are happening “right under our noses,” making me wish O’Hara said, “Well, technically, sir, they’re happening over our noses ’cause that’s where you’ll be wearin’ a hat,” but he didn’t, and I was sad. Strangely, Gordon’s main concern seems to be for the hats, even though the Hatter is also kidnapping people…\n\nAnyhow, Jervis Tetch, a.k.a. the Mad Hatter, has been released on parole, and is immediately going after people and their hats. Gordon, of course, calls Batman. This handily gets Bruce and Dick out of the Gotham City Society Tea Tasting, where Aunt Harriet is struggling with whether or not to lead with oolong or pekoe. While Bruce is apparently an expert in Italian marble sculpture, he knows diddly about tea, and gives Harriet no useful advice.\n\nThey bop off to GCPD HQ, where we are told that the Hatter threatened Batman with revenge after the Cowled Crusader (Gordon calls him that instead of “Caped,” as this is a Mad Hatter episode, and therefore his cowl is more important than his cape this time ’round) testified against him in court. How someone who refuses to reveal his real name on the record can possibly testify in a court of law is left as an exercise for the viewer. (Seriously, how does that work? “State your name for the record, please.” “I’m Batman.” “First or last name?”)\n\nGordon gets a call saying that the fire chief, and his shiny red hat, have been taken. Batman and Robin head out, and O’Hara says to clear all exits for the Batmobile. Why this is necessary when the Batmobile is parked on the street is also left as an exercise for the viewer.\n\nThe Hatter has placed hats on dummies that represent the twelve jurors at his trial. He has eleven of them, with two more to go—the twelfth juror, but also Batman’s cowl. His moll, Lisa, admires the notion, but his two thugs are wondering when they’ll get paid. The Hatter then shows off the death trap in his hat factory—all stuff used to make hats, but which will kill a person, like, say, Batman.\n\nHe then reveals that the people he’s kidnapped are the actual jurors in his trial. He plans to ransom them for all the president’s hats, currently on display at a local museum, and worth millions.\n\nBatman and Robin question the hat-check girl, Babette, at the event where the fire chief was kidnapped. They then follow up on a sighting of the Hatter at Maison Magda, a hat shop where Lisa works as saleswoman. However, they arrive too late to keep the Hatter from kidnapping Madam Magda, who was also on the jury.\n\nLisa hands Batman a business card that the kidnapper “dropped.” They take it back to the Batcave. It has the name of a sculptor, Octave Marbot, who is making a statue of Batman to put in the prison to inspire the prisoners. Robin says that’s a great idea, which is the opposite of what’s true. (Seriously, all that’ll do is remind the prisoners why they’re there…) They determine that the pattern of places where the people were kidnapped, as well as Marbot’s studio make the shape of a top-hat on a Gotham City map.\n\nThe Hatter goes to Marbot’s studio, hits him with the mesmerizer, and then takes his place, wearing his beret and smock and a very obviously fake beard. Batman and Robin arrive, and the Hatter greets them posing as Marbot with the worst French accent in the history of humanity.\n\n“Marbot” then asks if Batman would take the time for a sitting, but Batman doesn’t have time. He does agree to loan “Marbot” his cowl so he can adjust the head. They go into the dressing room, ostensibly for him to remove the cowl in private and Robin can bring it out to the sculptor. However, Batman saw through the ruse, not because he’s met Marbot and Tetch looks and sounds nothing like him, but because the real Marbot was quite happy with the head of the statue and wouldn’t need to adjust it. Right. Once they determine that the real Marbot is safe, fisticuffs ensue. Batman and Robin take down the Hatter’s thugs, but when the Hatter tries to use his mesmerizer on Batman, he uses a mirror to reflect it away—\n\n—but right at Robin! The Boy Wonder falls to the floor, and Batman’s so devastated that the Hatter easily throws him into the wall right under the hardening plaster dispenser, which drenches Batman in wet plaster that is hardening fast.\n\nThe Hatter forces Marbot to cut away the head of the newly formed Bat statue so he can have a mold of the cowl. He’s tied Robin to a marble horse and sends one thug out to steal the Batmobile. However, Batman—who apparently can hold his breath for as long as it takes to tie up Robin and chip away at a statue—just held his breath and then broke out when Marbot’s chipping weakened the plaster enough for Batman to physically break through.\n\nThe Hatter and his thugs try to get away in the Batmobile, but the same anti-theft device that got the Riddler gets them, and they run away on foot instead. They get away by virtue of Batman taking the time to dust himself off and offer to help Marbot clean up his shop.\n\nThey return to the Batcave. The Hatter mentioned the cowl as being his thirteenth hat. It turns out six other people have been reported to be kidnapped along with their headgear. Batman and Robin speculate as to what comes in twelves, but there are too many possible answers, so they consult the computer. Eventually, they figure out that the Hatter is taking the jurors at his trial.\n\nGordon fetches the list of jurors, and the last name is Turkey Bowinkle. Yes, really. Batman sends Alfred to Bowinkle’s Bowling Alley in order to slip a tracer on his hat. Alfred poses as a genealogist, contriving a ridiculous excuse to look at his hat, but Bowinkle—who’s not the sharpest knife in the drawer—won’t let him see it. Lisa then arrives, distracting Bowinkle with her hotness. Alfred, realizing he no longer has a captive audience, pays for his drink and leaves, using Lisa’s distraction to check out Bowinkle’s office and put the tracer on the hat.\n\nLisa, of course, is there for the Hatter, claiming to be a reporter for a fashion magazine that has listed him as the best-hatted man in Gotham. He tells her it’s in the office, and she signals the Hatter, who arrives in Bowinkle’s office right after Alfred has placed the tracer in the bowler’s bowler. The Hatter takes the hat and confronts Bowinkle. They struggle briefly for the bowler, which reveals the tracer, and then the Hatter mesmerizes Bowinkle, taking him away.\n\nThe Hatter leaves the tracer on the bowler in the hopes of trapping Batman, and it works. The Dynamic Duo climb the wall and burst through the window, but the Hatter and the thugs get the drop on them. They’re led at gunpoint to the hat factory, but Batman manages to use a nearby scarf to get the drop right back on them, and fisticuffs ensue. At one point, Robin is knocked out, and put on the conveyer belt of the hat factory—yet he goes through the rabbit shearer and the blades without being hurt before Batman frees him. In the end, Batman kicks the Hatter into the acid cleaner, from which he emerges completely unscathed, but somewhat dazed.\n\nLater, Bruce and Dick take Harriet to Madam Magda’s to buy her a hat for her birthday, probably by way of making up for being kidnapped and losing her saleswoman to prison.\n\nFetch the Bat-shark-repellant! It’s the triumphant return of the Giant Lighted Lucite Map of Gotham City! I love the Giant Lighted Lucite Map of Gotham City! The Giant Lighted Lucite Map of Gotham City is the best! We also have the Anti-Mesmerizing Bat Reflector (which is, basically, a mirror) and a Bat-tracer, which they follow with the Detect-a-Scope in the Batmobile. At one point, we get a look at the International Frequency Computer, which they don’t use, but there’s the Anti-Crime Computer, which leads them to figure out that the jury’s been kidnapped.\n\nHoly #@!%$, Batman! When the fire chief is kidnapped, Robin cries, “Holy helmets!” He says “Holy switcheroo” when he realizes that the Hatter has disguised himself as Marbot. Just as he falls to the reflected mesmerizer, he mutters, “Holy ricochet.” At the revelation that Batman held his breath, a stunned Robin cries, “Holy frog-man!” while the later revelation that the Hatter found the tracer in Bowinkle’s hat prompts a “Holy bowler!”\n\nGotham City’s finest. Gordon acquires the list of jurors in the Hatter’s trial. He’s staring right at it, yet he has no idea why Batman would want it, even though eleven of the twelve names on it are the same as the eleven people who’ve been kidnapped. Dumbass.\n\nNo sex, please, we’re superheroes. Lisa is completely smitten with the Hatter, to the point of fawning, and Babette the hat-check girl and Hermione Monteagle are equally smitten with Batman, who remains utterly oblivious to their drooling.\n\nSpecial Guest Villain. David Wayne debuts the Mad Hatter. He’ll return to the role in season 2’s “The Contaminated Cowl” / “The Mad Hatter Runs Afowl,” also written by Charles Hoffman.\n\nNa-na na-na na-na na-na na. “I’m a practical man.”\n\nThe Mad Hatter’s line shortly before he discusses his plan to ransom twelve people for a hat collection.\n\nTrivial matters: This episode was discussed on The Batcave Podcast episode 7 by host John S. Drew with special guest chum, Linda-Ali Cruz.\n\nFor the first time, both the voiceover and the text use “Same Bat-time, same Bat-channel!” for the cliffhanger.\n\nThis episode borrowed bits from several comic book appearances of the Mad Hatter: Detective Comics #230 by Bill Finger & Sheldon Moldoff, Batman #161 by Dave Wood & Moldoff, and Batman #49 by Finger.\n\nThe Mad Hatter who appears in this episode is based on the second villain to call himself that, who first appeared in the aforementioned Detective #230 in 1956—he even used the same name as the original Hatter (who first appeared in Batman #49 in 1948). Later (some fifteen years after this episode aired), it was revealed that the second Tetch was an impostor and the original took the moniker back. The second Hatter recently appeared as “Hatman” in Batman #700.\n\nDiane McBain, who plays Lisa, will return in the Green Hornet crossover episodes “A Piece of the Action”/”Batman’s Satisfaction” as Pinky Pinkston.\n\nPow! Biff! Zowie! “How could I have been so stupid?” Aspects of this episode work rather well. David Wayne is obviously having a grand old time as the Hatter—or, rather, Jervis Tetch. This is the second code-named villain whose real name is also revealed, but unlike Mr. Freeze (a.k.a. Dr. Art Schivel) whose name is only mentioned once or twice, this one is used as often as the Lewis Carroll-inspired sobriquet, probably because “Jervis Tetch” is fun to say out loud.\n\nAnyhow, Wayne is fun, and I really like Diane McBain’s performance as Lisa. Unlike all the previous molls who were either bored young women in it for kicks or good women led astray by the lure of evil, Lisa is a total sociopath. She takes absolute glee in observing how the hat factory deathtrap works, and just in general is an eager participant in the Hatter’s schemes. (More so than the two thugs, who are mostly peeved that they haven’t gotten paid. Then again, Lisa actually has a day job…)\n\nUnfortunately, the storyline has lots of nonsensical stuff, even by this show’s high standards. It starts with the emphasis on hats being stolen, with the actual people being kidnapped as an afterthought. At the start when Gordon gets the report, all the way through to later when Batman calls Gordon for an update, everyone’s emphasizing the haberdashery and not the kidnapping. Hell, in most cases, you probably can’t even tell the hats were also taken (viz. the chef, who was wearing the thing when he was taken). The general lack of concern for people is kind of appalling.\n\nSo is the policework. At least Batman is kind enough to admit to being stupid when he finally cottons to what the kidnap victims all have in common, but Gordon doesn’t figure it out when he’s staring at a list of the jurors.\n\nAnd finally, we get a truly awesome deathtrap—and it’s not the cliffhanger! And when it is used, it doesn’t work! Seriously, Robin lays on it and then is not skinned or sliced, even though he goes right through those two parts of the deathtrap. Lame.\n\nBat-rating: 6\n\nKeith R.A. DeCandido‘s latest work is an essay that lists the top ten good things about the Star Wars prequel trilogy in A Long Time Ago: Exploring the Star Wars Cinematic Universe, just released by Sequart.

The basketball team and the cheerleaders are both practicing in the gym. Also in the gym, Dick is lifting weights. After they run their routine, the cheerleaders are thirsty, so they go to a vending machine that dispenses milk—\n\n—except this one instead gives out piles of silver dollars. Gordon suspects that this totally pointless and victimless crime is the work of the Joker, though to be fair, he has a legitimate concern that the Joker is targeting the youth of Gotham for a more nefarious purpose.\n\nThe Bat-phone interrupts the latest in a series of implorations by a city politician to convince Bruce to run for mayor, especially now with the water shortage and the regular blackouts. (They ask him every two years. He always declines, saying his charitable work with the Wayne Foundation requires that he stay above the fray of politics.) Batman heads to the Batmobile solo, as Dick is still at school—so he’s already at the scene of the crime.\n\nGordon shows Batman some paperwork on his arrival: Joker was released from prison a week ago and immediately bought up the One-Armed Bandit Novelty Company, which makes pinball machines, vending machines, and the like. The people who installed the milk machines have clean records, and they’re just as confused about what happened as everyone else.\n\nThey’re interrupted by a call from Principal Schoolfield. The candy machine in the library is now dispensing negotiable stocks and bonds. Batman asks that he call a meeting with the student council (the president of which just happens to be a very bright young lad named Richard Grayson), and he’ll be there shortly.\n\nDick is at the principal’s office, along with the rest of the student council: Susie (one of the cheerleaders), Pete, and Herbie. The other three are arguing that if you get free money from a vending machine, what’s the point of studying? Everyone’s goofing off. Dick, though, argues that they’re supposed to be student leaders and know better. But then S"
