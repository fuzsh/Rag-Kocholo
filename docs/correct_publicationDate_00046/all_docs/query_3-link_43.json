They included direct adaptations of actual color television episode frames (with word balloons) in a graphic novel format. These books were the closest thing to viewing episodes on demand (strangely, in Day of the Dove, the features of Mara [Susan Howard] are obscured). Other television series and movies of the late 1970s, such as Battlestar Galactica also used this format.\n\nListed below are books from Star Trek: The Original Series (Mandala Productions/Bantam Books):\n\nFotoNovel 1: The City on the Edge of Forever\n\nFotoNovel 2: Where No Man Has Gone Before\n\nFotoNovel 3: The Trouble with Tribbles\n\nFotoNovel 4: A Taste of Armageddon\n\nFotoNovel 5: Metamorphosis\n\nFotoNovel 6: All Our Yesterdays\n\nFotoNovel 7: The Galileo Seven\n\nFotoNovel 8: A Piece of the Action\n\nFotoNovel 9: The Devil in the Dark\n\nFotoNovel 10: Day of the Dove\n\nFotoNovel 11: The Deadly Years\n\nFotoNovel 12: Amok Time.\n\nMovie adaptations from Pocket Books:\n\nStar Trek: The Motion Picture: The Photostory, edited by Richard J.
