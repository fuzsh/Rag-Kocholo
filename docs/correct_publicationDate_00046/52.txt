In that respect DeCandido (and John Ford's "The Final Reflection") are unusual in providing a handy glossary. I wish more authors did this - and not just in sci-fi novels. >We also see the term QuchHa' again.

It was also used in the English edition sold a month later. >According to the comic, only some of the Klingons lost their ridges. >The smoothheaded ones were called QuchHa', the unhappy ones. > >Personally, I find this quite fitting. Since as a noun, Quch means >forhead. And even though it's a linguistic stretch, if -Ha' worked as >a noun suffix, QuchHa' would describe TOS Klingons quite well. Sort of like "the un-cola" (i.e. Seven-Up) in English. I've seen *{Quchqoq} "so-called forehead" used for this, but I like *{QuchHa'} better: "de-foreheaded" as it were. It violates the rules, but it does so for a reason. Okrand acknowledges these "nonce" words: KGT 176: Sometimes words or phrases are coined for a specific occasion, intentionally violating grammatical rules in order to have an impact. Usually these are never heard again, though some gain currency and might as well be classified as slang. Klingon grammarians call such forms {mu'mey ru'} ("temporary words"). Sometimes, {mu'mey ru'} fill a void--that is, give voice to an idea for which there is no standard (or even slang) expression; sometimes, like slang, they are just more emphatic ways of expressing an idea. A common way to create these constructions is to bend the grammatical rules somewhat, violating the norm in a way that is so obvious that there is no question that it is being done intentionally. To do this is expressed in Klingon as {pabHa'} ("misfollow [the rules], follow [the rules] wrongly"). >the Year of Kahless 799, early in the month of Lo'Bral >the Year of Kahless 844, early in the month of Merruthj >The Year of Kahless 895, early in the month of Xan'lahr >the Year of Kahless 921, early in the month of Soo'jen > >(apparently action only happens during the begining of Klingon months) And never in the same month! <g> For lack of other, more official, names we can add these to what we know about Klingon months: 1. (QI'lop}, the holiday honoring the Klingon military, occurs in the tenth Klingon month. (PK) 2. Alexander was born on the 43rd day of Maktag. (TNG "New Ground") 3. Kohlar asked the pregnant B'Elanna, "Did you conceive during the holy month of Nay'Poq?" (VOY "Prophecy") >we are then told that Kang and Mara's son is named DaqS I believe in DS9 "Blood Oath" we heard that Kang's son was named after Kurzon Dax. Personally, I would have thought "Kurzon" would have sounded more Klingon. (No point in making the boy's life mor difficult than necessary.) Maybe Kang always called him Dax. >kilaan - a unit of time, oddly not defined given the writing style. It >appears to mean "hour". I'm rather confused why they invented a term. >Or am I simply unaware of an existing Klingonease term? AFAIK {rep} "hour" is the only one. I did a quick Google search and found that the authors did not invent this. kilaan - [n] A unit of time. ("Klingons!" [TOSF (Original Series Fan Fiction)]) ["The Klingonaase guide" by McReynolds (http://www.khemorex-klinzhai.de/Hol/klingonaase.html)] There's a very nice page in the Memory Beta website devoted to "Forged in Fire" at http://startrek.wikia.com/wiki/Forged_in_Fire where *kilaan* "a unit of time" is listed along with entries on other "Klingon" words and the characters. Take a look at this site to save yourself some typing. > "QI'yaH!" cried the albino.
