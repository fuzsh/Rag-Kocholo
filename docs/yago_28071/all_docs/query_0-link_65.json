The marriage was tumultuous and ended in separation, but it bore two children, Eugène and Hortense. He was executed during the Reign of Terror.\n\nImprisoned during the Revolution but released five days after Alexandre's execution, Joséphine emerged as a prominent social figure in post-revolutionary France. She caught the eye of Napoleon Bonaparte, a young and ambitious military leader. They married in March of 1796.\n\nJoséphine became Empress when Napoleon declared himself Emperor of the French in 1804. Her grace and style were synonymous with the imperial court, and she played a key role in cultivating the arts and fashion of the era.\n\nDespite this, their marriage was challenged by political pressures and personal tribulations, notably their inability to produce an heir, which was a source of profound distress for Napoleon, who was obsessed with his dynastic legacy.\n\nIn 1810, under the heavy weight of state matters and the need for a male successor, Napoleon made the difficult decision to divorce Joséphine. The divorce was amicable, and Napoleon provided for her and declared her \"Empress for life,\" allowing her to keep the title of Empress Joséphine.\n\nShe lived out her remaining years at the Château de Malmaison, her personal residence near Paris, which she had carefully cultivated into a place of botanical and artistic wonder, particularly renowned for its rose garden.\n\nBorn: June 23, 1763\n\nBirthplace: Les Trois-Îlets, Martinique, French Antilles\n\nStar Sign: Cancer\n\nDied: May 29, 1814 (aged 50)\n\nCause of Death: Pneumonia\n\nHistorical Events\n\nAlexandre de Beauharnais, first husband of Joséphine de Beauharnais, is arrested during the Reign of Terror (later executed)\n\nJoséphine de Beauharnais, future Empress of French and first wife of Napoleon Bonaparte, is imprisoned during the Reign of Terror\n\nAlexandre de Beauharnais, the first husband of Joséphine de Beauharnais, is executed for treason during the Reign of Terror\n\nJoséphine de Beauharnais, future Empress of the French and first wife of Napoleon Bonaparte, is released from prison five days after the execution of her first husband, Alexandre de Beauharnais\n\nPersonal Life\n\nJoséphine de Beauharnais, future Empress of the French, marries her first husband, Alexandre de Beauharnais, in Paris\n\nNapoléon Bonaparte (26) marries his first wife Joséphine de Beauharnais (32), changing her name from Rose\n\nReferences\n\nJoséphine de Beauharnais - Chateau de Versailles\n\nFamous Queens"
