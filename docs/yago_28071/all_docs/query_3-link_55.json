Through her daughter, Hortense, she was the maternal grandmother of Napoléon III. Through her son, she was the great-grandmother of the latest Swedish and Danish kings and queens, as well as the last Queen of Greece.

Två barn i första äktenskapet; Eugène de Beauharnais (1781-1824) och Hortense de Beauharnais (1783-1837). Farmor till Josefina av Leuchtenberg, som genom sitt äktenskap med Oscar I blev drottning av Sverige.\n\nHennes far var plantageägare på Martinique och tillhörde en fransk släkt som utvandrat till Västindien i början på 1700-talet. 1779 gifte hon sig med Alexandre de Beauharnais. Äktenskapet var stundtals olyckligt och de levde separerade en tid, men återförenades. Alexandre de Beauharnais blev avrättad 1794 under franska revolutionen. Joséphine anklagades för att vara rojalist och fick tillbringa en tid i fängelse.\n\nEfter sitt frisläppande kom Joséphine att bli en av de ledande inom societeten i Paris. Napoleon blev redan vid deras första möte fullkomligt betagen av den vackra Joséphine, och de gifte sig 9 mars 1796. Under sin bortovaro, i krig i Italien och på fälttåg i Egypten, skrev Napoleon glödande kärleksbrev till henne. Joséphine kröntes till fransmännens kejsarinna 2 december 1804.\n\nÄktenskapet upplöstes 16 december 1809, eftersom Joséphine inte kunde föda den arvinge som Napoleon så hett önskade; hon hade blivit steril efter ett fall i en trappa. Hon fick behålla sin titel som kejsarinna och bosatte sig på slottet Malmaison utanför Paris. Vid Malmaison lät hon en berömd trädgårdsmästare, Dupont, anlägga en rosengård med rosor som hon genom sin ställning kunde skaffa sig från hela Europa. Vid Malmaison påbörjades ett rosförädlingarbete som blev av vikt, och några rossorter som ännu odlas kommer härifrån.\n\nÄven efter deras skilsmässa fortsatte Napoleon att träffa Joséphine då och då - det sägs att hon var hans livs stora kärlek.\n\nAv sina samtida beskrivs Joséphine som en livsälskande och godhjärtad kvinna, som aldrig tvekade att hjälpa de nödlidande i samhället, men även som fåfäng och slösaktig.\n\nJoséphine avled i sviterna efter en svår förkylning. Hon ådrog sig denna under en fest för den ryske tsaren Alexander I på Malmaison, när hon, fåfäng som hon var, inte ville neka honom åsynen av sina vackra skuldror och därför underlät att bära en sjal över axlarna när hon promenerade runt med den ryske tsaren i slottsparken.\n\nJoséphine de Beauharnais kamégarnityr [redigera]\n\nDet så kallade kamégarnityret består av diadem, halsband, örhängen, brosch och två armband. Garnityret är gjort i flera material som guld, pärlor, briljanter och stora kaméer. Det var en gåva från kejsar Napoleon till sin hustru Josephine omkring 1805.\n\nDet kom att ärvas av kejsarinnan Josephines sondotter, drottning Josefina, gift med Oscar I . När drottning Josefina dog 1876 testamenterade hon i sin tur hela kamégarnityret till sin enda dotter prinsessan Eugenie som gav dem i arv till brorsonen prins Eugen . Prinsessan Sibylla fick dem som bröllopsgåva 1932 av prins Eugen, när hon gifte sig med arvprins Gustaf Adolf . Idag är det drottning Silvia som bär smyckena som ingår i Bernadottestiftelsen.\n\nVid bröllop Diademet bars av drottning Silvia som brudkrona den 19 juni 1976. Det har även burits av prinsessan Birgitta och prinsessan Desirée vid deras respektive bröllop.\n\nFöreträdare:\n\nNy titel\n\n(med titeln drottning: Marie Antoinette)\n\nKejsarinna av Frankrike (ej regent)\n\n1804–1809 Efterträdare:\n\nMarie Louise av Österrike\n\nSidan ändrades senast den 24 maj 2010 kl. 01.19\n\nJoséphine de Beauharnais was the first wife of Napoleon I, and thus the first Empress of the French (commonly called Empress Joséphine or just Joséphine).\n\nHer marriage to Napoleon I was her second; her first husband Alexandre de Beauharnais was guillotined during the Reign of Terror, and she was imprisoned in the Carmes prison until five days after Alexandre's execution. Her two children by Alexandre became significant to royal lineage. Through her daughter, Hortense, she was the maternal grandmother of Napoléon III. Through her son, Eugène, she was the great-grandmother of later Swedish and Danish kings and queens. The reigning houses of Belgium, Norway and Luxembourg also descend from her. She did not bear Napoleon any children; as a result, he divorced her in 1810 to marry Marie Louise of Austria.\n\nJoséphine was the recipient of numerous love letters written by Napoleon, many of which still exist. Her Château de Malmaison was noted for its magnificent rose garden, which she supervised closely, owing to her passionate interest in roses, collected from all over the world.\n\nMarie Josèphe Rose Tascher de La Pagerie was born in Les Trois-Îlets, Martinique to a wealthy white Creole family that owned a sugarcane plantation, which is now a museum.[1] She was the eldest daughter of Joseph-Gaspard Tascher (1735–1790), knight, Seigneur de (lord of) la Pagerie, lieutenant of Troupes de Marine, and his wife, the former Rose-Claire des Vergers de Sannois (1736–1807), whose maternal grandfather, Anthony Brown, may have been Irish.\n\nThe family struggled financially after hurricanes destroyed their estate in 1766. Edmée (French, Desirée), Joséphine's paternal aunt, had been the mistress of François, Vicomte de Beauharnais, a French aristocrat. When François's health began to fail, Edmée arranged the advantageous marriage of her niece, Catherine-Désirée, to François's son Alexandre. This marriage would be highly beneficial for the Tascher family, because it would keep the Beauharnais money in their hands; however, 12-year-old Catherine died on 16 October 1777, before she could leave Martinique for France. In service to their aunt Edmée's goals, Catherine was replaced by her older sister, Joséphine.\n\nIn October 1779, Joséphine went to France with her father. She married Alexandre on 13 December 1779, in Noisy-le-Grand. They had two children: a son, Eugène de Beauharnais (1781–1824), and a daughter, Hortense de Beauharnais (1783–1837) (who later married Napoléon's brother Louis Bonaparte in 1802). Joséphine and Alexandre's marriage was not a happy one, leading to a court-ordered separation during which she and the children lived at Alexandre's expense in the Pentemont Abbey. On 2 March 1794, during the Reign of Terror, the Committee of Public Safety ordered the arrest of her husband. He was jailed in the Carmes prison in Paris. Considering Joséphine as too close to the counter-revolutionary financial circles, the Committee ordered her arrest on 18 April 1794. A warrant of arrest was issued against her on 2 Floréal, year II (April 21, 1794), and she was imprisoned in the Carmes prison until 10 Thermidor, year II (28 July 1794).\n\nHer husband was accused of having poorly defended Mainz in July 1793, and being considered an aristocratic \"suspect\", was sentenced to death and guillotined, with his cousin Augustin, on 23 July 1794, on the Place de la Révolution (today's Place de la Concorde) in Paris. Joséphine was freed five days later, thanks to the fall and execution of Robespierre, which ended the Reign of Terror. On 27 July 1794, Tallien arranged the liberation of Thérèse Cabarrus, and soon after that of Joséphine. In June 1795, a new law allowed her to recover the possessions of Alexandre.\n\nJoséphine de Beauharnais had affairs with several leading political figures, including Paul François Jean Nicolas Barras. In 1795, she met Napoléon Bonaparte, six years her junior, and became his mistress. In a letter to her in December, he wrote, \"I awake full of you. Your image and the memory of last night’s intoxicating pleasures has left no rest to my senses.\" In January 1796, Napoléon Bonaparte proposed to her and they married on 9 March. Until meeting Bonaparte, she was known as Rose, but Bonaparte preferred to call her Joséphine, the name she adopted from then on.\n\nThe marriage was not well received by Napoléon's family, who were shocked that he had married an older widow with two children. His mother and sisters were especially resentful of Joséphine as they felt clumsy and unsophisticated in her presence. Two days after the wedding, Bonaparte left to lead the French army in Italy. During their separation, he sent her many love letters. In February 1797, he wrote: “You to whom nature has given spirit, sweetness, and beauty, you who alone can move and rule my heart, you who know all too well the absolute empire you exercise over it!”\n\nJoséphine, left behind in Paris, began an affair in 1796 with a handsome Hussar lieutenant, Hippolyte Charles. Rumors of the affair reached Napoléon; he was infuriated, and his love for her changed entirely.\n\nIn 1798, Napoléon led a French army to Egypt. During this campaign, Napoléon started an affair of his own with Pauline Fourès, the wife of a junior officer, who became known as \"Napoléon's Cleopatra.\" The relationship between Joséphine and Napoléon was never the same after this. His letters became less loving. No subsequent lovers of Joséphine are recorded, but Napoléon had sexual affairs with several other women. In 1804, he said, \"Power is my mistress.\"\n\nIn December 1800, Joséphine was nearly killed in the Plot of the rue Saint-Nicaise, an attempt on Napoléon's life with a bomb planted in a parked cart. On December 24, she and Napoleon went to see a performance of Joseph Haydn's Creation at the Opéra, accompanied by several friends and family. The party travelled in two carriages. Joséphine was in the second, with her daughter, Hortense; her pregnant sister-in-law, Caroline Murat; and General Jean Rapp. Joséphine had delayed the party while getting a new silk shawl draped correctly, and Napoléon went ahead in the first carriage. The bomb exploded as her carriage was passing. The bomb killed several bystanders and one of the carriage horses, and blew out the carriage's windows; Hortense was struck in the hand by flying glass. There were no other injuries and the party proceeded to the Opéra.\n\nThe coronation ceremony, officiated by Pope Pius VII, took place at Notre Dame de Paris, on 2 December 1804. Following a pre-arranged protocol, Napoléon first crowned himself, then put the crown on Joséphine's head, proclaiming her empress.\n\nIn her role as empress, Napoleon had a court appointed to her and reinstated the offices which composed the household of the queen before the French revolution, with Adélaïde de La Rochefoucauld as Première dame d'honneur, Émilie de Beauharnais as Dame d'atour, and the wives of his own officials and generals, Jeanne Charlotte du Lucay, Madame de Rémusat, Elisabeth Baude de Talhouët, Lauriston, d'Arberg, Marie Antoinette Duchâtel, Sophie de Segur, Séran, Colbert, Savary and Aglaé Louise Auguié Ney, as Dame de Palais.\n\nShortly before their coronation, there was an incident at the Château de Saint-Cloud that nearly sundered the marriage between the two. Joséphine caught Napoléon in the bedroom of her lady-in-waiting, Élisabeth de Vaudey, and Napoléon threatened to divorce her as she had not produced an heir. Eventually, however, through the efforts of her daughter Hortense, the two were reconciled.\n\nWhen after a few years it became clear she could not have a child, Napoléon, while still loving Joséphine, began to think very seriously about the possibility of divorce. The final die was cast when Joséphine's grandson Napoléon Charles Bonaparte who had been declared Napoléon's heir, died of croup in 1807. Napoleon began to create lists of eligible princesses. At dinner on 30 November 1809, he let Joséphine know that—in the interest of France—he must find a wife who could produce an heir.\n\nJoséphine agreed to the divorce so the Emperor could remarry in the hope of having an heir. The divorce ceremony took place on 10 January 1810 and was a grand but solemn social occasion, and each read a statement of devotion to the other.\n\nOn March 11, Napoléon married Marie-Louise of Austria by proxy; the formal ceremony took place at the Louvre in April. Napoléon once remarked after marrying Marie-Louise that despite her quick infatuation with him \"he had married a womb\".[citation needed] Even after their separation, Napoleon insisted Joséphine retain the title of empress. \"It is my will that she retain the rank and title of empress, and especially that she never doubt my sentiments, and that she ever hold me as her best and dearest friend.\"\n\nAfter the divorce, Joséphine lived at the Château de Malmaison, near Paris. She remained on good terms with Napoléon, who once said that the only thing to come between them was her debts. (Joséphine remarked privately, \"The only thing that ever came between us was my debts; certainly not his manhood.\"—Andrew Roberts, Napoleon)\n\nIn March 1811 Marie Louise delivered a long-awaited heir, to whom Napoleon gave the title \"King of Rome\". Two years later Napoleon arranged for Joséphine to meet the young prince \"who had cost her so many tears\".\n\nJoséphine died in Rueil-Malmaison on 29 May 1814, soon after walking with Tsar Alexander in the gardens of Malmaison. She was buried in the nearby church of Saint Pierre-Saint Paul in Rueil. Her daughter Hortense is interred near her.\n\nNapoleon learned of her death via a French journal while in exile on Elba, and stayed locked in his room for two days, refusing to see anyone. He claimed to a friend, while in exile on Saint Helena, that \"I truly loved my Joséphine, but I did not respect her.\" Despite his numerous affairs, eventual divorce, and remarriage, the Emperor's last words on his death bed at St. Helena were: \"France, the Army, the Head of the Army, Joséphine.\"(\"France, l'armée, tête d'armée, Joséphine\").\n\nHenry H. Breen, First Mayor of Castries, published The History of St. Lucia in 1844 and stated on page 159 that: \"I have met with several well-informed persons in St. Lucia, who entertain the conviction that Mademoiselle Tascher de La Pagerie, better known as Empress Josephine, was born in the island of Saint Lucia and not Martinique as commonly supposed. Amongst others the late Sir John Jeremie appears to have been strongly pressed with the idea.\n\nThe grounds of belief rest upon the following circumstances to which I find allusions are made in a St. Lucia newspaper in 1831: 'It is alleged that the de Taschers were among the French families that settled in St. Lucia after the Peace of 1763; that upon a small estate on the acclivity of Morne Paix Bouche (which was called La Cauzette), where the future Empress first saw light on the 23rd of June of that year; and they continued to reside there until 1771, at which period the father was selected for the important office of the Intendant of Martinique, whither he immediately returned with his family.'\n\nThese circumstances are well known to many respectable St. Lucian families, including the late Mme. Darlas Delomel and M. Martin Raphael who were among Josephine's playmates at Morne Paix Bouche. M. Raphael being in France many years after, was induced to pay a visit to Malmaison on the strength of his former acquaintance, and met with a gracious reception from the Empress-Queen Dowager.\" Henry Breen also received confirmation from Josephine's former slave nanny called \"Dede\", who claimed she nursed Josephine at La Cauzette. Josephine's baptism was administered by Pere Emmanuel Capuchin at Trois-Ilets but he has only stated she had been baptized there but not born. Dom Daviot, parish priest in Gros Islet, wrote a letter to one of his friends in Haute-Saône in 1802 in which he states: \"it is in the vicinity of my parish that the wife of the first consul was born,\" at the time, Paix Bouche was a part of Castries; he asserts that he was well acquainted with Josephine's cousin who was a parishioner.\n\nIt is also interesting to note that Josephine's father owned an estate in Soufriere Quarter called Malmaison, the name of her now famous French residence. It is also assumed that the de Taschers estate in Martinique was a pied-a-terre [occasional lodging] with his mother-in-law. St Lucia switched hands between England and France 14 times and at the time of Joesphine's birth there were no civil registers on the island that would explain her baptism in Martinique; however, St. Lucia's frequent change of ownership between England and France could be seen as the reason Josephine's birthplace was left out on her Birth record as it would have affected her nationality.\n\nHortense's son became Napoléon III, Emperor of the French. Eugène's son Maximilian de Beauharnais, 3rd Duke of Leuchtenberg married into the Russian Imperial family, was granted the style of Imperial Highness and founded the Russian line of the Beauharnais family, while Eugene's daughter Joséphine married King Oscar I of Sweden, the son of Napoléon's one-time fiancée, Désirée Clary. Through her, Joséphine is a direct ancestor of the present heads of the royal houses of Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Luxembourg, Norway and Sweden and of the grandducal house of Baden.\n\nA number of jewels worn by modern-day royals are often said to have been worn by Joséphine. Through the Leuchtenberg inheritance, the Norwegian royal family possesses an emerald and diamond parure said to have been Joséphine's. The Swedish royal family owns several pieces of jewelry frequently linked to Joséphine, including the Leuchtenberg Sapphire Parure, a suite of amethyst jewels, and the Cameo Parure, worn by Sweden's royal brides.[22] However, a number of these jewels were probably never a part of Joséphine's collection at all, but instead belonged to other members of her family.\n\nAnother of Eugène's daughters, Amélie de Beauharnais von Leuchtenberg, married Emperor Pedro I of Brazil (also former king Pedro IV of Portugal) in Rio de Janeiro, and became Empress of Brazil, and they had one surviving daughter.\n\nTime journalist Nathalie Alexandria Kotchoubey de Beauharnais, was a direct descendant of Joséphine through her son Eugène and the Russian line founded by Josephine's grandson Maximilian de Beauharnais, 3rd Duke of Leuchtenberg. She married André Laguerre, longtime managing editor of Sports Illustrated in 1955 and had two daughters, Michèle and Claudine.\n\nJoséphine de Beauharnais's extended family member Stéphanie de Beauharnais is an ancestor to the reigning Prince of Monaco, through her daughter Princess Marie Amelie of Baden, and of the present heads of the princely house of Hohenzollern and royal houses of Romania, Yugoslavia and Italy, through her daughter Princess Josephine of Baden.\n\nBiographer Carolly Erickson wrote, “In choosing her lovers Rose [Josephine] followed her head first, then her heart”, meaning that she was adept in terms of identifying the men who were most capable of fulfilling her financial and social needs. She was not unaware of Napoleon's potential. Joséphine was a renowned spendthrift and Barras may have encouraged the relationship with Général Bonaparte in order to get her off his hands. Josephine was naturally full of kindness, generosity and charm, and was praised as an engaging hostess.\n\nJoséphine was described as being of average height, svelte, shapely, with silky, long, chestnut-brown hair, hazel eyes, and a rather sallow complexion. Her nose was small and straight, and her mouth was well-formed; however she kept it closed most of the time so as not to reveal her bad teeth. She was praised for her elegance, style, and low, \"silvery\", beautifully modulated voice.\n\nIn 1799 while Napoleon was in Egypt, Josephine purchased the Chateau de Malmaison. She had it landscaped in an “English” style, hiring landscapers and horticulturalists from the United Kingdom. These included Thomas Blaikie, a Scottish horticultural expert, another Scottish gardener, Alexander Howatson, the botanist, Ventenat, and the horticulturist, Andre Dupont. The rose garden was begun soon after purchase; inspired by Dupont’s love of roses. Josephine took a personal interest in the gardens and the roses, and learned a great deal about botany and horticulture from her staff. Josephine wanted to collect all known roses so Napoleon ordered his warship commanders to search all seized vessels for plants to be forwarded to Malmaison. Pierre-Joseph Redouté was commissioned by her to paint the flowers from her gardens. Les Roses was published 1817–20 with 168 plates of roses; 75–80 of the roses grew at Malmaison. The English nurseryman Kennedy was a major supplier, despite England and France being at war, his shipments were allowed to cross blockades. Specifically, when Hume’s Blush Tea-Scented China was imported to England from China, the British and French Admiralties made arrangements in 1810 for specimens to cross naval blockades for Josephine’s garden. Sir Joseph Banks, Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, also sent her roses. The general assumption is that she had about 250 roses in her garden when she died in 1814. Unfortunately the roses were not catalogued during her tenure. There may have been only 197 rose varieties in existence in 1814, according to calculations by Jules Gravereaux of Roseraie de l’Haye. There were 12 species, about 40 centifolias, mosses and damasks, 20 Bengals, and about 100 gallicas. The botanist Claude Antoine Thory, who wrote the descriptions for Redouté’s paintings in Les Roses, noted that Josephine’s Bengal rose R. indica had black spots on it.[32] She produced the first written history of the cultivation of roses, and is believed to have hosted the first rose exhibition, in 1810.\n\nModern hybridization of roses through artificial, controlled pollination began with Josephine’s horticulturalist Andre Dupont. Prior to this, most new rose cultivars were spontaneous mutations or accidental, bee-induced hybrids, and appeared rarely. With controlled pollination, the appearance of new cultivars grew exponentially. Of the roughly 200 types of roses known to Josephine, Dupont had created 25 while in her employ. Subsequent French hybridizers created over 1000 new rose cultivars in the 30 years following Josephine's death. In 1910, less than 100 years after her death, there were about 8000 rose types in Gravereaux's garden. Bechtel also feels that the popularity of roses as garden plants was boosted by Josephine’s patronage. She was a popular ruler and fashionable people copied her.\n\nBrenner and Scanniello call her the \"Godmother of modern rosomaniacs\" and attribute her with our modern style of vernacular cultivar names as opposed to Latinized, pseudo-scientific cultivar names. For instance, R. alba incarnata became \"Cuisse de Nymphe Emue\" in her garden. After Josephine’s death in 1814 the house was vacant at times, the garden and house ransacked and vandalised, and the garden’s remains were destroyed in a battle in 1870. The rose 'Souvenir de la Malmaison' appeared in 1844, 30 years after her death, named in her honor by a Russian Grand Duke planting one of the first specimens in the Imperial Garden in St. Petersburg.\n\nGEDCOM Note\n\n{geni:occupation} Empress of France 1804, Impératrice {geni:about_me} Full name: Marie Josèphe Rose Tascher de la Pagerie\n\nJoséphine de Beauharnais\n\nhttp://www.peoples.ru/family/wife/bogarne/history.html\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9phine_de_Beauharnais\n\nJoséphine de Beauharnais (Les Trois-Ilets, Martinique, 23 June 1763 – Rueil-Malmaison, 29 May 1814) was the first wife of Napoléon Bonaparte, and thus the first Empress of the French.

Två barn i första äktenskapet; Eugène de Beauharnais (1781-1824) och Hortense de Beauharnais (1783-1837). Farmor till Josefina av Leuchtenberg, som genom sitt äktenskap med Oscar I blev drottning av Sverige.\n\nHennes far var plantageägare på Martinique och tillhörde en fransk släkt som utvandrat till Västindien i början på 1700-talet. 1779 gifte hon sig med Alexandre de Beauharnais. Äktenskapet var stundtals olyckligt och de levde separerade en tid, men återförenades. Alexandre de Beauharnais blev avrättad 1794 under franska revolutionen. Joséphine anklagades för att vara rojalist och fick tillbringa en tid i fängelse.\n\nEfter sitt frisläppande kom Joséphine att bli en av de ledande inom societeten i Paris. Napoleon blev redan vid deras första möte fullkomligt betagen av den vackra Joséphine, och de gifte sig 9 mars 1796. Under sin bortovaro, i krig i Italien och på fälttåg i Egypten, skrev Napoleon glödande kärleksbrev till henne. Joséphine kröntes till fransmännens kejsarinna 2 december 1804.\n\nÄktenskapet upplöstes 16 december 1809, eftersom Joséphine inte kunde föda den arvinge som Napoleon så hett önskade; hon hade blivit steril efter ett fall i en trappa. Hon fick behålla sin titel som kejsarinna och bosatte sig på slottet Malmaison utanför Paris. Vid Malmaison lät hon en berömd trädgårdsmästare, Dupont, anlägga en rosengård med rosor som hon genom sin ställning kunde skaffa sig från hela Europa. Vid Malmaison påbörjades ett rosförädlingarbete som blev av vikt, och några rossorter som ännu odlas kommer härifrån.\n\nÄven efter deras skilsmässa fortsatte Napoleon att träffa Joséphine då och då - det sägs att hon var hans livs stora kärlek.\n\nAv sina samtida beskrivs Joséphine som en livsälskande och godhjärtad kvinna, som aldrig tvekade att hjälpa de nödlidande i samhället, men även som fåfäng och slösaktig.\n\nJoséphine avled i sviterna efter en svår förkylning. Hon ådrog sig denna under en fest för den ryske tsaren Alexander I på Malmaison, när hon, fåfäng som hon var, inte ville neka honom åsynen av sina vackra skuldror och därför underlät att bära en sjal över axlarna när hon promenerade runt med den ryske tsaren i slottsparken.\n\nJoséphine de Beauharnais kamégarnityr [redigera]\n\nDet så kallade kamégarnityret består av diadem, halsband, örhängen, brosch och två armband. Garnityret är gjort i flera material som guld, pärlor, briljanter och stora kaméer. Det var en gåva från kejsar Napoleon till sin hustru Josephine omkring 1805.\n\nDet kom att ärvas av kejsarinnan Josephines sondotter, drottning Josefina, gift med Oscar I . När drottning Josefina dog 1876 testamenterade hon i sin tur hela kamégarnityret till sin enda dotter prinsessan Eugenie som gav dem i arv till brorsonen prins Eugen . Prinsessan Sibylla fick dem som bröllopsgåva 1932 av prins Eugen, när hon gifte sig med arvprins Gustaf Adolf . Idag är det drottning Silvia som bär smyckena som ingår i Bernadottestiftelsen.\n\nVid bröllop Diademet bars av drottning Silvia som brudkrona den 19 juni 1976. Det har även burits av prinsessan Birgitta och prinsessan Desirée vid deras respektive bröllop.\n\nFöreträdare:\n\nNy titel\n\n(med titeln drottning: Marie Antoinette)\n\nKejsarinna av Frankrike (ej regent)\n\n1804–1809 Efterträdare:\n\nMarie Louise av Österrike\n\nSidan ändrades senast den 24 maj 2010 kl. 01.19\n\nJoséphine de Beauharnais was the first wife of Napoleon I, and thus the first Empress of the French (commonly called Empress Joséphine or just Joséphine).\n\nHer marriage to Napoleon I was her second; her first husband Alexandre de Beauharnais was guillotined during the Reign of Terror, and she was imprisoned in the Carmes prison until five days after Alexandre's execution. Her two children by Alexandre became significant to royal lineage. Through her daughter, Hortense, she was the maternal grandmother of Napoléon III. Through her son, Eugène, she was the great-grandmother of later Swedish and Danish kings and queens. The reigning houses of Belgium, Norway and Luxembourg also descend from her. She did not bear Napoleon any children; as a result, he divorced her in 1810 to marry Marie Louise of Austria.\n\nJoséphine was the recipient of numerous love letters written by Napoleon, many of which still exist. Her Château de Malmaison was noted for its magnificent rose garden, which she supervised closely, owing to her passionate interest in roses, collected from all over the world.\n\nMarie Josèphe Rose Tascher de La Pagerie was born in Les Trois-Îlets, Martinique to a wealthy white Creole family that owned a sugarcane plantation, which is now a museum.[1] She was the eldest daughter of Joseph-Gaspard Tascher (1735–1790), knight, Seigneur de (lord of) la Pagerie, lieutenant of Troupes de Marine, and his wife, the former Rose-Claire des Vergers de Sannois (1736–1807), whose maternal grandfather, Anthony Brown, may have been Irish.\n\nThe family struggled financially after hurricanes destroyed their estate in 1766. Edmée (French, Desirée), Joséphine's paternal aunt, had been the mistress of François, Vicomte de Beauharnais, a French aristocrat. When François's health began to fail, Edmée arranged the advantageous marriage of her niece, Catherine-Désirée, to François's son Alexandre. This marriage would be highly beneficial for the Tascher family, because it would keep the Beauharnais money in their hands; however, 12-year-old Catherine died on 16 October 1777, before she could leave Martinique for France. In service to their aunt Edmée's goals, Catherine was replaced by her older sister, Joséphine.\n\nIn October 1779, Joséphine went to France with her father. She married Alexandre on 13 December 1779, in Noisy-le-Grand. They had two children: a son, Eugène de Beauharnais (1781–1824), and a daughter, Hortense de Beauharnais (1783–1837) (who later married Napoléon's brother Louis Bonaparte in 1802). Joséphine and Alexandre's marriage was not a happy one, leading to a court-ordered separation during which she and the children lived at Alexandre's expense in the Pentemont Abbey. On 2 March 1794, during the Reign of Terror, the Committee of Public Safety ordered the arrest of her husband. He was jailed in the Carmes prison in Paris. Considering Joséphine as too close to the counter-revolutionary financial circles, the Committee ordered her arrest on 18 April 1794. A warrant of arrest was issued against her on 2 Floréal, year II (April 21, 1794), and she was imprisoned in the Carmes prison until 10 Thermidor, year II (28 July 1794).\n\nHer husband was accused of having poorly defended Mainz in July 1793, and being considered an aristocratic \"suspect\", was sentenced to death and guillotined, with his cousin Augustin, on 23 July 1794, on the Place de la Révolution (today's Place de la Concorde) in Paris. Joséphine was freed five days later, thanks to the fall and execution of Robespierre, which ended the Reign of Terror. On 27 July 1794, Tallien arranged the liberation of Thérèse Cabarrus, and soon after that of Joséphine. In June 1795, a new law allowed her to recover the possessions of Alexandre.\n\nJoséphine de Beauharnais had affairs with several leading political figures, including Paul François Jean Nicolas Barras. In 1795, she met Napoléon Bonaparte, six years her junior, and became his mistress. In a letter to her in December, he wrote, \"I awake full of you. Your image and the memory of last night’s intoxicating pleasures has left no rest to my senses.\" In January 1796, Napoléon Bonaparte proposed to her and they married on 9 March. Until meeting Bonaparte, she was known as Rose, but Bonaparte preferred to call her Joséphine, the name she adopted from then on.\n\nThe marriage was not well received by Napoléon's family, who were shocked that he had married an older widow with two children. His mother and sisters were especially resentful of Joséphine as they felt clumsy and unsophisticated in her presence. Two days after the wedding, Bonaparte left to lead the French army in Italy. During their separation, he sent her many love letters. In February 1797, he wrote: “You to whom nature has given spirit, sweetness, and beauty, you who alone can move and rule my heart, you who know all too well the absolute empire you exercise over it!”\n\nJoséphine, left behind in Paris, began an affair in 1796 with a handsome Hussar lieutenant, Hippolyte Charles. Rumors of the affair reached Napoléon; he was infuriated, and his love for her changed entirely.\n\nIn 1798, Napoléon led a French army to Egypt. During this campaign, Napoléon started an affair of his own with Pauline Fourès, the wife of a junior officer, who became known as \"Napoléon's Cleopatra.\" The relationship between Joséphine and Napoléon was never the same after this. His letters became less loving. No subsequent lovers of Joséphine are recorded, but Napoléon had sexual affairs with several other women. In 1804, he said, \"Power is my mistress.\"\n\nIn December 1800, Joséphine was nearly killed in the Plot of the rue Saint-Nicaise, an attempt on Napoléon's life with a bomb planted in a parked cart. On December 24, she and Napoleon went to see a performance of Joseph Haydn's Creation at the Opéra, accompanied by several friends and family. The party travelled in two carriages. Joséphine was in the second, with her daughter, Hortense; her pregnant sister-in-law, Caroline Murat; and General Jean Rapp. Joséphine had delayed the party while getting a new silk shawl draped correctly, and Napoléon went ahead in the first carriage. The bomb exploded as her carriage was passing. The bomb killed several bystanders and one of the carriage horses, and blew out the carriage's windows; Hortense was struck in the hand by flying glass. There were no other injuries and the party proceeded to the Opéra.\n\nThe coronation ceremony, officiated by Pope Pius VII, took place at Notre Dame de Paris, on 2 December 1804. Following a pre-arranged protocol, Napoléon first crowned himself, then put the crown on Joséphine's head, proclaiming her empress.\n\nIn her role as empress, Napoleon had a court appointed to her and reinstated the offices which composed the household of the queen before the French revolution, with Adélaïde de La Rochefoucauld as Première dame d'honneur, Émilie de Beauharnais as Dame d'atour, and the wives of his own officials and generals, Jeanne Charlotte du Lucay, Madame de Rémusat, Elisabeth Baude de Talhouët, Lauriston, d'Arberg, Marie Antoinette Duchâtel, Sophie de Segur, Séran, Colbert, Savary and Aglaé Louise Auguié Ney, as Dame de Palais.\n\nShortly before their coronation, there was an incident at the Château de Saint-Cloud that nearly sundered the marriage between the two. Joséphine caught Napoléon in the bedroom of her lady-in-waiting, Élisabeth de Vaudey, and Napoléon threatened to divorce her as she had not produced an heir. Eventually, however, through the efforts of her daughter Hortense, the two were reconciled.\n\nWhen after a few years it became clear she could not have a child, Napoléon, while still loving Joséphine, began to think very seriously about the possibility of divorce. The final die was cast when Joséphine's grandson Napoléon Charles Bonaparte who had been declared Napoléon's heir, died of croup in 1807. Napoleon began to create lists of eligible princesses. At dinner on 30 November 1809, he let Joséphine know that—in the interest of France—he must find a wife who could produce an heir.\n\nJoséphine agreed to the divorce so the Emperor could remarry in the hope of having an heir. The divorce ceremony took place on 10 January 1810 and was a grand but solemn social occasion, and each read a statement of devotion to the other.\n\nOn March 11, Napoléon married Marie-Louise of Austria by proxy; the formal ceremony took place at the Louvre in April. Napoléon once remarked after marrying Marie-Louise that despite her quick infatuation with him \"he had married a womb\".[citation needed] Even after their separation, Napoleon insisted Joséphine retain the title of empress. \"It is my will that she retain the rank and title of empress, and especially that she never doubt my sentiments, and that she ever hold me as her best and dearest friend.\"\n\nAfter the divorce, Joséphine lived at the Château de Malmaison, near Paris. She remained on good terms with Napoléon, who once said that the only thing to come between them was her debts. (Joséphine remarked privately, \"The only thing that ever came between us was my debts; certainly not his manhood.\"—Andrew Roberts, Napoleon)\n\nIn March 1811 Marie Louise delivered a long-awaited heir, to whom Napoleon gave the title \"King of Rome\". Two years later Napoleon arranged for Joséphine to meet the young prince \"who had cost her so many tears\".\n\nJoséphine died in Rueil-Malmaison on 29 May 1814, soon after walking with Tsar Alexander in the gardens of Malmaison. She was buried in the nearby church of Saint Pierre-Saint Paul in Rueil. Her daughter Hortense is interred near her.\n\nNapoleon learned of her death via a French journal while in exile on Elba, and stayed locked in his room for two days, refusing to see anyone. He claimed to a friend, while in exile on Saint Helena, that \"I truly loved my Joséphine, but I did not respect her.\" Despite his numerous affairs, eventual divorce, and remarriage, the Emperor's last words on his death bed at St. Helena were: \"France, the Army, the Head of the Army, Joséphine.\"(\"France, l'armée, tête d'armée, Joséphine\").\n\nHenry H.

Eugène's son Maximilian de Beauharnais, 3rd Duke of Leuchtenberg married into the Russian Imperial family, was granted the style of Imperial Highness and founded the Russian line of the Beauharnais family, while Eugene's daughter Joséphine married King Oscar I of Sweden, the son of Napoléon's one-time fiancée, Désirée Clary.

Josephine took a personal interest in the gardens and the roses, and learned a great deal about botany and horticulture from her staff. Josephine wanted to collect all known roses so Napoleon ordered his warship commanders to search all seized vessels for plants to be forwarded to Malmaison. Pierre-Joseph Redouté was commissioned by her to paint the flowers from her gardens. Les Roses was published 1817–20 with 168 plates of roses; 75–80 of the roses grew at Malmaison. The English nurseryman Kennedy was a major supplier, despite England and France being at war, his shipments were allowed to cross blockades. Specifically, when Hume’s Blush Tea-Scented China was imported to England from China, the British and French Admiralties made arrangements in 1810 for specimens to cross naval blockades for Josephine’s garden. Sir Joseph Banks, Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, also sent her roses. The general assumption is that she had about 250 roses in her garden when she died in 1814. Unfortunately the roses were not catalogued during her tenure. There may have been only 197 rose varieties in existence in 1814, according to calculations by Jules Gravereaux of Roseraie de l’Haye. There were 12 species, about 40 centifolias, mosses and damasks, 20 Bengals, and about 100 gallicas. The botanist Claude Antoine Thory, who wrote the descriptions for Redouté’s paintings in Les Roses, noted that Josephine’s Bengal rose R. indica had black spots on it.[32] She produced the first written history of the cultivation of roses, and is believed to have hosted the first rose exhibition, in 1810.\n\nModern hybridization of roses through artificial, controlled pollination began with Josephine’s horticulturalist Andre Dupont. Prior to this, most new rose cultivars were spontaneous mutations or accidental, bee-induced hybrids, and appeared rarely. With controlled pollination, the appearance of new cultivars grew exponentially. Of the roughly 200 types of roses known to Josephine, Dupont had created 25 while in her employ. Subsequent French hybridizers created over 1000 new rose cultivars in the 30 years following Josephine's death. In 1910, less than 100 years after her death, there were about 8000 rose types in Gravereaux's garden. Bechtel also feels that the popularity of roses as garden plants was boosted by Josephine’s patronage. She was a popular ruler and fashionable people copied her.\n\nBrenner and Scanniello call her the \"Godmother of modern rosomaniacs\" and attribute her with our modern style of vernacular cultivar names as opposed to Latinized, pseudo-scientific cultivar names. For instance, R. alba incarnata became \"Cuisse de Nymphe Emue\" in her garden. After Josephine’s death in 1814 the house was vacant at times, the garden and house ransacked and vandalised, and the garden’s remains were destroyed in a battle in 1870. The rose 'Souvenir de la Malmaison' appeared in 1844, 30 years after her death, named in her honor by a Russian Grand Duke planting one of the first specimens in the Imperial Garden in St. Petersburg. {geni:marriage_order} 1 {geni:marriage_order} 2 Beauharnais, Joséphine de, née Marie Josephine Rose Tascher de la Pagerie (1763-1814), first wife of Napoleon Bonaparte, born in Martinique, West Indies. In 1779 she married the French army officer Alexandre, vicomte de Beauharnais (1760-94). Her husband was sympathetic to the Republican cause in France, but in 1793 he was forced to resign as general of the Army of the Rhine because he was a nobleman. During the Reign of Terror he was accused of counterrevolutionary activities, and in 1794 was guillotined. Two years later Joséphine married Napoleon, and in 1804, when he became emperor, she became empress of France. Napoleon divorced her in 1809. By her marriage to Beauharnais, Joséphine was the mother of Eugène de Beauharnais and of Hortense de Beauharnais (1783-1837), later the wife of Napoleon's brother, Louis Bonaparte, and the mother of Napoleon III.
