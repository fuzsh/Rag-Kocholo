        "text": "Much has been written about their love … Joséphine and Napoleon are one of the most famous love couples in history. Napoleon immediately fell in love with her. But who was she?\n\nYouth and first wedding\n\nJoséphine was born on 23 June 1763 as Marie-Josèphe-Rose Tascher de la Pagerie at Martinique. At home she was called Yeyette. Her marriage, at the age of sixteen, was arranged with Alexandre de Beauharnais and the couple settled in Paris. The marriage was unfortunate: they were too different and the ambitious Alexandre was often absent. From the marriage two children were born: Eugène (1781) and Hortense (1783). After a few years she left the house with her children. During the French Revolution, Alexandre was captured and was beheaded under the guillotine on July 23, 1794.\n\nMeeting Napoleon\n\nMarie-Rose was also imprisoned in November. She was released on 6 August after the fall of Robespierre. In prison she had made new friends who would have a major influence on her life: Madame Tallien but also Vicomte de Barras, who had become the most powerful man in Paris after July 1794. On 15 October 1795 Barras rewarded a young Napoleon for his help in a royalist uprising, 13 Vendémiaire. At a party, Barras introduced Napoleon to Marie-Rose.\n\nNapoleon was very impressed and fell madly in love with her. He wrote her fiery letters. He even broke his engagement with Désiree Clary. Following the advice of Barras, the couple married secretly on March 9, 1796. They didn’t get a church blessing. Both Joséphine and Napoleon lied to the official about their age: Joséphine “lost” five years and Napoleon added eighteen months “out of courtesy”. Napoleon left for Italy two days after the wedding.\n\nWhile Napoleon was fighting for France, including in Egypt, Joséphine maintained a relationship with Hippolyte Charles. On his return to Paris, Napoleon had to wait a month for her. For a long time Napoleon was still very much in love with Joséphine, but when he found out that she had several lovers, he did not stay loyal to her either. He also took many mistresses, including the Polish Maria Walewska.\n\nEmpress of France\n\nThe coronation ceremony, officiated by Pope Pius VII, took place at Notre Dame de Paris, on 2 December 1804. Following a pre-arranged protocol, Napoleon first crowned himself, then put the crown on Joséphine’s head, proclaiming her empress. The couple got married before church the night before.\n\nDivorce\n\nNapoleon and Joséphine did not have children and Napoleon thought for a long time that he would remain childless. But when in 1806 he had an illegitimate child with Éléonore Denuelle, Charles Léon, getting a legitimate heir became a goal. He decided to terminate the marriage with Joséphine. The Senate approved the actions of Napoleon, because it was in the interests of France. A month later, the French church declared the marriage closed in 1804 invalid because no witnesses had been present. Nothing stood in the way of Napoleon’s new marriage.\n\nEventually Napoleon married Marie Louise of Austria in 1810, daughter of the Austrian emperor Francis I. She became Empress of the French and in 1811 they had a son: Franz Carl Joseph (Napoleon II), king of Rome.\n\nDeath and Malmaison museum\n\nJoséphine did not experience the end of Napoleon’s era. She died on May 29, 1814 as a result of pneumonia in Malmaison, after a visit of Frederick William III of Prussia, Alexander I of Russia and some Russian grand dukes. Despite their mutual infidelity, they loved each other very much and they count as one of the most loving couples in history.\n\nMalmaison, her adored home, became a museum in 1906, where mainly articles relating to Napoleon and his wife Joséphine are exhibited. An absolute must if you are in the neighborhood of Paris.\n\nDo you want to know more about the life of Joséphine? Then I can absolutely recommend this trilogy from Sandra Gulland:\n\n1. The many lives & secret sorrows of Josephine B.\n\n2. Tales of passion, tales of woe\n\n3. The last great dance on earth\n\nThe book is written in the I-form and Joséphine takes you through her life as a true friend."
