        "text": "(1763–1814). As the wife of Napoleon Bonaparte, Josephine became empress of the French in 1804. A widow after her first husband was guillotined during the French Revolution, she reluctantly agreed to marry Bonaparte, at the time a little-known artillery officer.\n\nJosephine Tascher de la Pagerie was born on June 23, 1763, in Martinique, in the French West Indies. She went to France in 1779 after marrying a rich young army officer, Viscount Alexandre de Beauharnais. After he was killed, she was left to raise their two children. Her grace and charm attracted Bonaparte and in 1796, after he had been appointed commander of the Italian expedition, they married. When Napoleon was proclaimed emperor of the French at Notre Dame cathedral, Josephine was crowned empress.\n\nThe marriage was childless, and Napoleon wanted a son. In 1810 he arranged for the nullification of his marriage to Josephine on the grounds that a parish priest had not been present at the ceremony. Soon thereafter he married Archduchess Marie Louise of Austria. The French Senate awarded Josephine a large annuity, and she retired to the château at Malmaison, near Paris. Napoleon visited her there."
