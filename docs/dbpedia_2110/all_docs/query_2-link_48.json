        "text": "I watched an old Korean movie where the king of an area dared the overall emperor by creating his own astronomical equipment. He went ahead to create a clock based on how stars are arranged from his side and based on when sun’s light rises and sets in his locality. The result of this showed that his country has a different time zone which differs from the emperor’s time zone by 1hour. This was a great success for the country even at the face of great resistance from the emperor.\n\nHow was this a great feat for them since it’s a mere time difference? Well time isn’t just there for checking sake. It’s to guide the nature’s daily living. For example in agriculture, time predicts planting and harvest time. This country in particular had been having problem with some of their plantation because they either plant too early/too late or they harvest too early/too late. Plants survive basically on the light from the sun (photosynthesis). With the new invention, the country was able to solve their problem in that regard. This is a testament that the importance or research and it’s application cannot be over emphasized for a nation.\n\nHaving established the simple reason why difference in time zone is important, let’s come back home to Nigeria. We were taught by the colonial western world that every part of the country shares the same time zone. Which means we plan our events using the same time frame. But does Nigeria states and geopolitical zones really have the same time zone? Few weeks ago, I was on whatsapp video call with a friend who currently resides in Gombe (Northern Nigeria) while I was in Ibadan (Southwest Nigeria). While going home from rehearsals and around 7pm, I realized his end became dark even though he was calling from an open space outside a building, while my side (Ibadan) was still as bright as 10am of a normal day. I decided to repeat the call another day just to ascertain what I observed but this included another friend of ours residing in Abuja (Nigeria Federal Capital Territory dimmed as the country’s central point) and realised the result was the same. Only that the sunset in Abuja closely mirrors that of the Ibadan as the place was still considerably brighter when Gombe was already dark around 7pm in the evening. Need to say these calls and observation were carried out in July.\n\nDoes this mean parts of Nigeria work with different time zones of as far as 1hour? More technical research needed to be done in this regard to be very sure of the peculiarities of our natural and astronomical make up. If properly done and strategically applied, it’ll have a great impact on our Agricultural activities and basically our ways of live, for the good.\n\nBy the way, I need to say I am an Agricultural Engineer by degree and never a geographer and I never studied anything astronomical, so this observation might be from an angle of a layman in the subject matter.\n\nI Am Opeyemi B. POPOOLA. I am a content writer for both research base and fictional story write up."
