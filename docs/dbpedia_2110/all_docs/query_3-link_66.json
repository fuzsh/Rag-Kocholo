        "text": "We Will Ensure Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Building Collapse – Dangiwa * Reviews Recommendations of Building Collapse Committee with Regulatory Bodies * Charges the Commitee to develop a checklist of professionals involved in construction process to ease investigation Minister of Housing and Urban Development, Arc. Ahmed Musa Dangiwa, has stated that the ministry would ensure prosection of persons responsible for building collapse in the country. The Minister stated this during a review meeting of recommendations of the ministry's building collapse commitee along side regulatory bodies in the built environment. To ensure proper investigation and prosecution of the Culprits, the minister also charged the Ministry's Committee on building collapse to develop a checklist of professionals involved in the construction process in order to ease investigation and identifying the Culprits. Dangiwa told the committee \" You must come up with a checklist of things to observe during inspection or assessment of building collapse and there must be a column to aportion blame to who is culpable\" According to the Minister, the checklist must ensure quality assurance of the design, concrete quality, slumb and soil tests before the construction, who designed the building, who certified the designer, who approved the design and who supervised the construction so as to identify those culpable to stop the embarrassing tie of building collapse in the country. \"Once there is building collapse, we should immediately move there with our checklist, identify it and fill in. Once that is done, you can independently sit down and identify the culprit and support it with tangible evidence that this is the person that hasn't done the correct thing, either the design had not been done or the professional not certified or development control has not given approval or supervision was not done by a professional and it was converted to different use\". The checklist when developed would be presented to the National Council on Housing for all to understand and be carried along in the implementation. Dangiwa requested the regulatory bodies in the built environment to forward their submissions and inputs to the committee on building collapse set up by the ministry for consideration and inclusion in the checklist. Earlier the Committee on building collapse had presented Twelve recommendations for consideration among which are as follows; Reconstitution of the National Building Code Advisory Committee, Review of the Acts establishing ARCON; CORBON and TOPREC to make them more effective in curbing quackery; Implementation of punitive measures and sanctions for professional negligence, regulatory bodies to collaborate in event of collapse amongst others. Commenting on the Committee's recommendations, the Chairman of the Council of Registered Builders of Nigeria (CORBON), Bldr. Samson Ameh Opaluwah fnib, comended the Honourable Minister for this initiative and his laudable achievements within one year in office. \"Before, when there was an incident of building collapse, nothing was done to it but this initiative shows that the Federal Government and the Ministry are concerned and ready to tackle this issue to ensure safety and security of lives and properties. Many of the regulators advocated for the implementation of punitive measures on those found wanting to curb the menace of building collapse in the country. They called on the ministry to resuscitate the training schools for Artisans and Technicians to train more Artisans, Carpenters and Technicians to follow exactly the specifications in the drawings while doing their work to ensure a perfect job. The regulatory bodies present at the meeting were; The Council for the Regulation of Engineers in Nigeria (COREN) Council of Registered Builders of Nigeria (CORBON), Town Planners Registration Council (TOPREC), Architects Registration Council of Nigeria (ARCON) Nigerian Institution of Estate Surveyors and Valuers, NIESV, Nigerian Institute of Architects (NIA) and others. ...\n\nMinistry of Housing to Assist Nigerian Airforce Acquire Affordable Houses for Officers Minister of Housing and Urban Development, Arc.

Minister Of Housing And Urban Development, Arc. Ahmed Musa Dangiwa, At The Ground-Breaking For The 250-Housing Unit Renewed Hope Estate In Oyo State On Tuesday, July 9, 2024\n\nProtocols\n\nDistinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\nFirst, I would like to thank His Excellency, the Executive Governor of Oyo State, Oluwaseyi Abiodun Makinde for honoring our invitation to the groundbreaking for a 250-housing unit Renewed Hope Estate here in the State’s capital. This event was originally scheduled to hold last week but we had to move it forward owing to a presidential engagement. I thank His Excellency for understanding with us and regret all inconveniences that may have been caused by the change of schedule.\n\nToday’s ceremony is a continuation of the nationwide groundbreaking exercise for housing projects under the Renewed Hope Cities and Estates Programme of the Federal Ministry of Housing and Urban Development, which His Excellency, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, GCFR, launched in February with the groundbreaking of a 3,112-housing unit in Karsana, Abuja.\n\nUnder Phase One of this programme, we plan to deliver a total of 50,000 housing units across Nigeria. This includes 7 Renewed Hope Cities that will have between 500 and 1,000 housing units per site in each of the six geopolitical zones in the country and the FCT, while the Renewed Hope Estates will have 250 units per site in the remaining thirty (30) states.\n\nWith this housing programme, we plan to unlock the massive potential of housing development to create jobs, uplift lives, and boost economic development. This is in line with the Renewed Hope Agenda of Mr. President to STIMULATE INCLUSIVE GROWTH, LIFT 100 MILLION NIGERIANS OUT OF POVERTY, AND BUILD A $1 TRILLION ECONOMY.\n\nAs you may recall, last month, following the presidential launch of the programme in Abuja, we embarked on the first leg of this exercise with the groundbreaking of 1,500 housing units in the northern part of Nigeria. This includes 250-housing unit Renewed Hope Estates, one each in Katsina, Yobe, Gombe, and Sokoto, and a 500-housing unit Renewed Hope City in Kano. Work is currently ongoing at each of these sites, and our plan is to have all of them completed within the next couple of months and made available to Nigerians in line with Mr. President’s desire to provide quality housing for all Nigerians. UNDER THE RENEWED HOPE AGENDA, WE ARE IMPLEMENTING A ZERO TOLERANCE FOR UNCOMPLETED PROJECTS.\n\nToday’s event in Oyo completes the second leg of the exercise with groundbreaking for a total of 2,000 Renewed Hope Housing Units across eight (8) states in the South and North Central. We started two weeks ago on Wednesday July 26th with 250 units in Ebonyi. Same week Thursday we were in Abia for another 250 units, Friday we were in Akwa Ibom for another 250 units, and Saturday we were in Delta State for another 250 units.\n\nLast week Monday we were in Osun State to flag off 250 units. Friday we proceeded to Benue State to break ground for 250 units and Saturday we were in Nasarawa State to flag off another 250 units. Today’s groundbreaking in Oyo, marks the 8th under the second leg and the 13th location since the Presidential flag off in February with a total of 3,500 housing units.\n\nThis estate comprises 50 units of 1-bedroom semi-detached bungalows, 150 units of 2-bedroom semi-detached bungalows, and 50 units of 3-bedroom semi-detached bungalows.\n\nWe have designed these housing units in a way that makes them affordable for people to acquire by using organic designs to allow for future expansion as the income of beneficiaries increases. This means that a 1-bedroom unit can be expanded to 2 bedrooms, and a 2-bedroom unit can also be expanded to 3 bedrooms as the owner’s financial situation improves or their family grows.\n\nAs we perform this groundbreaking, I want to charge the contractors\n\n1. Messrs Skyhawk Nig. Ltd\n\n2. Messrs Plusvaz Nigeria Ltd\n\n3. Messrs Blue Sea Investment Ltd\n\n4. Messrs Harama Global Ltd\n\nto ensure that they build according to specifications. I want to emphasize in very strong terms that we will not tolerate substandard work from any developer, and we will explore all necessary legal means, to ensure that they deliver as per the contract. IF YOU COLLECT GOVERNMENT MONEY, YOU MUST DO THE WORK.\n\nWe also want the developers to adhere to the timeline and finish within three months so that we can begin the process of getting Oyo indigenes to purchase and move in.\n\nTo ensure affordability, we have created different options to enable everyone who has a source of income and livelihood to own these homes when they are completed. These include single-digit mortgage loans that beneficiaries can repay over 30 years, rent-to-own schemes provided by the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria, and outright purchase options for those who can afford to pay upfront.\n\nStatistics show that the construction of one housing unit creates an average of 25 direct and indirect jobs. So, for these 250 housing units in Oyo State, we hope to create jobs for over 6,500 people in various trades, from professionals like architects, civil engineers, and mechanical engineers to masons, plumbers, tilers, electricians, and laborers. We have seen unskilled workers at other project sites earning as much as N35,000 per week, at an average of N5,000 per day. This amounts to about N140,000 per month.\n\nThis is in addition to the economic activities, including those selling food, supplying blocks, and providing building materials. The value chain effect of construction work on this site is significant and creates a positive economic impact.\n\nI want to state that under the Renewed Hope Agenda of His Excellency, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, GCFR, we at the Federal Ministry of Housing and Urban Development are very particular about giving Nigerians value for money. We are diligently funding these projects from the N50 billion 2023 Supplementary Budget that Mr. President approved for the Ministry to ensure sustainability, quality, and geographic spread.\n\nIt is important to say that the provision of land in a good location and at no cost is a key condition for siting Renewed Hope Housing Projects. The twelve states covered under this 2023 supplementary budget are those that first provided land. I want to assure that states that have not been covered will be included in the Ministry’s 2024 Budget on a first-come, first-served basis, on the condition that they provide land at no cost to enhance affordability.\n\nAt this juncture, I want to appreciate and thank His Excellency, the Executive Governor of Oyo State, His Excellency Oluwaseyi Abiodun Makinde for promptly granting our request for the provision of land at no cost. This singular action has helped us to reduce as much as 30% of the cost of the units in this Estate for the benefit of potential homeowners. This is a dividend of responsible governance and I applaud Your Excellency for this.\n\nBefore I close my remarks, I want to thank and appreciate our President for providing the vision and the political will necessary for us to make a difference in terms of delivering decent and quality housing to Nigerians. The Groundbreaking ceremonies for these projects demonstrate that Mr. President and indeed the federal government of Nigeria is committed to fulfilling promises and responsibilities to all Nigerians.\n\nLong live Oyo State and His Excellency, the Executive Governor.\n\nLong live the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nLong live Mr. President."
