I was referred to them by a friend and I'm so glad I chose them to help me get to the top of Kilimanjaro! Amnaay was our guide and he did a great job along with the rest of the team. I will definitely visit them again for another trip.\n\nRyan S\n\nFrancis and Nyange are excellent. Our Safari adventure with Nyange was excellent. Our tour guide Francis was informative, friendly and always smiling. Thanks for the great trip!\n\nMarko N\n\nEpic adventure Great people, great service, amazing friendly crew! From safari to Kilimanjaro and farm celebration. Best choice for Tanzania 100%\n\nDavid C\n\nMount Kilimanjaro Machame Route with Nyange Adventures Had a fantastic experience with Nyange Adventures climbing Mount Kilimanjaro‚Äôs Machame route. Had a pre climb briefing to check equipment and to meet my guide Antipas. Hired sleeping bag to save bringing from the UK. Team of eight supported me on a solo climb. They were all fantastic. Had some good laughs. Had trouble eating the amount of food they try to feed you; three meals a day with three courses! Summited in six days rather than the intended seven due to feeling good and no altitude sickness. Whole experience was first class. Should have booked a Safari at the end of the climb.\n\nViktor W\n\nIncredible experience. Me and my girlfriend had a wonderful time at Serengheti and Nogorongo national park. Everyone so friendly. It really felt like we were visitors at the home that belongs to the animals. We started with a tour guide and came back with our friend John. Such a great experience. Strongly recommend!\n\nABC\n\nKilimanjaro hike review - Machame trail We hiked the Machame trail with Nyange Adventures and had a once in a lifetime experience. Our team was AMAZING and created a safe, supportive, and fun environment. Our guides Mo and Amnaay were the perfect pair to lead us to the summit. They were attentive, took care of us, had our safety in mind always, and truly made my experience a positive one in the setting of having personal health issues at the beginning. I would not have made it to the top without this team!!! Everyone that was a part of the team, including all the porters, worked so hard and joyfully to make our experience a positive one. The food also was great, and you will not be underfed if that‚Äôs one of your worries while hiking. Overall, we would recommend Nyange Adventures for anyone who is interested in hiking Kilimanjaro. They are also part of the KPAP group so you know porters and staff will be treated fairly.\n\nvittoria v\n\nMt Kilimanjaro Climb - 7 days Lemosho My husband and I had the most amazing experience climbing Kilimanjaro with Nyange Adevntures! It is difficult to choose who to do the climb with, due to the multitude of companies offering similar packages. Nonetheless Nyange adventures managed to differentiate themselves from the start, being very personable, flexible and happy to help! Their flexibility and quick problem-solving attitude turned out to be essential, when my flight to Kilimanjaro was cancelled, causing a 1 day delay to the trip. Above all, however, we recommend them for the amazing people that came on the climb with us - the guides, cook, and porters. One can‚Äôt describe the experience of climbing the mountain, because it‚Äôs incredible in different ways for different people. But the constant variable is that you need a solid team to help you on. An African proverb says ‚ÄúIf you want to go quick, go alone. If you want to go far, go together‚Äù. Nyange Adventure equipped us with a family to travel together with and we will always be grateful!\n\nGrandTour11938606806\n\nLifetime experience Nyange Adventures My friends and I had an amazing experience with Nyange Adventures. First we did the Marangu route in six days with the guide Musa, he and his team were wonderful with us. And then we went on a two-day safari, our guide was amazing and gave us an unforgettable adventure. Thank you to the entire Nyange Adventures team.\n\nDiana J\n\nAmazing Safari - lifetime memories Had an amazing adventure booked through Nyange Adventure Praise Nyange and staff totally live ‚Äúcome as a client and leave as a friend‚Äù Experience and knowledgeable they paid personal attention in planning our itinerary to ensure the most wonderful and memorable experiences\n\nJohannes v\n\nThis is what you want! We had an amazing time with our guide Roger(!) from Nyange Adventures, very experienced and it really felt we were able to take everything out of the trip. The food from our cook Deo(!) was delicious! I would definitely go with Nyange Adventures again a next time, no doubt."
