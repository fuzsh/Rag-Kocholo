        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nGombe State is one of the six states that form Nigeria's North-East geopolitical zone. It shares interstate boundaries with Yobe to the North, Bauchi to the West, Taraba to the South and Borno and Adamawa to the East. The state capital is Gombe.\n\nLANDMASS, LOCATION, AND POPULATION\n\nGombe State covers an area of 18,767 square kilometres. It lies at latitude 10°15’ North and longitude 11°10’ East. It has a population of 2,365,040 (2006 census) 3,256,962 (2016 forecast) and a population density of 126. The state accounts for 1.9 % of Nigeria's total population.\n\nHISTORY AND PEOPLE\n\nFounded in 1804 by Buba Yero, also known as Abubakar, Gombe was a composite of the emirate in Gombe North and the ethnic groups that resided in Gombe South. In 1824 the emirate headquarters was established at Gambe before being renamed Gombe Aba in 1841. The emirate enjoyed years of success and prosperity until wars and the encroachment of British rule precipitated its collapse in the early 20th Century.\n\nDuring this time the capital was moved to Doma which was then renamed Gombe. Gombe State was carved out of the old Bauchi State in October 1996 by the military government of General Sani Abacha.\n\nThough Hausa is the common language, there are 20 other languages in the state. This diversity is also represented in the number of ethnic groups in the state. The Hausa, Tangale, Terawa, Waja, Kumo, Fulani, Kanuri, Bolewa, Jukun, Pero/Shonge, Tula, Cham, Lunguda, Dadiya, Banbuka and others all have roots in Gombe.\n\nMAIN TOWNS AND CITIES\n\nGombe (capital), Kumo, Bajoga, Dukku, Pindinga, and Deba Habe.\n\nLOCAL GOVERNMENT AREAS\n\nADMINISTRATORS AND GOVERNORS\n\nGroup Captain Joseph Orji (Administrator - Military): Oct 1996 - Aug 1998\n\nMohammed Bawa (Administrator - Military): Aug 1998 - May 1999\n\nAbubakar Habu Hashidu (Governor – Civilian (All People’s Party): May 1999 May 2003\n\nMohammed Danjuma Goje (Governor - Civilian (People’s Democratic Party): May 2003 - May 2011\n\nIbrahim Hassan Dankwambo (Governor - Civilian (People’s Democratic Party): May 2011- May 2019.\n\nInuwa Yahaya (Governor – Civilian (All Progressives Congress): May 2019 - Present\n\nECONOMY AND EDUCATION\n\nAgriculture is the main occupation in the state.
