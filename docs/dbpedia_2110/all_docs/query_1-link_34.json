        "text": "Introduction\n\nMalaria is a major public health burden in Nigeria with over 90% of her 167 million people at constant risk. Nigeria accounts for 29% of the global malaria burden and together with the Democratic Republic of Congo contribute up to 40% of the global burden for malaria (1). Anopheles gambiae s.l. have been reported to be the most widespread mosquitoes responsible for malaria transmission in all the ecological zones (1). Controlling these vectors pose major challenges as the An. gambiae s.l. mosquito belongs to a complex with each playing different role in transmission and exhibiting varying insecticide susceptibility status across the several regions in Nigeria.\n\nIn Nigeria, vector control strategy remains one of the frontline and effective tools for controlling malaria and other insect-borne diseases. The strategy relies heavily on the use of insecticides from just four available classes of insecticides. In the face of increasing reports of insecticide resistance, sustained efficacy of these chemicals is desired. Resistance to at least one or more classes of insecticide have assumed a geographical scale in more than 50 countries (2). This is a major threat to pyre-throids which is the only class of insecticide approved for use in long lasting insecticide nets) (LLINs as compared to Indoor Residual Spray (IRS) which utilizes all the four classes (3). The delicate gains made in the global reductions of malaria deaths since 2010 due to increased funding and concerted efforts to attain control is threatened by emerging resistance to insecticides in Anopheles mosquitoes (2).\n\nInsecticide resistance data exist in Nigeria; however, most of these data are not consistently monitored for all communities in Nigeria. Despite an increase in the reporting of insecticide resistance in southern (4–9) and Northern Nigeria (10–11), only very little information on insecticide resistance exist for Gombe state. This suggests a major setback for vector control and weak existing capacity for monitoring insecticide resistance. Where these are available, they are not consistently generated to guide implementation of vector control. Similarly, there is also limited information on the insecticide susceptibility status of members of the major malaria vector species: An. gambiae s.l. to available classes of insecticides used in malaria vector control in the Southern Gombe State. This study therefore provides information meeting the demand of The Nigerian National Malaria Strategic plan to generate surveillance data that can be used to inform policy.\n\nThis study for the first time provides such information on the susceptibility status and identity of the major malaria vectors in southern Gombe to different available classes of insecticides used in vector control.\n\nDiscussion\n\nResistance of An. gambiae s.l. mosquitoes to all the four major classes of insecticides were observed in all the study communities in southern Gombe. This widespread observation of resistance in the major vector An. gambiae s.l. and factors responsible for this upsurge in these communities is not known and should be investigated. However, the absence of continuous monitoring data in these communities may have denied vector control managers the opportunity to have detected this trend earlier.\n\nResistance of An. gambiae s.l. to several classes of insecticides is not entirely new in Nigeria (4, 17). Permethrin, bendiocarb and DDT resistance were have been reported in An. coluzzii mosquitoes in Kano, Northern Nigeria (11). Summary of insecticide resistance cases and number of countries reporting this have constantly been on the rise (2). However, a consideration of factors (usage of ITN, IRS, agricultural pesticides) previously reported selecting for insecticide resistance (17, 18) provided a reasonable clue of what could be the driver of insecticide resistance in Southern Gombe.\n\nUtilization of insecticide nets by persons in Gombe is 34%, which is just below the national average of 37% (1). Gombe state ranked 8th out of the 38 states with the highest percentage of households with at least one ITN (1). There is a significant usage of Insecticide treated nets in Gombe state in Nigeria hence, these insecticide based tools may have contributed to the insecticide pressure in selecting for resistance in the Anopheles gambiae population. On the other hand, the use of IRS may not have added significantly to this present scale of insecticide resistance because coverage of IRS in all the states in the 6 geopolitical zones of Nigeria is just 2.5% (1). As such, there seem to be some other major contributors to the multiple insecticide pressure occasioned in these localities.\n\nA literature search for recent update on pesticide utilization in Gombe state yielded a positive result on what may have been the source of these insecticide pressures. WAAP (19) reported the widespread cultivation of horticultural crops on which considerable amount of pesticides of different classes are used in Gombe state. Hence, by inference, agricultural use of insecticides therefore may have contributed to the current modification of mosquito susceptibility to the pesticides in Southern Gombe. The status of pyrethroid resistance status of An. gambiae s.l. population in all the study sites is worrisome considering that the major malaria vector control tools in Nigeria rely on this class of insecticides (20). However, the disparities in mortality rates expressed by the Anopheles population to each of the pyrethroid insecticides indicate that rate of resistance development vary with different insecticides in each location and population. For example, while higher mortality rates (51.2–100%) to lamdacyhalothrin was observed in the Anopheles. populations at all the study sites, lower mortality rates were observed in populations exposed to permethrin (0–46.3%) and deltamethrin (39–70%).\n\nThis variation is an important indication of the need to introduce insecticide resistance management strategies to slow down the rate at which these mosquitoes develop resistance to the pyrethroids insecticides. This will invariably help in prolonging the shelf life of the few available classes of insecticides on which ITNs and IRS rely upon. Recent report from an agricultural setting in Jigawa state: another northern state in Nigeria showed multiple resistances to a pyrethroid, carbamate and an organochlorine (10). Similar evidences of full susceptibility to lambda-cyhalothrin as reported in Bambam study community have also been reported in Kenya (21), Sudan (22), Tanzania (23) and Nigeria (24). In observing the pattern of resistance in the vectors, full susceptibility to bendiocarb was observed in, Bambam and Pantami which are both neighbhouring communities.\n\nThis suggests the focal nature of the insecticide resistance status of Anopheles populations in each of these communities. While bendiocarb resistance was observed in Anopheles population in 6 out of the 8 communities, resistance to pirimiphos-methyl was observed in the An. gambiae populations from all the communities tested. Resistance to pirimiphos-methyl (an organophosphate) in Gombe is of great concern to vector control manager because it is not currently used in any of the current vector control tools. However, the widespread resistance in Anopheles population in 8 communities to pirimiphos-methyl (organ-ophosphate) and the co-resistance to bendiocarb (a carbamate with same target site with organophosphate) point towards other sources as these have not been used for vector control. In contrast, findings from Auyo, a community in Jigawa, Nigeria, Kouande and Tanguieta in Atacora communities, in Republic of Benin, the An. gambiae populations were susceptible to pirimiphos-methyl (10, 25). In this study, all the Anopheles populations were resistant to deltamethrin exposure in all the study communities. Similar findings of deltamethrin resistance have been reported in Benin, West Africa (26, 27).\n\nContrary to the findings of this study, in Khartoum city of Sudan, high susceptibility to deltamethrin was reported (22). In this study, similar lower mortality of Anopheles mosquitoes from all the study communities to permethrin have been reported severally in Nigeria: Oyo, Lagos, Niger and Bauchi states (4, 24). Similar evidence of resistance to permethrin have also been reported in Atacora, Benin (27). Evidence of DDT resistance was high in this present study and this was not surprising considering that both pyrethroids and DDT (organochlorine) share the same target site. High resistance to one class may have led to cross-resistance in the other class. Insignificant differences in the mortality rates from permethrin and DDT mortality in the Anopheles population also showed similar patterns of resistance.\n\nA molecular analysis would have provided additional information on probable existence of similar resistance mechanisms in the populations; however, logistics was a major limitation to this study. Several studies in Nigeria have reported high levels of permethrin-DDT resistance in An. gambiae and An. coluzzii in Nigeria (4, 6, 8 and 24). Evidence of resistance to pirimiphos-methyl (mortality rate between 65–95%) was observed in the An. gambiae populations in all the study communities. In comparing mortalities in An. gambiae populations exposed to two different classes of insecticides (organochlorine/ pyrethroids and bendiocarb/ organophosphate), showed there is significant differences in mortality rates of populations exposed to deltamethrin and lambda cyhalothrin (class II pyrethroids). Deltamethrin and lambda cyhalothrin are still effective compared with permethrin (a class I pyrethroids). Similarly, a comparison of differences in mortality rates between An. gambiae s.l. populations exposed to bendiocarb (carbamate) and Pirimiphos-methyl (organophosphate) in all the study sites were also not significant suggesting possible shared resistance mechanisms. This however requires laboratory validation.\n\nIdentification of the Anopheles species collected in this study showed the predominance of An. gambiae s.l. as the major malaria vectors in all the study communities. The An. gambiae complex includes sibling species that are the most important vectors of malaria in subsaharan Africa (28). Of these species An. gambiae (formerly S-form), An. coluzzii (formerly M-form) A. arabiensis and hybrid species (An. gambiae/ An. coluzzii) were found to be sympatric in all the study communities. In this study, An. gambiae (formerly S form) was the predominant species over An. arabiensis, An. coluzzii and the hybrid species identified. The sympatric occurrence of An. gambiae, An. coluzzii and An. arabiensis species have been reported in North–Central Nigeria (29).\n\nWhile this study reported, a higher proportion (19.8%) of An. gambiae/An. coluzzii hybrids than any previous report in Nigeria (6, 12, 30). Information on the role of these hybrids and their contribution to malaria transmission is currently unavailable. In this study, An. gambiae s.s (formerly S form) was found to be the most predominant species. In contrast, this species was either found to be entirely absent or in insignificant proportions where the hybrid occurred with predominant An. coluzzii (6, 10, 12, and 30). This raises questions on the fitness status of these hybrids compared to the disappearing An. gambiae when exposed to insecticides. The preponderance of An. gambiae (formerly S form) over An. coluzzii species has always been attributed to ecological preference for drier areas of the savannah regions or areas with temporary breeding habitats. The species composition outcome of this study is in agreement with previous nationwide mapping of the distribution of members of the An. gambiae complex in the Sudan savannah where the study communities are located (31, 32)."
