        "text": "Nigeria Travel Insurance – High Risk Voyager\n\nWhether you are an oil worker traveling to Nigeria to carry out business operations, a volunteer providing aid work or simply a tourist looking to explore the breath-taking natural beauty and wildlife Nigeria has to offer, there are a few things you should consider before travelling.

Attacks are often indiscriminate and can even affect western interests as well as occur in places visited by foreign tourists. There is also a significant risk of kidnapping, be it humanitarian or private sector workers, in many areas of Nigeria by the prominent terrorist organisations of Islamic State West Africa (ISWA) and Boko Haram in the north-east, as well as some northern and middle belt states. For senior executive oil workers working in the Niger Delta there is also a high risk of kidnapping, as was recently reported in May 2019 with the kidnapping of 2 Royal Dutch Shell workers on their way back from a business trip in Rivers State. So, you should not only ensure you have a travel insurance policy such as High Risk Voyager Travel Insurance that is designed for such locations, but if you are an employee of worker, you should also consider Kidnap & Ransom Insurance.\n\nTravellers should also remain vigilant even in tourist locations such as Lagos and the capital Abuja due to the high risk of violent crime.

Therefore, you will not be able to use your EHIC (European Health Insurance Card) or GHIC (Global Health Insurance Card) if you have one in case of a medical emergency whilst visiting Nigeria. Consequently, you will be required to pay all costs associated with any emergency medical treatment you may require if you do not have the correct travel insurance for Nigeria, which could become very expensive.\n\nAs of 11th June 2019, The FCDO as advised “against all travel” to Borno State, Yobe State, Adamawa State, Gombe State, the riverine areas of Delta, Bayelsa, Rivers, Akwa Ibom and Cross River States as well as within 20km of the border with Niger in Zamfara State. They also advise “against all but essential travel” to Bauchi State, Zamfara State, Kano State, Kaduna State, Jigawa State, Katsina State, Kogi State, within 20km of the border with Niger in Sokoto and Kebbi States, non-riverine areas of Delta, Bayelsa and Rivers State as well as Abia State.
