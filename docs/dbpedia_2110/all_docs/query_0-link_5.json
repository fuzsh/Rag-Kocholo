From a very young age, children are sent to Quran schools where they first learn to read Arabic and then memorize the Quran.

As a result of these efforts, several world class readers have emerged from the state including Hajara Ibrahim who won the International Female Quranic Recitation Competition in Jordan.[13]\n\nEconomy\n\n[edit]\n\nFarming is the main source of income for the inhabitants of Gombe State.

Livestock rearing is also common in the state.[14] Tudun Hatsi[15] is a notable market where grain business thrives in Gombe local government. The market generates huge revenue to the local government and the state in general.\n\nThe Gombe Urban Market, also known as (Babbar kasuwa) in Hausa, is located in the Herwagana ward of Gombe Local Government.[16] The state's geographical location and friendly economy make it a commercial area where entrepreneurs, even neighboring states, have their SMEs established. These SMEs have been the source of employment and income generation to many individuals[17]\n\nGombe town's unusual location in the heart of the North-East has made it a popular resting and gathering spot for travelers and traders from all over the geopolitical zone and beyond.[18]\n\nIn 2008 an agreement was reached \"to set up anti-venom manufacturing plant in Kaltungo General Hospital in Gombe,\" and provide medical training for snakebite patients.[19] The Gombe State government ordered an additional N4 million in anti-venom for the hospital in 2009, due to a local increase in snakebites.[20]\n\nSports\n\n[edit]\n\nGombe is also home to the new Pantami Stadium, a 12000-capacity sporting complex erected in 2010 by the then-Governor Danjuma Goje's administration to help the state's sports growth.[21] It replaced the earlier Abubakar Umar Memorial Stadium and is home to Gombe United F.C. and Gombe Bulls, the 2017 Nigerian Premier League runners-up (basketball).[22]\n\nBoko Haram\n\n[edit]\n\nGombe has been impacted by jihadist group Boko Haram's insurgency, having been attacked several times in the mid-2010s.[23]\n\nOn 22 December 2014, a suicide bombing at a bus station killed over 20 people.[24][25][26]\n\nOn 1 January 2015, a suicide bomber attacked a New Year's Eve service at a church, injuring several people.[27] On 14 January 2015, a suicide bomber killed two people and left 14 wounded at a Gombe mosque.[28]\n\nOn 2 February 2015, just minutes after a campaign rally by President Goodluck Johnathan, an attack by a female suicide bomber left one person dead and eighteen injured.[29] Two blasts had occurred in the city the previous day, leaving five people dead.[30] Local residents \"have set up checkpoints to defend Gombe\" according to the BBC.[29]\n\nBoko Haram attacked Gombe on 14 February 2015, as well as on 16 and 22 July 2015.\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\n[citation needed]Located at an elevation of 451.61 meters (1481.66 feet) above sea level, Gombe has a Tropical wet and dry or savanna climate (Classification: Aw).
