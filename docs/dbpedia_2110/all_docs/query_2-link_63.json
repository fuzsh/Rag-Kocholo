        "text": "It was a rainy evening and I was sitting in our house bored, I was wondering why it had to rain today of all days, the day I had planned to go out and show Ugo who the boss was. Ok let me quickly go back a bit, my name is Kachi. I had recently just graduated from University and am currently serving the country in the National Youths Service Corps (NYSC). I was deployed to Gombe state against both mine and my mothers wish and since I did not know anybody ‘up there’, I had to accept the posting as God’s will. I believed that He who sent me there will surely take care of me.\n\nI just came home to visit my mum and give her my first allowee before I return back to face the heat of serving one’s fatherland in Gombe state. I was still thinking about the lost opportunity of showing my best friend Ugo the new football skills I learnt from the camp when I heard a knock on the door.\n\nWho could that be? I thought, Mama said she might not return from the farm today, she looked up at the sky this morning before she left and told me if I did not see her before the clouds gathered then I should be rest assured that she would be sleeping on the farm tonight. So who was knocking at this time and under such a heavy storm. It might be Ugo, I thought .\n\nI went to open the door when I saw a strange face staring back at me, “Yes, who are you?, how can I help you?” I asked suddenly defensive.\n\n“Please my son, let me come in, this storm is seriously raging” He said.\n\nI stood for a moment and looked at him, he was obviously old enough to be my father and he did not look harmless but was he doing in this place under such a heavy rain. I thought about what mama would do if she saw me opening the door to a complete stranger but she taught us to be hospitable at the same time.\n\n“Come in” I said.\n\n“Thank you my son”, He said.\n\nAs he walked in, I noticed he was shivering and his clothes appeared torn. I was wondering what could have happened to him out there, feeling bad for him I put a pot of water on the stove so he could have a bath or even a cup of tea. He sat quietly at a corner of the house as if he was afraid to intrude.\n\n“What were you doing out there all alone in a storm like this?” I asked.\n\n“I was coming in from Lagos, on my way to my village in Nsukka to see my mum when my car broke down, it was minor at first and I thought I would be able to manage it, until it parked up finally and the rain started. I tried to find a mechanic but I could not and when it started getting dark, I had to start knocking doors to beg for shelter till the storm passes. No one answered, your door was the fifth door I knocked, makes me wonder what this country is turning into, no one cares about their neighbours anymore” He said.\n\n“Well I do not blame them, if my mum was around she would have probably done the same thing, however, you cannot blame them the rate of corruption in the country now is really high even in the rural areas. People would definitely be skeptical to open their doors to strangers especially under such a heavy rain. Which just points to the high level of unemployment in the country which leads the youths to crime” I said.\n\n“Hmm, you have spoken well my son, we have to look into bringing back the ethics of being your brothers keeper, if you had not opened the door for me, I would probably freeze to death out there, as you can see I am an old man. I see reason as you have said, they are probably scared, all this makes me miss the good old days where strangers are welcomed into a household like they are a long lost relative…hmmm” He said as he sighed obviously stressed.\n\nThe water on the stove had started boiling , “The pot of water is boiled, would you like to have a bath or just a cup of tea to keep you warm until the storm passes” I asked him.\n\n“I would like a cup of tea please and I would just like to sit by the fire so that my clothes would dry and I will be on my way as soon as the day breaks” He replied.\n\nThe only tea available was the pack of ‘Top Tea’ I had bought for mama on my way from Gombe. Mama has never been a tea drinker, she preferred her herbs, I was hoping to get her accustomed to tea drinking just like they do in the cities. She would not mind if I took a bag to make a cup of tea for the stranger.\n\nI went into her room and took a bag from the pack of tea, took a cup from the kitchen and made the tea for the stranger. “Here you go sir, this is the only tea we have at home now, I do not know if it’s something you would like but you can manage it, it will keep you warm” I said.\n\n“Thanks my son, it will be just fine” He said as he collected the cup and drank out of it. I could see the relief on his face as he took the first sip.\n\n“What is a bright young man like you doing here in the village?” He asked\n\n“I just graduated from the University, I am currently undergoing my NYSC program in Gombe State. It’s just my mum and I living here and I am her only child, she has gone to the farm and would not be back until morning. She has refused to stop farming, she sent me to school from the proceeds from her farming business. I hope to get a good job someday to repay her for all she has done for me” I replied with a smile on my face as I remembered Mama and all she had done to see that I got the best in life, she sold her wrappers, she farmed and took her produce to the next village to sell. She was sad when I got posted to Gombe state but there was nothing she could do, she prayed for me and promised me that she would keep praying. My only desire was to be done with NYSC, get a good job in Lagos and remove mama from this life of farming.\n\n“What did you study in the University my son?” He asked\n\n“I have a B.Sc in Accounting from the Imo State University, I am planning to enrol for ICAN as soon as I settle down in Gombe state” I replied\n\n“Accounting is a fine course, make sure you get chartered as soon as you can. An accountant who is not chartered is a scattered accountant who is not ready to go far. So do all you can to get chartered after which I am sure doors will open for you in major accounting firms in Nigeria” He said\n\n“Thank you sir, I will make sure I do that” I replied as I noticed that he was suddenly looking very tired, he was probably feeling sleepy. I should let him get some rest because he was going to have a big day ahead of him, he would have to get a mechanic or even look for a taxi to help him complete his journey the next day.\n\n“I would leave you now to get some rest, you can make yourself comfortable beside the fire, you can call me if you need anything, I will be in the room just by the corner.” I said\n\n“Its alright my son, you have done more than enough already, I will be fine” He replied.\n\n“Ok then, have a good night rest” I said\n\n“Thank you my son, see you in the morning” he replied.\n\nI went into my room to sleep but I did not close the door just incase he needed my attention, I would also try not to sleep too deep so that when he gets up I would hear. It was 6:30 when I heard movement in the sitting room, the rain had stopped but it was still drizzling a bit. It was really cold and I was sure that some of the roads would definitely be flooded. Mothers were already up getting the house ready for the day, I heard the men clearing their throats as they tried to brush their teeth. Even the birds were up early whistling all over the compound, they might have woken up happy as well, I thought. I got up from my bed and went to the sitting room…\n\n“Good morning sir, I hope you slept well?” I asked.\n\n“Good morning my son, yes I did, I hope I did not wake you up, I was trying to get signal on my phone that is why I was walking about” he said\n\n“No you didn’t, everyone in the village wakes up early. The signal is usually not so good in the house unless you go under the mango tree in the compound, however, with the passing of the storm, I am sure it would be worse even under the tree. Is there someone you are trying to reach?” I asked.\n\n“Yes my son, I am trying to reach my driver, I need to be able to direct him to this village so he would pick me up and we would continue our journey from there” He said.\n\n“Oh your driver! why didn’t you come along with him yesterday?” I asked.\n\n“I wanted to go alone to visit my mother, it has been a while I actually drove myself down, plus the driver was busy with my wife. Due to the unforeseen circumstances, I had to ask him to come down yesterday, it was getting late when I did and the storm probably added to the reason why he did not make it down yesterday but I need to know where he is now so I can meet up with him” He said\n\n“Ok then, let’s go under the tree, we might just get lucky, who knows” I said as I led him under the tree, he was even lucky to still have some battery left in his phone, we hardly had electricity in this village and at times when we did not have we took our phones to Emeka’s shop to charge at #50 per hour, with the rain, even Emeka would not be able to get fuel for his generator this early in the morning.\n\n“Do you have any signal?” I asked.\n\n“Not yet, I should probably turn to the back of the tree” He said.\n\nThe back of the tree? why the back of the tree? I thought. “Ok, lets do that then” We moved to the back of the tree and luckily for him, he was able to get signal for his phone, he contacted his driver and the driver was already in the village, he was parked at the village high school. I took him there and I could see that he was happy to be going home. He got into the car and took out a bundle of #1000 notes, by looking at it, I knew it was nothing less than a #50 thousand naira.\n\n“Take this my son for your upkeep” He said strecthing his hand to me.\n\n“No sir, I do not need your money. What services are you paying me for? I only accommodated you till the storm passed” I said.\n\n“I know my son, but you could have also left me outside and who knows I might not have been alive to tell this story today. Take it as an appreciation not as a payment for any services. You are a corper, remember” He said.\n\n“Ok sir, if you insist. Thank you very much sir, I really appreciate” I said,\n\n“You are welcome my son, I do not even know your name” He said.\n\n“My name is Onyekachi Adogu, you can just call me Kachi. What is your own name sir?” I asked.\n\n“Just call me ‘The Friend'”, he replied.\n\nThe friend?!, that was strange, I hoped this was not one of those men who used innocent boys for rituals, they would never tell you their names to keep their identities hidden and they gave out a lot of money freely. Well I am covered by the blood of Jesus and even if he had such plans in mind, I am covered.\n\n“Ok then the friend, thanks a lot and have a safe trip to your final destination” I said\n\n“Thank you Kachi, I hope I see you again someday soon” He said as the car drove away.\n\n2 years later, I am done with NYSC and searching for a job. Who knew that it was this hard to get a job in Nigeria. A graduate trekking the streets of Lagos looking for those ‘vacancy’ signs, the bad reception you receive when you walk into those big companies, some of them do not even allow you get past the front gate. All my dreams of taking care of mama was gradually being washed away. I always bought the Tuesday Punch newspaper to look for vacancies, I had recently applied to the Adekunle Phillips and Co. accounting firm when I saw their advert on the papers, they were looking for someone with at least 5 years working experience and I did not even have a day’s experience, I would be lucky if I ever got considered. I however did not stop praying everyday that I got a response from them, It was 2 weeks since I submitted my application.\n\nIt was almost 3 weeks later I finally got a response from them, they invited me for an aptitude test and interview. You cannot begin to imagine the joy I felt when I heard from them, I screamed when I saw the mail and everyone in the cyber cafe was looking at me like I had lost a screw. I took out the best suit I had and paired it with the best shirt in my wardrobe. I was not going to wear my trekking shoes today, I wore the pair I had been keeping for my first day at work in any firm I got employed into. I got to the Adekunle Phillips and Co. office as early as 8am, although the mail stated that it was for 10am, I did not want to take my chances, I would rather be early than late. I had already called mama and she had prayed for me with all her heart, she told me that God would go with me and I was bound to receive favour. With the confidence of that prayer, I went in for the interview.\n\nThe aptitude test started as soon as it was 10am, it was for 1hour 45minutes. We had to wait for 30minutes after the test to allow them mark it, then the top 5 would proceed to the interview stage. 30minutes later, they walked out and announced the names of the top 5, I almost collapsed when I heard my name called among them. I almost screamed “Thank you Jesus!”, I managed to get myself together and prepare for the next stage of the interview. Mama’s prayers were really working, I thought.\n\nIn another 15 minutes, we were ushered into another room where we were to sit and wait for the interviewers. We were called in one after the other and somehow I was the last person to be called in, as soon as it was my turn, I walked into the room and approached the table where the interviewers were seated. I had been taught not to sit down until I was asked to, the head interviewer had his head bent down and was reading something I suspected was my aptitude test results but I couldn’t help but notice that he was an elderly man, why was he the head interviewer? I asked myself, well maybe he owns the company. I stood waiting for him to acknowledge me and ask me to sit down, he rose his head up slowly and looked at me, “Good day, Mr Onyekachi Adogu”,\n\n“Good day sir” I said as I adjusted myself and looked into his eyes and in that moment I recognised him, it was like I was dreaming, he was “The Friend”…..\n\n——————————————————————–\n\nOk guys, what do you think? What are the morals of the story? Let’s talk about it….\n\nxoxo,\n\nTemitope…"
