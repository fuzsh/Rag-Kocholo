        "text": "I hereby welcome all Strategic Police Managers comprising Senior Police Officers of the rank of Commissioners of Police and above to this maiden conference following my appointment as the 22nd Indigenous Acting Inspector-General of Police by the President, Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, His Excellency, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, GCFR, on 19th June, 2023, and my subsequent assumption of office on the 21st of June, 2023 following the traditional handing/taking over ceremony at the Louis Edet House, Force Headquarters, Abuja.\n\n2. I am deeply honored to address this gathering of esteemed Senior Police Managers who represent the backbone of our nationâ€™s policing architecture. Together, we shall embark on a mission to uphold justice, fairness, protect human dignity, and restore standards and values of the Nigeria Police Force. Let me make one thing abundantly clear, the days of complacency and indifference are over. We are no longer mere enforcers of the law, we are the vanguards of justice. It is our duty to ensure that every citizen, regardless of his/her background, feels safe and secure at all times.\n\n3. Without mincing words, our nation faces an array of complex security challenges that demand our unwavering commitment and resolve. We stand at a critical juncture where the trust of the people in our institution hangs in the balance. It is our duty to reignite that trust, to be the beacon of hope in times of despair, and to foster an environment where safety and justice are not mere illusions, but the foundations upon which our nation thrives.\n\nRead More"
