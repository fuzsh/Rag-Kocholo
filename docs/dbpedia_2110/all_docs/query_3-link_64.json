        "text": "Gombe State governor, Inuwa Yahaya on Friday, toured some damaged facilities to assess the level of destruction witnessed during nationwide hunger protest in the state metropolis.\n\nMr Yahaya expressed concern over the damage of both public and private property, assuring the people of the government’s commitment to maintaining peace and stability in the state.\n\nHe said, “I have gone round to personally assess the extensive damage caused by the violent protest. From what I have seen, the destruction is enormous. Not just to public facilities, businesses were also affected.’’\n\nHe emphasized the importance of preserving peace in Gombe.\n\nThe governor stated, “Gombe is known for its peace, and we must preserve it. We cannot allow actions that threaten our stability. We have no state other than Gombe. We understand that there are challenges and hardships in the land, but we must not resort to violence and destruction of our state to express our feelings or concerns.\n\n“Let me make it clear: we are not against peaceful protest. We know that democracy and our laws grant the right to express oneself. But yesterday’s event contradicted democratic principles and violated the law.\n\nThe governor noted that his administration was ready to support any peaceful demonstration, and the police were ready to give protesters the maximum protection to exercise their constitutional rights once they followed the laid down rules.\n\nAccording to him, what his administration would not allow is the breakdown of law and order.\n\nThe governor urged residents to resume their economic and social activities, assuring them of safety and security.\n\nHe also commended the swift response and professionalism displayed by the security agencies in containing the situation.\n\n“We commend the security agencies for the efforts they put in tackling the escalation of the violence. Their prompt action played a crucial role in preventing further chaos and restoring order,” he said.\n\nLocations visited by the governor included the Gombe State Bureau of Public Service Reforms, the famous Bima Lodge and the Kumbiya-Kumbiya Primary Healthcare Centre.\n\nOthers were Blue Jay Motor Park– a commercial motor company where six Sienna vehicles were destroyed, and Gombe Main Market where he engaged with business owners, offering words of consolation for the losses incurred.\n\nThe governor also directed the ministry of works, transport and housing and the state Emergency Management Agency to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the damages with a view to providing support.\n\n(NAN)"
