        "text": "Barka ga ndako shafi bo pikka! [Welcome to the Bole Language Page!]\n\nBackground\n\nBOLE is a language spoken in Yobe and Gombe States of northeastern Nigeria. About 250-300,000 people speak BOLE, making it among the largest languages in the region, perhaps surpassed only by its linguistic cousin HAUSA, the dominant language of all northern Nigeria and the sub-Saharan language with the most native speakers, and KANURI, the historically dominant language of northeastern Nigeria over the past few centuries. BOLE is a member of the Chadic Language family. Along with Hausa, Bole is a member of the West Branch of Chadic, but Bole and Hausa are not particularly closely related. The languages share a number typological features (similar consonant inventories, a two-tone system with downdrift, grammatical gender–though this has nearly disappeared as an active system in Bole, and similarities in sentence and phrasal word order), but they probably do not share more than 30% cognates in basic vocabulary.\n\nThe BOLE PEOPLE have played a prominent role in the pre-colonial, colonial, and post-independence periods of Nigeria. The EMIR OF FIKA (MOI PIKKA), the paramount figure in the traditional Bole ruling hierarchy, has, for a long period, occupied one of the preeminent traditional royal positions of northern Nigeria. Many individuals from the Bole community have risen to prominent positions in Nigerian politics, commerce, education, and media.\n\nSource of the Name\n\nThe source of the name “BOLE” is uncertain. This is not the term the people use for themselves or their language. One suggestion is that the term comes from the Bole phrase, “Bo le?“, which in Bole could mean either “Why?” (literally, “Because-of what?”) or “What language?” (literally, “Mouth-of what?”)–the word bo can mean either ‘because’ or ‘mouth’ and le means ‘what?’. It is not uncommon for a people or their language to get their “mainstream” name from a phrase that recurs in the language and that non-speakers hear and apply as an ethnic name without having any idea what it means. For example, Kanakuru is the widely used name for a group in northeastern Nigeria who call themselves “Dera”. “Kanakuru” in Dera means, “Good morning”! The table below shows the name of the Bole people and their language in Bole as well as Hausa and Kanuri, the dominant regional languages. As the table shows, both Hausa and Kanuri base their terms on the mysterious “Bole” root.\n\nBOLE HAUSA KANURI People am Pikka (m), ani Pikka (f)\n\nanim Pikka = biya Pikka (pl)\n\n‘one(s) of Fika’ Babole (m), Baboliya (f)\n\nBolawa (pl) Bolea Language bo Pikka\n\n‘mouth/language [of] Fika’ Bolanci Bolea\n\nResearch on Bole\n\nThe intention of this web site is to draw attention to an interesting and important language of Nigeria which is probably unknown to most people other than specialists. Information on this site derives from three grants from the US National Science Foundation:\n\n“Bole Language: Grammar, Dictionary, and Texts” (08/01/1999-07/31/2001, #BCS9905180, Russell G. Schuh, Principal Investigator)\n\n“The Chadic Languages of Yobe State, Nigeria” (12/01/2001-11/30/2004 with no-cost extension to 11/30/2005, #BCS0111289, Russell G. Schuh, Principal Investigator, Alhaji Maina Gimba, In-Country Director)\n\n“Lexicon, Linguistic Structure, and Verbal Arts in Chadic Languages of Northeastern Nigeria” (08/15/2006-07/31/2009, #BCS0553222, Russell G. Schuh, Principal Investigator, Alhaji Maina Gimba, In-Country Director)\n\nDirectors of the project under the latter two grants are Russell G. Schuh, the Principal Investigator, and Alhaji Maina Gimba, the In-Country Director. Members of the Bole team are Malam Baba Ali and Madu Bah. Thanks go to HRH Moi Pikka, Alhaji Abali ibn Muhammadu, to members of the Fika Emirate Council, to the Fika Local Government Authority, to the Potiskum Local Government Authority, to the Fika Development Association (FIDA) for logistic, moral, and material support during summer 2000, and especially to Madu Liman and his family for indispensable logistic support.\n\nNote on the name “Bole”\n\nC.K. Meek (Tribal Studies in Northern Nigeria, Volume 2, page 288, Kegan Paul, 1931) suggests that the word Bole “would seem to embody a root bola = penis, or male, and the tribal name would thus, as so often in Africa, stand for ‘The Men'”. THIS IS COMPLETE NONSENSE, based on non-sequiturs such as noting that the Hausa word for ‘penis’ is “bura” (a word without known cognates in other Chadic languages) and that there is a northern Nigerian tribe called the Bura. One might just as well note the resemblance between Hausa “bura” and English “bear” in the sense of ‘give birth’! It is true that the autonyms for many African groups is “people” in the respective languages (though probably never “males” or “men”), but no African group identifies the word for “penis” with the word for “male, man”, much less “person” in general. The nonsensical nature of Meek’s suggestion is compounded by the fact “Bole” is NOT the autonym of the Bole people!\n\nLocation\n\nBOLE is spoken in southern Yobe State and northern Gombe State in northeastern Nigeria.\n\nMap credits: The map of Africa is adapted from a map available at http://www.miningco.com/.\n\nThe main BOLE speaking area lies between POTISKUM, the largest city of Yobe State, and GOMBE, the largest city and capital of Gombe State. The largest town in the actual Bole speaking area is FIKA, located in the northern part of the Bole area. Fika is the traditional capital of the Bole people. The autonym of the Boles is Biya Pikka ‘People of Fika’, they call their language Bo Pikka ‘Language of Fika’, and the paramount traditional Bole ruler is Moi Pikka ‘Emir of Fika’. Fika was the home of the court of Moi Pikka until 1924, when the colonial administration moved his court to POTISKUM, which is on the main east-west road. The court of Moi Pikka remains there, and in part because of this, a large Bole speaking population lives in Potiskum town. Potiskum is actually at the nexus of the Ngizim and Karekare areas, though as is the case in every major town of northern Nigeria, the lingua franca of Potiskum is Hausa.\n\nThe linguistic neighbors of Bole on the north, west, and south are all Chadic languages of varying degrees of relatedness. Directly to the north and northwest is NGAMO, a close linguistic “sister” to Bole. A bit further to the north, in the area around Potiskum, are KAREKARE, a sort of “half-sister” and NGIZIM, a more distant “second cousin”. The area directly to the west is now mainly HAUSA-speaking, though there are or have been several poorly studied and perhaps now extinct linguistic sisters of Bole in this general area, such as Deno, Kubi, and Kirfi. To the south, in Gombe State is TANGALE, another “half-sister” of Bole, and to the southeast is TERA, a “third or fourth cousin” from the Biu-Mandara branch of Chadic. The area directly east of Bole was probably at one time occupied by speakers of other Biu-Mandara languages, but KANURI, which is not a Chadic language, has long since replaced them.\n\nLinguistic Relatives\n\nBOLE is a member of the Chadic language family. The Chadic family, in turn, is a member of the Afroasiatic phylum, i.e. at a very deep historical level, probably dating back 8-10,000 years, Bole shares a common ancestry with Arabic, Ancient Egyptian, Somali, and other languages of north Africa and the Middle East. Within the Chadic family, Bole is a member of the West Chadic subfamily, “A” branch, the same branch to which Hausa belongs.\n\nPlace the cursor over the Afroasiatic tree to see the Chadic tree.\n\nClick to see the place of Bole within the West Chadic “A” branch.\n\nEvidence for the Family Grouping of Bole\n\nThe most obvious evidence for asserting that languages are related to each other (i.e. that they descend from what was once a single language) is resemblances in everyday words. Every language has words for things common in daily life, such as terms for body parts, universal environmental features (e.g. sun, moon, water, fire), small numbers, universal actions and events (e.g. eat, drink, die, know, go), and so on. Depending on where languages are spoken, there will also be words that all languages of that area would need. In the West African savannah, some universally known objects would be dog, goat, sheep, fish, crocodile, python, guinea fowl, elephant, buffalo, baobab, various acacia trees, and other plants and animals typical of the area.\n\nIf we find that languages share a substantial number of similar words for such concepts, the only reasonable conclusion is that those languages must have inherited the words from a single ancestral language from which they all descend. Shifts in pronunciation and meaning have taken place in different ways in different communities after they dispersed from the home of their original community.\n\nThe table below presents the type of evidence we can use to demonstrate language relatedness.\n\nBOLE and HAUSA show many resemblances: we group them both in the “A” branch of West Chadic under the assumption of a relatively recent common ancestor\n\nBOLE and NGIZIM (and HAUSA and NGIZIM) show resemblances, but fewer and less similar than Bole and Hausa: we place Ngizim in the “B” group of West Chadic under the assumption that we have to go back in time to the original West Chadic language to find the ancestor that was common to Ngizim and the West Chadic “A” languages Bole and Hausa\n\nBOLE and KANURI show few, if any resemblances: Kanuri is not a Chadic language–it does not have a common ancestor with the Chadic languages\n\nWords considered to “resemble” each other within a line are in red.\n\nNote: @ = a “barred i” (written as a “shwa” in the standard orthography; a letter with an apostrophe after it = a “glottalized” sound\n\nBOLE HAUSA NGIZIM KANURI two bolou biyu shirin indi three kunum uku kwan yask@ four pod’d’o hud’u f@d’u d@g@ five biyar bad’i vad’ uwu head kai koyi ad’a k@la eye ido ido da shim ear kunne kumo agud’ s@mo nose hanci unti t@n k@nza back baya boi akau ngawo name suna sun dlugun su sun rana poti afa k@ngal moon wata tere t@ra k@mbal oil mai mor m@rak k@ndag@ water ruwa amma am nji fish kifi kerwo v@nakau bunyi python mud’uwa mid’i kafa kuluji crocodile kada kadam karam karam baobab kuka kushi kuku kuwa Acacia nilotica gabaruwa jidimi guvaru k@ngar eat ci ti tau bu drink sha sa sau ya do yi i dlamu di return maya ma katau kalak go out fita pata v@ru lug die mutu motu m@tu nu pour zuba jubbu pau tab\n\nNotes on Kanuri\n\nThe Kanuri citations are from Norbert Cyffer, English-Kanuri Dictionary, Köln:Rüdiger Köppe Verlag, 1994. The words for crocodile and baobab resemble the Chadic words because they ARE originally Chadic words borrowed into Kanuri. We know this because many Chadic languages that have had no contact with Kanuri also have similar words for these concepts. The ancestors of the people in today’s Kanuri-speaking area of Nigeria originally spoke Chadic languages. As the Kanuri took dominion over this area, people began speaking Kanuri at the expense of their original languages, but they apparently retained their old names for many species of flora and fauna, and those words came into the mainstream of Kanuri. Note that Ngizim has reborrowed the original Chadic root back from Kanuri! There are no waterways in Ngizim country that would support crocodiles, so this was probably an “exotic” creature to the Ngizims, who had no native name for it.\n\nGreetings\n\nThe movie below lets you hear some typical Bole greeting exchanges.

The discussion here is based on six performances of the kona song by five different singers, all women in Potiskum and Fika, Nigeria.\n\nYagana Aba: Audio recording of a capella solo performance made by Alhaji Maina Gimba in Potiskum, early 1990’s.\n\nAlkama Anna: Audio recording of a capella solo performance made by Alhaji Maina Gimba in Potiskum, early 1990’s.\n\nUnidentified singer: Audio recording of a capella solo performance made by Alhaji Maina Gimba in Potiskum, early 1990’s.\n\nYagana Aba: Video recording of a capella solo performance made by Russell Schuh and Alhaji Maina Gimba in Potiskum, August 3, 2000\n\nHajja Adde: Video recording of a capella soloperformance made by Russell Schuh and Alhaji Maina Gimba in Potiskum, August 3, 2000\n\nZabiya Baba Data: Video and audio recording of performance with drums and dancing made by Russell Schuh and Alhaji Maina Gimba in Fika, August 22, 2000.\n\nSeveral of the versions of kona start with a verse something like, Na kona wonta did’o Tandu Adama ‘They say kona is movement of the neck, Tandu Adama’, suggesting the type of movement involved in the dance. The song is not always easy to interpret, but the main theme is adultry and dalliance, and the recurrent “protagonist” is Disa be Kawuwa ‘Disa son of Kawuwa’, who ends up being caught with another man’s wife (see verse 13 in the sample verses below). Here are some sample verses from the song as sung by Alkama Anna:\n\nListen to these verses by playing the movie “Kona (selected verses)”:\n\nkona_alkama.mov\n\nAs this sample shows, the kona song is divided into two-line verses. In all our recorded versions, women singing alone sing one verse right after the other. In the video with drum accompaniment, the solo singer sings a verse, then the chorus of women “answer”.\n\nAs in most African music, there is no rhyme, but there is a basic metrical or rhythmic pattern that the text of each line follows. Syllables in Bole are either “heavy” or “light”. Heavy syllables consist of C + long vowel or CVC, light syllables consist of C + short vowel (C = any consonant, V = any vowel). The most common rhythmic pattern for kona lines is as follows, using line 14a above as an example line. A doubled vowel here shows a long vowel, — = heavy syllable, v = light syllable. The last syllable in a line is rhythmically heavy, even if it is actually light.\n\n— v — v — — v —\n\nBaa-ba Dii-sa bee Kaa-wu-wa\n\nFor a more extended discussion of kona and metrics, click on the link below for a 22 page paper in PDF format. “The Metrics of a Bole Song Style, Kona” by Russell G. Schuh\n\nBole-English-Hausa Dictionary\n\nAlhaji Maina Gimba; Madu Bah; Malam Baba Ali\n\nThe Bole Dictionary\n\nIn 2004, the Yobe Languages Research Project produced the first Bole-English-Hausa Dictionary, published by Ajami Press, Potiskum, Nigeria. In addition to an introduction that includes background on the dictionary, explanations of dictionary layout, acknowlegdments, and abbreviations, there are three main sections: Bole-English-Hausa Dictionary, English-Bole Wordlist, and Hausa-Bole Wordlist. The Bole-English-Hausa section has about 3900 head entries (excluding pronunciation variants of the same words). The English-Bole and Hausa-Bole sections are really just indexes to the Bole-English-Hausa section, i.e. no attempt was made to compile comprehensive lists of English or Hausa words and seek Bole equivalents. Below are sample entries from each section. The full dictionary can be downloaded as a PDF file.\n\nBole-English-Hausa\n\nEnglish-Bole\n\nHausa-Bole\n\nPapers and Other Works on Bole\n\nThe references cited on this page contain information on the Bole language or contain data of interest for the study of the Bole language.
