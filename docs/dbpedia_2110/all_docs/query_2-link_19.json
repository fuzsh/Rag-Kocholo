        "text": "Wind Speed and Direction\n\nNE SW SE NW N S W E\n\nWind Direction:\n\nWind Speed:\n\nWind Direction and Speed are one of the most important aspects for choosing a fishing spot. An offshore wind can help land-based anglers with longer casting distances, while an onshore wind will make kayak fishing safer. Often fish will also move to certain feeding areas depending on the wind direction. Check out the long term wind forecast at the charts below.\n\nFishing Barometer\n\n1000 1010 990 980 970 960 1020 1030 1040 1050 1060 GOOD GREAT R A I N C H A N G E F A I R Fishing Barometer\n\nAtmospheric Pressure:\n\nChange since midnight:\n\nTrend for next 6 hours:\n\nAtmospheric or Barometric Pressure affects fish activity. The best fishing can be had on a rising barometer and also the time just before it is falling. A steady barometer in the higher ranges can also mean good fishing. A falling or low barometer reading without much change is usually not a very good time for fishing.\n\nUV Effect on Fishing\n\n6 5 4 3 2 1 7 8 9 10 11 12 d e e p e r w a t e r UV s h a l l o w w a t e r v e r y d e e p w a t e r\n\nUV Index:\n\nAs a rule of thumb, the higher the UV index, the deeper fish will move. Shallow water fishing is best done at times with a low UV index. When the UV is high, stick to early mornings, late evenings and shaded areas. The effect is less noticable in deeper water, but often a higher UV index can produce good results in the deep."
