        "text": "There appears to be no going back on the proposed #Endbadgovernance nationwide protest slated to commence on Thursday, an idea said to have been stoked by the prevalent hunger and hardship across the country.\n\nThe protest meant to register the displeasure of the Nigerian people against the policies of the government of President Bola Tinubu, is conceived to run for 10 days except there’s a major intervention along the way.\n\nCuriously, an initiative by a Lagos High Court, presided over by Justice Emmanuel Ogundare, which has restricted the movement and activities of the protesters to just two venues with definite timeframe, might have allayed the fears of those who were worried the protests could be hijacked and turn violent.\n\nThis development was said to have followed a request by some of the leaders of the planned protests for permission to peacefully assemble and also possible venues to hold their rallies.\n\nBut Vice-President Kashim Shettima has solicited the support of Nigerians for the actualisation of the programmes and policies of President Tinubu’s government, insisting that the president meant well for all Nigerians, and was neither anti-north nor anti-Islam.\n\nAt the same time, the Inspector General of Police, Kayode Egbetokun, on Tuesday, met with organisers of Take It Back Movement, and prominent human rights lawyers on how to fashion modalities for the protest, even as he cautioned against violence protest.\n\nSimilarly, the Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS) has declared that custodial facilities (prisons) across the nation was a red zone and that no protester should get to their perimeters.\n\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Abbas Tajudeen, while rallying support for the president, assured the Nigerian people that Tinubu was working round the clock to address their plights.\n\nInterestingly, and out of the fear of the unknown, the management of Silverbird Mall, an entertainment facility, has announced a “difficult decision” to temporarily close the mall, until further notice, ahead of the protests.\n\nAlso, more prominent Nigerians, including the Kogi State Governor , Mr. Usman Ododo; the Aare Musulumi of Yorubaland, Edo and Delta States, Alhaji Dawud Makanjuola Akinola; the Catholic Bishops of the Ibadan Ecclesiastical Province, the Anglican Primate, Most Rev. Henry Ndukuba; and an activist cleric, Bishop Wycliffe Khaemba, among several others, have pleaded with the protesters to shelve the idea and engage the government instead.\n\nHowever, in furtherance of their enmity, a former Petroleum Minister (State), Timipre Sylva, has described the alleged claims by the Bayelsa State Governor, Douye Diri, that he (Sylva) was supporting the protest as shocking, insensitive and divisive.\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigerian Police, on Tuesday, paraded a 34-year-old social media influencer, Suleiman Yakubu, resident in Jos North, for allegedly inciting violence through the social media.\n\nThe police, therefore, vowed to resist any form of violent protest in the country, while enumerating the severe negative effects that such demonstrations could have on the Nigerian society.\n\nIn the same breath, the Police Service Commission (PSC), has called on Nigerians to give peace a chance and support the federal government in its efforts to improve the living conditions of its citizenry.\n\nCourt Restricts Movements in Lagos\n\nGranting preemptive exparte application on the protest, Justice Ogundare, restricted protesters in Lagos to the Gani Fawehinmi Freedom Park in Ojota and the Peace Park, in Ketu area of the state.\n\nThe court gave the restriction order following the application filed by the Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Lagos, Mr Lawal Pedro, SAN, seeking to maintain and secure public safety and prevent irreparable loss of lives and property in the state during the period of the protests.\n\nListed in the application as co-defendants were Adamma Ukpabi and Tosin Harsogba (for Active Citizens Group); Comrade Juwon Sanyaolu and Hassan Soweto (for Take it Back Movement); Persons unknown and Commissioner of Police, Lagos State.\n\nWhile moving his application before the court, Pedro argued that as the Chief Law Officer of the state and having been privy to notices by different interests, who were for and against the nationwide protest, there was the need to protect the critical infrastructure of the state and prevent an irreparable loss of lives and property as witnessed during the EndSARS protest in 2020.\n\nHe stated that the police in the state did not have sufficient manpower to provide security support for the protesters, who planned to participate in the protest in all the local government councils and public highways and other areas of public access in the state.\n\nHe further argued that there was a need to prevent the protest from being hijacked by hoodlums, who were prepared to breach law and order and cause destruction in different locations in the state on the pretext of public protest against alleged bad governance.\n\n“In recognition of the citizens’ fundamental right to stage public protest against government policies and actions but prevent unlawful destruction of lives and properties in the process, the Lagos State Government has designated two public spaces and locations in the State where citizens can meet and converge to protest or express their displeasure against government. The locations are Gani Fawehinmi Freedom Park, Ojota, Lagos State and Peace Park, Ketu, Lagos State.\n\n“Public protest in all the local government councils and public highways as well as other areas of public access in the state for 10 days is a deliberate plan to shut down the state and if this is allowed it will amount to economic sabotage.\n\n“An order of court is required in the circumstances so as to protect the fundamental rights of 1st to 5th Defendants/Respondents to protest and other residents opposed to the protest to go about their lawful without harassment, disturbance and destruction of public buildings/properties.”\n\nAfter listening to his argument, Justice Ogundare granted all the reliefs sought in the application.\n\nHe held: “An Order of Pre-emptive Remedy by way of interim injunction is hereby granted restraining the 1st to 5th Defendants/Respondents whether by themselves, their agents, privies, servants or any other person(s) acting through them from converging and carrying out their proposed peaceful public protest, rallies, procession and meetings in Lagos State from the 1-10” August 1-10, 2024 excerpt in the approved designated location for peaceful public protest, rallies and meetings, to wit: Gani Fawehinmi Freedom Park, Ikorodu Road, Ojota, Lagos State and Peace Park Ketu Lagos from 8 .00 am to 6pm pending compliance with the pre-action protocol by the Claimant.\n\n“An order of pre-emptive remedy by way of interim preservative order is hereby granted directing the 6th Defendant to protect the fundamental rights of the 1st to 5th Defendants/Respondents to freedom of association, peaceful public protest, procession and tallies in the approved designated location for peaceful public protest, rallies and meetings in Lagos State, To wit: Gani Fawehinmi Freedom Park, Ikorodu Road Ojota, Lagos and Peace Park, Ketu Lagos from 8am to 6pm on August 1-10, 2024 pending compliance with the pre-action protocol by the Claimant.\n\n“An order of pre-emptive remedy by way of interim preservative order is hereby granted directing the 6th Defendant to provide security support and traffic management support to the 1st to 5th Defendants at the approved designated location for their proposed peaceful public protest, rallies and meetings in Lagos State, To wit: Gani Fawehinmi Freedom Park, Ikorodu Road, Ojota, Lagos State and Peace Park Ketu Lagos from 8am to 6pm on 1st -10% August, 2024 pending compliance with the pre-action protocol by the Claimant.\n\n“An Order of substituted service of the Order of this Court in this matter, the Memorandum of Claim/Letter of Claim and all other pre action protocols documents on the 1st- 5th Defendants/Respondents by Newspaper publication in a National daily to wit: any other widely read newspaper and the service shall be deemed as good and sufficient service on the Defendants/Respondents.”\n\nShettima: Tinubu’s Government Needs People’s Support to Actualise Policies, Programmes\n\nVice-President Kashim Shettima has solicited the support of Nigerians for the actualisation of the programmes and policies of President Bola Tinubu’s government, insisting that the president meant well for all Nigerians.\n\nAccording to him, contrary to speculations in some quarters, President Tinubu was neither anti-north nor anti-Islam, noting that he had reflected this in appointments to key positions in federal government Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs).\n\nShettima spoke on Tuesday when he hosted representatives of media practitioners from the northern part of the country on a courtesy visit at the State House, Abuja.\n\nCommenting on the planned nationwide protest, he acknowledged the right of citizens to protest, noting, however, that it has its own demerits that were not pleasant.\n\n“Today, if they say there will be a protest, it will amount to a lot of losses. Protest is the right of the people, but let it be known that historically, it has been hijacked by unscrupulous elements,” he warned.\n\nHe said current statistics of appointments into MDAs showed Tinubu’s choice of northerners for key areas such as agriculture, security, communications technology, health and allied services, among other positions in the Federal Government.\n\nShettima maintained that the present administration has genuine intentions to transform the lives of many in the North through laudable initiatives geared toward addressing the issues confronting the people.\n\nIGP Meets Organisers, Rights Lawyers\n\nThe Inspector General of Police Kayode Egbetokun, on Tuesday, met with organisers of Take It Back Movement, and some prominent human rights lawyers to fashion modality for the nationwide protest, while cautioning against violence protest.\n\nA statement by Force Spokesperson ACP Olumuyiwa Adejobi, noted that the meeting which held virtually, had in attendance prominent human rights lawyers, Femi Falana (SAN), Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa (SAN) and other key members of the Take It Back Movement.\n\nHe explained that the meeting was held at the instance of the planned nationwide protest, adding that the engagement was part of the Nigeria Police Force’s efforts aimed at ensuring the safety and security of all citizens while upholding the constitutional right to peaceful assembly.\n\nEgbetokun emphasised the importance of maintaining public order and safety during the planned protests, even as he acknowledged the group’s right to express their concerns through peaceful protests and reiterated the Police Force’s duty to facilitate such rights within the bounds of the law.\n\nThe IG further advised the Take It Back Movement, to engage with the respective State Police Commissioners to coordinate and plan the protests in a manner that ensures the safety of participants and the general public, while pre-empting any security challenges and ensuring that the protests proceed peacefully.\n\nHe also advised against unplanned open and unnecessary processions due to the potential dangers they pose, stressing that organising and coordinating with the police and other security agencies were essential steps to mitigate risks, protect the rights of all citizens, and protect the well-being of all involved.\n\nNcoS: Custodial Centres Are Red Zone\n\nThe Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS), has declared custodial facilities (prisons) across the nation red zones and that no protesters should get to their perimeters.\n\nIn a statement by its Public Relations Officer, Abubakar Umar said, “In view of the purported national protest scheduled to hold on the first day of August 2024, the Nigerian Correctional Service wishes to inform the public that the Custodial Centres have been designated as red zones. Therefore, any person or group of persons, who have no business whatsoever, should steer clear.\n\n“Furthermore, the Service wishes to enjoin the public that Custodial and Non-custodial Centres are critical national assets which are germane to public safety as well as national security. Tampering with or attacking them will lead to breakdown of law and order, and further exacerbate the security of the society in general.\n\n“The Service strongly advises all members of the public to join hands with the Service to ensure the protection of correctional facilities. Adequate security arrangements have been put in place to ensure that no correctional facility is defiled.\n\n“The Ministry of Interior Joint Taskforce (MOIJTF) has been activated to provide extra security in and around custodial facilities nationwide.”\n\nAbbas: Tinubu Working to Address Plights\n\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Abbas Tajudeen, has assured Nigerians that President Bola Tinubu was working round the clock to address the plight of Nigerians.\n\nIn a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Musa Krishi, Abbas said the present administration was not relenting in its efforts to bring succour to Nigerians.\n\nHe, therefore, appealed to the planners of the protests, especially the youths, to shelve their action in the interest of the country and its citizens.\n\n“I address you today with a heart full of empathy and a deep sense of duty. We are living through challenging times, and I want to acknowledge the difficulties that many of you, especially our youth, are facing.\n\n“The economic pressures, social uncertainties, and other related concerns weigh heavily on our nation. Your frustrations and reservations are not lost on us. We hear your cries for change, for a better and more equitable Nigeria.\n\n“I want to assure you that these concerns are taken with the utmost seriousness by the government of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, GCFR. We are committed to listening, engaging, and working with you to find sustainable solutions to the issues that confront us.”\n\nSilverbird Closes Mall Temporarily\n\nIn a statement, by the management, Silverbird, wrote: “Due to the ongoing hardship protest intended to begin on the 1st of August being Thursday, 2024, in the country, we have made this difficult decision to temporarily close the mall, until further notice.\n\n“The safety and wellbeing of our customers, tenants, and staff are our top priority, and we cannot guarantee a safe environment for business to continue as usual.\n\n“We apologise for the inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding during this challenging time.\n\n“We will keep you updated on any changes to our operations. We will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates. Thank you for your cooperation and understanding.”\n\nOdodo Appeals to Youths to Shun Protest\n\nKogi State Governor, Usman Ododo, has appealed to youths in the country to shun the proposed protest, describing those planning it as enemies of the country.\n\nAt the same time, the youths in the state have vowed not to participate in the protest.\n\nOdodo gave this admonition while speaking at the empowerment of 500 women and youths in poultry value-chain credit support programme at the Glass House, Government House in Lokoja.\n\nThe governor explained that President Tinubu’s administration inherited the current economic hardship and that the protest would bring about destruction of the nation’s economy.\n\n“As a State, we will continue to support President Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s laudable initiative in making Nigeria great. To those Nigerians who are bent on violent protests, let reasoning prevail. We are making progress. We are moving forward. Our hopes are back.”\n\nAare Musulumi Advocates Dialogue\n\nThe Aare Musulumi of Yorubaland, Edo and Delta States, Alhaji Dawud Makanjuola Akinola, has called on the organisers of #endbadgovernance protest to shelve the idea and engage in constructive discussions with the federal government.\n\nAkinola, in a statement in Ibadan, said doing this would guard against breakdown of law and order, cautioning that the protest could be hijacked by hoodlums, thereby defeating the purpose of the protest.\n\nAccording to him, the right to protest is guaranteed by the constitution of the country and in most democracies around the world, stating however that in a situation where the agitation could be hijacked by hoodlums which might eventually lead to violence and anarchy, there was the need to take caution.\n\nCatholic Bishops Warn Protest Can’t Solve Nigeria’s Problems\n\nThe Catholic Bishops of the Ibadan Ecclesiastical Province, have warned that protests could not solve problems in Nigeria, urging the protesters to shelve their plans if they could not demonstrate their actions without hindering lawful businesses and constituting a nuisance.\n\nThis was contained in a communiqué co-signed at the end of their meeting held in Akure by the Chairman and Secretary of the Province, Most Rev. Leke Abegunrin and Most Rev. John Oyejola and released by the Catholic Bishop of Ekiti diocese, Most Rev. Felix Ajaye.\n\nThe communiqué read in part: “Protests should cause no consternation in any normal democratic setting because the right to protest is guaranteed in true democracies all over the world. Protests are organised to draw the attention of governments and authorities to the opinions or demands of people or groups in society.\n\n“In Nigeria, the impending protest has raised a furor of opinions regarding its legitimacy and expediency. Many believe that protests are not a solution to Nigeria’s problems. They are right. Protests are not meant to provide solutions to problems.\n\n“Protests are held as a last resort for citizens who have cried out for solutions to problems and have not been heeded. Protests are the last resort for amplifying the voice of those who feel oppressed. The protests in Nigeria should be made to serve that purpose and none other.”\n\nEndSARS Horror Mustn’t Repeat Itself, Anglican Primate Begs Security\n\nThe Anglican Primate, Most Rev. Henry Ndukuba, has urged security agencies across the country to prevent a repeat of the EndSARS horror, which resulted in the death of many protesters.\n\nSpeaking at the Church of Nigeria Anglican Chancellors, Registrars, and Legal Officers Conference (ACRLOC) in Abuja, Archbishop Ndukuba expressed concern over the government’s failure to address issues such as infrastructure, public schools, and rural communities.\n\nThe prelate criticised the government’s handling of the economy, citing increasing hardship, starvation, and economic difficulties faced by Nigerians.\n\nHe also called for accountability and an intensified investigation into leaders, who were ‘evil and sacred cows,’ even as he commended the appointment of Olanipekun Olukoyede as the new EFCC chairman but urged the government to heed calls for accountability.\n\nBishop: Protests Didn’t End Well in Kenya\n\nAn activist cleric, Bishop Wycliffe Khaemba, has admonished the youth preparing to take to the streets on Thursday, to learn from the bitter outcomes of the widespread protests in Kenya.\n\n“I urge you to learn from what has happened and is still occurring in Kenya,” the bishop, who has been into activism for 28 years, said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nHe added “We allowed ourselves to be led into violent protests and disturbances, thinking they would lead to a desired outcome. Unfortunately, they have resulted in an undesirable outcome.”\n\nKhaemba, who pastors the One Ministry Methodist, advised Nigerian youths not to travel the same route because it would not end well for them and the nation.\n\nKano APC Youths Urge Nigerians to Embrace Dialogue, Shelve Planned Protest\n\nA coalition of APC Youth Movements in Kano State, has issued stern warning to the organisers of protests to shelve all forms of demonstration and embrace dialogue, in the interest of peace.\n\nChairman of the coalition, Adamu Unguwar Gini, issued the warning while addressing newsmen in Kano, on Tuesday.\n\nHe cautioned the youth against participating in the protest saying, “protests does not always yield desired outcomes but rather exacerbate challenges.\n\n“While we acknowledge the legitimate concerns and grievances of the youth, we strongly advise against participating in this protest.”\n\nReconsider, Shelve Protest in Nation’s Interest, YEN Appeals\n\nThe Young Entrepreneurs of Nigeria, has urged Nigerians to reconsider, and shelve the protest in the nation’s interest, warning that saboteurs were exploiting genuine concerns to further their evil interest by destabilising the economy, polity, national unity and national stability.\n\nChairman of the group, Mr Chris Kohol, while briefing journalists in Abuja, said, “This protest if held will definitely lead to chaos, economic sabotage, wanton destruction of lives and properties which is not in our best national interest for now.\n\n“President Bola Ahmed Tinubu is underway to reform our economy and tackle the economic challenges that confront us as nation. He is barely fourteen months (14) in office and in as much as we are keen of instant change in the course of things in the nation, especially our standard of living.\n\n“We also have to consider the long term benefits of the president’s economic reforms across many sectors of our economy. It is true that there is hunger in the land but do we throw the baby with the bath water? The answer is NO.”\n\nNorthern Group Suspends Participation in Nationwide Protest\n\nA group known as Northern Initiative for Growth, one of the organisers of the protest has announced suspension of all action on the plan.\n\nAddressing Journalists , Alkasim Nuhu Abdulkadir, National Coordinator, Northern Initiative for Growth declared that: “I stand before you today to address the Nigerian Youths and the nation at large on the recent developments regarding the planned nationwide protest.\n\n“After careful consideration and consultation with stakeholders and various organs of the Union, we have decided to suspend the protest in the interim. This decision was not taken lightly, but we believe it is in the best interest of our nation and its people.\n\n“We also appreciate the support of individuals and groups who have stood with us in this cause. Your commitment to a better Nigeria is inspiring, and we are grateful for your solidarity,” he added.\n\nSylva: Diri’s Allegations Shocking, Divisive\n\nA former Petroleum Minister (State), Timipre Sylva, has described claims by the Bayelsa State Governor, Douye Diri, that he (Sylva) was supporting the hardship protest as shocking, insensitive and divisive.\n\nSylva, a former Governor of Bayelsa, said Diri’s allegations, coming a day after he had issued a well-publicised statement urging youths in Bayelsa, Niger Delta and other parts of the country to shelve the planned protest, portrayed the Bayelsa governor as a man politicising a serious issue.\n\nSylva, in a statement personally signed and titled: “Our Governor Has Gone Mad Again”, said he shuddered in disbelief that the governor instead of joining hands with him to prevent the protest decided to seek political capital out of it by accusing him falsely.\n\n“I once read a play by Prof. Ola Rotimi of blessed memory titled: Our Husband Has Gone Mad Again. In the prevailing circumstances in Bayelsa State, I thought that play should have been about a governor, who goes mad from time to time.\n\n“Seeing statements credited to Gov. Douye Diri at his ‘security Council’ meeting, I shudder in disbelief. How could a governor, instead of joining hands with me in my efforts to prevent the protest, be accusing me falsely?\n\n“And let’s say the truth, if anyone were to protest against bad governance in Bayelsa State, it would not be against President Tinubu but against Governor Diri. In spite of that, I believe that protests are mostly counter productive. And I will never encourage them.”\n\nPolice Parade Yakubu for Inciting Violence on Social Media, Vow to Resist Violence\n\nThe Police have paraded a 34-year-old social media influencer, Suleiman Yakubu, resident in Jos North, Plateau State, for allegedly inciting violence ahead of the protest.\n\nThe Force Spokesperson, ACP Olumuyiwa Adejobi, who paraded the suspect in Jos, also told reporters that the suspect provocatively urged the public to attack petrol stations, security operatives, and destroy critical state and private infrastructures.\n\n“As you are all aware, a video recently went viral on TikTok, where an individual incited violence against state critical infrastructures, law enforcement agencies, and private individuals in Plateau State, in connection with the planned nationwide protest.\n\n“The video, originating from a TikTok account identified as “Dan_Mallam68,” showed the suspect provocatively urging the public to attack petrol stations, security operatives, and destroy critical state and private infrastructures.\n\n“Upon receiving this information, the Nigeria Police Force in Plateau State, with support from relevant stakeholders, traced the suspect’s location to Ahmadu Bello Way. On 28th July 2024, Suleiman Yakubu, a 34-year-old resident of Jos North, was successfully apprehended.\n\n“During interrogation, Mr. Yakubu confessed to being the individual in the viral video but has not been able to explain his motivation for such statements with severe criminal implications.
