He is also the founder of the Abdul Samad Africa Initiative, ASR Africa – an African focused Fund for Social Development and Renewal which seeks to support Nigeria and other African countries in the areas of Health, Education, and Social Development.\n\nBUSINESS\n\nUnder Abdul Samad’s astute leadership, BUA has grown steadily over the years to entrench itself as a leading player with holdings in cement, sugar, rice, flour and pasta, edible oils, logistics, agriculture, construction, port operations, and real estate. With a firmly established reputation for innovation, BUA Group is one of the largest contributors to Nigeria’s GDP and among its largest employers of labour.\n\nAfter finishing his degree in Economics from Capital University, USA, Abdul Samad returned to Nigeria from the United States and joined the family business, the IRS Group, until 1988 when he set up BUA Group to engage in importing and trading in major commodities like rice, edible oils, flour, pasta, and iron/steel rods.
