        "text": "Introduction\n\nBackground\n\nIn ancient and pre-colonial times, the area of present-day Nigeria was occupied by a great diversity of ethnic groups with different languages and traditions. These included Islamic empires in northern Nigeria and smaller organized political groupings in southern Nigeria. British influence and control over what would become Nigeria and Africa's most populous country grew through the 19th century. In 1914, the British amalgamated their separately administered northern and southern territories into modern-day Nigeria. A series of constitutions after World War II granted Nigeria greater autonomy. After independence in 1960, politics were marked by coups and mostly military rule, until the death of a military head of state in 1998 allowed for a political transition. In 1999, a new constitution was adopted and a peaceful transition to civilian government was completed. The government continues to face the daunting task of institutionalizing democracy and reforming a petroleum-based economy, whose revenues have been squandered through decades of corruption and mismanagement. In addition, Nigeria continues to experience longstanding ethnic and religious tensions. Although both the 2003 and 2007 presidential elections were marred by significant irregularities and violence, Nigeria is currently experiencing its longest period of civilian rule since independence. The general elections of 2007 marked the first civilian-to-civilian transfer of power in the country's history. National and state elections in 2011 and 2015 were generally regarded as credible. The 2015 election was also heralded for the fact that the then-umbrella opposition party, the All Progressives Congress, defeated the long-ruling People's Democratic Party that had governed since 1999, and assumed the presidency, marking the first peaceful transfer of power from one party to another. Presidential and legislative elections were held in early 2019 and deemed broadly free and fair despite voting irregularities, intimidation, and violence.\n\nTip\n\nVisit the Definitions and Notes page to view a description of each topic.\n\nDefinitions and Notes\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nWestern Africa, bordering the Gulf of Guinea, between Benin and Cameroon\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n10 00 N, 8 00 E\n\nMap references\n\nAfrica\n\nArea\n\ntotal: 923,768 sq km\n\nland: 910,768 sq km\n\nwater: 13,000 sq km\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 33\n\nArea - comparative\n\nabout six times the size of Georgia; slightly more than twice the size of California\n\nArea comparison map\n\nLand boundaries\n\ntotal: 4,477 km\n\nborder countries (4): Benin 809 km; Cameroon 1,975 km; Chad 85 km; Niger 1,608 km\n\nCoastline\n\n853 km\n\nMaritime claims\n\nterritorial sea: 12 nm\n\nexclusive economic zone: 200 nm\n\ncontinental shelf: 200-m depth or to the depth of exploitation\n\nClimate\n\nvaries; equatorial in south, tropical in center, arid in north\n\nTerrain\n\nsouthern lowlands merge into central hills and plateaus; mountains in southeast, plains in north\n\nElevation\n\nhighest point: Chappal Waddi 2,419 m\n\nlowest point: Atlantic Ocean 0 m\n\nmean elevation: 380 m\n\nNatural resources\n\nnatural gas, petroleum, tin, iron ore, coal, limestone, niobium, lead, zinc, arable land\n\nLand use\n\nagricultural land: 78% (2018 est.)\n\narable land: 37.3% (2018 est.)\n\npermanent crops: 7.4% (2018 est.)\n\npermanent pasture: 33.3% (2018 est.)\n\nforest: 9.5% (2018 est.)\n\nother: 12.5% (2018 est.)\n\nIrrigated land\n\n2,930 sq km (2012)\n\nMajor lakes (area sq km)\n\nfresh water lake(s): Lake Chad (endorheic lake shared with Niger, Chad, and Cameroon) - 10,360-25,900 sq km\n\nnote - area varies by season and year to year\n\nMajor rivers (by length in km)\n\nNiger river mouth (shared with Guinea [s], Mali, Benin, and Niger) - 4,200 km\n\nnote â [s] after country name indicates river source; [m] after country name indicates river mouth\n\nMajor watersheds (area sq km)\n\nAtlantic Ocean drainage: Niger (2,261,741 sq km)\n\nInternal (endorheic basin) drainage: Lake Chad (2,497,738 sq km)\n\nMajor aquifers\n\nLake Chad Basin, Lullemeden-Irhazer Aquifer System\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nlargest population of any African nation; significant population clusters are scattered throughout the country, with the highest density areas being in the south and southwest as shown in this population distribution map\n\nNatural hazards\n\nperiodic droughts; flooding\n\nGeography - note\n\nthe Niger River enters the country in the northwest and flows southward through tropical rain forests and swamps to its delta in the Gulf of Guinea\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPopulation\n\n225,082,083 (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 6\n\nNationality\n\nnoun: Nigerian(s)\n\nadjective: Nigerian\n\nEthnic groups\n\nHausa 30%, Yoruba 15.5%, Igbo (Ibo) 15.2%, Fulani 6%, Tiv 2.4%, Kanuri/Beriberi 2.4%, Ibibio 1.8%, Ijaw/Izon 1.8%, other 24.9% (2018 est.)\n\nnote: Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, is composed of more than 250 ethnic groups\n\nLanguages\n\nEnglish (official), Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo (Ibo), Fulani, over 500 additional indigenous languages\n\nReligions\n\nMuslim 53.5%, Roman Catholic 10.6%, other Christian 35.3%, other .6% (2018 est.)\n\nDemographic profile\n\nNigeriaâs population is projected to grow from more than 186 million people in 2016 to 392 million in 2050, becoming the worldâs fourth most populous country. Nigeriaâs sustained high population growth rate will continue for the foreseeable future because of population momentum and its high birth rate. Abuja has not successfully implemented family planning programs to reduce and space births because of a lack of political will, government financing, and the availability and affordability of services and products, as well as a cultural preference for large families. Increased educational attainment, especially among women, and improvements in health care are needed to encourage and to better enable parents to opt for smaller families.\n\nNigeria needs to harness the potential of its burgeoning youth population in order to boost economic development, reduce widespread poverty, and channel large numbers of unemployed youth into productive activities and away from ongoing religious and ethnic violence. While most movement of Nigerians is internal, significant emigration regionally and to the West provides an outlet for Nigerians looking for economic opportunities, seeking asylum, and increasingly pursuing higher education. Immigration largely of West Africans continues to be insufficient to offset emigration and the loss of highly skilled workers. Nigeria also is a major source, transit, and destination country for forced labor and sex trafficking.\n\nAge structure\n\n0-14 years: 41.7% (male 45,571,738/female 43,674,769)\n\n15-24 years: 20.27% (male 22,022,660/female 21,358,753)\n\n25-54 years: 30.6% (male 32,808,913/female 32,686,474)\n\n55-64 years: 4.13% (male 4,327,847/female 4,514,264)\n\n65 years and over: 3.3% (male 3,329,083/female 3,733,801) (2020 est.)\n\n2022 population pyramid\n\nDependency ratios\n\ntotal dependency ratio: 86\n\nyouth dependency ratio: 80.6\n\nelderly dependency ratio: 5.5\n\npotential support ratio: 18 (2021 est.)\n\nMedian age\n\ntotal: 18.6 years\n\nmale: 18.4 years\n\nfemale: 18.9 years (2020 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 207\n\nPopulation growth rate\n\n2.53% (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 22\n\nBirth rate\n\n34.19 births/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 18\n\nDeath rate\n\n8.7 deaths/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 70\n\nNet migration rate\n\n-0.21 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 113\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nlargest population of any African nation;

a large, ongoing outbreak of yellow fever in Nigeria began in September 2017; the outbreak is now spread throughout the country with the Nigerian Ministry of Health reporting cases of the disease in multiple states (Bauchi, Benue, Delta, Ebonyi, and Enugu); the CDC recommends travelers going to Nigeria should receive vaccination against yellow fever at least 10 days before travel and should take steps to prevent mosquito bites while there; those never vaccinated against yellow fever should avoid travel to Nigeria during the outbreak\n\nnote 2: widespread ongoing transmission of a respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is occurring throughout Nigeria; as of 9 December 2022, Nigeria has reported a total of 266,283 cases of COVID-19 or 129.17 cumulative cases of COVID-19 per 100,000 population with a total of 3,155 cumulative deaths or a rate of 1.53 cumulative death per 100,000 population;

Nigeria is currently considered a high risk to travelers for circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPV); vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) is a strain of the weakened poliovirus that was initially included in oral polio vaccine (OPV) and that has changed over time and behaves more like the wild or naturally occurring virus; this means it can be spread more easily to people who are unvaccinated against polio and who come in contact with the stool or respiratory secretions, such as from a sneeze, of an âinfectedâ person who received oral polio vaccine; the CDC recommends that before any international travel, anyone unvaccinated, incompletely vaccinated, or with an unknown polio vaccination status should complete the routine polio vaccine series; before travel to any high-risk destination, the CDC recommends that adults who previously completed the full, routine polio vaccine series receive a single, lifetime booster dose of polio vaccine\n\nObesity - adult prevalence rate\n\n8.9% (2016)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 145\n\nAlcohol consumption per capita\n\ntotal: 4.49 liters of pure alcohol (2019 est.)\n\nbeer: 0.73 liters of pure alcohol (2019 est.)\n\nwine: 0.09 liters of pure alcohol (2019 est.)\n\nspirits: 0.4 liters of pure alcohol (2019 est.)\n\nother alcohols: 3.27 liters of pure alcohol (2019 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 88\n\nTobacco use\n\ntotal: 3.7% (2020 est.)\n\nmale: 6.9% (2020 est.)\n\nfemale: 0.5% (2020 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 163\n\nChildren under the age of 5 years underweight\n\n18.4% (2019/20)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 27\n\nChild marriage\n\nwomen married by age 15: 15.7%\n\nwomen married by age 18: 43.4%\n\nmen married by age 18: 3.2% (2018 est.)\n\nEducation expenditures\n\n0.5% of GDP (2013)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 196\n\nLiteracy\n\ndefinition: age 15 and over can read and write\n\ntotal population: 62%\n\nmale: 71.3%\n\nfemale: 52.7% (2018)\n\nYouth unemployment rate (ages 15-24)\n\ntotal: 29.9%\n\nmale: 26.8% NA\n\nfemale: 33.5% (2019 est.)

Following the 2008-09 global financial crises, the banking sector was effectively recapitalized and regulation enhanced. Since then, Nigeriaâs economic growth has been driven by growth in agriculture, telecommunications, and services. Economic diversification and strong growth have not translated into a significant decline in poverty levels; over 62% of Nigeria's over 180 million people still live in extreme poverty.\n\nÂ\n\nDespite its strong fundamentals, oil-rich Nigeria has been hobbled by inadequate power supply, lack of infrastructure, delays in the passage of legislative reforms, an inefficient property registration system, restrictive trade policies, an inconsistent regulatory environment, a slow and ineffective judicial system, unreliable dispute resolution mechanisms, insecurity, and pervasive corruption. Regulatory constraints and security risks have limited new investment in oil and natural gas, and Nigeria's oil production had been contracting every year since 2012 until a slight rebound in 2017.\n\nÂ\n\nPresident BUHARI, elected in March 2015, has established a cabinet of economic ministers that includes several technocrats, and he has announced plans to increase transparency, diversify the economy away from oil, and improve fiscal management, but has taken a primarily protectionist approach that favors domestic producers at the expense of consumers. President BUHARI ran on an anti-corruption platform, and has made some headway in alleviating corruption, such as implementation of a Treasury Single Account that allows the government to better manage its resources and a more transparent government payroll and personnel system that eliminated duplicate and \"ghost workers.\" The government also is working to develop stronger public-private partnerships for roads, agriculture, and power.\n\nÂ\n\nNigeria entered recession in 2016 as a result of lower oil prices and production, exacerbated by militant attacks on oil and gas infrastructure in the Niger Delta region, coupled with detrimental economic policies, including foreign exchange restrictions. GDP growth turned positive in 2017 as oil prices recovered and output stabilized.\n\nReal GDP (purchasing power parity)\n\n$1,013,530,000,000 (2020 est.)\n\n$1,032,050,000,000 (2019 est.)\n\n$1,009,750,000,000 (2018 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 24\n\nReal GDP growth rate\n\n0.8% (2017 est.)\n\n-1.6% (2016 est.)\n\n2.7% (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 177\n\nReal GDP per capita\n\n$4,900 (2020 est.)\n\n$5,100 (2019 est.)\n\n$5,200 (2018 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 174\n\nGDP (official exchange rate)\n\n$475.062 billion (2019 est.)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices)\n\n11.3% (2019 est.)\n\n12.1% (2018 est.)\n\n16.5% (2017 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 210\n\nCredit ratings\n\nFitch rating: B (2020)\n\nMoody's rating: B2 (2017)\n\nStandard & Poors rating: B- (2020)\n\nnote: The year refers to the year in which the current credit rating was first obtained.\n\nGDP - composition, by sector of origin\n\nagriculture: 21.1% (2016 est.)\n\nindustry: 22.5% (2016 est.)\n\nservices: 56.4% (2017 est.)\n\nGDP - composition, by end use\n\nhousehold consumption: 80% (2017 est.)\n\ngovernment consumption: 5.8% (2017 est.)\n\ninvestment in fixed capital: 14.8% (2017 est.)\n\ninvestment in inventories: 0.7% (2017 est.)\n\nexports of goods and services: 11.9% (2017 est.)\n\nimports of goods and services: -13.2% (2017 est.)\n\nAgricultural products\n\ncassava, yams, maize, oil palm fruit, rice, vegetables, sorghum, groundnuts, fruit, sweet potatoes\n\nIndustries\n\ncrude oil, coal, tin, columbite; rubber products, wood; hides and skins, textiles, cement and other construction materials, food products, footwear, chemicals, fertilizer, printing, ceramics, steel\n\nIndustrial production growth rate\n\n2.2% (2017 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 126\n\nLabor force\n\n60.08 million (2017 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 10\n\nLabor force - by occupation\n\nagriculture: 70%\n\nindustry: 10%\n\nservices: 20% (1999 est.)\n\nUnemployment rate\n\n16.5% (2017 est.)\n\n13.9% (2016 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 181\n\nYouth unemployment rate (ages 15-24)\n\ntotal: 29.9%\n\nmale: 26.8% NA\n\nfemale: 33.5% (2019 est.)

note\n\nas of 2022, the Nigerian military was sub-Saharan Africaâs largest and regarded as one of its most capable forces; it was focused largely on internal security and faced a number of challenges that have stretched its resources, however; the Army was deployed in all 36 of the country's states; in the northeast, it was conducting counterinsurgency/counter-terrorist operations against the Boko Haram (BH) and Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham in West Africa (ISIS-WA) terrorist groups, where it has deployed as many as 70,000 troops at times and jihadist-related violence has killed an estimated 35-40,000 people, mostly civilians, since 2009 (as of 2022); in the northwest, it faced growing threats from criminal gangs, bandits, and violence associated with historical and ongoing farmer-herder conflicts, as well as BH and ISIS-WA terrorists; bandits in the northwest were estimated to number in the low 10,000s and violence there has killed more than 10,000 since the mid-2010s; the military also continued to protect the oil industry in the Niger Delta region against militants and criminal activity, although the levels of violence there have decreased in recent years; beginning in May 2021, a contingent of military troops and police were deployed to eastern Nigeria to quell renewed agitation for a state of Biafra (Biafra seceded from Nigeria in the late 1960s, sparking a civil war that caused more than 1 million deaths)\n\nas of 2022, the Navy was focused on security in the Gulf of Guinea; since 2016, it has developed a maritime strategy, boosted naval training and its naval presence in the Gulf, increased participation in regional maritime security efforts, and acquired a significant number of new naval platforms, including offshore and coastal patrol craft, fast attack boats, and air assets\n\nthe Nigerian military traces its origins to the Nigeria Regiment of the West African Frontier Force (WAFF), a multi-regiment force formed by the British colonial office in 1900 to garrison the West African colonies of Nigeria (Lagos and the protectorates of Northern and Southern Nigeria), Gold Coast, Sierra Leone, and Gambia; the WAFF served with distinction in both East and West Africa during World War I; in 1928, it received royal recognition and was re-named the Royal West African Frontier Force (RWAFF); the RWAFF went on to serve in World War II as part of the British 81st and 82nd (West African) divisions in the East Africa and Burma campaigns; in 1956, the Nigeria Regiment of the RWAFF was renamed the Nigerian Military Forces (NMF) and in 1958, the colonial government of Nigeria took over control of the NMF from the British War Office; the Nigerian Armed Forces were established following independence in 1960\n\nMaritime threats\n\nthe International Maritime Bureau reports the territorial and offshore waters in the Niger Delta and Gulf of Guinea remain a very high risk for piracy and armed robbery of ships; in 2021, there were 34 reported incidents of piracy and armed robbery at sea in the Gulf of Guinea region; although a significant decrease from the total number of 81 incidents in 2020, it included the one hijacking and three of five ships fired upon worldwide; while boarding and attempted boarding to steal valuables from ships and crews are the most common types of incidents, almost a third of all incidents involve a hijacking and/or kidnapping; in 2021, 57 crew members were kidnapped in seven separate incidents in the Gulf of Guinea, representing 100% of kidnappings worldwide; Nigerian pirates in particular are well armed and very aggressive, operating as far as 200 nm offshore; the Maritime Administration of the US Department of Transportation has issued a Maritime Advisory (2022-001 - Gulf of Guinea-Piracy/Armed Robbery/Kidnapping for Ransom) effective 4 January 2022, which states in part, \"Piracy, armed robbery, and kidnapping for ransom continue to serve as significant threats to US-flagged vessels transiting or operating in the Gulf of Guinea\"\n\nTerrorism\n\nTerrorist group(s)\n\nBoko Haram; Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham â West Africa; Jamaâatu Ansarul Muslimina Fi Biladis-Sudan (Ansaru)\n\nnote: details about the history, aims, leadership, organization, areas of operation, tactics, targets, weapons, size, and sources of support of the group(s) appear(s) in Appendix-T\n\nTransnational Issues\n\nDisputes -
