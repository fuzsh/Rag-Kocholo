Their civilization and culture both expanded until the Portuguese explorers reached the West African coast around the 1400s. This started the Atlantic slave trade where millions of Africans were taken to the Americas, and today, they are known as African Americans. In the early 1800s, there were many tribal wars to take control of the land. Britain took advantage and control with her powerful military force and English dominance was established.\n\nNigeria became known as the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria. The British banned slavery and took indirect control of power through chosen people and groups. These groups exploited the locals as they raised money for England to stay in power.

Until 1975 Murtala Ramat Mohammed took charge of Nigeria. He initiated the process of civilian rule and moved the federal capital to Abuja. In February 1976, he was assassinated and his top aide Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, a Yoruba Christian took over as the head of the government.\n\nNigeria became a republic and a democracy and in 2007, Umaru Yar'Adua, a Hausa Muslim was elected the next president. In May 2009, Goodluck Jonathan became the vice president. There have been many battles in the north of the country since 2002 between the government troops and the Islamic group called Boko Haram who follow the Sharia law.\n\nNigeria is the 32nd largest country in the world with borders shared with Benin, Niger, Chad, and Cameroon.

It comprises the largest area of African Mangroves.\n\nThe geographical features of Nigeria comprise of deserts, swamps, plains, mountains, and lush jungles. The tropical grasslands are spread over vast lands that consist of trees and shrubs. The southwestern plain is inhabited by the Yoruba people for thousands of years.\n\nThe 'Giant of Africa', as Nigeria is popularly known, comes from the vastness of the land, diversity of its people, languages, culture, oil, natural resources, and a huge population. The country lies on the southern coast of West Africa. There are arid savanna grasslands in the north and the rainforests in the coastal and southern regions. The physically diverse country with tropical vegetation and animal life in the rainforests offers plenty of tourist attractions.\n\nArt and Music\n\nNigerians are proud of their art and cultural heritage that has influences from the major ethnic groups.
