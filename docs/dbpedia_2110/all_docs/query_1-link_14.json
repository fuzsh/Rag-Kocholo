        "text": "In Eastern Africa, the longest and most severe drought in recent history is ravaging parts of Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia, and the situation is expected to worsen in 2023. Across the Horn of Africa, severe drought will affect at least 36.4 million people in the final months of 2022. Between October and December, at least 21 million people are projected to face high levels of acute food insecurity due to drought in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia, and two districts in Somalia are at risk of famine. More than 9.5 million livestock—which pastoralist families rely on for sustenance and livelihoods—have already died across the region, and many more are expected to perish in the months ahead. The drought is driving alarming levels of malnutrition for children and women, threatening their lives and futures. About 5 million children are acutely malnourished in drought-affected areas, including about 1.4 million children who are severely acutely malnourished, and an estimated 1.3 million pregnant and breastfeeding women are acutely malnourished. In drought-affected areas, many women have sacrificed their own well-being and nutrition to care for their families. About 23.75 million people across the Horn of Africa cannot access enough water for drinking, cooking, cleaning or improved sanitation and hygiene. The drought is also increasing the risk of disease: all three countries hardest hit by the drought are responding to cholera outbreaks, and measles is also on the rise. Families are taking desperate measures to survive, with more than 1.7 million people leaving their homes in search of food, pasture, water and alternative livelihoods, increasing the risk of intercommunal conflict, as well as heightening pressure on already limited basic services. The drought is having devastating consequences for women and children, heightening the risk of gender-based violence and sexual exploitation and abuse, and hampering children’s access to education.\n\nConflicts in Ethiopia, Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan, economic challenges, and other climate shocks impacting the region (including historic floods in South Sudan) continue to cause widespread food insecurity, large-scale displacement and major protection concerns. There are now 49.4 million people severely food insecure (including the 21 million impacted by drought in the Horn of Africa)—which is the highest level in recorded history, including in Sudan and South Sudan, which have the most people facing Crisis or worse food insecurity since the IPC classification began and more than 16.5 million people forcibly displaced across East Africa, including 11.5 million internally displaced people and 5 million refugees and asylum-seekers. The Horn of Africa remains a major route for mixed-migration movements to and from the Arabian Peninsula and to Europe. Grave violations against civilians continue to be committed in the region, including conflict-related sexual violence and recruitment of child soldiers.\n\nSouthern Africa remains at the forefront of the global climate crisis, while the conflict in Mozambique’s northern province of Cabo Delgado has continued to spread. During the 2021-2022 cyclone season in the South-West Indian Ocean, back-to-back tropical weather systems killed at least 890 people and affected more than 2.8 million people. About 1.58 million people were acutely food insecure due to drought in southern Angola, and 7 out of 10 districts in the Grand Sud of Madagascar remained in Crisis (IPC Phase 3), despite improvements that are largely due to the significant scale-up in humanitarian assistance in early 2022. In Cabo Delgado, conflict continues to drive rising needs: at least 945,000 people are internally displaced and 1.1 million are now severely food insecure. In recent months, attacks have shifted southward to districts previously not affected.\n\nCommunicable disease outbreaks are on the rise in Eastern and Southern Africa, and an Ebola outbreak in Uganda, which began in September 2022, threatens to spread to other countries. Measles and cholera outbreaks have been recorded in multiple countries across the region, and polio outbreaks are active in Malawi and Mozambique."
