        "text": "•10 killed in Niger, Borno, seven in Kano, others, FG complex looted, APC secretariat razed\n\n•OPS counts losses as banks, ports, offices shut, FG begs protesters, NBA offers free legal services\n\nNo fewer than 17 persons were feared killed in Abuja, Kano, Niger, Borno, Kaduna and Jigawa during the #Endbadgovernance protest which was held across the country on Thursday.\n\nOne person was shot dead in Abuja and Kano, two killed in Jigawa, six others were reportedly gunned down by security forces in Niger, while four died in Borno and three in Kaduna.\n\nThe rally began peacefully but took a violent turn in some cities leading to violent confrontations between the police and the protesters.\n\nBusinesses, banks, shopping plazas and some markets did not open for fear of the protests escalating into a crisis.\n\nIn Abuja, the demonstration claimed a victim, who was shot dead along the Kubwa expressway.\n\nAn eyewitness, who identified herself as Ekaete, said the man, whose identity could not be immediately confirmed, was gunned down after the protesters became violent and blocked the highway.\n\n‘’I was waiting for a bus on the expressway when the protesters in their numbers blocked the highway and harassed motorists. But as they became violent, the police fired live shots, killing the young man. Everybody took off on seeing the man fall,’’ she narrated.\n\nThe police also had another encounter with protesters at the Eagles Square, Three Arms Zone, located a few metres from the Presidential Villa.\n\nA group of protesters converged on the Eagles Square, chanting the old “Arise, O Compatriots” national anthem and demanding an end to bad governance in the country.\n\nIn response, the security operatives fired a couple of teargas canisters to discourage the protesters, who only shouted back in defiance.\n\nShortly after, the Minister of State for Youth Development, Ayodele Olawande, arrived at the scene and attempted to address the protesters, who shouted him down with chants of “hunger dey.”\n\nHowever, he called for calm, stating that he wasn’t attempting to shut down the protest but to encourage them to be civil.\n\n“I’m not here to fight you, I’m not here to ask you not to protest, it is your right. Like I said, I’ve been to over 100-500 protests,’’ Olawande stated.\n\nBut things quickly escalated upon the minister’s exit as the operatives fired more toxic gas and pepper spray, dislodging the protesters at about 10:30am after first firing warning non-lethal shots at the ground.\n\nCourageously, a female protester confronted the police officers, holding up her baby and daring them to shoot.\n\nShe told journalists that she showed up at the protest with her baby after bandits killed her husband in Katsina.\n\n“I came to protest the hardship in Nigeria and the police are shooting teargas at us. Do they also want to kill my baby? People cannot eat. Things are hard,” the protester, who did not disclose her name, said.\n\nThe policemen in a helicopter also fired teargas at a group of protesters occupying the city gate.\n\nSome protesters had earlier gathered at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium as early as 6am, in compliance with a court order earlier obtained by the FCT administration on Wednesday, restricting them to the stadium.\n\nThey, however, resisted the police directive to hold their rally inside the stadium.\n\nThey later moved to the Eagle Square, when they learnt some protesters were being harassed by security forces.\n\nBefore then, five bus-loads of pro-government protesters were brought to the stadium.\n\nThe placard-carrying youths said they were opposed to the hunger protest.\n\nOne of them admitted that they were promised N5,000 each to stage a counter-protest.\n\n“They (organisers) picked us up and said they would give us N5,000 to protest against these people. I have collected N2,000 and I am waiting for my balance. I am hungry but the money given to him would not solve my problem,” he said.\n\nThe Director of Mobilisation, Take It Back Movement, Damilare Adenola, said the protest would continue until President Bola Tinubu acceded to their demands.\n\nThe protesters are demanding the reversal of petrol pump price to N100/litre, an end to insecurity, the closing of IDP camps and electoral reform, among other things.\n\nAdenola said, “The various orders of court restricting protesters to particular locations are an aberration. Our presence here today is an announcement that we have been oppressed for too long. Today, we have risen.\n\n“We are saying that unless President Bola Tinubu acceded to our demands, we will remain on the streets. We want to see the President on the streets. During the protest, he was on the streets.”\n\nOne of the organisers of the protest, Michael Lenin, said it would continue on Friday (today) regardless of the intimidation by the security agencies.\n\nHe said, “The protest will continue. We are not intimidated by what the security agencies do. This government does not appear like one ready to listen to the citizens with the way protesters were attacked today. We are resolute; until he meets our demands, we will remain on the streets.“\n\nElsewhere in Abuja, protesters, including women and young children, blocked the main road linking Karu-Kurudu and Karshi, chanting “Bamayi Tinubu”, meaning “We don’t want Tinubu.”\n\nSome protesters were seen holding cudgels, while a few others held leaves as they turned back vehicles and blocked all movements.\n\nTwo persons were reportedly hit by stray bullets at the popular sharp corner in Mararaba, Karu Local Government Area in Nasarawa State, a suburban border town to Abuja where most civil servants working in the FCT live.\n\nSounds of gunshots were heard as the protesters occupied the Abuja-Keffi highway and setting up bonfires.\n\nAs the tension and confrontation between the security agencies and protesters increased, the FCT Minister, Nyesom Wike, called for dialogue, saying the government was willing to discuss with the youths.\n\nWike, who was later spotted at the Presidential Villa, appealed to protesters in the nation’s capital to “sit down” with the government and pursue dialogue, describing it as a better peace process.\n\nWike said this in his address during the presentation of the Staff of the Office to four newly graded chiefs in Abuja.\n\nHe said, “We have seen severally that it is better to dialogue; it is better to sit down and iron out issues with the government. I want you to continue with that peace process, and he who makes peace, will at the end of the day, enjoy the dividend of peace.”\n\n“I want to commend you and still talk to our people, appeal to them that we are still ready to sit with them and dialogue with them, and iron out the grey areas.”\n\nIn Niger State, about six people were reportedly killed by the police while 11 persons were arrested for allegedly attempting to set ablaze Tafa LGA secretariat during the protest.\n\nThe command’s spokesperson, SP Waisu Abiodun, disclosed in Minna on Thursday that some hoodlums partially burnt part of the secretariat and looted valuable items.\n\nAbiodun was silent on the number of persons killed during the incident.\n\nHe explained that at about 9:30 am, some miscreants from Tafa area of Kagarko LGA of Kaduna State and Hayin-Diko of Gurara Council Area of Niger stormed the secretariat located in Sabon-Wuse along Abuja-Kaduna expressway.\n\nAbiodun said the hoodlums vandalised and partially set ablaze the secretariat, burnt two vehicles as well as vandalised two others.\n\nHe said the hoodlums went further to loot valuables inside offices in the secretariat, adding that in the process, police and other security agencies responded to the scene.\n\nThe spokesman further disclosed that the 11 suspects were nabbed with different dangerous weapons, including firearms while others were dispersed from the scene and some of the looted items were recovered.\n\nHe added that the police and other security agencies responded to the blockage of the Kaduna-Abuja expressway and the old toll-gate to disperse the hoodlums who blocked it.\n\n“Anyone caught engaging in violent demonstrations and any act of lawlessness would be dealt with decisively in accordance with the law,” he cautioned.\n\nThe Civil Society Situation Room said two protesters were shot dead by security agents at the Kaduna State Government House, and six in Niger.\n\nThe group’s Head of Coordinating Secretariat, Olawale Okunniyi, in a statement on Thursday, revealed that several other protesters were injured.\n\nHe said, “Report reaching the Civil Society Situation Room, monitoring incidents and ethical compliance with civil protests during the nationwide citizens’ mass protests on hunger and hardships in Nigeria from Kaduna, have it on good authority that two protesters have been shot dead by security agents at the Kaduna State Government House, Badikko.\n\n“Again, at least six protesters have also been reportedly killed while some sustained injuries in the ongoing protest in Suleja, Niger State.\n\n“The victims were said to have been killed while security operatives were struggling to dislodge a group of protesters who mounted barricade on a section of Abuja-Kaduna highway.”\n\nFour people have been reportedly killed after suspected Boko Haram members infiltrated a protest over the rising cost of living in Borno State.\n\nThirty-four others sustained injuries in the incident.\n\nIn a statement on Thursday, Farouq Lawal, commissioner of police in Borno, said the commander of the explosive ordnance device Base 13, was “swiftly” deployed to the scene.\n\n“Boko Haram militants infiltrated a protest, killing four individuals and injuring 34 others,” Lawal said.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of violence in Kano, which resulted in the death of one Ismael Musa, Governor Abba Yusuf, slammed a 24-hour curfew on the city, as he blamed the riot on ‘’enemies of progress.”\n\nThere were also curfews imposed on some LGAs in Yobe and Nasarawa states on Thursday.\n\n“These disgruntled elements also looted property of innocent people as well as killed innocent people. By the power conferred on me as the chief security of the state, I declare a 24-hour curfew in the state,” he announced.\n\nHe directed the security operatives to ensure the effective enforcement of his order.\n\nThe governor said he received demands from the organisers of the peaceful protest which he promised to send to the president.\n\nMusa was killed in Hotoro, Tarauni Local Government Area of the state.\n\nThe victim, a resident of Hotoro Danmarke, was confirmed dead by his brother, Mubarak, on Thursday.\n\nIt is unclear if he was among the protesters who trooped to the streets.\n\nHe has since been buried according to Islamic rites.\n\nAnother victim who was reportedly hit by a stray bullet was rushed to the Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital for treatment.\n\nThe protest took a violent turn in the ancient city around 11.30am when suspected hoodlums broke into a food store located at Sarari Quarters, Dala LGA where they looted rice, flour, spaghetti and assorted food items.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria also reported that the Nigeria Communications Commission office in Kano was torched by hoodlums.\n\nThe newly constructed office was scheduled for inauguration next week.\n\nA large number of youths, who were armed with dangerous weapons, also took over the major roads in Kano.\n\nIn the Hotoro area of Kano, all shops were closed while a filling station and a Rufaida shop were also set ablaze.\n\nThe state Police Command’s spokesman, Abdullahi Kiyawa, confirmed that not less than 260 criminals were arrested via a statement.\n\n“These individuals engaged in acts of violence, destruction, looting and causing harm to innocent civilians, resulting in the destruction of public and private properties.\n\n“In a swift and efficient response to these criminal activities, a total of 269 suspects responsible for destructions, looting and instigating chaos under the guise of the nationwide hunger protest were arrested.\n\n“Numerous cans of 25 litres of groundnut oil, large quantity of stationery, foodstuffs and other valuable property were recovered from the suspects. The suspects are currently cooling their feet at the Command’s Criminal Investigation Department and thereafter they will be charged to court upon completion of investigation. More arrests and recoveries are in progress.”\n\nAlso, the Kaduna State police command confirmed an attack on the offices of the State Traffic and Law Environmental Authority and the Investment Promotions Agency by suspected hoodlums.\n\nThe command’s spokesperson, Mansir Hassan, in an interview with NAN, said 23 suspects had been detained, denying that operatives fired live ammunition on the suspects.\n\nHe said, “The protesters also burnt an Armoured Personnel Carrier and looted many shops They tried to invade Government House but were prevented, many of our personnel sustained injuries and they are receiving treatment at various hospitals.”\n\nHassan did not confirm any casualties but a video on social media indicated that the police shot dead a youth during a confrontation with some protesters.\n\nIn Gombe State, one person was feared killed during the rally but the Commissioner of Police, Hayatu Usman, denied the incident.\n\nHe said his officers recovered some looted items from criminals who operated in the disguise of the end bad governance protests.\n\nOur correspondent reports that the protest turned violent when protesters were prevented from gaining entry into the Gombe Government House after converging on the roundabout near the building.\n\nItems including bags fertiliser, and office equipment were stolen and shops around Sabonline were forcefully opened.\n\nTwo persons were reportedly killed while many others sustained injuries after police fired live ammunition and teargas to disperse protesters in Jigawa State.\n\nThe protest took place in over 10 LGAs across the state with reports of destruction and looting of government property.\n\nReports said one of the victims was shot in front of the Government House, Dutse, while the other was killed at Shiwarin town when the protesters attempted to close the Maiduguri-Kano Road.\n\nThe protesters allegedly torched the All Progressives Congress headquarters and burnt party vehicles in Dutse, the state capital.\n\nSome protesters made a bonfire near the residence of former President Muhammadu Buhari in Daura, Katsina State.\n\nThis was as hoodlums hijacked the hunger protest in some parts of the state, burning a patrol van of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps.\n\nIn Katsina, the state capital, protesters wielding placards with various inscriptions stormed the Government House to register their grievances.\n\nThe protest turned violent as police shot teargas at the protesters looting and burning of vehicles belonging to the NSCDC.\n\nViolence erupted when protesters gathered at the Modoji Road roundabout, near the Government House in Katsina, and attempted to force their way into the premises to meet with the acting Governor.\n\nAn activist, Omoyele Sowore condemned the killing and harassment of protesters across the country, adding that the citizens have the right to a peaceful protest.\n\nSowore said, “The images we are seeing of peaceful protesters being attacked and harassed, and in some cases shot dead, is sad and condemned. People have a right to peaceful protests. It is a right that is globally recognised and codified in our laws.”\n\nHe slammed the government for failing to provide economic opportunities among others for the citizens.\n\nLagos\n\nProtesters in their hundreds trooped out in Lagos on Thursday calling for an end to economic hardship and bad governance in Nigeria.\n\nThe protesters, largely youths, marched from the Ikeja Under Bridge, where they had converged as early as 8am, to the Gani Fawehinmi Park in Ojota around 11am.\n\nThe Lagos State High Court restricted the protesters to two locations in Ojota but the protesters came out in the Alausa as well to air their grievances.\n\nThey held several placards calling for ‘End Bad Government in Nigeria’, ‘Reverse fuel subsidy’, ‘Tax the rich’, and ‘Reverse electricity tariff’ among others.\n\nOur correspondents observed that during the march from Ikeja to Ojota, many stores, and offices, including banks, were shut with few vehicles on the road.\n\nThe protesters marched peacefully in the areas monitored by our correspondents but it was, however, gathered that police officers fired teargas to disperse some protesters at the Lekki Toll Gate.\n\nIn Ojota, the protesters were led, among others, by the National Coordinator of the Take It Back Movement, Juwon Sanyaolu, and the National Coordinator of the Education Rights Campaign, Hassan Taiwo.\n\nSanyaolu said the protest was to register the grievances of the “hungry people” in Lagos and Nigeria.\n\nHe added, “People whose families can no longer afford a single balanced diet in a day due to the harsh economic policies forced on all of us by the Bola Tinubu-led government.\n\n“It is important to say that this protest will continue till August 10 and beyond until the government reverses all the anti-people policies it has introduced. The FG must immediately reverse fuel subsidy removal, reverse fee hikes in schools and give students grants, not loans that they cannot pay back, because people who cannot feed themselves cannot pay any loan in this economy as you can see. “\n\nDuring the protest in Ojota, a man stripped naked as he expressed grievances over the harsh economic conditions.\n\nA patrol helicopter was spotted hovering over the venue of the #EndBadGovernance protest in the Ojota.\n\nThe white chopper moved in circles at a slow pace for about 20 minutes.\n\nA protester, Steven Adams, said he was not ready to enter the Gani Fawehinmi garden while citing the incident that occurred at the Lekki toll gate during the #EndSars protest.\n\n“I am security conscious because I don’t know the plans of the police. What if it is a trap?”\n\nThe Lagos State Police Commissioner, Adegoke Fayoade, also visited the scene of the protest.\n\nThe police boss, who arrived at about 11:25am, monitored the activities of the protesters.\n\nS’East shun protest\n\nResidents of Enugu State observed sit-at-home to protest hunger, and bad governance in Nigeria as the streets were empty of protesters on Thursday as the protest against hunger and bad governance took off nationwide.\n\nThe PUNCH correspondent, who went round the state capital, reports that\n\nIn Enugu, economic and social activities were paralysed as residents shun the protest, preferring to stay indoors. Business premises, including shops, petrol stations, malls and event centres, among others were completely under lock and key as at 10am when one of our correspondents moved around the state capital.\n\nAlthough entrance gates of major markets in Enugu such as Ogbete Main Market, New Market, Abakpa Market and Emene Market, were thrown open, there was nobody in the markets. At ShopRite and SPAR malls, only security operatives were seen around, while stern-faced soldiers and mobile policemen manned the entrance of the Okpara Square.\n\nIn Umuahia, the Abia State capital, and Aba, its commercial hub, there was also no protest but banks, corporate offices, motor parks and business premises were all shut down.\n\nIt was same scenario in Ebonyi State as banks and other businesses shut down business. Residents of Abakaliki, the state capital, rejected the protest on Thursday and thus stayed indoors out of fear, although security agencies and the state government assured them of their security.\n\nMost banks along the popular Water Works and Ogoja Road were under lock and key.\n\nThey include Access Bank, UBA, Union Bank, Zenith Bank and First Bank. The Automated Teller Machines of the banks were, however, operational.\n\nIn Owerri, the state capital, residents didn’t participate in the protest as only security operatives patrolled the metropolis in a display of show of force.\n\nImo citizens did not participate in the hunger protest as no one was seen on the streets of Owerri.\n\nReacting to the show of force, the Imo command PPRO Henry Okoye said it was to build confidence in the citizens that they should go about their lawful businesses.\n\nIn Anambra, the anti-hunger protest led to a partial collapse of economic and commercial activities on Thursday.\n\nAt Onitsha, Nnewi and Awka, banks, petrol stations and motor parks were under lock and key, while major markets were opened, but devoid of their usual activities.\n\nThere was no protest or gathering recorded at any public space, this was because most residents chose to remain indoors, while some went about their normal businesses discreetly.\n\nChecks by our correspondent also showed that major markets in the state opened for business, but they were very scanty and devoid of the usual activities.\n\nThe ever-bubbling Main Market in Onitsha was very scanty as few buyers and customers were seen opening their shops while other traders hung around the market as they watched events unfold.\n\nSouth South\n\nIn Delta State, reporters covering the nationwide anti-hunger protest were rough handled, with their smartphones smashed by anti-protest protesters.\n\nThe PUNCH correspondent Matthew Ochei and his colleagues from The Guardian, The Point and Sahara Reporter for taking pictures of the anti-protest protesters.\n\n“They insisted that we deleted the photos and recordings before they left us and then smashed our phones. The policemen on duty folded their arms and watched them attack us unchallenged.\n\n“The Pointer reporter, Mrs Lucy, who sneaked out after she was slapped, immediately rushed to the military officers for intervention.”\n\nHe added that it took the efforts of the military personnel to rescue the journalists and recover their phones but the Sahara Reporter’s phone could not be recovered.\n\nThe protest failed to take of in Imo State, although banks, markets, and business premises were shut while roads were deserted, as security operatives took over the metropolis.\n\nIn Warri and its environs, residents shun the protest and went about their legitimate businesses.\n\nMost of the banks were closed to customers, possibly for fear of hoodlums’ attack but armed security personnel were positioned at strategic locations of the metropolis, notably the popular Enerhen Junction, Airport Junction, Jakpa Junction, Effurun Roundabout, PTI Junction, DSC Roundabout, as well as the Estate Roundabout, among others, in apparent readiness to forestall possible breakdown of law and order.\n\nAlso, Major Augustine Ohegbe, the Commanding Officer, of 3 Battalion, Nigerian Army, Effurun and his men were on the ground to monitor the situation.\n\nAt the Effurun Roundabout, the Warri Area Commander, ACP Graham Imade, said, “We are here to ensure there is peace. We are all aware that there is a scheduled peaceful protest across the country. We are going around the entire Warri city, for now, Warri is peaceful. We have also done police deployment to ensure there is no breakdown of law and order.”\n\nThe PUNCH gathered that there were, however, pockets of protests within the Amukpe Roundabout by the Sapele/Benin Expressway in the Sapele Local Government Area of Delta.\n\nHowever, it did not extend to Sapele as residents went about their businesses amidst low vehicular traffic.\n\nIn Akwa Ibom, police restrictions and a downpour disrupted the protest.\n\nProtesters had converged on the Unity Park, along Udo Udoma Avenue, the police-approved venue for the protest kickoff, but the early Thursday morning rain, which lasted for several hours disrupted the nationwide planned hunger protest in the state.\n\nOur correspondent reports that most roads in Uyo, the state capital and other major cities Eket and Ikot Ekpene were deserted with passengers stranded due to the presence of few vehicles.\n\nMost civil servants did not turn up for work while markets, banks and most businesses were closed for fear of looting.\n\nIn Yenagoa, Bayelsa State, some shops that were shut Thursday morning opened for business as the situation remained peaceful and calm.\n\nHowever, some commercial banks, whose officials vetted customers in the morning, closed early for business, only allowing into their premises those who want to carry out transactions on their ATM points.\n\nMeanwhile, hoodlums tried to hijack the protest in some areas on the outskirts of Benin City, the Edo State capital.\n\nIn Country Home, Off Sapele Road, some suspected hoodlums mounted a bonfire as early as 6:30am and were collecting N500 from those who wanted to cross into the town. There were similar situations in Okagbare, Ikueniro, Upper Mission Road and others. At Iduowina, behind Bethel Faith Academy, a trailer load of rice allegedly belonging to the state government was looted.\n\nThe headquarters of Nigeria Drug Law Enforcement Agency, Edo State Command, located at the same Upper Sakponba Road, was heavily guarded by stern-looking and heavily armed operatives of the agency.\n\nThis was to prevent a reoccurrence of the burning of the office, and stealing of ammunition and hard drugs confiscated by the agency.\n\nThe state witnessed the closure of businesses as youths barricaded the roads in Benin and participated actively in the anti-hunger protest.\n\nAll the banks and other business outlets on the major roads were also closed for business, while there was a heavy security presence in government buildings.\n\nAt Ring Road, where the protesters gathered, they mounted a stage opposite the museum singing songs by popular musicians like Fela, Eedris Abdulkareem, African China and others.\n\nThe state Commissioner of Police, Funsho Adegboye, commended them for their peaceful conduct.\n\nHe said, “This is what I have been saying that this protest must be peaceful. To protest is your fundamental human right that nobody can take away from you, but I am impressed by what you have done. Edo State should be the model for other states to copy. All our men are here to protect you and I am supporting this peaceful exercise with water and some snacks for you.”\n\nFubara irks protesters\n\nIn Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital, placard-carrying youths numbering over 500 marched through the busy Aba Road to the Government House.\n\nSome of the inscriptions on their placards read, ‘We say no to bad governance in Nigeria’, ‘There is hunger in the land’, ‘Nigeria is too rich to be poor’, ‘Tinubu must go’, ‘A cup of rice is N400, how can the common man survive’, among others.\n\nThere was a mild drama at the Government House with Governor Siminalaye Fubara incurring the wrath of the protesting youths after he promised to give them money for pure water and pleaded with them to return home.\n\n“I thank you for being peaceful. I thank you for coming. I feel your pain. I want to assure you that I will deliver your message to the President.\n\n“Here in Rivers State, we will do everything to make life better. But all we need from you is to support the Federal Government. We know there is hunger but just be patient with the government. I will give you a small thing for you to drink pure water,” Fubara addressed the youths.\n\nBut in reply to his ‘pure water’ comments, the youths chorused, “No, we don’t need your money, keep your money, we want good governance in Nigeria. Tinubu must go.”\n\nEfforts by the governor to pacify them and to explain what he meant fell on deaf ears, as they continued to talk back in annoyance.\n\nA handful of journalists, activists were beaten up, handcuffed and taken by security agents to unknown destinations in Calabar, Cross River State.\n\nOur correspondent learnt Jonathan Igbal, Managing Editor of online platform CrossRiverWatch, and other activists, who were part of the peaceful protest Thursday morning, were whisked off to an undisclosed destination by the security personnel.\n\nThe journalists and activists were gathered around the popular Mary Slessor roundabout in Calabar to mark the first day of the 10 days planned protest against bad governance when they were apprehended.\n\nReacting, human rights lawyer James Ibor, said, “We challenge the authorities to produce any evidences that Ugbal and others were violent.\n\n“I strongly suspect that the security agents are those attached to the state governor Senator Bassey Otu. This is very sad. It is a disappointment and we call on Governor Otu to order the release of these journalists and activists whom I believe strongly are in government custody.”"
