        "text": "It's been nearly two years since two Pensacola teens allegedly committed first-degree felony murder during a drug deal robbery, and now one of the suspects began his trial Tuesday.\n\nNathan Douglas Brown, who is now 20 years old, allegedly killed David Purchase and Natalie Greenough on Nov. 9, 2021, after robbing them during a planned marijuana drug deal at the intersection of Waycross and Stonewall avenues.\n\nBrown and his alleged co-conspirator, Hunter Carroll, were both indicted Dec. 8, 2021, for two counts of first-degree felony murder and one count of robbery with a firearm. Prior to Brown's trial, Assistant State Attorney Trey Myers announced to the court that the state would not prosecute Brown's robbery charge.\n\nBrown arrested: ECSO: Two teens shot and killed couple in car during alleged drug deal robbery\n\nBodies discovered: ECSO: Man and woman found Tuesday morning shot to death in vehicle in Escambia County\n\nWhat is Nathan Brown accused of doing on Nov. 8, 2021?\n\nOn the morning of Nov. 9, 2021, a passerby was driving to work when she saw a silver Chrysler 300 sitting at the intersection of Waycross and Stonewall avenues. As she began to drive by, she called law enforcement when she saw what appeared to be two people slumped over.\n\nWhen law enforcement officers arrived, they discovered Purchase dead in the driver's seat and Greenough dead in the passenger's seat. Video cameras were located directly across the street from where the shooting took place, and investigators obtained a copy of the cameras’ footage.\n\n“Upon reviewing the video surveillance, you can see the vehicle that Purchase is driving pull up to the stop sign, facing south, on Waycross Avenue,” the report stated. “Two individuals walk in front of the vehicle and approach the driver’s side door, approximately five seconds later a muzzle flash can be seen inside the vehicle, followed by numerous muzzle flashes seconds afterward.”\n\nWhen deputies inspected Purchase’s cellphone they discovered multiple text messages to another cellphone about setting up a drug transaction about 2 a.m. Tuesday in the area of 207 Waycross Ave. That other cellphone was later revealed to be linked to Brown, the report stated.\n\nAuthorities quickly apprehended Brown and Carroll and found a 9mm handgun and a .22-caliber handgun hidden at Brown’s sister’s home, according to the report.\n\nWhat did the prosecutor tell the jury during Nathan Brown's first trial day?\n\nIn his opening statement, Myers told the jury the evidence only points to one conclusion.\n\n\"On Nov. 9, 2021, Nathan Brown and his friend Hunter Carroll robbed David Purchase and Natalie Greenough of a large amount of marijuana and in the process both of them, who brought their own handgun, fired (at them),\" Myers told the jury. \"David Purchase was shot. He was hit five times. Natalie, she was hit three times, killing both.\"\n\nMyers said Brown and Purchase swapped phone numbers to agree on a meeting place so Brown could purchase marijuana. He then said Brown and Carroll approached Purchase's vehicle and within seconds muzzle flashes are seen on surveillance footage.\n\nBoth Purchase and Greenough sat in the vehicle deceased for hours until the passerby found the vehicle and called law enforcement.\n\nMyers also told the jury that when Escambia County Sheriff's Office investigators arrested and questioned Brown, Brown changed his story multiple times before \"implicating himself and Carroll as being involved in a robbery.\" Myers said he admitted to committing the robbery and did not intend to kill either Purchase or Greenough.\n\n\"At the close of the evidence, the evidence will show that Nathan Brown is guilty of two counts of first-degree felony murder for the shooting and killing of David Purchase and Natalie Greenough,\" he told the jury.\n\nWhat did Nathan Brown's attorney tell the jury?\n\nBrown's attorney, Marci McCoy, used her opening statement to briefly explain that her client must be seen as innocent until Myers proves each charge beyond and to the exclusion of every reasonable doubt.\n\nMcCoy also implored the jurors to pay attention to \"evidence that wasn't looked at\" throughout the case and the multiple leads she says were not pursued in the case.\n\n\"Everything the state just told you, they have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Nathan Brown killed two people,\" she told the jury during her opening statement. \"I think at the end of the case once it's all over, you're going to have questions unanswered, and that's reasonable doubt, and we'll ask for a not guilty.\"\n\nHow long is Nathan Brown's trial scheduled?\n\nBrown's trial began Tuesday and it's scheduled to conclude Thursday.\n\nIf Nathan Brown is convicted, what sentence does he face?\n\nBoth first-degree felony murder charges are capital felonies. In the state of Florida, a conviction on a capital felony requires a minimum of life in prison without parole or the death penalty.\n\nPrior to trial, the Office of the State Attorney did not announce they would seek the death penalty, so if Brown is convicted he will serve life in Florida's Department of Corrections.\n\nCarroll, the co-defendant in the case, has his next court date scheduled for October."
