        "text": "The Research Grants Program Office (RGPO) oversees a broad grantmaking portfolio of over $100 million a year to support research that is critical to California, the nation and the world. RGPO programs enhance UC’s research capacity and excellence, which helps attract top faculty, graduate students, government funding and companies to our state. These grants also enable health researchers and community agencies to collaborate and solve the most pressing problems in the state. RGPO also provides grants for training undergraduates, graduate and postdoctoral researchers, whose work will benefit California communities. Learn more about the Research Grants Program Office (RGPO)\n\nThe Natural Reserve System aims to contribute to the understanding and wise stewardship of the Earth and its natural systems by supporting university-level teaching, research, and public service at protected natural areas throughout California. Our 38 sites include more than 750,000 acres, making it the largest university-administered reserve system in the world. Most major state ecosystems are represented, from coastal tidepools to inland deserts, and lush wetlands to Sierra Nevada forests.\n\nThe Internal Communications unit is responsible for developing and delivering a broad range of communications (print and digital) for UC’s more than 225,000 employees and 60,000 retirees. In addition to systemwide communications, the unit is also responsible for internal communications for the UC Office of the President community. Key goals include keeping employees informed about and engaged in presidential and institutional priorities; ensuring employees are receiving accurate and timely information about important university matters; fostering a sense of community, connection and shared pride within the UC community; celebrating the remarkable people of UC and their collective contributions to California and beyond; and enabling employees and retirees to make informed employment/retirement decisions.\n\nMarketing communications builds public awareness of UC’s value and its impact on the lives of people in California and beyond. Working with campus colleagues, OP leaders and our clients, we convey the breadth and depth of UC’s leadership in teaching, research and public service, and foster pride and engagement in the UC community. As stewards of the systemwide brand and visual identity we ensure the institution’s values and aspirations are brought to life in each and every communication.\n\nStrategic and Critical Communications enhance the public’s understanding of the university and its contributions to the world. The team interacts with journalists and media outlets, responding to some 150 inquiries a month; strategizes, develops and coordinates communications/messaging on various systemwide issues and events; and helps promote UC priorities through proactive media outreach and tactics. In addition, the department also evaluates and arranges media opportunities for President Drake, drafts statements and op-eds on his behalf as well as that of other senior leaders, and helps manage perennial issues and crises.\n\nEnergy and Sustainability supports efficient use of university resources and helps chart a path to eliminate UC’s use of fossil fuels through its leadership and coordination across climate and energy, transportation, green building, zero waste, water and food programs and initiatives. We are leading a bold new effort to change the sources of the energy that UC consumes through our energy services unit.\n\nWe provide support for capital programs to the campuses and medical centers which, in turn, provide services to our faculty and student body. In serving the university's needs, the staff of Capital Markets Finance is dedicated to providing efficient service with the highest standards of excellence. For debt information and financial reports, see bondholder information.\n\nSystemwide Employee & Labor Relations fosters employee engagement, negotiates and administers local and systemwide labor agreements and provides multi-faceted support toward ensuring an inclusive, diverse, collaborative and productive work environments across the UC system.\n\nExplore the sections below to learn more about these units, their programs and staff.\n\nSystemwide Finance & Administration provides leadership and strategic support in the areas of finance, administration, communication, project management, compliance and analytics to advance the overall effectiveness of SHR.\n\nExplore the sections below to learn more about these units, their programs and staff.\n\nSystemwide HR Strategy & Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) provides strategic guidance to systemwide and location-based leadership related to legal and policy obligations, workforce planning, and equity, diversity and inclusion initiatives and best practices.\n\nExplore the sections below to learn more about these units, their programs and staff.\n\nSystemwide Total Rewards creates and delivers principled total rewards programs that support the recruitment and retention of world-class faculty and staff, and involved retirees, in furtherance of UC's mission, values and vision.\n\nExplore the sections below to learn more about these units, their programs and staff.\n\nUCOP staff organizations offer individuals the opportunity to become more involved in UCOP and celebrate the diversity of our staff. All members of UCOP’s community are welcome (and encouraged) to participate in any staff organization.\n\nUCOP offers two types of UCOP staff organizations for engagement and connections:\n\nEmployee Resource Groups (ERGs)\n\nEstablished in response to recommendations from UCOP’s 2020 Anti-Racism Task Force Report, ERGs are volunteer-led organizations grouped around specific demographic categories and interests. The EDI Department works with UCOP ERGs to support their efforts and development. All ERGs have executive sponsors and receive an annual budget.\n\nAffinity Groups\n\nAffinity Groups are volunteer-led staff organizations around specific demographic categories or interests that do not generally receive funding or operational support from UCOP EDI.\n\nTo learn more, review the key differences between Employee Resource Groups and Affinity Groups at UCOP or the staff organization meeting schedule.\n\nWe encourage you to get involved to build your network, develop your skills, grow as leaders and have a voice in matters impacting the workforce experience at UCOP.\n\nComplete the interest form if you want to join multiple staff organizations or contact the staff organization leaders directly."
