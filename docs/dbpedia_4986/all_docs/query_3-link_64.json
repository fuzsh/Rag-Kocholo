        "text": "by Douglas Yeo (August 2, 2024)\n\nLife is full of surprises, unexpected moments that lead to bigger things. Try something that’s a little outside your box—your comfort zone—and you’ll probably learn something. If you’re open to learning. Our friends, Phil and Laura Spotts, taught us something about this.\n\nMy wife, Patricia, and I met Phil and Laura at our church in 2012. We had just moved to Arizona after I retired from my long career as a member of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Phil struck me right away as a gregarious, “can do” kind of guy. The kind of person who is always volunteering to do something, make things happen. Phil’s an engineer but not one of those stuffy, geeky, academic types. He’s real, has a great sense of humor, and is always thinking about how to help others. Laura is a gifted pianist who played piano from time to time at our church services, another truly wonderful person. When we met them, they had a son, Cody, and in time, they became Superheroes and adopted two more children, Gage and Annaliese. There was something about this family that made Pat and me smile. We spent time together, went over to each other’s houses for dinner (Phil is a terrific cook, and we still use his fantastic leg of lamb recipe several times a year), we shared life. And our friendship grew even as we were very different people in some ways. For instance, they liked—no, they LOVED—something that was a mystery to me: NASCAR. I’m not gonna lie: before I met Phil and Laura, my life had no place for NASCAR. Growing up in and around New York City and living in Boston for nearly three decades, I fell into the east coast snobbery when it comes to things like NASCAR. “Go fast, turn left.” Doesn’t sound very interesting. Also, fast cars are loud and I work hard to protect my hearing. Big hair, beer, southern accents—those are some of the many stereotypes you bring to something like NASCAR when you’re in a cocoon in some parts of the elitist northeast.\n\nPhil and Laura Spotts at Phoenix International Raceway, March 2, 2014\n\nSo, when Phil and Laura invited Pat and me to go to a NASCAR race at Phoenix International Raceway (November 2013), my mind quickly buzzed around through all of my NASCAR stereotypes before I said, in a confident voice, “Sure. Let’s go!” And we did. Because this was important to our friends.\n\nPanoramic view of Phoenix International Raceway, March 2, 2014\n\nThe experience of going to a NASCAR race is unlike anything I’ve done in my life. I love football, and I enjoy baseball. I know what it is to cheer my team at a game, to engage with other fans around me. But NASCAR was something different all together. First, it was BIG. A lot of people go to races. A. Lot. Some come in campers and motor homes, driving from race to race and living in temporary camps that surround a racetrack, a camp that usually has a popup supermarket, bank, and urgent care center. For race weekend, a NASCAR track becomes a small city.\n\nPhil and Laura had headsets for us that were both excellent hearing protection—I have to say, though, as I looked around from my seat, I was stunned to see so many people who were not wearing any kind of hearing protection, wow—and were connected to Phil’s radio scanner that gave us the race feed. Before the race I kept asking questions. I realized quickly that there was a lot more to NASCAR than the stereotypes I had carried with me for so long. This is a high-tech sport. There is a LOT of money involved. It’s really dangerous for the drivers. Fans are passionate about their drivers and their cars. Sponsorship is really, REALLY important. Pit crews—the crew of technicians who service cars before and during the race—work incredibly hard and fast, like a well-oiled machine. And there is a whole lot of strategy.\n\nDouglas and Patricia Yeo, Phoenix International Raceway, November 10, 2013\n\nThere were other things. At the race, I didn’t have any skin in the game; I didn’t know any drivers, so I asked Phil and Laura who there favorite drivers were. OK, they were now my favorite drivers. But when cars are racing around the track at 180 miles an hour at 130dB (that is loud, like a jet engine ready for takeoff on a runway), there’s no point in cheering during the race. Your driver can’t hear you. Other fans can’t hear you. Heck, you can’t even hear yourself. When the cars were roaring around the track, I didn’t dare take off my headset and expose my ears, so if I wanted to say something to Pat, Phil, or Laura, I pulled out my phone and typed a text message and showed it to them.\n\nPhoenix International Raceway, March 2, 2014\n\nBefore the race there was the National Anthem, then a flyover and a prayer, and then we were—literally—off to the races. And somehow, what enfolded in front of me captivated me in a way I didn’t expect. As I saw it with my own eyes, as I gave it a chance, as I tried to understand it, I found myself pulled into it. The old stereotypes fell away; I was learning something new. And I liked it. And that experience would not have happened were it not for friends that asked us to do something that they loved and wanted to share with us. I learned a very important lesson on that day. Several, actually. When, a year later (March 2014), Phil and Laura asked us to go to another race at Phoenix International Raceway, we did.\n\nThen Phil took a new job and their family moved to Tennessee. Pat and I moved to the Chicago area so we could live near our grandchildren. While Phil and I weren’t seeing each other regularly any more—something we did a lot when we both lived in the Phoenix area, especially meeting for lunch at our favorite sushi place, Ah-Hai in Goodyear (yes, there really and truly is amazing sushi in the desert!)—we kept in touch, texting and talking on the phone. Then Phil called one day to tell me Cody started playing the trombone—Phil said that Cody picked the trombone because he had heard me play trombone in our church.\n\nPoster of Cody Spotts, trombonist at East Hamilton High School, Tennessee\n\nThen, last October, Phil texted me. Cody was graduating from high school in a few months and Phil wanted to take him to a NASCAR race as a graduation present. Any race, anywhere. And Cody said, “I want to go to the Chicago Street Race with Mr. Yeo.” Phil and Cody were coming to Chicago and they asked me to go to another NASCAR race. Of course I said “yes.” I was excited. July 6 and 7, 2024 couldn’t come soon enough.\n\nDouglas Yeo and, Phil and Cody Spotts, Portillo’s, July 5, 2024\n\nI picked up Phil and Cody at Chicago’s O’Hare airport and because Cody had never been to Chicago, they wanted to immerse themselves in “the full Chicago experience.” We started with lunch at that iconic Chicago hot dog restaurant, Portillo’s. A Vienna Beef hotdog on a sesame seed bun, tomatoes, mustard, relish, dill pickle, raw onions, sport (hot) peppers, celery salt—but NO KETSUP! There’s nothing like it and Portillo’s is the place to get the real deal.\n\nDouglas Yeo and Cody and Phil Spotts, Giordano’s, July 5, 2024\n\nDinner that night was at Giordano’s where Cody experienced his first Chicago style deep dish pizza. Pat and I don’t eat at Portillo’s and Giordano’s very often—our low fat diet doesn’t have a lot of room for zillion calorie, high fat meals—but, hey, now and then, you gotta live a little.\n\nCourse map for NASCAR 2024 Chicago Street Race\n\nThe Chicago Street Race is a unique NASCAR event. It’s a race (two races, actually) that—literally—goes through streets of downtown Chicago. Instead of a long oval track, the Chicago race track is a modified figure-8, a course that snakes through the heart of the city, along Lake Shore Drive, Michigan Avenue, and South Columbus Drive. Phil had gotten Turn 1 Reserved tickets for the three of us in the Jack Daniels Turn 1 Club. I didn’t know what that meant but I found out soon enough.\n\nCody and Phil Spotts at “The Bean” (officially called Cloudgate), Millenium Park, Chicago, July 6, 2024\n\nWe took the train from College Avenue Station in Wheaton, Illinois, to downtown Chicago and walked toward Millenium Park near Chicago’s waterfront. There, we walked around as I showed Phil and Cody some of the iconic things in the Park, like “The Bean.” In the photo above, you can see me in my orange Phoenix International Raceway shirt, reflected in this remarkable public art installation, taking this snapshot of Cody and Phil.\n\nDouglas Yeo and Cody and Phil Spotts, Millenium Park, Chicago, July 6, 2024\n\nOnce we got through the turnstiles with our wristbands, we made our way to our seats to get a look at our view. It was stunning. As one who knows Chicago pretty well, it was truly remarkable to see the race course laid out on roads and in view of iconic buildings that I had seen in completely different contexts.\n\nThe view from our seats for the NASCAR Chicago Street Race Weekend, Jack Daniels Turn 1 Club, July 6, 2024. The start/finish line was down South Columbus Drive by the grandstand in the right of this photo. The Sears Tower (AKA Willis Tower) is the tall building on the left of the photo, with white antennas on top.\n\nI mean, there we were, seated on South Columbus Drive, with the Sears Tower (OK, I know it’s been called the Willis Tower since 2009, but no Chicagoan calls it by that name) and the hotels of Michigan Avenue in view. I have driven down South Columbus Drive many times on the way home from Chicago Bears games at Soldier Field but traffic is always going north. For the race, the cars would be going south. It took some time for me to get my arms around that. It was surreal to see the city transformed into a racetrack.\n\nPhil and Cody Spotts and Douglas Yeo, Jack Daniels Turn 1 Club, July 6, 2024\n\nPhil really outdid himself with tickets in the Turn 1 club; it was a lavish gift. We had terrific reserved seats, a nice, shaded area where we could relax, and UNLIMITED amazing food and drink. During the whole race, the three of us grazed on fantastic food. It was always there for us, all day long. What a special experience it was to sit in such remarkable seats with these amenities. And it happened because of friendship.\n\nMONSTER Energy Drink acrobatic motorcyclists, Chicago, July 6, 2024\n\nBefore the race, we walked around to all of the sponsor tents, the NASCAR shop, and the wide open area where concerts were going on all day. The MONSTER Energy Drink acrobatic motorcyclists did their show; it was breathtaking.\n\nShane Van Gisbergen (97 car) after crossing the finish line at the Loop 110 NASCAR Xfinity Series Race, Chicago, July 6, 2024\n\nAnd then Saturday’s race, the Loop 110 NASCAR Xfinity Series Race, began. I can’t explain it. It was such a totally different experience than I had at Phoenix International Raceway. Drivers were not going in a loop, always turning left. They were navigating sharp 90-degree turns after long and short straightaways. Speeds were fast, but not as fast as a regular oval track NASCAR race. The cars went flying by; we followed the progress of the race in our headsets. It was absolutely thrilling. The race was won by Shane van Ginsbergen in his 97 car. If you want to get an idea of what we saw, click here to view the whole race on YouTube.\n\nCody and Phil Spotts at the beginning of historic Route 66 begins, Michigan Avenue, Chicago, July 7, 2024\n\nAfter the race, we took the train home and after a short night of sleep, we headed back to Chicago for Sunday’s race, the Grant Park 165. When we got downtown, I wanted to show Phil and Cody where historic Route 66 started—at the intersection of Michigan Avenue and East Adams Street, just across from the Art Institute of Chicago. I took this photo (above) while I was STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF MICHIGAN AVENUE. I had never done THAT before.\n\nDouglas Yeo and Cody and Phil Spotts, Buckingham Fountain, Chicago, July 7, 2024\n\nIn the center of Chicago’s Grant Park is the Buckingham Fountain. It was a centerpiece of our race days, its fountains providing soft mist to cool off on hot days.\n\nDouglas Yeo and Cody and Phil Spotts, on the NASCAR Chicago Street Race track, E. Balbo Drive, Chicago, July 7, 2024. Note the temporary bridge over E. Balbo Drive.\n\nOnce we got in the Park, we had an opportunity to walk ON THE TRACK. This was another thrill, to get up close to the view the drivers had.\n\nDouglas Yeo in the rain, NASCAR Chicago Street Race, July 7, 2024\n\nWhile the day—and the race—started off with beautiful sunshine, we knew that rain was in the forecast. And the rain came. It sprinkled. Then it cleared up. Then the skies opened up and it poured. And poured, and poured.\n\nDouglas Yeo and Cody and Phil Spotts during the NASCAR race delay, July 7, 2024\n\nThe race continued for awhile in the rain but when it simply got too wet for drivers to race safely, we found ourselves in a rain delay of nearly two hours. We hung out at a picnic table in the Turn 1 Club, under an umbrella. The rain didn’t dampen our spirits. We were still having a great time, grazing on food and drink nonstop, enjoying conversations, talking about the race, the cars, and the drivers. When confronted with a situation you can’t control, you make the best of the situation. As teachers at our grandchildren’s elementary school frequently say, “You got what you get and you don’t throw a fit.” The rain didn’t matter. A lot of fans left but we stayed to watch the race start up, shortened because it was getting dark. Once again, it was a thrill to see the drivers cautiously—at over 100 miles per hour!—navigate the slick race course.\n\nAlex Bowman (48 car) after crossing the finish line at the Grant Park 165 NASCAR Cup Series Race, Chicago, July 7, 2024\n\nThe race was won by Alex Bowman in his 48 car, and as he crossed the finish line, the rain stopped, the sun started to come out from behind the clouds even as it was setting, and we finished our days of enjoying racing in downtown Chicago.

Its fountains had been turned off for the night but I don’t think I’ve ever seen it look more beautiful than in the twilight of that Sunday night after the race.\n\nDouglas Yeo and Cody and Phil Spotts atop the Sears Tower (AKA Willis Tower), Chicago, July 8, 2024. The red circle shows where we sat for the NASCAR Street Race.\n\nWe headed home again but our time together was not over. Cody wanted to do something he had never done before: go up a seriously tall building. So we took the train back to Chicago on Monday morning and visited the Sears Tower. From the observation deck, we looked down on the race course. In the photo above, you can see where our seats were in the red circle I drew between Cody and Phil. And yes, I’m wearing a Shane Van Gisbergen t-shirt. I’m a fan.\n\nCody and Phil Spotts on “The Ledge,” Sears Tower (AKA Willis Tower), Chicago, July 8, 2024.\n\nBut there was a limit to what I would do. While Cody and Phil happily—and fearlessly—walked out on the Sears Tower’s “The Ledge”—looking straight down 103 floors through glass to the street below—I was happy to be their official photographer, my feet firmly planted on the carpeted floor.\n\n\\\n\nDouglas Yeo and Cody Spotts, July 8, 2024\n\nWhen we got back to our house after yet another train ride (Pat had prepared a delicious dinner; as good as the food was at the race, it was nice to be home and have Pat’s wonderful home cooking), Cody and I played trombone duets. I’d never heard Cody play trombone before and it was so great spend some time together with trombones in our hands. The thing that solidified Cody’s and my friendship—the trombone—was shared in a memorable, tangible way.\n\nThis is friendship. Being together, talking together, sharing together, enjoying experiences together. Saying “Yes” when a friend asks you to do something you can’t imagine yourself doing. And then appreciating how they stretched you. And saying—and showing—”thank you” when someone gives you a gift—and Phil and Cody gave me a remarkable gift. Not just tickets to a race weekend, but a shared brotherhood that started with our shared faith in Christ. The three of us know and truly understand what the Apostle Paul meant when he wrote, “Therefore encourage one another and build one another up, just as you are doing.” (1 Thessalonians 5:11) Though separated by distance, when Cody asked to come to the Chicago Street Race with his dad and enjoy it with me, we picked up our relationship like we were next door neighbors who had never been apart. That is friendship.\n\nBefore I went to the NASCAR Chicago Street Race weekend I did not know what to expect. These friends taught me a lot. We shared something that has bound us together in a new way, and I will treasure the memory. Just as I treasure our friendship. Thank you, friends.\n\nOfficial program and my wristbands for the 2024 NASCAR Chicago Street Race Weekend, July 6-7, 2024\n\nby Douglas Yeo (June 6, 2024)\n\nSince the International Trombone Association (ITA) was founded in 1972, it has held an annual gathering of trombonists. In the Association’s early years, the gathering was called the International Trombone Workshop, and in recent years, it’s been the International Trombone Festival (ITF). I have been to eight of these events, in 1982 (Nashville, TN), 1999 (Potsdam, NY), 2004 (Ithaca, NY), 2014 (Rochester, NY), 2017 (Redlands, CA), 2018 (Iowa City, IA), 2022 (Conway, AR), and, last week (Fort Worth, TX). Since the conclusion of the Festival on Saturday, I’ve been reflecting on this extraordinary event and its impact not only on me, but on the world-wide community of trombonists. Here are some of my impressions. . .\n\nTHE IDEA\n\nAs readers of The Last Trombone know, I have taught trombone on the college level for over 40 years. I’ve worked with hundreds of students, taught thousands of lessons and classes, and I’ve followed the career path of many of the students whose lives intersected with mine in those institutions. I taught at New England Conservatory of Music in Boston from 1985-2012, and there was a period in the late 1980s and early 1990s that brought an exceptional group of students into my orbit.\n\nThe New England Trombone Choir at New England Conservatory, Spring 1990, Douglas Yeo, conductor. Among the students playing in the ensemble (some are not shown in this frame) are Julie Josephson, R. Douglas Wright, Petur Erickson, Randall Hestand, Brett Shuster, David Begnoche (in the circle, just above me), Jeffrey Hall, Darren Acosta.\n\nAmong these students was David Begnoche, a tenor trombonist who graduated from NEC in 1990 with his Bachelor of Music degree. After studying with John Swallow and me at New England Conservatory of Music, David went on to Manhattan School of Music for his master’s degree, then to University of North Texas for his doctorate. Along the way, he had positions playing trombone with the Joffrey Ballet Orchestra (Chicago), the Sarasota (Florida) Opera, the Albany (New York) Symphony, and the Spoleto Orchestra (Italy). David landed at Texas Christian University (TCU) in Fort Worth, Texas, where he serves as Associate Professor of Trombone. David also is Second Vice-President of the International Trombone Association, a position to which he was elected by the Association’s membership.\n\nDavid and I have been in close contact since he graduated from NEC—long ago, we made the jump from student/teacher to being colleagues—and I have always enjoyed working with him. I’ve taken part in his annual TCU Trombone Summit on two occasions, and we frequently talk about big issues that face the trombone community and the ITA—and the world. In 2020, he reached out to me and said he was considering hosting the International Trombone Festival at some point. From the jump, David wanted the Festival he hosted to be impactful and diverse. He sent me a long document with his dream list of individuals and groups and ideas that might make up such a Festival. More on this below—because it is important to acknowledge where seminal ideas for the 2024 International Trombone Festival came from—but as we started talking about his hopes and dreams for a TCU based International Trombone Festival, I knew I had to be there. And, when the announcement was made that David Begnoche would host the 2024 ITF at Texas Christian University, I made plans to be there.\n\nAs things developed, I ended up being involved in a host of activities at the 2024 International Trombone Festival. But first, I had to get there.\n\nTHE TRIP\n\nIt seemed so simple. Fly from Chicago’s Midway Airport to Dallas/Love Field (DAL). The flight was only a couple of hours long with no time change. The Festival began on Wednesday, May 29, so I made plans to fly to Dallas in the morning of Tuesday, May 28. The weather in Chicago was clear, and while there had been storms in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, I had no idea what was about to unfold. My 8:25 am departure was delayed to 9:00, then 10:00, then 12:00, then 1:00, then 2:00. After three hours of delays while waiting in the terminal, we had another three hours of delays while sitting on the plane. Then, at 2:30 pm, my flight was cancelled. There had been a violent storm in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. Large hail had pummeled Love Field and all of the planes on the ground needed to be inspected for hail damage. Which meant that planes on the ground at Love Field sat at gates waiting for inspection and no new planes could arrive. As I disembarked from my plane and went to the rebooking counter, I learned there would be no more flights going from Chicago to Dallas on that day, or the next day until late at night. I needed to get to Fort Worth in time for the opening ceremony at 10:00 am at Wednesday and my first presentation at 11:30 am. I wasn’t able to fly. So I did the only thing I could: I got my suitcase, put my trombone on my shoulder, walked to my car in the airport parking lot, and started driving.\n\nThe Google Maps display on my iPhone as I began my drive from Chicago’s Midway Airport to the Hyatt Place Fort Worth TCU Hotel, Tuesday, May 28, 2024.\n\nI’ve driven long distances before. But when my GPS said “14 hours, 52 minutes – 948 miles,” I was in new territory. I needed to drive straight through without an overnight stop. An all-nighter was in my future. It was the only way to get to the Festival in time for its opening and my first presentation. There was no other option. I was about to find out how a college senior on a spring break road trip feels. After fortifying myself with many bottles of Diet Coke, bottles of water, food, and a box of No-Doz, I headed down Interstate 55 to Texas. Texas. The words, “I’m driving to Texas,” had never previously been in my lexicon.\n\nThe Saint Louis Gateway Arch coming into view. Tuesday, May 28, 2024.\n\nAt about 8:30 pm, I passed through St. Louis at sunset (photo above). I stopped 10 times along the way, and I pulled into the parking lot at the Hyatt Place Fort Worth/TCU at 7:30 am on Wednesday. 950 miles, 16 hours in the car. I got to my room, took a shower, unpacked, had breakfast, and headed to campus to warm up on the trombone. I made it. Here are some impressions of things I did at the Festival, both planned and spontaneous. These kinds of festivals are so loaded with activities that it was impossible to take in everything I wanted to experience. But for me, the best part of an International Trombone Festival is meeting and talking with PEOPLE: friends, colleagues, former and current students, and individuals I had never met before. Here’s some of what occupied me at TCU.\n\nCover to the Program for the 2024 International Trombone Festival, Texas Christian University, Fort Worth, Texas.

Wednesday, May 29, 2024.\n\nWhen David Begnoche and I talked about his dreams for hosting an International Trombone Festival, he wanted to have things that were not ordinarily a part of the Festival. Among these was a strong trombone research component. I immediately told him I would like to do a presentation about Joannès Rochut, the celebrated French trombonist who, among many things, was principal trombonist of the Boston Symphony Orchestra from 1925–1930, and published the most famous books of trombone music in the history of the instrument, Melodious Etudes for Trombone Selected From the Vocalises of Marco Bordogni (Carl Fischer, 1928).\n\nDouglas Yeo presentation, Joannès Rochut: More Than Bordogni. Van Cliburn Band Room, 2024 International Trombone Festival, Texas Christian University. Wednesday, May 29, 2024.\n\nI have been researching Joannès Rochut since I joined the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1985 and this was the time to finally get serious and give a scholarly presentation about him. This presentation was a summary of my research and the full story will be told in my forthcoming article about Joannès Rochut that will appear in the January 2025 International Trombone Association Journal.\n\nVan Cliburn Band Room at TCU was packed for my presentation. I’ve given many scholarly presentations at International Trombone Festivals over the years but this was the first one that was given to a packed room of over 200 people. I was heartened by the strong interest in my lecture, and the Festival was underway.\n\nPERFORMANCE—TCU TROMBONE CHOIR WITH RONALD BARRON\n\nTexas Christian University Trombone Choir, David Begnoche, conductor (2024 International Trombone Festival program). Wednesday, May 29, 2024.\n\nFor my first 23 years as a member of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, our trombone section was Ronald Barron (principal), Norman Bolter (second), and me (bass). David Begnoche asked me if I would be interested in playing a duet with Ron on the TCU trombone choir concert at the Festival. Of course! I had not seen Ron since I retired from the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 2012 (Ron retired from the orchestra in 2008). While we have kept in contact over the years, I was really looking forward to this reunion with Ron.\n\nRonald Barron and Douglas Yeo performing Leonard Bernstein’s “Make Our Garden Grow” from Candide, with the Texas Christian University Trombone Choir, David Begnoche, conductor.

Van Cliburn Hall, 2024 International Trombone Festival, Texas Christian University. Wednesday, May 29, 2024.\n\nDavid Begnoche asked us if we would play a trombone duet arrangement of Leonard Bernstein’s “Make Our Garden Grow” from Candide. I had played this arrangement before and I love the message of this piece. It contains these lines:\n\nAnd let us try, before we die,\n\nTo make some sense of life.\n\nWe’re neither pure, nor wise, nor good,\n\nWe’ll do the best we know. . . And make our garden grow.\n\nRon read these lines to the audience before we played the duet in honor of Dr. Irv Wagner, the long-time professor of trombone at University of Oklahoma and a past President of the ITA, and I will never forget the feeling I had during the performance. There I was, on stage with the TCU trombone choir (I told many people that the TCU trombone studio is like the United Nations, a group of students of diverse genders who are of a host of racial and ethnic groups), playing with a dear friend and colleague with whom I had shared a very long season of life, Ron Barron, and conducted by my former student and now colleague, David Begnoche. Memorable.\n\nAWARD PRESENTATION—THE 2024 INTERNATIONAL TROMBONE ASSOCIATION LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD\n\nThe 2024 International Trombone Association Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nIn March, I was informed that I was a recipient of the 2024 International Trombone Association Lifetime Achievement Award; I have previously written about this on The Last Trombone. This is a great honor as I became one of only 17 people in the history of the International Trombone Association to receive both the ITA Award (which I received in 2014) and the ITA Lifetime Achievement Award. Among these individuals are some of my trombone heroes, mentors, and friends, including Edward Kleinhammer, Urbie Green, Allen Ostrander, George Roberts, Denis Wick, Ronald Barron, and Irvin Wagner. Adding to this special moment was the fact that I received the 2024 ITA Lifetime Achievement Award along with my good friend, Benny Sluchin (more on him, below). Dr. Ava Ordman, chair of the ITA’s Standing Committee on Awards, introduced David Begnoche who then made the presentation to me. This was a special moment in my life, to be recognized in this way by my peers in an area of my life that has been so important since I began playing the trombone at the age of nine in 1964. And I hope it is a little premature: I sure hope I have more living to do in this lifetime!\n\nAccepting the International Trombone Association 2024 Lifetime Achievement Award with David Begnoche and Benny Sluchin, Landreth Hall, 2024 International Trombone Festival, Texas Christian University. Wednesday, May 29, 2024.\n\nFRIENDS\n\nMy work at the International Trombone Festival had only just begun, but as I mentioned earlier, the most important—the most fun—part of these Festivals is meeting with people. Friends, colleagues, former and current students, and people I had never met previously. Some of these encounters were planned, others were spontaneous.\n\nAngel Subero, Douglas Yeo, and John Rojak. 2024 International Trombone Festival, Texas Christian University. Wednesday, May 29, 2024.\n\nI met up with my former student Angel Subero, a superb Boston-based bass trombonist who is equally conversant in salsa, Latin jazz, classical, and new music. Angel studied trombone with me when he was a student at Boston Conservatory of Music and New England Conservatory of Music. I had not seen Angel since I left Boston in 2012 and later in the Festival, we would find ourselves playing together on the same stage (more on that below). John Rojak, bass trombonist of the American Brass Quintet, has been a friend for nearly four decades; it was so good to see him again.\n\nGracie Potter and Douglas Yeo, 2024 International Trombone Festival, Texas Christian University. Friday, May 31, 2024.\n\nI was not able to attend the finals of any of the many International Trombone Association competitions. I have always enjoyed going to those, and sometime adjudicating one of them, but my schedule was so busy that it just wasn’t possible this time. So it was serendipitous that when coming back to campus one day after lunch, I ran into Gracie Potter. Gracie took many lessons with me when I was living in Phoenix, Arizona (2012-2018), and she was competing in the Frank Smith Competition. It was so nice to catch up with Gracie who recently graduated from the Colburn School and has accepted a one-year position as principal trombonist with the Richmond (Virginia) Symphony. And Gracie won the Frank Smith competition! The finals piece was the first movement of Derek Bourgeois’ Trombone Concerto. Meeting up with Gracie was a very happy moment for me at the Festival. Brava, Gracie.\n\nDouglas Yeo, John Rojak, Jennifer Wharton, and David Taylor, 2024 International Trombone Festival, Texas Christian University. Thursday, May 30, 2024.\n\nJennifer Wharton, the superb New York City based bass trombonist who plays in big bands, her own band, and Broadway shows, was at the Festival. Her husband, John Fedchock, accepted the 2024 ITA Award during the Festival and I was really happy to spend some time with Jen. She studied with me at New England Conservatory of Music in the 1990s and during the Festival, Jen, David Taylor (more about him, below) and I had lunch together. On our way back to campus, we saw John Rojak, the quintessential New Yorker—jaywalking and talking on his phone at the same time. When he safely got to our side of the street, I snapped this photo, above.\n\nDavid Yacus at the 2024 International Trombone Festival, Texas Christian University. Friday, May 31, and Saturday, June 1, 2024.\n\nOne of the things David Begnoche wanted to have at the International Trombone Festival was an emphasis on early music. This has not regularly been a part of the ITF and early trombone specialist David Yacus gave a presentation, “ITF Antiqua: The Dawn of the Trombone. . . Ancient and Exotic Origins,” and a performance, “ITF Antiqua—17th-century Venice: Beyond the Basilica.” David studied bass trombone with me at New England Conservatory of Music in the 1980s and he is regarded as one of the finest exponents of the early trombone (often but not especially accurately referred to as the “sackbut”). His presentation was of a very high level as he discussed the precursors to the trombone and the various evolutionary theories that gave us the instrument we hold in our hands today. His concert, assisted by early trombonist Bodie Pfost as well as fine artists on violin, organ, and voice, was spectacular. There is a lot more to the trombone than “higher/faster/louder” and David Yacus brought something quite nice—even remarkable—to the Festival that gave all of us a lot to think about. David Yacus’ participation in the Festival along with the trombone research roundtable (discussed below) were part of David Begnoche’s conscious effort to demonstrate alternative career avenues for trombonists beyond obsessing over “winning” auditions. The trombone community is deep and wide and part of the ITF was to expose attendees to a wide swath of trombone-related career and avocational options.\n\nDennis Bubert, bass trombone, with Shields Collins Bray, piano, Van Cliburn Hall, 2024 International Trombone Festival, Texas Christian University. Saturday, June 1, 2024.\n\nDennis Bubert and I have been friends for many years. He has been bass trombonist of the Fort Worth Symphony since 1981 (the same year I joined the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, where I worked until 1985 when I joined the Boston Symphony Orchestra) and he studied with Edward Kleinhammer when he was a student at Illinois Wesleyan University in the 1970s, at the same time I was studying with Mr. Kleinhammer when I was a student at Wheaton College. Dennis played a fine recital at the ITF that included John Stevens’ The Kleinhammer Sonata. Dennis and I shared breakfast together the morning I headed back home from the Festival and it was good to have time face to face which is so much more rewarding than phone calls, text messages, and email that are our regular modes of communication.\n\nPresentation of the International Trombone Association’s Orchestra Recognition Award to Fort Worth Symphony President and CEO Dr. Keith Cerny with Louis Borges (representing the ITA Standing Committee on Awards) and David Begnoche. Douglas Yeo, Ronald Barron, and Robert Spano. Bass Performance Hall, Fort Worth, Texas. Friday, May 31, 2024.\n\nI also got to see and hear Dennis perform with the Fort Worth Symphony. One of the many things that David Begnoche envisioned for the 2024 International Festival was the premiere of a new work for trombone and orchestra. His advocacy for this project led to the commissioning of Kevin Day’s Departures for trombone, piano and orchestra. Kevin Day is one of today’s leading composers and he is also a TCU graduate. Departures was premiered by the Fort Worth Symphony last week with trombonist Peter Steiner and pianist Constanze Hochwartner; Bass Hall was packed for the performance. Before the concert, the International Trombone Association’s Orchestra Recognition Award was presented to the Fort Worth Symphony, and after the concert (which also included Gustav Mahler’s Symphony No. 5), Ron and I went backstage with Dennis to say hello to Fort Worth Symphony Music Director Robert Spano. Ron and I knew Bob when Bob was an assistant conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra in the early 1990s. Dennis snapped a photo of Ron and me with Bob; it was nice to see him again after so many years.\n\nDouglas Yeo and David Wilborn. Van Cliburn Band Room, 2024 International Trombone Festival, Texas Christian University. Friday, May 31, 2024.\n\nThe Festival presented many opportunities to meet new friends. Many participants in the Festival came up to talk to me. Some were people I had emailed many years ago or I had helped in some way. Others, like composer David F. Wilborn (professor of performance studies at Texas A&M University), were people whose music I had played but whom I had never met. I played David’s Concertino for Bass Trombone in a faculty recital I gave at Wheaton College in 2022 and when he came up to me after the trombone research roundtable (more on that below), it was so nice to talk with him and move him from an email contact to a friend I had finally met in person.\n\nBreakfast at the Hyatt Place Fort Worth TCU, Sunday June 2, 2024. Douglas Yeo, Abbie Conant, David Taylor, Debra Taylor, Dennis Bubert. Sunday, June 2, 2024.\n\nAll of what I’ve just written about meeting with friends at the ITF is just the tip of the iceberg. I enjoyed conversations and meals with players, teachers, and students from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Latvia, England, Germany, France, Portugal and all over the United States. And countries I’ve already forgotten. Seeing and talking with Michael Dease, Abbie Conant (who received the 2024 ITA Neill Humfeld Excellence in Trombone Teaching Award), Debra Taylor, JoDee Davis, Bradley Palmer, and so many others made this Festival especially rewarding. For me, this Festival—for all of the performances and presentations—is about the PEOPLE who come together with the common bond of the trombone.\n\nA SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH YAMAHA\n\nIn 1986, the Boston Symphony Orchestra toured Japan and while there, YAMAHA Corporation invited our trombone section to come to the YAMAHA factory in Hamamatsu to try YAMAHA trombones. We (Ron Barron, Norman Bolter, and me) all agreed to go to the YAMAHA factory and it was at that time that my relationship with YAMAHA began. As a result of that meeting, I began working with YAMAHA on the development of a new bass trombone, the YBL-622 which later became the YBL-822G. Since that time, I’ve been to Japan more times than I can count, during trips with the Boston Symphony Orchestra (many tours conducted by Seiji Ozawa),the Boston Pops Orchestra (two tours conducted by John Williams), and teaching/performing trips to the Hamamatsu International Wind Instrument Academy and Festival. I’ve continued my happy relationship with YAMAHA in Hamamatsu and Tokyo, in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and in New York City and Boston. Testing of new improvements to my Yamaha bass trombone are a regular thing, and this relationship with YAMAHA that has spanned nearly 40 years is a great joy to me.\n\nMasashi Nishimura (liaison between YAMAHA Japan and YAMAHA America), Jonathan Goldman, Douglas Yeo, Wayne Tanabe, and John Wittmann. After the International Trombone Association Lifetime Achievement Award Ceremony, 2024 International Trombone Festival, Texas Christian University. Wednesday, May 29, 2024.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the International Trombone Festival, John Wittmann (Associate Vice President, Artist Relations for YAMAHA) told me that he and others would like to get together with me while we were in Fort Worth. I always enjoy seeing my friends at YAMAHA so I happily agreed. I spent some time at the YAMAHA booth in the vendors area of the Festival, and before, during, and on Wednesday evening after I received the ITA’s Lifetime Achievement Award, my friends from YAMAHA were there with me. On Thursday evening, I joined John Wittmann, Jonathan Goldman, Wayne Tanabe, and Chris Manners of YAMAHA for a nice dinner at an iconic Fort Worth restaurant, Reata.\n\nYAMAHA advertisement in the 2024 International Trombone Festival program.\n\nI should have known something was up when I turned to page 11 of the International Trombone Festival program and saw YAMAHA’s full page advertisement that congratulated me on receiving the ITA’s Lifetime Achievement Award. When I first saw the ad, you could have knocked me over with a feather. My friendship and partnership with YAMAHA has been a very big part of my life and I was deeply moved by this generous expression that celebrated our long collaboration. This was an unexpected gift to me but I was totally unprepared for what happened after dinner.\n\nGift from YAMAHA to Douglas Yeo, International Trombone Festival, 2024, Fort Worth, Texas. Thursday, May 31, 2024.\n\nAt the end of our meal at Reata (and it was a fine, fine meal), Jon Goldman said a few words and presented me with a gift from YAMAHA. The design of this very special gift was a collaboration between YAMAHA Corporation Japan and YAMAHA Corporation America. I could hardly speak when I held it in my hand. A gold plated copy of my YAMAHA Douglas Yeo Signature Series mouthpiece was mounted on a highly polished metal base (it is heavy!) with an inscription of friendship. I do not have enough words to express my gratitude to YAMAHA for the relationship we have had over the years which goes much further than simply bass trombone instrument and mouthpiece development. For me, working with YAMAHA has been all about its PEOPLE, whether in Japan, the United States, Canada, or Europe. PEOPLE, not corporations, make things happen, and this dinner with and gift from YAMAHA were emblematic of how everything we do with trombones in our hands happen because of relationships with people that are strong and lasting. Thank you, YAMAHA.\n\nWayne Tanabe, Jonathan Goldman, Douglas Yeo, and John Wittmann after dinner in Fort Worth, Texas. Thursday, May 30, 2024.\n\nROUNDTABLE DISCUSSION—DIVERSITY CONSIDERATIONS IN PROGRAMMING\n\nDouglas Yeo, Natalie Mannix, Noelia Escalzo, and Rob Deemer (not shown in this photograph are roundtable moderator David Begnoche and David Taylor) at the roundtable discussion, Diversity Considerations in Programming. Landreth Hall, 2024 International Trombone Festival, Texas Christian University. Thursday, May 30, 2024.\n\nDavid Begnoche wanted the 2024 International Trombone Festival to be the most diverse in the history of the Festival. Among the things that was important to him was that the Festival have a roundtable discussion by individuals who would discuss the importance of diverse programming, of moving our repertoire out of the “standard canon” to include works by composers who have traditionally been underrepresented in trombone recital programming. As one who has written widely about the regrettable use of racist tropes in the marketing of some works for trombone, I was glad to be a part of this discussion that included David Taylor, Natalie Mannix (professor of trombone at University of North Texas and Chair of the ITA’s Advisory Council on Diversity), composer Noelia Escalzo (from Argentina), Rob Deemer (from The Institute for Composer Diversity), and moderator David Begnoche (two others, Tony Baker and Mayumi Shimizu were scheduled to be part of the panel but were unable to attend). This event, while part of the International Trombone Festival, was sponsored by TCU. We need to keep these important conversations going.\n\nROUNDTABLE DISCUSSION—TROMBONE RESEARCH\n\nBenny Sluchin, Simon Wills, and Douglas Yeo; Trombone Research Roundtable.

Friday, May 31, 2024.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, another thing that was important to David Begnoche was that the International Trombone Festival include a strong research component. While there are some scholars who are doing excellent research on the trombone—its instruments, music, manufacturing, pedagogy—the sad fact is that most “research” that students undertake is not research at all: it is compilation. We need better research about the trombone. Bringing together Benny Sluchin, Simon Wills, and me provided us with an opportunity to talk about the current state of trombone research and how we can test sources and improve and build our knowledge base about the trombone.\n\nAmong the things I did at the roundtable was provide attendees with two documents. The first is a 52 page list compiled by Bill Stanley, long-time trombone professor (now retired) at University of Colorado Boulder. His list includes doctoral projects relating to the trombone from 1941 to the present. You can find that list HERE. Students and other researchers: don’t duplicate these topics! The second document is one that I prepared that lists 50 research topics that are crying out to be investigated. For instance, it is incomprehensible to me that an enterprising doctoral student has never investigated trombone solo recordings before Arthur Pryor’s first recording in 1897. It’s never been done. Why not? You can find my list of research topics HERE.\n\nBenny and Simon’s insights were revelatory—I certainly learned as much from them as anyone in the room—and it was a pleasure to collaborate with them in this roundtable.\n\nRECITAL—TROMBONE CHAMBER MUSIC OF VACLAV NELHYBEL\n\nDouglas Yeo and Nathan Siler Recital: Trombone Chamber Music of Vaclav Nelhybel (2024 International Trombone Festival program). Friday, May 31, 2024.\n\nTrombonists of a certain age will remember the band music of Vaclav Nelhybel. The music of this Czech-American composer took the wind band world by storm in the 1960s and 1970s. Noted for its visceral, rhythmic, and dramatic effect, I could not get enough of Nelhybel’s music when I was in high school and college. In 1975, he came to Wheaton College for a residency and I followed him all over campus. As a result, we became friends and he wrote two pieces for me, Counterpoint No. 2 for bass trombone and percussion, and his Concerto for Bass Trombone.\n\nNathan Siler and Douglas Yeo performing Vaclav Nelhybel’s Interplays for two trombones. Van Cliburn Hall Room, 2024 International Trombone Festival, Texas Christian University. Friday, May 31, 2024.\n\nLast year, Nathan Siler, trombone professor at Eastern Kentucky University, asked if I would collaborate in a recital of Vaclav Nelhybel’s music for trombones at the 2023 ITF in Salt Lake City. Nathan had recently released a recording of some of Vaclav’s music for trombones and I had helped him with some insights about Vaclav and his music. But, since I was already attending the 2023 International Tuba Euphonium Conference last summer, I didn’t have time to go to the ITF in 2023 so I asked Nathan to circle back to me about the idea of the recital in 2024. He did, I agreed, and we gave a recital of some of Vaclav’s trombone music at TCU. In this we were assisted by Thomas Nixon, piano; Justin Cook (associate professor of trombone at University of Central Arkansas), trombone and conductor, and Sophia Lo, Nathan Grissett, and Kayla Liptak, percussion.\n\nThomas Nixon (piano), Douglas Yeo, Justin Cook (trombone and conductor), Nathan Siler, and Nathan Grissett, Kayla Liptak, and Sophia Lo, percussion. Van Cliburn Hall, 2024 International Trombone Festival, Texas Christian University. Friday, May 31, 2024.\n\nIt was such a joy to play a recital of Vaclav’s music at the ITF. His music is not as well known today as it once was, and this recital was an effort to bring his music back to the attention of trombonists. Nathan played Vaclav’s Suite for Trombone which was composed for Mark McDunn. I played Vaclav’s Concert Piece, a piece for flexible solo instrumentation. We also played his Interludes (duets) and Contrasts (trios, with Justin Cook) that were designed for young players but which present real challenges of intonation and ensemble. Our recital concluded with Concertato for tenor and bass trombone, in a reduction by the composer for piano and three percussion players from the original version for band. If the response of the audience was any indication, Vaclav Nelhybel’s music is once again on the rise, and I feel fortunate to have been a part in reviving his important compositional legacy.\n\nLEARNING SOMETHING—BENNY SLUCHIN\n\nBenny Sluchin’s presentation and recital (with Mikhail Malt). Van Cliburn Band Room and Van Cliburn Hall, 2024 International Trombone Festival, Texas Christian University. Thursday, May 30 and Friday, May 31, 2024.\n\nBenny Sluchin and I have been friends for many years and I have the utmost respect for him as a trombonist and scholar who is equally conversant in a wide range of musical styles, from Paris Conservatoire concours solos to electronic music. Benny, who, along with me, received the International Trombone Association 2024 Lifetime Achievement Award, has been helpful to me in many of my research projects, including my current project about Joannès Rochut.\n\nAt the Festival, Benny gave a presentation, “Open Forms in the Age of A.I., the case of Cage’s Solo for Sliding Trombone and Somax2,” and a recital, “The Trombone in the Electronic Era,” that included Jacob Druckman’s Animus I for trombone and tape and Jonathan Harvey’s Ricercare una melodia. Benny has premiered dozens of compositions for trombone with computer and other electronic accompaniment and his presentation and recital were revelatory. With his colleague, Mikhail Malt, at the computer, those in attendance were transfixed by a passionate presentation about the creation of this type of new music. Benny is at the forefront of people who are engaged in the presentation of this fascinating and important type of music. It was absolutely riveting to hear Benny talk about Keren by Iannis Xenakis (a piece that was written for Benny), and perform part of John Cage’s Solo for Sliding Trombone. I came away from Benny’s presentation and recital with a new appreciation for music for trombone and computer.\n\nLEARNING SOMETHING—SIMON WILLS AND THE CRAMER CHOIR\n\nThe Cramer Choir conducted by Simon Wills (2024 International Trombone Festival program). Saturday, June 1, 2024.\n\nSimon Wills is a musical everyman. Former trombonist with the Welsh National Opera, London Symphony Orchestra, and the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, he has also played with the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment and is one of the most highly respected exponents of contemporary music. Currently professor at the Guildhall School in London, Simon is also a gifted composer and for the 2024 ITF, Simon was the conductor of the Cramer Trombone Choir. This ensemble, formed annually at the International Trombone Festival in honor of longtime Florida State University trombone professor William Cramer, is made up of trombone professors from colleges and universities around the world.\n\nSimon Wills conducting the Cramer Choir in his One Is Down. Van Cliburn Hall, 2024 International Trombone Festival, Texas Christian University. Saturday, June 1, 2024.\n\nI have heard many performances by the Cramer choir over the years but I cannot remember a more engaging program, more dynamic leadership, and finer playing than I heard on Saturday afternoon. The decision to engage Simon as conductor was due to David Begnoche’s advocacy. With Simon’s vast experience as a conductor and trombonist, and the fact that he is a composer of many works for trombone ensemble, the choice of Simon to lead the Cramer choir was inspired. The players—24 of them—were superb, and the choir premiered Simon’s One is Down (which was dedicated to David Begnoche) for 24 trombones. I can hardly describe the piece—with its “angel choir” of four alto trombones, a mute group, a large group, and more. The word “engaging” only begins to describe this program, and the concert was met with thunderous applause.\n\nLEARNING SOMETHING—WYCLIFFE GORDON\n\nDouglas Yeo and Wycliffe Gordon. Van Cliburn Hall, 2024 International Trombone Festival, Texas Christian University. Friday, May 30, 2024.\n\nJazz trombonist Wycliffe Gordon, and I have been friends for 25 years. I first met Wycliffe when he was a member of the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra. The LCJO came to Tanglewood, the summer home of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and played a combined concert with the Boston Symphony on July 24, 1999. Wycliffe and I became fast friends and we’ve been sharing musical performances and life together ever since. We played together in an all-star big band of YAMAHA artists with Boston Brass at the Midwest Clinic in 2019, we played in the All-American Alumni Band (alumni of the McDonald’s All-American High School Band) for a concert in Columbus, Ohio, and Wycliffe came to Arizona State University to work with my students when I was teaching there. I was thrilled when I heard that David Begnoche wanted to have Wycliffe at the 2024 International Trombone Festival and Wycliffe agreed to come.\n\nWycliffe is my brother from another mother. We are very close friends and it is always a delight to be with him. Whether we are playing together or I’m enjoying him perform, Wycliffe always inspires me.\n\nWycliffe Gordon with Paul Lees (piano), Eric Hitt (bass), and Jaelyn Washington (drums). Van Cliburn Hall, 2024 International Trombone Festival, Texas Christian University. Saturday, June 1, 2024.\n\nI’ve heard Wycliffe perform many times—in a jazz band, with a jazz combo, accompanied by a jazz band or a symphony orchestra or a concert band or brass band. But I have to say this: Wycliffe’s performance at the Festival was the finest I have ever heard him play. Van Cliburn Hall was packed; you could not find an empty seat. Before the concert, I went backstage to talk with Wycliffe. From the conversation we had, I knew we were in for something really special. And special it was. Wycliffe played trombone and soprano trombone. He sang. He engaged with the audience. When he sang, “On the Sunny Side of the Street,” he gave all of us a message we needed to hear and, turning to me and pointing while he was singing—with a big smile on his face—he added a few words:\n\nWhy don’t you grab your coat, and your hat, baby,\n\nLeave your worries at the doorstep.\n\nJust direct your feet to the sunny side of the street.\n\nWell, can you hear that pitter-pat, when that happy tune is in your step,\n\nLife can be so sweet on that sunny side of the street.\n\nYou see, I used to walk in the shade, all of my blues on parade,\n\nBut now I’m not afraid, this rover crossed over.\n\nAnd if I never have a cent, I’ll be as rich as Rockefeller—AND DOUG YEO SITTIN’ OVER THERE!\n\nWith gold dust at my feet, on the sunny side of the street.\n\nThe audience laughed, and nobody laughed harder than me. But the message was great. We have choices in life. We can live a life on the shady side and drown ourselves in grievances, slights, and anger. Or we can walk on the sunny side, care about others, and make a positive difference in the world. Wycliffe reminded us of this. And when Wycliffe closed his program with “Just a Closer Walk with Thee” and “When the Saints Go Marchin’ In,” we heard a great jazz artist deliver another great message in a transcendent way.\n\nLEARNING SOMETHING—DAVID TAYLOR\n\nDouglas Yeo and David Taylor. Backstage of Van Cliburn Hall, 2024 International Trombone Festival, Texas Christian University. Saturday, June 1, 2024.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, I ordered the first copy of bass trombonist David Taylor’s first solo album, David Taylor Trombone. Weeks passed and I didn’t receive the LP so I wrote to David. He apologized for the delay, and said that the manufacturer didn’t get the color/contrast of the cover right and it had to be redone. Eventually I received the album. And that album changed me. That inauspicious introduction to each other led to a vibrant friendship. Dave Taylor is truly a legend in the trombone community. It’s hard to believe he’s 80 years old now—80 years YOUNG in his case—and whenever I’m around him, I feel energized. As David Begnoche said to me, Dave Taylor is “artistic penicillin” that pushes up against unimaginative, bland playing. To be around Dave is to be in the center of an artistic tornado.\n\nWorld premiere of David Taylor’s Tatanka Lyotanka (Chief Sitting Bull). David Taylor, Jeanette Velasco, Angel Subero, Joran Davenport, Douglas Yeo, David Begnoche (conductor). Van Cliburn Hall, 2024 International Trombone Festival, Texas Christian University. Saturday, June 1, 2024.\n\nDavid came to the ITF with a mission of creativity. And when he asked if I would take part in the premiere of his new piece, Tatanka Lyotanka (Chief Sitting Bull), for bass trombone solo with four bass trombone accompaniment, I was all in. It’s not possible to describe Dave’s recital at the Festival. His playing defies characterization—it is high, low, soft, loud, fast, slow, manic, calm, thought-provoking, and always consequential. I left David’s recital—that included his arrangement of Franz Schubert’s Der Doppelgänger with the TCU Trombone Choir, Eric Ewazen’s Dagon II for bass trombone solo and eight overdubbed bass trombones (with video), David Taylor’s Dance for bass trombone and talking metronome, and more—with my head spinning. When Dave asked the audience if we had any questions, Abbie Conant replied, after a long silence, “We’re overwhelmed.” Yes, we were. Dave Taylor’s musical tornado affected us all deeply.\n\nAfter David’s concert, I did not have the energy to hear the final jazz concert of the Festival; I needed to stop and collect my thoughts. Four days at TCU had profoundly changed me.\n\nRETURNING HOME\n\nAfter breakfast at the hotel with Dennis Bubert on Sunday morning and saying goodbye to several friends in the hotel lobby, I packed up and got back in my car. Fortified with Diet Coke, my trip home was much less eventful than my all-nighter drive to Texas. I split the trip over two days, eight hours of driving each day, and for those long hours, I didn’t listen to the radio and I didn’t listen to music. I used the time to reflect on what I had just experienced.\n\nREFLECTION AND THANKS\n\nAn event such as the International Trombone Festival does not just happen. It requires years of planning and many hands to pull it together. The three members of the International Trombone Association’s Standing Committee on the International Trombone Festival, Steven Wolfinbarger, Bradley Palmer, and Carol Jarvis, review applications for potential ITF sites and provide oversight over the Festival. The Festival’s salaried staff, Director Karen Marsten, Festival Manager Justin Cook, and Festival Assistant Manager Chris van Hof (and other ITF salaried staff including the ITF Youth Workshop Director, the ITF Composers Workshop Director, the ITF Digital Director, and the ITF Bookkeeper) along with other non-salaried, appointed ITF staff members, do a great deal of nuts and bolts planning and implementation to help ensure the success of the Festival. We are so very grateful for all of their hard work.\n\nBut it must be said that one person is at the heart of each International Trombone Festival: the Festival’s host. It is the host that provides the venue, typically a college or university. Hosts are not paid for their work for the ITF; this is a command performance of epic proportions. The Festival host needs to secure appropriate world-class performance spaces, spaces for presentations (with technology for Powerpoint video presentations and audio), dorm rooms for attendees, rooms for vendors, practice rooms for participants, rehearsal spaces for performers. And much more. All of this is done without financial compensation. This is often tricky business, navigating all of this with University administrators, securing music stands and chairs, arranging for percussion and electronic equipment. Student volunteers—without whom International Trombone Festivals simply could not be mounted—serve tirelessly to staff the information and registration desks, sell ITF gear, ensure that only registered individuals are admitted to performance halls, guide artists to rehearsal and performance spaces, staff the instrument check room, and so much more. They, also, are not paid for their work; they do it for the love of the trombone (and a t-shirt).\n\nI salute David Begnoche. When we started talking about the possibility of his hosting an International Trombone Festival, his document of dreams was something we talked about frequently. And when we look at the things that happened at this recently concluded Festival at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, we can thank David Begnoche for his vision. Long before he made his formal application to host the ITF, he was thinking. He wanted this Festival to be diverse. It was. Everyone noticed. He wanted this Festival to include new faces. It did. Everyone noticed. He wanted this Festival to recognize the depth of trombonists and scholars in the world beyond the “familiar faces” that so often appear at Festivals. It did. Everyone noticed. Looking back at David Begnoche’s 2020 ITF dream document, we can see how much of his original vision made it into the 2024 ITF as he passionately advocated for populating the Festival with many particular individuals and groups:\n\nSimon Wills\n\nBenny Sluchin\n\nDavid Taylor\n\nNatalie Cressman\n\nTrombones de Costa Rica\n\nAmerican Brass Quintet\n\nAmanda Stewart\n\nPeter Steiner\n\nAlex Iles\n\nMonarch Brass\n\nHakeem Bilal\n\nRonald Barron\n\nSasha Romero\n\nDavid Yacus\n\nDavid also wanted to showcase local artists, composers, and ensembles from Texas at the ITF, and they were:\n\nKevin Day\n\nQuinn Mason\n\nDallas Asian Winds\n\nCenter Stage Brass\n\nOf course, there were many people on David Begnoche’s dream list that did not or could not come to the festival for various reasons. You don’t get everything in life. In the years, months, and weeks after he made up his dream list for the International Trombone Festival, he continued advocating for diverse, transformational artists and presentations. He successfully led the effort to commission Kevin Day to write his new concerto for trombone and piano, Diversions, that was premiered by the Fort Worth Symphony with trombonist Peter Steiner and pianist Constanze Hochwartner. David Begnoche—personally—was the lead commissioner for Diversions, and the major portion of the commission was paid for by the Fort Worth Symphony, something that the International Trombone Association, with its limited financial resources, could not have done itself. He advocated for and ensured that the roundtable on diversity considerations in programming happened. It was David who reached out to Amanda Stewart and facilitated her participation in the Festival where she discussed the value of promoting a safe work environment. David brought early music and trombone research to the Festival in a big way. These things—and so much more—did not happen by accident. They came about due to David Begnoche’s vision and advocacy. Others worked alongside David—the ITA’s Standing Committee on the International Trombone Festival, the paid and unpaid ITF staff—and together, they collaborated mightily to put together the pool of teachers, presenters, and performers that made this the most consequential Festival in the ITF’s history. Gone are the years when the International Trombone Festival was a “good old boy” event. With ensembles and soloists who made up diverse genders, races, and nationalities, as well as players of trombones of every type, size, and shape who played music from the Renaissance up to the present, this International Trombone Festival set a standard for the future. As Abbie Conant said in a Facebook post on Wednesday, June 5, “Everyone had a great time at the ITF and there was a lot of great trombone playing. It was a lot of fun. It was also the most inclusive and diverse ITF ever.” Yes, it was.\n\nAnd in the midst of some truly dangerous and catastrophic weather events in Fort Worth and the surrounding area—rain, hail, wind, even tornadoes—that knocked out power, damaged personal and institutional property, forced some attendees to cancel or delay their trips, required juggling of schedules—the Festival is already being recognized as one of the most successful and impactful—and perhaps the MOST successful and impactful—in the International Trombone Association’s over 50 year history.\n\nA thought from a fortune cookie, sent by David Begnoche to Douglas Yeo. June 2, 2024.\n\nAs I was driving on the final leg of my trip home on Monday, David Begnoche sent me this snapshot of a thought in a fortune cookie. Anyone who was at the ITF and was paying attention—and I think EVERYONE was paying attention—would agree with this statement. New ideas were on display last week at the ITF and we were all changed.\n\nTo the ITA’s Standing Committee on the International Trombone Festival, the ITF paid and unpaid staff, the dozens of unpaid student workers, to the ITF’s Platinum Sponsor, S. E. Shires Co.; Gold Sponsor Greg Black Mouthpieces; Silver Sponsors Antoine Courtois and J. P. Rath; and Bronze Sponsors C. Sharpe Editions and YAMAHA Musical Instruments; and especially to Dr. David Begnoche, I extend my thanks for what we all experienced at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth. The approximately 1000 trombonists that attended the Festival and others who followed it through the Festival livestream left Fort Worth challenged, inspired, and energized.\n\nI don’t know about you, but I’m going to practice now. . ."
