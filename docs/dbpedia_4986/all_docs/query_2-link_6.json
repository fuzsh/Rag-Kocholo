        "text": "Nathan is primarily a male name widely used in Europe, especially France. The American Revolutionary War hero Nathan Hale or the biblical prophet Nathan who lived during the reigns of King David and King Solomon might have given this name a boost in popularity. Nathan might also be a Jewish short form of Nathaniel and Jonathan, as the meanings of these three names have something similar to “Gift of God” or “God has given.” Nathan was a prophet and one of King David’s sons in the Old Testament. He acted as a messenger to King David and is considered one of Jesus’ ancestors.\n\nWhat Does Nathan Mean?\n\nDerived from the Greek form of the Hebrew name Netan’el, Nathan means “God/El has given” or “Gift of God/El.” The meaning of Nathan is “He gave.” Similar ancient names are Nathaniel, with the same meaning as Elnathan and Jonathan, which signifies “YHWH has given.” So the meaning of Nathan refers to your child as a true gift implying God is the giver.\n\nOrigin\n\nNathan has a Jewish, English, and German origin derived from the Biblical Hebrew personal name Natan meaning ‘given by God.’ As per the early records, this name can be found in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) by Nethanel, son of Zuar, leader of the Tribe of Issachar, and Nathaniel’s New Testament Christian Bible an Apostle of Christ. Derived from the Hebrew verb meaning gave (standard Hebrew Natan, Yiddish Nussen or Nosson, Tiberian Hebrew Nāṯān). The meaning of the name in Jewish culture could be rendered “he has given” or “he will give.” The related name Elnathan could be rendered “Gift of El” (Hebrew God). It may be a Jewish short form of Jonathan or Nathaniel. The personal name was comparatively rare among non-Jews in the middle Ages, and as a modern surname, it is most frequently Jewish.\n\nGender\n\nMale\n\nPronunciation\n\nnay-th(an)\n\nNAY-thuhn\n\nSyllables\n\n2 Syllables\n\nLength/Letter\n\n6 letters\n\nName Variations/Spellings\n\nNathan name variations and other spelling of Nathan have crossed borders to become worthy contenders across various languages.
