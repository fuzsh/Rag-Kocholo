(NYSE: PLOW), North America’s premier manufacturer and upfitter of work truck attachments and equipment, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n\n“Our results improved across the board in the first quarter, when compared to the same period last year,” noted Bob McCormick, President, and CEO. “I want to congratulate our Work Truck Solutions teams for delivering an excellent quarter, as they continue to make progress towards their long-term growth and profitability goals. Despite experiencing the second winter in a row with significantly below average snowfall, our Attachments team made the best of the situation and delivered improved results compared to last year. We implemented our 2024 Cost Savings Program in January, to better align our cost structure with current market conditions. Given the deterioration in winter weather late in the season, we have expanded the program, with total annualized savings growing to $10 plus million.”\n\nConsolidated First Quarter 2024 Results\n\n$ in millions\n\n(except Margins & EPS) Q1 2024 Q1 2023 Net Sales $95.7 $82.5 Gross Profit Margin 19.8% 13.7% Loss from Operations $(6.4) $(13.8) Net Loss $(8.4) $(13.1) Diluted EPS $(0.37) $(0.58) $ in millions\n\n(except Margins & EPS) Q1 2024 Q1 2023 Adjusted EBITDA $1.5 ($7.4) Adjusted EBITDA Margin 1.6% (8.9%) Adjusted Net Loss $(6.5) $(12.5) Adjusted Diluted EPS $(0.29) $(0.55)\n\nYear over year improvement to net sales of 16.0% and gross profit of 67.3% were driven by higher volumes and price realization at the Work Truck Solutions segment, and higher parts and accessories volumes at the Work Truck Attachments segment.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased 4.3% to $21.5 million compared to first quarter 2023 primarily due to lower expenses from the successful implementation of the 2024 Cost Savings Program, which was partially offset by related severance costs.\n\nThe Company’s effective tax rate was 16.0% and 21.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and March 31, 2023, respectively.\n\nNet loss for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was ($8.4) million, compared to ($13.1) million for the corresponding period in 2023, an improvement of $4.7 million.\n\nWork Truck Attachments Segment First Quarter 2024 Results\n\n$ in millions\n\n(except Adjusted EBITDA Margin) Q1 2024 Q1 2023 Net Sales $23.8 $19.2 Adjusted EBITDA ($4.5) ($10.2) Adjusted EBITDA Margin (18.7%) (53.2%)\n\nWork Truck Attachments Net Sales, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margin all improved compared to the prior year despite ongoing weather issues.\n\nNet sales were $23.8 million for the quarter, an increase of 23.9% compared to first quarter 2023 and Adjusted EBITDA increased $5.7 million to ($4.5) million.\n\nThe improved results were driven by increased sales of parts and accessories compared to the same period in the prior year, as well as lower costs following the implementation of the 2024 Cost Savings Program.\n\nJanuary 2024 saw above average snowfall across many core markets, including east coast cities that saw the first measurable snowfall in 700 days, which led to record parts and accessories sales for the month of January. This data highlights the fact that when it snows, equipment gets used and needs to be repaired and replaced.\n\nMcCormick noted, “The overall lack of snowfall in our core markets over the past two seasons has clearly lengthened the equipment replacement cycle, which will undoubtedly negatively impact pre-season orders. Through carefully implemented cost controls, we will limit the impact on our bottom line wherever possible, while planning ahead for a return to more normal operating conditions in the years ahead.”\n\nWork Truck Solutions Segment First Quarter 2024 Results\n\n$ in millions\n\n(except Adjusted EBITDA Margin) Q1 2024 Q1 2023 Net Sales $71.8 $63.3 Adjusted EBITDA $6.0 $2.9 Adjusted EBITDA Margin 8.4% 4.5%\n\nWork Truck Solutions delivered significantly improved performance with Net Sales increasing 13.4% to $71.8 million compared to the same period last year, based on higher volumes, improved chassis availability, and increased price realization.\n\nFirst Quarter 2024 Adjusted EBITDA more than doubled to $6.0 million compared to the first quarter of 2023, based on higher volumes, price increase realization, and improved efficiencies.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA margin increased to 8.4%, its highest in any first quarter since 2019.\n\nMcCormick added, “Our teams at Dejana and Henderson are doing a terrific job improving baseline profitability by increasing the velocity of trucks flowing through our facilities. While supply chain issues linger in some areas of the business, the overall situation continues to stabilize and slowly improve, plus demand and backlog remain positive. We are very pleased with the progress in recent quarters, which is further proof when external conditions allow, our Solutions team can build momentum and deliver positive results.”\n\nDividend & Liquidity\n\nA quarterly cash dividend of $0.295 per share of the Company's common stock was paid on March 29, 2024, to stockholders of record on March 18, 2024.\n\nNet cash used in operating activities decreased 62.0% to $21.6 million in the first quarter 2024 primarily due to favorable changes in working capital, including a decrease in cash used in accounts payable and inventory.\n\nThe effective tax rates were 16.0% and 21.1% for the first quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nAmended Credit Facility\n\nAs previously reported, the Company amended its credit facility during the first quarter 2024 to provide greater financial flexibility by increasing the leverage ratio covenant from 3.5X to 4.0X at March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024, returning to 3.5X at September 30, 2024.\n\nThe Company’s leverage ratio at March 31, 2024 was 3.3X and the fees incurred in conjunction with the amendment were $0.3 million.\n\n2024 Outlook\n\n“As a direct result of recent unprecedented weather patterns, we are now seeing a lengthened equipment replacement cycle,” explained Sarah Lauber, Executive Vice President and CFO. “We are tightening our guidance range after the conclusion of the 2023-24 snow season and our careful monitoring of early pre-season orders. We will fully utilize our flexible manufacturing expertise to adjust our production to match demand, and also continue to make tough but necessary decisions to control our costs and defer investments to expand the 2024 Cost Savings Program. We have expanded the program, which is now expected to yield annual pre-tax savings of $10 plus million, with approximately $8 to $9 million of the anticipated annualized savings expected to be realized in 2024, which will help preserve our profitability and liquidity as much as possible.”\n\nLauber added, “The Solutions segment continues to have a positive outlook for the year and remains on track to deliver improved top and bottom-line full year results for the third year in a row. And finally, it is worth reiterating that the dividend remains our top capital allocation priority.”\n\nUpdated 2024 financial outlook:\n\nNet Sales are now expected to be between $600 million and $640 million, compared to the previous ranges of $600 to $660 million.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is now predicted to range from $70 million to $90 million, compared to the previous ranges of $70 to $100 million.\n\nAdjusted Earnings Per Share are now expected to be in the range of $1.20 per share to $1.70 per share compared to the previous ranges of $1.20 to $2.10.\n\nThe effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 24% to 25%.\n\nThe long-term financial targets for both segments remain intact:\n\nWork Truck Attachments:\n\nSales growth – low to mid-single digit percentages\n\nAdjusted EBITDA margin – mid to high 20%’s\n\nWork Truck Solutions:\n\nSales growth – mid to high-single digit percentages\n\nAdjusted EBITDA margin – double digit to low teens\n\nThe updated 2024 outlook and long-term financial targets assume the following:\n\nRelatively stable economic conditions.\n\nStable to slightly improving supply of chassis and components.\n\nCore markets will experience average snowfall in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nWith respect to the Company’s 2024 guidance, the Company is not able to provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP because it does not provide specific guidance for the various extraordinary, nonrecurring, or unusual charges and other certain items. These items have not yet occurred, are out of the Company’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. As a result, reconciliation of the non-GAAP guidance measures to GAAP is not available without unreasonable effort and the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information.\n\nEarnings Conference Call Information\n\nThe Company will host a conference call on Tuesday, April 30, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time (9:00 a.m. Central Time). To join the conference call, please dial 1-833-634-5024 domestically, or 1-412-902-4205 internationally.\n\nThe call will also be available via the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at www.douglasdynamics.com. For those who cannot listen to the live broadcast, replays will be available for one week following the call.\n\nAbout Douglas Dynamics\n\nHome to the most trusted brands in the industry, Douglas Dynamics is North America’s premier manufacturer and up-fitter of commercial work truck attachments and equipment. For more than 75 years, the Company has been innovating products that not only enable people to perform their jobs more efficiently and effectively, but also enable businesses to increase profitability. Through its proprietary Douglas Dynamics Management System (DDMS), the Company is committed to continuous improvement aimed at consistently producing the highest quality products, at industry-leading levels of service and delivery that ultimately drive shareholder value. The Douglas Dynamics portfolio of products and services is separated into two segments: First, the Work Truck Attachments segment, which includes commercial snow and ice control equipment sold under the FISHER®, SNOWEX® and WESTERN® brands. Second, the Work Truck Solutions segment, which includes the up-fit of market leading attachments and storage solutions under the HENDERSON® brand, and the DEJANA® brand and its related sub-brands.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThis press release contains financial information calculated other than in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). The non-GAAP measures used in this press release are Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share, and Free Cash Flow. The Company believes that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and other external users of its consolidated financial statements in evaluating the Company’s operating performance as compared to that of other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures can be found immediately following the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in this press release.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA represents net loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, as further adjusted for certain charges consisting of unrelated legal and consulting fees, stock-based compensation, severance, restructuring charges, and impairment charges. The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA in evaluating the Company’s operating performance because it provides the Company and its investors with additional tools to compare its operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect the Company’s core operations. The Company’s management also uses Adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes, including the preparation of its annual operating budget and financial projections, and to evaluate the Company’s ability to make certain payments, including dividends, in compliance with its senior credit facilities, which is determined based on a calculation of “Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA” that is substantially similar to Adjusted EBITDA.\n\nAdjusted Net Loss and Adjusted Loss Per Share (calculated on a diluted basis) represents net loss and loss per share (as defined by GAAP), excluding the impact of stock based compensation, severance, restructuring charges, impairment charges, certain charges related to unrelated legal fees and consulting fees, and adjustments on derivatives not classified as hedges, net of their income tax impact. Adjustments on derivatives not classified as hedges are non-cash and are related to overall financial market conditions; therefore, management believes such costs are unrelated to our business and are not representative of our results. Management believes that Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted Loss Per Share are useful in assessing the Company’s financial performance by eliminating expenses and income that are not reflective of the underlying business performance.\n\nFree Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures. Free Cash Flow should be evaluated in addition to, and not considered a substitute for, other financial measures such as Net Income and Net Cash Provided By (Used in) Operating Activities. We believe that free cash flow represents our ability to generate additional cash flow from our business operations.\n\nForward Looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
