        "text": "“Nathan” means different things to different people, but it is originally Hebrew for “gift” (actually “give”) or sometimes “gift from God” (specifically, Nathaniel) or “he who answers his parents’ prayers.”\n\nA Nathan is lost and his birthmother is looking for him. He was born Nathan Russel Daniel on August 26th, 1970. If you were born on this day and your name is Nathan, you might send email to Susan Harris and see if she’s your mother. If you bore a son named Nathan on June 23, 1987, Nathan Fausti wouldn’t mind hearing from you. If you bore a son in Little Rock, Arkansas on December 30, 1976, Nathan Leroy Anderson/Nathan Bradley Jones is looking for you. If you fathered a son named Nathan on May 5th, 1976, Nathan Anderson would like to hear from you.\n\nIf your name is Christopher Davies and you fathered a son in Wrexham, North Wales, he’d very much like to meet you: Nathan Roderick If you know anyone connected to the family of Nathan Lee Vickers, please contact him. Another Nathan writes a book: Finding the Open Road by Nathan Gebhard, Mike Marriner, and Brian McAllister. Want to fit in? Nathan Keay’s here to help.\n\nIf you’re a Nathan and you aren’t listed (and you want to be), send me email (but be sure to give me your email address or URL and your full name):"
