        "text": "I believe our best work happens when we are serving and giving expression to something greater than ourselves. This union of service and expression gets to the heart of what illustration is all about. It is beauty and utility, art and design, working hand in hand to both inspire us and call us to action towards a worthy cause.\n\nThrough my work, I hope to share with others in the beauty of creation and the joys of this life while also partnering with my clients in finding compelling solutions to their creative needs. All of this I do for the sake of my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. This faith and hope is the building block upon which all of my life and work is based.\n\nMultidisciplinary\n\nI once read that, in all good writing, style should reflect substance. I believe the same is true within illustration and design. The style of an illustration should always harmonize with the theme or idea that it is intended to convey.\n\nWorking within a wide range of disciplines has allowed me to communicate a variety of themes over the years. This has lead me to contribute to several markets through a variety of brands such as Nike, PepsiCo., REI, Bremont Watch Company, and Random House Publishing, among others."
