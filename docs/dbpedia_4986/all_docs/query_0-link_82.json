        "text": "The Oxford City AC triple-jumper has competed at the top level for almost two decades, winning eight British titles and qualifying for two Olympic Games.\n\nDouglas said previously this would be his last season before retiring, but the 39-year-old has now confirmed he will be ‘hanging up my jump spikes and saying my goodbyes’ in Manchester.\n\nREAD MORE: Nathan Douglas discusses retirement and his pride at wearing Oxford City AC vest\n\nThe men’s triple jump final is scheduled to take place at 1.02pm on Sunday, June 26.\n\nDouglas began training at Oxford City aged seven and was just 21 when he burst onto the scene to reach his first Olympics in 2004.\n\nHe jumped 16.84 metres at the Athens Games, but it was not enough to reach the final.\n\nDouglas won silver at the European outdoor and indoor championships in 2006 and 2007 respectively, setting a lifetime best of 17.47m at the latter competition.\n\nHe reached his second successive Olympics in 2008 and finished 20th in Beijing.\n\nDouglas was hampered by injuries during the 2010s but continued to compete at the top level in Britain, winning his eighth national title in 2020.\n\nIn February, he told the Oxford Mail he was targeting a fourth Commonwealth Games, with the 2022 edition starting next month in Birmingham – the city he is based."
