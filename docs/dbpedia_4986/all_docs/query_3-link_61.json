Implicit in our mission is our foundational commitment to supporting the success of young investigators in child health research through activities that include facilitating connections with peers, potential collaborators and national mentors.\n\nThe SPR Bridging to Success Award, a program initiated in 2016, supports transitioning pediatric physician-scientists and other researchers involved in pediatric research, who have submitted a K08, K23, AHRQ K08, CDC K01 (must be an MD), A0 or A1 grant, which although not funded, may be potentially competitive on resubmission (including a 3rd submission) to the NIH.\n\nThe support mechanism consists of $40,000 awarded to the sponsoring institution with no indirect costs. The sponsoring institution and Department match the $40,000, thereby constituting $80,000 of the awardee’s support for two years. Salary support is the preferred mechanism of support though alternative uses of awarded funds may be considered on a case-by-case basis if justification for the use of funds for non-salary-related costs (which must be provided by the awardee) is approved by the SPR Awards committee. In all cases, at least 75% protected research effort must be assured. The award does not allow for fringe or indirect costs and these costs should be covered by the institution from separate sources. The $40,000 from SPR will be disbursed in two installments: $20,000 the first year starting on July 1, and the second installment of $20,000 the following year on July 1, dependent on the K not being funded as of June 30th of that year.\n\nEligibility\n\nMD or MD/PhD applicant who is a SPR member or SPR junior section member (rolling admission for SPR junior section applicants is available).
