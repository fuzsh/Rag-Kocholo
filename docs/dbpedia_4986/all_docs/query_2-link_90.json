        "text": "Bitcoin is commonly thought to be the first cryptocurrency, but there were several attempts create digital currency before Bitcoin. The first cryptocurrency was eCash, developed by the company DigiCash in 1990. The concept and company were created by cryptographer David Chaum, who in 1983 published a paper titled \"Blind Signatures for Untraceable Payments.\"\n\nSeveral other attempts ultimately led up to Bitcoin's creation, but it took more than 20 years for cryptocurrency to evolve to its current state.\n\neCash—The First Cryptocurrency\n\nIn 1983, American cryptographer David Chaum proposed a form of electronic cash. He conceptualized a token currency that could be transferred between individuals safely and privately; the similarities to modern-day cryptocurrencies are striking.\n\nChaum developed a so-called \"blinding formula\" to be used to encrypt information passed between individuals. \"Blinded Cash\" could thus be safely transferred between individuals, bearing a signature of authenticity and the ability to be modified without traceability.\n\nChaum founded DigiCash to put his concept into practice several years later by creating the first cryptographic electronic money called eCash. Although DigiCash went bankrupt in 1998, the ideas the company put forward and some of its formulas and encryption tools played an important role in developing later digital currencies.\n\nE-Gold\n\nIn 1996, Dr. Douglas Jackson and Barry Downey created electronic money tied to gold's price. This digital currency allowed users to transfer ownership of gold between users of a website, which quickly—albeit unintentionally—became a tool for money launderers and others seeking anonymity in their illegal activities.\n\nBit Gold\n\nNick Szabo, one of the early cryptocurrency pioneers, is credited with creating some of the concepts that eventually led to the creation of Bitcoin. This concept was called Bit Gold and used many of the same blockchain techniques, such as a peer-to-peer network, mining, a ledger or registry, and cryptography.\n\nPerhaps the most revolutionary aspect of the Bit Gold concept had to do with its movement away from centralized status. Bit Gold aimed to avoid reliance on centralized currency distributors and authorities. Szabo's aim was for Bit Gold to reflect the properties of real gold, thereby enabling users to eliminate the middleman. Bit Gold, like other attempts, was ultimately unsuccessful. However, it too inspired digital currencies that would enter the market a decade or more after its introduction.\n\nB-Money\n\nIn 1998, an anonymous developer using the name Wei Dai proposed an \"anonymous, distributed electronic cash system\" called B-money. Dai suggested two different protocols, including one that required a broadcast channel that was both synchronous and unjammable. Ultimately, B-money was never successful and it differed from Bitcoin in many ways. Nonetheless, it was also an attempt at an anonymous, private, and secure electronic cash system.\n\nIn the B-money system, digital pseudonyms would be used to transfer currency through a decentralized network. The system even included a means for contract enforcement in-network without using a third party. Although Wei Dai proposed a whitepaper for B-money, it was ultimately unable to garner enough attention for a successful launch.\n\nHashcash\n\nDeveloped in the mid-1990s, Hashcash was one of the most successful pre-bitcoin digital currencies. Hashcash was designed for various purposes, including minimizing email spam and preventing DDoS attacks.\n\nHashcash opened up a wide array of possibilities that would only be realized nearly two decades later. Hashcash used a proof-of-work algorithm to aid the generation and distribution of new coins, much like many contemporary cryptocurrencies. Hashcash also ran into many of the same problems as today's cryptocurrencies; in 1997, facing an increased processing power need, Hashcash eventually became less and less effective.\n\nEven though it eventually fizzled out, Hashcash saw a significant degree of interest in its heyday. As a result, many of the elements of the Hashcash system worked their way into Bitcoin's development.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWhile Bitcoin is considered by many to be the first cryptocurrency, it was preceded by several attempts to create a form of digital currency. Many earlier attempts were referenced by Bitcoin's creator(s) in the whitepaper which brought it all to the public's attention in 2008."
