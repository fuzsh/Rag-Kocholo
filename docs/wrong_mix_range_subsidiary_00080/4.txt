Since incorporation it has been the policy of the management to confine its investments exclusively to foreign dollar bonds, 'despite the fact that the certificate of incorporation permits investment in all types of both foreign and domestic securities.;- The policy which was approved by the stockholders was to invest in all .types.of securities as permitted by the certificate .of incorporation. It may well be that in the future no actual change in our operations will occur. On the other hand,: due to the rapid changes in conditions and opportunities for investments, both foreign and domestic, caused by the war, it is im¬ possible for directors to predict the time or the precise form or the extent to which investment opportunities may become available in the future,: particularly in the post-war period., Foreign "securities other than bonds, and certain domestic securities may, upon occasion, seem most desirable for investment,, and the management felt that it was in the best interests of the shareholders that the company take advan¬ tage of such opportunities, without restrictions either as. to time, or as to the percentage of the company's portfolio which may be invested in any specific type of security. ^ y2\: y 2! 2/K"..

Operating •expenses increased $1,293,000, or 12%, and net operating revenues Increased by $365,000, or 6%. The war has caused sharply increased living costs and consequently higher expenses in practically every country in which the subsidiaries operate,, These conditions are reflected in the larger ratio of operat¬ ing expenses. Fortunately these increased expenses have thus far been more, than offset by greater business. , " '5 v The; American & Foreign Power Co. Inc. hopes to find more , and more local capital in each country for the expansion of its services, This expansion will provide additional opportunities for local investors to participate in the growth of the public utility industry/in the localities in which the subsidiaries operate. Since, however, the territory is largely new and undeveloped and. the financial markets of "many of these countries have not reached the point where they can supply the entire amount of capital required, it will be necessary to continue to obtain some part of this new money in countries possessing greater financial resources. If the essential flow of investment capital on a continuing basis is to be encouraged, the countries of Latin America must • do their part-by allowing the investors whose money builds up the national economy to earn an adequate and safe, return. ; The management of American & Foreign Power Co, Inc. s are believers in the future of Latin America and of its agriculture and industry. Their goal is to make ample and dependable power available wherever it can be' used advantageously, and thus con¬ tribute to the sound, economic growth of the territories served. They believe that increasingly efficient service must be supplied at the lowest rates consistent with sound business principles. Strength In these beliefs is based upon their confidence that the people , of the areas served will insist, in their own enlightened self-interest, that efficient utilities be treated fairly and that their stockholders be allowed a reasonable-return to their invested capital. 1 suspense—debits..1:—22( ♦$236,752 share—j.__—2r2i:2^—■ Earnings per 1942'. 1 ' t$152,010 1943 ' 1944 -!„!2-!2l!——2—_• v ♦$252,421 profit - Outstanding common shares-—^—2 332,219 ' 1,532,214 f 31—" "■ 2' 3 Months Ended: March Net Liabilities— and 10% 1,708,951 ,1. .,239,099 6,791,360 vi"1 '581,935 1; ocean, or * 267,357 Corp.—Earnings— American Safety Razor " i0,659,232 12,934.940 .1; Capital . as V. 159, p. 7291 ' _ wages $1,664,000, Arrearages ,, . . supplies.!.!—————2.2^—2-1 1: and preferred stock, both payable June 20 to holder? of made on "March 20, March'30 and June 21, 20,.and"pec.^^io,2$3.50 each.',.- • " , \ .
