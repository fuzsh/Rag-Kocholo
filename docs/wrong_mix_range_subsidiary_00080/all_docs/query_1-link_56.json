The award will be given in Orlando, Florida, at the Annual AAAAI meeting in March 2018.\n\nFrom the September/October 2017 Issue\n\nSend your news to class secretary Beth Burwell Griffiths or directly to the BAM at alumni_magazine@brown.edu.\n\nRev. Douglas Abbott writes: “Finally, I have retired for certain. I have gone through three retirements: once in 1999 from the New Canaan, Connecticut, public school system counseling high school students; once in 2003 from the Center for Hope in Darien, Connecticut, facilitating support groups and meditation for those with life-threatening illness; and once in 2015 from Wilton Congregational Church in Wilton, Connecticut, having been an ordained minister for 54 years. This is the intent of the Brown University charter: to produce graduates useful to society.”\n\nEmily Arnold McCully’s latest picture book, Caroline’s Comets, about the 19th-century astronomer Caroline Herschel, was published on Feb. 28 by Holiday House. Her next book is a novel about the son of Sacagawea and the origins of Manifest Destiny titled A Promising Life and was published on July 25. She and her wife, Elizabeth Diggs, are taking part in the final shoot for the film Mirette, based on her children’s book Mirette on the High Wire, in Perigueux, France.\n\nCarol Nolte performed in the 30th-anniversary celebration of the 92nd Street Y dance program alongside many notable choreographers. Carol continues to produce WestFest, an annual spring dance festival in New York City, which she founded in 2009. WestFest showcases the work of up to 20 innovative professional choreographers and occupies Carol’s entire winter in her West Village home. Summers are spent at her home in Taos, N. Mex.\n\nAnne Jacobson Schutte writes: “At the end of June 2016, I moved from Venice, Italy, to Chicago. I’m now living in a life-care retirement community. Chicago offers everything I’m interested in: opera, symphony, fine dining, and the superb Newberry Library, which enables me to carry on my research and writing projects.”\n\nArt Solomon writes: “My family recently relocated our second AA minor league baseball team, the Hartford Yard Goats, to a brand new stadium in downtown Hartford. In addition to bringing professional baseball to Connecticut’s capital city, we hope that the new stadium will serve as a catalyst for economic development.”\n\nFrom the July/August 2017 Issue\n\nSend your news to class secretary Beth Burwell Griffiths or directly to the BAM at alumni_magazine@brown.edu\n\nPrentiss De Jesus writes: “I continue researching the archaeology of Turkey and plan another trip there this year. My interest still centers on the ancient mining and metallurgical industry of the Bronze Age, but it is unwise to work with a limited scope, and I am drawn to other topics, such as warfare, food, trade, and mythology. I am still a ham radio operator (K4PDJ) and manage contacts far and wide in Europe, Asia, and South America. Otherwise, I spend joyous hours with my 20-month-old granddaughter, daughter of Sargon M. De Jesus ’07, ’08 ScM. She is learning French as her first language. My wife, Corinne, is a beekeeper and on occasion I assist her. We have enough honey now to keep us sweetened for at least two years.”\n\nHoward Van Lenten is looking for a copy of the program for the Under the Elms ceremony held in June 1961. If you have one, please e-mail Howard.\n\nPatricia Pinney Walker writes: “Bob and I have moved to a senior living place. Our son Brian has accepted a new job at the International Monetary Fund, so we are looking forward to seeing our granddaughters more often. Our son David is still in Florida and providing a wonderful home for our German Shepherd dog, who could not accompany us here.”\n\nFrom the May/June 2017 Issue\n\nSend your news to class secretary Beth Burwell Griffiths or directly to the BAM at alumni_magazine@brown.edu\n\nAnn Notarianni Dickson of Coventry, R.I., writes: “I retired as a process business analyst in January 2016. I immediately started cleaning out papers, and what a relief to start anew. In November I was re-elected for a second four-year term as a Coventry School Committee member. Life is good.”\n\nEllen Shaffer Meyer’s son, Matthew Meyer ’94, was elected Delaware’s New Castle County Executive on Nov. 8.\n\nJoseph D. Steinfield writes: “In 2014 we sold our house in Boston’s South End and downsized to a condominium in Keene, New Hampshire, while renting an apartment in South Boston. This year we gave up the apartment. I became a legal resident of Keene, and I joined a small Keene law firm on a part-time basis (while remaining affiliated with my firm in Boston). Now Virginia and I are upsizing in Keene, moving to a house across the street.”\n\nFrom the March/April 2017 Issue\n\nLast summer, Alice Guillemette Bransfield and her husband enjoyed a Columbia River cruise following the path of Lewis and Clark. Both are enjoying retirement but write, “Don’t know why so busy if retired?”\n\nMarjorie Gaysunas Pett writes: “I retired from the University of Utah last year and spent a most enjoyable seven weeks in Spain studying Spanish and acting as the ‘abuela’ for our university undergraduates. I am still involved with the university as a professor emerita, taking Spanish and French classes, and writing research grants related to cognitive disabilities, luckily not my own. Our family is well, the grandchildren are growing.”\n\nEllen Shaffer Meyer writes: “Matthew Meyer ’94 has been elected County Executive of New Castle County, Delaware. Matt’s biggest challenge was defeating an entrenched, longtime incumbent in the Sept. 13 Democratic primary, which local political analysts called the biggest political upset in Delaware in years. Starting the campaign in March with zero name recognition, Matt won 53 percent of the September primary vote. In the November contest, he was elected with 67 percent of the vote. Both Vice-President Joseph Biden and U.S. Senator Christopher Coons served in New Castle County government prior to becoming senators from Delaware.”\n\nFrom the January/February 2017 Issue\n\nNanine Henderson writes: “I’m still enjoying my family practice in Louisville, Kentucky, having decreased to part-time. I am traveling more and returned from a fantastic trip to the Galapagos. I was glad to see many classmates at our 55th reunion and look forward to our 60th.”\n\nWalt McCarthy writes: “We had a pretty good year. Along with our annual trip to Scotland, we made another to go to our granddaughter’s graduation from St. Andrews University. It was founded in 1414, so there was much pomp and circumstance. Clara is a full-time artist and has had several shows. I am still a volunteer on committees of nonprofits trying to raise money.”\n\nEllen Shaffer Meyer writes: “Jane Pett Semmel and I are looking forward to our annual winter getaway, this year to Sarasota, Florida, in early March. It’s a women-only week. We are always joined by a friend from our days as singletons in New York City in the early 1960s.”\n\nFrom the November/December 2016 Issue\n\nDouglas Abbott retired after 54 years in the ministry, 33 years as a high school counselor, and 20 years of counseling for the nonprofit Center for Hope. He writes: “I look upon retirement as a sabbatical. Pam and I are loving our time together as retirees.”\n\nAlice Guillemette Bransfield had a long recovery from a fractured right knee cap and left wrist.\n\nDave and JoAnne Rabold Connell ’64 participated in a multiclass reunion with six other couples during a brief Caribbean cruise in January. On board were Al Almonte ’62, Bill Feinberg ’63, Norbert and Karen Lauter Feinberg ’66 AM, Tom Generous ’63, Berge Gregian ’62, and Peter Papadopoulos ’62. Dave writes: “All except Karen were Rhode Island commuters involved with the now long-gone Plantations or West Houses. It was great to get away from the bitter cold and storms in the Northeast and reunite with old friends.”\n\nEllen Shaffer Meyer wrote after learning about the death of Dilys Winn, “She was one of a kind, and I have very fond memories of her.”\n\nEdward D. Rotmer writes: “Lorraine and I are spending our winter in Naples, Florida, as we have for most of the last 10 years. We have traveled to France and have taken a tour of the Canadian Rockies. I have fully retired from my second career as real estate director with Benny’s, a retail chain of 32 stores in New England. I now look forward to more time with our two granddaughters and more traveling.”\n\nSteve Sewall writes: “Sue and I celebrated our 50th anniversary in August with a five-week trip to Asia. We traveled to Papua New Guinea for nine days flying around on small planes. Then we went to Bali, where we renewed our vows, complete with saris and Balinese dancing girls and music. We then boarded a wooden sailing ship with six other couples and toured the small islands east of Bali and did some snorkeling. We flew to Java to view ancient Hindu and Buddhist temples and finally flew to Borneo and spent a few days in the jungle observing orangutans in their natural habitat. It was a trip of a lifetime. We also went on our annual bike trip with friends to Sweden and Denmark. Between trips I am continuing to enjoy practicing orthopedics and playing the violin. In addition to orchestra work, I am participating in more string quartet playing, having been inspired by three summers at the Wellesley College Chamber Music Workshop. My four grandchildren are all teenagers and so far show no interest in Brown. The oldest is a sophomore art student at the Ringling College of Art and Design in Sarasota, Florida.”\n\nFrom the May/June 2016 Issue\n\nElkan Abramowitz writes: “2015 was an incredible year for me. I spent the greater part of it in a courtroom defending the former chairman of Dewey & LeBoeuf in one of the most closely watched white-collar prosecutions of 2015. The trial ended with the district attorney recommending that the charges against my client be dismissed. On the tail of the trial’s success, I was recently honored by a number of publications and third-party directories. Highlights include being named Trial Lawyer of the Year by Benchmark Litigation, a White Collar Crime Trailblazer by the National Law Journal, and a Trial Ace by Law360.”\n\nFrom the March/April 2016 Issue\n\nClass secretary Beth Burwell Griffiths requests all class notes be e-mailed to her.\n\nPhil Askenase writes: “My wife, Marjorie, and I have moved to a continuum-of-care facility, Whitney Center, about a mile from our home of 40 years in Hamden, Connecticut, near Yale. There is a major group of Yale professor retirees and spouses from many fields, with great group activities, trips, entertainments, three eating venues, many lectures, movies, and member emphasis groups. I continue to work full-time, but no longer as chief of allergy and clinical immunology nor seeing patients directly at the Yale School of Medicine. I am now working exclusively on research involving intercellular communication by RNA-carrying nanovesicles called exosomes in allergy, immunology, and neurologic diseases, and in the similarly emerging field of Medical Darwinian Evolution.”\n\nWalt Brothers writes: “If our junk mail is any valid indicator, the fear of data mining destroying our privacy is greatly overrated. Recent junk includes invitations to join Netjets, quickie loans for people with poor credit, offers for a career in nursing, and scores of products we have never bought nor ever will.”\n\nB. Jane L. Parpart writes: “I am back in Canada after three years working for UMass Boston in a PhD program on global governance and human security. It has been very exciting. My husband, Tim Shaw, and I shared a professorship. We continue to work with our students despite being ‘retired.’ Working with graduate students and their research enriches our lives and hopefully helps them as well. Hope to make another reunion some year.”\n\nRichard H. Pohle writes: “I have been enjoying retirement, and keep busy with water meter issues in upcountry Maui, where the county has restricted development by not issuing meters very readily. Six of our eight grandchildren live on the East Coast: four girls in Short Hills, New Jersey, our youngest grandchildren; a girl, 7, and boy, 4, are in Silver Spring, Maryland. The other two are teenagers in Maui. My wife and I are hoping to be at the 55th reunion.”\n\nJoyce Reed ’65 A.M. writes: “On Sept. 26 I flew to Honolulu to give a presentation to the alumni group there—and what fun it was to be in the company of 35–40 Brown grads, many accompanied by spouses and a few by teenaged children interested in my topic: “Today’s Wild Ride in College Admission.” I was with Gail Lewis, a colleague in my company, College Goals, who is also the mother of two young women who are recent alums. Together, we had many perspectives to share, since I did grad and undergrad studies at Brown and spent 14 years in the administration, ‘retiring’ as an associate dean of the College in 2003, and two of my children are also alums. Gail and I both truly enjoyed the evening. There is something about Brown students/alums. . . . It’s so hard to put a finger on, but it certainly makes them/us comfortable with one another. These were dynamic, committed young people, involved in medicine, teaching, arts, law, and politics in Hawaii, accepting responsibilities and leadership just as we hope and expect of Brown grads. It was incredibly gratifying and a true pleasure, and made me think more positively about making the 5000-plus-mile trek back to our 55th.”\n\nRobert W. Schmid writes: “This was a travel year. We spent a week in New York City to see Broadway shows, took a two-week trip to Japan in April, spent June and July at a cottage on Long Island and then a week in Florida in late July. We then spent two weeks in August on a Viking River cruise from Moscow to St. Petersburg—our first cruise. We scheduled a tour to Costa Rica for two weeks in February. My wife, Liz, has her 50th reunion at Goucher College in April. She is class reunion chair. Then we attend my 55th in May. It’s great to be retired.”\n\nGrace Smith moved to Walnut Creek, Calif., to be closer to her family, which includes a grandson. He is almost 2 and lives in San Francisco. She writes: “This is a lovely city, and I am fortunate to be here. Fun times ahead.”\n\nGeorge Torrey writes: “My wife, Sydney, and I continue to be active in the American Macular Degeneration Foundation. We will spend this winter in Tucson, Arizona, and are looking forward to celebrating our 50th anniversary in the spring with a river cruise on the blue Danube.”\n\nBill Worthington writes that he was in Providence in April and shared a coffee with classmates Pete Hurley, Bill Lunnie, Howard Myers, and Jim Twaddell. “It was good to see them all looking so well. Looking forward to seeing everyone in May.”\n\nFrom the November/December 2015 Issue\n\nF. William Abbate writes: “I just returned from a tour of Sicily with 14 others, including Richard Long and his wife, Dale. Good food, good wine, good time had by all.”\n\nRobert Birch writes: “I work at Oppenheimer & Co. as an investment advisor. My wife, Genie, is a professor at Penn. Our two kids are graduates of Brown—classes of 1993 and 2004.”\n\nAnn Matteodo Dupre writes: “As I become firmly ensconced in my ‘septuagenarian nest,’ the pianistic horizon twinkles ever more brightly, and I am blessed with two sons and two ‘grands’ that broaden my activities greatly. Our family was recently depicted in a compendium of actual events leading to acculturation in America entitled Voices of Rhode Island’s Italian-Americans, made available by the Italian American Historical Society. It was an amazing honor for us (myself and my three older brothers being Brown grads!).”\n\nMorey Filler writes: “We headed for the Costa Brava in July to meet and spend time with our son, Scott ’91, and his family. Would love to see the names Elkan Abramowitz, Robert Echenberg, or Mike Davis popping up.… Memories.”\n\nRobert Finkel writes: “I retired from the Toledo Clinic in Ohio, about 10 years ago, and don’t regret my decision at all. I’ve even declined two invitations to resume my old position. My wife of 41 years, Judy, started teaching beginners’ dressage. Although I had anticipated traveling a lot, this hasn’t materialized, but I keep busy reading, working in the yard (weather permitting), and working with my computer. I am active and have taken leadership roles in the Torch Club of Toledo, a business and professional persons’ group, and the Archaeological Institute of America, Toledo Society. Eating lunch with friends at the Toledo Club and ‘working out’ at the Club’s fitness center help to fill in the day. Last November, Jon Veeder and his son Tom dropped by for a few days on their way home to Winnetka, Illinois. The next month Jon and his wife, Sally, visited on the way out East. Life is good. Our three children live in Toledo, which means we see them often. So far, health is good but clearly I’m not the youngster I was even five years ago.”\n\nDoug Hackett writes: “Last December and January I was in New Zealand visiting with my daughter Kyle Hackett Smith ’93 and her family. Later in January, after a ski club trip to Steamboat Springs, Colorado, I stopped in Boulder on the way home to visit with my other daughter, Nancy Hackett Harrison ’86. Reunions such as these are great, especially if you keep them in the family! In May, Susan and I went to Orlando, Florida, for a reunion with my former roommate Eldon Hiebert and with Fred Dupuis, who roomed across the hall from us in Archibald House. While together, we phoned Fred’s former roommate Dan Warner at his home in Indianapolis to catch up with him. We had a great time together and were nattily attired in our Brown 1961 ball caps. I’m glad to hear of our 55th reunion preparations and plan to attend. Thank you to those making the arrangements.”\n\nJonathan Kapstein was named president of the Press Club Brussels Europe at the end of March while a non-urgent search began for a European journalist who has the time and ability to take over. Jon writes: “Nancy Sherer Kapstein and I were in New York in April, hunting for a pied-a-terre or a larger apartment. We ran into an unexpected roadblock in Bank of America’s blanket refusal to provide domestic U.S. mortgages for Americans overseas.”\n\nFrom the March/April 2015 Issue\n\nBarbara Spiezio reports: “After attending our 50th reunion in 2011 and that of Nick Spiezio ’63 in 2013, I was inspired to work with the alumni office to organize a get together of West House women from the classes of 1950 through 1970. I’m happy to say that as part of the 2015 Commencement Weekend, we will gather on May 22 at the Faculty Club to celebrate the 20 years that West House provided a home on the Pembroke campus for so many of us.” For more information contact Barbara Spiezio.\n\nFrom the September/October 2014 Issue\n\nRobert D. Kaplan writes: “I retired from law practice in Seattle and now live in Jacksonville, Ore. Southern Oregon is wonderful, with great opportunities for outdoor activities and cultural events. I have been whitewater rafting on the Rogue River, zip-lining, paragliding, trail walking in the Cascade Mountains, playing golf, and attending classical music concerts and Shakespeare festival performances in nearby Ashland. Each year I take one or two vacation trips (how do you vacation when you’re retired?), which this year included a trip to the U.S. and Canadian Rockies in July and an upcoming visit to southern California in January. Next year is Eastern Europe and the Grand Canyon.”\n\nFrom the July/August 2014 Issue\n\nDouglas W. Abbott writes: “Pam and I continue to be as active as ever keeping in touch with family and friends and eight grandchildren and doctor and dentist appointments with travels in between to Brazil and the Galapagos Islands and closer trips to Florida, Texas, New Hampshire, Maine, and New York City. I retired from 33 years of secondary school counseling in 1999, and from counseling people with life-threatening illness four years later. And now I’m working part-time as an assistant minister at the Wilton Congregational Church in Wilton, Connecticut, doing pastoral work. I am forever grateful for my experiences at Brown that greatly influenced my choosing to become a minister. Through the religious studies department and the campus chaplaincy, I went on to theological school and now am in my 50th year of ordination—50 gratifying years of service.”\n\nJeffrey A. Belkin writes: “After decades of practicing traditional labor management law, I gave up my clients in order to work exclusively in arbitration and mediation of labor and employment disputes. I am happy to report that in October I was inducted into the National Academy of Arbitrators.”\n\nForrest Broman is still raising funds and serving as board chair for the COHP (Children of Haiti Project) School started in 2010. It provides daily food, education, and medical services to nearly 80 tent-camp children who otherwise would have had no schooling and little food. He writes: “Please visit COHP at childrenofhaitiproject.org. Check the blog, and please contribute if you can. Thank you.”\n\nWalter R. Brothers writes: “In September, Sue and I checked off another bucket-list item—Ireland. We spent two weeks touring on our own. The countryside and cities were delightful, and the people were wonderful. The narrow, roller-coaster roads kept us fully awake, especially when a tour bus approached, taking all of its lane and most of ours!”\n\nRichard A. Considine writes: “Well, we finally did it! We have downsized to a 1600-square-foot ranch-style home in an over-55 community and are very happy with it, especially since I no longer have to cut an acre of grass or to plow a long driveway in the winter. We still have the cottage in Ireland and will be going there for three weeks in early November. I hate to miss Mel Blake’s ‘do’ this year. That is a great get together—thanks, Mel. I am substitute teaching at two middle schools and the high school in Hampton, New Hampshire, and enjoy it very much. Our two sons, John ’88 and David, are happily married and live nearby so we can see our grandkids on a regular basis, often as babysitters for Kyle, 10; Josie, 9; and Connor, 8. Life is good!”\n\nElizabeth Diggs’s play Grant & Twain premiered at Salt Lake Acting Co. in February and ran through Mar. 2. Liz lives in Chatham, N.Y.\n\nI. Lynn Evans writes: “I moved out of the retirement community (Villa de San Antonio) to a house I purchased to live with my middle son, Chris Cooper; his wife; and three children. Glad to have my own space again and thankful to be able to do so. Will try to see you all in 2016. Moving is not for sissies.”\n\nMorey Filler writes that he is not retired from the world of gynecology quite yet. He was looking forward to skiing in Colorado with grandchildren over the holidays, and says, “You know we can’t keep up with them.”\n\nJudy Grimes writes: “My husband, Bill Grimes ’59, published his book, The History of Big Safari. It is available on Amazon. It is the history of the military organization formed in the late 1950s and includes the U-2 aircraft and the SR71 Blackbird. Check it out!!”\n\nJohn A. Knutson writes: “Both Margaret and I continue our full-time effort to elect Democrats here in Maine. A major part of that between now and November 2014 is to elect a new governor and hold our majorities in the State House and Senate.”\n\nAldie Nordquist Laird and her husband, Lindsay, celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary with their whole family in attendance. Aldie lives in Harpswell, Me.\n\nWalter McCarthy writes: “Not much new. Clara and I made our annual trip to Scotland and had a very good time. We also spend a week each year in the Boundary Waters Canoe area in northern Minnesota. We have a condo on Lake Superior that we don’t get to often enough. The five granddaughters are doing well. One is at St. Andrews University in Scotland. She was recently in Hong Kong and survived the typhoon. The others are in elementary, middle, and high schools.” Walt lives in Long Lake, Minn.\n\nCourtland L. Munroe wrote that, after Northwestern Univ. Medical School, U.S. Navy service, and residency in internal medicine at the U.S. Naval Hospital in Portsmouth, Va., he moved to Carbondale, Ill., in 1973. In 2004, after 31 years, he closed his internal medicine/geriatrics office, resigned as clinical associate professor of medicine at Southern Illinois Univ. School of Medicine, and moved to The Villages in central Florida. Due to the need for geriatric physicians in Florida, he obtained his Florida medical license, and works one and a half days a week with a local Harvard Medical–trained internist and one day a week at a free clinic caring for homeless and uninsured working poor. He and his wife, Mary Lou, are planning a gala 50th wedding anniversary, most likely in Rome and Venice. They have four children and eight grandchildren. He looks forward to the 55th in 2016.\n\nRosalind Pace and Marcia Solomon Simon will be teaching “Image-Making: Discover Your Voice and Vision—Create a Book” July 28–Aug. 1 at the Provincetown Art Association and Museum. Rosalind writes: “We invented this workshop 40 years ago and have been teaching it every summer. The workshop explores book design, poem making, letter design, mono-printing, and collage through a series of parallel visual and verbal activities, and participants discover their own unique imagery as they create a handmade book in the space of each page and the sequence of time. The workshop is about putting together the surprising and unexpected into a coherent whole. We continue to be inspired by Image-Making ourselves in our own professions, myself as poet, artist, and teacher, and Marcia as a writer, social worker, and therapist. This summer, Image-Making will be part of the 100th anniversary celebration of the Provincetown Art Association & Museum as a showplace for the oldest continuous art colony in America. For more information go to www.paam.org/summer2014.”\n\nRonald Schnitzler writes: “After 35 years of college teaching as a professor of human behavior, I am finally enjoying visiting my wife’s family in Germany and South Africa.” Ronald lives in Longmeadow, Mass.\n\nArt Solomon published Making It in the Minors: An Owner’s Lessons in the Business of Baseball. He writes: “I’m very pleased with the early reviews; for example, the President of the Toronto Blue Jays, Paul Beeston, wrote, ‘If you liked Moneyball, you’ll like Art Solomon’s book since it tells the equally interesting behind-the-scenes story of the other side, the business side.’ It’s available through Amazon or Barnes & Noble. All profits from book sales go to Minor League Baseball charities.”\n\nJon Veeder writes that he doesn’t have grandchildren yet and is enjoying retirement and spending time with friends while traveling, including Mark Foster and his wife. Jon has spent some time in Arizona.\n\nFrom the May/June 2014 Issue\n\nEllen Shaffer Meyer published a novella, It’s All About Kate: A Sketch About Retirement, the humorous tale of a frisky retiree, available in print or as an e-book at Amazon.com . She writes: “Spoiler alert: There are no vampires. I hope my classmates are also checking items off their bucket lists.”\n\nEdmund Schaffzin will celebrate 50 years as an attorney this year. He writes: “I enjoy the life I have made for myself. I am married with children—Tracy Schaffzin ’86 and Nick (Stanford ’90)— and six grandchildren. I had dinner with Arthur Anderson, my roommate at Brown, and Anthony Vaida.”\n\nJoe Steinfield’s book, Claremont Boy: My New Hampshire Roots and the Gift of Memory, published by Bauhan Publishing, Peterborough, N.H., is a “partial memoir” containing essays Joe has published in the Monadnock Ledger-Transcript over the last several years. Emily Arnold McCully contributed a blurb for the back cover.\n\nFrom the March/April 2014 Issue\n\nWilson Brown and Jennifer S. H. Brown ’62 moved from Winnipeg, Manitoba, to Denver in 2011, after retiring from the Univ. of Winnipeg. Wilson writes: “Our son, Matthew H. Brown ’86, and his wife, Elizabeth M. Montgomery ’86, ’87 MAT, live near us and enticed us to settle here. Our first post-retirement project was to complete work on a long-simmering manuscript on an intriguing figure in Jennifer’s ancestry, Connecticut-born William Marsh. Marsh was an early settler of Vermont, became a colonel in the extra-legal Green Mountain Boys, and was key to the foundation of the state. He changed sides, however, and became an intelligence officer for the British. Colonel William Marsh, Vermont Patriot and Loyalist came out in late October and is available on Amazon. We published it ourselves (Tiger Rock Press), using CreateSpace. Col. Marsh was the fourth-great-grandfather of Jennifer’s father, Harcourt Brown, who taught at Brown from 1937 to 1969.
