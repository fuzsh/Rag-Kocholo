        "text": "Nashua's Railroads Past and Present\n\nThe first railroad to be constructed in New Hampshire was the Nashua & Lowell Railroad, extending Massachusetts's first railroad between Boston and Lowell. By train, goods could now travel between the mill cities and down to Boston in under an hour, rather than the day it took to travel by horse-drawn wagon or canal. Besides being faster, railroads provided reliable year-round service as canals would freeze during the winter and stagecoach paths would become muddy and be nearly impassible during spring thaws.\n\nAs technology improved from the first trains of the 1830s, trains were able to haul more people and goods faster and farther - but so did other modes of transportation. As the car and truck industry developed along with the railroads, and highways were built parallel to most railroad routes, the short distances between communities in New England lent itself to trucking and personal automobiles being the economical choice. Today, the railroad network in New Hampshire is a fraction of what it once was, but it still does what it was built for well - moving bulk commodities and products long distances efficiently.\n\nNashua's Street Railways\n\nBefore buses connected the edges of our communities, trolley cars rattled down our main streets, connecting home with work, school, and play.\n\nAll Railroads and Street Railways\n\nRailroads :: Connecticut • Maine • Massachusetts • New Hampshire • New York • Rhode Island • Vermont\n\nHeritage Railroads • Street Railways & Public Transit • Railroad Holding Companies • Government\n\nRailroads of Connecticut\n\nTo the Top\n\nRailroads of Maine\n\nTo the Top\n\nRailroads of Massachusetts\n\nTo the Top\n\nRailroads of New Hampshire\n\nTo the Top\n\nRailroads of New York\n\nRailroads listed for New York state are focused on those related to the Boston & Albany, Boston & Maine, Delaware & Hudson, New Haven, and Rutland Railroads.\n\nTo the Top\n\nRailroads of Rhode Island\n\nTo the Top\n\nRailroads of Vermont\n\nTo the Top\n\nHeritage Railroads\n\nConnecticut\n\nMaine\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nRhode Island\n\nVermont\n\nTo the Top\n\nStreet Railways & Public Transit\n\nThe companies and agencies listed here primarily focus on those that served New Hampshire and those merged into New England's major railroads.\n\nConnecticut\n\nMaine\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nRhode Island\n\nVermont\n\nTo the Top\n\nRailroad Holding Companies\n\nTo the Top\n\nState Governments & Railroad-related Agencies and Departments"
