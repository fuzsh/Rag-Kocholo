        "text": "This column will write itself since I attended the spectacular Park City, Utah, mini-reunion in March. But first, a report on one of those Dartmouth love-fests that happens because, well, Dartmouth is weird and special.\n\nIn 2022 John Nicholson and I were both in Hanover celebrating Tee Lotson’s Dartmouth Alumni Award. There were about 12 ’82s toasting Tee and over drinks at the Hanover Inn afterwards John mentioned Gary Levine’s class of ’19 daughter was considering the Indiana University Maurer School of Law. Would I mind talking to her? I live in Bloomington and graduated from Maurer (as did Sam Laurin and Ernest Brewer). Of course I would talk to her. Emily Levine soon called and we talked for an hour—at least. We both sang in a cappella groups. Need we say more? The upshot: Emily signed up for Maurer and then signed up in year two for the same O’Neill School joint J.D./M.P.A. degree I did. We meet for coffee once or twice a semester, she joined our kids and us for Thanksgiving dinner at a local Indian restaurant, and I ran into Emily and her visiting mother, Cathy Sneider Levine, walking in a Bloomington park one evening. I finally got to meet the charming Levine parents again at reunion! Mentoring the next generation—part of the D pact.\n\nNow to Park City. Listing attendees may take the rest of my word limit. Huge thanks to Mike Berg for organizing an amazing event that went off without a hitch. And huge thanks to Mike Sapers and wife Marci, Dana Burroughs Klinges and husband Dave Klinges ’79, and Kristin Farrish Shaw and husband Tiger Shaw ’85 for hosting all of us on three successive nights for delicious dinners at their beautiful homes. Mike Sapers also served as a ski guide, along with Eric Einhorn.Other ’82 attendees included Lee Apgar, Kathy Briscoe and Pete Folger, Dave Britton, Susan Burkhardt, Alison Schmults Burns, Ian Campbell, Brad Carpenter, Kelly Dixon Cooper, Tom Daniels, Vaune Dugan, Rosi Dupre Littlefield, David Eichman, Peter Feer, Martha Hill Gaskill, Dan Gilman, Cathy Judd-Stein, Betsy Leggat, Peter Moran, Sherri Carroll Oberg, Howard Tung, Beth Haffenreffer Scholle, Malcolm Robinson, Gail Sullivan, and Libbet Waterman McKeon. There were also spouses, partners, and friends who added wonderfully to the festivities, for 49 total (31 classmates, 18 guests). The weather was perfect, the snow excellent, and I am incredibly impressed at how many good skiers we have among us—and we’re still braving the slopes. May we continue into our 80s and beyond.\n\nThere will be more in future communiques about our ’82 class celebrations of the 82nd day of 2024, which just wrapped as I write. There were lots of Zooms and in-person events that were really fun! Everyone wants to do more of it and sooner rather than later.\n\nAnd a final sad note that we lost another classmate, Lisa Greeley. Look for an alumni magazine obituary in the coming weeks. Our deepest sympathies to her family and friends.\n\n—Philippa M. Guthrie, 2303 Woodstock Place, Bloomington, IN 47401; (812) 325-7512; philippaguthrie@yahoo.com; David Eichman, 9004 Wonderland Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90046; dme4law@sbcglobal.net\n\nIt is hard for me to picture a world without a Matt Yee singing. Most of you know that Matt died on December 2, 2023, after a courageous battle with liver cancer. As his husband, Paul, shared on CaringBridge: “Matt enthusiastically embraced life during his final year and cherished sharing his joys and setbacks with a circle of family and friends that was so dear to him.” I imagine that Matt has taken over all of the musical arrangements in heaven.\n\nTo honor Matt, I thought I would check in with classmates who live in the Aloha state. The list includes Mary Alexander, Lisa Davidson, Leslie Fleming, J.B. Friday, Katie Stearns Friday, Darryl Kan, LaMont LaMotteo, Jim Steiner, Dianne Vogel Boucher, and Tim von Herrmann.\n\nMary Alexander writes: “I’ve lived on Kaua’i since 1990, when I was hired to teach writing and literature at this island’s community college. My job has challenged me, as many of the students come from families in which English is not the first language and many live below the poverty level. One of my greatest joys has been to introduce students to writers from their own cultural and ethnic backgrounds and (I hope) inspire them to share their voices as well.”\n\nDianne Vogel Boucher has lived on the Big Island since 2010. “I was attracted by its elemental beauty, wonderful weather, and the opportunity for water sports. Since then the island has given me an appreciation for those things and so much more. I met my husband, Marc, shortly after I arrived. Together we have built a life filled with a range of outdoor activities. I have learned much about the Hawaiian culture and its history, which has inspired me to begin creating Hawaiian-themed custom rugs and other textile-based artworks.”\n\nLeslie Fleming grew up on Oahu and often visited Maui, where her grandparents on both sides lived. She attended the Punahou School (along with Matt and Jim Steiner and someone named Barack Obama). Leslie adds: “My husband and I both commute to Honolulu for work on a highway that goes up mountains, through tunnels and a beautiful rain forest that often has waterfalls. Returning to Hawaii as an adult I have been revisiting and rediscovering Hawaiian history and culture and re-thinking its challenges.”\n\nFinally, J.B. Friday shares the following: “Here in Hawaii our native birds go away during the summer, not winter. Every spring I go down to the shoreline to see the kolea (plovers), akekeke (turnstones), and ulili (tattlers) put on their breeding plumage. The plovers have their little black-and-gold tuxedos, and the turnstones are decked out in mottled russet and inky black. Then one day, they are gone. We will next see them coming in, one by one, in late summer as they come home from their summer breeding grounds in Alaska.”\n\nI’ll close with an example of synchronicity. Cindy Willett Sherwood lives in Williamsburg, Virginia—about a mile away from Becki Ambrose’s mother. Becki lives in Davis, California, where Cindy grew up and where Cindy’s parents still live. And their mothers share a birthday….\n\n—David Eichman, 9004 Wonderland Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90046; dme4law@sbcglobal.net; Philippa M. Guthrie, 2303 Woodstock Place, Bloomington, IN 47401; (812) 325-7512; philippaguthrie@yahoo.com\n\nThere are still things to say about reunion encounters, and so many ’82s I didn’t have time with. Knowing this would happen, I actually made some appointments.\n\nKate Pesek Roski and I met at the class tent amid rain and the lunch rush. Kate and husband Dudley met when living in the same Brooklyn brownstone in the 1980s. They reconnected and married three years ago. They have three sons: Arthur, philosophy student in N.Y.C.; Charlie, cybersecurity consultant in Chicago; and Henry, also Chicago, a mergers-and-acquisitions advisor at an investment bank. Henry is engaged and will marry in August. Dudley is retired and Kate semi-retired, mentoring early-stage and advising green tech companies and committed to helping the planet through science, land preservation, education, and technology. They enjoy golf and nature, living mostly in Naples, Florida, and summering in San Francisco.\n\nNext, were freshmen Gile roommates Jim Morrison and Tim Geibel. I cherish the memory of sitting in their room in an oddly familiar chair covered in an Indian bedspread. “New chair?” Um, yeah. “Nice. I think I’ve sat in it before.” The chair was back in the North Mass commons room the next morning. All grown up and presumably no longer borrowing furniture, Jim and wife Sally retired to the Berkshires after Jim’s career in insurance moved them all over the country. Jim manages their seven acres and Sally runs the Episcopal church office and is a fiber artist, specifically felted wool landscapes and stilllifes. They have three children: Katy, a Louisville Zoo animal ambassador; Alice ’14, running an Oregon nonprofit that develops state policy for family farms; and Nate in Denver, who runs 48-mile races and is an electrical engineer working in high-voltage architecture. Is that buildings with illuminated walls? That Jim has children who like snakes, farms, and distance running amazes him. And me, frankly.\n\nTim Geibel and wife Kay live in Acworth, Georgia, near Atlanta. He’s a principal solution architect with Dragonfly Financial Technologies digital banking company; she is in admissions at Georgia Highlands College. Daughter Abby is the office manager for an Acworth HVAC company. Son Mike is head rugby coach at Wheeling University, where he has led them to 10 Division I rankings the last three to four years. They have a number of dogs that Tim often takes hiking at Kennesaw Mountain National Park.\n\nFinally, I just returned from a Dartmouth alumni trip to South Africa. Carol Davis, sister Leslie Dahl ’84, and Cheryl Bascomb were fellow travelers. The fabulous Dartmouth professor Jeremy DeSilva allowed us unique access to sites where he has helped identify early hominid skeletons. We also had a safari, great food and wine, and a wonderful, enlightening time. Check out alumni trips. This was our second—we’re hooked. After a 36-hour return, husband Alex and I crashed. Cheryl, however, went to a party the next night at Kathy Briscoe’s with Vaune Dugan, Gray Horan, Sherri Oberg, Cathy Judd-Stein, and Pete Folger. As Leslie said, “Impressive rally, Cheryl.” Indeed. I’m obviously a lazy putz.\n\n—Philippa M. Guthrie, 2303 Woodstock Place, Bloomington, IN 47401; (812) 325-7512; philippaguthrie @yahoo.com; David Eichman, 9004 Wonderland Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90046; dme4law@sbcglobal.net\n\nOne of the best things about serving as co-secretary of our amazing class is learning all of the fascinating stories about other classmates and their parents. When I sent a condolence card to Seth Swirsky a few months ago in connection with the death of his father, Stephen ’63, I had no idea of the journey I would take with Seth and his mother, Joan. Seth was born while his father was in his sophomore year, which means Seth probably wins the award for having the youngest father in the class. Seth then sent me a copy of his father’s Pi Lambda Phi photo which included toddler Seth as the fraternity mascot. Do we have any other classmates who were fraternity mascots? Joan shared insights with me about being one of the only women on campus in the early 1960s and how she ended up on the cover of Dartmouth Alumni Magazine during one Winter Carnival.\n\nNext up was the revelation by Sam Carlson that his mother had dated Captain Kangaroo, whose real name was Bob Keeshan. The show first aired on October 3, 1955, which is why October 3 is designated as Captain Kangaroo Day. October 3 is Sam’s birthday. Coincidence? Thanks to Jenny Chandler Hauge for her creative birthday emails, which elicited this discovery.\n\nBut the classmate with the biggest TV star father has to be Steve Avruch, whose father, Frank, was the Boston TV host who played Bozo the Clown from 1959 to 1970. As Bozo, Frank toured the world performing for UNICEF and received an award from the United Nations for his work with children.\n\nCongratulations to our youngest classmate Tee Lotson on her appointment as a hearing officer with the New York City Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings. Tee will conduct settlement conferences and due process hearings for students with disabilities when a parent or guardian and a school district have a disagreement about the identification, evaluation, or placement of a student with a disability.\n\nThere were many gatherings of ’82s during the past few months, including in Hanover for the inauguration of President Sian Leah Beilock, in Boston for the Head of the Charles crew races, and again in Hanover for Homecoming Weekend, which included a reception at the John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding, but I have no more space….\n\nSteve Gendler, husband of our deceased classmate Sally Adnopoz Gendler, asked me to thank all classmates who donated funds to Dartmouth and other organizations in memory of Sally.\n\nI will close this column with the sad news that Winky Stearns Hussey died in October of a heart attack while bicycling in Europe. Our deepest condolences to her husband, Peter, and children Luke, Duncan, and Clarkie.\n\nFinally, to Jay Rosenberg, Ita Olesker, Jay Shofet, and Bruce Zev Weissberg and other classmates currently living in Israel: We are thinking of you and holding you close in our hearts.\n\nWhere did the year 2023 go?\n\n—David Eichman, 9004 Wonderland Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90046; dme4law@sbcglobal.net; Philippa M. Guthrie, 2303 Woodstock Place, Bloomington, IN 47401; (812) 325-7512; philippaguthrie@yahoo.com\n\nThank you for electing me co-class secretary. It was a nail biter given I had no opponent. Jenny Chandler is a very hard act to follow, but I’m so grateful she’s agreed to continue helping David Eichman and me with outreach.\n\nThere’s reunion fodder for several columns, so buckle up! We’re on the rental car shuttle from Logan Airport. At the stop, I stand up and glance right. “Philippa Guthrie?” “Hank Malin?” We’d been sitting adjacent for 10 minutes unawares. Hank “retired” from running Denison’s career center in 2022 and now has his own coaching business. He and his wife have two grown boys.\n\nThere was a mess of people at the Moosilauke overnight and others showed up for the next day hike to the peak. Either way I know Matt Hoffman, Mike Berg, Mark Bunker and Sheryl Bunker, Joe Reinkemeyer, Tom Daniels, Meg Huffman, Dave Plekenpol, Beth Haffenreffer Scholle, Carol Davis, Kathy Boak, Brian Herrle, Libbet Waterman McKeon, Peter Feer, Woody Kingman, JB and Katie Stearns Friday, Sherry Carroll Oberg, Kate Pesek Roski, Steve Burnham, Alex Blumrosen, Sue Elliot and Eric Christensen, Colin McNay, Sam Carlson, Richard Pinkham, Rosie Dupre Littlefield, Peter Saltsman, Brad Weirick, Kathy Briscoe, and Peter Folger were there. I’m sure there were others. Note to self: Next time, take notes. The evening entertainment was our own Tom Burack, pardon me, Jean Baptiste, followed by Schlitz on Mount Washington and then a cool bunk room. Second note to self: Moosilauke cabins are coed. We were 10 to 12 ’82s in ours, all mildly taken aback. “Is anyone a champion snorer?” someone asked. All I know is I slept through whoever was. After breakfast Kathy Briscoe and I, who met on freshman trip, took a 3-mile hike about halfway to the peak and talked nonstop for two hours. What a treat.\n\nRegistering at Thompson scored me three more early encounters—Sarah Riddle Lilja, Scrib Fauver and Walt Cressler. Appearances aside (mine only) it could have been 1982 as we talked. Sarah’s a retired mental health professional in Minnesota doing photography, Scrib lives down the road and teaches at Kimball Union, and Walt is a professor of paleobotany and science librarian at West Chester University of Pennsylvania.\n\nA shout-out to the “Rassias Raiders,” an ’82 French language study abroad group and clan for life. They mini-reuned and celebrated one of their own, Matt Yee, who has cancer, and husband Paul Hannigan. Carol Davis will cover it more fully in the ’82 newsletter.\n\nSo many ’82s and so little time, but what is time? It seemed we’d left in 1982 for parallel universes and were just slipping back to the original in the middle of summer semester. It was surreal. Maybe all that rain and mist…very Brigadoonish, if you know what I mean.\n\nFinal note to self: Bring soap for dorm shower. Running furtively down the hall soaking wet in towel and shower cap to retrieve facial cleanser is not desirable first reunion impression.\n\n—Philippa M. Guthrie, 2303 Woodstock Place, Bloomington, IN 47401; (812) 325-7512; philippaguthrie@yahoo.com; David Eichman, 9004 Wonderland Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90046; dme4law@sbcglobal.net\n\nWe did it! Once again, the great class of 1982 set a new College record—this time for attendance at a 40th reunion—with 336 classmates registered for the June 15-18 reunion. We obliterated the previous record of 276. Despite a rainy weekend, we enjoyed the chance to reconnect and make new connections while touring the new buildings on campus, including the Class of 1982 Engineering and Computer Science Center. There were dozens of classmates who attended a reunion for the first time!\n\nKudos to reunion co-chairs Eric Miller and Jim Vahey for creating a magical four days in Hanover. Thanks to the entire reunion team that helped with selecting food options, securing venues, and organizing dozens of events, receptions, and speaker panels. We are definitely greater together! Shoutouts to Laura Murray Dobbin for overseeing the food and Susan Burkhardt for organizing the swag.\n\nIn addition to classmate TED-like talks (thank you, Beth Stephenson) and a class project update, there were also some new events. Thanks to Carl Salas for suggesting tea at Sanborn Library. And Corinne Heyes organized a scavenger hunt that had teams of six running all over campus to find clues and photograph them.\n\nOn Sunday we once again memorialized our deceased classmates in a beautiful service of remembrance led by Tee Lotson with musical accompaniment and singing by Matt Yee, Bernie Thompson, Jamie MacKenzie, Judith Service Montier, and Tim May. Robin Shaffert read a Jewish prayer. As Tee said each name, she lit a candle and classmates came up and said a few words about that person. There are currently 54 classmates who are no longer with us physically. Those who died since the 35th reunion include Pamela M. Brill, Kerek E. Frierson, Sally Adnopoz Gendler, Anchie H. Kuo, Peter D. Johnson, Charles S. Nierman, Jeffrey D. Given, Andrew P. Gaillard, Steven M. Schreiber, Jeffrey R. Bechler, and Peggy Ruby Martineau.\n\nNew class officers were elected at the Saturday night dinner (which included lobster!). Christi Strauss is our new president. Robin Shaffert and Hank Malin are our co-vice presidents, Philippa Guthrie will be joining me as co-secretary, and David Plekenpol will remain as our treasurer and chief finance officer. We are still looking for classmates for many other positions so if you have been wanting to get involved with our class leadership, now is the time. Contact Christi!\n\nI will close this column by thanking George Thompson for serving as class president these past four years. It was a true pleasure being part of “Team Thompson” and George really led our class through turbulent times with compassion and empathy (and humor). I also want to thank my co-secretary these past five years, Jenny Chandler Hauge, for her enduring optimism and unparalleled commitment to this class. She poured her heart and soul into these columns, the daily birthday emails, and the notes and cards that she sent to you. I am happy to report that she has agreed to help Phillipa and me when needed.\n\n—David Eichman, 9004 Wonderland Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90046; dme4law@sbcglobal.net; Philippa M. Guthrie, 2303 Woodstock Place, Bloomington, IN 47401; (812) 325-7512; philippaguthrie@yahoo.com\n\n“Where in the world are the ’82s?” This is an important question given that our class is likely to trample any prior records for attendance at a 40th reunion, which means that many of our farthest-flung classmates may be back with us on the Hanover Plain in June. Sixty percent of our graduating class participated in a foreign study program. Since graduating, many have pursued professional and personal passions far from U.S. soil. What motivates ’82s to live abroad? As Jay Shofet shared, “My political inspiration—that all politics is local—came from my dad, who was mayor of our village, on the county board, and in his younger days, active in Connecticut state politics. In Israel the polity is just a few million people—a medium-sized metropolis—so I get to experience and participate in the thrill of national politics with the intimacy of local political activism. To give a banal example, I’ve met and chatted with every recent prime minister of Israel, and one prime minister—and his wife—are in our larger circle of friends.” In case you bump into someone at reunion who has lived abroad, I’m offering what I hope is a useful primer to who’s-living-where. Armed with this information you’ll surely have something to break any awkward silence after not seeing someone in 41 years. Here’s where we’ve landed (or where the College thinks we are): Garry Anthony, Virgin Islands; Rick Bercuvitz, Canada; Lynn Blades, England; Alex Blumrosen, France; Sean Burke, France; Nilgun Celik, Turkey; Mark Davidson, Japan; Kevin Devine, Germany; Mike Dickens, England; Bob Faber, Bulgaria; Dov Fraser, Australia; David Gibbons, Bermuda; Gerard Hekker, Singapore; Phillipa Jones, New Zealand; Tricia Kinsman, France; Ann Lindley, Spain; Nathan Longan, Russia; Joey Wallace Lowther, England; Davin Mackenzie, Taiwan; James Nadler, Canada; Richard Nadworny, Sweden; Edith Weinshienk Olesker, Israel; Michael Paige, Canada; Dave Parker, Netherlands; Phil Perry, Argentina; Statis Rizas, Canada; Yisrael “Jay” Rosenberg, Israel; Roberto Saint Malo, Spain; Amy Seibold, Australia; Wes Sheridan, Canada; Jay Shofet, Israel; Kjersti Aksnes Skantze, Norway; Tony Smith, Germany; Harry Teahan, Denmark; Hilda Wang, Hong Kong; Stephen Wood, Spain—and those are just the foreign-based classmates we know about. Others used to live abroad (Stephen Berger, John Henderson, and David Plenkenpol among them) and have now settled stateside. I’m curious to learn from each ’82 where in this world is “home” and what keeps you there? As some of us consider next chapters (retirement!) and where we might plant our feet, I’ve heard at least one classmate suggest she might be heading to Portugal—great elder care and good wine, inexpensive housing, and nice weather. As for me, this is my farewell column. I take my leave inspired by the lyrics, “’round the girdled earth they roam,” and the ’82 spirit of “greater together.” I’ve so enjoyed sending happy birthday wishes your way in partnership with David Eichman, who’s the epitome of a classy class secretary. Be well, travel far, and return “home”—wherever that may be—at peace.\n\n—Jenny Chandler Hauge, 3506 Idaho Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20016; jchandlerhauge@gmail.com; David Eichman, 9004 Wonderland Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90046; dme4law@sbcglobal.net\n\n“Let’s Celebrate Together!” is the theme of our 40th reunion in Hanover June 15-18—in just a few weeks. Come one, come all! P.T. Barnum has nothing on our reunion co-chairs Eric Miller and Jim Vahey, who promise four days of fun and fabulous events with plenty of time to reconnect with classmates and see all of the new buildings on campus. It will be a true post-pandemic party you won’t want to miss!\n\nPlease do not let costs get in the way of coming to the reunion. It is very important to your class officers that everyone who would like to attend is able to do so. We have set up a fund to defray reunion costs such as registration fees and housing costs. If you need financial assistance in order to attend, please contact George Thompson at gthompson@gthompsonlegal.com or (508) 736-0070. Your inquiry is completely confidential. If you know of any classmate who would like to attend but is worried about the cost, please let any class officer know. We are greater together!\n\nThe official activities begin on Thursday night with a welcome reception and class dinner in our class tent followed by time to catch up. Non-alcoholic beverages will be available throughout the reunion. Come Friday to take full advantage of everything on offer: a welcome breakfast, a class meeting, celebrations of the class projects we have established through the years, tours of campus buildings and even tea at Sanborn (thank you, Carl Salas). On Friday there will also be open houses at many of the College’s academic departments. Come say “bonjour” to your former French professor or impress your economics professor that you still remember what a Laffer curve is. Don’t miss Friday evening’s reception and dinner followed by a band at our class tent. Remember dancing to “Rock Lobster”?\n\nSaturday begins with a scavenger hunt (thanks to Corinne Heyes), followed by a chance to climb the 86 steps of Bartlett Tower. Then you can hear President Hanlon speak. We will be having a joint lunch with the classes of 1983 and 1984, followed by gatherings sponsored by alumni affiliated and shared interest groups (such as Black Alumni at Dartmouth Association, Dartmouth Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Alumni Association, and Women of Dartmouth). You will have plenty of time to enjoy summer in Hanover and play Frisbee on the Green or take a walk around Occom Pond, then a final class reception and dinner, followed by a celebration on the Green with all of the reuning classes before returning to our own class tent for a final evening of dancing to the tunes of our own D.J. Photo booth and ice cream included!\n\nAfter breakfast on Sunday, we will gather to remember those classmates who have died. Tee Lotson will continue to inspire and lead us and we will join together to cry, laugh, and share stories. I, for one, am so grateful to be part of this amazing class. Jenny and I cannot wait to see you, hug you, and celebrate together!\n\n—David Eichman, 9004 Wonderland Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90046; dme4law@sbcglobal.net; Jenny Chandler Hauge, 3506 Idaho Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20016; jchandlerhauge@gmail.com\n\nA highlights reel for the fall of 2022 would include the virtual mini-reunion author talk attended by 20-plus classmates, organized by mini-reunion co-chairs Mike Berg, Sue Elliot,and Jon Baker and facilitated by Nicole Stent. Guest speaker Dartmouth professor Matt Delmont, associate dean of international studies and interdisciplinary programs and the Sherman Fairchild Distinguished Professor of History, who is an expert on Black history and the history of civil rights, spoke about his newest book, Half American: The Epic Story of African Americans Fighting World War II at Home and Abroad. Everyone reported it was a fascinating conversation. Another highlight was the celebration of coeducation and reopening of Dartmouth Hall in November attended by an enthusiastic posse of ’82 women and a few men, too. Word has it that not only did the ’82s shine as superstars for the weekend’s programs but our class also had the largest number of classmates attending: Emily Bakemeier (moderator for the welcome keynote panel,“When Dartmouth Women Lead: Creating Space for New Voices and Perspectives”), Dan Black, Cheryl Bascomb, Jean Bina, Nancy Bowler-Goeselt, Kathy Briscoe, Brook Confort, Melissa Cook, Carol Davis, Tina Dooley-Jones (panelist for “Women’s Rights are Human Rights”), Kathy Dubishar, Vaune Dugan, Rosie Dupre, Martha Hill Gaskill (panelist for “Stories of Trials and Triumph from World-Class Competitors”), Gail Kezer, Betsy Leggat, Tee Lotson, Ann MacAffer, Sharon McClymonds, Elisabeth McKeon, Sarah Melcher, Alison Schultz Moscow, Kate Ringe-Welch, Kate Riski, Beth Scholle, Meg Singer, Margaret Spring (panelist for“World on Fire: Planet Earth’s ‘Code Red’ ”), George Thompson, Robin Shaffert, Laura Dobbin, Corinne Heyes, Regina Podlesak, Laura Davis, Gray Horan, Cathy Judd-Stein, Sherri Oberg, Sue Elliott, Sue Burkhardt,and Gail Sullivan. Class of ’82s dominate in the world of entertainment, too. “Christmas Eve,” a new release by Seth Swirsky, was a radio hit and Steve Warren’s Emmy-nominated television series, We’re Here! was included in The Los Angeles Times’ December list of “perfect movies and TV shows to curl up with over the holiday break.” Austin Beutner spearheaded the passage of Prop. 28 in California that provides $1 billion for arts funding in public schools. “I’m a public-school kid—the son of an immigrant and a public school teacher—who has lived the American dream. When Prop. 28 passes, it will create a brighter future for 6 million public school kids in California. That’s my reward.” Daniel Geschwind received the National Academy of Medicine Sarnat Prize for Contributions to Understanding of the Genetics of Autism. Sadly, Andy Gaillard passed away on November 3. Before he left us, Andy joined by Zoom as numerous classmates, brothers from Phi Delt, and underclassmen rowers gathered at the Head of the Charles to dedicate a boat in his honor. In typical fashion Kathy Briscoe sprang into action and galvanized folks to raise enough money to endow the racing shell named The Gaillard. John Froemming spoke eloquently to Andy’s legacy as a rower and wonderful human. You can add your tribute to Andy—and Jeff Bechler, who we just learned died December 29—on our “In Memoriam” page on the ’82 website.\n\n—Jenny Chandler Hauge, 3506 Idaho Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20016; jchandlerhauge@gmail.com; David Eichman, 9004 Wonderland Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90046; dme4law@sbcglobal.net\n\nOne of the best things about turning 62 is that you can purchase a lifetime “senior” National Parks visitor pass for just $80! There are also all kinds of other discounts—from movies to restaurants to rental cars. Class of ’82s are settling into our new status as “older adults.” If you do visit a National Park, be sure to post a photo in the “Class of 1982” Facebook group.\n\nTwins Catherine Munson Reed and Diana Munson celebrated their birthdays with each other as well as their 95-year father, class of 1948. Cathy writes, “Went to birthday dinner at New Thailand restaurant in Lebanon [New Hampshire].” Diana also made and canned 24 pints of applesauce on her special day.\n\nGlenn Gilliam has worked hard to make sure that Althea Gibson is remembered for her athletic achievements in tennis and golf. Gibson was the first Black tennis player to win the U.S. National Championships, in 1950. She also went on to win Wimbledon (twice) and the French Open. Glenn successfully lobbied to have part of West 143rd Street in Harlem named after Gibson. That is where her family lived after moving to New York City from South Carolina during the 1930s. Go see the Althea Gibson sculpture on the grounds of the U.S. Open in Forest Hills, New York, where Glenn graduated from high school. He also helped raise money for the 2015 documentary film, Althea.\n\nWhile having brunch with Dana Kurtz in San Francisco in June, I discovered that the book I was reading, Three Minutes in Poland, was written by her brother, Glenn. The impetus for the book was three minutes of a home movie shot by their grandfather, David Kurtz, while on a 1938 trip to the village in Poland where he was born. This brief footage shows hundreds of the Jewish residents of Nasielsk celebrating. A few years later most of them would be rounded up and sent off to be murdered or worked to death. Dana’s brother has made it his life’s mission to try and identify as many of the people who appear in this film as possible—this three-minute clip being the only documentation for many that they even existed. This year a movie was released documenting Glenn’s (and Dana’s) journey.\n\nOn October 10 Dartmouth President Emeritus James E. Wright ’64 (adopted) died. Jim was a much-loved history professor and visionary leader who contributed much to making our alma mater the diverse and welcoming campus it is today. Many of us were fortunate to call him a friend and mentor. Watch the emotional tribute Jake Tapper ’91 gave him on the October 27 edition of CNN Tonight. Our deepest condolences to Susan and the entire Wright family.\n\nOur 40th reunion will take place June 15-18 in Hanover. If you have ideas for specific events or activities that you would like to see happen during reunion or if you would like to help with reunion planning, please contact either of our reunion co-chairs Eric Miller (eric.miller@tigerpresentations.com) or Jim Vahey (javahey@att.net).\n\n—David Eichman, 9004 Wonderland Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90046; dme4law@sbcglobal.net; Jenny Chandler Hauge, 3506 Idaho Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20016; jchandlerhauge@gmail.com\n\nWe’ve launched our pathway to our next big reunion thanks to 40th reunion co-chairs Eric Miller and Jim Vahey, joined by enthusiastic volunteers from the class. The word on the street is that it’s going to be epic: the music, the dancing, and of course the main reason why we’re gathering in Hanover June 15-18, 2023—to spend time with our amazing classmates. From teatime at Sanborn Library (thank you, Carl and Sandra Salas) to TED talks (Beth Johnston Stephenson, producer extraordinaire) you won’t want to miss a minute.\n\nDana Kurtz sends her best wishes to everyone reporting that “all is great in San Francisco” and she’ll be there! Kate Pesek (now Kate Roski) is now bicoastal. “My husband and I are living in Naples, Florida, in the winter and San Francisco in the summer. I have been working in sustainability and entrepreneurship for several years and currently work as director of business development for a global nonprofit called Net Impact, which prepares business school students for ESG [environmental, social, governance] careers. I’m also working on my golf game, with much less success, but it’s fun anyway. My husband is a very good golfer, so the game is a big part of our lives. I’m really looking forward to our reunion next year and getting reengaged with the class!”\n\nDavid Eichman, now retired from the law, has a new gig volunteering on the West Hollywood, California, senior advisory board: “I am the youngest member by about 12 years! There is a movement now to stop using the term ‘senior’ and replace it with ‘older adult.’ Barry and Phyllis Caldwell are looking at aging through a different lens: grapes! They’ve become winemakers. (Who else remembers Barry’s favorite expression as “fine wine”?) Alex Blumrosen welcomed this correspondent and Cheryl Bascomb, together with our spouses, while we were in Paris at the end of June enjoying a Dartmouth alumni trip focused on the African American experience in Paris during the Jazz Age. It was great to learn that Dartmouth students also have the opportunity to experience the same curriculum. Alex appreciated his 62nd birthday message of encouragement from the class officers to buy a lifetime senior visitor pass for the U.S. National Parks, sharing this comment: “Indeed will sign up for the National Parks Service [NPS] lifetime pass with thoughts of classmate Mike Kenyon, now retired, who worked legal for NPS for most of his career.”\n\nIn July Dan Gaulin spent time with Mike Berg and a few other ’82s: Jason Klein, Bruce Randall, Jon Sadick,and Steve Levitan. Dan noted, “Mike reminded us of the reunion next year and all of us who were at the 35th are definitely going to the 40th. The TED talks were a huge hit with us.” The messages your class co-secretaries send celebrating classmates’ birthdays often lead to humorous comments, such as this quip from Tom Burack: “My barber gave me an early gift yesterday that will keep on giving—a senior citizen discount!” Keep on laughing, everyone!\n\n—Jenny Chandler Hauge, 3506 Idaho Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20016; jchandlerhauge@gmail.com; David Eichman, 9004 Wonderland Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90046; dme4law@sbcglobal.net\n\nAfter two years of postponed or cancelled celebrations and virtual get-togethers, the class of 1982 is slowly gathering in person again. In April classmates met in Philadelphia to celebrate the life of Sally Adnopoz Gendler, who died in 2020. Ralph McDevitt and Amy Warner shared memories and stories of Sally. Class of ’82s in attendance included Cathy Judd-Stein, Kathy Briscoe, Peter Folger, Mary Thomson Renner, David Plekenpol, Jim McKenzie, Ann MacAffer, Susan Burkhardt, Linda Bornhuetter Gridley, Dana Burroughs Klinges, Crashy Zacher Brown, Laura Murray Dobbin, Sharon Flynn McClymonds, Tee Lotson, Gina Kunz Podlesak, Jenny Chandler Hauge, and Karen Masterson Dienst. Sally would have been happy seeing so many classmates together.\n\nIn May many classmates headed to Hanover to dedicate a new building, celebrate an amazing alumna, and congratulate the oldest alumni affiliated group on its 50th anniversary. First of all, the College honored our class with the dedication of the Class of 1982 Engineering and Computer Science Center—a new building in the west end of campus. We are only the third class in the history of Dartmouth to have a campus building named for us! Many classmates got a sneak peek of the building in April when President Hanlon joined our class-wide Zoom call. Trustee Greg Maffei spoke at the dedication ceremony. Classmates gathered in Molly’s later to celebrate. We now have the perfect selfie spot on campus. Class of ’82s attending the celebrations included Robin Riley Ahrens, Geoff Ralston, Mike Sapers, Melissa Cook, Beth Johnston Stephenson, Al Forbes, Susan Burkhardt, Mike Berg, Rosi Dupre Littlefield, Sherri Carroll Oberg, George Thompson, Tony Pritzker, Cheryl Bascomb, Bob Lee, and Emily Bakemeier.\n\nAt the May Alumni Council meeting Tee Lotson became the fifth member of the class to receive the Dartmouth Alumni Award for outstanding service to the College. Classmates on hand to celebrate the second-youngest member of our class included Philippa Guthrie, Tom Daniels, Sherri Carroll Oberg, Danny Black, Cheryl Bascomb, Mary Thomson Renner, Herb Hardwick, and John Nicholson. Tee served as president of the Dartmouth Alumni Council and is always connecting classmates together around the girdled earth from her base in “the greatest city in the world” (according to Hamilton).\n\nFinally, hundreds of alums, family, and friends gathered in Hanover during Memorial Day weekend to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Black Alumni of Dartmouth Association (BADA). Tee (and Ricki Fairley ’78) co-chaired the BADA reunion, which included a wonderful weekend of events, activities, and lots of time to connect and reconnect across classes. Class of ’82s in attendance included Danny Black, Herb Hardwick, Nicole Stent, Linda Jackson, Stephan Dweck, Cynthia Hall McCraven, Willie Williams, Lenny Jones, Al Forbes, Al Dotson, Barry Caldwell, Bernie Thompson, and Cheryl Bascomb.\n\nPlease put June 15-18, 2023—the dates of our next big class reunion in Hanover—in your calendar now. Reunion chair Eric Miller and his team are planning an unforgettable four days. We would love to hear your ideas for reunion activities and events and welcome your help with the planning. Please contact Eric at eric.miller@tigerpresentations.com. The reunion is just 10 months away!\n\n—David Mason Eichman, 9004 Wonderland Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90046; dme4law@sbcglobal.net; Jenny Chandler, 3506 Idaho Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20016; jchandlerhauge@gmail.com\n\nHow amazing that the College has recognized ’82 fabulousness by naming the new engineering building the Class of ’82 Engineering and Computer Science Center! Here’s Hugh Jackson, Th’83, on his engineering career: “It all began when a 15-pound box of IBM computer cards arrived at my Hinman box from the U.S. Geological Service containing daily river flow data dating from the 1930s for the Mascoma River. Thus was launched my freshman seminar project at the engineering school studying the potential of low-head hydro power. The data, the analysis—I loved it all—despite the 3 a.m. sessions at Kiewit. Professor Paul Queneau, a world expert in smelting processes, exposed me to this great profession of real-world problem-solving, and Chris Weiss rescued me many times along the way with his expert computer programming!” Linda Jackson, the first Black woman to graduate from Dartmouth with an engineering science degree, is now a well-recognized orthopedic surgeon with an inspirational story: “I came to Dartmouth aspiring to be a physician, following in my father’s and grandfather’s footsteps, but temporarily changed course for biomedical engineering. During my master’s in chemical engineering I spent a great deal of time working on projects involving orthopedic implants, not knowing where I would end up in life. Once in the work world I realized quickly that I wanted to be more directly involved in improving people’s lives. I applied to medical school at Columbia, following in the legacy of my cousin, who was the second African American female admitted to Columbia in 1936 and the only female of 14 applicants to orthopedic residency programs. At the University of Connecticut I was the only female orthopedic resident and later at the Hospital for Special Surgery in 1995 shared the honor of being one of the first two African American females to be fellowship-trained in hand and upper-extremity surgery in the United States. I started practicing in Atlanta, but I had always longed to retire in the Caribbean and an opportunity came along to practice in the U.S Virgin Islands, where I stayed for nine years. I currently provide orthopedic care in an underserved area in West Virginia part time. Surgery is hard to give up. It is who I am and what I love. Eventually the hours and the physical nature of it all will get the better of me, but that day is not here yet. I love my work and my patients. It gives me purpose. I can only hope that during the last 25 years I have been an inspiration to young girls and women and an example of the possibilities in the field of orthopedic surgery and engineering. We have made small gains, but there is room for more women in both of those professions. Dartmouth was where it all began. The path was long and arduous, but my encouragement and support at the beginning gave me confidence and made it all possible.”\n\n—Jenny Chandler, 3506 Idaho Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20016; jchandlerhauge@gmail.com; David Eichman, 9004 Wonderland Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90046; dme4law@sbcglobal.net\n\n“Acquiring a dog may be the only opportunity a human ever has to choose a relative.” This quote by Mordecai Siegal is one of my favorites. Many of us regard our pets as family members. This column is dedicated to all classmates who expanded their families during these past two years with pandemic pets. I should disclose up front that I am a dog person.\n\nMartha Solis-Turner writes, “We got a golden retriever in May 2020. We were supposed to travel a lot in 2020 since we were empty-nesters, but then Covid put a kibosh on our plans. And two of our kids had to come home from college. Since we were suddenly going to be home for a while, we decided to get a new puppy. Her name is Fika and she has won our hearts.”\n\nLouis Grimmelbein reports, “Our dog is named Rider. He is a mixed breed with the highest percentage being a mountain cur. We adopted him from Louisiana about a year and a half into the lockdown. Rider loves to run with and chase other dogs and jump on people to say hello. He really is a big hound dog oaf.”\n\nMarty Jacobs adopted two dogs during the pandemic. First, a black Lab mix puppy named Baloo. Marty writes “He’s an incredibly affectionate and laidback dog with all those endearing and annoying Lab traits.” Baloo needed a buddy so they then adopted Luna—a 12-week-old Australian cattle dog mix. “She is equally as mellow and affectionate as Baloo and they are having a lot of fun!”\n\nJohn Faucher and his family have fostered cats and kittens for years from their local animal shelter. John notes, “Not every attorney is lucky enough to have a great paralegal who is both an excellent employee and a cat. Sebastian is a very photogenic and handsome cat with his own Instagram account.” He can be found most days sleeping on the office printer, while new feline addition Milo prefers to sit on the keyboard.\n\nWendy Richter adopted mixed breed dog Trooper in November 2021 from the Massachusetts Humane Society. He originally came from Georgia.\n\nWalt Cressler reports, “Our chief pets during the pandemic have been rats. Rats make very good pets. When properly socialized, they are very sweet, friendly, and intelligent. We don’t take in stray rats, by the way.”\n\nDavid Plekenpol got a wonderful birthday surprise—a Bernese mountain dog and poodle mix puppy named Aspen. Plek shares: “She arrived on December 24. Total surprise to me. As we are now relocated from China to the United States, we can fully embrace the ultimate Colorado life with our first family dog.”\n\nBob Lee asked, “Does feeding wild birds count?”\n\nJeff Newman wins the award for the most unusual pets. He writes, “When the lockdown started I went out and bought two female Siberian dwarf hamsters. They fought a lot. I had to study hamster anatomy to realize that one was male; bought a second habitat.”\n\n—David Eichman, 9004 Wonderland Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90046; dme4law@sbcglobal.net; Jenny Chandler Hauge, 3506 Idaho Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20016; jchandlerhauge@gmail.com\n\nHat tip to Betsy Leggat for uncovering news of classmate Margaret Spring: “I clicked on a story about plastic waste in the United States and a report calling for a national strategy on plastic pollution in the world’s oceans (spoiler alert—the United States comprises only 4 percent of the world’s population but provides 20 percent of plastic trash).” The report Betsy noticed was issued by a national committee chaired by our own ’82, Margaret Spring, who also serves as chief conservation and science officer at the Monterey Bay (California) Aquarium. Plastic waste is found in almost every marine habitat, from the ocean surface to deep sea sediments. What path did Margaret take between Hanover and Monterey that led to her chairing the National Academies of Science, Engineering, Medicine’s committee on U.S. contributions to global ocean plastic waste? “Like many of us, I arrived in Hanover with a jumble of interests, curiosity, and a thirst for knowledge and no career path in mind. At Dartmouth I combined my long fascination with the ocean and environment with earth science classes, eventually focusing on environmental solutions. After Duke Law School and two fellowships and externships in D.C., I began a career in environmental law, first in private practice counseling corporations on waste and pollution compliance, then in government focusing on ocean and climate law and policy in the U.S. Senate and then in the Obama administration. My husband, Mark Bunter (a California-born winemaker), and I moved to Monterey in 2013, and it’s been fantastic. I recently chaired a committee for the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine around ocean plastic called for by the 2020 bipartisan Save Our Seas 2.0 Act. On December 1, 2021, we released our study. I invite everyone to learn about what we can all do—the next generation is counting on us!” As a result of Margaret’s committee’s work, negotiation of an ocean plastic pollution treaty is on the agenda in the United Nations. Margaret is one among many ’82s whose professional and personal passions are focused on environmental sustainability. Lydia Chambers advocates for clean water and more in her New Jersey community. She has served on her local planning board and is currently cochair of a regional pollinator working group. Sam Carlson isanother pollinator advocate. Arecent project with Green Lantern Solar in Vermont is turning land under solar arrays and power lines into habitat for native pollinators. Katie Stearns Friday (U.S. Forest Service)and J.B. Friday (University of Hawaii) have long devoted their work lives to forest stewardship in Hawaii. Gina Blus writes: “[In 2021] I moved from Oakland, California, to Post Mills, Vermont, to White River Junction, Vermont, to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where I plan to stay forever. I aspire to less packing and more fun in the year ahead and hope the same for you.” Mike Berg shared his aspirations for ’22: “They are simple. I want to ski and travel someplace sunny this winter, enjoy good health, and reconnect with lots of friends and classmates post-pandemic.” Well said, Mike!\n\n—Jenny Chandler Hauge, 3506 Idaho Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20016; jchandlerhauge@gmail.com; David Eichman, 9004 Wonderland Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90046; dme4law@sbcglobal.net\n\n“The Class Officer Association’s executive board and alumni relations recognizes the class of 1982 for originating and launching the ’82 Racial Justice Initiative supporting the African and African-American studies academic enrichment fund and rallying other classes, alumni organizations, and individuals across the Dartmouth community to support the initiative.” This commendation was presented to our class during the annual Volunteer Officers Experience (VOX) weekend in October—the second one conducted virtually. Vice President for Alumni Relations Cheryl Bascomb welcomed all alumni with a Zoom background of the Homecoming bonfire, leaving many of us feeling nostalgic and longing for Hanover. Many of your class officers attended the various workshops and presentations, including breakout sessions with alums from other classes, clubs, affiliated/shared interest groups, and Women of Dartmouth. We even got to play Pictionary using Dartmouth-related emojis. Jenny Chandler Hauge, Barry Caldwell, and George Thompson spoke to the President/Vice President Officer Association about the racial justice initiative. Since there were no individual officer awards for the second year, Carol Davis continues her reign as Class Newsletter Editor of the Year—although there might be an asterisk next to her name in the Dartmouth history books. We all hope that next year’s VOX weekend will take place in Hanover!\n\nAnother highlight from this year’s VOX weekend was watching a video of Tee Lotson inviting everyone to attend next year’s 50th anniversary celebration of the founding of the Black Alumni of Dartmouth Association (BADA). Tee promises this will be an event not to miss! So plan to be in Hanover May 26-30. This year is also the 50th anniversary of coeducation and the founding of the Native American studies program.\n\nSpeaking of anniversaries, MTV was launched 40 years ago on August 1, 1981. How many of you can remember the very first music video that you saw? Jon Thompson writes, “I spent far too many hours in the [Sigma Alpha Epsilon] ‘tube room’ marveling at the new music video medium…and crushing on cute VJ Martha Quinn.” Hal Sandstrom remembers “Gloria” by U2 as the first music video that he saw. Ronn LaBrasca shares, “I don’t recall my first MTV video, but I remember liking the creativity in some of Peter Gabriel’s videos.” Alex Blumrosen adds, “I thought MTV would be a fly-by-night flop. Wrong again!” And Betsy Kingsbury Dowd admits, “I actually never watched MTV!” My own memory is going into Collis Center after lunch at Thayer to check out this new “phenomenon” on its big screen TV and finding it so mesmerizing that I completely lost track of time. By the time I left, it was already dark outside!\n\nPlease remember that our next class reunion is not until 2023—since we will be clustered with the ’83s and ’84s. So put June 15-18, 2023, in your calendar now. I must close this column with the sad news that Jeff Given died on July 9, 2021. An obituary is available on the class website. Wishing you all a healthy and happy 2022!\n\n—David Eichman, 9004 Wonderland Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90046; dme4law@sbcglobal.net; Jenny Chandler Hauge, 3506 Idaho Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20016; jchandlerhauge@gmail.com\n\nThe year2021 was a time to reflect on what really matters to each of us. Some ’82s are already retiring, some are heading in new directions, and we are each facing new challenges and taking stock of where we want to be with the time we have left. At the end of July Dan Gaulin wrote:“Some of the best times lately have included ’82s and water. Bruce Randall and I went out on Jon Sadick’s sailboat, which he now moors in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Last weekend Bruce, Mike Berg, and I went out on the Hudson on Jason Klein’s cruiser. Tomorrow I’m going to the ‘WooSox’ game with Jon Sadick. His dad, a WW II vet, will be honored before the game. I am retired and have returned to an old pastime—baseball—in a league for 55-year-olds and up. I can still hit a bit but sometime in the last few decades my arm turned into a pool noodle. I also enjoy making things with the trees in the neighborhood, maple syrup and nocino (black walnut liquor).” David Noonan wrote about turning 61, “The joys of my post-pandemic existence include still having a job but not really working, falling asleep when I should be awake and staying awake when I should be sleeping, maintaining golf mediocrity despite diligent practice, and forgetting everyone’s name at the same time.” Some lucky ’82s are traveling overseas again. Before he wrapped up his law practice of 28 years, my class co-secretary, David Eichman, made it to O’ahu, Hawaii, where he got together with Matt Yee. While they were hiking together Matt and David FaceTimed with Leslie Fleming, who has moved back to O’ahu (from San Francisco) with her husband and is teaching art. Also during the summer, Tom Daniels met up with longtime Parisian resident Alex Blumrosen, and Brian McDonough set out for London to work on the new Peninsula Hotel near Hyde Park. Thinking about traveling to Iceland? Check in with Peter Feer, who traveled there in July to compete with one of his sons in The Rift, a gravel bike race, or ask Dan Gilman to share his photos from his family’s exploration of the “Land of Fire and Ice” with cameras in hand on a Dartmouth Alumni Travel excursion. Keep on exploring and be safe, ’82s! With sadness I must report the deaths of Charles Nierman of Malden, Massachusetts, on June 24, and Jeffrey Given of Lafayette, California, on July 9. A reminder that you can contribute reflections about Chaz and Jeff or submit a tribute for any of our deceased classmates and we’ll publish them on the “In Memoriam” pages of our Class website: www.1982.dartmouth.org. Also, please keep us updated if you have a new email address so you will continue to receive Class Notes and news. Did you know that we each have a dartmouth.edu email account? Claim your personal dartmouth.edu email address by emailing the alumni help desk at alumni.help@dartmouth.edu.\n\n—Jenny Chandler Hauge, 3506 Idaho Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20016; jchandlerhauge@gmail.com; David Eichman, 9004 Wonderland Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90046; dme4law@sbcglobal.net\n\nPlease plan to join our class at Homecoming October 8-9 for a belated 60th birthday bash with fellow ’82s! Among the many reasons to visit Hanover again are our classmates who call the Upper Valley home. Robin Riley Ahrens and her husband, Chris, moved to Thetford, Vermont, in early 2021: “It’s a homecoming as well as a new chapter. I’m lucky to spend time with my sister and college friends (Gray Reisfield Horan and Rich Horan ’76 moved to Hanover this summer) as I explore the area. I’m reaping the benefits of community supported agriculture shares and farm markets, enjoying close encounters with nature (no bears yet), and have learned that the spirit of Dartmouth is the spirit of the Upper Valley.” Sandy Kelsey is on the board of the Children’s Literacy Foundation serving at-risk children in New Hampshire and Vermont; Kevin Peterson and Marty Jacobs have similarly dedicated their professional lives to social impact work in the region. Sherri Carroll Oberg and husband Curt Oberg ’78: “We had a lifelong dream that one day we would return to the Upper Valley. We decided to stop dreaming and start doing. We love the beautiful surroundings filled with people who are active and love the outdoors. The College has an open-door policy for the community so it’s easy to participate in the intellectual life. I love mentoring students and there’s a fresh bunch every year. The arts community has been surprisingly rich, with great theater and music at the Hop, White River Junction [Vermont], and Lebanon [New Hampshire]—short drives, free parking, and up-close exposure to top performers! I was worried that my life would be overly focused on Dartmouth, but I was wrong. I picked up rowing through the Upper Valley Rowing Foundation, where I have met many people who are not affiliated with Dartmouth and who have welcomed me into their community of rowers. Life is good!” Jay Mead and Edie Farwell ’83 have been living in the Hartland-Norwich, Vermont, area since 2001. “This has been a great place to raise kids, make art, teach, and help low-income people with their shelter and access needs.” Doug Tengdin is founder and managing director of World Market Advisors, based in Hanover, where he provides wealth management services when not out hiking in the White Mountains. Barry Schweitzer shares, “Returning to Dartmouth two years ago to join the office of entrepreneurship and technology transfer has been a dream come true. We love the weather, the outdoorsy lifestyle, and the people in the Upper Valley. While we have been fortunate to have ridden out the pandemic in a lovely place such as Quechee [Vermont], I am looking forward to rejoining campus life when the College fully opens this fall.” Peter Moran wins the Most Intriguing LinkedIn Profile Award: “Volunteer, herder, woodworker: [I] provide community service work, support doctor and partner, shepherd teenage daughter, and design and build furniture of wood. [I] also manage investments and help manage household of three people, one dog, one cat, one bird, and one horse.”\n\n—Jenny Chandler Hauge, 3506 Idaho Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20016; jchandlerhauge@gmail.com; David Eichman, 9004 Wonderland Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90046; dme4law@sbcglobal.net\n\nThey say time bends, and if so, then perhaps ’82s have been wishing to stave off our 60s as we’ve turned to meditating, exercising, or volunteering our way out of Covid isolation. For John Henderson, who has devoted so much of his life to the people of Myanmar, this time has meant feeling helpless as tragedies unfolded far away. At least one classmate bucked the Covid-19 weight gain trend: Matt Yee lost 50 pounds! What changes caused by Covid will stick in our future personal or professional lives? What do we hope will stay the same? Matt Hoffman writes, “The inabilityto gather in person during Covid with friends, families, and colleagues will encourage me to have more face-to-face interactions once we’re out of the woods. Also, I plan to hug my loved ones for a second or two longer and think about not only the physical sensation, but also the individual and what (s)he means to me.I hope we will continue to have video calls, rather than text sessions, with long-distance friends and families.” Betsy Leggat says: “What will stick with me is the realization that I have more time than I thought! During Covid I allowed myself the time to exercise and do more volunteer work, and I hope that continues.” Our class president, George Thompson, sums it up: “Family hugs, hugs, and more hugs.” Melissa Cook, a member the advisory board for our class project with the Dickey Center for International Understanding, shared why she’s proud to support the creation of an academic enrichment fund for the African and African American studies (AAAS) program: “I studied Africa during my time at Dartmouth—in Leo Spitzer’s history courses and in anthropology courses. I remember sitting in the stacks looking for books—looking left, looking right, and discovering new worlds and ideas at every turn. That set me up for a career in investment research and strengthened my love of learning, travel, and understanding how different cultures work. To paraphrase the words of a former president of Dartmouth—the College should train students to go out and find the world’s opportunities or solve the world’s problems (although that presupposes that other people can’t solve their own problems)! Africa is the youngest, fastest-growing, most tech-savvy, and most dynamic continent and is the future for companies across the technology, healthcare, financial services, and other industries. African entrepreneurs and innovators are coming up with solutions to their own problems and creating products and services that will work around the world. For young people looking for the next great place to work, study, travel, and invest, Africa is the place to be. The AAAS program should be seen as core to the College’s mission and I am happy to be able to support it.” Melissa founded African Sunrise Partners LLC, a research and advisory firm dedicated to bringing investment to Africa. Look for an invitation to attend a virtual program this summer with the AAAS faculty to celebrate the endowment created by our class.\n\n—Jenny Chandler, 3506 Idaho Ave., NW Washington, DC 20016; jchandlerhauge@gmail.com; David Eichman, 9004 Wonderland Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90046; dme4law@sbcglobal.net\n\nAs we pass the one-year anniversary of life with the coronavirus, I asked classmates who work in the medical field to share personal reflections and stories. Bill Kinnard is an intensive care unit (ICU) physician in Colorado who writes: “It is all about the nurses and the respiratory therapists. I watch countless brave actions every day in the ICU. These are people who in ‘normal times’ spend nights, weekends, and holidays caring for the sickest of the sick. Without hesitation, any nurse or therapist will grab some protective gear and hustle into the room of a patient in need.”\n\nAnn Neumeyer is a doctor at the Lurie Center for Autism at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and works mainly with children and adults with developmental disabilities who shares: “For the past year, each day I’m privileged to enter many homes virtually during this pandemic and see my patients in a new way in their homes. I do want people to know that individuals with autism and developmental disabilities are profoundly affected by this pandemic. Children and adults with autism have challenges with schedule changes, and as we all know, nothing stays the same during the pandemic. As a result, we see so much more anxiety, depression, and distressing behaviors.”\n\nJim Howe is a surgeon in Iowa who writes: “The impact of Covid-19 has caused us to take extreme caution wearing masks and face shields, carry out hand-washing, and doing appropriate testing and screening to protect our patients. Since I work with cancer patients whose surgeries cannot always wait, I was able to continue work without much of a pause. In Iowa we were not overwhelmed with cases the way many urban centers were, so we are grateful for that.”\n\nI hope that you have heard by now that the class of 1982 has launched a new class project: the Class of 1982 Racial Justice Initiative (RJI). The RJI directs funding to the Dartmouth Center on Social Impact (the former Tucker Foundation) to provide stipends for undergraduate research related to racial justice, training about systemic racism for students engaged in social impact internships, and fund racial justice internships as part of the Dartmouth Partners in Community Service program. The RJI also creates the first academic enrichment endowment—the African and African American Academic Enrichment Fund—for the 50-year-old African and African American studies program at Dartmouth. This new endowment is intended to support activities that encourage civil dialogue about race and racial injustice and promote anti-racist study. Thank you to the following classmates who served on the task force that created and launched the RJI: Rachel Froman Bettencourt, Barry Caldwell (co-chair), Denny Ellison, Jenny Chandler Hauge (co-chair), Linda Jackson, Brian McDonough, Judith Service Montier, Neville Scott, Robin Shaffert, Martha Solis, and Nicole Stent. For more information and to donate, google “Dartmouth Class of 1982 Racial Justice Initiative.”\n\n—David Eichman, 9004 Wonderland Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90046; dme4law@sbcglobal.net; Jenny Chandler, 3506 Idaho Ave., NW Washington, DC 20016; jchandlerhauge@gmail.com\n\nHow did ’82s spend this past Covid-quarantine year? Innovating, surviving, grieving, reflecting, protesting, turning 60, and celebrating personal milestones that marked a year like no other. Here’s a roundup from the past 12 months.\n\nJohn Gaudioso quarantined in New Jersey, “I’m equidistant between my boys, one in New Haven, Connecticut, one in Baltimore. My daughter is out in Denver. This is the longest stretch ever (more than a year) without seeing her.”\n\nMultitalented Dr. Tee Lotson joined the board of directors of the N.Y. Road Runners Club. Hat tip to Tom Daniels, a fellow road runner, for that news.\n\nIt’s been a decade since David Plekenpol rode the smartphone wave to take a job with AAC in China. But during Covid David and Victoria quarantined in Colorado—living, not vacationing, in their U.S. residence. Starting in 2021 Plek anticipates splitting time between Shenzhen, Colorado, and Europe. Archaeologist Eric Cline has been busy—if not collecting artifacts from beneath the ground, then collecting accolades for his recent book, Digging Up Armageddon, which was named one of The Federalist’s“Notable Books for 2020.”\n\nJay Geller, lawyering in Falmouth, Maine, reflected: “I think the pandemic has been much harder on young families than on us old farts. I am most looking forward to the relief that they will experience by getting their lives back—returning to school and a more normal work environment. I miss seeing and being able to hug my godson and his siblings and occasionally giving their parents a break while the kids do a sleepover at our house.”\n\nBetsy and Doug Latham quarantined with their youngest son (age 30). Doug works for a company that provides ebooks to college students. Betsy is a certified public accountant near Boston. “Being able to see friends and family is our wish for the new year. We are grateful to have jobs, a home where we can get out into nature, and the love of family and friends.”\n\nWe’ve got some inspiring amateur photographers in our class, among them Sarah Riddle Lilja, David Silbersweig, and Dan Gilman. If you are a photographer, feel free to post to the ’82 Facebook page, and if you delight in interesting photos and are on Instagram, do follow our official class Instagram account: @Dartmouth1982.\n\nClass of ’82 doing good: Belated kudos to Steve Whitely, a York (Pennsylvania) Suburban High School teacher who received the 2020 Mini-Thon Leadership Development Award for helping his students raise more than $480,000 toward the fight against childhood cancer.\n\nOn his 60th birthday Hank Malin reported that it was a “beautiful day in Ohio (not an oxymoron) and our younger son is here to celebrate, so it’s a great day to turn 60. Here’s to a healthy and more civil and harmonious year ahead. I’m already looking forward to our 40th reunion, which will be here before we know it!” Hank’s right: Your class officers are starting to make a plan for June 2023! If you’d like to be involved in planning our 40th, please let our class president, George Thompson, know at gthompson@gthompsonlegal.com.\n\n—Jenny Chandler, 3506 Idaho Ave., NW Washington, DC 20016; jchandlerhauge@gmail.com; David Eichman, 9004 Wonderland Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90046; dme4law@sbcglobal.net\n\nBy the time you read this column, the year 2020 will be almost over and most of us will have turned 60. Despite the coronavirus throwing a monkey wrench into many milestone birthday celebrations, members of the class of 1982 were still able to find ways to mark a birthday with social distancing.\n\nDoug Brown writes: “We’re having a homebound celebration of grilling out with the family, which I imagine is pretty common these days.” Donna Halverstadt shared that she had “a quiet dinner (outside, of course) with my daughter and then a Zoom call with my closest group of friends talking about what we are going to do in September 2021 to celebrate the milestone of September 2020.”\n\nPatrick Viguerie spent his milestone birthday at the wedding of a close friend’s daughter with 130 people at the Ritz Reynolds in Lake Oconee, Georgia, writing, “Hard to believe that actually happened! I kept my mask on.” Kristin Johnson Dean shared, “I had an incredibly fun day planned by my husband and kids that included a Dartmouth pong tournament. I got to partner with my middle son, a ’16 and pong champion, and thus went undefeated! The Dartmouth influence continues on the West Coast!” Kent Arnold mused, “By the next time the odometer rolls over this loudly (age 70), life will probably have changed fairly comprehensively; the final phase of this career will be long over, so then what?”\n\nCindy Willett Sherwood reports from Virginia: “My special day included the discovery of live fleas on our dogs, despite them being on every possible flea preventative (ugh!); Covid tests for my husband and me (to rule it out—I think we just have minor colds but need to make sure before we expose others); and some better parts, including enjoying the first stretch of perfect, fall weather.” Hugh Jackson shared, “I was born on Labor Day 1960 and it was a sweltering hot day with no air conditioning for my very uncomfortable mom. Curiously, my sister was born on Memorial Day and my brother on Thanksgiving.” Robert Jessen and the State of California have the same birth date (not year!) and Robert added, “Since I grew up in California, I never had to go to school on my birthday!” While John Old celebrated his milestone birthday last year, his response to my birthday email brought a smile to my face: “Thanks, David, slowly growing into my name!!”\n\nIn October your class officers attended their first (and we hope last!) virtual (via Zoom) Class Officers Weekend, now known as VOX Volunteer Engagement Week. Our new class project focusing on racial justice is moving along. The first phase will provide financial support for student research and internships. The next phase will have a broader reach across campus, including enhancing the College’s ability to attract and retain outstanding faculty of color.\n\nI close with the sad news that our classmate Peter DeForest Johnson died on July 26, 2020. Obituaries of deceased classmates are available on the class website under the “In Memoriam” pages.\n\nHappy new year!\n\n—David Eichman, 9004 Wonderland Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90046; dme4law@sbcglobal.net; Jenny Chandler, 3506 Idaho Ave., NW Washington, DC 20016; jchandlerhauge@gmail.com\n\nSean Burke challenged himself to write a poem every day in April during lockdown in Paris where he lives. Here’s one of his daily “Covid Chronicles,” titled, “You Used to Be In Shape,” that I think works well as a rap to any of the songs from Hamilton: “You’d indulge yourself on Saturday/Not give a second thought to the price you’d pay/Just eat and drink to the hilt/And let Sunday’s workout banish the guilt!/You’d say hi to your gym friends/Inquire politely about their weekends/Even shake a hand or two/It’s what proper manners require we do. /Remember how every muscle was tended to/That’s what all those weights were meant to do/Each machine more advanced than the last/Making flabbiness a thing of the past./Now along comes confinement /And you’re faced with an assignment/How to live life like before/When the fitness center is no more?/So you tried that old jump rope/But deep down knew there was little hope/Sure, it would have been a breeze/Were it not for those aging knees./Then you read about something called isometrics/You thought, wow, that sounds better than calisthenics/So carefully and patiently you twisted and turned/But hours later barely a calorie had burned./Sure, you can go running or walking/But then you face policemen balking/Why are you so far from home, they ask/And why aren’t you wearing a mask?/Well perhaps you should just give in/During quarantine no one’s meant to be thin/So enjoy those chips as you ponder when/You’ll be able to work out once again!”\n\nPerhaps like me you ache to go somewhere more exotic that the local CVS. You can visit an English historic estate thanks to a Smithsonian virtual tour, featuring our very own Karen (Joey) Wallace Lowther, mistress of Holdenby House, Northamptonshire, United Kingdom, built in 1583. (And you thought turning 60 was historic!) From Karen: “You may not be able to invite me to your home, but I can invite you to mine from the comfort of your own sofa: www.holdenby.com. Holdenby House—my family home for 30-odd years—is featured in a series about great British estates on the Smithsonian Channel. I love the idea of showing my fellow ’82s around my home digitally, hoping many will visit in person when lockdown and quarantines end and the world returns to normal. Becki Ambrose and Meg Singer have visited and Phil Kaufmann was on his way when lockdown hit. Keep well and hope to see you soon, be it in Hanover or here at Holdenby.” Karen and her husband, James, have raised their four children in the historic home. If Italy’s more your thing, someday you may want to visit a formerly dilapidated villa in Tuscany, La Casa di Montegrossi, that Hope Wernick Wigmore and her husband, Mark, lovingly restored. Paying guests can visit for week-long holidays. Mini-reunion in Tuscany, anyone?\n\n—Jenny Chandler, 3506 Idaho Ave., NW Washington, DC 20016; jchandlerhauge@gmail.com; David Eichman, 9004 Wonderland Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90046; dme4law@sbcglobal.net\n\nBy the time you read this column, I imagine we will still be dealing with the coronavirus and its impacts. In the last column Jenny shared thoughts from several class leaders on how being a member of the Dartmouth community has helped them cope with this pandemic. For Part II of “Vox Clamantis in Pandemus,” I reached out to classmates living abroad. According to my very unofficial count, there are at least 28 members of our class who live outside of the United States.\n\nSean Burke writes from Paris: “France went into a strict lockdown on March 17. Only grocery stores, pharmacies, and some takeout restaurants were open. To be outside of our homes, we needed to carry a signed self-declaration explaining why we were out. There were only a few valid reasons: work (in some circumstances), food shopping, medical appointments. We could exercise outdoors, but only alone and no more than half a mile from home. In my spare time indoors, during April, I wrote rhymes about life in lockdown.” Sean wrote a total of 30 poems. Email me if you would like a copy of his “Quarantine Chronicles.”\n\nBob Faber shared the following from Bulgaria: “Camaraderie and creativity are two important aspects of life at Dartmouth that I remember fondly and always try to recreate, wherever my travels take me. When Bulgaria entered its lockdown, every aspect of life here turned upside down. Our work with children through the PINK Foundation came to a screeching halt. Within a few days I realized morale would quickly sink if we didn’t do something proactive to raise spirits among the team, so I organized weekly Zoom meetings just to give us a way to share news and encourage each other. These times together gave rise to activities such as distributing food parcels to hungry families, preparing home use materials for children out of school, and developing an online story hour to teach and entertain local preschoolers. We even held an impromptu Facebook live fundraiser to support summer programs for children at risk.”\n\nAnd John Henderson writes from Asia: “Here in Myanmar things aren’t too far from normal. People know what’s going on in the rest of the world, but mostly they don’t have a personal connection to Covid-19. Official numbers here in mid-June are just around 250 infected and just under 10 died in a country of more than 50 million. I am lucky enough to be able to keep consulting from my Yangon apartment and to keep taking long bike rides nearly every day. Since the start of the pandemic some Dartmouth pals organized a twice-monthly happy hour on Zoom. It’s now morphed into an online book club—nice!”\n\nI am saddened to report the deaths of classmates Anchie Kuo and Kerek Frierson. Please visit 1982.dartmouth.org and click on “In Memoriam” at the top for more information about them and all the members of our class who have died. You can share a memory or a photo on the page of a deceased classmate by sending an email to Matt Hoffman at dartmouth82@gmail.com.\n\nStay healthy and safe!\n\n—David Eichman, 9004 Wonderland Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90046; dme4law@sbcglobal.net; Jenny Chandler, 3506 Idaho Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20016; jchandlerhauge@gmail.com\n\nThese are tough times. As Covid-19 upended our worlds, we reached out to well-recognized voices in our class, asking them to share how they’ve been coping and what the Dartmouth community means to them. Here is Part I of the ’82 “Vox Clamantis in Pandemus.” Part II will appear in a future Dartmouth Alumni Magazine.\n\nMatt Hoffman writes: “It’s natural to feel anxious, frightened, and depressed while this invisible killer surrounds us. Although I am being very careful about minimizing the risk of spreading the virus, I refuse to allow it to dominate. What helps maintain normalcy for me is to think about everything I am grateful for. It has also been comforting to connect with classmates via the internet. Why didn’t I do so more often before Covid-19? Will I keep it up after the virus is gone? I hope so. I wish all ’82s and their loved ones good physical and mental health.”\n\nCarol Davis writes: “When I was 12 my greatest dream was to be on the PBS show, Zoom. In the category of being careful of what you wish for, I never thought I’d be on Zoom celebrating Easter or that my son would be finishing his junior year of college on Zoom. The silver lining, of course, is extra time with my son. I most miss live performances, but I am grateful to all the artists and theaters that are connecting with audiences from their homes and puzzles—hours and hours and hours of puzzles.”\n\nCathy Judd Stein writes: “This pandemic confirms for me that community truly depends on innovation and perseverance, powered by heart and hope. How fortunate that Dartmouth ’82s comprise such a community. Our class Compassion Committee is an outstanding example, offering outreach at this time of such immense loss. Additionally, in Massachusetts, a contact tracing collaborative is underway (and being replicated across the nation), aimed at staring this virus down. The program evolved from a roadside call that the governor had with former Dartmouth President Jim Kim (an adopted ’82), who detailed the success of the Partners in Health approach to infectious disease control. The scope of this crisis is overwhelming, but the leader of this new tracing program inspires me with her simple but enduring words: ‘You just have to start and believe that it’s possible.’ We will come out on the other side, greater together, with bigger hearts and stronger hope, motivated by possibility.”\n\nIt is with a very heavy heart that we report the death of a bright ’82 light: Sally Adnopoz Gendler succumbed to a long illness on April 22 with her husband, Steve, and daughters Abigail and Liza at her side. Our class has a new way to leave tributes to other classmates by submitting photos for the “In Memoriam” pages of our ’82 website. Please send tributes and photos to remember deceased classmates to dartmouth1982@gmail.com.\n\n—Jenny Chandler, 3506 Idaho Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20016; jchandlerhauge@gmail.com; David Eichman, 9004 Wonderland Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90046; dme4law@sbcglobal.net\n\nBy the time you read this column, many classmates will be heading to Santa Fe, New Mexico, for our 60th birthday reunion at the Hotel La Posada de Santa Fe. It will take place May 1-3 and include a variety of activities, such as hiking, golf, art walks, visits to museums, biking, and time to just relax and catch up with classmates or make new friends. Thanks to Sue Elliott for organizing such a fun event to celebrate such a birthday milestone for many of us. Stay tuned for a full report of the fun weekend.\n\nThanks to our daily birthday emails, Bill Best and Colin McNay discovered that they shared a birthday. They were high school classmates and never knew that. And Ben Tongue and Laura Morrell Hicks not only share a birthday, but they were born in the same hospital. It is a small world!\n\nAs I write this column, the Iowa caucuses just took place. Mark Weinhardt is a lawyer in Des Moines. His firm specializes in white collar criminal defense and complex business litigation. Mark is listed by Super Lawyers as one of the top 10 attorneys in Iowa and he is the only Iowan among the International Academy of Trial Lawyers 500 attorneys under 70 years of age.\n\nTom French is celebrating his retirement by listening to the mother abbess in The Sound of Music who advised Maria to “Climb Ev’ry Mountain.” Last year Tom and his son, Will, climbed Mount Vinson in Antarctica. Tom traveled to Argentina in January to climb a route on Aconcagua and in March Tom is scheduled to head to Nepal to climb Mount Everest. Above the girdled earth they roam!\n\nMy birthday twin, Marty Jacobs, is making progress on her Ph.D. (after a series of health challenges last year), after successfully defending her dissertation proposal last June and having her institutional review board application accepted in the fall in record time. She is on track to finish this summer and graduate in September. Looking forward to another doctor in the class!\n\nEric Fisher is an architect in Pittsburgh. He writes, “I worked in Berlin for six months as an architect just before I completed grad school in 1987. That was a couple years prior to the wall coming down. I lived near the Ku’damm on Bleibtreustrasse and rowed when I could with the Berliner Ruder Club out in Wannsee. I had many adventures for sure, but the coolest thing I did was take a week off and bicycle from Freiburg over the Gotthard Pass down to Florence.”\n\nThe Dickey Center for International Understanding at Dartmouth is working with our class to put together a panel of speakers on campus in the spring called “Post Great Issues Scholars: Perspectives and Pathways.” This event is supported by the Class of 1982 Fund for Great Issues Innovation, where we are partnering with the class of 1957.\n\nAs we enter a new decade, what is the most interesting place that you visited this past decade and why? Please email me!\n\n—David Eichman, 9004 Wonderland Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90046; dme4law@sbcglobal.net; Jenny Chandler Hauge, 3506 Idaho Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20016; jchandlerhauge@gmail.com\n\nHow does the class of 1982 celebrate a new decade? Carolyn Wilcox Galliette, cofounder, chief investment officer, and president of Ironwood Capital, was named to the 2020 list of most influential women in mid-market mergers and acquisitions, proving that studying James Joyce as an undergrad can lead you anywhere. Gray Reisfield Horan’s musical about early Hollywood is a semifinalist for the 2020 National Music Theater Conference at the Eugene O’Neill Theater in Waterford, Connecticut. Dan Gilman continues his 20-plus-year run as a professional policy geek in the Federal Trade Commission’s office of policy planning (Washington, D.C.). Dr. Nick Holecamp, chief medical officer at Ranken Jordan Pediatric Bridge Hospital, was recognized with the Missouri Foundation for Health’s 2019 Walentik Leadership in Health Award. If you have questions about those grandkids’ health, you know who to ask. And did you see Michael Rafter’s cameo in Marriage Story at the piano while Adam Driver sings “Being Alive”? Guess who coached Mr. Driver through the song? The arc of Robin Shaffert’s career as a disability rights lawyer has taken a local turn. After a decade working on national policy and programs in the disability community, she is now senior policy associate at the Georgetown University Center for Excellence in Developmental Disability and will be focusing on local, D.C. policy issues. Did someone say “retirement”? Nope.After 33 yearsat McKinsey, Tom French is taking a “gap year” to summit a few more big mountains. Mike Donoghue is eschewing retirement to serve as executive director of Catholic Charities for Fairfield County, Connecticut.\n\nAt an ’82 mini-reunion in Washington, D.C., I asked Kathy Boak Dubishar to share a 60th birthday wish. She’d love anything involving traveling with all four children and animal viewing. If a trip to the Arctic to see polar bears doesn’t come through, a little birdy told me that Kathy’s kids may surprise her with a trip to the San Diego Zoo! News from the West Coast includes these milestones shared by Winky Stearns Hussey: “March-August 2019 was pretty momentous for our family. Our daughter had a baby, one son got married, the other son matched for his internal medicine specialty at University of Washington in our hometown of Seattle. Both ‘boys’ bought homes, and on August 3 my husband, Peter, interred his father’s ashes in Maine and my mother died in New Hampshire. So many milestones.” Milestones, indeed. And in recognition of the fact that celebrating life’s milestones also means facing challenges, our class executive committee recently launched ’82 Compassion. This initiative connects classmates to serve as resources for each other. Our class has a long tradition of celebrating birthdays and sending condolence notes, and this initiative offers us other opportunities to show up for each other as a supportive community of ’82s during good times and bad. Thank you to Laura Davis, Sarah Lilja, Robin Shaffert, Cindy Willett Sherwood, Drea Papp Thorne, and Laurie Morris Betts for being among our pioneer ’82 Compassion volunteers. If you’d like to get involved, please drop me a line.\n\nFinally, I am saddened to report that we recently learned that our classmate, Brian Fitzpatrick, died on December 4, 2018. Our thoughts are with his loved ones, family, and friends.\n\n—Jenny Chandler, 3506 Idaho Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20016; jchandlerhauge@gmail.com; David Eichman, 9004 Wonderland Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90046; dme4law@sbcglobal.net\n\nCongratulations to Carol Davis on winning the Class Newsletter Editor of the Year Award during the annual class officers weekend in Hanover in September. The citation that Carol received states, “Your newsletters featured an engaging combination of classmate news and profiles, updates from your fellow class officers, and creative themed content—from ‘Dartmouth Sisters’ to a ‘Chat in the Hat’ interview between classmates. Each newsletter was chock-full of photos, including a 34-page spread featuring your 35th reunion, as well as images from mini-reunions, Homecoming, and your class’ service-themed virtual reunion tied to Dartmouth’s ‘Call to Serve.’ You celebrated your class’ success as Reunion Class of the Year, lifted up class leaders and achievements, and highlighted class projects.” Way to go, Carol! Other class officers in attendance that weekend included George Thompson, Mike Berg, Jon Baker, Matt Hoffman, and Martha Solis Turner.\n\nOne of the themes I would like to explore in this column leading up to our 40th reunion is memories from your first-year dormitory. To begin with, I randomly chose McLane and sent an email to everyone who lived there first year. Becki Ambrose writes: “McLane had a plethora of freshman because most upperclass people found a way to move ‘up campus’ after tiring of the long walk up the hill to get to class. Darren Cde Baca and Charles Williams lived in the room above mine. They were old buddies from their days on the Saint Ignatius football team. When we needed a diversion from our studies, we’d head upstairs to see what they were up to. Our favorite activity was to try to tackle them in the hallway. They’d get in their crouch and three or four of us would run the full length of the hall to try to topple them. We were usually unsuccessful. We would all be invigorated by the contact and then go back to our studies.”\n\nBill Prescott says: “I enjoyed the forest and the trees west of the River Cluster and the easy access to crew practices and beautiful runs on the upstream trail behind Tom Dent Cabin. Coming from drought-stricken California, with golden (i.e., light brown) hills and half-full reservoirs, I couldn’t get over the lush greenery and brimful river. As I recall, McLane itself was an architectural yawn, 1960s cinderblock stark economy throughout. Between that and its distance from classes, food, and other action, I felt envious of classmates living in charming old Mass, Streeter, New Hamp, as well as just about anywhere else on campus.”\n\nAnd Jennifer Jones Cavenaugh shares: “I remember our resident advisor making us brownies, which I thought was awesome, and I ate quite a few of them. Next morning, when I saw the random highlights I had made in my copy of the Odyssey (that night’s homework), I realized that they were pot brownies.”\n\nWishing everyone happy holidays and a wonderful new year 2020—when most of us turn 60!\n\n—David Eichman, 9004 Wonderland Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90046; dme4law@sbcglobal.net; Jenny Chandler Hauge, 3506 Idaho Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20016; jchandlerhauge@gmail.com\n\nAs we reach an age starting with a six, let’s reflect on our first years at Dartmouth. How did President/Professor Kemeny and the advent of personal computing change our trajectories? John Idzik, a mathematics major, recalls that his attraction to Dartmouth stemmed from his love for math…and football. “With a president who invented BASIC as an active faculty member within your major and a football program competing for Ivy League championships, what could be more challenging and fulfilling?” John’s career has been a combination of both passions. After Dartmouth John worked for IBM, pivoting after seven years to coach football. He currently works for the Jacksonville Jaguars. John’s early work as a pro scout for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers included integrating technology into football operations, a role he continued while working with the Arizona Cardinals, Seattle Seahawks, New York Jets, and now the Jaguars. He’s witnessed the technological transformation of the game firsthand: “From 16mm film to digital video and from hard copy coaching and scouting reports to web-based football applications, for me it all started at Dartmouth under the watch of President Kemeny.” Professor Walter Cressler is experiencing the technology revolution in his role as chair of the department of university libraries at West Chester University. As librarians retire and he hires younger more tech-savvy replacements, “Pretty soon I’ll be the only one of my colleagues who remembers when desktop computers were a thing.” For fun, Walter, formerly a geology professor, is working on a digital app to create GPS-coordinated themed walking trails as a way of investigating whether digital technology can get people more engaged with their landscapes for both personal and environmental health. Cathy Green Solomon recollects: “One of the best courses I took at Dartmouth was President Kemeny’s. I was starstruck at first to be in the classroom with a brilliant mathematician and our revered college president, but his unassuming manner put us all quickly at ease. I’ll never forget walking out of the final exam when he handed us copies of the answers. Why? He explained that we would never again be so focused on the material, so seeing the solutions in the moment would reinforce the learning when our brains were most receptive.” Cathy’s carrying that lesson forward in her new role as chief financial officer of N Street Village in Washington, D.C., which empowers homeless and low-income women to achieve stability in housing, employment, mental and physical health, and addiction recovery. To close the loop on how technology is changing our lives, we’re now at an age to celebrate both grandparenting and joint replacement! Congrats to Sue Ringler Pet and Pacey Pet, Ralph McDevitt, and Sarah Riddle Lilja (new grandparents) and Dana Burroughs Klinges, who’s already been skiing with her new ACL. In closing, it is with fond memories of our classmate and deep condolences to his family and friends that we report the death of Robert G. Lasko Jr. of North Branford, Connecticut, on August 6.\n\n—Jenny Chandler Hauge, 3506 Idaho Ave., NW Washington, DC 20016; jchandlerhauge@gmail.com; David Eichman, 9004 Wonderland Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90046; dme4law@sbcglobal.net\n\nCongratulations to Danny Black, who began his four-year term on the College board of trustees on July 1. Gail Koziara Boudreaux and Jim Coulter both finished their terms as trustee in June. While Danny is thrilled to begin this new role serving Dartmouth, he is also sad that he has to resign as president of our class. Danny writes, “I will always treasure the opportunity to have served on the class executive committee and cannot thank the members enough for their hard work. It has also been enormously rewarding to get to know so many whom I did not know well during our undergraduate days.” We are grateful that Danny served as class president 12 times longer than William Henry Harrison served as president of the United States.\n\nSo who will now serve as president of the class for the next four years, i.e., until our 40th reunion? I hope that by now you have heard the good news that the class executive committee unanimously approved George Thompson as our new class president. A nominating committee consisting of Carol Davis, David Plekenpol, and Ralph McDevitt solicited nominations and then vetted candidates. In his statement of interest, George wrote, “I am flattered by the nomination by one of my classmates, and I am interested in serving our class. I have derived much from my Dartmouth experiences and the enduring relationships that have followed our graduation. I view the opportunity to serve as an opportunity to give back to the great class of 1982.” George previously served as class co-secretary with Phillipa Guthrie many years ago. Phillipa writes that George “was a wonderful partner in crime: reliable, responsive, imaginative, and inclusive with a very funny but kindly wit.” George has also served as the treasurer of the Dartmouth Club of Central Massachusetts. He is an attorney based in Westborough, Massachusetts, where he has been an active community member, including serving on the Westborough board of selectmen. One of George’s goals for the class is to continue developing a compassionate classmate program that matches volunteers with classmates who feel isolated or are having health challenges. Class Officers Weekend this year is September 20-21, and we look forward to meeting with our new president in Hanover.\n\nAs I write this column, Tee Lotson has one more week left as president of the Dartmouth Alumni Council. I hear there will be a class gathering at the Peninsula Hotel in Manhattan at the end of June to celebrate Tee’s accomplishments. Thanks, Tee, for all your service to our alma mater, especially this past year!\n\nI hope that you have made plans to return to Hanover for Homecoming Weekend, October 11-12. Talks are underway with the Dickey Center for International Understanding for a panel discussion to mark the 10th anniversary of the Great Issues Scholars program. There will also be a pre-game mini-reunion on October 12 from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. at Blunt Alumni Center.

Here are their reports. Marrin Robinson, a painter and academic success coordinator at Arizona State University, wrote: “Professor Ashley Bryan was a wonderful inspiration, and I’m still in touch with him. He is still publishing books at age 90-plus. We write regularly, and I’ve visited him on his island in Maine a few times! Painting with Jonathan Marvel and Jay Mead in Italy on our art history study abroad was great. The camaraderie of all the ’82 art majors was wonderful. Dartmouth prepared me for getting a Fulbright grant to Portugal the year after I graduated and propelled me into grad school, where I had a full tuition scholarship. I started teaching as an art professor right after that. Now I’m advising dance and theater students at Arizona State University, which is a lot of fun. And I have a studio in my home in Sedona [Arizona], where I paint. Would love to see anyone passing through!” Jim Mott, best known for his passion, “the itinerant artist project,” shared: “In retrospect I’d have to say the camaraderie among the art majors—and, within that, the sense of shared, earnest purpose as artists—was the most valuable thing about my art experience at Dartmouth. It helped to fortify me for the journey ahead, which is so often about holding onto faith in art’s value as a way to articulate a vital sense of meaning while navigating a path between the seeming indifference of the public, on the one hand, and the ironic indifference of the artworld game players on the other.” Leslie Fleming, now residing in Hawaii, reminisces: “The Hood was built after we left Dartmouth. They were planning for it our senior spring. The architectural firm was on campus then, and I remember helping them do some measurements for their plans. I had taken two architecture courses earlier that year at Dartmouth and felt quite honored to do this. There weren’t too many art majors in our class so we were a pretty tight-knit group. My favorite class was an advanced painting class with Ashley Bryan. We had class in a building near the steam plant and were able to paint at all hours of the night—unlike at the Hop, where we were booted out at midnight. I still think of Ashley when I paint now, which is not often enough, as I am more likely to be teaching art to elementary school students through the Honolulu Museum of Art (where I first took art classes as a child!).” Carol Davis,our class newsletter editor, wrote: “I was an art history major who ended up going to law school. Thirty-five years after graduation I am training to be a docent at a local museum in Hartford, Connecticut, and am very much looking forward to (finally) putting my major to use. Can’t wait to see the new Hood!”\n\n—Jenny Chandler Hauge, 3506 Idaho Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20016; jchandlerhauge@gmail.com; David Eichman, 9004 Wonderland Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90046; dme4law@sbcglobal.net\n\nHappy spring! I hope that you are enjoying longer days and warmer weather. It is hard to believe that another summer will soon be here. Many of us have recently experienced the death of a parent. I wanted to dedicate this column to our parents, so I asked several classmates whose mother or father died this past year to share some thoughts regarding that parent and Dartmouth. Thanks to all of you who responded!\n\nBeth Johnston Stephenson writes, “When my high school guidance counselor suggested that I consider applying to certain small Midwestern colleges, my dad, Thomas Watts Johnston, gave a metaphorical ‘hmphh’ and promptly took me east for visits to schools he considered more appropriate. He and Mom visited for Parents and Homecoming weekends, remembering the lectures by David Lagomarsino and Don Pease better than I did.”\n\nScott Simmons shared the following: “I first saw Dartmouth in the summer of 1966, age 5. My big sister, about to enter her senior year in high school, my dad and I were making the college circuit. Although Dartmouth wasn’t coed yet, Hanover was our layover for a night. My one vivid memory of our stopover was standing in the middle of the football field, biggest thing I’d ever seen, holding my dad’s hand, saying, ‘Dad, I want to go to college here.’ ”\n\nWinky Stearns Hussey writes the following about her father, John P. Stearns ’49: “When I was about 14 I told Dad I wanted to go to Dartmouth. He said they had only recently started admitting women and it might be a hard place to attend (especially after going to an all-girls school in New York!"
