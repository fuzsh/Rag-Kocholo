        "text": "USING A CRANE NEAR THE LEBANON AIRPORT\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration requires a permit for ANY crane work within a 3-mile radius of any airport. The distance may be increased if the work is in the direct line of a runway – considered to be within the “glide path” of aircraft during takeoff or landing. The glide path is defined as a 1 foot per 100 feet slope beginning at the closest point of any runway. Work may be allowed if the max. height of the crane is below the glide path after compensations for topographical elevations are calculated.\n\nYou must file with the FAA at least 45 days prior to construction if:\n\nany construction or alteration that exceeds an imaginary surface extending outward and upward at any of the following slopes:\n\n100 to 1 for a horizontal distance of 20,000 ft. from the nearest point of the nearest runway of each airport described in 14 CFR 77.9(d) with its longest runway more than 3,200 ft. in actual length, excluding heliports\n\n50 to 1 for a horizontal distance of 10,000 ft. from the nearest point of the nearest runway of each airport described in 14 CFR 77.9(d) with its longest runway no more than 3,200 ft. in actual length, excluding heliports\n\n25 to 1 for a horizontal distance of 5,000 ft. from the nearest point of the nearest landing and takeoff area of each heliport described in 14 CFR 77.9(d);\n\nOR any highway, railroad, waterway or other traverse way for mobile objects, of a height which, if adjusted upward as defined in 14 CFR 77.9(c) would exceed a standard of 14 CFR 77.9 (a) or (b);\n\nOR your structure will emit frequencies, and does not meet the conditions of the FAA Co-location Policy;\n\nOR your proposed structure will be in proximity to a navigation facility and may impact the assurance of navigation signal reception;\n\nOR any construction or alteration exceeding 200 feet above ground level, regardless of location;\n\nOR any construction or alteration located on an airport described in 14 CFR 77.9(d);\n\nOR filing has been requested by the FAA.\n\nIf you require additional information regarding the filing requirements for your structure, please identify and contact the appropriate FAA representative using the Air Traffic Areas of Responsibility map for Off Airport construction, or contact the FAA Airports Region / District Office for On Airport construction.\n\nThe FAA hosts a web-based tool to assist contractors in determining if a hazard exists and if an FAA Permit is required at: https://oeaaa.faa.gov/oeaaa/external/portal.jsp\n\nThe consequences of not having an FAA permit are:\n\n1) the Jobsite will be shut down and\n\n2) a substantial fine.\n\nOver the past five years, the city has actively collaborated with the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NHDES), as well as the UNH Technology Transfer (T2) Road Scholar program. Yearly, NHDES hosts an annual Salt Symposium. Attendees are updated with the latest snow industry technologies and best management practices. This symposium also fulfills the ongoing educational requirements for our Certified Green SnowPro Applicators, ensuring our team remains at the forefront of industry standards and environmental stewardship.\n\nTo align with sustainable environmental practices, the city embarked on a significant initiative in 2019 aimed at reducing the use of anti-icing agents. We have successfully decreased our salt application rate from an initial 700 pounds per lane mile to a more efficient 400 pounds per lane mile, occasionally applying even less than the NHDES's recommended rate under favorable conditions. This reduction not only reflects our commitment to environmental health but also highlights the effectiveness of our precision-driven application strategies.\n\nThrough the annual calibration of DPW vehicles, salt spreaders, and wet application systems, the city ensures the proper application of anti-icing agents. All vehicles used for winter operations are equipped with electronic application rate systems, which enable precise control over the amount of material dispersed per lane mile, adjusted automatically in response to the vehicle's speed. This technology ensures uniform and optimal coverage, minimizing waste and environmental impact.\n\nDepending on temperatures, the city can also use a supplement treatment of magnesium chloride. Magnesium Chloride is a wet product that is applied at the spinner to rock salt as it is being laid down. The application of Magnesium Chloride at the point of dispersion, acts as an immediate reactor, enhancing the efficacy of salt brine in combating ice formation. Magnesium Chloride can only be applied at temperatures less than 25 degrees Fahrenheit as the application above could create a slippery surface on the roadway. At times if the city is ensured temperatures will not climb above 25 degrees Fahrenheit, residents will notice multiple wet lines within the roadways. This is an indicator that magnesium chloride was applied to the roadway before a storm to help reduce pack on the road from vehicles, as well as to assist with the reduction in salt/anti-icing agents.\n\nThe City of Lebanon Department of Public Works staff is always looking for the best ways to keep our roads safe in winter while also taking care of our environment.\n\nThe right to a speedy, public, and impartial trial is guaranteed to every citizen by the United States Constitution, as well as the New Hampshire Constitution. In Circuit Court, the case is tried without a jury, and the Judge performs the jury's function of weighing the evidence, determining the credibility of witnesses, and issuing a verdict.\n\nAt trial, the prosecutor introduces the State's case first, and calls witnesses to testify. Those witnesses take an oath to tell the truth issued by the Judge, or the attorney asking the questions. The prosecutor then conducts a direct examination of the witnesses, and is required to ask open-ended questions designed for the witness to tell their story. The defense attorney then conducts a cross examination of the witness, and will likely ask only leading questions designed to tell the accused’s story, or designed to make a specific point that is instrumental to the defense. The prosecutor will then have a second opportunity to ask open-ended questions in a redirect examination, followed by the defense attorney having a second opportunity to conduct a recross examination. The redirect and recross examinations are typically much shorter than the initial questioning, and sometimes, are not even necessary.\n\nFollowing the testimony of all of the State’s witnesses and introduction of all of its evidence, the State will rest its case. Typically, for procedural and tactical reasons, the defense attorney will immediately ask the judge to dismiss the case. If the Judge denies the request to dismiss at that time, the defense attorney will have an opportunity to call its witnesses to testify, or to call the accused himself/herself to testify. The accused is not required to submit any evidence of any kind. If the defense does call witnesses, that testimony will follow the same outline the prosecutor followed in the first half of the trial. The defense will rest at the end of their presentation of evidence as the State previously did.\n\nAfter the State and defense have both rested, the Judge will make a determination whether the State proved the elements of charged offenses beyond a reasonable doubt. Sometimes the Judge will ask for arguments from the prosecutor or defense before making a decision. If the Judge determines that the State met the beyond a reasonable doubt burden of proof, they will find the accused guilty. If not, the Judge will find the accused not guilty.\n\nWitnesses in most criminal cases will be served a subpoena to appear in court. The subpoena is a record for the Prosecutor that the witness was notified, and demonstrates to the Court that the State has made a good faith effort to proceed with the case. The subpoena places the witness under a legal obligation to appear at the listed date and time for the hearing, and to remain until the trial is completed or the witness is excused.\n\nIn a criminal case in the State of New Hampshire, the only “parties” to a case are the accused and the State of New Hampshire. Only the State of New Hampshire and the accused can file motions with the court in the criminal matter. If a witness is unavailable, it is critical that they notify the prosecutor so that a motion to reschedule can be filed, but the decision to reschedule is ultimately up to the Judge. Failing to be present at court on the date and time listed on a subpoena may result in criminal contempt charges, possible fines, jail time, and/or probation.\n\nWitnesses should appear at least fifteen minutes before the listed trial time to review any statements which had been given to the Police and have any questions answered. If you arrive early, look for the Officer who investigated the incident, or the Prosecutor.\n\nTRIAL DATE AND TIME\n\nThe dates and times of court trials are set by the Clerk of Court's office at the Lebanon Circuit Court. The Clerk sends a scheduling notice to the Police Department and other parties, and then the prosecutor’s office issues subpoenas to any non-law enforcement witnesses. The dates or times of a Court date can only be changed by the Judge after a motion is filed by either by the State or the accused.\n\nThere are times when a case does not proceed to trial at the time listed on the Court Docket. The delay is often a result of an earlier scheduled case taking more time than was anticipated by the Court. The Police Department has no control over these scenarios. These delays typically do not last very long without the Court making some accommodations, however there may be exceptions.\n\nThere are also times when a case does not proceed to trial because a non-trial resolution is reached just before trial. Typically, the prosecutor has advanced notice of plea agreements, and their office will notify witnesses prior to trial that they are released from their subpoenas. However, unfortunately in those cases that an agreement is reached shortly before trial begins, advanced notice is not possible.\n\nATTIRE\n\nThere are no specific requirements for court attire. However, the Court is a professional environment and demands respect from all who enter. It is recommended that all who attend are well groomed and wear business, or business casual clothing. Additionally, while not required, it is recommended that arrangements for child care be made ahead of the date and time of trial.\n\nSEQUESTRATION\n\nIt is possible that the Judge may order the sequestration of witnesses. The intent is to ensure that the testimony of one witness will not influence the testimony of another. If sequestration is ordered, each witness who may be called to give testimony in a trial will be instructed not to discuss his or her testimony or any aspect of the case with anybody, either before or after he or she testifies, until the trial is over. When sequestered, witnesses will not be allowed to observe any other testimony prior to their testimony. Violation of an order of sequestration may result in a mistrial, and/or criminal contempt charges against the violating witness.\n\nFEES\n\nWitnesses who are subpoenaed to appear in the Lebanon Circuit Court are allowed a witness fee, set by the State of New Hampshire, for each day or part of a day they are in attendance. The State also pays a mileage fee, set by the State of New Hampshire, round trip to the Courthouse. The witness fee and mileage allowance are combined in one check.\n\nUpon arrival at Court, you will check in with the Court Bailiffs or at the Clerk's Office. You will need to fill out paperwork to ensure compensation. Once you are done testifying, you need to report back to the Clerk's Office. The Clerk will send your compensation request to the State of New Hampshire. Witnesses should expect several weeks before payment is received.\n\nTESTIFYING TIPS\n\nSit comfortably, but maintain good posture and an alert appearance.\n\nTell only the truth about what you have personal knowledge of.\n\nSpeak naturally and calmly in a distinct and clearly audible tone of voice. Describe the events of the case in the order in which they took place.\n\nMaintain a courteous attitude, self-control and personal composure. Avoid any impression of being contentious or biased. The use of \"Your Honor\" when responding to the Judge and \"Sir or Ma'am\" when answering the attorneys, is appropriate.\n\nAvoid making sarcastic or derogatory remarks, even if you feel baited to do so. Remaining calm and replying in a straight forward manner adds to your credibility.\n\nRespond to questions without expressing personal views or drawing conclusions.\n\nDo not volunteer information or go beyond the scope of the questions asked.\n\nLook directly at the person asking the question. If you do not hear or do not understand the question, request that it be repeated. Pause briefly and consider the question before answering.\n\nDo not guess! If you do not remember or do not know a particular fact, simply say so.\n\nAttorneys may object to a particular question or to certain testimony. When an objection is made, do not begin to answer or continue an answer until the objection is ruled on. Follow the instructions of the Judge.\n\nIf you make a mistake in testimony, voluntarily correct the error as soon as possible.\n\nVICTIMS – RIGHTS\n\nVictims of certain offenses in the State of New Hampshire are entitled to additional rights than a typical witness. For more information, see http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/I/21-M/21-M-8-k.htm. If you are a victim pursuant to the laws of the State of New Hampshire, an advocate from the Grafton County Attorney’s Office or the Lebanon Prosecutor will reach out to you as soon as possible to update you on the status of the pending matter."
