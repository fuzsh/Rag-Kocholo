        "text": "History\n\nTennisclub Albertus Magnus was founded on December 3rd, 1963 by Dirk van de Sandt and Sjriek Konings. Nowadays, the colours our club uses are purple and white. In the past however, our color was green, directly acquired from Albertus Magnus.\n\nNowadays, TAM has more than 500 members, more than 30 teams and more than 20 committees but way back, in 1996, TAM ‘only’ had 220 members, 13 teams and 6 committees, which means TAM has experienced a remarkable growth. In the old days, TAM was known for playing on a more recreative level and was barely focusing on achieving exceeding results. That changed mid-1990s when TAM came in contact with (inter)national top-tennis.\n\nWhere in the 90s the focus was shifting towards a more performance-oriented attitude, the real breakthrough was starting in the zeroes. The first steps towards a policy regarding top tier players were made. Through this policy and the arrival of trainer Frank Schmitz in the year 2002-2003, the goal was set to position TAM as the highest-ranking student tennis association. A title that TAM still proudly holds today. With this, TAM 1 has been established as TC BOO (There Can Be Only One) from 2004 onwards.\n\nProfessionalizing TAM was accompanied by the emergence of a PR policy. The TAM clothing line was expanded and various accessories were devised to represent TAM throughout the country. During this period (2006), the well-known and annual Dutch Mini Tennis Championship was organized by TAM for the first time. During this period we also visited the external tournament in Lelystad for the first time (2007). A tournament we still visit every year with about 50 enthusiastic TAM members.\n\nIn the period from 2009 to 2016, TAM experienced a great period. In 2009, TAM launched its new website, which facilitated a better communication between the board and the members. Also in 2009, TC BOO promoted to the first league on Sunday (the second highest amateur level in the Netherlands) for the first time ever. In 2011-2012, a separate website was launched, specifically aimed at recruiting selection players: \"www.tennisenstuderen.nl\". In 2014 TC BOO again promoted to the first league and managed to maintain this position for the first time in history in 2015.\n\nMeanwhile, the association continued to grow. A member stop had to be introduced in order not to decrease the quality of the TAM membership. There was also a reformation of the committees of TAM. Many new committees were introduced and more and more activities next to tennis emerged. Also, more money was invested in our club magazine and anuary, which was first printed in color in 2012. The joint activities with Albertus were also further upgraded during this period. In 2012, the first house-tournament was organized, just like the ‘I AM Clinic’, which is an event on the first monday of the Academic Year for first-year Albertians.\n\n2013 was a year full of highlights. A new clubhouse, including roof terrace, was built and grandly opened on May 24th by Paul Haarhuis. Also, at the end of that year, the 50th anniversary of the club was celebrated exuberantly.\n\nAchieving the first league on Sunday was a dream for TAM. The preservation in 2015 and the following years was the result of numerous trainings and perseverance. But achieving a goal creates a new one: TC BOO in the main league on Sunday (the highest amateur level in the Netherlands). This goal was not achieved when the main league denied our application in 2017. However, by performing even better the following year, TC BOO managed to win enough points to reach the main league on its own! An unprecedented achievement of our first team with the help of trainers and coaches Frank Schmitz and Paul van Lier.\n\nTAM Mission Statement\n\nThe mission statement of the association is: “To practice and promote the sport of tennis, and to advance the social life of its members.”\n\nCommittees\n\nTAM would not be as much fun as it is without its many committees. With approximately 20 committees there are many opportunities for everyone, including freshmen to become an active member of our association.\n\nTAM has tennis-related committees such as the Tournament Committee which organizes our Open Tournament (400 participants) and the NK-Mini Committee which organizes the Dutch Championship Mini Tennis. Besides tennis relates committees, we have committees such as the Bar Committee, Film Committee, Ski Committee and many others.\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTennisclub Albertus Magnus attaches great importance to the protection of your personal data.
