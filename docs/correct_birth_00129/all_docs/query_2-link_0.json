        "text": "Together with Jacco Eltingh, Paul Haarhuis formed one of the top doubles teams in men’s tennis in the 1990s. Although less successful than the Australian “Woodies” (Woodforde and Woodbridge, they won a total of 39 titles, including 5 Grand Slams with two titles at Roland Garros and one each at the other Slams. They also won the Masters Cup, the unofficial World Championships, twice (1993 and 1998). Although favoured for a medal at the 1996 Olympics, they missed out, being eliminated by their Australian rivals in the semi-finals, after 34 games in the third set. With Yevgeni Kafelnikov, Haarhuis won a 6th Grand Slam in 2002. He also won one ATP tournament in singles (Jakarta 1995), and reached the quarter-finals of the 1991 U.S. Open, losing out to Jimmy Connors. After his retirement from professional tennis, Haarhuis and Eltingh set up a company organizing tennis clinics, competitions and training camps."
