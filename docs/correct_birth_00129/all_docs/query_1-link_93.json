        "text": "Following September’s group stage qualifications, 16 teams have dwindled to 8 as the 2022 Davis Cup heads towards its conclusion. Between November 22 and 27, the biggest stars from professional tennis will represent their country in Malaga for the tournament’s knockout rounds.\n\nThrough the exceptional talent displayed during the four Group Stage venues, we’ve highlighted the teams who delivered outstanding performances and the most notable players from each nation.\n\nItaly\n\nHaving already defeated the pre-tournament favorites Croatia in the opening contest, the Italian team captained by Filippo Volandri won Group A and has evolved into one of the teams to beat when the Final 8 commences in Malaga. As Matteo Berrettini collected three singles wins and Jannik Sinner is alongside, the Italians are boasting a dangerous No.1 and No.2.\n\nItaly has progressed beyond the Group Stage of the Davis Cup for the first time in their three tournament appearances. Despite winning the competition on only one occasion, they’ve been a runner-up six times.\n\nMatteo Berrettini (ITA)\n\nBerrettini was a crucial team member for the Italian squad and a major part of their Group A winning efforts. The 26-year-old from Rome cruised to victory in all three of his singles matches, including a successful outing against Croatia’s Borna Coric – the No.1 ranked team entering the competition.\n\nHeading into his final singles meeting, Croatia posted two wins, and it came down to the wire for the coveted top spot. However, Berrettini kept his composure and won a crucial match against Elias Ymer to assist Italy in taking the first-place position in Group A.\n\nUSA\n\nAs the first-ever Davis Cup champion in 1990 and the owner of more titles than any other nation in the competition’s history (32), the pressure is always on the United States to perform well at the Davis Cup. However, recent history hasn’t been kind to the Stars and Stripes, who’ve failed to qualify for the knockout rounds in 2019 and 2021.\n\nThe excellent news, Davis Cup veteran Mardy Fish, has guided the US squad beyond the group stages this year. Rajeev Ram, Jack Sock, and Taylor Fritz will have all eyes on them as the United States attempts to replicate history and win the Davis Cup once again.\n\nTaylor Fritz (USA)\n\nCalifornia-born Fritz is a world No.12 ranked competitor and a strong candidate to reach the Davis Cup Finals in Malaga. Fritz and his teammate Tommy Paul propelled the USA to the top of Group D in their bid to qualify for the Final 8 with successive victories over Kazakhstan. These performances are why California sports betting enthusiasts flock to the window with their tickets in favor of Fritz.\n\nFrom a betting perspective, Fritz is an ideal wager and will lead his team in singles matches alongside a double’s tag team of Rajeev Ram and Jack Sock. Outside of Fritz’ elite ranking, Ram is notably the world number two ranked in doubles and recently retained the US Open title when winning the Men’s Doubles competition.\n\nNetherlands\n\nThe Netherlands entered the Davis Cup and were expected to crash out of the group stages, but to the surprise of many, the Dutch team evolved into one of the underdogs to watch out for. Captained by Paul Haarhuis and led by sensational performances from Botic van de Zandschulp, the Netherlands avoided group elimination and won Group D in Glasgow to secure their position in the Davis Cup knockout stages.\n\nThe Dutch team has never reached a Davis Cup final and has yet to go beyond the semi-finals in the competition’s history.\n\nBotic van de Zandschulp (NED)\n\nWith three consecutive victories in his singles meetings, Zandschulp wowed the audience when overcoming the likes of No.8 Cameron Norrie and No.12 Taylor Fritz in straight-set wins.\n\nDespite having a 2-0 record, the Dutch refused to slow down heading into the final fixtures of the group stage. Having already assisted in eliminating Great Britain, a battle for first place in Group D came down to a meeting between Zandschulp and Fritz. The Dutchman secured his third win over Fritz to ensure his team entered Malaga as Group D winners.\n\nDavis Cup Finals 2022 Schedule\n\nQUARTER-FINALS\n\n22 November\n\nAustralia vs. Netherlands\n\n23 November\n\nCroatia vs. Spain\n\n24 November\n\nItaly vs. USA\n\nGermany vs. Canada\n\nSEMI-FINALS\n\n25 November\n\nAustralia or Netherlands vs. Croatia or Spain\n\n26 November\n\nItaly or USA vs. Germany or Canada\n\nFINAL\n\n27 November\n\nFinalist vs. Finalist\n\n🎾 Free >> Join our legendary newsletter\n\n🎾 Join >> Receive $700/£600 of tennis gear from the Tennishead CLUB\n\n🎾 Social >> Facebook, Twitter, Instagram & YouTube\n\n🎾 Read >> World’s best tennis magazine\n\n🎾 Watch >> How to enjoy ATP/WTA/Slam tennis on TV\n\n🎾 Shop >> Lowest price tennis gear from our trusted partner"
