Details such as food and drink preparations, events management checklists, DJ setups, repair and maintenance, and table decor (to name a few) are thought through before an event. It takes a dedicated team to create success at a large event like Berry's Tennis Event. So, let's give those working behind the scenes some appreciation. #teamwork #hospitalitymanagement #eventmanagement #tennisevent #corporatehospitality\n\nOur newest venture at Hazlewood Castle & Spa, The Secret Forest, officially opens for the school summer holidays tomorrow. üëè A children's adventure trail through the woodlands at Hazlewood Castle, the trail explore the 'Myths of Hazlewood' through an interactive children's experience. From musical instruments to climbing frames, we hope that the forest allows children's imagination to grow as they discover new stories. So far, The Secret Forest has been open on weekends, and has been a success with some great reviews. We hope that The Secret Forest grows from strength to strength in the summer months, and hopefully we see some good weather too! #childrensplay #interactiveplayareas #childrensadventures #thingstodoyorkshire\n\nBerry's Tennis Event silent auction. ü§´ At Berry's tennis this year, we set the goal to raise money for Martin House Children's Hospice, and we did so through a silent auction. We would like to thank all those who participated in this auction and Impulse Decisions for handling the event.\n\nThe finest hospitality at Hazlewood Castle for Berry's Tennis Event.

To top it off, the sun was shining throughout. Throughout the three days, we raised funds for Martin House Children's Hospice, and their newest venture THE BUILD, in which the charity is building a new hospice in Yorkshire. It was great to see so many of our guests donating, and we thank you for this. Berry's Tennis is a one-of-a-kind corporate hospitality event, and we hope all our guests enjoyed the event as much as we enjoyed hosting it.
