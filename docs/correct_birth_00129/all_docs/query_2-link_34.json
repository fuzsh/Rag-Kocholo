        "text": "Ken Rosewall (born November 2, 1934, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia) is an Australian tennis player who was a major competitor for 25 years, winning 18 Grand Slam titles, 8 of which were in men’s singles.\n\nAlthough he was short and had a slight build, Rosewall remained a powerful force in tennis far longer than many stronger players and was never badly injured. In 1953 he won his first major titles, the Australian and French singles and (with fellow Australian Lew Hoad) the Australian, French, and Wimbledon doubles titles. Two years later he captured his second Australian Open singles title. In 1956 he and Hoad combined to take the Davis Cup from the United States and were also victorious in several international doubles championships.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nGreat Moments in Sports Quiz"
