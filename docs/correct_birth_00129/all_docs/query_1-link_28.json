        "text": "Other major accomplishments as a singles’ player were: in 1985 he reached the quarter-finals of the French Open and Wimbledon, the latter included a dazzling win over world no. 2, Ivan Lendl; in 1986 he reached two Grand Slam singles semi-finals at the French Open and Wimbledon.\n\nHowever his greatest success as a single player at a Grand Slam was reaching the finals at the 1988 French Open on home soil at Roland Garros, beating Simon Youl, Bruno Orešar, Horacio de la Peña, Boris Becker, Andrei Chesnokov and Jonas Svensson. There he was defeated by the Swede, two-time former champion Mats Wilander.\n\nLeconte also won ten doubles titles during his professional tennis career: Bologna in 1981; Nice, Basel and Vienna in 1982; Aix-en-Provence in 1983; Roland Garros, Kitzbühel & Stockholm 1984; Nice in 1988; Indian Wells in 1993. He compiled a doubles record of 17-5 and was undefeated with his doubles partner, Guy Forget, in the 11 matches they’ve played together. He won his last 14 double matches from March 1985 to July 1993.\n\nPaul turned pro in 1988 after getting a degree in Economics at Florida State University\n\nDuring his career he won 1 ATP singles title and his highest singles ranking was number 18 in the world\n\nBut It was in doubles that Paul truly excelled\n\nHe won 54 doubles titles, 6 Grand Slam doubles titles, and with Jacco Eltigh, was the first team ever to win all slams\n\nPaul spent 69 weeks at the world number one position in doubles.\n\nSince retiring in 2003 Paul has maintained his interest in tennis and has been the Dutch Davis Cup captain since 2018\n\nXavier Malisse is a retired Belgian tennis player. Born in the north-western Flemish city of Kortrijk and nicknamed X-Man, he is only one of two players from Belgium (the other being David Goffin) to have been ranked in the world top 20.\n\nXavier trained as a junior at the world renowned Nick Bollitieri Academy in Florida.\n\nHe reached a ranking of number 10 in the world junior rankings in 1997 and the next year Xavier turned pro.\n\nHis best performance in singles at a grand slam was at Wimbledon in 2002 when he reached the semi final, beating\n\nGreg Rudeski and Richard Krajicek en route.\n\nXavier won the French Open doubles with his partner Olivier Rochus in 2004 and in 2005 he won the first of his 3 ATP tour titles at Delray beach.\n\nXavier now coaches Australian player Alexei Popyrin\n\nTennis has a been part of Miles’s life since the age of 8. He became hooked and decided he wanted to become a professional, which drove him to win scholarships to Millfield and The University of New Mexico. He turned Professional in 2010 and by 2011 he was the worlds top 1200 in singles and 700 in doubles after winning a tournament in Cuba, where he beat Victor Estrella Brugess (top 100 player). Due to a couple injuries he never reached his potential and retired after competing at the Queens Championships in 2014 and soon turned his hand to modelling. Miles is still involved in the game and practices with all the worlds best, from Djokovic at Wimbledon to John McEnroe at The Royal Albert Hall and now here at Berry's Tennis Hazlewood castle.\n\nMiles has been travelling the world as a model for the last 10 years. Starting his career in London he worked for brands such as Dunhill, Ted Baker, Ben Sherman, Barbour, Purdey, schoffel, to name a few. He worked in Japan for two months and then moved to Sydney for 3 years. This past year he has been working between LA, NYC and Sydney. Most recently shooting a lot of underwear and swimwear for brands like Tommy Hilfiger, Bombas, Jocky, Orlebar Brown. This past year he has also worked with American brands such as Wrangler jeans and Eddie Bauer. He has also been trying his hand in acting, working on the Tag Heuer commercial with Ryan Gosling and even auditioned for the new tennis movie Challengers."
