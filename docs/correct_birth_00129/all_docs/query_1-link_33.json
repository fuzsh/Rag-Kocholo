        "text": "ASHEVILLE – Carrington Brown leapt out of her seat as news of Serena Williams’ new doubles partner was announced on the loud speaker by U.S captain Kathy Rinaldi at the U.S. Cellular Center.\n\nBrown, 10, traveled from Memphis, Tennessee, in hopes to watch Serena and Venus Williams play in the opening round of the Fed Cup. She never thought she’d get to see them play together.\n\n“I was like, 'Oh my god,' Brown said. “I’m losing my mind.”\n\nThe U.S team’s 3-1 first round Fed Cup win over the Netherlands was highlighted by Serena’s return to competitive tennis for the first time since the birth of her child, Alexis Olympia. Serena suffered post-birth complications that kept her bed-ridden for six weeks.\n\nThe Williams sisters lost their doubles match 6-2, 6-3 to the Netherlands’ Lesley Kerkhove and Demi Shuurs in a match that did nothing to change the outcome of the weekend. The Americans won all three singles matches over the weekend, including CoCo Vandweghe's exciting three-set win over Richel Hogenkamp to give the U.S a 2-0 lead going into Sunday.\n\n“It felt really good to be back on the court,” Serena said. “I’ve been training and it’s exciting to be out there. A lot of, not nerves, but anticipation for myself, but that’s good, that’s normal.”\n\nNetherlands captain Paul Haarhuis called the doubles win a “very small tissue for a big gapping cut.”\n\nDespite his criticism of the court condition throughout the Fed Cup, Haarhuis thanked the City of Asheville and its fans for the hospitality.\n\n“The people from Asheville came on very friendly and we very much enjoyed our stay here,” Haarhuis said. “But in the end, we came to Asheville for the tennis, not the sight-seeing or meeting friendly people. In that matter, we leave empty-handed.”\n\nWhile Serena’s return drew the most anticipation from fans and media, it was the play of Venus that ended the Netherlands’ upset bid against the USA.\n\nWilliams defeated Arantxa Rus 6-1, 6-4 in the Fed Cup’s opening match on Saturday and advanced her team to the semi-finals in April against France with a 7-5, 6-1 win over Richel Hogenkamp. She said Saturday that the Asheville crowd made her “proud” to be competing on the international level again.\n\nIt was the first time either Serena or Venus competed in the Fed Cup since 2015. They have 34 combined singles wins in the Fed Cup and seven doubles wins.\n\n“I didn’t know what to expect, maybe that’s why I felt like I did better than I expected,” Serena said. “I didn’t expect to have that much power on my serves, even if they didn’t go in. It’s just a start, and a very good step in the right direction.”\n\nThe late emergence of the Williams sister on the U.S. team roster brought Asheville and international tennis fans to the U.S. Cellular Center in full force. Attendance reached sell-out levels of 5,208 each day, with fans showing up in spirited costumes on each side.\n\nCathy Jones wore an American flag tank top, red, white and blue arm bands and stuck two small American flags in her hair. She grew up playing tennis in Chicago and moved to Asheville 20 years ago.\n\n“I wanted to do something badass,” Jones said. “Something strong, colorful and bold for Team USA. I think it’s amazing we have a professional women’s tennis event in Asheville that showed everyone how strong women can be in sports.”\n\nThe Fed Cup brought in tourists from all over the country and internationally. City officials told the Citizen-Times they believed the economic impact of hosting the event is about $3.5 million. The USTA, USTA North Carolina and USTA Southern also combined to donate $35,000 to aid in the Aston Park renovation.\n\n“We are proud to leave a footprint in Asheville by assisting in the renovation of Aston Park,” said Katrina Adams, USTA Chairman of the Board and President in a statement. “We are honored to give Asheville’s tennis players an improved facility to play the game and we look forward to bringing Aston Park’s tennis facilities back to its glory.”\n\nSylvia Okala, sporting dark red hair and a poster of Serena and her baby, traveled from Washington D.C. to watch the Fed Cup. She stayed in Asheville for four days and called it “lovely”.\n\n“We (my husband and I) have had an amazing time here,” Okala said. “Hopefully the Fed Cup will come back so we have another excuse to visit.”\n\nIneke Gejager came to Asheville from the Netherlands for two reasons: to visit her daughter and their new baby, and to watch the Dutch play tennis.\n\n“I knew they didn’t have a chance,” Gejager said. “But it’s been so nice to meet a small group of Dutch people here and watch great tennis.”\n\nNext to Gejager sat Jessie and Monique Englehart, who live just outside of Asheville, but wore the bright orange of the Netherlands on Sunday. Monique grew up in the Netherlands and immigrated to the United States when her daughter, Jessie, was one.\n\nThe two had bought seats in the balcony, but had been spotted outside of the Cellular Center by Netherlands captain Haarhuis, who gave them tickets on the second row next to the Dutch team.\n\n“He was so amazing,” Monique said. “He just walked right up to us and said come help the Dutch.”\n\nThere were plenty of mother-daughter duos who took in the Fed Cup, including Mellissa and Mercer Holman, dressed in matching USA-colored boas. They drove from Atlanta, GA for the event.\n\n“It means so much for my daughter, who plays tennis, to see these woman,” Mellissa said. “They are so powerful and an inspiration. All that she’s talked about this weekend is how she wants to be down there on the court some day.”"
