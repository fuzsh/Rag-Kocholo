        "text": "Former Marshall defender Travis Brent signed with Heracles Almelo in the Eredivisie.\n\nLink\n\nBrent is a 92 who played for Marshall from 2010-2013. He played for the West Virginia Chaos in the PDL this summer and was on the Eastern All-Conference team. From a quick search, his name was thrown around in some 2014 MLS Draft previews, but he was not selected. He seems to be a right back.\n\nIt's somewhat remarkable for an undrafted college player to land in such a big league. Usually guys with Brent's profile wind up in the Swedish second division or the Regionalliga. As a foreigner, how much are Heracles obligated to pay him with the Eredivisie's salary floor?\n\nEDIT: to answer my own question, he was signed on an amateur basis. Not sure exactly what that means, but it makes sense for a club that isn't likely to throw major cash (by smaller Eredivisie clu standards) at an unproven, non-elite college player.\n\nEDIT 2: and he has a Dutch passport.\n\nHere is an interesting fact for you tennis fans. Travis Brent's uncle is Jacco Eltingh.\n\nFrom wiki"
