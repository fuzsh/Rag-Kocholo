        "text": "With Paul Haarhuis, Jacco Eltingh formed one of the world’s top doubles teams in the 1990s. Together, they won 39 titles, including 5 Grand Slams - winning each Grand Slam at least once. In 1993 and 1998, they won the Masters Cup, the unofficial World Championships. They were favorites for a medal at the 1996 Olympics, but were eliminated by their long-time rivals from Australia, the “Woodies” (Woodforde and Woodbridge after a 34-game third set in the semi-finals. In 1998, Eltingh won a sixth Grand Slam, partnering Jonas Björkman. In singles play, Eltingh won four tournaments between 1992 and 1994. In 1995, he reached the quarter-finals of both the Australian Open and Wimbledon. Eltingh later ran a tennis events company together with Paul Haarhuis.\n\nThe venues of the 1900 Olympics were not as advanced as today: the track and field events were held on a grass field scattered with trees, and swimming took place in the River Seine."
