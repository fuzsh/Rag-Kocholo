        "text": "Peter Phillips and his new girlfriend Harriet Sperling are certainly having a busy time; the couple were seen watching Prince William play in the Royal Charity polo match in Windsor, days after attending Wimbledon together.\n\nIt is just the latest of events that the pair have attended this summer, as their romance continues to hot up. They first appeared in public together back in May, where a source told The Sun, the couple looked ‘smitten’ at Badminton Horse Trials. One of Phillips' friends revealed to The Telegraph that he had ‘recently’ found a new partner and that, while the two were ‘spending time together’, it was too early to comment on the nature of the still burgeoning relationship.\n\nRead More\n\nA return to royal duty! Princess Anne is beaming as she appears in public for the first time since her accident\n\nThe Princess Royal suffered a ‘horse-related’ incident at her home which left her in hospital for a number of days\n\nAt the time, photos showed the couple holding hands and cracking jokes as they mingled with crowds at the cross country element of the three day event. Sperling might have been nervous – Peter was introducing her to Queen Camilla after all – but the paediatric specialist was in high spirits as she joined the royals for one of the family’s favourite outings. 'They looked completely smitten and he was grinning from ear to ear,’ said the source. ‘He looked like the cat that got the cream and acted without a care in the world.’\n\nAt the time, the source also suggested Sperling could be invited to Balmoral to spend part of the summer holidays with the royals.\n\nDescribing Peter as ‘a laugh’, friends have previously said he has faced a challenging few years. He is the first-born child of the Princess Royal and her first husband, Captain Mark Phillips, to whom she was married from 1973-1992 (the breakdown of their marriage is depicted in The Crown Season 5). Despite being the eldest grandchild of the late Queen Elizabeth II and Duke of Edinburgh, he was not given a royal title at birth because Princess Anne and Captain Phillips wanted their children to lead as normal a life as possible.\n\n1 / 21\n\nPhillips separated from his partner of three years, Lindsay Wallace earlier this year. Prior to that, Phillips was married for 13 years to Autumn Kelly before their divorce in 2021. The pair have two children together: 13-year-old Savannah Anne Kathleen, the Late Queen’s first great-grandchild, and Isla Elizabeth, 12.\n\nSperling, who is a single mother, has written powerfully about her own experience raising children alone: ‘My daughter and I journeyed 10 years with only each other,’ she said. ‘I liken us to an island and it has often felt hard to imagine anyone joining that island.’ The nurse also spoke of how important her Christian faith was to her during those years, writing that ‘it is often tough parenting alone, but although there is a stigma to endure, God is able to step in and turn it for good.’\n\nHere, Tatler breaks down the couple's summer of love so far…"
