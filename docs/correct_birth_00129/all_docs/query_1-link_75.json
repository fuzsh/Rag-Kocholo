        "text": "Robin Soderling\n\nLost to Henman 3-6, 1-6, 4-6 in the 2003 third round and 7-6, 3-6, 2-6, 6-1, 3-6 in the 2006 first round\n\nHenman always receives magnificent support at Wimbledon and it has probably helped him on many occasions. But such huge expectation may also have hampered him.\n\nAlthough he beat me comfortably in 2003, when we met again last year I noticed how the crowd can work in favour of his opponents. I was very nervous going into the match but it was brilliant that the crowd was for him because otherwise I would have become even more nervous.\n\nIt is a great feeling to have the crowd behind you when you are playing well but if you are not and your fans get edgy it can have an adverse affect and you start playing even worse. For someone as good as Tim it was usually not until the quarters or semis that anyone provided a challenge strong enough to get the crowd edgy but this is the last point at which you want to be feeling pressure and, perhaps by no coincidence, the point that Tim has never progressed past.\n\nMario Ancic\n\nI have no doubt that Tim was capable of winning Wimbledon but by the time I played him it had become clear that the courts were slowing down more and more every year. I have spoken to people who played 10 years ago and they say the Wimbledon grass was so much quicker then, perfectly suited to the serve-volley experts, and that has really affected a player like Tim.\n\nAll of a sudden it becomes so much more difficult to beat guys who are powerful from the back of the court, with powerful returns and ground strokes, and who weren't necessarily contenders on grass in the past. I still think that on any given day Tim can beat anybody but at this age the question is: can he maintain his form over seven matches?\n\nIvo Heuberger\n\nIt is not easy to win a grand slam, but on top of that Tim has played in an era in which Sampras was at his peak and completely dominant, and was swiftly followed by Federer. Many would say they are the two best grass-court players of all time and behind them I don't think there was anyone better than Tim. His big opportunity came when he beat Federer in the 2001 quarter-finals and looked like he was going to beat Ivanisevic in the semis until rain interrupted play for the night. The next day Goran powered through to win - if he had been born in a different era I am convinced Henman would have been Wimbledon champion.\n\nWayne Ferreira\n\nAlthough Tim had reached two previous semi-finals, both lost to Sampras, the first one he should have won was against Ivanisevic in 2001. But in July that year he hired Larry Stefanki as his coach and the American changed his game, made him kick his first serve a lot more and then hit a forehand or two before coming to the net. This took away his serve-volley game and made him stay back and play from the baseline way too much. In my opinion, once he started doing that it ruined any chance he had of winning Wimbledon.\n\nThe guy probably has one of the top five volleys of all time and, while his serve wasn't powerful, he could place it really well. I had watched Tim serve-volley for years but when I played him in 2002, his first Wimbledon since changing to Stefanki, I thought, \"Wow, this is not the way it should be.\" If it hadn't been for an incorrect line call I would have knocked him out.\n\nPaul Haarhuis\n\nIt doesn't surprise me that Tim has never won Wimbledon because he has never been brilliant at returning serve. He was a great server, fantastic at the net and he moved well around the court but his return was never good enough. If Tim had a really good return he would have made every opponent work so much harder on their service games, while cruising through his own.\n\nDavid Prinosil\n\nThe levels of expectation on Henman have not been unfair. Of course the British people were desperate for him to win Wimbledon but that is the same in all countries. Although the other grand slam hosts usually have more players in the top 100 it is not uncommon for national hopes to rest on one player and those individuals have to deal with it. Maybe Tim didn't deal with it very well.\n\nMy only meeting with him at Wimbledon was his first ever singles match and, even as a 19-year-old, everyone could see he had a lot of talent and that his game was especially suited to a fast surface like grass. Although he lacked a serve like Sampras's or a killer forehand like Hewitt's, with a bit of luck he could easily have reached the Wimbledon final more than once.\n\nThe key problem may have been psychological. People forget that Tim's problem has not only been Wimbledon; he has never reached the final of any grand slam and the ability to make that step up separates the good from the great."
