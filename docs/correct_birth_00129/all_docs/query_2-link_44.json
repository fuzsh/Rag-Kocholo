        "text": "Thomas Muster (born October 2, 1967, Leibnitz, Austria) is an Austrian tennis player who, at the 1995 French Open, became the first competitor from his country to win a Grand Slam tournament and who was one of the dominant clay court players in the 1990s.\n\nMuster entered professional tennis in 1985, after finishing 10th in the 1984 world junior rankings. Four tournament titles in 1988 raised his Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) world ranking to 16th. On March 30, 1989, having just defeated Yannick Noah of France to advance to the finals of the Lipton International in Key Biscayne, Florida, and poised to solidify a spot in the top 10, Muster was unloading gear from the trunk of his car when it was struck by another car, severing the ligaments in his left knee. Surgery repaired the knee, but Muster’s ability to play professional tennis—or even walk comfortably—was uncertain.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nGreat Moments in Sports Quiz\n\nDetermined to return to the game, Muster, with the help of his coach, Ronald Leitgeb, designed a special chair from which he could hit tennis balls while his leg healed. Within six months Muster was back on the tour, and he finished the year ranked 21st in the world. With his career back on track, he began to establish a pattern: except for a 1990 title on the hard-court surface at Adelaide, Australia, every tournament he won was played on clay, where the slower pace of the game seemed to lessen the disadvantage of his weakened knee. He finished 1990 ranked seventh in the world, but his mastery of the clay court was just beginning."
