COVER STORY ■ Bowling 'Fast' Is No Big Deal\" Jawagal Srinath explains how he overcame his insecurities to hecome India's No. 1 strike howler INTERVIEWED BY GAUTAM BHATTACHARYA, CHANDIGARH SPORTSWORLD: You've graduated from an unreliable fast bowler to the country's main strike bowler. You've even managed to make odd contribu¬ tions With the bat. Are you aware of the metamorphosis that you have gone through? SRINATH; Well, the Windies series was a make orbrcak opportunity forme And thank¬ fully, everything started flowing, right from the first One-day international at Faridabad You know, people are suggesting that I should try and develop myself as an all- rounder But Tm not too keen to fit myself into that sort of role I don't consider myself to be an all-rounder My relative success with the bat was just a bonus But on a difficult last day of the final Test at Mohali you, along with Raju, had put up a token of resistance while the top order surrendered abjectly. It seemcKl you had prepared yourself well against the quickies? Believe me, I didn't 1 have been con¬ centrating only on my bowling. I never imagi- ^ned that 1 could bat that long (laughs) Over the last three months 1 was trying des¬ perately to find my bowling form. My sudden success with the bat was just a coincidence. After the last Sri Lankan tour, 1 really got depressed. 1 was failing to get anywhere near the standards that 1 had set for myself. Are you aware of the fact that not so long ago;people used to dismiss you as an ^NRI fast bowler/ One who only played Srinath it net instacknawMoad to ha tha cavaliy's main strika bawlar. Bat mmaura alata that ha aiigiit avan amarga as an allmndar abroad and invariably sat out on a home series. Yes, a stage had come when 1 was playing Test matches only outside India. If you recall. I've always been telling you, how important the continuity factor was. To develop your confid¬ ence you need to play at a stretch. Not sit out, play, then again sit out and play... When I look back, 1 realise how difficult that phase was. Whenever I was fielded in an away Test match 1 had all kinds of adjustment problems. This is because the gap between the Tests that 1 played and my previous Internatio¬ nal outing always used to be so huge. How frustrating was it everytime a home 5 COVER STORY series beckoned you? You knew before > hand that a turning track would be pre* pared leaving room only for two sea* mers. ManoJ Prabhakar was performing so well that dropping him would have been illogical. And there was this huge shadow of a gentleman called Kapil Dev. That left you with a 10 per cent, (may be even less) chance of playing. I agree, it was quite frustrating, the wicket did¬ n't matter really. I've no mental block against, turners. On the contrary, 1 love to bond on any track. All I required was a place in the playing eleven and I wasn't getting it. j Once Paaji got injured, 1 knew this was the best time to shoulder additional responsibilit¬ ies and to make a permanent place for myself in the side. So I gave everything I had and luckily things started working. JAWAGAL SRINATH Date of birth: 31.8.1969 Birth place: Mysore Debut In Test Cricket: V.

You've now showed a mar¬ ked improvement in this area.... The name itself suggests that bowlers will be in lor a slog' towards the dosing overs So irrespective ot how well you bowl normally you end up giving 5-6 runs in an over Which IS not too bad On the other hand I do agree 1 was giving away a lot more runs than I wanted to My mis¬ take was to try and gel the batsman out rather than contain them But as far as this series was concerned I realise that I was thinking a lot more That, possibly is the key to the transfor mation you're talking about Apart from sorting out your prevalent problems you also had a major challenge coming up. You knew^ that Brian Lara would be negotiating you throughout the season. Now that the series is over^ tell me honestly, after the 375 and 501 that he scored, were you slightly nervous bowling to him? No, (very emphatically) no It doesn't really matter whether it's Brian Lara, Sachin Tendul¬ kar or any other big name You re a bowler You're armed with a ball Your opponent has got a bat It boils down to a contest between bat and ball Nothing else So you want me to believe that you were never bothered about Lara nor did you make any special preparations for him? Trust me I made no special preparation Nei¬ ther for Lara nor for Hooper or Jimmy Adams or whoever Everytime the captain ^landed over the ball, I just told myself to keep the right line and make the batsman play All 1 knew was that if 1 kept the right line it won t be very easy for Lara You know, my normal delivery is the mswinger which is an away' one for the left-handed batsman and that s the best ball in cricket The delivery leav¬ ing the batsman C«i.ay, we're convinced you didn't make any special preparations for Lara. But standing against him from a distance of about 28 yards or more, did the adrenalin In you pump a little more? No nothing like that really Mind you, I KAMAL JULKA wasn't bowling to him for the first time in my career. Lara was a member of the West Indies team that played us in the World Series and the World Cup. By now^ you've bowled to some of the world's leading batsmen. Who do you reckon is the hardest one to dismiss? David Boon is the toughest customer I've ever faced. Not Lara Now that the series Is over. Have you ana¬ lysed the areas where you need to work harder? The greatest problem in my case is that of con¬ tinuity I've realised, unless you play cricket in the summer at England you get completely out of touch. The gap between the completion of the season in India and the beginning of the next is pretty long Nearly six months. What can you do in these months? You might train very hard, go to the gym but that's not enough. There is, and can never be. any substi¬ tute for match practice Which is why I faced all kinds of problems at the beginning of the season In the Singer World Series, I wasn't getting my rhythm right, and I ended up disap¬ pointing everybody. Fortunately, this tournament was followed by the Buchi Babu Trophy in Madras Since Venkatesh Prasad had to play for MRF, I beca¬ me the lone fast bowler for Karnataka. That was a blessing in disguise. To cover up for him, I had to bowl very long spells. After Buchi Babu, I played in three-day matches and bowl¬ ed a lot there too. Yes, 1 was struggling to get a good line and length in Sri Lanka. But now I've finally got it back, thanks to continuous match practice. You said, a long lay off makes you feel rusty. Does it also mean that you're eager¬ ly looking forward to an offer from the English Counties? I would love to go there. During that penod (April-Sept) cricket is only played in England. Forget Counties. Even if I get an offer from a league team. I'd still consider it. I'm very keen. These days young fast bowlers face a Beculiar problem. Normally, they first get picked to play in One-dayers where the pressure is much more. One bad over could cost the side a match. How do you look at this problem? I agree, it's a major disadvantage. A youngster should begin his career in Test matches. There he gets an extended run in the sense that on an avmge he could bowl thirty overs. With experience you can learn and playing a Test Is the ideal way to learn. The chances of one bad over costing your side a Test match are very slim. But in One-dayers that's a genuine fear. To succeed in international cricket you requi¬ re a lot of confidence and 1 don't think limited overs cricket is the ideal platform for an indivi¬ dual to gain confidence. You seem to have become a yard or two faster than before. As a matter of fact, in some matches you may've bowled faster than the four West Indians. How did you increase your pace? (Looks hardly enthused by the compliment) Well, bowling faster in one particular game is no big deal. It's of no use really. Anybody can bowl fast on a given day it he gets his rhythm right. I think that the real test to me comes when you maintain that son of pace for a per¬ iod of at least three to four years. That to me is the essence of fast bowling. • 9 THE LEGEND CONTt ■ « ame this venue which was once famous for a very popular (and vocal) spectator stand which has since been replaced PHOTO FEATURE WOTMMPWMTMCK CMSM 1.

But what does Leasel Rouedas have to say about Lara and cricket and fame? BY GAUTAM BHATTACHARYA 16 L EASEL ROUEDAS hails Trinidad. Her home is a few kilometres' drive from the Port-of-Spain Oval and she even claims that she knows a few Indians. Yet, astonishingly, she has never known that one Sunil Manohar Gavaskar exists on this planet. \"I hardly follow cncket,\" she claims, defending her lack of knowledge. But then I mention another Bombayite's name and she exclaims, \"Oh yeah, Tendulkar. I've heard a lot about him.\" Even though the question is rhetorical one cannot help but ask how. \"You know, he (Lara) keeps talking about him. Sachin did this, Sachin did that I\" She hastens to add that her steady boyfriend and to-be husband speaks in glowing terms about Sachin: \"1 remember Brian telling me that 'people call me the number one batsman in the world. But Tendulkar is a tremendous player too.' According to Brian, he is his real competitor.\" That's Leasel for you. Short, round-faced, curly haired and always armed with a smile on her face. She has no starry airs about her. She is much too vivacious for that. Her charm is so great that even after half an hour of interviewing her, I completely forget to take down her surname. But I do not attribute it to a major professional blunder. Because, in any case, her surname is going to change within a couple of years The faa IS that Leasel Rouedas is bethrothed to one Mr Bnan Charles Lara, and will be marned to him after she finishes her fashion designing course. Leasers personality is in sharp contrast to her boyfriend's high-profile image. She is just the plain old girl next door and she wants her husband to remain as down-to-earth as he is presently. \"I told him the other day,\" she confides, \"that 'Brian, you are turning down so many requests for interviews. I can see your point; that it is impossible to satisfy their hunger. But when you say 'No', say that politely please. Then at least they will remember you as a decent human being and not as an arrogant brat'.\" At the same time, she tells you that what Lara is going through, in these post-world record days. Is not exaaly anybody's idea of having fun. \"You know, back home, it's CouitMy WalthhaesLaasal in the dmaiiM room at Mohali oflor tho VHM Indim orow tbo torloa different, \"she testifies \"They all know who he IS They respect him for that There are times when even complete strangers walk up to him and say, 'Hello Brian, well done!' But they don't bother him. He never gets mobbed in Tnnidad or, for that matter, in any other West Indian island. That was why he was so much at sea in England last summer and in India, trying to ward off people's attention. You cannot imagine the kind of intrusions people make in his private life. At the same time, he is under a lot of pressure to perform consistently.\" Leasel, who after completing her studies, worked for a brief while in a local bank in Tnnidad, says, \"Too much has happened in Brian's life, and that too, much too early and abruptly. If you notice, there was hardly a few months interval between his 375 and the record-breaking 501. After that, whenever Brian went anywhere, he found that expectations had gone skyhigh. He felt the pressure, but at the same time, he knew that he S P O T L I G H T UsMl {e9mntwlABCP^9iSj^artn¥ioM ill htr lap to te MMfMinf of Hit oraet Uta (iMt Lmff) AiMTiMtli toxlmM toft) couldn't do anything about it.\" How harassed was he on this Indian tour? \"Very much/' says Lease), \"in fact, as a result, he wasn't in the best of spirits. Which is why he called me up from Bombay and asked me to come over.\" Did she realise that her arrival proved to be lucky for the West Indies? They drew the Nagpur Test from the jaws of defeat and went on to win at Mohali. \"'Oh yeah.\" Leasel giggles and adds, \"the boys are saying that 1 brought luck for them.\" But Leasel was very reclusive after she came to India. She did not come out into the open, till the fourth day of the last Test at Mohali. The veil of mystery and confusion that shrouded Lara's girlfriend was so much that it led to all kinds of speculative stories in the press. There were at least five different names that were attributed to her. One newspaper said that it was one Henrietta who was sharing the room with Lara. Another newspaper named her Julia and Keith Arthurton was quoted in the national dailies as having said. \"She is Nelson Mandela's daughter.\" When I tell Leasel this.she bursts out laughing and says. \"What?! Nelson Mandela's daughter? Did Keith say that? How funny! Aaually. the boys were overproteaive about me. Basically. I was staying away from the limelight because Brian wants his private life to remain private. That was why 1 hadn't spoken to a single reporter on this tour.\" Leasel follows Lara's exploits on the cricket ground closely but her sporting passion is golf. She is a golf freak. Whenever they are together in Trinidad, they can be spotted either at the beach or at the golf course. \"He's a better player than me,\" she says, \"his handicap is 18. Mine is 30. But still we fight it out quite intensely.\" One cannot help but be inquisitive as to why she is contemplating marriage after two years? Why can't it take place sooner? If you consider Lara's fan following among women, isn't a long-term plan a slightly risky proposition? 1 ask her and immediately curse myself. The question should have been sugarcoated a little. The hint was too direct. Almost ungentlemanly. But Leasel is not offended: \"You're not the first one to have said this. But 1 am confident. Brian is one guy who can always be trusted.\" And Leasel is confident of playing a very long innings in the life of Brian Lara. • PHOTOanAPHS KAMAt JULKA. SPOTLIGHT MARY HAS ALITTLE PLAN... ...to be the No. 1 player in the world. And as 1994 showed that she has come to terms with the turmoil in her private life and her new-found confidence makes her a potential No. 1 T he metamorphosis of Mary Pierce from a troubled prodigy, abused by her fanatical father, into a happy, confident, rising star proved a Godsend for women's tennis, itself struggling, in 1994. Nearly a year after Mary fired her father, Jim, as coach and obtained a legal restraining order forbidding him from interfering in her life, she spectacularly devastated opponents to gain the French Open final. Pierce thrashed once-invincible Steffi Graf 6-2,6-2 with the most lethal female groundstrokes ever seen. The statuesque, 5'1blonde looked elegant doing it, too, in stylish, trend-setting dresses. What's more, the no-longer-repressed 19-year-oId smiled, laughed, bantered with fans and genuinely enjoyed herself. I lecenily talked with the new Mary Pierce—\"the true me\" as she calls it —aflid found her forthright, articulate and charming. 20 Last December Pam Shriver told me, ''Mary is definitely the player to watch to become a big star in women's tennis in 1994/' How close are you to becoming a big star? Hmmm. For me, to become a big star, I would have to say I'm pretty far away because I consider people like Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova, Steffi Graf, Monica, those people are stars. I also don't really like the word star too much in tennis. For me, stars are more like actors and music people. To put it another way, I enjoy it when I know that people are excited to come, and they watch me and my opponents play great tennis, and they have a good time. Your breakthrough tournament came at the 1993 Virginia Slims Championships when you beat Martina and Gaby after losing 19 straight times to top 10 players. What did that tournament mean to you? That really helped me a lot because, as you know, last year was a difficult year for me. That I finally ended my year that way was the best I could ever have done, other than winning the tournament. That really made me very happy about myself and my tennis. Because previously when I had played the top players it was so close. And I was always thinking: \"Gosh, I feel like I have the game to beat them, but when am I going to do it?\" Then when I finally did, that definitely gives you the confidence that you really can do it when you face the top players again. Last spring you had another big win when yovoverpowered Arantxa at Hilton Head. How significant was that? Definitely significant. Because when you do well at a tournament, sometimes they might say, \"Well, that was just once. It'll be hard for her to do that again.\" So, for me to beat Arantxa there was also a great match. But when 1 played her at the French Open, 1 was expeaing to beat her. So it was a little disappointing when 1 lost to her there. ModalliiHl it MOllitr |ob that Mary Piarea la good at, and wHIi har atanniiig laafca and fiflura. It would not bo difficult for hor to got modolling asaignmonla onca sba chooaao to laavatannit At the French Open you were totally awesome in crushing world No. 1 Graf 6-2,6-2. What stands out most In your mind about that match'’ God! Ii was so wtMrd for me because I was so calm and so concentrated and so focused that I real)> didn t rcaJire what was going on In a way it s a puy because I didn i really know what I had done then even a couple of days after Even a week after the tournament I still didn t realize the magnitude of my victory I think what was best for me was |ust playing against Steffi on Center C oun with all the French people pulling for me and yelling for me When I won the match I kind of didn t believe it and I looked at my Mom and [coaches] Nick (Bolletticnl and Sven [Groeneveldl I saw the crowdjust going nuts and that was the best feeling ever What did your 6-4,6-4 loss in the final to Arantxa teach you? It taught me not to be nervous (Laughter) That is not easy to do When 1 played Arantxa I was nervous I was thinking too much about playing her and that I was in the final of the French Open and that I could win a Grand Slam All those things were working on my mind In what ways has Nick Bollettieri helped you the most? Nick has helped me a lot, not just technically but also tactically I get along really well with Nick A lot of people have certain [negative] opinions about Nick because they don't really know him He's a very generous and caring Iverson He's got a good sense of humour so we have fun when we praaise We discussed that I had to get in better shape because if I was going to be winning I'd have to play more matches And 1 definitely had to get quicker tb compete against the top players So I started a heavy workout program with a lot of foolwork drills in December And that's helped a lot Who are the key people in your life now, and who accompanies you to tournaments? Sven Grocneveld is with me all the time He was working with Arantxa Sanchez Vicario before me He's with me every day* training at home and running and practising and at tournaments Nick is there at Grand Slams and other selected tournaments that he can make because it's hard to divide his time between Boris [Becker] and me Mom and my biothcr [David] have come to the French Open and the U S Open Hive with my Mom and my brother only when I m not playing and I go home I'm more independent now Do you have a boyfriend? Ah ha* No not really a boyfriend [But] I have two close male friends It's really hard to have a boyfriend* I because for me a boyfriend is somebody that you re seriously involved with And it s leally hard in a tennis career to be seriously involve^ because you re travelling around so much Can we have their names? No (laughter) What traits do you want your ideal man to have? He has to have a good sense of humour He has to be caring and generous and intelligent (Laughter) fcverythiiig* You have a really big game. What are the chances youMl win a Grand Slam title in 1995? That s a difficult question Tennis is the first priority in my life now and my goal and dream is to win a Grand Slam and to be No 1 So I m going to work very very hard to achieve that If that s in 95 It will be wonderful But, if It s in two c)r three or even five yeais from now that will still be great . At the French Open Bollettieri mticized you in two areas. He Mary Piarce: iha't got the aiost lathal groundstrokas In tha circuit and her compatriots art finding thani loo tough to tackla said, ^^ou're stupid on the court and you're eating too much.\" Was he right? I think those were misquotes The one quote [1 read] was that [he told me] I was not supposed to think while I'm playing and just hit the ball Maybe it's better if you don't read too many papers. (Laughter) Yeah I don't read many papers So we'll just delete that other one. Well* I mean, those could be true The thing I like about Nick is that we re both really honest with each other He could have probably said that* but I didn't read it My diet is also something that we have changed Chris Evert once said that she loved it whenever a writer called her \"sexy.\" You have a pretty face and a great body. Do you feel the same as Chris? I don t know how to answer that question because sexy for me is also something that doesn't go along with sports It's another thing like this word star I guess it's a compliment, so if people say it about me, I wouldn't take It badly Would you like to be a tennis glamour girl tike Gabriela Sabatini? No* I would like to be an exciting and interesting Mary Pierce I'm not like Sabatini I have interests other ihan tennis but tennis is the most important thing for me 1 have done a couple of modelling things and some photo shoots And that's something I have a lot of fun doing So I'd like to be versatile Recently Steffi Graf said: \"When you see pictures of 20 years ago, I think the dresses look great.\" You wear stylish dresses and may start a trend back to dresses. Please tell me why you wear dresses. When I started with Nike, and they introduced me to the dress at the beginning of this year, I thought it was the greatest thing ever. They had showed it to Mary Joe [Fernandez], but she was very hesitant and apparently shied away. They said, \"Would you wear it?\" 1 did without any questions. I thought it was so cool. 1 knew that it was going to start something, and, of course, bring some excitement. People would talk about it. Dresses are beautiful and very feminine and very classy. It would be really neat if other players would start to wear dresses, too. When Martina In February was asked, ^^Who will take your place as tennis' spokesperson?\" she replied: \"Of the Americans, It could be Mary Pierce or Lindsay Davenport. They have the interest in the game and the brains to go with it.\" Do you want to take the baton from Martina? That's a tough thing to do. I feel that I can get along with people, and I'm very interested in what's going on in the game and also in the outside world. I feel I can relate well to the press. But, you know, Martina is such a great person and a great athlete. And she's done so much for the game and she's very outspoken. It would be hard to take her place. Sixteen months ago, you showed a lot of courage by telling the world about your personal trials and traumas in a remarkable Sports Illustrated cover story (\"Why Mary Pierce Fears For Her Life\"). In retrospect, do you think you did the right, thing? I think it was the right thing to do. I don't regret anything about that because people had done a lot of talking about it [my family turmoil] everywhere I'd go. At every press conference they'd ask me questions about it. So I thought, OK, I'm going to do an article and this is it, this is what 23 SPOTLIG HT everybody needs to know. Then they'll all read it, and they'll know, and they won't have to talk about it anymore. It'll be over. You once remarked, \"I never forget my goals. 1 know what I want.\" What exactly do you want? And how close are you to getting it? Well, I'm pretty far from reaching my goals. (Laughter) I try to set realistic goals every year. My goal last year was to make the Virginia Slims Championships. This year it's to finish in the Top 5. I've been able to achieve my goals every time for the year that I set them. But for my career lifetime WMi liar parional probloms lafft bahind, Mary Piarca bat a nawr-round canfidanca that hat IHlad bar gaina ta graat baightt goals, it's to be No. 1 and to win Grand Slams [tournaments]. 1 haven't done that yet. It's a very, very difficult thing to do. But I'm going to keep working hard. At the 1994 French Open you confided: ^a'm finally becoming Mary Pierce the player. It was always, ^Mary Pierce and her father did this or that/ Now it's Just Mary Pierce. The true me is finally coming out.\" Who and what is \"the true me''? Before, our family would always be together all the time so my Dad would be the one talking to everybody. And I really never got to be myself. I think the first time I was able to do things on my own and really just do normal life things was after the U.S. Open last year. I took a break and lived with some friends just by myself for a coupleof weeks. That really, really helped me a lot—just to open my eyes to the world and see wfiat's really going on in normal everyday life and really open up and find out who I am and how I act. And just to go and talk to people, just by myself. That may seem very, very weird. # 24 Q READERS UIZ QUESTIONS The Shah of Iran »and Pt. Nehru had a sport in common.

And Shahbaz Ahmed who steered Pakistan to this win proved that artistic hockey has not died BY DAVID McMAHON. MELBOURNE OU could forgive Shahbaz Ahmed if he put down the job description \"space explorer\" as a profession on his passport. In an age where hockey has changed beyond the comprehension of all those who brought India its swag of Olympic gold medals, this man is truly the only player in the world who creates space in the fashion of the game's ancient wizards. Although India won the hockey gold at the 1980 Moscow Olympics, Asian teams have had little success in the major international tournaments in the Eighties and Nineties (even Pakistan's three previous World Cups were in 1971. 1978 and 1982). The international trend was that European teams called the shots and dominated the world arena. Now, with Pakistan's victory in Sydney, the Asian style could win greater acclaim than it ever has in the past two decades. That, in the broader picture, is of even greater significance than Pakistan's wonderful victory. Even the most creative players now at the peak of world hockey seem to have little time or space. They get the ball-lliey gain a few yards. Then they 30 Shahbaz Ahmad: probably the only Intornational playor who can still woave magic with his hockoy stick must pass or risk being stopped by an opponent. But Shahbaz? No, not him. He is an artisan, a stickwork maestro who rekindles memories of the game as an an form, where one could duck and weave and feint and swerve and thread the ball through one obstacle after another without being snared. If you watched him in action against Argentina during the just concluded World Cup on Australian soil you would have seen exactly what I mean. There was Shahbaz, in centre field, his stick caressing the ball this way and then that, drawing it at will in this direction and then another, almost as though the ball was magnetised exclusively to his stick. He begins threading his path towards the goalmouth. Facing him are three Argentinian defenders. But do they advance and challenge him? No. They are not courageous enough, not confident enough of their own skills, to step out and pit themselves against him. So Shahbaz advances. And the three defenders start moving backwards. They are conceding ground to this man. Metre after metre, quicker than it takes in the telling, Shahbaz advances menacingly. Still they back-pedal, conceding ground till he is at the top of the circle. Now they have no choice. They must intercept him. They make their move, darting forward for the first time. But Shahbaz has anticipated it perfectly. He has passed the ball to a teammate. Pakistan wins 3-0 Shahbaz does not score on the day, but it is he who has Tha World Cm win MW tbt rMwiMtiM «i PakMnn iioeVov.o«<MWonaainthovaft Mill Mon M world boalon etched the canvas on which Pakistan paints a viaory The team marches through the draw, beating hosts Australia and then disposing of The Netherlands on penalty strokes after the scores were locked at 1 -1 after coming back from being one goal down In the shootout Flores Jan Bovelander missed for The Netherlands with the second flick while Mohammed Shafqat then missed with Pakistan s fihh flick before goalkeeper Mansoor Ahmed saved Jeroen Delmee s shot in a spectacular fashion to give Pakistan a record fourth World Cup title In fact, Pakistan had much to thank Mansoor for, as It was he who dived to his left to keep out German captain Christian Blunck in the semi-final shootout Ironically, it was the Dutch who had beaten Pakistan m Lahore in 1990 to win the last World Cup This loss, in the 1994 final m Sydney was also significant because it ended a 27-game winning streak for The Netherlands, who were loommg ominously for the 1996 Olympics Pakistan only dropped one match at this tournament, a 2-0 aberration to England in a Pool A game albeit when Shahbaz was injured and Tahir suspended But the architea of the overall World Cup victory was Shahbaz, who IS 28 now and already, in the wake of Pakistan s triumph talking in terms of a second retirement There was one period earlier when he thought he had had enough, but he was talked in to returning to the helm tor the benefit of his country s hockey future He will play for a year on Japanese soil, for a sum believed to be about $70 000 and then he will return to Pakistan, to his family He was 18 when he was invited to join a national hockey camp and almost instantaneously found himself wearing the national colours Now 10 years later the Western media, reverentially asks if he is the best player in the game s history He is modest, this man He simply says, ''Everybody is a good player of his own time If I say Vm the best so far, it's not a good deosion We have had a lot of good players, I think Fm a good player of my time and they were good players of their time \" Yet, to put his modesty in perspective, nine times in his illustrious career he has been voted the best player at international tournaments Strangely enough, despite his aura and his skills, Pakistan had never won a World Cup or an Olympic gold medal Now, with victory in the 1994 World Cup, Shahbaz has managed to silence the cntics who pointed out that a true measure of greatness is KIdt taka to fliallaM daring a braak.

They won bronze, beating, nay thrashing Germany 5-2. They had not scored more than two goals in a match until they met Germany, hampered by the first-half absence of German captain Christian Blunck. Hie last time the two trams had met in a nutiof tournament was in the final of the Chamidons'Trtqihy in Kuala Lumpur last year, which Australia won 4-0. Australian coach Frank Murray did not mince his words. \"We were determined to show the public how to play hockey, but it was a couple of days too late. These matches are always difficult to play in because you come here trying to win the tournament and if you don't, then it doesn't matter whether you finish second or sixth. I was pleased with the ball movement today, it's what we would have liked through the week. But I think that's got to do with pressure, against the Dutch it was a different style of game and when you get a couple of goals early it opens the game up.\" And what of Shahbaz, the man who brought the sub-continental style of hockey its first major trophy in almost 13 years? He reckons he will not be back. \"Now I'm going to give the chance to become the man of the tournament to other players,\" he quipped as he turned his back on the world arena. • WORLD OF TENNIS TENNIS AN The best and worst of tennis in 1994 BEST EARLY ROUND MATCH—Underrated Julie Halard's thrilling first round 6-2, 1-6,7-6 upset over second-seeded Arantxa Sanchez Vicano at the Virginia Slims Championships. A spectacular diving volley winner by Halard Ignited her 7-2 tiebreaker. t BEST NAVRATILOVA NUMBERS—In a sport not especially statisucal, these Navratilova numbers should be memorable: a record nine Wimbledon singles titles, a doubles Grand Slam in 1984, a record 167 singles and a record 165 doubles titles, an (Open Era) 74-match record winning streak in singles, a record 109 consecutive doubles match victories (with partner Pam Shnver), a No.l ranking for seven years, 18 career Grand Slam singles mles, and six consecutive Grand Slam singles titles in 1983-84. BEST DEPTH-I—Maligned for supposedly lackmg depth, women's tennis showed plenty at upset-riddled Wimbledon. Both the No. 1 and No.2 seeds failed to reach the quarterfinals in a Grand Slam championship for the first time in the Open Era. BEST FIGHTER—Arantxa Sanchez Vlcario. In three matches 1994, the tireless, temKRnis Spaniard fought off match points to beat Steffi Graf, the most momentous comeback being at the U.S. Open in a thrilling 1-6,7-6,6-4. final. H ECDOTES BESTDBPTHII—A host of hungry, giant-kilhng qualifiers wreaked havoc at the Mercedes Italian Open. Qualifier Federica Fortuni upset 16th-seeded Minam Oremans 7-6,6-4; qualifier Redka 2^ubakova knocked off six-seeded Amanda Coetzer 6-0,7-5; qualifier Adnana Serra-Zanetti upset fourth-seeded Anke Huber 2-6, 6-3,6-3 and lOth seeded Brenda Schultz 6-2,6-1, and qualifier Kanna Habsudova stunned fifth seeded Mary Pierce 6-2,6-3 en route to the semifinals. BEST BRmSH RESULTS • Aging (32) veteran Jeremy Bates, ranked only No. 131, captured the $200,000 Korean Open to become the first Bntish player to win an ATP Tour men's singles title since 1977 Also, for the second time in three years, he reached the Wimbledon round of 16 to give long-suffering British fans something to cheer about. WORST U.S. SHOWING—For the second straight year—but only the third time in the 108-year history of the U.S. women's singles championship—no American reached the semifinals. BEST LOSS—Yvegeny Kafelnikov, ranked no.60 came within two poinu of the best win of his life when he extended world No.l Pete Sampras to 6-3, 2-6,6-3,1 -6,9-7 before losing in the Australian Open second round. “The guy is good and he's young, he has some of the best groundies I've ever played against,\" pnisedSampras. , BBSTSBLPGONnDENCE • After crushing Michael Chang 6-4,6-1, 6-3 m the Wimbledon quarters, Pete Sampras commented' “Today's tennis was pretty much flawless on my side. I feel like I can stay back with the Agassis and Couriers and serve and volley with the Beckers and the Edbergs.\" WORST USTA STA’nSTICS - At the 1994 USTA annual meeting, only 35 minutes were spent discussing its $210 million U.S. Open stadium project and only 20 of the record 682 registered USTA volunteers there attended the meeting. Secondly, none of the USTA's 120 area junior training centres is located in a black community. BEST PLAYING STYLE CRITIQUE - “I see a lot of players playing like Chris (Evert) today, that baseline style—but none like me,\" observed Martina Navratilova, the sport's greatest serve and volleyer ever, during the Italian Open. WORST ATP TOUR RULES - The IBM/ATP Tour's “Best 14\" ranking rule which counts only a player's best 14 tournament results and throws out his other tournaments, 10 or more in many players' cases. Denounced by nearly all the top players, this rule blunder has produced inaccurate and unfair rankings since 1990. Second, the legalisation of guarantees at World Series (middle-level) tournaments is likewise unethical to the time-honoured principle that a player should receive in prize money (only) what he earns by wlrming on the court in tournament matches. Third, byes for seeded players provide an unfair, undeserved advantage—an unequal suiting positlon->-in a talent-deep sport. 35 BEST DAVIS CUP UPSET (TEAM) - A nurade comeback, achieved with a little luck and a lot of determination and skill, sent Sweden mto its nmth Davis Cup Fmal (against Russia) Down 2*0 and seemingly beaten against the favoured United States after the first day, Sweden's new top team of Jan Apell and Jonas Bjorkman defeated former college teammates Jared Palmer and Jonathan Stark Stefan Edberg levelled the semi-final when Pete Sampras, suffenng from a strained hamstnng musde, was forced to retire after losing the first set Hero, Magnus Laisson then delivered the coup de grace by upsetting world no 6 ■ Todd Martin 5-7,6-2,6-2,6-4 All players must play the same number of matches to win a tournament BEST DAVIS CUP UPSET (PLAYER) - Unknown Hunganan Jozsef Krocsko stunned Henn Leconte 6-4 7-6, 6-3 in host France's 4-1 first-round Davis Cup tnumph BEST KING IDEA - Billie Jean King who founded the Team Tennis pro league in the 1970s would like to apply the team tennis concept to junior competition I love team spurts King said It is good when a boy or girl has the opportunity to contribute on an equal level What do you think? BESTPRAISFTO WIMBLEDON - After competing in her 11 th fmal and 22nd and last time at Wimbledon Martina Navratilova praised its mystique 1 loved Wimbledon from the first time I knew about it and it s been recprocated Its like a relationship where you love that person more and more I feel this place in ray bones I feel all those champions out there, dead and abve, when I m out there There's no place like It ' WORLD OF TENNIS BEST LESSON LEARNED - ''Sometimes 1 almost wish I didn't have a lot of the talent I have. In college it was a lot easier for me to win some matches not playing 100 per cent, just relying on my talent and athleticism. Now I can't rely on that.\" (Lisa Raymond, who is having problems cracking the top 50, after losing 7-5, 6-1 to Arantxa Sanchez Vicario at the Virginia Slims of Florida). BEST MARTINA CONFIDENTIAL I - \"Tennis was my catalyst Ijust wanted to be the best, period, and 1 didn't thmk of it as a futile quest. I thinkat made me more perseverant, a stronger person; and on the downside I think it stunted my growth in personal relationships,\" confided Martina Navratilova who believes her relationship with Polish-born Danda Jaroljmek, an artist in London, is her most serene yet. BEST NON-TITLE MATCH - Andre Agassi repeatedly battled from behind—including a 1 - 5 deficit in the fifth set—before succumbmg 6-5, 6-7,7-5, 2-6, 7-5 to equally relentless Thomas Muster in one of the most compelling French Open matches in years. Agassi, the 1990 and '91 runnerup at Pans, but unseeded because of his No. 19 ranking, left the court to a hero's ovation though he lost. BEST MARTINA CONFIDENTIAL U - \"I needed that (tennis glory) before, but not now. My self-esteem doesn't come from tennis, and if I were No. 1 right now, it would not make me a happier person. 1 think I used to think I was better as a person because I was No.l, but that was just the arrogance of youth talking,\" said Navratilova. WORST U.S. OPEN REFORM - The USTA's misguided decision to make the U S. Open draw by computer. It dehumanizes a wonderful tradition and is hardly error-proof. In 1993 it embarrassed the USTA when it produced one player too many for the women's singles event. WORLD OF TEN N IS WORST LOSS - Steffi Grafs shocking 7-5,7-6 first-round Wimbledon loss to unseeded Lori McNeil produced these worst firsts: Graf became Wimbledon's first women's defending champion to lose her opening ^ match; she became the first No. 1 women's seed to lose in the first round of a Grand Slam event since Virginia Ruzici lost to Mary Sawyer at the 1979 Australian Open; and she lost two straight matches for the first time since 1984-85, havmg previously lost to Mary Pierce in the French Open semifinals. BEST VAUD COMPLAINT - In 1995 the women will abandon their one-week, one-site-a-year Federation Cup format and adopt a schedule similar to the Davis Cup . Gigi Fernandez nghtly critiosed its chief flaw; \"I think the format is terrible because it puts the doubles as the fifth match. Who wants to travel halfway around the world for what could be a meaningless match?\" Put another way: doubles should not be devalued or even discounted! BEST PIERCE ENDORSEMENT - \"She can play so aggressively off the return, she's got the physique, she's lean, she's tall and she definitely has the shots. I don't see anything that's missing.\" (Steffi Graf, endorsing Mary Pierce as a future No. 1). BEST ATTITUDE CHANGE- Jim Courier, who sometimes used to get grumpy when things went badly, told the local press at the 'Mldii)^ CUdo Open; \"I'm happy 1^ and I'm happy to be French Riviera. My lifelftgli^Mst pei(M. I have a careerlhid a perfea family, and the fact that I lose a tennis match isn't going to change all that I made that decision a week or 10 days ago, Ihere's IK) reason for me to be moody.\" BESTCONCHITA COFIDENT1AL- \"AU my friends say diet I am a different person on Jl^mnis court. I change touUy ^!||yyn^me mote aggressive. But It court, and I rj1w^si|5 quiet again. I have no Interest at all in being a star.\" (Wimbledon champion Conchita Martinez). BEST ALTRUIST - Andrea Jaeger, who ranked No. 2 in the world before a chronic shoulder injury ended her career at age 20, created the Kids Stuff Foundation with her own money and has brought joy and hope to hundreds of chil^n with cancer and life-threatening diseases at her Silver Lining Ranch in Aspen, Colorado. Jaeger, now 29, runs the program full-time, year-round, unpaid and has received vital support from John McEnroe, Martina Navratilova, Andre Agassi and Prince Bandar of Saudi Arabia. WORST SELES NEWS- Monica Seles'February 16 announcement that she had no definite plans to return to the pro tour in 1994. An August 30 story m the New York A»t reported that she had put on 28 pounds by binging on junk food. BEST PROMOTIONAL IDEA- Prince's video exchange program. To encourage Atlanta area youngsters to get off the couch and onto the tennis court. Prince gave the first 200 parents a free Prince Junior racket and a can of tennis balls in exchange for a video game cartridge. BEST COMEBACK- Darren Cahill a 28-year-old Australian who had undergone seven knee operations and hadn't won an IBM/ATP Tour match in nearly three years, roared back at the Newsweek Champions Cup in March and upset No. 5 seed Goran Ivanisevic and No. 11 MarcRosset. WORST ANALYSIS- Before Wimbledon started, 1993 finalist Jana Novotna told The Sunday Times ol London, 'T think this year Is much too much for Martina. Everything (she does) is much too much slower. Her will is there, but the body just can't do it anymore.\" Novotna ate her words when 37-ycar-old Navratilova whipped her 5-7, 6-0,6-1 in the Wimby quarters and went on to the final. BEST CHOKER CHARGE- Miffed at Novotna's criticism of Navratilova, Gigi Fernandez, Martina's friend and formerly Jana's doubles partner, countered: \"Jana's the biggest choker I've ever seen. First you have to be aware of it, then deal with it, then get over it. It's so simple, but she's choked all her life. She's done it in singles and doubles.\" BEST \"IN MEMORIAM\"- Lew Hoad, a charismatic, 1950s star from Australia, died July 3 in Marbella, Spain, at 59. Hoard, a muscular power player and gifted athlete, amassed 13 singlesand doubles titles at Grand Slam events and barely missed achieving the Grand Slam in 1956 when doubles partner Ken Rosewall beat him in a four-set US Championships final. He and Rosewall led Australia to Davis Cup titles in 1953, '55 and '56. Another tennis legend, Pancho Gonzales, recalled: \"If I had to play a huge match, a major final or a Davis Cup match, the one man I would fear is Lew Hoad.\" BEST \"IN MEMORIAM\"- Ellsworth Vines, an explosive-serving Californian who won the US Championships twice, and the Wimbledon once in the early 1930s, died March 17 at 82.

SPORT 41 BOOK EXTRACT Honduras and El Salvador had to play a match, so that one of the teams could qualify for the '70 World Cup, in Mexico. In this abridged extract, the author shows how from the playingfield, the battle moved off to a war between two countries and caused the death of thousands of people. A fact recorded in the annals of football history Thi$ 18 an extract from The f Granta Reportage puDlind by Granta Books in ataOCiation with Penguin Books Price £7 99 12 L UIS SUAREZ said there was going to be a war, and I believed whatever Luis said. We were staying together in Mexico. Luis was giving me a lesson in Latin America: what It is and how to understand It. He could foresee many events. In his time he had predicted the fall of Goulait in Brazil, the fall of Bosch in the Dominican Republic and of Jimenez in Venezuela. Long before the return of Peron he believed that the old CaudiV/o would again become president of Argentina; he foretold the sudden death of the Haitian dictator Francois Duvalier at a time when everybody said Papa Doc had many years left. Luis knew how to pick his way through Latin politics, in which amateurs like me got bogged down and blundered helplessly with each step. This time Luis announced his belief that there would be a war after putting down the newspaper in which he had read a report on the soccer match between the Honduran and Salvadoran national teams. The two countries were playing for the right to take part in the 1970 World Cup in Mexico. The first match was held on Sunday 8 June 1969, in the Honduran capital, Tegucigalpa. Nobody ill the world paid any attention. The Salvadoran team arrived in ^ Tegucigalpa on Saturday and spent a sleepless night in their hotel. The team could not sleep because it was the target of psychological warfare waged by the Honduran fans. A swarm of people encircled the hotel. The crowd threw stones at the windows and beat sheets of tin and empty barrels with sticks. They set oft one string of firecrackers after another. They leaned on the horns of cars parked in front of the hotel. The fans whistled, screamed and sent up hostile chants. This went on all night. The idea was that a sleepy, edgy, exhausted team would be bound to lose. In Latin America these are common practices. The next day Honduras defeated the sleepless El Salvador squad one>nil. Eighteen >year-old Amelia Bolanios was sitting in front of the television in El Salvador when the Honduran striker Roberto Cardona scored the winning goal in the final minute. She got up and ran to the desk which comainet^ her father's pistol in a drawer. She then shot herself in the heart. 'The young girl could not bear to see her fatherland brought to its knees', wrote the Salvadoran newspaper El Nadonal the next day. The whole capital took part liMhe televised funeral of Amelia Bolanios. An army honour guard marched with a flag at the head of the procession. The president of the republic and his ministers walked behind the flag-draped coffin. Behind the government came the Salvadoran soccer eleven who, booed, laughed at, and spat on at the Tegucigalpa airport, had returned to El Salvador on a special flight that morning. But the return match of the series took place in San Salvador, the beautifully named Flor Blanca stadium, a week later. This time it was the Honduran team that spent a sleepless night. The screaming crowd of fans broke all the windows in the hotel and threw rotten eggs, dead rats and stinking rags inside. The players were taken to the match in armoured cars of the First Salvadoran Mechanized Division—which saved them from revenge and bloodshed at the hands of the mob that lined the route, holding up portraits of the national heroine Amelia Bolanios. The army surrounded the ground. On the pitch stood a cordon of soldiers from a crack regiment of the Guardia Nadonal armed with sub-machine guns. During the playing of the Honduran national anthem the crowd roared and whistled. Next, instead of the Honduran flag—which had been burnt before the eyes of the spectators, driving them mad with joy—the hosts ran a diity, tattered dishrag up the flag-pole. Under such conditions the players from Tegucigalpa did not, understandably, have their minds on the game. They had their minds on getting out alive. 'We're awfully lucky that we lost', said the visiting coach, Mario Griffin, with relief. El Salvador prevailed, three-nil. The same armoured cars carried the Honduran team straight from the playing field to the aiipoit. A worse fate awaited the visiting fans. Kicked and beaten, they fled towards the border. Two of them died, scores landed in hospital. One hundred and fifty of the visitors' cars were burned. The border between the two states was closed a few hours later. Luis read about all of this in the newspaper and said that there was going to be a war. He had been a reponer for a long time and he knew his beat. . In Latin America, he said, the border between soccer and politics is vague. Tliere is a long list of governments that have fallen or been overthrown after the defeat of the national team. Players on the losing team are denounced in the press as traitors.

I Drawings accompanied the article. illustrating the supernatural intervention. Anyone at the stadium can lose his life. Take the match that Mexico lost to Peru, two-one. An embittered Mexican fan shouted in an ironic tone, 'Viva Mexicol' A moment later he was dead, massacred by the crowd. But sometimes the heightened emotions find an outlet in other ways. After Mexico beat Belgium one-nil, Augusto Mariaga, the warden of a maximum-security prison in Chilpandngo (Guerrero Slate, Mexico), became delirious with joy and ran around BOOK EXTRAC T firing a pistol into tne air and shouting,' Viva Mexicol' He opened all the cells releasing 142 dangerous hardened criminals. A court acquitted him later, as, according to the verdict, he had 'aaed in patriotic exaltation.' ' Do you think it's worth going to Honduras?' I asked Luis, who was then editing the serious and influential weekly Siempre. 'I thipk it's worth it,' he answered. 'Something's bound to happen.' I was in Tegucigalpa the next morning. A t dusk a plane flew over Tegucigalpa and dropped a bomb. Everybody heard it. The nearby mountains echoed its violent blast so that some said later that a whole series of bombs had been dropped. Panic swept the city. People fled home; merchants closed their shops. Cars were abandoned in the middle of the street. A woman ran along the pavement, crying, 'My child! My child!' Then silence fell and everything became still. It was as if the city had died. The lights went out and Tegucigalpa sank into darkness. T hurried to the hotel, burst into my room, fed a piece of paper into the typewriter and tried to write a dispatch to Warsaw. I was trying to move fast because I knew that at that moment I was the only foreign correspondent there and that I could be the first to inform the world about the outbreak of the war in Central America. But it was pitch dark in the room and I couldn't see anything. I felt my way downstairs to the reception desk, where I was lent a candle. I went back upstairs, lit the candle and turned on my transistor radio. The announcer was reading a communique from the Honduran government about the commencement of hostilities with £1 Salvador. Then came the news that the Salvadoran army was attackcing Honduras all along the front line. I began to write... 1 carried the dispatch downstairs, found the owner of the hotel and began asking him to find someone to lead me to the post office. It was my first day there and 1 did not know Tegucigalpa at all. It is not a big city—a quarter of a million people—but it lies among hills and has a maze of crabbed streets. The owner wanted to help but he had no one to send with me and 1 was in a hurry. In the end he called the police. Nobody at the police station had time. So he called the fire department. Three firemen arrived in full gear, wearing helmets and carrying axes. We greeted each other in the dark; I could not see their faces. I begged them to lead me to the post office. 1 know Honduras well, I lied, and know that its people are renowned for their hospitality. I was sure they would not refuse me. It was very important that the world find out the truth about who started the war, who shot first and I could assure them that I had written the honest truth. The main thing now was time, and we had to hurry. We left the hotel. It was a dark night. I could see only the outlines of the street. I do not know why we spoke in whispers. I tried to j remember the way and counted my steps. I S was close to a thousand when the firemen stopped and one of them knocked on a door. A voice from inside asked what we wanted. Then the door opened, but only for an instant I so that the light wouldn't be seen. I was inside. | They ordered me to wait: there is only one telex machine in Honduras, and the president ^ was using it. He was engaged in an exchange with his ambassador in Washington, who would be applying to the American government for military assistance. This went ‘ on for a long lime, since the president and the ' ambassador were using uncommonly flowery language and, besides, the connection kept \\ breaking every so often. i After midnight I finally made contact with | Warsaw. The machine typed out the number TL 813480 PAP VARSOVIA. I leapt up joyfully. The operator asked, 'Is Varsovia | some country?' I It's not a country. It's a city. The country is J called Polonia .' 'Polonia, Polonia, 'he repeated, but I could see that the name didn't aaually interest hiiri. He asked Warsaw, 'HOW RECEIVED MSG BIBI?' And Warsaw answered, 'RECEIVED OK OK GREE FOR RYSIEK TKS TKS!' Since early morning people had been digging trenches, erecting barricades—preparing for a siege. Women were stocking up supplies and criss-crossing their windows with masking tape. People rushed through the streets directionless; an atmosphere of panic reigned. Student brigades were painting outsized slogans on walls and fences. A bubble full of graffiti had burst over Tegucigalpa, covering the walls with thousands of verses. By the afternoon the other correspondents arrived from Mexico, forty of them, my colleagues. They had flown into Gautemala and then hired a bus, because the airport in Tegucigalpa was closed. They all wanted to drive to the front. We went to the Presidential In Latin America, the border between soccer and politics is vague.

Players on the losing side are denounced in the press as traitors 45 BOOK EX T R A C T Palace, an ugly, bright blue tum-of-the-century building in the centre of the town to arrange permission There were machine-gun nests and sandbags around the palace and anti-aircraft guns in the courtyard In the corridors inside, soldiers were dozing or lolling around in full battledress People have been making war for thousands of years, but each time it is as if it is the first war ever waged, as if everyone has started from scratch A captain appeared and said he was the army press spokesman He was asked to describe the situation and he stated that they were winning all along the front and that the enemy was suffenng heavy casualties 'OK,' said the AP correspondent Let's see the front The Americans, the captain explained, were already there They always go first because of their influence—and because they commanded obedience and could arrange all sorts of things The captain said we could go the next day, and that everyone should bnng two photographs We drove to a place where two artillery pieces stood under some trees Cannons were firing and stacks of ordnance were lying around Ahead of us we could see the road that led to El Salvador Swamp stretched along both sides of the road, and dense green bush began past the belt of swamp The sweaty, unshaven major charged with holding the road said we could go ao further Beyond this point both armies were in action, and it was hard to tell who was who or what belonged to which side The bush was too thick to sec anything Two opposing units often noticed each other only at the last moment, when, wandering through the overgrowth, they met face to face In addition since both armies wore the same uniforms, earned the same equipment and spoke the same language it was difficult to distinguish fnend from foe The major advised us tb return to Tegucigalpa, because advancing might mean getting killed without even knowing who had done it. (As if that mattered, I thought.) I N the morning an airplane arrived to take u to the far end of the front, where heavy fighting was in progress. Overnight rain had turned the grass airstrip at Nacaome into a quagmire, and the dilapidated old DC-3, black with exhaust smoke, stuck up out of the water like a hydroplane. It had been shot up the day before by a Salvadoran fighter, the holes in its fuselage were patched with rough boards. The sight of these ordinary, simple boards of wood frightened those who said they had bad hearts. They stayed behind and returned later to Tegucigalpa. We were to fly to Santa Rosa de Copan at the other extreme of the front. In Santa Rosa de Copan, a sleepy hamlet filled then only with soldiers, a truck carried us through muddy streets to the barracks, which stood in the old Spanish fort, surrounded by a grey wall swollen from the damp. An officer led us to the garrison commande: who, pale and tired, did not know what to do with us. He ordered that military shirts be given to us. He ordered his aide to bring coffee The commander was worried that Salvadoran units might arrive any moment. Santa Rosa lay along the enemy's main line of attack— that is, along the road that conneaed the Atlantic and the Pacific. El Salvador, lying on the Pacific, dreamed of conquering Honduras, lying on the Atlantic. In this way little El Salvador would become a two-ocean power. The shortest path from El Salvador to the Atlantic ran right where we were—through Ocotepeque, Santa Rosa de Copan, San Pedro Sula, to Puerto Cortes. Advancing Salvadoran tanks had already penetrated deep into Honduran territory. The StUvadorans were moving to order: push through to the Atlantic, then to Europe and then the worldl Their radio repeated; 'A little shouting and noise and that's the end of Honduras.' Weaker and poorer. Honduras was defending itself fiercely. Through the open barracks window we could see the higher-ranking officers preparing their units for the front. Young conscripts stood in scraggly ranks. They were small dark boys, Indians all with tense faces, terrified—but ready to fight. The officers said something and pointed at the distant horizon. Afterwards a priest appeared and sprinkled hoty water on platoons going out towards death. In tha afternoon we left for the fi!ont in an open truck. The first.forty kilometres passed vrithout incident. The road led through higher and higher country, among green heights covered with thick tropical bush. Empty clay huts, some of them burnt out, clung to the mountain slopes. In one place we passed the inhabitants of an entire village straggling along the edge of the road, carrying bundles. Later, as we drove past, a crowd of peasants in white shirts and sombreros flourished their machetes and shotguns. Artillery fire could be heard far, far away. We drove on. The road snaked through forested mountains, past the village of San Francisco. A series of curves began, one after another, and suddenly around one curve we ran into the maw of the war. Soldiers were running and firing, bullets whizzed overhead, long bursts of machine-gun fire ripped along both sides of the road. The driver braked suddenly and at that instant a shell exploded in front of us. Sweet Jesus, I thought, this IS it. What felt like the wing of a typhoon swept through the truck Everybody dived for it, one on top of another, just to make it to the ground, to hit the ditch, to vanish. Out of the corner of my eye, on the run, T could see the fat French TV cameraman scrambling along the road looking for his equipment. Somebody shouted, 'Takecoverl' and when he heard that order—grenades going off and the bark of automatic rifles hadn't fazed him—he hugged the road like a dead man. I lunged in the direction that seemed to be the most quiet, threw myself into the bushes, down, down, as far as I could get from the curve where the shell had hit us, downhill, along bare ground, skating across slick clay, and then into the bush, deep into the bush, but I didn't run far because suddenly there was shooting right in front of me—bullelts flying around, branches fluttering, a machine-gun roaring. I fell and crouched on the ground. I don't know how long this went on. When 1 raised my head, I was looking into the eyes of a soldier. I froze. Falling into the hands of the Salvadorans was what I feared most, because then the only thing to look forward to was certain death. They were a brutal army, blind with fury, shooting whomever they got hold of in the madness of the war. In any case, this was what I thought having been fed Honduran propaganda. An American or an Englishman might have a chance, although not necessarily. In Nacaome the day before we ■ ■ The soccer wer lasted one hundred hours. Its victims: 6,000 dead, more than 12,000 wounded. Fifty thousand people lost their homes and fields. Many villages were destroyed 47 had been shown an American missionary killed by the Salvadorans And El Salvador did not even maintain diplomatic relations with Poland so I would count for nothing The soldier was taken by surprise too Crawling through the bush he hadn t noticed me until the last moment He adjusted his helmet which was adorned with grass and leaves He had a dark skinny furrowed face In his hands there was an old Mauser Whoareyou'^ he asked And what army are you from'^ Honduras he said because he could tell right off that I was a foreigner neither his nor theirs Honduras! Dear brother! I rejoiced and pulled the piece of paper out of my pocket It was the document from the Honduran high command from Colonel Ramirez Ortega to the units at the front permitting me to enter the region of military activity Each of us had been given the same document in Tegucigalpa before leaving for the front I told the soldier that I had to get to Santa Rosa and then to Tegucigalpa so that I could send a dispatch to Warsaw Tbe sojdier was happy because he was already calculating ihai with an order from the general staff (the documents commanded all subordinates to assist me) he could withdraw to the rear along with me We will go together scnor the soldier said Senor will say that he has commanded me to accompany him He was a recruit a dirt farmer he had been called up a week ago he didn t know the army the war meant nothing to him He was BOOK EXTRACT trying to figure out how to survive it. Stealing through the forest I asked the soldier why they were fighting El Salvador. He replied that he did not know, that it was a government affair. I asked him how he could fight when he did not know why he was spilling blood. He answered that when you live in a village it's better not to ask questions because questions arouse the suspicions of the village mayor, and then the mayor would volunteer him for the road gang, and, on the road gang, he would have to neglect his farm and his family, and then the hunger waiting for him on his return would be even greater. The people at the guardpost led us to the battalion commander. T showed him my documents and asked for transportation to Tegucigalpa. That worthy man offered me a car but ordered me to stay put uniil morning because the roads were soaked and mountainous and ran along the edges ol cliffs, and at night, without lights, would be impassable. My soldier was dozing in a corner. At dawn I woke him up and said we were leaving. An exhausted battalion driver, still half-asleep, took us to Tegucigalpa in a jeep. To save time, we drove straight to the post office, where, on a borrowed typerwriter, I wrote the dispatch that was later printed in the newspapers at home. .Jose Malaga let the dispatch go out before all the others waiting to be sent and released it without the approval of the military censors (it was, after all, written in Polish). T he soccer war lasted one hundred hours. Its victims: 6,000 dead, more than 12,000 wounded. Fifty thousand people lost their homes and fields. Many villages were destroyed. The two countries ceased military action because Latin American states intervened, but to this day there are exchanges of gunfire along the Honduras-El Salvador border, and people die, and villages are burned. These are the real reasons for the war: El Salvador, the smallest countryin Central America, has the greatest population density in the western hemisphere (over 160 people per square kilometre). Things are crowded, and all the more so because most of the land is in the hands of founeen great landowning clans. People even say that El Salvador is the property of fourteen families. A thousand latifundistas own exaaly ten times as much land as their hundred thousand peasants. Two thirds of the village population owns no land. For years a part of the landless poor has been emigrating to Honduras, where there are large tracts of unimproved land. Honduras (12,000 square kilometres) is almost six times as large as El Salvador, but has about half as many people (2,500,000). This was illegal emigration but was kept hushed-up, tolerated by the Honduran government for years. Salvadoran peasants settled in Honduras, established villages, and grew accustomed to a belter life than the one they had left behind. They numbered about 300,000. In the 1960s, unrest began among the Honduran peasantry, which was demanding land, and the Honduras government passed a decree on agricultural reform. But since this was an oligarchical government, dependent on the United States, the decree did not break up the land of either the oligarchy or the large banana plantations belonging to the United Fruit Company. The government wanted to re-distribute the land occupied by the Salvadoran squatters, meaning that the 300,000 Salvadorans would have to return to their own country, where they had nothing and where, in any event, they would be refused by the Salvadoran government, fearing a peasant revolution. Relations between the two countries were tense. Newspapers on both sides waged a campaign of hate, slander and abuse, calling each other Nazis, dwarfs, drunkards, sadists, spiders, aggressors and thieves. There were pogroms. Shops were burned. In these circumstances the match between Honduras and EL Salvador had taken place. The war ended in a stalemate. The border remained the same. It is a border established by sight in the bush, in mountainous terrain that both sides claim. Some of the emigres returned to El Salvador and some of them are still living in Honduras. And both governments are satisfied; for several days Honduras and El Salvador occupied the front pages of the world press and were the object of interest and concern. The only chance small countries from the Third World have of evoking a lively international interest is when they decide to shed blood. This is a sad truth, but so it is. The deciding game of the best-of-three series was held on neutral ground, in Mexico (El Salvador won, three-two). The Honduran fans were placed on one side of the stadium, the Salvadoran fans on the other side, and down the middle sat 5,000 Mexican police armed with thick clubs. # The two countries ceased military action because Latin American states intervened, but to this day there are exchanges of gunfire along the Honduras-El Salvador border and people die, and villages are burned 49 MAILBAG , hiMfVRi.

Was there any thought that maybe you could Just wait it out. IVAN LENDL: Well it cenainly was difficult. It IS never easy. Something like that; it is not something which you deal with everyday. You deal with pressure of matches everyday and so on and so on. This, you deal with only once. Just listening to my physician, he told me it is not going to get better by waiting it out. IVAN LENDL: As many of you know, I have been struggling with a back problem since the Dubai tournament in February, It was diagnosed as facet Joint syndrome and I have received a number of medical treatments. At first my back partially responded to the treatments; however, my condition has gotten worse since the V.S, Open and I can no longer play. It proba bly doesn't come as a surprise to you then that lam retiring from professional tennis. Itisa very diW^lt and bad time for me. It is not the way I would have chosen to retire and I am sure, I Ivan, which do you feel is your most important victory^ the one with the most satisfaction? It is hard to tell. From the major tournaments I have won, every time I felt satisfied and if I had to choose between French '84, U.S. Open '85 and the Australia '89,1 probably would have to choose the '84 French because that really has helped to turn my career around and gave me a lot of confidence for the future years. Where do you walk away—what is your regret, is therea gut*wrenching thing that maybe keeps you up at nights from your career? No. There is not. Of course if 1 was 1S or 16 again and I knew about the game then, what I know now, I would have done many things earlier or did a little differently or added something, but unfortunately, that is not the case and you obviously learn as the time goes on. You don't come with the full knowledge, so that is not an option. Do you have any idea what you are going to do now? Well, I am going to spend a lot more time with my family and also I am going to get more involved in running our business here. What exactly is Spectrum Sports (LendPs sports promotion company) involved in now? We manage two of our tennis clubs and we are certainly looking into some expansion in terms of doing other things; hopefully, some in tennis also which is definitely something 1 would like to do. I When you also see the younger players—and I think Pete Sampras is probably a notable exception to this—does it concern you that they are not learning any of those lessons that they are building their careers around chasing the money rather than chasing major championships? Well, it is hard to tell for me whether they are doing what you are saying. I am certainly not involved closely enough with their schedule makings and so on and so on to see if they are not concerned about major championships and they are concerned with money. As far as I can see there are quite a few players; especially the top players, who are doing their schedules and training towards the majors. I think once the player feels that he has a legitimate chance to win a major, then they do that. If they don't feel that way, 1 guess they won't do it. But to tell—to say yes, it IS sad or| it is not sad I really don't know the situation enough What concerns you as you look to the future of tennis—you say you tMil talOMlU MtMMttMM WWl tiftllMfllUl Asd flffnflBBlflM WlIVyH^ VIW wanttostayinv<rivedlntlicsport —what would you want to put your offorts In terms of making the sport better? Well I think the sport Is in much better shape than it has been ot— than what people are let to believe. Ihe sales are probably down because of the equipment being better and the rackets not getting warped in the closets and so on. You. can buy one racket and It could last for many, many years. Also competing against many other sports and entertainment values than in the past, but the number of playing public is quite high and I am not absolutely familiar with the number, but I think the popularity of the game is there. As far as the professional game itself I would like to see it slow down a little bit. I think the men's game is getting a bit too powerful and maybe slowing down the courts and the balls would be definitely the answer.

My back doesn't pormlt me to do that. If goes into spasms after a while. So I would like to be Involved with the game in some other capacity, but not playing. If you had been able to play for a few more years. Is there one more thing that you would be chasing; one tWiv that you feel you never leally got to do or didn't accomplish? Well, obviously I didn't win Wimbledon and I would have liked to, but it would be unrealistic to say yeah, this is what I would like to have achieved in the next three, four years or how long I would have played. I thtnic more what I would be looking for is a lot of fun and enjoyment without any pressure. Going bach to your Injury again is there anything that you could have done early. I mean, we know so much more about training now and fitness and keeping In shape. mmmm Ivan Lendl's Career Chart Hamburg FiSMbOpaa Washlnaton Montraal UlOpaa Sydnay*indoor |jondon*lndoor MomaCaito Roms Toronto Bordeaux Sydney*lndoor Stockholm - -- »-r V-'>' ’‘j Is there anything you could have done to have avoided the back injury? You mean, lei us say 10, 12 years ago? I think the hardcourts are the main culprit of something like that The hard surfaces really, really hurt it. As you know, with the schedules, the tournaments especially in the summer in the United States you don't have much option. Wimbledon: obviously that was the one biggy that you missed out on. Perhaps looking back with the benefit of hindsight, what might you have changed about your game to try to reach that goal or your preparation? WelCsomcthing like that is very difficult with the hindsight; maybe for grass, since I was a kid, I would have to look at it and say, okay, this is how I should play there and I need to be more comfortable at the net and attacking and moving on grass and so on and so on, and maybe I would need to have a defensive style of game. And this is something very difficult to do and lake that risk. For that very reason, I admire Nick Faldo tremendously because I met him in Australia—I believe it was—before the first Australian Open at Flinders Park, so it would be early January 1988 at Sanauary Cove and he was there working on his game, I said, \"Nick, what are you doing here?\" He said, \"Well, I am reworking my game.\" I said, \"come on, you are 20 in the world. What is wrong with your Nicknaiiwd tba 'Ostrava GhosT, Undl bacoma oat of tho bast playois in tbs world game?\" He said, \"I can get better. I know 1 am going to hit rock bottom before I get better but Tm willing to take the chance.\" That was very courageous for me and 1 admire him for that. Maybe if I did something like that in '82, '83, it could have been a different story, but being'No. 2 and 3 in the world at that time, I didn't have the same kind of courage as Faldo. You talked about your back condition. 1 mean, are you concerned about, you know, ten years down the road? Is it the sort of thing that does get worse even though you are stopping this rigorous exercise of playing tennis? Well, the way lunderstand it from the dcKtors, if I take good care of it and don't do any impact exercises, it should be all right. Are you in pain at the moment from the probiem? No, I am not. I have some days when I have some aches in the morning, but unless I do something which is like running or basketball, or things like that, 1 am not in pain, no. You said in your statement this was not the way you would have chosen to retire. Obviously, that is the case. If you could have written a script, how would you have chosen to retire? Well, you know, ideally you would choose to retire on a winning note; win a big tournament and play well there and maybe win and then retire. But that is not realistic. That is a fairytale. The way 1 would have chosen to retire, realistically, is just play some more years; have fun and then just say \"thank you very much, I have enjoyed myself and it is time to go on.\" How do you think you will be remembered and how would you like to be remembered? Well, that is not something for me to decide, firstofall. And 1 think I will 56 SPECIAL FEATURE leave it up to you, ladies and gentlemen there, but I think you just look at the record and go from there. Talking about slowing down the game and ideas for the game, could you expand on that a little bit about the game being too fast? Well, I think it is very powerful in terms of serving in men's tennis. I don't think it has to do anything with the racket because the players used that most as their weapon—Sampras, Ivanisevic and so on and they use a fairly conventional head size. They don't use wider bodies on the racket or anything like that, so it has to be that the bails are getting strong and the courts have been progressively more faster over the last five, six years and just last year, 1 noticed that they have been slowing down. I think the courts and the balls have been slowing down at the U.S. Open and this Championship and I think it has benefited the game and the quality of tennis very much. I think it was—the danger is that you will see just serve and return; maybe hit or miss and not too many rallies and I think that is what the fans wants to see, more rallies. So that is why I say slowing down the bails and the courts would benefit the quality of the game. Would the back injury affect your golf game and would you seriously consider changing sports? Changing sports that would be fun, but not reaDy. As you know, it is not as easy. Michael Jordan is finding that out. But 1 still hope that 1 will be able to enjoy golf and have some good rounds. Any chance that you might be coaching In the future? Well, 1 don't really see that at the moment, but 1 haven't really given it that much of a thought and I am sure we will find out in the future. But if I were to answer right now, 1 would say no. What do you think is the best thing that happened to you during your pro career and what do you think was the worst thing that happened to you during that time? Oh, well, 1 think as we said winning is tremendous and that is something you will cherish for the rest of your life, so 1 will say the best thing which happened to me was winning the '84 French Open. You have disappointments when you are playing well and when you get very far in the tournament and then lose. So 1 don't think you can single one loss over the others, and 1 don't think you can really easily single one win over the others. Those would be the highs and lows. Do you look at the game of tennis differently now than you did, let us say when you first started out and If so, how so? Well, I look at it from a different perspective. I look for different things. When you are starting out, you are just looking well, how am 1 going to be good enough, what 1 need to improve to break into the top hundred and so on and so on. As you go on, your goals, that you want to achieve change, and you Stan looking for other things to improve. Looking to getting fitter, stronger and so on. That is the way 1 have been looking at it lately. How difficult a decision was this? 1 know, obviously, you are changing your whole life, but you sound unaffected right now. When did you make the decision? 1/iniat was the kind of evolution of the whole thing and what was It like to come to this conclusion? Well, after the U. S. Open I have been having more and more problems. It has gotten more serious and so I have been trying to get better, try to play a 57 SPECIAL FEATURE couple of the senior events, realised that 1 can't even play in those because of the pain and my back going into the spasms and I have been trying to come to grips with it. And it has been a while, so I think 1 am getting my handle on it. What do you look to replace the competitiveness? Obviously, as a professional tennis player, you are very competitive. Do you have anything that can replace this competitiveness? It is difficult but hopefully on my golf game can get good enough to compete on the club levels and have some fun with that Can you talk a little bit about some of your favourite opponents, obviously you are the last of an era. What are the memories you have of some of your old opponents? My fa"
