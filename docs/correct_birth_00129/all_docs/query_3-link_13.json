He won six Grand Slam men's doubles titles, five with Jacco Eltingh and one with Yevgeny Kafelnikov.\n\nHaarhuis was born on February 19, 1966 in Eindhoven in the Netherlands. He played tennis for Armstrong State College and Florida State University. He supports PSV Eindhoven.\n\nHe is best known for his success in doubles with fellow countryman Jacco Eltingh, winning five Grand Slam titles together, although some would say he is best known for his 4 set loss to Jimmy Connors in the 1991 U.S. Open Quarterfinals. In his career, he won one singles title and 54 doubles titles.\n\nHe is, together with Sergi Bruguera, Richard Krajicek, Leander Paes, and Michael Stich, one of the players of the same generation with a positive head-to-head record against Pete Sampras: 3–1.\n\nHis best Grand Slam singles performance was reaching the quarterfinals of the 1991 US Open, where he defeated Eric Jelen, Andrei Chesnokov, top seed Boris Becker and Carl-Uwe Steeb, before losing to Jimmy Connors.\n\nAfter retiring, he won the end-of-year Blackrock Masters Tennis tournament in the Royal Albert Hall in 2005 and 2006, beating legends such as Goran Ivanišević and John McEnroe. He completed a hat-trick of victories in the tournament in 2007, beating Frenchman Guy Forget.\n\nIn 2014 Haarhuis succeeded Manon Bollegraf as captain of the Netherlands Fed Cup team."
