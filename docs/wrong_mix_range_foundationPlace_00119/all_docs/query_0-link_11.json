Who are the biggest AWS users, and what kind of workloads are they using AWS for?\n\nAWS Provides Services in Domains:\n\nAWS Users\n\nAccording to Amazon, the number of active AWS users exceeds 1,000,000.\n\nHere are the names that are on record publicly as using AWS:\n\nAdobe, Airbnb, Alcatel-Lucent, AOL, Acquia, AdRoll, AEG, Alert Logic, Autodesk, Bitdefender, BMW, British Gas, Baidu, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Canon, Capital One, Channel 4, Chef, Citrix, Coinbase, Comcast, Coursera, Disney, Docker, Dow Jones, European Space Agency, ESPN, Expedia, Financial Times, FINRA, General Electric, GoSquared, Guardian News & Media, Harvard Medical School, Hearst Corporation, Hitachi, HTC, IMDb, International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research, International Civil Aviation Organization, ITV, iZettle, Johnson & Johnson, JustGiving, JWT, Kaplan, Kellogg’s, Lamborghini, Lonely Planet, Lyft, Made.com, McDonalds, NASA, NASDAQ OMX, National Rail Enquiries, National Trust, Netflix, News International, News UK, Nokia, Nordstrom, Novartis, Pfizer, Philips, Pinterest, Quantas, Reddit, Sage, Samsung, SAP, Schneider Electric, Scribd, Securitas Direct, Siemens, Slack, Sony, SoundCloud, Spotify, Square Enix, Tata Motors, The Weather Company, Twitch, Turner Broadcasting,Ticketmaster, Time Inc., Trainline, Ubisoft, UCAS, Unilever, US Department of State, USDA Food and Nutrition Service, UK Ministry of Justice, Vodafone Italy, WeTransfer, WIX, Xiaomi, Yelp, Zynga and Zillow\n\nThe Big Spenders\n\nClearly, AWS is the cloud computing platform of choice for businesses across a range of industries. But who are the biggest, and how much money are they spending on these services?\n\nAccording to Intricately, the top ten AWS users based on EC2 monthly spend are:\n\nNetflix: $19 million\n\nTwitch: $15 million\n\nLinkedIn: $13 million\n\nFacebook: $11 million\n\nTurner Broadcasting: $10 million\n\nBBC: $9 million\n\nBaidu: $9 million\n\nESPN: $8 million\n\nAdobe: $8 million\n\nTwitter: $7 million\n\nA Few AWS Case Studies\n\nLet's have a closer look at some of AWS's biggest clients:\n\nNetflix Pushing AWS\n\nAmong enterprises, Netflix was the most prominent early user of AWS, adopting it in 2009.\n\nAccording to an article in Business Insider from January 2016, Netflix placed enormous demands on the resources available to AWS at the time, often pushing the service to its limits and beyond. The ongoing pressure from Netflix, combined with Amazon's willingness to improve its service and meet its customers' requirements, pushed AWS to develop into the full, enterprise-scale integrated set of services that it is today.\n\nNASA\n\nAbout NASA\n\nEstablished in 1958, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has been working around the world—and off of it—for almost 60 years, trying to answer some basic questions: What’s out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\n\nDevelopment of the new NASA Image and Video Library was handled by the Web Services Office within NASA’s Enterprise Service and Integration Division. Technology selection, solution design, and implementation was managed by InfoZen (acquired by and now operating as ManTech International), the WESTPrime contract service provider. As an Advanced Consulting Partner of the AWS Partner Network (APN), ManTech International chose to build the solution on Amazon Web Services (AWS). “Amazon was the largest cloud services provider, had a strong government cloud presence, and offered the most suitable cloud in terms of elasticity,” recalls Sandeep Shilawat, Cloud Program Manager at ManTech International.\n\nNASA formally launched its Image and Video Library in March 2017. Key features include:\n\n• A user interface that automatically scales for PCs, tablets, and mobile phones across virtually every browser and operating system.\n\n• A search interface that lets people easily find what they’re looking for, including the ability to choose from gallery view or list view and to narrow-down search results by media type and/or by year.\n\n• The ability to easily download any media found on the site—or share it on Pinterest, Facebook, Twitter, or Google+.\n\n• Access to the metadata associated with each asset, such as file size, file format, which center created the asset, and when it was created. When available, users can also view EXIF/camera data for still images such as exposure, shutter speed, and lens used.\n\n• An application programming interface (API) for automated uploads of new content—including integration with NASA’s existing authentication mechanism.\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe NASA Image and Video Library is a cloud-native solution, with the front-end web app separated from the backend API. It runs as immutable infrastructure in a fully automated environment, with all infrastructure defined in code to support continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).\n\nIn building the solution, ManTech International took advantage of the following AWS services:\n\n• Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), which provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. This enables NASA to scale up under load and scale down during periods of inactivity to save money, and pay for only what it uses.\n\n• Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), which is used to distribute incoming traffic across multiple Amazon EC2 instances, as required to achieve redundancy and fault-tolerance.\n\n• Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), which supports object storage for incoming (uploaded) media, metadata, and published assets.\n\n• Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS), which is used to decouple incoming jobs from pipeline processes.\n\n• Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), which is used for automatic synchronization and failover.\n\n• Amazon DynamoDB, a fast and flexible NoSQL database service, which is used to track incoming jobs, published assets, and users.\n\n• Amazon Elastic Transcoder, which is used to transcode audio and video to various resolutions.\n\n• Amazon CloudSearch, which is used to support searching by free text or fields.\n\n• Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS), which is used to trigger the processing pipeline when new content is uploaded.\n\n• AWS CloudFormation, which enables automated creation, updating, and destruction of AWS resources. ManTech International also used the Troposphere library, which enables the creation of objects via AWS CloudFormation using Python instead of hand-coded JSON—each object representing one AWS resource such as an instance, an Elastic IP (EIP) address, or a security group.\n\n• Amazon CloudWatch, which provides a monitoring service for AWS cloud resources and the applications running on AWS.\n\nAn Image and Video Library for the Future\n\nThrough its use of AWS, with support from ManTech International, NASA is making its vast wealth of pictures, videos, and audio files—previously in some 60 “collections” across NASA’s 10 centers—easily discoverable in one centralized location, delivering these benefits:\n\n• Easy Access to the Wonders of Space. The Image and Video Library automatically optimizes the user experience for each user’s particular device. It is also fully compliant with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, which requires federal agencies to make their technology solutions accessible to people with disabilities. Captions can be turned on or off for videos played on the site, and text-based caption files can be downloaded for any video.\n\n• Built-in Scalability. All components of the NASA Image and Video Library are built to scale on demand, as needed to handle usage spikes. “On-demand scalability will be invaluable for events such as the solar eclipse that’s happening later this summer—both as we upload new media and as the public comes to view that content,” says Bryan Walls, Imagery Experts Deputy Program Manager at NASA.\n\n• Good Use of Taxpayer Dollars. By building its Image and Video Library in the cloud, NASA avoided the costs associated with deploying and maintaining server and storage hardware in-house. Instead, the agency can simply pay for the AWS resources it uses at any given time.\n\nAudi\n\nZeroLight, an AWS Partner Network (APN) Technology Partner, is an automotive visualization specialist, empowering brands to reach customers with compelling real-time 3D experiences, wherever they are. The company’s focus on reach, engagement and analytics drives personalization at scale throughout the customer journey, transforming both the buying experience and sales process.\n\nZeroLight uses a range of AWS technologies to deliver real-time 3D car configuration via the cloud. Core components of 2D/3D online services run on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), primarily for GPU G2 instances. Amazon Elastic BeanStalk is used in the management of GPU farms, while Amazon Cloud Formation allows deployments to be both repeatable and scalable. Image retention is handled through Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3). Users can securely and directly connect to dynamic GPU instances using Amazon’s DNS service (Route53). Amazon VPC securely separates systems, protecting assets, while Amazon CloudWatch and Amazon CloudTrail monitor the virtual infrastructure.\n\nFirst deployed at CES 2018, the Audi connected customer journey shows first-hand how an integrated ecosystem can enhance the overall user experience. With a consumer-centric focus, the deployment satisfies and adapts to the preferences of each individual, allowing them to harness the latest technology to make an informed purchase decision.\n\nPokémon\n\nThe Pokémon Company International, a subsidiary of The Pokémon Company in Japan, manages the property outside of Asia and is responsible for brand management, licensing, marketing, the Pokémon Trading Card Game, the animated TV series, home entertainment, and the official Pokémon website. Pokémon was launched in Japan in 1996, and today is one of the most popular children's entertainment properties in the world.\n\nPokémon initially sought a cloud-focused, highly mobile, and highly automated platform or product to serve as the foundation for its security architecture. The company needed a platform that could integrate with a wide range of AWS-native and third-party tooling. Arguably most important for Visneski was identifying a partner with whom his team could collaborate and work closely.\n\nApple\n\nWhen it comes to any aspect of its business, Apple is pretty secretive. But according to a 2019 report by CNBC, it happens to be one of the biggest spenders on AWS services. People familiar with the setup told the American broadcaster that the Cupertino-based firm spends over $30 million per month on Amazon cloud computing services.\n\nThe iPhone maker hasn’t confirmed these claims, but with growing demand for internet services such as iCloud and Apple Music, it makes sense that the firm would need a comprehensive cloud solution. CNBC points out that Apple has worked with other cloud providers, including Google and Microsoft, in the past.\n\nLenovo\n\nLenovo, a multinational company headquartered in China and the United States, is one of the largest technology companies in the world, with $43 billion in revenue, hundreds of millions of customers, and four devices sold per second. Lenovo's \"Intelligent Transformation\" initiative is aimed at transforming its customers’ experiences with technology through constant innovation and a broad range of connected devices.\n\nThe company set out to identify a tool that could automate all of the modelling and forecasting steps it needed to take to drive predictions. The team turned to DataRobot, an AWS Partner Network (APN) Advanced Technology Partner and AWS ML Competency Partner. DataRobot offers an automated machine learning platform for data scientists of all skill levels to quickly build and deploy accurate machine learning models. And by running DataRobot Cloud on AWS, users across the organization can build world-class prediction models in minutes.\n\nPreviously, the Lenovo Brazil team would select an algorithm, run the cleansed datasets through the model, work on parameter optimization, retrain the model, score it, and adjust it to improve its accuracy. Using DataRobot, the team was able to automate and accelerate its previously arduous model-building process.\n\nWith accurate sell-out volume predictions for up to four weeks ahead, the Lenovo Brazil team can work with business stakeholders within Lenovo, as well as local Brazilian retailers, to define actions in the appropriate time, avoiding a lack or excess of inventory. Achieving a better balance of supply and demand improves the bottom line for both Lenovo and their participating retailers in Brazil.\n\nSince DataRobot implemented their solution, Lenovo's model creation time has decreased from four weeks to three days. Model production time has decreased from two days to five minutes. Additionally, prediction accuracy has increased from less than 80 percent to 87.5 percent.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nBy now, you should have a better understanding of who uses AWS and how. However, what else sets AWS apart? Here are some interesting statistics about the cloud platform.\n\nRevenue\n\nSince launching in 2006, AWS has expanded exponentially, with Statistic stating that net sales were $25.5 billion in 2019. In the second quarter of 2020, revenues of AWS grew 29 percent compared to the preceding quarter. AWS is one of Amazon's strongest revenue segments, generating 35.03 billion U.S. dollars in 2019 net sales, up from 17.46 billion U.S. dollars in 2017. AWS ranks as one of the most popular public cloud infrastructure and platform services running applications worldwide in 2019, ahead off Azure and Google cloud services.\n\nUsers\n\nAWS wouldn’t be able to achieve such impressive revenues if it weren’t for a growing customer base. AWS claims to serve “millions of customers”, which include “fastest-growing startups, largest enterprise and leading government agencies”. In 2016, ArsTechnica reported that AWS had more than a million users.\n\nDevelopers are an important demographic for AWS. According to Statistica, 26.6% of software developers used AWS services last year. Meanwhile, 19% of connected devices run on AWS in 2019.\n\nServices, Regions and Partners\n\nWhen it comes to the product itself, AWS currently provides “175 featured services from data centres globally”. The firm operates data centres across the US, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, the UK, India, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden and Brazil, as well as one exclusive region for the US Government and two regions for Chinese customers. AWS also operates a large partner network, which is comprised of over 8,000 businesses that can help customers implement and build applications on the platform.\n\nThe AWS Opportunity\n\nFor many different organisations, the use of AWS is evidently widespread. But it’s not just interesting to see companies of varying industries implementing Amazon’s cloud tools.\n\nThey’re also using it for different use cases, whether it’s mitigating cyber security threats or developing faster websites. The opportunity here is huge. What great things will you achieve with AWS?"
