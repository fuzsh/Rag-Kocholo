        "text": "Can the US Stock Market Rally Continue?\n\nIn a recent episode of the Goldman Sachs Exchanges podcast, David Kostin, chief US equity strategist, shares his outlook for US stocks for the second half of the year and the risks that could derail their record rally.\n\nBehind the\n\nGoldman Sachs IPO\n\nDan Dees was an associate in equity capital markets when he was tapped to join the deal team that took Goldman Sachs public in 1999. Today, heâs co-head of Global Banking and Markets. We sat down with Dan to reflect on the critical moments of the IPO that still resonate deeply with him 25 years later.\n\nCelebrating 50 Years in Japan with a New Office\n\nInvestments in our workspaces reflect the firmâs commitment to delivering excellence for clients and for our people. As Goldman Sachs celebrates 50 years in Japan, our Tokyo colleagues moved into a new, state-of-the-art office space that features purpose-built work stations with bespoke technology solutions. âTeamwork has always been at the core of Goldman Sachsâ culture, and our new workspace promises to help us take our collaboration to the next level.â said Hidehiro Imatsu, president of Goldman Sachs in Japan.\n\nEuromoney Recognized Goldman Sachs for Excellence in Advisory and Innovation\n\nWeâre proud to be recognized for the deep expertise, exceptional execution, and innovative solutions that our teams deliver to clients day after day. At the 2024 Awards for Excellence, Euromoney honored our #1 M&A advisory group with the award for Worldâs Best Bank for Advisory and â for the second time â recognized the firm for Financial Innovation of the Year, in honor of Marquee."
