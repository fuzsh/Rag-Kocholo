The wildflower season is officially over, with only a few remaining cacti blooms and small pockets of flowers here and there.\n\nWatch for blooms starting in the higher elevations, including Cuyamaca Rancho State Park. You can follow Cuyamaca Rancho State Park’s updates on their Facebook page here.\n\nThank you for following along during what was a spectacular wildflower season! As we say goodbye to the wildflowers until next time, we hope you made some memories and experienced the bloom.\n\nIf you’d like to receive non-wildflower Park updates, event information, and tips for exploring the Park, please subscribe here.\n\nIf you’d like to support our work, including our conservation efforts, please consider a donation today!\n\nDirections to most recent wildflower areas:\n\nHenderson Canyon Rd. from Borrego Springs Town Center:\n\nDrive east along Palm Canyon Drive and continue halfway around the Christmas Circle roundabout, then turn right back onto Palm Canyon Drive.\n\nIn about a half-mile turn left onto DiGeorgio Road.
