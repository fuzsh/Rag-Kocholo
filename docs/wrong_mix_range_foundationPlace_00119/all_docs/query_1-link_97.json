A copy of the final determination letter from the IRS must be submitted with the application. Note: Under limited circumstances, the Foundation may consider an application from an organization that does not have 501(c)(3) status, but that has found an organization with a 501(c)(3) willing to serve as a fiscal sponsor. A group submitting such a request must contact the Foundation to receive specific requirements and instructions.\n\nThe proposed project must directly benefit the people of Santa Barbara and/or Ventura and/or San Luis Obispo Counties.\n\nThe applicant must demonstrate that it has all of the following: a) local leadership in the form of Board representation or an advisory board b) broad-based local support c) local program management and accountability.\n\nApplicants located outside Santa Barbara, Ventura and/or San Luis Obispo Counties must demonstrate knowledge of the Tri-County needs and local organizations providing similar services, as well as having explored opportunities for collaboration.\n\nThe Foundation supports organizations that do not discriminate in their employment practices, volunteer opportunities, or delivery of programs and services on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, national origin, ancestry, age, medical condition, disability, veteran status, marital status, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic protected by law. Any funding request that would support any project of an organization whose own policies run counter to the Foundation’s nondiscrimination policy may be denied even if the requesting organization meets all of the other criteria for funding.\n\n+ Fields of Interest Categories\n\nThrough its capital and program grants, the Foundation awards funds through a competitive process to qualified organizations in the following five field of interest areas:\n\nCommunity Enhancement and Environment\n\nThe Foundation is keenly aware and supportive of the need for the preservation and restoration of the natural environment, and the development and enhancement of the economic and civic well being of the community. Included in this field of interest are land acquisition and protection organizations, animal welfare agencies, and groups that enhance neighborhoods and citizen participation. Specifically, the Foundation supports agencies that:\n\nencourage citizen participation in the strengthening of local communities and neighborhoods\n\npromote projects and practices that preserve and restore the quality of our natural environment\n\nCulture and Recreation\n\nThe Foundation is mindful of the importance of enhancing programs, extending accessibility and broadening the scope and reach of cultural and recreational institutions. In addition to traditional recreational, cultural and art institutions, this field of interest also includes community centers and park friends groups. We support organizations that:\n\npromote the creation and appreciation of and accessibility to a diverse mixture of arts and culture\n\nprovide opportunities for leisure or sporting activities\n\nEducation and Personal Development\n\nThe Foundation supports the expectation that all members of the community will be afforded an equal opportunity to rise to their potential.

Specifically, we support agencies that:\n\nprovide or improve access to learning opportunities\n\nreach out to our diverse population with a wide variety of educational activities aimed at improving the whole person\n\nteach specific skills to a particular population\n\nHealth and Human Services\n\nThe Foundation recognizes a responsibility to help ensure that health care, prevention/wellness, shelter, sustenance and social services are provided throughout the community. This encompasses programs that address the basic needs required by all and the special needs required by a few. Counseling, day care and senior centers, transportation providers, and those agencies that ease entering and leaving this life are included in this field of interest. The Foundation supports organizations that:\n\naddress basic needs such as food and shelter\n\nstrengthen preventive care and improve access to services\n\ndevelop the skills and independence of people with special needs, including those with drug and alcohol addictions, physical disabilities and mental illness\n\neducate the public and provide support services for those affected by a specific disease or ailment\n\nNative American\n\nThe Foundation is committed to preserving Native American Culture and continuing the traditions established by our Native American ancestors.

Specifically, we support organizations that:\n\neducate and share Native American culture and tradition with the general public\n\npreserve customs and traditions handed down to Native people through the ages\n\nteach Native youth about Native traditions\n\ncelebrate the rich cultural heritage of our nation’s first people\n\n+ Elements of a Successful Submission\n\nThe Business Council favors applications that have the following elements:\n\nThe application can clearly articulate and demonstrate the results its activities achieve for those it serves.\n\nThe request builds on an agency’s institutional strengths and encourages innovative solutions to community/agency problems and/or needs.\n\nAll relevant people are involved in the planning of the proposed project or activities.\n\nThe Foundation’s dollars are leveraged with other funding sources. It is unlikely that a request will be fully funded. Therefore, priority will be given to applicants who have a clear plan for securing additional support.\n\nA multi-agency/collaborative approach is utilized whenever possible.\n\nThe Foundation assumes that there is an organizational commitment to the project for which funds are being requested. With that in mind, a member of the governing board must sign the application.\n\n+ GRANT GUIDELINES\n\nFunds granted are limited in use to the purpose for which they are awarded.\n\nA request cannot exceed $75,000 per year. The grant period is one year in duration from the date of Business Council approval. If funds are not used within the 12-month period, the balance will be rescinded. The Foundation is not obligated to remind a grantee of unused funds.\n\nAn organization is eligible for only one capital or program grant per year. However, an agency that has recently merged with or acquired another nonprofit, and an agency serving as the fiscal sponsor on behalf of a community collaborative may be eligible to submit two applications within the appropriate grant cycle.\n\nApplicants may submit a capital or a program request.\n\nAn organization must submit a year-end follow up on the grant and provide an outlined narrative of how the funds were used and whether program goals were reached.\n\nCapital Grants\n\nGrants are available for the acquisition of a capital item or improvement of facilities. Items that do not constitute a capital request include videos, books, and websites, and “consumables” such as brochures, posters, T-shirts, uniforms, individual sports equipment, etc.\n\nThree competitive, comparable bids for each item must be submitted with the application.\n\nThe Foundation will not contribute more than once to a specific capital project.\n\nFunds cannot be used to reimburse an agency for items purchased prior to the grant award date.\n\nProgram Grants\n\nGrants are available for a new program or the expansion of an existing program.\n\nThe Foundation defines a program as a coherently packaged group of activities designed to result in a change for its participants. The change could be in behavior, attitude, skills, knowledge or condition.\n\nSanta Ynez Band of Chumash Indians Foundation grants are not intended to support programs in perpetuity. An applicant may choose to seek funding for the same program for a subsequent year, but if awarded, an agency cannot expect funding for the same project beyond the third year.\n\nFunds are to be used to support direct program costs, not indirect operating expenses.\n\nSuccessful applicants must agree to report program progress to the Foundation.\n\n+ FUNDING LEVELS\n\nThe Foundation considers three different funding levels in two different funding cycles throughout the year; January through March and May through July:\n\nActive grant funding cycles\n\nJanuary 1 through March 31\n\nMay 1 through July 31\n\nThe smallest funding level is for application requests in an amount of $1,000 or less.
