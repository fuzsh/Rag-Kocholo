        "text": "Bristol Manor Care is a senior care home in Davison, Michigan, providing companionship and assisted living services to the seniors of Genesee County. Davison is a small suburb of Flint, which makes it nice and quiet for all who live there. With its small town charm and comforting feel, the surrounding area offers residents the opportunity to live a relaxed, stress-free lifestyle. Enjoy time at home with fellow Bristol Manor Care residents or take a family day trip to explore the town.\n\nAt Bristol Manor Care, residents are given the foundation to feel happy, comfortable, and relaxed in a social and active atmosphere. They’re encouraged to practice their independence, but they also have access to the help they need at any time. Seniors feel right at home while enjoying amenities like restaurant-style dining, transportation to outings, on-site salon services, engaging activities, and visiting community speakers and guests.\n\nThe employees at Bristol Manor operate as if they are family members of those under their care, treating them with high levels of respect and carefully listening to their needs and concerns. Staff members are on site 24 hours a day, seven days a week to help make sure seniors are not only safe but...\n\nA Place for Mom has scored Bristol Manor Care 8.5 out of 10 using our proprietary review score.\n\nWe assign review scores to give a more reliable view into senior living communities and home care agencies. Our review scores prioritize reviews that are recent — the past 24 months — because we know families need current information when choosing senior care.\n\nThose with many recent, positive reviews receive a high review score, while providers with few recent reviews — regardless of how positive — receive a lower review score. Communities with no recent reviews will not have a review score, even if older reviews are positive. The maximum A Place for Mom review score a community can receive is 10 points."
