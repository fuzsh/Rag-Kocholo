        "text": "Access to Amazon Bedrock foundation models isn't granted by default. In order to gain access to a foundation model, an IAM user with sufficient permissions needs to request access to it through the console. Once access is provided to a model, it is available for all users in the account.\n\nTo manage model access, sign into the Amazon Bedrock console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/. Then select Model access at the bottom of the left navigation pane. The model access page lets you view a list of available models, the output modality of the model, whether you have been granted access to it, and the End User License Agreement (EULA). You should review the EULA for terms and conditions of using a model before requesting access to it. For information about model pricing, refer to Amazon Bedrock Pricing.\n\nNote\n\nYou can manage model access only through the console.\n\nAdd model access\n\nBefore you can use a foundation model in Amazon Bedrock, you must request access to it.\n\nIf you don't have permissions to request access to a model, an error banner appears. Contact your account administrator to ask them to request access to the model for you or to provide you permissions to request access to the model.\n\nRemove model access\n\nIf you no longer need to use a foundation model, you can remove access to it.\n\nNote\n\nYou can't remove access from Amazon Titan models, Mistral AI models, or from the Meta Llama 3 Instruct model.\n\nControl model access permissions\n\nTo control a role's permissions to request access to Amazon Bedrock models, attach an IAM policy to the role using any of the following AWS Marketplace actions.\n\nFor the aws-marketplace:Subscribe action only, you can use the aws-marketplace:ProductId condition key to limit subscription to specific models. The following table lists product IDs for Amazon Bedrock foundation models.\n\nThe following is the format of the IAM policy you can attach to a role to control model access permissions. To allow access to manage subscriptions to all models, you can omit the Condition field. To see an example policy, refer to Allow access to third-party model subscriptions."
