(S3) was created in 1986 with the support of Philips, with whom Professor Whelan had previously worked for 18 years. S3 started out designing integrated circuits, CAD tools, and embedded software and quickly established a reputation for technical excellence, customer focus, and superior project management.\n\nIn the 90’s, with a growing international customer base, S3 opened offices throughout Ireland and in the US. We opened our first international design office in Poland in 1997, followed by another in Prague in 1998.\n\nContinued growth and a solid reputation for innovation allowed S3 to attract top graduates from universities across Europe. To this day we continue to foster the future talent of the industry through placements and internships.\n\nS3 Group\n\nDuring the early 00’s we expanded into new industries and developed application-focused units for telecommunications, consumer electronics, wireless systems, and health. In 2006 the management team, supported by ACT Venture Capital, executed an MBO.\n\nAfter this, the company expanded under the name S3 Group. We began to infuse products into our service offerings and re-organized into three distinct businesses: S3 Semiconductors, S3 TV Technology, and S3 Connected Health.\n\nS3 Group became synonymous with excellence and won multiple awards in these three fields over the years. This success led to S3 TV Technology being acquired by Accenture in 2015 and S3 Semiconductors being acquired by Adesto Technologies Corp in May 2018.\n\nS3 Connected Health\n\nToday, as S3 Connected Health, we focus exclusively on health and remain committed to improving the lives of people with acute and chronic conditions.\n\nAfter 20 years of delivering award-winning digital health solutions, connected medical devices, and device-based services, we continue to drive meaningful change in healthcare.\n\nLearn more about our innovative solutions for medtech and pharma here."
