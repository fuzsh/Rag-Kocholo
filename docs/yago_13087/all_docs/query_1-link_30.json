        "text": "Early detection of congenital syphilis.\n\nPubMed\n\nChowdhary, Nagalakshmi; Rani, Bs Kavya; Mukunda, K S; Kiran, N K\n\n2014-01-01\n\nLate congenital syphilis is a very rare clinical entity, and its early diagnosis and treatment is essential. Dental findings often provide valuable evidence for the diagnosis of late congenital syphilis. It occurs due to the transmission of the disease from an infected mother to her fetus through placenta. This long forgotten disease continues to effect pregnant women resulting in perinatal morbidity and mortality. Congenital syphilis is a preventable disease, and its presence reflects a failure of prenatal care delivery system, as well as syphilis control programs. We are reporting a case of late congenital syphilis with only Hutchinson's teeth.\n\nVaried presentations of early congenital syphilis.\n\nPubMed\n\nBasu, Sriparna; Kumar, Ashok\n\n2013-06-01\n\nIn spite of availability of cost-effective preventive measures and treatment, a resurgence of congenital syphilis has currently been noted. During the past 4 years, we came across five low birth weight neonates with unusual symptoms, which subsequently proved to be manifestations of early congenital syphilis. All the mothers had apparently uneventful antenatal period. No investigation was done during pregnancy. They were unaware about their disease and were found to be positive for syphilis by Venereal Disease Research Laboratory Test and fluorescent treponemal antibody (absorbed) IgM test only after childbirth. Screening for other congenital infections was negative. All the neonates were positive for Venereal Disease Research Laboratory Test. They were treated with intravenous crystalline penicillin G for 10 days. Recovery was uneventful. We reemphasize the importance of raising public awareness, routine antenatal screening and treatment for all pregnant mothers to avoid such a potentially treatable condition.\n\nCongenital syphilis.\n\nPubMed\n\nCooper, Joshua M; SÃ¡nchez, Pablo J\n\n2018-04-01\n\nCongenital syphilis remains a major public health problem worldwide, and its incidence is increasing in the United States. This review highlights the ongoing problem of this preventable infection, and discusses vertical transmission and clinical manifestations while providing a practical algorithm for the evaluation and management of infants born to mothers with reactive serologic tests for syphilis. Every case of congenital syphilis must be seen as a failure of our public health system to provide optimal prenatal care to pregnant women, as congenital syphilis can be prevented by early and repeated prenatal serologic screening of mothers and penicillin treatment of infected women, their sexual partners, and their newborn infants.

It occurs due to the transmission of the disease from an infected mother to the unborn infant through the placenta. Congenital syphilis can involve any organ system and present with various symptoms. However, early diagnosis of congenital syphilis is difficult because more than half of the affected infants are asymptomatic, and the signs in symptomatic infants may be subtle and nonspecific. The continuing prevalence of this disease reveals the failure of control measures established for its prevention. Here we report a case of a one-month infant who presented with skin rash. The report stresses upon the importance of implementing the World Health Organization's recommendation that all pregnant women should be screened for syphilis in the first antenatal visit in the first trimester and again in the late pregnancy.\n\nCongenital syphilis: early- and late-stage findings of rhagades and dental anomalies.\n\nPubMed\n\nKhetarpal, Shilpi; Kempf, Ellen; Mostow, Eliot\n\n2011-01-01\n\nCongenital syphilis occurs via vertical transmission when Treponema pallidum crosses the placenta after the 16th week of gestation. Manifestations of congenital syphilis vary from asymptomatic infection to stillbirth. We present a case of congenital syphilis in a Vietnamese orphan who presented with rhagades, hearing deficit, and abnormal dentition after adoption in the United States. He demonstrated both early- and late-stage findings of congenital syphilis. He is presumed to be 5 years old, and it is uncertain if he received treatment. Upon arrival to the United States, his rapid plasma reagin test was negative, but his fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption test was positive, so no further treatment was recommended. It is possible that other late congenital syphilis stigmata may develop in his later years. The Centers for Disease Control recommends screening all pregnant women for syphilis at the beginning of prenatal care. Clinicians should be made aware of the manifestations of congenital syphilis, especially when caring for international orphans and children born to mothers who lacked prenatal care.

Congenital syphilis is a potentially serious pathology affecting newborns of infected mothers. This disease is easily curable by a simple antibiotic treatment. Because of systematic antenatal screening it should no longer exist in industrialized countries. Nevertheless, we report a case of a six-week-old infant with a delayed diagnosis of congenital syphilis. Physicians, especially gynaecologists, obstetricians and paediatricians, have to be vigilant in order to allow for early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of congenital syphilis.\n\n[Early congenital syphilis: a case report].\n\nPubMed\n\nCavagnaro S M, Felipe; Pereira R, Teresita; PÃ©rez P, Carla; Vargas Del V, Fernanda; Sandoval C, Carmen\n\n2014-02-01\n\nCongenital syphilis (CS) is a multisystemic infection of the newborn (NB) which can produce severe symptoms, and in some cases, even be fatal. In recent years, the incidence of syphilis has increased worldwide and similarly, the cases of CS in neonates have increased. To report two cases of early and severe presentation of CS, focusing on the importance of prevention of vertical transmission and monitoring of treated mothers. The diagnostic difficulties are discussed. Two premature newborns that were diagnosed with probable CS present in the newborn period are presented. In the first case, due to a high index of suspicion, but without confirmatory testing, treatment was started with good clinical response. In the second case, CS was confirmed through positive serology and the specific treatment was given. CS has significant diagnostic challenges as there is no test for early confirmation, therefore, a high index of suspicion might be key in the treatment and consequent prognosis. Due to the current epidemiology of the condition, it is also important to focus on preventive measures.\n\nSyphilis in children: congenital and acquired.\n\nPubMed\n\nWoods, Charles R\n\n2005-10-01\n\nSyphilis rates in women and congenital syphilis rates have declined steadily in the United States in recent years. However, syphilis remains a worldwide public health problem, with more than 12 million cases in adults and more than half a million pregnancies affected yearly. Prenatal screening and treatment programs are limited or nonexistent in many developing countries. The genome of Treponema pallidum, one of the smallest among prokaryotes, has been sequenced, but methods for continuous in vitro cultivation of the microbe remain elusive. There are no promising candidates for future vaccines at this time. Serologic testing, for both specific treponemal and nontreponemal antibodies, continues to be a primary means of diagnosis. Penicillin remains the drug of choice for congenital and acquired syphilis in childhood. The diagnosis of syphilis beyond early infancy raises concerns for possible child sexual abuse, although progression of congenital syphilis may account for some cases. Syphilis is a potentially eradicable disease, but this can be achieved only with sustained international will and cooperation to fund the necessary screening and treatment programs.\n\nPrenatal diagnosis of congenital syphilis presenting with transient pleural effusion in the fetus: a case report and rising incidence of congenital syphilis in South Korea.\n\nPubMed\n\nPark, J Y; Han, G H; Kwon, D Y; Hong, H R; Seol, H J\n\n2015-01-01\n\nCongenital syphilis is preventable and curable if maternal infection is detected early, and pregnant women in Korea are screened routinely for this disease. Nevertheless, the incidence of congenital syphilis is not decreasing. Prenatal diagnosis of congenital syphilis is difficult and treatment is usually based on maternal syphilis serology. Prenatal ultrasonographic examination may sometimes reveal abnormal features suggesting congenital infection. The authors report a case of congenital syphilis that was diagnosed in both fetus and asymptomatic mother following detection on prenatal ultrasonography of transient fetal pleural effusion. The case is noteworthy for its sonographic presentation as fetal pleural effusion rapidly resolved spontaneously.\n\nChallenges in congenital syphilis surveillance: how are congenital syphilis investigations classified?\n\nPubMed\n\nIntrocaso, Camille E; Gruber, DeAnn; Bradley, Heather; Peterman, Thomas A; Ewell, Joy; Wendell, Debbie; Foxhood, Joseph; Su, John R; Weinstock, Hillard S; Markowitz, Lauri E\n\n2013-09-01\n\nCongenital syphilis is a serious, preventable, and nationally notifiable disease. Despite the existence of a surveillance case definition, congenital syphilis is sometimes classified differently using an algorithm on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's case reporting form. We reviewed Louisiana's congenital syphilis electronic reporting system for investigations of infants born from January 2010 to October 2011, abstracted data required for classification, and applied the surveillance definition and the algorithm. We calculated the sensitivities and specificities of the algorithm and Louisiana's classification using the surveillance definition as the surveillance gold standard. Among 349 congenital syphilis investigations, the surveillance definition identified 62 cases. The algorithm had a sensitivity of 91.9% and a specificity of 64.1%. Louisiana's classification had a sensitivity of 50% and a specificity of 91.3% compared with the surveillance definition. The differences between the algorithm and the surveillance definition led to misclassification of congenital syphilis cases. The algorithm should match the surveillance definition. Other state and local health departments should assure that their reported cases meet the surveillance definition.\n\nEffectiveness of Prenatal Screening and Treatment to Prevent Congenital Syphilis, Louisiana and Florida, 2013-2014.\n\nPubMed\n\nMatthias, James M; Rahman, Mohammad M; Newman, Daniel R; Peterman, Thomas A\n\n2017-08-01\n\nFrom 2012 to 2014, rates of congenital syphilis increased in Louisiana and Florida. We evaluated the effectiveness of early (first or second) and third trimester syphilis screening for the prevention of congenital syphilis in these high-morbidity states. Reported syphilis cases among pregnant women in Louisiana and Florida during January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2014, were reviewed for documented screening for syphilis in the first 2 trimesters and third trimester. Pregnant women with syphilis were linked to congenital syphilis records and stratified by whether the pregnancy led to a reported congenital syphilis case. Seven hundred ten pregnant women with syphilis in Louisiana and Florida were linked to 155 congenital syphilis cases. Three hundred seventy (52%) pregnant women with syphilis were staged as early syphilis (n = 270) or high-titer late or unknown duration-latent syphilis (n = 100), and 109 (70% of the total) were linked to congenital syphilis cases. Screening in the first 2 trimesters identified 513 pregnant women who tested positive for syphilis, and 470 (92%) potential congenital syphilis were averted. One hundred nine pregnant women tested positive for syphilis in the third trimester, and 85 (78%) had babies without congenital syphilis. During their pregnancy, 85 (12%) women tested negative at least once, and 55 (65%) had babies with congenital syphilis. Thirty-nine women had no reported syphilis screening 30 days or longer before delivery. Screening for syphilis both early and in the third trimester prevented many pregnant women with syphilis from having a baby with congenital syphilis. Preventing all congenital syphilis would likely require preventing all syphilis among women.\n\nUse of National Syphilis Surveillance Data to Develop a Congenital Syphilis Prevention Cascade and Estimate the Number of Potential Congenital Syphilis Cases Averted.\n\nPubMed\n\nKidd, Sarah; Bowen, Virginia B; Torrone, Elizabeth A; Bolan, Gail\n\n2018-03-14\n\nRecent increases in reported congenital syphilis have led to an urgent need to identify interventions that will have the greatest impact on congenital syphilis prevention. We sought to create a congenital syphilis prevention cascade using national syphilis surveillance data to (1) estimate the proportion of potential congenital syphilis cases averted with current prevention efforts, and (2) develop a classification framework to better describe why reported cases were not averted. We reviewed national syphilis and congenital syphilis case report data from 2016, including pregnancy status of all reported female syphilis cases and data on prenatal care, testing, and treatment status of mothers of reported congenital syphilis cases to derive estimates of the proportion of pregnant women with syphilis who received prenatal care, syphilis testing, and adequate syphilis treatment at least 30 days prior to delivery, as well as the proportion of potential congenital syphilis cases averted. Among the 2,508 pregnant women who were reported to have syphilis, an estimated 88.0% received prenatal care at least 30 days prior to delivery, 89.4% were tested for syphilis at least 30 days prior to delivery, and 76.9% received an adequate treatment regimen that began at least 30 days prior to delivery. Overall, an estimated 1,928 (75.0%) potential congenital syphilis cases in the United States were successfully averted. Among states that reported at least 10 syphilis cases among pregnant women, the estimated proportion of potential congenital syphilis cases averted ranged from 55.0% to 92.3%. While the majority of potential congenital syphilis cases in the United States were averted in 2016, there was substantial geographic variation, and significant gaps in delivering timely prenatal care, syphilis testing, and adequate treatment to pregnant women with syphilis were identified. The congenital syphilis prevention cascade is a useful tool to quantify programmatic successes and identify\n\n[Maternal and congenital syphilis in four provinces in Bolivia].\n\nPubMed\n\nRevollo, Rita; Tinajeros, Freddy; Hilari, Carolina; GarcÃ­a, Sandra G; Zegarra, Lourdes; DÃ­az-Olavarrieta, Claudia; Conde-GonzÃ¡lez, Carlos J\n\n2007-01-01\n\nAssess frequencies of maternal and congenital syphilis, mother-child transmission and variables associated with syphilis in six urban hospitals in Bolivia. A cross-sectional study was performed between May and September 2004. We administered the Abbot Determine-TP rapid test and quantitative RPR to postpartum women without prior RPR. Sociodemographic variables and prior prenatal care visits were studied. Newborns of syphilis positive mothers were studied with Western Blot IgM p47 and ELISA IgM. Serum samples were analyzed at the Central Reference Laboratory (INLASA). Statistical analysis included bivariate and multivariate analyses to establish association with positive diagnosis of T. pallidum. Syphilis prevalence among 1 594 postpartum women was 7.2%. Mother to child transmission was 15.7%. Congenital syphilis prevalence by serology was 1.1% and 94% of these newborns displayed no symptoms. Despite 70.5% prenatal care coverage in Bolivia some women still go directly to a facility to give birth without prior routine tests for syphilis. Low education levels in both parents (< 8 years) and failure to attend prenatal care were strong predictors of congenital syphilis. Rapid syphilis tests constitute an important tool to strengthen early diagnosis of syphilis during pregnancy. Preventing congenital and maternal syphilis in Bolivia remains a public health priority.\n\nCongenital syphilis in Switzerland: gone, forgotten, on the return.\n\nPubMed\n\nMeyer Sauteur, Patrick M; TrÃ¼ck, Johannes; Bosshard, Philipp P; Tomaske, Maren; MorÃ¡n Cadenas, Francisca; Lautenschlager, Stephan; Goetschel, Philippe\n\n2012-01-11\n\nAcquired syphilis has re-emerged in many Western European countries. In contrast to international guidelines, screening for syphilis in pregnancy is not generally recommended in Switzerland. There has been an increase in the incidence of laboratory syphilis notifications in recent years, regardless of gender and age. We conducted a retrospective study, evaluating the total numbers of pregnant women with positive syphilis serology (Treponema pallidum Particle Agglutination assay, TPPA) from 2000 to 2009, and evaluated the clinical management and outcome of their offspring. In addition, we sought to determine cases of infectious syphilis (primary, secondary, and early latent syphilis) reported to the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health in women of childbearing age, which has previously been shown to precede changes in the incidence of congenital syphilis within a population. Out of 13,833 women who gave birth at our institution, positive syphilis serology was found in 9 pregnant women during the 10 years studied. A total of 6 pregnant women were diagnosed having syphilis infection during pregnancy. Regarding their offspring, 8 of the 9 newborns were tested serologically. One neonate experienced congenital syphilis because the adequately treated mother developed re-infection after treatment. Within the Swiss population, infectious syphilis cases in women of childbearing age increased substantially from 2006 to 2009. The epidemiologic data suggest that congenital syphilis could become a medical problem in Switzerland due to the rise of infectious syphilis cases in women of childbearing age that have been shown to be followed by changes in the congenital syphilis incidence. The persistence of congenital syphilis in Switzerland along with this rise of infectious syphilis in women of childbearing age suggests a potential for improvement of prenatal care and syphilis control programmes.\n\nCongenital Syphilis Masquerading as Leukemia.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Tiffany; Bell, Stephanie; Scimeme, Jason; Maraqa, Nizar\n\n2017-07-01\n\nAs of late, the incidence of congenital syphilis in the United States is increasing. Each new case represents a failure of preventing, diagnosing, and treating syphilis in pregnant women. Pediatricians should confirm that all women have received adequate screening for and management of syphilis during pregnancy. Congenital syphilis is easily treatable but may be a diagnostic challenge with high morbidity and mortality.\n\nEarly Childhood Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in Infants Exposed to Infectious Syphilis In Utero.\n\nPubMed\n\nVerghese, Valsan P; Hendson, Leonora; Singh, Ameeta; Guenette, Tamara; Gratrix, Jennifer; Robinson, Joan L\n\n2018-06-01\n\nThere are minimal neurodevelopmental follow-up data for infants exposed to syphilis in utero. This is an inception cohort study of infants exposed to syphilis in utero. We reviewed women with reactive syphilis serology in pregnancy or at delivery in Edmonton (Canada), 2002 through 2010 and describe the neurodevelopmental outcomes of children with and without congenital syphilis. There were 39 births to women with reactive syphilis serology, 9 of whom had late latent syphilis (n = 4), stillbirths (n = 2) or early neonatal deaths (n = 3), leaving 30 survivors of which 11 with and 7 without congenital syphilis had neurodevelopmental assessment. Those with congenital syphilis were all born to women with inadequate syphilis treatment before delivery. Neurodevelopmental impairment was documented in 3 of 11 (27%) infants with congenital syphilis and one of 7 (14%) without congenital syphilis with speech language delays in 4 of 11 (36%) with congenital syphilis and 3 of 7 (42%) without congenital syphilis. Infants born to mothers with reactive syphilis serology during pregnancy are at high risk for neurodevelopmental impairment, whether or not they have congenital syphilis, so should all be offered neurodevelopmental assessments and early referral for services as required.\n\nCongenital syphilis: an unusual presentation.\n\nPubMed\n\nDzebolo, N N\n\n1980-08-01\n\nCongenital syphilis was discovered in a neonate with the unusual radiographic presentation of unilateral involvement of three bones showing lytic lesions and periostitis. Congenital syphilis should be considered in a newborn infant with these radiographic manifestations, especially when a suggestive history is obtained.\n\nCongenital syphilis - United States, 2003-2008.\n\nPubMed\n\n2010-04-16\n\nUntreated syphilis during pregnancy, especially early syphilis, can lead to stillbirth, neonatal death, or infant disorders such as deafness, neurologic impairment, and bone deformities. Congenital syphilis (CS) can be prevented by early detection of maternal infection and treatment at least 30 days before delivery. Changes in the population incidence of primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis among women usually are followed by similar changes in the incidence of CS. To assess recent trends in CS rates, CDC analyzed national surveillance data from the period 2003--2008. This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which indicated that, after declining for 14 years, the CS rate among infants aged <1 year increased 23%, from 8.2 cases per 100,000 live births in 2005 to 10.1 during 2008. That increase followed a 38% increase in the P&S syphilis rate among females aged >or=10 years from 2004 to 2007. During 2005-2008, CS rates increased primarily in the South (from 9.6 per 100,000 live births to 15.7) and among infants born to black mothers (from 26.6 per 100,000 live births to 34.6). Reversing the upward trend in CS rates will require collaboration among health-care providers, health departments, health insurers, policymakers, and the public to reduce syphilis among women and to increase early prenatal care access and syphilis screening during pregnancy.\n\nSyphilis in pregnancy and congenital syphilis in Palmas, Tocantins State, Brazil, 2007-2014.\n\nPubMed\n\nCavalcante, PatrÃ­cia Alves de MendonÃ§a; Pereira, Ruth Bernardes de Lima; Castro, JosÃ© Gerley Diaz\n\n2017-01-01\n\nto describe the epidemiological profile of reported cases of syphilis in pregnant women and congenital syphilis in the period 2007-2014 in Palmas-TO, Brazil. this is a descriptive study with data from the Information System for Notifiable Diseases (Sinan). 171 pregnant women with syphilis (4.7/1,000 live births [LB]) and 204 cases of congenital syphilis (5.6/1,000 LB) were identified; most women were brown-skinned (71.3%), had low education level (48.0%) and received late diagnosis during prenatal care (71.9%); the incidence of congenital syphilis varied from 2.9 to 8.1/1,000 LB in the period; the predominant maternal characteristics were age from 20 to 34 years (73.5%), having up to complete high school (85.3%), attending prenatal care (81.4%), diagnosis of syphilis during prenatal care (48.0%), and untreated partners of mothers who attended prenatal care (83.0%), reaching almost 80% of live births with congenital syphilis. it is necessary to adopt new strategies for the effectiveness of the prenatal care provided, and, consequently, to reduce the incidence of congenital syphilis.\n\nInfectious and congenital syphilis in Canada, 2010-2015.\n\nPubMed\n\nChoudhri, Y; Miller, J; Sandhu, J; Leon, A; Aho, J\n\n2018-02-01\n\nSyphilis is the third most commonly reported notifiable sexually transmitted infection (STI) in Canada, following chlamydia and gonorrhea, respectively. Rates of this STI have been rising rapidly in Canada since 2001. To summarize trends observed in syphilis rates for 2010 to 2015 in Canada. Laboratory-confirmed cases of infectious syphilis and early congenital syphilis were reported to the Public Health Agency of Canada by all of the Canadian provinces and territories. National infectious syphilis rates were computed, as were rates per sex, age group and province/territory. Rates of congenital syphilis were also calculated. From 2010 to 2015, the rate of infectious syphilis in Canada increased by 85.6%, from 5.0 to 9.3 cases per 100,000 population. In 2015, a total of 3,321 cases of infectious syphilis were reported, mainly in males (93.7%), among whom the rate was 17.5 cases per 100,000 males versus 1.2 per 100,000 females. The rate also rose faster among males in 2010-2015, a 90.2% increase versus 27.8% among females. Individuals aged 20-39 years had the highest rates. Across the provinces and territories, the highest rates of infectious syphilis were in Nunavut, British Columbia and Manitoba. â: The rate of congenital syphilis decreased from 2010 to 2014 (1.6 to 0.3 cases per 100,000 live births) before increasing to 1.5 cases per 100,000 live births in 2015, which corresponds to six reported cases. Rates of syphilis continue to rise in Canada, especially among young men, and this is consistent with trends in the United States of America and European Union. Based on data from Canada and from these regions, the sexual behaviour of men who have sex with men (MSM) is thought to be a major risk factor for syphilis.\n\nMaternal and congenital syphilis in Karnataka, India.\n\nPubMed\n\nArchana, B R; Prasad, S R; Beena, P M; Okade, R; Sheela, S R; Beeregowda, Y C\n\n2014-03-01\n\nScreening women for syphilis during pregnancy and providing proper treatment are the cornerstones of congenital syphilis prevention. During 2008-2011, 6,221 pregnant women were screened for syphilis using the Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) and Treponema Pallidum Hemagglutination (TPHA) tests at R.L. Jalappa Hospital, Kolar, Karnataka, India. The seroprevalence of syphilis during pregnancy ranged from 0.57% to 0.78% during the study. Of the 35 women with a positive test, 26 (74.28%) were detected at the time of labor and 9 (25.71%) were detected during antenatal care. None of the women detected at the time of labor received penicillin therapy for syphilis. Adverse fetal outcomes due to untreated syphilis during pregnancy were seen in many of the cases. During the study 26 infants (3.69/1,000) were diagnosed with congenital syphilis. Our findings show detection and treatment of syphilis during pregnancy needs to be strengthened in the study area to reduce the incidence of congenital syphilis.\n\nInfectious and congenital syphilis in Canada, 2010â2015\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChoudhri, Y; Miller, J; Sandhu, J; Leon, A; Aho, J\n\n2018-01-01\n\nBackground Syphilis is the third most commonly reported notifiable sexually transmitted infection (STI) in Canada, following chlamydia and gonorrhea, respectively.

The objectives were to examine the rates of syphilis among men, women, and infants in Ohio from 2003 to 2016 and compare these rates to the rest of the United States (US). This retrospective study evaluated cases of syphilis among men, women, and infants from 2003 to 2016 using data from the Ohio Department of Health (ODH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In Ohio from 2003 to 2016, the number of all syphilis cases among women significantly increased from 153 (2.6/100,000) to 294 (5.2/100,000), respectively (b=0.26; p=0.001, 95% CI, 0.137-0.382). From 2003 to 2016, congenital syphilis in Ohio also increased significantly from 3 (2/100,000) to 13 cases (9.3/100,000), respectively (b=1.05; p<=0.001, 95% CI, 0.687-1.408). The increase in congenital syphilis mirrored the increase in all cases of syphilis in women but not with the rates of primary and secondary syphilis. Among men, cases of primary and secondary syphilis increased significantly in Ohio and the rest of the US, from 156 (2.8/100,000) and 5,956 (4.2/100,000) in 2003 to 622 (10.5/100,000) and 24,724 (15.6/100,000) in 2016, respectively (Ohio: b=0.55; p<0.001; 95% CI, 0.426 to 0.679; US: b=0.77, p<0.001, 95% CI 0.629-0.916). The association of congenital syphilis with all syphilis cases in women highlights the importance of reporting all cases and not just primary and secondary syphilis. The increase in congenital syphilis reinforces the recommendation for repeat maternal screening during pregnancy.\n\nMaternal and congenital syphilis in rural Haiti.\n\nPubMed\n\nLomotey, Chaylah J; Lewis, Judy; Gebrian, Bette; Bourdeau, Royneld; Dieckhaus, Kevin; Salazar, Juan C\n\n2009-09-01\n\nA study was conducted to assess the prevalence of maternal syphilis and estimate the rate of congenital syphilis in five rural villages surrounding Jeremie, Haiti. This research was a retrospective observational study. Data were extracted from the Haitian Health Foundation's public health database and verified through original clinical paper records, death certificates, midwife reports, and discussions with community health workers. Data were analyzed by chi-square analysis, bivariate correlations, and two-tailed t-test for independent samples. Of the 410 women tested for syphilis, 31 (7.6%) were sero-reactive. Average gestation at time of testing was 25 weeks, which correlated with entry into prenatal care at an average of 23 weeks. Women who tested positive during pregnancy were more likely to have had a negative pregnancy outcome than those who did not (chi square = 16.4; P < 0.0001). The estimated rate of congenital syphilis in the region was 767 per 100,000 live births. Maternal syphilis is prevalent in rural Haiti. This prevalence combined with late entry into prenatal care contributes to adverse pregnancy outcomes and a high estimated rate of congenital syphilis. More research is needed on congenital syphilis and prenatal-careseeking practices of rural Haitian women in order to understand the impact of maternal syphilis in the region and improve pregnancy outcomes.\n\nSyphilis in pregnancy and congenital syphilis in Amazonas State, Brazil: an evaluation using database linkage.\n\nPubMed\n\nSoeiro, Claudia Marques de Oliveira; Miranda, AngÃ©lica Espinosa; Saraceni, Valeria; Santos, Marcelo Cordeiro dos; Talhari, Sinesio; Ferreira, Luiz Carlos de Lima\n\n2014-04-01\n\nThis study analyzes notification of syphilis in pregnancy and congenital syphilis in Amazo- nas State, Brazil, from 2007 to 2009 and verifies underreporting in databases in the National Information System on Diseases of Notification (SINAN) and the occurrence of perinatal deaths associated with congenital syphilis and not reported in the Mortality Information System (SIM). This was a cross-sectional study with probabilistic record linkage between the SINAN and SIM. There were 666 reports of syphilis in pregnant women, including 224 in 2007 (3.8/1,000), 244(4.5/1,000) in 2008, and 198(4.0/1,000) in 2009. The study found 486 cases of congenital syphilis, of which 153 in 2007 (2.1/1,000), 193 in 2008 (2.6/1,000), and 140 in 2009 (2.0/1,000). After linkage of the SINAN databases, 237 pregnant women (35.6%) had cases of congenital syphilis reported. The SIM recorded 4,905 perinatal deaths, of which 57.8% were stillbirths. Probabilistic record linkage between SIM and SINAN-Congenital Syphilis yielded 13 matched records. The use of SINAN and SIM may not reflect the total magnitude of syphilis, but provide the basis for monitoring and analyzing this health problem, with a view towards planning and management.\n\nMaternal and congenital syphilis in Shanghai, China, 2002 to 2006.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhu, Liping; Qin, Min; Du, Li; Xie, Ri-hua; Wong, Tom; Wen, Shi Wu\n\n2010-09-01\n\nTo assess the trends and determinants of maternal and congenital syphilis in Shanghai, China. We conducted a prospective cohort study of maternal and congenital syphilis from 2002 to 2006 in Shanghai, China. We presented the trends of maternal syphilis and congenital syphilis rates and compared outcomes in infants born to mothers with complete versus incomplete treatment for maternal syphilis. We also assessed the determinants of compliance to treatment of maternal syphilis and examined the associations of initial maternal RPR antibody level and gestational age at initiation of treatment with occurrence of congenital syphilis. A total of 535Â 537 pregnant women were included in the analysis. During this period of time, 1471 maternal syphilis cases (298.7 per 100Â 000 live births) and 334 congenital syphilis cases (62.4 per 100Â 000 live births) were identified. Both maternal and congenital syphilis rates increased from 2002 until 2005, with a slight decrease in 2006. The rate of maternal syphilis was 156.2 per 100Â 000 live births in Shanghai residents and 371.7 per 100Â 000 live births in the migrating population (p<0.001). The compliance to treatment for maternal syphilis was poorer in women with a lower level of education. The rate of congenital syphilis in infants born to mothers with incomplete treatment (50.8%) was much higher than in infants born to mothers with complete treatment (12.5%). Rates of fetal death, neonatal death, and major birth defects were 30.4%, 11.0%, and 3.8%, respectively, in the incomplete treatment group; the corresponding figures were 5.5%, 0.56%, and 0.46%, respectively, in the complete treatment group. Infant outcome was also affected by initial maternal RPR antibody level and time of treatment, with much better outcomes in mothers with low antibody levels and earlier treatment. There has been a resurgence of congenital syphilis in Shanghai, China, especially in the migrating population and other populations with a lower\n\n[Coverage by the Family Health Strategy and diagnosis of syphilis in pregnancy and congenital syphilis].\n\nPubMed\n\nSaraceni, ValÃ©ria; Miranda, AngÃ©lica Espinosa\n\n2012-03-01\n\nThis paper aimed to correlate syphilis in pregnancy and congenital syphilis with coverage of the Family Health Strategy (FHS), based on available data in the national health information systems. The syphilis notification estimates were calculated according to the Sentinel Childbirth Study for 2004 under the Ministry of Health and the data were obtained from the websites of the Health Surveillance Secretariat and Healthcare Secretariat, for the year 2008. The ratios between observed and estimated gestational syphilis and congenital syphilis were not statistically correlated with population coverage by the FHS (r = -0.28 and r = -0.40, respectively). The FHS is a privileged area for prenatal care and logically a source of compulsory notification of syphilis in pregnancy. By combining diagnosis with adequate treatment of syphilis in pregnant women and their partners, the FHS becomes a prime instrument for eliminating congenital syphilis in Brazil. Expanding the FHS coverage and quality of care are essential for achieving this goal.\n\nIncidence of congenital syphilis in the South Region of Brazil.\n\nPubMed\n\nSerafim, Anie Savi; Moretti, Gustavo Pasquali; Serafim, Guilherme Savi; Niero, Cintia Vieira; da Rosa, Maria InÃªs; Pires, Maria Marlene de Souza; SimÃµes, Priscyla Waleska Targino de Azevedo\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to establish the incidence rates of congenital syphilis in the South Region of Brazil from 2001 to 2009. Temporal ecological and descriptive study based on the cases recorded by the System of Information of Notifiable Diseases. The incidence of congenital syphilis has been increasing in the South Region of Brazil since 2004; the highest incidence rates were in women who received prenatal care (113.5 new cases per 100,000 births, p<0.001), who were diagnosed with syphilis at pregnancy (69.8 new cases per 100,000 births, p=0.001), and whose partner did not undergo treatment for syphilis (53.1 new cases per 100,000 births, p=0.001). The population of the present study mostly consisted of adult black women with low educational levels who attended prenatal care, who were diagnosed with syphilis during pregnancy, and whose partners were not treated for syphilis. Based on these results, actions are recommended to reduce the incidence of this disease, which is preventable by early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. The present was merely an ecological study; therefore, further investigations are necessary to elucidate the causes of these findings.\n\nCongenital syphilis in Italy: a multicentre study.\n\nPubMed\n\nTridapalli, Elisabetta; Capretti, Maria Grazia; Reggiani, Maria Letizia Bacchi; Stronati, Mauro; Faldella, Giacomo\n\n2012-05-01\n\nTo study the prevalence of congenital syphilis and its risk factors in Italy. Prospective study from 1 July 2006 to 30 June 2007. Data on mother-child pairs were collected for every syphilis seropositive mother. Maternal syphilis seroprevalence at delivery was 0.17%. 207 infants were born to 203 syphilis seropositive mothers. In 25 newborns it was possible to diagnose congenital syphilis (20/100,000 live births). Maternal risk factors included age <20 years, no antenatal care and no adequate treatment. The infected babies were more often preterm or weighed <2000 g at birth. Many syphilis seropositive mothers were foreign born but the risk of an infected newborn was not higher in foreign-born than in Italian seropositive women. The significant factors were lack of antenatal screening and inadequate maternal treatment. Syphilis is a re-emerging infection in Italy. Prevention strategies should include antenatal serological tests for all pregnant women and treatment for infected mothers.\n\nCongenital syphilis: refining newborn evaluation and management in Shenzhen, southern China.\n\nPubMed\n\nWu, Da-Dong; Hong, Fu-Chang; Feng, Tie-Jian; Liu, Xiao-Li; Lin, Li-Jun; Tian, Li-Shan; Qiu, Li-Xia\n\n2010-08-01\n\nConsistent definitions of congenital syphilis are critical for determining true incidences and setting up targets of elimination. This study aimed to assess the evaluation and management of infants at high risk of congenital syphilis with an antenatal syphilis-screening programme in the Shenzhen SEZ and to develop feasible definitions for the detection of congenital syphilis in China. A retrospective study was conducted of all standardised records of pregnant women with positive syphilis between 2003 and 2007. Infants at high risk of congenital syphilis were evaluated by laboratory tests at birth and longitudinal follow-up. A screening test-positive congenital syphilis case was defined based on a positive 19S-IgM-FTA-ABS result at birth. Assuming that 19S-IgM-FTA-ABS was the gold standard, the sensitivity and specificity of the ascertainment methods were calculated. During the study period, 1010 live infants were born to women with active syphilis during pregnancy. 19S-IgM-FTA-ABS detected 42 screening-positive congenital syphilis cases and another nine cases were identified by longitudinal follow-up only. Using 19S-IgM-FTA-ABS as the gold standard, 'fourfold rapid plasma reagin (RPR) titres' had the highest sensitivity and specificity compared with the other two follow-up methods. 19S-IgM-FTA-ABS makes congenital syphilis case classification simpler and faster for newborns. In areas where 19S-IgM-FTA-ABS is not available, comparing newborn RPR titres with maternal titres can be an alternative method. Meanwhile, positive follow-up results act as treatment indicators for older infants. As congenital syphilis definitions vary over the country, the Shenzhen programme suggested a practical model for surveillance and treatment in areas with or without available 19S-IgM-FTA-ABS testing.\n\nCongenital syphilis: a sentinel event in antenatal care quality.\n\nPubMed\n\nDomingues, Rosa Maria Soares Madeira; Saracen, Valeria; Hartz, Zulmira Maria de AraÃºjo; Leal, Maria do Carmo\n\n2013-02-01\n\nTo evaluate antenatal care in reducing the vertical transmission of syphilis. A cross-sectional study was designed to be representative of low-risk pregnancies in women cared for at the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) network in the city of Rio de Janeiro, from November 2007 to July 2008. Pregnant women diagnosed with syphilis were identified through interviews, checking their antenatal care card and searching for reported cases in the public health information systems. Cases of congenital syphilis were sought at the disease reporting system (Sinan), the Mortality Information System (SIM) and the SUS's Hospital Information System (SIH). Syphilis was identified in 46 of the pregnancies, and 16 cases of congenital syphilis were identified, resulting in a prevalence of 1.9% (95%CI 1.3;2.6) of syphilis in pregnancy and an incidence of 6/1,000 (95%CI 3;12/1,000) of congenital syphilis. The vertical transmission rate was 34.8% with three cases resulting in death (1 abortion, 1 stillborn and 1 neonatal death) and high proportions of prematurity and low birth weight. The healthcare pathway of those women revealed flaws in the care they received, such as late entry to antenatal care, syphilis remaining undiagnosed during pregnancy and lack of treatment for the partner. Innovative strategies are needed to improve the outcomes of syphilis in pregnancy, including improving the laboratory network, the quality of care delivered to the pregnant women and their sexual partners and, most important of all, investigating every case of congenital syphilis as a sentinel event in the quality of antenatal care.\n\nClinical and socioeconomic determinants of congenital syphilis in Posadas, Argentina.\n\nPubMed\n\nParker, Lucy Anne; Deschutter, Enrique Jorge; Bornay-Llinares, Fernando Jorge; Hernandez-Aguado, Ildefonso; Silva, Gustavo; Piragine, Rosa Del Carmen; Lumbreras, Blanca\n\n2012-04-01\n\nTo explore clinical and socioeconomic factors related to congenital syphilis in Posadas, Argentina. Data were collected from 102 mothers who had given birth to an infant with congenital syphilis at Dr. RamÃ³n Madariaga Central Hospital (2005-2007) and 306 control mothers. Clinical and demographic information were collected from clinical records, and socioeconomic details were obtained by interview. Multivariable logistic regression was used to explore the relationships between congenital syphilis and clinical and socioeconomic factors. Receiving the recommended number of prenatal health checks had a clear protective effect on congenital syphilis in the univariate analysis (odds ratio (OR) 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31-0.86), as did being in a stable relationship (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.14-0.38). Furthermore, women with secondary education or above were over four-times less likely to have a child with congenital syphilis compared to women who had not completed primary school education, even after controlling for the number of prenatal health checks and other factors (adjusted OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.08-0.72). In addition, women with previous stillborn births were over three-times more likely to have a baby with congenital syphilis after controlling for education and prenatal care (adjusted OR 3.37, 95% CI 1.24-9.16). There is a clear opportunity for reducing the burden of congenital syphilis by promoting syphilis screening and treatment in women with previous stillborn births. In addition, the potential impact of more general policies addressing social determinants of health, such as those improving education, must not be overlooked.

Pregnant women with positive syphilis serology defined as reactive treponemal test and rapid plasma reagin titre â¥1:8 were identified from the Northern Territory Syphilis Register Information System. Risk classification was performed based on local guidelines, and CDNA criteria for probable/confirmed cases of congenital syphilis were applied to determine whether cases were appropriately notified. Thirty-four cases of positive maternal syphilis serology in pregnancy were identified from 31 women; all were Indigenous. Twenty-one cases fulfilled criteria for probable congenital syphilis; 1 case was formally notified to the Centre for Disease Control. Twenty cases (95%) fulfilling CDNA criteria for probable congenital syphilis were not notified over the study period. Application of standard case definitions significantly increases the rate of congenital syphilis cases in the Northern Territory. Improved education regarding CDNA criteria for notification of congenital syphilis is necessary for clinicians and public health staff. Emerging evidence has supported the recent simplification of CDNA criteria for notification of congenital syphilis, effective 1 July 2015.\n\nDental Stigmata of Congenital Syphilis: A Historic Review With Present Day Relevance.\n\nPubMed\n\nNissanka-Jayasuriya, Eranga H; Odell, Edward W; Phillips, Carina\n\n2016-09-01\n\nSyphilis was the first sexually transmitted disease to be diagnosed in childhood. Most developed countries controlled syphilis effectively after the 1950s and congenital syphilis became rare. Since the late 1990s there has been a resurgence of syphilis in developed and developing countries and the WHO estimates that at least half a million infants die of congenital syphilis every year. The earliest reference to the dental manifestations of congenital syphilis was by Sir Jonathan Hutchinson, Assistant Surgeon at The London Hospital in 1861. Three main dental defects are described in congenital syphilis; Hutchinson's incisors, Moon's molars or bud molars, and Fournier's molars or mulberry molars. Although many physicians, dentists, and pathologists in developed countries will be aware of the dental features of syphilis, most will never have seen a case or made the diagnosis. The purpose of this article is to review some of the history of congenital syphilis, remind healthcare professionals of the features, and bring to their attention that the changes are still prevalent and that milder cases can be mistaken for other causes of hypoplasia.\n\nCongenital and maternal syphilis in the capital of Brazil.\n\nPubMed\n\nMuricy, Carmen Lucia; Pinto JÃºnior, Vitor Laerte\n\n2015-01-01\n\nâThis study aimed to describe the epidemiology of congenital and maternal syphilis in the Brazilian Federal District in 2010. â âA retrospective descriptive study was conducted on the basis of the cases recorded in the System of Notifiable Disease Information. âThe study population comprised 133 cases of congenital syphilis; of these, 116 (52.6%) mothers received prenatal care, and 70 (60.4%) were diagnosed with syphilis during pregnancy.

Antenatal screening in the first trimester continues to be important and should be repeated at 28 to 32 weeks and again at delivery in women at high risk of acquiring syphilis. The diagnosis of congenital syphilis is complex and is based on a combination of maternal history and clinical and laboratory criteria in both mother and infant. Serologic tests for syphilis remain important in the diagnosis of congenital syphilis and are complicated by the passive transfer of maternal antibodies which can affect the interpretation of reactive serologic tests in the infant. All infants born to mothers with reactive syphilis tests should have nontreponemal tests (NTT) and treponemal tests (TT) performed in parallel with the mother's tests. A fourfold or higher titre in the NTT in the infant at delivery is strongly suggestive of congenital infection but the absence of a fourfold or greater NTT titre does not exclude congenital infection. IgM tests for syphilis are not currently available in Canada and are not recommended due to poor performance.

It is a retrospective study that was conducted in July 2010 using a Center for Information and Analysis in Health database that contains information on National Notifiable Diseases. There were 2,930 reported cases of congenital syphilis, demonstrating an annual ascending historical series. The majority of the pregnant women were 20 to 34 years of age (n=1,836, 62.7%), illiterate or with little education (n=1623, 55.4%) and had received prenatal care (n=2077, 70.9%). The inadequate treatment of women and the lack of treatment for their partners is a reality in CearÃ¡. The incidence of congenital syphilis is a quality indicator of prenatal care. Therefore, its increase in the last ten years highlights the necessity of syphilis control.\n\nPresence of dental signs of congenital syphilis in pre-modern specimens.\n\nPubMed\n\nIoannou, Stella; Henneberg, Renata J; Henneberg, Maciej\n\n2018-01-01\n\nTooth morphology can vary due to genetic factors, infectious diseases and other environmental stresses. Congenital syphilis is known to interrupt tooth formation i.e. odontogenesis and amelogenesis, producing specific dental characteristics. Variation of those characteristics can occur, resulting in dental signs \"not typical\" of the disease, however, they are described in the 19th century literature. Past treatments of congenital syphilis with mercury also interrupted dental processes resulting in significantly different dental signs. The aim of this study is to examine the dentition of the oldest (pre 15th century) cases attributed to congenital syphilis to determine whether their dental processes have been affected by either congenital syphilis itself, its treatments (mercury) or a combination of both (syphilitic-mercurial). Comparisons of dental signs of congenital syphilis and its mercuric treatments as described by Hutchinson, Moon and Fournier in the 1800s and in standardised methods as established by modern studies, are made with the dentition of specimens found in archaeological sites in Mexico, Italy, Turkey and Austria dating back to the Terminal Formative Period, Classical Antiquity, Byzantine times and Middle Ages. The dentitions of a child from Oaxaca, Mexico, St. PÃ¶lten, Austria, and two juveniles from Classical Antiquity site Metaponto, Italy, show signs attributed to syphilis only. One adolescent from Byzantine site Nicaea, Turkey, shows dental signs characterised as syphilitic-mercurial. Dental abnormalities observed in Mediterranean individuals match a range of signs attributable to congenital syphilis and its treatments, more so than the New World case. Therefore, it is likely that these individuals suffered from congenital syphilis. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In this context, we need to become more familiar with the signs and symptoms of this disease and consider its diagnosis in patients with only mild clinical manifestations. A definitive diagnosis may be difficult or even impossible in patients whose diagnostic tests reveal low positive titers or inconsistent results. The cornerstone of congenital syphilis control is prenatal screening and the treatment of infected mothers with penicillin, an effective and economical intervention.

Using 2004-2008 syphilis case report data from the state and county health departments, we examined characteristics of pregnant and nonpregnant women with syphilis and their male partners. During 2004-2008, 970 women were reported to have syphilis: 49% were Hispanic (of whom 49% were non-US citizens), 27% were white, 13% were black, and 8% were American Indian/Alaskan Native. Although 16% of Hispanic noncitizens reported drug use or high-risk sexual behaviors, 64% of these women had a male sex partner who reported drug use or anonymous sex. Hispanic women with syphilis were more likely to be pregnant (37%) than white (15%) or black women (13%) (P < 0.05), and were overrepresented among pregnant women with syphilis. Pregnant Hispanic noncitizens were treated later than pregnant Hispanic citizens (median 28 weeks gestation vs. 21 weeks, P = 0.01). Innovative congenital syphilis prevention strategies that are relevant to Hispanic women are warranted. Strategies should address the reproductive health and prenatal care needs of Hispanic women, and may include interventions for their male partners.\n\n[Incidence and risk factors for congenital syphilis in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, 2001-2008].\n\nPubMed\n\nLima, Marina GuimarÃ£es; Santos, Rejane Ferreira Reis dos; Barbosa, Guilherme JosÃ© Antonini; Ribeiro, Guilherme de Sousa\n\n2013-02-01\n\nCongenital syphilis continues to be a public health problem in Brazil. The scope of this study is to describe the trends in the incidence of congenital syphilis in Belo Horizonte between 2001 and 2008 and determine risk factors associated with disease diagnosis.

Multivariate logistic regression analysis used the population of live births as the reference group to identify independent risk factors for congenital syphilis. The annual incidence of congenital syphilis revealed a rising trend from 0.9 to 1.6 cases per 1,000 live births between 2001 and 2008. Independent risk factors for congenital syphilis included: maternal schooling <8 years (OR: 1,3; 95% CI: 1,2-1,4); black or mixed maternal race (2,1; 1,5-2,8) and lack of antenatal care (11,4; 8,5-15,4). The strong association between the lack of antenatal care and congenital syphilis indicates that universalization of antenatal care is critical for the control of congenital syphilis. The effective control of the disease in Brazil will depend on actions to reduce social inequities in health.\n\nRecurrent Fever, Anemia, Arthralgia, and Genu Varum as Late Manifestations of Congenital Syphilis.\n\nPubMed\n\nQuaresma, Liliana; GonÃ§alves, Juan; Estanqueiro, Paula; Salgado, Manuel\n\n2015-12-01\n\nWe report an unusual case of recurrent fever, inflammatory knee pain, genu varum, persistent anemia, and high erythrocyte sedimentation rate in a 28-month-old boy as late manifestations of congenital syphilis (CS). Despite standard penicillin treatment at the end of the first month of life, it recurred later in life, more than once. In the first relapse, manifested by a likely gumma lesion, the prior penicillin treatment plus a negative venereal disease research laboratory result unduly led to exclusion of CS. A second treatment with penicillin led to complete clinical resolution. Although rare, bow legs, recurrent fever, anemia, and inflammatory arthralgias may be manifestations of late CS. Congenital syphilis should be considered throughout early childhood, especially if history of syphilis infection is present. A negative venereal disease research laboratory result does not exclude late syphilis, present in nearly 30% of these patients. The possibility of atypical symptoms of this \"great masquerader\" should always be borne in mind.\n\nOccurrence of congenital syphilis after maternal treatment with azithromycin during pregnancy.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhou, Pingyu; Qian, Yihong; Xu, Jinhua; Gu, Zhiying; Liao, Kanghuang\n\n2007-07-01\n\nTo evaluate the efficacy of azithromycin in preventing congenital syphilis. Five pregnant women with syphilis who were allergic to penicillin were given azithromycin, 1 g daily orally or intravenously, in different hospitals. The duration of the therapy ranged from 1 day to 10 days. A second course of therapy was provided at 28 weeks gestation. The babies were given a physical examination and blood test for serum rapid plasma reagin test (RPR), treponema pallidum hemagglutination test (TPHA), and fluorescent treponemal antibody adsorption test (FTA-ABS-19-sIgM) within three months after birth. Five infants born to these mothers developed skin rashes. Four of the infants had hepatomegaly and one showed osteochondritis. The tests RPR, TPHA, and FTA-ABS-19-sIgM were positive. The RPR titers varied from 1:64 to 1:256 and the babies were diagnosed with congenital syphilis. They were successfully treated with penicillin. Successful therapy for syphilis during pregnancy demands maternal care as well as prevention or cure of congenital infection. The failure of azithromycin in preventing congenital syphilis in our report suggests that azithromycin should not be recommended as an alternative in treating syphilitic pregnant women or fetal syphilis.\n\nThe incidence of congenital syphilis in the United Kingdom: February 2010 to January 2015.\n\nPubMed\n\nSimms, I; Tookey, P A; Goh, B T; Lyall, H; Evans, B; Townsend, C L; Fifer, H; Ison, C\n\n2017-01-01\n\nTo estimate the incidence of congenital syphilis in the UK. Prospective study. United Kingdom. Children born between February 2010 and January 2015 with a suspected diagnosis of congenital syphilis were reported through an active surveillance system. Number of congenital syphilis cases and incidence. For all years, reported incidence was below the WHO threshold for elimination (<0.5/1000 live births). Seventeen cases (12 male, five female) were identified. About 50% of infants (8/17) were born preterm (<37Â weeks' gestation): median birthweight 2000Â g (865-3170Â g). Clinical presentation varied from asymptomatic to acute disease, including severe anaemia, hepatosplenomegaly, rhinitis, thrombocytopaenia, skeletal damage, and neurosyphilis. One infant was deaf and blind. Median maternal age was 20Â years (17-31) at delivery. Where maternal stage of infection was recorded, 6/10 had primary, 3/10 secondary and 1/10 early latent syphilis. Most mothers were white (13/16). Country of birth was recorded for 12 mothers: UK (nÂ =Â 6), Eastern Europe (nÂ =Â 3), Middle East (nÂ =Â 1), and South East Asia (nÂ =Â 2). The social circumstances of mothers varied and included drug use and sex work. Some experienced difficulty accessing health care. The incidence of congenital syphilis is controlled and monitored by healthcare services and related surveillance systems, and is now below the WHO elimination threshold. However, reducing the public health impact of this preventable disease in the UK is highly dependent on the successful implementation of WHO elimination standards across Europe. Congenital syphilis incidence in the UK is at a very low level and well below the WHO elimination threshold.

National standards, from the British Association of Sexual Health and HIV guidelines on managing syphilis in pregnancy, were met in the majority of cases with 69% being treated according to national guidance and all cases completing treatment. Locally developed standards on multidisciplinary working and communication were met less well, with particular issues regarding the documentation of pregnancy outcomes in GUM records and communication between specialities being highlighted. A regional good practice guide has been developed and implemented to address standards not met, reduce adverse outcomes and prevent future cases of congenital syphilis.\n\nCongenital syphilis, a reemergent disease in Mexico: its epidemiology during the last 2 decades.\n\nPubMed\n\nReyna-Figueroa, JesÃºs; Esparza-Aguilar, Marcelino; HernÃ¡ndez-HernÃ¡ndez, Luz del Carmen; FernÃ¡ndez-Canton, Sonia; Richardson-Lopez Collada, Vesta Louise\n\n2011-09-01\n\nTo describe the epidemiologic profile of congenital syphilis in Mexico between 1990 and 2009. The database of the General Direction of Epidemiology at the Ministry of Health in Mexico about congenital syphilis was reviewed. Data corresponding to the period between 1990 and 2009 were analyzed in every state of the Mexican republic. A total of 1717 cases of congenital syphilis were reported during the study period. A 16.6% increase was observed between 2005 and 2009 and the quinquennium between 2000 and 2004. A trend toward increase in the incidence of congenital syphilis was observed with 2.9 new cases for each 100,000 babies born alive. The states that displayed significant positive trends were as follows: Baja California, Colima, Chihuahua, Jalisco, Nayarit, Sinaloa, and Zacatecas. An increase in the number of cases of congenital syphilis is observed; the northern states are the ones that contribute the most to the statistics. There is a real need to refine the epidemiologic operations to detect and treat the cases of maternal and congenital syphilis in the country.\n\nMaternal and congenital syphilis, underreported and difficult to control.\n\nPubMed\n\nLafetÃ¡, KÃ¡tia Regina Gandra; Martelli JÃºnior, HercÃ­lio; Silveira, Marise Fagundes; ParanaÃ­ba, LÃ­via MÃ¡ris Ribeiro\n\n2016-03-01\n\nTo identify and to describe cases of congenital and maternal syphilis reported and not reported in a Brazilian medium-sized city. This is a descriptive and retrospective study, which evaluated 214 medical records of pregnant women and newborns. It began with the identification of epidemiological notification records, followed by active search in maternity evaluating all records that did show positive nontreponemal serology and records of the reference service in infectious diseases in Montes Claros, Minas Gerais, from 2007 to 2013. The case definitions followed the Ministry of Health recommendations in Brazil and the variables were described using absolute and relative frequencies. This study was approved by the Ethics in Research Committee (University State of Montes Claros). Of the 214 medical records, we identified 93 cases of maternal syphilis and 54 cases of congenital. The women studied were predominantly mulatto, with Secundary/Higher, aged between 21 and 30 years and single marital status. Considering the prenatal care of pregnant women with syphilis, it was observed predominance of late diagnosis, after parturition or curettage, and all of their treatments were considered inadequate according the Ministry of Health. The newborns of pregnant women with syphilis, most were not referenced for pediatric follow-up. Only 6.5% of syphilis in pregnant women was notified, and in congenital syphilis, 24.1%. Persisting vertical transmission, there are signs that the quality of prenatal and neonatal care should be restructured.\n\nMissed opportunities for preventing congenital syphilis infection in New York City.\n\nPubMed\n\nPatel, Sameer J; Klinger, Ellen J; OÊ¼Toole, Dana; Schillinger, Julia A\n\n2012-10-01\n\nTo describe health care providers' missed opportunities for preventing and treating congenital syphilis in New York City. Review of congenital syphilis cases reported to the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2009. Receipt and timing of prenatal care, serologic testing, and treatment of mothers and newborns were reviewed. Missed opportunities were defined as receipt of prenatal care plus one of the following: 1) lack of documented treatment for syphilis infection diagnosed before pregnancy; 2) absence of serologic testing during pregnancy; 3) late maternal treatment; 4) maternal treatment with a nonpenicillin regimen; or 5) lack of maternal treatment. In total, 195 newborns with congenital syphilis were born to 190 mothers with 191 pregnancies. Overall, 80% (95% confidence interval [CI] 74-86%, 152 of 190) of all mothers received prenatal care; 63% (95% CI 56-71%, 96 of 152) of these had one or more missed opportunities for prevention. Twelve mothers received inadequate treatment or no treatment during the case pregnancy for documented syphilis infection before pregnancy, and 42 mothers without previous syphilis diagnosis did not have serologic testing during the case pregnancy. Of 103 mothers with syphilis diagnosed before 30 weeks of gestation, 12 received late penicillin therapy, 27 received no therapy, and 3 received inappropriate (nonpenicillin) therapy. Seventeen percent (95% CI 12-22%, 33 of 193) of liveborn newborns received no treatment during their hospitalization. Providers missed well-defined opportunities to prevent congenital syphilis for the majority of cases. Combined efforts to prevent future cases include provider education and better integration of care between obstetricians and pediatricians. III.\n\nSyphilis in adults\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGoh, B\n\n2005-01-01\n\nSyphilis is a sexually transmitted disease with protean manifestations resulting from infection by Treponema pallidum. It is systemic early from the outset, the primary pathology being vasculitis. Acquired syphilis can be divided into primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary stages. The infection can also be transmitted vertically resulting in congenital syphilis, and occasionally by blood transfusion and non-sexual contact. Diagnosis is mainly by dark field microscopy in early syphilis and by serological tests. The management in the tropics depends on the diagnostic facilities available: in resource poor countries, primary syphilis is managed syndromically as for anogenital ulcer. The introduction of rapid \"desktop\" serological tests may simplify and promote widespread screening for syphilis. The mainstay of treatment is with long acting penicillin. Syphilis promotes the transmission of HIV and both infections can simulate and interact with each other. Treponemes may persist despite effective treatment and may have a role in reactivation in immunosuppressed patients. Partner notification, health education, and screening in high risk populations and pregnant women to prevent congenital syphilis are essential aspects in controlling the infection.

A national hospital-based study was performed in 2011-2012 with 23,894 postpartum women using an in-hospital interview and data from patient charts and prenatal cards. Univariate logistic regression was performed to verify factors associated with congenital syphilis. Estimated incidence of congenital syphilis was 3.51 per 1,000 live births (95%CI: 2.29-5.37) and vertical transmission rate was 34.3% (95%CI: 24.7-45.4). Congenital syphilis was associated with lower maternal schooling, black skin color, higher rate of risk factors for prematurity, late initiation of prenatal care, fewer prenatal visits, and lower rate of prenatal serological testing. Fetal mortality was six times higher in congenital syphilis, and newborns with congenital syphilis showed higher hospital admission rates. Congenital syphilis is a persistent public health problem in Brazil and is associated with greater social vulnerability and gaps in prenatal care.\n\nSyphilis\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n... cdc.gov/std/syphilis/ stdfact-msm-syphilis.htm Congenital Syphilis - Fact Sheet https://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/ stdfact-congenital-syphilis.htm STDs during Pregnancy - Fact Sheet https://www. ...\n\nGlobal burden of maternal and congenital syphilis in 2008 and 2012: a health systems modelling study.\n\nPubMed\n\nWijesooriya, N Saman; Rochat, Roger W; Kamb, Mary L; Turlapati, Prasad; Temmerman, Marleen; Broutet, Nathalie; Newman, Lori M\n\n2016-08-01\n\nIn 2007, WHO launched a global initiative for the elimination of mother-to-child transmission of syphilis (congenital syphilis). An important aspect of the initiative is strengthening surveillance to monitor progress towards elimination. In 2008, using a health systems model with country data inputs, WHO estimated that 1Â·4 million maternal syphilis infections caused 520â000 adverse pregnancy outcomes. To assess progress, we updated the 2008 estimates and estimated the 2012 global prevalence and cases of maternal and congenital syphilis. We used a health systems model approved by the Child Health Epidemiology Reference Group. WHO and UN databases provided inputs on livebirths, antenatal care coverage, and syphilis testing, seropositivity, and treatment in antenatal care. For 2012 estimates, we used data collected between 2009 and 2012. We updated the 2008 estimates using data collected between 2000 and 2008, compared these with 2012 estimates using data collected between 2009 and 2012, and performed subanalyses to validate results. In 2012, an estimated 930â000 maternal syphilis infections caused 350â000 adverse pregnancy outcomes including 143â000 early fetal deaths and stillbirths, 62â000 neonatal deaths, 44â000 preterm or low weight births, and 102â000 infected infants worldwide. Nearly 80% of adverse outcomes (274â000) occurred in women who received antenatal care at least once. Comparing the updated 2008 estimates with the 2012 estimates, maternal syphilis decreased by 38% (from 1â488â394 cases in 2008 to 927â936 cases in 2012) and congenital syphilis decreased by 39% (from 576â784 to 350â915). India represented 65% of the decrease. Analysis excluding India still showed an 18% decrease in maternal and congenital cases of syphilis worldwide. Maternal and congenital syphilis decreased worldwide from 2008 to 2012, which suggests progress towards the elimination of mother-to-child transmission of syphilis.

This study assessed measures aimed at the prevention and control of syphilis in the State of Mato Grosso and its capital, CuiabÃ¡. A descriptive study cross-sectional and of time trends assessing the congenital syphilis was performed in CuiabÃ¡ and Mato Grosso between 2001 and 2011. We compared maternal sociodemographic characteristics and health care utilization related to cases of congenital syphilis during the periods from 2001 to 2006 and from 2007 to 2011. We assessed the temporal trends in this disease's incidence using a simple linear regression. Between 2001 and 2006 in Mato Grosso, 86.8% of the mothers who had live births with congenital syphilis received prenatal care, 90.6% presented with a nontreponemal test reagent at delivery, 96.2% had no information regarding a treponemal confirmatory test at delivery, and 77.6% received inadequate treatment for syphilis; additionally, 75.8% of their partners were not treated. There was a statistically significant reduction in prenatal visits (p = 0.004) and an increase in the proportion of mothers reactive to nontreponemal tests at delivery (p = 0.031) between the two periods. No other variables were found to differ significantly between the periods. In CuiabÃ¡, we observed a similar distribution of variables. In the state and in the capital, the increasing trend of congenital syphilis was not statistically significant. The high incidence of congenital syphilis in Mato Grosso and the low levels of health care indicators for pregnant women with syphilis suggest the need to improve the coverage and quality of prenatal care.\n\nA probable case of congenital syphilis from pre-Columbian Austria.\n\nPubMed\n\nGaul, Johanna Sophia; Grossschmidt, Karl; Gusenbauer, Christian; Kanz, Fabian\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThis study examines the skeletal remains of a subadult from an archeological site in Austria. Radiocarbon dating and archeological attribution indicate that this individual is of pre-Columbian origin. Most of the skeleton was recovered, and only the teeth and the orbital roofs show changes. Dental defects such as the mulberry molar and a tapered, fang-like canine suggest a diagnosis of congenital syphilis. This is the first probable case of congenital syphilis from pre-Columbian Central Europe. Our findings contribute to the pre-Columbian theory, offering counter evidence to the assumption that syphilis was carried from Columbus' crew from the New to the Old World.\n\n[Maternal and congenital syphilis: a persistent challenge].\n\nPubMed\n\nMagalhÃ£es, Daniela Mendes dos Santos; Kawaguchi, InÃªs Aparecida Laudares; Dias, Adriano; Calderon, Iracema de Mattos Paranhos\n\n2013-06-01\n\nThis descriptive study collected socio-demographic, obstetric, and diagnostic and treatment-related data from pregnant and postpartum women and their partners, for the 67 pregnant or postpartum women reported with syphilis to the National System of Diseases of Notification, users of public maternity hospitals in the Federal District of Brazil from 2009 to 2010. Data on clinical and laboratory follow-up of the newborn were obtained from the hospital patient charts, compulsory notification forms, and Infant Health Cards. Of the pregnant women, 41.8% were adequately treated; the main reason for inadequate treatment was the absence (83.6%) or inadequate treatment of the partner (88.1%). More than a third required repeat treatment at the maternity hospital due to lack of documentation of treatment during the prenatal period. Of the newborns diagnosed with congenital syphilis, 48% received radiographic investigation, 42% received a spinal tap, and 36% failed to receive any kind of intervention. Thus, the quality of prenatal care was insufficient to guarantee the control of congenital syphilis and achieve the goal of reducing incidence of the disease.\n\nCongenital syphilis: still a serious, under-diagnosed threat for children in resource-poor countries.\n\nPubMed\n\nKrÃ¼ger, Carsten; Malleyeck, Isaack\n\n2010-05-01\n\nWith 700,000 to 1.5 million new cases annually, congenital syphilis remains a major infectious cause of morbidity and mortality in neonates, infants and children in resource-poor countries. We therefore analyzed the extent of congenital syphilis in the pediatric patient population at our rural hospital in Tanzania. For this retrospective analysis, from January 1, 1998 to August 31, 2000, all cases of congenital syphilis were collected from the medical records of the neonatal and pediatric department at Haydom Lutheran Hospital in rural northern Tanzania. Age, sex, weight, clinical signs and symptoms, venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) results of mother and/or child, hemoglobin concentration, treatment, and outcome were recorded and analyzed. Fourteen neonates and infants were included. The earlier the diagnosis, the more it rested on maternal data because the presentation of neonatal congenital syphilis resembled neonatal sepsis. Syphilitic skin lesions were only seen in the post-neonatal age group. VDRL results were positive in 11 of the 14 mothers, and in 4 of the infants. Anemia was common in older infants. No patient showed signs of central nervous system involvement. Two patients died, and the remaining were cured after standard treatment with procaine penicillin. Highlighting the variable picture of congenital syphilis, this report demonstrates how difficult it is to make a correct diagnosis by solely history and clinical presentation in a resource-poor setting. Hence false-positive and false-negative diagnoses are common, and clinicians have to maintain a high index of suspicion in diagnosing congenital syphilis. Therefore, an important approach to control and finally eliminate congenital syphilis as a major public health problem will be universal on-site syphilis screening of all pregnant women at their first antenatal visit and immediate treatment for those who test positive.\n\n[Congenital syphilis: presenting as septic shock alter the neonatal period].\n\nPubMed\n\nArriagada, Daniela; Donoso, Alejandro; Cruces, Pablo; DÃ­az, Franco\n\n2012-10-01\n\nClinical spectrum of congenital syphilis ranges from asymptomatic infection to fulminant sepsis. Treponema pallidum is acquired crossing the placenta from the mother to the fetus during maternal spirochetemia or through direct contact of the child with an infected lesion at delivery. We report a 27 days-old previously healthy girl diagnosed with congenital syphilis. Her mother had an unremarkable previous history, adequate obstetric care and negative prenatal screening test for syphilis. The patient was brought to the ER due to development of skin lesions and fever in the last 24 h. She was admitted to pediatric ICU lethargic and poorly responsive, with hepa-tosplenomegaly and perioral, palmoplantar erythematous desquamative scaly lesions. Laboratory data revealed anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia and C-reactive protein of 183 mg/l. Soon after admission she developed septic shock with leukocytosis up to 45,800/mm3 and exacerbation of thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia and metabolic acidosis. Congenital syphilis was diagnosed at the second day of admission with VDRL titers of 1:128 in serum and 1:8 in cerebrospinal fluid. Maternal serum VDRL was positive with titers of 1:32. The patient was treated with penicillin for three weeks with adequate clinical and laboratory response. Congenital syphilis is a life threatening infection, but cannot always be diagnosed at birth. Health care workers must be aware of the difficulties in obtaining a definitive diagnosis and must have a high index of suspicion, considering the possible errors of prenatal serology and the diverse possible clinical presentations, including neonatal sepsis during the first month of life.\n\nClinical features and follow-up of congenital syphilis.\n\nPubMed\n\nLago, Eleonor G; Vaccari, Alessandra; Fiori, Renato M\n\n2013-02-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to investigate clinical features and outcomes of children treated for congenital syphilis (CS). Infants born alive in the public sector of SÃ£o Lucas Hospital, Porto Alegre, Brazil, 1997 to 2004, whose mothers had syphilis and neonates with CS born in other facilities and admitted during this period were included. Follow-up was performed from birth up to 5 years. Among 24,920 live births, 379 (1.5%) met the criteria for CS. A further 19 infants born in other hospitals were included, for a total of 398 with CS. We compared infants with CS with 120 infants whose mothers received adequate treatment of syphilis before delivery (total sample, 518 infants). Congenital syphilis was associated with delivery before 34 weeks, low birth weight, and small for gestational age. During the study period, 37 stillbirths with CS were detected. Result from the serum venereal disease research laboratory test was negative at birth in 17.5% of the neonates with CS, and in 4 infants, it became positive after the second day. Thirty percent of the infants with CS were reevaluated between 8 and 60 months, and most had a good outcome when managed according to standard guidelines. Sixteen infants (13.3%) had sequelae. Of these, 8 were symptomatic in the neonatal period, and 13 (81%) of 16 had laboratory/x-ray findings. All asymptomatic and 78% of symptomatic infants had nonreactive fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test after 12 months of age. Congenital syphilis remains an impacting disease that causes fetal and neonatal deaths, prematurity, low birth weight, and severe and irreversible sequelae in some children. This study confirms the value of standard guidelines for its management.\n\nIncrease in incidence of congenital syphilis - United States, 2012-2014.\n\nPubMed\n\nBowen, Virginia; Su, John; Torrone, Elizabeth; Kidd, Sarah; Weinstock, Hillard\n\n2015-11-13\n\nCongenital syphilis (CS) occurs when a mother infected with syphilis transmits the infection to her child during pregnancy. CS can cause severe illness, miscarriage, stillbirth, and early infant death. However, among pregnant women with syphilis who deliver after 20 weeks gestation, maternal treatment with penicillin is 98% effective at preventing CS (1). In the United States, the rate of CS decreased during 1991â2005 but increased slightly during 2005â2008 (2). To assess recent trends in CS, CDC analyzed national surveillance data reported during 2008â2014, calculated rates, and described selected characteristics of infants with CS and their mothers. The overall rate of reported CS decreased from 10.5 to 8.4 cases per 100,000 live births during 2008â2012, and then increased to 11.6 cases per 100,000 live births in 2014, the highest CS rate reported since 2001. From 2012 to 2014, reported cases and rates of CS increased across all regions of the United States. To reduce CS, the timely identification of and response to increases in syphilis among women of reproductive age and men who have sex with women are essential. All women should have access to quality prenatal care, including syphilis screening and adequate treatment, during pregnancy (3).\n\nRisk of Congenital Syphilis (CS) Following Treatment of Maternal Syphilis: Results of a CS Control Program in China.\n\nPubMed\n\nHong, Fu-Chang; Wu, Xiao-Bing; Yang, Fan; Lan, Li-Na; Guan, Yang; Zhang, Chun-Lai; Feng, Tie-Jian; Yang, Ying-Zhou; Yin, Yue-Ping; Yu, Wei-Ye; Chen, Xiang-Sheng\n\n2017-08-15\n\nEarly screening for syphilis among pregnant women and the effective treatment of maternal syphilis is fundamental to prevent congenital syphilis (CS). We obtained data from the Shenzhen Program for Prevention of CS (SPPCS) and estimated incidence rates of CS among infants born to syphilis-seropositive women treated with different regimens or untreated for maternal syphilis. A total of 4746 matched cases of syphilis-seropositive mothers and their infants were included for analyses, and 162 infants were diagnosed with CS, providing an overall incidence of 3.41% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.91%-3.98%). Among infants born to syphilis-seropositive women who had syphilis and were adequately treated before pregnancy, the incidence was 0.22% (95% CI, .05%-.66%). There were 159 cases of CS occurring in 3519 infants born to women who were syphilis-seropositive during their pregnancies, for an incidence of 4.52% (95% CI, 3.84%-5.28%). The incidence of CS was 1.82%-11.90% lower among infants born to the women treated with early benzathine penicillin G (BPG) compared with those treated with late BPG (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 8.06 [95% CI, 2.93-22.21]; P < .001), other antibiotics (aOR, 7.71 [95% CI, .86-69.28]; P = .068), or those untreated (aOR, 68.28 [95% CI, 29.64-157.28]; P < .001). The incidence rates were 0.22% (95% CI, .06%-.80%) and 0.59% (95% CI, .35%-1.02%) in infants born to women treated with 2 courses and 1 course of BPG, respectively, corresponding to a risk difference of 0.37% (aOR, 1.74; 95% CI, .37-8.26). Treatment of syphilis-seropositive pregnant women with 1 course of intramuscular BPG before 28 gestational weeks is critical for prevention of CS. Â© The Author 2017.

L.; Blanco, S.; Santander, A.; Estenssoro, M.; Torrico, F.; Seoane, G.; Brady, W.; Fears, M.; Lewis, J.; Pope, V.; Guarner, J.; Levine, W. C.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nOBJECTIVES: The present study was carried out in seven maternity hospitals to determine the prevalence of maternal syphilis at the time of delivery and the associated risk factors, to conduct a pilot project of rapid syphilis testing in hospital laboratories, to assure the quality of syphilis testing, and to determine the rate of congenital syphilis in infants born to women with syphilis at the time of delivery--all of which would provide baseline data for a national prevention programme in Bolivia. METHODS: All women delivering either live-born or stillborn infants in the seven participating hospitals in and around La Paz, El Alto, and Cochabamba between June and November 1996 were eligible for enrolment in the study. FINDINGS: A total of 61 out of 1428 mothers (4.3%) of live-born infants and 11 out of 43 mothers (26%) of stillborn infants were found to have syphilis at delivery. Multivariate analysis showed that women with live-born infants who had less than secondary-level education, who did not watch television during the week before delivery (this was used as an indicator of socioeconomic status), who had a previous history of syphilis, or who had more than one partner during the pregnancy were at increased risk of syphilis. While 76% of the study population had received prenatal care, only 17% had syphilis testing carried out during the pregnancy; 91% of serum samples that were reactive to rapid plasma reagin (RPR) tests were also reactive to fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption (FTA-ABS) testing. There was 96% agreement between the results from local hospital laboratories and national reference laboratories in their testing of RPR reactivity of serum samples. Congenital syphilis infection was confirmed by laboratory tests in 15% of 66 infants born to women with positive RPR and FTA-ABS testing. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that a congenital syphilis prevention programme in Bolivia could substantially reduce adverse infant outcomes due to this\n\nIncidence of congenital syphilis in Brazil and its relationship with the Family Health Strategy.\n\nPubMed\n\nAraÃºjo, Cinthia Lociks de; Shimizu, Helena Eri; Sousa, Artur Iuri Alves de; Hamann, Edgar MerchÃ¡n\n\n2012-06-01\n\nTo estimate the incidence of congenital syphilis and identify its relationship with Family Health Strategy coverage. An observational ecological study was carried out with both descriptive and analytical components, by two different approaches: one that explores a temporal series (2003 to 2008) and one that focuses on the 2008 data. The secondary data (epidemiological, demographic, and socioeconomic) were obtained from the Department of Informatics of the Unified Health System and the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. Analysis of the possible effects of the implementation of the Family Health Strategy on the prevention of congenital syphilis was performed on selected subgroups of counties according to two approaches: a) the variation of the average annual rate of incidence of congenital syphilis in different strata of Family Health Program coverage between 2003 and 2008 and the calculation of the simple linear regression coefficient; and b) a negative binomial regression analysis of data from 2008 to control for confounding factors. Increasingly trends of congenital syphilis notification in Brazil reflect social inequalities in the distribution of cases. The incidence of congenital syphilis was lower in the counties with high Family Health Strategy coverage; however, after controlling for the co-variables, such an effect might be attributed to the coverage of prenatal care and the demographic characteristics of the counties where the implementation of the Strategy was a priority. Despite the increase in prenatal care coverage, the actions implemented still exhibit low effectiveness in the prevention of congenital syphilis. Prenatal care performed by Family Health Strategy teams did not control syphilis better than the prenatal care performed within the context of other models of assistance.\n\n[Perinatal mortality due to congenital syphilis: a quality-of-care indicator for women's and children's healthcare].\n\nPubMed\n\nSaraceni, ValÃ©ria; GuimarÃ£es, Maria Helena Freitas da Silva; Theme Filha, Mariza Miranda; Leal, Maria do Carmo\n\n2005-01-01\n\nSyphilis is a persistent cause of perinatal mortality in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where this study was performed using data from the mortality data system and investigational reports for fetal and neonatal deaths, mandatory in municipal maternity hospitals. From 1996 to 1998, 13.1% of fetal deaths and 6.5% of neonatal deaths in municipal maternity hospitals were due to congenital syphilis. From 1999 to 2002, the proportions were 16.2% and 7.9%, r"
