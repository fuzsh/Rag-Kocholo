        "text": "Synopsis: When Barbara decides not to pursue another course of aggressive chemotherapy, she invites her closest friends to spend a weekend at her and her late artist husband Benoit's cottage in Somerset. As they travel along the scenic 'Constable Route', they are unaware that Barbara is taking them on a journey acutely different from anything they had envisaged.\n\nMaking of Wisteria Cottage:\n\nRudi Reinbacher's quote on which we end the film - \"To allow unconditional Love into our heart, means to understand what a gift it is to be born into this world\", signifies and underlines the collectively creative and harmonious experience we had, during filming and editing.\n\nThe close-knit friendships and mutual respect provided us with a very special Cast (incl. Kate Isitt's and Nigel Cole's daughter - Matilda), a fine artist an exceptional Director &amp; truly gifted Director of Photography, and unique location at the cottage of our friend Peter Westcott - 'Wisteria Cottage'.\n\nIt also allowed us to experience that inspired vision, determination, creative expression, authenticity and joyful perseverance, do have a place within the film industry. Having written the script so quickly and only having had time for three days of filming, -each and everyone's generous support, commitment and love for the project - has left me grateful and humbled and has taken us - actors and crew - , also on a very special journey. It reassured me that 'Life is Art and vice versa'!"
