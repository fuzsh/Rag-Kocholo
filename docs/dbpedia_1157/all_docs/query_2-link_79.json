        "text": "Here on The Beatles Channel (Ch. 18), we ain’t got nothing but love for our listeners, eight days a week. That’s why we’ve created a show where your votes determine the playlist.\n\nWelcome to “8 Songs A Week”! Each week, listeners can vote for their favorites from a list of songs by John, Paul, George, and Ringo — sometimes by the band, sometimes it’s their solo work. Every Friday, after the votes are tallied, we’ll air the top eight vote-getters from that list.\n\nCheck back weekly at siriusxm.com/8songs for the next poll! You can also stream previous episodes of “8 Songs A Week” on the SiriusXM app.\n\nThis week, we count down your favorite songs connecting The Beatles with Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young.\n\nDirections: Select 3 songs from the list below. You may vote once between 07/26/2024 and 08/16/2024 at 2pm ET."
