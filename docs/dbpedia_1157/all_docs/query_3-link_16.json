        "text": "While I'm a technologist and technology leader, music is also a big part of my life and has been for quite some time. Because of that, I like to bring together the musical part of myself and the leadership side of myself into a weekly article. You won't often get technology-related themes here, but I do share relevant takeaways that apply to leadership, in general (and many of these thoughts can be extrapolated and relevant to non-leaders as well)... I'm also a sucker for alliteration, hence the title of the article series :)\n\nThis week's edition of Music & Management Musings is inspired by and about the group Crosby, Stills & Nash (CSN). CSN is a classic American rock/folk-rock group from the late 60s/70s, formed out of members of well-known acts such as The Byrds (Crosby), Buffalo Springfield (Stills) & The Hollies (Nash). Technically, after forming as CSN, they quickly added Neil Young and became known as Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young (CSNY) ...but I'm focusing on CSN :)\n\nIt doesn't take long into one song to realize that this group can harmonize so incredibly well that it makes you wish everyone would be rocking with three-part harmonies. While being gifted songwriters, their ability to harmonize is where they shine. While being talented musicians, and gifted harmonizers, they band did not always get along. In fact, they dealt with much infighting, had several breakups and fallings out and never really reconciled, as far as I know and can tell.\n\nWhat are some takeaways for leadership?\n\nThere's a lesson and a warning here.\n\nThe Need for Harmony & Playing Your Part\n\nThis is the lesson and maybe a bit of a stretch drawing on the fact that this group's harmonies are sublime. But go with me here. Each member was already successful in their musical career and arguably could have each done their own thing from the start with success. But they came together to play one time, realized how good they sounded together, and joined forces. There are times where Stephen Stills is singing lead vocals and Crosby & Nash are harmonizing, times where Crosby takes the lead and times where Nash does. They found a way to each play their part and play it beautifully. They blended their talents and came up with something incredible.\n\nThere is a need for this within a team too. As leaders, you want to find a way to blend all of your team members' talents - to create that beautiful harmony that comes when this happens. Sometimes it is good and necessary to ask team member A to take the lead and for others to harmonize and other times you may want another team member(s) to lead, while others harmonize. It's all about knowing what your team members' strengths are and where they seek to grow so you can give them those opportunities to lead and then placing the appropriate people around them in support, harmonizing with the lead.\n\nA Warning - Egos and Self-Interest Can Get in the Way\n\nAs mentioned above, CSN (and CSNY) are one of a litany of stories of rock groups that struggled with a clash of egos and opinions and had a falling out (multiple, in fact). This is a risk of a 'super group', if/when people aren't willing to collaborate, partner and let others take the lead at times (creatively/artistically, with the vision for something, etc).\n\nI met with a colleague recently who reminded me of Margaret Heffernan & Super Chickens. In short, it's actually detrimental to have a team of Super Chickens/Superstars... they'll ultimately peck each other to death and overall productivity and joy is drastically decreased. By contrast, the most effective teams, the most successful productions, etc come from a group that is extremely collaborative in nature (spoiler alert...it also comes from teams with more women).\n\nAs a leader, this is extremely relevant for hiring - are you only looking for a super chicken or for someone who will help your team to be more well-rounded and collaborative? It's also relevant for team-building and individual performance considerations - when building your team, how are you thinking and talking about what success looks like? Does it require being involved in flashy projects and initiatives? Does it require being overly vocal with opinions and frequently looking to drive change and evolution? These things are valuable. AND, it's also extremely valuable to have team members that are steady and consistent, who help others and collaborate well but may not be looking for the next big thing or trying to constantly drive change or shake things up. To give another analogy, for those familiar with Radical Candor, Kim Scott talks about Super Stars and Rock Stars. A healthy team needs both.\n\nBack to the Music\n\nAs always, I like to end with at least one song that showcases the points I draw upon above. This week, I'll share the opening track of the group's debut album which was also the song that introduced me to this group many years ago.\n\nSuite: Judy Blue Eyes - Fun fact, this is live from Woodstock, the group's second performance ever.\n\nFun & Not-So-Fun Fact:\n\nI met Stephen Stills in the early 2000s while managing a movie theater (he came to a showing of Mr. Brooks while in town for a concert and I helped get him set up with head sets to help with hearing the movie - decades of live performances were not kind to his hearing).\n\nI talked to him briefly after the move finished and he autographed my CSN record...over Graham Nash's face (still some animosity amongst the group, even in small things, it seemed - picture below)."
