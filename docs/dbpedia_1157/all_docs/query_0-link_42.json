        "text": "Mark is merely following forum protocol by invoking the phrase \"apples and oranges\" whenever a new comparison poll is presented\n\nAfter some thought I have decided to cast my vote of Crosby, Stills & Nash. I like a lot of the songs on Deja Vu better than what's on \"the Couch Album\", but I've never really liked \"Woodstock\", \"Everybody I Love You\" or Graham Nash's overly saccharine contributions. That's just too many weak points despite the very high highs. There are some weaker spots on \"the Couch album\" as well, but they are not nearly as off-putting.\n\nThis is the first poll I've seen where I can't place an honest vote. I've listened to both of these albums countless times and love them both.\n\nIf I had to qualify them I'd say CSN is the better album. But I like Deja Vu better.\n\nAs for the comment about Almost Cut My Hair, all I can say is that depends on where you were in 1970, and I don't mean where you were in a geographical sense.\n\nThe weird thing is that Neil did his songs mostly on his own. He recorded \"Helpless\" with the band, but did \"Country Girl\" by himself. Neil played on \"Almost Cut My Hair\", \"Woodstock\", and \"Everybody I Love You\" (not sure actually). Otherwise, the album was made with Stills doing everything just like before. I think Neil disrupted things by making it more difficult for Stills to have to total control, which is what made the first album work so well. It was mostly Stills calling the shots. I think Neil strengthened Crosby and Nash to go against Stills more, which wasn't a great thing at the time. It disrupted the creative dynamic of the three. The 76-77 sessions for CSN defaulted to a Stills-dominated approach, resulting in relatively stress-free recording sessions and a strong album.\n\nHowever, even without Neil, the three guys weren't in great shape in the fall of 1969. Crosby was mourning his girlfriend. Nash was struggling with Joni. And Stills didn't seem to be over Judy Collins yet. Plus, they had expectations to live up to. The good times from the previous year were over.\n\nI was very hirsute that year, I can dig what your saying."
