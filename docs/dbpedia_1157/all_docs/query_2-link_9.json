        "text": "Early on within CSN or CSNY, I might give Neil Young the slightest of edges, but boy all of them were just in amazing places. Solo I'd certainly go with Neil Young, but again way back when they were all doing some pretty great stuff...in later years the CSNY context has retained it's greatness live, but fallen off as far as any of the worst solo projects ever did, and Neil Young is head & shoulders above the rest...and as far as later solo works, even though Neil might have fallen off a bit, he'd still be way ahead of the other three, who still are a fine live unit.\n\nAs I think of it, Nash's best songs were almost always on either his solo albums or Crosby & Nash albums. Nash had a really strong run from 71 through 78, but not many people know about it, except for \"Just A Song Before I Go\" which was from that era. His tracks on CSN are all representative of his high water mark as a writer. \"Cold Rain\", \"Cathedral\", \"Carried Away\" and \"Just A Song Before I Go\" are some of Nash's best songs. His writing slipped during the eighties and most of the nineties, but his solo album, Songs For Survivors, and the Crosby-Nash album have some of the best stuff he had written since the seventies. Of course his best known songs are from the 69-70 period.\n\nI think the best songs on American Dream are two from Stills: \"Got It Made\" and \"Night Song\", and Crosby's \"Nighttime For The Generals\". Of Neil's tracks, I think \"Name Of Love\" was his best, but a fairly average song in the context of what else he had at the time.\n\nI don't think Looking Forward should ever have been a CSNY album. Neil's songs never sounded more out of place. Those songs were a different album (and of course that's exactly what they were), while the CSN stuff was more unified.\n\nYeah, I love Crosby on the fade out. I never made the connection with \"Ohio\". I wonder if he did the same thing, and just sort of let go with whatever he felt. I think it's a great closer. American Dream was probably just a couple songs too long to work as a coherent album. I'd rather have the songs, but as an \"album\", it was just too long.\n\nI think I'm the only person who like \"Shadowland\". It's an eighties technology-fest, but it works for me. That song has a strange feel to it, possible what was trying to be evoked. At any rate, I think it was Nash's strongest contribution. I've been pilloried on CSN groups for knocking \"Don't Say Goodbye\", but I just don't see it as a great Nash song. He can write those in his sleep.\n\ncount me in as a \"shadowland\" fan too. it was nice to hear it used in a song, i have heard a couple vietnam vets call it that before.\n\ni think the only weak song on \"american dream\" is \"diving thunder\", way to loud and busy, stills cleaned it up a bit on \"man alive\" and it is a better song on there.\n\ni don't think i have a \"favorite\" writer in CSNY, i like and dislike songs by all four of them pretty much equally."
