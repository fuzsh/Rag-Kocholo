        "text": "DISC/CASSETTE ONE:\n\n1. SUITE: JUDY BLUE EYES\n\nCROSBY, STILLS & NASH (7:28)\n\n(Stills; Gold Hill Music, Inc., ASCAP.)\n\nVocals: Crosby, Stills & Nash\n\nGuitars, bass, percussion: Stephen Stills\n\nDrums: Dallas Taylor\n\nRecorded at Wally Heider's Studio III, Los Angeles, early 1969\n\nEngineer: Bill Halverson\n\nProduced by Crosby, Stills & Nash\n\nSong originally released on Crosby, Stills & Nash, May 29, 1969\n\nUnreleased alternate mix.\n\nOriginal 7.5 ips tape courtesy of the Joel Bernstein Collection\n\nIt started out as a long narrative poem about my relationship with Judy Collins. It poured out of me over many months and filled several notebooks. I had a hell of a time getting the music to fit. I was left with all these pieces of song and I said, 'Let's sing them together and call it a suite,' because they were all about the same thing and they led up to the same point. And the little kicker at the end about Cuba was just to liven it up because it had gone on forever and I didn't want it to just fall apart. I said, 'Now that we've sung all these lyrics about one thing, let's change the subject entirely.' And we did. Even did it in a different language just to make sure that nobody could understand it. – Stephen Stills\n\n2. HELPLESSLY HOPING\n\nCROSBY, STILLS, NASH & YOUNG (2:31)\n\n(Stills; Gold Hill Music, Inc., ASCAP.)\n\nVocals: Crosby, Stills & Nash\n\nElectric guitars: Stephen Stills, Neil Young\n\nRhythm guitar: David Crosby\n\nBass: Bruce Palmer\n\nDrums: Dallas Taylor\n\nRecorded at Sunwest Studios, Los Angeles, June 15, 1969\n\nEngineer: Dave Hassinger\n\nProduced by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young\n\nMixed by Stephen Barncard, June 19, 1991\n\nSong originally released on Crosby, Stills & Nash, May 29, 1969\n\nUnreleased live studio version\n\nThis song was inspired a long time ago by my tenth-grade English teacher in Tampa, Florida. She was a real knock-out, so much so that she got all the football players to stand up and read poetry, trying to impress her with how sensitive we were and how much we loved this awful stuff. Some of it must've rubbed off on me. This version is an alternate take where I'm playing a Chet Atkins Country Gentleman style guitar. I couldn't find a real steel player, so I had to make do with my little volume pedal and my Gretsch with the tone bar. – Stephen Stills\n\n3. YOU DON'T HAVE TO CRY\n\nCROSBY, STILLS & NASH (2:40)\n\n(Stills; Gold Hill Music, Inc., ASCAP.)\n\nVocals: Crosby, Stills & Nash\n\nGuitars, bass, percussion: Stephen Stills\n\nRecorded at The Record Plant, New York City, December 1968\n\nEngineer: Paul A. Rothchild\n\nProduced by Paul A. Rothchild\n\nSong originally released on Crosby, Stills & Nash, May 29, 1969\n\nUnreleased first Crosby, Stills & Nash recording\n\nIt was a letter that never got sent. I took bits and pieces of it, put them into a song and it got posted through the record business instead of the mail. – Stephen Stills\n\n4. WOODEN SHIPS\n\nCROSBY, STILLS & NASH (5:26)\n\n(Crosby, Stills & Kantner; Gold Hill Music, Inc., ASCAP/Stay Straight Music, Inc./Icebag Music Corp., BMI.)\n\nVocals: Crosby, Stills & Nash\n\nLead guitar, bass, organ – Stephen Stills\n\nRhythm guitar – David Crosby\n\nDrums – Dallas Taylor\n\nRecorded at Wally Heider's Studio III, Los Angeles, February 20, 1969\n\nEngineer: Bill Halverson\n\nProduced by Crosby, Stills & Nash\n\nOriginally released on Crosby, Stills & Nash, May 29, 1969\n\nWritten in the main cabin of my boat the Mayan. I had the music already. Paul Kantner wrote two verses, Stephen wrote one, and I added the bits at both ends. (Kantner couldn't be credited because he was being sued by his managers.) I borrowed the first part off a little Baptist church sign in Florida that said \"If you smile at me I will understand, because that is something everybody everywhere does in the same language. \" It's a weird science fiction story, but one that could happen tomorrow. \"Silver people on the shoreline\" are guys in radiation suits. We imagined ourselves as the few survivors, escaping on a boat to create a new civilization. Later on, Jackson Browne said 'What about all the people who get left behind?' and wrote \"For Everyman\" in response. – David Crosby\n\n5. GUINNEVERE\n\nDAVID CROSBY (4:45)\n\n(Crosby; Stay Straight Music, BMI.)\n\nGuitars and vocals: David Crosby\n\nBass: Jack Casady\n\nBouzouki: Cyrus Faryar\n\nRecorded at United Studio B, Hollywood, June 26, 1968\n\nEngineer: Bill Halverson\n\nProduced by David Crosby\n\nMixed by Stephen Barncard, June 30, 1991\n\nSong originally released on Crosby, Stills & Nash, May 29, 1969 Unreleased early demo\n\nWhen all my friends were listening to Elvis and 1950s rock 'n' roll, I was listening to Chet Baker, Gerry Mulligan and West Coast jazz. Later I got involved with the folk music scene. After getting kicked out of the Byrds I didn't have a plan, but I went back to my roots, and \"Guinnevere\" is a combination of these two influences. This was a demo I cut on borrowed studio time, hoping to land another record contract. Cyrus Faryar from the Modern Folk Quartet played bouzouki; Jack Casady's bass still gives me chills, it's like another voice. People ask, 'Who was Guinnevere?' Songs are seldom about one person. It's a love song, an answer to some other love songs, and part of a conversation. –David Crosby\n\n6. MARRAKESH EXPRESS\n\nCROSBY, STILLS & NASH (2:36)\n\n(Nash; Nash Notes, BMI.)\n\nVocals: Crosby, Stills & Nash\n\nGuitars, organ, piano, bass: Stephen Stills\n\nAcoustic guitar: Graham Nash\n\nDrums: Jimmy Gordon\n\nRecorded at Wally Heider's Studio III, Los Angeles, early 1969\n\nEngineer: Bill Halverson\n\nProduced by Crosby, Stills & Nash\n\nOriginally released on Crosby, Stills & Nash, May 29, 1969\n\nAn actual journey I took in 1966 from Casablanca to Marrakesh, with my first wife Rose. I came back and played it for the Hollies, who rejected it, along with the first \"Sleep Song. \" After a couple of months of that a man is liable to go insane, especially being the only one who was smoking grass at the time. – Graham Nash\n\n7. LONG TIME GONE\n\nCROSBY, STILLS & NASH (4:17)\n\n(Crosby; Stay Straight Music, BMI.)\n\nVocals: Crosby, Stills & Nash\n\nGuitars, bass, organ: Stephen Stills\n\nElectric rhythm guitar: David Crosby\n\nDrums: Dallas Taylor\n\nRecorded at Wally Heider's Studio III, Los Angeles, early 1969\n\nEngineer: Bill Halverson\n\nProduced by Crosby, Stills & Nash\n\nOriginally released on Crosby, Stills & Nash, May 29, 1969\n\nIt was written the night Bobby Kennedy was killed. I believed in him because he said he wanted to make some positive changes in America, and he hadn't been bought and sold like Johnson and Nixon – cats who made their deals years ago with the special interests in this country in order to gain power. I thought Bobby, like his brother, was a leader who had not made those deals. I was already angry about jack Kennedy getting killed and it boiled over into this song when they got his brother, too. – David Crosby\n\n8. BLACKBIRD\n\nCROSBY, STILLS & NASH (2:33)\n\n(Lennon/McCartney; Maclen Songs, BMI.)\n\nVocals: Crosby, Stills & Nash\n\nAcoustic guitar: Stephen Stills\n\nRecorded at Wally Heider's Studio III, Los Angeles, February 11, 1969\n\nEngineer: Bill Halverson\n\nProduced by Crosby, Stills & Nash\n\nMixed by Stephen Barncard, August 1, 1991\n\nComposition originally released on The Beatles' \"white album\"\n\nUnreleased live studio version\n\nA song by our favorite group. We were staying on Moscow Road in London in 1968, hoping to get onto the Apple record label. The Beatles were recording the \"White Album,\" and when we heard McCartney do \"Blackbird\" we flipped and learned it right away. It was perfect for our three-part harmony. – Graham Nash\n\n9. LADY OF THE ISLAND\n\nCROSBY, STILLS & NASH (2:36)\n\n(Nash; Nash Notes, BMI.)\n\nVocals: Graham Nash, David Crosby\n\nAcoustic guitar: Graham Nash\n\nRecorded at Wally Heider's Studio III, Los Angeles, early 1969\n\nEngineer: Bill Halverson\n\nProduced by Crosby, Stills & Nash\n\nOriginally released on Crosby, Stills & Nash, May 29, 1969\n\nIt's a song for two ladies. The Islands in question are Ibiza and Long Island. Warm gentle feelings. Recorded in one take, Crosby and I improvising that nice little fugue in the middle. – Graham Nash\n\n10. SONG WITH NO WORDS (TREE WITH NO LEAVES)\n\nCROSBY & NASH (3:14)\n\n(Crosby; Stay Straight Music, BMI.)\n\nVocals: David Crosby & Graham Nash\n\n12-string acoustic guitar: David Crosby\n\nRecorded at Wally Heider's Studio A, San Francisco, November 17, 1969\n\nEngineer: Stephen Barncard\n\nProduced by David Crosby & Graham Nash\n\nMixed by Stephen Barncard, June 20, 1991\n\nSong originally released on David Crosby's If I Could Only Remember My Name, February 22, 1971\n\nUnreleased live studio version\n\nWhen I wrote this song it seemed complete, it never asked me for words. I did it, it felt good, so I left it that way. I called it \"Song With No Words,\" and Nash dubbed it \"Tree With No Leaves.\" Early on a lot of people made much of my music being strange, because I used a lot of odd tunings, and the fact that my songs often didn't follow the usual cyclical, short and easy repeat patterns – which is one reason I was thrilled when I met Nash. He understood my stuff the first minute he heard it. Nash has never been puzzled by my music, ever. The farthest out thing I ever tried to do, Nash just went, 'Yeah, sure.' The tunings I use I hit on by fooling around with other guitar players, and experimenting. The way we all got into it was tuning the bottom E string down to D. That was the first one everybody did. The next thing you tried was tuning the top E string down to D also, which Stephen loves, a modal tuning. In \"Song With No Words,\" for all you guitar players, the A is up a whole tone to B, B is down a whole tone to A, and the high E is down a whole tone to D.\n\nIt's the same tuning that gave me \"Guinnevere,\" \"Deja Vu,\" and \"Compass\" – so far. – David Crosby\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\n(cassette one, side two)\n\n11. ALMOST CUT MY HAIR\n\nCROSBY, STILLS, NASH & YOUNG (8:49)\n\n(Crosby; Stay Straight Music, BMI.)\n\nVocals: David Crosby\n\nGuitars: David Crosby, Stephen Stills, Neil Young\n\nOrgan: Graham Nash\n\nBass: Greg Reeves\n\nDrums: Dallas Taylor\n\nRecorded at Wally Heider's Studio C, San Francisco, January 9, 1970\n\nEngineer: Bill Halverson\n\nProduced by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young\n\nSong originally released on Deja Vu, March 11, 1970\n\nUnreleased unedited original version\n\nIt's really Crosby at what I think is his best. It's all live, three guitars, bass, organ and drums, and there are no overdubs. One vocal, and the vocal was sung live ... we did it in San Francisco at Wally Heider's. – Neil Young\n\n12. TEACH YOUR CHILDREN\n\nCROSBY, STILLS, NASH & YOUNG (2:52)\n\n(Nash; Nash Notes, BMI.)\n\nVocals: Crosby, Stills & Nash\n\nGuitars: Graham Nash, Stephen Stills\n\nPedal Steel Guitar: Jerry Garcia\n\nBass: Stephen Stills\n\nTambourine: Graham Nash, Dallas Taylor\n\nRecorded at Wally Heider's Studio C, San Francisco, October 24, 1969\n\nEngineer: Bill Halverson\n\nProduced by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young\n\nOriginally released on Deja Vu, March 11, 1970\n\nThe idea is that you write something so personal that every single person on the planet can relate to it. Once it's there on the vinyl it unfolds, outwards, so that it applies to almost any situation. \"Teach\" started out as a slightly funky English folk song but Stephen put a country beat to it and turned it into a hit record. Jerry Garcia added the pedal steel guitar - which he'd only been playing for two weeks. – Graham Nash\n\n13. HORSES THROUGH A RAINSTORM\n\nCROSBY, STILLS, NASH & YOUNG (3:40)\n\n(Reid & Nash; Nash Notes, BMI/Carlin Music Ltd./Enquiry Music ltd.)\n\nVocals: Crosby, Stills & Nash\n\nElectric guitar: Neil Young\n\nAcoustic Guitar: Graham Nash\n\nOrgan: Stephen Stills\n\nBass: Bruce Palmer\n\nDrums: Dallas Taylor\n\nRecorded at Stephen's house, Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles; and at Wally Heider's Studio III, Los Angeles, December 28, 1969\n\nEngineer: Bill Halverson\n\nProduced by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young\n\nMixed by Stephen Barncard, June 17, 1991\n\nUnreleased song\n\nTerry Reid was an English bluesman I later produced an album for. This was his song, I rewrote and rearranged it a bit. It's a full CSNY band version, an outtake from the Deja Vu album. In the end it smacked a little too much of the pop prisons from which we had all just escaped. – Graham Nash\n\n14. DEJA VU\n\nCROSBY, STILLS, NASH & YOUNG (4:10)\n\n(Crosby; Stay Straight Music, BMI.)\n\nVocals: Crosby, Stills & Nash\n\nBass, electric and acoustic pianos, electric guitar: Stephen Stills\n\nHarmonica: John Sebastian\n\nAcoustic guitar: David Crosby\n\nDrums: Dallas Taylor\n\nRecorded at Wally Heider's Studio C, San Francisco, November 17, 1969\n\nEngineer: Bill Halverson\n\nProduced by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young\n\nOriginally released on Deja Vu, March 11, 1970\n\nI thought then and still think that there's a good possibility that the people who believe in reincarnation are right. That the law of conservation of energy applies: life force just doesn't go away. The identity print gets wiped, mostly, but sometimes there's a ghost print and some stuff hangs around. How else can I explain knowing how to sing harmonies at age six or knowing how to sail a boat the first time I got in one? And having a persistent delusion, all my life, of having been somebody else before. – David Crosby\n\n15. HELPLESS\n\nCROSBY, STILLS, NASH & YOUNG(3:36)\n\n(Young; Cotillion Music Inc./Broken Arrow Music, adm. by Warner-Tamerlane Publishing Corp., BMI.)\n\nVocals: Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young\n\nAcoustic guitar: Neil Young\n\nLead guitar, piano: Stephen Stills\n\nBass: Greg Reeves\n\nDrums: Dallas Taylor\n\nRecorded at Wally Heider's Studio C, San Francisco, November 7, 1969\n\nEngineer: Bill Halverson\n\nProduced by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young\n\nOriginally released on Deja Vu, March 11, 1970\n\nRecorded in San Francisco about four a.m. when everyone got tired enough to play at my speed. – Neil Young\n\n16. 4+20\n\nCROSBY, STILLS, NASH & YOUNG (2:10)\n\n(Stills; Gold Hill Music, Inc., ASCAP.)\n\nGuitar & vocals: Stephen Stills\n\nRecorded at Wally Heider's Studio III, Los Angeles, July16, 1969\n\nEngineer: Bill Halverson\n\nProduced by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young\n\nMixed by Stephen Barncard, July 1, 1991\n\nSong originally released on Deja Vu, March 11, 1970\n\nUnreleased alternate mix\n\nI wanted to hold it for my solo album but the guys insisted we use it on Déjà vu – it means a lot to me – it's about an eighty-four year old poverty stricken man who started and finished with nothing. I recorded the track in one take. I'd intended for David and Graham to sing harmony and even had the parts worked out, but they told me they wouldn't dare touch it, so it always stood alone. – Stephen Stills\n\n17. LAUGHING\n\nDAVID CROSBY (5:24)\n\n(Crosby; Stay Straight Music, BMI.)\n\nVocals: David Crosby, Joni Mitchell, Graham Nash\n\nGuitars: David Crosby\n\nPedal steel guitar: Jerry Garcia\n\nBass: Phil Lesh\n\nDrums: Bill Kreutzmann\n\nRecorded at Wally Heider's Studio C, San Francisco, October 24, 1969\n\nEngineer: Stephen Barncard, assisted by Ellen Burke\n\nProduced by David Crosby\n\nOriginally released on If I Could Only Remember My Name, February 22, 1971\n\nI have fond memories of recording that first solo album. We felt there were people who would understand it, but basically we were thrilling ourselves. Stephen Barncard was my engineer and he did a lot of work to get that acoustic guitar sound. I don't think anybody's ever gotten a better one, frankly. The key to the whole enterprise was great instruments, incredibly well tuned. You can't even attempt this music any other way. And Garcia was wonderful because he's always trying to push the edge of the envelope. He always wants to play something that he hasn't played before. He'll take a swing at a song he's never heard – shooting craps with the music, we loved to do that. He is a truly amazing musician, one of the most articulate and brilliant people who has ever played music. – David Crosby\n\n\"David is a very giving musician, his songs are special and they're very different, so it's always a challenge to work with him. He's into that loose \"anything goes\" creative space, which is especially fun when you're a supporting musician, because of the \"gameness\" it expresses. And the payoff is when you hear it back. It sounds beautiful. Crosby has never gotten the credit he deserves. He's an uncanny singer. He has as much control as anybody I've seen or worked with. He can do things that are truly astonishing if you give him half a chance and when he has his own head and he's in good shape, boy, he's fun to work with.\n\nHe's an inspiration. I think some of the finest playing I've done on record is on his solo album. As far as being personally satisfied with my own performances, which I rarely am, he's gotten better out of me than I get out of myself.\" – Jerry Garcia\n\n18. CARRY ON/QUESTIONS\n\nCROSBY, STILLS, NASH & YOUNG (4:25)\n\n(Stills; Gold Hill Music, Inc., ASCAP.)\n\nVocals: Crosby, Stills & Nash\n\nGuitars, bass, organ, percussion: Stephen Stills\n\nCongas: Stephen Stills, Graham Nash\n\nDrums: Dallas Taylor\n\nRecorded at Wally Heider's Studio C, San Francisco, December 28, 1969\n\nEngineer: Bill Halverson\n\nProduced by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young\n\nOriginally released on Deja Vu, March 11, 1970\n\nI'll never forget the day we cut \"Carry On\" because I'd just bought a new Porsche and it got stolen that morning. The song was written in the middle of the Deja Vu sessions, when Nash told Stephen they still didn't have an opener for the album. It was something of a message to the group, since it had become a real struggle to keep the band together at that point. Stephen combined two unfinished songs and stuck them onto a jam we'd had out in the studio a few nights before, me on drums and Stephen on a Hammond B-3 organ. As the track begins I'm playing bass drums and high hat, and Graham is playing congas. Then we go into a 6/8 groove, which is rather obscure – Stephen loved to change gears that way.\n\nStephen and I had a telepathic rapport; the fact that he started out as a drummer had a lot to do with that. We could just read each other's minds, it was spooky. I always knew just when he was about to take some weird left turn. Whatever he'd decide to do, I'd be there. The sessions would go on all night, sometimes three or four days non-stop. The thing I loved about the studio was you could never tell if it was day or night, and we hid all the clocks so no one knew what time it was. – Dallas Taylor\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nDISC/CASSETTE TWO:\n\n1. WOODSTOCK\n\nCROSBY, STILLS, NASH & YOUNG (3:50)\n\n(Mitchell; Siquomb Publishing, BMI.)\n\nVocals: Crosby, Stills & Nash\n\nElectric guitars: Neil Young, Stephen Stills, David Crosby\n\nOrgan: Stephen Stills\n\nPiano: Graham Nash\n\nBass: Greg Reeves\n\nDrums: Dallas Taylor\n\nRecorded at wally Heider's Studio C, San Francisco, November 5, 1969\n\nEngineer: Russ Gary\n\nMixed by Russ Gary, November 5, 1969\n\nProduced by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young\n\nSong originally released on Deja Vu, March 11, 1970\n\nUnreleased 1969 alternate mix\n\nThe deprivation of being stuck in a New York hotel room and not being able to go provided me with an intense angle on Woodstock. I was one of the fans. I was put in the position of being a kid who couldn't make it. So I was glued to the media. And at the time I was going through a kind of born-again Christian trip – not that I went to any church, I'd given up Christianity at a very early age in Sunday school. But suddenly, as performers, we were in the position of having so many people look to us for leadership, and for some unknown reason, I took it seriously and decided I needed a guide and leaned on God. So I was a little 'God mad' at the time, for lack of a better term, and I had been saying to myself, 'Where are the modern miracles?' Woodstock, for some reason, impressed me as being a modern miracle, like a modern-day fishes-and-loaves story.\n\nFor a herd of people that large to cooperate so well, it was pretty remarkable and there was tremendous optimism. So I wrote the song 'Woodstock' out of these feelings ... – Joni Mitchell\n\n2. OHIO\n\nCROSBY, STILLS, NASH & YOUNG (3:00)\n\n(Young; Cotillion Music Inc/Broken Arrow Music, adm. by Warner-Tamerlane Publishing Corp., BMI.)\n\nVocals: Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young\n\nGuitars: Neil Young, Stephen Stills, David Crosby\n\nBass: Calvin Samuels\n\nDrums: Johnny Barbata\n\nRecorded at Record Plant Studio 3, Los Angeles, May 21, 1970\n\nEngineer: Bill Halverson\n\nProduced by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young\n\nOriginally released as a CSN&Y single, June 4, 1970\n\nThe way I recall it, I was with Neil at a friend's house and handed him Life magazine with the Kent State photos. He was silent for a long time, then picked up his guitar and twenty minutes later had this song. I called Stephen and Graham, and we immediately booked a studio. We gave the master to Ahmet Ertegun who flew it to New York the next day and it was released within the week. \"Teach Your Children\" was heading straight for Number One, and we knocked it right off the charts with our own song, and Nash never said one word about it, to his great credit. He knew how important it was that this song be out there. For me 'Ohio' was a high point of the band, a major point of validity. There we were, reacting to reality, dealing with it on the highest level we could – relevant, immediate. It named names and pointed the finger. It said 'Nixon. ' I was so moved by it that I completely lost it at the end of the song, in the recording studio, screaming ' ... Four ... Why? ... 'How many more? ... ' – David Crosby\n\n3. LOVE THE ONE YOU'RE WITH\n\nSTEPHEN STILLS (3:03)\n\n(Stills; Gold Hill Music, Inc., ASCAP.)\n\nLead vocals, guitars, organ, steel drum, percussion: Stephen Stills\n\nBackground vocals: Rita Coolidge, Priscilla Jones, John Sebastian, David Crosby, Graham Nash\n\nBass: Calvin Samuels\n\nCongas: Jeff Whittaker\n\nRecorded at Island Studios, London, England, March 1970\n\nEngineer: Andy Johns\n\nProduced by Stephen Stills & Bill Halverson\n\nOriginally released on Stephen Stills, November 16, 1970\n\nThis song has been very good to me. The title came from a party with Billy Preston. I asked him if I could pinch this line he had, and he said, 'Sure. ' So I took the phrase and wrote a song around it. It's a good times song, just a bit of fun. My favorite part is the steel drums. I played them before a little bit but I just kept diddling around till I found the right notes. – Stephen Stills\n\n4. OUR HOUSE\n\nCROSBY, STILLS, NASH & YOUNG (2:58)\n\n(Nash; Nash Notes, ASCAP.)\n\nVocals: Crosby, Stills & Nash\n\nPiano: Graham Nash\n\nBass: Greg Reeves\n\nDrums: Dallas Taylor\n\nRecorded at Wally Heider's Studio III, Los Angeles, November 5, 1969\n\nEngineer: Bill Halverson\n\nProduced by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young\n\nOriginally released on Deja Vu, March 11, 1970\n\nWritten for Joni Mitchell, about her house that we shared in Laurel Canyon, on Lookout Mountain. It was written on her piano. Such a charming house. She had a collection of multicolored glass in the window that would catch the light – like ‘fiery gems.' There was a fireplace, and two cats in the yard. It was like a family snapshot, a portrait of our life together. – Graham Nash\n\n5. OLD TIMES GOOD TIMES\n\nSTEPHEN STILLS (3:38)\n\n(Stills; Gold Hill Music, Inc., ASCAP.)\n\nVocals, organ: Stephen Stills\n\nGuitar: Jimi Hendrix\n\nBass: Calvin Samuels\n\nCongas: Jeff Whittaker\n\nDrums: Conrad Isedor\n\nRecorded at Island Studios, London, England\n\nEngineer: Andy Johns\n\nProduced by Stephen Stills & Bill Halverson\n\nOriginally released on Stephen Stills, November 16, 1970\n\nHendrix and I cut a bunch of stuff together, this is one of the few things that surfaced. He was a very dear friend of mine, we were lonely in London together and hung out a lot. I left England suddenly, and years later I learned from Mitch Mitchell that Jimi had been looking for me everywhere – wanted me to join the Experience as the bass player, which would have been my greatest dream in life! It had something to do with a manager deciding it was a wrong career move and said, 'we don't know where he is.' I learned to play lead guitar from Jimi he showed me the scales and said things like, 'You begin by thinking about the chord position and base your improvisations on that.' Or he'd make some little remark like, 'F sharp is really cool,' and we'd develop a jam around that. We'd make up songs, play the blues. He'd improvise until the inspiration began to ebb, then he'd look at me and say, 'You drive.' You had to hear that cat play acoustic guitar! We once jammed for about five days, one long marathon session in my beach house in Malibu. The sheriff's deputy overheard our guitar playing. When he found out it was us he asked permission to park his police car directly outside the house so he could listen in while he fielded radio calls. Told us not to worry about a thing, he'd be looking out for us. – Stephen Stills\n\n6.THE LEE SHORE\n\nCROSBY, STILLS, NASH & YOUNG (5:28)\n\n(Crosby; Stay Straight Music, BMI.)\n\nVocals: Crosby, Stills & Nash\n\nLead guitar: Stephen Stills\n\nElectric rhythm guitar: David Crosby\n\nAcoustic guitar, harmonica: Neil Young\n\nOrgan: Graham Nash\n\nBass: Greg Reeves\n\nDrums: Dallas Taylor\n\nRecorded at Stephen's house, Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles, December 28,1969; Vocal overdubs: Sunset Sound, Los Angeles, August 1, 1991.\n\nEngineer: Bill Halverson\n\nProduced by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young\n\nMixed by Stephen Barncard, August 2, 1991\n\nSong originally released on Four Way Street, April 7,1971\n\nUnreleased version\n\nA song about a twenty year love affair with an Alden schooner.

They added congas, vibes, and harmonies, brought the tape back to me and said, \"This is going on your album, don't give us any shit.\" They were very firm about it.

It was a hallucination. I've always been drawn to strange vocal works. I overdubbed six tracks a cappella, with echo. Later I was left with a persistent feeling it was about Christine Hinton, my girlfriend who was killed. I was very much in love with her, and she went away very suddenly. I was not equipped to deal with the loss. This piece was a sudden, improvised, overwhelming requiem. – David Crosby\n\n9.

It was a period of retreat and re-evaluation. I went to the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles for two nights and stayed for months. I had a little Wurlitzer piano in one room. I'd order room service and only come out at night. I wrote this tune there. I was very proud of Songs for Beginners because it stretched my awareness of who I am a bit further. The title for the album implied a beginning, since it was my first solo effort, but it also implied beginning, meaning songs for people who act, begin things.\n\nBecause people think a lot, but then don't act on their thoughts. – Graham Nash\n\n10.

I was quite literally born into wartime conditions. My father was fighting in the service, while my mother gave birth to me in an upstairs room in Blackpool, by the Northern Sea, where we'd been evacuated during World War II. You could say from a very early age I've been aware of the absurdity of war. There is always one side that wins out economically and industrially because they were the ones who manufactured the war and the weapons.

Joni's own version did not appear until 1972, as the flip side of her \"'You Turn Me On, I'm A Radio.”\n\nUnreleased version\n\nOriginal 7.5 ips tape courtesy of the Joel Bernstein Collection\n\nAfter the break up of CSN following the 1970 tour, David and Graham began a project on their own. They were both tremendous admirers of Joni Mitchell's songwriting, and of course David had produced her first album. Together they decided to cover \"Urge For Going,\" a song Joni had written in Canada in the Spring of 1966 (incidentally one of only two songs she ever wrote in standard tuning). It was intended for the pop singles market, the idea being to record two songs and release a 45.\n\nGraham's vocals hark back to his English sixties pop style, and David is playing very clear twelve-string reminiscent of the Byrds. I came to the studio with Graham just in time to witness a heated argument, as a result of which the song was never completed. The next day David went back to the studio and added vocals on his own to present Graham with a semi-finished version of the song as a peace offering. \"That tape is the only thing that exists of the song and that's what you're listening to now. – Joel Bernstein\n\n13.

But it should certainly be a crushing bore if we did the same old thing all the time. That's why we called the group Crosby, Stills and Nash, and not 'The Spiders,' or something. Everybody would have the chance to carry on their solo careers and do what we wanted in any combination we wanted, in order to make it as interesting as possible, continually updating our relationships and our approaches to music, always open to other influences. – Stephen Stills\n\n17.

I feel most at home in the tropics. Not the high, mountainous rainforests, but down by the ocean. The Tropic of Capricorn. \"My Love\" in the song is really Hawaii, I was thinking of the tropics as a woman. When I finished recording the song I wanted to overdub bongos in the background but there weren't any. So I turned the guitar over and on the back of it thumped out a beat. – Stephen Stills\n\n18.

They shot it with hidden cameras, stuffed in a sack, or under a hat. It showed what it's really, really like to live under apartheid. It made me so mad that I wrote this song in about fifteen minutes. The hard part was making it fit to music. When I began performing it live, I would often segue into \"Crossroads,\" and the two melted together. The real \"Crossroads,\" that is, not the rock 'n' roll version. The Robert Johnson version, rough and uneven, where he would have an eleven bar phrase, followed by a six bar phrase, followed by seven bars. Before it became contrived. That's the type of structure \"Word Game\" followed: it determined its own form based on how I held a word or turned a phrase during the performance. – Stephen Stills\n\n19.

I learned more about songwriting during my two years as Stephen's second-in-command than at any other time in my life. He taught me how to structure a lyric, how to turn a phrase, how to craft a tune. Plus endless little tricks, like hanging onto phrases and half-finished songs instead of tossing them out, because later you'll be writing a new one and these spare parts may just happen to fit. The point about the Byrds and the Springfield is we weren't garage rock bands, we came out of folk music, so the major focus was on the song – if you were gonna get up in front of an audience with just an acoustic guitar, the material had better be good. I think Stephen is one of the most underrated musicians in this country, equally at home with acoustic or electric music.\n\nManassas was a crucible for all types of music-folk, rock, jazz, blues, country, Latin, bluegrass – that band could tackle the entire spectrum of music with awesome musicianship and authenticity. When we were on it was killer. In the studio Stephen was an extraordinary arranger, always asking, 'What can we do to make this a little more interesting. How to take a song and throw in a few left curves?' I felt the song \"It Doesn't Matter\" captured a lot of that Buffalo Springfield sound. There's a certain moment near the end of the song where there's a track-layered harmony, and Stephen is doing a guitar figure which sounds like a bass, it's very rhythmic & it really makes the last chorus great, it boosts the track with something subtle and completely out of context. I really had to stand up on my toes to play with these guys, and I needed to be challenged at that point in my life. He made me try harder, and I like that, I really like that. – Chris Hillman\n\n3.

He held me up for a very long time. Then people started coming up, asking for my autograph, and he let me through immediately. But it still made me angry. I'm not against local color but why should you fight me because you speak differently than I do? That's why the sheet music for \"Immigration Man\" had the world on the front and the moon on the back. When you look at a photograph of the earth you don't see any borders.\n\nThat realization is where our hope as a planet lies. – Graham Nash\n\n4.

The third verse is about my mother. This cuts close to the bone. She was lying in hospital, dying of cancer, and wanted to go while she still had some dignity. She asked me to do it, set her free – coupe de grace, the French call it. So I said, 'Hell, yes. ' I learned how to do it from a doctor friend, and I was perfectly willing to do it, I'm not ashamed to say that. But she found out if she didn't die on the hospital and doctor's schedule, they'd conduct an autopsy and charge me with murder. So she had to go through an extra couple of months of desperate pain. She was a good lady. She taught me music, and was always writing poetry. I loved her a whole lot.

I'm a sailor and I've been sailing for over thirty years. I go out there all the time and I love dolphins and whales, I live with them. And they're gonna wipe them out as a species? That hurts me, I take it personally, and I'm going to do everything I can to fight it. – David Crosby\n\n12. PRISON SONG\n\nGRAHAM NASH (3:11)\n\n(Nash; Nash Notes, BMI.)\n\nVocals: Graham Nash, David Crosby\n\nElectric piano, harmonica: Graham Nash\n\nMandolins: David Lindley\n\nBass: Tim Drummond\n\nDrums: Johnny Barbata\n\nRecorded at Graham's house and at Rudy Records, San Francisco, Spring 1973\n\nEngineer: Don Gooch\n\nProduced by Graham Nash\n\nOriginally released on Wild Tales, January 2, 1974\n\nWhen I was eleven my father bought a camera from a friend with whom he worked, and he set up the darkroom in my bedroom. And then something tragic happened. The police came to our door and told my father that the camera was stolen, and would he tell them who sold it to him. And my father refused to tell the police who it was that sold him the thirty dollar camera. My father spent a year in jail for this camera. And he was a very ordinary, God fearing, good, hard-working man and it broke his heart completely that the judicial system was not fair in this particular case. It really broke him, and he died shortly afterwards.\n\nThe other thing that inspired this song was a letter from a young man in Texas who was serving ten years for one joint of marijuana. And I couldn't figure out why in Ann Arbor, Michigan, you could pay a five dollar fine for the same thing and get off. – Graham Nash\n\n13.

How many people hate to get out of bed in the morning, hate to face the world? You don't want to answer the phone or talk to anybody. Well, me too, except that all we need is someone to awaken us. That's what we need, that's what the song is about. It's for all you people who need waking. – Graham Nash\n\n14.

He played us a tape of some sessions he and Stephen had been recording at Criteria Studios in Miami: \"Black Coral,\" \"Midnight on the Bay,\" \"Human Highway.\" It sounded great, but then Neil said 'Isn't there something missing?' And Crosby goes, 'Yeah, us,' meaning me and David. So the next morning we were on a plane to Miami. We added harmonies to their existing tracks, and recorded some new songs, \"Taken At All\" being one of them. But David and I had to return to Los Angeles to finish our album, and Stephen and Neil had to wrap theirs up so they'd have product to push with the Stills/Young Band tour. The Crosby-Nash harmonies were transferred to safeties, then wiped from the master tapes.\n\nPersonally, this is my favorite CSNY track. Four guitars, four microphones, one take. Written about the group situation in 1976: Can this road be taken at all? – Graham Nash\n\n15.

The guy who was going to take him to the airport said, 'We've got fifteen minutes, I'll bet you can't write a song in that amount of time.' Well you don't smart off to Nash like that, he'll do it. This is the result. –David Crosby\n\n17.

When you're doing your best creative work you're tapping into some other kind of mind than your verbal crystallization memory. I think the intuitive, imaginative levels of the mind are brighter than the rational ones. When a song leaps whole onto the page, fully realized, you know you didn't sit there and say, with your rational mind, \"Tab A into Slot B.\" You never constructed it, and yet here it is, constructed. Over and over again songs occur to me just as I'm dropping off to sleep, when the busy mind gets out of the way. I was 200 miles off shore and woke up in my bunk at 4 a. m. to transcribe these lyrics as if taking dictation. A voice said to me, Shadow Captain of a charcoal gray ship/Trying to give the light the slip ... It's about what many of my songs are about: Who is at the wheel? It's delving inside the cranial swamp, trying to figure out what matters, and why. It said a whole bunch of things I wanted to get said for a long time. I gave the lyrics to Craig Doerge and he wrote the music. – David Crosby\n\n18.

I lost who I was and where I was in that experience. It ended twenty hours later lying on my back in the middle of Stonehenge. I've always been a reverent person, but you can't ignore all the crimes done in the name of religion, and I just wanted to say that Jesus Christ was Jesus Christ, and all the things people say they do in his name is not all that glitters. – Graham Nash\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nDISC/CASSETTE FOUR:\n\n(cassette four, side one)\n\n1.

I was in Williamsburg, Virginia, and burnt out and dead tired. At the end of the concert I began to play the song. I didn't have any words, but I continued to play. I closed my eyes and went into a trance and saw a movie. It was a talking dream where I went back 112 years, to the Civil War. The lyrics just flowed through me like an automatic poem. I sang them as they came into my head and a whole story unfolded. When the concert was over I rushed backstage and madly tried to reconstruct the lyrics. It's a war song, not just a civil war song. We lost that war, too: we still have racism, don't we? – Stephen Stills\n\n5.

It had been our ambition from the start to convince him to join Crosby, Stills and Nash - I wanted an organ player who could sing the blues. He was exceptionally kind to me, but every time I trudged across the moors to see him, he was always occupied. I didn't think there was anyone more shy than me - the phrase 'painfully shy' was invented for this man. We've recorded \"Dear Mr. Fantasy\" a number of times, beginning in 1970. It was intended as an homage. Hats off, Stevie. – Stephen Stills\n\n8.

They were pointing out to these soldiers how they had been lied to by their own government, and ignored when they returned home. One of these veterans was Scott Camil, about whom I'd written \"Oh, Camil! (The Winter Soldier).\" At the same time, David and I had been invited to play at a Vietnam Veterans benefit, and like many Americans we went to see the Vietnam Memorial. It makes most people who walk down it cry before they get half way, and the reason is very simple: there are too many names on that wall.

The idea came from seeing the cover of Time magazine showing a twelve-year old kid proudly holding an AK-47 assault rifle. And I thought, 'How can we have gotten everything so wrong?' No twelve-year old should be anywhere near that gun let alone thinking he's doing the right thing. This is obviously a world that has got some stuff very wrong. – David Crosby\n\n17.

I played it for Dennis but he was in a fog and just didn't get it. I was depressed about that for years. The song is about what it says it's about: the cost of freedom, Abraham Lincoln, Medgar Evers, John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King, Robert Kennedy. And a million others whose names we'll never know. All the martyrs for this fragile thing called democracy, which we are always in danger of having taken away, never more so than today.\n\nWe ended every CSNY concert with this song. After a long evening and raucous electric set, we'd come back out with acoustic guitars, sit quietly on stools, and play this song. Leave everybody in a quiet space together. We came out of the sixties with a lot of crap but a few wonderful ideals, and one was the sense of community. It's a positive legacy.\n\nThe song is a tombstone. – Stephen Stills\n\nBack to Crosby, Stills & Nash Main Page\n\nTo the Crosby, Stills & Nash box set tracklist\n\nTo the CSN Discography"
