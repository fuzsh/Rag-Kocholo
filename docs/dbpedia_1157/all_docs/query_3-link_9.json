        "text": "Crosby, Stills & Nash was a folk rock “supergroup” made up of American singer-songwriters David Crosby, Stephen Stills and English singer-songwriter Graham Nash. When joined by Canadian singer-songwriter Neil Young as a fourth member, they were called Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. They are noted for their intricate vocal harmonies and lasting influence on American music and culture, as well as their political activism and often tumultuous interpersonal relationships. Their music comes to life by two seasoned tribute bands when performing from The Emerson Center stage on Thursday evening, February 22, at 7 p.m. LIVE! From Vero Beach is proud to showcase Broken Arrow and Laurel Canyon.\n\nThis double header concert is presented by MusicWorks, Inc. and Paris Productions.

The band delivers these classic songs faithfully while taking them out on some jamming excursions and tastefully tweaking some of the arrangements. Joe Mass nails the Neil vocals perfectly and the harmonies are spot on. These guys are our most requested band to return to LIVE! From Vero Beach and always have audiences on their feet singing along and demanding encores at every show.\n\nLaurel Canyon is an acoustic tribute to the music of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young and a newcomer to our concert series. Featuring recreations of their seminal works as well as songs from their early bands and their solo years, Laurel Canyon is a trio consisting of Grammy Award winning writer/producer Mark Hudson, Hall of Fame Songwriter Gary Burr, and singer songwriter Mark Mirando. This double header concert is sure to please our audience."
