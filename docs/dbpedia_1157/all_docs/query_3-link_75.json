        "text": "In an interview with Billboard, Graham Nash had some harsh words for bandmate David Crosby when asked about the future of Crosby, Stills and Nash.\n\n“Right now, I don’t want anything to do with Crosby at all. It’s just that simple,” he said. “In my world there will never, ever be a Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young record and there will never be another Crosby, Stills & Nash record or show.” While declining to say what exactly Crosby has done, he did continue by saying, “I don’t like David Crosby right now. He’s been awful for me the last two years, just fucking awful. I’ve been there and saved his fucking ass for 45 years, and he treated me like shit. You can’t do that to me. You can do it for a day or so, until I think you’re going to come around. When it goes on longer, and I keep getting nasty emails from him, I’m done. Fuck you. David has ripped the heart out of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young.”\n\nNash did note that he was “sad” about the current state of his relationship with Crosby, adding that he was hoping they’d be able to reconvene for a covers album they started working on with producer Rick Rubin. Nash’s latest, This Path Tonight, will be released on April 15 via Blue Castle.\n\nCrosby Steals the Cash and Runs.\n\nGraham Nash has bailed Crosby out for decades. But it made him a lot of money. Stills sounds awful, his singing is completely off key. Yes, I know he's deaf. It does not make the the top notch act Nash wants it to be. THEY have to be either deaf themselves or on drugs to put up with Still's Yoko Ono worthy off key blitzes. Stills can still play a mean guitar. Crosby can still sing. Graham Nash is worthless at this point. Old men nearly washed up arguing. At $100 a ticket? NOT.\n\n.... the future of Crosby, Stills and Nash.\n\nThese guys produced some great music in the past. The distant past, in most cases.\n\nAnd they have recycled avidly - a CSN box-set and individual ones.\n\nSing and play together for fun, guys, but please don't think that you have a future where you are relevant musically.\n\nAnd the same applies to other acts, sadly. Know when to quit.\n\nI agree, I wouldn't bother with CSN, in fact I walked out of their show in the mid-90's. It was boring, and watching uptight yuppies dancing to Woodstock in the 300$ seats was a sick joke!\n\nThat said, David Crosby is alive and well and creating fantastic new sounds, his last record \"Croz\" was one of the finest offerings he has ever done, since \"If I Could Only Remember My Name\", and it wasn't \"living legend\" hackery, or resting on laurels, it was original, contemporary, and miles away from CSN.\n\nI apparently had completely different experiences than many of you.\n\nI saw them on the tour shortly after 9/11 that supported their self-promoted album ( which is very good and under appreciated ) and then again a few years later when they were playing tunes from Neil's Living with War Album and projecting images of W. while they shouted out \"Liar!\"\n\nBoth were awesome but the edgy political show was so rock'n'roll it qualifies maybe as the best show I've EVER seen. Parts of the crowd were chanting along, other were shocked and gasping, and others were just boogying away.\n\nThat wasn't that long ago and not something any mainstream act that I know of would have the courage to do.\n\nTake away the Y, though, and that probably doesn't happen....\n\nMaybe I got a good show or my ears didn't hear the off key stuff, but I got to see them from the 2nd row at the Hartman Arena in Wichita in 2012 and it was absolutely beautiful. I put on their old stuff the next day and turned it back off because it didn't sound nearly as good as it did when it was right in front of me.\n\nhttp://www.setlist.fm/setlist/crosby-stills-and-nash/2012/hartman-arena-wichita-ks-3c3b99f.html\n\nThis article makes me happy that I got to see them once and check it off my bucket list.\n\nhttp://ultimateclassicrock.com/david-crosby-graham-nash-origins-feud/\n\nDavid Crosby has provided insight into a simmering feud with Graham Nash that boiled over publicly earlier this month, pointing to Nashâ€™s autobiography as a sticking point.\n\nNash confirmed the end of Crosby, Stills and Nash, saying he hadnâ€™t been getting along with Crosby for some time.\n\nBut before that interview appeared, Crosby had already confirmed the bandâ€™s hiatus in a talk with the (San Diego) Union-Tribune. â€œI wouldnâ€™t say CSN was alive and well, no,â€ Crosby said in comments from late February that were published this week. â€œIâ€™d say itâ€™s on indefinite hold.â€\n\nPassages that Crosby says were fabricated from Nashâ€™s 2013 memoir Wild Tales: A Rock & Roll Life appear to have soured their relationship.\n\nâ€œGrahamâ€™s book is full of inaccuracies and chock-full of misinformation,â€ Crosby said. â€œWhen he handed [an advance copy] to me, he said, â€˜Itâ€™s too late to change anything, but here it is.â€™ I was very unhappy about it. Itâ€™s a very shallow, very self-serving book, and full of BS.â€\n\nCrosby cited several instances where he insists Nash took too much creative license, writing â€œthings that were not true because they would sell the book.â€\n\nAs they grew apart, Crosby returned to his solo career, issuing Croz in 2014. Now he has not one but two more albums arriving soon. The first, tentatively titled Lighthouse, is a collaboration with Michael League of Snarky Puppy, a Grammy-winning jazz band. The second project, as with Croz, finds Crosby working with his son James Raymond.\n\nContacted again by the Union-Tribune yesterday, Crosby avoided talk of Nash. â€œI donâ€™t want to even go there,â€ he said. â€œIâ€™m going to take the high road. Iâ€™m very, very happy. And Iâ€™m extremely happy the music is coming to me in such a wonderful way. I have a finished album in my computer, and another one on the way. My family loves me, I love them, and Iâ€™m having a blast on the road. And thatâ€™s my answer to everything.â€"
