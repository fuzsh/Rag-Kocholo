        "text": "David Crosby, Stephen Stills and Graham Nash helped bridge the ‘60s and ‘70s with their harmonies and songs about peace and love during a time of war.\n\nThe group formed after the three distinct singer-songwriters parted ways with their former bands: Crosby was in the Byrds, Stills was in Buffalo Springfield and Nash was in the Hollies. Later, Stills' old bandmate Neil Young joined."
