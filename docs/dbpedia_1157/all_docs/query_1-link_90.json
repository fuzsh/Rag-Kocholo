        "text": "Man, I love reading this. Mine is scheduled to arrive on Wednesday. I can't wait to hear the Bellman mastered LP. I've owned several versions of this on vinyl, and still have the following two:\n\n1970 US Atlantic Records, Mastered by Al Brown and pressed at Monarch Records, with black faux cover: https://www.discogs.com/Crosby-Stills-Nash-Young-Déjà-Vu/release/10722495\n\n1977 US Atlantic Records Reissue, Mastered by George Piros and pressed at Specialty Records Corporation, with faux brown leather cover: https://www.discogs.com/Crosby-Stills-Nash-Young-Déjà-Vu/release/4753808\n\nTo my ears, the George Piros cut sounds superior in all ways to the original US Al Brown cut version. I can't wait to hear the Bellman cut. From everything I read, it should beat the Prios cut. I actually bought this package just for the new vinyl pressing. The CDs will be a nice bonus, but the vinyl will get most of my listening time.\n\nSusan Nash had obviously been part of CSN(Y)’s lives for some 40 years; Stills has spoken very highly of her and she was tight friends with Jan Crosby, so no doubt Nash’s behaviour didn’t go down well......Stills very very rarely comments publicly, to him it’s personal family stuff and no-one else’s darn business, but Croz and Nash slug it out in public......\n\nCroz has never actually retracted what he said about Darryl Hannah- “I was wrong, Darryl is OK”- he said he shouldn’t have said it, he’s said he has no right in view of his own mistakes, but he’s never retracted it, and that isn’t lost on Young.....\n\nIMHO Croz’s last four albums are WAY better than the last four CSN(Y) albums, and you don’t have to like Croz to agree....\n\nThey’re done. I wish it had been neater and cooler........\n\nRight on\n\nVery good point. This logic however, applies to both sides of the political spectrum depending on your point of view. In this case we know that Graham is a staunch progressive so this indeed could be a reason for his curmudgeonly behavior. I believe more on the lines that he is like most, a self centered, pampered rock star.\n\nAs I believe Nash and Crosby pointed out in the CBS interview, and as everyone has known for decades, Neil was never really fully on board with CSNY in 1969/1970, so it’s hardly surprising he would pull some of “his” songs from this set. He did Country Girl on his own and brought it in for the other guys to sing on. It is what it is, to Neil other people, from CSN to Crazy Horse, are there to be used and discarded according to his whims of the moment. If you admire him, he’s a courageous lone wolf, blah blah blah, if you don’t, he’s just kind of a very talented jerk. Of course, all four of them are very talented jerks, but Neil has always been in a league of his own in that regard.\n\nBelow is a list of original recordings, alternates, outtakes, and demos from Deja Vu sessions (roughly those that were recorded between 5/29/69- the release of Crosby, Stills and Nash- and 3/11/70- the release of Deja Vu) and where they appear. My sources are the Deja Vu boxset, the CSN boxset, the Carry On boxset, Reflections boxset, Over The Years, Replay, Crosby Stills and Nash (expanded edition), and Demos. I don't own Voyager or Archives Vol.1, so anything from those releases are missing.
