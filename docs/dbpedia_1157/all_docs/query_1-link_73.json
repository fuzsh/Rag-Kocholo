        "text": "In the history of music, most supergroups failed to meet expectations. One of them crushed them all yet: Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young.\n\nFormer members of Buffalo Springfield, The Hollies and The Byrds combined their skills to invade airwaves in late 60s and early 70s.\n\nHalf a century after their golden period, how is their discography performing on streaming platforms?\n\nUpdated on May 10, 2021\n\nCrosby Stills Nash & Young streaming review – the method\n\nStreaming is made up of audio and video streams. Our CSPC methodology now includes both to better reflect the real popularity of each track. The main source of data for each avenue is respectively Spotify and YouTube.\n\nTo factor in the growing impact of multiple Asian countries where these platforms aren’t always the go-to site for music streaming, more sources have been added.\n\nIn order to account for their real popularity in each relevant country, the below sources have been used along with the mentioned ratios that reflect the market share of each area.\n\nAudio Streams\n\n– South Korea : Genie streams * 3.05 (consistent with Gaon streaming numbers)\n\n– Japan : AWA streams * 100/5.5 (AWA has 5.5% of the Japanese streaming market)\n\n– Elsewhere : Spotify streams * (370 – 8.5 – 9.5 – 33 – 9) / 207 (370 million global subscribers minus 8.5 million from South Korea minus 9.5 million from Japan minus 33 million from China divided by the number of Spotify only users minus 9 million more Asian users) + Genie streams * 3.05 (uses Genie rather than Spotify to extrapolate markets like Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam)\n\nVideo Streams\n\n– China* : QQ video streams * 50 if the song is available for audio stream, QQ video streams * 5 elseway (scale built based on known figures for several major artists)\n\n– Elsewhere : Youtube views\n\n*since 96.4% of Chinese streaming platforms are free users, that paid-for users pay less than $2 a month and that they are also used as video streaming platforms, their streams are weighted on par with YouTube streams.\n\nAudio Stream value – 1500 plays equal 1 album unit\n\nVideo Stream value – 11,750 views equal 1 album unit\n\nEquivalent Albums Sales (EAS) = ( Spotify * 310/207 + Genie * 3.05*2 + AWA * 100/5.5 ) / 1500 + ( QQ views* 50(or 5) + YouTube ) / 11750\n\nCrosby Stills Nash & Young streaming review – the results\n\nTotal: 759,029 EAS\n\nCrosby Stills Nash & Young most streamed tracks (EAS)\n\n1. Our House [Déjà Vu] – 89,000\n\n2. Suite: Judy Blue Eyes [Crosby, Stills & Nash] – 87,000\n\n3. Ohio [Orphan (CSN(&Y))] – 84,000\n\n4. Helplessly Hoping [Crosby, Stills & Nash] – 83,000\n\n5.
