        "text": "The thing about David Crosby is there really wasn’t anyone like him. A fearless musician, he occupied a musical territory that was entirely his own: voice, tunes, chords, scat singing, sound, mood and atmosphere – all of them were his alone. He didn’t imitate anyone. Most musicians are happy to identify a sound or style that they like and then emulate it, or perhaps synthesise a couple in search of a hybrid. Crosby didn’t think that way: he talked often – usually very generously – about his influences, but he didn’t sound like any of them, even his closest comparison Joni Mitchell.\n\nDavid Crosby died yesterday, aged 81. He’d been ill a while, had appeared frail in recent years, and had lived for nearly 30 years after a liver transplant. Nonethess, he had enjoyed something of a creative rebirth in recent years, releasing five good-to-very good solo albums in the last decade of his life. Casual fans who’ve not checked out any of them absolutely should – there’s work there that easily stands comparison with his best songs from his days in the Byrds, his creative partnerships with Stephen Stills, Graham Nash and Neil Young, and his storied solo debut, If I Could Only Remember My Name.\n\nMost of the obituaries I’ve seen today have focused on his work in the Byrds and the first CSN and CSNY albums, which makes sense – they were his most high-profile work.\n\nBut I’d like to speak up for If I Could Only Remember My Name (1971) and Graham Nash David Crosby (1972), which are very much of a piece musically and mean the most to me emotionally.\n\nMy feelings about If I Could Only Remember My Name are completely bound up with the time and place I first heard it. The day of my final exams at university was the same day as my housemate James’s finals. After they were done, we met up at the union then headed home, sitting up all night to drink and listen to records from each other’s collections. At whatever ridiculous time of day James put on If I Could Only Remember My Name, it sounded magical – like the best album I’d ever head.\n\nAt the time, I wasn’t a CSN buff. I may have had Crosby, Stills and Nash. I certainly had some Byrds albums (Younger than Yesterday and The Notorious Byrd Brothers), so knew a little of Crosby’s work. I knew a little Neil Young and a little Joni Mitchell. I knew nothing of the Grateful Dead or Jefferson Airplane, so I didn’t really clock the album as the great meeting point of San Francisco and LA rock luminaries that it is.\n\nBut I responded so strongly to the sound of the album, the mood of it. The harmonies, the atmosphere. Recorded by Crosby in a place of deepest, hardest grief, it’s a profound and transcendent experience – by turns questing, comforting, visionary, angry, and numb.\n\nThat mood continues into the songs on his first duo record with Nash, released the next year. Once again featuring Phil Lesh, Bill Kreutzmann and Jerry Garcia, as well the guys from the Section, Graham Nash David Crosby is much overshadowed by Crosby, Stills and Nash and Déjà Vu. But while not featuring showstoppers like Suite: Judy Blue Eyes, Helpless, Teach Your Children or Woodstock, I feel like it’s a more satisfying front-to-back experience than either – imagine a record mostly made up of Guinneveres and Simple Mans. Nash, being Nash, pens a couple of poppier songs (Immigration Man and the lovely, country-folk rocker Southbound Train), but mostly it’s downtempo, pensive and completely gorgeous – a feast of those Nash/Crosby harmonies.\n\nCrosby was such a strong harmony singer that other artists sought him out, with and without Graham Nash, to illuminate their records – even sometimes records you might hear on pop radio. That’s Crosby on backing vocals on Jackson Browne’s Doctor My Eyes, on Phil Collins’s Another Day in Paradise, on Hootie and the Blowfish’s Hold My Hand.\n\nNonetheless – as the only member of CSNY who never authored a hit single – Crosby remains somewhat overshadowed by his one-time bandmates in popular consciousness, as famous for his drug-fuelled excesses as his music. When a notable musician dies, there’s always a re-evaluation of their work. I hope that Crosby’s passing will inspire people to check out the lesser-known works in his discography, as not only was he one of the great harmony singers of the rock era, but one of the great writers, guitar players and lead singers too. Godspeed, Croz.\n\nLA was crawling with singer-songwriters in the early 1970s, from the stunningly talented likes of Tim Buckley, Joni Mitchell and Judee Sill, through the foursquare and reliable Jackson Browne/JD Souther types, to the pleasant but inconsequential talents like Ned Doheny and Pamela Polland.\n\nLaurel Canyon is the part that stands for the whole of the LA singer-songwriter scene, but Linda Perhacs was a Topanga Canyon resident, and the difference was all the difference. Physically further removed from Hollywood than Laurel Canyon, Topanga in 1970 was where Neil Young had made his home, and Young’s rather-be-on-my-own attitude epitomised the Topanga spirit. Perhacs was not a joiner or a hustler, wouldn’t have fit in among the more ambitious Laurel Canyon crowd, and indeed would probably never have been heard at all if composer Leonard Rosenman hadn’t have been a patient at the Beverly Hills dental practice where she worked.\n\nIn Perhacs’ version of the story, it was only after many appointments that Rosenman asked her what she did when she wasn’t working and, sensing she could be a gateway to the hippie community he wanted to access in order to come up with the right kind of a music for a TV project he was working on, asked to hear the songs she wrote in her spare time.\n\nRosenman was impressed by what he heard, particularly the song Parallelograms, and told Perhacs he wanted to make an album with her and would secure the budget needed to make it happen.\n\nHey, Who Really Cares appeared on Parallelograms, and became the theme for Matt Lincoln, the short-lived TV series for which Rosenman had been commissioned to provide music. It’s a stunning piece of work. In feeling and mood, it recalls the moody medievalisms of David Crosby (songs like Guinnevere, Where Will I Be and The Lee Shore) and Clouds-era Joni Mitchell; musically, the fingerpicked chords with ringing E and B strings sound a little like Love (on, for example, Maybe the People Would Be the Times and Alone Again Or). The sinuous bass guitar, meanwhile, reminds me of nothing so much as PFM backing Fabrizio de André. Perhacs’ voice is clear as a bell, often sounding like that of a cut-glass British folk singer. It’s a beautiful song, with some heart-stopping melodic twists and turns, and a wonderful arrangement by Rosenman. If Perhacs isn’t quite up there with Sill, Mitchell, Buckley, Crosby et al., she was light years ahead of many of the cowboy-chord mediocrities whose music receieved greater exposure than hers.\n\nThe hype over “rediscovered” artists can be off-putting, and their art seldom lives up to the grand claims made for it. At the time that Linda Perhacs’ 1970 album Parallelograms began to be reissued (and at this point, it’s been reissued five or six times by as many different labels), I was hyper wary – the media fad for freak folk was at its height, and I’d been left mystified by the popularity of Devendra Banhart and Joanna Newsom, and astonished at the reverence being afforded to Vashti Bunyan’s 1970 precursor, Just Another Diamond Day. So with Banhart singing Parallelograms‘ praises to the UK monthlies, it seemed wise to steer clear.\n\nA shame. Some records, some artists, really are deserving of their reputations. I’ve chosen Hey, Who Really Cares as a representative track, but if you like it, you’ll dig the whole thing.\n\nI’m very late to the party on Simon Reynolds’s Retromania, mainly because I felt like he was probably going to be talking about a lot of artists and genres about which I knew nothing, and to get much out of the book I was going to have to get familiar with swathes of new (to me) music. As it turns out, I enjoyed it hugely. I was familiar enough with some of the artists to get the general point, and a bit of listening to some key tracks here and there filled in enough of the blanks for me when Reynolds was discussing stuff I didn’t know.\n\nThe whole idea of newness in art (music especially, but art generally) is one that’s occupied my mind a lot down the years. If you’ve read many of the pieces on this blog you’ll know that there are styles and eras I’m fonder of than others, and that I’m particularly interested in alt.rock from the 1980s and 1990s, and 1970s singer-songwriter stuff (some, like Paul Simon, I heard in my young childhood, but much of which I discovered as an adult).\n\nThis music, it hardly needs saying, is not new. Not on the level of sonics, not on the level of song structure, not harmonically, arrangementally, or any other way you care to mention. And yet, when I listen to, say, Judee Sill, Nick Drake, Joni Mitchell or David Crosby I hear newness. At any rate, I hear uniqueness – I hear things that I’ve not heard in the music of any other songwriter, and I hear melodic, harmonic and lyrical ideas that seem to me could only have had one author. I don’t believe any other songwriter than Sill could have written Jesus Was a Cross Maker or The Donor. Only Crosby could have written Where Will I Be or The Lee Shore.\n\nI’ve no grand rebuttal to Reynolds’s theories, but I’m thinking a lot about how we account for this kind of originality within his conception of pop culture, where newness is most often seen as being a result of either technological progress, or the bringing together of genres that previously seemed impervious to synthesis with others and so on. This sort of uniqueness, newness, originality, call it what you will, comes from an individual’s (or group’s, if we’re talking about a band) ability to resist the lure of pastiche, to express themselves through a given medium, whether it’s a guitar, a piano, a laptop or a sampler), and to do so in a way that’s expressive of their own, what, emotions? Personality? Sensibility? All three?\n\nI don’t know. Someone like my friend Yo Zushi might say that none of this has a bearing on the quality of the music, that everyone simply takes consciously or unconsciously from their influences and that their filtering and reuse of these influences constitutes their originality). All I know is that when I listen to, say, Joni Mitchell or Kurt Cobain (to take an example from the era of rock that’s marked me most heavily) I hear musical one-offs, people whose work could not be by anyone else*, and when I listen to, say, Jackson Browne or Dave Grohl, I don’t. It’s not that Mitchell’s and Cobain’s work is always or in any fundamental way better than that of those other artists, but it is their own in a way that I think can be felt by any halfway sensitive listener.\n\nFor someone who’s a pop fan and also writes voice-and-guitar songs, this is a pretty interesting topic. It’s something I’m going to keep chewing over.\n\nJoni\n\n*Both artists did have an imitative phase. All artists do. I’m talking about the work they did when they reached maturity with Blue and Nevermind respectively.\n\nOne sure way to make me happy is to put something by David Crosby on the stereo. I love Croz – his voice, his tunes, his chords, his scat singing. His work, in sound, mood and atmosphere, is singular: no one else can do with a guitar and voice what he does (and, to declare a bias, many of my favourite artists are similar voice-and-guitar one-offs: Joni Mitchell, Judee Sill, Paul Simon). Get Graham Nash to sing a harmony on top and I’ll listen for hours.\n\nIt’s not just Crosby’s music that fascinates me; it’s his career, his place in the history of rock’n’roll, too. As one quarter of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young he was a part of America’s instant Beatles, the four conquering heroes of the counterculture. Yet to win their crown, all they had to do was turn up. They did not need to conquer the world one gig at a time as for example Led Zeppelin did, with their four tours in 1970 alone. They were all already famous from their time in their previous bands and their record had already been released, so they simply picked Woodstock as their coming-out party and made sure they played well enough to justify the hype. That performance alone secured their reputation, as well as introducing the world to CSNY. And in retrospect it is a pivotal moment in the West Coast scene’s move from the socially progressive idealism of the folk-rock mid-sixties to the cocaine-fuelled megalomania of the arena-rock mid-seventies.\n\nBy 1977, when CSN made their third album (simply called CSN), the first wave of singer-songwriters (of whom Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, as individual artists, can all be properly judged to belong) had either ascended to a level of idiosyncrasy that made their music sui generis (like Young, whose ragged electric rock distinguished him firmly from his mellow peers, and Joni Mitchell, who was getting progressively jazzier) or were sliding into a mushy, inoffensive soft rock. Such was the fate of Crosby, Stills and Nash.\n\nThe tracks on CSN were all meditative relationship songs, Fleetwood Mac with a softer beat and the extremes of emotion removed. The cover picture was of the three of them sharing a joke on Crosby’s yacht and this kind of music, as we have discussed in relation to Bobby Caldwell, has come to be known as yacht rock, which is shorthand for a smooth and airy soft rock which spoke loudly of its authors’ success and privilege, symbolised by the yachts on which so many were pictured for album covers. The record’s all very pleasant and the craftsmanship is obvious, but something crucial has been lost here. While the music of the singer-songwriters was usually interior-looking – and by extension could be criticised as self-absorbed and narcissistic – it was still implicitly counter-cultural when so much of it was about quality of consciousness. To examine one’s own existence and in so doing admit that Western capitalism is not in itself enough to bring about peace of mind – let alone enlightenment – is in itself a political act. What infected the music of CSN (and they were far from alone in this) after around 1974 is complacency. The authors of these songs are no longer asking any questions, even of themselves. They seem unaware that there might be a need to.\n\nThe Lee Shore had been written as early as 1970, before this rot sets in. As he relates taking his ‘floating home […] from here to Venezuela’, Crosby – a keen real-life sailor – is once again caught on the horns of that old dilemma: to engage with the world and its inequalities and inequities on one hand, or just drop out and create an alternate society, away from everyone else’s rules, on the other. As a successful rock star, the option to do the latter was available to him. But it was a question he seems never to have resolved within himself. In the end, caught up in the inertial forces of his own addictions and his grief over his girlfriend Christine Hinton’s death in a car accident, he chose instead to bury the issue under cocaine and heroin and it cost him fifteen years of his life.\n\nDavid Crosby almost cut his hair once. He’s still wondering why he didn’t.\n\nCan I trouble you to listen to my new EP, Last Swallow?"
