        "text": "We are working on a letter theme here on My Lost Treasure. It's like the Letter Game from The Boris and Robyn Show. Only different. We are doing a week for each letter. We did a week of songs that start with the letter A, a week of Bs, Cs, etc. Right now we are on the M songs.\n\nEven though I am a huge Neil Young fan, that first CSN album is one of my desert island discs. Even though there is no Neil. The melodies, the harmonies, everything about that album is perfect to me. That is not to say that I don't love what Neil Young brought to the group. Deja Vu is also on my list of favorites. But that first album was and still is an amazing listening experience. And this is an awesome M song from that album.\n\nDo you have an idea for a good M song? I'll take N and O songs too. Let me know at robyn@wpdh.com, or find me on facebook. Thanks for all the great suggestions, please keep them coming!"
