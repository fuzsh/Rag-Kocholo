        "text": "After seeing an HD version of one of my favourite albums was available, I had a look around on the various HD sites, accessible from the UK, namely qobuz, HDTracks, 7Digital, 7Digital worked out the cheapest so went for them. With eager anticipation, I put in my original CD, downloaded the album, unzipped, and opened in foobar. At first, I thought, hmm, it's OK, but nothing amazing. But listening a few times on the first track, something seemed off. Eventually I got it! The first 14 seconds on the right channel on Carry On are silent! So I sent off an email to 7Digital saying, that basically this isn't really what I expect from premium high definition music, so I'd like a refund. 2 working days passed, absolutely no response or refund. Anyone else have trouble with 7Digital with faulty products like this?\n\nAttached below musicscope analysis of three of the tracks:\n\nSimply asking them to provide a refund or fixed version of the track for the reasons above would have been more tactful. They are just storage and a store front, the label obviously messed up the master and provided it to 7digital. 7digital is a massive store front and can't proof every single track in the millions they provide, even if they did they would have to be intimate with the track to find this issue.\n\nI've received digitally corrupt tracks and missing tracks from 7digital twice now. Both times they refunded my purchase within a couple days.\n\nSend them another email about the issue, offer to supply them with the images you displayed above. They might still not offer a refund which I can completely understand, they have delivered you the content provided to them. The issue is with the label more so than 7digital.\n\nHi. I don't think I was particularly tactless, I was just pointing out that given the record company don't seem to have paid that much attention to the first seconds of the very first track, I am not confident the rest of the album has been mastered to a high standard. I understand that they didn't produce the item themselves. Any bricks and mortar retailer who supply physical goods, or even online only such as Amazon wouldn't just say, oh, the supplier supplied a bad product, tough luck, they'd offer a refund or replacement. But given it seems this digital album is identical across all vendors, comparing my own Dynamic Range Meter analysis to that on the loudness wars database, a non faulty replacement doesn't seem like an option:\n\nhttp://dr.loudness-war.info/album/list/year?artist=Crosby%2C+Stills%2C+Nash+%26+Young&album=Deja+Vu\n\nfoobar2000 1.3.12 / Dynamic Range Meter 1.1.1\n\nlog date: 2017-05-07 16:30:54\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnalyzed: Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young / Deja Vu (1)\n\nCrosby, Stills, Nash and Young / Deja Vu (2-10)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDR Peak RMS Duration Track\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDR13 -1.35 dB -16.80 dB 4:28 01-Carry On\n\nDR12 -2.24 dB -16.93 dB 2:54 02-Teach Your Children\n\nDR12 -3.55 dB -18.11 dB 4:30 03-Almost Cut My Hair\n\nDR11 -5.32 dB -20.75 dB 3:40 04-Helpless\n\nDR11 -1.66 dB -16.79 dB 3:54 05-Woodstock\n\nDR11 -3.84 dB -18.05 dB 4:13 06-Deja Vu\n\nDR13 -2.55 dB -19.25 dB 3:00 07-Our House\n\nDR13 -3.52 dB -21.33 dB 2:08 08-4 + 20\n\nDR10 -3.03 dB -15.97 dB 5:13 09-Country Girl: A.

Pono no longer being with us, it looks like other retailers now have hold of it. There's a discussion of its release on Steve Hoffmann forums. No one seems to have noticed the missing channel on the first track.\n\nhttp://forums.stevehoffman.tv/threads/deja-vu-24-192.517335/\n\nThe album was remastered at Bernie Grundman remastering according to pono music's facebook. They also did the 2005 vinyl release, so it may be the same source, although the track timings differ considerably.\n\nhttps://www.discogs.com/Crosby-Stills-Nash-Young-Déjà-Vu/release/2408262\n\nThis album has always had the first 12 seconds silent on the right channel of \"Carry on\". Listened to all my copies. You can hear an open mike in the right channel as someone is on the ready to sing then the bass kicks in as well. Don't know what source you previously listened to but is was wrong."
