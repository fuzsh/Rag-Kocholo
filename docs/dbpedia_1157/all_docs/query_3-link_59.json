        "text": "With the passing this week of David Crosby, a founding member of both The Byrds with Roger McGuinn (“Mr. Tambourine” and “Turn, Turn, Turn”) and Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, below is an encore of an earlier post for the latter band.\n\nYou, who are on the road, must have a code, that you can live by.\n\nAnd so, become yourself, because the past, is just a good-bye.\n\nTeach, your children well, their father’s hell, did slowly go by.\n\nAnd feed, them on your dreams, the one they picked, the one you’re known by.\n\nDon’t you ever ask them why, if they told you you would cry,\n\nSo just look at them and sigh, and know they love you.\n\nThe lyrics of “Teach Your Children” are highly representative of the songs of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young. I was torn with leading off with a number of their songs, yet I chose this one as the song starts with teaching our children to seek their dreams and letting them go with your guidance and love. The song is even more profound today, as it concludes with a stanza on “teaching your parents well.” With technology so rapidly expanding and changing our world, the song is emblematic that we can learn from each other.\n\nDavid Crosby, Stephen Stills, Graham Nash and later Neil Young formed a group of songwriters and singers who wrote and sang eloquently. Their harmonies made great songs even better. I have an entire post devoted to Young, so I will not highlight some of his many contributions, but let you take a peek at your leisure with this link: https://musingsofanoldfart.wordpress.com/2013/03/30/heart-of-gold-a-tribute-to-neil-young/. Young added guitar-might to the stage presence of the initial trio and had played earlier with Stills in Buffalo Springfield. Crosby was a key part of The Byrds and Nash was with The Hollies. So, CSN and then CSNY became a blend of some prolific musicians and songwriters.\n\nLIke earlier posts, I will leave off some of mine and others’ favorite songs. My intention is to highlight a few songs that resonate with me and leave others for your perusal. If you have not dived into CSNY, I would encourage you to do so. Many of their lyrics will be apropos today, like those in the above song. One that is hauntingly compelling and so simple is a lament over those who pay the ultimate price fighting wars in the name of freedom. From Nash’s “Find the Cost of Freedom” here is only a small taste:\n\nFind the cost of freedom\n\nBuried in the ground\n\nMother Earth will swallow you\n\nLay your body down\n\nI started to quote more lyrics, but I thought these words state the obvious very succinctly and could be used easily to describe those honorable, young men and women who died in Afghanistan and Iraq for uncertain ends. To me, the next song can be used for multiple separations from those you love, but I interpreted it along the above lines of someone going off to fight a war. I will let you judge from the sample lyrics from “Just a Song Before I Go:”\n\nShe helped me with my suitcase,\n\nShe stands before my eyes\n\nDriving me to the airport,\n\nAnd to the friendly skies.\n\nGoing through security\n\nI held her for so long.\n\nShe finally looked at me in love,\n\nAnd she was gone.\n\nThey have so many great songs: “Suite: Judy Blue Eyes” which is a tongue-in-cheek tribute to Judy Collins, “Our House” which even our kids know word for word, “Deja-vu”, “Helplessly Hoping,” Helpless,” “Southern Cross,” “Marrakesh Express” and “Guinevere” are just a few. I also won’t highlight “Ohio” which I did in the earlier post about Young. It needed its own space as it spoke volumes against President Nixon who called out the national guard on US college students at Kent State and a couple of kids got shot. This was a stain on Nixon before his Watergate Waterloo.\n\nAnother favorite is “Wooden Ships” as it is a great tune with great lyrics written by Crosby and Stills:\n\nWooden ships on the water, very free and easy,\n\nEasy, you know the way it’s supposed to be,\n\nSilver people on the shoreline, let us be,\n\nTalkin’ ’bout very free and easy…\n\nHorror grips us as we watch you die,\n\nAll we can do is echo your anguished cries,\n\nStare as all human feelings die,\n\nWe are leaving – you don’t need us.\n\nTo me, these words say go live your life and pursue your dreams. Don’t stand by and watch life pass you by. Don’t save it for later, so take time to explore and you will learn something about yourself. Otherwise, you may be on the shore waiting to die. This same theme is picked up by Nash’s song “Wasted on the Way:”\n\nAnd there’s so much time to make up\n\nEverywhere you turn\n\nTime we have wasted on the way\n\nOh when you were young\n\nDid you question all the answers\n\nDid you envy all the dancers\n\nWho had all the nerve\n\nLook round you NOW\n\nYou must go for what you wanted\n\nLook at all my friends who did and got what they deserved.\n\nThere is so much more to write about Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young. I would love to see newer artists start covering their play list more. Their songs need to be heard by more people. Let me close, with their most iconic song “Woodstock” which was written by Joni Mitchell, Nash’s girlfriend, another great songwriter:\n\nWell, then can I roam beside you? I have come to lose the smog.\n\nAnd I feel myself a cog in something turning.\n\nAnd maybe it’s the time of year, yes, said maybe it’s the time of man.\n\nAnd I don’t know who I am, but life is for learning.\n\nWe are stardust, we are golden, we are billion year old carbon,\n\nAnd we got to get ourselves back to the garden.\n\n“I don’t know who I am, but life is for learning.” These are profound words. I have tried to teach my children this. Never stop learning. I often say you can judge people’s intelligence by their awareness of how much they don’t know. And, getting back to the theme, even old farts like me, learn something new everyday. So, teach your parents well. Thanks guys for the journey which has not stopped.\n\nCrosby, Stills and Nash sang:\n\n“Just a song before I go\n\nTo whom it may concern\n\nTraveling twice the speed of sound\n\nIt’s easy to get burned”\n\nSimon and Grafunkel added:\n\n“Slow down, you move too fast\n\nYou got to make the morning last\n\nJust kicking down the cobble stones\n\nLooking for fun and feelin’ groovy”\n\nIn our 24 x 7 world of social media and pseudo and real news sources that tell us what to think, everything seems like a problem of urgency. Isn’t this horrible and we must act? Part of this is very real, as in this big world, something bad is happening somewhere. Since “if it bleeds, it leads” or is there is conflict between sparring legislators, it makes the news.\n\nGood news stories do get reported, but in inverse proportion to their occurrence. The good news stories are far more common and everyday, but are not deemed newsworthy. I recall a silly example on a music show called “Where are they now?” which usually highlights a band that had success, then fell apart. They filmed one on the group Kansas, but it never aired. Why? The band members were all living normal lives, so it was not titillating.\n\nYet, the other part of these pervasive bad news stories, which can be tragic and dispiriting, is the news that needs to be talked about, but does not get much coverage. Here are a few.\n\nWe have a global fresh water problem that is only being made worse by climate change.\n\nThat climate change problem is no longer a future event – it is brandishing its fangs now with more wildfires, droughts and stalled weather patterns, along with more intense hurricanes and tornados.\n\nOn the good news side, renewable energy is growing at a rapid rate now that cost of production is economical and fossil fuel companies are being held more to account by shareholders and judges..\n\nThere is a poverty and hunger problem in the US and abroad. Too many Americans go to bed hungry. Too many Americans live beneath or at paycheck to paycheck.\n\nThe US has a huge debt and deficit burden that was already bad before the pandemic relief and tax cuts – now it is far worse, with interest cost becoming an increasing part of the budget.\n\nThese issues don’t get talked about enough. Even on the better news stations, the focus is way too much on which political party benefits from an issue. The issue itself gets less reporting than who benefits. In fact, wedge issues are seized to beat the other party over the head with, even if the problem has been around for years. I have long grown weary of problems not being addressed, because of optics. Do something.\n\nBut, back to CS&N and Simon and Garfunkel, let’s also balance all of this with the good stuff that is going on every day. I recognize there are too many folks that are wound way too tight. They seem looking for a fight if some thing or some person makes them do something. Get over it. The world does not revolve around you. If you have to wear a mask to get in some place, then you know what you need to do.\n\nYet, we should endeavor to leave all of our encounters on a better footing. Somewhere in some book I read, some guy called this rule golden. Something like treat others like you want to be treated. Now, that is something to evangelize.\n\nYou, who are on the road, must have a code, that you can live by.\n\nAnd so, become yourself, because the past, is just a good-bye.\n\nTeach, your children well, their father’s hell, did slowly go by.\n\nAnd feed, them on your dreams, the one they picked, the one you’re known by.\n\nDon’t you ever ask them why, if they told you you would cry,\n\nSo just look at them and sigh, and know they love you.\n\nThe lyrics of “Teach Your Children” are highly representative of the songs of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young.
