        "text": "\"Your Song Saved My Life\" - U2\n\nSingle\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n\"Your Song Saved My Life\" (Single Version) - U2 (03:30)\n\nBackground Information\n\nU2’s “Your Song Saved My Life” is a single taken from the soundtrack to the animated film, Sing 2. The song plays over the end credits in the film. The song was officially announced on November 1, 2021, after a week of teases on social media by U2. The single was released digitally on November 3, 2021, and at this time no physical release has been announced. The song will be included on the soundtrack to Sing 2, which is due to be released on December 17, 2021. The film opens on December 22, 2021 in North America, and at various dates around the world.\n\nThe song had it’s worldwide debut on radio via BBC Radio 2, where Jo Whiley played the song at the end of her Shiny Happy Playlist. As the final notes were playing on BBC, the song was made available on streaming services, digital storefronts, and also sent out for promotion at radio.\n\nBono’s involvement in the film was announced on December 21, 2020. He voices a character by the name of Clay Calloway, a retired rock star in the film. Speaking of the choice to play the character Bono said, “Clay Calloway is quite the character. I like to think I was part of his construction. Garth Jennings asked me about singing and where it came from. I surprised myself and him by answering with a line that would make it into the film: ‘Some people sing for a living, some people sing to survive.‘”Clay Calloway is a lion who lost his roar. A singer who lost his reason to sing when he lost his muse. A retired, reclusive rockstar with a big shaggy mane and low-frequency rumble of a grumble. He’s also got guns on his property…paintball guns…and a mixed relationship with his fans.”\n\nU2’s involvement in the movie also includes giving permission for some of their songs to be used elsewhere in the film. Including a performance of “I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For” by Scarlett Johannson’s character Ash. Bono will sing the song with Johannson on the soundtrack and in the film. The cast of the film will also sing “Stuck in a Moment You Can’t Get Out Of” and “Where the Streets Have No Name” but Bono will not be present on those songs.\n\nThe film was originally planned for a December 2020 release, but was pushed back to July 2021, and later December 2021 due to issues related to COVID-19. It is expected that Bono’s vocals for the film were recorded pre-pandemic.\n\nLiner Notes\n\nYour Song Saved My Life (Single Version):\n\nMusic by U2.
