        "text": "STILLWATER, OKLAHOMA SONGWRITER AND STORYTELLER BUILDS PASSIONATE GRASS ROOTS FOLLOWING VIA SOLD OUT SHOWS AND STREAMING SUCCESS\n\nMORE THAN 30 U.S. TOUR DATES SET FOR SUMMER AND FALL\n\n(July 14, 2023 – New York, NY) Wyatt Flores, native son of Stillwater, Oklahoma, announces his signing to Island Records alongside OEG Management, and the arrival of new single “Holes” today. With a loyal grass roots Country-Americana following, Wyatt is building momentum, releasing 9 independent singles over the past two years. “Holes” is his first release via Island Records.\n\nDrawing influence from country, rock, folk, pop and bluegrass, the Mexican-American artist is redefining the cultural landscape for the songwriter and storyteller. He tells his stories in his own way, craving authenticity in his lyrics, collaboration, and sound. Written for his family, “Holes” beautifully tells a story of the ‘cycle of poverty’ prominent in family folklore. The artwork is inspired by a family photo taken on the steps of his family's mobile home.\n\nWyatt was raised on the outskirts of Stillwater, Oklahoma, a deep-rooted, homegrown culture that encompasses fellow Oklahoma stalwarts Garth Brooks, All American Rejects, and Cross Canadian Ragweed. Inspired by stories from his father’s stint as a drummer in the Red Dirt music scene, and the energy of Stillwater itself, Wyatt started singing around campfires before trying his luck in saloons throughout northeast Oklahoma. In the summer of 2022, he moved to Nashville to pursue music full-time. Wyatt tapped a vein with the release of “Losing Sleep” in February of 2022 and “Please Don’t Go” which has generated over 50 million streams across DSPs.\n\nNow, with the release of “Holes,” Wyatt is working hard as ever on the road through the summer and early fall. His next major round of more than 30 U.S. tour dates kicked off July 13th at El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles (see full routing below). Although his touring career is just beginning, he's already headlined sold-out shows in Oklahoma City, OK, Asheville, NC, and Huntsville, TX, with festivals intertwined. Merchandise lines and fan interaction after his shows have been known to last three hours, resulting in sold-out merch. Rooted in sincere dedication to his fans, Wyatt has resourcefully resorted to selling his own wardrobe with his signature – and a thank you note.\n\nFor more, visit: www.wyattfloresmusic.com\n\nFOLLOW WYATT FLORES"
