        "text": "MANILA, PHILIPPINES — Zild is now part of Island Records Philippines. As a singer, songwriter, and producer, Zild’s creativity, musical craftsmanship, and collaborative spirit have made him a powerful force in the music scene. Being part of the Universal Music Group, the world’s biggest record company, which includes Republic Records, Island Records, and Def Jam will amplify his distinct artistic voice to a much wider audience than before\n\nHis first single under the label, “Isang Anghel,” is due to drop on August 11.\n\nZild (Daniel Zildjan Garon Benitez) began his musical career as a member of the indie-pop group IV of Spades. The band was formed in 2014 with Zild as the Vocalist, Bassist, Songwriter, and Producer. Their first single “Ilaw Sa Daan” was released in 2016 and was followed by a few more single releases “Hey Barbara” (2017), “Where Have You Been My Disco?” (2017), and “Mundo” (2018). In January 2019, the band released their first album “ClapClapClap!”\n\nThe band received countless awards such as 2018 MYX Music Awards “New Artist of the Year,” 2019 Awit Awards “Album of the Year” for the album “ClapClapClap!” 2020 Wish Music Awards “Group of the Year,” and many more. They also have consistently played in concert stages locally and overseas throughout the years, including Clockenflap Festival (2018), US Tour (2019), and Japan Tour (2020).\n\nOn June 12, 2020, Zild released his first solo song “Sinungaling.”\n\nIn the midst of a Pandemic and self-isolation without his comfort zone by being in a band, on August 06, 2020, he released his 10-song solo masterpiece titled “Homework Machine”. The year after he released his second solo album on April 8, 2021 “Huminga” containing 10 songs which included the hits “Kyusi” and “Huminga” among many others.\n\nZild says that he hopes to continue the DIY spirit that guided his past work, adding that Island can provide him a “megaphone” to help get his music out and to amplify his creative voice to reach more people. In addition, with Island’s resources and the community of musicians on its roster, he hopes to grow as an artist through future projects, including collaborative ones. While he is somewhat anxious about working with more collaborators after years of doing it himself, he also finds it exciting.\n\nAs Island Records Philippines welcomes him to the family, people can look forward to more exciting work from this talented young musician, particularly his upcoming third album. Zild is proof of how Philippine music continues to thrive and grow through a new generation of talent, and UMG Philippines continues to build our music community by amplifying their voices."
