        "text": "Record label discography\n\nThe history and the discography of the Island Records label can conveniently be divided into three phases:\n\nThe Jamaican Years, covering the label's releases from 1959 to 1966\n\nThe New Ground Years, covering 1967 to approximately 1980.\n\nThe Consolidation Years, covering 1980 onwards. In 1989, Chris Blackwell sold Island Records to PolyGram, resulting in a remarketing of the Island back catalogue on compact disc under the Island Masters brand.\n\nBlackwell released 28 singles and three LPs in this period.\n\nThe very first records have been issued on 7\" sides in Jamaica on a label called R&B\n\nLaurel Aitken: \"Boogie In My Bones\"\n\nErnest Ranglin: \"Wranglin'\"\n\nLord Lebby With The Caribs: \"Caldonie\"\n\nCB stands for Chris Blackwell; 22 for the age of Blackwell at the time; it is the first number of the LP catalogue.\n\nCB21 - Lance Hayward: Lance Hayward at the Half Moon Hotel\n\nCB22 - Lance Hayward: Lance Hayward at the Half Moon Hotel, Volume 2\n\nCB23 - Ernest Ranglin: Guitar In Ernest\n\nCBLP24 - Owen Gray: Sings\n\nAfter the company's start in London in 1962 Island Records diversified already in 1963 into various labels: Black Swan, Island, Sue and Jump Up.\n\nThe first Island \"white and red\" label was used mainly for Jamaican productions released in the United Kingdom. Catalogue numbers started at WI-001. Many of these records had been released previously in Jamaica and other territories on small local labels. For a variety of reasons details of the artists and songs printed on the labels do not always match what is actually to be found in the grooves of the record! The main Island label was soon joined by another three labels: Sue for black American music with catalogue numbers starting at WI-300, Black Swan for more Jamaican music starting with WI-400, and Jump Up, for Calypso and Trinidadian music, starting with 500, but using another prefix (JU). The Aladdin label was started in about 1965 and used numbers starting with 600, using the WI prefix.\n\nIsland singles were released with prefix WI and numbers starting with 001. The Island label itself was white with red lettering and logotypes - for the first 100 releases it had a round \"Flaming sun\" logo on a white label, then and for reprints of the early issues a red strip across the centre of the label like a \"bow tie\". The labels have the Rutland Gate Mews address on all first pressings up until about number 14; this was followed by the London England address which goes up to at least # 47, then came Cambridge Road.\n\n(N.B. This discography has been expanded and corrected using the published discography in \"Record Collector\" magazine 201, published May 1996. Details can also be checked online, at the \"45cat\" database,[1] which contains many label scans. As far as possible, the listings below reflect what is actually written on the record label.

The releases followed the catalogue numbers of Island's singles starting at number 300. The first 17 releases of the British Sue label were in fact related to Henry 'Juggy' Murray's New York based Sue label. Some earlier issues from the black-owned independent American label established in 1957 were released on the London American label. The original Island agreement with the American company ended in disagreement and all (U.S.) Sue records were deleted from their catalogue in July 1965, and American Sue issues returned to the London American label. Island records retained the use of the name Sue until the final release in 1968.\n\nWI 301 - Inez Foxx: \"Mockingbird\" / \"He's The One You Love\"\n\nWI 308 - Derak Martin: \"Don't Put Me Down Like This\"\n\nWI 309 - Ernestine Anderson: \"Keep An Eye On Love\"\n\nWI 312 - The Soul Sisters: \"I Can't Stand It\"\n\nWI 323 - Inez Foxx: \"Hurt by Love\" (UK #40, July 1964)[4]\n\nWI 335 - Elmore James: \"Dust My Blues\"\n\nWI 337 - Louisiana Red: \"I Done Woke Up\"\n\nWI 339 - J.B.

It coincided with the introduction of a new pink label design (chosen, according to label founder and owner Chris Blackwell, \"because it created a clear break from our Jamaican years\") and the \"P\" in WIP is variously said to stand for \"Pink\" or \"Progressive\",[7] reflecting the fact that this new series was geared towards the new generation of rock/pop acts that Island had begun to accumulate from early 1967 onwards, as well as artists from its traditional roster who were being oriented towards the rock/pop audience, such as Jackie Edwards and Jimmy Cliff. Another change was that releases in the WIP series were normally stereo productions. Major UK top twenty singles' chart success for the label came very early in the WIP series, with WIP-6002 - Traffic's \"Paper Sun\" (#5, 6/1967),[4] a classic slice of British psychedelia released just in time for the \"summer of love\", but quite a high proportion of the early WIP-series output was by artists who failed to develop as anticipated (e.g. Hard Meat, The Smoke) or represented one-off licensing deals with artists who never again appeared in the Island listings (e.g. WIP-6001, WIP-6013, etc.). The series continued throughout the 1970s and into the early 1980s (see below).\n\nThe first of a series of pink label designs was used for singles WIP-6000 to WIP-6051, inclusive. Sometimes referred to as the \"eye\" label design, it featured an orange and black elliptical device on the left-hand side of the label which could be said to resemble a grotesque eyeball when viewed sideways. \"A\" and \"B\" sides were clearly delineated on this early series of pink label singles, thus: WIP-6050-A (Traffic's \"Medicated Goo\") and WIP-6050-B (the same band's \"Shanghai Noodle Factory\").\n\nBeginning with WIP-6052, a new series of matrix numbers was introduced for 7\" singles. Henceforward, singles' sides were not usually identified as \"A\" or \"B\", but each bore a unique matrix number in a series starting at wipx 1002.[8] The matrix number appeared on the label, usually upside-down directly beneath the main catalogue number. The matrix numbers seem to have been allocated to each release in numerical sequence, irrespective of the actual or proposed release date of the record; thus the two sides of WIP-6056 (Jethro Tull's \"Living In The Past\" b/w \"Driving Song\") have matrix numbers wipx 1010 and wipx 1011, respectively. Initially, the new matrix numbers were used in conjunction with the existing \"eye\" label design, but beginning with releases in June 1969 a new pink label design was introduced, known as the \"block\" design. The new design continued to feature the \"eye\" device in plain black enclosed within the push-out centre of the record, but the company name was now written in capital letters within a rectangular black block in the lower part of the label. The first release to feature the new label design appears to have been WIP-6060 and the last to feature the orange-and-black \"eye\" design WIP-6061, a reissue of \"Incense\" by the Anglos, which had actually been released the previous month. One or two earlier releases which were evidently still selling were re-pressed with the new design (e.g. WIP-6056, which exists with both the orange-and-black \"eye\" and the \"block\" label designs).\n\nTowards the end of 1969, artists signed to Terry Ellis and Chris Wright's Chrysalis management company began to be favoured with a special Chrysalis label design - green with a red Chrysalis butterfly logo. Initially this applied to Jethro Tull and former Tull guitarist Mick Abrahams' band Blodwyn Pig. These early Chrysalis singles were allotted catalogue and matrix numbers in the main Island WIP and wipx series, respectively, and bore the legend \"manufactured and distributed by island records basing st london\" on the upper circumference of the label. Chrysalis continued to issue singles bearing Island catalogue numbers until Autumn 1971, after which the label broke away completely and began its own series of catalogue numbers in a CHS 2000 series.\n\nWIP-6000 - Owen Gray: \"Help Me\" b/w \"Incense\", 14/1/1967[1]\n\nWIP-6001 - Rene & Rene: \"Loving You Could Hurt Me So Much\" b/w \"Little Diamonds\", 14/1/1967[1][9]\n\nWIP-6002 - Traffic: \"Paper Sun\" b/w \"Giving to You\", 5/1967 (UK #5, June 1967)[4]\n\nWIP-6003 - Ray Cameron: \"Doing My Time\" b/w \"Getaway, Getaway Car\", 1/1967\n\nWIP-6004 - Jimmy Cliff: \"Give and Take\" b/w \"Aim And Ambition\", 2/1967\n\nWIP-6005 - The V.I.P.'s: \"Straight Down To The Bottom\" b/w \"In A Dream\", 2/1967\n\nWIP-6006 - Wynder K Frog: \"Green Door\" b/w \"Dancing Frog\", 2/1967\n\nWIP-6007 - Tim Tam and the Turn-Ons: \"Wait A Minute\" b/w \"Ophelia\", 4/1967\n\nWIP-6008 - Jackie Edwards: \"Come Back Girl\" b/w \"Tell Him You Lied\", 4/1967\n\nWIP-6009 - Julien Covey and the Machine: \"A Little Bit Hurt\" b/w \"Sweet Bacon\", 4/1967\n\nWIP-6010 - Joyce Bond: \"Do The Teasy\" b/w \"Sugar\", 4/1967\n\nWIP-6011 - Jimmy Cliff: \"I Got A Feeling\" b/w \"Hard Road To Travel\", 5/1967\n\nWIP-6012 - Jackie and Millie: \"In a Dream\" b/w \"Ooh, Ooh\", 6/1967\n\nWIP-6013 - The Bill Shepherd Sound: \"Whistling Sailor\" b/w \"March of the Seven Seas\", 1967\n\nWIP-6014 - Wynder K Frog: \"I'm A Man\" b/w \"Shook Shimmy And Shake\", 6/1967\n\nWIP-6016 - Nirvana: \"Tiny Goddess\" b/w \"I Believe in Magic\", 7/1967\n\nWIP-6017 - Traffic: \"Hole in My Shoe\" b/w \"Smiling Phases\", 8/1967 (early issues in picture sleeve;

Some records were issued in both forms. For those records in stereo, the catalogue number was changed by adding a fourth figure (e.g.: ILP 970 was the mono equivalent of ILPS 9070).\n\nILP 901 - Keith and Enid: Keith and Enid Sing, 1964\n\nthe above was the only Island LP released with a black and silver 'flaming sun' label.

It is known as the 'black block' label, as it featured a thick, block-like letter i at the bottom, dotted by a black eyeball in the centre of the label. This was very quickly replaced by the third pink label, featuring a small white letter i logo. Due to variations in catalogue number assignation and the actual release dates of the records, there is a small cross-over period between the three pink label designs. The original label designs for the following LPs are detailed in parentheses.\n\nILPS 9102 - Fairport Convention: Unhalfbricking, 1969 (black block label)\n\nILPS 9103 - Jethro Tull: Stand Up, 1969 (eyeball label)\n\nILPS 9104 - Free: Free, 1969 (white i label)\n\nILPS 9105 - Nick Drake: Five Leaves Left, 1969 (black block label)\n\nILPS 9106 - Dr. Strangely Strange: \"Kip of the Serenes\", 1969 (eyeball label)\n\nAll following LPs were originally issued on the third pink label, with 'white i' logo.\n\nILPS 9107 - Spooky Tooth: Ceremony, 1969\n\nILPS 9108 - Mott the Hoople: Mott the Hoople, 1969\n\nILPS 9109 - V.A.: British Blues Adventures Vol.2, 1969 (France Only)\n\nILPS 9110 Q- Quintessence: In Blissful Company, 1969\n\nILPS 9111 - King Crimson: In the Court of the Crimson King, 1969\n\nILPS 9112 - Traffic: Best of Traffic, 1969\n\nILPS 9113 - John & Beverley Martyn: Stormbringer!, 1970\n\nILPS 9114 - Renaissance: Renaissance, 1969\n\nILPS 9115 - Fairport Convention: Liege & Lief, 1969\n\nDuring the same period Island Records released some sampler albums with the prefixes IWP/IWPS:\n\nIWPS 2 - You Can All Join In, 1968\n\nIWP 3 - This Is Sue\n\nIWPS 4 - Jackie Edwards - Put Your Tears Away\n\nIWP 5 - This Is Blues\n\nIWPS 6 - Nice Enough To Eat, 1969\n\nThe first release in 1970, WIP-6075, had the \"block\" label design, but the very next one, \"John The Baptist\" by John & Beverley Martyn, featured a third pink label design, characterised by a large white letter \"i\" on the left-hand side. This design was used for the remaining pink label issues, interrupted with increasing frequency by green Chrysalis label releases, as denoted in the listing below. Bronze label singles by artists such as Tony Hazzard and Uriah Heep began to appear in the Island listing from May 1971, for a couple of years until that label's own BRO- series was begun. An American record label, Blue Thumb, also released a small number of UK singles with WIP-series numbers in 1972/3. The one-off catalogue number WI-4002 was given to the flexi-single \"Let There Be Drums\" which came with the album Rock On by The Bunch in 1972.\n\nIn the second half of the decade the character of the label began to change and this is reflected in its singles releases from about 1976 onwards. There was a conscious move back towards the label's roots in Jamaican music in the form of commercial reggae aimed at the rock/pop audience. Names such as Bob Marley & the Wailers, Toots & the Maytals and Third World crop up in the listings with increasing frequency. They and others enjoyed considerable commercial success in the U.K. market. There is evidence too of an increasing number of one-off licensing deals featuring (mainly American) soul and R & B singers (e.g. Barbara Pennington and Betty Davis). Island also joined a growing trend amongst U.K.-based record companies at that time towards exploitation of its own back catalogue,[18] and a substantial programme of reissues was undertaken, especially of ska and reggae titles, most of which seem to have been aimed at a small, specialist audience and did not enjoy widespread commercial success.\n\nAlso in 1976, another American record label, Shelter Records, began to issue U.K. singles through Island, which received WIP-series catalogue numbers. Artists included the Dwight Twilley Band, J.J. Cale and Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, the last-named of whom enjoyed some success on the coat-tails of punk. Finally, the Black Swan label was reactivated for certain reggae-styled releases, some of which appeared with WIP-series numbers.\n\n(N.B.
