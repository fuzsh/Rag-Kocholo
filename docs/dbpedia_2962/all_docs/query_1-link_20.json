        "text": "Robert Palmer was one of the greatest singer-songwriters of the late 20th Century. An artist and writer who sampled world-wide success, he never stopped being a music fan first and foremost, often racing to record something he’d just heard a snatch of on the radio or had caught in a club. His astute mixture of originals and well-selected covers gave him a song palette at times so eclectic that he became impossible to pigeonhole. In many respects, Palmer was the invisible man of pop. His close friends Talking Heads once recorded a track called Seen And Not Seen, the title of which sums up Palmer perfectly.\n\nAfter spells with The Alan Bown! and Dada, and three albums with Vinegar Joe, Island Records signed Robert Palmer to a solo deal in 1973. This 109 track, 9 CD book set contains all nine albums that he recorded for Island Records, between 1974 and 1985, alongside b-sides, demos and alternate takes.\n\nAside from the worldwide hit “Addicted To Love”, the set also contains “Johnny And Mary”, “Bad Case Of Lovin’ You (Doctor Doctor)”, “Looking For Clues”, “Some Guys Have All The Luck” and many more hits, as well as collaborations with Gary Numan. The musicians include The Meters, Little Feat, and the Brecker Brothers and the producers include Tom Moulton and Chic’s Bernard Edwards."
