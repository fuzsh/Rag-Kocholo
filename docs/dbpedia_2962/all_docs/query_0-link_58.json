Fun fact: Kiedis first met bandmate Flea in a driver's ed class where they became best friends while sitting next to each other. In a biography about the band written by Jeff Apter, Kiedis said, \"We were both social outcasts. We found each other, and it turned out to be the longest-lasting friendship of my life.\"\n\nToday In:\n\n1955 - R&B group The Famous Flames, led by singer James Brown, cut their first demo of \"Please, Please, Please\" at a radio station in Macon Georgia.

Rolling Stone later ranked it No. 91 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\n1969 - The Beatles scored their 13th U.S. No. 1 album with Abbey Road. The final studio recordings from the group featured two George Harrison songs; \"Something\" and \"Here Comes The Sun\" plus \"Come Together\" and the two multi-part closing medleys on side two, culminating with \"The End.\" Conspiracy theories about the album cover supposedly containing clues adding to the 'Paul Is Dead' phenomenon included: The car number plate 'LMW 281F' supposedly referred to the fact that McCartney would be 28 if he was still alive. 'LMW' was said to stand for 'Linda McCartney Weeps.' And the four Beatles were said to represent the priest (John, dressed in white), the Undertaker (Ringo, black suit), the Corpse (Paul, barefoot), and the Gravedigger (George, in jeans and a denim shirt).\n\n1970 - The Festfolk Quartet, which later becomes ABBA, played their first-ever concert at a Gothenburg, Sweden restaurant.\n\n1975 - Elton John started a three-week run at No. 1 on the U.S. singles chart with \"Island Girl\", his 5th U.S. No. 1, a No. 14 hit in the U.K.\n\n1980 - Bruce Springsteen scored his first No. 1 U.S. album with \"The River\", featuring the U.S. No. 5 and U.K. No. 44 single \"Hungry Heart\".\n\n1994 - Mariah Carey's album Merry Christmas was released.
