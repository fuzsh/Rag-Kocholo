        "text": "After signing with Republic Records in 2019 and releasing numerous projects on the imprint, rapper Coi Leray has announced that she has inked a new deal with Island Records, releasing a new single to commemorate the moment.\n\nThe 26-year-old initially signed with Republic after stacking up a few indie hits including “By Myself” and “Huddy,” dropping the “EC2” EP to commemorate the moment. As part of her deal with the label, she put out two solo albums—2022’s “Trendsetter” and last year’s “Coi”—while her star continued to ascend. She secured hits including “Blick Blick” and “No More Parties.”\n\nMost recently, the New Jersey native headed into 2024 with a few milestones under her belt. She’s currently gearing up for the Grammy Awards, with a nomination for her track “Players” in the best rap performance category as well as another for her feature on David Guetta’s “Baby Don’t Hurt Me” alongside Anne-Marie in the best pop dance recording category.\n\nTo commemorate signing with Island, she unveiled her latest track “Wanna Come Thru,” produced by Mike Will Made It. She explains that the song marks a new beginning for her, and a promising 2024 that lies ahead. “This song is about me on my grown and sexy,” she explains. “Grown and sexy means being so in love with yourself — that it is one of the most sexiest, maturest, grownest things that a woman can do. As you get older and you tap into your womanhood and your femininity and I feel like you should embrace that. It’s feeling good for yourself; looking in the mirror and just loving yourself. 2024 is going to be my grown and sexy era. I’m taking over this year. I’ve got so much new music and a whole new side of me to get to know.”\n\nMike Will Made It, who has produced tracks for everyone from Rae Sremmurd and Kendrick Lamar to Miley Cyrus and Katy Perry, echoed her statement, claiming that “Wanna Come Thru” is just the start of the work he’s put in with Leray. “It’s a culture-shifting record,” he says. “The song is just fresh and forward-pushing. What I love about it is it sounds simple and easy to digest and instantly puts you in a mood. It’s the best feeling ever to be able to create a song that makes the listener feel good. This is hit number one fasho, we have plenty more on the way. The Ear Drummer/Trendsetter Way.”"
