        "text": "New music from ZAYN is expected imminently, and he's been steadily teasing the start of a new era over on his socials. ZAYN's music in the US will now be distributed by Mercury, a relaunched subsidiary of UMG label Republic, home to some of pop's biggest stars, such as Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande.\n\nMusic Week first reported the news.\n\nMORE: See where all of Zayn's singles and albums have charted in the UK\n\nIn a statement, Mercury president Tyler Arnold said of the signing: \"As soon as Zayn and I met, I knew we had to work together.\n\n\"I knew we at Island had to do everything we could to be involved. This is Zayn on top of his game and this next chapter is going to take him to the next level. Working with Nicola and Taryn at ZenKai management has been an absolute pleasure too and we are so excited for the world to hear what's coming!”\n\nZAYN set the world alight when he became the first member to leave One Direction in 2015, and was the first to release solo music. His impassioned, sexy debut single PILLOWTALK was influenced by the likes of Frank Ocean, and debuted at Number 1 on the Official Singles Chart, as did his debut album, Mind of Mine.\n\nZAYN released a further two albums, 2018's ambitious Icarus Falls and 2021's Nobody Is Listening, which reached Number 17.\n\nPillowtalk still remains a high watermark for ex-band members wanting to make a new start, performing a total 180 on his teen idol persona. It still ranks as one of the most successful of the One Direction boys' solo tracks in the UK, too.\n\nKeep your eye on Official Charts for more news on this bold new era for ZAYN."
