        "text": "Bon Jovi was a household name throughout the 1980s and 1990s, monopolizing charts with hits like “You Give Love a Bad Name” and “Livin’ on a Prayer.” Nearly 40 years after their first song went number 1 on the Billboard Top 100, Jon Bon Jovi and his band are back with their single “Legendary,” off their upcoming album “Forever,” to be released on June 7. While certainly a descriptor for the band themselves, this song falls short of deserving its title.\n\n“Legendary” does not begin to compare to anything the band has put out before — which is to be expected for a band that peaked before the turn of the century. Bon Jovi is known for adapting its style to the demands of the period: Music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted how the band “subtly changed their sound” over time. The key to their successfully changing sound is subtlety, and unfortunately this song is anything but a subtle change.\n\nListeners are greeted with the typical raspy, exaggerated voice of lead singer Jon Bon Jovi, something fans of the band are sure to enjoy. The tambourine spices up both choruses, making them feel faster and giving the illusion of a more dynamic song. The bridge is nearly a cappella and the last word of the chorus, “legendary,” is as well, saving the song from being entirely boring. While less audible during the verses, the cymbals, drums, and tambourine build until resetting after the chorus, taking the song’s dynamics further. This ebb and flow of the instruments is basic, and the lyrics do nothing to distinguish “Legendary” from being simply another pop song on the radio.\n\nThe lyrics, while they do tell a nice story, are basic at best and meaningless at worst. The general message seems rather incoherent, with lyrics referring to everything from “Sweet Caroline,” a “brown-eyed girl,” and “bricks on bricks.” In contrast, the lyrics of the popular “You Give Love a Bad Name” read like a narrative, detailing the journey of loving a cunning partner, and those of “Livin’ on a Prayer” tell of a struggling young couple with only their love for each other. The chorus of “Legendary” has Bon Jovi’s usual inspiring tone: “Got what I want ’cause I got what I need / Got a fistful of friends that’ll stand up for me / Right where I am is where I wanna be.” However, the remainder of the lyrics seem metaphorical, referring to arbitrary experiences that do not connect to past songs or albums.\n\nAlternatively, the first four bars sound promising until the chorus chimes in. The guitar chords’ satisfying progression is overwhelmed by repetitive “oh”s, distracting listeners from the enjoyable musicality. Instrumentally, the introduction of a guitar, drumset, and piano sounds like something from the band Coldplay or a Disney soundtrack, not a rock band. Because the guitar is in the background of the other instruments, “Legendary” does not have the same depth as other Bon Jovi songs despite its liveliness.\n\n“Legendary” is an enigma for avid Bon Jovi fans. The song is an easy listen — it is upbeat, catchy, and a great choice for a family barbecue or karaoke night. However, it is a complete change in the band’s sound and is disappointing for those hoping for a new rock anthem. Only time will tell if the same will be true for the album, but for now, “Legendary” is a prime example of the saying “nothing good lasts forever.”"
