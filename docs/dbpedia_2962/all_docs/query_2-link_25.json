However, whether the child takes it to heart is a personal decision. On Avicii’s song “The Nights,” he stresses how his father told him to enjoy life because one may always desire better days. “He said, ‘One day you’ll leave this world behind / So live a life you will remember,'\" he sings. \"My father told me when I was just a child / These are the nights that never die.”\n\n16 of 20\n\n“Golden” by Jill Scott\n\nLeon Bennett/Getty Images for BET\n\nThe color gold is a symbol of different things — prosperity, wealth, success, and triumph.

In the first verse, she says, “No time for moping around, are you kidding? / And no time for negative vibes, ‘cause I’m winning / It’s been a long week / I put in my hardest / Gonna live my life, feels so good to get it right.”\n\n19 of 20\n\n“The Other Side” by SZA and Justin Timberlake\n\nTim Mosenfelder/Getty Images\n\nAs people grow older, it’s second nature to compare themselves to someone else, especially when that other person seems to be living a much sweeter life. SZA and Justin Timberlake teamed up on the motivational track “The Other Side,” which encourages listeners to continue running their own race because “the grass ain’t always greener on the other side.”\n\n20 of 20\n\n“Sunday Best\" by Surfaces\n\nJosh Brasted/FilmMagic\n\nNobody is a master of life, and everyone is trying to figure it out.
