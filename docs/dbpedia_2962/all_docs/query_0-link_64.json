        "text": "It′s empty in the valley of your heart\n\nThe sun, it rises slowly as you walk\n\nAway from all the fears\n\nAnd all the faults you've left behind\n\nThe harvest left no food for you to eat\n\nYou cannibal, you meat-eater, you see\n\nBut I have seen the same\n\nI know the shame in your defeat\n\nBut I will hold on hope\n\nAnd I won′t let you choke\n\nOn the noose around your neck\n\nAnd I'll find strength in pain\n\nAnd I will change my ways\n\nI'll know my name as it′s called again\n\n′Cause I have other things to fill my time\n\nYou take what is yours and I'll take mine\n\nNow let me at the truth\n\nWhich will refresh my broken mind\n\nSo tie me to a post and block my ears\n\nI can see widows and orphans through my tears\n\nI know my call despite my faults\n\nAnd despite my growing fears\n\nBut I will hold on hope\n\nAnd I won′t let you choke\n\nOn the noose around your neck\n\nAnd I'll find strength in pain\n\nAnd I will change my ways\n\nI′ll know my name as it's called again\n\nSo come out of your cave walking on your hands\n\nAnd see the world hanging upside down\n\nYou can understand dependence\n\nWhen you know the maker′s land\n\nSo make your siren's call\n\nAnd sing all you want\n\nI will not hear what you have to say\n\n'Cause I need freedom now\n\nAnd I need to know how\n\nTo live my life as it′s meant to be\n\nAnd I will hold on hope\n\nAnd I won′t let you choke\n\nOn the noose around your neck\n\nAnd I'll find strength in pain\n\nAnd I will change my ways\n\nI′ll know my name as it's called again\n\nWriter(s): Marcus Oliver Johnstone Mumford, Benjamin Walter David Lovett, Edward James Milton Dwane, Winston Aubrey Aladar Marshall<br>Lyrics powered by www.musixmatch.com"
