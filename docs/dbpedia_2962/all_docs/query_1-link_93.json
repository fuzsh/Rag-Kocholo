        "text": "After a two year stand-off with her previous label Def Jam, Aussie expatriate Iggy Azalea has revived her recording career.\n\nShe has signed with Island Records, and released a new single ‘Savior’ featuring Quavo of Migos – which is the source of speculation that it secretly involved writer and producer Dr. Luke.\n\nIsland and her previous label Def Jam Recordings are both part of Universal Music Group.\n\nAccording to a now-deleted tweet by Azalea last July, the feud with Def Jam began after its then-CEO Steve Bartels refused to release any more singles from her second album Digital Distortion after the first few failed to set the charts on fire.\n\nShe wrote, “I’m very unhappy with the way things have been handled too. I will make sure it’s not this way for ia3… I can assure you guys of that.”\n\nBartels stepped down as CEO at the end of 2017.\n\nAzalea joined Def Jam after a difference of opinion with executives of another Universal Music Group label Interscope.\n\nWhile it’ll be interesting to see if ‘Savior’ revives her recording career, social media buzz is over the identity of her collaborator on the song, ‘Manhun Glow’.\n\nSpotify and Tidal who now add songwriting and producer credits on their song data, revealed that Lukasz Gottwald is mentioned.\n\nGottwald is Dr Luke, the alleged tormentor of Kesha who fought to get out of her deal with him and with Sony.\n\nAzalea responded that the song was produced by two people—Cirkut and MHL—who have “production agreements with Luke,” but that she and Gottwald did not work together.\n\nShe has said ‘Savior’ is “pretty personal” and that she wrote it in a “really heavy period in my life.”"
