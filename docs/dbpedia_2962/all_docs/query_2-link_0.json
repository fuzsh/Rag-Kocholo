        "text": "1983 single by Grace Jones\n\n\"Living My Life\" is a Grace Jones song released as a single in 1983.\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nThe track was originally recorded for the album of the same name, but for unknown reasons (most likely that the pop-oriented record did not fit the overall reggae sound of the album) it did not make the final cut. It received a scarce 1983 release as a UK white label single and was officially released only in Portugal. Jones, however, performed the track on several TV shows. A remixed version was released as the B-side to the UK reissue single of \"Love Is the Drug\" in 1986. The original and dub versions are yet to be reissued on CD.\n\nMusic video\n\n[edit]\n\nThe music video for the song was directed by Jean-Paul Goude and famously includes the \"suicide\" scene, with Grace blowing her brains out.[1] Excerpts from the \"Living My Life\" video were used in the \"Slave to the Rhythm\" clip. The music video for \"Living My Life\" was also included in Jones' concert film, A One Man Show.\n\nTrack listing\n\n[edit]\n\n12\" single (1983)\n\nA. \"Living My Life\" – 7:34\n\nB. \"Living My Life\" (Dub) – 4:15\n\n12\" promotional single (1983)\n\nA. \"Living My Life\" – 7:34\n\nB. \"Living My Life\" – 7:34"
