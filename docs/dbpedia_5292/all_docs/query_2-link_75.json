        "text": "Finns are in the final stages of releasing their new album ‘Survive\n\nBy Luiz Athayde\n\nFinnish band Stratovarius has shared the fourth single from their upcoming album Survive, scheduled to come out of the oven on September 23 via earMUSIC stamp.\n\n“Frozen in Time” arrives a few weeks after “Firefly” and features a far from fictional theme, quite the contrary. “It’s the only song on the album that is inspired by historical events. It’s about what happened in Pompeii. A tragic volcanic eruption,” says vocalist Timo Kotipelto.\n\nThe Roman city, located in what is now the city of Naples, became known for being the scene of the eruption of the volcano Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD, which, according to a study, killed practically the entire population in 17 minutes. Lava and ash were spewed up to 20 kilometers from its slopes. The few survivors remained in communities on the southern coast of Italy.\n\nAs for the sonic approach, he couldn’t have been more direct: “It’s epic power metal music.” Pudera. A specialty of the Finnish band formed way back in 1985, the new track further strengthens the lineup that has been stable since 2012 with the classic era members, Kotipelto, and keyboardist Jens Johansson, plus bassist Lauri Porra, since 2005; guitarist Matias Kupiainen, who joined the group in 2008, and Rolf Pilve, who has owned the drumsticks for 10 years.\n\nThe Helsinki brigade hadn’t issued a full-length album since 2015’s Eternal, and also because of this, expectations are high, given the consistency of the songs shared so far, staying true to melodic metal, but bringing in new elements.\n\nSurvive is available on pre-order in CD and double vinyl formats in the colors: black, violet and blue.
