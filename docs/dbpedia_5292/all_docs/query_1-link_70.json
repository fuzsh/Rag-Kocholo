        "text": "In the new video message below, Timo Kotipelto and Jens Johansson of Finnish melodic metal brigade STRATOVARIUS talk about the band's new studio album, coming in 2013. The footage was filmed in Hamburg in front of the earMUSIC / Edel building in August:\n\nThe news of drummer Jörg Michael's departure from Stratovarius in September 2011 was a shock for all of the band's fans. To say goodbye to a friend, hero and member who characterized Stratovarius' sound for over a decade, the group embarked on a five-show farewell tour of Finland in November of last year. Stratovarius have released a two-hour 2-CD/DVD set filmed and recorded in Tampere, Finland on November 19, 2011. This is one of the very last shows the band played with Michael.\n\nReleased in North America via Eagle Rock imprint Armoury Records, Under Flaming Winter Skies - Live In Tampere, which entered the Music DVD chart in Finland at position # upon its first week of release overseas, marks the end of an era as well as a new beginning. Hits and classics like 'Under Flaming Skies', 'Speed Of Light' and 'Hunting High And Low' as well as exclusive bonus material (30-minute documentary about the band's history, exclusive interviews with each member as well as a special comment from Jörg Michael regarding reasons for his departure) makes it a must-have for every fan and a real collector's item not to be missed.\n\nCheck out the DVD trailer as well as a 'Black Diamond' performance clip:\n\nUnder Flaming Winter Skies - Live In Tampere Tracklisting:\n\nCD 1\n\n'Under Flaming Skies'\n\n'I Walk To My Own Song'\n\n'Speed Of Light'\n\n'Kiss Of Judas'\n\n'Deep Unknown'\n\nGuitar Solo\n\n'Eagleheart'\n\n'Paradise'\n\n'Visions'\n\nBass Solo\n\n'Coming Home'\n\nCD 2\n\n'Legions Of The Twilight'\n\n'Darkest Hours'\n\n'Burn'\n\n'Behind Blue Eyes'\n\n'Winter Skies'\n\nKeyboard Solo\n\n'Black Diamond'\n\n'Father Time'\n\n'Hunting High And Low'\n\nDVD\n\n'Intro'\n\n'Under Flaming Skies'\n\n'I Walk To My Own Song'\n\n'Speed Of Light'\n\n'Kiss Of Judas'\n\n'Deep Unknown'\n\nGuitar Solo\n\n'Eagleheart'\n\n'Paradise'\n\n'Visions'\n\nBass Solo\n\n'Coming Home'\n\n'Legions Of The Twillight'\n\n'Darkest Hours'\n\nJörg Speech\n\n'Burn'\n\n'Behind Blue Eyes'\n\n'Winter Skies'\n\nKeyboard Solo\n\n'Black Diamond'\n\n'Father Time'\n\n'Hunting High And Low'"
