        "text": "Finnish/Swedish melodic metallers STRATOVARIUS have finished mastering their new album at Finnvox studio in Helsinki, Finland with Mika Jussila(NIGHTWISH, AMORPHIS, SENTENCED). According to the band, the follow-up to 2011’s “Elysium” “sounds awesome!” A spring 2013 release is expected.\n\nSTRATOVARIUS‘s new DVD, “Under Flaming Winter Skies – Live In Tampere”, recently entered the Music DVD chart in Finland at position No. 1.\n\nReleased on June 29 via earMUSIC, “Under Flaming Winter Skies – Live In Tampere” marks the end of an era as well as a new beginning. Hits and classics like “Under Flaming Skies”, “Speed Of Light” and “Hunting High And Low” as well as exclusive bonus material (30-minute documentary about the band’s history, exclusive interviews with each member as well as a special comment from drummer Jörg Michael about the reasons to leave the band) makes it a must-have for every fan and a real collector’s item not to be missed.\n\nSTRATOVARIUS in June announced the addition of 24-year-old drummerRolf Pilve to the group’s ranks.\n\nSTRATOVARIUS and AMARANTHE will join forces for a “double headline” European tour next spring. The “Nordic Nexus Of Nemesis Tour 2013”will kick off on March 20 in Munich, Germany."
