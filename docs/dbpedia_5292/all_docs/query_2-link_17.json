        "text": "The band, Standing left to right: Jorg Michael (d), Jari Kainulainen (b), Jens Johannson (k), Timo Kotipelto (v) sitting: Timo Tolkki (g)\n\nBIO\n\nFormed in 1982 in Helsinki, Finland, STRATOVARIUS has had a revolving door of band members from their very inception yet their musical focus has always remained consistent. Unleashing their exotic breed of metal fury in the form of their debut album Fright Night in 1989, the band quickly gained a following far and wide. Unimpressed by the bands potential to break, STRATOVARIUS were dropped from CBS Records without warning. But what doesnt kill makes one stronger and the lack in support only fueled their desire to prove themselves as one of the most intensive melodic, power metal acts around. By 1992 STRATOVARIUS sophomore LP, Twilight Time, originally a self-financed demo, hit the streets grabbing at the attention of the vast surrounding metal circuit.\n\nAfter releasing their 1994 album Dreamscape band mastermind Timo Tolkki decided to devote all his efforts to guitar. Their search for a new vocal master ended with their union with the then unknown Timo Kotipelto. Joining the band prior to the recording of Fourth Dimension, Kotipelto was a true asset to the band. Since then STRATOVARIUS released high-quality album after high-quality album each building upon the overwhelming foundation of Fourth Dimension. Episode and Visions, the next two LPs to follow, are sheer displays of the bands staggering musicianship and growth potential.\n\nDuring a tour of Europe and Japan in 1995, STRATOVARIUS went through another line-up revisions recruiting drummer J6rg Michael of Running Wild and keyboardist Jens Johansson Yngwie Malmsteen band and Dio. The two were awed after hearing the demos for STRATOVARIUS' fourth opus, Episode. By 1996 the record had hit the streets (with Michael and Johansson) and was the band's first big success placing them in the Finnish Top 20 for eight weeks and reaching #12 of the Japanese Orikon charts. Their next LP, Visions, reaped the same success bringing the band to gold level status in Finland and earning them extensive tours throughout Europe, South America and Japan performing over 100 shows, each harvesting new fans and a stronger fan-base. Hit singles \"Black Diamond\" and \"Kiss of Judas\" (both promoted as video clips) appealed to the European mainstream audiences while their song \"Forever\" (a ballad off the Episode album), became a huge hit in Korea nationwide after being used in a daily soap opera. The double live album, Visions of Europe-live, was released in 1998 and recorded in Milan/Italy and Athens/Greece. The overwhelming mood, layers and ultimate power of the band's live performance etched within the recording of the album convinced any remaining doubters that STRATOVARIUS was truly worthy of recognition. The live LP graced Finnish charts for 8 weeks peaking on position # 6.\n\nIn October 1998 STRATOVARIUS has released one of their best works yet. Entitled Destiny, the record hit the charts all over Europe and Japan the moment of its release. Destiny even saw some light in South America, making a mark on charts in Brazil and Argentina. But Finland welcomed the LP with the most affection ranking the band at number one for four weeks and keeping them in the Top Ten for more than six months! The Destiny World Tour started in November 1998 and brought the band through Finland and Japan before Christmas. The tour continued until the beginnings of April 1999 through more than 20 countries concluding in Helsinki, Finland where the band where the band was honored with a second gold award.\n\nTheir brand-new killer album Infinite released on March 28th. Penned in the tradition of STRATOVARIUS, Infinite features ear-catchy songs including the single \"Hunting High And Low\", \"Millennium\" and \"Million Light Years Away\" as well as progressive metal hymns like \"Mother Gaia\" and the majestic \"Infinity\". Infinite is sure to strengthen their position as Europe' leading Melodic Metal Group for the new Millennium.\n\nDISCOGRAPHY\n\nFRIGHT NIGHT 1989 (3 stars)\n\nTrack listing: Future Shock, False Messiah, Black Night,Witch Hunt, Fire Dance (instumental), Fright Night, Night Screamer, Darkness, Goodbye (Instrumental)\n\nGood debut album.
