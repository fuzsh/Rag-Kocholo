        "text": "HELLOWEEN Announce 7 Sinners World Tour 2010/11 With STRATOVARIUS\n\nAfter their extremely successful Hellish Rock world tour 2007/08, leading HELLOWEEN through 40 countries on 4 continents, the German heavy metal legend soon will be touring the world again! Three weeks after the release of the new, yet untitled and highly anticipated studio album around Halloween (end of October) 2010, the band will hit the road again and start the tour in Europe.\n\nWhile rumors promise the album to be the band's heaviest and fastest effort in years, Helloween can announce nobody less than the Finland-based heavy metal supergroup STRATOVARIUS for the slot of the very special guest!\n\nSays singer Andi Deris: \"We had a great package with GAMMA RAY last time, and we are very proud to have Stratovarius with us this time. We look forward to have another power metal party with our fans all over the planet  see you soon!\"\n\nThe 7 Sinners World Tour 2010/11 European Part I\n\nNovember\n\n26 - Wien, Austria - Szene\n\n27 - Zlin, Czech Republic - Winter Masters of Rock\n\n28 - Budapest, Hungary - Petöfi Hall\n\nDecember\n\n1 - Langen, Germany - Neue Stadthalle\n\n2 - Antwerp, Belgium - Hof Ter Lo\n\n4 - Prestatyn, UK - Hardrock Hell Festival\n\n5 - London, UK - The HMV Forum\n\n6 - Eindhoven, Netherlands - Effenaar\n\n8 - Lund, Sweden - Mejeriet\n\n9 - Oslo, Norway - Rockefeller\n\n10 - Gothenburg, Sweden - Lisebergshallen\n\n11 - Stockholm, Sweden - Arenan\n\n13 - Tallinn, Estonia - Rock Cafe\n\n14 - Tampere, Finland - Pakkahuone\n\n15 - Helsinki, Finland - House Of Culture\n\n17 - Warsaw, Poland - Stodola\n\n18 - Cracow, Poland - Studio\n\n19 - Prague, Czech Republic - Mala Sportovni Hala\n\n\"It's time to go\n\nTime for the freedom\n\nTime to face what we all believe in\n\nPray strong\n\nPray to the higher\n\nTurn your back on the devil's fire\"\n\nAlso Save Us from the Keepers 2 album seems to have some christian overtones, although Kai Hansen insists he is not a christian.\n\nStratovarius aren't supposed to be a christian band (\"Find Your Own Voice\" made that perfectly clear!) though Timo Tolkki did dabble in kaballah during his last days in Strato. And with their happy-clappy style I imagine a fair few metalheads think they may as well be xtians.\n\nI'm not sure. That seems to be looking a little TOO much into it. Steve Harris has written many a song about God etc. without being religious himself. It's just a good topic for songs!\n\nindeed, there are lots of biblical references in Maiden, starting with Hallowed Be Thy Name going through all the Book of Revelation quotes and references in a number of songs. For the Greater Good of God in AMOLAD is the last best example - however you can read it in a number of different ways, depending on your own religious beliefs. I myself prefer to read this is a very ironic way :Shedevil:\n\n'He gave his life for us he fell upon the cross\n\nTo die for all of those who never mourn his loss\n\nIt wasn't meant for us to feel the pain again\n\nTell me why, tell me why\n\n2 Semi-Christian bands touring together. How awesome is that?\n\nroflol stratovarious christian!? idk about helloween but really stratovarius!? read the lyrics to false messiah, no i HIGHLY doubt that they are christain. freedom call could be called \"semi-christian\" i've also heard that about hammerfall, but no. not stratovarius. sorry man. if you want semi christian metal look at freedom call or a day to remember or impellitteri\n\n2 Semi-Christian bands touring together. How awesome is that?\n\nErm, not awesome at all cos they're not?\n\nfreedom call could be called \"semi-christian\" i've also heard that about hammerfall, but no. not stratovarius. sorry man. if you want semi christian metal look at freedom call or a day to remember or impellitteri\n\nFreedom Call, HammerFall? No.\n\nPower metal bands have archaic lyrical themes and mythological motifs, mentioning pagan gods or high priests no more makes them religious than singing about magic makes them wizards!\n\nC'mon guys.
