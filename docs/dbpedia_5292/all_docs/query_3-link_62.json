        "text": "Review by Lynxie on July 8, 2023.\n\n----Welcome to Lynxie's Guide to Chinese Power Metal. Let us glimpse unto this weird little world caught in the past----\n\nWell, if there's one band we Chinese power metal fans can name as the pride of our nation, Barque Of Dante will sure ascend the throne, and truly that particular glory had belong to them for all these years. Just listen to their debut and you'll understand why - despite all its rawness, Final Victory remains as what I would call a release by national standards.\n\nThe intro, an instrumental piece which I'm positive sampled off an oriental TV series soundtrack, started the album in the most traditional way, setting down a certain mood for the album. Then the album launched into the fast and soaring anthem that is the title track. Last Moment rocked with all epicness of Stratovarius; the solo, despite its slightly awkward transition, is the sort of proggy guitar - keyboard duel not quite unlike those of Symphony X. The following ballad Farewell saw their first attempt at an almost Nightwish-ish male-female duet. Dine in Hell and Immortal Kings speed things up again, both being fairly apt neoclassical old school Europower with quite the Rhapsody influence. Of course, we got to end with a ballad. You could almost say Warrior's Ballad is a track which followed the intro immediately, striking a near circle in terms of structure in melody. Still, I'd appreciate it if this hadn't bear such a resemblance to Stratovarius's famous pop song Forever. Last of all, we got a cover of Dragonforce's My Spirit Will Go On. Not the most common choice and I wish I could say they'd nailed it, but no, the drums are sluggish comparing to Dave's original works, which dragged down the whole dynamic of the song. Also, potent as he was, Xie Zhihen will never be the match of ZP. And I don't think there was such jingling of bells in the solos.\n\nBy all means this could pass off as solid Europower hailing from the golden days. Yes, the general mixing is a bit raw considering the time of the release. Yet it lacks no speed - the drums banged on. The riffs are crispy and almost Edguy-ish, though admittedly not as rough as per my usual preference. The neoclassical elements are tucked in most of the songs. And the solos, especially my favorite on Immortal Kings , are all fairly creative. The keyboards played their due role, taking a page out of Early Rhapsody's book. Now, obviously, the vocals here is their weaker points: Xie serves, but that's about as far as he goes - he needs more energy, which was especially shown on the two ballads, and the accent was weird as hell. I don't know who did the growling in Immortal Kings , but those sound thin as well.\n\nWell, since metal development in China had always lagged 10 years in comparison to the western world, this could definitely be ranked amongst the second tier with the likes of Heavenly and Dragonland back in the second wave. And to be sure, this would probably be the best we'll get. So yeah, despite its length (or lack thereof), Final Victory is a solid debut and it will probably win the hearts of many Europower fans.\n\nHighlights: 'Final Victory', 'Last Moment', 'Immortal Kings'\n\nRating: 8.7 out of 10\n\n255"
