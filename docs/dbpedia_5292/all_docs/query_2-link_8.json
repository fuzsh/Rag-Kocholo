        "text": "Hellsinki Metal Festival is a brand-new addition to the metal festival scene in Helsinki. The event took place partly in the parking lot of the old Ice Hall and partly inside the hall itself. Distinguishing itself from other music festivals in this region, the Hellsinki Metal Festival predominantly showcases heavy, non-mainstream bands.\n\nThis year’s festival lineup featured renowned eg. Norwegian black metal legend Emperor, iconic German thrash metal act Sodom, the Swedish extreme metal sensation Watain, and I Am Morbid, a band featuring two former members of the legendary death metal group Morbid Angel. Originally, one of the headliners was set to be the German power metal giant Helloween, but regrettably, the band had to cancel their performance at the last moment due to illness. In their stead, the Finnish cello metal ensemble Apocalyptica took the stage.”\n\nAs the Hellsinki Metal Festival was being organized for the very first time, I naturally pondered in advance about the festival logistics and the expected turnout. Someone mentioned a minimum goal of selling at least 3,000 tickets daily. However, the festival surpassed that target, as both days witnessed a crowd of more than 5,000 enthusiastic visitors. The festival arrangements proceeded without a hitch. The venue’s location was ideal, offering easy access to the festival grounds. The press enjoyed well-equipped facilities, the bands adhered to their schedules, the sound quality was great, and no extensive lines were seen at any point. Except for one grievance, the beer pricing, which left much to be desired, there was virtually nothing to complain about.\n\nHelloween’s unfortunate cancellation was beyond the organizer’s control. Nevertheless, the festival featured a plethora of captivating bands and other programs. In the following section, I provide my reviews of some of the standout acts and performances from this year’s festival.\n\nVOIVOD\n\nVoivod, Canada’s most internationally renowned progressive thrash metal band, has frequently visited Finland. My recollection takes me back to their previous performance here in 2018. At that time, the band had just unveiled their fourteenth album, “The Wake,” and graced the stage at the Tavastia Club in Helsinki. Fast forward five years, and two more recent Voivod albums have seen the light of day. While I haven’t had the opportunity to listen to the freshly released “Morgoth Tales” album, their preceding release, “Synchro Anarchy,” received my enthusiastic approval.\n\nCategorizing Voivod as a mere progressive thrash metal outfit would be an oversimplification. Their extensive discography encompasses a wide array of styles, spanning from progressive and classic metal to fusion jazz, thrash metal, and virtually everything in between. In my view, Voivod should be recognized as a genre unto itself.\n\nVoivod intends to traverse their repertoire from as many albums as possible during this tour. The set commenced with the title track from the “Killing Technology” album, followed by “Obsolete” from “The Wake” and “Macrosolutions to Megaproblems,” a live rarity that harks back to the era when the band’s original and current vocalist, Denis “Snake” Bélanger, was not part of the lineup. Snake had been absent from the band between 1991 and 2000, and the setlist also included a few other selections from that period.\n\nAs Voivod’s setlist meandered through over four decades of their career, song by song and album by album, it was a bit perplexing, to say the least. In comparison, such a setlist could undoubtedly thrive greatly at their own indoor concerts. However, I questioned its suitability for a festival where the band’s performance was confined to a 60-minute slot. Despite these minor lacks, the setlist remained engaging, punctuated with outstanding and pleasantly confounding moments. For me, the standout tracks were the straightforward “Rebel Robot” from the Jason Newsted (ex-Metallica) era and the classic “Voivod” from the band’s debut album, “War and Pain.” Voivod has always been, and will always be, an exceptional band, and their musical genius continues to astound.\n\nEven though Voivod’s performance commenced at three o’clock in the afternoon, the audience turnout was remarkable. The band radiated with enthusiasm and energy throughout their show. Guitarist Daniel “Chevy” Mongrain and bassist Dominic “Rocky” Laroche, in particular, were on fire during the performance. Snake delivered an excellent vocal performance, handling his role gracefully and constantly smiling. The band’s distinguished drummer and creative force, Michael “Away” Langewin, maintained a tight rhythm and appeared thoroughly content with the experience.\n\nI’m eagerly awaiting the chance to listen to “Morgoth Tales” and anticipate Voivod’s next concert in Finland.”\n\nKilling Technology\n\nObsolete Beings\n\nMacrosolutions to Megaproblems\n\nRise\n\nRebel Robot\n\nThrashing Rage\n\nHolographic Thinking\n\nSleeves Off\n\nFix My Heart\n\nVoivod\n\nCLAWFINGER\n\nClawfinger is a Swedish band often renowned as one of the pioneers of the so-called rap metal genre. While officially disbanded in 2013, the group has since performed several comeback performances with varying line-ups. Vocalist Zak Tell and keyboardist Jocke Skog are the sole members who have been with the band since its inception in 1989. I vividly recall the last time I witnessed Clawfinger live in 1993, when they opened for Anthrax at Kulttuuritalo in Helsinki.\n\nAt that juncture, Anthrax was undergoing a brand new chapter in its career. Joey Belladonna had been replaced by former Armored Saint vocalist John Bush, and the band’s musical style had undergone a marked transformation with the release of the “Sound of White Noise” album. Clawfinger had just launched their debut, “Deaf Dumb Blind.” Kulttuuritalo was packed to capacity, and I was genuinely impressed with the ‘new Anthrax.’ Yet, when it came to Clawfinger, the only recollection I retained was of the dreadlocked vocalist who delivered a high-energy performance.\n\nLet’s fast-forward to the present day. Clawfinger commanded a substantial audience right up front as they kicked off their set with “World Domination.” To my ears, their ‘rap-metal’ sound presents as a diverse amalgamation of various musical styles, incorporating elements reminiscent of Faith No More, Rage Against the Machine, and American rap. I remember when bands of this genre first emerged; I couldn’t quite get into this ‘new wave’ of bands. However, I must concede that Clawfinger’s debut album “Rosegrave” translated remarkably well into a live setting, showcasing the band’s tight cohesion.\n\nI’m only familiar with material from their initial three albums, so a more intricate analysis is beyond my scope. Nevertheless, Clawfinger provided a delightful trip down memory lane, offering a faithful representation of their genre and the era when the band reached the zenith of their career in the mid-90s.”\n\nOut to Get Me\n\nNothing Going On\n\nTwo Sides\n\nRecipe for Hate\n\nRosegrove\n\nWarfair\n\nEnvironmental Patients\n\nBurn in Hell\n\nThe Price We Pay\n\nBiggest & the Best\n\nThe Truth\n\nDo What I Say\n\nSTRATOVARIUS\n\nOften hailed as the pioneer of Finnish power metal, Stratovarius has maintained its position at the pinnacle of the genre despite numerous lineup changes. The band continues to deliver high-quality albums, with their latest release, “Survive,” emerging last year.\n\nIt came as no surprise that the album’s title track kicked off the band’s performance. “Survive” encapsulates the new, heavier side of their production, making for a strong opener that roused the somewhat drowsy crowd. Alongside the title track, the band also played “Frozen” and “World on Fire” from the new album. Yet, it was evident that when they delved into their classic hits like “Black Diamond,” “Eagleheart,” and “Hunting High and Low,” the atmosphere ascended to new heights. “Unbreakable” garnered the most enthusiastic response among the more recent material.\n\nFronted by singer Timo Kotipelto, the band operates in its current assembly like a well-oiled machine. There are no weak links or free passengers in the present lineup, and the internal chemistry within the group appears to be in excellent form. Stratovarius’ performance was solid, though given my multiple live encounters with the band in recent years, their setlist is beginning to feel somewhat predictable. Apart from the three new songs featured, Stratovarius’ setlist has remained largely unchanged for several years. In this regard, the band could take some example from bands like Iron Maiden or Alice Cooper, who mix the setlist heavily on every tour.”\n\nSurvive\n\nEagleheart\n\nWorld on Fire\n\nParadise\n\nFrozen in Time\n\nStratosphere / Holy Light\n\nFather Time\n\nBlack Diamond\n\nUnbreakable\n\nHunting High and Low\n\nSODOM\n\nGerman thrash metal legends Sodom needs no much introduction. Led by Tom Angelripper since 1981, they rank among the most influential European thrash metal bands. Sodom has consistently maintained its distinct and brutal sound despite numerous lineup changes. The current lineup includes also Frank Blackfire, who contributed to the band’s most essential records in the 1980s. While Sodom continues to release quality thrash metal albums, “Persecution Mania” and “Agent Orange” stand out as the band’s most classic and iconic works.\n\nThe band’s performance commenced with the heavy “Silence is Consent” from “Get What You Deserve” (1994), followed by one of their best-known tracks, “Nuclear Winter.” Angelripper delivered his vocals and growls as if in his prime time, and his raw, Lemmy Kilmister-like bass sound resonated irresistibly. Angelripper’s charismatic presence was unmistakable, but Frank Blackfire commanded the spotlight on stage. He delivered impressive guitar solos alongside his energetic performance, contributing significantly to the band’s current sound. Blackfire has also left his mark on another formidable German thrash legend, Kreator. The ‘youth section’ of the band, featuring guitarist Yorck Segatz and drummer Toni Merkel, radiated energy and seamlessly complemented the band’s dynamic.\n\nSodom’s eleven-song setlist spanned their entire career but with a clear emphasis on their classic material. The performance boasted no weak links, yet the standout moments were the old classics, notably “Agent Orange” and the set’s finale, “Bombenhagel.” One notable drawback was the absence of my favorite, “Remember the Fallen,” for unknown reasons. Sodom’s performance may not have introduced anything groundbreaking or novel. Still, it offered a nostalgic and musically tight thrash metal experience. It underscored the value of including more old-school thrash bands like Sodom in festival lineups.\n\nSilence Is Consent\n\nNuclear Winter\n\nSodom & Gomorrah\n\nOutbreak of Evil\n\nConflagration\n\nSodomy and Lust\n\nM-16\n\nAgent Orange\n\nCaligula\n\nBlasphemer\n\nBombenhagel\n\nBLIND GUARDIAN\n\n“Due to the unfortunate cancellation of Helloween, Blind Guardian assumed the role of the festival’s headliner, representing the power metal genre. Their music incorporates a multitude of symphonic and progressive elements, making Blind Guardian much more than a typical power metal band. With several years since their last visit to Finland, it was no surprise that the band attracted the largest crowd on Friday.\n\nLed by vocalist Hansi Kursch, Blind Guardian opened their set with the title track from the album “Imaginations From The Other Side,” one of the band’s most iconic songs. This was followed by “Welcome to Dying” and “Nightfall.” Blind Guardian had crafted a setlist heavily centered around classics from their early career, a well-thought-out choice for a festival performance of this kind. Remarkably, only one song, “Violent Shadows,” was performed from albums released after “Nightfall in Middle-Earth” (1998). This was somewhat unfortunate, given that last year’s ‘The God Machine’ is their best album in over twenty years.\n\nHansi Kursch, always smiling, demonstrated that his voice was in peak condition, and the entire band was performing really energetically. Blind Guardian delivered a highly entertaining and musically flawless performance to the audience. Although I would have preferred a set longer than 60 minutes, that was beyond the band’s control. Hopefully, Blind Guardian will swiftly return to Finland, offering a full set for their fans.”\n\nImaginations From the Other Side\n\nWelcome to Dying\n\nNightfall\n\nThe Script for My Requiem\n\nLord of the Rings\n\nTime Stands Still (At the Iron Hill)\n\nViolent Shadows\n\nThe Bard’s Song – In the Forest\n\nMirror Mirror\n\nValhalla\n\nI AM MORBID\n\nI Am Morbid is a classic death metal band led by the former Morbid Angel band frontman, David Vincent. For many, the band was undeniably the most highly anticipated act of the festival. Vincent established I Am Morbid in 2016, and since then, the band’s lineup has undergone multiple changes. Guitarist Bill Hudson, recognized for his work with Doro’s band, has been a permanent member for several years. Joining last October, Richie Brown is another guitarist in the mix. However, the return of the original Morbid Angel drummer, a true legend, Pete “Commando” Sandoval, delights the old Morbid Angel fans the most. He joined the band in the spring of 2022. Nowadays, I Am Morbid’s lineup boasts 50% of the original Morbid Angel members, which is more than can be found in the “original” band’s current lineup.\n\nOn this tour, which commenced two weeks ago, I Am Morbid celebrates the thirtieth anniversary of the classic “Covenant” album. However, the band’s set began with “Immortal Rites” from the earlier release, “Altars of Madness.” It was swiftly followed by “Fall From Grace” and the title track from “Blessed Are the Sick.” David Vincent was still his calm person. His powerful growling has remained as ever, and the man showed no signs of waning. However, one noticeable change was the absence of headbanging. One might wonder if this is due to health issues or other factors. However, it did not detract too much from his classy performance.\n\nThe band’s younger guitarists were responsible for the action on stage, and they meticulously reproduced Trey Azagthoth’s original solos, almost from note to note. Pete Sandoval delivered a thunderous drumming performance with a relentless intensity. He has long been regarded as one of the genre’s finest drummers and a man proved that he still has his amazing drummer prowess left. Back problems that had previously hindered his playing have now been resolved, allowing him to pound his drum kit with the same ferocity as in his prime. His performance was incredible to behold and listen to.\n\nAn impressive eight songs from the acclaimed “Covenant” album featured in the set, with “World of Shit (The Promised Land)” closing the performance. This track, distinct from the rest of the material, left a powerful impression. The crowd was more than pleased when I Am Morbid’s set concluded. The band played all the expected songs, but what was striking was how vibrant and energetic these classic tracks sounded in this “cover band” rendition. This band authentically delivers old-school death metal as it should be performed: brutal and loaded with attitude. To most fans, Vincent and Sandoval now epitomize the genuine Morbid Angel. Unfortunately, the band has no plans to create new original music, but one can hope that changes in the future.”\n\nFall From Grace\n\nBlessed Are the Sick\n\nRapture\n\nPain Divine\n\nVengeance Is Mine\n\nThe Lion’s Den\n\nMaze of Torment\n\nDominate\n\nWhere the Slime Live\n\nBlood on My Hands\n\nGod of Emptiness\n\nWorld of Shit (The Promised Land)\n\nEMPEROR\n\nNorwegian black metal legend Emperor took the stage to an enthusiastic ovation and exchanged greetings with the crowd before diving into the opening track, “In the Wordless Chamber.” The stage was awash in shades of blue and green, creating a dark atmosphere. In contrast to many other black metal acts, Emperor does not wear masks or elaborate costumes, and their stage setup was decidedly minimal. Emperor allows their music to speak for itself, and their performance successfully translated their albums into a form of fine art. From the opening notes to the climactic ending with “Ye Entrancemperium,” the band captivated the audience. Notably, the classic “Inno Satana” received the warmest reception.\n\nEmperor’s setlist leaned heavily on classics from their first two albums, “In the Nightside Eclipse” and “Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk.” The remainder of their set featured carefully selected tracks from their illustrious career, including the ferocious opener “Curse You All Men!” from “IX Equilibrium” -album. The original members, vocalist/guitarist Ihsahn, guitarist Samoth, drummer Trym Torson, and live members bassist Secthdaemon and keyboardist Jørgen Munkeby, did justice to these songs. Their passionate and authentic performance paid homage to the original studio versions recorded by the band in the early ’90s.\n\nMuch like the experience with Am I Morbid, this concert was a splendid nostalgia trip, leaving me again contemplating the possibility of new material. While it presumably will not happen, there’s always room for hope.”\n\nIn the Wordless Chamber\n\nThus Spake the Nightspirit\n\nEnsorcelled by Khaos\n\nThe Loss and Curse of Reverence\n\nWith Strength I Burn\n\nCurse You All Men!\n\nTowards the Pantheon\n\nThe Majesty of the Nightsky\n\nI Am the Black Wizards\n\nInno a Satana\n\nInto the Infinity of Thoughts\n\nYe Entrancemperium\n\nOFFICIAL HELLSINKI META LFESTIVAL WEBPAGE"
