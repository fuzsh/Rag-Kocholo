Especially in this kind of university environment, (because) there are these kind of Unixes available, even for PCs but their price level is very high.\r\n\r\nFor instance, when you buy DOS for your home PC for around 200 marks buying Unix for your home computer can easily cost 20 000 marks, which is for a student a-bit-too-much.\r\n\r\nTry and go to your local PC shop and ask if they sell SCO Unix they will look at you and say, HELL NO! As a matter of fact, it's much easier to code it yourself.\r\n\r\nYes, Linus is a friend of beer as most Finnish men are.",
