        "text": "This edition includes lots of darkness. Some you can dance to, some you can slay too. And more! To the metals…\n\nAll Them Witches – ATW\n\nGenre: Stoner rock\n\nOrigin: Nashville, Tennessese\n\nLabel: New West\n\nThe little I've heard of this has all the fuzz, extended jams, and throwback vibes the band is known for. The track \"Fishbelly 86 Onions\" features a section that teaches the listener how to count to twenty, so it's also educational. Overall, a well timed album release for the spookiness the year is already entering.\n\n[youtube=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh1Jd8xU42U][/youtube]\n\nAnaal Nathrakh – A New Kind Of Horror\n\nGenre: Industrial/black metal\n\nOrigin: Birmingham, England\n\nLabel: Metal Blade\n\nWhere All Them Witches brought the spookiness, Anaal Nathrakh is bringing the straight up chaotic horror. A New Kind Of Horror is not a new kind of Anaal Nathrakh, but it's on par with their best moments of their discography. It reminds me a lot of In the Constellation of the Black Widow, and I'm not upset by that.\n\n[youtube=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyHHUImw-VM][/youtube]\n\nThe Black Queen – Infinite Games\n\nGenre: Electronic\n\nOrigin: Los Angeles, California\n\nLabel: Federal Prisoner\n\nNow of their second album, Greg Puciato and the gang are proving that the success of Fever Daydream was no fluke. This is another album of great electronic music that brings early Nine Inch Nails and 80's vibes to mind. This album is more chill than their first, which isn't a bad thing. Instead, it's almost poetic, because it feels like Greg is trying to get as far from the Dillinger Escape Plan sound as he can for this.\n\n[youtube=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwk7EuF7iQ][/youtube]\n\nMirrors For Psychic Warfare – I See What I Became\n\nGenre: Experimental\n\nOrigin: Oakland, California\n\nLabel: Neurot\n\nScott Kelly (Neurosis) and producer Sanford Parker are back with another album of weird, ambient, vaguely sludgy jams. The duo seem set on cementing this as more than a one-off project and they wind up one-uping themselves. Their self-titled debut had cool moments, but this one is intriguing start-to-finish. How many more hyphens could one fit into this micro-review?\n\n[youtube=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLCbKszn1WA][/youtube]\n\nRevocation – The Outer Ones\n\nGenre: Technical death metal/thrash\n\nOrigin: Boston, Massachusetts\n\nLabel: Metal Blade\n\nCan there be too much Revocation? They are on a pretty regular schedule of a new album every two years (with a couple instances of back to back years), and the quality has yet to dip. So it seems like we're not to the point of too much good stuff yet, and as a fan it's the most ideal place to be.\n\n[youtube=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbEBKH_XDrU][/youtube]\n\nStratovarius – Enigma: Intermission II\n\nGenre: power metal\n\nOrigin: Helsinki, Finland\n\nLabel: earMusic\n\nThis week has felt very dark tonally, so lets fix that with some power metal! This is mostly a compilation of rarities, but there are also some orchestra versions of older songs, and few new jams on here. It winds up being an epic buffet for fans, and a fun places to check out a variety of material from the band.\n\n[youtube=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYph9C5lTqQ][/youtube]\n\nUn – Sentiment Translation\n\nGenre: Funeral doom/sludge\n\nOrigin: Seattle, Washington\n\nLabel: Loss Records\n\nEnding this week in an unbelievably slow and heavy place. This is the four song follow-up to their lauded debut, and it feels like this band is on an upward trajectory in the doom game. I won't be surprised to see this on some of our writers' end of the year lists come December.\n\n[youtube=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJWWfr1cH_M][/youtube]\n\nAlso dropping today…"
