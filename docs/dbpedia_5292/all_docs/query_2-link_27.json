        "text": "While it is an incredibly niche and frequently misunderstood genre elsewhere, in Finland metal is one of the most popular types of music, and the genre is even played on mainstream radio stations. Finland has more heavy-metal musicians per capita than any nation on Earth: 53.5 per 100,000 people. Even then-US President Barack Obama noted the cultural significance of heavy metal music in Finland at the 2016 Nordic Summit.\n\nWe at Chaoszine have decided to start doing small and informative band documentaries of Finnish bands which have made their way also outside Finland and the fifth band we are presenting through the series is Stratovarius. The band is one of the most influential Finnish rock bands of all time and opened a lot of doors for Finnish bands internationally.\n\nYou can check out the fifth part of the document series below:"
