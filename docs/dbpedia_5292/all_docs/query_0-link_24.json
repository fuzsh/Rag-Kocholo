        "meta_description": "Stratovarius performing @ 1998 Gods of Metal festival in Milan, Italy during the tour for the \"Visions of Europe\" live album promotion.\r\n\r\nThe show was hampered by many technical issues to Timo Tolkki's guitar which led to delays and to the organizers to decide to cut the show short preventing the band to perform the last song in the set, Timo Tolkki complained heavily with the technicians and afterwards was so furious that he smashed his guitar on the floor, you can see it clearly at the end of the video.\r\n\r\nThe drive and performance is great nevertheless. The classic line-up at their peak times.\r\n\r\nSet list :\r\n\r\n0:00 - Black diamond\r\n6:15 - Paradise\r\n11:50 - Speed of light\r\n15:50 - Before the winter\r\n25:20 - Forever free\r\n31:45 - The kiss of Judas\r\n38:00 - Hold on to your dream\r\n41:45 - Forever\r\n45:05 - Father time (aborted) + Timo smashes guitar\r\n\r\nBand :\r\n\r\nTimo Tolkki - Guitars\r\nTimo Kotipelto - Vocals\r\nJari Kainulainen - Bass guitar\r\nJens Johansson - Keyboards\r\nJorg Michael - Drums",
