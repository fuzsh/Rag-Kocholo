        "text": "Remember when Roger Waters left Pink Floyd and the band released its first post-Waters album, 1987’s A Momentary Lapse of Reason? Well, probably not. But that’s similar to what faces Finland’s Stratovarius today.\n\nAdmittedly, this veteran Finnish power-metal quintet isn’t nearly as well-known as the English prog-rockers. Yet during ex-guitarist Timo Tolkki’s quarter-century with Stratovarius, he wrote even more material than Waters did for Floyd. Last year, the volatile virtuoso left the group to pursue a new project called Revolution Renaissance, citing creative and personal differences with singer Timo Kotipelto and drummer Jí¶rg Michael. This was also the second time in the 2000s that Tolkki announced Stratovarius was kaput. Yet the band decided to continue with a new six-stringer, 26-year-old Matias Kupiainen.\n\nSo what did these changes mean for the new Stratovarius album, 2009’s Polaris? “We didn’t actually know what direction this record would take when we started writing,” says keyboardist Jens Johansson, phoning from his tour bus in Toronto. “We just went into a cottage in Finland and wrote 16 or 17 songs. With the sound of Timo’s voice and Jí¶rg’s drums, it sounded like Stratovarius. At this point, we still didn’t have a record deal, and had to self-finance the production.”\n\nDespite Tolkki’s departure, the 11-track disc—released on earMUSIC—follows in the tradition of classic Stratovarius albums like Episode and Visions. Johansson delivers classical harpsichord solemnity in the intro to “Blind” before the band segues into a high-speed operatic romp. From the pomp-rock slog march of “King of Nothing” to the synth-washed hard-rock groove of “Falling Star”, Polaris abounds with emotional, soaring-across-the-universe lyrics. Even Tolkki would be proud. Or maybe not.\n\n“Part of Tolkki is now insanely jealous that we’re taking charge of his baby,” Johansson says of the long-time band leader, who voluntarily surrendered all rights to the Stratovarius name and back-catalogue royalties in 2008 on philosophical grounds. “Earlier this year, he was perfectly okay with things. But a few months ago, he made all these really angry statements.”\n\nTouring North America is one way to forget the drama. Johansson, a 46-year-old Swede who first gained fame as Yngwie Malmsteen’s keyboardist in the early ’80s, has a simple on-the-road routine: planning hot showers at the next gig, making sandwiches on his George Foreman Grill, and reading books like Frederick Taylor’s The Berlin Wall: A World Divided, 1961-1989.\n\nComing to Vancouver, Johansson looks forward to Sweden defending its Olympic hockey crown at GM Place in 2010. His interest in European history, perhaps conditioned by all the in-band fighting he’s witnessed, is reflected in his perspective on the ice gladiators.\n\n“In Europe, we have these postage-stamp-sized countries that harbour deep hatred for one another, and then in international hockey, it blooms out and it’s a beautiful thing,” quips Johansson. “It’s much better to have a hockey game than another Thirty Years’ War.”"
