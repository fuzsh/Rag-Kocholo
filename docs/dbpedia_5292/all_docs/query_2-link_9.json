        "text": "The latest news comes from the former guitarist for the Finnish power metal band STRATOVARIUS who finally reformed the initial formation of STRATOVARIUS in the era of the album “Dreamspace“, but the results of this reform used a new name, namely TIMO TOLKKI’s STRATO. With Timo Tolkki (vocals and guitar), Tuomo Lassila (drums) and Antti Iconen (keyboards), these personnel recorded the classic albums “Fright Night“, “Twilight Time“, “Dreamspace” and “Fourth Dimension“. The album “Dreamspace” was the last STRATOVARIUS album to feature Timo Tolkki as lead vocals, while on the album “Forth Dimension” Tolkki recorded vocals for the demo version of the album before finally deciding to focus on guitars and then recruiting Timo Kotipelto as vocalist.\n\nIn the summer of 2022, Timo Tolkki, Tuomo Lassila, and Antti Iconen got together to discuss ideas for reforming the initial line-up and decided to call themselves “TIMO TOLKKI’s STRATO“. They have been quietly rehearsing in Tuomo’s garage from January 2023. The reformed band has signed with Warner Music Japan and are currently recording their debut album titled “Return To Dreamspace”, which is set to be released on October 27, 2023 , preceded by the single “Is this the Brave New World?“. A Japanese tour is planned for spring 2024 and Timo Tolkki will visit Japan in November 2023 to promote the album, this is his first since 2007. A Latin American and European tour is also being prepared. In concert, the band will perform songs from “Return To Dreamspace”, as well as albums from “Stratovarius”, “Fright Night”, “Twilight Time” and “Dreamspace”.\n\nTimo Tolkki’s manager Eric Cerda described their music “sounds like Dreamspace era classics but updated for the 2020s.” Fans of melodic Power Metal, a genre heavily defined by these youths, will love their new songs and early-era STRATOVARIUS fans will surely be delighted.”\n\nTuomo Lassila formed STRATOVARIUS in Helsinki in 1984 and is co-responsible with original guitarist Staffan Stråhlman for the band STRATOVARIUS. One year later Timo Tolkki joined them. STRATOVARIUS released their debut album “Fright Night” (1989) via CBS Finland. From there began one of the greatest success stories in the history of melodic metal. They defined what is now known as “Power Metal” with works such as “Fright Night” (1989), “Twilight Time” (1993), “Dreamspace” (1994) and “Fourth Dimension” (1995)."
