Oscar winning Hollywood actor James "Jimmy" Stewart (who's known for his roles in movies such as "It's a Wonderful Life", "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington", "Rear Window" and many others) bought a Tudor-style mansion accented with brick, birch trees, and a stone walkway at 918 North Roxbury Drive in Beverly Hills in 1949. Stewart lived here until his death in 1997. A year later in 1998 the house was sold, demolished and the current 15.000 square-feet Tuscan styled mansion was built on the premises. Prior to his death, Jimmy could often be seen walking his dogs along Roxbury Drive.
