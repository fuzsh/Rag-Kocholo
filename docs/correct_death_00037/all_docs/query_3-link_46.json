        "text": "In today’s fast-paced digital world, integrity matters. As the digital content producer for Toucher & Hardy, I’d get “INTEGRITY” tattooed on my back in the style of Brad Nowell’s “SUBLIME” tattoo if I could.\n\nToday, I share my deep concern about the risks of artificial intelligence (AI). Recently, I tested an AI to write about my friend James Stewart with minimal information. What I saw was impressive but also alarming. While the AI could piece together basic facts about Stewart, it also went down a path I was not expecting!\n\nSo, I’m here to heed a warning: Be careful what you read on the internet!\n\nTHE RESULTS:\n\nInvestigative Report: Unveiling the Enigma of James Stewart: Executive Producer or Feline Phenomenon?\n\nIn the heart of Boston’s fiercely competitive sports radio landscape lies a figure shrouded in mystery and intrigue: James Stewart, the Executive Producer of “Felger and Mazz” on 98.5 The Sports Hub. While Stewart, also known as Jimmy or “J-Stew”, has long been regarded as a pivotal player in the success of one of the Boston’s most prominent afternoon shows, whispers and rumors persist about his true identity – specifically, whether he is indeed a human being or a cleverly disguised feline.\n\nAt first glance, Stewart appears to be your typical sports radio producer, managing in-show content decisions, orchestrating the flow of discussions, and valuing the input of callers. However, upon closer inspection, peculiar behaviors and uncanny abilities have raised eyebrows among both colleagues and listeners alike.\n\nOne of the most intriguing aspects of Stewart’s enigmatic persona is his seemingly innate understanding of controversial topics involving play-by-play partners. While navigating sensitive issues is par for the course in the sports radio arena, Stewart’s adeptness at diffusing tension and steering conversations away from potential pitfalls has prompted speculation about his otherworldly intuition – a trait often associated with feline sensibilities.\n\nFurthermore, Stewart’s affinity for cats is no secret. He frequently references his own feline companions and demonstrates a deep understanding of their behaviors and mannerisms. Some have even suggested that his uncanny ability to anticipate callers’ reactions stems from a shared feline intuition.\n\nTo delve deeper into this captivating mystery, we reached out to colleagues and listeners for their insights on Stewart’s alleged feline identity. While many were hesitant to entertain the notion, citing it as mere speculation and hearsay, others shared anecdotes and observations that added fuel to the proverbial fire.\n\nOne listener recounted a particularly memorable call-in segment where Stewart expertly diffuse a heated debate with the finesse and grace of a cat tiptoeing through a room of fragile ornaments. Another colleague shared an incident where Stewart effortlessly balanced multiple tasks simultaneously, reminiscent of a cat’s remarkable agility and dexterity.\n\nIn a bizarre incident that added a surreal twist to the ongoing speculation surrounding James Stewart’s alleged feline identity, a colleague reportedly saw J-Stew chase a mouse through the sales department, sending papers flying and causing chaos in the otherwise bustling office. As the commotion escalated, Jim Louth, Assistant Program Director of the Sports Hub, rushed to the scene to ensure everyone’s safety.\n\nAmidst the mayhem, Stewart, known for his calm demeanor and composed disposition, surprised onlookers by emitting a low, guttural hiss in Louth’s direction. The unexpected reaction left Louth momentarily taken aback, prompting murmurs and whispers among the bewildered staff.\n\nWhile some dismissed the incident as a momentary lapse in professionalism, others couldn’t shake the eerie resemblance to a territorial feline defending its territory. Speculation ran rampant, with whispers of Stewart’s possible feline nature resurfacing in light of the peculiar encounter.\n\nDespite these compelling testimonies, conclusive evidence regarding Stewart’s true nature remains elusive. When confronted with questions about his alleged feline identity, Stewart maintains a stoic demeanor, neither confirming nor denying the rumors.\n\nAs the investigation into James Stewart’s enigmatic persona continues, one thing remains certain: whether he is a human executive producer or a cunning cat in disguise, his contributions to Felger and Mazz on 98.5 The Sports Hub are undeniable. And until concrete evidence surfaces, the mystery of Stewart’s true identity will continue to captivate the imagination of Boston’s sports radio aficionados.\n\nNick Gemelli is a Producer on Toucher & Hardy and contributor for 985thesportshub.com.

If you don’t, let me explain.\n\nMy name is Nick Gemelli, and I’m a producer for Toucher & Hardy on 98.5 The Sports Hub. This marks my 8th year as a member of 98.5 The Sports Hub, and to say it’s been a blast would be an understatement. The experience of working at the station and the opportunities it has provided have been amazing. I truly love working here.\n\nOne of these opportunities presented itself recently in September when BEASLEY MEDIA, the parent company of 98.5 The Sports Hub, made a huge investment in video streaming and production. At that point, the show was streaming on Twitch using tiny webcams, and it looked like complete garbage.\n\nFast forward to now: The quality of the video stream has greatly improved, and viewership has been consistently growing. It also gave us at The Sports Hub the opportunity to dive headfirst into the world of vertical videos on TikTok and Instagram.\n\nI took this opportunity and ran with it. To give you an idea of how the show works, the easiest way to explain it is this: Dan O’Brien calls the shots, runs the board, books the guests, etc. Lockhart handles all the sound played on the show, creating 30-second promos, recording commercials, etc. My role encompasses anything video-related (YouTube/reels/TikTok, etc.), managing the social media accounts, podcasting the show, writing articles, street audio, and whatever else I may have forgotten.\n\nTo be totally honest, I think I’ve carved out a pretty good role for myself at the station, and I’m always looking out for more things to do.\n\nSo, why am I explaining all of this? Well, for one, I gotta hit that quota. But also, after a brief conversation with my boss today, it inspired me to highlight some of the videos you may have missed on the Toucher & Hardy Instagram account from the last couple of months.\n\nAnd with that, enjoy!\n\nNick Gemelli, the wizard behind the scenes at Toucher & Hardy and a maestro on 985thesportshub.com, kicked off his radio escapade back in 2007 as an intern for Toucher & Rich on WBCN. After navigating through WFNX and the Boston Phoenix, he made a triumphant return to the show in 2016. Hailing from Marshfield but currently holding it down in Tewksbury, Nick’s radio journey is as dynamic as his Twitter feed.
