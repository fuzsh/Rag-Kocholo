        "text": "Vietnam War - U.S. Army\n\nJimmy Goethel Stewart\n\nDetails\n\nRank: Staff Sergeant\n\nConflict/Era: Vietnam War\n\nUnit/Command:\n\nCompany B, 2d Battalion, 12th Cavalry,\n\n1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile)\n\nMilitary Service Branch: U.S. Army\n\nMedal of Honor Action Date: May 18, 1966\n\nMedal of Honor Action Place: Republic of Vietnam\n\nCitation\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty. Early in the morning a reinforced North Vietnamese company attacked Company B, which was manning a defensive perimeter in Vietnam. The surprise onslaught wounded five members of a six-man squad caught in the direct path of the enemy's thrust. S/Sgt. Stewart became a lone defender of vital terrain[--virtually one man against a hostile platoon. Refusing to take advantage of a lull in the firing which would have permitted him to withdraw, S/Sgt. Stewart elected to hold his ground to protect his fallen comrades and prevent an enemy penetration of the company perimeter. As the full force of the platoon-sized attack struck his lone position, he fought like a man possessed; emptying magazine after magazine at the determined, oncharging enemy. The enemy drove almost to his position and hurled grenades, but S/Sgt. Stewart decimated them by retrieving and throwing the grenades back. Exhausting his ammunition, he crawled, under intense fire, to his wounded team members and collected ammunition that they were unable to use. Far past the normal point of exhaustion, he held his position for four harrowing hours and through three assaults, annihilating the enemy as they approached and before they could get a foothold. As a result of his defense, the company position held until the arrival of a reinforcing platoon which counterattacked the enemy, now occupying foxholes to the left of S/Sgt. Stewart's position. After the counterattack, his body was found in a shallow enemy hole where he had advanced in order to add his fire to that of the counterattacking platoon. Eight enemy dead were found around his immediate position, with evidence that 15 others had been dragged away. The wounded whom he gave his life to protect were recovered and evacuated. S/Sgt. Stewart's indomitable courage, in the face of overwhelming odds, stands as a tribute to himself and an inspiration to all men of his unit. His actions were in the highest traditions of the U.S. Army and the Armed Forces of his country."
