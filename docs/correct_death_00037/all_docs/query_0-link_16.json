        "text": "IT’S NOT A GOOD MORNING: My friend — and yours — Jimmy Stewart has gone. When my phone rang early Wednesday morning and the voice said, “This is Michael McLean,” I knew what to expect from Stewart’s stepson. Jimmy Stewart was at peace when he died, not in pain and he looked peaceful. McLean and Stewart’s twin daughters Kelly (Mrs. Sandy) Harcourt, and Judy (Mrs. Steven) Merrill had told me some time back, “If anything happens to Jimmy, you will be the first we will call.” I had been talking to Jimmy regularly over the years and had visited his home; after he bought the house next door to his and tore it down to put in a beautiful flower and vegetable-fruit garden in the heart of Beverly Hills, we sat outside and talked of many things. In the den of the house, he proudly showed me photos wife Gloria had taken of their trips to Africa. But, after Gloria died in 1994, our conversations were limited to the telephone. I tried to cheer him up by my calls, but his visits with other friends faded. In the past two years at home, sad to say, he only came down from his bedroom to eat lunch or dinner — and only on some occasions. He liked peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, blintzes for dinners. And recently his longtime housekeeper Anne Coyle was even able to get him to eat pancakes — something he’d never done before! When I said, “I drive by your house every day on my way to work, why don’t I stop by and we can shmooze?” He replied, “I don’t think you’d find me very interesting these days.” Stewart was, and will always be, interesting. Furthermore, he was always interested — that’s more than I can say for a lot of people I’ve interviewed. He always made me feel welcome on any set I visited and invariably gave me something (if not earth-shattering) to print. … Despite his “disappearance” from the outside world, he remained concerned about what was going on. He read Daily Variety every day, he’d tell me — at our 4 p.m. phone conversations — and he’d comment, although sparsely, about what was happening in the biz. He got a kick out of the fact that he was considered the most trustworthy personality in America in a recent nationwide poll.\n\nPopular on Variety"
