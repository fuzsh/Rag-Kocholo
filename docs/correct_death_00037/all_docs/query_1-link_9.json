        "text": "An American Icon, when he won the Best Actor Oscar in 1940 for his role in ‘The Philadelphia Story,’ he sent it to his father saying, ‘It belongs to us both.’ His dad, who owned a hardware store, kept it on a shelf for 25 years where it could be viewed by the customers. James had great empathy for his hometown and years later they would erect and dedicate a statue to him in the town square with him in attendance. Our good friend, Karolyn Grimes who played Stewart’s daughter ZuZu in the 1946 classic ‘It’s a Wonderful Life’ is on the board. He was the first movie star to enter the service in World War II becoming a Colonel. James flew 20 combat missions, earned the Air Medal, the Distinguished Flying Cross presented to him by Gen Jimmy Doolittle, The Croix de Guerre presented by France and seven battle stars. He was promoted to brigadier general while serving in the Air Force Reserve. He made four Hitchcock thrillers: ‘Rope,’ ‘Rear Window,’ ‘The Man Who Knew Too Much’ and ‘Vertigo.’ He died at his home of a pulmonary blood clot at the age of eighty-nine. Jimmy Stewart’s funeral service was held at The Presbyterian Church, which was the family church in Beverly Hills. The Stewart family sat in the same pew for forty years. Here he was married and where his wife’s funeral was held a few years prior to his own. His legacy and many memorials remain: The James Stewart Museum is located in Indiana, Pennsylvania his hometown. He was presented a Life Achievement Award by The American Film Institute. His movie, ‘It’s A Wonderful Life,’ has become a classic and part of the American Christmas tradition with a showing by almost every TV station in the land on Christmas day. He was awarded the Medal of Freedom, ‘America’s highest Civilian Honor.’ His stepson was killed at the age of twenty-four in Vietnam and is interred beside the couple."
