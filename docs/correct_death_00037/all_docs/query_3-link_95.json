        "text": "CROWN POINT â€” A woman charged in the murder of her children's father told police three different stories about what happened leading up to the killing, court documents show.\n\nMaya D. Washington, 40, of Gary, is accused of killing Jerome Scott, 35, also of Gary, July 4 outside an apartment complex in East Chicago. Scott was found around 10:30 p.m. with a gunshot wound to the stomach and died less than two hours later at a hospital, East Chicago police said July 5.\n\nWashington said she and Scott, with whom she was in a relationship, left a holiday party and drove to an apartment complex at 3620 Superior Court to drop off a friend. She said she and Scott had been arguing in her car and she grabbed her gun from the inside of the car door, according to a probable cause affidavit.\n\nThere was a struggle for the gun and the weapon went off, striking Scott, Washington initially told police. She changed her story and said it was Scott who pulled the weapon first which led to the struggle and shooting, the affidavit said.\n\nShe supposedly changed the story once more and said Scott grabbed the weapon, pointed it at her and got out of the car with it. She chased him around to try and get the weapon before it went off, she said. She went back to her car and took off, unaware she shot Scott.\n\nA Lake County Prosecutor's Homicide Task Force detective wrote in the affidavit that Washington's stories did not match a witness account nor did it match physical evidence. A witness told police she was watching fireworks outside the apartment complex when a yellow Ford Escape pulled up and a passenger got out of the vehicle and entered the building, the affidavit said, and the car drove off.\n\nFive to ten minutes later the car returned to the area and a man identified as Scott walked toward the car from the parking lot area. As he approached the Ford, the witness heard a \"pop\" and watched Scott walk away from the vehicle and collapse on the ground.\n\nDetectives used a license plate reader to identify a yellow Ford Escape in areas in East Chicago and Gary on the day before and after the homicide, the document shows. Driving records show the vehicle is registered to Washington.\n\nPolice scored a search warrant for the Ford and recovered a shell casing from inside the car, the document said. They searched Washington's phone with her permission and located messages to Scott the day after the homicide in which she apologizes for what happened. They found messages Washington sent to another woman a few days before the homicide in which she accuses the person of having a sexual relationship with Scott.\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.\n\nLizzie Kaboski\n\nPublic Safety Reporter\n\nGet email notifications on {{subject}} daily!\n\nYour notification has been saved.\n\nThere was a problem saving your notification.\n\n{{description}}\n\nEmail notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.\n\nFollowed notifications\n\nPlease log in to use this feature\n\nLog In\n\nDon't have an account?
