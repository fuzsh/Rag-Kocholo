        "text": "The new price tag for this movie legend’s old property in Beverly Hills might give you vertigo.\n\nThe mansion where Jimmy Stewart lived for almost 50 years went up for sale on Monday for $47.9 million, Mansion Global reported.\n\nStewart’s original home was demolished after he died in 1997 at the age of 89. The current 15,300-square-foot, Italian-style villa was built in 2000, according to Mansion Global. It was designed by architect Kevin Clark, and is listed with Christopher Dyson at The Agency for approximately $3,125 per square foot.\n\nSign Up for the undefined Newsletter\n\nThe sprawling estate at 918 N. Roxbury Drive has had a few different owners since 2000. Most recently, Zacara LLC bought the property in 2015 for $36 million – or $2,946 per square foot – according to property records.\n\nStewart’s former address spans two lots, and at 1.3 acres, is one of the largest in the area. The updated main house has seven bedrooms and 11 bathrooms, and the grounds include gardens, a pool and a two-bedroom guest house. Inside, the home features a home theatre, sauna, 1,000-bottle wine cellar, tasting room and wood-paneled library.\n\nStewart – who starred in Alfred Hitchcock’s “Vertigo,” and “It’s a Wonderful Life” – moved into his home at the address in 1949 and lived there until he died."
