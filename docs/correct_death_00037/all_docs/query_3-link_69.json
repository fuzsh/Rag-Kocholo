        "text": "jusq said on 26/Sep/23\n\nAfter watching Vertigo I never got the impression that he was THIS tall. I'd have imagined the average height was lower than what it is today when it was filmed, and even today 6'3 is considered incredibly tall. I would've thought 6'0 or 6'1 at most, but wow was I shocked when I discovered his real height.\n\nSandy Cowell said on 3/May/23\n\nJimmy was almost as tall as John Wayne. He died at 89 and everyone liked him.\n\nSandy Cowell said on 3/May/23\n\nIâm watching Discovering James Stewart on my TV. The programme did mention his tall height, of course!\n\n6ft3.\n\nSlim1.75m said on 29/Apr/23\n\n@Rob would Stewart or Cooper be taller.\n\nEditor Rob\n\nMight think Stewart could have the better chance of edging Cooper, though it really looks close.\n\nTawehret said on 24/Mar/23\n\nHe was a really good actor and I think a lot of guys could relate to his movie roles, movie roles arenât interesting unless u can relate to em. Whatâs a very human movie u enjoyed of Stewartâs rob?\n\nLankyweasel635 said on 24/Feb/23\n\n@Henrik - Even though he tended to wear his pants on his natural waist which is usually around the level of the naval and can even be an inch higher on some, even if he wore them a couple inches lower, below the naval, he would still be a leggy fellow. Conan O'Brien and Ru Paul have similar builds to him and that is something that many a tall person and often basketball players can identify with, myself included. In fact, when my wife first watched It's A Wonderful Life with me she drew the parallels between us right away. Ha! Regardless, he was definitely someone who had longer legs and a shorter torso, was a great actor, and a pretty decent human being too.\n\nRampage(-_-_-)Clover said on 30/Jan/23\n\nStewart still looked around 6ft3 in later years.\n\nPeak: Somewhere within 191-191.5cm zone and 193cm out of bed (same goes for Cooper).\n\nHenrik said on 29/Jan/23\n\nJust watched Vertigo. He had some really long legs. Compare him to John Wayne and his legs would absolutely dwarf Wayne's.\n\nClick Here\n\nArch Stanton said on 24/Jan/23\n\nAirport 77 it was, there was Airport 1975, but it was released in 1974, that's what I was thinking of...\n\nArch Stanton said on 24/Jan/23\n\nIn one of the Airport films, was it 74 or 77, Stewart looked about 2 inches shorter than Georne Kennedy, so likely nearer 6'2 by that time, though didn't he have the edge on John Wayne in his last film?, can't quite remember.\n\nberta said on 24/Jan/23\n\ni saw the classic vertigo couple days ago. Great twist at the end. I have said a couple times that 192 cm is very likely but i got a legit 6Â´3 feeling from wathing the movie. He was still at peak in it. 6Â´3 is a goo dlisting. He was extemelly skinny and that helped him looking taller. I tihnk 6Â´3 or 1/4 over was his peak height. 192 or over is harder to argue. and under 190 cm just seems imposbbile.\n\nArch Stanton said on 21/Jan/23\n\nWatch his 30s films, often looked 6'3.5 back then.\n\nArch Stanton said on 21/Jan/23\n\nJamesFreakingBond said on 8/Aug/21\n\nHe was 6'3 in his prime? Wow, I saw Vertigo the other day and I saw him more as strong 6'1, weak 6'2 range. He probably lost some height by Vertigo, so I'll say strong 6'2 range in his peak.\n\nJimmy was still looking 6 ft 3 in his 60s films IMO, he was only about 49 or 50 when Vertigo was shot.\n\nLankyweasel635 said on 27/Dec/22\n\nWhere's this last quote from Rob?\n\n\"Jimmy Stewart tells lies about his height and weight like some women we know prevaricate about their age.\n\n\"I give a different answer every time. As far as I can remember now, I weigh 150 pounds, and I'm 6 foot, 2-something tall.\"\n\nJust curious\n\nEditor Rob\n\nThe Atlanta Constitution (and Evening World-Herald), late November 1940.\n\nSlim1.75m said on 28/Jul/22\n\nSo he grew 2.25 inches in his adulthood wow the man's a wizard.\n\nEast wind said on 17/Jun/22\n\nHe was 6 3 with shoes obvious\n\nfdftddfd said on 14/May/22\n\nseems tall\n\nLankyweasel635 said on 27/Apr/22\n\nWhen the talent scout at MGM first saw him at Princeton, he described him as being 6'4\", and when he started in Hollywood he was described as 6'4\" in movies like Born To Dance, and 6'3\" in various publications. He himself described himself as 6'3-1/2\" when he was sent to the weight room in the beginning of his career and in the later half of his career when he recorded the Harvey VHS and DVD opening.\n\nRegardless, whether he was 6'4\", 6'3-1/2\", or 6'3\", he definitely retained most of his height in old age, and was a great actor.\n\nBlack Noir said on 10/Mar/22\n\nHey rob is it possible James didnât lose much height in his mid 80s? He looked 188 cm or 189 cm\n\nEditor Rob\n\nHe held up quite well into his 70's and even by early 80's still looked a tall guy.\n\nRampage(-_-_-)Clover said on 8/Nov/21\n\nStewart and Cooper were strong 6ft3 guys, Eastwood a weak 6ft4\n\nArch Stanton said on 21/Oct/21\n\nEastwood looked taller than Stewart did. I think of Eastwood as more a weak 6'4, Stewart more a solid 6'3.\n\nberta said on 21/Oct/21\n\ni think he was 191,5 he and clint eastwood was probably the exact same height 50 years ago.\n\nviper said on 9/Sep/21\n\nStewart looks an easy 6-3 there with Perkins\n\nArch Stanton said on 7/Sep/21\n\nSo even in 1964 he was only 162 pounds. 11 and a half stone for a 6 ft 3 fella! About Brad Pitt's weight and he's thin at 5 ft 11!\n\nTall Sam said on 12/Aug/21\n\nHe couldâve easily passed as 6â3.25â-6â3.5â there wasnât much height between him and Gary Cooper nor John Wayne, these three were like the 3 towers of old school movie stars.\n\nHong said on 11/Aug/21\n\nHe looked a comfortable 6ft3 too me,in fact I would guess him more 6ft3.5 range,and even in his 80s was looking a solid 6ft2 range.\n\nJamesFreakingBond said on 8/Aug/21\n\nHe was 6'3 in his prime? Wow, I saw Vertigo the other day and I saw him more as strong 6'1, weak 6'2 range. He probably lost some height by Vertigo, so I'll say strong 6'2 range in his peak.\n\nHong said on 6/Aug/21\n\nClick Here Here's Stewart with 6ft1.5 listed Tony Perkins,even at the age of 83 he's still looking a solid 6ft2 or maybe a bit more,but at 58 Perkins my have lost a fraction by then.\n\nTall Sam said on 18/Apr/21\n\nYeah, Stewartâs an odd case that held onto his height very well into old age.\n\nHong said on 16/Apr/21\n\nClick Here Here's an elderly Stewart whit an elderly Grant,Stewart is still looking tall.\n\nTall In The Saddle said on 9/Apr/21\n\n@Hong\n\nNice clip. LOL. I have seen it before. Though legends, Jimmy and Orson were good sports without aloof pretensions though Orson could weave some yarns. To think that Orson Welle's height was, early in his career, was claimed to be as high as 6'4\". Quite the inflation.\n\nHong said on 5/Apr/21\n\nClick Here Here's a rare clip.\n\nHeight Guesser said on 19/Mar/21\n\nsolid 191 cm/6' 3 1/4\" peak. Looked almost 6' 4\" in shoes.\n\nTall In The Saddle said on 27/Feb/21\n\nStewart also appeared to hold most if not all of his peak height well into older age.\n\nHe was obviously taller than Cary Grant when both were at peak but years later, when they appeared as presenters at the Oscars, the difference between the two was notably that much greater again. I'd say Grant had lost an average amount of height while Jimmy's retention of height was above average.\n\nHere's a couple of celebrities you wouldn't necessarily expect to find in a photo together. A sweet pic of 80 year old Stewart with 46 year old Muhammad Ali in 1988. Jim's slightly closer to camera but taking that into account and allowing for Jim raising his head, a fair argument to be made that he would've still edged Ali. Height only. At his peak weight in boxing, Jimmy would've landed in the Welterweight Class!\n\nClick Here\n\n5'10 Dude said on 24/Feb/21\n\nI think that Pete is probably right that they put down 6'1Â¾ to 6'2 on his physical so that he could be a pilot. I can't see Jimmy Stewart being under 6'3 because he appears less than an inch shorter than John Wayne. He was very tall in his day and would still be in today's world.\n\nHong said on 18/Feb/21\n\nMaybe his height to weight ratio was not compatible,he was maybe to light at 6ft3 so they reduced his height to match that up.\n\nLankyweasel635 said on 17/Feb/21\n\nAlthough I could not confirm whether the system mentioned in this but according to a search, \"Under the previous Medical Standards Directory requirement, the height requirement to become an Air Force pilot was a standing height of 64 inches to 77 inches (5â4â to 6â5â) and a sitting height of 34 to 40 inches.\"\n\nBut since that article, all military, navy, airforce, etc, just have height and weight standards from 4ft 10in through to 6ft 8in, but do note that if someone is within minimum weight requirements, if they are shorter or taller, than they have to be further evaluated to determine if they are fit for service.\n\nHowever, during WWII, it could be quite possible that there were some additional height limitations.\n\nRegardless, Mr Stewart being under or less than 6ft 3in seems unreasonable, especially seeing as he probably was actually 6ft 3.5in if not 6ft 4in at least at some point in his youth, if not during other periods in his life too, and the fact that he holds up so well with other known height individuals.\n\nArch Stanton said on 15/Feb/21\n\nYeah 6'1.75 would mean big downgrades for everybody!! That's a great point actually Pete, 6'2 cut off point to be a pilot back then, might well have been downgraded!!\n\nTall Sam said on 14/Feb/21\n\nThis is my first comment in a few months. These height records for Stewart are interesting and a bit vexing. I think its legit that Rob continues to list his height as 6'3\", if he was 6'1.75\" nearly all of his co-stars would be overlisted in comparison.\n\nPete Mulholland said on 9/Feb/21\n\nOn some of Stewart's early military medical records that show him around 6'2\", this may be due to the military (I think) had a 6'2\" cut-off to be a pilot - so Jimmy could have collaborated with doctors to do a little under estimating of his height....\n\nTall In The Saddle said on 7/Feb/21\n\nIn terms of judging Stewart's height relative to another celebrity of reasonably known height, here's a photo of Stewart right with Jack Carson left. IMO, Carson was as solid a 6'2\" as you could wish for. Jimmy has an easy 1\" on Carson with fair argument for an advantage of up to a 1 1/2\".\n\ntinyurl.com/hd0cn4dy\n\nTall In The Saddle said on 7/Feb/21\n\n@Rob\n\nTrue, for Grant, 6'1/2\" barefoot, 6'1 1/2\" shoes makes sense. Perhaps a bit more extra height than you'd expect from an average dress shoe heel but possibly also involving a round up to the next half inch.\n\nAny chance you could provide a link to the US Govt. site you use and tips for efficient searching? Thanks in advance.\n\nJtm said on 6/Feb/21\n\nHe supposedly had good posture when he was measured under 6â2! The only explanation is that the 1942 and 1845 physical examinations was a lie so he could continue to get more roles and I really doubt they would want to risk doing something like that.\n\nTall In The Saddle said on 6/Feb/21\n\nIMO, James Stewart was 6'3\" minimum. I don't think the newly presented military documentation puts his listed height into any serious question for downgrading. Rather, the variance in military records clearly speaks for itself, discrediting the validity of such records, at least in this instance.\n\nHeston is listed at 6'2 1/2\" peak. Stewart was taller. By at least 1/2\". Stewart was also 15 years senior to Heston. This 1961 photo shows Stewart as the taller of the two, Stewart age 53, Heston age 38. IMO, Jimmy has a touch of extra height in potential if stood as straight as Heston. There is also some possibility that Jimmy had lost a fraction of height by that time.\n\nClick Here\n\nI thought of Vincent Price as a reliable yardstick. Unfortunately, I could only find one photo for comparison. Not perfect, but something to chew over and Jimmy appears to be holding up well for an easy 6'3\". Not sure of the year on this one but in terms of age, just 3 years separated the two men.\n\nClick Here\n\nI also believe Cary Grant was actually 6' 1/2\" peak with the possibility of 6'1\" absolute max. Stewart was easily taller in THE PHILADELPHIA STORY by a good 2\" +. Comparing them in later age is problematic given height loss or lack thereof for either man. However, in older age Stewart, at the Oscars alongside Grant, was still clearly taller than 4 years senior Grant, and perhaps rocking even more than peak, pushing up to a 3\" advantage IMO.\n\nTidbit. In the movie THE PHILADELPHIA STORY Katherine Hepburn refers to Stewart's character as a tower of strength. Grant's character sarcastically replies with something along the lines of \"Let's just say a TOWER\". Obviously that implied Stewart to be a notably tall man and that much taller than Grant himself. himself.\n\nEditor Rob\n\nGrant was supposed to have got a measurement of 6ft 1.5 in a 1942 physical...maybe that adds up to a shoe measurement, which would match the 6ft 1/2 on that costume file.\n\ncmillz said on 5/Feb/21\n\nI thought he was at least 6â2 range.\n\nLankyweasel635 said on 5/Feb/21\n\nLooking at pictures of him with Monty Stratton he looks 2-3 inches shorter.\n\nMonty was billed at 6'5\" and 6'6\", so let's take the average of 6'5-1/2\", and using the 2.5\" difference average it still suggests that Stewart was 6'3\".\n\nBut still those military physical measurements really raise some eyebrows.\n\nOh well. :)\n\nCanson said on 5/Feb/21\n\n@Viper: Iâve seen the opposite with the military. They round up and mismeasure in some cases. Ali Baba once said it and Iâve seen some that have claimed an inch taller although that could be variance and then being measured 1/2 inch over in the AM and rounding up\n\nviper said on 4/Feb/21\n\nIt would be hard to believe the military is as bad as these basketball camps lol\n\nLankyweasel635 said on 4/Feb/21\n\n@Rob\n\nThat range of 6ft 1.75in and 6ft 4in is definitely a surprise indeed. It could be interesting to see where this rabbit hole leads.\n\nA person can still have good posture or look like they have good posture and slouch multiple inches, and then there is the possibility for measurements being taken at different times too, but maybe there were some significant postural issues at points and they eventually improved over time.\n\nRegardless, based upon all the different celebrities on here, all the claims, and the documents provided, averaging all of them out, there could be a suggestion that he was only 6ft 2.75in or 190cm, but personally, I would tend to think that his listed and generally accepted height of 6ft 3in without shoes, would be a safe bet.\n\nWhere/how did you get all this information?\n\nRegardless, still a great actor, a tall man, and fine fellow based on all of the biographies read and interviews watched.\n\nEditor Rob\n\nIt's searchable on the US Government archives site.\n\nRory said on 3/Feb/21\n\nCould it be possible he was measured 74.75 inches, maybe at a low, and then this was incorrectly put down as 73.75 ? Mind you that wouldn't account for the other 6ft2 description, and a mistake like that is unlikely to be made twice... I guess seeing as we never met or measured James Stewart if you end up half an inch to an inch out in your guess its not hugely shocking say if he was 6ft2.5. 6ft1.75 though would be astonishing.\n\nEditor Rob\n\na real height mystery, even in elder age he could still have edged out Charlton heston and he was what, 15 years older than Chuck?\n\nOutlaw said on 3/Feb/21\n\nThose military medical records are good finds and also baffling. Even the military isn't infallible. I mean, come on, one had him at 65 inches (typo, naturally). And unless we're going to start in on how James Stewart was a lift wearer, I personally don't believe he was any less than 6'3\" in his prime. In fact, I'd go for 6'3.25\"-6'3.5\". That's just me, of course. He's claimed 6'4\" and 6'3\", so for me, I'll say he's in the middle.\n\nw/ 6'5\" Rock Hudson: tinyurl.com/3yotbyo8 - if Stewart were standing tall, I believe there would be less than 2\" between them.\n\nw/ 6'1\" Henry Fonda: tinyurl.com/udjh69yh - I can't see how there'd be any less than 2\" there. Looks like more to me.\n\nw/ 6'2.75\" Cesar Romero and 6'2.5\" Charlton Heston: tinyurl.com/2epwp3dh - yeah, I know they were all rather old here, but Stewart still appears to be the tallest\n\nw/ 5'11.5\" Robert Wagner: tinyurl.com/3qznttyn - Stewart is about 79 here and still looks around 3\" taller.\n\nw/ 6'0.5\" Ronald Reagan: tinyurl.com/bh1mrv20 - I know Reagan was older and had likely dropped height by this point, but Stewart was 3 years older and definitely clears 3 inches on him.\n\nCanson said on 2/Feb/21\n\n@Editor Rob: physically he does look more like a 6â3 guy than 6â1 so to speak but he could be in the 6â2-6â3 range perhaps if the measurements were all over the place like that. Iâd be surprised if that 6â1.75 were accurate based on how he appears. I wouldâve assumed closer to 6â3 myself. Then again Iâve seen pics of people around my height and assumed they were taller or shorter than they actually were based on body proportions. Being lanky makes you appear taller than you are\n\nHong said on 2/Feb/21\n\nYes Rob he did always seem a tall guy 6ft3 seemed very believable too me,as low as 6ft1.75? seems unlikely.\n\nArch Stanton said on 2/Feb/21\n\nI'd go as far as to say guys like Jimmy and Gary Cooper were textbook examples of how a proper 6'3 looked in the Golden Period.\n\nArch Stanton said on 2/Feb/21\n\n6 ft 1.75?? No chance. He got a 6'4, two 6'3s a 6'2 and a 6'1.75, all over the place. 6'1.75 does seem precise but he generally looked a solid 6'3 guy, not even as low as a 6'2 ranger like Heston.\n\nJtm said on 2/Feb/21\n\nNeeds a downgrade\n\nHong said on 1/Feb/21\n\nIt seems both physicals from 1942 to 1945 are very similar,could it be that he was 6ft2 all along,if that was the case it would mean a downgrade for many actors he acted along side during his career,like John Wayne and Cary Grant for example.\n\nEditor Rob\n\nat least it's documented for people to decide. Even I'm not so sure, I always would have said he could look nearer 6ft 3 than 2.\n\nviper said on 1/Feb/21\n\nWhat's interesting about the 6-1.75 measurement is that it specifically says his posture is good\n\nviper said on 1/Feb/21\n\nFrankR1 said on 23/Sep/20\n\nJimmy Stewart was 6'3\"?! And he claimed that he used to be 6'4\"?! That's hard to believe. He didn't look a quarter-inch over 6'1\" in It's A Wonderful Life. He might have been close to 6'2\" (peak), but I seriously doubt that he was close enough to 6'4\" to round up.\n\nYou really think he only looks 6-1 in that movie? Would guess he looks 6-2 range at the very minimum\n\n184guy2 said on 31/Jan/21\n\nlot Rob put the Arithmetic Mean between 6'2 and 6'4\n\n6'3 haha\n\nHong said on 31/Jan/21\n\nWow Rob he grew 2.25 inches from aged 34 to 56 he's a medical miracle.\n\nCanson said on 31/Jan/21\n\n@Editor Rob: hmm! such a variance with his height on his physicals? Iâm not sure if he slouched. I say it because his first two were close 6â1.75 and 6â2. Even the 6â1.75 was when he wouldâve been mid 30s (34) and full grown? Then he grew when he was 56? Lol I guess Donald Trump took the same therapeutics he took to grow from 6â2 to 6â3 at a late age. Wonder if one was in shoes ð ð\n\nBut itâs hard to tell suffice to say he was never 6â4 and even 6â3 is questionable although he can look it more so than 6â1.75 Maybe 6â2-6â3 range but itâs hard to see less than that\n\nClick Here\n\nEditor Rob\n\nMistakes are possible, but yeah, the fact he had those 2 army measurements, 1/4 inch apart is an eyebrow raiser.\n\nThe army aren't going to be putting down made up heights are they?\n\nTrump had his self-reported height put on his medical...he was never really measured 6ft 3 ;)\n\nMaybe that could explain the 6ft 4, as Stewart did claim that mark at one point. I always believed that in shoes was likely.\n\nEditor Rob said on 31/Jan/21\n\nI've updated Stewart's page with screencaps of the various Heights he was reported at.\n\nAs I say, as tall as 6ft 4, as short as 6ft 1.75...\n\nLankyweasel635 said on 29/Jan/21\n\n@Daycringeothon\n\nThank you for your comments. Yes there are a multitude of conditions that tall people may have. Thankfully, although I am very disproportionate and built much taller than I am, used to be, and even than I would/should be if everything could be fixed, as per the numerous scans and medical measurements, my legs are the exact same length as each other.\n\n@Arch Stanton\n\nWish it was as simple and easy as a retractable musical stand, then I could just set it and forget it.\n\nHowever, it's my reality, and I try the best I can to deal with and combat it, and my various other health issues. But we all have our various crosses to bare, so it could be worse.\n\nRegardless, there's no need to continue this discussion on this fine actor's page of this light-hearted website that casually discusses celebrity heights.\n\nJames Stewart was an excellent actor, a fine fellow, and according to numerous biographies recalling his initial workout routine to bulk up when he first started in hollywood, and according to his own introduction to the Harvey movie (I have it), he was 6ft 3.5n tall, or at least at some point in his life he was. In the pre-movie intro, he states that he considered Harvey to be 6ft 8in tall so he would have to look up at him, given that he himself was 6ft 3.5in tall.\n\nBut he was considered 6ft 3in by the military when he enlisted as they required him to meet the 143 lbs minimum weight which was the minimum for 6ft 3in, and 148 was the minimum for 6ft 4in, and Stewart was 138 Lbs when he first got weighed for his military physical. So he may not have measured 6ft 3.5in at his physical. Wonder if Rob can find his records like he did for Henry Fonda.\n\nAnd according to the curator of the Jimmy Stewart museum he was 6ft 3in tall.\n\nEither way he was at least a strong solid 6ft 3in tall and an excellent actor.\n\nEditor Rob\n\n\"Wonder if Rob can find his records like he did for Henry Fonda.\"\n\ndo people want to take the blue or red height pill.\n\nTake the Blue, accept Stewart as 6ft 3 and never visit this site again...\n\nIf you want the red pill, well grab yourself a cup of water (or whiskey) and sit yourself down.\n\nThe truth about Jimmy Stewart's height is more of a mystery than I anticipated ... after digging into it, some of his Height recordings are eyebrow raising.\n\n1964 Examination by A Chicago Doctor.\n\nHeight recorded as 6ft 4, weight 161 pounds.\n\n1950 Examination in California\n\nHeight: 6ft 3, Weight 165 pounds.\n\n1944 Physical\n\nWeight 145 pounds.

Height 74 inches\n\nI mean this isn't some random person on an obscure forum pulling figures out of thin air. This is Rob Paul with 100% real figures - easily verifiable - like for instance this example...\n\nSo was he really that short? Not many (including myself) would have imagined 6ft 2 let alone 6ft 1.75 ð²\n\nCould he have been undermeasured?\n\nOr what if he slouched on purpose to drop some height (what with weight requirements)?\n\nIt really is a rabbit hole on Stewart's Height.\n\nDaycringeothon said on 3/Jan/21\n\nVery interesting about your condition Lankyweasel635. I know thereâs very tall people out there who can have one leg much longer than the other. Sometimes linear growth doesnât go as smoothly for some so they end up with one much longer leg. Unfortunately this asymmetry of the legs can cause future problems standing and walking.\n\nHeight_Guesser said on 23/Dec/20\n\nLooked a little under 6â 3â peak.

He might have been close to 6'2\" (peak), but I seriously doubt that he was close enough to 6'4\" to round up.\n\nLankyweasel635 said on 22/Aug/20\n\n@ Miss Sandy Cowell\n\nThe answer to your question is: 5ft 7in. Ha! I'm kidding.\n\nThe answer actually is: It depends. :)\n\nMy variance between morning and night is significant as it has been a morning high max of 6ft 6.5in and an absolute night low of 6ft 2.75in, and in general usually varied between a morning height max of 6ft 6in and an evening high low 6ft 3in.\n\nHowever, when I stopped growing I was 6ft 5in, but I have a unique to me muscle condition that shortly after I stopped growing, kicked in, and has caused me to shrink/re-grow half a dozen time over the past 20 years, and will probably continue to do so until I am no longer on this planet.\n\nHowever, although I had regained to being 6ft 5in at night after 16 hours of being awake, recent events re-aggravated and accelerated my condition, such that I am only 6ft 3.5in now, which the doctors then round down to 6ft 3in, but I am built much taller than I am rather very disproportionately so, such that I am built like someone 6ft 10in as is, and in fact, if they could fix everything I would be 6ft 10in tall built like 7ft 6in tall. However, we come in all shapes and sizes so, oh well.\n\nEither way, now because of my shrinkage I am a little closer to everyone else and just a tiny 6ft 3.5in fellow who rounds down more often then up, but admits to both, and whether or not I will be able to regain any of my lost height and maintain it before either my condition or nature takes it away from me again is to be determined.\n\nRegardless, most people do not like my answer and insist that I am at least 6ft 5in if not 6ft 7in tall, with a few having guessed me at 6ft 8in and one at 7ft, which made me laugh to say the least. But that seems to be because there are many people that are multiple inches off of their height, as I have met many supposedly 6ft 3in tall men who are at least two to four inches shorter than me, but I figure rather than argue with them like I have done from time to time, it is a waste of energy and really does not matter in the grand scheme of things, and is not really a big deal, pun intended, so although I used to be 6ft 5in, now I am only 6ft 3.5in, and I just thank them for the upgrade and keep on answering 5ft 7in or at least that I was at one point and now I am little taller than that, then walk away, and smile. :)\n\nHave a great day.\n\nStay safe, stay sane, keep busy, and keep on being awesome.\n\nGerry :)\n\nMiss Sandy Cowell said on 22/Aug/20\n\n@ Lankyweasel635 - I like your name!

Good looks, height, an acting career....\n\nSome guys really do have all their eggs in one basket!\n\nð¥ð¥ð¥\n\n..ð..\n\nLankyweasel635 said on 20/Aug/20\n\nIn Roy Pickard's 1993 biography of James Stewart, his height related to his WWII weight requirements is listed as being 6ft 4in.\n\nHe was also referenced as 6ft 4in in the 1936 movie Born To Dance.\n\nSticking with he was 6ft 3in / 6ft 4in and probably was 6ft 3.5in but more often than not rounded down, and/or measured 6ft 3in more often than 6ft 4in and was probably even 6ft 3in at night, so definitely a solid strong 6ft 3in tall.\n\nLankyweasel635 said on 14/Aug/20\n\nIn Jhan Robbins biography of Jimmy Stewart, it details early on in his career when Stewart was sent to the studio gym to try to put on weight, when they ask him height he stated \"six foot three and a half\" and when for weight he stated \"130 lbs\".\n\nStewart may have been 6ft 4in at one point or at least measured it once, but also measured 6ft 3in at times, and probably had a 6ft 4in morning height and a 6ft 3in evening height, and a midday height of 6ft 3.5in.\n\nLikely he was rounded down by doctors since medical science rounds down the half whereas math rounds it up, and at 6ft 3.5in he usually said exactly that figure or rounded down or up depending on his mood and how he felt that day.\n\nEither way, at 6ft 3.5in tall, instead of being considered a weak 6ft 4in, he was a strong solid 6ft 3in tall.\n\nLankyweasel635 said on 10/Aug/20\n\nLook at him beside Fred Gwynne in the 1972 version of Harvey. Gwynne was 6ft 5in and stated himself as being 6ft 6in and Stewart looks close very to him in height. Dare say a solid 6ft 3in, and his 6ft 3.5in claim is probably also solid and valid too.\n\nArch Stanton said on 2/Aug/20\n\nPot o Gold too, even Jimmy thought that film was his worst!\n\nArch Stanton said on 2/Aug/20\n\nStewart and Cary Grant are extremely rare in that virtually every film of theirs is good, they made films which would be mediocre with lesser actors in them great. I think Malaya was the only film of Stewart's I wasn't fussy on. Yeah he looked easily 6'3 in general though in Rope you could argue he looked under the 6'3 mark with John Dall.\n\nTall Sam said on 8/Jul/20\n\nIt's odd to me that some people see him as a weak 6'3\". At what time did he actually look under the mark? Even in old age, he still looked close to the same height as Clint Eastwood.\n\nOriginalAnon said on 5/Jul/20\n\nHe was my favourite actor of the era. May have been 190cm flat, as opposed to a full 190.5cm 6'3''.\n\nMiss Sandy Cowell said on 20/May/20\n\nJimmy was born 112 years ago. I found him written up as James Stewart, but it simply has to be the same guy because you don't find many James Stewarts who stand 191cm tall, which matches Rob's figure perfectly! Jimmy lived to the age of 89.\n\n6ft3 ðð\n\nRIP Jimmy XX ð¯ï¸\n\nTall Sam said on 8/Apr/20\n\nI think he was certainly not imposing despite being tall. However, weakling is a bit harsh, he was an active duty Air Force soldier well after beginning his career as an actor, so presumably had a baseline level of fitness. In terms of Western roles, he certainly was miscast as a roughed woodsman in How the West Was Won but in Stewart's best Westerns like his Anthony Mann films and Liberty Valance he was one of the few western stars to be routinely overpowered and humiliated, often winning in the end by just outgunning his adversary. Eastwood in Unforgiven as the less than heroic protagonist (who is also beaten and humiliated by Gene Hackman) feels like it's in the tradition of the Stewart-Mann films.\n\nIan C. said on 6/Apr/20\n\nCertainly tall, and with a handsome face, but Stewart was very nearly a physical weakling. He made quite a few westerns, and made them well, but he was just too thin and awkward to pull off being the hero of a western. If you look at contemporary pictures of real cowboys and soldiers from the America West, they all seem to have the same basic physique. They're squarely built, strong, athletic-looking men, and almost all of the have moustaches. None of them were built like Stewart.\n\nOn the other hand, there are hundreds of pictures of Civil War soldiers, and many of them seem emaciated. This was probably the natural effect of near-starvation, and marching a hundred miles every week. Stewart, when well-fed and rested, could have credibly played an infantryman in the Union Army at Shiloh or Antietam.\n\nCanson said on 26/Mar/20\n\n@Rampage: thatâs certainly possible in his prime\n\nRampage(-_-_-)Clover said on 25/Mar/20\n\n6ft3-3Â¼ is possible peak (w/h 6ft4 out of bed)\n\nRampage(-_-_-)Clover said on 16/Dec/19\n\n'I used to be 6-foot-4, but I'm shrinking'\"\n\nInteresting quote. Kudos to whoever found it. Could he have in fact been a guy who initially rounded down but later admitted to being taller? Like Paul Bettany.\n\nEditor Rob\n\nThat would be me, from the newspaper archives. I think I exhausted a lot of quotes, though there are probably still quite a few surprises out there hidden waiting to be found...\n\nRampage(-_-_-)Clover said on 17/Nov/19\n\nBoth Cooper and Stewart could have been a little over 6ft3\n\nIan C. said on 10/May/19\n\nNotice that, despite Stewart's great height, no one has ever called him \"big.\" He is in fact a little guy with a long body (135 pounds qualifies as little, I'd say,) although nobody ever called him little either.\n\nAre there actors who are not especially tall but whom people call big? Well, let's see: Boris Karloff seems gigantic in Frankenstein, even though he wasn't quite six feet tall. Robert Shaw seems big in From Russia With Love. Oliver Reed seems big in everything. What these guys have is large, strong heads and nasty, violent movie personalities.\n\nArch Stanton said on 19/Mar/19\n\nNah in looking again it's about 3 inches maybe Arness was 6'6 then.\n\nArch Stanton said on 19/Mar/19\n\nWatching Carbine Williams and James Arness honestly looked about 3.5-4 inches taller. So odd to see somebody markedly taller than him but seeing them together. If Arness was just 6'6 flat Jimmy looked no more than 6'2.5. Could Arness have been more 6'6.5 Rob?\n\nNeelasish Send Roy said on 10/Mar/19\n\nHe might be 6'3\" at peak but in 1942 he was measured as 6'2.5\". But in a picture I had seen Stewart is 2 inches taller than 6'1\" Errol Flynn& in another photo he looks 1 inch taller Than Basil Rathbone who may be 6'1.6\"-6'2\" and 2 inches taller than 6'1\" Robert Montgomery may Rathbone was 6'2\"?\n\nMark Harrison said on 18/Nov/18\n\nLee Marvin was 6'1\".\n\nDave1 said on 2/Nov/18\n\nStewart was tall and lanky. His thin frame gave the illusion of added height. He was most likely in the 6â2â-6â2 1/2â range. John Wayne was pretty similar. Watch the film .... The Man Who Shot Liberty Vallance......Lee Marvin was a verified 6â2â. Wayne & Stewart look maybe 1/2â taller in all scenes. Gary Cooper was also lanky, but a solid 6â3â, perhaps another 1/2â in his prime. Cary Grant was 6â 1â. Later in life..... 6â. Gregory Peck was 6â3â easy. Robert Mitchum was 6â 1 1/2 â.\n\nMister lennon said on 20/Oct/18\n\nLess than 6'3 is totally unlikely.\n\nTall Sam said on 17/Oct/18\n\nA lot of co-stars would have to be downgraded if Stewart was only 6'2\", I definitely don't see it.\n\nMister lennon said on 16/Aug/18\n\nStewart was a solid 6'3 guy. Grant a solid 6'1 guy. That was they looked in the philadelphia story\n\nNeelasish Sen Roy said on 15/Aug/18\n\nHe was never 6'4\" tall.

Iam right or wrong,Rob?\n\nTall In The Saddle said on 6/Aug/18\n\n@Mark Harrison - not challenging you but I am just curious as to what evidence you have seen to indicate that Eastwood was taller than Stewart - I've seen a few pics but at least several that I have seen clearly imply Eastwood to be standing on higher ground IMO - even if Eastwood was taller in some measure he couldn't have held the advantage these pics appear to suggest. I've linked one such pic:-\n\nClick Here\n\nMark Harrison said on 5/Aug/18\n\nEastwood was taller than Stewart.\n\nMister lennon said on 3/Aug/18\n\nMaybe 191-192 peak.\n\nTall In The Saddle said on 31/Jul/18\n\n1959 pic of 50/51 yo James Stewart appearing to rock a marked height advantage over boxer Henry Cooper -listed 6'1.5\" on this site.

As a kid I never really thought of his height - just perceived a fairly tall extremely thin guy whose great acting was the focal point. Only later came to realise that he was a bit more than just fairly tall and always felt that he edged Coop. Here's a link to his intro on the Johnny Carson show - IMO nothing substantial to choose between 80/81 yo Stewart and 66 yo Ed McMahon (latter at least 6'3.5\" peak imo), both of whom you would assume had lost height by this stage but Jimmy more so. If pressed I might give Stewart the slightest edge over McMahon but can settle for close enough to even. Both guys had nice straight posture well into their later years.\n\nClick here - Click Here\n\nFor perspective, 4 years later, 69 yo McMahon appeared to have about .5\" advantage over a less posture perfect 63 yo Clint Eastwood.\n\nTall Sam said on 18/Apr/18\n\nMe as well, I've said several times that Stewart at peak could've well been 192 cm/6'3.25\" at peak.\n\nberta said on 17/Apr/18\n\ni agree Gonzalo he lokeed like a 192 man to me.\n\nGonzalo said on 4/Apr/18\n\nIt puzzles me how people here guess Stewart to be under 1`90.

His last public appearance was for a ceremony honouring his career in February 1961, when his terminal cancer was still not publicly known.\n\nJames said on 26/Jul/17\n\nCooper wore lifts in his later films, which is why he looked four inches taller than six foot Richard Harris.\n\nMister lennon said on 26/Jul/17\n\nYes,he was. He looked every bit of a strong 6'3 guy at his peak. Boots or not boots.\n\nIn his late 50s and 60s he looked more in the strong 6'2-weak 6'3 range.\n\nJames said on 25/Jul/17\n\nCooper only looked above 6'3\" in films because of footwear. He was mainly known for westerns and he wore boots with big heels.\n\nJames said on 25/Jul/17\n\nNo, he wasn't.\n\nMister lennon said on 24/Jul/17\n\nNo,he was a strong 6'3\n\nJames said on 23/Jul/17\n\nNo, Cooper was exactly 6'3\".\n\nMister lennon said on 23/Jul/17\n\nCooper was more than just 6'3. About 6'3 .5 or 6'3.75.

I'm pretty sure John Wayne also claimed to be this tall in another film.\n\nWhat's strange is Jimmy Stewart looked taller than John Wayne in both The Shootist and Liberty Vallance\n\nRichardSpain said on 21/Jun/17\n\nI think he was a perfect 190cm in peak not more. I think he seems taller in screen because he had a long legs and he was thin but he wasn't 191 or 192 cm in my opinion.\n\nExcellent actor and nice blue eyes.\n\nRampage(-_-_-)Clover said on 20/Jun/17\n\nCary Grant looks near 6ft2 in that photo.\n\nJames said on 15/Jun/17\n\nHe was measured as 6'2.5\" in the Air Force.\n\nSam said on 14/Jun/17\n\n@Charlie, that was good for a laugh or, if serious, you may need your vision checked.\n\n@James, do you have a source? I haven't seen a credible source claims any less than 6'3\" for him.\n\nJames said on 11/Jun/17\n\nStewart's actual measured height in 1942 was 6'2.5\".\n\nCharlie said on 10/Jun/17\n\nI want to add one thing that supports my last comment. In the Glenn Miller Movie he approaches his Ben The leader of the Band Glenn Miller was with before he formed his own. Now Ben Pollack plays himself int he movie. Ben Pollack stood no less than 3.5 inches shorter than Jimmy Stewart. Ben Pollack was the shortest Of all his Band Members. I have him pegged at 5.6. All the photo's i came across shows his Band members almost a head taller than him and here i see Jimmy Stewart only 3.5 inches on him. It doesn't add up.Anyhow this supports my 5'10 claim for Jimmy Stewart. If anyone feels differently about my comment please look up Musician Ben Pollack with Jimmy Stewart on Google Image. Ben's head was higher than Jimmy's eyebrows. Another thing in the Movie Harvey Jimmy has a 6' imaginary Rabbit he walks around with. He later tells a Doctor that the Rabbit is more like 6'3. All through the movie you see Jimmy Stewart looking way up at the Rabbit's eyes when hes talking to him. If the Rabbit was 6'3 then the Rabbits eye level would be 5'10 but you clearly see Jimmy looking way up at this Rabbit. Jimmy was most likely 5'10.\n\nCharlie said on 10/Jun/17\n\nI just watched The Glenn Miller Story. Now we all know in Europe the average door height is 6'6 and USA and Canada the average door height is 6'8.5. Jimmy Stewart no joke was a good head and 2 inches shorter than the door in a scene where he buys a Trombone from a German Store Owner. The door height in all Retail Stores and Shops are under 6'9. He did not look 6'3 in that movie. Jimmy's head was well under the top hinge and his head was 11 inches shorter than the door. A whole head size plus 2 inches. I measured his head with a piece of Paper and lined it up with his face then i penciled in a little dot where the top of his head was at and a dot where the bottom of his head was at. Then i placed the bottom dot over top of his head and it gave m an idea how tall he was. Now many people do not realize just how tall 6'3 really is. For example i am 5'10. I have been mistaken as a 6'1 person why i will never know. I wake up measure myself back to the wall and i get the same measurements my Doctor gives me 5'10. Peoples perceptions can be way off. Statistics Canada say the average male is 5'9.5. Now in the afternoon i measured myself at 5'9.5 but i seem to tower over mot males. Then one Afternoon is asked Windows 10 Cortana the average Canadian male height and she said 5'7.So with all said i am going to go out here and say Jimmy Stewart was 5'10. In Shoes he was probably 5'11 and a quarter.\n\nEditor Rob\n\nð¤\n\nClick Here\n\nRampage(-_-_-)Clover said on 10/Jun/17\n\nHe was comfortably 6ft3 with a strong chance of measuring just over it.\n\nshiva 181 cms said on 2/May/17\n\n6'3.5 is possible only in certain footwear or might have pulled it off with his lanky frame he,s almost 6'3 like he's claimed\n\nUnsub 5'10 said on 17/Apr/17\n\nOn our merry way( 1948) he really looked 6'3.5 next to Fonda, aprox. 2.75\" taller than him, extremely tall, and made Fonda look 6'1\", I'd rather say 1.85m.\n\nArch Stanton said on 1/Apr/17\n\nIn the 1930s I could really believe 6'3.5.\n\nUnsub 5'10 said on 28/Mar/17\n\nPeak height 1.92m, 6'3.5\", that's what he claimed.\n\nmister_lennon said on 24/Mar/17\n\nStewart was 6'3 minimum.\n\nJames said on 19/Jan/17\n\nI wrote he was 6'2.5\", not 6'2\".\n\nmister_lennon said on 18/Jan/17\n\nHe was 6'3 in normal shoes. 6'2 for stewart is just trolling.\n\nJames said on 16/Jan/17\n\nHe was only over 6'3\" with cowboy boots.\n\nmister_lennon said on 16/Jan/17\n\nStewart was a solid 6'3 guy. 191-192.\n\nmister_lennon said on 15/Jan/17\n\nNo less than 191 peak.\n\nJames said on 14/Jan/17\n\nHe was 190 at his peak.\n\nmister_lennon said on 13/Jan/17\n\n191-192 peak\n\nJames said on 11/Jan/17\n\nStewart was less than 6'3\".\n\nberta said on 10/Jan/17\n\nthis is one of the guy i think was rounding down instead of up. to me he looked 192\n\nRampage(-_-_-)Clover said on 5/Dec/16\n\nStewart & Cooper: 191-192cm\n\nPeck & Heston: 189-190cm\n\nJames said on 27/Oct/16\n\nStewart was 6'3\" at his peak.\n\nUnsub 5'10 said on 26/Oct/16\n\nStewart was nothing under 6'3.25\"\n\nJames said on 6/Aug/16\n\nCooper put two stone on later life.\n\nRampage(-_-_-)Clover said on 2/Aug/16\n\nStewart and Cooper were both painfully thin for 6ft3\n\nFriendlyNeighborhood6Footer said on 7/Jul/16\n\nJimmy Stewart is my favorite actor. I have too many favorites of his to list, with Vertigo and It's a Wonderful Life being at the top of the list. I've seen most of his filmography, many of them more than once. I've always pegged him at a little over 6'3\". I'd be surprised if he came in at just 6'3\" given all the 6'3\" actors I've seen him have a hair or two over.\n\nJames said on 1/Jul/16\n\nDean Martin should have been the romantic lead in \"Rio Bravo\".\n\nIan C. said on 24/Jun/16\n\nMiddle-aged men successfully courting women a generation younger than they are is practically a movie trope. Think John Wayne in Rio Bravo, for example. He was nearly double Angie Dickenson's age in that one, but nobody really minds much, because he's John Wayne, and we are supposed to close the gap between what he was and what he has become in order to follow the movie. Most male move stars over forty habitually play somebody who is roughly 32.\n\nAnd six feet tall, if they are shorter than that. All Paul Newman's characters were six feet tall. And Kirk Douglas's and Dean Martin's and Humphrey Bogart's.\n\nSometimes I wonder what the typical leading man movie character's I.Q. is. Right around 125, usually. This is probably pretty close to the real I.Q. score of most movie leading men. Clearly smarter than average, but not intellectual. John Wayne did not play stupid men, but he did not play men who read a lot of books either.\n\nSam said on 22/Jun/16\n\nI don't agree with that, perfect in both Window and especially Vertigo...his characters were more romantic leads in their own middle-aged minds. They rank along with Stewart's best performances along with Mr. Smith, Wonderful Life, Harvey and anything he did with Anthony Mann.\n\nTom said on 21/Jun/16\n\nStewart was badly miscast in \"Rear Window\" and \"Vertigo\", he was far too old to play the romantic lead.\n\nArch Stanton said on 18/Jun/16\n\nOK guys, I'm sure Rob is with me on this, lets talk about Kim Novak in those green shoes now ;-)\n\nEditor Rob\n\nlovely shoes indeed!\n\nGonzalo said on 17/Jun/16\n\nWillam Holden appeared shirtless in several movies, such as Picnic (shaved) or The bridge over river Kwai. In the 50`s it was more common to appeared shirtless, meanwhile it was very rare in the 30`s and 40`s, when it only happened in adventure films (Mutiny on the bounty). In the fifties and sixties there are many examples: Holden, Douglas, Hudson, Curtis, Lancaster, Jeffrey Hunter, Heston, Mitchum (Heaven knows Mrs. Allison, Gable (Mogambo), etc. It also had to do with the fact that stars of the 30s and 40s were in his late forties or fifties while the others were in his thirties. The fifties was the beef cake era!\n\nRandolph Scott was in bathing suit in My favourite wife; he looked in great shape.\n\nStewart was skinny. Not the best guy to do a beff cake scene.\n\nArch Stanton said on 13/Jun/16\n\nCharles Bronson I think overall had the best physique out of them all, the nearest thing to a modern day MMA fighter/boxer. He was in incredible shape. Hard as nails. Bronson was more of a professional fighter type, whereas Charlton Heston a physique of somebody who spends a lot of time with outdoor pursuits, similar to Laird Hamilton, I'd guess very similar height and weight. Hston looked strong as hell in the 60s, particularly Planet of the Apes.\n\nArch Stanton said on 13/Jun/16\n\nYes I was going to say what Sam said, Jimmy appears shirtless in Read Window. It was after seeing him that that I could well believe he was just 130 pounds range in younger years, rake thin, unhealthily thin, and by Rear Window he was probably in 155-160 pounds range.\n\nIan C. said on 10/Jun/16\n\nWell Sam, if Eastwood is going to take off his shirt in his movies he'd better look good without a shirt. And he's sung in a few movies too. He shouldn't oughta have done that either, as those were also cases of undeserved self-regard.\n\nI have seen Rear Window, and that shirtless scene is arguably part of the plot. It is brief, and Stewart lies on his stomach all through it, and doesn't actually display his torso. It isn't in the movie to thrill anybody. And of course his character gets Grace Kelly, which makes my point for me, which is that it used to be that you could be a male lead without looking like that guy on the cover of Men's Health.\n\nSam said on 9/Jun/16\n\nI guess you've not seen Rear Window where Stewart is shirtless for a bit, definitely far from an ideal strapping Hollywood hunk there but he still gets Grace Kelly there...I've not spent as much time contemplating these stars physiques...kinda weird to be annoyed by Eastwood because his bone structure wasn't as good as Heston's or whatever.\n\nIan C. said on 7/Jun/16\n\nYeah, Arch, I forgot about Lancaster. But he did the muscle display routine only in his action movies, and managed to keep his shirt on in his forays into serious drama. Charles Bronson is also a major contender in the shirtless movie guy competition and he really did look terrific without a shirt on, so you can forgive him. Also, he did it less than half his roles. Eastwood has always kind of annoyed me when he did his shirtless routine because, unlike Bronson and Heston, who really were physically extraordinary, he was just an average guy who lifted weights. His hips are as wide as his shoulders, and he has bad posture. So who was he kidding?\n\nOf course Jimmy Stewart (remember him?) would have been laughed at if he gone shirtless in a movie. Stewart was, not a weakling exactly, but certainly less than average in terms of male strength and stamina. And yet he was a successful romantic lead, and sometimes a successful man of action in a few westerns, like Broken Arrow and Bend of the River.\n\nArch Stanton said on 6/Jun/16\n\nBurt Lancaster used to show off his physique a bit, even in Swimmer in 1968 when he was in his 50s! Clint Eastwood didn't take up bodybuilding at 40, he'd lifted weights in his teens and 20s too, there's a few pictures of him. Eastwood did bulk up in the 80s though and must have changed his diet and lifted heavier as in his late 50s he was in 220 pounds range.\n\nIan C. said on 5/Jun/16\n\nYes, Fruit, you've got me there about Flynn and the Sea Haw, but look at how few shirtless scenes Flynn did, when he really did have a terrific body. The larger point is that, for most male leads at that time, taking off shirts in movies to display beautiful torsos was uncommon, and probably regarded as vulgar display.\n\nIf Sinatra worked out, it wasn't out of physical vanity but professional utility, which is a different thing entirely.\n\nWhich old-time stars did show off their bodies? Not too many. Charlton Heston couldn't resist, but at the same time vigorously denied that he would ever do anything so crass as indulge in bodybuilding. Paul Newman has a few look-at-how-beautiful-I-am scenes, but in only a handful of his movies. Robert Redford the same. Sean Connery appears shirtless in all his Bond movies, but at the same time you don't get the impression that he had been dieting, or working with a trainer. In Diamonds Are Forever, he is downright paunchy.\n\nClint Eastwood avoided appearing shirtless until he was forty. He took up bodybuilding and then you couldn't keep a shirt on him until he was sixty.\n\nSylvestre Stallone is perhaps the worst offender in the gratuitous shirtless sweepstakes, aside from Arnold Schwarzenegger, for whom muscles are most of his talent.\n\nBruno said on 4/Jun/16\n\nCheck this out Ian C. and he was an older man at that stage.\n\nClick Here\n\nFruit said on 3/Jun/16\n\nErrol Flynn was also shirtless in The Sea Hawk and maybe Captain Blood (not %100 sure about that one).\n\nSinatra did work out, mainly to improve his lung capacity.\n\nIan C. said on 1/Jun/16\n\nJames B, of course Jimmy Stewart didn't hit any gyms. Nobody in his generation of movie leads did. I'm not sure if John Wayne ever made a movie where he took his shirt off. Or Cary Grant or Randolph Scott either. Errol Flynn has made only one movie where he appeared shirtless (Gentleman Jim) and in that one he played a boxer. Rock Hudson has two, and in one he played a boxer and in the other a Native American. Other leading men like Charlton Heston, who usually had a shirtless scene in any movie he made because he was so proud of his physique, did not work out. Do you think Robert Mitchum ever lifted a barbell or ran a mile? It doesn't seem likely. How about Peter O'Toole? Richard Burton? Lee Marvin? Frank Sinatra? Steve McQueen? Sean Connery? James CoburnÃ Forget it. Marlon Brando? Double forget it after he became a big star, even though much of his initial appeal was based on his physique.\n\nTom said on 5/Apr/16\n\nCooper was measured as 6'2.5\" in 1924.\n\nRampage(-_-_-)Clover said on 2/Apr/16\n\nNeither of them were under 6ft3.

I think Stewart was the ultimate though, the great directors like Hitchcock, Capra & Anthony Mann knew he was going to deliver every time with minimal direction and that's why he had such fruitful work with them and was in so many classics.\n\nJake: 1.84 m- 1.85 m said on 20/Dec/14\n\nA tad shorter than John Wayne in the timeless, marvelous classic 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance'.

Most tall guys i meet are heavy like Chris Pratt, the shorter guys like me are normal and mid-range guys skinny. @Crash yup this guy was skinny, abnormally thin in his younger days but by 1950's he had bulked up a little in the Hitchcock movies.\n\nGonzalo said on 29/Aug/14\n\nMillard Mitchell was very tall, over 1`85 for sure\n\nSam said on 21/Aug/14\n\nHere's a shot of Stewart with Millard Mitchell and Charles Drake and, not the best comparison picture, but he does look a bit taller I think than these two more than six feet guys.\n\nClick Here\n\nIan C. said on 13/Aug/14\n\nJimmy Stewart was so thin that he was rejected for military service in World War II the first time he tried to enlist. He had to go an a forced eating diet to make the threshold weight. Think what an amazing man he was to have done that. He could have sat out the War with a legitimate 4-F, but got into combat anyway. Compare this to Frank Sinatra, whose rejection for military service was that he claimed to be anxious in crowds. An odd affliction for a man who performed before large audiences for a living.\n\nGonzalo said on 8/Jul/14\n\nA legit 6`3 guy. Always looked that tall in movies. He even could have been a bit over that. One of the best actors ever\n\nArch Stanton said on 10/Jun/14\n\nMmm in Harvey he looks fractionally taller than Charles Drake. Perhaps Drake was a similar height to Joel McCrea or something and 6'2.5.\n\nArch Stanton said on 10/Jun/14\n\nHarvey's obviously taller than 6'3.5\". More like 6'6! He looks up to speak to him in the film! If he was 6'3.5\" he'd be looking directly ahead!\n\nArch Stanton said on 10/Jun/14\n\nOddly looked a tad shorter than 6'2 listed Charles Drake in The Glenn Miller Story!\n\nArch Stanton said on 12/May/14\n\nActually 135 pounds is quite possible at least in his 20s and early 30s. in Destry Rides Again he's tucking his shirt in and around the waist and his upper torso he was ridiculously skinny. Paper thin build which he often hid with his suit jackets. He really was super thin, nothing of him, and considered he was 6'3\" his upper torso is actually more like that of a skinny 5'7\" guy with very long legs and arms. I'd guess his waist could have been as low as 27-28 . I think he was telling the truth, as hard to believe as it is. In the 50s though he looked nearer 155-60 pounds to be though.\n\nArch Stanton said on 10/May/14\n\nIt must have been Wayne's cowboy boots with a little advantage. Wayne still looked very close to 6'4\" in the Shootist, his last film and clearly had an easy inch on Jimmy.\n\nArch Stanton said on 10/May/14\n\nAlthough I think Wayne had footwear advantage with cowboy boots.\n\nArch Stanton said on 10/May/14\n\nRob how much height do you think he's have lost on average by 1976? He was pushing 70, an inch? He's looks more 6'2\" range next to John Wayne in The Shootist who should have lost the same sort of height!\n\nEditor Rob\n\non average maybe an inch, but I don't think he lost that much\n\nJohn said on 6/Apr/14\n\nI could have believed 192cm for JS, he had very long legs and looked really tall even with other tall actors.\n\nSam said on 19/Mar/14\n\nNaturally, he lost some height with age. Charlton Heston looks to have edged him out in 1987. I'm guessing at peak that Stewart would have been around 0.75 in taller than Heston was. Note how short Robert Wagner looks compared to Heston.\n\nClick Here\n\nlong time movie buff said on 20/Feb/14\n\nJimmy Stewart was 6' 3 and 3/4 in.. Gary Cooper was 6' 3 in. at peak."
