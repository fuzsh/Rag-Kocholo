He was born on January 24, 1924, in Dallas.\n\nJames lived a fulfilling life as a dedicated truck driver who traversed countless roads and made connections wherever he went. His jovial and friendly nature meant that he never met a stranger. James cherished the open road as much as the people he encountered along the way. Including his good friends at the Park Manor Apartments .\n\nIn addition to his successful career, James had a passionate interest in golf. He spent many hours perfecting his swing on the green and enjoyed sharing this hobby with others. His love for the game brought him immense joy and allowed him to form strong bonds with fellow golf enthusiasts.\n\nOn January 2, 2024, friends and family will gather to pay their respects during a visitation event at Golden Gate Funeral Home-Dallas located at 4155 S R. L. Thornton Fwy in Dallas, Texas. The visitation will begin at noon and extend until 9:00 PM.\n\nA funeral service to honor James' life will take place on January 3, 2024, also at Golden Gate Funeral Home-Dallas. Starting at 11:00 AM and concluding at noon, this service will provide an opportunity for loved ones to commemorate James's remarkable journey.\n\nJames is survived by his daughter Gloria Faye Stewart, who was deeply cherished by him throughout his life. Additionally, he leaves behind one great grandson whose life was touched by James's presence. Elizabeth Lewis, James's beloved sister and a special friend Barbara was a constant source of support, fondly remembers their shared memories.\n\nThe impact of James Stewart's vibrant personality and zest for life cannot be overstated. He will be missed by all who had the privilege of knowing him. May his soul find eternal peace as we celebrate the legacy of a remarkable man whose kindness and warmth illuminated the lives he touched."
