        "meta_description": "James Stewart was born the son of Elizabeth Ruth (n√©e Jackson) and Alexander Maitland Stewart, who owned a hardware store. Stewart's parents were of Scottish Presbyterian origin. His Jackson ancestors served in the American Revolution, the War of 1812 and the Civil War. The eldest of three children (he had two younger sisters, Virginia and Mary), he was expected to continue his father's business, which had been in the family for three generations.\r\n\r\nHis mother was an excellent pianist but his father discouraged Stewart's request for lessons. But when his father accepted a gift of an accordion from a guest, young Stewart quickly learned to play the instrument, which became a fixture off-stage during his acting career. As the family grew, music continued to be an important part of family life.\r\n\r\nStewart attended Mercersburg Academy prep school, graduating in 1928. At Mercersburg, Stewart was active in a variety of activities. He played on the football and track teams.",
