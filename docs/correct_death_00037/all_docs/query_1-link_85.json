        "text": "“I enjoy gastroenterology because of the chance it give me to make a difference in my patient’s lives. I enjoy all aspects of gastroenterology from curing hepatitis C, to managing Crohns disease and Ulcerative colitis and to diagnosing and preventing colon cancer. Gastroenterology encompasses a wide spectrum of diseases and symptoms which encourages me to stay on the forefront of knowledge as new discoveries are made every month. From a personal standpoint, my grandfather died of colorectal cancer that was diagnosed too late. If found at early stages it is curable but he did not undergo a colonoscopy until it was too late when he had symptoms. His life would have been dramatically different had the cancer been found at an earlier stage.\n\nI grew up in Utah having attended high school, university, and medical school all here in Salt Lake City. It is a wonderful place to live, flourish, and grow. My job is to help my patients maximize their gastrointestinal health so that they can flourish in our beautiful state. Through careful one-on-one discussion and appropriate use of lab testing, radiology, and endoscopy, I will try my best to find the cause of whatever is concerning my patients. Our office is dedicated to promptly answering our patients’ concerns and questions.”"
