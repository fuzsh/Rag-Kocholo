        "text": "Jimmy Stewart arrived in the United States in 1980 with only the barest knowledge of his new homeland. He could not, he says, tell the difference between a Dallas Cowboy (a football player) and a John Wayne cowboy (a movie actor who rode a galloping horse.)\n\nHe expected endless questions about his native Scotland, but Americans almost never asked.\n\n“Instead they were asking me what I thought of America,” he says. “This is the only country in the world where people seem to be more concerned what strangers thought of them than what they wanted to learn about other countries.”\n\nStewart, 73, laughs in his basement in Gleneagle as he tells his story. He quickly realized he adored The Land of the Free. By 1984, he was entrenched in America, never to depart.\n\nWhat grabbed him?\n\n“When I saw the freedom that this country has,” he answers. “There were a lot of things in Scotland that I couldn’t talk about — politics, religion what have you.”\n\nIn America, he soon joined a group that discussed the different brands of American Christianity and was “astonished” at the frank and friendly nature of the talks. Americans talked freely of politics. They talked freely about everything.\n\n“There is,” he says, “just so much freedom.”\n\nStewart brought a probing, always hungry-for-more scientific mind from Scotland, where he had earned a Ph.D. and labored as a professor. He’s retired, kind of, from a career of research and leading his own company, but the hunger to learn more remains.\n\nAnd so does his devotion to teaching and sharing.\n\n“Science is utterly logical and humans are not that logical,” he says. “You get nasty people, villains, car salesmen, politicians, what have you. You don’t trust what they say.”\n\nThere’s a better alternative.\n\n“You’ve seen the \"Star Trek\" series,” he says.\n\nYes, I have.\n\nTo Stewart, the world of \"Star Trek\" is a world where science has triumphed.\n\n“They are exploring the unknown. They’ve done away with money. They’ve done away with petty crime. It’s a nice ideal world, because of science.\n\n“You can study aspects of science as far as you want and they are always people who can tell you more and there is always more to read and it is really very, very interesting.”\n\nStewart worked as a National Science Foundation Fellow at the Air Force Academy’s Seiler Research Laboratory, where he developed a program for molecular orbital calculations known as MOPAC. He left to start his own company, Stewart Computational Chemistry, which licenses MOPAC programs to users across the globe. He’s spoken to scientists in Japan, France, Germany, Italy, South Korea and the Czech Republic.\n\nBut he still enjoys explaining science to novices.\n\nOn Feb. 10, Stewart will speak at Science on Tap, a monthly series at Jack Quinn’s Irish Pub in downtown Colorado Springs. He will examine metrology, the study of measurement.\n\n“My favorite topic,” he says.\n\nHe will speak 20 to 25 minutes, allow his listeners a break so they can order additional drinks and then take questions for about an hour. He’s also spoken on general relativity, black holes, time dilation and quantum entanglement at Science on Tap.\n\nChet Dymek is senior instructor emeritus of chemistry and biochemistry at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs. He’s often enjoyed Stewart’s science presentations to novices.\n\n“Jimmy has been very, very good at explaining things,” Dymek says. “It’s not only that he knows the stuff, but he also has a good sense of humor. And he’s got the Scottish accent and the quirky background.”\n\nStewart is a natural to lead discussions. He has a deep attachment to the exchange of ideas.\n\nOn Tuesdays, he meets with a group of 25 to 35 at the Monument Library for Socrates Café, where the group examines a philosophical issue for two hours. This week's topic, the concept of duty, was proposed by Stewart.\n\n“I like the gentle social life that I take part in,” Stewart says. “Colorado Springs is a quiet oasis. This is a gentle place.”\n\nSeveral years back, Stewart received a job offer in California and seriously pondered moving West. But he kept thinking of how much he enjoyed life in the Springs. The hiking. The sunshine. The ease of living.\n\nHe said no to California.\n\n“I dodged the bullet,” he says with a laugh."
