James Maitland Stewart: An Evening with Jimmy Stewart is set in the Stewart’s Beverly Hills home in the summer of 1994, shortly after the death of Stewart’s wife Gloria. He had gone into a reclusive period and seldom ventured outside his home. Concerned that his memories are beginning to slip away, Stewart is found in his den in the early hours of the morning leafing through old photo albums, scripts, playbills, and newspapers. He begins to reminisce about some of the most personal events of his life — including his intense relation-ship with his father, his love of flying and his need to enter into WWII combat. He reveals his depression and self-doubt following the war, the death of his son in Vietnam, and his complex relationship with best friend Henry Fonda. Actor Steve Nevil recreates Jimmy Stewart — his home life in Indiana, his dreams and his misgivings.",
