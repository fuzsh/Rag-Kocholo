His baldness was made less obvious by his wearing a gray toupee for many of his movie roles.\n\nHis two natural children, twin daughters Judy Stewart and Kelly Stewart, were born on 5/7/5. His wife, Gloria Stewart (the former Gloria Hatrick McLean), a former model from Larchmont, NY, also brought two sons to the marriage: Ronald and Michael (aged 5 and 2 at the time of the wedding in 1949), whom he adopted.

During the course of World War II he rose to the rank of colonel, first as an instructor at home in the United States, and later on combat missions in Europe.\n\nBut work dried up as the Great Depression deepened, and it was not until 1934, when he followed his friend Henry Fonda to Hollywood, that things began to pick up.\n\nAfter his first screen appearance in Art Trouble (1934), he worked for a time for MGM as a contract player and slowly began making a name for himself in increasingly high-profile roles throughout the rest of the 1930s.\n\nAfter graduation, engagements with the University Players took him around the northeastern United States, including a run on Broadway in 1932.\n\nIn 1929, he won a place at Princeton University, where he studied architecture with some success and became further involved with the performing arts as a musician and actor with the University Players.\n\nJames Maitland Stewart was born on May 20, 1908 in Indiana, Pennsylvania, to Elizabeth Ruth (Johnson) and Alexander Maitland Stewart, who owned a hardware store.
