        "text": "Jimmy Stewart, a cherished husband, father, grandfather, uncle, and friend, passed away peacefully at his residence on March 5, 2024, surrounded by his loving family. Born on March 24, 1936, in Rock Mills, Alabama, and then growing up in Lanett, Alabama, Jimmy was a beacon of kindness and generosity throughout his 87 years of life.\n\nJimmy graduated from Lanett High School in 1954, showcasing his intelligence and dedication to education early on. He furthered his education by earning degrees from Perry Business School, Columbus Technical College, and Southern Union State Community College. His commitment to lifelong learning was a testament to his character and work ethic.\n\nIn 1958, Jimmy honorably served his country in the United States Army until 1960. His patriotism and sense of duty were evident in his service. Following his military tenure, Jimmy began a distinguished career with West Point Pepperell in 1966. Over the years, he excelled in Operations Management and ultimately retired as their Disaster Recovery Manager in 2001. His colleagues respected him for his intelligence and his ability to lead with both strength and compassion.\n\nJimmy's life was a reflection of his values—kindness, generosity, and intelligence. He was the pillar of his family, the one they always turned to for guidance and support. His humble nature was a comfort to all who knew him. Jimmy's love for his family was evident in everything he did, from his meticulous gardening and sharing the fruits of his labor with them, to the joy he found in spending time on his tractor and walking in the woods.\n\nHe was a member of Langdale Methodist Church, where he found spiritual fulfillment and a community of like-minded individuals who shared his values and his commitment to service.\n\nJimmy leaves behind a legacy of love and devotion. He is survived by his beloved wife, Johanne Stewart; his children, James H. Stewart (Joanna Diller), Carol Stewart (Keith Sharpe), and Andrew Jerrell Stewart (Kimberly); and his cherished grandchildren, Alana Joy, John Owen, and Andrew Stewart. He will also be fondly remembered by his uncle, Nick Bolan (Carol); his sister-in-law, Jeanette Rader; and a host of beloved nieces, nephews, and cousins who will miss his presence deeply.\n\nPreceding him in death were his parents, Allen and Jessie Stewart of Lanett; his siblings and their spouses, Roy Gherson Stewart (Betty Lee), Betty Stewart Smallwood Morris, Calvin Jackson Stewart (Annette), and Allen Jerry Stewart (Sheila). Each of them held a special place in his heart, and he carried their memories with him throughout his life.\n\nJimmy Stewart's life was one of unwavering love, service, and dedication to his family and community. His kind spirit and generous heart touched the lives of many, and his intelligence and wisdom guided those around him. He will be deeply missed, but his legacy will continue to live on through the countless lives he impacted.\n\nAs we bid farewell to Jimmy, we celebrate a life well-lived—a life filled with love, laughter, and the joy of simple pleasures. His memory will forever be a guiding light for his family and all who had the privilege of knowing him. Jimmy Stewart was truly one of a kind, and his presence will be missed but never forgotten.\n\nA Celebration of Life service for Jimmy will be held on Saturday, March 9th, 2024, at 3:00 PM (EST) at the Johnson Brown-Service Funeral Home Chapel in Valley. The Reverend Frank Lyons will officiate. Jimmy’s family will receive friends Saturday afternoon from 2:00 PM (EST) until the service hour at the funeral home.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, Jimmy’s family asks that donations be made in his memory to Chattahoochee Hospice, 6 Medical Park North, Valley, AL, 36854.\n\nPlease visit Jimmy’s Memorial Tribute page at www.johnsonbrownservicefh.com to leave a kind word for his family, to share a memory of Jimmy, or to light a Remembrance Candle in his memory.\n\nJohnson Brown-Service Funeral Home of Valley directing."
