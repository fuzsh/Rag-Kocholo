        "text": "Profession: Actor\n\nBiography: James Stewart was known for his distinctive drawl and down-to-earth persona, and for portraying the average American middle class man, facing life's everyday struggles.\n\nStewart's first big role was in Frank Capra's You Can't Take It With You\" in 1938. He went on to be nominated for five Academy Awards, winning one for \"The Philadelphia Story\" (1940). Other notable films include Alfred Hitchcock's \"Rear Window\" opposite Grace Kelly \"Vertigo\" and Frank Capra's Mr. \"Smith Goes to Washington\".\n\nStewart joined the US army in March 1941 as a private and was promoted to second lieutenant in 1942. He was the first Hollywood star in uniform in WWII. Stewart appeared in a number of promotional films and appearances for the army to encourage the war effort in the US.\n\nAnxious to see active service, Stewart was eventually assigned to the 445th Bomb Group in 1943. Stewart, a pilot, flew in missions over Germany in 1943 and 1944 and was promoted to major then colonel by the end of the war in Europe.\n\nStewart's comeback Hollywood film was Frank Capra's \"It's a Wonderful Life\" in 1946, now regarded as a Christmas classic and Stewart's own personal favourite film.\n\nBorn: May 20, 1908\n\nBirthplace: Indiana, Pennsylvania, USA\n\nGeneration: Greatest Generation\n\nChinese Zodiac: Monkey\n\nStar Sign: Taurus"
