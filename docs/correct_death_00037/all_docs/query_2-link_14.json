However, many may be surprised to learn he was also a World War II hero.\n\nThe Stewart Family\n\nBorn 20 May 1908 in Indiana, Pennsylvania, James Stewart was the oldest child of Alexander Maitland Stewart and Elizabeth Ruth Jackson. [1][2][3][4] James was of Scottish and Irish ancestry, raised as a Presbyterian and descended from veterans of the American Revolution, the War of 1812, the American Civil War and World War I.[5][6] HIs father was a business man and ran the local hardware store where Jimmy's Academy Award was displayed for over twenty-five years for everyone to see. The family was close-knit.[6] All the children were musicians, inheriting their mother, Elizabeth's skill.[6] Jimmy performed plays with his sisters and was an active boy scout.[6] He continued acting and playing music into early adulthood, on his way to his future in Hollywood.[6]\n\nThe patriotism of James “Jimmy” Maitland Stewart (1908-1997), was grounded in his smalltown upbringing and family military service history reaching back to the Civil War. Both grandfathers fought in the Civil War, and his father was a veteran of the Spanish-American War and World War I. He wanted to attend the U.S. Naval Academy and become a naval aviator. However, his father convinced his son to attend Princeton where he studied Architecture.[6]\n\nJimmy Stewart was awarded the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal.\n\nJimmy Stewart was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross with Oak leaf cluster.\n\nJimmy Stewart was awarded the Air Medal with 3 Oak Leaf Clusters.\n\nJimmy Stewart was awarded the Army Commendation Medal.\n\nJimmy Stewart was awarded the American Defense Service Medal.\n\nJimmy Stewart was awarded the European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with 3 Service Stars.\n\nJimmy Stewart was awarded the World War II Victory Medal.\n\nJimmy Stewart was awarded the Armed Forces Reserve Medal.\n\nJimmy Stewart was awarded the French Croix de Guerre with Palm.\n\nJimmy Stewart was awarded the U.S. Air Force Presidential Unit Citation.\n\nJimmy Stewart was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\n\"Jimmy\" Stewart graduated from Princeton University in 1932, and became an actor. Rejected as underweight by his draft board, he went on a crash-eating program to bulk up. On March 22, 1941, one month after winning his best actor Oscar for his role as a tabloid journalist in “The Philadelphia Story,” Stewart was accepted into the U.S. Army Air Corps – the first major movie star to enter the military. [7] He was commissioned a Second Lieutenant and awarded his pilot wings on December 31, 1941. He served as an instructor pilot during most of 1942 and 1943, and was assigned to the 445th Bombardment Group in Sioux City, Iowa in August 1943. Stewart flew with the group to England in December 1943 and soon began flying combat missions over Europe. He served a short tour in Southeast Asia in 1966 and retired in 1968 as a U.S. Air Force Brigadier General. On May 23, 1985, President Ronald Reagan awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom and promoted him to Major General on the retired list.\n\nBrigadier General James Maitland \"Jimmy\" Stewart, United States Air Force, was awarded the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal for exceptionally meritorious and distinguished service in a position of great responsibility to the Government of the United States. The singularly distinctive accomplishments of General Stewart and his dedicated contributions in the service of his country reflect the highest credit upon himself and the United States Air Force.\n\nJimmy in It's a Wonderful Life\n\nJimmy Stewart suffered such extreme PTSD after being a fighter pilot in World War II that he acted out his mental distress during 'It's a Wonderful Life'. Stewart played George Bailey in the classic movie and channeled his anger and guilt into the scenes where he rages at his family. Stewart was haunted by 'a thousand black memories' from his time as an Air Force commanding officer that he took with him back to Hollywood after the war. Pilots who flew with him said that became 'Flak Happy' during World War II, a term to describe what is now known as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, or PTSD. Stewart felt responsible for the death of his men and especially one bloodbath where he lost 13 planes containing 130 men who he knew well. Stewart never spoke about it, even to other veterans, and bottled up his emotions that came out in the acting parts he chose when he returned to Hollywood.\n\nJimmy married Gloria Hatrick McLean, the daughter of Edgar and Jessie Hatrick, August 9th, 1949 in Los Angeles, California.[8]They raised four children together, two sons from Gloria's previous marriage and their twin daughters.[6] The family was Presbyterian.[6]\n\nAn American film and stage actor, James (Jimmy) Stewart, starred in many films over the course of his career, several of which are widely considered to be classics. He became known for portraying the average middle class man with everyday life struggles and also for his distinctive voice and down-to-earth nature. Of his acting technique, Cary Grant said, \"He had the ability to talk naturally. He knew that in conversations people do often interrupt one another and it's not always so easy to get a thought out. It took a little time for the sound men to get used to him, but he had an enormous impact.\"[5]\n\nJimmy Stewart was a major star for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. He was nominated for five Academy Awards and won one. Jimmy was also the recipient of a Lifetime Achievement Award.[5]\n\nJimmy & Beau\n\nJimmy once owned a golden retriever that he was very fond of, a dog he called Beau. While filming a movie in Arizona, Stewart received a phone call from his veterinarian who informed him that Beau was terminally ill and that Stewart's wife Gloria wanted Jimmy's permission to put Beau to sleep.[9]\n\nJimmy told the vet to \"keep him alive and I'll be there\", then asked for several days leave from the film so he could spend some time with his dog before they put him down.[9]\n\nLooking back on that time Jimmy said, \"After [Beau] died there were a lot of nights when I was certain that I could feel him get into bed beside me and I would reach out and pat his head. The feeling was so real that I wrote a poem about it and how much it hurt to realize that he wasn’t going to be there any more.\"[9]\n\nYou can read the poem here, and watch him recite it on Johnny Carson.[10]\n\nStewart's wife, Gloria, passed away in February 1994. After her death, it was noted that Stewart became more reclusive and depressed barely leaving his home. In June 1997, a blood clot formed in his leg which later led to a pulmonary embolism. Stewart died of a heart attack directly caused by that embolism on July 2, 1997.[11]\n\nStewart is buried at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California. His memorial service included full military honors with over 3000 in attendance.
