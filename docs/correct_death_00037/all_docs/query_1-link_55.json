        "text": "Back in February 2023, police found James Stewart dead inside his camper near Salt Creek on the south edge of Oolitic.\n\nHe had been shot, and an investigation showed the fatal wound wasn’t self-inflicted. Someone had killed the 42-year-old Bloomington man.\n\nHis family and police want to find the person responsible. They want justice.\n\nAfter more than a year and no strong leads, the Lawrence County Sheriff’s Office has enlisted help from Crimestoppers to track down the killer.\n\nLast month, the organization posted a plea for information in the Stewart case. Included was a picture of the victim and a request that anyone who knows anything about his death call Lawrence County Sheriff’s Office Detective Andrea Barnett at 812-275-3316.\n\n\"Detectives have continued to investigate the death while following up on any leads and laboratory analysis,\" the sheriff's department said in a March 12 release. \"There is rarely a day that goes by that some type of investigation is not completed on this case. Investigators believe that someone has key pieces of information, no matter how small, that would be imperative in solving this case and bringing closure to Mr. Stewart’s family.\"\n\nSarah Stewart knows police are working to solve her brother's killing and prays someone comes forward with a piece of evidence that leads them to the culprit.\n\n“We understand that investigations like this are time consuming and complex,” the Bloomington woman said. \"But the weight of not knowing what happened is something we carry every day.”\n\nIt never wanes. “The emotional toll of James’s unresolved death has been profound on me and my family,” she said.\n\n“It's more than just grief. It's a relentless quest for closure, for understanding, and most importantly, for justice. It's now been over a year, and we're still waiting for answers about what happened to him.”\n\nHappier times at a sunny birthday celebration\n\nNot long before his death, James Stewart’s family gathered for a late celebration of his Jan. 19 birthday. It was an unusually warm and sunny day for winter, and the family took advantage of it.\n\nStewart loved spending time outdoors on the family property near Oolitic. That afternoon, he cooked potatoes, corn on the cob, sausage and shrimp in a giant pot.\n\n“It was a gorgeous day outside, so we sat around the picnic table and talked while he cooked a low-country boil,” his sister recalled. “He was so happy that we were all together.”\n\nLater, he took their mother’s hand. “He walked her around the property, showing off all the projects he had been working on and describing plans for others he was imagining.”\n\nJames Stewart moves to small-town Oolitic\n\nJames moved from Bloomington to Oolitic just weeks before he was killed to be closer to his daughter. He wanted to pursue a longtime family vision to establish a homestead on the Oolitic property where the entire family could live together.\n\nThe wilderness was where he felt at home — fishing, hunting, four-wheeling and exploring the woods.\n\nHe had been struggling with difficult times, she said, challenges he seemed to have overcome. The family was grieving the 2020 death of 34-year-old Alicia Stewart, the youngest of three Stewart siblings, “which has made James's passing even more devastating for our family.”\n\nBut James was upbeat at his birthday dinner, she said, talking with hope about plans for the future.\n\n“In the last months of his life, he seemed to have found a renewed sense of purpose and happiness,” Sarah Stewart said. “He seemed more willing to embrace the present and appreciate the journey that had led him there.”\n\nSeeking 'crucial piece of information'\n\nNot long after that, they learned James was dead, shot by someone they hope is tracked down and prosecuted. There’s a $1,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest and conviction.\n\n“We’re holding onto the hope that someone, somewhere, holds the crucial piece of information, which is why it’s so important to share his story,” Stewart said.\n\n“He left an enduring mark on the hearts of his family and friends, a legacy of love, resilience and the power of the human spirit.”\n\nContact H-T reporter Laura Lane at llane@heraldt.com or 812-318-5967."
