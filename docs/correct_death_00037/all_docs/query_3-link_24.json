        "text": "“If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer.”\n\n— Henry David Thoreau, Walden (1854)\n\nThings were going badly for James Maitland Stewart. Just as World War II broke out in the Spring of ‘41, the lanky 6'3\" Princeton grad gave up a prosperous career to join the Army Air Force. He applied to officer training school. Too skinny. He reapplied. Too old. Finally, he got his wings. Developed PTSD. One dream after another, shattered.\n\nAfter the German Wehrmacht invaded Poland on September 3, 1939, prospects for a quick Allied victory appeared bleak. The Dunkirk evacuation on May 27, 1940, put an end to the illusion of any kind of victory. In September, Congress passed the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, aka the “Draft,” in case America entered the war. When that happened, Jimmy Stewart from Indiana, Pennsylvania, wanted to be near the action. Two things would get in the way.\n\nStewart graduated from Princeton with a degree in architecture in 1932 only to discover that skyscrapers were not a booming business during the Great Depression. But he learned how to fly while writing his thesis on airport design. In order to understand how airports operate he had to get his pilot’s license. Stewart was obsessed with flying the way tech nerds are with software. More than anything, he yearned to be a combat pilot. That is why weighing in at the recruiting station was such a letdown. At 6’3” he tipped the scale at 138 pounds. The medic shook his head.\n\nStewart was too frail.\n\nThen he accomplished what some dream about. He went on a fat diet. After eating everything with high sugar and butterfat he returned to the recruiting station and tipped the scales by one ounce. The second problem was standing by. While he was busy dieting, he turned 33 years old. The medic shook his head again.\n\nToo old for Aviation Cadet school.\n\nThe only option was to enlist as a buck private. That meant he could not fly.\n\nStewart signed up.\n\nThen the world changed. America was at war now and the Pentagon realized Germany had more pilots. Suddenly, a pilot's license meant you were fit. There was no such thing as too slim or too old. Stewart received his second lieutenant commission in the Air Corps. He was off into the wild blue yonder.\n\nThere would be one condition. He wanted to be a combat pilot. He requested that his commanding officer ignore his celebrity status which might disqualify him. He joined the 445th Bombardment Group for the dangerous mission of flying B-24 Liberators over Germany.\n\nStewart completed 20 missions before becoming the 2nd Combat wing's Chief of Staff. By 1945, he was promoted to full colonel. Additionally, he was chosen to preside over the court-martial for the pilot who unintentionally bombed Zurich. After completing his final tour at the end of February 1945, Stewart was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and the French Croix de Guerre for his combat valor. But Stewart was scarred. Instead of celebrating, he had a breakdown. He was bedridden with PTSD.\n\nIn his biography, flying squadron buddies said that Stewart \"went flak-happy — which means shell shock.\" His problem was fear for the squdron he was leading. He was afraid of making a mistake that would kill his team members. The war had changed Jim down to the molecular level. That's what ended up grounding him.”\n\nThe irony is that Stewart did not become a war hero to add a little bronze to his resume. He was already among the most famous men in the country.\n\nGrounded in Reality\n\nStewart was grounded in other ways. By August 1945, he lost the will to do anything with his life. The 38-year-old former actor was burned out. He throught about turning to the family business. His biographer, Steve Matzen, says, \"He came back looking like hell. A before-and-after photo in the book shows him in 1942 looking all youthful and then in 1944 looking like hell.\" The other problem was that he had been away for nearly five years, and Hollywood didn't wait for anyone, not even a war hero.\n\nStewart's fame as an actor wasn't an accident, but becoming an actor was.\n\nBy the time he received his architectural degree from Princeton in 1932, the Great Depression had made it impossible to find work. During the presidency of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, industrial production fell by 47%, and the unemployment rate rose to 20% or higher. That didn't include domestic or farm labor, which made up sizable percentages of the workforce. The nation was in utter disarray.\n\nBank runs were everyday occurrences. The New York Times reported that a man in the Bronx went to the \"Bank of the United States to sell his stock, and when the well-meaning bank manager advised him not to, he spread rumors that the bank was in trouble. Within hours, 3,500 depositors withdrew $2 million in funds, and the bank collapsed. It didn't take much to dim people's faith in bankers in 1932, and even for the average person who didn't participate in the Wall Street crash, the Depression had arrived.\n\nStewart's professor had arranged a graduate school scholarship. He turned it down to join a summer stock troupe called University Players on Cape Cod. Stewart's job had nothing to do with acting. He was an architect and thought he could help design sets. He was hired because he could play the accordion off-stage in addition to stage production.\n\nThe reason Stewart knew how to play the instrument goes back to his childhood in Indiana, Pennsylvania. When Stewart was a young boy, one of his father's hardware store customers could not pay his bill and gave an accordion as collateral. The debt was never repaid, and Stewart's father gave it to his son, who took lessons from a neighborhood barber. He would accompany his mother on the piano at family gatherings.\n\nNow it was his profession.\n\nThe Accordion Player\n\nOn Cape Cod, Stewart played the accordion off-stage while actors performed Shakespeare. He jumped at the chance to act when a small part became available. Stewart started off appearing in plays before relocating to New York City, where an MGM scout saw him and set up an audition. By 1938, he was cast opposite Ginger Rogers in a romantic comedy called Vivacious Lady. The New York Herald called him \"one of the most knowing and engaging young actors on the screen at present.\"\n\nStewart had a deal with Columbia Pictures later that year. They agreed to loan him out to a director who significantly impacted Stewart's life, as Stewart noted in his 1985 acceptance speech for his lifetime Oscar. In the film \"You Can't Take It With You,\" Stewart collaborated with the renowned director Frank Capra. Capra said of Stewart that he was a natural actor who \"got character archetypes intuitively and required little directing.\"\n\nThe movie received the Best Picture Academy Award and rose to the fifth-highest box office position of the year. Actor Lionel Barrymore, with whom Stewart later collaborated, served as his co-star. Then, shortly before America entered World War II, George Cukor's The Philadelphia Story was released in 1940, cementing Jimmy Stewart's legend. Stewart played a gossip reporter trying to get the scoop on the upcoming marriage, Katharine Hepburn, aided by a wily ex-husband, Cary Grant.\n\nStewart would take home the Best Actor Oscar.\n\nGoing Home\n\nBut now that the war ended, Stewart wasn’t a screen star anymore, just another unemployed actor living with his parents. His father, Alex Stewart, ran J.M Stewart Hardware Store, named after Jimmy Stewart’s grandfather. Maybe it was time to call it quits and join the family firm. Stewart was 38 years old, a former Hollywood superstar with an Oscar in the store’s window. His life’s story would be selling nuts and bolts. How the mighty have fallen, he thought to himself.\n\nThat was when the old survival instincts kicked in. As he began to recover he decided to find out if there was anything better in the future? \"I've been away for five years; other people are taking my roles.\" Could he still succeed in Hollywood while actors like Marlon Brando and Gregory Peck were gaining?\n\nNothing fades as fast as reputation in Hollywood. Stewart's only job offer was from Louis B. Mayer, his old boss at MGM, who said, \"Let's do 'The Jimmy Stewart Story' — we can show you flying over Frankfurt, we can show you as a military hero.\" Stewart said no. He wouldn't talk about the war.\n\nStewart's quick reply was, \"no.\" He refused to bring up the conflict. \"The world has witnessed too much pain and suffering,\" he remarked. “I want to do a comedy.”\n\nFrank Capra called.\n\nHe had a movie idea about Christmas Eve and a small-town banker. That sounded good but there was a problem with the script. The banker wanted to commit suicide.\n\nCapra noted that Stewart stormed out of the meeting after asking, \"You want me to do what?\"\n\nStewart's agent, Lew Wassermann, turned to him and asked, \"You got any other offers?\"\n\nCapra’s Comedy\n\nFrank Capra was a legendary director of Hollywood movies of the 30s through the 50s. In 1938 alone, he received six Academy Awards Oscar nominations for Best Director during his lifetime, winning three of them: It Happened One Night (1935), Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936), and You Can't Take It With You (1938). But his rise to the pantheon of movie directors was a tale of rags to riches or, more likely, rags to petty crime.\n\nStewart and Capra were cut from some of the same cloth. Francesco Rosario Capra was born near Palermo, Sicily, in 1897. His family traveled steerage to America on the ship Germania. An experience Capra recalled vividly: \"You're all together — no privacy. Nobody takes their clothes off. There's no ventilation. It stinks like hell. They're all miserable. It's the most degrading place you could ever be.\"\n\nCapra's father got a job as a fruit picker in California, and Frank sold newspapers. Instead of working after high school, Frank enrolled in Cal Tech, much to his father's chagrin. He played the banjo at a bar in Pasadena to pay for tuition, much like Stewart's playing the accordion. The similarities are astonishing. Thus far, the main characters of our story are educated at two of the finest educational institutions in the world. Both play musical instruments that inadvertently help launch their careers. By chance, Capra is a chemical engineer like Stewart's architectural studies, and although each turns out to be a dead-end they lead to discoveries that could not have happened without them.\n\nOne day, Capra read a report about a new film studio opening close to Golden Gate Park in San Francisco. He traveled to Columbia Features (no relation to the better-known studio Capra would eventually work for). He announced, \"I'm Frank Capra from Hollywood,\" as he stormed into the producer's office. He was from Hollywood in the same way a hot dog vendor is from Wall Street. He had no experience and no resume. But with that as a questionable start, the producer gave him a job as director. There was just one issue, though.\n\nCapra wasn't a director; he was a thief.\n\nCapra was given advance money to start filming, and his play was to take it and head up to Reno, Nevada, to gamble it away. He had made money by pushing gold mining stock scams and illegal distilleries (where his chemical engineering degree came in handy). To his surprise, Capra fell in love with movie-making. He wrote comic gags for pictures like Our Gang, also known as The Little Rascals. But mostly, his movie career was over before it began when something unexpected happened.\n\nMovies started talking.\n\nWhen Hollywood switched from the silent film era to 'talkies,' people didn't give it much chance. Most studios thought talking movies were a passing fancy and weren't willing to put money into the technology. Capra happened to see Al Jolson singing in The Jazz Singer in 1927, which movie historians consider the first talkie, and Capra was hooked: \"It was an absolute shock to hear this man open his mouth and a song come out of it. It was one of those once-in-a-lifetime experiences.\"\n\nWhy did Capra see what others missed? He had a Cal Tech engineering degree and could appreciate technology. It was the break he was waiting for, recalling, \"I wasn't at home in silent films. about was on thin ice, there was no way to prove this new medium would take off, but he had a hunch. As his biography pointed out, \"You had to bluff to survive. When sound first came in, nobody knew much about it. We were all walking around in the dark. Even the soundman didn't know much about it. Frank was one of the few directors who knew what the hell they were doing. Most of your directors walked around in a fog — — they didn't know where the door was.\"\n\nMovie studios like Columbia began thinking in terms of a broader range of talent and how to improve the quality of movies, and Capra's films made him a \"bankable\" director. Capra was also given credit by placing his \"name above the film title,\" a first in the movie industry. Critic Alistair Cooke observed that Capra was \"starting to make movies about themes instead of people.\"\n\nThe name Capra refers to a \"goat\" in Italian, where our word \"capricious\" comes from \"evoking the animal's obstinacy and skittish temperament.\" For Capra, it was a talent that played a role in wooing Jimmy Stewart back to the screen. Capra directed Stewart before the war in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, for which Stewart won his first Oscar.\n\nThe Comeback Kid\n\nCapra had an idea for a movie. It wasn't a comedy, however. The lead was a small-town mortgage banker named George Bailey, who was so down on his luck he tried to commit suicide on Christmas Eve. Capra said it was called \"It's a Wonderful Life.\"\n\nThat didn't sound like a comedy to Stewart. Capra sold Stewart on the rest of the story. Bailey's problem is that he can't see any reason for being alive until an angel from heaven asks him to reimagine the world as if he never existed. Capra thought the story was going to be a hit. It reminded him of both Stewart's and Capra's youth. But Stewart had doubts, which was when Capra told him, \"This is our last shot. Hollywood went on without us, we're not getting any younger, and if this bombs after we've both been away for five years ….\"\n\nThe film began shooting on April 15, 1946. Stewart plays George Bailey from age 21 to 38, from the night of the school dance in 1928 to Christmas 1945. Stewart was 38 years old. 25-year-old Donna Reed plays Mary from the age of 18 to 35. It was the first and last time that Frank Capra produced, financed, directed and co-wrote one of his films. Steven Spielberg cites this film as one of his favorite movies. At $3.7 million, this was a very expensive independent production. In its initial box office run, it only earned $3.3 million. Director Frank Capra estimated the film would be shot within 90 days. He turned out to be right.\n\nNBC claims It's a Wonderful Life is the best-selling movie of all time. It explores the similarities between the angst and suffering of Jimmy Stewart and the on-screen George Bailey. Bailey's rage in the early parts of the film and the raw emotional bite it takes was so intense that fellow actors weren't sure if the film would work or that audiences would enjoy it. Donna Reed, who plays Stewart's wife, remarked, \"This was not a happy set.\" The tension everyone was feeling was palpable, yet there was a sense that they would figure it out. According to Matzen, Stewart and Capra would go off and huddle, \"Should we try this? Should we try that?\"\n\nBut what makes Stewart's role so memorable is the scene in which Stewart's character, George Bailey, decides suicide is the only way out of his financial troubles, and an angel named Clarence tells him how much he means to the lives of people. They take an existential tour dreet, and Bailey's epiphany is that his life matters because he realizes he had such an effect. Much the same could be said of Jimmy Stewart.\n\nDuring the filming, Stewart expressed his concerns to fellow actor and antagonist in the film, Lionel Barrymore, that Hollywood roles seemed superficial compared to what he had been through in Europe. Barrymore replied, \"So, are you saying it's more worthwhile to drop bombs on people than to entertain them?\" It was a realization for Stewart, who realized, \"I do have an important role, and there are things to be done.\"\n\nCoda\n\nIt’s a Wonderful Life was released in 1946, one year after Stewart returned from Europe, depression — his own — and all. When it was released, the film failed to cover its production costs. Critics said the movie was 'schmaltzy' and sentimental, and Stewart even had doubts about his acting ability and seriously considered giving up acting as a result. In the aftermath of It's A Wonderful Life, Capra's production company went bankrupt, while Stewart continued to doubt his acting.\n\nFate had a different ending in mind. The movie was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Stewart's third Best Actor nomination. In the decades since its release, It's a Wonderful Life has grown to define Stewart's film persona and is widely considered a Christmas classic. According to the American Film Institute, it is one of the 100 best American movies ever made. Stewart later named the film his personal favorite out of his filmography.\n\nIn later years, Stewart would not just resume his Hollywood career but rocket past his former glory. He starred in hit films like Hitchcock's Rear Window and Vertigo, and according to Quigley's annual poll, was one of the top money-making stars for 1950, 1952–1959, and 1965. He was the highest-grossing fox office star in 1959.\n\nSuccess would be an uneasy friend, even for a film icon. After Vertigo was released to the public, the critics panned the movie, and Hitchcock blamed it on Stewart's age. At the time, he was fifty years old and had begun wearing a hairpiece.rd, Hitchcock cast Cary Grant in his next film, North by Northwest, a role Stewart wanted; Hitchcock said although Grant was four years older than Stewart, he photographed younger. As Jimmy Stewart knew from his earliest days to his journey over wartime, you flew your course and headed back home when it was over.\n\nCoda\n\nIn 1959, Stewart was promoted to brigadier general in the U.S. Air Force Reserve. He rarely spoke of the war or his heroic accomplishments in the years ahead. Eventually, he would fly missions in Vietnam before finally retiring. For bravery and meritorious service, Stewart received the Distinguished Service Medal, Presidential Medal of Freedom, Distinguished Flying Cross, and the French Croix de Guerre. It would have made quite a movie if Jimmy Stewart did nothing else in his life.\n\nGeneral Jimmy Stewart passed away on July 2, 1997, at the age of 89.\n\n“I’d like people to remember me as someone who was good at his job and seemed to mean what he said”\n\n— Jimmy Stewart"
