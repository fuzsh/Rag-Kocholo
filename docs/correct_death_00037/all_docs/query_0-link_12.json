        "text": "Oscar winning Hollywood actor James \"Jimmy\" Stewart (who's known for his roles in movies such as \"It's a Wonderful Life\", \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\", \"Rear Window\" and many others) bought a Tudor-style mansion accented with brick, birch trees, and a stone walkway at 918 North Roxbury Drive in Beverly Hills in 1949. Stewart lived here until his death in 1997. A year later in 1998 the house was sold, demolished and the current 15.000 square-feet Tuscan styled mansion was built on the premises. Prior to his death, Jimmy could often be seen walking his dogs along Roxbury Drive.\n\nHomes - Celebrity - Entertainment - Actors, Homes - Celebrity - Former\n\nLinks: www.seeing-stars.com, en.wikipedia.org, www.architecturaldigest.com, www.mansionglobal.com, therealdeal.com, www.youtube.com\n\nBy: tlp333"
