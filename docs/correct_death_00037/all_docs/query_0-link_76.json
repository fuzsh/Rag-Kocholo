        "text": "My mother told me three things, axioms to guide my life. I refer to them as the Three Big Ones. They were (1) you’re handsomer than Jimmy Stewart; (2) people are watching us; and (3) we will always live in Beverly Hills.\n\nShe didn’t tell me these things all at once but scattered them across the landscape of my young life, little seeds that eventually sprouted into full-blown attitudes. Riddled with a curious combination of arrogance and profound self-doubt, I simply waited. While other people went out and made places for themselves in the world, I waited for something to happen. Just what this would actually be was vague, but it had to do with being like other members of my family: famous, rich, loved. Like my great-grandfather Frank Keenan, my grandfather Ed Wynn, my father, Keenan Wynn, and my stepfather, Van Johnson, I figured I was in line for a job in the family business.\n\nThere was only one problem: I didn’t know how to get that job. It was beyond me. I guess I thought it would be conferred upon me, much like a title upon a child of the British royal family. After all, according to my mother, father and grandfather, we were a royal family of sorts. My grandfather was a Broadway superstar before the term was coined. In the Twenties and Thirties he was as famous as Chaplin and Fields. In his later years he starred in movies and TV and made his mark as a serious actor in the TV production of Requiem for a Heavyweight and the feature film The Diary of Anne Frank. My father was under contract to MGM during its golden era. His film and TV career lasted for forty-five years. Van Johnson was a big heartthrob in the Forties. He was the boy next door, the bobby-soxers’ idol. When I lived with him in the Fifties, he was considered a star of major magnitude. And Frank Keenan, my great-grandfather, was a Shakespearean actor at the turn of the century. A ”furniture actor,” my father called him, because he was usually so drunk onstage that he had to move from one piece of furniture to another in order not to fall down. Maybe not as grand as the Barrymores, but pretty goddamn grand.\n\nEditor’s picks\n\nSo all I had to do was wait. I think now that what I was waiting for was someone to pay me for being me. I remember discussing it as far back as high school with my friend Doug, whose father had written the Woody Woodpecker song. We decided then that our real job in life was simply being us. We’d punched in the day we were born, and we were always on the clock.\n\nYou’re handsomer than Jimmy Stewart. My mother meant well, but I could look in a mirror and see that it was a flat-out lie. I was too skinny, my ears stuck out, and I had zits, real zits. Fifties zits. Big conflict here, but I was always powerless over this kind of wishful thinking. Another thing was, I’ve always had this problem about process and result. If I was so handsome and Jimmy Stewart was this huge star, then what else did I need to do? Act? Big deal. My great-grandfather, grandfather and father were all actors. It would just come to me. It would be the result of genes and my mother’s affirmations. I was an early victim of positive thinking.\n\nIt wasn’t that I had self-confidence; I had none. It was that I bought result as process. Here’s how it would be: I would walk into an office of a producer some day, and he would shout, ”That’s the guy! Sign him!” What could be simpler?\n\nI’m watching old home movies. I’m two or three. Betty Grable loves me. Marlene Dietrich loves me. They fondle me, squeeze me. Marlene kisses me on the neck, blows in my ear and feeds me meatballs with colored toothpicks. This is a real memory. Ava Gardner comes to a party at our house. She walks by me and I can feel the breeze. I can hear the swish of her stockings. I am on the floor and I see up her dress. The most beautiful woman in the world, and I can see her thighs and underwear. She sees me and stops, then squats down by me. Up close her face is more beautiful than I can stand. She reaches out and touches my face. My skin jumps. Ten years from puberty, and I’m already horny. Her new husband, Mickey Rooney, walks over. I look at him, then at her. Then I speak: ”He’s too short for you.” Everybody laughs. Later, when they get divorced, I know it’s because of me. Another notch on my sandbox.\n\nPeople are watching us. This was to warn me: Whatever you do, it will be seen. It will be reported in the tabloids. God save us from the pages of Confidential magazine. My mother is right, of course. People watch our house. They drive by in buses and stare. One day my father and two pals from MGM, Gene Kelly and Van Johnson, are on the front lawn of our home in Brentwood playing with me when a tour bus stops. The three actors begin jumping around like monkeys. The tourists are utterly entranced; they crawl over each other taking pictures. I sit on the lawn and wave. People are watching us in this silly, happy, endless afternoon. How wonderful we must be.\n\nRelated\n\nThis is a real memory. I’m six. I’m in the kitchen eating dinner with the cook and the maid. My baby brother, Tracy, is upstairs, asleep. For some reason my mother is gone. She has been for a long time. I have stopped asking where. My father comes into the kitchen. He’s drunk. He’s carrying a radio. He puts the radio on the kitchen table, plugs it in and turns it on. A voice I have always heard, an important, edgy, race-track voice, speaks: ”Mr. and Mrs. America and all the ships at sea. Let’s go to press.” This is Walter Winchell, and he’s talking to me. I’m sure of it. He mentions my mother, Eve. He tells me that she has left my father and married his best friend, Van Johnson. Mommy married Uncle Van. I start to cry. I turn to my father for an explanation. He gives me a dollar bill, unplugs the radio and leaves the room. The governess puts me to bed.\n\nWe will always live in Beverly Hills. I accepted this one entirely. After all, everyone knew where we lived. My friends were always over. My mother and stepfather’s friends were always over. I tended bar. I fixed drinks for James Mason, Jack Hawkins, Tyrone Power and Judy Garland. Beverly Hills was the center of the known universe. If you moved from Beverly Hills, it was to go live in Bel Air. There could be no other reason. Bel Air was cool. Brentwood was also cool. Malibu was cool. Some places were not. Hollywood was not. Orange County was not. The San Fernando Valley was a slow, grinding death.\n\nI spent the years from ages nine to twenty-two in a huge Spanish-style house on Foothill Drive in Beverly Hills. I did what I thought all kids did: set fires, threw knives into all the walls and doors in the house, stole money from my parents, tortured animals, drove my brother and baby sister, Schuyler, to tears on a daily basis. It was kind of idyllic. I was an innocent there. I took my first pills in Beverly Hills, Dexamyls stolen from my mother’s medicine cabinet. I did most of my early drinking in Beverly Hills. I was lucky in Beverly Hills. Stoned and naked, I rode a friend’s Harley-Davidson through the streets there and didn’t get busted. As long as I was in Beverly Hills, I was in a charmed land. Cliff, the BHPD motorcycle cop, dropped by our parties and had a Coca-Cola while the guests chatted with him and admired his boots. We were protected, loved. And as far as I could see, it was simply because we were … us. Ned and his father for a 1944 publicity is still with the Wynn’s French poodle, Cocoa."
