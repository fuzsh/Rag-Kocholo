        "text": "Here's what's happening this week in the Chattanooga area.\n\nGet your picnics ready\n\nFriday, July 19, has been forecast as Tennessee's most perfect evening of the year for alfresco dining. Cabinet manufacturer Fabuwood used data from WeatherSpark to identify the most perfect evening of summer in each state for an outdoor meal. On that Friday in Tennessee, the temperature is expected to hover around 89 degrees with an 18.5% chance of rain. In Georgia and Alabama, the ideal date will be a week later, July 26. Georgia's evening forecast is 80 degrees with a 21% chance of rain. Alabama's temperature is expected to be 82 degrees with a 22% chance of rain. To determine the dates, Fabuwood analysts decided an ideal nighttime temperature for alfresco dining of around 75 degrees, then combined this with the date with the least chance of rain. This allowed them to map out the data and pinpoint the most perfect evenings of the summer in each state where conditions are closest to the target temperature and the chances of rainfall are most limited.\n\nCALENDAR\n\nARTS\n\nAREA 61 GALLERY — 721 Broad St., Suite 100. \"School's.
