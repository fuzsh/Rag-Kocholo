        "text": "James \"CardiacTheGhost\" Stewart\n\nLooking into the world of a game-changer.\n\nWhere it all started\n\nJames Lee Stewart was born October 16, 1992, in Dallas, Texas to Tabitha Williams and James Stewart. The oldest boy: but middle child of his household attended Dallas Public Schools until the family relocated to Grand Prairie, Texas. He grew a fondness of skateboarding and the skateboard culture, which evolved as a youth subculture that values individuality, creativity, and freedom. It was also in Grand Prairie, Texas where James’ family united in Christian fellowship and he was baptized at St. John Baptist Church under the pastoral leadership of Dr. Denny D. Davis. James graduated from South Grand Prairie High School in 2011, and shortly thereafter enlisted in the United States Navy. He served his country diligently during his 6-year Naval tenure as a dental technician and received an honorable discharge. He then furthered his educational endeavors at The Art Institute of Dallas.\n\nGreatest Accomplishment\n\nMarch 5, 2017, changed James’ life forever. It was on this day that he became father to Remi Davis. She was the absolute, undisputed love of his life. James was particularly proud of his & Remi’s ability to maintain a special closeness despite differences in cities, states and time zones. Distance was never an excuse or problem. This father/daughter love and bond was truly remarkable and unbreakable.\n\nAll about the music…\n\nEventually, James became known to thousands as CardiacTheGhost (CTG), as he embarked upon a musical journey as an independent artist based in Chicago & Dallas. CardiacTheGhost was referred to in an artist profile by Cascade.fm as “a progressive musician from Dallas, TX who combines multiple mediums of music which include hip hop, pop, rock & jazz into a very soothing artistic sound. His delivery of unworldly, yet chilled vibes over centric production has landed him on sites such as SayCheeseTV.com, CoSign Magazine, and more abroad!” His debut album, 1% was an expression of his free-spirited creativity to be followed by sophomore project “Pink Clouds.” Cardiac’s third and final album, “Air Wolves” was released in 2020.\n\nCardiacTheGhost was also featured in the coveted D Magazine as well as the Dallas Observer where he was listed as one of “5 Dallas Rappers to Watch in 2018.” In a feature by earmilk.com, Cardiac was cited as a self-proclaimed “freemo” (free emotions) act. The freedom of his emotions is what fans experienced as he performed on countless stages from Deep Ellum to Fortress Festival to Fort Worth Music Festival to the widely popular SXSW (South by Southwest) Music Festival. In a 2019 interview with Dallas Observer, Cardiac stated “Pink Clouds is like a whole world that I exist in… It doesn’t look like Earth.” He also said in the same interview: “I know that I have another place I can go…”\n\nIn the time of test, family is best.\n\nJames will be remembered for his amazingly infectious smile, quiet demeanor, free spirit & creative energy. He was preceded in death by his maternal grandmother, Jonna Williams.\n\nJames will be forever loved, cherished & remembered by his loving parents, Tabitha Williams & James A. Stewart; daughter Remi Davis; sisters Meisha Williams, Nadia Stewart & Diamond Finney, brother Malcolm Carroll; stepfather Willie Carroll; grandfather Johnny L. Ward; step-grandmother Cathy Ward ; grandmother Alice Stewart, his one & only nephew Tramel Elijah ‘Jellybean’ Harris; aunt Vivian Ward; uncles, Terry Williams (Vanessa); Eric Williams (Gayla); Jason Ward ; Jimmy Miller & Edmond English; special friends Demeterious Williams, Thaivone Benson, Daryl Linwood and a host of loving great aunts & uncles, cousins, relatives, friends, fans & supporters in the arts."
