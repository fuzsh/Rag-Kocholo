        "text": "James H. Stewart\n\n1944 -2020\n\nJames H. Stewart, IV (“Stew”) suddenly passed away August 15, 2020 peacefully with his loving family by his side. Born January 22, 1944, Stew lived a full life as a husband, father, grandfather, teacher, mentor and coach. Preceded in death by his beloved wife, Mary (Keating) and parents James III and Mary. He is survived by his children James V (Andrea), Teresa Lynch (Michael), Matthew (Elinor) and Beth Ann Johnson (Jeremy), nine grandchildren: Jimmy, Madison, Allison, Grace, Natalie, Mary Kate, Jack, Ryan and Nora. His eight siblings Mary Ann Dearie (late Paul), Thomas (Susan), Joan Cunningham (Michael), Barbara Cuneo (Donald), Rosemary Savelloni (Angelo), Paul (Debbie), Michael (Eileen) and Kevin.\n\nAs a husband and father, Jim was the center of our world. As much as his public life connected him as a role model, mentor and friend to many, our father was a very private person. We will remember him for his deep and abiding faith in God, his love for our mother and for the greatness of his strong yet gentle heart. Dad was known for cooking breakfast on Sunday mornings, waiting in the car in the driveway 15 minutes before we were supposed to leave the house, sledding at Malvern, and an incredible love for Christmas Eve. If he was washing the car and scrubbing the whitewalls, you knew to steer clear. When he sat on the front porch he could tell stories for hours. He loved to catch people by surprise. Whether it was waking us with a vacuum cleaner at 6:30 on a Saturday morning - because he thought we were all awake - or if it was surprising a former pool employee with an unexpected visit the smile he wore lit up a room. He especially loved “Stew’s Visits” to the many people he shared his life with everyday. The Jersey Shore was his favorite place to be. He was an avid reader. Bruce Springsteen will never have a bigger fan as he attended hundreds of concerts over the years. Most of all, he adored his loving grandchildren. You would never know it but Stew cradled the babies as often as he could. He adored feeding them, even when they blew raspberries in his face. What a gift it has been to see him with our children. We are deeply blessed.\n\nStew’s leadership at Malvern Prep spanned 48 years. Initially hired as a Spanish teacher, Jim later held many roles, ultimately serving as Head of School and President. His devotion to the students, faculty and the Malvern community was second to none. “Mr. Stewart” modeled servant leadership through his devotion to God, mentoring and counseling thousands of students and living Malvern’s mission of “Veritas, Unitas, Caritas.” Mr. Stewart was omni-present, regardless of the event. He was not afraid to step in and shovel snow in a snowstorm nor stand at a BASH event mingling with parents. During the majority of his years in leadership, Jim maintained a teaching schedule in addition to his administrative responsibilities. He wanted to be in touch with the students and with the language he taught. Our father genuinely loved and cared for the faculty, staff and students of the school as if they were his own. This legacy has forever changed the course of the school and those who have walked the campus.\n\nWhen he wasn’t found at Malvern, you could find Stew spending his summers at Aronimink Swim Club. From the echo of “WALK” from the infamous corner of the pool deck to being known to run the fastest swim meet in the county Jim’s voice could be heard from all corners of the pool. Quietly over the years he taught many adults to swim. If kids who were “benched” became repeat offenders, Stew would reach out to them to try to connect and figure out how to guide them to making better choices. Stew mentored many who worked for him long past his years at the pool. Through his time there Stew created lifelong friendships.\n\nPerhaps the greatest impact Stew is known for is his dedication to coaching St. Dorothy’s 7th and 8th grade football program. Stew spent 50 years from August to Thanksgiving not only teaching the game but more importantly, teaching his players about life. Each player had a role and more importantly, each player had a nickname. Football allowed him to combine his love of the game and his love for teaching. It was always a celebration to beat St. Bernadette’s on Thanksgiving Day.\n\nHe lived a very active life as a former triathlete and loved playing basketball, football and most recently, was swimming hundreds of laps a week at Aronimink. He enjoyed watching Philadelphia Sports Teams and college football.\n\nIn so many ways our father was larger than life to so many people. To us, he was Dad. A simple, honorable, Christian who taught us to love and be loved. He will live forever in our hearts.\n\nIn lieu of flowers contributions may be sent to the James and Mary Stewart Scholarship Fund care of Malvern Prep.

Warren Avenue Malvern, PA 19355 or to the James and Mary Stewart Scholarship Fund benefitting the students of St. Dorothy’s School at 1225 Burmont Road, Drexel Hill, PA 19026.\n\nJim’s family will receive relatives and friends on Wednesday, August 19, 2020, from 4-8pm, at Malvern Preparatory School, 418 S. Warren Avenue, Malvern PA 19355. Mask will be required and social distancing will be observed out of respect and safety for all those attending. His Funeral Mass and burial will be held privately."
