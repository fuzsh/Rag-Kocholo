        "text": "A new marketing campaign from Visit Fort Worth is called “The Unexpected City”—and a very unexpected voice is at the heart of it: legendary Hollywood actor Jimmy Stewart.\n\nStewart passed away in Beverly Hills back in 1997. So how could a 2023 ad campaign snag the voice of an actor who’s been gone for decades? Well, doggone it, hold your horses and you’ll find out.\n\nFirst, here’s the 60-second spot that drives the campaign:\n\nDirected and produced by Brooklyn-based production company Smartypants, the commercial features Stewart’s iconically slow, thoughtful voice saying, “I guess every town has a flavor all its own. But this one seems to have more than most. This town… Perched on the edge of the prairie… Where it can never lose sight of its past, and can see the future forever… Fort Worth, Texas. The unexpected city.”\n\nStewart’s voice pours like maple syrup over an evocative, string-led musical background, interspersed with sound effects of a prairie wind, a rodeo, country music line dancing, and more.\n\nMeanwhile, we see glimpses of different visitors: a boy, a man, and two young women, who explore Fort Worth’s sights, museums, aquariums, and honky tonks.\n\nFlashback to 1977\n\nOK, here’s how they got Jimmy Stewart’s voice. The Hollywood legend actually did the voiceover track for a 1977 short film called “The Unexpected City,” which you can see by going here. (If you think we live in a faster-paced world today, you’re right—the original version was a full 16 minutes long.)\n\nAccording to Visit Fort Worth, the 1977 film was a gift to the city from the First National Bank of Fort Worth. It features locals who were well-known in the 1970s, including Steve Murrin, philanthropist Alann Sampson, journalist Bob Ray Sanders, and Charles Tandy, founder of the Tandy Corporation.\n\nStewart donated his proceeds to the Fort Worth Zoo\n\nJimmy Stewart really was a fan of the city, Visit Fort Worth says. A friend of F. Kirk Johnson, the Fort Worth Zoo Association Board president at the time, Stewart visited the zoo for decades and donated his proceeds from the short film to the zoo as well. He volunteered his time to create PSAs, Visit Fort Worth added.\n\nKnowing what we know of Jimmy Stewart’s character, that’s not unexpected at all.\n\nGet on the list.\n\nDallas Innovates, every day.\n\nSign up to keep your eye on what’s new and next in Dallas-Fort Worth, every day."
