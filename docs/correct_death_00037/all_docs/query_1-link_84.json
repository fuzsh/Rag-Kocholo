        "text": "Our beloved James died peacefully at home in Sidney, BC on Friday February 16, 2024. Predeceased by Great Gramma Ellen Steele, Granny and Grandpa Ron and Lucy Stewart, and Grandpa Dr. Lawrence Pazder. Survived by mom and dad Sue (nee Stewart) and Lawrence Pazder, brothers Alex, Justin (Michaela), Eric and our dog Rider. Also survived by gramma Marylyn Harris, several Aunts, Uncles, cousins and a large extended family.\n\nJames grew up in Sidney BC; attending Sidney Co-op Preschool, Sidney Elementary School, North Saanich Middle School and graduating from Parkland Secondary in June of 2013. He had made a lot of friends along the way and had an easy way with people; often becoming quick friends with new acquaintances.\n\nIn his heart, James was a musician; he loved playing music on his instruments, especially his guitars and ukulele. He enjoyed speeding down the ski hill, camping out in the wilds, and early-morning fishing trips. In his later years, he could often be found performing his music in the Rose Garden beside the Sidney Library or attending meditation & yoga classes at the Shoal Center.\n\nA Visitation will be held on Saturday, March 2, 2024, from 1:00-2:00 pm, with a Funeral Service to follow at 2:00 pm in the Sequoia Centre at McCall Gardens, 4665 Falaise Drive, Victoria. Internment and reception to follow.\n\nCondolences may be offered to the family below."
