        "text": "My 18 Week Ordeal of Double Trouble\n\nBy Dr. Lakshman Abeyagunawardene\n\nI thought of writing this article in order to share with readers of the Sunday island newspaper, my recent experience as a patient suffering from two illnesses at the same time. I could describe this period as sheer mental agony as I had to bear the social as well as possible medical consequences of illnesses that plagued me over a prolonged period. Writing newspaper articles in my opinion is one of the best ways in which at least one section of the community can be educated on Health issues.\n\nMy professional career called for frequent lectures to be given to a wide variety of target audiences ranging from postgraduate doctors preparing for examinations in Community Medicine and medical students, to humble village folks like new settlers in Mahaweli areas in the late seventies and early eighties. I always made it a point to emphasise the fact that the occurrence of disease is not only a biological phenomenon but a social one as well, a point that I picked up in my postgraduate training and which has somehow got etched in my mind through conviction. Subsequent developments as described later led to the worst period when I was confined to the Guests’ Room in my home as I was not permitted even to climb the stairs that led to my comfortable bedroom upstairs. The move which was to last several weeks, involved shifting many personal items which were indispensable in day to day life.\n\nIt all began with a rash on the right side of my face involving the nose, cheek and areas around the eye. Although I suspected Herpes Zoster (commonly called Shingles) particularly because I recalled a bout of Chicken Pox over 50 years ago, soon after my Internship while working at the Colombo South Hospital. Although it is a self-limiting disease, I decided to seek medical attention because as far as possible, I try to stay away from self treatment except for very minor illnesses. Herpes Zoster is a viral infection that occurs with reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus that had been lying dormant in certain nerves for many years. Symptoms typically start with pain and a rash along the affected path of the nerve, followed 2-3 days later by a vesicular eruption.\n\nWith an all hours curfew in force, that weekend happened to be one where all “Channel Centres” were deserted. I , therefore, decided to go to the Emergency Room (ER) of Sri Jayewardenepura Hospital (SJPH) where the doctor confirmed my diagnosis and prescribed an antiviral drug called Acyclovir, pain killers Gabapentin and Panadeine. I was also referred to the Ophthalmic (Eye) Ward because my right eye seemed to be affected. Fortunately, the Senior Registrar on duty ruled out any involvement of the eye and said that my vision was normal. This was confirmed by the Consultant Ophthalmologist (Eye Surgeon) whom I later channelled as I was very concerned about my eyesight. As always, I diligently took all prescribed drugs but at the end of two weeks, I, unfortunately, developed Postherpetic Neuralgia (PHN) which is a known complication of Shingles.\n\nI had heard of Post Herpetic Neuralgia (PHN) but never imagined that it was so painful. In general, all pain due to Neuralgia is very painful, difficult to treat and lasts a long time. I realized through experience, what it is like to be the sufferer rather than a doctor treating a patient.\n\nQuite apart from my present illness, I was having spells of dizziness off and on, which I attributed to Gabapentin which is known to cause such side effects. On one such occasion, it was so bad that I was about to fall. Fortunately, we were in our bedroom and my wife was at hand to prevent the fall and led me to my bed. My wife was quite helpless in such situations and called my son who lived close by and called for an ambulance. My son and the ambulance arrived almost simultaneously, but as I had not lost consciousness, I was able to explain to the paramedics that I was on Gabapentin and did not need hospitalization. Whether or not the paramedics understood what I said, they withdrew mainly because their patient was a doctor and knew what he was doing!\n\nOn a subsequent occasion, I had a syncopal (fainting) attack while I was having breakfast and my wife again had to go through the usual motions of calling my son and informing the ambulance. This time, I had lost consciousness and when I was back to normal, I myself thought that it could not have been due to the Gabapentin. Therefore, I didn’t resist hospitalization as I previously did. These two episodes clearly showed the importance of family support. I dread to think what a bachelor living alone would have done under such circumstances.\n\nFor a number of years, I have been having an irregular pulse. This drew my attention when it continued and my cardiologist referred me to a Cardiologist and Electrophysiologist who put me on what is called a Holter Monitor. After reading the report he said that I have a few extrasystoles (ectopic beats) and that accounts for the irregular pulse. He further said that it is normal for some people and I needed no treatment. Mind you, that was about six years ago.\n\nThis time round when I lost consciousness, to cut a long story short, after the necessary referrals were made, the EEG that my Neurologist ordered showed some changes and my doctors decided that the origins of the changes had nothing to do with my nervous system but that its origins were cardiac (meaning that the origin of the EEG changes could be due to some defective movement of electrical impulses in the heart). So, I went back to my cardiologist who referred me to a Cardiologist and Electrophysiologist. The latter put me on a Holter Monitor again. Based on the history and the new Holter Monitor reading, he recommended a Pacemaker. I readily complied and he implanted a Permanent Pacemaker on September 8th. Sutures were removed after about a week and I had to attend a “Programming Session” on September 27th. The doctor reported that the surgical wound was clean and that the whole procedure was successful. The implantation of the pacemaker did not bother me at all, but the anxiety of anyone facing a surgical operation was telling on me.\n\nI had to go through the procedure of pacemaker implantation while the pain in my right eye persisted. It was after my fainting episode and pacemaker implantation was recommended that I was debarred from climbing stairs. I was confined to the Guests’ Room and this is where my agony really started. My wife did not allow me to go even to the living room which was just three steps below. Towards the latter stages, I watched the news on the small TV in the kitchen. I had to be satisfied with the laptop computer that my son brought. But it was a far cry from the Desktop I was used to. I missed my weekly shot of an alcoholic drink! I had not taken even a beer since the beginning of June.\n\nI think I had a turnaround in my fortunes after the doctor did the Programming on September 27th. It was this doctor’s advice that I strictly followed (more so my wife and son) because there was nothing more the Neurologist who was treating my neuralgic pain could do. The electrophysiologist who did the pacemaker implantation asked me to resume my regular evening walk but advised me not to drive the car till the end of October. When I asked him whether I could take my weekly shot of an alcoholic drink, he jokingly asked me whether it was Single Malt or Scotch. I replied that I take Single Malt, Scotch, Gin, Rum, Vodka, Tequila and even Ceylon Arrack in rotation, depending on availability. More than anything else, I was happy to be back in my bedroom, using my toilet, 52 inch TV in the TV room and the Desktop in my study.\n\nOnce the Eye Surgeon said that my vision is intact and the Cardiologist had successfully implanted the Pacemaker, I was free to take some decisions on my own. As I was bothered by the persisting pain in the eye, I went back to using Gabapentin when the eye pain was severe (discontinued since that episode of dizziness). Picking up information from the Internet, I started trying some home remedies like washing my eyes and using a warm compress frequently. I also started taking a course of Vitamin B Complex and refrained from eating Bananas and Citrus fruits to help in the recovery of damaged nerves. If I continue to recover from the eye pain and the other minor symptoms of PHN, I will not be able to pinpoint and say that it was one specific intervention named above that was responsible for the turnaround. Being a doctor myself also certainly helped in many instances. However, I had resigned myself to think that recovery from PHN is very, very slow. As I recover slowly from PHN, I painfully realized the plight of many who are affected by Neuralgic pain and continue to suffer.\n\nAs a precautionary measure, I still keep away from my mobile phone and the microwave oven. The Pacemaker also restricts my movements of the left arm. I will continue to live with such restrictions for some more time. But I know that I have already seen and experienced the worst of this period of agony.\n\nADDENDUM by ACTING ADMIN\n\nThis is written mainly for the benefit of those who don't read Sri Lanka newspapers.\n\nLucky’s article appeared in the Island on-line newspaper on Sunday 25th of October and here is the link:-\n\nhttps://island.lk/my-18-week-ordeal-of-double-trouble/\n\nJ.C Fernando – A Fine Athlete, Medic and a Gentleman by Nihal D Amerasekera\n\nJanaka Chandana Fernando (J.C)– the name raises a smile on everyone’s face. He is a force of nature that brings happiness to everyone around him. Gregarious, sociable and flamboyant are all descriptions that come to mind to portray a person whom we have all come to know and love since medical school days. He had that irrepressible bohemian flair which was associated with medical students of the 1960’s. In our citadel in Kynsey Road no one epitomised the era more than JC. He enjoyed its trappings abundantly. Being from that great institution, Royal College, he knew the large contingent from that school that filled our batch and almost filled the rest of the Faculty of Medicine. JC became a part of the Faculty sooner than most.\n\nI first got to know him during the infamous rag. He knew many of the raggers but got no reprieve. He struggled like the rest of us. JC didn’t suffer the indignities gladly. In his usual forthright manner, he did let them know how he felt, muttering under his breath, what he thought of it all.\n\nMany will remember JC arriving at the Faculty cycle shed every morning in his Honda 50 motor-cycle. The Canteen was his first port of call for the customary Tea-Punt. He was a popular guy in our batch and spoke with everyone and was friendly to all. With his affable ways JC made friends with the girls more easily. This made the rest of the boys envious. JC was never shy to speak his mind and with his loud voice he stood out in a crowd. Born to blush unseen, we always made fun of his jet-black skin which he accepted with civility. For his regal demeanour, I often called him the ‘Dark Knight’. All through medical school he wore white shirts and trousers. This enhanced the contrast no end.\n\nJC was an outstanding athlete at Royal College. I recall seeing his name in the sports pages of the daily newspapers for his many achievements at school and inter-school athletics. In 1957, JC broke the school’s inter-house 440 yards record held by Summa Navaratnam, at the Colombo South Group Meet, an impressive feat indeed. However, J.C. could only manage 2nd place at the Public Schools meet. In the 4x440 yards relay, Royal came first with a new Public Schools record. The team consisted of W.S.M. Abeysekera, A. Jayaweera, R. Wickremaratne and J.C. Fernando. They were awarded Public Schools Athletics colours Royal won both Senior Tarbet and Jefferson cups. At the Public Schools Meet in 1958 JC was placed first in the 440 yards. In that same year Royal College again won the 4x440 yards relay breaking the record set the year before. The team of superb athletes consisted of J.C Fernando, B.A Fernando, Asoka Dissanayake and Asoka Jayaweera. In the 4x100 yards relay - 1958, the Royal College team consisting of J.C Fernando, Asoka Dissanayake, F.H Ghaffar and F.H Ghafoor came second to Ananda College. That year Royal College won the Jefferson Challenge Cup for Relays. The pinnacle of his achievements was in 1958 when JC captained the Royal College Athletics team that won the 4x440 yards relay breaking the Public Schools Record. For their brilliant performance the richly talented team consisting of Asoka Dissanaike, J C Fernando, Asoka Jayaweera and Asoka Fernando won the Public School Colours, a great honour for a rare feat. To my knowledge, he never bragged about those brilliant achievements. Despite being vocal his simplicity stood out. In later years, at his old school, JC was the medical doctor and physical training instructor for the rugby and cricket teams for two decades. For his loyalty, presently he is a Vice-President of the Royal College Union. He is particularly proud of his magnificent collection of cups, medals and trophies from those golden years. They now proudly adorn his trophy cabinet.\n\nJC was tenacious, competitive and single-minded. He knew what he wanted and did what was necessary to achieve his goals. His determination never faltered. Once he had an idea in his head, there was no letting go of it. He is often frank and candid and this attracted controversy. In any argument he was persuasive. JC was never a push-over and fought his corner to the very end. Perhaps these are characteristics of competitive sportsmen. Despite all this, he was charming, helpful and kind and was well-liked.\n\nGaining entrance to the Faculty of Medicine in the 1960’s was a gargantuan task. The available spaces were limited, there were hordes of applicants and the competition was fierce. To be a top athlete he had the natural ability and talent and the discipline to practice regularly. This required staying in the school grounds at the end of the school day. Returning home late in the evening, tired, one required stamina and self-discipline to get back to books and revision. Hence to gain entrance to the Faculty of Medicine demanded much more than intelligence and the Midas touch. We were fortunate to have several fine sportsmen and women in our batch who had the grit, determination and the strength of character to be successful. They added an extra dimension to our batch.\n\nHe had tremendous enthusiasm for the social events in medical school. Being a fine musician, many of us got to know JC at the social functions. We sang and danced at the memorable and raucous evening booze-ups in the Men’s Common Room. My abiding memory at these events is the lithe figure of the ‘Dark Knight’ strumming his guitar, singing in graphic detail the itchy tale of “the dance of the phthirus pubis”. His signature song was “Saima cut wela” a tragic tale of a beginner’s hangover and an effective home remedy. He sang “Suranganee-ta malu genawa”, tempting fate long before they became a pair!! Those songs have never left my recall. As I listen to them now on YouTube I’m transported to those happy days of our youth. He was ever-present at the dances held at the King George’s Hall of the University’s Science Faculty, twisting the night away to the music of the Harold Seneviratne Combo. Those evenings generated much gossip and scandalous tales of adventures. He capped it all with an enduring contribution to the Final year trip making the days brighter and the nights merrier. This will remain a special memory.\n\nIn the rigid and grim environment of medical education, the Men’s Common Room was our refuge from the storms of life. I can still picture JC in that setting with a fag between his lips holding a cup of tea. He joined in the billiards, table tennis, carrom and the never-ending chit chats. He was an entertaining talker. If the truth be told he could be prickly and argumentative and there were frosty moments too. All through medical school my memories of JC are of a colourful, jolly guy ever ready for a chat and a laugh. He could talk about anything and everything. I associate him with much of our faculty jargon like ‘tea-punt’ and ’pol-mess machang’ and numerous vivid unprintable expressions delivered with a mischievous smile. These words he used frequently and to great effect. I could still picture him walking the long corridors of the GHC greatly animated, waving his arms relating a story. His tales were peppered with esoteric facts and his own brand of humour brilliantly embellished for good effect. I loved listening to his tales no matter how outrageous. Whether one agreed or disagreed with his views he presented them in such an amusing manner he could even make nonsense sound like a genuine and alluring revelation.\n\nWith the “Finals” came the great dispersal in 1967. I lost contact with JC for several years. Both Sura and JC after a stint in the UK forged successful careers in Hong Kong. There his work in Orthopaedic Surgery flourished and he was greatly valued and respected. Those happy times were curtailed eventually by the demanding concerns for the education of their two daughters. I was a regular visitor to Hong Kong which was my wife’s country of birth. It would have been lovely to catch up with JC and Suranganie, only if I knew. I would have cherished their wonderful company, enjoyed the fine Hong Kong cuisine and shared in his first-hand knowledge of the best watering holes in town.\n\nI haven’t been a part of the multiple batch reunions in Sri Lanka. Hence our last meeting was around 2003. This was with Lucky Abeygunawardene and we met up at the Singhalese Sports Club. JC joined us for drinks and dinner. The ambience, good food and the ‘double-distilled’ brought out the best in JC. Many of the old stories resurfaced with the perennial batch tales and gossip to round off a memorable evening. This indeed I will treasure. Rarely boring or predictable, sometimes outrageous, JC is excellent company. His parting shot was to say that I have now acquired a British accent which he reiterated on Facetime a couple of years later. To a rustic from the wilderness of Kegalle, this is a feather to my cap. Although not quite in the digital world, JC sent me emails giving his forthright views and observations about life back home.\n\nWe all recognise our batch as a tribe and the deep friendships akin to a form of tribalism. Both JC and Sura are faithful to the tribe and their old friends. I am aware they have been enthusiastic, generous and hospitable entertainers to the multitude of winter visitors from our batch and also to our medical community in Colombo. They have had a fascinating life together working in several countries, enjoying a good social life. Their two daughters have done them proud.\n\nJC has had a rewarding professional career. We have enjoyed his company, humanity and joie de vivre. I do wish JC and Suranganie a long and happy retirement. His is a good life well lived and long may it last. By his achievements, he has made his mark in the history of that great school.\n\nAcknowledgements: My grateful thanks to Prof Sanath Lamabadusuriya for his inspiration and research.

Last but not least thanks to Suranganie for her support and sending those brilliant photos that lit up the script.\n\nSeries 1, No 1 October 5th 2020\n\nNote by the Editor: This is the first of a new series featuring the inimitable Harsha Boralessa aka “Bora”, who has the knack of recalling humorous incidents “like no other”.\n\nA batchmate ahead of his time…….\n\nThis story was related by a batchmate who attended a tutorial given by Prof Dissanayake to a group of students who needed to be galvanized before the exams in 1966. He discussed and asked questions on the transmission of malaria. The interesting part was the answer given by a student. possibly about P Ovale which is prevalent in Africa, but was at the time, being detected sporadically in Sri Lanka.\n\nThe student said that the infected mosquitoes board the VC 10 in Nairobi and leave the aircraft at Ratmalana and are let loose, to transmit the parasite to people in Sri Lanka.\n\nAt the time, the thought of mosquitoes travelling in aircrafts was unheard of and so preposterous that the whole group, including the Prof, burst into fits of laughter. So much so, when Prof asked him, in light-hearted vein, “What do the mosquitoes feed on during the six-hour flight”? “Orange juice” was his answer. At the time we found this entire interaction hilarious, but it was soon forgotten.\n\nHowever decades later ….in 1990s, it all came back, when I read an article in the BMJ entitled “Airport Malaria”. Five locals born in England and who had never been abroad, all living within a five-mile radius of London Gatwick Airport had confirmed malaria infection.\n\nAfter much debate and discussion, the conclusion was that mosquitoes do travel in aircrafts. Following this finding, the fumigation of aircrafts before take-off commenced.\n\nIt is a great pity that I cannot remember the name of this batchmate of ours who had this brilliant original thought that provoked so much amusement.\n\nHaemorrhoids……A Misdiagnosis\n\nRemember the surgical wards at the GHC (now NHSL) with broad corridors and well-maintained lawns between wards? A newly appointed consultant surgeon followed by his entourage of medical students was walking towards his ward when he spotted a man on the lawn in a squatting position (legs flexed at the knees, buttocks almost touching the ground and arms folded in front of the chest), in Sinhalese referred to as “Anna gahagena innawa ”.\n\nThe boss stopped abruptly and exclaimed “typical posture for someone with piles”, hoping to instil in his students the value of observation. He then pointed to B.L. Perera who was tasked with asking the man the relevant “leading questions” to confirm his diagnosis.\n\nOn being quizzed the man replied that he had no such ailment and was merely waiting to take “Simon Aiyah home on his discharge from the ward!”.\n\nInternship\n\nI started my internship at General Hospital Colombo under Dr John Rasamuthu Wilson - a former Royal college cricket captain, a gentleman to the core and a very kind person.\n\nDuring my first ward round, he discharged three patients to be sent home on ADT. Throughout the ward round, I was trying to work out “what the hell this was”!. I kept asking myself, how is it that I do not have a clue about this common drug which had been prescribed to three patients. All three patients had vague symptoms and no specific diagnosis. Could A.D.T be a mnemonic?\n\nI couldn’t concentrate on the ward round and whispering quietly, asked the sister, “What is ADT?”\n\nShe replied, “That means “Any Damn Thing”.\n\nAwait the next instalment of Bora’s Banter soon!"
