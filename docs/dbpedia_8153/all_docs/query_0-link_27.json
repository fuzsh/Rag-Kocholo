        "text": "Fathers\n\nAmong the business enterprise folks we have, C. Abeywickrema, ST Aziez, Mazher Fazleali, MR Perera, the late Naveen Rajapakse, Rohantha Samarajeewa, Kirthi Seneviratne, Preman Soysa, and KM Totamune.\n\nPothey Guras\n\nVish Vedage has achieved the MSc (Eng.), M.Phil, CEng, CMarEng, MIE (SL), AMIMechE, MIET, and was leading the HNC program in Electronics and Communication Engineering at Newham College of Further Education in the UK.\n\nGeethapriya Salgado is the only member of the '59 Group with a professional qualification in Library & Information Science obtained from the University of Colombo.\n\nHe served the University of Colombo, then spent a short stint in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, moved back to Sri Lanka to work with Gateway College, Colombo, as their first Librarian and, later on, as Registrar.\n\nOthers who ventured into the field of academics and education are, SJ Bahar, R Rajasooriar, R Chandrasena, and Melwin Mallawarachchi.\n\nShiran Guneratne, CPBT Jayasundera, the late P Dias, and the late Wilhelm Koch were all engaged in the plantation Industry.\n\nThe Redeemers\n\nWhile school days were a long and winding road quite a distance away from kneeling at altars, we still had a few decent men who took the straight path and walked in the way of God towards salvation.\n\nThe Rev. Roger Herft in Australia, The Rev. RM Attiken in Europe, and Ruchi L Perera in Sri Lanka, have led their flock over the mountain, having learned all the tips and tricks of “goodness” from those halcyon days at Royal, since 1959.\n\nRoger held the position of the Bishop in the Anglican Church of Australia. He was Previously the Bishop of Newcastle and the Bishop of Waikato. Roger was made a Member of the Order of Australia in 2013 for the services rendered to the church, particularly in interfaith relations and social justice\n\nAttikenearned a Doctor of Ministry degree at the United Theological Seminary in Dayton, Ohio (USA) in 1995.\n\nOther Professions\n\nDon Hapuarachchi and LCC de Silva: moved into the Timber/Furniture Industry. Hapu passed away after a brief illness in 2020.\n\nBryce Fernando: joined the United Nations Organization and moved to The Netherlands.\n\nDPL\n\nWhat a great honor the group received when our erstwhile, enthusiastic, and energetic past president and also former Chairman of George Steuart & Company Ltd., Somasunderam Skandakumar, was appointed as the Sri Lankan High Commissioner in Australia in 2017.\n\nShakers & Swingers\n\nIf ever the group can be proud of a talented musician, par excellence, whose passion for playing guitar ran through his veins, it is none other than PR Puvanendrarajah, affectionately known as “Puvi” by the boys, and who, later, took the stage name of IndraRaj. Puvi’s craze for music was unimaginable. His choice of dress code, imitating the great musicians of our time, was totally hip. His rise to fame after joining the leading band in the island, The Jetliners, is well known to all. He now performs in Europe as a top notch lead guitar player. May his music play on, forever.\n\nOther western musicians in the group are Sunil Abhayasinghe of Elvis Presley fame, Loranjan Dias Abeygunewardene, who is now a professional musician in Ireland, and Fazli Sameer, a jazz drummer who now teaches music in his dotage.\n\nGit Wickremasinghe was also a saxophonist in a band, “Jazz Academy”, which, among other things, did gigs on cruise liners in the Med and Caribbean. He conducted the classical orchestra of University College and directed stage musicals such as Guys and Dolls and West Side Story. Git is also a keen classical and jazz pianist, still doing gigs.\n\nFounders\n\nWe will, certainly, be failing in our duty if we do not mention the names of the late Rohan Fernando and KPG Fernando, who were the backbone of setting up the ’59 Group Alumni in the first place. Their valiant effort, strongly supported by the rest of the Mohicans, has kept the group afloat through 50+ years of ‘59ing, if you may want to call it that. Had it not been for them we would not have gathered here today. Bless them all.\n\n0O0\n\nThe ’59 Group Library Project – Chari Ratwatte\n\nThe Library project which was launched by the ’59 Group at Royal has been the cynosure of all achievements we have made through the years as a form of giving back to College for the glory that College has given us. Many were the members who put their hands up to support this project and see its fruition to the end.\n\nChari sums up the story well, when he states, “It all started when I was driving my son, on Saturday mornings, from Library to Library, the Public, the British Council, USIS etc. I asked him about the College Library”. He responded, “what library?” I gave him directions on how to find it. He returned from College and said, “it is totally locked up, and a huge padlock hangs on the main door”. I went up to College, and, to my horror, found, that the library was closed because they had no librarian to manage it\n\n“That very week, the '59 Group Committee met, and, I took the opportunity to mention this sad state of affairs to the group. We decided to take the matter up with the then Principal. This set off a chain of events that eventually resurrected the library from its “Rip Van Winkle” slumber. We put our heads together and managed to hire a Librarian, who\n\ndeveloped a program to improve the facility as it was in a totally dilapidated state.\n\nGeethapriya Salgado, contributed his professional expertise in library management and also put us in contact with others, including a University Professor, who supported the project. Fund raising followed with many hands being extended, generously, to finance the various needs of the project.”\n\nIn the coming years, we also managed to find another College Alumni Group, much junior to us, to twin with us, for the long term sustainability of the project. They will carry the flag forward when we are all gone from this planet.\n\nThere is also a deposit with RCU Trust, the biggest one, which is an endowment for the Library Development Program.\n\n0O0\n\nTwo cents worth from Nihal and Naizer\n\nNaizer kicks off with the fact that it was sometime in the early 80s that he bumped into Rohan Perera at Lakehouse, and, he related that he was in touch with Metha to try and get all the old 59’ers together to form an alumni group. Eventually, his dream materialized in 1988 with an inaugural meeting that was held at College. Rohan, KPG, Nihal, Bamuna, RSR. and Naizer attended, along with a few others who were formed into a committee of management.\n\nRohan was unanimously elected as the founder President. R. S. R. emphasized the need to draft a decent constitution which was done later and adopted. It was Charithas idea to embark on the Library Project as a service since the facility was in a very dilapidated condition and also locked up for many months.\n\nThe group made an inventory of the available books that still remained in the library, retained some of the good ones and had to discard the rest that were of no value on account of their poor condition. We also refurbished the library, including the furniture, and several members donated books, magazines, and periodicals, on a continuous basis to keep the facility growing. Thanks to Hapu for replacing all the newspaper stands.\n\nThe guys then initiated a project to identify, locate and list all the ‘59ers with their contacts and professions. Group meetings were held, on a regular basis, at various venues, supplemented with Vadai and Tea, and even I had the privilege of hosting a few at my office down Fareed Place, at Bambalapitiya.\n\nDuring this period we managed to kick off several fundraising projects to supplement our financial resources in order to be able to give back to College for many of its programs. One was the Army Band show, and the others were four benefit shows held at the Liberty Cinema followed up by a very successful raffle draw. KPG was the Secretary and Nihal was the treasurer, during this era.\n\nAll proceeds from these projects, amounting to almost two million Rupees, were deposited into an endowment fund with the RCU The fund was secured by a condition laid down in\n\nthe constitution which stated that they were to be utilized for value added projects as decided by the committee of management.\n\nAfter the sad demise of Rohan, several other “young” and able members took over the management and continued the good work which was started. Annual reunion events were held, on a regular basis, during the Royal-Thomian and Bradby Shield events, in order to keep the lads together.\n\nA medical fund was mooted for the benefit of group members who may be need assistance. Members living abroad responded positively and contributed towards this cause. Later on, it was decided to hand over and share some of the activities of the group with the ‘93 Group, in order to ensure continuity since we were running behind time in a big way.\n\nNihal chips in as follows:- Let’s get down to the 59ers, first. Machang, l drifted into the ’59 Group Committee with the tide, as, l had the founder Treasurer's post thrust upon me with gusto, and I was just able to do, the little that l could, to try and help an awesome bunch of people – you guys of course - achieve something extraordinary for many more young Royalists to come.\n\nThere were many players who helped, and they are too numerous to name. A few come to my, somewhat forgetful mind; Rohan, KPG., RSR. (behind the scenes in true CID “James Bond” fashion), Ando, Mazher Fazleali, Don Hapuarachchi, Al Haj MBM Naizar, the late Hema Bamunawela, Upali de Livera, the late Gamini “Keti” de Silva, Sarath Perera, Geethapriya Salgado, Rohantha Samarajeewa, N. R. Senanayake, Keerthi Seneviratne, Skandakumar, Sarath Suriyasinghe, Sunil Wimaladharma, also chipped in during the latter years.\n\nDuring the initial stages of the project, many of them spent every single Saturday at the Library for a few months on end, re-arranging, cleaning and reorganizing the place. It would be an injustice to mention names, I'd rather say it was the 59’er spirit that did it and, eventually, saw it through to fruition. A monumental task, it was, if any of you may recall what the Library had slipped back into, performed with dedication and commitment by a host of very highly focused, not so old, 59’ers then.\n\nReally, the idea of refurbishing the library came from Chari, but the coordination and motivation to see it through came from “Hitler”. . . oops sorry, the late KPG. As l clearly remember, he was as a ’59 Group committee member, the driving force behind us all, for over 30 years. To say that KPG. was amiable and benevolent, nevertheless a dictator of the highest order, would be putting it somewhat mildly. He goaded us with subtle threats, at times, and got the job done. At the time of his untimely passing, he was documenting all the work the 59’ers had done on the Library project. Sadly, this could not be completed by him. I have requested his son, Chamath, for a copy of his notes, if he could lay his hands on them. Chamath is a successful and busy lawyer, today.\n\nSarath Perera and his lovely wife, Ranji get a very special mention, as they, initially, very willingly and readily, opened up their lovely home many times, when we, initially,\n\nhad no place/funds to host a few get-togethers. l really mean opened-up because nothing\n\nwas spared by them in making the event/s the success they eventually turned out to be. Booze, music, staff; nothing was held back.\n\nFazli, you too, should take a deep bow for all the unsung work you did in covering us with a very comprehensive and updated website of our own, during those tiring years. Whatever you do don’t cut this part out, please, as the guys must realize and know what you have done for the Group, dealing with a lunatic or two in the process. No prizes for guessing who, though!\n\nThree, or maybe four, films were screened at the Liberty Cinema in aid of the 59 Group Library fund. There were also a few raffles, and a show by the Army Cultural Troupe, held at the Elphinstone Theatre. This was organized by our very own “Hitler”. . . oops, sorry again, KPG, through his buddy Captain Delwela. KPG, single-handedly compered the entire. evenings proceedings and did a great job of it. Salute!\n\nAt one stage we had over Rs. 4 million plus in our 59 Group Endowment fund with the RCU. This is the highest collection made by any single RC Alumni Group. I think this has stood for many years, and probably still is, despite our refurbishing the Library recently under Sunil “Bakey” Wimaladharma’s astute stewardship. The recent hand holding with the RC ’93 Alumni Group, did a great job in coordinating the “sprucing up” of the facility and also introducing the electronic modernization of the main Library.\n\nIn the formative years we did call for inputs and comments from the 59 Group General Membership. It was Sydney “baba” Gunasekera who enlightened us with the somewhat dis-quieting news that one day there will be no ‘59 Group members left. It was, then, suggested that we should pass the Library project on to a younger alumni Group to continue the good work that we had started. This suggestion was unanimously accepted by the then committee, as both, Naizar and Sunil will confirm. The RC ‘93 Group has extended a hand to us, in the recent past, for restoring the library, under the good old, and able, Sunil. They have helped us to do an excellent job. If there may be any other similar younger alumni groups willing to join hands with us in this venture, we should pursue them with gusto. Younger groups will do fine and will be able to carry the legacy of maintaining the Library for another 25 years, a least, before passing the baton to other suitable groups to come.\n\nMany humorous incidents took place whilst collecting funds for the Library Project. One interesting event that comes to my mind was a newspaper report from the Horana correspondent of the Ceylon Daily News, l think, who mentioned that the local traffic “Kossa’s” were stopping motorists and subtly offering them 59 Group Raffle Tickets to purchase in lieu of prosecution fines for traffic offenses. This was finally traced back to our grand old RSR I vividly recall cornering him and asking him about this. With his typical cherubic smile, he said, \"machang, we have to sell tickets no?” That was RSR. who then switched back to his inscrutable poker face without actually denying the allegation.\n\nSOME OF OUR MENTORS – captured by Brian Lieversz\n\nMr Thavaneetarajah (Thavam)\n\nI remember we were in one of the new classrooms overlooking the college grounds and there was a cricket match being played on the main grounds. This was the time when Darrell (my brother) was playing. We were in class and Thavam came to take it. He had a look out of the window and realized the match was on. After 10 minutes, and after a few more anxious glances out of the window, he turned to us and said in a loud whisper, \"there's a match going on, our 1st eleven is playing, you guys can “scoot” off two by two and go watch the match. “Don't all go out together, but get lost in the grounds.” It was the way he said 'two by two' that made us all smile. We did as we were told of course. He actually made this a common feature. Come to think of it? I really don’t know what he actually taught in College, but he was sure “crazy” about cricket. He was a good old soul.\n\nMr HC Arulanandan (Arul)\n\nArul taught us Chemistry. it was not one of my favorite subjects. Anyway, one day he said to me in utter disgust, \"If you pass your GCE in Chemistry, I will give up teaching.\" The exams started, we were in one of the Classrooms next to the Hostel. Chemistry came along, and one of the students finished very early. He obviously took the paper to one of the studious hostel boys who began shouting out the answers. I “cashed” in on that, and, listening carefully, and managed to answer all the required questions correctly. The guy calling out was very clear, stating \"Question 1, 1st part, and he'd give the answer. it went on for quite some time. So, I completed them all. The results came after some weeks and I passed in Chemistry. Wow!!\n\nI ran to Aruls classroom (the Lab). He saw me standing in the corridor and came out and asked me what I wanted. I said, \"Sir, guess what? I passed in Chemistry. Not that I wanted him to give up teaching like he said he would, But I was excited myself. He said, \"I knew you could do it son\", and he actually gave me a hug.\n\nMr MT Thambapillai (Thamba)\n\nOur lovable rugby Master in Charge! We had arrived at Trinity College in Kandy and were tired from the Coach trip. The TC master in charge came up to us and with his outstretched hand approached Thamba and excitedly said, \"Welcome Mr Thambapillai, welcome! welcome! welcome!\" and, Thamba, obviously very tired from road the trip was taken by surprise, replied ,\"yes welcome! welcome! Sir.\n\nIN MEMORIUM – as at Jun 2021\n\n“They have gone before us. We will certainly follow them. May the turf lie softly upon their chests”\n\n1. RGA de Silva\n\n2. Thusitha Cooray\n\n3.

Prior to that year, he, together with his sisters, attended CMS Ladies College for his primary education. That was an era where, in the 50s/60s, when boys were allowed to hang around in girls’ schools till they were 10.\n\nBala was always that laid-back chap in school, taking life in a very easy-paced manner, as if tomorrow never comes. He was never rushing after anything, and took life so easily. His love for sports and music was exemplified, especially in his later years when he became a great contributor to the Radio Ceylon page on FB. Photography was also another great love he cherished very much. His FB wall is loaded with music and memories in pictures of people and events he encountered in his daily life.\n\nBanking was Bala’s forte in Sri Lanka and in the UK, where he went to live in 2005, even though he still retained his Sri Lankan passport, maintaining his status as a dual citizen. His English winters were always spent in sunny Sri Lanka when he never failed to make it to the Royal-Thomian cricket match in March each year.\n\nProfessor Balakumaran was a Management Consultant and Trainer, and was also a former Assistant General Manager at the Seylan Bank, PLC in Sri Lanka. He was considered to be the most professionally qualified banker in the island at that time, having obtained his Ph.D from the University of Honolulu, USA.\n\nHe was also the first recipient from Sri Lanka to be awarded the Financial Studies Diploma (Dip. FS), the highest qualification of the Chartered Institute of Bankers, London, as well as being one of the first four persons to obtain the Diploma in Bank Management from the Institute of Bankers, Sri Lanka.\n\nHe was also awarded Fellowships by the Chartered Institute of Bankers, London (FCIB) and the Institute of Bankers, Sri Lanka (FIB).\n\nAmong his many illustrious accolades, are an MBA from the Postgraduate Institute of Management, University of Sri Jayawardenapura, as well as Postgraduate Certificates in Human Resource Management in Banks, and Asset and Liability Management from the PIM. He is was also an Associate of the Institute of Credit Management in Sri Lanka.\n\nBala, initially graduated from the University of Madras, after which he joined the Hatton National Bank, in Colombo, in 1974. Thereafter, he moved to The Union Bank of the Middle East Ltd in 1981 where he took up roles in Banking Operations, Customer Services.\n\nBala then joined Seylan Bank Ltd in Sri Lanka, in October 1989. He was installed as the youngest President of the Chartered Institute of Bankers, Colombo Centre in 1996. During his tenure of Presidency in 1996/1997 the Colombo Centre won the Best Local Centre of the Year award, and the first prize in the International group for 1996/1997.\n\nHe had the honor to receive the award from Sir Brian Pitman, the CIB President at that time, at the ceremony held in London.\n\nBala was in Colombo this year too and attended the group AGM in March where he was able to reconnect with many of us at a sumptuous hopper dinner at the Capri Club in Colombo. He even signed the propositions of the new office bearers for 2019/20, who were all elected unanimously.\n\nI spent many a moment with Bala during his visit this year. We enjoyed many breakfasts and tea at kiosks in Wellawatte, visited our old English Literature master at Royal, Mr John Henry de Saram at his residence in Lauries Road, Bambalapitiya, and also trekked often to the GLO photo shop in Wellawatte to have his pictures on his camera and phone printed for his hard copy collection. I happened to bump into the two young sales ladies at GLO last week, at Wellawatte, and they almost wept when I broke the sad news to them. They even insisted I keep them informed about his funeral arrangements so they could pay their last respects. That was how much people related, and were attached, to him on account of his friendly demeanor and humble attitude.\n\nIt was Bala’s wish to stay behind in Colombo to be a part of the two Bradby Shield Rugby games in Kandy and Colombo, but the lure of the World Cup in London took him away in May. He never failed to offer me a glass of EGB whenever I visited his flat down Canal Lane in Wellawatte. We spent many long hours in conversations about old times, people, and events.\n\nMany were the friends he had found on FB on account of his love for country music. He never missed a musical concert and his last picture on his FB wall shows him posing with Daniel O’Donnell at a recent concert which he attended.\n\nBala was also very much involved with the Hindu Temple administration and its management activities in Colombo. It was during our many memorable chats in Colombo that I discovered that he is a great-grandson of two of Sri Lanka's most illustrious patriots, the late Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan, Kt, CMG, KC, MLC, and the late Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam, Kt, MLC, CCS. He is the second son of the late S. Mahedeva, former Deputy Legal Draftsman.\n\nOne thing we all admire him is for his tremendous love for the school and the massive and colorful support he always displayed in attending school cricket and rugby matches, dressed up in blue and gold, wherever he lived.\n\nBala will be missed by us all. He now joins the 40+ other mates, from our Royal College Alumni ’59 Group of 218, who have moved on to the other side over the past decades. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his beautiful family.\n\nMay he Rest in Peace!\n\nVishwanath Vedage 1947-2019 by Fazli Sameer\n\nVishwanath Vedage, known to all his friends and family as “Vish”, was born on 29 Nov 1947 in Colombo, Sri Lanka, the oldest of five siblings. He was initially educated at Greenlands College from 1953, and then joined Royal College, Colombo, in 1959 to continue his secondary schooling. He passed away in June 2019 in the UK.\n\nWhile being a very quiet natured student at Royal, Vish was well known for dabbling in Einsteins’ Theory of relativity at a very early age. His thirst for knowledge in science was always a significant feature of his personality. His colleagues referred to him as “a quiet\n\nguy with an abundance of Metta (unconditional love) & Karuna (compassion)”.\n\nVish joined the Port Commission in Colombo as an Apprentice in Marine Engineering and completed the first examination of the Institute of Engineers, London. He later took up the position of Chief Engineer of the “Diyakaawa” Dredger of the Port Commission in Colombo and then moved to settle down in the UK in the 70s.\n\nVish married Moh Nee in 1984, in the UK, and they have a son, Dave, born in July 1991.\n\nHe went on to work as a lecturer at Newham College and later, at Havering, both in the UK, until his retirement.\n\nPost retirement, Vish continued his great passion for books and learning and was also heavily involved in many social and charitable projects for the deserving in Sri Lanka.\n\nIn 2013. Vish spoke of the importance of clean water and a possible solution through the installation of Rain Water Harvesting systems in the affected areas of Sri Lanka at the Hela Sarana Chronic Kidney Disease in Sri Lanka awareness workshop. He was a committee member of Hela Sarana, formed by a group of Sri Lankans in the UK in 1996. The charity has been actively involved in raising awareness and executing programs in fighting kidney disease in Sri Lanka and also in many other charitable activities.\n\nIn 2017 Vish and a few others, of the Royal College ‘59 Group he belonged to, contributed funds to help a needy Royalist to continue his higher studies.\n\nOver the years and recently, Vish visited and worked tirelessly in supporting the poor children in a village in Sri Lanka, by way of donations of computer equipment and other much needed learning resources.\n\nIt was only a few days before his passing that Vish and his close friend in Sri Lanka, K A Dayaratne, became aware that 72 students of Dimbulagala Mahawewa Primary School in Sri Lanka could not afford footwear. This led to the footwear project donation program which they both initiated. Unfortunately, Vish was unable to fulfill his part to complete the project. Dayaratne donated the shoes with his own funds in memory of Vish to fulfil his final quest for helping the poor.\n\nIn appreciation of his support to the school, the library in the school was named “Vishwanth Vedage Memorial Library” at M/Roshan Mahanama Vidayalaya, Weheratanne, Bogaswewa, in the Vavuniya istrict, in Sri Lanka.\n\nI had the good fortune of meeting up with Vish in London in 2011, after many decades after having left Royal College in 1967, where we caught up on many wonderful memories from our school days in the years gone by. The value of compassion, commitment and hard work were the driving force behind the much deserving charitable activities that Vish engaged in. May he Rest in Peace!\n\nRC HOSTEL 1959\n\nRow 1: (l-r) RG Hapuarachchi, ?, BN.Ranasinghe N.

Kahaduwe Chandajothi - A wonderful human being\n\nThe first Buddhist monk who taught at Royal was the Ven. Kahaduwe Chandajothi. He taught Sinhalese Language, Sinhalese Literature, Sanskrit, Pali, and Buddhism and was a very kind and amiable person.\n\nHe passed away sometime in the late sixties. His body was brought to the College hall prior to the cremation. Many old boys paid their last respects there.\n\nHe was a committed teacher, scholar in Pail, Sanskrit and Buddhist civilization. Most of all he was a very kind and compassionate person.\n\nOnce, Sarath Ambepitiya, asked him whether it was a sin to keep two women in one house as wives. \"Podi Hamuduruwo\" as we called him said, \"Oya lamaya karala ballanna, puluwanda kiyala\", and, with that he left the class.\n\nLater we mentioned this to our VP, Mr Bogoda Premaratna, who called the whole class in to his office and warned us severely for asking questions not pertaining to the class.\n\nWhen he taught us literature from the Ummagga Jathaka, many were the boys who asked him so many embarrassing questions related to the “Maapata Angilla” episode of Mahoshada Pandithuma in the text. He took it in great stride and laughed with us and enjoyed the joke too without getting red in the face. I remember him saying \"Oya lamayinta meka hara vena deyak hithanna baa, neda?\"\n\nHis wonderful smile, which always shone about his face, his saffron robes which swished in and out of class, his valiant character which we all respected so very much in the midst of our own youth, “peraliness”, and frivolity, is something, that, I am sure, we will always remember, honor and respect.\n\nMay he be blessed to attain Nirvana!\n\nROLL CALL\n\nNames in RED have moved on.
