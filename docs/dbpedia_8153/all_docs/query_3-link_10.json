Even now, a conspiracy has been hatched with the help of the mass media and some people in the education field; however, Hindus seem to be indifferent towards this event. It should be noted that Hindu culture and traditions are the most ancient and have survived the test of time. Hindus should now take a clear stand at the thought level and be firm about their Dharma”, said Ms Maria Wirth, a famous writer and a blogger from Germany while participating in the special discussion organised by Hindu Janajagruti Samiti (HJS) on the topic of ‘Dismantling Global Hindutva Conference – A false propaganda’.\n\nMr M Satchithanandan (Founder of ‘Shiva Senai’, Sri Lanka) said that Hindu Dharma has given many things to the world for the benefit of all beings. Eradicating Hindutva means destroying the moral, cultural, family, political, historical and geographical values. This is like the destruction of Holy Scriptures like ‘Geeta’ and ‘Chanakyaneeti’. True Hindus will never accept what the organisers of such anti-Hindu conferences will say. Moreover, the organisers will not accomplish their goal and collapse like Duryodhan and Ravana; Hindutva will move ahead smoothly on its path, this is our firm belief."
