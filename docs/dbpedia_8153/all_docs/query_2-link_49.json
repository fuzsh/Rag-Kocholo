        "text": "Since the end of the Sri Lankan ethnic conflict, Sri Lankan writers have sought to come to terms with the long-running war and its violent conclusion. This essay considers three recent novels by Sri Lankan diasporic women: Nayomi Munaweera’s Island of a Thousand Mirrors (2012), Chandani Lokuge’ s Softly , As I Leave You ( 2012) and Minoli Salgado’s A Little Dust on the Eyes (2014). Each of these novels focuses on the trauma of the war and the way that the war has affected and continues to affect those in the diaspora as well as in the homeland. Moreover, the novels provide a comparative view of the diaspora’s relation to the war, as Munaweera is resident in North America, Salgado in the United Kingdom, and Lokuge in Australia. In keeping with this issue’s theme – “from compressed worlds to open spaces” – my essay explores how South Asian women writers address the Sri Lankan war in the open spaces of the transnational Sri Lankan diaspora. As all three novels suggest, the end of the m...\n\nThe increasing visibility of armed women in violent conflicts in the modern world has unsettled conventional beliefs of inferiority, weakness, innocence, and the resultant fragility and victimhood of women. Although in theory it is possible to conceptualize armed woman and violence as empowerment, in practice, the temporal realities that inevitably haunt any discussion of ‘terrorism’ and ‘terrorists’ in conflict ridden polarized societies severely curtail the terminology available to frame militancy in general and the ‘terror’ it generates as ‘liberatory’. However, fictional and non-fictional literary work that were published in the aftermath of Sri Lanka’s war (1983-2009) between the state forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) seem to push the boundaries of the discourse on women, violence, and terror. This paper analyzes the representation of armed women in The Seasons of Trouble (Mohan, 2014), Island of a Thousand Mirrors (Munaweera, 2014), Tamil Tigress (De Soyza, 2013), and Under the Shadow of a Sharp Edged Sword (trans.) (Jeyakumaran, 2016) with the assumption that the genres of auto/biography and fiction offer an alternative archive within which seemingly polarized ‘truths’ entrenched in nationalist conflicts can be explored in their nuanced complexity. This paper assesses how literary portrayals of female militancy vis-à-vis violence, empowerment, and victimhood challenge conventional history and narratives and, in doing so, contribute to expand the boundaries of our understanding of female militancy in times of violent conflict. In conclusion, this paper suggests that the location of violence and female militancy within an ambivalent space of agency in narrative literature may also entail an unsettling of conventional figurations of war in gendered terms.\n\nThis article examines the lingering presence of the female militant figure in post-war Sri Lankan women’s writing in English. Through a careful demarcation of the formal–aesthetic limits of engaging with the country’s competing ethno-nationalisms, the article seeks to uncover the gendered hierarchies of Sri Lanka’s civil war in two literary works: Niromi de Soyza’s autobiography Tamil Tigress (2011) and Nayomi Munaweera’s debut novel Island of a Thousand Mirrors (2012). The reading draws attention to the writers’ attempt to “historise” the LTTE female fighter and/or suicide bomber within Sri Lanka’s complex colonial past and its implications for the recent history of conflict. The individual motives of the female fighters to join the LTTE, the article contends, remain ideologically susceptible to, if not interpellated by, the gendered hierarchies both within the military movement and Tamil society at large. A literary portrait of such entangled hierarchies in post-war Sri Lankan texts, the article reveals, helps expose the hegemonic (male) discourses of Sri Lankan nationalism that tend to undermine the war experiences of women.

This research is about the impact of war politics on women of Tamil community in the Ampara district of Sri Lanka during the period of armed conflict. The findings of this study reveal that the girls of the Tamil community were forcefully recruited to join the Tamil militant groups. Hence, parents found the only way to rescue their children and to assure their existence was to arrange teenage marriages. Most of those marriages were not legally registered. This paved the way for the male partners to abandon their spouses, often with children. The women whose children were forcefully recruited to militant forces and whose life was lost in the battle filed were given the dignity of ‘Veera Thai’ (Heroine Mother) with an allowance as gratitude for bearing such a war hero. However, it was revealed the title itself had resulted in many types of hard...\n\nThe intransigent nature of war in parts of Eastern Africa continues to be a grave concern to the world. Periods of violence within the region have invoked memories of conflict by both men and women. Drawing on feminist studies of women’s autobiographical writings, this paper examines the experience of women during conflict. The memoirs highlight the special concerns of women, such as: malnutrition; shelter; reproductive health including childbirth and family planning; rape and sexual abuse; relocation stress; role strains and role change; family separation and perceived helplessness. Of specific interest is the manner in which female memoirs of conflict contest stereotypical images of women as passive victims of war. I argue that stereotypic images of women as apathetic victims of conflict overshadow their agency and contribution to peace building. The memoirs examined from Uganda, Sudan and Somali disprove the portrayal and treatment of women solely as victims. The writers under st...\n\nLess than four years have passed since the end of the Sri Lankan ‘ethnic conflict’. Despite the efforts of third parties to shove a diplomatic end to the conflict, the ground on which today Sri Lanka struggles to maintain a fragile peace is a context of brutal military victory and the widespread extermination of the LTTE leadership. Since the end of the war, different ways to deal with the past have been discussed. ‘Reconciliation’ has become the buzzword that dominates the public debates. The three decades of war and the aftermath have had a tremendous impact on women, in the modification of gender roles in Sri Lanka; a continued back and forward in terms of emancipation. In spite of their historical effort to equally contribute to the decision-making process, women continue to be left out. The post-conflict environment has exacerbated the conditions particularly for those women who have been affected by war. This circumstance has directed me towards the formulation of the following research question: What are Sri Lankan war affected women’s perceptions on post-conflict reconciliation and how do they portray themselves throughout this process? This thesis is focused – but not limited to –answering this question. In order to do so, this text has been structured in three main chapters which entail: a theoretical anthropological discussion on reconciliation; a description of the post-conflict situation in Sri Lanka and the roles developed by women throughout the conflict; and a final analysis for which field research in Sri Lanka has been conducted."
