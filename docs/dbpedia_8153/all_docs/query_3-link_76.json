        "text": "Malaysia opposition leader investigated under fake news laws\n\nMahathir Mohamad claimed that people working for the government were responsible for the ‘sabotage’ of his plane in order to stop him registering as an election candidate. Photograph: STAFF/Reuters\n\nHannah Ellis-Petersen –\n\nMahathir Mohamad is being investigated under law recently rushed through ahead of general election\n\nMahathir Mohamad claimed that people working for the government were responsible for the ‘sabotage’ of his plane in order to stop him registering as an election candidate. Photograph: STAFF/Reuters\n\nThe opposition leader in the upcoming Malaysian elections is being investigated under the country’s new fake news laws, police have confirmed.\n\nMahathir Mohamad, who was prime minister of Malaysia for two decades and is running again aged 92, claimed last weekend that people working for the government were responsible for the “sabotage” of his plane, in order to stop him registering as an election candidate.\n\nOn Wednesday Malaysian police said Mahathir was being investigated under the fake news legislation, which was recently rushed through parliament by the prime minister, Najib Razak, amid fears from human rights groups it could be used by the government against its opponents.\n\nThe complaint against Mahathir was filed by members of ruling party UMNO – which Mahathir used to lead – claiming that his allegations of sabotage fuelled an incorrect and damaging perception of the ruling coalition government, and therefore should be investigated under the Anti-fake News Act 2018.\n\n“For the case on the fake news, it involves a claim by Mahathir that the jet which he had chartered to fly to Langkawi was sabotaged last Friday,” said the Kuala Lumpur police chief, Mazlan Lazim.\n\nIn a lengthy open letter published last Saturday, Mahathir detailed how a chartered plane due to take him to the island of Langkawi – where he is running as a parliamentary candidate for the elections on 9 May – suffered suspicious damage to the tyre so was unable to fly.\n\nHe said that others who he had reached out to had indicated they were “under pressure” not to lend him their aircraft as a back-up.\n\nWhile Mahathir did make it to Langkawi in time to register, he said the series of events had led him to conclude that “it is logical to believe that there is a deliberate attempt to stop me from going to Langkawi … I maintain my belief that the plane was deliberately tampered with.”\n\nThe allegations were subsequently dismissed by the Civil Aviation Authority of Malaysia and the aircraft company, Vista Jet, who both said that no such foul play had taken place and it was simply a routine technical fault.\n\nThe decision to investigate Mahathir will further fuel concern that the law was designed to silence Najib’s critics in the run-up to the election.\n\nUnder the law, the government decides what constitutes fake news. The law carries a jail sentence of up to six years and a fine of 500,000 ringgit (£93,000) for anyone who “maliciously” creates and distributes false information.\n\nMahathir has said only that he is not worried about the fake news investigation.\n\nIt also extends to those who are not Malaysian citizens. The first person charged under the new law this week was Danish citizen Salah Salem Saleh Sulaiman, who claimed in an online video that the police had taken 50 minutes to respond to the distress call of a Palestinian lecturer who was gunned down in Kuala Lumpur last week. Police said they had actually taken eight minutes to respond.\n\nThe judge fined Sulaiman 10,000 ringgit (£1,866) but he opted to spend a month in jail because he could not pay.\n\nBurma Muslims jailed for praying in the street\n\nSEVEN Muslim men have reportedly been jailed in Burma (Myanmar) for three months for organising Muslim prayers in the street about a year ago, after local Islamic schools were shuttered prior to the holy month of Ramadan.\n\nAccording to the UK-based Burma Human Rights Network (BHRN) the men were sentenced on Monday under Burma’s War and Village Tract Administration Law which prohibits public gatherings, for organising a public prayer on the street in Tharketa Township in the country’s largest city of Yangon back in April 2017.\n\n“This case and the events which led to it all demonstrate a societal and systemic bias against Muslims and minorities inside of Burma, said the organisation’s Executive Director, Kyaw Win in a statement.\n\n“These men were denied a place to worship by the authorities intentionally trying to prohibit their religious freedoms.”\n\nIn April last year, mobs of far-right Buddhist nationalists swarmed two madrassas (Islamic boarding schools) in Tharketa, demanding that the local authorities shut them, which they subsequently did. With Ramadan beginning a month later, the local Muslim community continued to hold their prayers on the street – often in the pouring rain.\n\nAuthorities halted public prayers involving around 50 Muslims in late May as “threat to stability and rule of law”, with the seven men in question later charged.\n\n“When some men took it upon themselves to continue practicing their religion outside in the rain because they were not permitted a place to worship, they were punished for this as well,” said Kyaw Win on Tuesday.\n\nPhil Robertson, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch (HRW) said last year that “Burmese local officials’ craven capitulation to mob demands to shutter two Muslim schools is the latest government failure to protect Burma’s religious minorities.”\n\nAround 90 percent of Burma’s population is Buddhist, while Muslims represent an estimated 4 percent.\n\nThe country’s transition to democracy from military dictatorship has seen ongoing legal discrimination against minorities, as well as the emergence of vocal Buddhist ultranationalist groups who call for violence against the Muslim population in Burma – particularly the Rohingya.\n\nHumanitarian agencies have said more than 671,000 Rohingya Muslim refugees have fled the country’s northern Rakhine State into Bangladesh in since Aug 25 last year in response to so-called “clearing operations” by the Tatmadaw army – violence described by the United Nations as a “textbook example” of ethnic cleansing.\n\nLast September, BHRN released a report in which it documented rising persecution of Muslims elsewhere in Burma including authorities making it difficult for Muslims to obtain identity cards and rebuild damaged mosques. Moreover, it noted the spread of so-called “Muslim-free” villages across Burma.\n\nSEE ALSO: Burma’s ‘forgotten’ war\n\nThe United States’ Commission on International Religious Freedom reported in 2017 that the National League for Democracy (NLD) government of Aung San Suu Kyi had allowed “systematic, egregious, and ongoing violations of freedom of religion or belief to continue.”\n\n“It has been a long time since we have been able to build new mosques in this country,” said Kyaw Khin, head of a national Muslim group told HRW last year. “Others are destroyed in violence, and some are closed by the government.”\n\nThe international community should view the imprisonment of the seven men as an “early warning” of worsening oppression against Muslims and other minorities in Burma, BHRN said.\n\n“It is hard to imagine any intention the authorities might have other than to make religious freedom nearly impossible for Muslims,” Kyaw Win added."
