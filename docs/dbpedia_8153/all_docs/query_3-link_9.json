Field research began immediately after a 2002 ceasefire temporarily ended almost two decades of civil conflict between the Sri Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). In the event, the agreement was shortlived and only temporarily stayed a return to extreme violence. A few months after a devastating tsunami struck the island in December 2004, the country started its inexorable return to dirty war. The ceasefire was pronounced dead in 2008 and the appalling costs of war began to be felt from Jaffna, Trincomalee and Batticaloa to Colombo. Meanwhile, international attention and engagement in Sri Lanka began to stall. Wars and natural disasters in Afghanistan (2002) and Iraq (2003), Sudan (2003), Haiti (2004), Bangladesh (2007) and Burma (2008) superseded Sri Lanka in geopolitical importance. There are literally hundreds of experts and lay people who patiently guided me in my attempts to better understand the highly politicised landscapes of Sri Lanka. They helped me navigate a vast array of historical, economic and political fault-lines and the fiendishly complex names of places and people I visited between 2001 and 2008. Spanning several continents, I could fill volumes in naming them individually. It will be to the reader’s relief, then, that I confine my thanks to a small selection. At the outset, I extend deepest gratitude to my family – all of them. Each member played an instrumental role in keeping my spirits high during the inevitable lows of preparing this volume. Likewise, colleagues at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva and my own organisation, the Small Arms Survey, also gave generously of their time and allowed me a measure of flexibility to research an issue about which I am deeply passionate. The government of Switzerland, particularly the Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC), and the US-based Social Science Research Council (SSRC) must be specially credited for providing generous support to see this research process through. New and old friends in Sri Lanka, Switzerland, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States offered relentless encouragement. In particular, colleagues affiliated with the Colombo-based International Centre for Ethnic Studies (ICES), the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank provided\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nconstructive insight and practical logistical support – particularly Sunil Bastian, Radhika Coomeraswamy, Ponnudarai Thambirajah, Bradman Weerakoon, Neill Wright, Phil Esmond and my dear colleague Michael Cernea. A host of internationally recognised scholars and academics working with the University of Colombo, the University of Peradeniya, the University of the East and various research centres from Jaffna and Trincomalee to Kandy and Colombo gave liberally of their time, listened to long-winded lectures and commented on early drafts. I am grateful to colleagues at Oxford University who supplied steady counsel during periods of high anxiety, particularly Professors Stephen Castles and Dawn Chatty. Others helping to steer the volume to the finish-line version include Richard Black, Gil Loescher, Ed Benson, Clifford Spence, David Gelnder, Nick Van Hear, Norman Uphoff and Eric Mooney. Colleagues commenting directly on specific chapters include Bob Picciotto, Simon Bagshaw, Peter Batchelor, Jesse Bernstein, Francis Deng, Conrad Detissera, David Evans, Rajat Ganguly, Timmo Gaasbeek, Ayman Gharaibeh, Katarzyna Grabska, Cristina Hoyos, Tania Inowlocki, Keith Krause, Jay Maheswaran, Lyla Mehta, Aninia Nadig, Sarah Nouwen, Aruvasi Patel, Bryan Pfaffenberger, Bob Rae, Charan Rainford, Ambika Satkunanathan, Tad Scudder, Jagath Seneratne, Timothy Shaw, Rajesh Venugopal and Tod Wassel. Also thanks to an anonymous reader, who supplied thoughtful and pointed comments on an earlier draft, and to my father, who issued blunt, but excellent, editorial comments. There are many others to whom I am thankful after more than half a decade of research in Colombo, Mullaitivu, Trincomalee, Batticaloa and Ampara, as well as visits to Washington DC, New York, Delhi, ­Manila, ­Geneva and elsewhere. These include translators, enumerators and map­ping specialists – particularly Chandreenie Kariyawasan, Upekha Chanduka, Amir Kamirthalingam, Prasadi Indrawimala, Regunanthan Umapathy, Jillie Luff and Mil Illangasinghe – without whom I literally would have been lost. Appreciation must also be extended to my surrogate family in Colombo – the Jayatilikas, Samanayakes and their relatives – who taught me much about the history of the island and the hospitality of its people. Finally, I am indebted to the many people who told me their stories, openly and in confidence – particularly resettled communities, government officials and aid workers in northern and eastern Sri Lanka. Indeed, the tragedy of Sri Lanka is that many of them cannot be thanked publicly and must remain anonymous, a reality that one hopes will change soon. This volume is a tribute to these nameless men, women and children – many of whom are living and bringing up families in the face of horrendous suffering. viii\n\nAcronyms\n\nADB AfDB ARN AU AusAid

the world each year to make way for dam and urban renewal projects and in the wake of wars, cyclones and floods. Meanwhile, a global coalition of activists and policymakers are advocating for, and implementing, policies and programmes to safely return or resettle them. Owing to the multiple causes and consequences of population dislocation, the range of governmental and non-state entities involved in resettling them and the variety of conceptual and disciplinary approaches to framing these issues, resettlement is typically described as a totalising phenomenon and an extreme form of spatial socialisation. This book is principally concerned with understanding why the resettle­ ment of internally displaced people so often fails. It necessarily begins with an exploration of how states, multilateral agencies, non-­governmental organisations and scholars conceptualise issues such as internal displacement and resettlement. Then it seeks to explain their rationale and motivation in providing protection and durable solutions for different categories of populations internally displaced in the context of development, war and natural disasters. In focusing on Sri Lanka’s many decades of experience with displacement and population resettlement, the volume appraises why and how such interventions were pursued and proposes an explanation for relocation failure. The book applies a unitary approach to understanding and researching the phenomenology of internal displacement and resettlement. Such a perspective is by definition comparative and examines otherwise exclusive categories of internal displacement and resettlement arising from development, armed conflict and natural dis­ asters. A unitary approach is inherently multi-disciplinary and consciously borrows from a range of social ­science disciplines and methodologies. The volume therefore seeks, where possible, to ­balance theoretical and empirical findings generated by anthropologists, ethno­graphers, socio­ logists and human geographers with insights from inter­national relations and political science theory, law and political economy. Volume structure\n\nChapter 1 critically assesses the theory and labels used to explain internal displacement and resettlement processes. It challenges the impulse among policymakers and planners to standardise and categorise\n\nIntroduction\n\nforced migrants. An analysis of how labels are constructed and deployed reveals the ‘political in the seemingly apolitical arena of bureaucratic practices’ (Zetter 2007: 184). It is also essential in order to lay out the discursive foundations of subsequent chapters. Crucially, the chapter unpacks assumptions nurtured by forced migration specialists that displacement consists of involuntary, temporally and geographically specific processes. It then introduces a definition of resettlement as a planned and involuntary process entailing the permanent relocation of an individual, family or household from one’s place of origin to another place. It is important to distinguish this definition from ‘third-country’ resettlement as described in the 1951 Refugee Convention and 1967 Protocol, which entails planned and voluntary movement across an international border. In mobilising the work of Zetter (1991, 2007), Oliver-Smith (2004), Castles (2002, 2003), Hyndman (2000) and Malkki (1995) in particular, the chapter considers the attendant difficulties of labelling populations on the move and the ways in which compartmentalised forms of knowledge production inform international norm-setting and policymaking. The chapter then traces out the conceptual evolution of three separate categories of internal displacement and resettlement since the middle of the twentieth century. These categories were conspicuously structured according to the attributed causes of displacement – whether development, conflict or natural disasters. Chapter 2 compares and contrasts state and non-state understandings of – and bureaucratic responses to – internal displacement and resettlement through the prism of international regimes. Drawing from rationalist and constructivist traditions, the chapter describes how an array of governmental and non-governmental actors with different ideational problem-sets fostered and created loose institutional arrangements to enhance predictability, reduce transaction costs and promote cooperation in situations where they might otherwise compete. It reviews the origin and shape of these international regimes and how they are (expected to be) actualised at the national and sub-national level.1 The chapter shows how these regimes were themselves fostered by an international network of academics, practitioners, organisations and state representatives. Taken together, they include (transnational) advocacy coalitions and public policy networks – veritable ‘capillaries of power’ – bent on forging consensus and support for three separate regimes composed of over­lapping principles, norms, rules and decision-making procedures. Oriented towards different categories of internal displacement and re­ settle­ment, these three regimes appear to be as distinct from the so-called refugee regime as they are from each other. 2\n\n3\n\nIntroduction\n\nRegimes for different categories of internal displacement and resettle­ ment are more declarative than performative. While introduced from above, they are nevertheless expected to influence state and non-state understandings of particular issues, their behaviour and ultimately outcomes from below. In different ways, the three regimes are expected to contain, protect and promote durable solutions for those internally displaced and resettled by development, conflict and natural disasters. While the practical expression of protection and durable solutions differs subtly between regimes, they embody progressive universal­ising stan­ dards as reflected in international law and good practice. It is seen that the evolution of these regimes into more robust (enforceable) ­arrangements is hampered by endogenous constraints, including narrow interpretations of state sovereignty (as non-interference) and challenges with over­coming collective action dilemmas among regime proponents. The chapter considers how these regimes are also inadvertently blind to a range of historical and political processes associated with state-building and ethnic nationalism in ways that can make their prescriptions potentially counter-productive. Chapter 3 reviews the chronology of settlement and resettlement patterns in Sri Lanka from the late nineteenth to the early twenty-first century. It also traces out a number of exogenous factors influencing the three regimes. The chapter documents the evolution of so-called colonisation (settlement) schemes from the late 1800s to independence in 1948. It finds that while state-sponsored settlement and resettlement initiatives continued into the post-colonial era, they were harnessed by an emer­ ging indigenous elite to a new political purpose. Rather than be driven by the imperatives of colonial plantation economics, settlement and resettlement were soon inextricably hitched to modernist nation-building paradigms, ethnic nationalism and the state’s assertion of control over land. Population relocation served to consolidate state (Sinhalese) hege­ mony over non-state-controlled areas and, combined with discriminatory religious and language legislation, triggered a (Tamil) secessionist project. The parallel introduction of universalising international regimes designed to permanently resettle internally displaced populations potentially ­entrenched ethnic and spatial segregation between the south on the one side and the north and east on the other. Chapter 4 focuses on the relationships between the international regime for development-induced internal displacement and resettlement (DIDR) and a controversial multi-purpose dam, irrigation and ‘settlement’ initiative. One of the largest rural integrated development schemes in the world at the time, the Mahaweli Development and ­Irrigation ­Programme\n\nIntroduction\n\n(MDIP) was formally launched in the late 1960s and subsequently ­accelerated in the late 1970s by a newly elected government. Drawing primarily from archival records and short site visits, the chapter considers the outcomes of two specific ‘Systems’ of the MDIP straddling ethnically heterogeneous areas of several northern and eastern districts during the 1980s and 1990s. It highlights how the establishment of these Systems contributed to the (planned and unplanned) internal displacement of tens of thousands of Sri Lankan Tamil ‘encroachers’ and the settlement and resettlement of many more Sinhalese ‘peasants’. The resulting purposebuilt ‘colony units’ formed a new spatial boundary that segmented and enclaved ­minority communities and led to heightened militarisation in the north-east. Proponents of the nascent DIDR regime unintentionally sanctioned and entrenched state-led demographic and politico-administrative transformation while simultaneously contributing to the real and relative impoverishment of successive generations of resettling households. Chapter 5 considers the international regime for conflict-induced internal displacement and resettlement (CIDR) within the context of protracted armed conflict waged primarily in northern and eastern Sri Lanka. Since the early 1980s, the country’s civil war pitted the armed forces and their auxiliaries against an array of militarised groups, including the LTTE, the self-declared representatives of the Sri Lankan Tamil community. The UNHCR, a key proponent of the CIDR regime that also includes bilateral and multilateral donors and non-governmental agencies, was invited to the island by the Sri Lankan government in 1987. The agency initially oriented its activities towards repatriating Sri Lankan refugees from India and promoting protection in-country to contain ‘would-be’ refugees. By the early 1990s, however, UNHCR promoted durable solutions for IDPs. Based on field research conducted in the north and east of the country, the chapter considers the evolution of conceptual and bureaucratic responses to CIDR since independence. With support from regime proponents, such as UNHCR and the World Bank, the state established and managed so-called ‘welfare centres’ and ‘relocation villages’, composed primarily of resettled Sri Lankan Tamil and Muslim populations internally displaced from areas of conflict. In order to highlight the outcomes of state-sanctioned resettlement, the chapter focuses on the experiences and livelihoods of several relocation villages in Trincomalee and Batticaloa involving both Sinhalese and Sri Lankan Tamil resettlers. It finds that regime proponents, while seeking to promote protection and durable solutions, unintentionally reinforced the demographic and politico-military imperatives of the state and the LTTE. 4\n\n5\n\nIntroduction\n\nChapter 6 reviews the sudden emergence and influence of a regime for natural disaster-induced internal displacement and resettlement (NIDR) in the context of the tsunami. It examines the manner in which vulnerable coastal populations composed primarily of Sri Lankan Tamils and Muslims in the north and east (as well as Sinhalese in the south) were affected by a massive wave that struck the island in late 2004. The chapter considers the role of the nascent NIDR regime in encouraging durable solutions: these consisted primarily of ‘transitional’ and ‘permanent’ housing schemes for internally displaced populations. As predicted in Chapter 2, regime proponents encountered considerable exogenous challenges owing to the state’s (temporary) application of restrictive ‘buffers’ to coastal areas and the limited access to appropriate land, as well as a host of strategic barriers introduced by the government, the armed forces and the LTTE. It is too early to discern the influence of the NIDR regime in relation to protection and durable solutions. Nevertheless, Chapter 6 considers preliminary findings generated by site visits with tsunami-affected households living in permanent houses in northern and eastern districts such as Trincomalee, Batticaloa and Ampara. ‘Conclusions’ distils the basic commonalities and distinguishing characteristics of all three categories of internal displacement and resettle­ ment. It compares the inter-related determinants, shared bureaucratic logic and common impoverishment effects of DIDR, CIDR and NIDR in Sri Lanka, and elsewhere. The chapter also examines the prospects for enhanced cross-fertilisation between epistemic communities and the potential for regime convergence in the twenty-first century. It detects an increasingly prolific rights-based discourse that emphasises complementarity and equality in the promotion of protection and durable solutions. The chapter also traces out a shift in discourse of state sovereignty away from a traditional focus on non-interference to one that emphasises responsibility with attendant obligations to protect civilians from extreme violence.2 In spite of contemporary geopolitical developments – in Iraq, Afghanistan and Sudan, the preference for unilateral over multilateral humanitarian intervention and the reordering of global order in light of the rise of China and India, the principle of state sovereignty as responsibility is increasingly accepted by international institutions such as the United Nations Security Council (Deng 2007; Evans 2007). In Sri Lanka, however, the ‘responsibility to protect’ concept remains contentious and a source of considerable tension and acrimony. Perhaps more optimistically, the conclusion observes a gradual tendency towards increasing centralisation of accountability for internally displaced people within specific\n\nIntroduction\n\ninstitutions and organisations – including multilateral and bilateral aid agencies and the Sri Lankan state – a trend that hints at the potential of overcoming collective action dilemmas in the long term. Whether these transformations ultimately yield improved protection and durable solutions in Sri Lanka or elsewhere remains to be seen. Methodological considerations\n\nThe phenomena of internal displacement and resettlement defy the application of a single disciplinary lens. Nevertheless, ethnographic, an­thropo­logical, sociological and psycho-social approaches tend to dominate forced migration studies. Consequently, scholarship highlights the ‘lived experiences’ of internally displaced and resettled populations, including their patterns of vulnerability, coping strategies and social interactions with host communities. There is comparatively less exploration of the normative or policy environment in which such processes are conceived and framed, much less the ways in which specific policies and practices yield positive (or negative) outcomes (Weiss and Korn 2006). In consciously adopting an inter-disciplinary approach that includes international relations theory, political geography, history and development studies, this volume considers the wider cluster of norms, institutions and agents shaping the process and outcomes of internal displacement and resettlement. Such an approach is typically described as ‘grounded’. It is grounded because it builds theory directly from the field and assumes that the processes of data collection, analysis and theory building proceed ­simultaneously rather than sequentially. Field research is thus undertaken to accumulate broadly comparable data from which a range of specific ­categories and their associated properties can subsequently be isolated and the relationships between them identified (Glaser 1992). By definition, a grounded methodology also requires the researcher to apply a combination of qualitative and quantitative instruments and to triangulate findings appropriately (Mason 2004; Read and Marsh 2002; Strauss 1987). These methods can range from key informant interviews and participant observation to participatory focus groups and analysis of sizeable demographic datasets. A grounded approach typically ­tailors research design, selection of field sites, sampling techniques, local ­recruitment strategies and specialised research tools to the particularities of the local context (Hyndman and de Alwis 2000; Savolainen 1994; Welch 1975). As noted above, a primary objective of the volume is to generate a comparative assessment of international regimes designed to protect 6\n\n7\n\nIntroduction\n\nand promote durable solutions for internally displaced people, including their influence on shaping resettlement outcomes in a single country. Sri Lanka offers a compelling, albeit complex and unstable, environment in which to test these propositions. On the ‘positive’ side of the ledger, Sri Lanka experienced all three forms of internal displacement and resettle­ ment – often concurrently – before and after the negotiated ceasefire agreement (CFA) between the government and the LTTE in 2002. It is not unique in this respect: countries such as Sudan, Uganda, Ethiopia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Colombia, Nepal, the Philippines, Solomon Islands and Indonesia also experienced mass population relocation as a result of development, conflict and natural disasters.3 The CFA also generated a measure of (temporal and physical) space to conduct field-work – an environment unlike any other witnessed in the previous two decades. Indeed the substance and methods of the research were initially welcomed and encouraged by international and national authorities and representatives of the LTTE. But with the resumption and intensification of conflict, the mood soured. A major constraint to analysing forced migration in Sri Lanka relates to both the politicisation, and the poor state, of descriptive statistics in the country. Discussed at length in Chapters 3, 4, 5 and 6, data are highly biased, poorly collated and thus only tentative estimates of longitudinal and spatial trends can be rendered. Though the country boasts a credible national surveillance infrastructure in relation to monitoring population health and socio-economic well-being, statistics on sensitive topics such as displacement and resettlement are frequently restricted, selective and of dubious quality. For example, the Mahaweli Authority reportedly ‘lost’ all socio-economic data for more than 250,000 settler and resettler families affected by DIDR between 1970 and 2000. Although UNHCR’s Sri Lankan Colombo office maintained disaggregated demographic data on certain temporal and geographic aspects of CIDR, they were isolated to specific years and districts and seldom demographically disaggregated until after the 2002 ceasefire.4 Similarly, the Reconstruction and Development Agency (RADA), UN-HABITAT and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) collated statistics on NIDR – including transitional shelters and permanent housing – but data were often out of date, sporadic and widely dispersed. As a result, an imperfect profile was reconstructed by the author from the backrooms of district government agent offices, land kacheri buildings and NGO warehouses in Sri Lanka and triangulated with ‘official’ data presented by government and various UN agencies. Although official public and non-governmental statistics are often\n\nIntroduction\n\nmanipulated for political economy reasons, it is possible to render an order of magnitude estimate of the scale and ethnic distribution of internal displacement. For example, more than one million Sinhalese were (involuntarily) resettled as a result of the MDIP since the late 1970s. At least another million more Sri Lankan Tamils and Muslims were (forcibly) displaced, returned or resettled during various periods of the armed conflict since the early 1980s, with rates increasing again since 2005. Almost half a million Sri Lankan Tamils, Muslims and Sinhalese were internally displaced following the tsunami in late 2004. The administration of field research while different forms of internal displacement and resettlement were occurring concurrently generated both opportunities and dilemmas. While it allowed for access to actually occurring phenomena and personal exposure to the actors and agents at the coal face, it also impinged on the author’s potential for dispassionate analysis and the accumulated wisdom born of hindsight. In many cases, the only way to ‘do’ research in otherwise inaccessible areas was to participate in the relief effort itself.5 One of the goals of this volume is to test the association between nascent international regimes for development-, conflict- and natural disaster-induced internal displacement and resettlement (independent variables) on state behaviour and ultimately resettlement outcomes (dependent variables). This entailed extensive investigation of the real and perceived policies and practices of state and non-state institutions and of the experiences of relocated populations before and after the ‘resettlement’ intervention. Of course, public and non-governmental authorities and resettled populations do not necessarily describe their situation in relation to neatly defined categories or external interventions. To the contrary, the experience of displacement and relocation is described by respondents as a messy sequence of events explicitly informed by their lived experiences. A major challenge then, relates to the reliable and representative framing of the policies and practices characterised by the aforementioned regimes. In order to do this, ideas and concepts were repeatedly tested with key informants. Likewise, early drafts of certain chapters were sent to senior analysts affiliated with multilateral institutions such as the World Bank, UNHCR and IFRC and Sri Lankan government and non-governmental entities in order to test candidate theories. The ability to test the relationships between international regimes and local outcomes such as protection and durable solutions requires a clear definition of ‘regimes’. As Chapter 2 makes clear, regime theorists have long struggled with ‘measurability’ partly due to the lack of consensus 8\n\n9\n\nIntroduction\n\nover what exactly constitutes a regime. Most approaches therefore opt for an interpretive methodology. In such cases, scholars examine the communicative processes (verbal and written statements) of government leaders, public servants and non-governmental actors in order to discern evidence of emerging principles, norms, rules and decision-making procedures (Finnemore 2003; Klotz 1995; Kratochwil and Ruggie 1986). The conceptual parameters of separate regimes emerge from interviews with (and a review of the statements made by) key representatives of international institutions such as bilateral donors, multilateral, financial and bilateral agencies, senior government decision-makers and policy researchers from London, Geneva, New York and Washington DC to Delhi, Manila, Colombo and Trincomalee. This volume constitutes the first systematic attempt to compare and contrast different cases of internal displacement and resettlement, though previous studies have examined refugees and development ‘­oustees’ (Cernea and McDowell 2000). It also offers an original effort to test the influence and outcomes of three regimes in a single country, something that has not been attempted in Sri Lanka or elsewhere to the best of the author’s knowledge. In order to control for variations across time and space and to compare categories of forced migration, individual resettlement schemes were selected from broadly comparable geographic and ethnic districts in the country.6 A case study approach does not stand alone and should be con­ sidered within a family of comparable case studies. The intrinsic value of comparative research on forced migration is acknowledged by Turton (2003) and Richmond (1994) who, on the basis of multiple case ­studies, developed typologies of different categories of migrants, forced or other­ wise. Moreover, the selection of a single country with multiple cases concurs with Eckstein’s (1975: 175) claim that a single crucial case to test candidate theories can score a knock-out blow over more theor­ etical deductive approaches. Thus, the case study approach advanced in Chapters 4, 5 and 6 is therefore widely accepted in the social sciences (King and Murray 2002). In presenting evidence on the themes laid out above, the three case study chapters are not symmetrical. Certain cases highlight particular themes more than others. The individual cases and their narratives are introduced more as a way of developing the central arguments than as equal blocks of evidence. A host of methods were employed to analyse the influence of inter­ national regimes on state behaviour, the constitutive features of bureaucratic institutions and the spatial distribution of resettlement schemes. These included an archival review of parliamentary records (Hansard),\n\nIntroduction\n\ngovernment bills and land legislation7 since the nineteenth century. As noted above, primary data were also collected from semi-structured interviews with a wide array of respondents. In all, more than 125 key informant interviews were administered in the capital Colombo and in district and divisional capitals and rural areas with active and retired government agents, district secretaries, municipal public servants, development practitioners and researchers.8 Other approaches included the geo-referencing of past and current resettlement schemes using geographic information system (GIS) software with data drawn from a combination of ministries, authorities and UN agencies. In order to examine the extent to which international regimes contributed to de facto protection and durable solutions, participatory focus groups were held with purposefully selected samples of resettled populations in six ‘resettlement schemes’. The process entailed the gathering together of a representative sample of between ten and twenty resettled men, women and youth through locally recruited Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim intermediaries for short sessions with repeat visits over several intervals. Special dispensations were made to ensure that sessions were undertaken in deference to the requirements of labourers and household routines. Given the sensitivities of the topic, consent was agreed beforehand and the names of participants were stripped from all physical outputs to avoid them from being misused.9 As noted by Hyndman and de Alwis (2000): PRA [participatory rural appraisal] … involves the collection of household data … and includes family names and a ‘social map’ of who lives where, with whom and owns what. Such information in the hands of the LTTE for the purposes of monitoring the current military training and recruitment campaign could be disastrous. In the hands of the armed forces it could also be dangerous.\n\nParticipatory methods were introduced in order to assess whether displaced and resettled populations themselves determined that they had realised a durable solution. Building on research undertaken by the author in other conflict zones, they provided an inclusive platform for a selection of resettlers to express their view ‘from below’.10 Ultimately, the effectiveness of the regimes in relation to protection and durable solutions must be assessed according to objective and subjective criteria.11 As noted above, specific districts were purposefully selected not just because they experienced disproportionately high rates of forced migration, but because they exhibited comparatively higher levels of ethnic diversity than more ethnically homogeneous southern and northern districts. 10\n\nThe decision to focus on common districts for all categories of internal displacement and resettlement was taken to minimise the risk of omitted variable biases – the (causal) influence of non-accounted-for independent variables influencing resettlement outcomes. Ethics in forced migration research\n\n11\n\nIntroduction\n\nAn underlying motivation for undertaking comparative research on internal displacement and resettlement is the potential to learn across competing epistemic communities and to deepen and strengthen awareness, understanding and international and domestic policy responses across sectors. This is consistent with the aspirations of forced migration to enact positive change. Research on forced migrants was described by Davis (1992) as the ‘anthropology of suffering’, focusing as it does on violence, dislocation and its effects. Oliver-Smith (2004), Colson (2003) and Turton (1996) observe that research on refugees and other forced migrants is only justified when it contributes meaningfully to alleviating such suffering. Hathaway (2006: 2) observes that ‘whatever else forced migration scholars are, we have always been linked by our determination to be a community of engaged scholars, that is, persons who do what we do with a view to improving the lot of those whose lives we study’. Practical research on displacement and resettlement invariably generates a number of ethical tensions. A threefold imperative confronts forced migration researchers and scholars. Jacobsen and Landau (2003) emphasise the first as the retention of high academic standards and the second as the commitment to creating and disseminating knowledge that actively contributes to enhanced protection, influences state and non-governmental agency behaviour and reduces human misery. They argue that researchers must avoid the temptation to undertake ‘advocacy research’ and to overstate claims if they are going to contribute meaningfully to policy and programming and generate credible impetus for (positive) change. A third imperative is – as the Hippocratic oath recommends – doing no intentional harm. There is a very real risk that research aggravates tensions and insecurity: displacement and resettlement processes, particularly in contexts of acute violence, are inherently volatile. A number of these ethical dilemmas can be offset with careful preparation. For example, confidentiality lapses can be mitigated by acquiring informed consent and guaranteeing anonymity for respondents. The majority of key informants consulted during the preparation of this study requested that their names not be cited in the final document.12 The ‘protection’ of informants and focus group respondents can potentially\n\nIntroduction\n\nbe enhanced by (physical) presence, though this does not necessarily ensure that harm is avoided over the longer term (Smythe and Robinson 2001; Anderson 1999; Mooney 1995). Reactivity – wherein the presence of an outsider influences the behaviour of respondents – can be offset through the transparent communication of the aims and expectations of the research, triangulation, continuous dialogue with respondents and, where appropriate, the passing on of expressed grievances to res­ ponsible authorities (Betts 2005; Goodhand 2000). Where administered appropriately, participatory research allows for immediate triangulation and analysis with participants themselves and thus minimises potential reactivity (Skinner 2005).13 The deteriorating security environment profoundly shaped the possibilities for meaningful field research in northern and eastern Sri Lanka (Muggah 2008b). In some instances, resettlement schemes established in the 1980s and 1990s were literally swept away by disasters and war a decade later. Owing to the increased deployment of armed forces personnel and the LTTE in the north and east, the ratcheting up of counter-insurgency efforts by the government, the (unsolved) massacres of aid agency staff14 and progressively hostile attitudes towards foreigners, access to certain areas of the country were progressively more uncertain. Sustained visits to certain resettlement schemes required official clearance. By 2006 the issues of internal displacement and resettlement in north and eastern Sri Lanka were considered so politically charged that certain interviews were postponed or denied outright. Even secondary data on displacement and resettlement previously made public by government authorities and non-governmental agencies were later withdrawn or altered post hoc. Throughout the preparation of this volume, the exposure of the author to real risks obviously paled in comparison to the routine dangers facing civilians. Nevertheless, research on social suffering at times requires assuming informed risks and making sacrifices. Persistence is warranted on the grounds that the suffering arising from internal displacement and resettlement can be carefully documented and eventually reversed.\n\n12\n\n1 | A unified approach to displacement and resettlement\n\nThe forced migration studies literature is rife with conceptual tension. It is precisely because of the field’s many disciplinary and ideological faultlines that foundational concepts and terminology must be revisited. While specialists acknowledge the centrality of power asymmetries and co­ ercion, there are still fundamental disagreements over basic par­ameters: whether displacement and resettlement is voluntary or involuntary, when these processes begin and end and whether they are restricted to physical movement or include other non-spatial forms of dislocation. While this debate potentially signals a healthy intellectual state of ­affairs, lingering disputes over rudimentary concepts are a major obstacle to building theory, refining and habituating norms, and ultimately re­fining practice (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998). Consensus continues to be hindered by narrow agendas demanding standardisation together with epistemic fault-lines dividing the many disciplines that comprise the forced migration field. This chapter considers the ways distinct policymakers and re­searchers coalesced around separate categories of internal displacement and resettle­ment. It finds that the specialisation of knowledge and ex­pertise in each domain reinforced unnecessary barriers between groups of s­ cholars and practitioners. It traces the evolution of academic-practitioner networks engaged on various categories and how they constituted more or less unitary epistemic communities sharing knowledge about cause– effect relationships in specific policy arenas and adopting shared sets of normative and principled beliefs (Haas 1992: 3). These communities include adversarial advocacy coalitions and more collaborative publicpolicy networks that transmit and promote normative and ontological axioms across policy arenas. While discourse and practice associated with development, conflict and natural disaster-induced internal displacement and resettlement are epistemologically and bureaucratically compartmentalised, a unified perspective reveals that they have more in common than often assumed. A critical review of core concepts in forced migration studies is ­essential to establishing a coherent and consistent nomenclature for the remainder of this volume. Despite their shared characteristics, different categories of forced migration are conceptually segmented and seldom\n\nOne\n\ncompared, either in Sri Lanka or elsewhere. The particular ­framing of specific categories inevitably leads to specific forms of policy and practice. Many of the basic assumptions underpinning these framings play a crucial role in shaping specific regimes for categories of internal displacement and resettlement. In revealing the basic tensions in fundamental concepts of forced migration, the chapter demonstrates how more nuanced and comparative study could lead to very different judgements and conclusions relating to protection and durable solutions. Definitions and labels\n\nDefinitions and labels matter. The representation of conditions and experiences in certain ways serves specific interests and is an inescapable element of public policymaking, its bureaucracies and its discourse. How, by and for whom a concept or phenomenon is defined and labelled frames debates, the design and implementation of interventions and valuations of success or failure. Labelling is neither neutral nor benign. In the case of the refugee label, Zetter (2007: 188) traces out the ways in which it is ‘formed, transformed and “normalised” in policy discourse by bureaucratic practices which seem necessary, appropriate and even benign’. But the highly politicised dynamics of these processes are concealed. Labels affect the balance of power as a result of their capacity to reinforce or deny identity and guarantee conditionality, differentiation, inclusion and exclusion. Labels are therefore an essential feature of stereotyping and social control. There is a compelling theoretical and moral case for enhanced clarity and interrogation of labels in the forced migration field. Certain refugee studies specialists actively critique the political interests that inform the labelling of refugees and the terminological opacity of their field (Zetter 1991, 2007; Turton 2003). Hathaway (2006: 2) believes that forced migration scholars have ‘an ethical responsibility not to adopt categorical distinctions which, while perhaps administratively convenient, fail to reflect true substantive differences’. If arbitrary labels are uncritically accepted and academic contributions reinforce the absorption of these labels into policy ‘then we acquiesce in and perhaps even support that arbitrariness’ (ibid.). Labels are iteratively transmitted between theory and practice. In the case of forced migration studies, as in other sectors relating to development or international law, the divide between the academic and practitioner community is blurred. For example, many labels regularly deployed in contemporary academic discourse featured prominently in the development, humanitarian, post-conflict recovery and natural 14\n\n15\n\nA unified approach\n\ndisaster management sectors since at least the mid-twentieth century (Zolberg et al. 1989; Wood 1985; Drabek and Boggs 1968; White, G. F. 1964). Likewise, a sizeable number of the anthropologists and soci­ologists making seminal contributions to the forced migration field in the 1970s and 1980s were simultaneously employed by organisations involved in ‘managing’ displacement and resettlement, thus hastening an iterative exchange between theoreticians and practitioners. Since the 1970s, ­labels were simultaneously refined and cognitively transmitted between academia and various policy arenas through specialist journals, public forums, training courses and universities (Dwivedi 2002).1 It is not surprising that the forced migration field exhibits so many contested labels. The literature itself comprises a diverse collection of scholarly and policy writings on subjects ranging from refugee law, economic and labour migration to people-trafficking, transhumance, colonisation and frontier settlement. Given such intrinsic disciplinary heterogeneity, the proliferation of different labels was inevitable. ­Zetter (1991) describes these competing labels as akin to ‘currencies’ with fluctuating values and exchange rates. But without a fixed exchange rate, consensus on core concepts and definitions remained elusive. There are also a wide range of bureaucratic interests that condition the application of specific labels. Labels are harnessed by a public policy discourse, whether security-oriented, developmental or humanitarian and used to apportion out assistance and codify entitlements. Sending and Neumann (2006) and Rosenau (2002) describe the instrumentalist use of labels as an extension of governmental rationality or ‘governmentality’. Voutira (1997) described the fusion of bureaucratic interests with labelling as a form of ‘policy logic’: a calculated set of discourses and practices designed to control and regulate populations. While they may project neutrality and impartiality, they are only seldom critically interrogated. Although bureaucratically expedient, they (unintentionally) contribute to the denial of difference, particularly the experiences and attributes of affected populations or acts of (legitimate) resistance. Labels are instruments of power because they assign differences in bene­ficiary rights (Zetter 1991, 2007). How a population group is labelled and defined and the distinctions between those who qualify for a particular right and those who do not, informs state and non-governmental obli­ gations, budgeting, intervention strategies and associated entitlements. Shacknove (1985) observed how for the wide array of forced ­migrants ­facing acute vulnerability ‘refugee status’ is a privileged position. In contrast to others who may be worse-off or destitute, refugees are en­ titled to many forms of international assistance.2 Both refugee and IDP\n\nOne\n\nlabels can also ­unintentionally promote social and economic exclusion by reinforcing latent and revealed prejudices among those who are not similarly categorised. According to Zetter (2007: 184) ‘these new, and ­often pejorative ­labels, are created and embedded in political discourse, policy and practice’. They can generate stereotypes and essentialist under­ standings, whereby being a ‘refugee’, ‘IDP’, ‘illegal asylum seeker’, ‘trafficked ­migrant’ or ‘economic refugee’ overshadows other axes of identity, whether gender, ethnicity, class or caste. The social anthropologist Catherine Brun (2003: 377) noted in her study of internally displaced Muslims in Puttalum, western Sri Lanka, that the IDP category ascribed benefits and stigmas that affected the behaviour of resettled populations and host communities: the label constituted ‘a social category and identity on the ground … [leading to] discrimination instead of preventing it’. Defining displacement\n\nDespite their many ideological and disciplinary differences, forced migration scholars agree that displacement exhibits a range of characteristics distinguishing it from migration.3 These characteristics inform state and non-governmental discourse, policy and the bureaucracies associated with promoting protection and durable solutions. Displacement is conventionally accorded three core features by academics and practitioners, including involuntariness, temporariness and physical dislocation. By way of contrast, migration is characterised as voluntary, even if it is temporally and spatially varied.4 When held up to closer scrutiny, even these three fundamental axioms of displacement are on shaky ground.\n\nVoluntary or involuntary Migration is conventionally attributed to voluntary decision-making while displacement is regularly described as ‘involuntary’ (Castles and Miller 2003; Ghosh 2000; van Hear 1998). Displacement is generally conceived as dichotomous to economic or labour migration: intra-urban and rural–urban population migrations associated with regional imbalances in supply and demand for labour are seldom characterised as displacement. Likewise, mass displacements generated by reservoir development, internecine conflict and earthquakes are distinct from large-scale migrations. Goodwin-Gill (2000: 164) argued that migration should be considered broad enough to include irregular or undocumented migrants, but not ‘refugees, exiles, or others compelled to leave their homes’ (italics added). Though migration can and often does take place before and after displacement it is generally conceded that they are not synonymous. Certain scholars challenge the presumption that migration and dis16\n\ntable 1.1 Labelling migrants and displaced persons Migrant\n\nDisplaced\n\neconomic migrant migrant worker encroacher squatter seasonal migrant economic refugee labour migrant\n\ndisplaced person refugee IDP de-housed evacuee environmental refugee oustee\n\n17\n\nA unified approach\n\nplacement can be readily distinguished on the basis of a voluntary– involuntary dichotomy (Hathaway 2006; Castles 2003; Zolberg et al. 1989). They argue that the determination of ‘involuntariness’ depends on whether a choice to remain is in fact available. Discerning whether or not a choice is freely exercised is invariably subjective. Referring to the case of villagisation in Ethiopia, Gebre (2002: 270–1) problematised the binary classification and added new sub-categories or degrees of ‘intent’: voluntary, induced–voluntary, compulsory voluntary and involuntary. Critics of the voluntary–involuntary dichotomy contend that it presupposes a level (or lack) of agency: it artificially reduces displacement to situations where there are no viable alternatives other than self- or household-preservation. But who defines viable alternatives and selfpreservation? Is choice exercised exclusively by an individual, by the family or a larger collective? What is the threshold that constitutes a threat to personal or household survival? These questions are inherently subjective and tricky to measure, as asylum claimants and immigration officials regularly attest. A tipping point distinguishing the phenomenon of voluntary migration from involuntary displacement is real and implied coercion. Whether in the context of poverty or affluence, the practice of migration reflects a deliberate pursuit of new and better opportunities free of external encumbrance. An Intergovernmental Working Group of Experts established by the UN Commission on Human Rights (UN 1997a: 15) confirmed that migration occurs in ‘all cases where the decision (to migrate) is taken freely by the individual concerned, for reason of personal convenience and without intervention of an external compelling factor’ (italics added). By contrast, displacement is most likely to occur where choices are res­ tricted and where an individual or an individual’s family faces more physical and psychological risks than opportunities by staying in their place of residence (Muggah 2003; Hyndman 2000). While overt violence\n\nOne\n\nmay trigger displacement, there are more subtle forms of coercion that also shape or restrict choices. As Penz (2003) observed, whatever the attributed real or perceived causes leading to population movement, ‘if it is voluntary, it is not displacement’. Even where displacement is assumed to be taking place, the label is often at odds with the actually occurring phenomena. As will be demon­ strated in the case study sections of this volume, circumstances cast by policymakers and bureaucrats as voluntary migration (e.g. whether labour-related or as part of a colonisation scheme) can, on closer inspection, entail involuntariness such as forced evictions and evacuations. Likewise, interventions that generate displacement and resettlement, including dam and reservoir construction or the relocation of populations into emergency camps during wars, may trigger an influx of ostensibly voluntary encroachers, squatters, landless peasants and assisted migrants (Partridge 1993; Hansen and Oliver-Smith 1982, table 1). It is important to recall that settlement and resettlement programmes labelled as ‘voluntary’ or ‘involuntary’ may be accompanied by degrees of coercion or no implied threat at all.\n\nTemporary or permanent The categorisation of different types of dis­ placement converges around their attributed causes. For example, ­displacement is typically causally linked to a discernible external shock. These shocks range from urban renewal or village expansion to dams or mining projects, armed conflicts, ethnic cleansing and natural disasters such as tidal waves, cyclones, floods or mud-slides. With the attribution of a cause, it follows that displacement can be traced to a clearly demarcated starting point. But internal displacement can also begin well before the alleged triggering event(s). For example, the alienation and annexation of land that precedes urban renewal or a large-scale dam-building project may require planned ‘evacuations’ well before physical assets are appropriated, compensated for, or destroyed (Cernea 2003). Depending on informational asymmetries and the relative vulnerability of households, displacement may also begin long before a specific (life-threatening) attack or major climatic event – in which case population movement may, confusingly, be cast by outsiders as migration. There is a persistent belief among forced migration scholars that displacement usually constitutes a temporary disequilibrium. As a shortterm aberration, it follows that displacement can be ‘normalised’ with the introduction of ‘protective measures’ and ended with the provision of so-called durable solutions. There is an underlying compulsion among scholars and policymakers to redress displacement with the return of the 18\n\n19\n\nA unified approach\n\ndisplaced to either their original ‘place’ following their (voluntary) ‘return’ or ‘resettlement’ to a new place to resume an otherwise ‘normal’ existence. Pedersen (2003: 4) argues that this perspective is based on deeply embedded political and cultural values prevalent in the forced migration field (and others) that suppose a ‘natural’ link between people, identity and territory. Likewise, Malkki (1995) describes the instinctive attachment to sedentarism as part of the ‘national order of things’ (italics added). In practice, displacement is rarely temporally fixed, much less temporary. Depending on the situation, displacement ranges from nocturnal flight to protracted situations – and instances of varying periods of displacement can occur side by side as in northern Uganda, Colombia, Nepal or Sri Lanka (Muggah 2000a, 2005b, 2006). A lingering question among certain forced migration scholars is the determination of when displacement ends. There is virtually no consensus on when internal displacement ends, much less who decides. As Mooney (2002a: 4) makes clear, ‘decisions on when internal displacement ends are made, if at all, on an ad hoc and arbitrary basis’.5 Most often the ‘end’ of displacement is constructed as a set of legal and bureaucratic exit-strategies independent of whether the political and social factors that gave rise to dislocation persist. In the case of development projects, displacement ends when resettlement is said by project planners to have taken place, irrespective of whether first-, second- or third-generation households integrated into designated schemes or not. Conflict and natural disaster-induced displacement ends when a specified quantity of relief aid and shelter is provided, the conditions for return or resettle­ment are considered ‘safe’ and individuals are sent to ‘voluntarily’ relocate. A growing cadre of forced migration scholars also emphasise the use of subjective criteria to measure when internal displacement ends: affected populations themselves must decide whether they are displaced (or not) even if this approach is susceptible to manipulation (Castles 2002; Frelick 2001; Demusz 2000). A number of international research institutes elaborated typologies for determining when displacement ends. The Brookings-SAIS project, for example, outlined ‘cause-based’ criteria drawn by analogy from the concept of ‘cessation’ in refugee studies, where the absence of the attributed cause (e.g. a large-scale dam or the well-founded fear of persecution) is grounds for ending the classification of internal displacement.6 Also noted are ‘solutions-based’ criteria, wherein displacement is claimed to end when the possibility of a durable solution – whether ‘local integration’, ‘return’ or ‘resettlement’ – exists. Thus, after a designated period of time, those not availing themselves of the opportunity are determined\n\nOne\n\nto have spontaneously settled on their own. A third possibility includes a ‘needs-based’ criterion which considers displacement to have ended when affected populations no longer register unmet needs or requirements for protection and assistance. Some practitioners argue that arbitrary and externally determined cut-off points could put the lives of such populations in jeopardy (Frelick 2001).\n\nPhysical or extra-geographic Policymakers and practitioners often ­assume that the physical movement of individuals and households (with or without their assets) is a core criterion of displacement. As such, displacement entails a geographic relocation from legally or customarily owned, rented or borrowed land and property to another place. ‘De-territorialisation’ is frequently held as a necessary condition of dis­ placement such that proof (e.g. formal or informal documentation including deeds and title or oral testimony) is required by authorities in order for the displaced to claim entitlements and access to a durable solution. Physical dislocation is also expected to generate a number of patho­logies depending on the profile of the displaced individual or household. Research since the 1970s detected a number of outcomes associated with physical dislocation ranging from the loss of physical home and property to reduced income-earning potential and productivity.7 Sutton (1977: 284) observed in many instances of displacement that resettlers adopted a ‘bi-polarised’ attitude to their predicament: at one extreme there emerged ‘a high degree of activity and self-help combined with individualism … at the other a high degree of inactivity and apathy combined with dependent attitudes’. The fundamental expectation of physical or geographic movement as a core feature of displacement raises tricky conceptual and ethical questions. For example, what is the metric of physical dislocation? Can it be limited to a few metres from one’s original place or must it extend to the neighbouring home, village, district or country? What constitutes an original place? Should those lacking formal or customary rights to a fixed territory or who are non-property owners be excluded? What happens to pastoral or nomadic populations who are without a ‘formal’ home to begin with? These questions are frequently glossed over in the rush to provide assistance. They inevitably resurface in the process of planning and executing durable solutions. Certain scholars accept that displacement should not and cannot be restricted to physical dislocation alone. Many of them are exploring the extra-geographic or non-spatial manifestations of displacement in relation to the dispossession of assets, entitlements and lost opportunities 20\n\nbefore and after a displacement event (Cernea 1999). In their view, displacement encompasses more than the physical movement of individuals and households. For example, Cernea (2003) describes how upstream development projects can affect water quality, salinisation, pasture land and cash-crop production in designated catchments, potentially contributing to the ‘displacement’ of livelihoods and leading to suffering that may or may not ultimately contribute to physical displacement.8 Jacobsen (2001) demonstrates how food security, access to public services and markets and social networks can be ‘displaced’ as a result of armed conflicts even if affected populations are not physically dislocated. The debate over whether displacement entails physical movement is not esoteric or purely semantic. In some cases, the extra-physical outcomes of displacement are explicitly accounted and compensated for even if these in turn raise more questions about what is not displacement and how to prioritise and budget for possible durable solutions. It is to one of these durable solutions – resettlement – that this chapter now turns. Parameters of resettlement\n\nResettlement as social engineering While there may be no natural category of resettlement, there are relatively clear boundaries to the debate. As one scholar on resettlement observed in the late 1960s, resettlement consists of ‘planned social change that necessarily entails population movement, population selection and most probably population control’ (Chambers 21\n\nA unified approach\n\nLike displacement, resettlement is a diffuse and misunderstood concept. Writing on settlement and resettlement in Africa, Sutton (1977: 219) lamented the ‘inability of research to draw meaningful generalisations from the disparate literature on settlement and resettlement schemes’. While Palmer (1974) initially saw the virtues in possibly comparing different forms of relocation arising from development, war and overpopulation, Chambers (1969: 12) condemned resettlement studies to an ‘academic no man’s land … [wherein] no single science or study has yet established its claims and each has its limitations’. At its most basic, resettlement entails the planned and controlled relocation of populations from one physical place to another. It involves the relocation of individuals and even entire communities to a new place which distinguishes it from ‘return’ to one’s place of origin. Though frequently conflated with other forms of migration, resettlement can occur only when the choice to remain in one’s original place is fundamentally constrained by real or perceived coercion. As noted by Scudder (1973), the compulsory nature of resettlement is crucial: resettlement schemes are an expression of coercion.\n\nOne\n\n1969: 5). Resettlement therefore incorporates a strong spatial element and a high degree of social control. Since at least the middle of the twentieth century, urban planners, civil engineers and certain social scientists presumed that resettlement followed a predictable and mechanical ­sequence which, with adequate planning and management, could account for and minimise the risks and vulnerabilities that accompanied physical dislocation (Cernea 1990; Scudder and Colson 1982; Colson 1971). More recently, a number of scholars and practitioners have also endorsed the instrumental use of resettlement as a vehicle for development. Resettlement has long been construed as a platform for social en­ gin­eer­ing and an opportunity to enact far-reaching political, economic, social and demographic transformation. Since the 1950s it constituted an important pillar of modernisation theory and, inevitably, attracted considerable contoversy and subaltern opposition.9 Chambers (1969: 34) described resettlement schemes as ‘experiments in nation-building in miniature’, while Scudder (1973) introduced the concept of ‘ecological imperialism’ to highlight the ways in which resettlement schemes repres­ ented an extension of the international economic system – command- or capitalist-driven – into new domains. Whatever paradigm is ultimately invoked to explain resettlement, most scholars arrived at similar conclusions regarding its outcomes: resettlement had immense destructive potential in relation to human lives and livelihoods. Both Sutton (1977) and Scudder (1973) observed that resettlement often faltered precisely because it was not initiated ‘from within’ but rather by (outside) social actors who negated complexity and embraced technical solutions. They attributed poor returns to the inability of resettlement planners to recon­ cile modern and ‘traditional’ value-systems. Resettlement was expected to harness modernist management procedures to transform (civilise) ‘backward’, ‘primitive’ and otherwise dislocated populations. Considerable faith was vested in the technical machinery of resettlement, including an efficient administrative bureau­ cracy, the resources of international agencies and donors and the innovative spatial morphology of the schemes themselves. Reacting to the high modernist aspirations of the resettlement enterprise was an eclectic opposition movement comprised of actors within ‘civil society’.10 They actively resisted hegemonic and frequently elite-driven resettlement interventions. Likewise, forced migration scholars critically examined the (negative) effects of resettlement – particularly on minority and indigenous groups and in some cases identified strategies to mitigate and reverse the pathologies that frequently accompanied the process. Despite repeated and documented failures of resettlement to create 22\n\ndurable solutions for those involved – whether in terms of self-reliant and productive communities or livelihoods restored to (or above) predisplacement levels – faith in its potential was unshakeable. The World Bank (2000), ADB (2001) and others anticipated that carefully planned and managed resettlement could side-step impoverishment of those ousted by development projects. The yardstick of successful resettlement included criteria such as income restoration and land-for-land compensation (Cernea 1999, Cernea and Mathur 2008). Although less optimistic than the World Bank, the UN (1998) was also convinced that successful resettlement of conflict- and disaster-affected populations could be administered in such a way as to be equitable and free of discrimination, accounting for the safety and dignity of the ‘beneficiaries’, ensuring fair compensation for lost land, income and assets and involving the ‘full participation of the [internally] displaced in public affairs’.11 These criteria, they also argued, formed the basis of durable solutions.\n\n23\n\nA unified approach\n\nLabelling resettlement Resettlement is persistently confused with other, related processes. Sutton (1977) observed a bewildering variety of ‘­origins, sizes and objectives’ of resettlement schemes, making it difficult to generalise across cases but also leading to confusion about what was and what was not resettlement. For example, the expression is often used interchangeably with ‘settlement’ and ‘colonisation’ (Kibreab 1989; Colson 1971; Chambers 1969). Unlike these latter concepts, resettlement is involuntary. Whether or not settlement and colonisation processes coincide with development programmes or ethnic cleansing, the incid­ ence of coercion distinguishes resettlement from otherwise voluntary population relocation. Resettlement is distinct from ‘assisted migration’, a process that also includes an element of state planning and involves the relocation of individuals – ideally ‘enterprising’ young men – and the clearing, development and (re)population of otherwise uninhabited areas (Table 1.2). Dunham (1982, 1983) described how settlement schemes and colonisation processes from Sri Lanka’s southern districts to the north were purposefully described as economic and labour migration, thus ensuring benign – if subtly hegemonic – connotations. Additional concepts are often substituted with resettlement and further complicate a coherent and unified understanding. For example, ‘return’, ‘repatriation’, ‘reintegration’ and ‘integration’ are all expressions frequently invoked as synonyms of resettlement by policymakers and practitioners (Kibreab 1989, 1996a). Depending on who invokes them, the expressions ‘return’ and ‘repatriation’ carry precise legal meanings and refer to the relocation of displaced populations either across an\n\nOne\n\ntable 1.2 Labelling settlers and resettlers Settlement\n\nResettlement\n\n(spontaneous) settler coloniser assisted migrant pioneer encroacher slum dweller\n\nresettler reintegratee relocate project-affected person project-dislocated integratee\n\ni­ nter­national frontier or back to their original place of residence. ‘Reinsertion’, ‘reintegration’ and ‘integration’ are concepts that refer more generally to the restoration of living standards and the rearticulation of social, cultural and economic networks with host communities. They may accompany resettlement or they may or not (Muggah 2008a; Jacobsen 2001; Kibreab 2000). Although certain scholars and practitioners contend that they represent constitutive features of resettlement, others are adamant that one or all may take place independently. A wide range of labels exists to classify resettled populations and to compartmentalise assistance strategies (Tables 1.2 and 1.3). These labels are seldom consistently applied and can generate new contradictions on the ground. In Sri Lanka, people resettled in the wake of conflict and natural disasters are referred to alternately as ‘refugees’, ‘internal refugees’, ‘evacuees’, ‘inmates’, ‘unsettled’, ‘IDPs’, ‘de-housed’, ‘homeless’, ‘rehoused’ and ‘settlers’. Those resettled following development projects are described as, inter alia, ‘oustees’, ‘project-affected persons’ (PAPs), ‘resettlers’, ‘­pioneers’ and ‘colonisers’. Although certain expressions may table 1.3 Forced migration terminology in Sri Lanka Cause\n\nDisplacement\n\nResettlement\n\nDevelopment\n\noustee, evictee, PAP, de-housed, settlers, resettler coloniser\n\ncolony units, settlement schemes and resettlement schemes\n\nConflict\n\nrefugee, internal refugees, refugee camps, transit evacuees, inmates, IDPs, centres, welfare centres conflict-displaced and relocation villages\n\nNatural disasters disaster refugees, IDPs and tsunami IDPs\n\n24\n\ntemporary shelters, transitional shelters, donor-driven housing and owner-driven housing\n\nbe deployed as rhetorical devices in order to draw attention to a specific population group or experience, the lack of consensus on labels can disguise the causes of their relocation. In the 1990s, for example, the Sinhala media labelled development-induced displaced and resettled as jalasayata yatawena, which can be roughly translated as ‘people who were getting inundated’. Similarly, those internally displaced and re­settled by war during the early 1980s were labelled alternately as refugees or anatha – ‘orphans’ or ‘lacking a lord or master’.12 Later classified as ‘victims’ (and later ‘survivors’) by international aid agencies, they were soon derided and stigmatised in welfare centres and relocation villages owing to their alleged involvement in the war (Brun 2003).\n\n25\n\nA unified approach\n\nResettlement as permanence If displacement is perceived to be temporary, resettlement is envisioned as a permanent process of relocation. In the case of development-induced displacement and resettlement, schemes are ordinarily prepared as a sub-component of a larger enterprise, whether dam and reservoir project, road-building initiative, urban renewal or parkland development. Provisions for resettlement, where they are incorporated at all, are anticipated to begin before and extend far beyond the life-span of the intervention giving rise to relocation in the first instance. Meanwhile, planned relocation arising from conflict and natural disaster-induced internal displacement and resettlement is often designed in such a way as to ensure a permanent (e.g. durable in the vernacular) solution. But actual experience frequently deviates from expectations. Resettlement is conceptualised and designed in such a way as to catalyse self-sustaining or self-reliant communities. Resettlement schemes typically offer ‘modern’ housing designs and materials and are schem­ atically ordered and laid out in a grid-pattern. The com­pactness and proximity of the new housing schemes often contrasts with the more dispersed and organic village clusters from where resettlers hailed. Des­ pite the unfamiliar (social and geographic) layout of the new schemes and surrounding area, resettlement planners expect that they can result in durable solutions if prepared adequately in advance and in consultation with affected populations. Paradoxically, planned resettlement schemes are often prematurely abandoned by project implementers and re­settlers a short time after they are established. To paraphrase Jane Jacobs (1961), while much may be known about what a broken community looks like, comparatively less is known about how to bring about a functional ­community. The following sections consider the emergence of three separate\n\nOne\n\nepistemic communities, focusing alternately on development-, conflictand disaster-induced internal displacement and resettlement. Separate communities preoccupied with forced migration – themselves composed of advocacy coalitions and public policy networks – emerged in the latter half of the twentieth century. Though struggling to define the conceptual boundaries of the debate and often working on multiple forms of displacement and resettlement, they were instrumental to the development of the basic ideational parameters of the regimes described in Chapter 2. Often characterised and studied as discrete phenomena, this chapter reveals that there are many more synergies between different types of displacement and resettlement than commonly assumed.\n\nDevelopment-induced displacement and resettlement Research on DIDR exhibits a comparatively long and distinguished pedigree. In the 1940s urban planners in the United States generated critical insights into the more ruinous outcomes of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) project, including longitudinal evidence of the consequences of large-scale hydroelectric power generation systems on the livelihoods of hundreds of resettled households.13 But few scholars loom larger in the early debates on DIDR than Brokensha and Scudder (1968), Chambers (1969) and Colson (1971). From the beginning of their academic careers, these researchers worked as consultants to major multilateral and bilateral agencies, governments and private sector corporations. As such, their research and findings were not immune to policy imperatives. While generating empirical contributions, they simultaneously aimed to influence the protocols and practices of their patrons. Early research on DIDR shared a number of methodological features. Many studies transferred anthropological and sociological models of social change and migration theory to the phenomenology of resettlement – focusing primarily on the stresses and responses of populations to relocation. Long-term and frequently ethnographic research and cohort surveys explored the experience of populations resettled by dams and infrastructure projects in Africa and South Asia (e.g. Zambia, Kenya, Ghana and Sri Lanka). Most of these early scholars held essentially common, if radical, positions on the overwhelmingly negative consequences arising from urban and rural development. Colson (1971: 1) wrote how ‘massive technological development hurts … economic planners, technicians and political leaders … count the engineering cost but not the social costs’. Likewise, Scudder (1973) described how ‘compulsory resettlement is a traumatic experience which precipitates stress and leads to a crisis of cultural identity’. 26\n\n27\n\nA unified approach\n\nThe dominant conceptual resettlement models emerging from this ­ eriod were formulated by Chambers (1970, 1971) and Colson (1971). p Each detected a series of trends and patterns of change (stresses) that characterised resettled communities across time and space. Colson expanded Chambers’s multi-stage framework and formulated a four-staged linear model that began before the displacement event, anticipated a measure of risk adversity in the immediate post-displacement period and was followed by a comparatively smooth period of transition from rehabilitation to the handing-over phase. Though initially focusing on (voluntary) settlement in Zambia, her conceptual framework was later extended to the analysis of (involuntary) resettlement by Scudder and Colson (1979, 1982) and Eriksen (1999) in Africa. Many of these early contributors doubted whether resettlement, as with many instances of ‘assisted migration’, left people better off than those settling on their own. Criticism began to focus on the structure of resettlement management processes and the ways in which the process regularly deviated from a predictable chronological trajectory. Critics of the linear modelling of resettlement emerged in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s (Hulme 1988; ­Sutton 1977). On the basis of a growing body of empirical evidence, much of it generated from prior evaluations of World Bank-financed projects, they determined that ‘not all projects pass through all stages [described by Chambers or Colson]’ and that ‘a steady movement [through all four stages] is the exception rather than the rule’ (Cernea 1997). The next generation of DIDR scholars included, among others, Cernea (1991, 1996) and Harrell-Bond (1982, 1986). Despite holding divergent epistemological perspectives from their predecessors and each other they nevertheless embarked on a useful collaborative experiment to learn from one another. There were deep unacknowledged ideological fault-lines dividing scholars and practitioners working on DIDR in the 1980s and 1990s, and perhaps fewer areas of consensus than presumed. Their perspectives were neatly, controversially, summarised by Mathur (2000) and Dwivedi (2002) into contiguous camps: applied and action researchers. ­Applied scholars envision DIDR as an inevitable, if unintended, consequence of development. They contend that with effective planning and micro­management, social pathologies can be avoided and that resettler livelihoods can be substantially improved.14 Action researchers consider DIDR to be a failure of the development paradigm and an expression of deep power asymmetries. They focus on identifying the causes of dislocation, measuring the individual, communal and societal costs of the enterprise, the vested interests of elites, subaltern movements and identity-based politics shaping the resettlement and the dynamics of resistance.\n\nOne\n\nMost contemporary resettlement specialists fall somewhere in between the two camps. Some reject interventions that lead to mass displacement in principle, though they are compelled to identify the opportunities ­afforded to some groups by the political and economic dynamics of social change. While working as a consultant to the World Bank, Partridge (1993) documented the ways in which certain indigenous northern Colombian populations resettled in the context of oil and hydro-electric projects in the 1970s and 1980s exhibited ‘productive energy’ and entrepreneurial spirit following their ‘release’ from culturally and socially embedded ‘constraints’. Likewise, Kibreab (1996a) described the ways in which Ethiopians resettled as a result of villagisation schemes – particularly single female-headed households – availed themselves of new marketbased opportunities when patriarchal (Tigrayan) systems of land and asset ownership broke down. The transformation of a pre-existing social order made possible by resettlement gave rise to new social, cultural and economic spaces in which to reconstitute radically changed identities and livelihoods. Despite this rapprochement, applied and action researchers speak to differentiated understandings of the fundamental purpose, values and principles of development. In time, Cernea (1997) introduced a new conceptual approach to measuring and practically responding to DIDR. His ‘impoverishment risk and livelihood reconstruction’ framework was innovative precisely because it advanced a synchronic perspective to estimating and ultimately reversing the poverty-inducing risks associated with resettlement. In purposefully departing from linear modelling, the model proposed a typology to antici­pate and mitigate impoverishment. The framework forced planners and researchers to consider a wider assortment of risks accompanying resettlement, including landlessness, joblessness, homelessness, social marginalisation, increased mortality and morbidity, food insecurity, loss of access to common property and social disarticulation. Other potential risks added (in the context of war-displaced) include reduced access to public and private services (i.e. education and health), political disenfranchisement and exposure to acute violence (Muggah 2000a, 2000b). The model was evidence-based, drawing as it did from a multi-project review of World Bank- (1994) and non-bank-financed resettlement schemes with an active reflection on past theoretical contributions. While the merits and limitations of the conceptual framework are widely debated, it acquired a considerable degree of legitimacy in the DIDR community and is widely in use in Africa, South Asia and Latin America (Cernea 2005, 2006). 28\n\n29\n\nA unified approach\n\nConflict-induced displacement and resettlement Theoretical innovations in relation to CIDR lagged behind those debated by DIDR scholars and practitioners. Unlike early practitioners working on dam-related displacement and resettlement, scholars examining displacement arising from war attached more importance to the immediate logistical imperatives of aid delivery than to sustained reflection and research. During the 1970s and 1980s grounded and long-term research in and around war zones was limited to only the most assiduous researchers (Crisp 1999; Harrell-Bond 1986). By the 1990s, empirical research on CIDR expanded dramatically. The focus of this nascent epistemic community was oriented towards the production and dissemination of the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement (UN 1998), described in greater detail in Chapter 2. Most published outputs were noteworthy more for their rich advocacy potential than for their original theory development. Rather than drawing on inductive approaches, conceptual models for CIDR borrowed heavily from refugee studies. That the study of CIDR stimulated comparatively limited academic engagement from the 1950s to the 1970s should come as little surprise to the discerning reader of Cold War era geo-politics. After all, it was refugees – not IDPs – who figured prominently in the contest between the United States and the then Soviet Union. In addition to serving as a valuable source of potential intelligence, refugees and asylum claimants were held up as a vindication of the failings of the other. By way of contrast, those unable to flee across borders were seldom enumerated, consigned instead to collateral damage arising from the proxy wars of the period. The drafters of the 1951 Refugee Convention and many of the relief agencies operating in and around war-affected areas since the 1960s were aware of these so-called internal refugees. But robust scholarly enquiry was constrained by intermittent access and marginal political and popular interest. Many felt it was simply too difficult to fit the phenom­ enon into contemporary discourse or legal doctrine associated with war, peace and development. The truth is that internal displacement did not really matter. There were few obvious normative or political gains to drive the agenda and, in any case, attention was focused on bolstering the emerging refugee regime (Chapter 2). By the late 1980s and early 1990s a dedicated literature on CIDR was emerging. It was accompanied and even stimulated as in the case of DIDR, by persistent advocacy and lobbying from a transnational movement composed of non-governmental entities. Prominent among them were the United Nations Quakers Office (QUNO) and the American Friends Associations who, together with certain humanitarian and\n\nOne\n\n­ evelopment practitioners, were placing a premium on (human) rights d and need-driven relief assistance. Although the management and res­ ponse to internal displacement was initially cast as distinct from the protection and permanent solutions endowed to refugees, CIDR discourse and practice borrowed liberally from the refugee field (Hathaway 2006). Early analysts spoke of protecting and providing assistance for internally displaced people, of preparing systems to ensure ‘care and maintenance’ and facilitating ‘durable solutions’ such as local integration, return and resettlement. Even though the internal displacement issue presented a conundrum to their mandate, UNHCR, together with a host of research institutions, played a seminal role in building the conceptual scaffolding of CIDR. Throughout the early 1990s the UNHCR, alongside the UN Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR) and the United Nations General Assembly, issued a series of resolutions, declarations, statements and guidelines on the subject of ‘in-country flight alternatives’, return and resettlement – often at the insistence of a core group of donor states and advocacy groups noted above (UNGA 1993a, 1993b, 1995). Although not statutorily mandated to advocate on behalf of the internally displaced, the UNHCR mobilised support for them, supported inter-institutional cap­ acities within the UN to respond to their needs and took the lead to protect and assist them in certain circumstances – usually on the grounds that they were preventing new refugee flows or extending their reach to ‘others of concern’ where programmes already supported refugees. The Brookings Project on Internal Displacement (renamed the SAIS/ CUNY-Brookings Project) also provided an institutional platform for a UN Special Representative on Internal Displacement to carry out his mandate to elaborate Guiding Principles (Chapter 2). The conceptualisation of CIDR drew from UNHCR’s evolving experience with local (re)settlement of refugees. In the first few decades of its existence, UNHCR, with the backing of UN member states, promoted third-country resettlement of refugees, particularly where options for repatriation were unavailable (Pitterman 1997).15 ‘Internment’ or ‘refugee’ camps were comparatively rare during this period and resorted to only as an interim measure (Wigley 2002; Black 1998; van Damme 1995). The strategy of permanent third-country resettlement for refugees soon gave way to two other durable solutions: (voluntary) repatriation and local (re)-settlement. Because of their relatively low political and economic cost to donor states, repatriation and local (re)settlement emerged as the preferred durable solution for refugees in developing countries from the late 1970s onwards (Roberts, A. 1998). 30\n\n31\n\nA unified approach\n\nBy the 1980s in-country settlement of refugees became widespread – primarily in Africa. The expansion of ‘local’ (re)settlement can be attri­buted to two key factors: first, the steadily diminishing interest of Western states to process refugees from underdeveloped countries and second the prominence of a modernisation ideology calling for increased agriculture-led development through cheap labour. Notwithstanding the fact that most countries hosting large refugee caseloads already displayed a massive labour surplus, so-called local durable solutions were frequently preferred by refugees themselves, many of whom anticipated swift re­patriation. Local (re)settlement came to be modelled after two prototypes: the refugee camp and the rural (re)settlement scheme. Bakhet (1987) traced the refugee camp model to the early 1960s where it emerged in East Africa – particularly Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya.16 According to Black (1998: 2), camps then as now were ‘large … overcrowded sites that are … dependent on assistance’. Camps were frequently characterised as holding tanks, remote from line-service functions and (intentionally) isolated to keep (foreign) refugees separated and distinguishable from the local populace. They were distinct from the ‘small open settlements where refugees have been able to maintain a village atmosphere’ that Black (ibid.) and, later, Schmidt (2003) described as ‘settlements’ or ‘village schemes’. Key characteristics of camps included the active promotion of self-reliance coupled with centralised and heavily managed systems of control. Early approaches to the design and management of camps were analogous to the settlement schemes examined by Colson (1971) and others in the case of DIDR. Their design drew consciously on predictable linear models that anticipated an emergency phase; a self-support and transition phase; an integrated settlement phase; and, the eventual possibility of a transfer or handing-over of services to refugees themselves. Owing to early successes with local (re)settlement in Africa, the camp approach began to spread, often replicating assumptions and lessons derived from the African context to new and challenging environments. It was not until the late 1980s and early 1990s that the social consequences of camps came under scrutiny and the issue of ‘protracted refugee situations’ emerged as a concern to the donor community (Crisp 2002; van Damme 1995). The camp model for refugees and IDPs came under withering criticism. A persistent objection was that camps unnecessarily prolonged displacement and failed to offer concrete durable solutions. Camps allowed policymakers to side-step hard choices associated with repatriation and third-country resettlement in favour of uncontroversial technocratic interventions. By publicly exhibiting suffering they served as\n\nOne\n\na magnet or a visible vector for aid. But critics began to recognise that the core aspirations of camps, whether defined as self-sufficiency, selfreliance or community viability, were seldom realised on the ground. One popular narrative was that the failures of camps were somehow internal to the populations that inhabited them. Because the least resilient and most vulnerable people frequently relocate to camps and resettlement schemes, particularly the extreme poor, single-parent households, children and the elderly, their evolution into functional communities was unlikely. By contrast, the wealthier and socially connected spontaneously relocated elsewhere, joining an international diaspora, in some cases housing their extended families in camps until they could be relocated.17 Another narrative attributed camp failures to paternalistic and top-down regulatory structures and systems of management and control that deprived camp residents of alternative livelihoods or kept them from drawing on or creating organic social and economic networks (Hyndman 2000; Harrell-Bond 1998). The rural (re)settlement scheme emerged as a de facto response to the inherent challenges of accounting for and physically controlling mass refugee influxes in the 1970s and 1980s. Early operational reactions to refugee movements depended less on externally planned and administered camps then on the hospitality and absorptive capacity of hosting communities. Where there were shared ethnic, religious, linguistic or socio-cultural characteristics between host communities and refugees, (rural) resettlement schemes appeared to be more easily administered than large camps (Wolde-Selassie 2000; Kibreab 1996a, 1996b; Hansen 1981). These localised resettlement schemes therefore tended to adopt fewer systems of centralised control than was the case in camps and advocated complementary, rather than parallel, social services for both refugee and hosting populations. Resettlement schemes were readily distinguishable from refugee camps. The former put a premium on self-sufficiency in agricultural production, the granting of tenancy rights, an expansion in cash-cropping and in certain cases, permanent integration. According to Neldner (1979: 33), from the earliest days the aim of such planned resettlement schemes was to bring refugees into ‘self-support through agricultural production’ even if on inhospitable, unproductive and marginal land. This particular feature was not lost on many host governments, which recognised the opportunities of bringing peripheral land into cultivation, or even of the potential for refugee camps to serve as frontier ‘buffers’ against hostile neighbouring states. Nor was the logic of these schemes missed by many locally "
