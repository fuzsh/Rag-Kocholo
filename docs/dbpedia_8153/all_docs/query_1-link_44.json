        "text": "ABSTRACT The main purpose of this paper is to explore, how the changing social structure was crucially impact on formation of local administration in the context of local democracy in pre- and post -independence Sri Lanka. The ancient administration system was highly centered and autocratic in the king domain period in Sri Lankan society. Entire administration system was completely controlled by the king and his subordinatesâ€™ class who had more privileges and civil powers than ordinary people on various social capacities. Due to this privileges and civil authorities of this elite group that people did not have sufficient opportunity to engage in administrative activities or politics on what they need to wish. This trend has been shown not only under the colonial period but also after independency as well. Therefore, a puzzle is creating regarding period of pre- and post-independence administrative and local governance process in Sri Lanka. There was a sufficient opportunity for the people with regard participate of politics and administrative functions. Also, considerable social change has been taken place by the time. There are sufficient structural changes were happened in grass root politics, yet, there was no shown proof evidence about sufficient opportunities for the people regarding participation in politics or administration in the governance activities, why? This study will depend on number of arguments and interpretations which have been given by the previous scholars regarding social changes and political transformation in pre and post colonial Sri Lanka. Therefore, this study is employs critical theory which is one of the main post modern approaches of scientific inquiry as a major methodology for the analysis of existing arguments. Therefore, research will be critically examined the existing nature of the context by using scholarly writings and interpretations. The main limitation of this research is finding relevant secondary sources documents which written by the previous scholars regarding same field. Mainly, this research has been found that class, cast and wealth as well as dominant civil power has been used for maintain and sustain of the politics and administration of local governance in pre and post independence Sri Lanka. Further, final output of this research can be used scholars who desire to do a research on same area with applying same methodology. Key Words: Social Power, Elites domination, Local Administration, Local Governance,\n\nThis paper discusses the concept of democracy, which is the cornerstone of modern governance, and how the Parliamentary democratic process in Sri Lanka has been put in place to ensure the will of the People. It provides a brief history on the evolution of democracy, and how it varies in definition and characteristics, but at its heart, envisions the creation and legitimization of structures and institutions of government. Then, the paper discusses the democratic process within the Sri Lankan context, and how the Constitution recognizes and respects the sovereignty of the people as the very bedrock of democracy. This article delves deeper into the nature and functions of the legislature, and its role within the Sri Lankan democracy. As such, the legislature serves as a representation of people engaged in law-making and scrutinising the way public funds are spent. It also explores the interplay between the legislature, judiciary and the executive and the way each serves as a check and balance on the other. This paper ultimately concludes that the definitive test of democratic governance is the protection and sustenance of a country's People, and therefore, it is imperative that each arm of the government act in the People's best interest.\n\nDecentralization and local development planning are two important concepts in the current development discourse. In this paper they are embedded in the specific conditions of the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka. The armed conflict dates back to the early 1980s, but the currently dramatically changing circumstances in the North and East of the country call for a fresh investigation of the capacities in development planning in the context of government reforms particularly at the local level. Part 1 of the paper focuses on the overall institutional framework of development planning in the Northeast. In Part 2 a concrete project outlines an approach to combine forces of both the Divisional Secretariat and the Local Government authorities to enhance planning capacities at the local level by formulating a single comprehensive development plan. In many respects the findings of the institutional study and the lessons learned during the project indicate that similar obstacles and deficiencies exist in other parts of the country as well.\n\nEconomic development at the regional level was rega rded as an expected major intention with the commencement of t he Provincial Council (PC) system in 1987. However, even after al most three decades of power devolution the expected outcome of the PC system is seemingly yet to be realized. Regardless of the fac t that the current practice of regional development policy under the P C system is less effective, successive regimes, including the curren t, have made no clear decision to abolish it. According to Uduporuw a (2007), development strategies implemented by Sri Lanka wit hin the past fifty years have not contributed to reduce the socio-econ omic disparities in Sri Lanka. Gunaruwan and Samarasekara (2013) found that the PCs spend largely on emoluments and spend for their own existence rather than for economic development at regional level. Th ese arguments therefore raise the question on the rationality of c ntinuing with the existing PC system in Sri Lanka."
