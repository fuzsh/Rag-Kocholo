Satchidanandan translated from Malayalam. The first poem describes an unwritten poem that has traveled through many poets but remained unexpressed. The second poem describes a cactus that uses thorns for language and defense after its flowers were trampled. The third poem personifies the days of the week arriving and departing. The fourth poem is about an invisible being the poet knows is there like unseen stars or words on the edge of language.",
