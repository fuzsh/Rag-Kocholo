        "text": "Remembering a prof’s service to medicine.\n\nIt was an emotionally-charged ‘Valedictory meeting’ when high-level academics, both medical and non-medical, gathered at the New Lecture Hall of the august Colombo Medical Faculty on September 17 to bid adieu to former dean, mentor, colleague and friend, Prof. Rohan W. Jayasekara.\n\nWhile brief and powerful presentations were made to showcase how Prof. Jayasekara’s ‘innovative and trailblazing baby’ has matured to provide an invaluable service to Sri Lankans scattered across the country, there were the others who spoke of the humble and helpful persona that he was all the time.\n\n‘Human genetics’ was Prof. Jayasekara’s very own baby when Sri Lanka had not even imagined about its potential as the new frontier of medicine. He retired after more than four decades of service. “The legacy that Rohan leaves behind is his pioneering contribution to the development of the specialty of Medical Genetics in Sri Lanka. In 1983, upon his return from training in the United Kingdom, he founded the Human Genetics Unit which was one of the first units of its kind in the Asian region,” said Colombo University Vice Chancellor Prof. Lakshman Dissanayake.\n\nPointing out that thereafter for over one and a half decades Rohan single handedly promoted the specialty in the country, travelling to all corners of the island, he said that today the Human Genetics Unit has grown to be known as a centre of excellence on par with any in the developed world.\n\nProf. Dissanayake commended him as “a renowned academic, researcher, clinician and administrator par excellence”, with his forthright and no-nonsense approach whenever various complicated issues were deliberated. He also paid a tribute to him for grooming and mentoring the next generation in his department, thus ensuring continuity of the good work he had started.\n\nAdding her voice to the accolades, the Dean of the Colombo Medical Faculty, Prof. Jennifer Perera reiterated that Prof. Jayasekara’s “most outstanding” contribution to medicine has been in the field of human genetics which revolutionized the outlook on medical genetics in Sri Lanka.\n\n“He worked with dedication and commitment to ensure that medical genetics takes centre-stage in the prevention and management of genetically-inherited disorders. He was also instrumental in establishing the much-sought after Genetic Counselling Service at the Medical Faculty,” she added.\n\nReferring to his teaching abilities, Prof. Perera pointed out that Prof. Jayasekara made the complicated science of genetics very fascinating and simple to learners. He also made sure that the subject of Anatomy which is fundamental to understanding the mechanics of the human body was taught with adequate depth as application of this subject is vital to accurate diagnosis and management of patients.\n\nIn spite of the numerous advances in medical education, he strongly endorsed the need for the continuation of cadaveric dissections in the teaching and learning of Anatomy and ensured the sustainability of such facilities at the faculty, she said, adding that he also excelled as an administrator.\n\nIt was Prof. Vajira H.W. Dissanayake, who has followed closely in the footsteps of Prof. Jayasekara, who traced his guru’s life from birth to retirement and also went into detail about his major contributions.\n\nTitling his talk ‘The pioneer medical geneticist’, the current Director of the Human Genetics Unit and Professor in Anatomy, Prof. Dissanayake brought about laughter when he spoke of “naughty” Rohan who was admitted to St. Peter’s College, one year ahead of time because it was not easy to keep him at home!\n\nExcelling in his studies and qualifying to pursue medicine at the Peradeniya campus of the University of Ceylon at the tender age of 17, Rohan had declared that otherwise he would have been a pilot. Graduating in 1972, Prof. Dissanayake detailed how Rohan did his internship at the Ragama General Hospital, soon after following in the footsteps of his uncle, the late Professor M. J. Waas, by selecting a career in Anatomy. The Anatomy Department of the Colombo Medical Faculty was full of heavy-weights – the late Prof. Lester Jayawardena being the Chair, his young and upcoming successor, the late Prof. P.S.S. Panditharatne and Prof. Shanthi Goonawardena, Prof. Benitta Stephen and the late Dr. Subadra Satchithanandan all being on the staff.\n\nDr. Rohan Jayasekara had to carve out his own niche and his opportunity came in 1977 in the form of a Commonwealth Scholarship to read for a Ph.D in Human Genetics under the famous Prof. Derek Roberts at the Department of Human Genetics, University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England. By that time he was married to Varuni who is today the Principal of the Varuni Jayasekara Academy of Speech, Drama and Communication.\n\nIn lighter vein, Prof. Dissanayake quotes Prof. Jayasekara as saying that during his stay in England, besides his Ph.D certificate, he also received one from the Chief Constable of Northern England, the equivalent of Sri Lanka’s Inspector General of Police, because he helped them arrest a gang of car thieves.\n\nReturning to Sri Lanka in 1980, Prof. Jayasekara commenced his long journey in pioneering Medical Genetics, states Prof. Dissanayake, starting the unit with assistance from the World Health Organization (WHO). “The unit, one of the first of its kind in the Asian region, was formally opened with the approval of the Faculty Board in October 1983 with only his faithful laboratory assistant Sisira Perera by his side. Sisira continues to serve the unit up to date.”\n\nProf. Dissanayake stated: “Prof. Jayasekara single-handedly ran the unit for the next 15 years using the exposure he received through fellowships from the WHO and the United States Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates to strengthen the unit. These fellowships enabled him to travel and work in genetic centres in the United Kingdom, United States of America (USA), Australia, Hong Kong, Thailand, Indonesia and Singapore.\n\n“As an academic he introduced the teaching of Basic Medical Genetics and Clinical Genetics to the medial curriculum. He taught the subject not only at the Colombo Medical Faculty but also at Ragama and Galle. He was a popular lecturer and the book on ‘Basic Medical Genetics’ for medical students that he wrote in 1996 has been reprinted every year since then. It is popular not only among undergraduates but also postgraduates.\n\n“His contribution to postgraduate genetics education is unparalleled. He taught Medical Genetics to trainees in Surgery, Medicine, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Paediatrics, Family Medicine, Medical Administration, Sports Medicine, Transfusion Medicine, Haematology, Oncology and Radiotherapy, Molecular Medicine, Community Dentistry, Clinical Genetics, Genetic Diagnostics and Legal Medicine and Forensic Science. It is hard to find a specialist in Sri Lanka who has not been taught by him.\n\n“Therefore it was not surprising that he was able to rise up the academic ladder on merit at every occasion, becoming Associate Professor in 1991, Chair and Professor of Anatomy in 2000 and Senior Professor in 2008. Along the way he was also admitted as a Fellow of the Galton Institute London, Fellow of the Royal Society of Biology London and Honorary Fellow of the College of Surgeons of Sri Lanka.\n\n“As a researcher he pioneered the introduction of cytogenetics to the country. In 1983 the laboratory at the Human Genetics Unit became the first centre in the country to offer genetic testing. He spent many hours analyzing chromosomes and issuing reports to patients, as well as conducting research, in the background of very little financial support for basic science research in the country. The research programme in the unit flourished in the first decade of this century with the availability of funds leading to it becoming one of the best for basic science research in the field of medicine in the country.\n\n“As a clinician no one could match him for the hours that he spent with his patients and their families, counselling and helping them to understand the aetiology, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of the condition affecting them or their child. The parents loved him and when they decided to form a Parents’ Association for the Special Child he was the obvious choice to be their patron.\n\n“He had to be the go-between among patients and their doctors. This was a challenging task as the doctors had to get used to the new specialty of medical genetics. His first paper on the subject titled ‘Acceptance of genetic services: A Study of Physicians in Colombo, Sri Lanka’ in the Journal of Biosocial Sciences published by the Cambridge University Press in 1988 is an eye-opener about the challenges.\n\n“The last decade undoubtedly was the high point in his career. It is the decade in which all his hard work and perseverance paid off and he was able to build a team at the Human Genetics Unit that could carry forward his legacy. The unit flourished in terms of international recognition and today it is a part of the Global Genomics Medicine Collaborative convened by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Science of USA. It has a fully-fledged team of Clinical Geneticists, Cytogeneticists, Molecular Geneticists, Haematologists, Scientists, Bioinformaticians, Technicians and other staff. The unit has research groups including those in Clinical Genetics, Cytogenetics, Molecular Genetics, Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Biology, Bioinformatics and Synthetic Biology. These groups have generated over Rs. 350 million in grants and produced over 60 research papers and 220 conference abstracts.\n\n“The unit has trained the first team of clinical geneticists and scientists from Nepal and as a result the first-ever Medical Genetics Unit was set up in Kathmandu in 2015. The unit as well as its team has been recognized for their work with awards at international, national and university levels as well as at many international and local conferences. These developments can only be characterized as ‘rising like a phoenix from the ashes’ because one fateful day in July 2005 an electric short circuit caused a fire that engulfed it. To rise from such a catastrophe would only have been possible under the leadership of a person of the character and stature of Prof. Rohan W. Jayasekara – a man like no other.”\n\nOrganized by the Head and the Staff of the Department of Anatomy, Colombo Medical Faculty, the others who addressed the ‘Valedictory academic meeting’ included the Chairman of the University Grants Commission, Prof. Mohan de Silva, the Head of the Department of Anatomy, Colombo Medical Faculty, Dr. Ajith P. Malalasekera and Senior Lecturer Dr. M. Madhuwanthi Dissanayake and the Deputy Director of the Postgraduate Institute of Medicine, Prof. Senaka Rajapakse.\n\nBrief presentations showcased ‘Frontier research in genomics and regenerative medicine’ at the Human Genetics Unit.\n\nA portrait of Prof. Jayasekara was also unveiled, while a Felicitation Volume on his life and times compiled by Dr. Nirmala Sirisena was presented to him.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n~~This was written in 1994 by Indran's friend Kumaran, a few days after Indran passed away\n\nI met Dr. Indran Selvaratnam for the first time in January 1978, when I attended a Colts Cricket Club (California) meeting he had convened to plan that year's cricketing activities. There was a very poor turn up of club members. This being my first meeting I was very discouraged. He on the other hand, was not discouraged at all. He had many plans for the future of the club. Later I learnt that he had started the club singlehandedly in 1974 for the benefit of cricket enthusiasts from Sri Lanka living in Southern California. He had a tremendous passion for this game.\n\nIndran possessed a unique sense of drive and perseverence. It was this drive that made him succeed in this country. He had come to the United States as a young boy in his teens. With no one to either guide him or motivate him, he had set his own goal to become a physician. He achieved this by entering the Vandebilt School of Medicine.\n\nIt was the same drive and perseverance which made him go forward with the plans for the club. In order to continue to be a viable club he had to bring in new players. Colts became a truly cosmopolitan club having as captain a West Indian and players from Sri Lanka, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and East Africa. It went on to win the Williamson Trophy in 1979 and in 1987 and the C. Aubrey Trophy in 1982. Colts also won the Division I Fleming Trophy in 1980 and 1989. A very good record for a club which had some shaky years.\n\nAs years went by, I came to know Indran well. He was a successful doctor and had all the material well being one could dream of. He could have continued to enjoy this for many years. But he was a realist. He set his priorities right and ensured that his children received the best education in America and, in this respect his achievement was par excellence.\n\nIndran had an insatiable appetite for knowledge and a fervor for discussion which was almost infectious that it transformed those around him to be the same. His inner circle of friends, as he would put it, were very few. They would all meet frequently and enjoy a round of discussion on subjects dealing with worldly affairs. He did not have time for the trivia. Without him I could feel the void in such gatherings and it will never be the same again.\n\nOn numerous occasions Indran had talked about giving back to society what one received from it. He would always talk in praise of the generous philanthropists who have done so much for the sake of humanity. This was a reflection of his inner self. He always wanted to help others. It was in that spirit that he joined the SS \"Hope\" as a young doctor in 1963, to serve the needy in Sri Lanka.\n\nHe began to like the peace and quiet. It was noticeable that during the cricket season he would rather be at the Woodley Cricket Field than anywhere else. Many times I have observed that he would stay away from the crowd and watch the game alone, from under the shade of a tree. Only distraction being that treacherous cigarette which he would light quite frequently. This over indulgence in cigarettes brought about his illness and sadly, on May 28th, 1994, he succumbed to cancer.\n\nDuring his year and half long battle with cancer the club he formed began to fall apart. The 1994 season was a disaster. For the first time in the club's history it went down to the lower division. There was no hope for reviving it. Despite everyone losing all hope of keeping the club alive, we have had the good fortune of well wishers coming forward to rebuild the club. Thanks to Mervyn Fernando, Sri Sagadevan, Pujitha de Silva and Arvin Wijeyachandran, whose efforts have made it possible for Colts to continue as a team in 1995. I am sure that his workings are there behind the scenes and it will continue to be a vibrant team for many years to come. Fittingly, his passion for cricket was recently recognized by the Southern California Cricket Association when they named one of the division championship trophy a \"Doc Indran Sevaratnam Trophy\".\n\nHe is survived by his wife Therese and children Tanya and Troy. May his\n\natma rest in peace.\n\n_______________________________________________________________\n\nDr. Indran Selvaratnam was a student of St. Joseph's College, Colombo. In 1989, along with others, Indran was a founder of the Old Joes Association of California (OJAC), he was a Committee Member, with Manilal Fernando as the Founder President. OJAC ceased operation 15 years ago. OJAC is being revived this year with a Gala Dinner Dance at the De Luxe in Burbank, California on Friday July 17, 2015. A meeting will be held shortly to select a committee. The work that was done by Indran with OJAC, is being carried on by his wife Therese who has always given her support and encouragement to reviving the organization.\n\n_____________________________________________________\n\nWe Must Never Forget Our Pioneers !\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nAn Old Josephian, Niranjan Joseph De Silva Deva Aditya a.k.a. Nirj Deva is a pride to his alma mater. Please see below an interview conducted by Anusha David with the dynamic British politician! Editor, TSL\n\nAnusha David spotlights the hottest styles and statements in and around Sri Lanka – from political leaders to celebrity CEOs, masters of the game to fashion icons and stars of the silver screen and stage. Here are society’s leaders talking about the determination, vision, smarts, competence and professionalism. Today, she speaks to Niranjan Joseph De Silva Deva Aditya.\n\nNiranjan Joseph De Silva Deva Aditya FRSA DL (born 11 May 1948; commonly known as Nirj Deva) is a politician from the United Kingdom. A member of the Conservative Party, he has been a Member of the European Parliament representing South East England since 1999. He was previously a Member of Parliament (MP) in the British House of Commons from 1992 to 1997, representing the constituency of Brentford and Isleworth.\n\nDeva was born into a politically active Sri Lankan family, and was raised in Britain. He was only the fourth Asian-born person to be elected a Member of the House of Commons,and was the first Asian-born person to be elected as a Conservative member of the European Parliament. He spent his primary and secondary education at St. Joseph's College. He holds Sri Lankan and British citizenship. Deva was educated at Loughborough University, where he completed a degree in Aeronautical Engineering and was subsequently a Postgraduate Research Fellow in Economics.\n\nDeva's family has extensive business interests in Sri Lanka including tea, rubber and coconut plantations as well a distillery and residential property.\n\nDeva is married to Indra – a French-speaking Mauritian. They have one son.\n\nWhat is the extent of your political involvement in Sri Lanka?\n\nI have basically no political involvement at all in Sri Lanka. What I have done over the past several years is that I have supported and helped whoever has been elected through a proper electoral procedure as Prime Minister or President. I am a member of the European Parliament, a British MP. Had I not been of Sri Lankan extraction but been British that is exactly what I would have done to support a friendly country and to support the legitimately elected government. A lot of Sri Lankans are very divisive in the way they think. It's either your camp or somebody else’s camp and they have been very puzzled by the fact that I can help Presidents Jayawardene, Premadasa, Chandrika, Ranil, President Rajapakse and now Ranil again, but it's my duty to help whoever has been elected and that’s what I have been doing.\n\nAfter the result of the recent Presidential elections, what are the current perceptions of Sri Lanka within the European Parliament?\n\nA very substantial change in perception that the new government of Sri Lanka is more agreeable to reconciliation, rehabilitation and forgiveness, than the previous government. I have to say that the Rajapakse government went out of its way to rapidly rebuild the destroyed areas of the North and East and resettle people very efficiently.\n\nDo you see Sri Lanka’s relationship with the EU improving over the next decade?\n\nVery much so. Sri Lanka is the EU’s largest trading partner, we have a historic relationship with Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka has three European countries whose histories are inextricably bound with that of hers; Portugal, Holland and Britain. Those ties can't be undone and there is a huge level of sympathy, sentiment and goodwill between Sri Lanka and the EU.\n\nDo you think Sri Lanka needs to demonstrate substantive progress before its readmission to GSP+?\n\nAs a result of the programme that we have started with the new government, I am very confident that the 67 different steps that have to be taken before the EU will look at regranting GSP+ is under way but we will not grant GSP+ to a country that has been red flagged over the fishing business so it is a pre condition to getting GSP+ that we have a good fisheries policy in place and that we get the fishing ban lifted. It is only when the fishing ban is lifted that the application for GSP + can be extended.\n\nWith such a large number of interests across Sri Lanka’s business landscape, what do you think of the current government’s approach to the development of the private sector?\n\nI think the private sector was taken aback by the severity of the budget in relation to windfall profits. I don’t think the message was explained properly as to what these taxes were. In Britain we levied taxes on windfall profits because we felt that those profits were made excessively or from a monopolistic point of view and that competition was not in operation, and when that happens both the Labour party and the Conservative party have introduced a one time windfall tax. I presume that is what your Finance Minister was doing when he introduced these taxes on the commercial sector as a one time tax, and that is some sort of recognition that in the previous regime they had an undue advantage.\n\nYou are of Rajasthani descent – can you elaborate on this?\n\nYes, if you read the Mahavamsa, my first ancestor Thakura Artha Adittiya came here at the time when a General called Mitta had seized the Sri Lankan throne during the Polonnaruwa Yapahuwa period and killed Buwanaka Bahu the V. My ancestor whose sister was married to the king – she was from the Udaipur family in Rajasthan; he came and chopped off the head of Mitta (it's all described in the Mahavamsa) and put Buwanaka Bahu the VI back on the throne. After that, members of the family were made Mandalika Rajas of Ratnapura and other places and there is a story of how Addittiya Bandara who wrote a very evocative love poem called Siri Bara Kuda Malaya for Siri Mal Kuda Menike, his wife to be (and this is part of Sri Lankan poetry) was then living in an area called the Four Korales in Ran Kothu Vila, when they got a Maha Sanasa for a big chunk of land between Moratuwa and Panadura to protect the sea coast (they were a military family you see) from pirates.\n\nThe family then went on to meet the Portuguese in battle and lost and so the family tree goes through all these very ancient Sanskrit Sri Lankan names and then suddenly you see Pedro, and Ignatius and Deodartus and so on and that is because we had to convert to the Catholic faith and then when the Dutch came, we got persecuted for being Catholics and then we had the British to get rid of the Dutch and I think we prospered quite well thereon. One branch of the family were the De Soysas, Sir Charles de Soysa and Lady De Soysa, Jusey De Silva’s daughter, so I’m really De Silva De Soysa, however when my father was at Oxford – some old lady had asked him if he was a Portuguese coolie, decided he had had enough of this and went through our old baptism certificates and changed our name. He was born Kingsley De Silva and died Kingsley Deva Addittiya.\n\nHave you ever encountered any form of racism in your career? Judging by your performance it would seem not as last year you were re-elected for the fourth consecutive time with an increased share of the vote of 724,560 votes and being placed no. 2 on the list while your party in other regions of the country suffered a massive defeat at the hands of the newly-formed United Kingdom Independent Party which came first with the Conservative Party nationally trailing third behind the Labour Party which came second.\n\nIn my political career I must have shaken hands with over 2 million British people. At every election I go from house to house and the only form of racism I have encountered in my entire 30 odd years in British politics was when I was on the streets in Hammersmith, campaigning and an old lady came up to me and said why don’t I go back to the jungle from which I came? So I looked at her and said ‘Madam, 700,000 Indian, Pakistani and Sri Lankan soldiers died in two world wars so that you could tell me that in English rather than in German’! To which she screeched and ran away!\n\nYou have been called one of the greatest Parliamentarians in modern history. You have a very interesting story to tell; spanning a career where you worked with Prime Ministers Margaret Thatcher, John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and now David Cameron in the UK and Presidents Jayewardene, Premadasa, Wijetunga, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and President Mahinda Rajapaksa in Sri Lanka, as well as other European and world leaders. Could you tell our readers a few highlights of your very interesting career?\n\nWell I have been in politics for 45 years and in parliament for quite a long time. I was the first non white post colonial Conservative member of British parliament. I was the first Asian to be in government after the Second World War, post colonial in the British government in the Scottish office. Mr Keith Vaz came in after me. He was not in government. And I was then the first Asian born member of the European parliament. All this is a part of being there at the right time. In fact when I sat on the Conservative benches as the only brown face amongst all those white faces it was rather an odd feeling. Now we have eleven brown faces on the Conservative benches and one Cabinet minister! So I feel very proud of being a trail blazer, broke the glass ceiling so to speak. People would tell me ‘You are nuts. You are never going to be elected to the House of Commons’. People in Sri Lanka were laughing at me and saying you are completely mad! But it did happen. It wasn’t easy I had to go to 126 parilamentary meetings in 126 seats before I got my first seat in Hammersmith and then 48 interviews in 48 seats before I got Chiswick in Brentford Islesworth, who elected me to the British parliament. But I enjoyed it. Determination I suppose. The European parliament has been a very exciting development and it's been very satisfying to take money from rich people and give it to poor people.\n\nYou were awarded with the honorary title of Vishwa Keerthi Sri Lanka Abimani by Ven. Tallale Meththananda Thero, Chief Incumbent and Chief Adikarana Sanganayaka of the Saddharmakara Vidyaratne Privena, Pinwatta in Panadura. \"For the first time this title was presented by a group of Buddhist Bikkus to a non-Buddhist person in Sri Lanka,” said Ven. Meththananda thero after conferring the title on you. What led to this?\n\nI’m not sure but I think it was because of the work I did after the tsunami. We brought in about 400 million. We built homes, resettled people, gave them a livelihood; and I did it because that’s what I had to do and that’s what we do. But very kindly this group of Buddhist clergy recognized the work I had done and gave me this title.\n\nWhat are your views of the BBS and their ‘performance during the last regime?\n\nI think they tried to divide this country which is not a Buddhist thing to do at all. They are certainly not a part of civilized living. They are certainly not a part of the ancient and proud, tolerant, loving and caring Buddhist culture.\n\nIn 1985, you became the first Asian-born person to be appointed by Queen Elizabeth II to the office of Deputy Lieutenant for Greater London – a position which you hold for life. What led to this appointment?\n\nI don’t quite know. I was very young, normally Deputy Lieutenants are very senior 60, 70 year olds, who have retired from whatever they were doing, generally generals from the army, admirals from the navy, or chairmen of banks; generally big shots. I was a mere 34 when I received a letter saying they wanted to appoint me, so I became the youngest ever to represent the Queen.\n\nWhat is the most rewarding part of your job?\n\nKnowing that the money that we raise for international development actually goes to the people we want it to go to. We have some very satisfying results from the millennial development goals. We have almost eradicated malaria, polio, tuberculosis in certain parts of the world. We have fed millions and millions of people who would otherwise be dead. It's politics, where I am using the political will or the goodwill of the EU, especially David Cameron who ridfets 0.7 % of GNI for overseas development, even in a time of recession, so that poor people, dispossesed people, starving people are kept alive and fed. It's not enough though, so I’m thinking of new ways and I’m now getting the private sector involved in international development. I had a major conference on this in Brussels to see how private sector funds can be channelled and I have comes across astonishing companies where there’s 6 billion dollars of micro credits out there and their default rate is 1 %. And they are operating out of Switzerland. I have got all of them to agree to give $500 each to a group of women to give them a livelihood. Poultry or sewing, or catering, that way you are not just giving them a hand out but helping them stand on their own feet, create a business, possibly generate employment, it's very fulfilling.\n\nWhat’s the best compliment you ever received?\n\nThat my fish dish was the best ever! The recipe was my invention.\n\nWhat is your goal as a parent?\n\nLeave one's children to get on with it, not to interfere.\n\nWhat’s your most cherished family tradition?\n\nChrismas lunch and New Year's lunch. We all get together. It was started by my grandfather. 36 people sitting together and the Christmas pudding, burning the brandy, falling asleep afterwards; it's still something I do.\n\nWho were your heroes or role models when you were a child?\n\nThe adventurers like Sir Francis Drake, Captain Cooke, Livingston, the discoverers. Those who were either perceived to be mad and didn’t count the risks. In that sense I admire the British people. They have done things which most other nations haven’t. On the 15th of June we celebrate the Magna Carta and the MEP, which is the first time in human history that a king agreed to live by the same laws as his subjects. Never before and even today in the European parliament I am immune to arrest because the European model doesn’t have this. A President of a country is immune to arrest. But the Prime Minister of England or the Queen's children are not immune to arrest. Princess Anne for instance has been hauled up for speeding. In Britain no one is above the law.\n\nHow do you like to relax?\n\nReading, used to play tennis, used to go horse riding, used to go swimming. Don’t do any of that now though. I used to be quite fit when I was young. I’m totally unfit now.\n\nWhich single book has greatly influenced you, and why?\n\nGosh I must have read over a 100,000 books! The history of the Second World War by Churchill I guess or the life of Gladstone. He used to cut down 20 trees everyday and would walk 30 / 40 miles everyday. He lived to the age of 96. Ask me for a film, I could answer that better. I saw this film recently and I must have seen it at least 10 times, it's called ‘A 100 Foot Journey’. It's about an Indian family who have a little restaurant in England and they decide to pack up and go off to France. They break journey in this little village and they camp opposite this restaurant and start making their curries and chapattis and end up by getting a Michelin star! How this Indian family who couldn’t speak a word of English managed all this – it's amazing.\n\nInterviewed by Anusha David – Courtesy: LIFEonLINE\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
