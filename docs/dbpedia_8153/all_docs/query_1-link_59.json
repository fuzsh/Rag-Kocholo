        "text": "Special online discussions on ‘Dismantling Global Hindutva Conference – a false propaganda’\n\nAnti-Hindus have been calling Hindu Dharma inferior and defaming Hindus by making a mockery of the Hindu community for many years. Even now, a conspiracy is hatched with the help of mass media and few people from the education field; but Hindus seem to be indifferent towards the same. It should be noted that Hindu culture and traditions are the most ancient and have survived the test of time. Hindus should now take a clear stand at thought level and be firm about their Dharma, stated Maria Wirth, a famous writer and a blogger from Germany while participating in the special discussions program held by Hindu Janajagruti Samiti (HJS) on the topic of ‘Dismantling Global Hindutva Conference- a false propaganda’.\n\nMr. M Satchithanandan, the founder of ‘Shiva Senai’, Sri Lanka said that Hindu Dharma has given many things to the world for the benefit of all beings. Eradicating Hindutva means destroying moral, cultural, family, political, historical, and geographical values. It is like the destruction of holy scriptures like ‘Geeta’ and ‘Chanakya-neeti’. True Hindus will never accept whatever the organisers of such anti-Hindu conferences would say. Moreover, the organisers will not accomplish their goal and fail like Duryodhan and Ravana and Hindutva will go smoothly on its path, is our firm belief.\n\nMrs Meenakshi Sharan, a historian, said that the British attacked the Sanskrit language and Sanskrit universities. They interfered with India’s history and caused a major loss for India. ‘Dismantling Global Hindutva’ conference is not the first conference of its kind for defaming Hindu Dharma; even earlier, conferences were held in different countries for a similar purpose. The persons might have changed as per the times but the agenda of false propaganda against Hindu Dharma is carried on even now. Hindus must strongly oppose it."
