This was around 2004. Since then more than two thousand books have been added to this site...\n\nI also have a compilations of my poetry book collection - a list of Poetry Anthologies, with a \"top ten\" list covering all genres, and sublists for Indian poetry, World poetry, British/American poetry, Humour and Children's poetry (81 of them, all told). The following is a sort of blog - a chronological record of new entries... The index master-09.html has an older (pre-2009) list of book excerpts which are topic-indexed. Sometimes people ask me about copyright, since many books are _extensively_ excerpted. Where the excerpts are so extensive, they are almost all from various sources on the web. I am not sure that the presence of excerpts on the web justifies this concatenation at a single site, but if anyone objects, I will be happy to replace the texts with their links. The problem is that in the ten years that this site has been up, hundreds of links have died or moved...\n\nRecently added\n\nThe case of the missing servant by Tarquin Hall (2009)\n\nThe residents of number 76, D Block, the house that Puri was watching, retained the services of no fewer than seven full-time people â two drivers, a cook, a cleaner-cum-laundry-maid, a bearer and two security guards.... ...\n\nThe Literary History of England: Vol 1: The Middle Ages by Albert C.

You do not expect much vigour or energy in a people speaking such a language... p.3\n\n[Though this sounds almost racist in today's postcolonial world, I am a great admirer of Jespersen, I use this quote only to show the colourful nature of his narrative...] ...\n\nThe Spring Thunder and After: A Survey of the Maoist and Ultra-leftist Movements in India, 1962-75 by Asish Kumar Roy (1975)\n\nThe failure of the urban proletariat to bring about an \"intertwined\" socialist revolution through a series of lightning strikes, together with the successful operation of the Telengana peasant revolt under the leadership the Andhra Communists since 1946, brought about a Maoist turn in the CPI leadership in 1952. ...\n\nThe man who mistook his wife for a hat and other clinical tales by Oliver W. Sacks (1987)\n\nHe had found \"someoneâs leg\" in the bed â a severed human leg, a horrible thing!

He was much relieved at the explanation; but feeling that a joke was a joke, and that this one was a bit much, he threw the damn thing out of the bed. But â and at this point his conversational manner deserted him, and he suddenly trembled and became ashenpaleâ when he threw it out of bed, he somehow came after it â and now it was attached to him. ...\n\nEveryone here spoke sign language by Nora Ellen Groce (1985)\n\nEbenezar and Thankful Hamblin, both hearing.

Richards (1993)\n\nWithin the tent an initial embrace of greeting between the two principals abruptly became a mortal struggle in which Afzal Khan tried to strangle [the much shorter] Shivaji.

Kushner (1981)\n\nWhy do terrible things happen to people who have been pious? How can religion justify a God who wills such disasters upon the faithful?

(1971)\n\nthe Panjab was still in many ways a Sleepy Hollow where life moved at the pace of the feeble cab-horses drawing their two-wheeled tongas; where young men could indulge in old carefree idle ways, with long hours of debate in coffee-houses and moonlight picnics by the river Ravi.
