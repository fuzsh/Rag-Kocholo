        "text": "Two senior leaders of a party that represents Sri Lanka's ruling coalition have accused Mahinda Rajapaksa administration of misleading the international community to wage war against the LTTE.\n\nR Yogarajan, National Organiser of Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC) said the government pretended to find a solution for the national question through an all party committee to get international support for the war.\n\n\"This government will never offer a political solution for the Tamil people in the north and east. Although the war is over, there will never be a political solution for the national question,\" he told journalists in Colombo.\n\nMr. Yogarajan and CWC vice president M Satchithanandan announced their resignation from the party ranks to support the candidacy of Gen Sarath Fonseka on Wednesday.\n\nMinister resigned\n\nMr. Satchithanandan has also resigned from the post of deputy education minister.\n\nBoth former CWC leaders have joined the main opposition United National Party (UNP).\n\nMr. Yogarajan also accused the government of sabotaging devolution of power by interfering in eastern provincial council's affairs.\n\nThe CWC, a trade union that represents hundreds of thousands of Tamils of Indian origin in Central Sri Lanka, is led by Minister Arumugam Thondaman.\n\nBut the both defectors now claim that the many Tamils of Indian origin no longer accept Mr. Thondaman's leadership.\n\n\"Our people, Tamils of Indian origin, are no longer with the government,\" Mr. Yogarajan claimed.\n\nThe results of recent provincial council elections have clearly shown that the party has lost the support, he claimed, adding that more leaders of the CWC will soon leave the party.\n\nIndian Tamils consist of over five percent of Sri Lankaâ€™s population, according to latest government statistics."
