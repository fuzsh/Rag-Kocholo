Spain's aviation industry dates back to 1923 when José Ortiz-Echagüe founded Construcciones Aeronáuticas, SA. The company, known by the initials CASA, went on to design and manufacture aircraft and become a pioneering presence in European aviation cooperation. Having worked successfully on earlier Airbus projects, CASA became part of Airbus in 2000.

Today, Airbus is the leader of Spain’s aerospace and defence sector, generating 56.4% of the nation’s revenues in these areas through the work of some 12,700 employees. Production facilities for Airbus commercial aircraft, military aircraft, helicopters, and space activities can be found within the country.
