Construcciones/Aeronauticas SA (CASA) purchases KTI's software tool to become a knowledge-based organisation (KBO)

Keyword: KTI

Knowledge Technologies International (KTI) announced the sale to Spain's Construcciones Aeronauticas SA (CASA) of Knowledge-Based software and consultancy to align its design processes with its Airbus partners: British Aerospace (BAe), France's Aerospatiale, and Germany's DASA. Airbus suppliers such as Rolls-Royce, Latecoere and Pratt & Whitney also use KTI's advanced The KBO EnvironmentTM and The ICADÂ£#174;P> System to bring optimised products to market in significantly reduced timescales.

The KBO Environment with ICAD built-in allows engineers to capture and deploy human knowledge to create optimised designs by specifying function. It brings the "best ever team" of experts to any task freeing engineers and designers to be creative. With knowledge-based engineering the only design rules are the laws of physics, the logistical constraints and corporate design heuristics.
