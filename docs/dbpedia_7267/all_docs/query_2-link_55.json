        "text": "The Airbus A400M Atlas is a multi-national four-engine turboprop military transport aircraft. It was designed by Airbus Military as a tactical airlifter with strategic capabilities to replace older transport aircraft, such as the Transall C-160 and the Lockheed Martin C-130 Hercules. The A400M can perform mission roles other than transportation, including electronic surveillance and aerial refuelling. The A400M's maiden flight, originally planned for 2008, took place on 11 December 2009 from Seville, Spain. Between 2009-2010, the A400M faced cancellation as a result of development program delays and cost overruns; however, the customer nations chose to maintain their support of the project. A total of 174 A400M aircraft have been ordered by eight nations as of July 2011. In March 2013, the A400M received European Aviation Safety Agency certification. The first aircraft was delivered to the French Air Force in August 2013.\n\nThe CASA 2.111 was a medium bomber derived from the Heinkel He 111 and produced in Spain under licence by Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA. The 2.111 models differed significantly in details from Heinkel's wartime He 111H design while using essentially the same exact airframe in appearance, featuring heavier armament and eventually Rolls-Royce Merlin engines.\n\nThe CASA C-101 Aviojet is a low-wing single engine jet-powered advanced trainer and light attack aircraft. It remains in service in the Spanish Air Force and some other countries; it is also flown by the Patrulla Aguila aerobatics team. It was designed to replace the already outdated Hispano Saeta. Spanish aircraft maker CASA began work on the C-101 in 1975. Germany's MBB and the USA's Northrop helped with the development, and the first four prototypes flew in June 1977. The design followed that of other jet trainers such as the BAE Hawk and the Alpha Jet, but was less aerodynamically sophisticated, with an unswept wing, and it had limited weapons capability.\n\nThe CASA C-202 Halcón was a twin-engine transport aircraft, constructed by CASA. The Halcón was designed for use on Spain's international air routes. It had tricycle landing gear and a heated/air-conditioned cabin which could accommodate fourteen passengers. Twenty aircraft were initially ordered, and delivered to the Spanish Air Force with the designation T.6."
