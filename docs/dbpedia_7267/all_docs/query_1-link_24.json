        "text": "Today we celebrate the 100th anniversary of Construcciones Aeronáuticas, S.A. (CASA). Since its inception in 1923, CASA has played a key role in shaping the Spanish aerospace industry and became part of Airbus in 1971. This milestone is the opportunity to honor our Spanish heritage and the colleagues who have driven Spain's aerospace and defense sector forward by designing and producing military aircraft and scientific satellites, and manufacturing essential components for Airbus' commercial aircraft and helicopters. As we look to the future, #TeamAirbus in Spain will continue to push the boundaries of what is possible, to innovate, and to inspire the next generation of Spanish aerospace leaders as we work on pioneering a more sustainable, safer and united world.
