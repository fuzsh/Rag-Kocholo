        "text": "Spanish company Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA, commonly known as CASA, was a significant player in aviation. José Ortiz-Echagüe, an accomplished Spanish engineer and pilot, founded CASA in 1923 as a state-owned aircraft construction company. The company was based in Madrid and was known for its innovative design and construction of aircraft in Spain.\n\nIn its early years, especially in the 1920s and 30s, CASA built various early model aircraft under license agreements with international corporations. However, with the outbreak of World War II, the company shifted its focus to military aviation. During this period, CASA produced such famous aircraft as the CASA 2.111 bomber, specifically for the Spanish Air Force.\n\nAfter the end of the war, CASA’s orientation changed again, and the company began to focus more on civil aviation. The company began producing regional airliners and cargo aircraft, making a significant contribution to the development of civilian air transportation. Some of the company’s most famous designs include the CASA DC series, the CASA C-212 Aviocar, and the CASA CN-235 regional airliners.\n\nNot limited to building entire airplanes, CASA has demonstrated its versatility by manufacturing parts and assemblies for industry giants such as Airbus, Lockheed, and Boeing. This demonstrated its technical prowess and broad capabilities in the aviation industry.\n\nHowever, by 1999, CASA had fully integrated with Airbus, leading to the gradual abandonment of the historic CASA brand. At its zenith, CASA had more than 11,000 employees working in various plants and offices throughout Spain.\n\nDuring its rich 86-year history, CASA produced around 500 airplanes before joining Airbus in 2009. This marked the end of CASA’s existence as an independent brand and was a testament to its contribution to the world’s aviation powerhouse."
