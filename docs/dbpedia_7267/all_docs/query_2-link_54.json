        "text": "DALLAS â Today in Aviation, the twin-engine medium-range regional airliner and transport aircraft CN-235 took to the skies for the first time in 1983. After testing, the aircraft was certified in 1986 and entered service on March 1, 1988.\n\nThe aircraft was a joint venture between the Spanish manufacturer Construcciones AeronÃ¡uticas SA (or CASA for short) and the Indonesian plane maker IPTN. Both parties subsequently formed Airtech International to oversee the program.\n\nHowever, this partnership only covered series 10 and 100/110, with subsequent variants developed individually.\n\nCivilian Use\n\nAlthough the CN-235 was initially developed for a military role, it did enjoy some limited success as a passenger airliner. Iberia (IB), the national airline of Spain, placed an order for a total of nine aircraft to be used by its subsidiaries, Binter Canarias (NT) and Binter Mediterraneo (AX). These aircraft were in service with the carriers from 1989 until they were eventually replaced by the ATR-72 in 1997.\n\nOther notable passenger carriers that used the type included the Argentinian carrier Austral Lines AÃ©reas (based in Cordoba), its subsidiary, Inter Austral (AU), and Merpati Nusantara Airlines (MZ) of Indonesia. The latter was the largest civilian operator of the type and, at one time, had 15 in its fleet\n\nHowever, it was in its military role that the CN-235 found the most success. The type has been used as a surveillance aircraft, a personnel transport, and for maritime patrol. The biggest user of the type is Turkey, which utilizes 59 CN-235s within its Army, Air Force, and Navy."
