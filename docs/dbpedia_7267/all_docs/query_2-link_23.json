(CASA) Model CN-235 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain CASA Model CN-235 series airplanes, that requires modification of the forward beam of the vertical stabilizer by the installation of a structural reinforcement plate. This amendment is prompted by issuance of mandatory continuing airworthiness information by a foreign civil airworthiness authority. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent in-flight structural deformation or failure of the vertical stabilizer, resulting in reduced controllability of the airplane. DATES: Effective July 20, 1998. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of July 20, 1998. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Construcciones Aeronauticas, S.A., Getafe, Madrid, Spain. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), [[Page 32606]] Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Norman B. Martenson, Manager, International Branch, ANM-116, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055-4056; telephone (425) 227-2110; fax (425) 227-1149. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain CASA Model CN-235 series airplanes was published in the Federal Register on April 14, 1998 (63 FR 18163). That action proposed to require modification of the forward beam of the vertical stabilizer by the installation of a structural reinforcement plate. Comments Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments were submitted in response to the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. Conclusion The FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. Cost Impact The FAA estimates that 2 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD. It will take approximately 30 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required modification, at an average labor rate of $60 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $180 per airplane. Based on these figures, the cost impact of the modification required by this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $3,960, or $1,980 per airplane. The cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. Regulatory Impact The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by reference, Safety. Adoption of the Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39--AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. 106(g), 40113, 44701. Sec. 39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: 98-12-34 Construcciones Aeronauticas, S.A. (CASA): Amendment 39- 10587. Docket 98-NM-85-AD. Applicability: Model CN-235 series airplanes, as listed in CASA Service Bulletin SB-235-55-04, dated May 30, 1995; and Model CN-235 having serial number (S/N) C-011; certificated in any category. Note 1: This AD applies to each airplane identified in the preceding applicability provision, regardless of whether it has been modified, altered, or repaired in the area subject to the requirements of this AD. For airplanes that have been modified, altered, or repaired so that the performance of the requirements of this AD is affected, the owner/operator must request approval for an alternative method of compliance in accordance with paragraph (b) of this AD. The request should include an assessment of the effect of the modification, alteration, or repair on the unsafe condition addressed by this AD; and, if the unsafe condition has not been eliminated, the request should include specific proposed actions to address it. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent in-flight structural deformation or failure of the vertical stabilizer, resulting in reduced controllability of the airplane, accomplish the following: (a) Within 6 months after the effective date of this AD, install a structural reinforcement plate on the forward beam of the vertical stabilizer, in accordance with CASA Service Bulletin SB-235-55-04, dated May 30, 1995. (b) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, International Branch, ANM-116, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, International Branch, ANM-116. Note 2: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the International Branch, ANM-116. (c) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. (d) The installation shall be done in accordance with CASA Service Bulletin SB-235-55-04, dated May 30, 1995. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.

Copies may be inspected at the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. Note 3: The subject of this AD is addressed in Spanish airworthiness directive 08/96, dated December 9, 1996. (e) This amendment becomes effective on July 20, 1998. Issued in Renton, Washington, on June 5, 1998. Darrell M. Pederson, Acting Manager, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
