        "text": "Turboprop-powered cargo aircraft\n\nC-212 Aviocar A C-212 of the National Institute for Aerospace Technology Role Medium STOL military transport aircraft\n\nType of aircraft\n\nManufacturer Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA\n\nEADS CASA\n\nIndonesian Aerospace First flight 26 March 1971 Introduction May 1974 Status In production in Indonesia Primary users Indonesia (70)\n\nUnited States (37)\n\nSpain (26)[1] Produced 1971–2012 Number built 485[2] + >100 (IPTN) Developed into Indonesian Aerospace N-219\n\nThe CASA C-212 Aviocar is a turboprop-powered STOL medium cargo aircraft designed and built by the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA (CASA). It is designed for use by both civil and military operators.\n\nThe C-212 was developed during the 1960s in response to the Spanish Air Force's need to replace much of its transport aircraft fleet and was designed to perform numerous roles, including ambulance aircraft, paratroop carrier, and utility transport. The first prototype made its maiden flight on 26 March 1971, and an order was secured from the Spanish Air Force three years thereafter. Several other customers emerged, initially from the military sector but, due to the interest of civilian airliners, CASA developed a dedicated civil version of the C-212 as well. Production of the type at the Seville facility would continue for 40 years, with 485 aircraft produced.[2]\n\nIndonesia emerged as a key early customer for the C-212. During 1975, the Indonesian aircraft company IPTN successfully secured the rights to license-produce the aircraft in Bandung, Indonesia. CASA assisted the establishment of a production line there that, by 2000, had constructed a total of 95 NC-212s. The majority of Indonesian-built aircraft were sold to domestic customers, although some exports were also recorded in the Asian market. During February 2013, it was announced that Airbus (the successor company to CASA) had agreed terms with PTDI (IPTN's successor) to fully transfer production of the C-212 to Indonesia. For a time, PTDI produced both the NC-212-200 and the -400 upgrade, which were equipped with new digital avionics and autopilot, and featured a redesigned cabin that could accommodate up to 28 passengers.\n\nBy December 2012, there were 92 operators of the C-212 around the world.[3] These operators included numerous charter and short-haul aviation companies as well as various national air services, which commonly used as a transport, surveillance aircraft, and for search and rescue.[4] The C-212 has been a popular aircraft among skydivers and smokejumpers due to its uncommon rear ramp arrangement amongst its competitors. In particular, the Australian airline Skytraders has used a number of C-212s to support Australian scientific research teams across Antarctica and the Southern Ocean.\n\nDevelopment\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the late 1960s, the Spanish Air Force was operating a number of outdated piston-engined transports, including the three-engined Junkers Ju 52 and two-engined Douglas C-47. Seeking to fulfil the Spanish Air Force's needs to modernise its transport force, the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA (CASA) developed a proposed aircraft, designated C-212. This was a twin-engined 18-seat transport aircraft that would be capable of performing in a variety of military roles, including passenger transport, ambulance aircraft and paratroop carrier, while also being suitable for use by civil operators.[5] On 26 March 1971, the first prototype conducted its maiden flight. During 1974, the Spanish Air Force decided to purchase the C-212, which had acquired the name Aviocar, in order to update its fleet.\n\nSeveral airlines expressed interest in the type, particularly in light of its success with military operators, thus CASA decided to pursue development of a dedicated commercial version of the C-212. During July 1975, the first examples of which was delivered. During 1997, the improved -400 model was introduced, featuring a glass cockpit and more powerful Honeywell TPE331 engines.[3] By August 2006, a total of 30 CASA-built C-212s of all variants reportedly remained in airline service with various operators around the world.[6]\n\nDuring July 2010, Domingo Urena-Raso, CEO of Airbus Military, stated that the company could no longer afford to produce the C-212 in Europe.[7][8] Production of the type at Airbus' Seville facility was progressively slowed to only four aircraft in two years.[3] During December 2012, the final Spanish-assembled C-212 was delivered to its customer, the Vietnam Coast Guard. By the time of the line's shutdown, 477 aircraft had been produced for 92 operators.[3]\n\nIndonesian production\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring 1975, the Indonesian aircraft company IPTN successfully negotiated terms with CASA to produce up to 108 C-212s under license in Indonesia.[9] Accordingly, IPTN and Nurtanio became involved in the manufacturing of their own C-212s, with assembly performed at IPTN's facility in Bandung, Indonesia.[3] CASA provided technical assistance in establishing their production line, sending a delegation of technicians to Bandung to train local personnel; the relative simplicity of the C-212 design was credited with aiding the process.[9]\n\nUnder the terms of the license, IPTN was permitted to sell the aircraft throughout the Asian market.[9] Despite this, the majority of Indonesian-made NC-212s were sold to domestic customers; by 1986, only six aircraft had reportedly been exported. By 2000, a total of 95 NC-212s had been completed.[9] By this point, production of the type had become a secondary priority to other ventures, such as the larger CASA/IPTN CN-235.[10] IPTN also undertook development of more advanced versions of the aircraft.[11] Between 2004 and 2008, all of the jigs and fixtures necessary to produce the NC212-400 were supplied by Airbus and installed at Bandung, enabling Indonesia to become the single-source manufacturer of this model.[3][12] The licensing agreement was extended in 2006.[13]\n\nDuring July 2011, Airbus announced an agreement to strategically collaborate with PTDI (IPTN's successor) on the C-212.[7][14] Under the terms of this agreement, Airbus undertook an 18-month first phase of support to PTDI, after which it stated it would provide PTDI an increasing high-value industrial activity, including C-212 upgrades and production transference. In February 2013, the arrangement between the two companies was formally extended to transfer production of the C-212 to Indonesia.[3][15] For a time, PTDI produced both the NC-212-200 and the -400 upgrade, which were equipped with new digital avionics and autopilot, and featured a redesigned cabin that could accommodate up to 28 passengers.[3] During 2014, PTDI stopped producing the -400 series in favour of focusing on the improved NC-212i model.[12]\n\nDesign\n\n[edit]\n\nThe CASA C-212 Aviocar is a turboprop-powered STOL-capable cargo aircraft. In terms of its basic configuration, it has a high-mounted wing, a boxy fuselage, and a conventional tail. The C-212 has been designed to operate in austere environments for extended periods without ground support apparatus.[16] Features such as its STOL performance and rugged landing gear fitted with low-pressure tyres enables it to operate from unpaved fields and under hot-and-high conditions.[16] For greater simplicity, the aircraft's tricycle undercarriage is non-retractable.\n\nDependent on configuration, the cabin of the C-212 has a maximum occupancy of between 21 and 28 passengers. In a paratroop configuration, up to 24 paratroopers along with one jumpmaster can be accommodated on foldable sidewall seats, while in a mixed configuration, up to ten soldiers and a single vehicle can be transported.[16] Since the C-212 does not have a pressurized fuselage, it is limited to relatively low-flight-level airline usage (below 10,000 ft (3,000 m) MSL), and is thus orientated for operations performing short legs and regional airline services.\n\nOperational history\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring 2013, it was reported that 290 C-212s were flying in 40 countries; Indonesia was the country with the most aircraft of the type, operating 70.[17] It has seen especially wide employment as a commuter airliner and a military aircraft, with its operators including numerous charter and short-haul aviation companies and several national air forces. The C-212 is commonly used as a transport, surveillance aircraft, and for search and rescue.[4]\n\nThe C-212 has also been in the service of the United States Army Special Operations Command, where it is operated under the designation C-41A and is commonly used for operations such as troop infiltration and exfiltration, supply drops, and airborne operations.[18] During August 2010, Airbus Military received a contract for the sustainment and modernisation of five C-212-200s operated by the US Army Special Operations Aviation Command (USASOAC).[16] Additional aircraft were both owned and operated by the private military contractor Blackwater; these were active during both the Iraq War and the War in Afghanistan, typically to conduct supply drops to US ground forces active in remote areas of these countries. During the conflict, the planes were piloted by former pilots from 160th \"Night Stalkers\" Special Operations Regiment.[19]\n\nOne particularly ambitious use of the C-212 was undertaken by the Australian airline Skytraders, which has used its fleet to support Australia’s scientific research assets across Antarctica and the Southern Ocean.[4] Various operators have elected to operate their aircraft amongst inhospitable terrain, such as desert and jungles.[16] On account of its uncommon rear ramp arrangement, the C-212 has a unique selling point amongst its competitors;[7] thus, it became a popular aircraft among skydivers and smokejumpers.[20][21]\n\nVariants\n\n[edit]\n\nSeries 100\n\n[edit]\n\nC-212A\n\nOriginal military production version.
