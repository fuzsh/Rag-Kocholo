(Formerly Known as Construcciones Aeronauticas, S.A.) Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SUMMARY: The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-02- 18, which applied to all Airbus Defense and Space S.A. Model CN-235, CN-235-100, CN-235-200, and CN-235-300 airplanes and Model C-295 airplanes. AD 2021-02-18 required [[Page 249]] repetitive inspections for cracking or broken rivets of certain left- and right-hand stringers and surrounding structure, and repair if necessary. This AD was prompted by a modification that was developed to reinforce the structure in the affected area, providing terminating action for the repetitive inspections required by AD 2021-02-18. This AD continues to require certain actions in AD 2021-02-18 and requires the new terminating action for the repetitive inspections, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products. DATES: This AD is effective February 7, 2024. The Director of the Federal Register approved the incorporation by reference of a certain publication listed in this AD as of February 7, 2024. ADDRESSES: AD Docket: You may examine the AD docket at regulations.gov under Docket No. FAA-2023-1999; or in person at Docket Operations between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The AD docket contains this final rule, the mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI), any comments received, and other information. The address for Docket Operations is U.S. Department of Transportation, Docket Operations, M-30, West Building Ground Floor, Room W12-140, 1200 New Jersey Avenue SE, Washington, DC 20590.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The FAA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to amend 14 CFR part 39 to supersede AD 2021-02-18, Amendment 39-21401 (86 FR 10740, February 23, 2021) (AD 2021-02-18) (which corresponds to EASA AD 2020-0159). AD 2021-02-18 applied to all Airbus Defense and Space S.A. Model CN-235, CN-235-100, CN-235-200, and CN-235-300 airplanes and Model C-295 airplanes. AD 2021-02-18 required repetitive inspections for cracking or broken rivets of certain left- and right-hand stringers and surrounding structure, and repair if necessary. The FAA issued AD 2021-02-18 to address such cracking in the stringers, which could result in reduced structural integrity of the airplane. FAA AD 2021-02- 18 explained that the requirements were ``interim action,'' and further rulemaking was being considered. The FAA has now determined that further rulemaking is necessary, and this AD follows from that determination. The NPRM published in the Federal Register on October 18, 2023 (88 FR 71778). The NPRM was prompted by AD 2023-0103, dated May 23, 2023, issued by EASA, which is the Technical Agent for the Member States of the European Union (EASA AD 2023-0103) (also referred to as the MCAI). The MCAI states that since EASA AD 2020-0159 was issued, a modification was developed to reinforce the structure in the affected area, which is a terminating action for the repetitive inspections required by EASA AD 2020-0159. The MCAI does not include Model CN-235-100 airplanes since a determination was made that the only remaining airplanes in service are operated by a government military service. The FAA has determined that since these models remain on the FAA type certificate data sheet, AD action is necessary to address the unsafe condition. Therefore, this AD includes this model in the AD applicability and provides corrective actions to address the unsafe condition. In the NPRM, the FAA proposed to continue certain actions in EASA AD 2020-0159. The NPRM also proposed to require the new terminating action for the repetitive inspections, as specified in EASA AD 2023- 0103. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products. You may examine the MCAI in the AD docket at regulations.gov under Docket No. FAA-2023-1999. Discussion of Final Airworthiness Directive Comments The FAA received no comments on the NPRM or on the determination of the cost to the public. Conclusion This product has been approved by the aviation authority of another country and is approved for operation in the United States. Pursuant to the FAA's bilateral agreement with this State of Design Authority, it has notified the FAA of the unsafe condition described in the MCAI referenced above. The FAA reviewed the relevant data and determined that air safety requires adopting this AD as proposed. Accordingly, the FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on this product. Except for minor editorial changes, this AD is adopted as proposed in the NPRM. None of the changes will increase the economic burden on any operator. Related Service Information Under 1 CFR Part 51 EASA AD 2023-0103 specifies procedures for detailed visual (DET) or high frequency eddy current inspections of the stringer P0a and P0a' at the riveted line of the attachment to the gusset and along the stringer head, in particular at the area of the last attachment of the gusset to the stringer in the midpoint between FR43 and FR44, DET inspections for fatigue cracks of the fuselage skin, along the stringers' footprint and surrounding structure and the attachment of the gusset to the FR43; DET inspections for fatigue cracks of the actuator bracket on FR43, along the radius of the vertical nerves, inner lug holes, and attachment holes of the bracket to FR43; DET inspections for fatigue cracks or broken rivets in the web and joint clips to skin and stringer of both sides of the frame between stringer P1d and P1d' (two stringers for each side from the central stringer P0a); DET inspections for fatigue cracks or broken rivets of the gussets, along the flange which joins FR43; and repair of any cracking or broken rivets. EASA AD 2023-0103 also specifies procedures for modifying structures between frames FR43 and FR44, on stringers STGR0A and STGR0A': Replacing supports, formers, installing fittings, radius guards, and hardware attachments. This material is reasonably available because the interested parties have access to it through their normal course of business or by the means identified in the ADDRESSES section. [[Page 250]] Costs of Compliance The FAA estimates that this AD affects 10 airplanes of U.S. registry. The FAA estimates the following costs to comply with this AD: Estimated Costs for Required Actions ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Labor cost Parts cost Cost per product Cost on U.S. operators ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Up to 17 work-hours x $85 per hour = Up to $14,002.......... Up to $15,447.......... Up to $154,470. Up to $1,445. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The FAA has received no definitive data on which to base the cost estimates for the on-condition actions specified in this AD. Authority for This Rulemaking Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs, describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority. The FAA is issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements. Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action. Regulatory Findings This AD will not have federalism implications under Executive Order 13132. This AD will not have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this AD: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866, (2) Will not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska, and (3) Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by reference, Safety. The Amendment Accordingly, under the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the FAA amends 14 CFR part 39 as follows: PART 39--AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 0 1.
