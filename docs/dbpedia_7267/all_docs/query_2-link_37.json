(CASA) Model CN-235 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain CASA Model CN-235 series airplanes, that requires replacement of the guide hooks of the cargo doors with new, improved guide hooks. This amendment is prompted by fatigue cracking found in the guide hooks of the cargo door. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent such fatigue cracking, which could result in reduced structural integrity of the cargo door and, consequently, lead to rapid decompression of the airplane. DATES: Effective June 16, 1997. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of June 16, 1997. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Construcciones Aeronauticas, S.A., [[Page 25835]] Getafe, Madrid, Spain. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Greg Dunn, Aerospace Engineer, Standardization Branch, ANM-113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055-4056; telephone (425) 227-2799; fax (425) 227-1149. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain CASA Model CN-235 series airplanes was published in the Federal Register on February 19, 1997 (62 FR 7382). That action proposed to require replacement of the guide hooks of the cargo doors with new, improved guide hooks. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments were submitted in response to the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. Conclusion The FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. Cost Impact The FAA estimates that 1 airplane of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 150 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $6,100 per airplane. Based on these figures, the cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $15,100 per airplane. The cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. Regulatory Impact The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by reference, Safety. Adoption of the Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39--AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. 106(g), 40113, 44701. Sec. 39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: 97-10-08 Construcciones Aeronauticas, S.A., CASA: Amendment 39- 10020. Docket 96-NM-138-AD. Applicability: Model CN-235 series airplanes, as listed in CASA Service Bulletin SB-235-52-23, Revision 2, dated June 9, 1994, and CASA Service Bulletin SB-235-52-23M, dated March 17, 1994; certificated in any category. Note 1: This AD applies to each airplane identified in the preceding applicability provision, regardless of whether it has been otherwise modified, altered, or repaired in the area subject to the requirements of this AD. For airplanes that have been modified, altered, or repaired so that the performance of the requirements of this AD is affected, the owner/operator must request approval for an alternative method of compliance in accordance with paragraph (b) of this AD. The request should include an assessment of the effect of the modification, alteration, or repair on the unsafe condition addressed by this AD; and, if the unsafe condition has not been eliminated, the request should include specific proposed actions to address it. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent fatigue-related cracking in the guide hooks of the cargo door, which could result in reduced structural integrity of the cargo door and, consequently, lead to rapid decompression of the airplane, accomplish the following: (a) Replace the guide hooks of the cargo doors with new, improved guide hooks, in accordance with CASA Service Bulletin SB- 235-52-23, Revision 2, dated June 9, 1994, or CASA Service Bulletin SB-235-52-23M, dated March 17, 1994; at the time specified in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this AD, as applicable. Note 2: Replacements accomplished prior to the effective date of this AD in accordance with CASA Service Bulletin SB-235-52-23, dated June 16, 1993, or Revision 1, dated April 13, 1994, are considered acceptable for compliance with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this AD. (1) For airplanes listed in CASA Service Bulletin SB-235-52-23: Replace prior to the accumulation of 17,000 total landings. (2) For airplanes listed in CASA Service Bulletin SB-235-52-23M: Replace prior to the accumulation of 15,000 total landings. (b) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM-113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM-113. Note 3: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Standardization Branch, ANM-113. (c) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. (d) The replacement shall be done in accordance with CASA Service Bulletin SB-235-52-23, Revision 2, dated June 9, 1994, or CASA Service Bulletin SB-235-52-23M, dated March 17, 1994. CASA Service Bulletin SB-235-52-23, Revision 2, dated June 1994, contains the following list of effective pages: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Revision level shown on Page No. page Date shown on page ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1.................... 1.......................
