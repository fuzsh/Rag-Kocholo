        "text": "PARIS -- A week ahead of the company's formal incorporation, shares in Aerospatiale Matra jumped 18 percent on their first day of trading, to 22.19 euros from their offer price of 18.2 euros.\n\nÂ Bolstered by its highly successful initial share issue, which was 40 times oversubscribed by institutional investors and seven times oversubscribed by private investors, the company also has begun to wield its new-found financial and industrial clout to reinforce its position as the world's second-largest maker of commercial aircraft and largest manufacturer of helicopters.\n\nÂ Bidding against its partners in Airbus, Aerospatiale Matra has offered to buy a 30-percent stake in Construcciones Aeronauticas SA (CASA), which is soon to be privatized by the Spanish government. British Aerospace wants to buy CASA outright, while Alenia Aerospazio, a unit of Italy's Finmeccanica group, has proposed a merger. Germany's Daimler-Chrysler Aerospace also is in the running to take over the Spanish company.\n\nÂ Aerospatiale Matra also is considering buying a stake in Korean Aerospace, according to statements by company officials during the past week, and it is talking to buy CAC Systemes, a small French maker of unmanned aerial vehicles, which it could merge with its aerial target business to create a large European UAV company.\n\nÂ Like its partners, the French firm is in no hurry to reorganize Airbus Industrie, the four-nation commercial airliner consortium in which it holds a 37.9 percent share. Other Airbus shareholders are British Aerospace (20 percent), DaimlerChrysler Aerospace (37.9 percent) and CASA (4.2 percent).\n\nÂ Plans to transform Airbus into the core of a future European Aerospace and Defense Company were dropped earlier this year, after British Aerospace opted to purchase Marconi Electronic Systems from the British GEC group rather than merge with DaimlerChrysler Aerospace.\n\nÂ Bonn and London have been pressing the French government to completely privatise Aerospatiale, instead of keeping its current 47.7 percent stake, to facilitate the transformation of Airbus. The May 28-29 Franco-German summit in Toulouse was expected to advance the issue, but instead French President Jacques Chirac, French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroder merely said that boosting cooperation in aerospace and defence would be a good thing.\n\nÂ In fact, Aerospatiale believes that changing Airbus' legal status only makes sense if the four partners agree on long-term goals and a new blueprint which solves all outstanding financial, industrial and management issues. There is no hurry. The Airbus system works well enough, and we must establish a consensus among the partners before turning it into a share corporation,\" a senior company official told defense-aerospace.com June 4.\n\nÂ He also discounted all-out competition between the Airbus partners, which are held together by a complex network of joint ventures and cooperative programs. In addiiton, he noted, \"each of the partners needs the others to approve its acquisitions - be it British Aerospace's buy of Marconi, the merger of DASA's missiles business with Matra BAe Dynamics or our merger with Matra - so we are at a stand-off.\"\n\nÂ However, industry observers in Paris say that one reason for the lack of urgency is that the incorporation of Airbus would loosen Aerospatiale's grip on the consortium. It also could complicate French attempts to keep final assembly of the future A3XX, a 550-seat airliner which Airbus is considering launching, in Toulouse rather than transferring it to Hamburg, Germany.\n\nÂ In several interviews to French newspapers this week, Aerospatiale Chairman Yves Michot said that Airbus could not survive without a mix of military and civil business. \"I don't think the best solution is to create an isolated company, with no technology exchange with the rest of the aerospace sector\", Michot said in an interview published June 1 by Le Figaro.\n\nÂ Aerospatiale's merger with the Matra Hautes Technologies unit of the privately-owned Lagardere group to create Aerospatiale Matra, and its partial privatization, is to be formalized June 11. The French government today floated 17 percent of the new company's shares, offered at 19.2 euros to individual investors, valuing it at 6.7 billion euros ($6.9 billion), but this increased to 7.9 billion euros as the share price hit 22.5 euros. Lagardere has 33 percent, and 2.3 percent are reserved for employees.\n\nÂ Success of the flotation was such that the Finance Ministry announced June 3 it would sell an additional 2.8 million shares to individuals by reducing the number reserved for institutionals\n\n-ends-"
