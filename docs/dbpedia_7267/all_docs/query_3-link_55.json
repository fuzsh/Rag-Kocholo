        "text": "The CASA/IPTN CN-235 is a twin-engined aircraft jointly manufactured by Construcciones Aeron√°uticas SA (CASA) and the Indonesian manufacturer IPTN. This versatile aircraft gained widespread use for air transport, surveillance, and maritime patrol, particularly in Turkey. The collaborative design for the CN-235-10 was conceived in 1980, with its maiden flight occurring in 1983. The original model was equipped with two General Electric CT7-7A engines, later upgraded to two CT7-9C engines in the extended CN-235-100 and 110.\n\nRed Box is delighted to present an extensive range of ground power equipment for this aircraft, featuring tugs, ground power units, start power units and more, meticulously tailored to meet the specific requirements of the CASA C-212 Aviocar aircraft.\n\nHighlighted in our product lineup is the 747C tug, and the RBSC225 continuous power unit. This unit is ideal for diagnostic work, pre-flight checks, or continuous powering of equipment during operations, all without draining the onboard aircraft batteries. Additionally, we provide a combination of start and continuous power in one unit for the CASA C-212 Aviocar aircraft in our TC3000 range.\n\nSuggested Products"
