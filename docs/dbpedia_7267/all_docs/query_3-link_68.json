        "text": "HGS on the Challenger 604\n\nThe U.S. Federal Aviation Administration recently approved the Flight Dynamics head-up guidance system (HGS) on the Bombardier Canadair Challenger 604. The STC follows some three years of development work.\n\nThe HGS is certified for use in weather conditions down to Category II approach minima (100-foot [30-meter] decision height and 1,200-foot [366-meter] runway visual range). It is a derivative of the HGS installed on Canadair regional jets.\n\nThe system displays flight information and guidance through a holographic \"combiner\" screen positioned before the pilot. The display is focused on infinity, allowing the pilot to see other aircraft and airports without changing focus. See www.flightdynamics.com.The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration recently approved the Flight Dynamics head-up guidance system (HGS) on the Bombardier Canadair Challenger 604.

Eaton plans to adapt its arc fault circuit interruption technology to the miniature circuit breakers in an aircraft’s 400-Hz electrical system.\n\nThese interrupters use integrated electronics to diagnose when arcing or \"jumping\" occurs in a wiring system, then immediately shut down the circuit. The technology is to prevent intermittent, sputtering electrical arcs that could become flash points for fires. For more on the subject, see www.eaton.com.\n\nWake-Up Call\n\nIn a joint program with Page Aerospace Ltd., Sunbury-on-Thames, UK, and the Laboratory of Applied Anthropology (LAA) at the University Paris V, Airbus Industrie has been assessing an electronic pilot activity and alertness monitor (EPAM). Currently in the conceptual phase, the EPAM would measure a number of factors, such as eye movements and crew interaction with flight deck systems to detect the onset of fatigue.\n\nEPAM was evaluated during a recent round-the-world flight of a FANS-A test aircraft and proved to be more effective than a simple wake-up alarm. According to Airbus, it can accurately detect states of hypo-vigilance and ascertain whether the individual needs to rest or simply perform certain tasks to return to the necessary standard of alertness. See www.pageaerospace.uk.co and www.airbus.com.\n\nICC Canada Selects LHAS\n\nInternational Cargo Charter Canada (ICC Canada) has selected Litton’s LTR-97 heading and attitude system (LHAS) for its fleet of Airbus A300-B4 aircraft.
