        "text": "SAN JOSE, California- Kaiser Electronics, a division of the Kaiser Aerospace & Electronics Corporation, Foster City, California, announced today that it has been awarded a contract from Construcciones Aeronauticas S. A. (CASA) for the Mid Life Upgrade (MLU) of the Spanish Airforce F/A-18A/B Aircraft.\n\nKaiser Electronics will supply a new state-of-the-art Multi-Function Horizontal Situation Display (MHSD) and a Multi-Function Up Front Control (MUFC). The upgraded displays are full color, high resolution displays that provide precise navigation/time reference, digital tactical imagery and enhanced displays and presentations while being controlled by a new airborne Tactical Pilots Awareness Computer (TPAC). The new displays will improve functionality in the areas of night vision compatibility, mission support and debriefing capabilities in addition to an enhancement in their operational life.\n\nIn addition, the current HUD analog video camera is being replaced with commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) based digital camera that provides better low light capabilities and more accurate representation of the pilot view as well as unique digital video enhancement capabilities. Both of the existing video tape recorders are being replaced with a single high-tech digital solid state four-channel recorder.\n\n\"We at Kaiser Electronics are excited about this opportunity to continue supporting and providing state-of-the-art cockpit display system solutions for the F/A-18 aircraft\", Stated Luis Arroyo, Program Director for Kaiser Electronics' Spanish Air Force F-18A/B Program. Kaiser Electronics has been a supplier of Head Up and Head Down display systems for the entire family of F/A-18 aircraft starting with the A/B and continuing with the C/D and E/F models, continually providing innovations in display technology.\n\nKaiser Electronics, located in San Jose, California, is an industry leader in providing vision system solutions to the defense and aerospace industry. Kaiser electronics supplies a complete range of high quality display system solutions for tactical fighter/attack aircraft including head down, head up, and helmet mounted displays.\n\n-ends-"
