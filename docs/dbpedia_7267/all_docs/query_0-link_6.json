        "text": "I have a list of designations that have not changed on my computer for some time. I am sure there must be more types I am missing. Its very frustrating because an online search for the name CASA brings up so many Spanish property websites! Add in C.A.S.A. and many sites interpret the full stop (period) as a wild card character !!\n\nSo, something to start this list off...\n\nConstrucciones Aeronáuticas SA (CASA) was founded by José Ortiz-Echagüe in 1923 and began work on a factory in Getafe in May 1924, building Breguet aircraft under license. CASA built a second factory in Cadiz in 1926 to construct a licensed copy of the German Dornier Do. J Wal seaplane.
