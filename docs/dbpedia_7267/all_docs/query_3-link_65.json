        "text": "Airbus develops, produces and supports commercial aircraft in the 100 seat and above range. In 2001 Airbus became a single fully integrated company incorporated under French law as a simplified joint stock company. The four national entities which had previously formed the Airbus consortium transferred their Airbus-related assets to the new company and became shareholders in Airbus -- Airbus France, Airbus Deutschland and Airbus Espana merging as the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS) with 80% shares and BAE\n\nSystems with 20%. In 2006, following the sales of BAE Systems' shares, Airbus became an EADS company.\n\nManufacturing, production and sub-assembly of parts for Airbus aircraft are distributed around 12 sites in Europe, with final assembly in Toulouse and Hamburg.There are also centres for engineering design, sales and support in North America; and sales and customer support centres in Japan and China. Airbus has a joint engineering centre inRussia with Kaskol.\n\nAIRBUS: FROM A SINGLE AIRCRAFT TO A COMPLETE FAMILY\n\nBy taking the right decisions at the start, Airbus has been able to create a complete range of aircraft that exceed the expectations of passengers, pilots and operators -- all within 30 years. Airbus was established in 1970 as a European consortium of French, German and later, Spanish and U.K companies, as it became clear that only by co-operating would European aircraft manufacturers be able to compete effectively with the U.S. giants. By overcoming national divides, sharing development costs, collaborating in the interests of a greater market share, and even agreeing a common set of measurements and a common language, Airbus changed the face of the business, and brought airlines, passengers and crews the benefits of real competition. In 2001, thirty years after its creation, Airbus formally became a single integrated company, thus passing another major milestone in its history of achievements.\n\nThe European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS), (resulting from the merger between Aerospatiale Matra SA of France, Daimler Chrysler Aerospace AG of Germany and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA of Spain), and BAE SYSTEMS of the UK, transferred all of their Airbus-related assets to the newly incorporated company and, in exchange, became shareholders in Airbus with 80 per cent and 20 per cent respectively of the new stock.\n\nThe co-operation between the different entities that make up Airbus today goes back to the 1920s. Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. (CASA) of Spain built seaplanes under licence from German company Dornier and worked with the French on the Bréguet XIX. Then in the 1950s, a number of Franco-German aviation projects saw the light of day. The 1960s saw the first real co-operative effort between French and German aircraft manufacturers on the Transall, followed by the Concorde adventure between the French and the British.\n\nThis was also a time of close contacts between CASA and Messerschmidt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB). MBB formed the core of DaimlerChrysler Aerospace AG (DASA) in 1989 and then CASA, Dasa and Aerospatiale Matra S.A. together formed EADS in 2000.\n\nThe Airbus GIE (or Groupement d'Intérêt Economique), a form of consortium under French law, was officially created at the end of 1970 to establish a formal co-operation among the GIE's partners and to provide a single sales, marketing and support interface for Airbus customers.\n\nThe two full partners in the original consortium were Aerospatiale for France and Deutsche Aerospace for Germany. Hawker Siddeley and Fokker were also associated with the programme and CASA of Spain became a full member of the GIE in 1971.\n\nInitially headquartered in Paris, the GIE moved to Toulouse in 1974. British Aerospace became a full partner in 1979.\n\nAirbus' first aircraft, the A300B, was launched at the 1969 Paris air show. It was the first widebody twinjet and could carry 226 passengers in a comfortable two-class lay-out. A stretched 250 seat version, the A300B2, requested by launch customer Air France, went into full scale production.\n\nBy 1974, the A300 had been certified on budget and ahead of schedule &endash; a major first for European companies at the time. By the end of 1975, Airbus had 10 per cent of the market and a total of 55 aircraft on order. The company then went through a dark period, during which it failed to secure any new orders. Finally, US airline Eastern Airlines decided to lease four A300B4s.\n\nThis was a turning point, and from then on, Airbus never looked back. Within two years, Airbus had 133 firm orders and market share had risen to 26 per cent by value. By the end of 1979, Airbus had 256 orders from 32 customers and 81 aircraft in service with 14 operators.\n\nIn July 1978, Airbus launched the A310, a shortened version of the A300 seating 218 passengers in a standard, two-class configuration. The aircraft featured the first ever two-man cockpit equipped with six cathode ray tubes displays replacing the older dials.\n\nNo longer was Airbus a one-aircraft manufacturer. It was set to expand and to create a complete range of airliners.\n\nFollowing this bold stroke, British Aerospace - which had taken over Hawker-Siddeley - became a full partner in the Airbus consortium in 1979. All the major European manufacturers were now firmly united and ready to challenge the U.S. industry.\n\nThat same year, Airbus decided to incorporate the 130-170 seat single aisle aircraft, on which the partners had been working outside the consortium, into its aircraft family. This project became the A320, which filled out the Airbus product line and allowed Airbus to compete for replacements of ageing U.S.-built aircraft in that category, in service worldwide at the time.\n\nThe A320, launched in 1984, was the first all-new design in its category in 30 years. Incorporating new technologies, the aircraft provided better operating efficiency, better performance and - above all - greater passenger comfort thanks to a wider fuselage cross-section. It was the first commercial aircraft to feature 'fly-by-wire' controls and side sticks. It set the standard for all subsequent Airbus cockpits and indeed for the industry as a whole.\n\nThe introduction of fly-by-wire also enabled Airbus to develop a family of aircraft sharing the same cockpit and the same flight handling characteristics.\n\nThe A320 was followed in 1989 by the A321, a lengthened version, seating 185 passengers in a standard three class configuration, and, in 1992, by a 124-seat version - the A319. The single-aisle Family was completed in 1999 with the introduction of the 107-seat A318.\n\nThe decision to launch the A320 proved a wise one. In spite of the recession of the mid 80s, the aircraft anticipated market demand for a modern, cost-efficient aircraft to replace older planes when the economy turned round. The new A320 was quickly chosen by Air France, British Caledonian, Adria Airways, Air Inter and Cyprus Airways. Today, it is one of Airbus' best-selling aircraft, popular with passengers and carriers alike.\n\nBy 1987, it was clear to Airbus that the time was ripe to launch not one, but two larger aircraft in a single programme. The market was ready for a twin engine, medium-haul aircraft as well as a long range, four engine, airliner.\n\nThe two new airliners shared the same airframe, the same wing design and the same popular twin-aisle cross-section as the A300/A310, incorporating the proven fly-by-wire controls of the A320.\n\nWhen the four-engine A340 entered service in 1993, it was the first entirely new, long-haul aircraft to start commercial operations for more than 20 years. The twin-engine A330 which joined it a year later combined some of the lowest operating costs of any aircraft ever designed with maximum flexibility for a wide range of route structures.\n\nTwo additional versions of the A340, the A340-500 and the A340-600, have been developed in close collaboration with airlines. The A340-600 achieved certification in May 2002 and entered airline service in August while its sibling, the A340-500, achieved certification in December 2002.\n\nIn December 2000, Airbus launched the 555-seat A380 programme at the top end of the spectrum. This all-new double-decker aircraft is the most advanced, spacious and efficient airliner ever conceived, and the solution to growing traffic between major hubs.\n\nThe A380 will provide 15 to 20 per cent lower operating costs, 10 to 15 per cent more range, lower fuel burn, less noise and lower emissions than the largest aircraft flying today."
