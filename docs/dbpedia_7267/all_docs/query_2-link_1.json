A first fuel line (101) connects the fuselage fuel tank to a collector fuel tank (108), which is connected by second fuel lines (103A, 103B) to aircraft engines in use of the system. Unspent fuel output from the aircraft engines is returned to the collector fuel tank via third fuel lines (105A, 105B). A fuel line arrangement (111A, 111 B, 111C) is arranged to draw fuel from, and return that fuel to, the wing fuel tanks. Fuel within the third fuel lines is thermally coupled to fuel within the fuel line arrangement by a heat exchanger (110). Heat energy within unspent fuel output from the aircraft engines is transferred to the wing fuel tanks, reducing the likelihood of fuel freezing within these tanks during extended flying in cold environments.\n\nIPC Classes ?\n\nB64D 37/34 - Conditioning fuel, e.g. heating\n\nF02C 7/224 - Heating fuel before feeding to the burner\n\nB64D 37/00 - Arrangements in connection with fuel supply for power plant\n\n7.\n\nCommunication methods between a tanker aircraft and a receiver aircraft in an in-flight refueling operation\n\nApplication Number 14318849 Grant Number 09197468 Status In Force Filing Date 2014-06-30 First Publication Date 2015-01-01 Grant Date 2015-11-24 Owner EADS CONSTRUCCIONES AERONAUTICAS, S.A.
