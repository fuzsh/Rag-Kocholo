Model C-212 series airplanes (Docket No. 97-NM-297-AD) - adopts a new AD to require a one-time inspection of the lower shaft and support structure of the rudder for corrosion, repair of any discrepancy found, and modification of the structure. These actions were prompted by reports that corrosion could develop in the lower shaft and the support structure of the rudder, a condition which could result in the failure of the rudder lower shaft and reduced controllability of the airplane.",
