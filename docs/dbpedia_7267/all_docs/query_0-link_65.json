(CASA), a pioneer enterprise of Spanish Aviation, created by José Ortiz Echaqüe in 1923. In the year 2000, after the fusion of CASA with Aerospatiale-Matra and DaimlerChrysler Aerospace AG (DASA), they became the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company (EADS). In 2014, after reorganizing, they called themselves Airbus Group.\n\nThey currently work in Spain and employ more than 11.000 workers.\n\nOur project to them was assembling a prefabricated building for dressing rooms of 955 m2, covered in rockwool sandwich panel of 60 mm with AENOR certificate at Airbus’ factory at Sevilla, south area. The total dimensions of the building were 55,97 x 17,14 meters, assembling 63 modules of 6,62×2,35.\n\nThe whole building meets the requirements of the Technical Building Code (CTE), for structural features and thermal and acoustic isolation.\n\nInside the building we have installed bathroom facilities, electricity and air conditioning.\n\nApplications for a prefabricated modular building:\n\nPermanent and temporary prefab Offices\n\nPrefabricated schools.\n\nDressing rooms and dining rooms.\n\nPortable\n\nCabing guard modules.\n\nPortacabins\n\nTelecom shelters\n\nControl cabins and rooms\n\nOur most important projects in Spain for 2016 were:"
