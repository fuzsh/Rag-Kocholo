We will also post a report summarizing each substantive verbal contact we receive about this proposed AD.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which is the Technical Agent for the Member States of the European Union, has issued EADS AD 2016-0075, dated April 19, 2016 (referred to after this as the Mandatory Continuing Airworthiness Information, or “the MCAI”), to correct an unsafe condition for all Airbus Defense and Space S.A. Model CN-235, CN-235-100, CN-235-200, CN-235-300, and C-295 airplanes. The MCAI states:\n\nExcessive play between bushings and their respective fitting housing was reported at Stabilizer Station (STA) 4850, affecting the outboard and inboard elevator hinge fittings and attachment fittings; and the horizontal stabilizer elevator linkage. Additionally, excessive misalignment was detected between the elevator hinge fittings and the elevator brackets during further analysis of the reported cases. Furthermore, an occurrence of an elevator hinge fitting crack was reported.\n\nThis condition, if not detected and corrected, could lead to failure or detachment of any of the affected structural parts, possibly resulting in reduced control of the aeroplane.\n\nTo address this potentially unsafe condition, Airbus Defence & Space (D&S) issued Alert Operator Transmissions (AOT) AOT-CN235-55-0001 Revision 2 and AOT-C295-55-0001 Revision 2 to provide inspection instructions to detect misalignment between the elevator hinge fittings and the elevator brackets. Additionally, Airbus D&S issued AOT-CN235-55-0003 and AOT-C295-55-0003 to provide inspection instructions to detect cracking of elevator hinge fitting and attachment fitting.\n\nFor the reasons described above, this [EASA] AD requires a one-time [detailed] inspection of the elevator hinge fittings and the elevator brackets, repetitive [eddy current] inspections of elevator hinge fittings and attachment fittings, and depending on findings, accomplishment of applicable corrective action(s) [e.g. repair(s)].\n\nYou may examine the MCAI in the AD docket on the Internet at http://www.regulations.gov by searching for and locating Docket No. FAA-2016-9521.\n\nRelated Service Information Under 1 CFR Part 51\n\nAirbus Defense and Space S.A. has issued the following Alert Operators Transmissions (AOT).\n\nAirbus Defense and Space S.A. AOT AOT-CN235-55-0001, Revision 2, dated March 10, 2015. The service information describes procedures for a detailed visual inspection of the elevator hinge fitting and bracket assembly to detect excessive play between bushings and their respective fitting housings, and to detect cracks; and corrective actions if necessary.\n\nAirbus Defense and Space S.A. AOT AOT-CN235-55-0003, dated December 22, 2015. The service information describes procedures for repetitive eddy current inspections to detect cracks in the elevator hinge fitting and bracket assembly, and corrective actions if necessary.\n\nAirbus Defense and Space S.A. AOT AOT-C295-55-0001, Revision 2, dated April 09, 2015. The service information describes procedures for a detailed visual inspection of the elevator hinge fitting and bracket assembly to detect excessive play between bushings and their respective fitting housings, and to detect cracks; and corrective actions if necessary.\n\nAirbus Defense and Space S.A. AOT AOT-C295-55-0003, dated December 22, 2015. The service information describes procedures for repetitive eddy current inspections to detect cracks in the elevator hinge fitting and bracket assembly, and corrective actions if necessary.\n\nThese documents are distinct since they apply to different airplane models in different configurations. This service information is reasonably available because the interested parties have access to it through their normal course of business or by the means identified in the ADDRESSES section.\n\nFAA’s Determination and Requirements of This Proposed AD\n\nThis product has been approved by the aviation authority of another country, and is approved for operation in the United States. Pursuant to our bilateral agreement with the State of Design Authority, we have been notified of the unsafe condition described in the MCAI and service information referenced above. We are proposing this AD because we evaluated all pertinent information and determined an unsafe condition exists and is likely to exist or develop on other products of these same type designs.\n\nDifferences Between This Proposed AD and the MCAI or Service Information\n\nThe MCAI allows credit for an inspection done in accordance with the following Airbus Defense and Space S.A. AOTs, as applicable:\n\nAOT-CN235-55-0001, dated December 16, 2014, or\n\nAOT-C295-55-0001, dated December 16, 2014.Start Printed Page 1271\n\nThis proposed AD does not give credit for accomplishing those initial issues of the service information because the inspection requirements are different from the initial issues of the service information in both Revision 1 and Revision 2 of Airbus Defense and Space AOT AOT-CN235-55-0001, and AOT AOT-C295-55-0001.\n\nAlso, the MCAI identifies a date for Revision 1 of Airbus Defense and Space S.A. AOT AOT-C295-55-0001, which was corrected by Revision 2 of the same service information. Paragraph (m), “Credit for Previous Actions,” of this proposed AD shows the correct date.\n\nCosts of Compliance\n\nWe estimate that this proposed AD affects 14 airplanes of U.S. registry.\n\nWe estimate the following costs to comply with this proposed AD:\n\nWe estimate the following costs to do any necessary repairs that would be required based on the results of the proposed inspection. We have no way of determining the number of airplanes that might need this repair:\n\nAuthority for This Rulemaking\n\nTitle 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA’s authority to issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. “Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs,” describes in more detail the scope of the Agency’s authority.\n\nWe are issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in “Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements.” Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.\n\nRegulatory Findings\n\nWe determined that this proposed AD would not have federalism implications under Executive Order 13132. This proposed AD would not have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the national Government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.\n\nFor the reasons discussed above, I certify this proposed regulation:\n\n1. Is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866;\n\n2. Is not a “significant rule” under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979);\n\n3. Will not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska; and\n\n4. Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.\n\nStart List of Subjects\n\nList of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39\n\nAir transportation\n\nAircraft\n\nAviation safety\n\nIncorporation by reference\n\nSafety\n\nEnd List of Subjects\n\nThe Proposed Amendment\n\nAccordingly, under the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the FAA proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 as follows:\n\nStart Part\n\nPART 39—AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES\n\nEnd Part\n\nStart Amendment Part\n\n1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows:\n\nEnd Amendment Part\n\nStart Authority\n\nAuthority:\n\n49 U.S.C. 106(g), 40113, 44701.\n\nEnd Authority\n\n[Amended]\n\nStart Amendment Part\n\n2. The FAA amends § 39.13 by adding the following new airworthiness directive (AD):\n\nEnd Amendment Part\n\nAirbus Defense and Space S.A.
