        "text": "Rumors are circulating that the Spanish Air and Space Force is considering that it does not need so many Airbus A400Ms, and would like to give up the 13 aircraft it has yet to receive.\n\nAs reported by Reuters, doubts are growing over the future of Madrid’s remaining orders for Airbus’ A400M multirole transport aircraft, European defense sources said today, as business leaders and dignitaries commemorated the 100th anniversary of Spain’s military aircraft manufacturing activities.\n\nSpain originally ordered 27 A400M aircraft, of which it has so far received approximately 50%. In addition, the company’s facilities in Seville (formerly CASA) are responsible for the final assembly of all aircraft contracted by the partners.\n\nHowever, after several months of uncertainty, European defense sources stated that Madrid was inclined to cancel the remaining 13 or so aircraft of the Spanish quota that have not yet been delivered, after the Spanish Air Force indicated that it did not need the additional aircraft.\n\nSee also: Spain procures 20 additional Eurofighters to replace its F-18s\n\nThe doubts and rumors of cancellation arose while, in Getafe, just outside Madrid, Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury attended the centenary celebrations of Construcciones Aeronáuticas S.A. (CASA), one of the European companies that gave rise to Airbus and whose specific know-how was fundamental for the development of the A400M, once one of the largest European defense projects."
