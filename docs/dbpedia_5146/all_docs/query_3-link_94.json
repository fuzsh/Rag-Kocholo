        "text": "Rivas\n\nRosa Rivas, beloved mother, sister, and friend, passed away peacefully on August 2, 2024, at the age of 65. Born on August 13, 1958, in San Antonio, Texas, Rosa was a vibrant presence who touched the lives of all who knew her.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her husband, Placido Rivas; her parents, Candelaria Andrada and Charlie Andrada; and her sister, Mary Gallardo. Rosa is survived by her son, Charlie Rivas; her siblings, Teresa Aguero, Delia Castillo, Vicente Andrada, and Anna Vela.\n\nRosa was a talented hairdresser known for her humor and warmth. She had an infectious laugh and a playful spirit, always ready for a game or a fun outing. Her love for dogs was unmatched, and her loyal companions, Bear and Chiquita, brought her immense joy. Chiquita was always by her side, accompanying Rosa on all her adventures. Rosa's positive outlook on life meant she was never in a bad mood, bringing joy to those around her.\n\nHer family and friends will dearly miss Rosa, but her legacy of laughter, love, and kindness will continue to inspire all who had the privilege of knowing her.\n\nA memorial service to celebrate Rosa's life will be held at Delgado Funeral Home, 2200 West Martin St., San Antonio, TX 78207, where we will share stories and honor her remarkable life.\n\nJulia O. Gonzales (Mrs. G)\n\nThe gates of heaven opened and took mom home on July 29, 2024, at the age of 95. She was born June 19, 1929, in Concan, Texas raised in Uvalde, Tx. Julia was preceded in death by her devoted husband, Ernest F. Gonzales; her parents, Ladislada and Raphael Ortiz; and her siblings, Jose, Arnold, Richard, Ernesto, Pedro, Roque, Maria, Sara, Celia, and Guadalupe. She leaves behind a legacy of love and perseverance, survived by her children, Joann Alcala, Albert Gonzales, and Susie Soriano. Julia was also a cherished grandmother to 9 grandchildren, 21 great grandchildren, and 6 great-great-grandchildren who will miss her deeply.\n\nShe had a beautiful peaceful passing surrounded by her loved ones in her home. Her life was marked by her dedication to her family and her ability to bring joy and warmth to those around her. She will be remembered as a loving mother, grandmother, and spiritual woman. She loved her Cowboys, Spurs, gambling, and most of all her wrestling. She enjoyed spending time with her family, reading her devoted booklets, and listening to her sermons with a cup of coffee. Those who knew her will fondly remember her funny and spirited nature and love for her family. She was a fan of John Cena and could light up any room with humor for him. Hearing her tell childhood memories and different chapters of her life was amazing and inspirational. Her passing is a significant loss to all who knew her, and her memory will be cherished forever. She will always remain in our hearts. With a heavy heart, it’s time to say goodbye to a beautiful mother who gave us so much in life and will live with us. Until we meet and see each other again. A special thanks to her friend Sheila Barry, who often called her or came to visit her, brought her flowers and goodies to eat, and to her Nephew Pastor Arnold Ortiz.\n\nVisitation will begin on Monday, August 12, 2024 at 4:00pm at Delgado Funeral Home (2200 W. Martin St, San Antonio, Texas 78207) with a Prayer Service at 7:00pm. The Funeral Home will open at 9:00am on Tuesday, August 13, 2024. A Chapel Service will begin at 12:30pm.

Ybarra, lovingly known to everyone as “Becky,” was born on August 28, 1951, in Brownsville, TX. When Becky came into this world, life became so much sweeter to all who crossed her path. Her smile would light up a room. Her laugh was contagious. She was tiny, but she was filled with more love than most people could possibly long for.\n\nBecky loved taking road trips to see her family. Nothing made her happier than to spend time with her immediate and extended family. It didn’t have to be fancy … just a table, chairs, food, laughter, and plenty of time to joke around with those she held so dear to her heart. Another group she loved spending time with was her church family and sisters in Christ. The bond that was shared came from the love of the Lord. What a blessing the church always was to Becky.\n\nBut the One who Becky loved most – and it was very evident in her life – was her Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. All who knew Becky could immediately sense there was something different about her. Her steadfast love and faith in the Lord through the hardships in her life were always a true testament of her commitment to God. God was everything to Becky. And because of her faith in Christ, on July 26, 2024, the day she passed away, Becky’s faith became sight; and she entered the presence of the One who saved her. Becky will be greatly missed, but she is now in a place where there is no more sickness, no more pain. She has been made whole.\n\nBecky was preceded in death by her loving husband (Toby Ybarra), loving son (Danny Serna), parents (Herlindo and Leonor Gracia), sister (Angelica Garcia), and sister (Gloria Trevino). She is survived by her daughter and son-in-law (Precilla and Victor Silva, III), grandson (Isaac Serna), granddaughter (Victoria Serna), great-grandson (Jeremiah Serna), brother (Oscar Gracia) and wife (Patti), sister (Elizabeth Fernandez) and husband (Santiago), and brother (Abel Gracia) and wife (Josie), along with many cousins, nephews, and nieces.\n\nIf you would like to attend the Celebration of Life for Becky, the funeral arrangements are below:\n\nVisitation: Friday, August 2, 2024 at 4:00 – 8:00 p.m., with a Prayer Service beginning at 6:00 p.m. at Iglesia Cristiana Family Life Center (618 Vickers Avenue, San Antonio, TX 78211). A Celebration of Life will begin on Saturday, August 3, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. (The chapel will open at 8:30 a.m.) at Delgado Funeral Home (2200 West Martin Street, San Antonio, TX 78207).\n\nSifuentes\n\n“It is with great sadness that I would like to announce the passing of my beloved, loving daughter Marissa Marie Sifuentes.\n\nMarissa Marie Sifuentes was born on Nov. 11, 1995, to Sandra and Manuel Sifuentes in San Antonio, Texas.

She found immense joy working at the Hilton Palacio Del Rio, where her husband would meet her everyday after work to walk her home. Her warm smile and exceptional hospitality endeared her to colleagues and guests alike for many many years. A woman of deep faith, her devotion to God was evident in every aspect of her life. In her later years, she dedicated herself wholeheartedly to caring for her grandchildren and great-grandchildren, finding immense joy in their laughter and innocence. She cherished the moments spent playing with them, creating memories that will forever be cherished. Movies were one of Emilia’s passions, and she had a special love for Selena, whose music and story resonated deeply with her. Her collection of dolls and trinkets were a testament to her appreciation for beauty and her vibrant personality.\n\n“Se fuerte,” because she exemplified strength and raised us all to embody it. Te quiero mucho mucho mucho mommy, para siempre.\n\nVisitation will begin Monday, July 15, 2024 at 4:00 PM at Delgado Funeral Home (2200 W.

Later they moved to San Antonio, to live in the San Juan Homes. He was a very smart child, he loved to take things apart, to see how they worked. He was a very loquacious prodigy; his grandma Fina would tell him to turn off his radio(his mouth), because of said loquacious behavior. He went to Sarah King for his elementary years; Rhodes for his middle school years, then Lanier for his high school years. He was a very kind-hearted person to everyone he met, and had a very altruistic personality to his kind heart. Everyone loved him, and he would return that love by helping them when he could; he'd never turn down a friend; he had many friends. He loved riding 10 speed bikes and go carts, and at his end; his motorbike. He met his Wife at 17, but they did not get together til he was 25 on the 3rd of December, 2005. He raised Jason as his own; he loved him as his own. Then he had Carlitos on September 5, 2006. Jimmy was born on April 18, 2011, Alize was born on February 4, 2013, and Annabella November 24, 2014. He loved all 5 of his children very much, he always made sure they had a roof over their head, clothes on their back and food in their belly; his family always came first. He loved his wife, he would give her everything she wanted. They built a home together no matter where, as long as they were together with their children, they were happy together. He loved his mom, Irene, and dad, Ernest, very much. He'd visit them everyday, whatever they needed, he would try his best to provide. He loved his sister, Lisa, they were really close; she remembers taking him to school, bathing him, and feeding him. He also loved her husband, Gus, and their two kids, Matt and Jenna. He also loved his little, big brother Dan; they were always together. Everyone he talked to, knew he was a special person. He touched every person's heart he helped and met. He loved going fast in his Mustang and his job, he was a hard worker, always moving, asking if they needed help. He loved working at Tindall, his coworkers, Joe and Abby and everyone who worked there, whom he got along with. He'd give people money when someone asked, he knew the struggle of being down on cash, he could relate. It was his sympathy and compassion that allowed people to see him love him. He was always thankful to friends and family, and most importantly, he was loved by everyone he knew and met.\n\nGarcia\n\nMaria Dolores Garcia, a devoted Catholic, loving mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother, entered into eternal rest on June 7th, 2024, at the age of 70.

He was a true son of the Southside of San Antonio and a proud resident of the Bustillos Drive neighborhood. Willie took great pride in living on the land granted to his ancestor Jose Domingo Esteban Bustillos after serving as the alcalde (mayor) of San Antonio in 1816. Willie was also a 9th-generation descendant of Joseph Padron, one of the original Canary Islanders who founded the first civil government in Texas, the Villa de Bejar (San Antonio). Willie was a member of the Canary Islanders Descendants Association (CIDA), and he took great pride in his family history and worked to keep it alive for the younger generations.\n\nWillie graduated from Harlandale High School as a part of the class of 1969. The rebellious spirit of his graduating class lived on in Willie for decades to come.

During one of his last visits with his children and grandchildren, Willie took everyone shooting creating a lifetime of memories down through generations.\n\nWow, did Willie have collections! Starting from a young age, baseball cards were his “currency” that he would exchange with his brothers. Then came coins, Beanie Babies, random car parts in his parent’s garage, and vinyl records.

Known for identifying any car he could see driving down the road, Willie shared his car knowledge with all his friends and family. Always ready to share car repair or car-buying advice, Willie’s sons followed in his footsteps with an appreciation for cars and their rebuilds. When his sons showed an interest in car repairs, Willie took them shopping for stereo systems and tools to “create” their dream rides.\n\nWillie was known for being passionate, opinionated, and most of all, authentic. In true Bustillo fashion, Willie enjoyed sitting around with his sons, daughter, nieces, nephews, and grandchildren to share his “Bustillo life advice and wisdom.” With a warm fire and cold beer in hand, everyone knew that story time was bound to bring plenty of laughs and maybe some tears. Whether he shared life advice or a shoulder to cry on, Willie knew how to speak to our hearts.\n\nWillie was husband to Lynne Lopez; the proud father of three children, William Jr. (Jessica), Robert (Nicole), and Andrea; and grandfather to Payton, Harlyn, Autumn, Jynsyn, and Liam. He was the middle brother to Rudolph Jr. and Freddie; brother-in-law to Gloria, Fred, Grace, Glenda (Jim), Ramona, Larry, Harold [deceased]; and uncle to Cynthia, Michelle, Marisa, Anneliese, Kristen, Lori, Michael, Matthew, Robert, Anthony, April, Bobbie, Jesse, Jessika, John, Matthew, and Heather.\n\nPlease join the family for services at Delgado Funeral Home on April 20,2024 at 4:00pm-6:30pm for a viewing, rosary (beginning at 5pm), and fellowship hour.

Revs has always been an exceptionally talented, loving, and genuine person. Throughout his life has demonstrated the true meaning of humility. By putting others before himself and showing the utmost love, and respect to all including those whom came and went before him. It made no difference if you were blood or not. To REVS you were always more than just friends, you were part of the family.\n\nThe greatest legacy someone can pass onto others after they're gone. Is the legacy of their character, faith, and what they create while they're still here. Faith was very important to Chris; he stayed strong in his faith. He never forsake his love and belief in God as his higher power above all else. For only God truly knew his heart and what he had to endure on his journey through life's trials and tribulations. Be that as it may God only knows why he made the executive decision to call upon Christopher Lee \"REVS\" Silva so soon.\n\nChristopher Lee Silva was born in San Antonio, Texas as the oldest son of 4 children. He was preceded in death by his grandmother Trinidad Hernandez. He is survived by his parents: mother Lydia Silva, and father David Hernandez as well as grandmother Maria G. White. He was the oldest sibling to sister Roxanne Hernandez, and brother to David Hernandez Jr, and Henry Martinez.\n\nHe was a wonderful loving step dad to his 2 stepsons oldest son Patrick Caballero and youngest Phillip Caballero; his Girlfriend Chistina Caballero. These two boys truly fulfilled the dream of fatherhood for Christopher creating a bond with them that was inseparable. In the eyes of those boys he will always be their dad, and to him these two amazing little boys will forever be his sons.\n\nChristopher loved kids. He showed this best by the unconditional love he so naturally provided to his nieces and nephews every chance he had to do so.\n\nChristopher has 6 nieces oldest niece Myracle Hernandez, Elia Hernandez, Zemia Zavala, Mila Martinez, Briella Martinez and baby Kaycee Martinez. Along with 5 nephews oldest nephew Elias Hernandez, James Zavala Jr, Isaiah Martinez, Mathew Martinez and youngest nephew Zaiden Martinez.\n\nChristopher was all about Family First spending quality time together and being there as support for one another. He has a big family with lots of aunts, uncles and cousins that will miss his dearly.\n\nWhilst people are most interested in talent, God is most impressed by character. Christopher most certainly possessed both. He was a character without a doubt. He possessed a sense of humor that was just out of this word awesome. He knew just the right words to say in time of need or how to make you laugh to see a smile on your face.\n\nHis ability to create awe-inspiring art work and his passion for street art alone have made him a legacy in the graffiti art community. Revs street art has left an imprint all around the San Antonio area for many years to come. REVS will forever be remembered and truly missed by everyone no matter if you were near and dear to him personally or only knew of him thru the graffiti art community. \"They say that a true artist is not one who is inspired, but one who inspires others\" Beyond any doubt Revs most certainly was a true artist. He inspired so many people to hone in on their passion for art and embrace the creative genius within them. Now if that isn't a legacy worth remembering then I don't know what is.\n\nRest in Paint Christopher Lee \"REVS\" Silva\n\nVisitation will begin on Sunday, November 12, 2023 at 4:00pm at Delgado Funeral Home (2200 W.

He enjoyed his work as a machine operator, working on many roadways in San Antonio, for many decades. He also enjoyed his time outdoors and spending time talking with his family and teaching life lessons to his grandkids. He appreciated a good dessert with a soda; gatherings with family; helping wherever he could; supported the Duct-tape cause (because anything could be fixed with Duct-tape); almost always let you know what he thought; and rarely ever complained of pain (even at the end of his life). He was humorous but serious when he needed to be. He was a kind-hearted and loving man and no matter what he did, he was selfless and did it for his family, he dedicated his life to loving and giving; even when he had nothing.\n\nHe is preceded by his parents, Lazaro Alaquinez, Sr & Maria Campos Alaquinez; his in-laws; both sisters and two brothers.

He leaves a void in our hearts but also many moments that will be cherished in our hearts.\n\nWhen we think of him, we won’t just remember his passing but the moments we shared when we smiled, laughed, and even cried. Every moment with him will forever be important and locked away in our hearts whether it was bad or good, because the time spent with him was well worth every second.

He loved meeting and talking to people, learning new things everyday, teaching someone what he had learned and praying for everyone he felt needed a prayer.\n\nHe worked for Border Patrol and worked as a supervisor of over 20 years at Boeing Kelly Air Force Base. He then started a new chapter with Northside Independent School District, that lasted 13 years, at one of their high schools, Oliver Wendell Holmes, which he had grown a huge love for and was dedicated to. He was sought after and highly respected by everyone, for being the kind of person that he was and always willing to help.\n\nHe had a huge love for his favorite Mexican soccer team, America. You could always find him sitting up close to the television in his little green sofa, cheering them on. But out of everything, he was a direct man and had principles and a huge dose of faith in the Lord for anything and everything. He would always state, “If it wasn't for the lord, I wouldn’t be here right now, he grants me all the strength and power to keep pushing forward”. His granddaughters were his biggest motivation, his fire and drive to keep on moving. Everything he did was for them. His granddaughters’ will always remember him as “grandpy” and for being the kind, loving, tender, strong man he was. He loved them very much and wanted to be the best grandpa to them.\n\nHe had an imagination like no other and always had thoughts for his children and did for them like any father would. He sacrificed and loved them and showed them the ways of the Lord and to stand strong and trust in Him.

She grew up in the nearby town of Cañada Verde, Texas. Rachel was one of eleven children. Her family grew up poor but the stories she shared were always told in such a way that it was easy to see she loved her life. She truly loved her mother Antonia Torres and father Blas Torres; in her final days she spoke of them frequently.\n\nRachel began working at a young age, her family were migrant farm workers and the whole clan would travel to where the work was; work was hard but her memories told of the good times. She loved the traveling and making the most of the little time she had to be a child. Eventually, Rachel moved to San Antonio for employment. After a long career as a seamstress, Rachel retired but her outstanding skills remained in high demand. There was nothing she couldn’t do with a needle and thread. She was constantly making dresses, altering clothes or creating all kinds of things out of cloth. She enjoyed making things for her family and friends.\n\nRachel enjoyed her well-earned retirement years playing the game of Bingo. To say she enjoyed playing Bingo is an understatement, Rachel was a true die-hard Bingo player, she loved the game. For Rachel, winning was nice but the time she was able to spend with family and friends was the best part. Rachel was a great cook; her meals were absolutely delicious. Her tortillas were legendary. It was amazing to see her prepare an amazing meal in minutes with whatever was at her fingertips. She loved making huge breakfasts for family on weekends.\n\nRachel had such a tremendous faith in Jesus Christ. Thus, likely the reason she passed in the manner she did. In the end, Rachel passed peacefully and in her own bed. And by her side as always was her daughter Sylvia, her constant companion and caregiver but most importantly her best friend. She wouldn’t have had it any other way.

Forever remembered by his siblings Felix & Rosemary Garcia, Bobby Garcia, Cesar Garcia, Brenda & Pete Reyes, Frank Fuentes, Sandra Fuentes+, Helen & Ernest Lane, Peter Garcia, Chris Garcia, and Cindy Garcia. Joe was a beloved husband, father, father-in-law, grandfather, brother, brother-in law, uncle, nephew, cousin, and friend. Of all the titles he had the privilege to wear, the one he was most proud of was being Grandpa.\n\nJoe was born on February 25, 1963, to Roberto & Amelia Garcia in San Antonio, Texas. He spent his childhood between San Antonio and Ft. Worth/Dallas. Having to work very early on in his childhood, he started working doing construction labor which he continued to do up until his death. He was a hard worker who always provided for his family to make sure they never went without. Determined to have a happy family, Joe strived (and achieved) to be the best husband and father. After marrying Juanita Garcia, Joe married into a family of all girls, he quickly became the big brother of them all.\n\nAnyone who knew Joe knew that he was the most compassionate, big-hearted, people helper (even to his own detriment) kind of person. Joe pretty much taught a lot of us how to drive, he was the go-to person to fix everyone’s cars. Joe opened his home to anyone in need without questions asked, without hesitation and without a second thought. If you needed help with anything, Joe was the one you knew you could count on.\n\nHe will be deeply missed by all who knew him, but his legacy will live on though all the memories made, stories shared, and pictures saved.\n\nFamily and friends are invited to attend the Celebration of his life.

He took tremendous solace through reciting the St.Michael The Archangel Prayer and touching a few of his favorite religious relics (Padre Pio & Blessed Francis Xavier Seelos) every morning before he left his home.\n\nJoe loved music of all genres but his absolute favorite band since high school was Rush in which his band Eminence emulated their music in their own soundtracks. For decades he was a vocalist, played both the acoustic guitar and the bass, and he played the keyboard.

Known by many names – Ricky, Rick, Dad, Daddy-o, Peepaw, Slick Rick, Honky, Babe – he leaves behind a legacy as a family man that few can achieve. Lucky enough to have found his life’s partner at such a young age, together they built a family with unconditional love and care. Rick - a loyal husband, a loving father to four children and 2 grandkids, a kind friend to all who knew him – lived a life worth remembering.\n\nRick was many things to many people. Lover, father, mechanic, thrower of epic New Years Eve parties, remote learning teacher. He did it all.\n\nIt’s near impossible to sum up someone’s life in a few words but it’s far easier to understand it by looking at what he leaves behind. He and his wife shared a deep love and taught their kids that family, above all else, is what this life is all about. While he may not be here with us anymore, through his kids and his grandkids and the lessons they learned from him, he will live on forever.\n\nKnowing Rick, he is up in heaven casting a line, cracking a beer, shouting “never buy a Ford”, waiting for the day when he can hold his love in his arms again so they can continue the journey they started. For those of us"
