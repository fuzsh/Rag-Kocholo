        "text": "This article explores the childhood of a Mexican Indigenous activist, Raúl Javier Gatica Bautista, who was born in 1963 in the Oaxacan market town of Tlaxiaco. Growing up in poor circumstances, Gatica would become a leader in the social movements that between the 1980s and early 2000s pushed Mexico toward gradual democratic reform. The article seeks to describe what it was like to grow up poor and Indigenous at a time (later dubbed the Mexican Miracle) of impressive social and economic advances. Paying special attention to the experience of racial abuse, the article also asks how Gatica's childhood came to inform his political militancy. While other historians have linked the phenomenon of political radicalism in twentieth-century Latin America to particular social conditions, or to the influence and adaptation of global ideologies, this article seeks the origins of Gatica's radicalism in the experience of a racialised childhood.\n\nPortuguese abstract\n\nEste artigo explora a infância de um ativista indígena mexicano, Raúl Javier Gatica Bautista, que nasceu em 1963 na cidade mercantil de Tlaxiaco em Oaxaca. Tendo crescido em condições precárias, Gatica se tornaria um líder dos movimentos sociais que, entre os anos 1980 e o início dos anos 2000, empurraram o México para uma reforma democrática gradual. O artigo busca descrever como era crescer pobre e indígena em uma época (mais tarde chamada de Milagre Mexicano) de avanços sociais e econômicos impressionantes. Dando especial atenção à experiência de abuso racial, o artigo também questiona como a infância de Gatica veio a determinar sua militância política. Enquanto outros historiadores vincularam o fenômeno do radicalismo político na América Latina do século XX a condições sociais particulares, ou à influência e adaptação de ideologias globais, este artigo busca as origens do radicalismo de Gatica na experiência de uma infância racializada.\n\n2 Interviews with José Gatica, Pueblo Nuevo, Oaxaca, 30 Oct. 2019, and Raúl Gatica, Vancouver, 17 Feb. 2020; phone interview with Refugio (‘Virginia’) Gregorio, Raúl's sister, 26 March 2020.

See also Lewis's earlier treatment of the ‘culture of poverty’ among poor Mexican families in Five Families: Mexican Case Studies in the Culture of Poverty (New York: Basic Books, 1959). Both books represented a departure from Lewis's initial more optimistic assessment of the ability of rural migrants to make a life in the city in ‘Urbanization without Breakdown: A Case Study’, The Scientific Monthly, 75: 1 (1952), pp. 31–41. That study had argued against overemphasis on ‘the negative aspects [of rural–urban migration], such as personal maladjustment, breakdown of family life, decline of religion, and increase of delinquency’ (p. 31). On the development of Lewis's thinking on urban poverty, see Antuñano, Emilio de, ‘Mexico City as an Urban Laboratory: Oscar Lewis, the “Culture of Poverty” and the Transnational History of the Slum’, Journal of Urban History, 45: 4 (2019), pp. 813–30CrossRefGoogle Scholar.\n\n22 For overviews of twentieth-century urban theory, see Brodwyn Fischer, ‘A Century in the Present Tense: Crisis, Politics, and the Intellectual History of Brazil's Informal Cities’, in Fischer, Bryan McCann and Javier Auyero (eds.), Cities From Scratch: Poverty and Informality in Urban Latin America (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2014), pp. 9–67, and Kees Koonings and Dirk Kruijt, ‘The Rise of Megacities and the Urbanization of Informality, Exclusion and Violence’, in Koonings and Kruijt (eds.), Mega-Cities: The Politics of Urban Exclusion and Violence in the Global South (New York: Zed Books, 2009), pp. 8–27.\n\n23 Lewis's view was thus considerably more nuanced than those of US scholars and policymakers who used his thesis to deplore the values of poor, Black families in the United States. For discussions of the global reception of Lewis's work see Fischer, ‘A Century in the Present Tense’, pp. 33–40, de Antuñano, ‘Mexico City as an Urban Laboratory’ and Rosemblatt, Karin Alejandra, ‘Other Americas: Transnationalism, Scholarship, and the Culture of Poverty in Mexico and the United States’, Hispanic American Historical Review, 89: 4 (2009), pp. 603–41CrossRefGoogle Scholar.\n\n26 Virginia and Palemón carried on their parents’ trade as petty merchants, while José and Raúl became teachers (José after first working for some years as a veterinarian). In his subsidised, single-room Vancouver flat, Raúl probably leads the most materially modest life of the siblings, as he pours the majority of his money and energy into his political work, now on behalf of Latin American migrant workers in Canada.\n\n56 While some Mexican anthropologists developed a more radical indigenismo, defending the value of cultural pluralism rather than assimilation, their position did not become part of the political mainstream: Luis Villoro, Los grandes momentos del indigenismo en México, 3rd edition (Mexico City: Colegio de México/Colegio Nacional/Fondo de Cultura Económica, 1996), pp. 228–57; Paula López Caballero, ‘Anthropological Debates around the Indigenous Subject and Alterity, 1940–1948’, and Diana Lynn Schwartz, ‘Displacement, Development, and the Creation of a Modern Indígena in the Papaloapan, 1940s–1970s’, in Paula López Caballero and Ariadna Acevedo-Rodrigo (eds.), Beyond Alterity: Destabilizing the Indigenous Other in Mexico (Tucson, AZ: University of Arizona Press, 2018), pp. 199–221 and 222–43; Alan Knight, ‘Racism, Revolution, and Indigenismo: Mexico, 1910–1940’, in Richard Graham (ed.), The Idea of Race in Latin America, 1870–1940 (Austin, TX: University of Texas Press, 1990), pp. 71–113; María L.

Reports about appearance-based racial prejudice also pepper the anthropological and oral-history literature on Mexican everyday culture: see e.g. Lewis, The Children of Sánchez, pp. 23–4, 63, 65, 68, 110; Friedlander, Being Indian in Hueyapan, pp. 4–5; Vaughan, Portrait of a Young Painter, p. 56.\n\n71 Raúl used to act as a ‘macho’ in the strong sense of that term, which ‘connotes men who expect the superior place in a vigorously defended gender hierarchy and the societies informed by such a hierarchy’: Víctor M. Macías-González and Anne Rubenstein, ‘Introduction: Masculinity and History in Modern Mexico’, in Macías-González and Rubenstein (eds.), Masculinity and Sexuality in Modern Mexico (Albuquerque, NM: University of New Mexico Press, 2012), p. 2.
