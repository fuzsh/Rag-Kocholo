        "text": "Brownsville, my used to be hometown and a vibrant city on the Texas-Mexico border, boasts a rich cultural heritage and a rapidly evolving landscape. However, beneath the surface, a troubling pattern of inaction, indifference, and at times, complicity when it comes to holding individuals and institutions accountable. Only by confronting these issues head-on can the city truly prosper and deliver the city its residents truly deserve.\n\nSome of the events over the past year vividly underscored these issues, revealing a troubling spectrum of injustices perpetrated by local institutions. This article delves into these concerns, drawing from recent news stories that showcase the systemic problems afflicting Brownsville’s institutions.\n\nI. The Case of a Child in Solitary Confinement\n\nA disturbing incident came to light when The Texas Observer uncovered the harrowing story of an 11-year-old honor roll student, Timothy Murray, who endured three days of solitary confinement at the Darrell B. Hester Juvenile Detention Center in Brownsville. This shocking revelation is rooted in a series of events that began with a tragic loss in Timothy’s life — the passing of his father due to a rare cancer. Following this loss, Timothy sought counseling, but his attempts would set in motion a chain of alleged retaliatory actions by Myrta Garza, the principal of Palm Grove Elementary School.\n\nThe Texas Observer article serves as a spotlight on how both the school principal and law enforcement let this student down. Timothy, an honor roll student with no prior history of violence, found himself accused by another student of making threats against Principal Garza. Timothy vehemently denied these allegations, but Garza called in law enforcement, leading to his detention and placement in solitary confinement. The manner in which he was detained suggests that the Independent School District and the police may have violated state laws and regulations that exist to protect young children from excessive law enforcement actions.\n\nThe response from the Brownsville Independent School District (BISD) was disheartening. They issued what appeared to be a generic statement, essentially deflecting responsibility and claiming the matter was under someone else’s investigation. Such a response is unacceptable. One must question whether any disciplinary action has been taken against Myrta Garza.\n\nIt is worth noting that “Garza comes from a Brownsville education legacy. Her mother, Rachel Medina Ayala, was one of Brownsville Independent School District’s first female superintendents. Garza’s two sisters are also principals in the district.” This all too well fits the narrative that Brownsville protects these legacy families who feel can do whatever they want without facing consequences. BISD had stated on their social media that their staff and police department underwent training in February. The adequacy of this training warrants scrutiny.\n\nAmidst these troubling events in September, the Brownsville ISD superintendent was reportedly preoccupied with advancing his candidacy as one of the top three finalists for the Superintendent position at McAllen ISD.\n\nMeanwhile, young Timothy Murray continues to face an uncertain future. He must contend with Cameron County prosecutors who have pursued Class C felony charges of “terroristic threat” against him. Presently, he is on conditional home release until his upcoming hearing happening today, November 8.\n\nII. Vandalism in the in the eye of the Beholder\n\nIn 2022, the Elon Musk Foundation commissioned a mural in downtown Brownsville, created by Los Angeles-based artist Teddy Kelly. Shortly after its completion, graffiti appeared beneath the mural with the message, “Gentrified, Stop SpaceX.” The incident garnered extensive media attention, prompting a swift response from local authorities that resulted in arrests and immediate action. Notably, then Mayor Trey Mendez took the extraordinary step of doxing the culprit, a practice that involves publicly sharing a person’s private information for others to target. Mendez posted the arrest, revealing the individual’s name, occupation, and her association with “anti-SpaceX” news articles on Facebook.\n\nIn stark contrast, when a rainbow-colored crosswalk celebrating LGBTQ+ pride was vandalized in June, the response from authorities was notably muted. It is now November and accountability for this act remains elusive. Furthermore, despite local efforts to obtain the footage of the crosswalk’s vandalism through a public records request, the City of Brownsville has not provided the requested information.\n\nThe situation becomes even more perplexing when we consider that the requester was initially told by the Brownsville Police Department, ten days after the request was submitted and with a legal obligation to respond promptly, that the requested footage didn’t exist. However, more recently, the City Attorney mentioned that this request, submitted in August, was in the process of being referred to the office of the Attorney General as part of an ongoing investigation. This raises questions about the truthfulness of the initial denial.\n\nThe glaring discrepancy in how property damage and hate crimes are addressed prompts serious inquiries. This inconsistency underscores the preferential treatment certain individuals or causes receive, shedding light on the pervasive issue of ‘compadrismo’ (backscratching) within the community. Who are they protecting?\n\nIII. Brownsville’s Space Economy Ambitions: A Path to Economic Opportunity for Some?\n\nIn the not-so-distant past, Brownsville held high hopes of becoming the space economy’s next thriving hub, largely thanks to SpaceX’s presence. However, as highlighted in a report by Texas Public Radio, the grandiose plans for the local space economy have faltered.\n\nAmidst mounting public demands, including my own, the city initiated a compliance audit, revealing a disheartening reality. Many companies that had initially pledged to set up shop in Brownsville failed to follow through with their promises.\n\nThe city-led audit, focusing on a $1 million, two-year contract between 9Point8 Capital and the Greater Brownsville Incentives Corporation (GBIC), exposed a glaring discrepancy. It became apparent that 9Point8 Capital’s end of the contract remained unfulfilled. While business missteps can happen, the astonishing part of this story is that GBIC disbursed $250,000 within five days of signing the contract in October 2021, followed by another $250,000 in April 2022, all without substantial evidence of work or any meaningful progress. 9Point8 Capital’s founder, Arseneau, had also entered into another agreement with GBIC through a different company, Spaced Ventures. The audit concludes that the city decided to exercise its clawback provision. Has the money been recouped?\n\nBut the situation doesn’t stop there. Despite the lack of genuine impact on the city’s economic landscape, officials persisted in attending conferences and perpetuating the illusion, including a hefty sum of $28,573.37 to sponsor the SPACECOM Expo in 2022.\n\nWhat was the purpose of such a façade? Here’s where it gets even more disconcerting. The then GBIC’s Director of Business Recruitment, Retention & Expansion, Ramiro Aleman, has since moved on to become the Chief Operating Officer of the San Benito Economic Development Corp. The then GBIC’s Executive Director, Helen Ramirez, now holds the influential position of City Manager, allegedly the most powerful role in Brownsville. Even the overseeing board of directors, with John Cowen at the helm, now serves as the Mayor.\n\nSo, when the space industry was touted as a beacon of job opportunities, it did indeed deliver, but the distribution was far from equitable. The city’s institutions appear to have favored corporate and personal interests at the expense of addressing crucial community needs.\n\nResidents must reflect upon why local leaders too readily fund outsider business ventures while turning a blind eye to the pressing issues affecting the city’s population.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe lamentable state of Brownsville’s local institutions serves as a stark reminder of the enduring presence of backroom politics, legacy families wielding power, ‘compadrismo,’ and a concerning lack of accountability. The selective attention given to cases of vandalism and the negligence in addressing critical issues, such as the detention of an 11-year-old, necessitate a thorough reevaluation of the city’s priorities and its commitment to justice.\n\nThe very heart of Brownsville pulsates with its diverse and vibrant community, rather than exclusive interests. Accountability, transparency, and fairness must supplant ‘compadrismo’ and selective enforcement if Brownsville truly wants to create an environment where it can retain and grow its own talent."
