        "text": "Fantastic!!!!!!!\n\nIf America knew about Manny and knew about the care, you would not be able to get an appointment. A friend of mine went to his clinic and told me about her wonderful experience. I thank God she did. The cost is fantastic! but it only starts there. When you contact Manny, he will check Southwest fights and circle the ones that work best, he emails you, his recommendation. He will guide you on what hotel to stay in and when you fly in Manny will pick you up at the airport, take you to the clinic over the border, he will carry you to the hotel and if you need to return to the clinic, he will pick you up again until your treatment is complete. Manny delivers you to the airport when you are ready. I have gone several times over the years and Manny and his team have been fantastic. A couple of weeks ago my front tooth broke that held a bridge that Manny's dentist completed. Manny told me he would warranty their work!!!!!!! I still expected to get a small bill. When I got to Harlingen Texas where Manny picks you up, he rolled out the red carpet and had his usual full-service treatment and at the end, we walked straight out the door. He never even mentioned payment!!!!!!! Wow!!!!!!! I gave his team a nice tip but that was all I spent, and it was not expected. I did pay for travel but in America, it would have cost me all my savings. God Bless Manny and his team!!!!!!! This year will be by far easier for me and my family because of them.\n\nThis clinic had really good reviews, so I chose them for my dental implants. The place was a little out of the way compared to some of the other clinics in the neighborhood (it was on the second floor) and it would have been hard to find had I not been taken there by the hand. I’ve been to a number of clinics in Mexico and this one was exceptionally clean. The dentist was on on time and the appointment went ahead exactly as scheduled. I remember seeing a limited price list online, but I was quoted the real price after they took x-rays of my mouth. The dentist did a wonderful job inserting the implants, but there was something else they managed to do for me that was even more exceptional.\n\nA while back I booked an appointment with a different clinic to have crowns done. After they examined me, the dentist there refused to do it. He told me it couldn’t be done, and that it wouldn’t last. When I visited Extreme Makeovers and got their opinion on the crown, they warned me that it might not last for many years (2-4 years perhaps). I decided to go through with it anyway - in the worst case it would cost me 50 bucks per year for the crown, and that’s a great deal in my opinion.\n\nWe did the procedure and it was a great success. Dr. Cooke also managed to do something else for me. Some time ago I’d had an implant done at a different dental practice and it failed (the site had to be closed and grafted). I asked Dr. Cooke if he's able to do a single-stage implant for me (most dentists are hesitant to go forth with this because the failure rate is high). The doctor agreed to do the immediate load implant. It’s been two months now, and the implant is still fine.The likelihood of failure is pretty remote at this stage of the game. I also had a deep cleaning here, which was fairly well done, even though it hurt a little bit. The job was thorough and he performed the deep clean in two stages. When we were done with the first session, Dr. Cooke told me, “Now your gums are bleeding. You’ll come back in two days and we’ll finish the job.” When I returned, we completed the cleaning. I was immensely pleased with the services they offered me at this fantastic clinic. I managed to get work done here that other dentists couldn’t do for me. It was a great experience. Such superb workmanship!\n\nCrowns and bridges\n\nWell it has been about a month since getting my crowns replaced at the Stetic Dental Center and wanted to provide a \"testimonial' if you will about my overall experience with the Doctors and staff and the great work that they did. First of all everything went even better than expected. I was picked up by Manny at the airport and brought to my U.S. Motel from the list they provided, of which I save 40% due to the centers relationship with them. Each day I was picked up and brought the short distance across the border (about 50 yards into Mexico) to the Clinic. Once the work was completed each day they returned me back to my room but not before taking me out to diner. Another unexpected service by my new friend Manny. We talked and exchanged stories and then he dropped me off at my room.\n\nDr. Fabian and his assistant were vary friending and began the prep work on Monday. They were great and it went better than I had expected. Pain free with just novocaine. I was impressed so I decided to have them do something that I had wanted to do for a long time. To crown 5 crooked worn lower front teeth. The Doctor gave me a quote for the addition work. With the planned work including whitening and a night guard it came to $2600! That was for 10 planned crowns (3 bridges included) the 5 additional crowns a filling and all of the work described. $150 per crown! Unbelievable! Last year I paid $2200 for just one crown with a root canal for my daughter here in Washington.\n\nI have been to Mexico to get crowns before and paid more and without these results. In fact, the work they did at Stetic compared to the dental work done here in the States. I tell all of my friends about them and some are planning their trip in the fall. I would recommend everyone to Stetic Dental!\n\n2 extractions, bone graft, 7 implants, temporary partial\n\nI went to Nuevo Progresso for treatment in late September and the treatment I received from the staff at Stetic was the best I have ever had at any dentist's office in the states. I felt like someone special the entire two days! To begin with, I had the date wrong and went to my appointment a day early, but within 5 minutes they handed me the phone and it was Manny! He told me they would get right to me anyway and everything was squared away. And they did! Dr.Guerrero, Sergio(translator/assistant), and the entire staff knew I was nervous and they made me feel comfortable right from the start. The price was exactly that which was quoted, and I actually had much more work completed than I thought I would be able to with the amount I had to put down. I had two extractions,7 implants, bone grafting, and was fitted with a provisionary that looks very nice! I had no pain whatsoever as Dr. Guerrero was gentle and took his time. He and Sergio translated everything, every step of the way. I am anxious to return to Nuevo Progresso in March to have my permanents implants placed, and enjoy a nice meal as well! Did I forget to mention, I ate an entire meal on the second day before heading back to the states! Stetic will be my choice dentist for as long as I live. I will be happy to see everyone upon my next visit.\n\nMini Implants and dentures\n\nI highly recommend Stetic Dental. These folks are a good deal. Right from the onset I was treated as if I were their only customer, all my questions were answered, dental costs were agreed upon and I was made to feel comfortable.\n\nThe cost for my dental work was 70 percent of the total cost quoted by several US dentists. In the end the quality of the work that I had done was as good or better then what I would have received in the States.\n\nThe offices and equipment were spotless, The staff was friendly and professional. There was no language barrier. I was able to communicate easily and when necessary John was there to help interpret.\n\nMy dentist was Dr. Guerrero. He was gentle and went out of his way to assure my comfort and took the time to explain the procedural process. He was simply fantastic!\n\nAs I write this review I am sitting here with a broad smile. It has been awhile since I could do this. They truly did a very fine job with the mini implants and dentures. I should have went sooner!\n\nMr. Manny Huerta Payán was the person I dealt with from the beginning. He was also the person that picked me up at my front door and drove me to the clinic. Crossing the border was no sweat and at no time was I uncomfortable being in Progreso MX.\n\nThe people were friendly almost to a fault. Those that I had dealings with were very nice. US citizens were walking about the streets shopping and having a good time. I saw NO issue of concern regarding my safety or the safety of other Americans walking about. The stories in the local news about Progreso's safe environment were accurate.\n\nSince I live here in Weslaco TX year round I am making Stetic Dental my \"family dentist\" and my wife and I will return to them for any dental work either of us may need in the future.\n\nImmediate Implant Placement\n\nI do recommend this clinic. Just rest assured that as with any dental treatment there may be fever, soreness, redness and pain. I think maybe I have some exposed bone and should have had some stitches. It has been one week and I am still having swelling and pain from my implant. Dr. Samuel Tacher did the work and I will say when I heal up then I can give the a ok. He was a jokester.Dont know what the price will be. I have not talked to the doctor but would like for him to contact me to see if this swelling and pain is normal. I am hoping to go to my local dentist soon just to get an xray and another opinion. I am 7.5 hr from Dr. Tacher's so I can't just drive there. The dental staff was just wonderful and I wish I could work there with them. The office was gorgeous and clean. The pharmacia was downstairs first floor so being chaffeured and having the pharmacia and dental clinic so close, there was no sense of fear because you are right with Manny the whole time.\n\nWere you pleased with the treatment?\n\nI chose to have work done at Stetic after my husband contacted them about doing major bridge work for himself. I had three very large amalgam fillings that I had been told by my local dentist needed to be crowned because of their size and age. Rocio Evelyn Casteneda V. DDS did my crown preparation work in about 3 hours. She also whitened a tooth that had yellowed and replaced 3 white fillings in my two lower front teeth and corrected a chip in one of them that my local dentist said could not be done. My three crowns were place and bite adjusted on the second day. She was very attentive to my comfort and concerns. I am very pleased with the work done by this very professional doctor and her staff. I was rather apprehensive about entering Mexico because of all the negative information about violence in the border cities. My concerns were immediately quashed by Manny Huerta when he picked us up at our hotel. Mr. Huerta is a great asset to the clinic and makes every individual feel special. I received my crowns and final work the second day. The work that was done cost less($605.00) than the co pay amount of one crown that I recently had done in Oklahoma at my local dentist with insurance.Not only was I pleased with my treatment,I was elated at the price.\n\nWould you recommend the clinic?\n\nYes I would recommend this clinic to anyone. I have made a point to shown off my new dental work and have already recommended the clinic and Dra. Casteneda to several individuals both there in Texas and since returning to Oklahoma have recommended the clinic to others here. The equipment and facilities were as clean and modern as here in the US.\n\nWould you return for further treatment?\n\nAbsolutely. I feel that I received more individualized attention at the Stetic Clinic than I receive at my local dentist where I feel just like another number of get her in and out as quickly as possible and I wait weeks for an appointment and placement of crowns."
