        "text": "I wholeheartedly thank the Virgin of Juquila with the present retablo for the good sales of my clay pots and casseroles. I go to sell them at the market every weekend, and people buy them a lot.\n\nJosefa Rodriguez, Oaxaca\n\nI was heartbroken because my son Antonio wasn’t married and I worried that the day I’m gone he’d be left alone. I thank Saint Anthony of Padua for hearing my prayers because my son finally fell in love with a good girl. May you be blessed.\n\nBlanca Lopez ~ Zacatecas, Mexico\n\nI was in despair because my dishes always turned out horrible because I didn’t know how to cook. I asked Saint Paschal Baylon for help. Now my husband is very happy with my food, and he even bought me new pans and pots. Now my dishes come out very delicious, and I give thanks for that.\n\nJosefina Lopez\n\nMichoacan, 1942\n\nI’m a high preparatory school math teacher, and I had a student who was flirting with me so that I would give her good grades because she was a bad student. I thank Saint Thomas Aquinas for the principal gave me another class because the girl began to wear daring clothes and harass me which could bring me professional problems and with my wife as well.\n\nRafael Barrios ~ Monterrey, Nuevo Leon\n\nA young man Florentino Mendoza thanks the Lord of Chalma for helping him to successfully perform the Pass of Death at the cowboy championship and get the first prize for his team “The Golden Cowboys”, for which he dedicates this humble retablo.\n\nTetepango, Hidalgo\n\nRoberta Bolaños dedicate the present retablo to Saint Paschal thanking him for her sister-in-law is treating her well now, because she used to make her life hell and treated her very badly.\n\nPachuca, 1925\n\nThe other day I went to see my animals in the corral. To my fright I found several goats dead. I remembered the people in the town spoken about the Chupacabra going loose. I fervently asked Saint Benedict to protect my cattle, and thanks to his divine help this horrible scene never happened again.\n\nCarmelo Armenta ~ Paracuaro, Michoacan\n\nI dedicate this present exvoto with eternal gratitude to Saint Patrick for getting the scholarship from Inter American University of the State of Nuevo Leon so I could play the sport I’ve been so much passionate since childhood—American football.\n\nJose Antonio Garza, Nuevo Leon\n\nI didn’t expect to inherit small corn fields after one of my distant uncle’s death. But my mother gave me an idea to sell sweet corn on the streets. I thank Saint Martin the Cavalryman because the sales are going well and I’m much better as a vendor than as a farmer.\n\nFelipe Carrion ~ Iztapalapa, Mexico City\n\nI give due thanks to Saint Anthony of Padua because Romualdo Reyes, the most handsome young man in the town, payed attention to me and asked my father for my hand in marriage. Despite my neighbors’ jealousy, our love will be growing more and more for which I dedicate this exvoto, with all my heart.\n\nColumba Zaragoza ~ Saltillo, Coahuila\n\nThe other night my friend and I went to the bar to drink some tequilas. But we lost control, and after a while got so drunk and sentimental talking about our fails in love that when we realized what was going on we were pretty close to each another and ready to kiss. We thank the Lord of Chalma for we have our conscience back and didn’t do it. We remain being friends as usual.\n\nJuan N. and Silvestre R. ~ Tonala, Jalisco\n\nWe infinitely thank Saint Isidor Labourer for helping me and my wife to buy a tractor which will help us a lot in our work in the field. May you be blessed.\n\nHonorato and Ponciana Lopez\n\nTlaxcala, Mexico\n\nFlorencio Dominguez had too much mezcal and got so drunk he fell asleep in the mountains. In the middle of the night, he was awaken by laments, and he saw, with fear, the Weeping Woman in front of him. He infinitely thanks Saint Michael the Archangel with this humble retablo for he was able to run away safe and sound and promises to not drink ever again.\n\nTepoztlan, Morelos"
