        "text": "GREINER PACKAGING\n\nNew plant in Mexico / European managers and machinery start-up with products for strategic customer / Eyes on the Americas\n\nGreiner Assistec, a subsidiary of Austrian packaging producer Greiner Packaging International (Kremsmünster; www.greiner-gpi.com), has begun operations at its new plant in Monterrey / Mexico. The new facility, which has rented floor space of 2,000m2 with an option to expand, “gives us interesting opportunities on the markets in Northern and Latin America,” said Willi Eibner, CEO of Greiner Packaging International. Production is beginning with 40 employees and state-of-the-art European injection moulding machines that will be complemented later with “more new technology.” The company has an option to double its production space.\n\nIn the start-up phase, the Mexican production facility – Greiner’s first outside Austria – will manufacture specialised solutions for a long-time European strategic cooperation partner. In the medium term, the local arm aims to create partnerships with global players from the electronics, automotive and household industries. Its long-term goal is to become established in the North- and South American food- and non-food packaging sectors, said Eiber. Within five years, the CEO expects the company’s annual sales in Mexico to rise to more than EUR 10m.\n\nEibner said Greiner regards the Monterrey region as a “platform for other divisions,” with European management and “top-motivated and qualified employees from our management pool.” The Austrian packaging producer is one of the European market leaders with a workforce of 2,878 and annual sales of EUR 357m, accounting for 35% of total Greiner Group sales.\n\n15.12.2010 Plasteurope.com [218096-0]\n\nPublished on 15.12.2010"
