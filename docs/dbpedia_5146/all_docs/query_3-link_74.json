In school we are learning about Sinter Klaas, but I want to ask you what I would like for Christmas. This Christmas, I would like for everyone to be in a household with their families.

I want parents all over the world to have a job and get paid enough to feed their family. Everyone is struggling to pay pills, please help everyone. It would be stunning if the poor could have homes this year instead of sleeping on a bench or in a tent. I would like for all of these wishes to be granted, so the world could be a better place for everyone and for me.\n\nLove,\n\nMatthew Gurvara\n\nDr. Garza Elem.\n\n5th Grade\n\nDear Santa,\n\nHow are you doing?
