        "text": "Rolando Rosabal Dominguez, 44 , of San Antonio was arrested for allegedly using re-encoded charge cards to fraudulently obtain almost 100 gallons of diesel fuel worth $250 and driving the vehicle containing it on a public roadway in the San Antonio area.\n\nWhile conducting surveillance, officers reportedly observed the suspect filling his pickup truck with diesel three times in less than an hour at three different convenience stores in Bexar County. During a subsequent traffic stop in Leon Valley, investigators discovered an auxiliary tank concealed in the bed of the suspect’s pickup truck containing the diesel fuel, reports show.\n\nThey also reported confiscating nine “cloned” debit and credit cards. The suspect claimed to have purchased the diesel with a different card.\n\nFor failing to pay the backup tax, Dominguez is charged with motor fuel tax evasion. He also is charged with transporting motor fuel without proper shipping documents. Each offense is a second-degree felony punishable by two to 20 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine.\n\nCID participated in a task force including the Texas Department of Public Safety, San Antonio Police Department and the U.S. Secret Service in the investigation of the case, which is pending prosecution in Bexar County.\n\nOrlando Goulet-Nazario, 31 , of Houston was arrested for allegedly using a re-encoded charge card to fraudulently obtain almost 24 gallons of diesel fuel worth almost $61 from a Katy supermarket.\n\nLocal police reportedly witnessed the suspect at the store’s fueling station use a “cloned” card to obtain diesel fuel and pump it directly into an auxiliary tank concealed in the bed of his pickup truck. Reports show that the vehicle had been outfitted to receive, transport and dispense motor fuel.\n\nFor failing to pay the backup tax, Goulet-Nazario is charged with motor fuel tax evasion, a second-degree felony punishable by two to 20 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. He also is charged with unlawful use of a criminal instrument (i.e., the truck), a third-degree felony punishable by two to 10 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine.\n\nIn addition, local authorities have charged him with fraudulent use/possession of 10 or more credit/debit cards, also a second-degree felony.\n\nCID assisted the Katy Police Department in the investigation of the case, which is pending prosecution in Fort Bend County.\n\nGoulet-Nazario already is under indictment for allegedly using re-encoded credit cards to unlawfully obtain more than 90 gallons of diesel fuel from a chain convenience store in Baytown. Local police confiscated 56 “cloned” cards from the defendant and an accomplice last October.\n\nHe is charged with possessing more than 50 counterfeit credit cards, a first-degree felony punishable by imprisonment for five to 99 years or life and a fine of up to $10,000, along with engaging in a motor fuel transaction without a license, a third-degree felony.\n\nThose cases are pending prosecution in Harris County.\n\nCarlos Lazar Hernandez Cuesta, 34 , of Houston was arrested for allegedly using a re-encoded charge card to fraudulently obtain 39 gallons of diesel fuel worth almost $100 from a Katy supermarket.\n\nLocal police reportedly witnessed the suspect at the store’s fueling station use a “cloned” card to obtain diesel fuel and pump it directly into an auxiliary “bladder” concealed in the bed of his pickup truck. They discovered that the vehicle had been outfitted to receive, transport and dispense motor fuel, reports show.\n\nFor failing to pay the backup tax, Cuesta is charged with motor fuel tax evasion, a second-degree felony punishable by two to 20 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. He also is charged with unlawful use of a criminal instrument (i.e., the truck), a third-degree felony punishable by two to 10 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine.\n\nIn addition, local authorities have charged him with fraudulent use/possession of 5-10 credit/debit cards, also a third-degree felony.\n\nCID assisted the Katy Police Department in the investigation of the case, which is pending prosecution in Fort Bend County.\n\nPedro Rojero Jr., 42 , of Fabens was indicted for allegedly transporting 228 gallons of dyed diesel fuel in two pickup trucks in the summer of 2017.\n\nHe allegedly filled external fuel tanks on the vehicles with diesel obtained from an oil company storage facility using his and another's agricultural user permits. Evidence shows that the defendant illegally acquired more than 200,000 gallons of untaxed fuel and took it into Mexico in 2016-17.\n\nRojero is charged with transporting motor fuel without a cargo manifest or shipping document, a second-degree felony punishable by imprisonment for two to 20 years and a fine of up to $10,000.\n\nIn Texas, non-taxable diesel is dyed red to distinguish it from taxable diesel.

Those charges were dismissed in the plea agreement, but they must attend an anti-theft class at their own expense.\n\nLast October, the pair used re-encoded charge cards to unlawfully obtain diesel fuel at a Brookshire truck stop. A cardholder alerted local police when his bank notified him that one of his cards was in use.\n\nDuring their subsequent arrest, investigators found in their possession “cloned” cards used in the transactions. They also discovered an auxiliary tank concealed in the bed of the pickup truck used to store the fuel.\n\nCID assisted the Brookshire Police Department in the investigation of the case.\n\nAlicia Gomez Coronel, 42 , an El Paso store manager, has been indicted for failing to produce tobacco invoices and sales records required by state tax law.\n\nThe offense of refusing inspection of premises and records is a third-degree felony punishable by two to 10 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine.\n\nIn October 2018, Coronel was managing Mandi’s Grocery when CID investigators attempted to inspect the premises.

Perez allegedly diverted the fuel to Ferras from his employer’s fuel cargo tanker truck destined for other customers.\n\nOfficers conducting surveillance on Feb. 26 reportedly observed Ferras driving his van from Odessa to Martin County, where he and the driver of a service truck met Perez. He then allegedly “short-loaded” dyed diesel from a tank truck belonging to an Odessa fuel distributorship where he worked as a driver. Ferras then transported the stolen dyed diesel to a residence in Odessa and dispensed the fuel from a 275-gallon “tote” into several containers, according to reports.\n\nInvestigators inspecting the premises discovered a combined total of approximately 1,100 gallons of dyed diesel in the “saddle” tanks of two parked trucks and three 275-gallon plastic totes. Along with the tote, Ferras’ van reportedly modified to transport bulk loads of motor fuel contained hoses and a nozzle and pump. Investigators also discovered dyed diesel in an 80-gallon auxiliary tank in the bed of a pickup truck driven by Camacho, who arrived during the inspection.\n\nFerras reportedly claimed that he accumulates the fuel because he unloads and filters it when performing truck maintenance. Camacho said he was acquiring the dyed diesel for his trucking business, according to reports. It reportedly was selling for more than a dollar less than the regular rate per gallon.\n\nIn Texas, non-taxable diesel is dyed red to distinguish it from taxable diesel. Red dyed diesel is authorized almost exclusively for off-road, agricultural use by permit-holders only.\n\nFor unlawfully obtaining untaxed fuel, the three co-defendants each are charged with motor fuel tax evasion.

During an ensuing traffic stop, investigators discovered two auxiliary fuel tanks partially concealed in the truck bed.\n\nThey also confiscated a digital information storage card on which was stored 27 credit and debit card numbers determined not to belong to the suspect, according to reports. The suspect denied owning the card.\n\nHernandez-Valdes is charged with engaging in a motor fuel transaction without a transporter license, a third-degree felony punishable by two to 10 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine.

Because the victim is older than 65 years, the offense was upgraded from a felony punishable by confinement in a state jail for six months up to two years to a third-degree felony punishable by two to 10 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine.\n\nA related motor fuel tax evasion charge, a second-degree felony punishable by two to 20 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine, was dismissed in the plea agreement.\n\nIn February 2018, using the “cloned” card, Paraleda pumped fuel into an auxiliary tank concealed in his pickup truck.
