        "text": "Starting with modern injection moulding machines\n\nEibner explains, “In Monterrey (Apodaca), we have rented a hall of about 2,000 sq.m. on a long-term basis. Moreover, we have the option of prolonging the rental agreement and more than doubling the production area.” The managing director of the new independent subsidiary is Gerald Bernecker. By the beginning of 2011, Greiner Assistec S.A. de C.V. plans to employ a staff of 40 people. On the new premises, state-of-the-art European injection moulding machines reserves are being used and will be complemented with more new technology within the next years.\n\nApplying the European recipe for success in Northern and Latin America\n\nThe first company location outside Europe plays another important role for Greiner Packaging’s deliberations. Eibner points out: “We regard the Monterrey area as platform for other divisions, too. A European management and top motivated and qualified employees from our management pool will ensure that we will be able to apply our recipe for success on the markets in Northern and Latin America as well.”\n\nA turnover of more than ten million euros within five years\n\nIn the start-up phase, the company in Mexico is producing specialised solutions for a long-lasting strategic partner we have successfully been cooperating with in Europe. In the medium term, Greiner Assistec S.A. de C.V. will aim at creating partnerships with global players from the electronics, automotive and household industries. The long term goal is to become well established in Northern and Latin America in the food- and non-food sectors using a balanced mix of technology. Eibner names clear target values, “In five years from now, our annual sales in Mexico should amount to more than ten million euros.”\n\nThe Austrian packaging producer Greiner Packaging International continues to push on with its policy of internationalisation and opens a new facility in Mexico. Willi Eibner, CEO of Greiner Packaging International, is pleased to say, “The new facility of our division Greiner Assistec in Monterrey gives us interesting opportunities on the markets in Northern and Latin America.”\n\nOn 01 December 2010, the new company Greiner Assistec S.A. de C.V. commenced full operation. The city of Apodaca with about 400,000 inhabitants – a municipality within Monterrey in the state of Nuevo León (northeastern Mexico) – was chosen as the location."
