        "text": "Guys I‚Äôm going to introduce you to one of my favorite eats in Davao: Golgi Gui Grill!! *fan girl shriek*\n\nSo my aunt, Tita Nina, and my cousins, Mikha and Ea decided to try out this new resto for lunch. Turns out its made it to one of my favorites list.\n\nGolgi Gui‚Äôs food is based on Korean cuisine. For some background, ‚ÄúGogi‚Äù is short for ‚ÄúBulgogi‚Äù, a famous Korean marinated, fried, beef sirloin dish.\n\nGolgi Gui‚Äôs main dish is, you guessed it! Bulgogi. But not just your traditional beef sirloin! This neat resto also features marinated pork, chicken, and much more things to fry!\n\nSo here‚Äôs how it works:\n\nWhen you get there, there WILL be a line. You will be asked to wait outside in the waiting area until the hostess will call you.\n\nTip: The resto opens at 11am, so if you‚Äôre there at least 10 minutes before, you will beat the line.\n\nThen you will be seated at a table with this interesting circular griddle thing, where you will COOK YOUR OWN FOOD. This is that table we were seated at. There is a ventilation tube for the som\n\nHere‚Äôs the best part: At 250 pesos per head (about $5.50), you will get unlimited bulgogi beef, chicken and pork to cook, and unlimited side dishes; rice, ramen noodles, kimchi, cooked bean sprouts, and atchara (a pickle made from unripe papaya and carrots, popular in the Philippines). For an additional 65 pesos (about $1.45) you can get a plate of unlimited seafood as well! #foodsteals\n\nAside from the strict seating, and the awkward arrangement in the corner by being next to the very loud TV, I really enjoyed this resto.\n\nThe marinade was delicious, the meats always stayed juicy, and the fact that everything was unlimited for less than $8 a person just made this the number 1 place for me to go.\n\nI know it all sounds too good to be true, but I promise that if you visit Golgi Gui Grill You will NOT be disappointed.\n\nGolgi Gui may not be authentic Korean food, but it tastes Pretty Damn Delicious.\n\nThanks for reading! üôÇ Stay tuned for more food, travel, and culture posts coming soon!"
