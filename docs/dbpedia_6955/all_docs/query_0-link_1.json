        "text": "Taiwanese singer and actress (born 1989)\n\nWu YingjieTraditional Chinese吳映潔Simplified Chinese吴映洁\n\nTranscriptionsStandard MandarinHanyu PinyinWú Yìngjié\n\nEmma Wu Ying-chieh (Chinese: 吳映潔; pinyin: Wú Yìngjié; born 11 August 1989), also known as Gui Gui (Chinese: 鬼鬼; pinyin: Guǐ guǐ), is a Taiwanese singer and actress.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nWu Ying-chieh, nicknamed Gui Gui, was born in Keelung City, Taiwan on 11 August 1989, and is the only child of divorced parents.[2][3] In her early childhood, the family moved frequently, and this resulted in her having to attend five different elementary schools. Wu briefly attended the Dao Jiang Senior High School of Nursing & Home Economics (臺北市私立稻江高級護理家事職業學校) before transferring to Zhuangjing Senior Vocational School in the Xindian District of Taipei, where she became classmates with JPM's Wang Zi.[4]\n\nRegarding the origin of her alias, Gui Gui (literally: Ghost), Wu has explained that she is \"full of reckless things\" (Chinese: 古靈精怪) [5] and adopted a phonological pun on the Chinese idiom (Chinese: \"鬼”靈精怪) to describe herself as having an eccentric or impish personality.\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\n2005–2009: Variety and musical debut\n\n[edit]\n\nIn November 2005, Wu debuted as one of the original members of Blackie's Teenage Club (Chinese: 我愛黑澀會), a variety show seeking talents for the television network, Channel [V]. After three rounds of casting, Wu was recruited to join Hei Se Hui Mei Mei (Chinese: 黑澀會美眉), a nine-member Taiwanese girl group established c. 2006. Though the group's name was a clever play on the words \"Hei She Hui\" (Chinese: 黑社會; lit. 'black society', 'triad') and \"Mei Mei\" (Chinese: 妹妹; lit. 'sisters'), it was renamed Hey Girl (Chinese: 黑Girl) after a label change and the launch of their first self-titled album in August 2008.\n\nIn April 2009, Channel V's director, Andy Chang, responded to rumors of Wu leaving his agency. He expressed that though she was unlikely to renew her contract, the singer would partake in group activities per usual since Hey Girl's record contract did not belong to Channel V. Yet, despite Chang's statement, Wu was notably absent from their album promotions, and on 6 May 2009, he confirmed her departure from both Hey Girl and Channel V's management.\n\n2007–2015: Transition into acting\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2007, Wu announced her acting debut with the idol drama, Brown Sugar Macchiato. However, the drama was viewed more as an \"introductory chapter\" to the two groups, Hey Girl and Lollipop F, than a major production.[6] After thirteen episodes, the series ended on 7 October 2007, and an official soundtrack was released with songs from Lollipop and Hey Girl.[7]\n\nIn 2008, Wu starred in Mysterious Incredible Terminator, opposite of Aaron Yan from Fahrenheit and Alien Huang. After the completion of M.I.T., Wu and Aaron, both widely praised for their on-screen chemistry and closeness, were to co-star in Taiwanese drama Momo Love. Yet, filming was halted due to Yan's scheduling conflicts, and once resumed, Wu and Aaron were replaced by Cyndi Wang and Jiro Wang, respectively.\n\nFollowing a two-year hiatus, Wu signed with Polyface Entertainment Media Group in 2011 and returned to the small screen with I, My Brother (我和我的兄弟·恩). Later that year, Wu was cast in the television version of Painted Skin (TV series),[8] in collaboration with Fiona Sit, Chen Yi Rong, and Li Zhong Han. It was also this opportunity that allowed Wu to shift her focus to the Chinese market.\n\nIn 2012, Wu debuted on the big screen with a three part-film series, The Four, starring Ronald Cheng, Anthony Wong, Deng Chao, and Liu Yifei. In February 2013, she was cast in the Korean reality show, We Got Married with Ok Taecyeon, of South Korean boy band 2PM, as her virtual husband. Regarding this experience, she has commented, \"I feel thankful that you found me. I think the fact that I was able to do this show was a gift from the up above.\"[9]\n\nIn the consecutive years, Wu has starred in Chinese TV dramas: Legend of Lu Zhen, Incisive Great Teacher (犀利仁師), A Different Kind of Pretty Man (不一樣的美男子), Roommate Diaries (一男三女合租記), The Four (2015 TV series), The Girl Wearing Tassel Earrings (戴流蘇耳環的少女) and The Legend of the Flying Daggers (飛刀又見飛刀 (2016年電視劇)).\n\n2016–present: Musical comeback\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 7 March 2016, Wu signed with CJ E&M and returned to the music scene.[10][11] In preparation for her Korean debut, she underwent a rigorous 3-month training that included vocal, choreography and Korean lessons. On 26 September, Wu released her first official music video, Sugar Rush, and on 7 October, she launched her first self-titled EP, GEMMA.[12] Introducing the extended play, Wu stated that GEMMA represented a new identity. \"G\" was derived from her nickname, Ghost (Chinese: 鬼鬼), while Emma is her proclaimed English name.[13]\n\nIn June 2017, Wu parted ways with CJ E&M,[14] and established her personal agency Gemma Wu Studio. In October of the same year, she released the single \"Knock Knock Knock\" after investing NT$8 million in production works herself.[citation needed]\n\nIn August 2019, Wu joined Avex Taiwan and released the single \"Love Me Love Me\" in celebration of her thirtieth birthday.[15] On 22 September 2020, she released her first studio album GX to commemorate her 15th debut anniversary.\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\n[16][17]\n\nTelevision series\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Network Notes 2007 Brown Sugar Macchiato Gui Gui (as herself) FTV, Star Chinese Channel Acting Debut 2008 The Legend of Brown Sugar Chivalries Guardian of Cult Star TV Cameo, Ep. 13 Mysterious Incredible Terminator Li Xiao Xing / Tian Mo Xing GTV Female Lead 2009 K.O.3an Guo Huang Yue Ying FTV / GTV Cameo, Ep. 44–46 2011 I, My Brother Lu Wei Wei CTV Female Lead Painted Skin Xia Bing TVS4, ZJTV, GTV,\n\nShenzhen Satellite TV Supporting Role Love Recipe Wang Mei Ya CTV Supporting Role 2012 Dream in Blue Shen Xiao Qi ZJTV Supporting Role Summer Fever Chen Wen Qing / Chen Tian Qing CTV Female Lead 2013 Female Prime Minister He Dan Niang Hunan TV Supporting Role 2014 Incisive Great Teacher Song Wen Wen Dragon TV Supporting Role[18] A Different Kind of Pretty Man Tong Yu Chen Hunan TV Female Lead Roommate Diaries Li Mei Dai Supporting Role[19] 2015 The Four (2015 TV series) Ling Yi Yi Supporting Role[20] The Girl Wearing Tassel Earrings Ruan Qing Tian Hunan TV, Anhui TV Female Lead Slacker's Food Diary Zhang An An iQiyi, Viu (streaming media) Female Lead[21] 2016 The Legend of the Flying Daggers Fang Ke Ke Youku Supporting Role TBA The Fairy Lady Chen Xian Qi Female Lead\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2011 The Four Ding Dang Supporting Role 2013 The Four II 2014 The Four III 2015 Dream Holiday Dani Guest appearance 2016 Days of Our Own Chen Yinuo[22] Supporting Role 2018 More than Blue Bonnie Guest appearance 2021 My Fairy Girl Wu Xiao Xue Female Lead\n\nVariety shows\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Notes 2005–2009 Blackie's Teenage Club Ep. 79-958 2006–2007 Mo Fan Bang Bang Tang Assistant host 2007 Mei Mei Pu Pu Feng DJ 2007–2008 Fashion in House Guest host 2009 Golden Taxi Game GX Mi Gu Celebrity School 2010 Ultimate Player 2011 Genius Go Go Go 2013 We Got Married World Ver. with Ok Taecyeon 2016 Who's the Murderer Season 1 Guest 2017 Who's the Murderer Season 2 Fans!
