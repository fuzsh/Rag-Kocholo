It seems to me its so time consuming.\n\nI think there must be a different way, like do i need to make a webserver so it can read and dont need to put static to the html everywhere?\n\nThank you\n\nSorry for bad info.\n\nSo i downloaded\n\nAnd put all the files where supposed to be. But on each page i need to rewrite and put static.\n\notherwise\n\nGET http://127.0.0.1:8000/plugins/chart.js/Chart.min.js net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)\n\nThe idea of base static html is okay but am still thinking would it work if i put gunicorn with ngix and afterwords it will see the path. Am i right?As it would be webserver the path will be there rightaway.\n\nAnd for me only to fix my DB stuff imports\n\nWhat is ussual way for example for you? Are you using this static all the time?\n\nFor example you want to add a picture somewhere. in the text (as not in base static file)\n\nI have never used a GUI web builder that was worth the effort to put into it. It always costs me more time than it could ever save. There is a lot of editing that needs to be done to add tags and context data.\n\nIâ€™ve yet to see one that I would recommend using with Django."
