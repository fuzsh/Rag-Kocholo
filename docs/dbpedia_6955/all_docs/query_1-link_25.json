        "text": "There comes a time every year that I start to give my winter sweaters, the cold shoulder. We get a little taste of spring and I start buying spring clothes like it’s going out of style.\n\nBanana Republic recently had their friends and family sale and I picked up this cold shoulder top, along with a few other items. When I first tried on the top, I was like, meh. I considered sending it back, but the more I tried it on with other clothes in my closet, and did totally normal things, like take pictures of myself in it, in front of the mirror, the more I liked it. So, the little light blue cold shoulder top, joined my closet.\n\nAnother successful purchase, I’m really excited about, are these Marc Fisher wedges. I mentioned in my last, oh, hey girl, post that I ordered this pair and had to return them because they just didn’t look right on me. Then, I ordered this Jeffrey Campbell pair, which are even more gorgeous in person, but sadly, they were too big for these 4.5, sometimes a 5, size feet. I also tried the Steve Madden dupes at DSW, which were also too big. The struggle. So, I decided to give another style of March Fisher wedges a try. Since this style came up to the ankle, as opposed to the thick band across the toes, I hoped they would be a better fit, and they were! This style isn’t as wide as the style I previously purchased, which made for a better, more flattering fit, on me. They are also, so so comfortable and make me tall! Wearing them I can almost smooch my 6’2″ husband, no tippy toes involved.\n\nSince it’s not quite consistent Spring temps yet (hello cold this week), I’ve been layering my new spring additions under cardigans and sometimes, very reluctantly, still pulling out those winter sweaters. Hurry up Spring, I’m ready to say, girl bye to my winter wardrobe.\n\nWhat about you? Are you dying to wear your warm weather clothes? Did you shop the Banana Republic Friends & Family Sale?\n\n– Brooke\n\nNow, let’s…get…linking!!\n\nLink up any post you would like to show off; your outfit, home decor, recipe, workout.
