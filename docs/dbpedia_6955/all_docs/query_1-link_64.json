        "text": "Editors note: To celebrate of Caity Simmers‚Äô maiden CT victory we‚Äôve unlocked this Premium interview for everyone, enjoy:)\n\nThis week, Caity Simmers released her premiere personal project ‚ÄòToasted,‚Äô a 23-minute ode to classic surf film, her youth, and an affinity for the tools.\n\nAfter the drop, ‚ÄòToasted‚Äô has received praise from our Stab Premium audience praise like:\n\n‚ÄúShe may not know it yet, but she may have just put out an edit every grom girl will watch on repeat for years to come.‚Äù ‚Äì üôÇ\n\n‚Äúfucking entertaining surfing, and killer soundtrack. looking forward to her edit ‚Äúburnt‚Äù coming out in however many years in a chapter 11-esque career transition. ‚Äì Arubaito\n\n‚Äúi didnt want it to end.‚Äù- Manbearpig\n\nEven before accepting her invite on tour, Caity has altered the playing field for the female surfer. Is your author surprised? Not a bit.\n\nI met Caity at our local jetty when she was eleven years old. Even then, riding a boog, the lines she drew were absurd. Through surf, we became good friends and developed a routine.\n\nMost mornings, at the crack of 9am, we‚Äôd drive down PCH for a surf or lot troll. Our cherished routine includes blasting Lauryn Hill, icing the imposters (you know who you are), eating Primo‚Äôs tacos, and sharing lofty thoughts about what we want to contribute to the world.\n\nCaity, a classic film geek, wanted to make a really sick surf movie. As an actual nerd at the time (a college one), I saw the void this film would fill. Both of us wanted to make it happen, but we weren‚Äôt sure how we should go about it.\n\nEight months ago, I took an editorial job at Stab. Meanwhile, Caity had some time off after telling the WSL ‚Äúthanks but no thanks.‚Äù There were no more excuses. Our first trip together was Ramble On, Australia. After that, we put our ideas into writing and hit the gas.\n\nAnd along came ‚ÄòToasted.‚Äô\n\nBelow is a conversation between two friends about the film, and so much more.\n\nStab:A few people say your edits look like they‚Äôre from the past. Do you take inspiration from old surf movies?\n\nYeah. I watch Dane Reynolds‚Äô Marine Layer stuff a lot. I watch a lot of skate and snowboard videos too, which is my main inspiration for editing. FA and Hockey X is dope. I like how they show the action part of everything. They show them all hanging out and people on the streets. I love the randomness and all the dumb stuff, it‚Äôs funny to see.\n\nWhat do you want to see more of in modern surf film?\n\nI want to see more surf videos and less people just posting their good clips right away. You‚Äôre gonna get a lot of likes on Instagram at first, but it‚Äôs gonna be sicker if you save it. Most of the time, I‚Äôm not gonna remember your Instagram clip three days later. But if it‚Äôs with a song and some other clips then people go back and watch it again.\n\nWho do you want to see more films from?\n\nEveryone. But more girls surf films especially. Right now it‚Äôs rare. There‚Äôs Frankie‚Äôs new video that Quinn edited, which is crazy and has nice music taste ‚Äî but there‚Äôs not enough.\n\nWhy do you think there are not many girl surf films?\n\nUm, I don‚Äôt know. Maybe it‚Äôs because women‚Äôs surfing has evolved later than mens.\n\nIs girl‚Äôs surfing at that level now?\n\nYeah, it‚Äôs pretty crazy. Hopefully people will stop saying ‚ÄòIt was good for a girl.‚Äô Like, Moana‚Äôs wave was fucking gnarly. That wasn‚Äôt good for a girl. That would have been good for anyone and everyone.\n\nHow do you think the media portrays women‚Äôs surfing now?\n\nI feel like women‚Äôs surfing in general is sometimes not taken too seriously. And I feel like when you‚Äôre a girl, you‚Äôre kind of pressured to try to be a model and all that shit. But it‚Äôs getting better and it‚Äôs cool to see more freedom in women‚Äôs surfing. In Jalessa‚Äôs video, ‚ÄúMacaroni in a pot,‚Äù it was sick how she directed and did the art and the music.\n\nWhat was your goal when you created Toasted?\n\nThe goal was to make people feel how I feel when I watch a surf edit. After I watch a Dane Film, I‚Äôm all hyped to go surf ‚Äî that‚Äôs how I want people to feel when they watch my film. Another goal of ‚ÄòToasted‚Äô was to make a surf film that I actually liked and would inspire people. Especially girls.\n\nWhen you started inventing ‚ÄòToasted,‚Äô Sierra Kerr, Molly Picklum, and Bella Kenworthy were on the featured list. Why them?\n\nI‚Äôm good friends with all of them, and I want to go on trips with my friends. Also, because they are at the forefront of progression.\n\nIt was actually Molly who proposed the first Mexico trip right before the US Open. She made that first trip for ‚ÄòToasted‚Äô happen. Not me, which is kind of sad, but also pretty sick. So shout-out to Pickles. Then I forced it into being a Toasted trip. [laughs]\n\nLater we were all talking about how it was the highlight of our year in terms of surf trips.\n\nWhat was so fun about it?\n\nWe were just trading off waves and singing out in the water.\n\nWhat were you singing?\n\nWe do Rihanna, Beyonce, and Justin Bieber. We just get sunburnt, do karaoke, and eat PBJ‚ÄôS.\n\nWho has the best voice?\n\nI feel like I‚Äôm definitely not it. Maybe Molly.\n\nThis was not a painless adventure, correct?\n\nYeah, I got really sunburnt. I had bubbling rashes on my knees and couldn‚Äôt walk half the time, but at least I could surf. And then I got a skin infection.\n\nA skin infection?\n\nYeah, from the dirty water. I could barely walk through the airport on the way home. Then I had to take antibiotics, which made me get more sunburnt, and then I had to go to HB everyday for the US Open where it was 90 degrees. My face was peeling off.\n\nAcid peel, very nice. So, you get back from Mexico with a little skin lift and some footage. Why did you pick the name ‚ÄòToasted?‚Äô\n\nWell, it‚Äôs from your car cause it looks like a toaster. What is it? Scion X? The thing smells horrible and it kills brain cells.\n\nPretty much since I was eleven, you would pick me up every morning to go surfing and we would pull up late to school in that thing, then leave our wetsuits in there. It steamed up the box so it just permanently smells like vile. I think you were fifteen or sixteen, so I would have to duck down every time we saw a cop. That car is a historic artifact, really.\n\nOther meanings?\n\nWhen we were in Mexico all sunburnt, we kept saying ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre toasted.‚Äô Like, when you‚Äôre all sunburnt and can‚Äôt think a single thought. And also you can toast to something.\n\nI guess this whole thing is a Toast to your year at home.\n\nYeah, there‚Äôs a lot of different meanings And in my opinion, it sounds stupid, but also cool. That was kinda the goal.\n\nAlright, so you have Mexico clips and a name. What was the next step?\n\nThe goal was to have good surfing in it, so that meant getting footage. All those trips weren‚Äôt specifically for my movie. I was still doing the ‚ÄúChallenging Series‚Äù and Stab High. So it was hard to find time for the trips.\n\nWe got really lucky with everything. It‚Äôs not like we got huge barrels and absolutely scored, but I think we got good waves for the time we had.\n\nRemember what happened when we first got to Indo?\n\nOh yeah. We went to our hotel and people followed us.\n\nYou mean the scooter mafia?\n\nYou‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs mafia, it‚Äôs not a mafia. It‚Äôs the guys who bring you the scooters.\n\nWhen we walked in our room there‚Äôs this five inch spider in the bathroom. I was like, ‚ÄòCoral look! Look!‚Äô Then the man with the moped runs into our room, and he grabs the spider with his hands and it crawls all over him. We‚Äôre both screaming at this point, but he smashes the spider and then we were chilling. I‚Äôll have that image forever.\n\nBut in Lakey Peak every morning we would wake up at 5:00 AM and it was windy.\n\nNot what we expected huh?\n\nYeah, we expected it to be offshore barrels, but I guess we shouldn‚Äôt have, because that time of year it‚Äôs windy every morning. Luckily, we still got swell and poached clips from Stab High.\n\nTalk about your Lakey Peak exit.\n\nSo two days after Stab High, I needed to be in Portugal for the Challenger Series. And we booked the wrong flights at the wrong airport. We were at the restaurant and all hanging out and it was probably like 11pm and I found out I had to leave at 1:00 AM to make it. And then I was told there were machete wars.\n\nAnd you had to drive through the machete war?\n\nYeah, there were a bunch of guys on it with the machetes at 2:00 AM. And then when we got to the airport, they wouldn‚Äôt take my mom‚Äôs card, so we sat at the airport for two hours. One of the worst travel experiences of my life.\n\nOk you get to Portugal, then what?\n\nWe met up with a filmer, Gui [Guilherme Martins], who is the homie. Most of my good clips were the days I had heats, because those were the best days of the swell. We filmed at a spot around the comp with a sick barrel. Then we met up with our friend Quinn in France which worked out because he was already there shooting Frankie‚Äôs film.\n\nWould you say Portugal and France were the luckiest part of Toasted?\n\nYeah, the luckiest part was getting waves in between the Challenging Series.\n\nMid to late November, you‚Äôre back home from Europe. At what point did you decide you were going to edit ‚ÄòToasted‚Äô yourself?\n\nBefore we had the editor lined up, we were going to send it to Nick Green, and then I decided I was going to try to organize the clips. I had them all on three different hard drives. And so we spent probably a week marking the A clips, the B clips, and the lifestyle clips.\n\nOne night I was looking at the footage and I decided to make a Mexico section. I was inspired by all the clips and Nick sent a good song.\n\nThen I showed Stab, and they liked it and asked if I wanted to edit the whole thing. Luckily, Nick is the nicest guy ever and was stoked I was editing it. I had never edited more than a five minute edit, so it was overwhelming.\n\nWhy is creative freedom so important to you?\n\nCreative freedom is important to me because I would hate to have a surf film that I‚Äôm featured in not feel like me. I wanted to have control of everything ‚Äî the editing, the music ‚Äî because that‚Äôs what makes a surf film for me. I wouldn‚Äôt want to watch a video that I don‚Äôt like.\n\nWhat‚Äôs the downside of creative freedom?\n\nThe work I guess, but I wanted to do the work.\n\nHow did it feel to work at the Stab office?\n\nIt was cool, I came in almost everyday when I was home. We had some late nights in the office jamming to music and getting stuff done, which we were all dreading at the time. But when we look back, it was fulfilling and I think I‚Äôll miss it.\n\nDo you like the flow of editing itself?\n\nI love editing. It‚Äôs fun to be able to control your videos. It‚Äôs weird because I hate watching myself, but then I edited a whole movie of myself.\n\nAlso it‚Äôs the best way to critique your surfing, I probably watched my clips 400 times each.\n\nYeah you were a 9-5‚Äôer for a moment. What was the most frustrating part?\n\nPremiere. There‚Äôs a lot I wanted to do but I didn‚Äôt know how to do it. Blake Michel [Stab‚Äôs in-house editor] taught me a more efficient way of editing ‚Äî like a bunch of shortcuts. There‚Äôs too many buttons.\n\nAlso, missing media. A couple times clips would disappear and I didn‚Äôt know where the clip was from and had no way to find it. And sometimes your computer crashes and the whole edit gets thrown away. Fuck missing media and also when your mouse starts to like make that wheel of death or whatever it‚Äôs called. Fuck the wheel of death. That thing is nightmarish.\n\nWhat else?\n\nWe had multiple songs that we really wanted to use, and we had to throw a lot out ‚Äî that was hard, because I edited the surfing to the song.\n\nThe morning we had to have it finished, one of our main songs got denied. Just random out of the freakin blue ‚Äî left field. We were crying that morning. Just melting. I took a cold shower, we went to the office, then our licensor, Lory, really helped us out. She sent a bunch of pre-approved songs and we were able to make one work.\n\nSo yeah, that was probably the low point. But it all turned out good.\n\nWhat surprised you about editing?\n\nI guess this wasn‚Äôt surprising but it takes a lot of time. More than you think it takes when you‚Äôre watching a final 20-minute film.\n\nWhat feels more rewarding? Finishing ‚ÄòToasted‚Äô or winning that CS at Snapper?\n\nUm, probably finishing ‚ÄòToasted.‚Äô\n\nWhy?\n\nI have been working on it longer. And the premiere was probably the high point. It feels like winning even though you‚Äôre not winning anything. It was my dream to have a surf premiere. We did it in Oceanside because I was born and raised there and I love Oceanside. The Moose Lodge is a pretty core location.\n\nWould you say that‚Äôs the moment this whole thing got real?\n\nYeah. It‚Äôs a vulnerable position when you‚Äôre watching all these people watching what you made. It was really scary, but it was damn sick.\n\nDo you expect to create more content while you‚Äôre on tour?\n\nI‚Äôm expecting to try and hopefully do it.\n\nYou created an Instagram called @toastedmedia760. Is that a brand?\n\nNo, it‚Äôs lighthearted right now, but maybe one day. I just want to drop some videos and see where that goes.\n\nDo you plan to continue creating girls‚Äô surf edits and spearheading that cause?\n\nYeah, I definitely plan on making more edits that feature female surfing and girl shredders or boy shredders or whoever shreds ‚Äî or if you don‚Äôt shred and just want to make cool stuff."
