        "text": "Pole vaulters agree to split gold in scenes reminiscent of Tokyo Olympics\n\nBUDAPEST, Hungary — Katie Moon wanted to split the gold. Nina Kennedy wanted to split the gold, too.\n\nThe pole vaulters knew that was possible, thanks to a pair of high jumpers who turned their tie at the Olympics two years ago into a feel-good moment where everyone walked away a winner.\n\nMoon and Kennedy did the same thing on Wednesday night at the world championships, cementing their friendship by agreeing to split the title after finishing in a tie for first place.\n\n\"I kind of looked at her and said, 'Hey girl, you maybe want to share this?\" Kennedy recounted.\n\nMoon did. She definitely did.\n\n\"What an amazing night,\" Moon said. \"I hope everyone enjoyed that one.\"\n\nThey can thank Mutaz Essa Barshim (Qatar) and Gianmarco Tamberi (Italy) for the idea.\n\nTwo years ago at the Tokyo Olympics, they paved the way to splitting a title when they finished deadlocked in the high jump. It sent Tamberi into all sorts of celebrations, including a belly-flop onto the track (Tamberi won a title of his own Tuesday night in Budapest).\n\nIn high jump and pole vault, athletes keep jumping until they miss three attempts in a row. Ties are broken by who has more misses at a certain height. If still tied, they count the number of misses through the entire final. If there's still no difference, a jump-off ensues. But when an official at the Olympics told Barshim and Tamberi that a tie was possible, they jumped at it.\n\nAnd so a precedent was set.\n\n\"It's funny because until the Olympics, I never realized you could split the gold medal,\" said Moon, the Olympic champion from the United States who now gets credit for defending her world title.\n\n\"I just didn't realize that was a thing. Coming into the meet, you don't expect that it's going to come down to something like that. And it's funny because I never knew what I would do in the moment.\"\n\nTurns out, share it.\n\nMoon and Kennedy, an Australian, missed all three tries at 4.95 meters. Right after, Moon looked at the official to gain some sort of clarification.\n\n\"He said there was going to be a jump off and I just assumed (Kennedy) would want to so I just said, 'Yeah,'\" Moon said.\n\nMoon said that only because she already had a title to herself, and she at first assumed Kennedy would want a chance to win her own, too. But Moon was exhausted. So was Kennedy, whose legs were cramping.\n\n\"And then when it looked like she maybe didn't want to (go to a jump-off), it was like, 'I don't want to, either,'\" Moon said. \"Like, 'Did we just become best friends?'\"\n\nIndeed.\n\n\"We were pushing each other to the absolute limit,\" Kennedy said. \"Absolutely incredible to share the medal with Katie Moon. We've been friends for so long, so it's super special.\n\n\"I knew I could get on the podium, but it was a miracle to get the gold. So I think a miracle happened tonight.\"\n\nKennedy thought she might have won the contest when she cleared 4.90 on her third and final attempt. Moon had to clear that height, too, or gold went exclusively to Kennedy.\n\nMoon rose to the occasion.\n\n\"I would definitely say that was my most clutch jump of all time,\" said Moon, who competed as Katie Nageotte before recently getting married. \"I think we both motivated each other.\"\n\nAs for how they might settle it down the road, well, that's to be decided.\n\n\"I guess we'll find out,\" Moon said with a laugh. \"Nina's so awesome. I'm just so happy that we both get to share this.\"\n\nViking Warholm\n\nNorway's Karsten Warholm powered to victory in the 400m hurdles Wednesday night, then put on his trademark Viking horns to celebrate his third gold medal at the world championships.\n\nTwo years ago at the Olympics, Warholm was far more established — his post-race celebrations expected fare — when he set the world record (45.94) in one of the fastest races in track history. But coming into this week, there were questions, mainly because of injuries that made him a non-factor at last year's worlds in Eugene, Oregon. \"You build yourself up, the media builds you up, and afterward, they need a disaster story to start to talk you down,\" Warholm said. \"And I just find a lot of motivation in that.\"\n\nThe evening's other unexpected moment came courtesy of Josh Kerr, who became the second British runner in two years to knock off heavy favorite Jakob Ingebrigtsen of Norway in the 1,500. Coming into the race as a 1-7 betting favorite, Ingebrigtsen woke up with a scratchy throat that kept getting worse. By the time he got to the start, he knew he was not at 100 percent.\n\nIn the night's other final, the women's 400m was a runaway for Marileidy Paulino of the Dominican Republic, who won in 48.76. She beat Natalia Kaczmarek, who finished in 49.57 to become the first man or woman from Poland to take a world medal in the 400.\n\nAgencies via Xinhua"
