        "text": "OPINION\n\nLet me ask you first: what do you do? What title do you put on the resume and why? In this article, we’ll explore how design titles and disciplines turn out to be disconnected from the real world.\n\nYou might have already encountered different attempts to distinguish between UX and UI, UX and CX, or UX and product design. Just google it, and you’ll inevitably get a bunch of “UI vs. UX designer” or “UX vs. product designer” comparison tables. Venn diagrams — those colorful overlapping circles — are especially adorable.\n\nAfter seeing a lot of such things, I noticed that they share one trait — selfishness. Designers are talking about designers, instead of the value design can bring to the world. That’s why such diagrams only serve as a topic for designers’ snobbish chatter at the office coffee machine. For the majority of people who do not live in the world of pixels, fonts, and canvases, it doesn’t ring a bell.\n\nI remember the time when I tried to “enlighten” clients and rolled my eyes at them when they confused “sacred” design terminology. Now I know for sure who creates so-called clients from hell — designers from hell. Such as me several years ago. The difference between UX, CX, UI, IxD, etc. is theoretical and often exists only in the designers’ imagination.\n\nFurthermore, design acronyms are the result of bad design. Think about this: can professionals who strive for clarity and simplicity call their jobs so unclearly that they need to explain them?\n\n“UX/UI designer” sounds as awkward as “vegetable/carrot salad” or “vehicle/bus driver”.\n\n“UX/UI” is the champion of dumbness. What does the slash mean, I wonder? So, do you do both things or one of them at a time? If these are two essential parts of one profession, why not use a single term? If these are different things, why do you do two jobs simultaneously? Moreover, why do two elements of different logical levels stand together? User experience is more general and exists before, after, and even without any user interface. Why is the word “user” mentioned twice in this 4-letter acronym?\n\nEven such a popular title as User Experience Designer (UX Designer) is a goofy pleonasm, basically, using more words than needed. It’s similar to saying Quality Assurance Tester, Talent Acquisition Recruiter, or Software Engineering Developer — as if it gives you more importance.\n\nI have a hypothesis that the modern outbreak of design disciplines and creative titles is a reaction to stereotypes. Maybe we are adding descriptive words and replacing “designer” with “strategist,” “architect,” “analyst,” and “developer” to escape from the “make it look sexy” attitude? The latest trend is to call yourself a product designer. “Product” has become the new “UX” these days. Isn’t it a vicious circle? The word “design” has lost its initial meaning, and instead of bringing it back, we annihilate it by employing all these evasive words.\n\nWhy don’t we call ourselves designers anymore? When did “design” cease to mean anything?\n\nAll in all, there is no matter what you call yourself and your approach if the result of work lacks tangible value. If a designer draws wireframes, prepares prototypes, and conducts workshops, but cannot deliver a solution to a problem, who would care about tools and methodologies?\n\nSo, what are designers supposed to do, in the first place? Where is the balance between drawing mockups and influencing the world? There is a popular idea that a T-shaped skillset is the best for a designer. It means a designer has a deep competence in the core topic and decent knowledge in the rest of the areas.\n\nHowever, we are living in a weird age when the design industry is evolving fast, and people risk obtaining two dangerous skillset types. I call them the “I-shaped designer” and “em-dash-shaped designer.”\n\nThe first one is a specialist who knows only one narrow area, and if anything is beyond it asks to consult another specialist, for example, “Oh fuff, I don’t draw icons. I’m a UX designer. I pass my wireframes to a UI guy.” Or, “I pick the color palette. You’d better ask about the business model that girl at the whiteboard.”\n\nWhat’s next? Will there be Blue Button Designers? (Do not confuse with Red Button Designers.) Flat Icon Architects? Customer Journey Map Strategists? Principal Sticky Note Peelers? To feel how grotesque it sounds, try modifying non-design jobs: Steel Hammer Carpenter, Lurssen Yacht Sailor, Asian Flavor Cook, Beretta Gun Soldier, Canon Mark V Photographer.\n\nAnd since Design Thinking is popular nowadays, there is another problem — em-dash-shaped skills. These folks attend dozens of conferences and courses and know a little bit about everything. It’s not bad; we all used to be novices at some point. What is awkward is when they start to mention all the areas they pretend to know. For instance, UI/UX/Web/Mobile/Desktop Designer or Service/Product/Project Manager.\n\nYou may disagree with the thoughts above, “Yeah, it sounds cool in theory. But these buzzwords are exactly what recruiters and potential clients are looking for.” Well, this is right to a certain extent. But what about professional dignity? If it becomes trendy to call our job “Pixel Mover” or “Photoshop Operator,” will we put that on resumes to be easier discovered?\n\nI think large companies have also contributed to unteaching designers to be… designers. This zoo of design types is the result of granular work distribution in big teams. Designers are doing their small parts and gradually unlearning to see the final goal. Throw stones at me, but the end-to-end design process is a must for any designer, although they can specialize in something.\n\nMethods vary for every industry but the core is the same: research, ideation, testing, implementation.\n\nIf we call ourselves designers, I believe we should take responsibility for the whole product’s fate even doing a small portion of work at a time. If icons, wireframes, mockups, icons, or prototypes are neat, but what people get is a disaster, designers haven’t done their work. Let me make myself clear. I don’t promote being a design generalist versus a design specialist. Just pointing out that our work is more responsible than we imagine.\n\nNow we can return to the questions from the beginning of the article. What are we? What are we actually doing? And here is another observation. Designers’ area of responsibility grows each year. Present-day titles more and more reflect how we work because there is not much difference between the principles of designing a mobile interface and a microwave oven. “If you can design a thing, you can design anything,” said Massimo Vignelli. It means the designer’s mindset is more important than tools, and you’ll learn the tools fast if you know what to do next.\n\nWe should be able to show the measurable value of what we consider is right. Sometimes designers propose solutions that don’t bring immediate income but, for example, attract loyal customers. Loyalty and the company’s reputation will bring money in the future. The trick here is to show how it’s possible. It’s like playing chess: the more steps ahead you think, the more credibility and trust you gain.\n\nUnderstanding and proving the value of design is one of the basic topics in our profession. Fima, pixel perfection, customer journey maps, and visual language don’t make us designers. In the same way, a hammer and saw don’t make someone a carpenter. We are designers when we solve problems and contribute to something valuable.\n\nThere will always be people and situations that break the reputation of our profession. A popular joke says, “There will always be someone who can do it cheaper.” Fortunately, there are simple things everyone can do to support the credibility of designers."
