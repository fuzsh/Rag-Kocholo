Our voter engagement campaign — It’s My Vote! — will give you the training, tools, and resources to help increase voter participation in your community.\n\nAre You Registered to Vote?\n\nThis year’s election will have a major impact on equity in education, women’s economic security, and reproductive and civil rights. The good news? When women vote, we change the conversation. Thanks for taking the first step.\n\nCEO Webinar\n\nIn Conversation with Tiya Miles, Ph.D.\n\nJoin CEO Gloria L. Blackwell for a conversation with AAUW alumna, Dr. Tiya Miles (Community Action Grant, 2012-2014) , about her book Wild Girls: How the Outdoors Shaped Women Who Challenged a Nation. Dr. Miles discusses her work that puts girls of all races—and the landscapes they loved—at center stage and reveals the impact of the outdoors on women’s independence, resourcefulness, and vision.\n\nWebinar Spotlight: \"In Conversation with Dr. Pempho Chinkondenji\"\n\nDive into our past recordings and keep an eye out for future events that celebrate, educate on, and inspire progress in gender equity.\n\nCEO Webinar: In Conversation with Dr. Pempho Chinkondenji\n\nWatch CEO Gloria L.
