        "text": "Galbi means “ribs” in Korean, and is a popular Korean dish served in many places. LA galbi is a style of galbi – barbecued beef short ribs – cut thinly (about ¼ inch thick) across the bones.\n\nThe first time I tried LA galbi was about 20 years ago when I visited my sister living in LA. She prepared LA galbi for me and my family. I enjoyed the galbi a lot even though I was a little surprised to see the short ribs cut thinly and across the bone.\n\nRegular galbi in Korea is cut differently. It’s cut across and along the bone. Each piece that goes on the grill is one section of the rib, with one piece of bone in it. It’s a lot thicker. LA galbi is only cut across the bone, not along, so each piece on the grill is a longer, thinner strip, and includes 3 pieces of bone.\n\nThe marinade is exactly same as authentic Korean galbi.\n\nAt the time I never asked why it’s called LA galbi. I assumed it was because it’s popular among Korean immigrants in America.\n\nBut writing this recipe I researched the origin of the name, I couldn’t find the real answer anywhere. So I like to become a detective today, investigating LA galbi:\n\nTheory #1:\n\nLA galbi is cut laterally, so the name comes from the first 2 letters of the word “lateral.”\n\nTheory #2:\n\nKorean immigrants living in Los Angeles, California innovated this cut.\n\nIn my personal opinion, theory #2 seems more likely. If #1 theory is true, where is the HO galbi (from the word horizontal)? : )\n\nLA galbi had already existed before I tasted it 20 years ago, but I’ve never seen any other culture use this particular cut of short ribs for BBQ, only Koreans. If your culture also uses this cut, let me know in the comments. But as far as I know, it’s unique (note: as I learned, this cut is popular in Mexico).\n\nLast year I had a chance to go a BBQ picnic with about 20 Americans. I brought my marinated LA galbi to let them taste it. Surprisingly, none of them had seen or tasted LA galbi before. They loved my LA galbi and more than 1 year later they’re still talking about how good it was.\n\nBut if Koreans invented LA galbi, there must be someone or some group of chefs responsible, somewhere. If you’re the inventor, or know who he or she is, please contact me at maangchi@gmail.com. I want to interview you! You can share the history of LA galbi and the origin of the name, I’m very curious about it.\n\nIngredients (for 4-6 servings)\n\n3.5 LB (1.5 kg) of LA style beef short ribs\n\nsoy sauce\n\nwater\n\nhoney\n\ngarlic\n\nonion\n\nginger\n\npear\n\ntoasted sesame oil\n\ntoasted sesame seeds\n\nblack ground pepper\n\nsoybean paste\n\nhot pepper paste\n\ngreen onions\n\nlettuce\n\nperilla leaves\n\ngreen chili pepper\n\ncucumber\n\ncarrot\n\nDirections\n\nTrim excess fat from the short ribs and rinse a couple times in cold water.\n\nSoak the ribs in cold water for 10-20 minutes to remove the blood.\n\nMake marinade:\n\nIn a large bowl, add ⅓ cup soy sauce, ⅓ cup water or cooking wine, ¼ cup honey (or ⅓ cup brown sugar), and 1 ts ground black pepper.\n\nBlend 1 Korean pear (about 2 cups’ worth), 8 cloves of garlic, 1 medium onion, and 1 ts of chopped ginger until it turns into a white creamy liquid.\n\nAdd it to your soy sauce base and add 2 tbs toasted sesame oil.\n\n*tip: If you can’t find a Korean pear, use 2 ripe bosc pears. I sometimes use bosc pears and they work well.\n\nRinse the short ribs in fresh cold water a couple more times to remove any remaining bone fragments. Drain the water.\n\nAdd the ribs to the marinade and mix it well, by hand.\n\nKeep it in the refrigerator for at least an hour. Overnight is better, but an hour is ok if you are short of time.\n\nMake ssamjang dipping sauce:\n\n(see video)\n\nMix these 2 tbs soy bean paste, 1 tbs of hot pepper paste, 1 stalk of chopped green onion, 1 clove of minced garlic, 1 ts honey, 1 ts of toasted sesame oil, and 1 ts sesame seeds in a small bowl with a spoon.\n\nPrepare vegetables:\n\nRinse and drain lettuce and perilla leaves. Put them on a plate or basket.\n\nCut a cucumber into strips 3½ inch to 4 inches in length and ½ inch thick (8-10 cm long x1½ cm thick),\n\nChop green chili peppers and slice a few cloves of raw garlic and put them next to green lettuce and perilla leaves.\n\nLet’s cook and eat!\n\nGrill, pan fry, or BBQ the ribs. The LA style cut is thin, so they’re cooked much faster than usual ribs. It takes only about 5 minutes!\n\nWhen the both sides are cooked, put them on a serving plate. Cut the meat part off the bone with scissors into bite sized pieces.\n\nPut a piece of meat on top of a lettuce leaf and a periilla leaf. Add dipping sauce, garlic, and a piece of green chili pepper. Fold it over into a small package, and pop it into your mouth in one bite!\n\nYou can serve this with rice and kimchi, too.\n\nEnjoy the recipe!"
