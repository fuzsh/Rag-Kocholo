Here's the full official new Eras Tour setlist and all the changes she's made so far.\n\nListen to this article\n\nLoading audio...\n\nIt's safe to say that Taylor Swift's Eras Tour has well and truly surpassed every single expectation we had. The Eras Tour officially opened its doors in Glendale, Arizona on March 17th where Taylor performed songs from all 10 of her albums.\n\nSince then, Taylor has released her eleventh album, 'The Tortured Poets Department', and has now added seven of those songs to the setlist too. But what songs have been cut to make room for the new tracks?\n\nOn May 9th in Paris, France, Taylor changed the entire Eras Tour setlist as fans know it. Popular songs have now been removed and the eras section order has been moved around.\n\nHere's all the songs in Taylor's Eras Tour setlist, including every song featured in the show, how many songs she plays, every single surprise song and all the 'The Tortured Poets Department' tracks that have been added to the setlist.\n\nPlus, all the updates to the setlist and what to expect for the European Eras Tour dates.\n\nRead more: How To Listen To Capital (Taylor’s Version)\n\nRead more: Taylor Swift Adds Seven 'Tortured Poets Department' Songs To New Eras Tour Setlist\n\nRead more: Taylor Swift Eras Tour Start Times: What Time Does Taylor Swift Take To The Stage?\n\nWhat songs are on Taylor Swift's The Eras Tour setlist?\n\nHow many songs does Taylor Swift play on the Eras Tour setlist?\n\nThe average Taylor Swift concert used to be around 2 hours long but The Eras Tour is a whole different beast... The concert is a whopping 3 hours and 15 minutes long, and Taylor performs a huge 45 tracks within that timeframe.\n\nNot all the tracks are performed in full – some are shortened versions. There's also a couple of additional little interludes that pop up throughout the show.\n\nFor context, on the Rep tour, Taylor performed 19 tracks in total, including several mashups that featured some of her older songs. For The 1989 World Tour, she performed 18 songs, while 17 songs were performed on The Red Tour and the Speak Now World Tour.\n\nRead more: 59 Taylor Swift lyrics for your Eras Tour Instagram captions\n\nTaylor Swift New Eras Tour setlist: What songs does Taylor Swift perform on the Eras Tour?\n\nTaylor now only has two more legs of the Eras Tour to complete: Europe and the second U.S. and Canada leg. International fans heading to the shows in 2024 thought they had a pretty solid idea of what to expect, but she has now turned everything on its head with a brand new setlist and a new 'The Tortured Poets Department' section.\n\nThe Eras Tour set list features a mix of her highest charting songs, lead singles, fan favourites, outright bangers and tracks that stand out as milestones in her incredible career so far.\n\nOn March 31st, during her show in Arlington, TX, Taylor confirmed that the setlist will have some changes as the tour goes on. We now know that the entire setlist has changed. On May 9th 2024 in Paris, Taylor changed the order of the setlist and removed a handful of songs. Seven 'Tortured Poets Department' songs were also added.\n\nThe Eras sections now go in this order: 'Lover', 'Fearless', 'Red', 'Speak Now', 'Reputation', 'Folklore and Evermore' (now combined), '1989', 'The Tortured Poets Department', Surprise Songs and 'Midnights'.\n\nHere's Taylor Swift's new Eras Tour setlist in order, based on Paris Night 1 setlist:\n\nMiss Americana & The Heartbreak Prince (shortened)\n\nCruel Summer\n\nThe Man\n\nYou Need To Calm Down (shortened)\n\nLover\n\nFearless (shortened)\n\nYou Belong With Me\n\nLove Story\n\n22\n\nWe Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\n\nI Knew You Were Trouble\n\nAll Too Well (10 Minute Version)\n\nEnchanted\n\n…Ready For It?\n\nDelicate\n\nDon’t Blame Me\n\nLook What You Made Me Do\n\ncardigan\n\nbetty\n\nchampagne problems\n\naugust\n\nillicit affairs (shortened)\n\nmy tears ricochet\n\nmarjorie (shortened)\n\nwillow\n\nStyle\n\nBlank Space\n\nShake It Off\n\nWildest Dreams (shortened)\n\nBad Blood (shortened)\n\nBut Daddy I Love Him\n\nSo High School (shortened)\n\nWho's Afraid of Little Old Me?\n\nDown Bad\n\nFortnight\n\nThe Smallest Man Who Ever Lived\n\nI Can Do It With A Broken Heart\n\nSurprise Guitar Acoustic Song\n\nSurprise Piano Acoustic Song\n\nLavender Haze\n\nAnti-Hero\n\nMidnight Rain\n\nVigilante Shit\n\nBejeweled\n\nMastermind\n\nKarma\n\nAll Eras Tour setlist changes and updates so far:\n\nSix songs have now been permanently removed from the Eras Tour setlist: 'The Archer', 'Long Live', 'The 1', 'The Last Great American Dynasty', 'Tis The Damn Season' and 'Tolerate It'.\n\nThe 'Folklore' and 'Evermore' sections have now been combined in the setlist, as they are 'sister' albums.\n\nSeven songs from 'The Tortured Poets Department' have now been added.\n\nOn March 31st 2023, 'Invisible string' was replaced by 'the 1'. Both songs have now been removed.\n\nOn July 7th and 8th, Taylor performed 'Long Live' after 'Enchanted'. The song remained on the setlist until May 2024, when it was removed.\n\nOn July 22nd, Taylor replaced 'tis the damn season' so she could perform 'No Body, No Crime' with HAIM. 'Tis the damn season' returned to the main setlist on August 24th in Mexico City, before being removed in May 2024.\n\nFor all the shows where Phoebe Bridgers appeared as a support act, Taylor performed 'Nothing New' with her during the Red (TV) section.\n\nOn May 26th and May 27th 2023, Ice Spice joined Taylor on stage to perform 'Karma'.\n\nAs of June 27th 2024, there is still no section on the tour dedicated to her debut album, 'Taylor Swift'.\n\nRead more: 430+ friendship bracelet ideas for Taylor Swift's Eras Tour\n\nWhat surprise songs has Taylor Swift performed?\n\nMuch like her other tours, Taylor performs two surprise songs for each show.

She previously stated that she will only play each surprise song once during the tour, unless she messes one up.\n\nThere's also no rules for Taylor repeating songs from Midnights as surprise songs, which means fans may get to hear the likes of 'You're On Your Own Kid' and 'Snow on the Beach' again at some point in the future.\n\nWe'll update this article with every Surprise Acoustic Song – and every surprise song that she will play again – after every show.\n\nWill Taylor Swift change the Eras Tour setlist?\n\nAside from a few song changes, the Eras Tour setlist remained the same throughout the 2023 shows and every show up until the release of 'The Tortured Poets Department'. During the first Paris show in May 2024, Taylor changed the order of the setlist, removed six songs and added seven new ones from 'TTPD'.\n\nRead more: Taylor Swift Adds Seven 'Tortured Poets Department' Songs To New Eras Tour Setlist\n\nRead more: Taylor Swift Cuts Six Songs From Eras Tour Setlist: See The Full List\n\nFans attending the European shows might end up hearing Taylor perform 'Castles Crumbling' with Hayley Williams at some point, as Paramore will be supporting her throughout those tour dates. Unlike Phoebe Bridgers and HAIM, who joined Taylor on stage to perform 'Nothing New' and 'No Body, No Crime' respectively on the nights they were support acts, a 'Castles Crumbling' duet might be more likely to appear as a surprise song.\n\nTaylor will finish her European leg in London in August 2024, before returning to North America in November 2024. It's possible that she may make more changes to the final leg of the show.\n\nWhat are Taylor's most performed songs on tour?\n\nBefore she embarked on The Eras Tour, Taylor’s top 3 most performed songs are ‘Love Story’ (491 times), ‘Our Song’ (404 times) and ‘You Belong With Me’ (381 times).\n\nOf course, almost all of Taylor’s most performed songs are from her first two albums. As the list goes on, the 'Speak Now' bops, 'Red' bangers and '1989' hits start to weave their way in.\n\nIf you’re wondering what Taylor’s most played songs from her first five albums are, here’s a break down:\n\nTaylor Swift: ‘Our Song’, ‘Tim McGraw’ and ‘Picture To Burn’\n\nFearless: ‘Love Story’, ‘You Belong With Me’ and ‘Fifteen’\n\nSpeak Now: ‘Sparks Fly’, ‘Mean’ and ‘Mine’\n\nRed: ‘We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together’, ‘I Knew You Were Trouble’ and ‘Red’\n\n1989: ‘Shake It Off’, ‘Blank Space’ and ‘Out of the Woods’\n\nTaylor has only had the chance to perform songs from Reputation on the Reputation Stadium Tour so far, but ‘Ready For It?’, ‘Delicate’ and ‘Look What You Made Me Do’ take the top spots when it comes to live performances of the Rep tracks.\n\nDue to the cancellation of Lover Fest, Taylor hasn’t been able to perform Lover on a tour setting. Folklore, Evermore and Midnights will also be making their tour debut on the Eras Tour.\n\nRead more Taylor Swift news here:\n\nTaylor Swift re-recordings: All the predicted release dates of the Taylor’s Version albums\n\nIs Taylor Swift releasing an Eras Tour documentary?
