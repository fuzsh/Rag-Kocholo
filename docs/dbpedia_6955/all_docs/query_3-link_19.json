        "text": "Girl power! Geri Halliwell (Ginger Spice), Victoria Beckham (Posh Spice), Mel B (Scary Spice), Melanie Chisholm (Sporty Spice) and Emma Bunton (Baby Spice) formed the Spice Girls in 1994 and went on to become one of the most beloved music groups of all time. The band was originally called Touch, but they later changed their name to Spice after cowriting a song titled ‚ÄúSugar and Spice.‚Äù However, they once again altered the name to the one that eventually stuck, Spice Girls, after discovering that another artist already used the moniker Spice. The British girl group released their debut single, ‚ÄúWannabe,‚Äù in July 1996. As their popularity skyrocketed, their first album, Spice, followed in November of that year. The Spice Girls ‚Äî who adopted their nicknames from Top of the Pops magazine ‚Äî went on to drop a slew of hits, including ‚ÄúSpice Up Your Life,‚Äù ‚ÄúWho Do You Think You Are‚Äù and ‚ÄúStop.‚Äù Halliwell announced her intentions to leave the band in May 1998. As the members of the group pursued solo careers and their personal lives flourished, the Spice Girls took an indefinite hiatus in December 2000. Seven years later, all five of the women revealed their plans to reunite for a worldwide tour. They gathered again in August 2012 to perform a medley of their greatest hits at the closing ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. [sendtonews type=\"float\" key=\"fJHIj114uf-3105534-14453\"] In November 2018, Halliwell, Mel B, Chisholm and Bunton shared their intentions to tour again without Beckham, who declined to participate, but cheered them on from the sidelines.\n\nIn March 2024, the women celebrated 30 years since auditioning for their iconic Spice Girls auditions.\n\n‚ÄúToday marks the 30th anniversary of the very first Spice Girls auditions! üéâ,‚Äù they wrote via their official Instagram account alongside a throwback video from the audition process. ‚ÄúWhat started back in 1994 has turned into an amazing journey, way beyond anything we could have ever imagined.

Aside from music, she has designed a line of bikinis, served as a judge on Australia‚Äôs Got Talent and The X Factor and released two autobiographies and a series of children‚Äôs novels.\n\nHalliwell gave birth to daughter Bluebell with ex Sacha Gervasi in May 2006, and Beckham and Bunton were named her godmothers. She married Christian Horner in May 2015, and the couple welcomed son Montague in January 2017.\n\nIn April 2019, the ‚ÄúLift Me Up‚Äù songstress denied Mel B‚Äôs claims that the two once had sex. Halliwell‚Äôs rep told Us Weekly at the time that the rumors were ‚Äúsimply not true and [had] been very hurtful to her family.‚Äù\n\nThe singer often shares photos of her personal life via Instagram, whether she's cuddling with her kids or cooking pancakes.\n\nCredit: Shutterstock (2)\n\nMel B (Scary Spice)\n\nAfter going solo, the pop star competed on Dancing With the Stars and The Masked Singer, led her own reality show titled Mel B: It‚Äôs a Scary World, joined the America‚Äôs Got Talent judging panel and released her memoir Brutally Honest.\n\nMel B shares daughter Phoenix with ex-husband Jimmy Gulzar, daughter Angel with ex Eddie Murphy and daughter Madison with ex-husband Stephen Belafonte.\n\n‚ÄãIn May 2022, the singer was honored with an MBE for her domestic violence charity work. She also became an ambassador for the Caribbean island Nevis, where her father is from.\n\nIn October 2022, ‚Äãthe \"Too Much\" artist announced she and her boyfriend ‚Äî and hairstylist! ‚Äî Rory McPhee were engaged, revealing on the U.K. talk show Gogglebox that he proposed surrounded by rose petals and a log fire.\n\nCredit: Shutterstock (2)\n\nMelanie Chisholm (Sporty Spice)\n\nMel C had the bestselling solo album among the group and is one of the U.K.‚Äôs most successful female artists ever. She founded her own label, Red Girl Records, in 2004. She then made her acting debut in 2009 in the stage musical Blood Brothers. In September 2021, she was announced as part of the Dancing With the Stars season 30 cast. ‚ÄãMel C released a new album in 2022 and toured the U.K. to support it.\n\nChisholm welcomed daughter Scarlet with ex Thomas Starr in February 2009. She began dating Joe Marshall in 2015, but the couple called it quits in 2022 after seven years together. She's reportedly been in a relationship with longtime friend Cassius Colman following her split from Marshall."
