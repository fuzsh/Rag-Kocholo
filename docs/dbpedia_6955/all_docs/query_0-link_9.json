        "text": "Associated pages\n\nReiyu (You are here)\n\nGallery\n\nReiyu GuiGui is an independent English VTuber who officially debuted 28 November 2020. Members of her community are known as Ghostlings.\n\nIntroduction Video[]\n\nPersonality[]\n\nReiyu is a bubbly, energetic, and witty Gyaru Geisha Ghost Gamer VTuber with an unhinged, joy-filled laugh. She is quick to say whatever joke comes to her mind no matter how lewd and often regrets it. She is a warm-hearted and kind individual, stating that her number one goal in her (after)life is to make her ghostling family laugh. You will often find her thanking viewers by name for making her laugh or for guiding her through a game.\n\nReiyu has a deep love for videogames, especially ones with \"interesting premises or mechanics\" and \"fast-paced challenging games with tight controls.\" Her favorite videogame genres are Action Roguelikes, Rhythm, Mystery, and Visual Novels. Even while playing difficult games, Reiyu is able to banter back and forth with her chat. Reiyu also has an unusually open backseating policy because she likes going into a game blind and being guided patiently through a game. She dislikes reading guides and wikis because \"it feels too much like studying,\" and prefers learning from viewers since it feels more hands-on.\n\nReiyu has also admitted she's \"too much of a zoomer\" to enjoy retro games, but is not opposed to playing them if she enjoys the story or gameplay. She has admitted that she doesn't enjoy fighting and racing games because she sucks at them, but she will still give them her best shot for the ghostlings.\n\nThere are few people as passionate about lewd and \"cultured content\" as Reiyu is. Reiyu enjoys lewd humor and maintains a 18+ space around her streams. She finds lewd humor peak because it's absurd and inoffensive. As she puts it, \"Jokes on my channel are not necessarily safe for work, but they're always safe for homies.\"\n\nDespite being laid-back and chill, Reiyu's maturity and intelligence often comes through in her interactions. She does not hesitate to call out behavior that she finds unacceptable and encourages her viewers to be kind. Reiyu's conversation topics sometimes touch on serious matters, but she continues to offer respectful takes on these subjects.\n\nReiyu's Videogame Challenge Runs[]\n\nReiyu is extremely skilled at videogames and often adds extra insane challenges to already challenging games. This is due to her self-proclaimed sadomasochism. For example, she played the following on stream:\n\nDOOM Eternal and DLC on UItra-Violence/Nightmare, drunk.\n\nDark Souls 3 and DLC and killed all bosses (including optional ones) blind, drunk, wearing no armor, and only using a club or katana.\n\nSekiro: Shadows Die Twice blind, drunk, and on the Demon Bell difficulty as soon as she could find it. She has beaten the Shura and Purification ending this way and is currently playing through the True Ending with no Kuro's Charm and Demon Bell.\n\nSifu, drunk.\n\nElden Ring blind, solo, no item, no summons, no armor, and katana-only. She beat most challenging bosses this way, including Malenia, the Blade of Miquella.\n\nPacifist Undertale run without using items and without taking off the Bandage equip. (All to get a dialogue line of acknowledgement from Sans.) Later, she played Deltarune and beat hidden bosses Spamton and Jevil without using items to heal.\n\nEverhood on Expert, having notably beat the Dev Gnomes and Light Being.\n\nYakuza 0 on Hard, notably defeating the two endgame secret bosses you get for 100%ing the substories in the game. Reiyu actually spent 6 miserable hours fighting one of them with a severely under leveled Kiryu after not realizing she had to save prior to the boss fight. She subsequently 100%'d the substories of Yakuza Kiwami and Yakuza Kiwami 2 on hard as well.\n\nNeon White and getting all gifts and Ace Medals.\n\nDevil Daggers with a record time of 200 seconds.\n\nTitanfall 2 on Master difficulty. Before starting the game, she spent 6 hours in the tutorial Gauntlet to get the \"... Becomes The Master\" achievement by placing Top 3 in the in-game scoreboard.\n\nGhost of Tsushima on Lethal difficulty.\n\nProfile[]\n\nDue to hardship endured during her life and her sudden untimely death, Reiyu wants to spend her afterlife playing games with her ghostlings without worries. It is Reiyu's self-assigned job to escort ghostlings through purgatory and towards their reincarnation, but in return, she asks that the ghostlings guide her in videogames before their time in purgatory arrives.\n\nIn Reiyu's Lore Video \"The Promise\", a still-alive, fully pink-haired Reiyu is seen performing various activities including dancing, working at a daycare/orphanage, doing lab work, and working as a cashier. While bicycling home in the dark, she is hit by a truck. She awakens in purgatory, her hair now tinged with bright blue, glowing ends. Reiyu is seen walking through purgatory and amassing ghostlings along the way. Though she is lost herself, she points forward and leads them onwards to reincarnation.\n\nAppearance and Design[]\n\nReiyu has two-tone hair that is pink and teal at the ends. The teal ends of her hair glow in the dark.\n\nReiyu's Poltergeisha outfit is a colorful kimono whose sleeves falls into the shape of a butterfly's wings. The outfit contains several motifs revolving around death and reincarnation.\n\nHer kimono is tucked in right over left, which is only done so on corpses during a funeral. The correct way to tuck in a kimono when you're alive is left over right.\n\nOn top of having butterflies sprinkled throughout her design, her kimono sleeves drape down into the shape of a butterflies wings. Butterflies symbolize transformation, metamorphosis, rebirth, resurrection, and triumph of the spirit and soul over the material world.\n\nIn her hair ornament, Reiyu has red spider lily flowers. In Japanese culture, these flowers represent death and the afterlife.\n\nReiyu hides a mole under a sakura blossom sticker and she also has sakura flowers throughout her design. Due to their transient blooming cycle, sakura symbolize the cycle of life, death, and reincarnation.\n\nReiyu's two-tone hair fades from pink to light blue. As shown in Reiyu's lore video, the light blue of Reiyu's hair only appeared after death and glows in the dark. The two colors are intentionally inverted colors of one another, meant to symbolize a purgatorial intersection between life and death.\n\nReiyu's \"Gamer Gyaru\" outfit is a school uniform with a butterfly-shaped bow, a red-purple jacket, and red skirt. Notably, Reiyu has two shorter nails on her right hand. This outfit is jampacked with accessories that reference Reiyu's favorite games including:\n\nA Pomeranian and black cat from Ghost Trick\n\nZagreus laurel from Hades\n\nThe Paragon and Renegade symbols from Mass Effect\n\nHannya Majima from the Yakuza series\n\nThe red heart and a winking Sans from Undertale\n\nA lunar tear from NieR: Automata\n\nBaba from Baba Is You\n\nNeon Violet from Neon White\n\nRad shiba from VA-11 Hall-A\n\nThe polylute from Risk of Rain 2\n\nThe compass from Return of the Obra Dinn\n\nThe Clan Sakai logo from Ghost of Tsushima\n\nA Nuka-Cola bottle cap from the Fallout series\n\nThe horrific necktie from Disco Elysium\n\nThe attorney's badge from Ace Attorney\n\nThe Poltergust 5000 from Luigi's Mansion\n\nA pickaxe from Deep Rock Galactic\n\nAiba from AI: The Somnium Files\n\n808 from Hi-Fi Rush\n\nA paperclip from Hotel Dusk\n\nXXII pins as a reference to the female protagonist from Persona 3\n\nA Donu and Deca bracelet from Slay the Spire\n\nA wristband \"4\" from Zero Escape: The Nonary Games\n\nHistory[]\n\nBackground[]\n\nReiyu created her YouTube channel on 15 October, 2020 and her Twitch channel on 19 November, 2020. She then made her YouTube and Twitch debut on 28 November, 2020.\n\n2021[]\n\nOn 5 January, she announced a new design as well as updates to her Live2D model drawn by Hinaki0102 and rigged by kumi0002cm.[1]\n\nOn 25 February, Reiyu became a Twitch partner. [2]\n\nOn 24 March, Reiyu was raided while she was playing Dark Souls 3 by renowned streamer and YouTuber, MoistCr1TiKaL. Reiyu stated on stream that she was incredibly honored because he was a content creator that she watched eagerly in her childhood and stated that she had once emailed him asking if she could subtitle his videos for her hard of hearing siblings. He raided her again on 14 April and 19 June.\n\nOn 5 April, Reiyu reached 10,000 Twitch followers.\n\nOn 28 November, Reiyu redebuted with two new outfits: a casual outfit and a lingerie outfit. These were drawn by MYwhat_ and rigged by qryosityy.\n\n2022[]\n\nOn 14 February, Reiyu celebrated her 22nd birthday and debuted a kimono outfit.

Reiyu and her chat are both constantly trying to twist anything liquid or stamina related into a sudden, unexpected reference for Gamer Supps. Use code PEGAHOMIE for 10% off.\n\n\"Five\" or \"5.\" This gag started during a Lewd Club stream when Reiyu said she could never do a countdown during certain activities because she would \"lose on 5.\"\n\nAt any given time, there are only ten homies perceiving a Reiyu stream. This gag started when Reiyu admitted that she got nervous looking at her viewer count, so she pretends that there are only ten people in her streams. Chat plays along.\n\nMaster Mistress Reiyu GuiGui MS MS. Reiyu has a Master's in Biology and ended up receiving two diplomas by mistake. While Reiyu only has the one Master's, chat likes to joke that she has two.\n\nJuicebox, the annihilator. Reiyu has an adorable cat named Juicebox who likes to stick her paws out when sitting. Chat has a gag where they will use the reiyuJuicebox emote followed by a statement from Juicebox, usually revolving around murder and destruction.\n\nRei-SMR. Reiyu ASMR is notoriously cursed. It's too hard to explain, you simply have to attend.\n\nQuotes[]\n\n\"What's a bit of spilt cum between homies?\"\n\n\"Actually, I wish I was even shorter so all women become even dommier and mommier to me.\"\n\n\"Some people really do be complaining about being single when they've spend the last two years indoors watching hentai. It's me. I'm people.\"\n\nTrivia[]\n\nAccording to her, she died when getting hit by a truck. This event is derived from her real life after she got hit by a car while biking to class.\n\nHer favorite color is red, specifically the hex color #b00b1e.[3]\n\nHer first name is Japanese and her last name is Chinese. Both names hint to her existence as a ghost.\n\nHer first name, \"Reiyu,\" is a rearrangement for the the kanji in the Japanese word for ghost, \"yurei\" or \"幽霊.\"\n\nHer last name, \"GuiGui,\" involves the Chinese character for ghost, \"gui\" or \"鬼.\"\n\nShe likes: cats, games, food, tutoring and stalking.

She also ships them (in the sense of wanting them to be by each other's side forever).\n\nShe also ships Himiko Toga and Ochako Uraraka.\n\nShe also ships Goro Majima and Kazuma Kiryu from Yakuza, even having drawn emotes on her channel of them kissing and allowing viewers to use channel points to trigger a cute animation of them kissing.\n\nDue to her ghostly nature, Reiyu can reshape her body to whatever she or her partner wants.\n\nShe is a self proclaimed sadomasochist, having said that \"sadism and masochism are two sides of the same coin.\"\n\nReiyu has stated on numerous occasions that she loves samurai and yakuza. The blue jacket to her first Live2D model is inspired by the Shinsengumi, a historic samurai group.\n\nAccording to Reiyu, all ghosts are naturally attracted to Luigi, hence the Luigi's Mansion series.\n\nReiyu has stated that the ghostlings are only allowed to call her \"mommy\" and derivatives thereof when she turns 25 in 2025. Ideally, she says she only wants to be called \"mommy\" at 36.\n\nThe word \"mommy\" is currently banned on her channel.\n\nReiyu has expressed deep love and lust for fictional buff old men.
