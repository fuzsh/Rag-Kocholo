        "text": "The lines between different entertainment industries continue to be blurred, in ways that sometimes leaves me scratching my head. I don’t watch variety shows but the popularity of We Got Married has led me to at least understand the concept and have heard of famous couplings in the past. After many seasons on air I figure the show must be showing its age which means its time to refresh or branch out. News came out this week about the show prepping for an international edition (really just a pan-Asia edition) with two couples comprised of entertainers from different countries. One of each couple will be a Korean entertainer paired with someone from another country. I totally get how actors can film dramas or movies in other countries. They say their lines in their native language and then are promptly dubbed over. Or they learn the language well enough to at least convincingly say part of their lines. During the filming there is always a translator on set and the awkward language barriers are usually kept behind the scenes. This won’t be true of reality show WGM which requires the entertainers to pretend to be married. LOL, talk about highlighting a married couple’s inability to communicate. Even if a translator trails them, how is that going to convince the viewers the couple is getting to know each other and going through the motions of newlyweds. Which married couple has a third wheel tagging along all the time? The casting choices have been revealed and remain up in the air. TW-actress and singer Gui Gui apparently has signed on as one cast member and is reportedly going to be paired with Taecyeon from 2PM, should he accept. Woah, talk about a pairing out of left field. Gui Gui is the sweetest thing ever and has such natural warmth and bubbly charm she’s like a no brainer choice for shows like this. I actually like Taecyeon despite his considerable chiseled physique and super stiff acting skills – I find him endearing with his his big-eared boyish lunkhead aura. Gui Gui does speak a smattering of Japanese and English but she most definitely does not speak Korean last I checked. And I don’t think Taec speaks Chinese either. This will be fascinating to watch if it comes true. As for the other couple in the show, the producers are luring Nicole of Kara which means she’ll be paired with a male entertainer from likely Taiwan, China, or Japan. Ooooh, I’m curious who that’ll be.\n\nAll the inability to communicate concerns aside, Gui Gui and Taecyeon would make a very lovely and interesting couple. She’s so cute and smiley and bossy and he’s such a meat head with a sweet center. I might be tempted to check this out if it does happen."
