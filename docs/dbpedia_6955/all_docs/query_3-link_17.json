        "text": "The typical person reads four emails for every one they send, according to the 2024 Work Trend Index Annual Report—meaning it doesn’t take long for inboxes to fill up. In a study of early Microsoft Copilot users, those at top companies spent between only 25 and 45 percent of their time interacting with emails. Here are four AI habits your organization can build to tame email overload: 1. Distill: Copilot helps condense long email threads into summaries, so you don’t have to slog through the entire back-and-forth to unearth takeaways. 2. Dig: To search for a crucial file or piece of information, you no longer need to remember which of the thousands of emails in your inbox contains exactly what you’re looking for. Copilot can do the digging for you. 3. Draft: Copilot can write a first draft of an email for you, which you can then fact-check and plus-up. 4. Diagnose: Once you’ve got a draft ready, Copilot can diagnose what’s fuzzy or off-putting in your message. Copilot’s “coaching” feature can check the tone of an email, assess clarity, and remind writers to consider the recipient’s feelings."
