        "text": "And, hey girl. now don't put me on,\n\nWhat's gonna happen to me when you're gone\n\nThe second cover song that Billy recorded for Greatest Hits III in 1997 was \"Hey Girl.\" The song was written by Carole King and Gerry Goffin and was made popular in 1963 by Freddie Scott. Scott's version reached number ten on the pops and R&B charts.\n\nIt is a slow moving ballad about the desperation the singer feels about an impending breakup. He is trying to convince his lover to not leave, even to the point of begging her to stay. The things we do for love.\n\nBilly has stated, however, that he recorded it a few years earlier with his daughter Alexa in mind, and how he would miss her due to his divorce from Christie Brinkley. (From Hank Bordowitz's biography on Billy Joel).\n\nBilly acquits himself very well as a soul singer, channeling the R&B songs of his youth. One wishes he had done more covers of soul and R&B songs. His cover of Sam & Dave's \"You've Got Me Hummin\" (the B-side to \"Tell Her About It\" in 1983) is a gem but you can't find it on any album, not even My Lives. You can, however, see and listen to Billy discuss the song as he inducts Sam & Dave to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992. Billy knows his rock music history.\n\nWhen Carole King received the Gershwin Award for Popular Music and was honored at a White House ceremony in 2013, Billy sang King's song \"The Locomotion\" and thanked her for inspiring him.\n\nâ€‹\n\nVertical Divider\n\nWords and music by Carole King and Gerry Goffin\n\nHey girl I want you to know,\n\nI'm gonna miss you so much if you go\n\nAnd hey girl I tell you no lie,\n\nSomething deep inside of me's going to die\n\nIf you say so long,\n\nIf this is good-bye\n\nOh hey girl this can't be true\n\nHow am I supposed to exist without you\n\nAnd, hey girl. now don't put me on,\n\nWhat's gonna happen to me when you're gone\n\nHow will I live\n\nHow can I go on\n\nHow can I go on\n\nHey girl\n\nOh hey girl now sit yourself down,\n\nI'm not ashamed to get down on the ground\n\nAnd then beg you to stay\n\nDon't go away\n\nHey girl\n\nDon't go away\n\nHey girl\n\nDon't go away\n\nMusic video for \"Hey Girl.\" Although known as the \"Piano Man,\" Billy has a soulful voice that is featured on this song.\n\nThis is Freddie Scott's version of Hey, Girl which reached the top ten in 1963. Carole King has her own version, including this live one here."
