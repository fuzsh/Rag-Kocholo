        "text": "Taiwanese girl group\n\nHey Girl was a Taiwanese girl group. Channel [V] held an audition for the show Blackie's Teenage Club (我愛黑澀會), a variety show that aims to create new female entertainers in Taiwan. At the end of 2005, Channel [V] picked nine members to represent the other girls. These nine members were Gui Gui, Ning Er, MeiMei, Apple, Hsiao Hsun, Ya Tou, Hsiao Man, Bae Tung Tung, and Ta Ya. Together, they are affectionately known as the Nine Beauties (Chinese: 九妞妞; pinyin: Jiǔ Niū Niū) for short.\n\nThe nine members were separated into two groups for their third EP release: Ta Ya, Hsiao Man, Ya Tou, Gui Gui, and Apple comprised Pink (traditional Chinese: 粉紅高壓電; ; pinyin: Fěn Hóng Gāo Yā Diàn; \"high-voltage pink\"), and Mei Mei, Hsiao Hsun, Ning Er, and Bae Tung Tung comprised Honey (traditional Chinese: 甜心轟炸機; ; pinyin: Tián Xīn Hōng Zhà Jī; \"sweet-hearted flying bombers\").\n\nOn October 5, 2007, Bae Tung Tung left Hey Girl (including the Wo Ai Hei Se Hui show). It is rumoured that she left because of a rift with band leader Ta Ya[1] over an alleged affair with Bae Tung Tung's boyfriend at the time, Hakka-Pac; other sources suggest that Bae Tung Tung was forced to depart due to violations of her contract.[2][3] Bae Tung Tung reports that she began cutting herself during this stressful period.[2][3]\n\nMoving forward, Bae Tung Tung has stated that she plans to concentrate on her singing and dancing.[4] She is currently working for Momo Kids, a Taiwanese television company featuring children's programming.[5]\n\nGui Gui has currently left the management of Channel V, where all the band members originate from. Andy Ge has admitted to the press that she is unlikely to renew her contract, with an ambiguous post on her own blog, Gui Gui had admitted to the news.\n\nWhile Andy Ge also clarifies, Hey Girl is not under Channel V management so Gui Gui is still with Hey Girl and will be attending promotions per usual.\n\nHowever, the Hey Girl promotion following his statement did not include Gui Gui who was said to be busy with MIT promotion before and during their promotion. On May 6, 2009, Andy Ge announced to the press that Gui Gui will not be renewing her contract with Channel V, he also states that her involvement with Hey Girl will have to be clarified with Warner Music, as Hey Girl do not belong to Channel V.\n\nHsiao Man has currently left the management of Channel V. She has signed to Eelin Model Agency. She has decided to leave Hey Girl to become a model.\n\nOn September 16, 2010, members of Hey Girl performed at an event in Nanchang which did not include Yeun Fei. Instead, it was a new member who was emerged from the event's promotional poster and the Hey Girl members' blogs. Ya Tou later confirmed in her Sina blog that Yeun Fei is no long a member of Hey Girl, but will continue to appear on the \"Black Lollipop\" show. The newest member, Chi Ting (子庭), has not yet appeared on any of the Channel V related shows and many fans seemed baffled and upset about the departure of Yeun Fei. Further speculations have suggested that the switch maybe due to Yeun Fei's high-profile relationship with one of the Didi \"EDD\", which the management frowns upon.[6]\n\nAs of April 2011, Si Ya's personal \"weibo\" has listed herself as \"without a management agent/agency\". Subsequently, she did not appear in any of Hey Girl's promotional activities in China. She did, however, appeared in number of variety shows such as 麻辣天后宫 and 鑽石夜總會 as one of the special guests. On May 5, 2011, the Hong Kong promotion company has unveiled the \"new\" Hey Girl member which included only Ya Tou, Hsiao Hsun, and Chi Ting.\n\nTa Ya, Ning Er, MeiMei & Apple had also decided to leave Hey Girl as they are now signed to Andy Ge's new agency company \"A Legend Star Ltd\". Ya Tou and Hsiao Hsun are still in Hey Girl, but with two new members, Si Ya and Yeun Fei. Although it has been rumoured that Ya Tou and Hsiao Hsun will also leave after they have fulfilled their contracts to join A Legend Star, which never occurred.\n\nThey left Hey Girl because their newest single Hey Girl did not sell well. They will not perform together for another 1 year. Ya Tou & Chi Ting have changed their talent agency to Jack Production (Ya Tou at 2013) & Yi Teng Entertainment (Chi Ting at 2014), just Hsiao Hsun stayed at M'stone International. This means that Hey Girl is disbanded. Chi Ting also married Andrew Lin in September 2014.\n\nOriginally, the group's name, Hei Se Hui Mei Mei, is a pun on the words \"Mei Mei\" (traditional Chinese: 美眉,1: beautiful girls) and \"Hei She Hui\" (traditional Chinese: 黑社會; ; \"black society; triad\"). Later, after the group's move to Warner Music Taiwan, its name was changed to 黑Girl, and the English name officially became Hey Girl. The change in name resulted from the record company's concerns that scandalous rumors of other members of the show Wo Ai Hei Se Hui would be associated with Hei Se Hui Mei Mei (Hey Girl).[7]\n\nBirth
