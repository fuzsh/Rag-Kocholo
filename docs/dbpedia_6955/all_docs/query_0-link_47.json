        "text": "Hello, this is my first post here. I own Avantis since June this year and find it as a great mixer. However i noticed that in live situation, when i need to fast change parameters, sometimes GUI is laggy and delayed. I know there are many things going in that box.\n\nMy firmware is 1.21.\n\nAre you experiencing same behavior? Or is it something on my side?\n\nIt depends on what you mean.\n\nThereâ€™s normal laggy: like swapping between the banks for the first time after recalling a session. After youâ€™ve gone through all of the banks/layers, youâ€™ll see the gui updates quicker when you go to those banks again.\n\nThereâ€™s abnormal laggy: Iâ€™ve had crazy stuff happening. Like multiple second of delay, members of mute groups changing very slowly before my eyes (probably because it took several seconds to catch up to the mute group I had navigated to).\n\nIn my case this was probably due to a hardware issue which should be repaired now.\n\nI havenâ€™t got enough hours of stress test on it since the repair to know if it succeeded.\n\nIn short, she GUI normally is not always as snappy as Iâ€™d like, but itâ€™s usually doable. It can manage to just about keep up with me.\n\nWhen itâ€™s not doable, and really slowing you down, somethingâ€™s either wrong with the desk, or itâ€™s fine but simply the wrong desk for you.\n\nBoth options are possible, but if the GUI is really laggy at times, you might have a hardware issue causing that.\n\nHi, Thanks for posting this video! This happens to me all the time, and drives me completely nuts! When I select something, I should have to check itâ€™s actually done it. I end up changing settings on the wrong channel whilst it catches up.\n\nIâ€™ve also noticed that when it gets stuck it queues the next touches and tries to select the following channels in sequence. This is bad behaviour! (I often select through sequences of channels to compare settings, and this erratic behaviour makes this very difficult.\n\nSQâ€™s never do this. The GLD also didnâ€™t. This feels like going back to iLive interface performance.\n\nHi, thank you for your answer. I really hope it is a software, not a hardware issue and it will be fixed in someday firmware update. Maybe it is some kind of process that interrupt workflow in 10 seconds intervals. A&H need to know about that issue, so iâ€™m asking everyone for checking it on your side. I hope also that someone from A&H reads forum ðŸ˜‰ Regards."
