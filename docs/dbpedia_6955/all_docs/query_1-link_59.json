        "text": "Afternoon,\n\nI do apologise if this is in the wrong area.\n\nHowever over the last week i’ve been stuck on this problem and i have tried many differnt solutions to the problem, and really do need some advice or a little nugde in some direction.\n\nI’m installed asterisk 1.6 no problems\n\nbut i didn’t realise it came without the web GUI.\n\nso after researching abit and finding ASterisk Web GUI2.0 i was delighted, downlaoded and install, and then configured the Http and manager files as shown below.\n\n[http file]\n\n;\n\n; Asterisk Builtin mini-HTTP server\n\n;\n\n;\n\n; Note about Asterisk documentation:\n\n; If Asterisk was installed from a tarball, then the HTML documentation should\n\n; be installed in the static-http/docs directory which is\n\n; (/var/lib/asterisk/static-http/docs) on linux by default. If the Asterisk\n\n; HTTP server is enabled in this file by setting the “enabled”, “bindaddr”,\n\n; and “bindport” options, then you should be able to view the documentation\n\n; remotely by browsing to:\n\n; <server_ip>:/static/docs/index.html\n\n;\n\n[general]\n\n;\n\n; Whether HTTP/HTTPS interface is enabled or not. Default is no.\n\n; This also affects manager/rawman/mxml access (see manager.conf)\n\n;\n\nenabled=yes\n\n;\n\n; Address to bind to, both for HTTP and HTTPS. Default is 0.0.0.0\n\n;\n\nbindaddr=0.0.0.0\n\n;\n\n; Port to bind to for HTTP sessions (default is 8088)\n\n;\n\nbindport=8088\n\n;\n\n; Prefix allows you to specify a prefix for all requests\n\n; to the server. The default is blank. If uncommented\n\n; all requests must begin with /asterisk\n\n;\n\nprefix=asterisk\n\n;\n\n; sessionlimit specifies the maximum number of httpsessions that will be\n\n; allowed to exist at any given time. (default: 100)\n\n;\n\n;sessionlimit=100\n\n;\n\n; Whether Asterisk should serve static content from http-static\n\n; Default is no.\n\n;\n\nenablestatic=yes\n\n;\n\n; Redirect one URI to another. This is how you would set a\n\n; default page.\n\n; Syntax: redirect=\n\n; For example, if you are using the Asterisk-gui,\n\n; it is convenient to enable the following redirect:\n\n;\n\n;redirect = / /static/config/cfgbasic.html\n\n;\n\n( i’ve left the https out at the bottom as i’m just trying to get this sorted first )\n\nand the manger file\n\n[[i]manager file]\n\n;\n\n; Asterisk Call Management support\n\n;\n\n; By default asterisk will listen on localhost only.\n\n[general]\n\nenabled = yes\n\nwebenabled = yes\n\nport = 8088\n\n[admin]\n\nsecret = 123456789\n\nread = system,call,log,verbose,command,agent,config,read,write,originate\n\nwrite = system,call,log,verbose,command,agent,config,read,write,originate\n\n; No access is allowed by default.\n\n; To set a password, create a file in /etc/asterisk/manager.d\n\n; use creative permission games to allow other serivces to create their own\n\n; files\n\n#include “manager.d/*.conf” [/i]\n\nnow after doing this i then made sure that it was working. i did the make checkconfig and everything listed as ok. as seen below\n\n[i]root@guiplug:/home/guiplug/Documents/asterisk-gui-2.1.0-rc1# make checkconfig\n\n— Checking Asterisk configuration to see if it will support the GUI —\n\nChecking for http.conf: OK\n\nChecking for manager.conf: OK\n\nChecking if HTTP is enabled: OK\n\nChecking if HTTP static support is enabled: OK\n\nChecking if manager is enabled: OK\n\nChecking if manager over HTTP is enabled: OK\n\n— Everything looks good —\n\nGUI should be available at guiplug:8088/asterisk/static/config/index.html\n\nNote: If you have bindaddr=127.0.0.1 in /etc/asterisk/http.conf\n\nyou will only be able to visit it from the local machine.\n\nExample: localhost:8088/asterisk/static/config/index.html\n\nThe login and password should be an entry from /etc/asterisk/manager.conf\n\nwhich has ‘config’ permission in read and write. For example:\n\n[admin]\n\nsecret = mysecret2622\n\nread = system,call,log,verbose,command,agent,config\n\nwrite = system,call,log,verbose,command,agent,config\n\n— Good luck! — [/i]\n\nas you can see I throught i got it working haha nothing is easy in debian lol\n\nI then did the http show status and this is what was listed, i’ve seen that on other print outs there is is more listed hwoever i don’t know what i’ve done but i think that its something not installed or not configured correctly.\n\ng[i]uiplug*CLI> http show status\n\nHTTP Server Status:\n\nPrefix: /asterisk\n\nServer Enabled and Bound to 0.0.0.0:8088\n\nEnabled URI’s:\n\n/asterisk/httpstatus => Asterisk HTTP General Status\n\n/asterisk/phoneprov/… => Asterisk HTTP Phone Provisioning Tool\n\n/asterisk/static/… => Asterisk HTTP Static Delivery\n\nEnabled Redirects:\n\n/ => /static/config/cfgbasic.html[/i]\n\nbascailly i can connect to the server however i get the error messsage\n\nNot Implemented\n\nAttempt to use unimplemented / unsupported method\n\nAsterisk Server\n\nand thisis from another computer o nthe network so i know that the server is working, but i think that it could be something to do with thwe micro http server inside, but i’m now completly lost. as people have said a huge amount of different stuff, making it hard to pin point my problem, don’t get me wrong i’ve tried them all before i came here. but you guys and girls are my last resort other than that i don\\t have a clue. I would be very much in anyones debt if they could help me with this. Thank you for your time.\n\nPlus i’'m sorry for my grammar. if you want me to explain anything again no problem.\n\nP.S.\n\nThis is on a Dreamplug with Debian squeeze.\n\nKind regards\n\nJoshua Shipman"
