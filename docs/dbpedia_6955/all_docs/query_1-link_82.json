        "text": "genre: fluff\n\nrequest: caixiaoyu\n\n‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ ÔΩ• ÔΩ°Ôæü‚òÜ: *.‚òΩ .* :‚òÜÔæü. ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ\n\nThird point of view~\n\nY/n was walking to the library to study for this test she was having until she bumped into Xiao Gui also known as the coolest kid in school. But also y/n's crush, she hasn't told anyone because he will probably reject her because she's a nerd.\n\n\"I'm sorry. . .\" Y/n said as she pushed up her glasses up. Giu just smiled and let it slide which he always does with her. Why you might ask he has a crush on her too. But he has kept it a secret.\n\nAs y/n went inside the library she got a idea which was the same idea as Giu had too. Y/n decided to change just for him and Giu decided to change for her.\n\nThey both ran, y/n ran out the library and Giu enter the library. Y/n went to this girl that she kinda looked up to her. In the other side Giu knew someone so he went to him.\n\n*Y/n's p.o.v*\n\nI go to Zhou Jieqiong also known as Kyulkyung. I wave to her and the she waves back. \"What do you need kiddo?\" Even though we are only one year apart she acts like we are more apart which I don't mind.\n\n\"So I want to change my look\"\n\n\"Aww why you look cute like that\"\n\n\"I want to be like you!\"\n\n\"Um ok then let's go shopping and just change you!\"\n\nWe went shopping for 5 hours and she bought me this for tomorrow but she bought me even more for the days.\n\n\"Oh god- I look like a different person\"\n\n\"I know right anyways here take one\"\n\n\"Um- I don't smoke-\"\n\n\"Just one ok\"\n\nI nodded then she started showing me how to use it. I tried it and then started coughing. She chuckle then told me to do it again.\n\n*Xiao Giu p.o.v*\n\nI go look for zhengting because he usually here studying. When I found him I ran towards him.\n\n\"Hey zhengting can you help me with something\"\n\n\"Uh with what?\"\n\n\"Changing my style\"\n\n\"Um sure?\"\n\nWe first went to a salon because he told me I have to get rid of my dreadlocks. Once I did he told me to just change the 'gangster' look I have. So I did and now I look the same but softer?\n\n\"I guess this works but we have to just change your attitude towards everybody\"\n\n\"Like?\"\n\n\"Being polite, oh and also let's study for the test!\"\n\n\". . .Ok let's do this!\"\n\n*back to third p.o.v*\n\nBoth of them spend time doing what they would never think they will be doing but they did it anyways. Y/n never taught she will be in a club smoking and drinking. Giu never taught he will be studying with Zhengting.\n\nTime skip~\n\nGiu was ready for the test and still was studying in the class waiting for the teacher to come in. Then someone open the door which Giu taught it was the teacher which wasn't it was his crush.\n\nA lot of people were looking at y/n shocked at what she was wearing. \"Stop looking at me! God.\" Y/n yelled at the people staring. Then she sat next Giu.\n\n\"Hi-\"\n\n\"y-y/n? Is that really you?\"\n\n\"Yeah who else\"\n\n\"But I thought you were quite and kind and also pretty-\"\n\n\"W-what?\"\n\n\"I liked you like that but you changed\"\n\n\"I-i thought you didn't- so I changed. . .\"\n\nThat's when y/n realize that she didn't have to change all she had to do is be confident and tell him.\n\n\"So are you going to-\"\n\n\"I have to go-\"\n\nY/n ran out the classroom and went straight to the restroom. She clean her face then went to her friend if she could barrow clothes. She thanked her then went to changed. Y/n put her glasses on and put her hair in a ponytail.\n\nLike they had a test she ran back and she was in time the teacher was barely handing out the test. Giu took a glance at y/n then smiled. Y/n has study since the teacher announced it so she hopefully pass it.\n\nTime skip~\n\nOnce the test finish people were already going to there other classes. Y/n was about to leave but then.\n\n\"Y/n wait!\"\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"So I was going to ask.. if you want to be my girlfriend\"\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\nY/n took no hesitation to agree. Giu smiled and went straight to hugging her. \"Don't change your self anymore, I love you the way you are\" y/n nodded and hugged him back."
