        "text": "Thomas’ track record in her sport is impressive, and she told NBC News she hopes to be an inspiration to young girls that they can pursue their interests on and off the field. She is living by example, having obtained an undergraduate degree in neurobiology and global health from Harvard University in 2019, the Ivy League school’s website notes. Fulfilling her degree was also done in the midst of earning 22 conference titles across six events and breaking school and Ivy League records in the 100m, 200m, and indoor 60m-races, her NBC Olympics profile states. She also became the first NCAA sprint champion in the Ivy League by winning the 200m race as a junior.\n\nUpon leaving Harvard, she continued her studies at the University of Texas and completed a master’s degree in public health accompanied by a capstone project that centered sleep epidemiology by 2023, per her Olympics profile.\n\nInspiring The Youth\n\nWhen Thomas is not competing, she is currently spending some of her time volunteering at an Austin, TX, clinic that helps the uninsured population and is running a hypertension program.\n\nHer overarching goal is to open her own hospital or nonprofit to make health care more accessible."
