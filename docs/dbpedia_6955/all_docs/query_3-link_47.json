        "text": "So recently, I’ve fallen in love with this K-pop girl group, OH!MYGirl (OMG)\n\nThey are under WM Entertainment and the sister group of B1A4. In total, there are 8 members of the group. One of the reasons I like this group is that each of the members have their own talents.\n\nMembers:\n\nStage name: Hyojung (효정)\n\nBirth Name: Choi Hyojung (최효정)\n\nBirthdate: 28 July 1994\n\nBlood Type: AB\n\nPart: Leader, Lead Vocalist\n\nShe is a very charming leader that takes good care of her members well. One of her charms is that she is always so bright and happy. Her voice is also awesome, check it out below.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDl1cJnArUo\n\nStage name: JinE (진이)\n\nBirth name: Shin Hyejin (신헤진)\n\nBirthdate: 22 January 1995\n\nBlood Type: A\n\nPart: Sub Vocalist\n\nTo be honest, I don’t really know much about JinE as she seems a more quiet person compared to the others, but I have read an article from allkpop that she had experienced anorexia due to a harsh diet. After reading this, I now see her as a more mature person as she was able to go through that and she became prettier now after cutting her hair short.\n\nCheck out this predebut video of her dancing to My My (Apink): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSECj0bC5CQ\n\nAnd this video of her imitating a train or rice cooker: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEhFFZyXZ2o\n\nStage name: Mimi (미미)\n\nBirth name: Kim Mihyun (김미현)\n\nBirthdate: 1 May 1995\n\nBlood Type: AB\n\nPart: Main Rapper, Main Dancer\n\nI really love her voice especially when she raps. To be honest, not a lot of girl groups have a great rapper, but she’s one of the girls in girl groups that stand out because of her rap. Check out this video of her rapping while YooA sings: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPghSBTPgpI\n\nStage name: YooA (유아)\n\nBirth name: Yoo Yeonju (유연주) => Yoo Sia (유시아)\n\nBirthdate: 17 September 1995\n\nBlood Type: A\n\nPart: Lead Vocalist, Main Dancer\n\nI really like her when she is in the MV of Closer because she looks so unreal like some sort of doll. And of course she is such a great dancer. If you don’t believe me, check out this video of her dancing with U-kwon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6JdS-E_bB8\n\nStage name: Seunghee (승희)\n\nBirth name: Hyun Seunghee (현승희)\n\nBirthdate: 25 January 1996\n\nBlood Type: B\n\nPart: Main Vocal\n\nShe is my bias in Oh My Girl as her voice is too wonderful to miss out. She was a contestant in Superstar K2 since a young age. Now, she is participating in JTBC Girl Spirit to promote Oh My Girl. Check out this video of her covering Twice’s Cheer Up: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KpU_Qs3V_k\n\nStage name: Jiho (지호)\n\nBirth name: Kim Jiho (김지호)\n\nBirthdate: 4 April 1997\n\nBlood Type: A\n\nPart: Lead Vocalist, Lead Dancer\n\nI don’t really know much about Jiho, but everyone thinks that she is very pretty after watching the Closer and Liar Liar MV. I think it’s sort of because her face, especially her eyes, look somewhat mysterious. I think she’s actually a really funny person though. Check out this video of her hilarious reaction: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqf9MRYKuK0\n\nStage name: Binnie (빈이)\n\nBirth name: Bae Yubin(배유빈)\n\nBirthdate: 9 September 1999\n\nBlood Type: O\n\nPart: Sub Vocalist\n\nBinnie is a very smart and funny person. I forgot where I read it but I saw that she is one of the smartest idols, even though she’s quite young. I just found out that she also played a small role in one of the legendary dramas, Baker King Kim Tak Gu. I think that she’s really funny in this reaction video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7JriAVwtAY\n\nStage name: Arin (아린)\n\nBirth name: Choi Yewon(최예원)\n\nBirthdate: 18 June 1999\n\nBlood Type: O\n\nPart: Maknae, Sub Vocalist\n\nShe’s a really cute maknae and you can see that in their new comeback, she became really cute. Even EXID’s Hani asks for her autograph in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdEGIk-2Xbc\n\nOh My Girl debuted on April 21, 2015 with the song ‘Cupid’. Cupid is a bright and energetic song that seems to liven up people’s mood upon hearing it. Check out the song below:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCrCUv6rQ7I\n\nTheir comeback after the debut is with a mysterious and fairy tale fantasy feeling titled ‘Closer’. I think it’s a really great song as the members get to show their unique voices in the songs, especially Mimi’s rap and Seunghee’s long note. This song is what made many people know about Oh My Girl, because of the unique choreography involving star signs. Check out the music video below:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isUudT58Xfk\n\nAfter this comeback comes ‘Liar Liar’, a catchy and bright song. Most of the members have dyed their hair so they look more fresh and of course prettier! Here is the song:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNZKqhXCv5c\n\nFollowing that is a repackage album with an additional song ‘Windy Day’. It’s a very unique song which feels like a ballad but with a more strong vibe. Check out the song and the member’s appearances:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJqhKWo89FQ\n\nThe newest song is from their summer special album, ‘A-ing’. Emphasizing maknae Arin’s cuteness, the girls showed what summer’s all about.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W4dL2Av6LE\n\nThanks for reading this post until the end! Please do support Oh My Girl as fellow Miracles! Let’s watch out for their future comebacks^^\n\nBONUS\n\nThis is one of my favorite clips of Oh My Girl, which is YooA, Hyojung and Seunghee singing Beyoncé’s Halo.
