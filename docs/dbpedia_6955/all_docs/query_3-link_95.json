        "text": "Miranda Derrick, the TikTok dancer featured in Netflix’s No. 1 docuseries, Dancing for the Devil: The 7M TikTok Cult, has finally responded to allegations that she is involved in a cult led by Robert Shinn, the owner of 7M Films talent management and the Shekinah Church.\n\nDerrick, also known by her maiden name Miranda Wilking, is a dancer and influencer signed to 7M Films, where she makes videos. Her family, including her sister Melanie (with whom she previously created dance content), told Netflix’s documentary Dancing for the Devil that Miranda is trapped in a brainwashing, cult-like environment led by Shinn.\n\nThe Wilking family claimed that Miranda began distancing herself from them after meeting her now-husband James (BDash) Derrick and signing with Los Angeles-based 7M Films, a talent management agency owned by Shinn, a pastor at Shekinah Church. In March 2022, 7M Films released a statement asserting its independence from Shekinah, but members of both organizations have accused Shinn of controlling behavior, according to Netflix.\n\nForbesThe Insane True Story Behind Netflix's 'Dancing For The Devil: The 7M TikTok Cult'\n\nThe Wiking family’s concerns were made public when they shared an Instagram video in February 2022 speculating that 7M was a cult and that Miranda was being manipulated. The new Netflix documentary also features interviews from dancers who have left 7M Films and are now seeking justice against Shinn — including Kevin \"Konkrete\" Davis, Kailea Gray and Kylie Douglas.\n\nAlmost one week after the documentary’s debut, Derrick released a video and written statement disputing her family’s claims. She also called the popular Netflix documentary — which is currently the No. 1 TV series on the platform — “a one-sided story.”\n\nWhat Did Miranda Derrick Say About Dancing For The Devil on Netflix?\n\nOn Tuesday, June 4, Miranda Derrick denied the allegations made by her family and others who called Robert Shinn’s 7M Films talent management company a cult.\n\n“Hey guys, I hope you’re having a wonderful day! I just wanted to hop on here really quick and first of all, say thank you so much to everybody who’s been so supportive during this time,” she started in a video shared to her Instagram Stories, according to People.\n\nWhile the dancer didn’t go “into too much detail because of legal purposes,” she said she wanted to share her side of the story. Derrick went on to share screenshots of her statement acknowledging the claims made in Netflix’s Dancing For the Devil.\n\n“I want to start by saying that I appreciate the concern that has been expressed for my well-being. Due to pending litigation, in which I am a plaintiff in a defamation lawsuit, it’s not appropriate for me to comment on specific allegations. Though I will state that I do not condone abuse in any way,” she penned in the post.\n\nWhile Derrick acknowledged that she loves her mom, dad, and sister Melanie and that they will “forever” be part of her life, she revealed that they “don’t see eye to eye at this time.”\n\nShe said Dancing for the Devil was “a one-sided story,” adding, “I gave my life to Jesus Christ in 2020 and asked my family for some space in the very beginning to collect my thoughts and process my new walk I wanted to take with God.”\n\nIn her statement, Derrick said that she started her own social media account because her sister “logged me out of our account and when I asked for access back she denied my request.” She also addressed missing her grandfather’s funeral, a moment highlighted in the docuseries, which implied that 7M was not allowing her to attend.\n\n“Before we went into the hospital to [say our last goodbyes], I started to pray for our Papa in the car and Melanie got offended, angry with me and told me to stop and to never pray around her,” Derrick added. She said that she chose not to go to the funeral because she was “being harassed” and “felt threatened by” her family.\n\n“I am just a woman trying to live my life. I am not a victim, I am not in any harm, I am not being abused. I’ve never asked my family or anyone else to ‘help’ me in any way. Respectfully, what I choose to do with my life is up to me,” the influencer explained.\n\nBefore the documentary was released, some social media users were confused after Miranda began posting content with her family on Instagram, including this recent May 27th photo at her sister’s wedding, a video with her mom for Mother’s Day in 2024, and another video dancing with her mom and sister in April.\n\nHowever, the docuseries alleges that these posts are mainly for show and that Miranda is still close to Shinn. Meanwhile, Melanie called her in-person interactions with her sister “superficial” and said they were orchestrated for Miranda’s social media accounts.\n\n“I am not held against my will and I’ve never been a hostage,” Miranda wrote previously in a different public statement. “I go to church and I have faith in God. If one day I wish to pursue my faith elsewhere, I will and feel completely free to do that. As far as my career, my time at 7M Films has been one of the most exciting years ever and if one day I wish to partner with a different management company or start my own company, I will.”\n\nNo criminal charges have been filed against Shinn.\n\nDancing for the Devil: The 7M TikTok Cult is streaming on Netflix."
