        "text": "One of the first rules of social media is that you simply cannot make anything go viral; it either goes or it doesn't. So, call it a happy accident that San Francisco-based Lian Amaris created what seems to be this holiday season's Tumblr sensation: Silicon Valley Ryan Gosling. She didn't do it for the attention, she did it for the funny.\n\n\"Personally, I crack myself several times a day, and I'm loving the positive feedback from the growing number of followers,\" Amaris said.\n\nThe site, inspired by other memes like Feminist Ryan Gosling, was launched on Dec. 20 and shot into internet stardom after being discovered by The Next Web (TNW) on Dec. 23. While the surge in popularity has been a fun side effect for Amaris, she really did this as an entertaining side project for the women in tech community. Most pointedly, of course, those who have dreams of their geeky men speaking and, well, looking like her geeky Silicon Valley Ryan Gosling creation.\n\n\"In all honesty, I'd be happy if the handful of women in tech who love it just kept following and responding -- it truly began as a labor of love for them,\" she said. \"I intend to keep it going until I have nothing left to say; but more importantly, very soon, I am going to open it up for submissions for those who want to add their perspectives as well.\"\n\nWhen I first reached out to Amaris, I made the presumption that she had a background in comedy writing, but the artist and entrepreneur does not. She currently focuses her efforts on creative and product management at identity authentication start-up Enole, based in San Francisco. She's also the co-founder of a site called BeYourOwnAwesome.com, which is focused on helping people address their fears and develop personalized plans to instill the skills to bring about significant life change. She does this with her partner, Mary Shenouda, a fellow \"agent of awesome.\"\n\nDespite Silicon Valley Ryan Gosling's popularity, Amaris said it hasn't yet had any major impact on her professional life outside of the meme.\n\n\"Professionally, this project has yet to impact me. I'm sitting in my cubicle, still in beta, waiting for someone to call me and ask me to write for them,\" she said. \"Until they do, I suppose I'll keep writing it for fun.\"\n\nAnd she'll keep doing it on Tumblr, which has become the preeminent platform for memes. TNW also reported that Tumblr hit a 10 billion post milestone. Amaris said she put Silicon Valley Ryan Gosling on Tumblr mainly due to \"peer pressure.\"\n\n\"All of the other Ryans were Tumblrs, and frankly, it's the cleanest, easiest way to post all the things I might need for the blog,\" she said. \"I'm considering the sexiness of Jux for the future, but for the moment, Tumblr has the optimal audience for a project like this.\"\n\nAside from the popular Gosling memes, Amaris has also been inspired by Sam Smith's \"Philosoraptor\", \"Casually Pepperspray Everything Cop\" and the classic, \"All Your Base Are Belong To Us.\"\n\n\"Of course, the nature of memes is that they evolve,\" she said. \"If you asked next week, my favorites might be different.\"\n\nAs much fun as Amaris is having with this, she does have realistic expectations even with her plans to help grow the site through collaboration. And, even if realistic, she wouldn't mind getting the attention of the superstar. What fan wouldn't?\n\n\"Alas, I have yet to hear anything from Ryan's camp. Unfortunately.\""
