        "text": "Hello members,\n\nRecently i created a project with columns and tasks, added project members. After all the hard work, suddenly the project is missing. I think it’s deleted by someone but don’t know who did it. How can i recover a deleted project or find the project member who deleted the project ?\n\nThank You\n\nAbinesh\n\nIn the sidebar, click on Show Archived Projects at the bottom of the team list where the project lived. If it is listed there, you can select to unarchive the project.\n\nMore information is on Asana Guide Setting Up a Project in Asana | Product Guide • Asana Product Guide\n\nThere’s a difference between archiving and deleting a project. When you archive, the project goes into an “Archived projects” area. This is best used to keep your account tidy without removing any information as you can always recover archived projects if you need to.\n\nOn the flip side, when you delete a project, it’s gone for good… Sorry (unless you email Asana, perhaps they have a backup or something)\n\nHi @Abinesh_Sanskrriti\n\nJust looking at your screenshot, it’s clear that the project wasn’t archived, because the ‘Show archived projects’ option isn’t there. Also, archived tasks would still appear in My Tasks as long as they’re assigned to you.\n\nWhen a project’s deleted, the owner of the project gets a notification and a link to recover it. So, if you set up the project, you should have received that notification. I would check your emails and notifications for the link to recover the project if it was deleted.\n\nIf you can’t find that link, you should contact Asana and ask if they can recover it.\n\nGood luck!\n\nI would like to have admin control in asana that if im the project owner.I would like to have “tasks lockdown” like once they create a task they can only tick when completed and not delete task or project. I really like asana but everyone in the project is getting admin controls. Also if i create a project and add some team members, anyone in the project can change me to just member from project owner or remove me from the project. Is there a project admin feature ?\n\nHi again. An admin has extra controls over security, billing and project members. However, Asana is built on a very open ethos, so all members can edit and delete everything. I do agree that there’s a case for being able to lock down certain elements as read-only, but that function isn’t currently available.\n\nHere’s a guide to what admins can do:\n\nHi , I have a problem where I can’t recover a project that I accidentally deleted.\n\nI have clicked the link in the email I received to undo the deletion, but I receive an error message\n\n\"“You do not have access to the deleted project. Are you sure you are logged in to the account that deleted it?”\n\nI am definitely logged in with the same account. I have already sent an email to the support email and I’m waiting for a reply. Is there anything else I can do? How soon should I expect a reply to my email?\n\nAnyone else experienced a similar issue? How did you resolve it?\n\nThanks in Advance.\n\nThis needs to change, OPEN ETHOS has failed thousands of users and our teams as well. Delete handling is not sufficient.\n\nThere NEEDS to be a deleted items bin that everyone in the project can view and recover from. It should show who deleted the item and when. Also there should not be a permanently delete option unless you’re an admin, or unless you were the one that created the item you deleted.\n\n+1 on this! well said @Technology!\n\nI am a trainer & help people learn partnership thru technology.\n\nSometimes the engagement will stall and clients will delete the shared project we created.\n\nThis makes picking up the engagement later a bit difficult.\n\nI am definitely in favor of a shared delete bin. I run into this situation again and again.\n\nIf anyone has created a thread to vote specifically on this idea of a shared delete bin, please kindly point the way as you have my vote!"
