        "text": "The first line of an email is your first impression—it can be stressful to figure out what to write that sets the tone you want for the rest of the email.\n\nLuckily, there are many options for getting an email started. Here is a list of the best email greetings organized by various situations you might find yourself in. But first, watch our video to learn tips for better emails:\n\nWhat is an Email Greeting?\n\nAn email greeting is the opening line of an email. It sets the tone for the rest of the correspondence. Depending on what opener you use, it can convey a combination of professionalism, friendliness, warmth, or set a casual tone.\n\nIt’sAvoiding more professional email openers when writing a professional contact is typically safest. You’ll rarely have someone get upset because you were “too formal,” however, depending on the situation, you can offend by being overly casual.\n\nTried and True Greetings for (Almost) Any Occasion\n\nClassics are classic for a reason. While not super unique or memorable, these email greetings are safe for most occasions.\n\nHi [name],\n\nThis is a to-the-point option for starting an email. Addressing it to the person’s name makes it personal and warm without feeling overly casual.\n\nPro Tip: Here are some general guidelines for using the recipient’s first name, last name, or both!\n\nUse “Hi [first name]” when :\n\nYou know the person well and would address them by their first name in person\n\nYou’re emailing someone you don’t know well, but they introduced themselves using their first name\n\nOpt for “Hi Mr./Ms./Dr./Professor [last name]” when:\n\nYou haven’t yet met the person you’re writing to\n\nThey introduced themselves to you with their last name\n\nStick with “Hi [first name] [last name]” when:\n\nYou’re not sure if it would be more appropriate to address them by their first or last name\n\nYou’re not sure of the gender of the person you’re writing to\n\nPay attention to how they sign off in their response and use that moving forward.\n\nHappy [day of the week]!\n\nA simple and positive email greeting is wishing someone a happy Monday… Tuesday, or Thursday. You can also ask about their previous weekend, how their week is going, or any exciting weekend plans.\n\nI hope this email finds you well,\n\nWhen you start by wishing the recipient well, you’re setting the tone of the conversation as pleasant without requiring them to give you too much personal information. That makes it a great option for someone you haven’t written to in a while (and you don’t know how they’re doing).\n\nI hope you’re having a pleasant day,\n\nSimilar to “I hope this email finds you well,” but the well wish is a little more immediate. It’s a good option for someone you’ve written with more recently.\n\nGood morning/afternoon/evening,\n\nThis works well as a warm, to-the-point way to start an email. You can send it to an individual or a larger group of people.\n\nDear [Name],\n\nThis greeting is a timeless and universally accepted way to begin an email. It’s formal and personal, making it an excellent choice for almost any situation. Whether you’re writing to a colleague, a new acquaintance, or even a long-time friend in a more formal context, “Dear [Name]” sets a respectful and professional tone from the get-go.\n\nWarm greetings,\n\nThis opening is versatile and conveys a sense of cordiality right from the start. It’s suitable for formal and informal emails, depending on the context. The word “warm” adds some personal affection, too.\n\nProfessional Email Greetings\n\nWhen writing a professional email greeting, err on being more formal—but that doesn’t mean it has to be “stuffy.” Here are some professional, formal ways to start an email!\n\nLots of professionals appreciate getting straight to the point—it shows that you respect their time and have a concrete reason for reaching out to them.\n\nI’m writing you to…\n\nSimilar to the last one, this lets you jump straight to the message’s main point with no fuss.\n\n[Insert name] suggested I reach out to you,\n\nThis is a great professional introduction email if you’ve never personally talked to the person you’re contacting. It gives them context for why you’re writing them and who your mutual acquaintance is.\n\nI’d appreciate your input on…\n\nThis greeting invites a conversation and shows that you respect their opinion and expertise.\n\nI wanted to touch base with you about…\n\n“Touch base” is a broad term used in many professional settings. This opener helps you dive right into the main purpose of your correspondence.\n\nRegarding our ongoing collaboration,\n\nThis greeting sets a professional and focused tone for emails that pertain to ongoing projects or partnerships. It’s a polished way to start a message when you collaborate, signaling the recipient that the email will discuss aspects of your joint work.\n\nAs we continue to explore new opportunities,\n\nThis professional email greeting is perfect for conversations that involve ongoing discussions, negotiations, or the exploration of new projects. It suggests a forward-thinking approach and a readiness to engage in further discussions or actions.\n\nEmail Greetings to Send Someone You Just Met\n\nHave you ever talked with someone, gotten their business card, but did not know how to start the follow-up email? It can be stressful. You don’t want to assume that they remember you, but you also don’t want to imply that you think they don’t.\n\nGive them a few context cues right off the bat. Things like the name of the event or place you met or the name of the person who introduced you can be really helpful.\n\nGreat meeting you at [event/place],\n\nBy giving the recipient context for where they know you from, you’ll help jog their memory. You’ll also bring back memories of when you last met—hopefully you made a good impression!\n\nFollowing up on our conversation at [event/place],\n\nThis is a great opener if you had a great conversation with someone at a networking event that got cut short when one of you needed to leave, but you managed to swap business cards or personal contact information. This opener gives a little context for where they know you from and lets you dive back into the conversation.\n\nCarrying forward the spark from our conversation at [event/place],\n\nThis opener takes a creative leap by framing your initial meeting as a moment where a conversational “spark” was ignited, suggesting enthusiasm and a keen interest to explore where this newfound connection could lead.\n\nReconnecting after our meeting at [event/place],\n\nThis opener is excellent when you’ve had a brief yet memorable encounter with someone and wish to extend the conversation beyond the initial meeting. It’s also straightforward and succinct.\n\nHello from [your name], I enjoyed talking with you about [topic] at [place you met],\n\nAlthough this email greeting is quite long, it gives the person all the context cues they need to remember you. Try this out if you met them at an event with many people, and you’re not sure they will remember meeting you.\n\nIn light of our recent meeting at [event/place],\n\nThis is the most formal option in this section—use it wisely and it can serve you well! A more formal option like this can be good for someone you hope will become a professional mentor.\n\nIt was nice meeting you at [event/place],\n\nIf you’re looking for a nice, pleasant way to establish an initial connection, look no further! With this opener, you don’t need a long email correspondence, but you can solidify the meeting and ensure they have your contact information for the future.\n\nGratitude Email Openers\n\nExpressing gratitude at the start of an email sets a warm, appreciative tone for your message. Here are five distinctive ways to artfully weave thanks into your email openers!\n\nI appreciate your help!\n\nSimple, yet relatable. It’s perfect for conveying gratitude in a personal and meaningful way.\n\nI’m incredibly thankful for our collaboration\n\nThis phrase celebrates the success of working together when aiming to thank a partner or colleague for their efforts. It acknowledges the value of teamwork and sets a positive tone for future interactions.\n\nGrateful for your insights on [specific topic]\n\nSpecifying the advice or feedback you’re thankful for shows you value and have thought deeply about their input.\n\nThank you for lighting the way forward\n\nIdeal for thanking someone who has guided during challenging times, this phrase appreciates their role in helping you deal with uncertainty with a positive influence.\n\nYour support has been instrumental in our growth\n\nThis opener is excellent for expressing appreciation to someone who has significantly contributed to your personal or professional growth. It recognizes their crucial role in a heartfelt manner, reinforcing the value of their support.\n\nEmail Greetings for Various Stages of the Job Search Process\n\nThere’s so much more to getting the job you want than a resume. Throughout the job application process, there are many different people you’ll likely end up corresponding with. A professional and warm email can help you make a great first impression or be more memorable.\n\nWe haven’t had the privilege of meeting, but I saw we both attended [name of school]!\n\nOftentimes, alumni will help one another out. If you’re applying for a job, it can be a good idea to find out if any alumni from your school already work there. You can often find this information on LinkedIn. Then, ask them if they’d be willing to answer some questions about company culture or the job.\n\nThank you for your time today,\n\nAfter a phone call with a mutual connection or person from the same alma mater, send a thank-you note! This will help you continue to build a positive relationship from that first conversation.\n\nReflecting on our engaging discussion about [position title],\n\nThis greeting is suitable for follow-up emails after an interview or an informal conversation about the role. It emphasizes the quality of the discussion and your thoughtful consideration of the position’s responsibilities and how they align with your skills and experiences.\n\nIt was a pleasure talking with you,\n\nThis is a great way to start an interview follow-up email. Let the interviewer know that you appreciate their time and reiterate from the interview why you believe you would be a good fit for the position.\n\nI’m grateful to be considered for this position,\n\nWhen sending a post-interview email, you want to find the right balance between expressing gratitude and confidence. Since this email leans more towards gratitude, follow up with aspects of your expertise and experience that you’re confident would benefit the company and make you the right fit for the job.\n\nI enjoyed learning more about the specifics of [position title],\n\nThroughout the process, remember that not only is the company deciding whether they feel you’ll be the right fit for them, but you’re also deciding if they’re the right fit for you professionally.\n\nSometimes, you’ll realize the position isn’t the right fit. If that’s the case, try this email greeting, and then kindly let them know that you won’t be continuing in the interview process.\n\nEager to contribute and grow within [Company Name],\n\nThis greeting is particularly effective when reaching out to a potential employer after submitting your application or after an initial screening call.\n\nStarters for Meeting Follow-up Emails\n\nIf you’re sending a follow-up email from a meeting, help the recipient know what to expect from the rest of the correspondence by getting straight to the point. Keep it short and sweet—after all, you know how busy your team members are after a meeting!\n\nPer our phone call,\n\nThere are often action points coming out of a meeting. This is a direct, to-the-point way of sending any materials or follow-up points from the meeting.\n\nPer our conversation,\n\nUse this when your email is following up on a conversation you already had with the recipient.\n\nFollowing up on our recent meeting,\n\nThis works well for any type of follow-up, whether you’re providing additional information, summarizing key points discussed, or outlining next steps.\n\nSending the [documents/follow-up email/task list…] as promised,\n\nIt’s not uncommon that in a meeting, you’ll be asked to send out some information to everyone present. These could be meeting notes, various documents you have, or research you’ve compiled on a topic just to name a few. Getting straight to the point’ll help people remember why your email is relevant and why they should keep reading!\n\nHere is the [research/article] I mentioned,\n\nIf an article was mentioned during the meeting, send the meeting attendees a follow-up note with the resource you mentioned.\n\nI’m glad we got to touch base on [topic of meeting],\n\nThis is a warm way to start a post-meeting email. Generally speaking, if you meet with someone regularly, you don’t need to send a note unless there’s some further information you promised you’d send them. However, if you rarely meet someone, you might want to send a pleasant “It was nice talking with you today!” note.\n\nJust sending a recap of what we talked about today,\n\nIt’s a good idea to have important discussion points in writing. Towards the end of a meeting, let the other person know that you’ll send an email with the main points you discussed and any decisions you came to. Despite being less formal than meeting minutes, it’s a good idea to have a “paper trail” of any important decisions you and the person you met with came to.\n\nThis email starter is a direct bridge from a previous encounter, neatly tying the past conversation to the present follow-up. It’s an efficient way to remind the recipient of the specific context and timing of your last meeting, making it easier for them to recall the details and relevance of your email.\n\nEmail Greetings for Cold Outreach\n\nA captivating opener in a cold outreach email grabs attention and demonstrates your genuine interest in forming a connection. Here’s how to craft unique and compelling email greetings that stand out!\n\n[Recipient’s Name], I’ve got something for you!\n\nPersonalize your cold outreach by directly mentioning the recipient’s name, showing that your email isn’t just another generic message.\n\n“Your insights on [topic] inspired me to reach out”\n\nAcknowledging a specific piece of work, talk, or publication by the recipient shows that your interest is sincere and well-informed. This personalization shows that you’re reaching out based on their expertise.\n\nMy team + yours = success! (here’s what I’m thinking)\n\nThis opener suggests a dynamic and forward-thinking approach to potential collaboration. It’s especially effective if you’re in a tech or creative industry, signaling that you value innovation and see a unique opportunity for synergy between your respective projects or companies.\n\nLet’s help each other towards [common goal]\n\nIdentifying a shared goal or vision in your opening line immediately creates a sense of camaraderie and purpose. It’s an excellent way to show that you’ve researched their business and understand and align with their broader mission.\n\nAfter seeing your results on [achievement], I’m impressed!\n\nStarting your email with a statement acknowledging the recipient’s influence or achievements in their field demonstrates respect and genuine interest. It’s a compelling way to introduce yourself, making it clear that you’re reaching out because you value what they bring to the table and you see potential in connecting further.\n\nGroup Email Greetings\n\nSending a group email can be tricky. If it’s going to more than two or three people, you probably won’t want to list out each recipient’s name. Instead, opt for something more general.\n\nHere are some ideas for when you’re feeling stuck on how to start writing a large group email.\n\nGreetings,\n\nThis can be a good option for a group email where you’re trying to balance professional and pleasant. It’s relatively formal, short enough to respect everyone’s time, and a warm way to start.\n\nHello all,\n\n“All” can be a good alternative to listing everyone’s name. It acknowledges that it’s a group email while staying short and sweet.\n\nHi team,\n\nThis is a more casual option than “Hello all.” Use this with groups you talk with regularly, like a team you work closely with.\n\nHope this finds you well,\n\nThis greeting is versatile and considerate, suitable for various group email contexts, from formal updates to more casual team communications.\n\nI saw this [blog post/article/research] and thought you might find it interesting,\n\nTry sending this email greeting when you find an article relevant to your team. It gets straight to the point, hopefully encouraging people to read the article.\n\nI’m glad to announce…\n\nThey say, “teamwork makes the dreamwork.” Use this email to inform your whole team of goals you’ve reached or positive customer feedback you want to encourage your team.\n\nFormal Responses to Emails\n\nLet’s say you’re on the receiving end of an email. How do you respond? Here are a few pleasant, formal options for responding to an email from a professional connection.\n\nYour message is greatly appreciated,\n\nWhether the email contains information, a request, or an update, this opening is a nice way to keep it polite and professional.\n\nGreat to hear from you,\n\nThis is a great option if it’s been a while since you’ve talked with the person who emailed you. They may have been nervous to reach out, so you can put their nerves at ease from the very first sentence by letting them know you’re happy to hear from them.\n\nThank you for following up,\n\nUse this if someone has taken the time to send you an email after a meeting.\n\nThank you for the email,\n\nOpt for this option if you met someone at an event or through a mutual friend and they’ve emailed you first.\n\nI’m glad you reached out,\n\nThis is a pleasant and warm way to let someone know you’re glad they took the time to contact you.\n\nI apologize for the delay,\n\nIdeally, you should respond to emails within one or two business days, but sometimes, for one reason or another, an email response gets delayed. By apologizing quickly, you can help disperse any frustration the other person may feel about waiting for your response.\n\nIf you want, you can follow this up by giving a reason for the delay. For example, “I just got back from vacation,” or, “I had to connect with someone else before I could respond to you.”\n\nThank you for your quick response,\n\nIt’s nice to hear back from someone quickly! Express your gratitude by thanking them.\n\nEmail Greetings to Send a Potential Client\n\nWhen emailing a potential new client, you want to make a good first impression (and write an email that doesn’t look like spam). Keep it professional and warm while letting them know who you are, how you can help them, or where you met. Here are a few email greetings to help you do everything!\n\nHi from [your name] at [your company name],\n\nIf you met a potential client, this can be a good way to help them place you right from the introduction. This will help give them a framework for who you are and where they know you from.\n\nIn response to your inquiry,\n\nIf a potential client has reached out with a question, you can start the response email by letting them know that you’re getting back to them with an answer.\n\n[Mutual friend’s name] suggested I reach out to you,\n\nReferencing a mutual acquaintance can increase your credibility.\n\nLet me introduce myself,\n\nWhile this isn’t the best email opener, it works well as a cold email introduction to someone you’re hoping to work with. Use this if you don’t have a mutual connection you can reference. It’s a straight-to-the-point, easygoing way of starting an introduction email.\n\nFollowing up on my previous email,\n\nYou may need to send a follow-up email when cold pitching to a prospective client. Since they don’t already know you, a follow-up email can help assure them that your email was meant for them and keep you on their radar.\n\nCasual Email Greetings for Your Work Bestie\n\nDepending on your industry, you might get away with less-than-formal openers when emailing coworkers. When emailing a boss or a new client, opt for more formal options. However, formality can sometimes feel out of place when writing to a colleague you work closely with. If you’re looking for a friendly greeting for a coworker you work with closely, consider using one of these!\n\nHi there!\n\nThis is a less formal alternative to “Hi [their name].” It works well when sent to a teammate, followed by, “I just had a quick question about XYZ” or, “Just wanted to check in about XYZ.” It conveys friendliness and warmth while also diving right into business.\n\nHowdy,\n\nThis is VERY informal, so only use it if you have established rapport with the coworker you’re sending this email to. But if you have a coworker you email on a multiple-times-per-day basis, this old western classic might bring a smile to their face.\n\nBonus: If you are in Hawaii or are feeling adventurous, you can also try Aloha!\n\nHey hey,\n\nAnother casual one to use when emailing your work friends. Avoid sending this to your boss or someone you don’t have an established relationship with.\n\nMe again!\n\nThis works best for the second or third email of the day to the same person. Even then, only use it if you know the person receiving the email is okay with super casual greetings.\n\nHow are you?\n\nIn this instance, you may or may not get an answer to the question, but don’t worry about that. “How are you?” is a pleasant and casual way to start an email to someone you have an established relationship with.\n\nQuick question for you,\n\nThis can help you and your coworker both stay in work mode. Use this when you need their help on a project, but don’t anticipate it taking long. For example, maybe you need the email of someone they know or are wondering if they can help you use a certain feature on a company software.\n\nIt’s almost Friday!\n\nIt’s good to celebrate the small joys of the week.\n\nEmail Greetings to Steer Clear Of (And What to Write Instead!)\n\nSteer clear of options that are on the end of overly formal or overly casual. Here are a few examples that aren’t usually the best option with a few ideas of what to use instead. If you can make “Hey girl,” or “To whom it may concern,” work for you, go for it!\n\nHey girl!\n\nFeel free to send this to your best friend, but steer clear of this in almost every other context. It has such a casual option that it fits better in a text message than an email greeting. Instead try, “Hi there!” for a casual work friend, or, “Hi [recipient’s name]” for a slightly more personal feel.\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nThis is way too formal. While it’s good to be respectful, stick with an option that feels less like you took it from the pages of a Victorian-era novel. Try swapping this one out for, “I thought this article might be of interest,” or, “Hello everyone,” depending on where the email is going.\n\nHola! [or “hello” in a language different than the body of the text]\n\nIf you can follow “Hola” by (truthfully) saying, “writing to you from Mexico City,” or “Bonjour from Paris,” then you can maybe get away with it. For the most part, steer clear of greeting the recipient in a different language from the body of the email. It can feel culturally insensitive.\n\nIf you want to let someone know you’re traveling, try, “Greetings from [insert country name],” or, “Writing to you from [country name].”\n\nWhat’s good?\n\nDoes anyone know how to answer this? Not only is it a bit awkward, but it’s also more fitting as a text message than in an email. Instead of “What’s good?” try, “I hope this email finds you well,” or, “How are you?”\n\nSalutation,\n\nThis email greeting falls more on the side of stuffy rather than formal. Instead of this, try “Greetings,” it can be used in similar formal group email situations but has more warmth.\n\nI’d like to pick your brain about…\n\nAs a general rule, steer clear of “picking brains.” Instead, try something like, “I had a few questions I believe are within your scope of expertise.” This sounds more formal in a good way and also helps the recipient know why you reached out to them specifically with your questions. If they don’t have the answers, it will be easy for them to redirect you to the appropriate person.\n\nBonus: Avoid Common Email Etiquette Mistakes\n\nThe unwritten rules of email can be tricky. Avoiding certain mistakes ensures your emails reflect well on you… and also ensure your emails get read!\n\nHere are key guidelines to keep in mind:\n\nKey Takeaway: Set the Tone With an Intentional Email Greeting\n\nRemember that the first few lines of your email help set the tone of the entire correspondence. Here are a few rule-of-thumb tips to keep in mind when you’re sending emails:\n\nIt’s generally better to be more formal, especially when emailing with a boss, hiring manager, professor, mentor, or someone else you want to communicate respect to.\n\nIf you don’t have a strongly established relationship, help the recipient of your email remember who you are—mention what you talked about, where you met, or who you both know.\n\nYou can usually ease up on the formality for colleagues you work closely with and go for some more friendly email greetings.\n\nIf in doubt, “Hi/Hello [name]” is almost always a safe option—it’s neither super formal nor overly casual."
