        "text": "What kind of side dish looks nice and special but is very simple to make? Hot soup is a good answer but something fatty will also be a good choice, as long as it’s very delicious.\n\nSpicy-stir fried pork is the perfect dish that I was thinking of. Just follow the recipe and make a delicious, irresistible, spicy, shiny, stir-fried pork dish in 15 minutes! I posted the video and the recipe years ago on my website, and it’s also one of my cookbook recipes, but this updated version is slightly modified and improved.\n\nThis time I used pre-cut pork sold at a Korean grocery store, but you can also just get pork belly at your local butcher and cut it into think pieces about 1/8 inch thick. You could also replace pork belly with chicken breast, slightly frozen so you can slice it thinly and nicely.\n\nServes 3 to 4\n\nIngredients\n\n1 pound pork belly, cut into bite size pieces (1/8 inch thick)\n\n¼ cup hot pepper paste (gochujang)\n\n1 tablespoon soy sauce\n\n1 tablespoon sugar\n\n2 tablespoons hot pepper flakes (gochu-garu)\n\n¼ teaspoon ground black pepper\n\n1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil\n\n5 garlic cloves, minced\n\n1 teaspoon ginger, minced\n\n1 medium size onion, sliced\n\n4 green onions, sliced\n\n1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds\n\nDirections\n\nHeat up a large, thick skillet (or pan) over medium high heat.\n\nAdd pork, hot pepper paste, soy sauce, sugar, hot pepper flakes, black pepper, and toasted sesame oil.\n\nMix it well, stirring with a wooden spoon. Cook it for a few minutes until the pork is well mixed with the seasonings.\n\nAdd garlic, ginger, onion, and green onions. Stir and cook for 12 to 15 minutes until the pork is fully cooked and juicy and a little crispy.\n\nTransfer to a serving plate and serve with rice, kimchi, lettuce, ssamjang, and more side dishes."
