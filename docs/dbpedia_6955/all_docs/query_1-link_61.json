When things were so simple, and every day was seen through rose-tinted glasses. The goofiness of those days was so fun, and this anime made me reminisce about those days back then. It’s a rather simple anime, where a quiet girl, who is seen as unlikeable and gloomy, meets a boy so positive, upbeat, and dense that a supposedly derogatory nickname like “Grim Reaper” is just so cool to him.\n\nWe all likely had a first friend we made when we were kids, and that person was probably special to us. A lot our time was probably spent in the company ... of that first friend, and perhaps some of our fondest memories came at that point in our lives. For Akane Nishimura, the gloomy girl who everyone calls “Grim Reaper”, her first friend in Taiyou Takada, the most positive guy around, was something special. Someone who found her presence endearing, someone who wanted to be around her and hang out, something seemingly trivial like that can mean so much. It was simply such a wholesome ride seeing their friendship blossom, to the point it made me tear up multiple times throughout the show. Sure, there’s some romance in there, but it’s more innocent and sweet than anything else. It isn’t the most realistic anime out there, especially with its portrayal of bullying, but that’s not to say it isn’t believable, since kids do tend to call either names in elementary school.\n\nVisually, the ceiling was low, but I did like the simplistic art style, with a relaxing colour palette, and fun character expressions. The soundtrack was not hugely noticeable, but complimented the show well. The ED was both great in the song itself and visually, and quickly became one of my favourite endings of the season.\n\nRomcoms can fall into the common theme of staying in the status quo for a long time, and while the male protagonist in this show is dense like you’d see in other romcoms, it’s a very endearing and adorable type of dense, as you’d expect from a kid. Even so, the progression and development of characters was pretty solid, with some “little kid drama” that was resolved without it dragging for too long. The pacing felt pretty well done for some organic and natural interaction between all the characters.\n\nI’ll keep this review pretty brief, this was just such an adorable show that had me smiling (or tearing up) for most of its episodes. For me, it reminded me of my childhood and the goofiness that entailed it. It was a warming, healing experience every Sunday morning, and was one of my favourite anime of the season without a doubt. It was pure sweetness, yet had its share of impactful moments. Highly recommend this one!\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nThe more sweeter version of Boku no Kokoro!\n\nIn all seriousness, I had a pleasure, and enjoyment watching this series. It's not a super amazing show, but it doesn't have to be. In seasons where you'll have violent and epic encounters. Weirder than weird. Some usual sports anime, and many, many. MANY Isekai animes. Sometimes you just need a show that is harmless, cute, wholesome, and so much more in that regard. It's the kind of show to sit back, relax, and enjoy.\n\nStory and characters: 8\n\nWhile on the surface, some of the characters do come off as one note, but is that really an issue? As ... one pointed it out, it helps that we're seeing Nishimura's journey. Her first friend, her first proper friend, and how actually handles having a first firend. I think too, what helps this show a lot, is it's tone. If this was a more older show, I doubt it would've hit as much. But more the fact they're quite young, it stretches out to more wholesome and cute. You can already picture Nishimura as she grows,being more confident and cute, and it's all thanks to her clueless friend. Throw in some antagonising characters here or there,and a few family members, and you've got a good solid line up of characters.\n\nThere isn't a lot to understand to really get the point of the show. It's as if we're watching a more sweet and wholesome child friendly version of Another, and instead of deaths, its filled with nothing but sweet things, and long may that continue.We're watching kids being kids, and even tackling real feelings, as we see through Nishimura's doubts and worries about herself from her bullies. Seeing her overcome such and more,all thanks to her clueless friend. How so god damn sweet.\n\nArt and sound: 6\n\nI' gonna say it out right, as there is bound to be those who'll point it out. The art style is certainly different then what you would see in anime. Is it ugly? Not atall! It's a nice style, and while it's not amazing, it fits perfectly with the show, and it's relaxed colours even feel different than normal anime. The animation also flows quite nicely, with character reactions and voices all sounding good. I do admire the OP to boot as well.\n\nJijou wo Shiranai is an adorable show, and is a sweet watch. I'd recommend it for those who want something sweet to enjoy.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nAdorable, wholesome,cute, amazing,and heart warming.\n\nThis anime is just so wholesome,i can't but smile,everytime Nishimura smile, everytime Taiyou being clueless i just can't contained my smile. There this warm and satisfying feeling of seeing a \"bully\" victim get a friend,being acknowledge, feeling happy and feel flustered by the act of kindness thay never been performed on her.\n\nThe animation is not the best in general but it's perfect for this one,sometimes animation doesn't need to so detailed or have like thousand frames, sometimes you only need it good enough to tell a calm and warming story like this, it's serene, it's simple and it's adorable.\n\nThe great opening ... and ending makes this anime even better,the melody of the song,the animation for it, everything is just perfect.\n\nChildhood is beautiful,it should be beautiful ,and this anime perfectly depict it.\n\nEveryone deserve a friend like Taiyou and everyone deserve a friend like Nishimura.\n\nEvery seasons have their own \"warming light of the sun\" anime but well apparently we have three this season and Jijou wo Shiranai Tenkousei ga Guigui Kuru is the best at being so.\n\nPlease watch it if you need some healing for your heart and your eyes.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nMy clueless friend is legitimately one of the most wholesome, heart warming and endearing anime I’ve ever seen. A true hidden gem in a packed season that deserved much more love.\n\nBeing a kid is hard. Children are often picked on and made fun of for the most minuscule of reasons. While many times it’s harmless, often times it crosses into downright cruel bullying. The most unfortunate part of it is that you never know what other people are going through. People crack those jokes and have no idea the impact of what they’re saying. The overall message of this anime is to be kind. Treat ... everyone with respect and try to understand those that are different.\n\nMy clueless best friend is both entertaining and informative as I do genuinely believe seeing something like this motivates you to be a better person. To be more empathetic and to be kinder to people.\n\nThe things that Nishimura is subjected to simply because of her quiet nature and appearance really broke my heart and hit a little close to home. I absolutely loved she and Takada’s relationship, though. Him coming to her aid every time she was getting picked on put the biggest smile on my face.\n\nTheir relationship is the purest thing I’ve seen in a long time. Every time someone puts Nishimura down, he’s there to offer a compliment to restore her self confidence. Not just to make her feel better, but because of how he genuinely feels. There’s romantic subtext as the tag suggests, but it’s more of a friendship story with the two of them learning what it means to truly have a friend you can rely on.\n\nI really liked seeing the characters’ backstories in this one too. Both Nishimura and Takada have had very sad events to occur, but despite it all Takada keeps a massive smile on his face and tries to spread that positive energy to everyone. A message that I think we can all take something from. In fact, we all need a friend like this.\n\nThis is probably one of the most realistic depictions of a middle school I’ve seen. The characters behave how kids at that age do, for better or worse, and that’s really impressive for an anime to pull off.\n\nArt style is quite unique for anime as well. They went with a unique colour palette and character design that I think fits the tone of the story and the characters well.\n\nI could honestly go on for hours talking about this show, but you just need to watch it, man. It is beyond cute. Arguably the cutest show of the year thus far. Words don’t do it justice. You’ll will not regret this one at all.\n\nMy Clueless Friend Gets 10, out of 10.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nThis show is the definition of the \"ABCs of love, HOW?\": Adorable, Boku no Kokoro, Cutesy, Heartwarming (and) Objectively Wholesome?\"\n\nFor a long time now, rom-coms have felt one and the same as the years passed, no matter how many works and shows have been released over the years. But in the case where most of it happens in school, it's always the high-school scene that gets the most rap for being the same thing all over again. Wouldn't it be nice if that formula could be replicated for an even younger setting of puppy love? That's where mangaka Taku Kawamura's Jijou wo Shiranai Tenkousei ga ... Guigui Kuru. a.k.a My Clueless First Friend, comes into the picture, being that of an elementary-school like comedy and slice-of-life story that has romantic subtexts in it, which makes for an interesting show and source material overall.\n\nAsk anybody if he/she did plough through their young days being bullied, because children are just immature and grow up in the kind of environment where they choose their friends, and accuse others of being different, leaving the accused to the detriment of their well-being. This is exactly the case for Akane Nishimura, who is a quiet, almost gothic-looking girl with the apt \"Grim Reaper\" nickname because of the way she looks and is often bullied by her classmates for their dislike of her, thinking that she would curse and bring misfortune to them. That all changes when a transfer student by the name of Taiyou Takada comes in, and being a fan of the supernatural, he befriends the Grim Reaper without any context of what is going on around him, and that says the story and plot for the antithesis of the aptly named \"Clueless First Friend\" that would change Akane's life for the better, and, in the process, turn that support into fluttery feelings of love.\n\nFirst off, let's segregate the cast of characters into the two obvious groups: the bullies and the victims. There is no doubt that Akane had all of the unheeded BS handed towards her, because let's face it: elementary school children are still developing in their early phases of their likes and dislikes, and bullying has been that one constant aspect that would just not go away, to the consequences of the victimised, having to suffer early episodes in order to be strong by themselves. And to be honest, even with Takada around to defend Akane by re-directing all of the hate onto him, anyone would have the balls to say that they would stand alongside the victimised all the way through, only to reverse that and say to stand with the bullies instead. And these people, I'd not hesitate to call them out for being hypocrites, for not honouring their word. But Takada is built differently: he is the literal meaning of \"I don't care, just let me have my fun\". And in many ways, we wished that we could have had a friend like Takada back in our young days to be protected from the unnecessary malignment from fellow classmates who were just having fun bullying the weak. Takada may be the clueless kid, but he's a gigachad in the same apt way.\n\nThe bullies of both sexes: for the males, Kotarou Kitagawa, along with Katsunori Tanaka and Yuuya Yamamoto; and for the females, Sumire Kasahara, along with Junko Kurokawa and Megu Yanagieda. There is no doubt that in this moment of their lives, playing this bullying game is already akin to being immature, but they don't care, and Akane gets pretty much used to it for who she really is. As for the \"righteous\" side, Akane is pretty much used to them calling her names and the like, while Takada is just that unknowing character who is mysteriously doing her a lot of right by deflecting all of the negative points about Akane and turning them into the positives, leading her to blush and be embarrassed each and every time, thinking that he has an interest in her, but not in the romantic sense. Young kids just want to have fun, and only when they're faced with the romantic prospect does it get serious but awkward. And if this is the objective that both the show and its original source material want to point their audience to, I'm happy to say that they got it right the first time. Ironically, it's so fun to see Takada shoot down all of the negativity about Akane and make it plus points that add to her allure, that if one doesn't think about this in the romantic sense, then who are they?\n\nThe innocent people of Akane and Takada are not alone in this regard. Takada's best friend is Daichi Hino, who is all about unadulterated fun and tank-tops for the win. Initially, Akane's being spoilt by Takada's assertive whims, grows her character, and people slowly recognise her good side. Starting with Umi Adachi, she initially was the side character who didn't want to get involved in Akane's affair, but subsequently, her kind, nurtured behaviour won her over, and like a good friend (a la Takada style) she stands beside her as her very first common friend, outside of the transfer student. Umi has a crush on Hino, though he's only really into tank-tops, so better luck if you're going to win his heart somehow. It's the same for another recurring bully, though she can be a little hard to impress.\n\nWith the show having a rather unique appeal, there is no need for any kind of bombastic animation, just some good ol' decency to get both its production and pacing right, which is what Studio Signpost and its in-house director Shigenori Kageyama did to decency. I'm not going to lie; I like the unique character designs that were brought forth from the manga; they added more to the show's appeal than just being mere typical character lookalikes from just about any other show. It's childish but simplistic, which gives it an elementary school aspect. Simple, but it gets the job done.\n\nI quite like the music, actually, for a fluffy series such as this. Reina Kondou's OP was a surprise for me in the sense that it exudes everything about the manga's different aspects, from the chuunibyou of Akane's Grim Reaper to Takada just having fun combating and fooling around with friends. Kitri's 2nd ED (since Komi-san) is also a pleasant surprise for its simplicity, but it still has a pitch bend of sorts that I think contributed to the song. Overall, it's good.\n\nKids in love, is a subject that is rarely seen or explored in all of AniManga, because it's all about high school romances and the like, which I feel is going to be too much in the future. Rather than just a simple flashback of sorts (which this trope has been overused too much), make a story out of it, and that's what mangaka Taku Kawamura has done here, which makes the show an adorable, neat, and sweet watch that's actual lovestruck diabetes of innocent, puppy love.\n\nTry this show if you need or want the \"Feels Good\" meme.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nEnglish.\n\nAs sweet as this series is, it already gave me diabetes, we see romance in different ways, most of these tell us about a mature love, a love between two adult people and how they reflect it to others. Now here it is different, it is a love between children, do not think that it is something super strange, it is something very sweet, an innocent love where the boy does not realize his words, a love where innocence takes a very interesting role here.\n\nThe animation is very simple (the truth) but even so in that simplicity they show what is necessary for the story, ... I know that they do not focus to make it look more stylized because it does not need it, here they focus on the story, on the story between these two little people. In how they feel things for each other, directly or indirectly, like a kiss they don't know what it means to them but when they see one they feel something strange, how touching hands seems insignificant to them but For an adult person it is not like that, in truth with this series you will fall in love with its characters and what they do during this series.\n\nYou will not regret seeing it, highly recommended without a doubt.\n\nEspañol.\n\nDe tan dulce que es esta serie ya me dio diabetes, el romance lo vemos en diferentes formas la mayoría de estás nos relatan un amor maduro, un amor entre dos personas adultas y el como lo reflejan a los demás. Ahora aquí es diferente es una amor entre niños, no crean que es algo super extraño es algo muy dulce, un amor inocente en donde el chico no se da cuenta de sus palabras, un amor en donde la inocencia toma un rol bastante interesante aquí.\n\nLa animación es de lo mas sencillo (la verdad) pero aun así en esa sencillez muestran lo necesario para la historia, se que no se enfocan para que se vea algo mas estilizada porque no lo necesita, aquí se enfocan en la historia, en la historia entre estas dos pequeñas personas. En como ellas sienten cosas el uno por el otro, de manera directa o indirecta, el como un beso no saben lo que significa para ellos pero cuando ven uno se sienten algo extraño, el como tocarse las manos se les hace algo insignificante para ellos pero para una persona adulta no es así, en verdad con esta serie te enamoraras de sus personajes y lo que hacen en el transcurso de está.\n\nNo te arrepentirás de verla, super recomendada sin lugar a duda.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nThis anime is probably one of my favorite slice of life animes. The premise of the entire show was just so adorable, wholesome, and just beautiful.\n\nPlot: The plot is very simple, it’s about Nishimura, a young girl who is often bullied by her classmates because of her eyes that resemble the Grim Reaper. But her life is turned around when she meets Takada, a young boy who is very energetic and oblivious to things around him. Because of his energetic nature, he befriended Nishimura despite whatever his classmates tell about her.\n\nThis plot is very adorable and wholesome and is actually progressive, seeing throughout that Nishimura ... improves in her social skills, befriending Takada’s sister, Umi, Kasahara, and Hino as such.\n\nCharacters: Although the art seems very simplistic, it also fits the anime’s lighthearted nature. The character designs are decent, but what I like the most are their personalities (excluding Kitagawa’s). Nishimura from a very introverted person to a now much happier girl thanks to Takada’s sunny personality that helps her get out of her shell. I love their dynamic because you can really see that Takada is very outspoken in how he thinks of Nishimura, completely ignoring his classmates’ opinions of Nishimura.\n\nTheir crushes on one another is also very endearing, but the scene that really took the cake was the scene he found out about Nishimura’s deceased mother. I love how considerate he was of her feelings, feeling extremely bad for calling her the Grim Reaper (albeit in a loving manner) since it seemed “related” to the fact that Nishimura’s died because of her through difficult childbirth (or maybe some other reason, since it was unsaid). I loved how he cried and apologized and they just held hands on the way home, taking longer routes to stay together longer to comfort Takada. That episode really struck me.\n\nAnother character that I love is Nishimura’s father who’s very supportive and loving towards Nishimura, marinating eggs for her so that she could strike conversations with friends easily, accompanying her in buying a swimsuit, and also crying with joy when she sent him a photo of her and her friends eating lunch together. I love how his love is displayed very well even if those scenes were very brief.\n\nI also love Kasahara’s character development, starting out as one of the major bullies to now being Nishimura’s good friend. Initially, I was very annoyed with how she would keep bullying Nishimura, but then again, they’re children but that also isn’t an excuse to bully someone. However, during the school festival, I love how she was patient in hearing out Nishimura’s plea for her to represent their class and for her to run since Nishimura couldn’t run as fast she could. This scene really showed that Nishimura knew her limits and was willing to ask others to help her despite her want to be with Takada during the relay race. From there, Kasahara started warming up to Nishimura to the point she stopped herself from bullying her, deciding to stay silent instead.\n\nEdit: I love that scene where Nishimura and Takada witnessed Kasumi-neechan's kiss with her crush, like that awoke something between the two of them and it made the relationship even cuter. I love how Takada wanted to kiss Nishimura, but she held him off by telling it to give his first someone he really loved but then he said that he wanted it to be her. LIKE AYO THEY ARE SO ADORABLE AGHHHH\n\nAnimation: The animation is also good, not as high as Mappa or StudioWit, but it’s good enough.\n\nOST: The music is also good enough.\n\nOverall score: It’s a 9/10 for me! I highly recommend this anime if you want your dose of serotonin and wholesomeness!\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nIt's a fine show but without much really going on, every episode and gag tends to be the same thing over and over. Taiyou says something that sounds romantically suggestive and Nishimura goes tomato faced. While it's cute at first it really starts to drag after seeing it happening again and again without much variety in the situations.\n\nSometimes other characters are there to spice up things but again, it's always the same thing. Bully comes and tries to demean Nishimura, Taiyou misunderstands cause' he's a chunni. The only character who seems to have no ill intentions towards Taiyou or Nishimura is Hino whose only gag ... is that he likes sport and tank tops.\n\nIt's light hearted but not very funny. It's a nice bit of sweetnes for a dark day but if you try to watch multiple episodes at once you'll get a sugar overdose.\n\nBut in the end it's still neat if you really like slice of life with an innocent romance theme. I'd say check out the first two episodes at least if that's something you typically enjoy.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 5\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nMy Clueless First Friend is the story of what would happen if a new student became super attached to the friendless kid in the class, and was completely oblivious towards the situation. Taiyou almost immediately imprints on Nishimura like a puppy due to his chuuni tendencies, and an unbreakable bond is formed. While a lot of this anime is variations of this scenario, as the series goes on we see Nishimura-san become more confident and win more people over. There's Also a form of the \"will they won't they\" dynamic between the two main characters that isn't really resolved here, but could be further explored ... in a subsequent season.\n\nThe animation probably won't blow you away, but this is a very simple slice of life show where over the top animation isn't really needed. It feels like the team behind the show was aware of this, and opted instead to save the budget of animation for the opening and ending sequences. They feel very symbolic of Nishimura being lonely and \"lost\" before finding friendship with the ray of sunshine that is Taiyou, and thus they tend to deviate from the typical reality and logic of the show in a sense. The music feels kind of somber, with occasional pop of energy to it, which in itself is reminiscent of Nishimura and Taiyou's dynamic.\n\nThe side characters, aside from most of the bullies who stay relatively one note, were also interesting in their own right. Hino-Kun was hilarious, Adachi-San was super sweet, and it really tugged on my heartstrings when Nishimura's dad explained how much he cared for his daughter even if he could only help her \"behind the scenes\" and not follow her to school. But what really shines about this show is how hopeful it is. If you've ever been the \"weird kid\" or are even an outsider of sorts in your daily life, this anime will make you believe that the right people are out there, waiting to be found. Even if it's not completely realistic, it gives us something to strive for. If the Nishimuras of the world can find love and acceptance even after years of being misunderstood, then surely our world can be a better place.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nI don't f#cking know what kind of sugar and magic they used to make this series. Is probably one of the cutest things I've seen in my life... I always get impressed at how \"repetitive\" the formule can get but at the same time it doesn't bother me at all???? It usually starts to get boring after some time but not with this anime for some reason and I find it amazing-\n\nThe premise kinda reminds me of Kimi ni todoke but much more wholesome (in my opinion).\n\nProbably became one of my favorite pieces of media, kinda sad it went under the radar this season ... even though, to me, it was the best thing coming out this spring, I'll miss watching my weekly dose of diabetes so much... My Sundays will be so empty now...\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nA funny and feel-good anime about a very obliviously optimistic boy who is overly fascinated by the quiet girl in class.\n\nShe is labeled the Grim Reaper by the other students at school.\n\nHowever the new transfer student Taiyou Takada thinks she’s the coolest and cutest girl ever.\n\nTaiyou’s overly positive attitude towards the Grim Reaper (Akane Nishimura) leads her to be seen in a more positive light by others.\n\nShe goes from not having any friends to making a new one episode by episode.

And it's true. It's me, I am the tired adult woman watching this show to absorb its innocent charm as I recover from daily life.\n\nMy Clueless First Friend is simple: Takada loves Nishimura; excitedly, wholly, and enthusiastically. He loves her so much that he absolutely cannot process anything less than perfection about her, so any bullying, self doubt, or otherwise negative thoughts are turned on their head into positives. And this is good, ... albeit unusual for Nishimura, a meek bullied girl who's used to being ostracized as the Grim Reaper. Luckily Takada is also a young boy obsessed with \"cool\" things with dark powers, so the grim reaper moniker only adds to his obsession.\n\nAnd that's the formula. People are mean to Nishimura, Takada turns their comments into compliments. Nishimura is used to being alone, Takada follows her everywhere and has the best time. Any doubts or insecurities are repeatedly confronted and destroyed until Nishimura is forced to begin thinking of herself at least somewhat beyond her usual self loathing. It's simple and a bit repetitive, but it's very charming and because of that it never got old. Maybe eventually it would if it ran longer, but at 13 episodes we had plenty of fun situation writing and evolving cast to keep it fresh and engaging.\n\nI can see where this might be dull to some people. It definitely isn't particularly deep or difficult of a watch. But while the cerebral and high concept shows have a place, the older I get the more I also value the simple, sweet, and happy ideas too. Truly after a long week of being worn down by the world, I loved to watch Takada shower Nishimura in affection as the warmth helps rejuvenate and energize me. Even if other weekly shows stumbled, I could use My Clueless First Friend as a palette cleanser to feel good again. It's a simple show with clumsy and unambitious art, but the designs that could be called weak in other shows actually work with the laid back vibes of this show. Overall its just an enjoyable time, a soft hug of a show that came once a week to cheer me up. While it never could've lasted forever without losing some of its charm, I will definitely miss having it going forward. Quiet + outgoing odd couples will always be a common trope, but few are as wholesome and uncomplicated as watching these two children navigate their first time caring deeply for one another and learning how to support and grow together.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nIf I am to describe this anime in one word, it would be \"wholesome\". As written the synopsis, the MC Nishimura Akane is perceived as gloomy by classmates. Throughout the anime they tease her constantly because of this, making Akane’s life somewhat miserable. The transfer student, Takada Taiyou, changed this and basically brought light to her life and school life.\n\nThe story is quite simplistic and is meant for a younger audience, which makes sense as it is set in an elementary school and the daily life in said school. It’s not meant to be deep but does reflect, to some extent, how children in real ... life would feel if they were placed in that situation. I find it to be a great comfy anime that makes me smile even if it is a little bit repetitive. You could say that the repetitive formula used in each episode makes this anime boring, but I think watching this after a long day in a busy life is perfect to cheer you up. The repetitive-ness of the episodes is by design, and I think it can get away with that because of its intended target audience. If after three episodes if you think that the anime is slow and tedious, then you should probably watch something else; the rest of the episodes would look and feel similar.\n\nThe art, voice acting, OST, OP, and ED fits the anime well. It reflects the atmosphere and mood well and complements the anime.\n\nOverall, for a comfy, relaxing look into the life of elementary school students/kids, look no further then Jijou wo Shiranai Tenkousei ga Guigui Kuru.\n\nScoring breakdown using old MAL categories:\n\n* Overall & Enjoyment: 8/10\n\n* Sound: 8/10\n\n* Art: 8/10 [Reasoning: Clean character art style and background art]\n\n* Story: 6/10 [Reasoning: Repetitive and lack thereof]\n\n* Character: 7/10 [Reasoning: Simplistic personalities but good for intended audience]\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nThis Anime portrays a great picture of How having a friend that that'll outshine the darkness around you can help/or save a person that's being subjected to bullying. As you watch the anime you are introduced to Nishimura who's labeled as the Grim Reaper, who due to her appearance and how her vibe appears to the public is experiencing a form of bullying. Another character you are introduced to is Takada, Taiyou (which literally means the sun) is a blessing to Nishimura as he pulled her out from the dark pit of bullying, his existence as her friend enabled her to see life differently, to ... see the \"Grim Reaper\" label as a form of bond that connects her to a friend. Takada, helped Nishimura big time because he is a straightforward person and being the \"Clueless\" friend seeing any form of insult as a form of praise towards Nishimura. The show portrays a great picture of Friendship in life that ultimately saves a person in many ways. In addition, the show is a great slice of life anime that is coated in a more appealing way to divert any form of negativity. Ultimately a great show glad I watched it!\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nIf I could describe the main character in one sentence it would be this \"Social Anxiety is scared of this guy\"\n\nTaiyou the new kid is probably the most extroverted person in all of anime. Never before have I ever seen somebody speak their mind, not care about what others think or not let a single word effect them like Taiyou\n\nMy Clueless First Friend is a really sweet story about an extrovert finding an introvert and becoming friends with them despite the fact they're disliked by the entire school for \"being the grim reaper\" due to having weird looking eyes. Despite the outcast, nasty things being ... said and mistreatment Akane gets from her pears on a daily basis. Taiyou Takana still thinks the world of her and with literally no hesitation becomes friends with her and thinks she's the \"cutest and coolest person ever\"\n\nI really like these stories about rooting for the underdog and wanting them to have a happy life and My Clueless First Friend does that in a really nice way. I do think they could tone Taiyou down a little bit and have the same effect on the story as sometimes he does come off as a little too excited which can get a little much. I was willing to drop it on episode 1 but I try not to drop animes until bare minimum episode 6 (unless it's terrible) - I'm glad I stuck with it though because I finished it in 1 sitting\n\nI also really like that some of the kids came around on Akane and realized she's not actually scary.\n\n9/10\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nUsually when a show revolves around a single gag or concept , it can get repetitive, but this show does it's gag in so many ways and it's so good every time that I could go for at least a few more seasons of it. Taiyou is essentially a relentlessly optimistic and vibrant personality, to the point that he's a bit detached from reality. Any time someone tries to bully him he misinterprets it in a wholesome way which ends up making a somewhat shy, seemingly-gloomy girl come out of her shell just a bit. It's like reverse-cringe comedy where an awkward scenario becomes positive ... and it's great every time.\n\nEvery single episode is a joy and all of Taiyou's weird misinterpretations are hilarious but also wholesome. While the show does revolve around the central trio and their cadre of bullies, there is a nice cast of side characters who all bring their own seasoning to the dynamics without becoming played out.\n\nVisually the show is fine, the characters and animation do get a bit off-model at times but it accomplishes what it needs to and the designs are very cute. The animation doesn't do anything fancy like D.I.Y did and I wouldn't really say there are any sakuga moments, but it doesn't really need them. The writing and scenarios are what makes this strong and I certainly want more of these characteres.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nA very positive anime which is simple and realistic in it's progress. I found it was uniquely graceful in showing healing from loneliness, and building a friend circle. For how lighthearted the mood is, the plot is grounded and the audio-visual presentation is remarkably consistent and clear. As I whole I think it's impressive, but each moment is quite standard. It has a soothing quality.\n\nThe characters are children, and the story is about dealing with malicious intentions from bullies, and discovering ways to be friends. The main character is a subdued and thoughtful girl who has been affected by her mother's passing. She is paired ... with a outgoing and idealistic boy who is honest and reasonable. The classmates are a good representation for societal forces which are out of your control, but you could work with that.\n\nThe sub sounds cute, and dub is naturally written and voice acted, which is good.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nThis is a school life themed anime. The premise is quite simple, we have a girl named Akane who is always made fun of by her classmates. Due to how often they tease her, she stopped caring and just went with the flow. Then we have a chad Taiyou who uses the same things the classmates say to praise her. This praise, however, gets her flustered as she's used to the bullying but not to praise. This unique interaction causes the other classmates to back off from this chad and his new friend.\n\nThe anime is very fun to watch and I recommend it if you ... want a feel-good anime. And I love how positive and chad-like Taiyou is. But at the same time, the anime is simple so if you want plot, you might not enjoy it much.\n\nThanks for reading my review and God bless.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nHey folks, this will be my review for Jijou wo Shiranai Tenkousei ga Guigui Kuru. It's so darn sweet and adorable that you will need to visit the dentist afterwords.\n\nThe show is simple. A girl named Akane gets bullied by the kids in her school. They call her the grim reaper, and constantly pick on her for even the dumbest stuff. However one day a transfer student named Taiyou shows up and befriends her and turns that moniker into a positive thing. Taiyou is a lovable idiot, and he seems to think that all the grim reaper stuff is true, but instead of shunning ... Akane he tries to get closer to her to get more of her power. His stupidity is offset by his honesty and forthrightness. So a typical episode will be the other kids saying something mean, Taiyou comes in to turn it into something positive, and then Akane being embarrassed by the ridiculousness of what he said.\n\nHonestly not much needs to be said. This is a little slice of life show about elementary school kids. The romance is an undertone that we can see, and that Akane has to wonder at, but since they are so young it's really just a show about kids being cute. If you don't like slice of life anime this probably wont be for you. I loved the show, but I can also admit that the show might have been a bit longer than necessary. A setup like this would have been awesome for shorts, though I am glad they had full episodes. Most of the humor is distributed through how ridiculously complimentary Taiyou is, and I can see how someone might get bored of it before they finish. I think my only other criticism would be that they didn't end with a quick scene where Akane and Taiyou are entering or leaving high school and holding hands. I cant imagine this show getting a second season, something like that would have been a nice way to end it. Especially when they named the last episode ten years later, bastards. Give it a go if your alright with slice of life shows, or if you need a palette cleanser between something serious.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nUnrealistic. Formulaic. Mundane. On-the-nose. But absolutely precious.\n\nIf you aren't developmentally stunted, watching SoL anime about kids (and probably for kids) becomes an entirely different experience from your twenties and onwards. A lot of anime is, unfortunately, teenage-boy-fantasy-projection garbage which I cannot fathom at all, certainly not anymore. Instead this is a kind of vicarious parental fantasy for me. I'm looking at these children interact in wholesome ways and it makes me want to root for them. I rejoice when they conquer these caricaturized childhood melodramas we are familiar with, because when we were children these melodramas were anything but 'melo'.\n\nSome people tend to ... focus too much on whether a story is realistic or has realistic characters. I was one of those people at some point, but one must be able to recognize the value of simplification, caricatures, pastiches and the like. It must be emphasized that the characters and scenes in this anime are anything but realistic but have intrinsic value as caricatures because it makes them more easily relatable. Give this series a try, but only if you can get over the blatant lack of realism.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 6\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all"
