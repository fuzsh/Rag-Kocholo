        "text": "Gui Gui (also known as Emma Wu) has just debuted on South Korean stages with her new stage name GEMMA!\n\nVirtually married to 2PM‘s Taecyeon on MBC‘s We Got Married Global in 2013, GEMMA released her solo debut track “SUGAR RUSH” on September 27th, 2016 with Korean and Chinese versions of the song. Her Chinese music video even easily reached one million views in a day, reflecting her popularity.\n\nGEMMA was included in the line-up of performing artists for this week’s MBC Show Champion and Mnet M! Countdown. Originally a member of Taiwanese girl group Hey Girl, Gui Gui has proven her ten years of performing experience with her stage presence. Although she expressed that she was nervous, she was definitely not a rookie on stage.\n\nThe 27-year-old singer also managed to reunite with Taecyeon at M! Countdown‘s backstage after three years, while also meeting the other 2PM members, GOT7‘s Jackson, and Apink.\n\nCheck out the official music video and performance for “SUGAR RUSH” below!"
