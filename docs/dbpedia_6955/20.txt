Looks like they are doing a series of Pearl Earrings dramas. Gui Gui will be in the first one that we have come to known as The Girl with Tassel Earrings alongside actor Dai Xiang Yu. Our leads meet when they work together to start and expand radio station at their school, but due to a misunderstanding, he steals her family heirloom – a pair of tassel earrings. To get them back, she slowly wins over his heart with her Intelligence and kindness (aka by surviving the mental and physical torture he dishes out….sounds familiar?)

Apparently, all my girlcrushes like to be tortured onscreen. *shrugs*

While it is not what I would watch, I might tune in for the cute. No time to watch her suffer.

Written by Yan Zi and directed by Zheng Jun and Yan Guang Xing, The Girl with Tassel Earrings has 40 episodes and plans for a premiere in late 2015 or early 2016.
