At 34, Taiwanese celeb Emma Wu, aka Gui Gui, is already considered a showbiz veteran, having been in the industry for nearly two decades.

She made her first on-screen appearance in 2005 on variety show Blackie’s Teenage Club, before debuting as a singer with girl group Hey Girl aka Hei Se Hui Mei Mei (黑澀會美眉).

She became the first Taiwanese artiste to perform in Korea, and went on to star in dramas and variety shows, including Let’s Open and Hi! Come In.

Gui Gui is also a successful entrepreneur. She launched fashion label GhostEmma in 2013, and in 2022, started gemmaselect, on which she hawks fashion products via Instagram live stream.

With all that hustle, it’s no surprise that Gui Gui has been raking in the big bucks. In fact, according to media reports, she owns four properties in Taiwan.

In a recent interview, she revealed that she plans to invest in another property, and sets her sights on achieving her goal next year.

Lest you think she rents out most of her properties, they are all for her own use.

Gui Gui reportedly lives in two of them, while the rest are for her family.

Her most recent purchase, a 45 sqm house in Taipei's Songshan district, is said to have cost around NT$40mil (S$1.68mil).

She pays a total monthly mortgage of over NT$200K (S$8K) for all her properties, and despite having to service them over the next 30 years, she considers them worthwhile investments.

Gui Gui revealed that she has a very simple strategy when it comes to managing her finances. She allocates a portion of her earnings to savings and an endowment plan, and invests the rest in property.

She said the financial strain from her mortgages motivates her to earn more money.

According to Gui Gui, she used to spend the bulk of her monthly paycheck without giving much thought to saving.

It was only at her mother’s advice that she decided to invest her earnings.
