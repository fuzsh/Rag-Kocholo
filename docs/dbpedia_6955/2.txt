After contemplating the offer, 2PM’s Taecyeon finally decided that he is onboard with MBC’s We Got Married.

On February 1, MBC announced that Taecyeon and Taiwanese star Gui Gui (Even Wu) will be married on the Global Version of We Got Married.

The Global Version of the show will have the virtual newlywed couple learning about each other’s diverse cultures and language. Taceyeon and Gui Gui are the first couple to be confirmed for the new edition of the show.

Gui Gui, born in 1989, is a multitalented star in Taiwan, who started off in the entertainment industry as a member of the girl group, Hey You. She later left the group and became an actress. She’s known as a K-Pop fan of Lee Hyori, Super Junior’s Leeteuk, and Big Bang.

On February 1, Gui Gui posted a picture of a plane ticket, announcing her visit to Korea, perhaps to start filming for the show.

The new couple′s adventures are scheduled to be air in 41 different countries. The broadcast dates in Korea have yet to be announced.
