GuiGui originates from the girl group "Hei Se Hui Mei Mei", which later changed its name to "Hey Girl". Hey Girl consisted of seven other girls, and often collaborate with the popular Taiwanese boy band, Lollipop. GuiGui has also successfully completed filming "Mysterious Incredible Terminator (Pi Li MIT)" with Aaron Yan. After Mysterious Incredible Terminator, GuiGui and co-star Aaron have signed a contract to film another drama, Tao Hua Ai Wu Di, based on Japan's best selling manga "Momoka Typhoon". Filming for this drama had begun but was canceled due to promotions of Fahrenheit's new album. It was also declared that GuiGui was busy with her own contract affairs, and would be replaced by Cyndi Wang; Aaron Yan was assigned another drama, Love Buffet, and will be replaced by his bandmate Jiro Wang. Before "Hey Girl", GuiGui and her fellow bandmates were split into two groups(Pink and Cutie) for their third EP release with each groups having to attain a goal, as well as battling for highest records sales. GuiGui then left Channel V to pursue a solo career.

GuiGui left the management of Channel V, where the discovery of Mei Meis occurred, Andy Ge has admitted to press that she is unlikely to renew her contract, and with an ambiguous post on her own blog, GuiGui had admitted to the news. Andy Ge clarifies that Hey Girl is not under Channel V management, so GuiGui is still with Hey Girl and will be attending promotions per usual. However, the Hey Girl promotion following his statement did not include GuiGui, who was said to be busy with MIT promotion before and during their promotion, and Xiao Man. On the May 6, 2009, Andy Ge announced to the press that GuiGui will not be renewing her contract with Channel V, and that her involvement with Hey Girl will have to be clarified with Warner Music, as Hey Girl do not belong to Channel V.

love GuiGui! shis so CUTE!!! and the way she communicate with Tac its even cuter! I only get to know her since she entered WGM,but I have a feeling I'm going to love, and follow her with or with out Taecyeon...she looks interesting.and of course I'm a fan of 2PM and LOVE Taecyeon!!!he is my favorite in this band !and I LOVE them togethe as a couple...With each and every episode that comes up, I love them more and more!And I know that others will like them in the future!!!too bad they'll have only 15 episodes...T^T way not 50? or more...

I started watching WGM again since I like Gui gui before (I really love Gui gui and Wang Zi before and I thought there would be no other better pair for Gui gui) but I was so wrong!!

And of course, I love Taec yeon oppa and (Bae Suzy. I didn't push through watching Dream High since I want them to be end up together which I saw in a spoiler that didn't not push through. Hahaha)

And now, WAAAAAAAAAAAH!!! I'm getting addicted with the TaecGui couple. There's no boring episode for them. The serious and tough man Taec Yeon and the super charming Gui gui really compensates with each other! They're just so funny and can bring the best out of them!

Let's make this thread active! And oh, 15 episodes only?!! SRLY? Can't they just extend it? :/
