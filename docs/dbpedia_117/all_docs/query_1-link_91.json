The skills you gain are useful for a wide range of financial data analysis and in a range of other sectors where data analysis is required, for example sociology, health science, medical science or biology. This experience is also an ideal foundation for further academic study; many of our students choose to progress to PhD.\n\nOur Statistics and Probability Group has a thriving research culture. Our group works with mainstream statistics to develop new methodology and apply it to real-world problems. The team produces world-class research, publishing in top journals.

They will test your subject knowledge and analytical, theoretical skills as well as the practical aspects of application, implementation and interpretation.\n\nDeveloping and delivering digital presentations will enhance your communication skills for a range of audiences, from the general public to subject experts.\n\nThe independent study module relies on your own research, so you'll continue to develop your critical reasoning and digital literacy skills, including programming.
