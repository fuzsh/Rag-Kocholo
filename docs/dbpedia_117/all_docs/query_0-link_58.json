With a strong computational background highlighting statistics and probability, students in this track will be competitive candidates in any corporate or commercial based career within the finance, investment, real estate, or banking industry. In addition to the College of Arts and Sciences General Education requirements, students in the financial math track will complete the following course work comprised of core classes and electives. In the financial math track, electives have been previously defined by faculty in order to highlight the financial aspect of the major and to prepare students for careers/internships within this field of interest.\n\nStudents may review the requirements and sample schedule for the Math Financial Track on the Math Financial Track Requirements and Sample Schedule [pdf] handout."
