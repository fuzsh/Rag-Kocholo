        "text": "Are you fascinated by the seemingly random movement of stock prices? Have you ever wondered if such movements could be modelled and simulated? Would a mathematical model allow us to make conclusions about the risk of trading strategies? If you are intrigued by such questions, one of our programs in Mathematics and Finance is the right choice for you. Our programs provide you with the background in mathematics and finance needed to study these questions. Since this is an interdisciplinary area whose understanding requires a broad education, the programs also include courses from statistics, economics, accounting, and operations management.\n\nCareers for Financial Mathematicians\n\nA degree in Mathematics and Finance provides a solid foundation for careers in the financial industry and graduate studies in financial engineering and mathematical finance. Graduates of our program can apply mathematical and statistical techniques to analyze financial products and manage financial risk. They find employment in all areas where quantitative skills combined with financial understanding are required, for example at banks and investment firms in areas such as development of trading strategies, portfolio analysis, and risk management.\n\nGraduates of our program also are well positioned to:\n\nearn the Chartered Financial Analyst® (CFA) designation,\n\npursue diverse opportunities in quantitative finance,\n\nbecome accredited as a professional actuary,\n\nor to acquire professional certification in risk management.\n\nMore information on these certifications can be found below.\n\nDegree Options in Mathematics and Finance\n\nStudents can enter one of our programs in Mathematics and Finance in their second or third year. These are quota programs, meaning that only a limited number of students can be registered in these programs, and, therefore, admission is competitive.\n\nHonors in Mathematics and Finance:\n\nDownload the program planner for this degree program\n\nMajor in Mathematics and Finance:\n\nDownload the program planner for this degree program\n\nThis program was previously offered as Specialization in Mathematics and Finance. Students in the Specialization in Mathematics and Finance can finish their programs, but we do not admit new students into the Specialization program. Instead, students shall consider the Major in Mathematics and Finance.\n\nChartered Financial Analyst® (CFA)\n\nChartered Financial Analyst® (CFA) is a credential for finance and investment professionals offered by the CFA Institute. The CFA® is a globally recognized standard for competence and integrity of financial analysts.\n\nTo become a CFA® charterholder, a candidate must pass three CFA® Program exams and have four years of qualified investment work experience. You may write the first exam as early as your final year of your Bachelor's degree.\n\nThe following University of Alberta courses are useful for exam preparation:\n\nTopic\n\nUniversity of Alberta Courses\n\nTheory of interest MATH 253 Quantitative analysis STAT 265, ECON 399 or STAT 378 Economics ECON 281, 282 Mathematical finance MATH 356, 357 Accounting ACCTG 211/311, 312/412 Finance FIN 201/301, 312/412, 413, 418\n\nFor further details, visit the CFA® Program pages of the CFA Institute.\n\nThere is an annual CFA® Night at the University of Alberta, where charterholders speak about the CFA® program and their careers. For more information on this event, see the Facebook page of the Business Finance Association, which hosts this event.\n\nPartnership with the CQF Institute\n\nThe University of Alberta is an academic partner of the CQF (Certificate in Quantitative Finance) Institute. Our students can register as free members and have the opportunity to access the latest CQF Institute membership resources, including events, career tools, workshops, and thought leadership content. Students enrolled in our Mathematics and Finance programs will receive once per year (typically in September) news on the CQF Institute with the option to sign up. For more information, please contact Chris Frei.\n\nActuarial Science\n\nActuarial science is about assessing risk, mainly used in the insurance industry. While we do not offer a degree program in actuarial science, a good preparation in actuarial science can be achieved through one of our Mathematics and Finance programs or our Honors Statistics program.\n\nActuaries are accredited by the Society of Actuaries. The first level of accreditation is the Associate of the Society of Actuaries (ASA), which includes passing five actuarial exam modules and obtaining validation of educational experience (VEE) in three areas.\n\nIt is possible for students to take some of the exam modules while completing their degree. The following courses at the University of Alberta are helpful in preparing for the exam modules:\n\nExam Module\n\nUniversity of Alberta Courses\n\nProbability STAT 265, 266 Financial Mathematics MATH 253, FIN 201/301 Investment and Financial Markets MATH 356, 357, FIN 201/301 Long-Term Actuarial Mathematics STAT 353, 432, and a significant portion of topics through self-study Short-Term Actuarial Mathematics STAT 453, and a significant portion of topics through self-study Statistics for Risk Modeling STAT 378, 479, and a significant portion of topics through self-study Predictive Analytics MGTSC 405, and a significant portion of topics through self-study\n\nVEE qualifications can be achieved by obtaining a minimum of a grade of B- in specific courses, as follows:\n\nVEE Area\n\nUniversity of Alberta Courses\n\nEconomics ECON 101 (or 281) and ECON 102 (or 282) Accounting and Finance ACCTG 211/311 (200/300 or 501) and FIN 201/301 (or 501) Mathematical Statistics STAT 266 and STAT 372\n\nFor more information on the requirements to obtain the Associate of the Society of Actuaries (ASA) designation, visit the ASA pages of the Society of Actuaries website.\n\nFor more information about the actuarial profession in general, visit the Be an Actuary website.\n\nProfessional Certifications in Risk Management\n\nThere are several international professional certifications in risk management:\n\nEnergy Risk Professional (ERP), offered by the Global Association of Risk Professionals\n\nFinancial Risk Manager (FRM), offered by the Global Association of Risk Professionals\n\nProfessional Risk Manager (PRM), offered by the Professional Risk Managers' International Association\n\nThe Energy Risk Professional (ERP) certification is for professionals with careers in the oil, coal, natural gas, and alternative energy industries to manage risk in a real-world energy environment.\n\nThe Financial Risk Manager (FRM) and Professional Risk Manager (PRM) certifications are for professionals with careers in financial risk management. Compared to the Certified Financial Analyst® (CFA) designation, these certifications are focused more on financial risk management and less on other topics, and therefore are intended specifically for careers in financial risk management.\n\nFor more information on these certifications, visit the Global Associate of Risk Professionals (GARP) website and the Professional Risk Managers' International Association (PRMIA) website."
