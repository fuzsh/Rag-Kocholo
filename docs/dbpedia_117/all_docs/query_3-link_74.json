Our faculty have designed your learning experience to fit the subject being studied, with a variety of teaching and assessment styles.\n\nYour teaching will take the form of lectures, webinars, and computer lab sessions, supported, where relevant, by guest speakers from industry to balance theory and practice. Lectures introduce key theories, concepts, and economic models. In classes you will solve financial problems and numerical exercises, analyse case studies, and make presentations of research published in academic journals.\n\nModules are taught by staff from WBS, Warwick's Department of Statistics, and the Mathematics Institute through a combination of lectures, classes, and computer lab sessions. A one-week induction module will ensure you have the mathematical and statistical prerequisites for the course.\n\nYour learning will be assessed by a mix of exams, group work, project work, and tests. Group and project work will enable you to collaborate and gain new perspectives from your international cohort, preparing you for working in teams within a global work environment.\n\nLab work will give you hands-on experience of using software to perform finance-related calculations, conduct realistic simulations and write code."
