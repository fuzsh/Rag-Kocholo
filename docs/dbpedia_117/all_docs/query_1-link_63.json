        "text": "In total, the Financial Mathematics degree requires the successful completion of 1250 units. A full-quarter course is 100 units, with courses that take place in the first-half or second-half of the quarter being 50 units.\n\nFoundations Courses - 350 units\n\nElective Courses - 900 units\n\nStudents can further specialize their MSFM degree by earning Degree Concentrations.\n\nThe Financial Mathematics program allows students to study at the intersection of mathematics, statistics, finance, economics, and computer science. Within our curriculum, courses are organized by quarter, with the fall quarter focusing on the mathematical foundations of the subject and an introduction to financial markets. The winter and spring quarters focus on topics such as statistical risk management, regression analysis, portfolio theory, and applications of the mathematical theory of option pricing, as well as fixed income and foreign exchange derivatives. In the Summer Quarter, students can opt to receive practical training through Project Lab or an internship. The final fall quarter rounds off the degree with a variety of elective courses. Because the concepts introduced build upon each other, part-time students should expect to take more foundational courses first, followed by the more advanced and applied courses.\n\nStudents who matriculated prior to Autumn 2023 may review their Graduation Requirements at one of the links below:\n\n2022 - 2023 Graduation Requirements\n\n2021 - 2022 Graduation Requirements\n\n2020 - 2021 Graduation Requirements\n\n2019 - 2020 Graduation Requirements\n\n2018 - 2019 Graduation Requirements\n\n2017 - 2018 Graduation Requirements\n\n2016 - 2017 Graduation Requirements\n\nGraduation Requirements are based on the year of matriculation."
