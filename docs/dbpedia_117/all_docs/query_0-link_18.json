        "text": "Background\n\nThe Mathematical and Computational Finance Program at Stanford University (“MCF”) is one of the oldest and most established programs of its kind in the world. Starting out in the late 1990’s as an interdisciplinary financial mathematics research group, at a time when “quants” started having a greater impact on finance in particular, the program formally admitted masters students starting in 1999. The current MCF program was relaunched under the auspices of the Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering in the Stanford School of Engineering in 2014 to better align with changes in industry and to broaden into areas of financial technology in particular. We are excited to remain at the cutting edge of innovation in finance while carrying on our long tradition of excellence.\n\nMission\n\nThe MCF Program is designed to have smaller cohorts of exceptional students with diverse interests and viewpoints, and prepare them for impactful roles in finance. We are characterized by our cutting edge curriculum marrying traditional financial mathematics and core fundamentals, with an innovative technical spirit unique to Stanford with preparation in software engineering, data science and machine learning as well as the hands-on practical coursework which is the hallmark skill-set for leaders in present day finance."
