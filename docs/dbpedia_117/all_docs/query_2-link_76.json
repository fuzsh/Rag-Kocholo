        "text": "Academic Year 2024 – 2025\n\nGeneral Information\n\nAddress\n\nBendheim Center for Finance, Julis Romo Rabinowitz Building\n\nPhone\n\nProgram Offerings:\n\nM.Fin.\n\nDepartment for program:\n\nDirector of Graduate Studies:\n\nGraduate Program Administrator:\n\nOverview\n\nThe interdisciplinary Bendheim Center for Finance offers a Master in Finance (M.Fin.) degree. The distinctive feature of Princeton’s M.Fin. program is its strong emphasis on ﬁnancial and monetary economics, relying on analytical and computational methods. Graduates of this program will come away with fundamental quantitative tools of economic theory, probability, statistics, optimization, computer science, and machine learning. To a greater degree than at any time in the past, there now exists a body of knowledge that is essential for the proper analysis and management of ﬁnancial securities, portfolios, and the ﬁnancial decisions of the ﬁrms. A driving force behind these developments is a lively exchange of ideas between academia and the ﬁnancial industry, a collaboration that is the closest parallel in the social sciences to the academic-private sector interactions routinely seen in engineering and the applied sciences.\n\nThe M.Fin. program is intended to prepare students for a wide range of careers both inside and outside the ﬁnancial industry, including ﬁnancial engineering and risk management, quantitative asset management, macroeconomic and ﬁnancial forecasting, quantitative trading, and applied research.\n\nThe program does not require prior work experience. At a minimum, we expect applicants to have completed one or more internships (for instance over the summer while in college). The Bendheim Center provides comprehensive career assistance to students, including personalized on-campus recruiting with our corporate partners.\n\nOur Manager of Career Development also works with students on an individual and group basis to provide support with interview preparation, internships, and job placement.\n\nThe curriculum is designed to be completed in four semesters. Admission letters will specify the expected program length. The program is designed to be taken on a full-time basis. Classes are taught during the day, and students take four or five courses per semester. All students are subject to an annual review of academic progress.\n\nPrinceton’s M.Fin. program draws upon the combined strength of a variety of departments, including the Departments of Computer Science, Economics, Operations Research and Financial Engineering, The Center for Statistics and Machine Learning, and others. Over the last several years, the program has expanded to include new courses in machine learning, fintech, data science, and entrepreneurship, to name a few.\n\nThe program has two major course components and a required summer internship between years one and two. First, there are required core courses in mathematical finance, economics, probability, statistics, and financial econometrics; all necessary for the study of finance at a sophisticated level and an integrated introduction to modern financial analysis, and second, an integrated introduction to modern financial analysis. Students can choose from a wide range of elective courses, drawn from many departments, to tailor the program to fit their own needs and interests. These courses permit a range of opportunities for specialization and in-depth study of topics of interest, along several coherent tracks. Finally, the required summer internship is meant to provide additional practical experience in addressing real-world finance issues.\n\nStudents can choose from three program tracks based on their interests and goals: (1) Quantitative Asset Management - Designing and evaluating financial products that help organizations manage risk-return trade-offs; (2) Data Science & Financial Technologies - Computer-based technologies and their increasingly important use of big data in finance; (3) Valuation & Macroeconomic Analysis - Strategic understanding of firm’s valuation and structural macroeconomic conditions, though it is not required.\n\nStudents completing the program in two years will have the opportunity to obtain the Graduate Certificate from the Center for Statistical and Machine Learning (CSML). Students who earn this certificate will have it appear on the transcript at graduation.\n\nApply\n\nApplication deadline\n\nDecember 15, 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (This deadline is for applications for enrollment beginning in fall 2024)\n\nProgram length\n\n2 years\n\nFee\n\n$75\n\nGRE\n\nGeneral Test (or GMAT) - optional/not required\n\nAdditional departmental requirements\n\nThree letters of recommendation are required, however, one may be from a current or former employer.\n\nAll applicants will be required to take a math assessment test. The test will take place on the first Saturday after the application deadline. Detailed information regarding the test will be forthcoming.\n\nProgram Offerings\n\nM.Fin.\n\nFaculty\n\nDirector\n\nMarkus K.

Also not listed are graduate-level independent reading and research courses, which may be approved by the Graduate School for individual students.\n\nECO 525 - Asset Pricing (also FIN 525)\n\nAsset pricing in competitive markets where traders have homogeneous information as well as empirical tests of asset-pricing models and associated \"anomalies\" are also surveyed. Measures of riskiness and risk aversion; atemporal asset-pricing models; dynamic portfolio choice; option pricing; and the term structure of interest rates, corporate investment and financing decisions, and taxation are studied.\n\nECO 526 - Corporate Finance (also FIN 526)\n\nTheories and empirical evidence regarding financial markets and institutions that focus on asymmetric information, transaction costs, or both; and rational expectation models of asset pricing under asymmetric information, dynamic models of market making, portfolio manager performance evaluation, principal-agent models of firm managerial structure, takeover bids, capital structure, and regulation of financial markets are studied.\n\nECO 527 - Financial Modelling (also FIN 527)\n\nAdvanced asset pricing and corporate finance including a selection from: models of financial crises and bubbles; interaction between finance and macroeconomics, derivative pricing in incomplete markets; tests of asset pricing models and associated anomalies; models of investor behavior; financial econometrics, including tests of asset pricing models and methods for high frequency data. Pre-requisites: ECO 525 and 526 (526 may be taken concurrently).\n\nFIN 501 - Asset Pricing I: Pricing Models and Derivatives (also ORF 514)\n\nProvides an introduction of the modern theory of asset pricing. Topics include: (i) no arbitrage, Arrow-Debreu prices and equivalent martingale measure; (ii) security structure and market completeness; (iii) mean-variance analysis, Beta-Pricing, CAPM; and (iv) introduction to derivative pricing.\n\nFIN 502 - Corporate Finance and Financial Accounting\n\nModern financial theory and its implications for decisions faced by corporate financial officers. We focus on investment decisions and capital budgeting under various assumptions about the investment environment (for example, certain or uncertain outcomes) and the legal/regulatory environment (such as different types of tax regimes). We also examine financing decisions concerning the type of securities to be issued, amount of dividends to be paid, etc., plus a selection of additional topics, such as convertible/hybrid securities, real options, or corporate structure and control are also covered.\n\nFIN 515 - Portfolio Theory and Asset Management\n\nA number of advanced topics related to asset management and asset pricing are discussed, including mean-variance analysis, CAPM, APT, market efficiency, delegated money management, stock return predictability, bubble and crashes, social interaction and investor behavior, security analysts and investor relations, and mutual fund performance and organization.\n\nFIN 516 - Topics in Finance\n\nAgency and control issues in corporate finance such as managerial compensation, the role of corporate boards, takeovers, leveraged buyouts and bankruptcy. Course also studies the role of banks and other intermediaries' activities in facilitating investment and promoting sound corporate governance.\n\nFIN 519 - Corporate Restructuring, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\nExamines some of the most popular restructuring options available to corporate managers and will construct a framework to evaluate the implications they may have for shareholder value.\n\nFIN 521 - Fixed Income, Options and Derivatives: Models and Applications\n\nModels of valuation for fixed income securities. Topics include: (i) interest rate contracts: zerocoupon bonds, coupon bonds, floating rate notes, yields, forwards and futures, swaps, options, caps, swaptions; (ii) arbitrage free pricing in discrete time: Vasiek model, Ho-Lee model, BlackDerman-Toy model; (iii) introduction to continuous-time fixed income modeling: Black model, Heath-Jarrow-Morton; (iv) applications of arbitrage free models to pricing of interest rate contracts; (v) credit risk; (vi) mortgage-backed securities. Prerequisites: FIN501, MAT201-202 and recommend MAT203-204. Meets concurrently with ECO 466.\n\nFIN 522 - Financial Derivatives and Currencies\n\nDerivative securities--assets whose value depends on the value of other more basic underlying assets--are not only an important asset in their own right, but the central intuition provided by derivative securities pricing--the no-arbitrage principle--ties together many areas in finance. This course discusses the consequences of no-arbitrage for asset pricing and corporate finance. This course meets concurrently with ECO 465.\n\nFIN 523 - Forecasting and Time Series Analysis\n\nCourse develops a range of models, including macroeconomic ones, appropriate for the description and prediction of time series data. A by-product of this exposure is a greater appreciation of the assumptions implicit in regression analysis and econometrics. The primary focus is upon developing, applying, and critically evaluating statistical models that are appropriate in varying conditions. Each class of models is motivated by considering a particular well-known data series. The use of these models is facilitated through interactive, graphical computer software using a powerful graphical environment supported on department workstations.\n\nFIN 560 - Master's Project I\n\nUnder the direction of a Bendheim affiliated faculty member, students carry out a master's project, write a report, and present the results in the form of a poster or an oral presentation in front of an examining committee.\n\nFIN 561 - Master's Project II\n\nUnder the direction of a Bendheim affiliated faculty member, students carry out a master's project, write a report, and present the results in the form of a poster or an oral presentation in front of an examining committee.\n\nFIN 567 - Institutional Finance,Trading and Markets\n\nFinancial institutions play an increasingly dominant role in modern finance. This course studies financial institutions and focuses on the stability of the financial system. It covers important theoretical concepts and recent developments in financial intermediation, asset pricing under asymmetric information, behavioral finance and market microstructure. Topics include market efficiency, asset price bubbles, herding, liquidity crisis, risk management, market design and financial regulation.\n\nFIN 568 - Behavioral Finance\n\nTraditional economics and finance typically use the simple \"rational actor\" model, where people perfectly maximize, and efficient financial markets. We will present models that are psychologically more realistic than this standard model. About 30% of the course will be devoted to economics, 70% to finance. Applications to economics will include decision theory, happiness, fairness, and neuroeconomics. Applications to finance will include theory and evidence on investor psychology, predictability of the stock market and other markets, limits to arbitrage, bubbles and crashes, experimental finance, and behavioral corporate finance\n\nFIN 580 - Quantitative Data Analysis in Finance\n\nThe course gives a broad introduction to the techniques of machine learning, and places those techniques within the context of computational finance. Topics include parametric and non-parametric regression, and supervised learning techniques. Methods covered include linear models, logistic regression, additive models, LASSO, kernel methods, clustering methods and applications, support vector machines and classification. We also discuss the implementation of dimension reduction techniques, including principal components analysis. Examples are taken from financial models. FIN 505 is considered the prerequisite of the course.\n\nFIN 581 - Entrepreneurial Finance, Private Equity and Venture Capital\n\nThis course explores how technology-based start-up ventures are founded, managed and financed. Specific emphasis is put on the early stages of development. The goal is to offer perspectives on the \"two sides of the coin\": the entrepreneur's perspective and the financier's perspective (in particular the venture capitalist).\n\nFIN 591 - Financial Risk Management\n\nCourse examines the concept of risk and its mitigation, and how the ideas can be applied in the practice of risk management for financial and non-financial companies. The basic toolkit draws on economics, probability theory and statistics, and they are integrated with more advanced concepts drawn from portfolio choice, derivative securities and dynamic hedging. Overall aim of the course is to demonstrate how the main concepts have practical applications.\n\nFIN 592 - Asian Capital Markets\n\nCourse explores the increasing weight of Asia in global equity financial markets and its implications, and frames the discussion in the macro-economic context of the globalization of financial markets and the evolution of the global monetary system. Course puts particular emphasis on concepts of economic development, market efficiency, and corporate governance. Discussions combine analysis of historical trends and recent data and events with insights from practical experience in Asian equity markets. Course also explicitly considers the policy decisions faced by the US and Chinese governments relative to existing global imbalances.\n\nFIN 593 - Financial Crises\n\nThe use economic theory and empirical evidence to study the causes of financial crises and the effectiveness of policy responses to them. Particular attention given to some of the major economic and financial crises of the past century and to the crisis that began in August 2007.\n\nFIN 594 - Chinese Financial and Monetary Systems\n\nThis course aims to provide an in-depth coverage of China's monetary and financial systems, with a focus on their distinct characteristics.
