        "text": "Managing money means dealing with numbers and varying quantities. Mathematical models can be applied to complex behaviour in the financial markets. Well-qualified mathematicians and statisticians are therefore in great demand, with a wide choice of careers opportunities. This degree provides students with a particular set of mathematical skills that are ideal for work in the financial services technology sector. The course is a partnership with industry and includes project work related to capital markets and capital market instruments.\n\nIn 2020, more than 90% of 1st and 2nd year Maths students expressed overall satisfaction with their course\n\nMathematics with Finance highlights\n\nGlobal Opportunities\n\nWe participate in the competitive IAESTE and Turing student exchange programmes, which enable students to obtain work experience in companies and universities throughout the world.\n\nIndustry Links\n\nWe have key links with local companies who hire mathematics graduates. Several local financial services companies (including Clarus FT, Effex Capital and AquaQ Analytics) were founded by our former maths graduates. Indeed these companies are partners in the development of this degree programme.\n\nAll students in the school have the option to include a year in industry as part of their studies. This is a fantastic opportunity to see mathematics at work in the real world, and to enhance your career prospects at the same time.\n\nWorld Class Facilities\n\nThe school has its own dedicated teaching centre which opened in September 2016. This building houses lecture and group-study rooms, a hugely popular student social area and state-of-the-art computer facilities. The centre is an exciting hub for our students, and is situated directly adjacent to the Lanyon Building on the main university campus. This makes us the only school with a dedicated teaching space right at the heart of the university.\n\nInternationally Renowned Experts\n\nThe School of Mathematics and Physics is a large school with staff from 13 countries, including UK, US, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Bulgaria, Russia, Argentina, Cuba, Germany, China, Greece, Kenya, Niger, The Netherlands and Romania. Many of our staff are leading international experts in their fields of mathematical research. In the 2021 REF peer-review exercise, Mathematics Research had the 11th highest impact in the UK.\n\nThus the ethos of the School is one of excellence in research informing excellence in teaching.\n\nStudent Experience\n\nMany students find the transition from school to university somewhat daunting. In order to help with this transition, Mathematics students have introduced a Peer Mentoring scheme that is generally regarded as one of the most effective in the University. As well as providing a forum for first year students to obtain support, it also provides mentors with transferable skills which will increase graduate employment opportunities.\n\nFurther Study Opportunities\n\nPlacement Year\n\nStudents can take an optional placement year between years 2/3 of their course. Completion of an approved placement will be acknowledged in your final degree certificate with the addition of the words \"with placement year\".\n\nStudent Experience\n\nSchool has the 3rd highest postgraduate research student satisfaction in the university.\n\nCareer Development\n\n87% of Maths students are in graduate employment or further study 15 months after graduation (11th in the UK)\n\nNEXT\n\nCourse content\n\nCourse Structure\n\nCourse Content\n\nThe course unit details given below are subject to change, and are the latest example of the curriculum available on this course of study.\n\nStage 1\n\nAt Stage 1 students must take five compulsory modules.\n\nStage 2\n\nAt Stage 2, students must take six compulsory modules.\n\nStage 3\n\nAt Stage 3, students must take six compulsory modules.\n\nPeople teaching you\n\nAssociate Director of Education, Mathematics\n\nSchool of Maths & Physics\n\nDr Huettemann is a Senior Lecturer in Mathematics with research interests in homological algebra, graded algebra and K-theory.\n\nContact Teaching Hours\n\nLarge Group Teaching\n\n10 (hours maximum)\n\n10 hours of lectures.\n\nPersonal Study\n\n21 (hours maximum)\n\n21 hours studying and revising in your own time each week, including some guided study using handouts, online activities, etc.\n\nSmall Group Teaching/Personal Tutorial\n\n1 (hours maximum)\n\n1 hour of tutorials (or later, project supervision) each week.\n\nMedium Group Teaching\n\n4 (hours maximum)\n\n4 hours of practical classes, workshops or seminars each week.\n\nLearning and Teaching\n\nThe BSc in Mathematics with Finance has been developed in partnership with industry, and combines the development of mathematical and statistical skills with finance modules in the Queen’s Management School to further insight into capital markets.\n\nAt Queen’s, we aim to deliver a high quality learning environment that embeds intellectual curiosity, innovation and best practice in learning, teaching and student support to enable students to achieve their full academic potential.\n\nOn the BSc in Mathematics with Finance we do this by providing a range of learning experiences which enable our students to engage with subject experts, develop attributes and perspectives that will equip them for life and work in a global society and make use of innovative technologies and a world class library that enhances their development as independent, lifelong learners. Examples of the opportunities provided for learning on this course are:\n\nComputer based modules\n\nThese provide students with the opportunity to develop technical skills and apply theoretical principles to real-life or practical contexts.\n\nE-learning technologies\n\nInformation associated with lectures and assignments is often communicated via a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) called Canvas. A range of e-learning experiences are also embedded in the degree programme through the use of, for example, interactive support materials and web-based learning activities.\n\nLectures\n\nThese introduce basic information about new topics as a starting point for further self-directed private study/reading. Lectures also provide opportunities to ask questions, gain some feedback and advice on assessments (normally delivered in large groups to all year group peers). Some of the modules are taught by the Management School at Queen’s which means students will learn about capital financial markets, financial instruments and investment institutions, and thus develop their industry awareness to complement the technical training.\n\nPersonal Tutor\n\nUndergraduates are allocated a Personal Tutor during Level 1 and 2 who meets with them on several occasions during the year to support their academic development.\n\nSelf-directed study\n\nThis is an essential part of life as a Queen’s student when important private reading, engagement with e-learning resources, reflection on feedback to date and assignment research and preparation work is carried out.\n\nSupervised projects\n\nOur partner companies are committed to support industry-led projects that will enable students to engage with real-life problems and gain invaluable industry experience, while learning practical mathematical skills relevant to local companies. In final year, students will be expected to carry out a significant piece of research on projects offered by these companies. Students will receive support from a course supervisor in addition to a company representative who will guide them in terms of how to carry out research and who will provide feedback during the project. These companies will also deliver professional skills workshops for students on this programme.\n\nTutorials\n\nSignificant amounts of teaching are carried out in small groups (typically 10-20 students). These provide an opportunity for students to engage with academic staff who have specialist knowledge of the topic, to ask questions of them and to assess their own progress and understanding with the support of peers.\n\nAssessment\n\nThe way in which students are assessed will vary according to the learning objectives of each module. Details of how each module is assessed are shown in the Student Handbook which is available online via the school website.\n\nMost modules are assessed through a combination of coursework and end of year examinations.\n\nSome modules (eg, final year Honours Project module) are assessed solely through project work or written assignments.\n\nComputer Based Assessment\n\nSome modules use online quizzes/tests as part of the module assessment. This tests basic knowledge, understanding and problem solving.\n\nFeedback\n\nAs students’ progress through their course at Queen’s they will receive general and specific feedback about their work from a variety of sources including lecturers, personal tutors, advisers of study and peers. University students are expected to engage with reflective practice and to use this approach to improve the quality of their work. Feedback may be provided in a variety of forms including:\n\nFeedback provided via formal written comments and marks relating to work that you, as an individual or as part of a group, have submitted.\n\nFace to face comment. This may include occasions when you make use of the lecturers’ advertised “office hours” to help you to address a specific query.\n\nPlacement employer comments or references.\n\nOnline or emailed comment.\n\nGeneral comments or question and answer opportunities at the end of a lecture, seminar or tutorial.\n\nPre-submission advice regarding the standards you should aim for and common pitfalls to avoid. In some instances, this may be provided in the form of model answers or exemplars that you can review in your own time.\n\nFeedback and outcomes from practical classes.\n\nComment and guidance provided by staff from specialist support services such as, Careers, Employability and Skills or the Learning Development Service.\n\nOnce you have reviewed your feedback, you will be encouraged to identify and implement further improvements to the quality of your work.\n\nFacilities\n\nA new Teaching Centre for Mathematics and Physics opened in September 2016. This provides a dedicated space for teaching within the School. Facilities for mathematics include new lecture and group-study rooms, a new student social area and state-of-the-art computer facilities. The Centre will be the exciting central hub for our students.\n\nWhat our academics say\n\nThis degree choice is a great way to combine a deep interest in mathematics with the practical skills and experience needed for a career working in finance. Students really enjoy developing and applying high-level mathematical techniques in a wide range of areas such as predicting behaviours and correlations in stock markets or estimating lifetimes of oil fields. Being able to apply your mathematical skills to areas such as these is highly rewarding not only for the sheer fun of solving the problem, but also because it is a skill that is highly sought after by employers.\n\nDr Daniel Dundas - Course Convenor for Mathematics with Finance.\n\nPREV\n\nOverview\n\nNEXT\n\nModules\n\nModules\n\nThe information below is intended as an example only, featuring module details for the current year of study (2023/24).

Once your on-line form has been processed by UCAS and forwarded to Queen's, an acknowledgement is normally sent within two weeks of its receipt at the University.\n\nSelection is on the basis of the information provided on your UCAS form. Decisions are made on an ongoing basis and will be notified to you via UCAS.\n\nFor entry last year, applicants for programmes in the School of Mathematics and Physics offering A-level/BTEC Level 3 qualifications must have had, or been able to achieve, a minimum of five GCSE passes at grade C/4 or better (to include English Language and Mathematics), though this profile may change from year to year depending on the demand for places. The Selector also checks that any specific entry requirements in terms of GCSE and/or A-level subjects can be fulfilled.\n\nOffers are normally made on the basis of three A-levels. The offer for repeat candidates may be one grade higher than for first time applicants. Grades may be held from the previous year.\n\nApplicants offering two A-levels and one BTEC Subsidiary Diploma/National Extended Certificate (or equivalent qualification), or one A-level and a BTEC Diploma/National Diploma (or equivalent qualification) will also be considered. Offers will be made in terms of the overall BTEC grade(s) awarded. Please note that a maximum of one BTEC Subsidiary Diploma/National Extended Certificate (or equivalent) will be counted as part of an applicant’s portfolio of qualifications. The normal GCSE profile will be expected.\n\nFor applicants offering the Irish Leaving Certificate, please note that performance at Irish Junior Certificate (IJC) is taken into account. For last year’s entry, applicants for this degree must have had a minimum of five IJC grades at C/Merit. The Selector also checks that any specific entry requirements in terms of Leaving Certificate subjects can be satisfied.\n\nApplicants offering other qualifications will also be considered. The same GCSE (or equivalent) profile is usually expected of those candidates offering other qualifications.\n\nThe information provided in the personal statement section and the academic reference together with predicted grades are noted but, in the case of degree courses in the School of Mathematics and Physics, these are not the final deciding factors in whether or not a conditional offer can be made. However, they may be reconsidered in a tie break situation in August.\n\nA-level General Studies and A-level Critical Thinking would not normally be considered as part of a three A-level offer and, although they may be excluded where an applicant is taking four A-level subjects, the grade achieved could be taken into account if necessary in August/September.\n\nCandidates are not normally asked to attend for interview.\n\nIf you are made an offer then you may be invited to a Faculty/School Visit Day, which is usually held in the second semester. This will allow you the opportunity to visit the University and to find out more about the degree programme of your choice and the facilities on offer. It also gives you a flavour of the academic and social life at Queen's.\n\nIf you cannot find the information you need here, please contact the University Admissions and Access Service (admissions@qub.ac.uk), giving full details of your qualifications and educational background.\n\nInternational Students\n\nOur country/region pages include information on entry requirements, tuition fees, scholarships, student profiles, upcoming events and contacts for your country/region.
