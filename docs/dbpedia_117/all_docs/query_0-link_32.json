        "text": "The program in Mathematics of Finance and Risk Management (or Mathematics of Finance for short) is designed to provide a broad education in the quantitative aspects of risk management and finance. Today's financial instruments require sophisticated mathematical techniques for their valuation. These techniques come from the fields of probability, statistics and differential equations.\n\nMathematics of Finance & Risk Management Subplan Checklist\n\nI. Prerequisites\n\nPrerequisite to concentration in Mathematics of Finance is one of the pair of courses 215 & 217, 285 & 217, or 295 & 296. In addition, each student must complete two introductory courses in Economics (Econ 101 and 102), and acquire a working knowledge of a high-level computer language (e.g. Fortran, C or C++) at a level equivalent to completion of EECS 183.\n\nThe concentration program must include at least ten courses: 4 basic courses (II.), 4 special Mathematics of Finance courses (III.), and 2 related courses (IV.) as described below.\n\nII. Basic Courses\n\nBasic courses consist of one from each of the following groups completed with a grade of at least C-:\n\nDifferential Equations: Math 286 or 316\n\nProbability: Math 525\n\nStatistics: Stats 426\n\nAnalysis: Math 351, or 451\n\nMore advanced students, such as those who have completed Math 396, may substitute higher level courses with the approval of a major advisor.\n\nIII. Special Courses\n\nThe special Mathematics of Finance courses must include Math 423, 474, 472, and 526. Careful planning is essential.\n\nIV. Related Courses\n\nTo complete the major program each student should elect two additional intermediate or advanced courses related to Financial Mathematics. Some, but not all, of the courses numbered 300 and above offered by Accounting, Computer Science, Economics, Finance, Industrial and Operations Engineering, and Statistics are appropriate here. Some specific approved courses are:\n\n422 Risk Mgmt & Insurance FIN 408 &\n\n(1.5 Credits Each) 462 Mathematical Models FIN 409\n\nCapital Markets AND Fixed Inc Sec\n\n623 Computational Finance IOE 310\n\nIntro Optim Methods\n\nECON 401 Inter Micro Theory IOE 452 Corporate Finance\n\nECON 402 Inter Macro FIN 302 Financial Decisions ECON 409 Game Theory FIN 317 Corp Financing Decisions ECON 452 Intro to Econometrics\n\nSome Statistics courses numbered above 400\n\nAll Accounting courses 300 and above, except 471"
