        "text": "Entry requirements\n\nA minimum of an upper second-class Bachelor's degree in a relevant discipline from a UK university or an overseas qualification of an equivalent standard.\n\nThe English language level for this programme is: Level 2\n\nUCL Pre-Master's and Pre-sessional English courses are for international students who are aiming to study for a postgraduate degree at UCL. The courses will develop your academic English and academic skills required to succeed at postgraduate level.\n\nFurther information can be found on our English language requirements page.\n\nEquivalent qualifications\n\nCountry-specific information, including details of when UCL representatives are visiting your part of the world, can be obtained from the International Students website.\n\nInternational applicants can find out the equivalent qualification for their country by selecting from the list below. Please note that the equivalency will correspond to the broad UK degree classification stated on this page (e.g. upper second-class). Where a specific overall percentage is required in the UK qualification, the international equivalency will be higher than that stated below. Please contact Graduate Admissions should you require further advice.\n\nSelect your country\n\nThe foundation of your career\n\nThe financial services industry places great emphasis on raising the level of mathematics used in banks in applications to pricing, hedging and risk management. This MSc programme provides students with the skills necessary in mathematics, statistics and computation for a career in this fast-developing field.\n\nEmployability\n\nThis programme provides graduates with the skills and knowledge for a wide range of career prospects, particularly in the financial services industry, which requires quantitative finance professionals who are able to analyse data, to programme, and who are experts in mathematics and computational statistics.\n\nNetworking\n\nThe Financial Mathematics MSc offers several networking opportunities throughout the year. For example, students are welcome to attend the London Mathematical Finance Seminars, the Industry Practitioner's Seminar, and benefit from the Financial Mathematics Group's industry network. Each year, Financial Mathematics MSc students at UCL have an opportunity to participate in the annual Financial Mathematics Team Challenge (FMTC), usually held during the month of July. The FMTC gives students a chance to work on a topical research project in an international student team that is mentored by an academic or an industry practitioner.\n\nTeaching and learning\n\nThe Financial Mathematics MSc is a taught postgraduate programme requiring students to take eight modules, four of which can be selected from a list of electives. In addition, students are required to write a research dissertation on a topical project during the summer months. The MSc project is supervised by an academic or a suitable industry practitioner. Some of the MSc modules include a coursework component. All modules include exercise sets allowing students to practice the taught material regularly.\n\nThe programme is delivered through a combination of lectures, practical classes, tutorials and problem-solving exercises. Assessment is through written papers, coursework, examinations and the research report and presentation.\n\nTypically, each taught module has 30 hours of lectures. About 20-25 hours a week are recommended for independent study. In addition, students are encouraged to use office hours provided by the lecturers. Research projects require a similar amount of time although the work is mostly individual accompanied by regular meetings with the project supervisor.\n\nModules\n\nThe course is equivalent to 180 UCL credits. The programme normally consists of 4 compulsory components (60 credits), 4 optional components (60 credits), plus an individual project (60 credits).\n\nPart-time students will follow the same timetable as full-time students, just taking 2 modules per term across 2 years.\n\nPlease note that the list of modules given here is indicative. This information is published a long time in advance of enrolment and module content and availability are subject to change. Modules that are in use for the current academic year are linked for further information. Where no link is present, further information is not yet available.\n\nStudents undertake modules to the value of 180 credits. Upon successful completion of 180 credits, you will be awarded an MSc in Financial Mathematics.\n\nAccessibility\n\nDetails of the accessibility of UCL buildings can be obtained from AccessAble accessable.co.uk. Further information can also be obtained from the UCL Student Support and Wellbeing team.\n\nFees and funding\n\nFees for this course\n\nUK students International students\n\nFee description Full-time Part-time Tuition fees (2024/25) £22,700 £11,350 Tuition fees (2024/25) £41,000 £20,500\n\nThe tuition fees shown are for the year indicated above.
