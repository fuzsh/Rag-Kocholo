        "text": "Program Preparation\n\nThe Financial Mathematics program requires students to complete 98-100 credits. This major requires more credit hours than a typical major at SOU. Ideal students of this program should have a strong interest and commitment in data analysis and finance. Candidates are strongly encouraged to complete pre-calculus and introductory statistics before they declare this program as their major.\n\nDegree Roadmap\n\nFinancial Mathematics students will complete approximately 40 credits of applied mathematics and statistics, 40 credits of business topics with emphasis in finance, at least 12 credits of economics courses and a capstone. Students will develop strong analytical and practical skills in the area of finance and statistics.\n\nCapstone\n\nFinancial Mathematics students are required to complete a capstone program either in Mathematics or Business. Mathematics capstone requires a two-term sequence of six or eight credits, generally over winter and spring academic terms. Business capstone requires a one-term course of four credits. Through capstone, students will have an opportunity to enrich their educational experiences by doing research, writing and presentation."
