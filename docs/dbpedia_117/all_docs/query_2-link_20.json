        "text": "Launched in 2020, Wharton’s quantitative finance major brings together students from a variety of academic backgrounds, such as computer science, engineering, and technology, and prepares them for successful leadership roles in finance. The major allows students to dive into financial economics and data analysis while also gaining the leadership and communication skills that are at the heart of the Wharton MBA experience.\n\n“Finance, much of it quantitative, fuels the world’s economy,” said Dr. Bruce I. Jacobs, G’79, GRW’86, co-founder of Jacobs Levy Equity Management, whose gifts to Wharton bolstered the new quantitative finance major by creating a professorship and a Scholars initiative for top students in the program. “Innovations created by quantitative finance contribute meaningfully to global economic growth and will continue to do so at an increasing pace. It’s imperative that future business leaders have a basic understanding of quantitative finance. Wharton’s new major provides the opportunity to explore this vitally important field.”\n\nWe spoke with six inaugural Jacobs Scholars to learn more about why they decided to major in quantitative finance, how it has impacted their academic experience, and what they hope to accomplish in the future.\n\nAbisola Otesile, WG’21\n\nPrevious Education: Imperial College London, MSc in Advanced Mechanical Engineering\n\nPrevious Experience: Started at Procter & Gamble as a Process Engineer before joining McKinsey & Company where I served corporate clients across Africa and NA\n\nWharton Major/Program: Quantitative Finance and Operations, Information, and Decisions\n\nWhat has your Jacobs Scholars Program experience been like so far?\n\nIt’s been a stretch experience for me. I’m surrounded by incredibly brilliant colleagues and faculty, who share their perspectives on finance and key trends. It’s really opened my mind to the world of finance and now I believe I can understand technical topics that I never understood before Wharton.\n\nWhy did you decide to pursue the quantitative finance major?\n\nI believe a good grasp and understanding of investments, especially around the application of financial tools and techniques for infrastructure investors, is key to unlocking the African economy for unprecedented growth.\n\nI want to be at the forefront of infrastructure investments in Africa. I believe I have the requisite tools to get me started.\n\nTony Maggio WG’21\n\nPrevious Education: University of California, Berkeley, BS Civil Engineering; Stanford University, MS Civil Engineering\n\nPrevious Experience: Coastal Engineer at Moffatt & Nichol\n\nWharton Major/Program: Quantitative Finance\n\nWhy did you decide to pursue the quantitative finance major and what advice do you have for someone considering this path?\n\nMy engineering career gave me a strong quantitative and statistical background, which I wanted to apply to finance in pursuing a career in investment banking. Do not be shy or intimidated by the major! Despite the complicated subject matter, the faculty and resources will truly turn anyone into an expert.\n\nWhat most excites you about the Jacobs Scholars Program?\n\nThe most exciting part of the program is the access to staff and faculty. This has included meeting Dr. Jacobs himself, special lectures from professors, and other academic opportunities for Jacobs Scholars to extend our knowledge beyond the core curriculum.\n\nEmily Peach, WG’21\n\nPrevious Education: Oxford University, MChem Chemistry\n\nPrevious Experience: BCG London\n\nWharton Major/Program: Quantitative Finance and Business Analytics\n\nWhat has your Jacobs Scholars Program experience been like so far?\n\nI have thoroughly enjoyed my experience so far. Meeting others in the class with similar interests and working with them on projects in classes has been great. In addition, the opportunity to hear about Dr. Jacobs’s experiences has been extremely enjoyable and insightful.\n\nWhat advice do you have for someone considering the Wharton MBA Program and the quantitative finance major?\n\nThe quantitative finance major has several incredibly interesting classes which have given me a great background in multiple finance topics including derivatives and fixed income securities. It has also allowed me to follow other interests, including a class on international financial markets.\n\nRaj Thaker, WG’21\n\nPrevious Education: Dartmouth College, BA in Economics and Mathematics\n\nPrevious Experience: Head of Equity Risk at State Street Global Advisors (2017 – 2019), Investment Risk Analyst (2014 – 2017)\n\nWharton Major/Program: Quantitative Finance, Accounting, and Management\n\nWhat most excites you about the Jacobs Scholars Program?\n\nAs a former practitioner in the field, this has been an excellent program to learn more about the theoretical side of quantitative finance. Many people think of quantitative finance as using formulas to calculate an answer, but it’s very important to understand the theories these formulas are built upon. By presenting the history and work leading to these concepts, the curriculum has substantially strengthened my knowledge of the field.\n\nHow is the quantitative finance curriculum preparing you for post-graduation success?\n\nAfter graduation, I’ll be working in consulting. This rigorous curriculum has served to sharpen both my quantitative and analytical skills, which I believe will prove valuable no matter where my career takes me.\n\nAditi Kamat, WG’21\n\nPrevious Education: Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, BTech in Electrical Engineering (Honors) with Computer Science (Minor)\n\nPrevious Experience: Associate at Bain Capital Advisors – Private Equity (2017-19), Business Analyst at McKinsey & Co. (2015-17)\n\nWharton Major/Program: Quantitative Finance and Business Analytics\n\nWhat most excites you about the Jacobs Scholars Program?\n\nThe pace of technological advances is very likely to result in a new era in investment management. The future of finance will be more quantitative than ever. Today, backed by knowledge and support from notable professionals, I feel empowered to contribute meaningfully towards cutting edge research in investment management across the world.\n\nWhat has your Jacobs Scholars Program experience been like so far?\n\nThe Jacobs Scholars Program has provided me immense encouragement to pursue my passion in finance with a renewed vigor through advanced courses in quantitative finance and networking opportunities with notable investors and academicians. Such opportunities will surely expand my knowledge and help me develop a unique, dynamic approach to investing that combines human intuition and quantitative methods.\n\nEric Sun, WG’21\n\nPrevious Education: University of Pennsylvania, Bachelor of Science in Economics\n\nPrevious Experience: Technology, Media, & Telecommunications (“TMT”) Investing at KKR and Management Consulting at BCG\n\nWharton Major/Program: Quantitative Finance, Entrepreneurship & Innovation, and Organizational Effectiveness\n\nWhat has your Jacobs Scholars Program experience been like so far?\n\nThe Jacobs Scholars Program introduced new coursework offerings and enhanced career opportunities. It combines the best elements of an MBA program and technical finance knowledge. Having a community of peers with a shared interest in quantitative finance has been conducive to my and my classmates’ learning.\n\nHow is the quantitative finance curriculum preparing you for post-graduation success?\n\nWhile my career goals are evolving as I learn, I have enjoyed work that requires a strong understanding of finance. I expect applications of financial concepts to permeate my career. Knowledge of data science applications in finance and of asset pricing models will be valuable.\n\n— Erin Lomboy, W’21\n\nPosted: February 18, 2021"
