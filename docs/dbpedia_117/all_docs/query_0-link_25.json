This paper proposes a new model to measure quote volatility based on the point process and price-change duration. Specifically, we built a change-point intensity (CPI) model to describe the dynamics of price-change events for a given level of threshold. The instantaneous volatility of quote price can be calculated at any time according to price-change intensities. Based on this, we can quantify the cost of demanding liquidity for traders with different trading latency by using integrated variances. Furthermore, we use the autoregressive conditional intensity (ACI) model proposed by Russell (1999) as a benchmark comparison. The results suggest that our model has better performance of both in-sample fitness and out-of-sample prediction.

We first employ time-varying parameter VAR (TVP-VAR) models to investigate the role of rare disaster risk in the price dynamics of major asset markets. The results indicate that disaster risk generally has a more intense and persistent impact on crude oil and stock markets when compared to gold and bond markets. However, the role of rare disaster risk differs substantially between commodity and financial assets, as well as between the short and long term. Moreover, when using a nonparametric causality-in-quantiles method to detect causal relationships, we provide evidence of the nonlinear causality effect of rare disaster risks on asset volatilities, and not their returns, except for crude oil. In addition, we demonstrate that augmenting a diversified portfolio of stock or bonds with gold can significantly increase its risk-adjusted performance. The findings have important implications for investors as well as policymakers.

Considering a general regression model with explanatory variables (the expected value model form) and the error term (including heteroscedasticity), the optimal expected value and heteroscedastic model forms are investigated by linear, nonlinear, curvilinear, and composition function forms, using the minimum mean-squared error criterion to show the precision of the methodology. After combining the two optimal models, the fitted values of the financial data are more precise than the linear regression model in the literature and also show the fitted model forms in the example of Taiwan stock price index futures that has three cases: (1) before COVID-19, (2) during COVID-19, and (3) the entire observation time period. The fitted mathematical models can apparently show how COVID-19 affects the return rates of Taiwan stock price index futures. Furthermore, the fitted heteroscedastic models also show how COVID-19 influences the fluctuations of the return rates of Taiwan stock price index futures. This methodology will contribute to the probability of building algorithms for computing and predicting financial data based on mathematical model form outcomes and assist model comparisons after adding new data to a database.

By analyzing the characteristics of China’s financial system, this paper constructs the Finance Structure Index (FSI) from the perspectives of structural efficiency, financing structure and industry structure, and interprets the trend of the FSI. Based on the quarterly data of China from 2004 to 2020, this paper constructs a time-varying parameter-vector autoregression (TVP-VAR) model to study the dynamic impact of finance structure on the growth and optimization of the structure of the real economy. The empirical analysis results show that the response of the real economy has time-varying characteristics. Early on, financial structure has a promotion effect on the scale of the real economy, but the impact on the structure is not clear. In the middle, the effect of promoting the scale decreases slightly and then rebounds rapidly, while the optimization of the structure is inhibited. Later, it has a significant promoting effect and an obvious time-lag effect. Moreover, the impact of the financial structure is unstable. It is necessary to improve the efficiency and quality of the transmission of the optimization of the financial structure to the real economy.

Since the stock markets react quickly to certain announcements, the used methodology is appropriate to evaluate how the aforementioned markets reacted to certain events. The purpose of this research was to evaluate possibilities of obtaining profits on the stock markets during great turbulences, when a majority of the participants panic. More specifically, the contrarian trading strategies are observed if they can obtain gains, although a majority of the markets suffer great losses during pandemic shocks. The contributions to the existing literature of this research are as follows. Firstly, empirical research on CESEE stock markets regarding other relevant topics is still scarce and should be explored more. Secondly, the event study approach of COVID-19 effects utilized in this study has (to the knowledge of the author) not yet been explored on the aforementioned markets. Thirdly, based on the results of CESEE market reactions to specific announcements regarding COVID-19, a simulation of simple trading strategies will be made in order to estimate whether some investors could have profited in certain periods. The results of the study indicate promising results in terms of exploiting other investors’ panicking during the greatest decline of stock market indices. Namely, the initial results, as expected, indicate strong negative effects of specific COVID-19 announcements on the selected stock markets. Secondly, the obtained information was shown to be useful for contrarian strategy in order to exploit great dips in the stock market indices values.

Risks change over time, so capital risk allocations should be time-dependent. In this paper, we propose a dynamic covariance capital allocation principle based on the variance-covariance of risks that change over time. The conditional correlation of risks is modeled by means of a dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) model. Unlike the static approach, we show that in our dynamic capital allocation setting, the distribution of risk capital allocations can be estimated, and the expected future allocations of capital can be predicted, providing a deeper understanding of the stochastic multivariate behavior of risks. The methodology presented in the paper is illustrated with an example involving the investment risk in a stock portfolio.

Using data from Apple mobility trends and several time-series econometric models, we find that investors became active participants during the COVID-19 pandemic period and traded more bitcoins on days with low mobility associated with lockdown mandates. These results remain robust after controlling for stocks and gold returns, the VIX index, and the level of attention and sentiment toward Bitcoin, as measured by Google search frequencies and the tone of Tweets discussing Bitcoin. These results suggest that when individual investors have ample free time on their hands, they trade cryptocurrencies as a pastime and use the Bitcoin market as a form of entertainment. Moreover, our results have important implications concerning investors’ herding behavior and overconfidence leading to noise trader risks and bubbles typically accompanied by high trading volume in cryptocurrency markets.

STEM students have a good capacity in mathematics and science, but they may not have studied financial theory. To facilitate the classroom teaching of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) for STEM students, this paper seeks to expound on the essence of the theory starting at a two-asset framework. Adopting the concepts proposed by Merton (1972), this paper accomplishes the derivation by virtue of basic mathematical tools such as linear algebra, geometry, and statistics except for calculus. We show that the major aspects of Merton’s derivation of the CAPM for a universe of N assets may also be obtained in a two-asset world. Through the methods of this article, students will learn the in-depth theory of CAPM and its hands-on empirical tool. For example, students will realize that even if investors specify different threshold rewards, their different CAPMs will yield identical pricing for assets and portfolios.

As a result, renewable energy companies seem to be profitable investment opportunities given their likely substantial future earnings. However, previous empirical evidence has not always agreed about this likely profitability. In addition, the methodologies employed in the existing empirical literature are complicated and not feasible for most investors to use. Therefore, it is proposed an approach which combines the use of performance measures, screening rules, devolatized returns and portfolio strategies, all of which can be implemented by investors. This approach results in high cumulative returns of more than 200% and other positive ratios, even when transaction costs are considered. This should encourage people to invest in these renewable energies and contribute to improving the environment.

Next, causal impact of global factors as drivers of uncertainty transmission between oil and other commodity markets is analyzed. Our analysis suggests that oil is a net transmitter to other commodity uncertainties, and this transmission significantly increased during the global financial crisis of 2008–2009. The use of linear and nonlinear causality tests indicates that the global factors have a causal effect on the overall connectedness, and especially on the spillovers from oil to other commodity uncertainties. Further segregation of transmissions between oil to individual commodity markets indicates that stock market implied volatility, risk spread, and economic policy uncertainty are the influential drivers of connectedness among commodity markets.

As a result, there has been an increase in the development of different investor sentiment measurements. This paper analyses whether the Bloomberg investor sentiment index has a causal relationship with the abnormal returns and volume shocks of major European Union (EU) financial companies through a sample of 85 financial institutions over 4 years (2014–2018) on a daily basis. The i.i.d. shocks are obtained from a factorial asset pricing model and ARMA-GARCH-type process; then we checked whether there is both individual and joint causality between the standardized residuals. The results show that the explanatory capacity of the shocks of the firm Bloomberg sentiment index is low, although there is empirical evidence that the effects correspond more to the situation of the financial subsector (banks, real estate, financial services and insurance) than to the company itself, with which we conclude that the sentiment index analyzed reflects a sectorial effect more than individual one.
