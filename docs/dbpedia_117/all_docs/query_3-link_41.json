        "text": "Course description\n\nSpend an immersive three years learning the principles and practices of the finance industry, and the fundamental maths behind banking, insurance, accountancy and more.\n\nJointly delivered by the University of Sheffield School of Mathematics and Statistics, the Department of Economics and the Management School, this financial mathematics degree teaches the numerical skills and specialist knowledge you need for your career in finance.\n\nYour first year is about giving you the best possible grounding with maths essentials and finance-specific topics, enabling you to make an informed choice between following an economics or finance pathway.\n\nIn year two you unlock more advanced topics in economics or finance, such as microeconomics, macroeconomics, econometrics and corporate finance.\n\nSome module options include more project work. This gives you the chance to put your mathematics skills into practice in different contexts and scenarios that you might encounter when you start work after graduation.\n\nBy third year, you’ll have the skills, knowledge and experience to go in lots of different directions in finance and mathematics. We’ll give you lots of optional modules to choose from, so you can study the topics that are most useful to the career path you want to take, or that you enjoy the most.\n\nWhy study this course?\n\nLeading maths research - 96% of our research is rated as world-leading or internationally excellent, according to the Research Excellence Framework 2021.\n\nReal-world problem solving - research unanswered questions, from the most abstract research in areas like algebraic geometry and number theory, to the calculations behind animal movements and black holes.\n\nTailor your degree - you have the option to choose from an economics or management pathway, allowing you to focus on the areas you enjoy the most.\n\nWelcoming community for everyone - we have an active student society (SUMS), regular maths challenges, and a dedicated LGBT+ student group for maths students.\n\nTriple Crown Accredited Management School - The Management School is a leading business school with Triple Crown accreditation (AACSB, AMBA and EQUIS), where many academics have former industrial experience which they bring to their teaching.\n\nBook an open day\n\nSchool of Mathematical and Physical Sciences\n\nThe School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences is leading the way with groundbreaking research and innovative teaching. We provide our students with the skills and knowledge to support them in a wide range of careers.\n\nMathematicians at the University of Sheffield work on a wide range of topics, from the most abstract research in areas like algebraic geometry and number theory, to the calculations behind animal movements and black holes. They’ll guide you through the key concepts and techniques that every mathematician needs to understand and give you a huge range of optional modules to choose from.\n\nWe want mathematics and statistics students to feel part of a community. At the heart of this is the Sheffield University Mathematics Society, or SUMS, who organise activities throughout the academic year, from charity fundraisers to nights out. Our students also take part in pizza lectures, rocket engineering projects, international maths challenges, and an LGBT+ support group for maths students.\n\nMathematics and statistics students are based in the Hicks Building, which has classrooms, lecture theatres, computer rooms and social spaces. It's right next door to the UK’s number one students’ union, down the road from the 24/7 library facilities at the Information Commons and the Diamond, and a short walk from the city centre.\n\nSchool of Mathematical and Physical Sciences\n\nManagement School\n\nWe are a world leading management school with Triple Crown accreditation (AACSB, AMBA and EQUIS).\n\nThese awards have been achieved through the outstanding quality of our programmes, research output, support for students and alumni, and links with industry. We have a world-class reputation for high quality teaching, ground-breaking research and cutting-edge thinking.\n\nYou’ll be part of a dynamic and engaging management school that puts you and your future at the heart of everything it does.
