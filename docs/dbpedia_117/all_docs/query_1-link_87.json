        "text": "I recommend against game theory and prospect theory. This is a high school student who probably won't be used to distinguishing between normative models and descriptive models, and the result might be that he picks up jargon without understanding anything useful. That could be practice for business, but not satisfying for you, I hope.\n\nA fundamental question in financial math is how to evaluate a security which pays you $1/year forever, a \"perpetuity.\" I would start there. You only need high school algebra to approach this. You can add inflation and risk, and then get into basic statistical analysis, options pricing (use simple discrete models with no calculus), etc.\n\nI like the following example because a) it comes down to simple algebra, b) it's a window into a much deeper set of ideas, and c) the result is strikingly counterintuitive, which gets students' attention:\n\nA stock sells for \\$10 today. One year from now, it will sell for \\$20 with probability $p$ and for \\$5 with probability $1-p$. Let $C$ be the amount you are willing to pay today for an option that allows you to buy one share for \\$10 a year from now. Is $C$ increasing or decreasing in $p$?\n\nThe surprising answer is that $C$ is independent of $p$. It is (equally suprisingly) also independent of your tolerance for risk. It depends only on the numbers given above and the interest rate.\n\nOnce you've taught this example, you can make a good exam question by replacing the option to buy with an option to sell.\n\nRobert Aumann's theorem on agreeing-to-disagree (the original article can be found here) is a fun result that can be motivated by simple puzzles. Moreover, it is the basis of the no-trade-theorems in finance that show that rational expectations rule out speculative trading. A leisurely introduction to this, Aumann's theorem, and related issues can be found here. This article also motivates these issues in terms of a puzzle for children. I think it should be possible to select some topics that are (at some level) understandable by someone in high school. Moreover, this is a topic that raises questions and gives no answers, so you will not indoctrinate your student."
