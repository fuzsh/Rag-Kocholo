        "text": "As a mathematical economics major at Bucknell, you'll dig past the data in spreadsheets and trend curves to uncover real stories and understand the quantitative models that drive global economic decisions.\n\nAs you acquire an ever-growing library of statistical and mathematical methods and apply them to economic questions, you'll learn more than just how to conduct an economic analysis. You'll understand why the analysis works. The powerful quantitative, interdisciplinary and critical thinking skills our students gain lead nearly half of our graduates to jobs as analysts their first year after Bucknell.\n\nOther recent graduates have found fulfilling careers as traders, actuaries and financial advisers, and have been accepted to graduate programs in biostatistics, law, commerce and finance.\n\nWhy Study Mathematical Economics?\n\nThe mathematical economics major is for students with an interest in economics who want to learn more about the statistical methods used in the field. A love for data is a must, as well as a curiosity for understanding how things work. The major incorporates a greater focus on mathematics and analytics than Bucknell's economics major, and it allows you to choose from three concentrations:\n\nStatistical: A track that's laser focused on understanding statistical methods and why they work\n\nComputational: A track built around using and understanding computational tools and algorithms to solve problems in economics\n\nTheoretical: A track offering greater emphasis on pure, theoretical math\n\nThe analytical skills you gain will prepare you for in-demand careers in a variety of industries and nonprofit fields. Recent mathematical economics graduates are now working for:\n\nBooz Allen Hamilton\n\nCigna\n\nFederal Finance Housing Agency\n\nGoldman Sachs\n\nMaryland Department of Budget and Management\n\nMorgan Stanley\n\nNielsen\n\nNorthrup Grumman\n\nPfizer\n\nViacom\n\nYou may also consider a double major in economics and mathematics or combining a major and minor in the two fields.\n\nDeepen Your Education Through Internships\n\nNearly all mathematical economics majors will have at least one internship experience before they graduate, and Bucknell's deep career network is here to connect you with employers in fields you're interested in. With this practical career experience and the in-depth quantitative skills you'll gain in your major, you'll be prepared to follow whatever path you choose.\n\nLearn more about internships on campus and beyond\n\nPre-calculus Requirement and Calculus Placement\n\nTo ease the transition to mathematics at Bucknell, all MATH 201 students are required to complete an online preparation course. Students are encouraged to complete this course the summer before enrollment.\n\nMore information about the course\n\nA student's high school calculus experience, calculus credits obtained from the Advanced Placement Examination and calculus credits obtained from another college will form the basis of credit given and calculus placement."
