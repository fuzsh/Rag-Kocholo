        "text": "This program offers an efficient, practice-oriented track to prepare students for quantitative careers in the financial industry, including banks, insurance companies, and investment and securities firms. The program gives students a solid background and sufficient breadth in the mathematical and statistical foundations needed to understand the cutting edge techniques of today and to keep up with future developments in this rapidly evolving area over the span of their careers. It also equips students with expertise in quantitative financial modeling and the computational methods and skills that are used to implement the models. The mathematical knowledge is complemented by studies in financial management, information technology and/or computer science.\n\nThe bridge from the academic environment to the professional workplace is provided by a professional master’s project that involves the solution of a concrete, real-world problem directly originating in the financial industry. Students are encouraged to complete summer internships at financial firms. The department may help students to find suitable financial internships through the industrial connections of faculty affiliated with the Center for Industrial Mathematics and Statistics. Graduates of the program are expected to start or advance their professional careers in such areas as financial product development and pricing, risk management, investment decision support and portfolio management.\n\nDegree Requirements\n\nThe master’s program in Financial Mathematics requires a minimum of 30 credit-hours of coursework. Additional credit from coursework may be required by the department depending on the student’s background. The curriculum consists of the following components:"
