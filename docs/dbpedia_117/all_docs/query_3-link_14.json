        "text": "Not all stocks will yield a dividend, thus creates risk management in how to invest towards a financial future. With compound interest on stocks this can accelerate the growth of savings towards retirement. However, this is where risk management comes into play while investing. The stock market changes at a constant rate. Companies change its dividend yield to suit their own financial goals. Thus, an investor could choose a stock because it had a high dividend yield that happened either monthly, quarterly, or annually at {eq}x\\% {/eq}, but a company can re-evaluate its overall profits and determine if they are reaching their own financial goals or not and change its dividend yield that their stakeholders may receive.\n\nCriticisms of Finance Mathematics\n\nA flaw with financial mathematics would be when, for example, average investors make financial decisions but do not understand the underlying concepts of the market. A great example would be companies paying shareholders a high dividend yield quarterly, that may mean that the company itself is going through a fall back with their profit margin. Thus, create an enticing dividend yield to have more buyers into their company. Young investors, whom are looking for a quick financial boost will falter most with this mentality, if proper research is not done.\n\nDay trading by many investors also creates a volatile stock market, especially for those whom are seeking long-term financial growth. With new fractional share applications that provide an opportunity for more people to become investors has had both pros and cons. Tie this into influence from social media can potentially create certain companies/stocks to become volatile. If something is trending, then there is a large possibility that day traders will buy into a stock to increase its value and then quickly withdraw their investments. This then creates the stock itself to become volatile, compared to the rest of the stock market. With this type of trading, this then creates huge risks within financial mathematics.\n\nDependent on the type of investment that an individual/investor is seeking for financial freedom will depend on a type of account that is chosen. Determining short term and long term goals will help new investors is the best avenue for their financial future. Below will be examples of the three different types of accounts that may be considered. Each will be broken down to help with understanding what best suits individuals needs.\n\nSimple Interest\n\nSimple interest is best used for short term investments. Over time simple interest will not create the largest overall return if looking in terms of financial growth towards retirement. Looking at simple interest in terms of a financial institution, such as a bank, it uses the simple interest formula for savings accounts. The simple interest formula is represented as: $$A=P(1+rt); $$ where {eq}P {/eq} represents the principal of the account. This value represents the value that will be invested into the account. Each financial institution then sets a rate for their savings accounts, which is represented as {eq}r {/eq} in the form of a decimal, over a set amount of time, {eq}t {/eq}.\n\nLets say a parent wants to open a savings account for their 15 year old, whom had just started working a part-time job. The parent decides to go to their bank and determine if opening such account will benefit their child. A bank associate will ask how much the child would like to invest into the account. This will be the principal. Since this child had been working for almost six months, they have accumulated {eq}$600 {/eq} to open an account. The bank associate then is able to provide that they were having a special for opening new accounts and were offering a {eq}2\\% {/eq} interest rate. What both parent and child wanted to learn was how much will be in the account once the child turns 18. Using the above formula, the given information is {eq}P=600, r=0.02 {/eq} and {eq}t=3 {/eq}. Substituting these values into the formula would look like:$$A=600(1+0.02\\cdot3) $$\n\n$$A=600(1+0.06) $$\n\n$$A=600(1.06) $$\n\n$$A=636 $$\n\nOver a three year period, the initial principal will earn {eq}\\$36 {/eq} per three-years. An average of {eq}\\$12 {/eq} per year. This demonstrates that simple interest is in fact simple. A larger return on a small principal will not come from a simple interest account.\n\nCompound Interest\n\nCompound interest is a type of account that a set amount of interest that will be paid to the investor over a set amount of time as capital. This capital can then be used to be reinvested in the same way that was originally determined. Compound interest varies in comparison to the simple interest formula. The formula below is used for compound interest: $$A=P(1+\\frac{r}{n})^{nt} $$\n\nSimilar to simple interest, {eq}P, r {/eq} and {eq}t {/eq} represent the principal (amount invested), rate (as a decimal), and time (in years). The added difference to simple interest to compound interest is {eq}n {/eq}, which represents the times per year the interest is compounded.\n\nUsing the same example of mother and child and instead of a simple interest account, the consideration of a compound interest account. Knowing the previous information {eq}P=600, r=0.02 {/eq} and {eq}t=3 {/eq}, and now need to factor in {eq}n=12 {/eq}, which demonstrates the account is compounded monthly. Applying all these values into the formula will follow below: $$A=600(1+\\frac{0.02}{12})^{12\\cdot3} $$\n\n$$A=637.07 $$\n\nWith this account, the compound interest formula shows that the account will have {eq}\\$637.07 {/eq} after three years. This may not show a major difference between this and a simple interest account. The bigger differential is time. If this savings account was open for 20 years, then the account would have {eq}\\$894.80 {/eq} versus {eq}\\$840.00 {/eq} in a simple interest account. When investing, its best to look at long term financial growth versus short term growth.\n\nContinuously Compounding Interest\n\nConsidering continuously compounding interest accounts will factor into overall long term financial growth. Continuously compounding over time will build the largest return and growth on the original principal invested. The continuously compounding interest formula varies slightly from both simple interest and compound interest. Below is the continuously compounding interest formula: $$A=Pe^{rt} $$\n\nThe value {eq}e {/eq} is Euler's number which is a numerical constant that is used within this equation. The value of {eq}e\\approx2.718... {/eq}. The other variables {eq}P, r {/eq} and {eq}t {/eq} which represent the principal (amount invested), rate (as a decimal), and time (in years) remain the same as simple interest and compound interest.\n\nLets use the same mother and child whom want to invest the {eq}\\$600 {/eq} with a continuously compounding interest account. Appropriately substituting the values into the formula will result as the following: $$A=600e^{0.02\\cdot3} $$\n\n$$A=637.10 $$\n\nDue to the short term investment that the mother and child were seeking, it does demonstrate a {eq}\\$0.03 {/eq} difference between that and compound interest. Now if compared over a 20 year timeframe, the account would be {eq}\\$895.09 {/eq}."
