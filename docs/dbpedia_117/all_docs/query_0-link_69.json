        "text": "The computational and mathematical finance concentration combines financial theory with a solid grounding in quantitative methods, as you will model and analyze the complexity of financial decisions under uncertainty.\n\nWhere the Computational & Mathematical Finance Concentration Takes You\n\nIt’s a great path for those interested in careers as financial actuaries and analysts and in fields such as risk management, asset management, trading, investment banking, commercial banking, corporate finance consulting, and strategic planning.\n\nWhat You Will Study in Your Computational & Mathematical Finance\n\nThis concentration blends the best of Babson’s curriculum, with strong foundations in the business world, financial math competencies, and the liberal arts and sciences. Advanced computational finance courses are designed to provide in-depth knowledge of financial markets and instruments, while advanced math and science courses emphasize mathematical derivations, rigorous analytical thinking, financial mathematics for actuaries, state-of-the-art software tools, and building statistical, machine learning, simulation, and optimization models.\n\nOur concentrations are designed to help you specialize and explore within our bachelor's in business administration degree. The courses offered are comparable to what you will find in a computational finance major or minor, as well as in other computer finance programs, including a bachelor’s of science in computational finance and a quantitative finance bachelor’s degree.\n\nRequired Courses"
