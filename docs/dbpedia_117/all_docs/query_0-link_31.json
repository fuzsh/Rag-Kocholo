        "text": "The mathematical finance group includes probabilists and stochastic analysts working in problems directly motivated and/or applicable to finance and economics, or supervising PhD students working in those problems. From mathematical side, the members’ specialized research areas include stochastic differential equations (both forward and backward, both ordinary and partial), their related areas such as stochastic control and stochastic filtering, stochastic numerics, and statistics. From the finance/economics side, several research topics include, but are not limited to: option pricing and hedging theory; financial markets with frictions (including transaction cost, liquidity cost, credit risk, and model uncertainty); utility optimization theory with portfolio/consumption control, and contract theory.\n\nThe faculty members in the group are also responsible for teaching and advising graduate students at both Master and Ph.D. levels. The Master program of mathematical finance at USC College, a joint venture of Mathematics department and Economics department, prepares students a careers in the quantitative finance industry. Many members of the group have been responsible for teaching courses in the program, and advising Ph.D. students specializing in mathematical finance. The biweekly Mathematical Finance Colloquium brings in experts from both academia and financial industry, providing valuable contacts and opportunities for graduate students.\n\nREGULAR
