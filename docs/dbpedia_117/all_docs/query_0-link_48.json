        "text": "Our Program\n\nAt Johns Hopkins, Financial Mathematics continues a rich engineering tradition whereby the strengths of the faculty in research, education, and leadership are applied to expand knowledge and apply new knowledge for the benefit of humanity by addressing the complex problems of modern society. Understanding and navigating today’s rapidly evolving, world-wide economic and financial landscape presents one of society’s most challenging current problems.\n\nThe Field of Financial Mathematics\n\nFinancial Mathematics (commonly described using an array of roughly synonymous alternative titles including Financial Engineering, Computational Finance, Mathematical Finance, and Quantitative Finance) is an engineering discipline fundamentally enabled by the intellectual pursuits spanned by the faculty of Applied Mathematics and Statistics (AMS): probability, statistics, optimization, partial differential equations and scientific computing.\n\nThe unifying premise for Financial Mathematics is more than just a collection of techniques applied to a common problem area. Rather, it quantifies and enables much of the modern interplay in global markets among companies, investors, and financial agents; constrained or constructed by the actions of central banks, regulators and governments. Global financial agents, which include broker-dealers on Wall Street, in London, Hong Kong and elsewhere, create and package (or repackage) capital products and services into the instruments that are so vital to the course of world-wide capital allocation, investment, and risk transfer. None of this could occur today without the sophisticated approaches enabled by financial mathematics which have evolved over the past 25 years."
