        "text": "You will develop skills to formulate mathematical problems that are based on the needs of the financial industry. You will carry out relevant mathematical and financial analysis, develop and implement appropriate tools to present and interpret model results.\n\nThe course lays the foundation for further research in academia or for a career as a quantitative analyst in a financial or other institution.\n\nStructure and content\n\nTerm one\n\nYou will take four introductory courses in the first week. The introductory courses cover partial differential equations, probability and statistics, financial markets and instruments, and Python.\n\nThe first term will then focus on compulsory core material, offering 64 hours of lectures and 24 hours of classes, plus one compulsory computing course offering 16 hours of lectures.\n\nCore courses\n\nStochastic Calculus (16 lectures, and 4 classes of 1.5 hours each)\n\nFinancial Derivatives (16 lectures, and 4 classes of 1.5 hours each)\n\nNumerical Methods (16 lectures, and 4 classes of 1.5 hours each)\n\nStatistics and Financial Data Analysis (16 lectures, and 4 classes of 1.5 hours each)\n\nComputing course\n\nFinancial computing with C++ I (16 hours of lectures, plus 4 classes of 2 hours each over weeks 1-9)\n\nTerm two\n\nThe second term will be a combination of core material, offering 48 hours of lectures (18 hours of classes) and 48 hours of electives.\n\nCore courses\n\nDeep Learning (16 lectures, and 4 classes of 1.5 hours each)\n\nQuantitative Risk Management (8 lectures, and 2 classes of 1.5 hours each)\n\nStochastic Control (8 lectures, and 2 classes of 1.5 hours each)\n\nFixed Income (16 lectures, and 4 classes of 1.5 hours each)\n\nElective courses\n\nA number of elective courses will be offered, of which you will choose four options. Courses usually offered include:\n\nAdvanced Volatility Modelling (8 lectures, and 2 classes of 1.5 hours each)\n\nAdvanced Monte Carlo Methods (8 lectures, and 2 classes of 1.5 hours each)\n\nAdvanced Topics in Computational Finance (8 lectures, and 2 classes of 1.5 hours each)\n\nAsset Pricing (8 lectures, and 2 classes of 1.5 hours each)\n\nMarket Microstructure and Algorithmic Trading (8 lectures, and 2 classes of 1.5 hours each)\n\nDecentralised Finance (8 lectures, and 2 classes of 1.5 hours each)\n\nComputing course\n\nFinancial computing with C++ II (24 hours of lectures and classes)\n\nTerm three\n\nThe third term is mainly dedicated to a dissertation project which is to be written on a topic chosen in consultation with your supervisor. This may be prepared in conjunction with an industry internship.\n\nAttendance\n\nThe course is full-time and requires attendance in Oxford. Full-time students are subject to the University's Residence requirements.\n\nResources to support your study\n\n[A standard introductory paragraph will appear here to signpost information about the Bodleian libraries and digital resources. It will also mention standard IT facilities such as email and Eduroam access. The text below should not repeat this information, but it should mention any subject-specific libraries and specialist equipment that are available to students on this course.]\n\nIn addition to the University-wide resources described above, the course-specific resources described below are available to support your study on this course.\n\nThe Mathematical Institute's home is the purpose-built Andrew Wiles Building, opened in 2013. This provides ample teaching facilities for lectures, classes and seminars. The Mathematical Institute provides IT support, and students can use the department's Whitehead Library, with an extensive range of books and journals.\n\nIn addition to the common room, where graduate students regularly gather for coffee and other social occasions, there is also a café in the Andrew Wiles Building.\n\nSupervision\n\nThe allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Mathematical Institute and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Mathematical Institute.\n\nYou will be assigned an initial supervisor on arrival in Oxford whose role is to act as an academic advisor during the first two terms of the course. In the third term, your supervisor will usually change when you start work on your dissertation.\n\nAssessment\n\nThe examination will consist of the following elements:\n\nThree written examinations assessing the core material in the first and second terms\n\nOne written examination assessing elective material in the second term\n\nTwo projects assessing one of the core courses in the first term and one of the core courses in the second term\n\nTwo practical examinations assessing two courses in financial computing with C++\n\nOne dissertation in the third term.\n\nGraduate destinations\n\nMSc graduates have been recruited by prominent investment banks and hedge funds. Many past students have also progressed to PhD-level studies at leading universities in Europe and elsewhere.\n\nChanges to this course and your supervision\n\nThe University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page. However, there may be situations in which it is desirable or necessary for the University to make changes in course provision, either before or after registration. The safety of students, staff and visitors is paramount and major changes to delivery or services may have to be made in circumstances of a pandemic, epidemic or local health emergency. In addition, in certain circumstances, for example due to visa difficulties or because the health needs of students cannot be met, it may be necessary to make adjustments to course requirements for international study.\n\nWhere possible your academic supervisor will not change for the duration of your course. However, it may be necessary to assign a new academic supervisor during the course of study or before registration for reasons which might include illness, sabbatical leave, parental leave or change in employment.\n\nFor further information please see our page on changes to courses and the provisions of the student contract regarding changes to courses.\n\nEntry requirements for entry in 2025-26\n\nProven and potential academic excellence\n\nThe requirements described below are specific to this course and apply only in the year of entry that is shown.
