        "text": "The M.S. in Statistics with Specialization in Computational Finance (MS CF) is a highly interdisciplinary program involving course offerings from different academic departments. The goal of the program is to equip students with the tools necessary to pursue a career in a quantitative financial field. The 2-year course work provides students with comprehensive and practical knowledge of the mathematical, statistical, and computational skills needed for the creation, implementation, and evaluation of the models and products used by the financial sector to manage risk and develop investment strategies. Internship, career fairs, and recruiting programs at Purdue provide students with great opportunities before and upon graduation.\n\nEmployment Perspectives\n\nCourse Work\n\nCourse Requirements\n\nPh.D. in Statistics with research emphasis on applications to finance\n\nRelated Links\n\nHow to Apply\n\nEmployment Perspectives\n\nQuantitative and computational finance is a field with enormous impact, and excellent employment opportunities. The MS CF program is designed to prepare students for a wide range of careers both inside and outside the financial industry. Companies recruiting our graduates include:\n\nInvestment banks and trading companies\n\nAsset management firms and pension funds\n\nInsurance companies\n\nFinancial software and consulting firms\n\nEnergy companies\n\nExpanding alumni network with top students landing jobs on Wall Street, in Chicago, and other important financial centers. Sample positions: equity trading -”Quant”, quantitative analyst, mathematical finance modeler, fixed-income researcher, investment consultant, risk analyst, and financial product design.\n\nCourse work\n\nThe core courses in the MS CF program go beyond the generalities of financial models and products, and provide a thorough understanding on the quantitative aspects of\n\nArbitrage pricing of derivatives in equity, fixed income, and credit markets\n\nPortfolio management and CAPM\n\nKey financial algorithms of option pricing, optimization, simulation, and calibration (with programming in C++, C#, MATLAB, and VBA)\n\nStatistical methodologies including Multivariate Data and Time Series Analysis with computational experience in SAS and R\n\nElective courses offered by Krannert School of Business complement the curriculum with a more pragmatic general approach of the products and daily practices of the market. Elective courses include Options and Futures, Portfolio Management, Risk Management, and Econometrics.\n\nCourse Requirements\n\nThe requirements for the Master's degree in Statistics with specialization in Computational Finance are typically completed in two intensive years. The resulting MS Statistics degree includes additional courses in mathematical and investment finance, and computational science.\n\nThe courses comprising the 34 required credits for the Master's degree in statistics with emphasis in computational finance are divided into three groups.\n\nRequired Stat Courses (15 cr.)\n\nProbability STAT 51900 Mathematical Statistics STAT 52800 Time Series STAT 52000 Intermediate Statistical Methodology STAT 52500 Advanced Statistical Methodology STAT 52600\n\nRequired Core Computational Finance courses. (16 cr.)\n\nMathematics of Finance (STAT 54000)\n\nAdv. Probability, Options, and Num. Methods (STAT 54100)\n\nSimulation Design and Analysis (IE 58100) or Introduction to Computational Statistics (STAT 545)\n\n7 or more credit hours approved by the CF committee from the following list:\n\nOptions and Futures MGMT 64100 (2 cr.) Security Analysis MGMT 64200 (2 cr.) Financial Risk Management MGMT 64300 (2 cr.) Portfolio Management MGMT 61400 (2 cr.) Spreadsheet Modeling and Simulation MGMT 690S/57000 (2 cr.) Seminar in Financial Markets MGMT 61600 (3 cr.) Seminar in Financial Markets MGMT 61700 (3 cr.) Design and Analysis of Financial Algorithms STAT 598W (3 cr.) Venture Capital And Investment Banking MGMT 64400 (2 cr.) Financial Management I MGMT 61000 (3 cr.) Financial Modeling with Jump Processes STAT 598F (3 cr.) Financial Time Series STAT 598K (3 cr.)\n\nThe policy for taking Krannert classes is currently being revised. For the time being, visit RAWLS 2021 for more information concerning Krannert classes.\n\nElective courses (3 cr.)\n\n3 or more credit hours of courses related to CF and approved by the CF committee. These can be courses from any department or school. The CF advisor will help students make a selection.\n\nPossible departments to choose from include:\n\nManagement, Finance, Economics, Statistics, Computer Science, Agricultural Economics & Industrial Engineering\n\nPossible topics include:\n\nadvanced finance seminar\n\nportfolio management\n\nsecurity analysis\n\ninternational monetary problems\n\nfinancial time series\n\nBayesian statistics in finance\n\nMonte-Carlo methods\n\nNote: Other courses approved by the Statistics Department Graduate Committee can be substituted for courses that have been taken previously. The final transcript should include at least five statistics courses aside from the STAT courses in Group II.\n\nA typical degree plan for the MS degree in Statistics with CF specialization will look like this:\n\nSTAT 51900\n\nSTAT 52800\n\nMGMT 64100\n\nSTAT 54000\n\nIE 58100\n\nSTAT 52000\n\nSTAT 54100\n\nECON 67300 or ECON 53500 or ECON 60800\n\nSTAT 52500\n\nMGMT 64300\n\nSTAT 52600\n\nPh.D. in Statistics with research emphasis on applications to finance\n\nThe Department of Statistics offers the Ph.D. for original research in probability or statistics. The research emphasis may be directed toward applications in finance with the concurrence of the major professor. See the description of the Department of Statistics Ph.D. Program. Professor F. G. Viens may be contacted for more details.\n\nRelated Links"
