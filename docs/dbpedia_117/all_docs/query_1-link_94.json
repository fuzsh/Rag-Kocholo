        "text": "If youâre a problem solver, have great math skills and a keen interest in financial markets, youâll thrive in Mathematical and Computational Finance, a field where these skills and interests intersect. Mathematical finance analysts apply their knowledge of mathematics, statistics, probability and financial theory to assess market forces and minimize risk and maximize profitability.\n\nAs a student, youâll study mathematics, statistics, probability, economics and computer science along with finance and management at the John Molson School of Business. Specialized courses in Mathematical and Computational Finance will give you many opportunities to practise applying mathematics to finance.\n\nYou will also:\n\nLearn the computational and modelling techniques used to price tradable assets such as bonds, securities, loans, energy and associated derivatives\n\nLearn to create, model, price, hedge and trade innovative financial products\n\nDevelop an analytical and strategic eye for managing the risk associated with complex financial transactions\n\nThis program is designed for students who wish to begin a career in quantitative finance after graduation, or those who plan to pursue graduate studies in financial engineering or mathematical finance."
