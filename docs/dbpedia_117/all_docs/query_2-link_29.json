        "text": "ACADEMIC INTEGRITY\n\nAll members of the MS in Mathematics in Finance community—including students, faculty, fellows, graders, and administrators—are expected to uphold the highest standards of academic integrity. This is a shared responsibility that we must maintain together.\n\nGiven the nature of the financial industry, and its interview-focused hiring process, learning and strengthening your skills are more important than earning the highest grade. Plainly, the consequences of cheating are serious for all parties involved, including the Mathematics in Finance program as a whole.\n\nIn the event that an infraction occurs, course instructors are required to notify both the suspected student and program leadership within two days of learning of the infraction. Program leadership will meet with the student to discuss the incident and decide on a penalty, which they will share with the Vice Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Science. All disciplinary actions must be taken in accordance with the policies of GSAS. Students must also be made aware of their right to appeal the decision as outlined in the GSAS policy document.\n\nPOLICY\n\nStudents will ensure that the rules set forth by each instructor are followed for each class. Rules such as the use of outside resources, common write-ups, and code sharing should be followed as outlined by each instructor.\n\nStudents are required to immediately report cheating incidents they observe to the program administrator or to a faculty member. In addition, they should report situations that encourage cheating, such as extreme workloads, graders or instructors who tolerate or do not detect obvious cheating, or improperly supervised exams.\n\nDuring an exam, students may not communicate in any way, nor use any materials or technology not explicitly permitted by the instructor, other than pens and pencils. No cell phone or other electronic devices may be used during the exam; they should be stored away. Students may not look at each other’s tests during the exam.\n\nA student caught cheating on an assignment may have their grade for the class reduced by one letter on the first offense and their grade reduced to an F on the second offense. Cheating on an exam will immediately result in an F for the class. Repeated offenses or offenses in multiple classes may result in more serious penalties including expulsion from the program.\n\nStudents are not allowed to record (photography, audio, and/or video) any lectures, seminars, or other school activities or sessions without written permission of the instructor(s).\n\nStudents are not permitted to share course materials outside of class without written permission of the instructor(s).\n\nAll University students are expected to be aware of and to adhere to, the standards set forth in the following policies listed on NYU’s Overview of Student Conduct Policies Page."
