        "text": "Welcome to the Mathematical Finance Program.\n\nThe Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Texas Tech University offers MS and PhD training in mathematical finance (MF; also referred to as financial mathematics or quantitative finance). MF is the area of finance in which intricate mathematical models are used to predict markets, set prices, enhance returns, and manage risk. MF professionals are known as quantitative analysts (“quants”).\n\nQuants “are the intellectual elite of finance. They’re in demand, and their salaries reflect that. Becoming one of them requires a unique mix of mathematics, finance, and computational skills.” Christa Terry, Noodle.com."
