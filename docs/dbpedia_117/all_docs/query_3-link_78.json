Statistical knowledge helps to choose the proper method of collecting the data and employ those samples in the correct analysis process in order to effectively produce the results. In short, statistics is a crucial process which helps to make the decision based on the data.\n\nWhat is Statistics in Maths?\n\nIn Mathematics, statistics concerns the collection of data, organisation, interpretation, analysis and data presentation. The main purpose of using statistics is to plan the collected data in terms of experimental designs and statistical surveys. Statistics is considered a mathematical science that works with numerical data. In short, statistics is a crucial process which helps to make the decision based on the data.\n\nStatistics for Class 10\n\nStatistics for Class 11\n\nPopulation and Sample\n\nSample Size\n\nCategorical Data\n\nStatistics Example\n\nAn example of statistical analysis is when we have to determine the number of people in a town who watch TV out of the total population in the town. The small group of people is called the sample here, which is taken from the population.\n\nTypes of Statistics\n\nThe two main branches of statistics are:\n\nDescriptive Statistics\n\nInferential Statistics\n\nDescriptive Statistics – Through graphs or tables, or numerical calculations, descriptive statistics uses the data to provide descriptions of the population.\n\nInferential Statistics – Based on the data sample taken from the population, inferential statistics makes the predictions and inferences.\n\nBoth types of statistics are equally employed in the field of statistical analysis. Learn in detail descriptive and inferential statistics here at BYJU’S.\n\nCharacteristics of Statistics\n\nThe important characteristics of Statistics are as follows:\n\nStatistics are numerically expressed.\n\nIt has an aggregate of facts\n\nData are collected in systematic order\n\nIt should be comparable to each other\n\nData are collected for a planned purpose\n\nImportance of Statistics\n\nThe important functions of statistics are:\n\nStatistics helps in gathering information about the appropriate quantitative data\n\nIt depicts the complex data in graphical form, tabular form and in diagrammatic representation to understand it easily\n\nIt provides the exact description and a better understanding\n\nIt helps in designing the effective and proper planning of the statistical inquiry in any field\n\nIt gives valid inferences with the reliability measures about the population parameters from the sample data\n\nIt helps to understand the variability pattern through the quantitative observations\n\nTo learn more about Statistical terms and formulas, register with BYJU’S – The Learning App today."
