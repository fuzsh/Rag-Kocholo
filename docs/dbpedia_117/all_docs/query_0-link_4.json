        "text": "Hi,\n\nMy long-term aspirations are in quantitative finance, specifically more trading and analysis rather than development. Though admittedly I only became interested in the field late last year because it seemed to be much more of a challenge than other forms of financial trading and analysis. Also, seems to be where things are headed long-term.\n\nApologies if similar questions have been asked and answered as nauseam. I've just graduated from the Open University here in the UK with a BA (Hons) in Politics, Philosophy and Economics. Terrible degree to get into quant finance of course.\n\nI've enrolled on to the CFA. I've been self-learning further maths (my aim is to self-learn undergraduate level and eventually postgraduate level since I've got an A-Level/High school), econometrics (which I have a good grasp of since I specialised in Economics in my degree), data science and stats with help. I've also been learning python for a few months now, and am hoping to then move on to C++ soon. I hope to then do a few of my own side-projects and hopefully collaborate on some.\n\nI currently work in the financial services industry but more in wealth management and to some extent asset management.\n\nI will be doing an MSc starting in 2021, but I have no idea which is more relevant and effective to break into the industry and to learn the relevant knowledge. I have a choice between two, since I can only do distance learning:\n\nMSc Mathematical Finance at University of York:\n\nhttps://www.york.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-taught/courses/msc-mathematical-finance-online/\n\nOr\n\nMSc Statistics at University of Sheffield:\n\nhttps://www.sheffield.ac.uk/maths/prospectivepg/taughtpg/statistics\n\nI can't do the MSc Statistics with Financial Mathematics at Sheffield because I don't have an undergraduate in maths.\n\nMy questions are: which MSc is better for knowledge and to break in to the industry given my background? Also, is there anything else I can do to boost my chances to break into the industry or is it just a matter of learning? (Quantopian is awesome)\n\nApologies for the long post, and I appreciate it!"
