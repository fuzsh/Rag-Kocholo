        "text": "Hi, my name is Uran. I have taught at the university level on diverse topics such as Corporate Finance, Managerial Economics, Business Statistics, Introduction to Statistics, and Mathematical Statistics to graduate students who are not Statistics majors.\n\nI have a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering, an M.B.A., an A.B.D. in Finance, and a M.S. and Phd degree in Statistics. I also am currently pursuing a Computer Science degree. Hopefully, I will be done soon. I have tutored mathematics, statistics and\n\nprobability, electronics, financial accounting and ethics for student solutions nearby California State University at Northridge, and another tutoring organization near Oregon State University at Corvallis. I tutored for Equal Education Opportunity program\n\nat Oregon State University as well. Sometimes, I have to work with math-challenged students or students with learning disability (such as aural or visual dyslexia). I am generally very patient. I do not get frustrated. I break down each concept into easier-to-understand\n\ncomponent steps. I try to use visual or symbolic approaches if more conventional approaches fail. Analogies can also be helpful. Following are two examples of my teaching style on two sets of concepts: Example 1: Suppose a student is trying to solve the following\n\nhypothetical problem. Suppose x + 3 > 4 is the proposition. Student is tasked to identify the range of values of x that satisfy the above inequality. Since x can stand for any real number, we can try to let x = 0 and see if 0 + 3 > 4 is true. It is not, and\n\ntherefore the mathematical sentence x + 3 > 4 would not allow x to take on the value 0. 0 is out of our consideration. If x is even less than 0, then since x < 0, x + 3 < 0 + 3 (since x started out to be less than 0, three greater than x is going to be less\n\nthan 3 greater than 0, or x + 3 < 0 + 3 = 3). If x + 3 < 3, then it cannot be greater than 4, and therefore, any number less than 0 is also not going to be such that"
