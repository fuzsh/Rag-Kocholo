        "text": "The Department of Mathematics jointly with Department of Statistics at Columbia University offers a track of its Master of Arts in Mathematics with specialization in the Mathematics of Finance. The program draws on the diverse strengths of Columbia in stochastic processes, numerical methods, and Finance.\n\nThe Program\n\nThe instructional component of the program consists of ten courses, which can be taken over two or three semesters of full-time course work. Six of these courses are required. The remaining four elective courses are selected from a broad menu of approved courses. All required courses are offered after 6:00 PM to allow part-time students who work during the day access.\n\nThe program is oriented towards students with degrees in the Mathematics, Physics, and Engineering Science who wish to develop strong analytic skill in preparation for a career in finance.\n\nFirms such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, J.P. Morgan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, UBS, Credit Suisse, Barclays Capital, Deloitte Consulting, Ernst & Young, Societe Generale, Credit Agricole CIB, various hedge funds and asset management firms, and many others have recruited graduates of the program.\n\nThe program includes training in:\n\nProbability and Random Processes\n\nStatistics\n\nPartial Differential Equations\n\nModern Financial Markets and their Basic Instruments\n\nValuation and Hedging Techniques\n\nMethods of Computation and Simulation\n\nProgram Director: Professor Lars Tyge Nielsen"
