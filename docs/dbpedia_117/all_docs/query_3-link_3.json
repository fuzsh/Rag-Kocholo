        "text": "To be honest this question isn't really within scope of QuantFinance because it is borderline opinion based but I will contribute an answer to the community regardless.\n\nIf you cannot determine the difference between stats and ML then you might consider that you do not understand the uses and methods used within each relevant discipline and may have to do more research, before being successful in an interview.\n\nStatistics covers the mathematics of sampling and distributions of data. Hypothesis testing, simple probability and common distributions are so basic that you will rely on these constantly as a quant. I suggest you make every effort to remember your studies.\n\nML covers the variety of model techniques, and model fitting techniques, used to solve supervised or unsupervised problems, i.e. you have input data and you want to predict output data or perform some analysis on that data. That analysis may be statistical or it may be algorithmic. For example K-means clustering is not a \"statistical technique\", it is an algorithm.\n\nIn broad, ML and statistics belong to data science. In a mean way, ML can be considered to be statistical models for prediction/classification problems. In machine learning, you will learn to deal with models like decision tree, svm, neural network, etc. When you apply these models to a particular problem, you will use basic statistical terms to evaluate the performance of models. What you learned prob&stats at college is essential to understand machine learning. You only need to learn a good course in machine learning, and I will suggest you to take the course of Prof. Andrew Ng. on Coursera. happy learning!"
