Any recommendations for programs that excel in this aspect?\n\nWhat general advice can you offer for navigating this decision and maximizing my chances of success in the quantitative finance field?\n\nI'm eager to hear your insights and recommendations to make the most informed choice for my future career path.\n\nMy interest in this discussion is for the UK programs ranking purpose. It seems to be the line between a traditional MFE/Math Fin programs vs Finance programs are not that clear in the UK.\n\nMy goal would be to have a similar ranking like we do with the US MFE programs here. But first, I need some filtering of all the programs there in the UK.\n\nFor ranking of UK programs, could we include Cambridge Math (Part III) as well? Among the world's most rigorous math programs (and it's just 9 month long). Might be too broad though compared to focused MFE curricula.\n\ninteresting. @quanthopefully - just curious as I never heard anyone mention about ucl mcf. curious how’s the course, placements or stats apart from the number on risk.net.\n\nIt has a summer placement and they have partnership with some fintechs, hedge funds, and banks like HSBC and JPM. I also know that the managing director for eFX at HSBC is a guest lecturer on one of the modules. Imperial MathFin also have similar partnerships. Oxford doesnt but its only 9 months so the summer is free for an internship and of course they have a great name and one of the best research groups in quant finance (oxford man institute).\n\nThats why I would put these 3 in tier 1 and in that order. Tier 2 would be the ones I suggest above, plus maybe UCL FinMath, Warwick MathFin. They don't have the industry partnerships or a weaker brand name or have a weaker curriculum but could still get you interviews. Tier 3 would be the various programs at Kings, Cass and Birmingham. Decent programs but with a weaker brand name and not known as target schools so wouldn't get you as many top interviews. The mathematical finance programs in general tend to be too weak in programming in my opinion and more focused on sell side derivative pricing.\n\nNote I haven't included any mathematical, statistical or CS/ML based programs, which if taken at any target school, could also be viable for quant interviews.\n\nIt has a summer placement and they have partnership with some fintechs, hedge funds, and banks like HSBC and JPM.

But I think UCL doesn’t have good placements and doesn’t imperial RMFE also have the same career services and placements with banks?\n\nThanks for sharing this. But I think UCL doesn’t have good placements and doesn’t imperial RMFE also have the same career services and placements with banks?\n\nAs I said its just my opinion from my own research. You can view alumni on LinkedIn yourself but I have seen many who did placements at HSBC and JPM for example.\n\nRMFE does not provide industry placements through the program AFAIK, you need to find one yourself.\n\nalso curious on this. Also, I would like to ask how realistic it is to apply for Msc MCF @Oxford with an undergrad in International Business from Denmark (only maths in terms of corporate finance, microeconomics, macroeconomics, industrial organisation, etc.). However, < top 5% of my cohort.\n\nIf necessary, would it be sufficient to study maths in my leisure time, or do I need credit for these subjects as well?\n\nwell CMU MSCF has 18% from a busines/finance background, second biggest in their class profile. 15% from IS/CS background. It’s one of the hardest to enter and best programmes IMO\n\nIt’s been historically this way. More finance and business majors seem to be populating the field.\n\nClass Profile - Master of Science in Computational Finance - Carnegie Mellon University\n\nquantitative finance, class profile, quant finance, computational finance, class size, majors, experience, GMAT, GRE, degrees, diversity\n\nI've seen many mentions of Cambridge Part III when I asked about master quant programs in UK. From what I can see, it's a purely mathematical course which does not provide any quant-related courses.\n\nIs its reputation as a rigorous math course enough of the requirement for their graduates to compete with those from Imperial and the likes?\n\nAnyone care to enlighten me a bit more?\n\nFrom my limited research on it here’s what I know:\n\nThere are 3 concentration areas -\n\n1. Pure math\n\n2. Applied math (mostly physics)\n\n3. Mathematical statistics\n\nI’ve seen people on linkedin from the mathematical statistics concentration that work in quant trading/research\n\nThe program is short (around 9 months iirc) and the entire time is meant to be spent studying math so it may be difficult to find time to prepare for interviews and network\n\nTo my understanding this program is great for those who want to pursue a phd in a quantitative field, but be warned that achieving distinction is incredibly difficult because you are competing against some of the best math students in the world.\n\nAnybody feel free to correct me if I got something wrong.\n\nI've seen many mentions of Cambridge Part III when I asked about master quant programs in UK.

In fact, both Imperial MF and Oxford MCF are under math department whereas US MFE programmes are generally under business school or taught jointly by several department so they admit students majoring other subjects as there are many available units that are not too math demanding. In that sense Cambridge part iii provides very rigorous mathematical training and has a formidable reputation in the Europe (I heard even Oxford MCF research group gives preference to part iii students for PhD than their own master students).\n\nIn other words, even in the US, quant jobs probably won't refuse math students from schools like Princeton or MIT, as these companies are seeking for smart brains to profit. So part iii is not like a typical MFE programme but students who can succeed in such programme surely prove they qualify for a quant job."
