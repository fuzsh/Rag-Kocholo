        "text": "A degree in financial mathematics and statistics offers the challenge of combining the study of financial analysis and economic theory with probability and statistics. Only a few schools in the country offer this unique major, according to UC Santa Barbara. Although the coursework is rigorous, graduating students face a number of potential career opportunities when they enter the job market. The skills obtained while pursuing this degree translate very well to professions in government, finance, marketing and even agriculture.\n\nFinance Careers\n\nA career on Wall Street is definitely a possibility for the graduate with a degree in financial math and statistics, suggests Stony Brook University. Brokerage firms, banks and insurance companies all need individuals who can analyze data, compile forecasts and research financial trends. Graduates with this degree bring with them the statistical knowledge to build risk-forecast models, which allow firms to analyze future investments.\n\nThis knowledge is also helpful in insurance companies that need actuarial information to better design health-care and insurance policies. Additional courses in risk management may help an individual break into these financial management careers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, or BLS, reported in 2020 that actuarians earned median salaries of ​$111,030.​ Financial analysts earned less at ​$83,660​ per year, BLS indicated.\n\nGovernment Careers\n\nAll facets of government employ individuals with a background in finance and statistics for various financial mathematics jobs. Local governments need individuals to budget and utilize city revenues properly and efficiently. At the federal level, graduates may find employment with the Internal Revenue Service, budget committees and the Federal Reserve. Government jobs are in high demand; begin networking and monitor the usajobs.gov website if you'd like to obtain one of these coveted positions. Business and financial operations jobs in federal agencies paid an average salary of ​$90,640​ per year, BLS reported.\n\nMarketing Careers\n\nMarket researchers conduct focus groups, carry out surveys and utilize test markets to collect data. Individuals with degrees in statistics and mathematics are sought out to analyze such marketing data. Job applicants with a major in financial mathematics and statistics offer the ability to bring not only knowledge of how to quantify the data, but also how this data translates into financial information that can help a company make sound decisions. Marketing managers earned median annual salaries of ​$142,170​, according to the BLS in 2020.\n\nOther Career Options\n\nA degree in financial math and statistics should not mean that you are automatically required to dress in a business suit and work on Wall Street. Other financial mathematics career paths can allow you to use your skills outside of the traditional office setting. The field of agriculture needs statisticians to help analyze plant and animal experiments, as well as to interpret the data. Graduates may obtain a master’s degree and a Ph.D. to pursue a career in teaching or research at the university level. The BLS reports that agricultural and food scientists earned a median annual salary of ​$68,830​ in 2020.\n\nReferences"
