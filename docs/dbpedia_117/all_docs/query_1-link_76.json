        "text": "Although there are many books on mathematical finance, few deal with the statistical aspects of modern data analysis as applied to financial problems. This textbook fills this gap by addressing some of the most challenging issues facing financial engineers. It shows how sophisticated mathematics and modern statistical techniques can be used in the solutions of concrete financial problems. Concerns of risk management are addressed by the study of extreme values, the fitting of distributions with heavy tails, the computation of values at risk (VaR), and other measures of risk. Principal component analysis (PCA), smoothing, and regression techniques are applied to the construction of yield and forward curves. Time series analysis is applied to the study of temperature options and nonparametric estimation. Nonlinear filtering is applied to Monte Carlo simulations, option pricing and earnings prediction. This textbook is intended for undergraduate students majoring in financial engineering, or graduate students in a Master in finance or MBA program. It is sprinkled with practical examples using market data, and each chapter ends with exercises. Practical examples are solved in the R computing environment. They illustrate problems occurring in the commodity, energy and weather markets, as well as the fixed income, equity and credit markets. The examples, experiments and problem sets are based on the library Rsafd developed for the purpose of the text. The book should help quantitative analysts learn and implement advanced statistical concepts. Also, it will be valuable for researchers wishing to gain experience with financial data, implement and test mathematical theories, and address practical issues that are often ignored or underestimated in academic curricula.\n\nThis is the new, fully-revised edition to the book Statistical Analysis of Financial Data in S-Plus."
