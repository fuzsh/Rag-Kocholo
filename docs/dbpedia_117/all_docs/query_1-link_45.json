You'll also have the chance to take some units on more theoretical topics, with diverse options such as Quantum Mechanics or Number Theory.\n\nThink Big bursaries of £3,000 are available to support first-year international undergraduate students in this subject area.\n\nAccreditations\n\nOur Mathematics with Statistics for Finance BSc is approved by major professional bodies in the UK (, IMA, RSS) so as a graduate you can gain exemptions from a number of their examinations or credits for prior learning.\n\nThe first year provides a broad background in pure, applied and statistical mathematics via a range of compulsory units. You'll cover material in lectures and small-group tutorials, with the freedom to explore a range of topics in collaboration with your personal tutor and fellow students.\n\nFrom year two you will focus more on units that relate to statistics for use in finance, although there is still scope to take some units from other areas.\n\nAs you move through the course you will gain academic independence, moving from small-group tutorial teaching in year one to an independent project in your final year."
