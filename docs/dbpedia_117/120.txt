About this major

Financial mathematics and statistics is designed to meet the needs of a particularly popular area of employment for our mathematics graduates. Mathematics is the foundation of the financial world. It allows investors, traders and bankers to make optimal decisions and to distribute risk in a rational way. The mathematics behind finance is, however, not simple and relies heavily on ideas from statistics and the mathematical theory of random events.

Financial Mathematics and Statistics will give you a broad introduction to the methods and ideas of mathematical finance and will prepare you for employment in the financial sector or for honours and further study in the field.
