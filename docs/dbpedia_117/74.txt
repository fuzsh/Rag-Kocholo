Mathematical Finance uses tools of mathematics and statistics to understand the dynamics of variability in financial markets. A degree in Mathematical Finance opens up careers in investment banking, risk management, hedge funds, financial analysis, data analysis, actuarial science, insurance, and more. The Department of Mathematics offers a Bachelor of Science in Mathematical Finance. At this time, Catholic University is the only school in the Washington, DC greater metropolitan area that currently offers a major in Mathematical Finance. Coursework for the major is described here. In addition, all mathematics majors must pass the department's comprehensive exam.
