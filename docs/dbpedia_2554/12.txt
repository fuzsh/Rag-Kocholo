Niantic is an American software development company based in San Francisco, who is best known for developing augmented reality mobile games such as Pokémon GO. The company was formed as Niantic Labs in 2010 as an internal startup within Google. The company became an independent entity in October 2015. It has offices in San Francisco, Bellevue, Los Angeles, Sunnyvale, Hong Kong, Tokyo and London.

History[]

Niantic is a company that spun out of Google in October 2015 after Google's restructuring as Alphabet Inc. They received significant investments from Google, Nintendo, and The Pokémon Company to support their growth. Over the years, Niantic has raised additional funding through various rounds, including a Series B funding round led by Spark Capital and a Series C funding round led by Institutional Venture Partners (IVP), valuing the company at $3.7 billion.

Niantic has made several acquisitions and investments to enhance its capabilities. They acquired Evertoon, an app for creating personalized films, to strengthen their social systems. They also acquired Escher Reality, an augmented reality company, with the intention of allowing third-party developers to create AR games like Pokémon Go. Another acquisition was Matrix Mill, a company specializing in computer vision and machine learning, to improve Niantic's augmented reality experiences. Niantic also invested in DigiLens for the development of holographic waveguide displays and acquired Sensible Object, a London-based development studio, to advance their efforts in bridging the physical and digital worlds.

In addition to these acquisitions, Niantic acquired 6D.ai, a 3D world-scanning software company, and Mayhem, a community gaming platform. They continued their acquisition spree in 2021 by acquiring Scaniverse, a 3D scanning app, and Lowkey, a social gaming platform. In 2022, Niantic acquired 8th Wall, a WebAR development platform, and NZXR, an augmented reality studio.

Niantic has been working on the Niantic Real World Platform, which they later rebranded as Lightship. This platform provides various tools for augmented reality experiences, including AR Cloud, anti-cheat security, point of interest data, and more. Niantic aims to open up the platform to third-party developers. They launched the Lightship software development kit in 2021 and secured $300 million in funding from Coatue Management to further develop Lightship and their "real-world metaverse," valuing the company at $9 billion.

John Hanke[]

John Hanke is an American entrepreneur and business executive known for founding and serving as the CEO of Niantic, Inc. He played a significant role in the development of popular augmented reality games such as Ingress, Pokémon GO, and Harry Potter: Wizards Unite. Before establishing Niantic, Hanke held a leadership position at Google, specifically in the Geo division, where he oversaw projects like Google Earth, Google Maps, StreetView, SketchUp, and Panoramio.

Hanke joined Google when it acquired Keyhole, where he had been working. At Google, he became the Vice President of Product Management for the Geo division and played a key role in transforming Keyhole's technology into successful products like Google Earth and Google Maps. He also facilitated the inclusion of Google Maps on the iPhone, which was a significant achievement. During his tenure, Hanke nurtured a team that would later become the foundation for Niantic.

In 2010, Hanke received resources to establish a gaming unit within Google, and this internal startup became Niantic Labs. Going back to his gaming roots, the company developed Ingress, an augmented reality multiplayer game based on real-world locations. Ingress gained immense popularity, with one million players within a year of its release in 2013 and seven million players by 2015.

In late 2015, John Hanke led Niantic's separation from Google, and the company secured $30 million in funding from Google, Nintendo, and Pokémon. Hanke continued to serve as the CEO of Niantic and successfully guided the company through the launch of Pokémon GO in July 2016. The game became a massive success, generating over $2 million in daily revenues.
