At Niantic, our mission is to help players explore, exercise, and embrace more real-world social interactions (at a safe distance, of course) through a diverse portfolio of games and experiences.

To help us achieve this goal, we're always looking for talented game development companies to join our mobile publishing pipeline and access the full capabilities of Niantic Lightship - the same Platform used to power games such as Ingress, Pokémon GO, Pikmin Bloom, and many more that are currently in development.

If you’re a developer with an idea or a game in progress that aligns with our mission to better the world through AR Geolocation play, we want to hear from you! If we end up working together, you'll have access to our platform as well as our talented team to help you produce, fund, and publish your game.

This initial application gathers basic information about your team's experience and skills. If your team seems like a great fit for Niantic Publishing, we'll invite you to submit a game pitch. Either way, we'll be in touch within a few weeks. Until then, if you have any questions, you can reach us at publishing@nianticlabs.com.

We look forward to seeing what amazing projects you have underway, and how we can empower you and your team!

If you are a developer outside of commercial gaming that is interested in accessing our platform for purposes outside of game publishing, please apply to our Niantic Creator Program.
