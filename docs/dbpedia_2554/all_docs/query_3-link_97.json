        "text": "Halfway through your walk to school, a wild Charmander appears. Just a few throws of a Pokéball, and it could be yours. Will you stop to catch it?\n\nNintendo is betting you will. Not just that, they're betting that you've waited most of your life to see a Pokémon in the real world.\n\nPokémon Go — the upcoming iOS and Android app from Nintendo, The Pokémon Co., and developer Niantic Labs — promises to let anyone with a smart phone \"find\" and train the diverse creatures of Pokémon all around them.\n\nFor aspiring Trainers, it could be an entirely new way to interact with a now 20-year-old franchise.\n\nFor these companies, though, Pokémon Go — which launches for free sometime in July — offers the biggest opportunity yet to bring augmented reality into the mainstream, a chance to prove not only that AR technology is ready for people, but that people are ready for AR.\n\nHidden worlds\n\nThe challenge for the app's developers, according to Will Mason, co-founder of the virtual reality industry website Upload, is \"normalizing the linkage between digital and physical.\"\n\nUnlike VR, which is all-encompassing to a fault, the purpose of AR is to supplement people's interactions with their world, usually by overlaying visual information. For an AR product to be effective, it must feel natural to use.\n\n\"It's a new genre of experience, about blending in the gameplay with other things you're doing,\" says John Hanke, CEO and founder of Niantic Labs.\n\nNiantic has some expertise in this realm. The company — which began as a startup inside Google and has since gone independent — is behind the popular AR mobile app Ingress. In that game, the screen shows points of energy springing up around a map of the user's surroundings. The energy appears at notable real-world locations, like museums or monuments, and users have to explore the world to encounter, and then battle over, those spots.\n\nLike Ingress, Pokémon Go will create interactions based on users' locations.\n\nIf it sounds like a fantasy version of Google Maps, that's because it is: Hanke was involved in developing Google Maps, Google Earth and Street View, and he wanted to apply those technologies in new ways.\n\nMobile games, he says, seemed a perfect fit to encourage people to go outside and discover what he calls the \"secret history\" of their neighborhoods.\n\n\"You think you know them but you don't,\" Hanke says, \"or maybe you walked by this place and never looked twice at it — whether it's a piece of artwork or a landmark you don't know the story behind.\"\n\nAfter Google Maps' famous 2014 April Fools joke — in which the company imagined people using their mobile app to find Pokémon hidden in caves and oceans — The Pokémon Co. reached out to Niantic to actually make it happen.\n\n\"It's always something we've been exploring, and it really comes down to having the technology to do it properly,\" says J.C. Smith, senior director of consumer marketing at The Pokémon Co.\n\nAdopting AR\n\nFor Pokémon Go, Niantic took the tools it developed with Ingress — including its database of interesting and historical places — and brought them into the world of Pokémon. Those recorded places will become PokéStops and Gyms, where players can pick up items or compete against other players.\n\nRather than the linear adventure narrative of the core games (like Pokémon Red and Blue, or Diamond and Pearl), Go at times resembles a game of capture-the-flag. Players pledge allegiance to one of three teams, and battle with Pokémon to gain control of Gyms.\n\nThe central conceit should ring familiar, though. Wander anywhere outside, and the app will alert you when you come near a Pokémon — either through an alert on your phone, or on the forthcoming Pokémon Go Plus, a Bluetooth-connected device that looks and works like a tricked-out Fitbit.\n\n(The Plus, with its $34.99 price tag, will theoretically enable people to play Go without stopping in the middle of the street to look at their phones.)\n\nTake out your phone, though, and through the screen a Pokémon will appear in your surroundings, as if it's sitting on the grass or floating in the air. That's the true \"augmented reality\" part of the game.\n\nGo isn't technically a new \"generation\" of the series, as each iteration of the core games is called — that will come out separately in November for the Nintendo 3DS. But Hanke says Niantic worked closely with Junichi Masuda, one of the series' original developers, to incorporate some 150-plus species of Pokémon into the app.\n\n\"We try to be true to the canon of Pokémon and the way things should work in that world,\" Hanke says.\n\nThat is, Pokémon will appear, behave and fight the way they do in the games and TV shows. Water-types, for instance, will appear only near bodies of water like rivers or lakes. Rare Pokémon in the games will similarly be scarce in the Go version.\n\nFor Taylor Freeman, Upload's other co-founder, Pokémon Go just scrapes the surface of what augmented reality could do.\n\n\"I think this could be a real driver of early adoption and bringing people into the fold and using AR,\" Taylor says.\n\nWhile using AR in public — like wearing Google Glass — may currently be distracting or even awkward, society could get used to the notion. Proto-AR products like Pokémon Go, its developers believe, may pave the way to a world where that tech becomes ingrained in people's daily lives.\n\nAnd if the app's successful, Hanke says, Niantic may integrate into the gameplay other wearable devices as they become socially viable. With glasses of its own, Pokémon Go could evolve into an even more vibrant world: Pikachu appearing right before your eyes, two players battling face-to-face to be the very best.\n\n\"I'll be the first person in line to buy those,\" Hanke says.\n\nGabriel Rosenberg is an NPR digital news intern."
