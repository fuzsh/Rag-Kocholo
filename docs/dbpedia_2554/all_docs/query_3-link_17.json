        "text": "I have spent countless hours playing a mobile game called Ingress and was even invited to beta test the Pokemon GO app. Ingress, and Pokemon GO by extension, has been a life changing experience in how a mobile game can convince me to go and explore the outdoors. The fusion of geo-location and real-time mapping combined with the allure of progression and collecting items that a game provides, creates a unique experience that ties the outdoors with gaming.\n\nNiantic, Inc.(formerly Niantic Labs) is a software development company that was founded in 2010 by John Hanke as a startup that was initially part of Google. They are known for developing augmented reality games for the mobile platform such as Ingress, Pokemon GO and Harry Potter: Wizards Unite. Niantic’s first major project was the augmented reality app called Ingress released in 2012.\n\nIngress is described as a mobile game that is a mix between geo-caching and capture the flag that uses your geo-location to represent your position in the game. Built using a LibGDX engine, players can visit virtual “portals” that represent physical landmarks or points of interest and either battle to capture the portal or reinforce it with augments. The main draw of Ingress is that every portal is a persistent object that every other user can also interact with, and depending on which side you chose, the game can quickly turn into a multiplayer-multi-faction slugfest.\n\nPlayers can also link other portals together via keys that each portal can drop and when 3 portals are connected, under the condition that the connection does not impede other links, a colored field is created under your individual factions color. This creates a competitive atmosphere that encourages players from distant communities to team up their efforts in creating huge and awesome colored triangles.\n\nPokemon GO came out in 2016 and is Niantic’s second major augmented reality mobile game. Released as a collaboration with The Pokémon Company, Pokemon GO uses most of the concepts from Ingress except it was built using Unity, a powerful cross-platform game engine. Much like Ingress, Pokemon GO allows the player to walk around in a virtual world via geo-positioning and lets you capture nearby Pokemon with thrown Pokeballs.\n\nNiantic was cleverly able to scale up their apps by using previous data gathered by their earlier creations. Starting with their first app, Field Trip, which lead to the initial portal database used within Ingress, they were able to gather more data by allowing players to submit points of interest for evaluation and eventual creation of new portals just from user feedback. By using this user-generated database of points of interest, they were able to easily scale this into making Pokemon GO’s Pokestops and Gyms which were the exact same portals in Ingress. It is pretty ingenious to be able to utilize their players from a previous game to unknowingly help them gather data for their next game."
