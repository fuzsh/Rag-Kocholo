        "text": "By Caitlin Burns\n\nHistorians from the Future is a recurring segment that asks the deep questions that we aren’t looking at immediately when we’re evaluating current events. What do we not see that’s staring us in the face? What are we missing that the passage of time might show us?\n\nSo you’ve been playing Pokémon Go for the last few months. Of course you have, more people have been playing Pokémon Go in the United States in July 2016 than were using Twitter, Tindr, or volunteered at soup kitchens (we assume, no one is measuring that in real time these days).\n\nPokémon Go is being lauded as the first big Augmented Reality (AR) product, and that’s true to a point. While we’re all busy with our heads down staring at a map and chasing pocket monsters, what have we been missing? Let’s contact the future and get some perspective. It was the most popular mobile app launch ever, it’s drawing business to small businesses, it earned millions in microtransations per day.\n\nBut what will historians from the future say about Pokémon Go? Why would they pay attention at all? And how would the perspective of the future change the way we think, talk and play it today? We’ll explore this in a multi-part series over the course of the next few issues.\n\nWhat was Pokémon Go?\n\nPokémon Go was a social location based game (LBG) built by Niantic Labs (a location based gaming company formerly owned by Alphabet (Google) ) tasked with using Alphabet technologies in alternative reality gaming and similar applications. Pokémon Go was built on top of Google Maps, which tracks users locations and journeys while using the app. It was also partially owned by The Pokémon Company, and Nintendo.\n\nReleased in July 2016, Pokémon Go is the first mass market location data capture game built by one of the world’s largest data monopolies and was not just targeted at adults who have full comprehension of data privacy and opt-ins, but children who were younger than commercial smartphones.\n\nThe game was a relatively simple application for mobile phones (both iOS and Android) that allowed users to create a profile and walk around the United States collecting animated “pocket monsters,” collecting bonuses from drop points and conquering “Gyms” from other players for one of three teams.\n\nThis game’s success surprised many people, but looking at it on paper it was an obvious blue chip. Pokémon itself was one of the most profitable gaming Intellectual Property of all time, with a multi-generational audience built from the late 1990s on from a franchise that included an animated television series, feature films, console and hand-held games and a wildly successful trading card game. Millions of people both children and adults were fans of the property and its simplicity meant it was easy to engage. The I.P. itself had spawned a wide range of also successful trading card/TV/game competitors including Bakugan, Yu-Gi-Oh and Digimon. At launch, Millions of people knew how to play the simple game, and wanted to catch ‘em all with their friends.\n\nUltimately, it allowed for Pokémon trading and updated to bring in new Pokémon and challenges as its audience began to drop off in the few months after launch.\n\nThe big difference between other iterations of the Pokémon franchise and Pokémon Go was that this powerful story world was coupled with the single largest location-based data network ever created by man. Instead of a closed system like Pokémon’s previous games, this open system took players out of their homes and tapped into data that was previously off-limits for data companies – children under 13.\n\nWhether the ambition of these previous games or their financial resourcing was what limited their scope and success the technology and a mass-market intellectual property put this instance over the top.\n\nThe combination of this powerful story world and its appealing, non-threatening characters and game mechanics that had been tried and established, distributed on devices easily accessible to an audience from 5 to 50 was a recipe for success.\n\nWhy is Pokémon Go at all important to the future?\n\nThis app marks the first time a single, intentional product created a mass market location based game + geographic data capture network. In retrospect, it was obvious that this would need to be something that hit younger generations of technology users, as the previous generations were more skeptical of communal sharing of private data and less likely to have the free time or inclination to engage in this type of social gaming.\n\nIt’s also the first time that you can find a location based game mobilizing its player-base to leave their homes and engage in physical exercise en-mass. This was a huge change in behavior and perception of games. While it had been theorized that games – which are intrinsically based on convincing players to engage in a series of actions – could be used for population mobilization (literal mobilization) previous instances had been niche.\n\nIt also reached communities in less urban areas than previous location-based games. It reached a much larger audience. Because it is the first to market case study that showed that location based gaming and AR could be mass-market hits, it influenced the future not just of game development, but the business of data capture.\n\nThis was not all good, there is a slippery slope that Pokémon Go is part of that represented a wider psychological and sociological trend. As people become more comfortable with virtual systems and spending their time learning the mechanics of imaginary worlds, the more disconnected they become to the mechanics of the real world. A concerning obsession with virtual worlds can be critiqued as an excuse to become complacent and apathetic to real-world concerns: individual, local, social, cultural or political. As people became more engaged with catching virtual monsters, generational expertise was being lost whether it be mechanical tinkering, arts and crafts, cooking, or gardening. The skills that previous generations had accumulated because their time was focused on tangible real-world pursuits was lost because of a few generations overwhelming focus on imaginary worlds.\n\nThere would ultimately be a backlash, such as the neo-agrarian movement where urban-dwellers chose to become farmers. Radical self-reliance and a new renaissance would grow out of the wake of the Great Recession. The ability to make those choices is often limited by geographic or economic constraints – it’s much harder to purchase and run a family farm in a midwestern state where agritech companies like ConAgra or Monsanto are the big players than in an area like Upstate New York where small farms exist even as the children of farmers opt-ed out of running their parents’ farms. Movements like the Maker Movement and the explosion of individual crafting represented by Etsy.com were populated disproportionately by people starting in the white, upper-middle class. While the promise of stronger individual opportunity based on these skills was apparent, accessing the tools to learn these skills, apply them in business, and to sustain oneself depended on leasure time and access to extracurricular education. The promise of the Maker movement was only true to autodidacts, those able to learn from classes, mentorship and the time to refine them were limited by the lack of multigenerational mentorship in family groups.\n\nWhat’s the deal with personal data privacy?\n\nPersonal data privacy may have been THE issue that people ignored in the early 21st Century that we look at now – from the future – the same way we look at medical practices before germ theory – how did they not see this happening?\n\nAs games moved from physical distribution into platforms on closed hardware systems, the companies that made them looked for models that would give them an edge in the market. This could mean their own private data ecosystems or hardware ecosystems or both.\n\nFor other groups, like mass market apps, they needed to ensure that players were integrated into their games fast, had incentive to stay, and in a market that included 54 Million competitors they needed to find every avenue to profitability and streamline production budgets possible. This led to even heavier reliance on third party data ecosystems like google maps and in turn, the sale of player data to partner or third party data research groups.\n\nWhat happened to that data when it was sold? Well that’s the biggest question, a few games, mostly serious or scholarly games had very clear data sharing protocols and would be focused on the study of brain patterns, like Sea Hero Quest, or like FoldIT relied on the wisdom of crowds to advance specific studies. Most data capture systems from games or into data ecosystems like Google (Niantic) or Facebook (Oculus) were entirely open-ended in their terms of service. The average daily user of Google’s data system contributed about $45 worth of data to their system per year, for Facebook users, this number was approximately $35. This was bartered for the free services provided and was rarely addressed or challenged in regulation from institutional or government oversight groups.\n\nTo take a look at the current online tracking systems that are looking at your activity, we recommend the interactive online documentary Do Not Track.\n\nWon’t somebody think of the children?\n\nThe entertainment industry had previously been able to gather metrics on physical activity in different ways to demonstrate return on investment in a limited number of ways: box office ticket sales, Nielsen ratings for at-home television viewers, device-based metrics for digital applications, etc…. Pokémon Go unlocked a wide range of social feedback data metrics that combined or explored attributes of user activity that included and provided context for usage during play including location, displacement and distance, impact on local economies and a wider range of data that was captured over the coming months and years: the in-game trading economy, social and communal growth, predictive analysis of pedestrian traffic patterns and the ability to test or influence those same patterns.\n\nIt was also a landmark moment in children’s entertainment– and more particularly, Advertising aimed at children through entertainment – that is answerable to the Federal Trade Commission’s guidelines for children’s online content “COPPA” and had previously held itself to a general set of best practice rule sets established by the Children's Advertising Review Unit Self-Regulatory Program for Children's Advertising “CARU”. CARU delineated what sorts of data capture and advertising would and wouldn’t be targeted at children under 13.\n\nThis app, aimed ostensibly at “Everyone” undermined the posit that children’s location or activity data wouldn’t be pursued by games and other entertainments. In the early days, no one seems to notice this trespass into the lives of the young, but Pokémon Go will be a powerful case study when future legislators start reviewing and revising the oversight of data capture for children… or be viewed as the cliff that regulation fell off of, mortgaging a generation’s data collection future to whoever can catch all the users.\n\nIt didn’t help matters that Google companies had a track record of misusing or miscommunicating personal data was compounded by early “bugs” in the initial release that asked iOS users for complete access to all their interrelated Google Accounts. Niantic walked this back within weeks, and while privacy experts still wrung their hands, Pokémon Go still set revenue records for months following.\n\nAsking forgiveness rather than permission in new technology experimentation\n\nAn overall trend in emerging business and technologies during the first half of the 21st Century was one of developing a disruptive technology regardless of legal regulation of its related category, and through rapid scaling to ensure that a company became too big to be regulated by local, or even federal institutions. We'll go into more on this in a future issue.\n\nUsers as self- quantifiers\n\nThe idea of users experimenting with their own data and participation in new businesses is not necessarily a bad thing, as long as people know what they’re getting into. Companies terms of service increasingly made clear their liability and the expectations one should have of their services stating clearly things like Inside Tracker’s “THE SITE DOES NOT OFFER MEDICAL ADVICE AND NOTHING CONTAINED IN THE CONTENT IS INTENDED TO CONSTITUTE PROFESSIONAL ADVICE FOR MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS.” It’s a legal disclaimer that doubles as a statement of purpose.\n\nWhere this breaks down is that there is an asymmetric relationship between the user and the organization providing those terms.\n\nIt is rare that a user even reads the terms of service before they agree.\n\nIt’s even rarer that users have the experience with legal language necessary to parse the complexity of those terms of service, that quickly balloon into the dozens of pages.\n\nThere is a basic lack of understanding on a personal level the value of the data the individual is providing to the organization\n\nThe organization is rarely transparent about their overall use user data, or future intended use – for instance, how many people who signed up for 23andMe to trace their family genome anticipated their DNA to be part of an anonymized dataset sold to 3rd parties? Would they have been as quick to share their DNA code if they did know?\n\nThe Interpretation Gap\n\nA little knowledge can be a dangerous thing, and one of the reasons that certain categories have evolved rigorous review and research criteria over centuries of human development (medical testing, scientific research, zoning and civic planning) is that without the contextualization of experts, information can be misleading and require consultation.\n\nTake the example of a reporter testing health monitoring app showing his results to a clinician.\n\n“His advice boiled down to the straightforward and altogether unsurprising: lose some weight. In a way, taking the blood tests felt like I’d paid a mechanic for a comprehensive evaluation, only to discover that the fix involved nothing more than regular oil changes. They largely confirmed something I could have learned from stepping on a bathroom scale. But knowing what I needed to do wasn’t enough, and if there was one thing periodic testing did, it was provide continual updates and reminders.”\n\nThis sense of self-quantified reliance on new systems means that users also rely on consultation from these novel sources, regardless if they are overseen by medical professionals or 20-year-old college dropouts.\n\nLocalization and Legislative Cultures\n\nWhile privacy issues relating to Pokémon Go specifically were brought up in the United States Senate. Europe and the United Kingdom had already distinguished their legislative parameters from those of North American countries remarkably. Pursuing AntiTrust cases against Google and Facebook, establishing the online “right to be forgotten” and holding these and other companies liable for misuse of personal data.\n\nPokémon Go: Augmented Reality’s Star Wars?\n\nWhen reading about Pokémon Go, immediately after it’s publication, it’s easy to see how excited the press was about it’s early success.\n\nIt hit the market early by the standards of AR and it was the first time most of its millions of players had experienced an Augmented Reality (AR) interface.\n\nStar Wars was a feature film that thought of itself as a franchise at a time when long-term planning and licensing were not the norm for the entertainment industry. It’s long term success became the case study that movie studios pointed to in order to invest and develop feature film properties for the next several decades.\n\nPokémon Go, while AR is not its primary gameplay mechanic, proved to investors that AR was a viable technology for a mass market implementation. While Virtual Reality has been the hot new topic for several years, but by all researched metrics, the applications in entertainment and other industries for Augmented Reality was likely to be more than twice as profitable, as its applications covered a much wider range of market categories. Because of its novelty, Pokémon Go will be the case study referred back to unfailingly in conversations about AR as an entertainment technology – whether it’s appropriate to the application of the technology or not.\n\nWhile Head Mounted Displays (HMDs) the hardware for running advanced virtual reality experiences has been receiving large investments in recent years and gained major headlines as the first consumers HMDs shipped in 2016 (Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, PlayStationVR) teams are still several years away from consumer level Augmented Reality and Mixed Reality HMDs (Microsoft Hololens, Meta, Magic Leap).\n\nPokémon Go is whetting the appetite for investment for AR content in a way that did not exist in June 2016 by showing that this style of user experience is one that players will engage with and enjoy. It doesn’t hurt that it prompts picture taking and the creation of sharable content, allowing users to promote the game casually without relying on heavy branding or any spending on traditional out of home or digital advertising. To date, Pokémon Go has not spent a cent on out of home or banner advertising. It’s never had to.\n\nSince Pokémon Go’s release, AR content and location based technologies are compelling to investors in a new way and groups that have been pounding the pavement seeking out investment for their projects for years with little traction have had their phones ringing off the hook since July 2016. This could be the beginning of the AR gold rush."
