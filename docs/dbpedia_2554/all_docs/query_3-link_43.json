        "text": "Niantic’s Pokémon GO is a mobile smartphone app game, based on augmented reality (AR) technology, that superimposes game characters on smartphone views of real-world scenes, in real-world locations. Players compete by interacting with characters they encounter in these real-world, physical spaces.\n\nHarry Potter Wizards Unite is also a mobile smartphone app game that uses AR technology. Players interact with game artifacts and characters that appear based on the geographical location of the player.\n\nIngress Prime is an upgraded version of Niantic’s original product, Ingress. Like Pokémon Go and Wizards Unite, it is a smartphone app, mobile AR-based game involving “portals” that can only be accessed and interacted with by traveling to their physical locations.\n\nPlayers typically interact with all three games using a smartphone, or alternatively, in the case of Pokémon GO, a special purpose one-button GPS device. All games require presence in specific geographic locations, though have made some adaptations during COVID-19 to enable play from within one’s home. As such, these games require physical movement and presence in outdoor locations. Games can be played individually or in cooperation with other players. People tend to play these games mostly during the day.\n\nThe Niantic games, especially Pokémon GO, are globally popular. Pokémon GO is estimated to have 150 million monthly active users worldwide.\n\nPhysically moving from one location to another is fundamental to the play of Niantic’s games and thus they promote physical activity by their users. Niantic’s 2019 Social Impact Report documented 16.3 billion kilometers walked by players across all Niantic games.(1) Research studies have also documented increased physical activity associated with playing Pokémon GO.(2)\n\nIn addition, Niantic offers gaming incentives for physical activity in Pokémon GO.\n\nBy promoting both physical activity and time outdoors, both of which have been shown to improve sleep, Niantic’s games can make a positive contribution to sleep on those days in which consumers are playing the game.\n\nOn the other hand, there are concerns that for some users, playing Pokémon GO competes with sleep. In one study 38% of users reported being “very likely” or “likely” to sacrifice sleep.(3)\n\nNiantic’s games encourage collaboration among players. Their 2019 Social Impact report cites 173 million “friend connections” across all its games.(4)\n\nGames are often played socially -- groups of players go out together in person.\n\nBy drawing people out into their communities, the games promote casual social contacts or incidental social interactions among community members -- even among fellow game players who see each other in popular locations."
