With our mission to elevate people, companies and communities, this partnership was a natural fit.\n\nThe program entailed sending 20 selected individuals to Tech Elevator's online, full-time coding bootcamp to learn coding fundamentals. At the conclusion of the 14-week program, the individuals emerged as full-stack developers and had the opportunity to join Niantic for a six-month apprenticeship.\n\nThis partnership contributed to both organizations' shared mission of diversifying the technology workforce and making education opportunities more accessible to underrepresented communities."
