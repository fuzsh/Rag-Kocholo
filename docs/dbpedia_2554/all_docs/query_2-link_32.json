        "text": "Records the WSJ obtained due to the recent Epic trial show that Apple made more in gaming revenue than MS, Nintendo, Sony and Activision Blizzard made in 2019-Combined. Holy hell.\n\nAnd this is gaming too, not including non-gaming apps. Insanity.\n\nApple Inc. AAPL 0.81% doesn't make hot videogames such as \"Fortnite,\" or consoles such as the Xbox. But with little fanfare, Chief Executive Tim Cook has turned the maker of the iPhone into one of the world's largest videogame companies.\n\nThe key is the App Store, its digital marketplace, where the company sells and distributes thousands of games by other companies and developers, from Epic Games Inc.'s \"Fortnite\" to Tencent Holdings Ltd. TCEHY -1.59% 's \"Honor of Kings\"—and takes a 30% cut of sales. That explains a lot about the tech giant's current battles with rivals.\n\nApple raked in more profits from games than Xbox maker Microsoft Corp. MSFT 2.55% , gaming giants Nintendo Co. and Activision Blizzard Inc. ATVI 1.47% and PlayStation maker Sony Corp. —combined—in its fiscal year 2019, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of figures released as part of the company's recent antitrust trial.\n\nApple's operating profits from games that year totaled $8.5 billion, according to the Journal analysis, exceeding the other four companies' combined gaming operating incomes in the same period. The tech giant said operating margins discussed during the trial were flawed and as a result are too high.\n\nApple's dominance, however, is under threat. Its position as the gatekeeper to the gaming economy places it at odds with Facebook Inc.,Microsoft and \"Fortnite\" maker Epic Games Inc. as each company prepares for the next frontier in technology: virtual reality.\n\nMany digital activities—from search to social to shopping to live events —could take place inside of games in the coming years. Industry global revenue from videogames is expected to almost double to $198 billion in 2024 compared with 2016, according to estimates by technology consulting firm Activate Inc. The biggest chunk of that growth is from mobile games, which Activate predicts will generate $103 billion in 2024.\n\nPaywalled, but posted choice excepts.\n\nApple Doesn’t Make Videogames. But It’s the Hottest Player in Gaming.\n\nCEO Tim Cook quietly turned the iPhone company into a superpower in the videogame business. Now he’s fighting rivals in a multiplayer universe.\n\nWhile true - If they pulled out of gaming tomorrow and lit fire to every game on their App Store - every single one of my favorite games of all time, all the games I've put most my time into in the last decade, and arguably the most critical well received games since 2007 would all continue to exist and still be available elsewhere.\n\nI like Apple. I think the App Store is an amazing thing and democratized the entry into the gaming sphere. And the casual market is no doubt massive.\n\nbut for me, it's not terribly important. And that's why I imagine most on an enthusiast board don't care.\n\nHas been for a long time. This is an enthusiast forum so it is not what we are focused on, but Apple completely owns casual gaming (which is most of the market)\n\nIt's not just \"casual gaming.\" The biggest core games in some the world's biggest markets (China, Southeast Asia, India, Brazil, more) are on Mobile. I would not consider Honor of Kings, FreeFire, PUBG, etc. casual games and they have millions of players and insane revenue. I think this board concentrates very heavily on one particular type of video game that is popular in one or two parts of the world.\n\nThough I guess it's Apple and Google in this case.\n\nEdit: Not disagreeing with any of your post btw but just wanted to note it's even more.\n\nTheir point is that games like Candy Crush are incredibly simple, with little in the way of discussion on a gaming board.\n\nEven things like Pokemon Go that have relatively complex mechanics and high engagement levels for all types of play kind of boil down to a reddit page that explains everything and leaves nothing but \"I caught this rare ----\" or \"this ---- thing Niantic is doing is bullshit!\"\n\nLike, even with their weird RTS offerings...it's all so very shallow that there's nothing to talk about.\n\nIt's been really interesting watching Bloons 6 become popular on twitch again, because it's absolutely one of \"those games\" but there's a weird depth to it that makes it really fun to watch and play. It's always growing, the meta keeps changing, it's kind of a amazing. There's something to talk about there, a discussion to be had outside of the very obvious \"these games are really attacking people with impulse control when it comes time to gouge people in order to buy energy to keep playing\".\n\nThis is obviously a little crass and overreaching but, I doubt there's enough interesting context in the top 10 sellers on the apple gaming store to have an hour long discussion outside of their predatory nature. That would actually be a really fun thought experiment, a young eager youtuber should jump on that.\n\nThis is like saying Walmart is a bigger player in the food industry than Tyson. Yeah, obviously, in terms of raw dollars.\n\nCan I cook Tyson chicken at Walmart? You use Apple devices to play App Store games. And it is a selling point for their products as well. May not resonate with hardcores who are into PC or console gaming.\n\nNot really a good analogy.\n\nValve's SteamDeck is more of an apt comparison. However, the SteamDeck is open platform, unlike Apple's phones and tablets.\n\nIt's like saying McDonalds dominates the restaurant industry. If you're an investor sure apple is important. If youre a game \"gourmand\" the fine dining is on dedicated gaming platforms. There's good stuff on phones too but it's diamonds in the rough.\n\nThe analogy was never about \"taste\" though. It's a purely business analysis, using raw numbers.\n\nI mean they're a store. They should be ranked against Walmart, not Nintendo.\n\nBut they have hardware to play the games they sell. If Walmart had a device to play the games they sold, I would agree. Plus Apple invest in gaming technology via their hardware choices (AR, dedicated graphics chips, etc) and software. Not really getting these comparisons.\n\nLike, I'm looking at the games that Apple says are their top games of 2020.\n\n‎Get the Top Games of 2020 : App Store Story\n\n‎Learn about collection Get the Top Games of 2020 featuring Among Us!, Call of Duty®: Mobile, Roblox, and many more on Mac App Store. Enjoy these apps on your iPhone, iPad, and Mac.\n\nAnd if you scroll down to the paid, you see some familiar faces. Stardew, GTA:SA, Tarreria, 5 nights, Bloons6(!), there are titles that have been discussed here at length because they are ports of larger titles. And yes, there is a conversation to be had about why these games are so popular, but again, that's more of a conversation about how the general public, the casual market, interacts with their digital spaces on a daily basis, which is through phones predominantly, especially in other countries.\n\nBut we're not talking about the games. We're talking about the platform.\n\nAnd then I look up to the free games and it's like...It's hard to drum up more than 100 words about any of these games. What can I possibly say about Brain Masters that's interesting or nuanced. What discourse is there to be had about Mario Run, other than how lacking it is as both a video game an a mario game? What can I say about Call of Duty Mobile beyond that it's the worst way to play call of duty?\n\nAn most importantly, which again, is a platform issue rather than a game issue.\n\nHow many of these fairly vapid free games are making dramatically more money than any of the paid entries?\n\n:🤷: I ABSOLUTELY understand why people don't talk about mobile games very much here. Most of them are really dull, and the ones that have things that are \"worth\" sharing, are generally predatory.\n\nI mean they're a store. They should be ranked against Walmart, not Nintendo.\n\nNintendo, Google, Microsoft, Sony; They're all stores.\n\nI bet apple is absolutely blowing the doors of Walmart's digital efforts.\n\nIt's only marginally related, but articles like this are why I'm honestly expecting cloud gaming such as Luna or xCloud (probably not Stadia, unfortunately) to be such massive players within 5 years or so. Mobile gaming is massive, and if companies can bring console level experiences to mobile players in a cohesive manner (and touch controls on xCloud feel surprisingly great) it will really be huge I think.\n\nAlso, this is a possible derail, but does anyone know any good mobile games? I recently upgraded from my old iPhone 7 and I only ever had the GBC version of Tetris in an emulator, Temple Run and Doodle Jump on my phone for games. Downloaded Nier Reincarnation but I'm wondering if there's anything else good\n\nIt is a little strange how this place diminishes mobile gaming.\n\nIts not something I am very interested in either, but it is really the dominant and most popular way for people to play games and it has been that way for a while now.\n\nI think of it this way, if somebody tells me they're really into scripted drama, I don't start off assuming they're talking about CSI. Just because something is popular doesn't mean it's what enthusiasts of the medium most want to talk about.\n\nLike, even with their weird RTS offerings...it's all so very shallow that there's nothing to talk about.\n\nIt's been really interesting watching Bloons 6 become popular on twitch again, because it's absolutely one of \"those games\" but there's a weird depth to it that makes it really fun to watch and play.

That would actually be a really fun thought experiment, a young eager youtuber should jump on that.\n\nHonestly this is a great example of people on Resetera having absolutely no idea what they're talking about when it comes to video games outside their narrow worldview.\n\nAlright, if your contribution to this are \"LOL, games are so much more what people know than here, but let's not talk about them\" then I guess we're done here?\n\nLike, here's your opportunity, go off if you want.\n\nNo, my contribution was earlier. I even named some of the games you're ignoring in it. If you're trying to tell me that there's little to discuss about Honor of Kings, a MOBA with more players than League of Legends, or Free Fire, a game that hit a word record for viewership of any esports event, then I'm not sure what to say. I don't expect to see much discussion of those games here for two reasons:\n\n* Era is dominated by single player games and there is often little discussion of multiplayer titles\n\n* Era is an English forum with a largely American audience\n\nBut saying \"enthusiasts\" don't talk about those games because there's little to talk about is absolute bullshit. I would at least expect enthusiasts to be aware of video games on a more global scale.\n\nNo, my contribution was earlier. I even named some of the games you're ignoring in it.

I would at least expect enthusiasts to be aware of video games on a more global scale.\n\nOkay, I'll give you that. Obviously more international games like Freefire are going to be a blindspot for Americans because we have 0 exposure to it. Hell, I posted the top 20 free and paid games on the app store in 2020 and none of the games you listed save for PUBGm, are listed.\n\nThere definitely is something to the idea of american games continually thinking that mobile gaming is a mostly vapid or recycled experience because the games that have gigantic followings don't come out here, or at the very least aren't endorsed by literally any venue, the platform holders included. I don't think that's unique to Era though, I'd guess that all western forums would be similar (at least the ones that are left).\n\n(BTW, you see how we're having a conversation here? It's a much better way of doing things, right?)\n\nWhat kind of costs are included in this? Like R&D of their new chips absolutely should have partially be in that equation.\n\n...why? Even the recent chip shortage wouldn't really factor into it when phones from the past 5 years can all play these games by mandate.\n\nLike, even if there wasn't a production shortage for consoles, it wouldn't change anything here."
