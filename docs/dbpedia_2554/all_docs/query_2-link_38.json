        "text": "April 4, 2018\n\nSAN FRANCISCO – April 4, 2018 – Niantic, Inc. and Playmob are teaming up to host the first ever Pokémon GO Earth Day Clean Up on April 22. The Pokémon GO Earth Day Clean Up initiative is a series of events that will take place across locations around the world, inviting the Pokémon GO community to join together to clean up the environment and their local areas. Trainers will also have an opportunity to donate to the Mission Blue Foundation, a global coalition united to inspire public awareness, access and support for a worldwide network of marine protected areas.\n\nThe Pokémon GO Earth Day Clean Up events will be hosted by Niantic and local NGOs around the world, with coordination implemented by Playmob, the gaming-for-good organization, in collaboration with local non-governmental organizations in each community. Each Pokémon GO Earth Day Clean Up event will unite local Trainers in each community to focus on gathering garbage and debris in public spaces that require significant work.\n\n“Earth Day is an incredible movement and opportunity to team up with friends and neighbors to focus on making the world and our own communities healthy and sustainable,” said John Hanke, founder and CEO of Niantic. “We’re looking forward to joining Trainers around the world in their efforts to clean up and preserve the environment in support of the world’s oceans and Mission Blue.”\n\n“We know gaming can be an amazing force for good” adds Jude Ower, founder and CEO of Playmob. “It’s a pleasure to work with such a purposeful and innovative studio and the inspirational and devoted teams behind Mission Blue and all the supporting NGO partners, collaborating on what we see as the start of a bigger movement towards global solutions through play.”\n\nAll Trainers will receive access to a special avatar item to celebrate Earth Day and those who work together to participate in the cleanups around the world will unlock unique in-game rewards for the entire world. If 1,500 Trainers attend the events around the world, 2x catch Stardust for Ground, Water, and Grass-type Pokémon will be unlocked for 48hrs. If more than 3,000 Trainers participate in the clean up events, 3x catch Stardust for Ground, Water, and Grass-type Pokémon for 48 hrs will be unlocked for Trainers around the world.\n\nThe full list of Pokémon GO Earth Day Clean Up event locations can be found at pokemongolive.com/events/earth-day/ and include locations like North Carolina in the USA, Peacehaven in the UK, and locations in Japan.\n\nFor more information on The Pokémon GO Earth Day Clean Up please visit: https://pokemongolive.com/events/earth-day/\n\n=-=-=\n\nAbout Niantic, Inc.\n\nNiantic, Inc., builds mobile real-world experiences that foster fun, exploration, discovery and social interaction.
