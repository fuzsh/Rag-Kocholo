        "text": "The Electronic Entertainment Expo was the place to be last week for what’s next in entertainment technology, with flashy presentations from the biggest players in the gaming industry.\n\nThe annual extravaganza — which boasted 2,000 products, 130 announcements and 50,000 attendees — spilled out from the Los Angeles Convention Center onto nearby streets and venues with companies such as Electronic Arts, Microsoft and Sony hosting fan-centric events.\n\nHere’s some of the highlights from this year’s E3:\n\nMicrosoft\n\nXbox One is shrinking in size and growing in power. Microsoft unveiled a new, slimmer version of the video game console coming later this year and teased a more powerful one that’s due in 2017.\n\nThe company says the white Xbox One S is 40 percent smaller than the original black Xbox One and will feature support for high-definition 4K video.\n\nOther changes include moving the USB ports to the front of the console, adding a built-in infrared blaster and eliminating the port for the motion-detecting Kinect camera system. Microsoft says the console will go on sale in August for $299 to $399 depending on the size of the hard drive.\n\nThe company also detailed Project Scorpio, a more powerful Xbox One that will feature support for 4K gaming and virtual reality. The new console will feature six teraflops — or 6 trillion floating point operations per second — of power.\n\n“Our vision for the future of gaming is beyond generations,” said Xbox head Phil Spencer. “When it ships next year, we believe it will be the most powerful console ever built.”\n\nSony\n\nSony solely dedicated its E3 briefing to showcasing games coming to its PlayStation 4 and PlayStation VR. The company said before E3 that it was working on a more powerful version of the PS4 but didn’t plan to show it during the expo.\n\nInstead, Sony showed off such titles as “Batman: Arkham” for PS VR, “Spider-Man: Homecoming,” the zombie drama “Days Gone,” android detective tale “Detroit: Become Human,” the long-awaited puzzler “The Last Guardian” and a Norse mythology-inspired version of “God of War.”\n\nSeveral games will feature support for PS VR, the $399 headset that works in tandem with PS4 that Sony announced will be released Oct. 13. The role-playing game “Final Fantasy XV,” horror sequel “Resident Evil VII” and science-fiction shoot-’em-up “Star Wars Battlefront” will have VR modes.\n\n“Metal Gear Solid” creator Hideo Kojima introduced a clip of his latest creation, “Death Stranding.” The ominous footage featured a computer-generated version of “The Walking Dead” actor Norman Reedus waking up on a beach surrounded by dead crabs, whales and other sea life as five mysterious figures floated in the distance.\n\nElectronic Arts\n\nElectronic Arts is leaning heavily on The Force. The video game publisher teased three forthcoming games set in the “Star Wars” universe. The games include a new edition of “Star Wars Battlefront” inspired by the recent films from DICE and Motive Studios, an action-adventure game with an original story from Visceral Games and a third-person action game from Respawn Entertainment.\n\nOther games EA hyped included the grappling-hook-enhanced “Titanfall 2,” the World War I shooter “Battlefield 1,” the story-focused soccer simulator “FIFA 17” and the space-exploring saga “Mass Effect: Andromeda,” which is set in an all-new realm.\n\nNintendo\n\nNintendo put all of its faith in Link at E3. The video game publisher used its entire booth to promote “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,” the latest installment of the action-adventure series starring iconic adventurer Link. After delaying the title from last year, “Breath of the Wild” is set for release in March for the Wii U console. It will also be available for Nintendo’s yet-to-be-revealed NX system, scheduled to debut in 2017.\n\nPokémon\n\nAn augmented-reality Pokémon game for smartphones is slated for release by the end of July. The game, called “Pokémon Go,” will let players scour real-life city streets, parks and other locations to capture virtual monsters, such as the well-known creature Pikachu. It will connect with coming titles in the blockbuster franchise being developed for Nintendo Co.’s hand-held gaming system. “Pokémon Go” is being developed for iOS and Android by Pokémon Company and Niantic Inc., a spinoff from Alphabet Inc.’s Google that is known for the augmented-reality game “Ingress.”\n\nUbisoft\n\nFor its next open-world game, Ubisoft is combining collaborative multiplayer action with snowy extreme sports. The video game publisher capped off its presentation with a first look at “Steep.” The game will set players loose on a virtual rendition of the Alps where they can ski, snowboard, paraglide and base-jump from mountain cliffs.\n\nUbisoft also showcased the superhero-themed “South Park: The Fractured But Whole,” virtual reality starship simulator “Star Trek: Bridge Crew,” open-world tactical shooter “Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Wildlands” and hand-to-hand battle game “For Honor.”"
