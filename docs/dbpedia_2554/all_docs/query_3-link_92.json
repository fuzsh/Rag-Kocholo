        "text": "TOKYO -- Imagine coming out of your office, home, or school and getting an alert: A Pikachu is lurking behind a nearby tree, and the chase is on.\n\nJapanese video game company Nintendo Co., the Pokemon Co. and Google spin-off Niantic said today they intend to transplant the virtual realities of the famous Pokemon \"pocket monsters\" into real-world locations with a smartphone app that players can use to catch, trade and stage battles between the creatures.\n\nLocation-gaming app Pokemon GO is similar to Niantic's \"Ingress\" real-world adventure game, which reports 12 million downloads. The Nintendo game will be released in 2016, initially as a free download.\n\nNintendo also created Pokemon GO Plus, a small, wearable Bluetooth device that will use vibrations and flashes to alert players to Pokemon lurking in their surroundings.\n\nPokemon, or Pocket Monsters, are a franchise that began in 1996, created by Japanese video game developer Game Freak, which was acquired by Nintendo and also is involved in creating the new app. The best known of the imaginary creatures is likely the tubby, yellow Pikachu, with his lightning strike tail, rosy cheeks and brown-tipped rabbit ears.\n\nThe games call for players to catch and collect Pokemon, train them and stage battles while pursuing various adventures. Aside from games, there are Pokemon cartoons, toys, and trading cards.\n\nNiantic Inc. was founded as a Google subsidiary by Google Earth co-creator John Hanke. Its mobile game uses GPS technology to create a science fiction \"augmented reality.\"\n\nKyoto, Japan-based Nintendo held back from smartphone games, but in March announced an alliance with Japanese mobile game company DeNA to develop games for mobile devices. In the end, Pokemon GO was a pet project for its late president, Satoru Iwata, said Nintendo game designer Shigeru Miyamoto.\n\n\"Nintendo has created a wide variety of games and game devices. All of them have helped to expand the game population,\" Miyamoto said. \"Pokemon GO and Pokemon GO Plus represent another step in realizing that mission.\"\n\nConveying how the game might actually work is a challenge, acknowledged Tsunekazu Ishihara, president and CEO of Pokemon.\n\n\"You find the Pokemon with the smartphone. You'll have a map on your mobile device to find the Pokemon and you can try to catch them,\" he said.\n\nA video virtualization of the game seemed almost hallucinatory, with images of the Pokemon showing up on a screen operating like a video camera and masses of people chasing through streets.\n\nIshihara said one of the biggest challenges of designing the game is ensuring that the real world location data gathered by GPS and replicated in the game would not put people in danger.\n\n\"You don't want people rushing into traffic,\" he said.\n\nWith 'Mario Maker,' Nintendo relinquishes control\n\nLOS ANGELES-- Nintendo is giving players the keys to the Mushroom Kingdom.\n\nAfter three decades of releasing \"Super Mario\" video games, the notoriously protective Japanese gaming giant is inviting players to create their own levels in the bouncy plumber's homeland with the user-generated Wii U title \"Super Mario Maker,\" out Friday.\n\n\"I thought after 30 years, it would be perfect to reward creative players with the ability to build their own levels and be able to engage in the type of communication where a player and a creator can share the results,\" said \"Super Mario\" creator Shigeru Miyamoto during an interview translated by Nintendo of America product marketing manager Bill Trinen.\n\nSimilar to \"LittleBigPlanet,\" \"Minecraft\" and \"Disney Infinity,\" \"Mario Maker\" serves as a robust construction kit allowing players to virtually place such items as bashable bricks, floating coins, and deadly Koopas in the style of past games in the franchise: \"Super Mario Bros.,\" \"Super Mario Bros. 3,\" \"Super Mario World\" and \"New Super Mario Bros.\" The levels can then be uploaded and played by others online. Technologically, it's a huge leap from the original \"Super Mario\" game released in 1985.\n\n\"We were only able to have five Koopas on screen at one time,\" said Miyamoto. \"As the technology has evolved, we've gone on to having more enemies, 3-D technology and analog sticks. I've been fortunate that at every phase of new technology, we've been able to introduce a new `Mario' game that leverages it without having to think too deeply about a new story. It's kept `Mario' fresh and exciting for people throughout the 30 years of the series.\"\n\nMiyamoto said the developers focused on creating a game that would make building a \"Mario\" adventure a comprehensive but accessible experience. For instance, if players wish to share creations online, they must first be able to play through their level themselves - no matter how many Bowsers or Bullet Bills stand in the way.\n\n\"Mario Marker\" marks a decidedly progressive approach for the Kyoto, Japan-based company that's been strongly particular about its intellectual properties. By giving up control of Mario to players, does that mean the princess-rescuing plumber will finally go into retirement?\n\n\"I think this might actually be motivation for us,\" said Nintendo senior producer Katsuya Eguchi. \"Those of us in the industry will be like, `Really? You're going to throw that down?' We'll be jealous, and then we'll show them how to really do it.\"\n\nFor the creator of \"Super Mario,\" the character's evolution from 8-bit protagonist to gaming icon over the past 30 years is exactly as he intended.\n\n\"I really wanted him to make my Mickey Mouse,\" said Miyamoto. \"I wanted to use him in all the different games I made. My hope was that 10 or 20 years down the road, he would be the iconic character of video games. I feel tremendously fortunate that's what came to pass.\""
