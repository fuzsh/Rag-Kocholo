        "text": "Bellevue, Washington—September 25, 2018—The Pokémon Company International, Niantic, Inc., and Nintendo announced today that a new Mythical Pokémon has been discovered in the world of Pokémon GO: Meltan!\n\nMeltan is a Steel-type Pokémon with a body made mostly of liquid metal, which makes its shape very fluid. This Pokémon can use its liquid arms and legs to corrode metal and absorb it into its body. Meltan can generate electricity using the metal it absorbs from outside sources. It uses this electricity as an energy source and for an attack it fires from its eye.\n\nName: Meltan\n\nCategory: Hex Nut Pokémon\n\nHeight: 0'08\"\n\nWeight: 17.6 lbs.\n\nType: Steel\n\nIn Pokémon GO, sightings of Ditto that have transformed into Meltan have been reported. Professor Oak and Professor Willow have started research on Meltan. Professor Oak, one of the leading authorities in the field of Pokémon research, is based in the Kanto region’s Pallet Town. In Pokémon: Let’s Go, Pikachu! and Pokémon: Let’s Go, Eevee!, he gives a Pokédex to both you and your rival—entrusting you with his dream of completing it. Meanwhile, with the help of Pokémon GO players around the world, Professor Willow conducts his research in the field to fully understand the habitats and distribution of Pokémon. He was once an assistant to Professor Oak, and he talks to Oak, his mentor, whenever he runs into a hitch in his research.\n\nIt has been determined that Pokémon GO is somehow key to meeting Meltan in Pokémon: Let’s Go, Pikachu! and Pokémon: Let’s Go, Eevee! Updates will be provided as more is discovered about this mysterious Mythical Pokémon.\n\nPokémon GO, a mobile game that encourages fans to discover and catch Pokémon in the real world, is available for download both for iPhone in the App Store and for Android devices on Google Play.\n\nPokémon: Let’s Go, Pikachu! and Pokémon: Let’s Go, Eevee! will be available exclusively for the Nintendo Switch™ system on November 16, 2018.
