        "text": "A new mobile app has launched and itâs super effective. Hereâs our take on the recent launch of the viral mobile app, PokÃ©monGo.\n\nThe PokÃ©mon Go app has captured the attention of millions of fans around the world. In just a matter of hours they shot straight to the top of the mobile app store charts and are allegedly generating millions in revenue per day. How was Niantic, the company behind the app, able to make such a viral sensation? Well here at Lithios, making mobile apps is what we do best. We know all the pieces that go into making fully robust and innovative mobile apps.\n\nPokÃ©mon is obviously a cultural phenomenon but the PokÃ©monGo app has just the right balance of cool technical features and a simple, easy to use User Interface. Howâd they do it?\n\nWeâll break it down for you. Letâs start with the mobile technology:\n\nTechnology Features\n\nAUGMENTED REALITY\n\nCatch PokÃ©mon in real life with Augmented Reality. This technology feature creates an overlay of your current surrounding. Watch a Pikachu scurry past your desk. Spot a Pidgey flap at the park. Here are some screenshot examples of PokÃ©mon that have been spotted in hard-to-find places using Augmented Reality Technology.\n\nImage Attribution: Reddit/PokemonGoSnap\n\nGEOLOCATION AND GEOFENCING\n\nPokÃ©stops, gyms, and PokÃ©mon all appear using a GPS tracking method known as geolocation. The phone is able to grab your current location and determine how close you are to different areas. Each PokÃ©stop and gym sets up a geofence: a virtual barrier defined by a radius around a given latitude/longitude point. Once you enter that radius (i.e. walk close enough to a gym/stop) then you are able to access the contents of those locations (PokÃ©balls for everyone!)\n\nTaptic Vibration\n\nIs there a Beedrill nearby? Taptic Vibrations gives your phone a buzz when new PokÃ©mon appear, making sure that you, in fact, can catch them all.\n\nGoogle Maps api\n\nWith the Google Maps API, your neighborhood turns into Saffron city. This technology allows you to interact with the game field and snag a Charizard at your local coffee shop before your next door neighbor does. The app knows the name and location of all of the buildings and landmarks nearby by pulling the data from trusty Google Maps.\n\nPhoto Capture\n\nWhatâs the fun of catching a Charmander on your desk if you canât share it with your friends? PokÃ©monGo using the camera technology in your phone to snap quick photos of the PokÃ©mon you catch so you can share with your friends.\n\nDesign, UI/UX\n\nNavigation\n\nNavigating your way through PokÃ©mon Go couldnât be easier with the liberal use of radial menus. The simple PokÃ©ball icon is your mission control for everything pertaining to your PokÃ©-fam and bonus items while youâre on the go. Access to your statistics and nearby PokÃ©mon is executed easily through beautiful pop up menus that donât clutter the navigation, but organize it neatly. The usability of this touch-based interface stays within a comfortable range of where your thumb taps naturally, giving for an excellent user experience.\n\nGraphics\n\nPokÃ©mon Go has taken a huge leap in updating gameplay graphics since the 8-bit version on the Nintendo DS and Gameboy PokÃ©mon games. Improvements deemed necessary if Niantic wanted to seamlessly blend with the new technology of augmented reality. Bold colors and soft gradients used along with three dimensional renderings of the PokÃ©mon deliver an overall beautiful aesthetic.\n\nIs your app next?\n\nPokÃ©monGo has the benefit of featuring an iconic brand that we all know and love. In their first experience in the mobile app realm, they were able to make something that caught the attention of seemingly everyone in the world. Whether you want to be PokÃ©mon master or not, we hope you can appreciate the features that go into a mobile app. Did any of these features sound interesting to you? Do you have an idea for a mobile app and want to know how to get it done? Give us a call and maybe your app can be the next smash hit!\n\nLooking or the Best Spots in Raleigh to Find PokÃ©stops?\n\nDownload the PokÃ©mon Go Raleigh PokÃ©stop heat map.\n\nCatch Them All"
