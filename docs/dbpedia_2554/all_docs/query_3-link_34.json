        "text": "I started playing this game because my nine-year-old grandson played it and I wanted to know what he was doing and what the game was all about and how it would affect him and what was the messages being sent and I didnât think I was gonna have a good feeling about it to be honest with you but after playing it and doing PokÃ©mon GO not only have I become a fan, but I see some redeeming qualities in the game educationally in addition to the âthrill of the huntâ and the camaraderie of taking down a gym together. I do have some major issues however. I understand all electronic anything is going to have glitches. But Iâve played since September 2023 and rarely complained. Maybe thrice. My third one was in response to the meteorite that did NOT show up in a timely manner and I had multiple players trying to sort it out righ up until and after the time ran out. Niantic did nothing. This last raid set with Lucario. 1/10 chance????? 38!!!!! Not a single shiny! Iâm not the only one. And then somebody gets 6 shinies. I did 38. I handle some glitches as âjust part of the processâ but 38 no shinyâ¦1/10 odds. Like I said. I wasnât the only one. It was the number 1 Complaint I heard. Iâm a faithful pokemaner my jeep grand Cherokee sports wonderballs on a he hubcaps and Squirt on the gas tank. Faithful players should be treated better. JS ninjanana\n\nIâm very impressed with the amount of work the PokÃ©mon Go dev team has put into the game recently. For several years it seemed as if they didnât care about the game at all with all the bugs and the lack of updates and new content. However over the past about 6 months or so Iâve seen an OBVIOUS positive change in the game. Many minor and major bugs have been fixed, more customizable avatars (you can make them look like your original, you have to mess around with the style settings. Mine looks identical to how it did before except now my face looks less anime and more American which is where Iâm from), the ability to quick heal and quick revive, the ability to add a buddy from the individual pokÃ©mon view, an entire new map look in the game, an AWESOME new catch screen, for the recent ray raids there were issues and everyone complained about them being elite only so the devs are doing another whole ray raid day along with them being remote raid pass accessible, and there are so many other things. Iâm very impressed guys. Keep the good work coming. PokÃ©mon is one of the most lucrative franchises to ever exist and youâve been given the opportunity to have this banger of a game. Continue to expand it and make it better as youâve been doing, Iâm very impressed. ððð"
