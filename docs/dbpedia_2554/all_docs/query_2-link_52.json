        "text": "Pikachu or Eevee—which one will you set out on your journey with?\n\nYou can embark on an adventure together with Pikachu as your partner in Pokémon: Let’s Go, Pikachu! Or choose Eevee as your partner when you play Pokémon: Let’s Go, Eevee!\n\nUse your Joy-Con™ controllers to play Pokémon together with friends and family!\n\nThese games utilize the abilities of Nintendo Switch to add new and more approachable ways to play and experience Pokémon. Even those who have never played the Pokémon series before will be able to dive right in—Pokémon: Let’s Go, Pikachu! and Pokémon: Let’s Go, Eevee! are easy for newcomers to the series to pick up, but also have enough depth to keep veteran Trainers on their toes!\n\nThis device is shaped like a Poké Ball—and has the ability to connect to Pokémon GO!\n\nMeet the Poké Ball Plus. This Poké Ball-shaped device can be used as a controller for Pokémon: Let’s Go, Pikachu! and Pokémon: Let’s Go, Eevee! And it can also be used to bring your Pokémon out of your game, bringing them along for strolls in the real world, or connecting to the smartphone app Pokémon GO to bring Pokémon into these new titles. The Poké Ball Plus offers an entirely new Pokémon experience!\n\nWhat is Pokémon?\n\nSince 1996, when the first Pokémon role-playing games (RPGs) Pokémon Red and Pokémon Blue were released on the Nintendo Game Boy, the series has only continued to grow since that time. In core Pokémon titles, the player assumes the role of the main character, becoming a Pokémon Trainer on a journey in which he or she can encounter the many unique Pokémon that inhabit this world, befriending them and embarking on an adventure together.\n\nPokémon are wondrous creatures, and there are still many mysteries surrounding them. While some Pokémon live peacefully together with humans, there are also wild Pokémon that inhabit the tall grass, the caves, the seas, and many other natural habitats in this world. Much remains unknown about how they live.\n\nPokémon Yellow: Special Pikachu Edition\n\nPokémon Yellow was a role-playing game released for the Nintendo Game Boy in 1998. It was a reimagining of the original Pokémon Red and Pokémon Blue games, in which the player was given Pikachu as their first partner Pokémon, and this Pikachu would follow the player wherever they went in their adventure.\n\n©1995, 1996, 1998 Nintendo / Creatures Inc. / GAME FREAK inc.\n\nWhat is Pokémon GO?\n\nPokémon GO was released for smartphones in 2016, and the application has been downloaded 800 million times as of January 2018. By utilizing location data (GPS functionality), the real world serves as the setting for the game—allowing players to catch, battle, and adventure with Pokémon here in our own world.\n\nThe application is developed and operated by Niantic, Inc.\n\nProduct information\n\nTitle: Pokémon GO\n\nCompatible OS: Android/iOS\n\nNote: May not be playable with all devices or OS versions.\n\nMSRP: Basic features are free to play\n\nNote: Certain items are available as in-app purchases.\n\nPublisher: Niantic, Inc.\n\nDeveloper: Niantic, Inc.\n\nPokémon GO Official Website\n\nhttps://www.pokemongo.com/\n\nNiantic, Inc.’s official Pokémon GO website\n\nhttps://pokemongolive.com/en/\n\n©2018 Niantic, Inc. ©2018 Pokémon. ©1995–2018 Nintendo / Creatures Inc. / GAME FREAK inc.\n\nThe Pokémon GO Plus\n\nThis Pokémon GO Plus is a device that allows players to play Pokémon GO without the need to keep their eyes on their smartphone screen. When connected to your Pokémon GO account, the device’s lights and vibrations notify players when a Pokémon has appeared or there is a PokéStop nearby. Trainers can play the game by simply pressing the button on the face of their Pokémon GO Plus.\n\nOfficial Website\n\nhttps://www.pokemongo.com/en-us/pokemon-go-plus/\n\n©2016 Pokémon. ©1995–2016 Nintendo / Creatures Inc. / GAME FREAK inc.\n\nThe Google Maps Pin is a trademark of Google Inc. and the trade dress in the product design is a trademark of Google Inc. under license to The Pokémon Company.\n\nStart an adventure with Pikachu or Eevee as your partner!\n\nAt the start of your tale, you will encounter either Pikachu or Eevee. This Pikachu or Eevee will join you as your partner in your adventures, growing together with you on your journey.\n\nChoose your partner by choosing your game version—Pikachu will join you in Pokémon: Let’s Go, Pikachu! and Eevee will be your companion in Pokémon: Let’s Go, Eevee!\n\nSwing your Joy-Con to try to catch Pokémon!\n\nIn these games, you’ll be catching Pokémon in a whole new way. You only need one of your Joy-Con controllers to play the game. And when you run into one of the wild Pokémon that appear in the field, that’ll be your chance for a catch.\n\nTake your Joy-Con in hand and give it a swing to throw a Poké Ball—if all goes right, you’ll be able to catch the wild Pokémon that appear before you!\n\nWant to play with a friend? You’ll only need one game card!\n\nBy simply sharing one of your Joy-Con controllers, two players can adventure together in the world of Pokémon: Let’s Go, Pikachu! and Pokémon: Let’s Go, Eevee! Throw Poké Balls together when you encounter Pokémon to boost your chances of successfully catching them, or have a friend lend a hand by joining you in battles against Trainers in your game.\n\nThe Poké Ball Plus can be used to play Pokémon: Let’s Go, Pikachu! and Pokémon: Let’s Go, Eevee! in place of your Joy-Con. Naturally, it has motion controls—but it also lights up with a variety of colors, vibrates, and plays sounds. When you try to catch a Pokémon, you’ll feel it moving inside the Poké Ball. Feel the vibration, watch the lights, and hear the sounds—and if your catch is successful, get a thrill from hearing the cry of the Pokémon you just caught! As a controller, the Poké Ball Plus will bring a new level of fun and realism to these games!\n\nBut the Poké Ball Plus does more than just function as a controller. Choose to take one of your favorite Pokémon from these games for a stroll in your Poké Ball Plus, and you can bring it with you as you go about your daily life in the real world. You can spend time with your Pokémon even when you’re not playing Pokémon: Let’s Go, Pikachu! and Pokémon: Let’s Go, Eevee!—and you’ll be rewarded in various ways when you return them to your game!\n\nPlus, the Poké Ball Plus works as a Pokémon GO Plus. That’s a lot of pluses for one little Poké Ball!\n\nNotes: The Poké Ball Plus will be sold separately and is not included with Pokémon: Let’s Go, Pikachu! or Pokémon: Let’s Go, Eevee! At the time of its release, the Poké Ball Plus will only be compatible as a controller for Pokémon: Let’s Go, Pikachu! and Pokémon: Let’s Go, Eevee! It cannot be used for other Nintendo Switch software titles."
