        "text": "In Augmented Reality News\n\nNovember 26, 2021 – PIXELYNX, a new gaming venture focused on building a music metaverse that aims to transform the way artists connect and engage with fans through gaming experiences, has this week announced that it has signed a deal with Niantic, the company behind the popular mobile augmented reality (AR) game Pokémon GO. PIXELYNX will leverage Niantic’s recently announced Lightship Platform to develop a mobile app.\n\nPIXELYNX was created by musicians and technologists Joel Zimmerman (aka deadmau5) and Richie Hawtin, along with music and gaming industry veterans Ben Turner (Graphite; IMS: International Music Summit; AFEM: Association for Electronic Music), Dean Wilson (Seven20 Entertainment / mau5trap), and Inder Phull.\n\nPIXELYNX stated that by utilizing Lightship—Niantic’s augmented reality platform and accompanying AR developer kit (ARDK) that empowers developers to create engaging AR experiences that function on a global scale—the company will develop a mobile app version of its new gaming platform.\n\nPIXELYNX is aiming to create a new virtual world ecosystem that will allow music artists to launch their own interactive environments and monetize them through NFTs, playable experiences and virtual performances. Fans will be able to collect new songs, prizes and in-game assets through gameplay, as well as explore the real world, attending concerts and visiting physical locations to collect NFTs that can be used in-game to unlock rewards and new music, according to the company.\n\n“As we look towards launching our platform in 2022, the development of a mobile app that allows fans to collect new songs and NFTs in the real world was always part of our vision to create the music metaverse,” said Inder Phull, CEO and co-founder of PIXELYNX. “Teaming with Niantic on their Lightship ARDK to develop our mobile gaming app, will ensure that fans are able to take our game with them wherever they go, blending digital and real-world experiences and enriching the fan experience in completely unique ways.”\n\nFor more information on PIXELYNX and its music metaverse platform, please visit the company’s website.\n\nImage / video credit: PIXELYNX / YouTube"
