        "text": "So overall i like the app my only issue has been with hosting raids, I've hosted 4. 2 worked 2 did not work. My first try at the raid just when i got all the plays and was supposed to join the chat to invite everyone to the rsid I kept getting a error and couldnât do it, second one went great got the players, got into the chat, it sent out a thing in chat for everyone one to click to get in the raid went great caught Moltres. Third raid did everything the second did but for some reason it told me to invite all the players to the raid manually, by the time i was able to i had to back out cause i didnât get it done in time, fourth time worked. Overall i like the app but hopeful it will be like the second time around moving forward.\n\nSo Iâve used campfire for a while in hopes it helps with the problem with raiding in Pokemon go, especially in light of Nianticâs infamous decision with remote raids. I have a lucky egg going after finishing one gym and it show thereâs another close by thatâs said to be hosting a raid. So Iâve drove on over with nearly 4 minutes left in my lucky egg thinking Iâll make it and complete the raid with additional XP. Turns out to my surprised, the location is on private property of sort and going in would be trespassing. But the salt to the wound, no gym with no raid at all. So Iâve wasted time, gas, and my lucky egg for nothing. The closest other gym was over 12 minutes away and I couldnât be able to pause my lucky egg timer in time. So yeah donât trust this garbage app completely as it will lie to you, waste your time gas and everything in between, and you could potentially trespass in private property all for a gym that doesnât exist. Niantic if youâre listening, fix your garbage excuse of a community app, you own it to yourselves after milking your playerbase of its money and location data\n\nDonât get me wrong campfire is a great idea. Issue is it came out 7 years after launch so we all formed our own communities or use other raid hosting apps. Meaning that the community is still dispersed over multiple apps and you typically still need to have messenger, discord, poke genie and campfire to raid in your surrounding areas.\n\nMy other critique is as an App campfire is clunky and isnât very helpful. For example I get a ton of app notifications from my friends, I click on them, brings me to update the app, after updating I open the app then canât find the messages lol. Itâs just like if you want to make this a social app make the feed a bit easier, and if you want the raid community back give some incentive so we are using 4-5 mostly 3rd party apps to coordinate in game raids. 2 stars as I know they can and will do better but for now itâs just kind of annoying lol"
