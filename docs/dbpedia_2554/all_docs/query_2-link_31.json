        "text": "Shares of Capcom Co. surged to a record on Tuesday after the Japanese company unveiled Monster Hunter Now, a new mobile game developed with Pokémon Go creator Niantic Inc.\n\nCapcom’s stock rose 9% in Tokyo, adding to a winning streak that’s seen the company quadruple its value over the past four years. The Osaka-based creator of Resident Evil and Street Fighter is Japan’s top maker of big-budget titles for consoles and PCs, and franchises like Monster Hunter have helped it sustain momentum even without monetizing the mobile games arena as well as competitors."
