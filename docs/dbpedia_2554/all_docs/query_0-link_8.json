        "text": "For as much as PokÃ©mon GO may feel like an overnight success, itâs actually been decades in the making. The combined popularity of the video games, playing cards, and television show cemented PokÃ©mon as a major part of 90s pop cultureâwhich means Nintendo already had nostalgia on their side.\n\nâWhat has helped make PokÃ©mon GO so successful is its very broad target audience,\" said Adam Wallraff, lead iOS Development instructor at Code Fellows. âIâm in my early 30âs and remember playing the original Red and Blue version on my gameboy as a kid. But I also have young nieces and nephews, as well as older coworkers, who all equally enjoy this game.â\n\nThe PokÃ©mon GO inception\n\nIn fall of 2004, Google purchased Keyhole, John Hankeâs geospatial software company that could show users satellite imagery of any spot on earth. Hanke helped launch Google Earth in 2005, and got the app onto the first iPhone. Five years later, after successfully experimenting with combining gaming and mapping software early in his career, Hanke was given the go ahead to create a secret gaming project inside Google called Niantic Labs.\n\nAs they dabbled in augmented reality, Niantic Labs released a game in 2012 called Ingress, a location-based, massive multiplayer mobile game. And while it didnât become a huge success outside of Google, the software behind it became the foundation for something bigger.\n\nIn 2014, Google engineer Tatsuo Nomurawas brainstorming an April Fools Day joke to allow Maps users to hunt for PokÃ©mon. It caught the eye of Hanke, who adopted the project under Niantic.\n\nBecause of the impending launch of Alphabet, Inc., Google allowed Niantic Labs to seek outside investors in the summer of 2015. Niantic received $35 million in funding from Google, Nintendo, and the Pokemon Co., among other angel investors, and continued to work on PokÃ©mon GO until it launched in July 2016.\n\nThe Popularization of AR\n\nNaturally, this reimagined quest to capture digital critters has app developers wondering about the environment for the appâs unparalleled success, and what it suggests about the future of software.\n\nPerhaps most significantly, PokÃ©mon GO has popularized the concept of augmented reality (AR), where virtual objects are geolocated and visualized in the real world by a vast network of mobile users. Tim Merel, founder and CEO of Digi-Capital, recently predicted that AR will be a $90 billion market by 2020. And as youâd expect, the functionality of this alternate, digital universe will be dependent upon the work of coders.\n\nâPokÃ©mon GO and Snapchat have shown how AR can potentially be a competitor for virtual reality VR,â Wallraff said. âI like the idea that instead of VR, where some people have been known to get motion/sea sick, AR allows for the user to feel comfortable in a familiar environment, but with new entities around them to interact with. I believe that AR could have a much larger impact on technologyâ¦People like familiar, but with a twist.â\n\nAn Opportunity for Developers\n\nWith new investors jumping to be the first to bring AR to their respective markets, modules and extensions of all kinds will soon become a common means for companies to tie physical experiences into their existing apps and other products.\n\nâPokÃ©mon GO is significant because itâs the first AR game thatâs attached to a large brand,â said Duncan Marsh, a Code Fellows instructor who has taught students in both mobile and web app development. âItâs finally brought AR to the headlines and Iâm sure it will open doors for many creative startups to get the funding they need to change the world in incredible ways.â\n\nLarger brands like Coca Cola, Sears, and The New York Times have already dipped their toes into the opportunity presented by AR, with implementation possibilities ranging from relatively simple (piggybacking off Google Maps) to highly complex and customizable. As such, AR reveals a substantial market for supporting apps, and developers from around the world have already capitalized on this phenomenon to some extent, through products including radar apps and wearables.\n\nThus, a fun, data-rich game about monsters may eventually be remembered (at least in part) as a watershed moment for the consumer engagement possibilities offered by the Internet of Things; an important experiment in closing the online-to-offline loop.\n\nSo rather than indulging the pessimism that building âthe nextâ PokÃ©mon GO is out of reach for any average coder, this game should be a tantalizing reminder that the possibilities for software development remain as emergent and lucrative as ever."
