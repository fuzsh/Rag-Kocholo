Scroll down to see the full list of investigations – which involve potential violations of various federal and state laws – and sign up if you are affected.\n\nWhat Am I Signing Up For, Exactly?\n\nYou’re signing up for what’s known as “mass arbitration,” which involves hundreds or thousands of consumers bringing individual arbitration claims against the same company at the same time and over the same issue.

When bundled with a user’s Facebook ID, this information could potentially be enough to identify a specific individual and whether they bought a grisly shooter, a puzzle game for kids or anything in between.\n\nDid you purchase a video game on HumbleBundle.com for yourself or a child within the past two years?Depending on the game, your purchase data may be covered under a federal privacy law. Use the link below to learn more and join others taking action.\n\nHumble Bundle Users Sign Up Here\n\nPUBG Mobile Investigation Looks into Possible Privacy Violations\n\nAttorneys have reason to believe that PUBG Mobile, the mobile version of the popular battle royale game PUBG: Battlegrounds, may be violating federal privacy law by secretly sharing players’ data with Facebook.\n\nThey suspect that the app—without users’ knowledge or permission—may be using a tracking tool to transmit details about their in-game activities and identifiers that can be tied to their individual Facebook profiles.\n\nNow, attorneys want to take legal action against the video game’s publisher and are gathering affected customers to participate—that is, Facebook users who are 18 or older, downloaded PUBG Mobile and made an in-app purchase within the past two years. If that sounds like you, use the link below to join others taking action.\n\nPUBG Mobile Players Sign Up Here\n\nUbisoft Sharing Your Data?\n\nHave you bought video games on Ubisoft.com? Whether you’re into Tom Clancy or Avatar, Facebook could be tracking what you play.\n\nAttorneys suspect that the video game publisher behind Assassin’s Creed, Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six, Prince of Persia and more could be using tracking tools on its website to transmit users’ personal information to Facebook, including the titles of the video games they buy. The attorneys believe the purchase of certain games—specifically, those with cutscenes—may be covered by a federal privacy law and are gathering affected users to take legal action against Ubisoft.\n\nIf you’re 18 or older, have a Facebook account, and purchased a video game with cut scenes on Ubisoft.com for yourself or a child within the past two years, use the link below to join others taking action.\n\nUbisoft Users Sign Up Here\n\nRec Room Investigation: Privacy Violations?\n\nIn Rec Room, users can interact with one another as they participate in multiplayer games and explore player-created rooms. The video game uses voice moderation systems to monitor voice chat in public rooms for inappropriate speech, but attorneys believe this software may illegally collect and store players’ unique voiceprints in the process.\n\nThey suspect that Rec Room may have violated the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act by capturing this data without providing required disclosures and obtaining proper consent.\n\nIf you (18 or older) or your child (13 or older) played Rec Room and used voice chat in a public room within the past two years, click the link below to join other Illinois residents taking legal action against the game.\n\nRec Room Players Sign Up Here\n\nGameFly Data Sharing Legal Investigation\n\nWhen Congress passed the Video Privacy Protection Act (VPPA) in 1988, the law was meant to prohibit video rental companies—like Blockbuster, for example—from disclosing what people watch without permission. Though gone are the days of these brick-and-mortar stores, attorneys believe the VPPA may apply to—and have been broken by—video game rental service GameFly.com.\n\nSpecifically, the attorneys think that GameFly may be using invisible web-tracking tools to secretly collect information about users’ interactions with the site, including which video games they rent or buy. They suspect the company may send this data to Facebook along with other personally identifiable information for advertising purposes.\n\nThe attorneys are now gathering GameFly.com users to take legal action, so if you’re a Facebook user who rented or bought a video game on the site within the past two years, use the link below to join others signing up.\n\nGameFly Users Sign Up Here\n\nLegal Investigation: Is the Asphalt 9: Legends App Sharing Your Data?\n\nThose who play Asphalt 9: Legends may want to hit the brakes, because attorneys are investigating the app for possible violations of federal privacy law.\n\nSpecifically, attorneys believe the racing video game may be illegally tracking mobile players’ in-game activities and sharing this information with Facebook for advertising purposes. These transmissions may also include data points the social media giant can use to reveal a user’s identity.\n\nDid you download Asphalt 9: Legends and make an in-app purchase within the past two years?If you’re also a Facebook user who’s 18 or older, use the link below to join others taking action against the game’s publisher.\n\nAsphalt 9: Legends Players Sign Up Here\n\nIs Pokémon Go Tracking Your Data?\n\nPokémon Go, the immensely popular augmented reality game that took the world by storm upon its release in 2016, initially made headlines for exposing players to unintended risks—such as leading them into dangerous real-world areas or increasing traffic accidents—but attorneys are now looking into possible privacy risks from within the game itself.\n\nSpecifically, they believe game developer Niantic, which published Pokémon Go in collaboration with Nintendo and The Pokémon Company, may be using software to track players’ in-game activities and share the data with Facebook for advertising purposes. It’s possible that this data could be covered by a federal privacy law that prohibits the disclosure of consumers’ personal information without their consent—and that players could potentially have legal claims worth up to $2,500.\n\nThe attorneys are now gathering Pokémon Go players to take legal action against Niantic via mass arbitration.\n\nHave you downloaded and played Pokémon Go and made an in-app purchase within the past two years? If you’re 18 or older and have a Facebook account, join others taking action by filling out the form at the link below.\n\nPokémon Go Players Sign Up Here\n\nMonopoly Go! Sharing Your Info with Facebook?\n\nCalling all tycoons! We know you love to collect your rent – but how do you feel about having your data collected?\n\nAttorneys working with ClassAction.org suspect the company behind the Monopoly Go! mobile board game app may be using tracking software to secretly log players’ in-game activities and transmit the data – along with certain personal information – to Facebook for advertising purposes. This suspected data-sharing practice may violate a federal privacy law known as the Video Privacy Protection Act (VPPA) – and attorneys are now gathering players to take action. Under the VPPA, consumers who had their information shared without consent could have legal claims worth up to $2,500.\n\nSo, if you downloaded Monopoly Go!, made an in-app purchase within the past two years and had a Facebook account at the time, join others taking action. Simply fill out the form using the link below to sign up.\n\nMonopoly Go Players Sign Up Here\n\nBlizzard (Battle.net) Privacy Investigation\n\nDid you purchase World of Warcraft, a new subscription to World of Warcraft or Diablo IV for yourself or your child from the Battle.net store? If so, your purchase and/or subscription history may have been illegally shared with Facebook. Attorneys believe the provisions of the VPPA may apply to the purchase of certain video games and are now gathering affected consumers to take action via mass arbitration.\n\nSo, if you’re a Facebook user who purchased Diablo IV, World of Warcraft or a new World of Warcraft subscription on Battle.net for either yourself or a child in the past two years, join others taking action. Simply fill out the form using the link below to sign up.\n\nBattle.net Users Sign Up Here\n\nAttorneys Investigate Call of Duty: Mobile Over Suspected Data Sharing\n\nIn 2019, Call of Duty: Mobile saw one of the most successful mobile game launches in history with more than 100 million downloads in its first week. Attorneys believe, however, that those who have played the first-person shooter game and made in-app purchases within the past two years may have had their private information illegally shared.\n\nThey have reason to suspect that Call of Duty: Mobile may be using a tracking tool to secretly send data about players’ interactions with the video game to Facebook along with other personally identifying information.\n\nThis suspected data-sharing practice may violate federal privacy law, and attorneys want to start a mass arbitration against the app’s publisher, Activision.\n\nAre you a Facebook user who has downloaded Call of Duty: Mobile and made an in-app purchase (such as a skin or Battle Pass) within the past two years? If you’re also 18+, join others taking action.\n\nCall of Duty: Mobile Players Sign Up Here\n\nWhat Am I Signing Up For, Exactly?\n\nYou are not signing up for a lawsuit, but rather a process known as mass arbitration. This is a relatively new legal technique that, like a class action lawsuit, allows a large group of people to take action and seek compensation from a company over an alleged wrongdoing. Here is a quick explanation of mass arbitration from our blog:\n\n[M]ass arbitration occurs when hundreds or thousands of consumers file individual arbitration claims against the same company over the same issue at the same time. The aim of a mass arbitration proceeding is to grant relief on a large scale (similar to a class action lawsuit) for those who sign up.”\n\nSome companies’ terms of use may contain a class action waiver and/or an arbitration clause requiring users to resolve disputes via arbitration, a form of alternative dispute resolution that takes place outside of court before a neutral arbitrator, as opposed to a judge or jury. It’s for this reason that attorneys working with ClassAction.org have decided to handle these matters as mass arbitrations rather than class action lawsuits.\n\nHow Much Does This Cost?\n\nIt costs nothing to sign up, and you’ll only need to pay if the attorneys win money on your behalf. Their payment will come as a percentage of your award.\n\nIf they don’t win your claim, you don’t pay.\n\nPrevious Investigations\n\nThe following investigations are complete, and attorneys are no longer signing up affected consumers.\n\nMinecraft Privacy Investigation\n\nDid you use Minecraft.net to purchase a Minecraft game for yourself or your minor child? If so, your purchase history may have been unlawfully shared with Facebook. Attorneys believe that the VPPA may extend to the purchase of certain video games and are now gathering people to take action against Microsoft.\n\nLegal Investigation: Does Papaya Rig its Mobile Games?\n\nPapaya Gaming advertises its mobile games—including Solitaire Cash, Bubble Cash, Bingo Cash, Cookie Cash and 21 Cash—as “totally fair and skill-based,” but attorneys seem to think otherwise.\n\nThey suspect Papaya may secretly pit players against computer bots disguised as human opponents, even when money is on the line. It’s believed that Papaya may use these bots to control the outcome of each contest, turning these so-called “skill-based” competitions into manipulated games of chance where the company gets to pocket winnings whenever it chooses.\n\nThe attorneys are now looking to take legal action on behalf of people who may have been defrauded by Papaya due to potential game rigging.\n\nCSR Racing 2 Privacy Investigation\n\nCSR Racing 2 players who made in-app purchases within the past couple of years may have had their privacy violated, according to attorneys working with ClassAction.org.\n\nThey believe the popular drag racing game—which allows users to spend money on new cars, upgrades, customization and other perks—may have used tracking tools to share players’ private information with Facebook. It’s possible that these covert transmissions may include details about users’ in-game activities and identifiers that can be tied to their individual Facebook profiles.\n\nIs NBA 2K Mobile Sharing Your Data? Attorneys Investigate\n\nIn NBA 2K Mobile, players call the shots. They can choose starting lineups, control the gameplay of NBA superstars, customize their team’s gear and more. Nevertheless, attorneys believe one part of the basketball video game may be beyond a user’s reach: how their data is handled.\n\nThey suspect the app may be using tracking tools to secretly send information about players’ in-app activities to Facebook for advertising purposes. It’s possible that the game may also be sharing identifiers that can be tied to their individual Facebook profiles.\n\nDid RockstarGames.com Violate Your Privacy?\n\nWhether you’re pulling off a heist in Grand Theft Auto V or fighting alongside a gang of outlaws in Red Dead Redemption 2, you may want to watch your back—not just for cops and bounty hunters, but for potential privacy violations.\n\nAttorneys working with ClassAction.org believe RockstarGames.com—where players can purchase the latest GTA, Red Dead Redemption and more—may be using tracking tools to secretly collect users’ personal information and share it with Facebook for advertising. Among the data potentially getting shared are players’ purchase histories, and the attorneys believe this information may be covered by a federal privacy law that protects consumers from the unauthorized disclosure of their personal information.\n\n2K Privacy Investigation\n\nOn 2K.com, users can browse every video game the publisher has to offer, including popular series like NBA 2K, WWE 2K and Borderlands. But players be warned: Attorneys suspect that secret tracking tools may send Facebook data about customers as they navigate 2K.com, including which video games they purchase and any private information they input into the site.\n\nThe attorneys believe the VPPA may extend to the purchase of certain video games—specifically ones with cutscenes—and are now gathering players to take legal action against 2K’s parent company, Take-Two Interactive.\n\nMadden NFL Mobile: Privacy Violations?\n\nNow in its tenth season, EA Sports’ Madden NFL Mobile lets players build a team and compete toward a Super Bowl title, all in the palm of their hand. However, attorneys believe players’ privacy could be at risk—specifically, that the mobile game could be sharing their personal data with Facebook for advertising purposes.\n\nThe attorneys are now gathering Madden NFL Mobile players to band together to take legal action against EA over possible violations of a federal privacy law.\n\nEA Sports FC Mobile: Data Privacy Investigation\n\nEA Sports FC Mobile brings the world’s top players, clubs and leagues right to a user’s phone or tablet—but while players are immersed in “the world’s game,” could their private information be getting shared with Facebook?\n\nAttorneys believe tracking tools within the popular mobile game could be collecting and sharing data about players’ in-game activities along with identifiers tied to their Facebook profiles. They’re now gathering users to take legal action against EA over potential violations of a federal privacy law.\n\nElectronic Arts Investigation: Was Your Data Shared?\n\nElectronic Arts, the publisher behind The Sims, Medal of Honor, Battlefield and EA Sports titles FIFA, NBA Live and more, is being investigated by attorneys for potential violations of a federal privacy law.\n\nThey believe EA.com may be secretly sharing consumers’ purchase information with Facebook via tracking tools, which could give the social media giant insight into players’ interests and activities for advertising purposes. It’s possible that this purchase data—specifically, for video games that include cutscenes—may be covered under the federal Video Privacy Protection Act, and the attorneys are now gathering gamers to take legal action against EA.\n\nThe Sims FreePlay Legal Investigation: Was Your Privacy Violated?\n\nIn The Sims FreePlay, which is available to download for free on the App Store, Google Play and Amazon Appstore, the possibilities are endless. You can put on a cabaret, grow a family, fall in love and even build a superyacht. But is it also possible that Facebook and Meta are collecting data about you and how you interact with the game?\n\nAttorneys working with ClassAction.org have reason to believe EA Inc., publisher of the popular life-simulation game, may be using tracking tools on The Sims FreePlay app to secretly gather and transmit players’ personal information to Facebook for advertising purposes. This data potentially includes unique Facebook IDs, which can be used to match players’ in-game activities to their individual Facebook profiles. Attorneys suspect that these potential data-sharing practices may violate a federal privacy law and are now gathering players to take action.\n\nEA UFC Mobile 2: Data Privacy Investigation\n\nEA Sports’ UFC Mobile 2 lets players put their fighting abilities to the test—but is your time in the Octagon being tracked?\n\nAttorneys believe the mixed martial arts fighting game could be using tracking software to keep tabs on users’ activities as they navigate the game—and then sharing the data with Facebook to use for advertising. Specifically, they suspect that players’ names, phone numbers, email addresses and other personal information could be getting shared with Facebook along with each person’s in-game activities. It’s possible that Electronic Arts, the game’s publisher, may have violated a federal privacy law called the Video Privacy Protection Act by disclosing players’ data without their permission, and the attorneys are now gathering users to take legal action."
