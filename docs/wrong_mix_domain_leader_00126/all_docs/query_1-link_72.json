Mr. Rasmussen was promoted to Minister of Economic Affairs in 1990 and served as the Danish negotiator of and signatory to the Maastricht Treaty, which eventually led to the introduction of the single currency, the euro. In 1998, Mr. Rasmussen became chairman of the Liberal Party and leader of the Danish opposition.\n\nIn the 2001 parliamentary elections, his party won a landslide victory and became the biggest party in the Danish parliament. He formed his first government, and became Prime Minister of a coalition consisting of the Liberal Party and the Conservative People’s Party. His government was re-elected in 2005 and 2007 respectively, and he held the position as Prime Minister until he was elected as future NATO Secretary General at the Strasbourg-Kehl Summit in April 2009. Mr. Rasmussen took office as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s twelfth Secretary General on 1 August 2009 and held that position until 30 September 2014.\n\nOn 1 October 2014 Mr. Rasmussen established Rasmussen Global. The firm advises clients on a wide range of issues such as international security, transatlantic relations, the European Union, and emerging markets. Rasmussen Global draws on an extensive network of leading policy experts, former officials, business executives and consulting firms across the globe.\n\nOn 1 June 2016 Mr. Rasmussen was appointed advisor to the President of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko."
