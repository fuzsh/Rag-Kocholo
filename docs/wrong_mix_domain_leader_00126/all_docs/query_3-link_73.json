        "text": "Feb. 24 marked two years since Russia invaded neighboring Ukraine. The conflict has changed the face of Europe and set off a protracted war that has had ramifications reaching far beyond its borders.\n\nCould Russian President Vladimir Putin’s strategy of waiting out the West prove successful, or can Western leaders rally to continue supporting a drawn-out war? What would a future peace deal look like?\n\nNATO’s former secretary-general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, argues that Western leaders need to continue to supply Ukraine with weapons—and quickly, before the war results in further instability. He joined FP’s Ravi Agrawal ahead of the war’s second anniversary to discuss the state of the conflict, the lessons learned, and what the future might hold for Ukraine.\n\nSuggested reading:\n\nFP Contributors: Two Years On, What’s Next in Ukraine"
