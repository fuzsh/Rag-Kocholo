        "text": "Last weekend marked 500 days since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine—a grim landmark that will hang over Vilnius, Lithuania, as leaders of 31 NATO countries assemble for the security alliance’s annual summit. While some member states, especially in Eastern Europe, continue to lobby for Ukraine’s accession to NATO, the United States has already made clear such a move is far-fetched while war remains underway. Even Sweden’s membership is up in the air, with Turkey playing spoiler once again: Ankara says the European Union should create a pathway for it to join the bloc before it agrees to support Stockholm’s bid.\n\nBeyond the fraught questions of membership, however, other issues of consequence will be up for discussion this week. It’s likely that NATO will update its defense posture and begin talks on offering Kyiv security commitments. Some of those plans have originated from the alliance’s former chief, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who has informally advised Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky."
