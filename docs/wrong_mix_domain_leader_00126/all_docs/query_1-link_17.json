        "text": "On Feb. 24, 2022—almost exactly two years ago—Russian President Vladimir Putin executed a plan that devastated Ukraine and posed to Europe its toughest challenge in a generation. The ensuing thrust-and-parry of war has often been described as a stalemate. Anders Fogh Rasmussen, a former secretary-general of NATO, says it’s incorrect to term the war a draw. Instead, he has written in Foreign Policy, the means to deliver a Ukrainian victory remain firmly in Western hands.\n\nBut how exactly can Europe and the United States succeed now when they haven’t before? What fate awaits Kyiv as the war enters its third year? For answers, FP’s Ravi Agrawal spoke with Rasmussen on FP Live.\n\nFew countries in the world are as adept at interpreting China’s foreign policy as Singapore. At this year’s Aspen Security Forum in Colorado, FP’s Ravi Agrawal sat down with Singaporean Defense Minister Ng Eng Hen. The two discussed the U.S.-China relationship as well as American soft power in Southeast Asia."
