Here’s a top Ukrainian official and former NATO leader’s game plan for the Vilnius summit.\n\nBy Katherine Walla\n\nAndriy Yermak and Anders Fogh Rasmussen detail what they expect from the Alliance at the Vilnius summit, from security guarantees to a clear pathway for membership.\n\nThe Atlantic Council hosted on June 21, 2023, a virtual #ACFrontPage conversation with former Secretary General of NATO Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who also previously served as Danish Prime Minister, and Andriy Yermak, head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, on steps Allies should take to help secure Ukraine’s security and how to lay the groundwork for a productive NATO Summit in July.\n\nThe first stage of Ukraine’s much-anticipated summer counteroffensive has commenced. Equipped with recently delivered Western armored vehicles, tanks, and ammunition, Ukrainian forces have made some advances on Russian defensive positions in occupied territories and are actively striking behind Russian lines. Given the circumstances of Russia’s ongoing war on Ukraine, the upcoming NATO Summit in Vilnius holds added significance, as Allies are expected to discuss the steps they will take to strengthen NATO’s relationship with Ukraine and ensure the country’s long-term security.\n\nWhile the Alliance’s preparations for the NATO Summit have so far indicated a focus on modest steps, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has publicly campaigned for Ukraine to join NATO as soon as possible along a clear timeline towards accession. PM Rasmussen offered a thought-provoking contribution to the debate on this subject when suggesting that some NATO countries, recognizing the critical importance of defeating Russian aggression, might consider sending troops to help defend Ukraine.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Rasmussen and Yermak, both authors of the Kyiv Security Compact, were joined by John Herbst, senior director of the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Center, for a virtual edition of #ACFrontPage.\n\nAn #ACFrontPage Event\n\nFeaturing\n\nIn conversation with\n\nFollow the conversation on Twitter with @ACEurasia and @AtlanticCouncil using #ACFrontPage"
