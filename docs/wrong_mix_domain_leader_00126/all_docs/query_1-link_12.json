        "text": "Mr. Rasmussen has been at the centre of European and global politics for three decades as Secretary General of NATO, Prime Minister of Denmark, Danish Minister of Economic Affairs, and a leading Danish parliamentarian.\n\nA reformer who made the Alliance leaner and more efficient, Mr. Rasmussen also extended and strengthened NATO’s partnerships with nations around the world, making it the hub of a network of international security partnerships. Upon leaving NATO, Mr. Rasmussen founded “Rasmussen Global”, which provides geopolitical and strategic consulting services and advises clients on international security, transatlantic relations, the European Union, and emerging markets. In June 2016, Mr. Rasmussen was appointed adviser to the President of Ukraine, Mr. Petro Poroshenko."
