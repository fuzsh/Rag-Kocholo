        "text": "Hillary made a swing through California and Canada the first week of March, was in New York at the U.N. on March 7, was in Montreal yesterday, and back in New York again today. At most of these stops she had some very strong words for Vladimir Putin and his land grabbing ways. Yet it appears that this now private citizen cannot spend 10 days out of the public eye without some concern troll inventing a health condition or making a tasteless remark like one I saw yesterday involving the missing airliner.\n\nBeginning her speech to the Association of American Publishers at Manhattan’s McGraw -Hill Conference Center today with a shout-out to WaPo’s In the Loop contest to suggest titles for her upcoming tome, Hillary offered tongue-in-cheek guidelines for would-be authors one of which was “quit your day job,” a recommendation she quickly revised.\n\nWhen Clinton wrote Living History, her 2003 title about her life up until that point, she was a U.S. senator and was overwhelmed by the amount of work necessary for doing her day job and writing a book in the evenings.\n\nThis time around, her departure from the State Department would provide her with the peace and quiet necessary to write a book:\n\n“I was leaving the State Department, stepping off that high wire of American diplomacy. There’d be no more interview requests, no more frantic media speculation about my plans — just peace and quiet. So I thought, let’s write another book. It has not worked out exactly that way,” she said, referring to the constant media speculation that she is planning on running for president in 2016.\n\nRead more guidelines >>>>\n\nAbsolutely, Hillary! It has not worked out exactly that way. At all!\n\nI combed Twitter for twitpics. The only one was this one from Amy Chozick of the New York Times. Being the only one, and especially high resolution for a twitpic, it went semi-viral.\n\nWe know that copies Lisa Rogak’s fine collection of Hillary quotes was being raffled off and hope the lucky winners are pleased with their prizes.\n\nMeanwhile, in D.C. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen was receiving the Hillary Rodham Clinton Award for Advancing Women in Peace and Security at Georgetown University.\n\nThe buzz around Cipriani in New York is that political heavy hitters will attend an AJC dinner this evening in Hillary’s honor but that one big name will be missing.\n\nPols planning to attend AJC dinner for @hillaryclinton tonight at Cipriani: Schumer, Schneiderman, Rangel, Maloney + more. No @deBlasioNYC.\n\nBest compliments, Mme. Secretary, for yet another well-earned honor!\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nWe have known for weeks that Hillary Clinton would be in Los Angeles next Wednesday to receive the Warren Christopher Public Service Award from the Pacific Council on International Relations. We did not know, however, that she would be honored last night at the Atlantic Council Awards dinner.\n\nHenry Kissinger presented her with the council’s Distinguished Leadership Award with a quip about “at least four” secretaries of state who went on to become president.* Apparently unfazed, Hillary responded, “When I became secretary of state, I spent a lot of time thinking about my illustrious predecessors – not primarily the ones who went on to become president.”\n\nAs secretary of state, Hillary often expressed her deep admiration for several of those predecessors While it has always seemed that George Marshall topped her list, we have seen a strong, cordial relationship develop between Hillary and Henry over the years as the photos attest. If the text of her remarks are released, I will add them here.\n\nBill Clinton presented an award to Tony Bennett. Also honored at the event was NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen.\n\nHere is a partial account from the Atlantic Council website. There are additional photos there as well.\n\nDistinguished Leadership Awards Offers Perfect Mix of Substance and Style\n\nFormer US President Bill Clinton presented the next award via video address for Distinguished Artistic Leaership to legendary performer and humanitarian Tony Bennett. President Clinton praised Bennett for his illustrious musical career, but also his significant work as an advocate and humanitarian. “As long as I’ve known him,” said President Clinton, “he has truly been a citizen of the world: an extraordinary individual who served his country in World War II, marched with Dr. Martin Luther King in Selma in 1965, and has devoted his generous spirit to charitable causes all across the globe.”\n\nThe final award for Distinguished International Leadership was presented to former First Lady, US Senator, and US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Secretary Clinton was presented with video tributes by President of Malawi Joyce Banda and internationally-renowned political activist Aung San Suu Kyi. She was introduced in person by former Secretary of State and National Security Advisor Dr. Henry Kissinger. Secretary Clinton accepted her award and delivered brief remarks on the state of the transatlantic alliance and the three primary challenges facing NATO in the coming decades: energy security, trade cooperation, and conflict readiness. Secretary Clinton seized the opportunity to endorse a comprehensive transatlantic trade agreement, and to stress that all members of NATO must redouble their efforts to promote transatlantic values around the world. “We cannot afford to let the greatest alliance in history slide into military irrelevance,” she urged.\n\nRead more >>>>\n\nClick on the playlist to find Hillary’s speech. (Wow! Did I ever hit the nail on the head with George Marshal! I did not even know what was in this speech!)\n\n*In case you wondered, it was six secretaries of state who went on to become president. The last was James Buchanan.\n\nRead Full Post »"
