        "text": "Anders Rasmussen (born January 26, 1953, Ginnerup, Denmark) is a Danish politician who served as prime minister of Denmark (2001–09), leader of the country’s Liberal Party (1998–2009), and secretary-general of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (2009–14).\n\nRasmussen became involved with Denmark’s Liberal Party at an early age, founding and leading a Young Liberals group at Viborg Cathedral School (1970–72) and eventually becoming the national chairman of this group (1974–76). In 1978 he received a masters degree in economics from the University of Århus and was elected to the Folketing (the Danish parliament) as a representative for the Liberal Party. He subsequently held various posts within the national party organization, including vice-chairman (1985–98) and political affairs spokesman (1992–98), before becoming chairman in 1998. He served as minister of taxation from 1987 to 1992 and as minister for economic affairs from 1990 to 1992.\n\nElected prime minister of a minority government in November 2001, Rasmussen lowered taxes and undertook major reforms in local government, welfare, and education. In the same year, the Liberal Party became the largest party in the country, a distinction long enjoyed by the Social Democrats. Following his reelection in 2005 and 2007, Rasmussen focused his efforts on education, research, and job growth. Although he was criticized for supporting the U.S.-led Iraq War (2003), he remained popular among voters. In April 2009, shortly after being selected secretary-general of NATO, Rasmussen resigned as prime minister; he was succeeded by Lars Løkke Rasmussen (no relation) of the Liberal Party. Anders Rasmussen assumed his post at NATO in August 2009; he served as secretary-general until 2014.\n\nHe wrote several books on economic and political topics."
