        "text": "Anders Fogh Rasmussen served three terms as Prime Minister of Denmark before becoming Secretary General of NATO in August 2009.\n\nOn a visit to London to discuss Afghan war strategy with British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, he joins Sir David to talk about the conflict in Afghanistan, the breakdown of crisis talks in Bosnia and NATO expansion.\n\nJose Maria Aznar was Prime Minister of Spain for eight years, and he committed the country’s troops to both the Iraq War and the war in Afghanistan.\n\nHis successor, Mr Zapatero, pulled them out of Iraq, but Spanish troops remain in Afghanistan.\n\nCanadian singer/songwriter Martha Wainwright has a remarkable musical heritage.\n\nDaughter of folk singer Kate McGarrigle and 60s icon Loudon Wainwright III, Martha and her older brother Rufus, have both carved out hugely successful music careers in their own right.\n\nMartha has just recorded her third album, a tribute to France’s most famous singer, Edith Piaf.\n\nWhen suicide bombers attacked London on July 7th in 2005, Andy Hayman was the police chief in charge of UK’s counter-terrorism operations.\n\nJust a year later, he was part of one of Britain’s largest surveillance operations.\n\nHe joins Sir David to talk about his new book, “The Terrorist Hunters”.\n\nFinally, how much of a role does fate or fortune have in our lives?\n\nSir David talks to professor Richard Wiseman who has studied the principles of good and bad luck."
