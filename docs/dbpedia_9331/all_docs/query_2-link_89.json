        "text": "Geography\n\nThe Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is a landlocked country in South Asia to the west of the Himalayas and covers an area of 652,860 square kilometers. This land area is approximately 94% of the area of Texas. The country shares its borders with 6 neighboring countries: China in the far north-east, Pakistan to the south, Iran and Turkmenistan to the west and Uzbekistan and Tajikistan to the north.\n\nThe distinctive mountainous landscape is mainly characterized by the Hindu Kush Mountains, which run right through the country. In the north and center of the country, there are numerous plateaus and mountain foothills that are difficult to access. The average altitude of Afghanistan is 1885 meters above sea level, making it one of the highest countries in the world. The highest mountain peak is the Noshak with an altitude of 7,485 meters on the border with Pakistan.\n\nThe south and southwest consist mainly of sparsely vegetated sand and clay deserts. The area is supplied with water exclusively by the Helmand, the longest river in Afghanistan.\n\nClimate in Afghanistan\n\nIt has a continental to subtropical climate with cold winters and hot summers, which varies considerably due to the pronounced differences in altitude. In the mountainous regions of the Hindu Kush, winters are particularly harsh and temperatures below freezing with heavy snowfall are common at high altitudes. It is significantly hotter in the lowlands and southern plains, with temperatures often rising to over 40 Â°C in summer.\n\nRainfall varies greatly, with the majority falling in winter and spring, when low-pressure systems from the Mediterranean bring large volumes of water and storms. The east of the country, on the other hand, lies in the rain shadow of the mountains and receives less precipitation. The desert areas near the Iranian border usually remain extremely dry.\n\nAverage daytime and nighttime temperatures\n\nDetailed climate data for Afghanistan and 6 individual regions\n\nEarthquakes"
