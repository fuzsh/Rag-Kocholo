        "text": "The CPSD recommends that the government improve the governance of the country’s high potential natural resources sectors— namely, mining, forestry, and agribusiness. This will generate the fiscal resources necessary to invest, through public-private partnerships (PPPs), in the enabling sectors of transport, power, telecom, water, finance, education, and health. Development in these areas in turn will unleash productive investment opportunities in other key sectors, such as manufacturing and digital services.\n\nBuilding on the recent reforms of their legal framework, promoting private investment in enabling sectors will require operationalizing regulatory agencies, reforming state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and reinforcing the country’s PPP framework. Finally, the report recommends simplifying and digitalizing taxes, reforming commercial justice and land property rights, and improving policy making governance by reinforcing the Technical Committee for Reform (Comité Technique de Réformes).\n\nDownload\n\nExecutive Summary (English) Full Report (English)"
