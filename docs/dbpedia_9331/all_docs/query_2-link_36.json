        "text": "The Taliban has completed its sweep of the country's south, taking four more provincial capitals in a lightning offensive that is gradually encircling Kabul.\n\nIn just 24 hours, the country's second and third-largest cities — Herat in the west and Kandahar in the south — have fallen to the insurgents, as has the capital of the southern Helmand province, where allied forces fought some of the bloodiest battles.\n\nThe blitz through the Taliban's southern heartland means the insurgents now hold half of Afghanistan's 34 provincial capitals and control more than two-thirds of the country — weeks before the US plans to withdraw its last troops.\n\nThe Western-backed government in the capital, Kabul, still holds a smattering of provinces in the centre and east, as well as the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif.\n\nWhile Kabul isn't directly under threat yet, the resurgent Taliban were battling government forces in Logar province, some 80 kilometres from the capital.\n\nThe US military has estimated that Kabul could come under insurgent pressure within 30 days and that the Taliban could overrun the rest of the country within a few months.\n\nThey have already taken over much of the north and west of the country.\n\nIn the south, the insurgents swept through the three provincial capitals on Friday.\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres made his first appeal directly to the Taliban on Friday, urging the group to immediately halt its offensive, warning that \"Afghanistan is spinning out of control\".\n\n\"This is the moment to halt the offensive. This is the moment to start serious negotiation. This is the moment to avoid a prolonged civil war, or the isolation of Afghanistan,\" Mr Guterres told reporters.\n\nThe Pentagon said on Friday that by the end of the weekend most of the additional 3,000 US troops temporarily heading to Afghanistan to help protect embassy staff would be in Kabul.\n\n\"I expect that by the end of the weekend the bulk of the 3,000 that we talked about yesterday will be in place,\" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said.\n\n'A city under siege'\n\nAustralian journalist Lynne O'Donnell told the ABC that civil unrest is becoming increasingly likely as the situation deteriorates.\n\n\"The Taliban now have the capital surrounded and many people here feel it's just a matter of time before the attacks on Kabul itself begin,\" she said.\n\n\"I think that in the short to medium term there will be shortages of food and fuel because the Taliban have taken control of the border points as well and imports are not getting through.\n\nAttaullah Afghan, the head of the provincial council in Helmand, said that the Taliban captured Lashkar Gah following weeks of heavy fighting and raised their white flag over governmental buildings.\n\nHe said three national army bases outside of the city remain under control of the government.\n\nAtta Jan Haqbayan, the provincial council chief in Zabul province, said the local capital of Qalat fell and that officials were in a nearby army camp preparing to leave.\n\nBismillah Jan Mohammad and Qudratullah Rahimi, politicians from Uruzgan province, said local officials surrendered Tarin Kot, where Australian forces were based.\n\nTaliban fighters paraded through a main square there, driving a Humvee and a pickup seized from Afghan security forces.\n\nIn the country's west, meanwhile, Fazil Haq Ehsan, head of the provincial council in Ghor province, said its capital Feroz Koh also fell to the insurgents.\n\nThe United States will send 3,000 troops to help evacuate some personnel from its embassy in Kabul.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison said Australia was \"liaising\" with the US and other allies to evacuate people.\n\n\"We will be working closely with them including, when necessary using Australian Defence Force personnel to assist in securing that outcome,\" Mr Morrison said.\n\nBritain said about 600 troops would be deployed to help British nationals leave the country, and Canada is sending special forces to help evacuate its embassy.\n\nTaliban parade accused theives in public\n\nThousands have fled their homes amid fears the Taliban will return Afghanistan to the sort of brutal, repressive rule it imposed when it was last in power at the turn of the millennium.\n\nAt that time, the group all but eliminated women's rights and conducted public executions as it imposed an unsparing version of Islamic law.\n\nAn early sign of such tactics came in Herat, where insurgents paraded two alleged looters through the streets on Friday with black makeup smeared on their faces.\n\nPeace talks in Qatar between the Taliban and the government remain stalled, though diplomats are still meeting, as the US, European and Asian nations warned that battlefield gains would not lead to political recognition.\n\n\"We demand an immediate end to attacks against cities, urge a political settlement, and warn that a government imposed by force will be a pariah state,\" said Zalmay Khalilzad, the US envoy to the talks.\n\nBut the Taliban advance continued.\n\nHasibullah Stanikzai, the head of the Logar provincial council, said fighting was still underway inside Puli-e Alim, with government forces holding the police headquarters and other security facilities.\n\nHe spoke by phone from his office, and gunfire could be heard in the background. The Taliban, however, said they had captured the police headquarters and a nearby prison.\n\nThe onslaught represents a stunning collapse of Afghan forces after the United States spent nearly two decades and billions of dollars trying to establish a functioning state.\n\nUS forces toppled the Taliban in the wake of the September 11 attacks, which Al Qaeda planned and executed while being sheltered by the Taliban government.\n\nCivilians flee as highways are closed\n\nThe fighters now advancing across the country ride on American-made Humvees and carry M-16s pilfered from Afghan forces.\n\nA day earlier, in Herat, Taliban fighters rushed past the Great Mosque in the historic city and seized government buildings.\n\nHerat had been under militant attack for two weeks, with one wave blunted by the arrival of warlord Ismail Khan and his forces.\n\nBut on Thursday afternoon, Taliban fighters broke through the city's defensive lines.\n\nThe insurgents circulated photos and a video showing Mr Khan in their captivity as well as video footage that appeared to show two Afghan military Black Hawk helicopters — provided by the US — that were captured in Herat.\n\nIn Kandahar, insurgents seized the governor's office and other buildings, witnesses said, adding that the governor and other officials fled the onslaught.\n\nThey spoke on condition of anonymity because the defeat has yet to be acknowledged by the government, which has not commented on the latest advances.\n\nThe Taliban had earlier attacked a prison in Kandahar and freed inmates inside, officials said.\n\nThe UN agency for humanitarian affairs warned that civilians in southern Afghanistan faced cut-off highways and mobile phone outages.\n\nIt described aid groups as being unable to determine how many people had fled as intense fighting and airstrikes continued there."
