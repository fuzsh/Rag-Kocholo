        "text": "17-year-old activist Muzhda Akbari writes about growing up in Afghanistan and her hopes for the future.\n\nLife in Afghanistan before the Taliban takeover was a rollercoaster ride of emotions. It was a world of sharp contrasts, where discrimination and violence coexisted with joy and hope for a better future. As a child growing up in this ongoing war, I learned to laugh and play amidst the chaos, but the harsh realities of being an Afghan girl would come to shape the course of my life.\n\nAs a little girl, I remember dreaming of a better future, one full of endless possibilities and adventures. At school, I would close my eyes and imagine myself as a doctor or even the future president of Afghanistan. The thought of leading my country and transforming it into a place free from pain and suffering filled me with exhilaration. I dreamed of a world where no family would cry because of war, and every child would have the freedom to dream and pursue their goals.\n\nBut as I grew older, reality set in. After the forced marriage of my best friend, I was shaken to the core and began to see the constraints placed on Afghan girls. It was hard to accept that some people didn’t care about these limitations or how they affected us. It was then that I realized that if I ever became the president of Afghanistan, I would make it my mission to ensure that no child was ever forced into marriage again and that no girl would ever have to feel fear just for being a girl.\n\nMy family and I were living in the beautiful countryside behind the mountains, but one day in 2017. we woke up to find that war had come to our doorstep. Like many other families, we were forced to leave our homes and move to Kabul, the capital city. Kabul was a city of opportunity, but it was also a city of fear and suicide attacks. Every day was a struggle to survive, and with every suicide attack, I imagined myself being caught in the next one.\n\nDespite the dangers, I loved my studies in Kabul. The schools were beautiful, and I made friends from different cities in Afghanistan who spoke different languages and had different beliefs. It was amazing to see how big and beautiful our country was. I even took a course where boys and girls studied together in the same classroom. This experience gave me courage and confidence to read my speeches in front of everyone. I felt even more confident when I received the highest marks in my class.\n\nSometimes, my friends and I would go to cafes in Kabul to share stories and laugh. In the morning, I would go running with other women, and some of them even taught me how to ride a bicycle. Seeing women in markets, offices, parliament, television, parks, parties and even driving cars gave me hope and inspired me to believe in myself and my abilities as a woman.\n\nI often wondered what would happen if Afghan women and girls could realize all their rights. What if every Afghan girl could go to school and university and have the same opportunities as boys? I hoped and believed that this future was within reach. A future where we were all equal and could work together for the development of our country.\n\nBut then on August 15, 2021, everything changed. The sun of my hopes and dreams set forever. I woke up to what felt like the sound of the whole city shouting: \"Hey Muzhda, your biggest nightmares have come to life: the Taliban took your Afghanistan.\" It was a day that will forever be etched in my memory, a day that shattered my hopes and dreams for a better future.\n\nThe Taliban takeover of Afghanistan was a crushing blow to all of us who believed in the promise of a brighter tomorrow. It was a return to the past, a time when women and girls were oppressed and silenced, and hope was just a distant memory. But I refuse to let the Taliban break my spirit.\n\nI believe we all have the power to create change in this world and I will seek this change through education. I will read and write, which is what the Taliban fears the most. Through my knowledge, I am determined to be a force for good, to use my voice to speak out against oppression and to stand up for what is right. For the Taliban and others who seek to silence Afghan girls, our courage and determination are the most powerful weapons we have."
