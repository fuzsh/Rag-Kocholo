        "text": "Afghanistan’s politics are the product of a diverse society, two foreign invasions, and a patchwork of guerilla groups that fought to repel the invasions. Constant fighting and a stagnant economy led Afghanistan to be among the world’s leading countries of origin for refugees. The failure of competing victorious factions to share power following the victory of Afghan mujahadeen over the Soviet Union in 1989 made space for the rise of the Taliban, a militant group holding an extremist vision of Islam, who secured a loose hold over about 85 per cent of the country by 1996. After the attacks of September 11, 2001 on the United States (U.S.), the U.S. and its allies invaded and installed a new government. In the two decades that followed, the coalition never fully defeated the Taliban. Despite widespread international support, a peaceful change in executive power, and the entry of Afghan women into public life and civil society, the U.S.-backed government lost legitimacy, gaining a reputation for corruption, impunity, election fraud, and reliance on repression at a regional level. A renewed offensive by the Taliban after the U.S. agreed to withdraw led to retreats by the Afghan army, and the Taliban quickly retook control of the country.\n\nAfghanistan’s society is diverse, and its ethnic and religious groupings map imprecisely onto its politics. The Taliban is Sunni Muslim and fundamentalist, and predominantly Pashtun, the largest of Afghanistan’s ethnic groups at 42 per cent of the population. The other major ethnic groups include Tajiks, Hazaras, Uzbeks, Turkmen, and Baluchi. The Hazaras, the only majority Shia Muslim group, are a frequent target of the Taliban and the Islamic State Khorasan (ISIS-K), which competes with the Taliban. The Taliban has also shown divisions between the more conservative leadership based in Kandahar and more accommodationist officials in Kabul. The Taliban’s suppression of women’s rights including their involvement in public life and girls’ right to education, divides them from the professional class that developed under the U.S.-backed government. The Taliban’s repression has also manifested through the resumption of public executions and intensifying crackdown on civil society. With the current crisis, exacerbated by the economic and climate shocks, over 5 million people are displaced and nearly half the population live in poverty. Afghan refugees living in Pakistan and potentially other countries face increasing threats of deportation.\n\nConsidering the prevalence of the Taliban’s stronghold, conflict and humanitarian crisis, improvements towards peace and democracy remain strained. It will be critical to watch prospects of the UN-led processes aimed at building peace within Afghanistan as well as with its neighbors, and ensuring that human rights – most notably women’s rights – are not compromised, in exchange of the political and security agenda."
