        "text": "by Antonio Giustozzi\n\nIt is now two years since the Taliban took Kabul and re-established their Emirate. Despite the scepticism of many observers, the Taliban have managed to cope with the immense challenges they faced and staying power. This does not mean, however, that they have completely exited the danger zone and fully consolidated their polity.\n\nHow the Taliban are governing Afghanistan\n\nThe very fact that the government in Kabul is still defined as an ‘interim’ one is significant. The Taliban have not produced a document, whether a constitution or whatever else, that defines the distribution of power among the institutions of the Emirate. While a 2-year wait is not exceptional (it took over two years to approve the 2004 constitution), there has not even a public debate about it. It is known that the delay in defining the foundations of the new state is due to differences between the Amir, Haibatullah Akhundzada, and the main personalities in the cabinet. Among the latter, the most prominent in openly disagreeing with the Amir have been the minister of defence, Mullah Yaqoob, and the minister of interior, Serajuddin Haqqani. The Haibatullah’s desire is to have a political system somewhat resembling that of Iran, with the Amir in the role of a supreme leader yielding real executive power and direct control over one of the security forces. His opponents within the cabinet, by contrast, would have liked to see him confined to the role of little more than a figurehead, primarily responsible for making sure that Islamic Law was being taken into due consideration by the cabinet.\n\nAuthority and Islamic Law\n\nWhen the cabinet was announced in September 2021, it appeared evident that the Amir had had limited influence in its formation and that it was dominated by his critics. However, one thing that even his opponents within the Taliban could not deny the Amir and the senior clerics gathered around him was authority on matters of Islamic Law. The position of his opponents weakened over late 2021 and early 2022 as their policies of courting the US, delaying the full implementation of Islamic Law and try to limit changes to the status of women in education and in the workplace failed to bring in concrete results and move the Emirate closer to international recognition or at least towards receiving direct financial aid. The Amir’s strategy for undermining the policies of his internal rivals has been to issue bans on women’s education and employment, on the basis of unfulfilled Islamic Law requirements. The Amir’s first such torpedo came in September 2021 already, with the suspension of high school education for girls. After that, the Amir repeatedly used same tool of suspending women access to education or employment, every time that Kabul’s efforts to reach out to the US seemed to be making progress.\n\nThe power struggle in Kabul\n\nIntra-Taliban power struggles peaked in February 2023, as key members of the cabinet were extremely frustrated with the Amir’s ability to block many of their efforts. Several of them, including Yaqoob and Serajuddin, went public with videoed statements, implicitly criticising the Amir, while an attempt to remove Haibatullah from his position was being orchestrated. A vote of the Taliban’s leadership council, meant to vote Haibatullah out of his job, never happened, as he got word of what was coming up and intervened, convening a meeting in Kandahar. During weeks of deliberations in the city that is the Amir’s seat, Haibatullah was able to split the front of his opponents and start co-opting key components of the Taliban to his side, starting from the powerful Helmandi military leaders.\n\nBy the end of the second year in power, the Amir was busy expanding his alliances and trying to sideline the two main protagonists of the efforts to reach out to the Americans, Mullah Yaqoob and the head of intelligence, Wasiq. Although the Amir looked definitely in a stronger position than he had been in September 2021, as of end July 2023 he had not yet been able to implement the cabinet reshuffled he wanted.\n\nDomestic threats and regional context\n\nInternal divisions still affected the external relations of the Emirate, not just with the US, but also with Iran and Pakistan, as the Taliban sought to undermine each other’s relations with patrons. While in principle the Emirate seeks good relations with all the neighbours, some leaders are suspicious of Iran and Pakistan, but also Qatar and UAE, interfering in the on-going power struggles.\n\nDespite these persisting divisions, the Emirate has been doing well in first containing and then marginalising the military threats posed by the armed opposition. The opposition rooted in the previous regime, chiefly represented by the National Resistance Forces (NRF), was on the verge of collapse by the summer of 2023, due to simmering internal divisions, lack of funding and effective Taliban repression. Dealing with the Islamic State in Khorasan (IS-K) represented more of a challenge for the Emirate, but the Taliban reacted quite quickly to the challenge, investing mainly in strengthening their intelligence apparatus and in chocking off IS-K from its sources of funding abroad. The Taliban were helped by the fact that IS in general is in a poor state and has come under heavy pressure in Turkey and Syria, from where its leadership was transferring funding to IS-K. During 2023 IS-K was forced to dramatically curtail its activities and transfer most of its men to Pakistan. While it would be premature to write it off yet, its prospects do not look bright.\n\nAnother area of relative success for the Emirate was the stabilisation of its finances. Its tax and customs collection now yields over $2 billion per year to the ministry of finance, which compares well with the performance of the previous regime, but it is still insufficient for the Emirate to meet all its needs, the more so as it has now decided to build an army of as many as 200,000. The economy has ended its dramatic decline, but without significant investment it will not see much growth. The lack of international recognition and instability on the border, with frequent clashes with Pakistan and Iranian border guards, contribute to making international investment an unlikely proposition.\n\nFight against drug trafficking\n\nThe successful implementation of the ban on the cultivation and trade of drugs was one of the main successes of the Emirate, helping it demonstrate its ability to control territory and implement policies. The future of the ban remains however uncertain, as it might be hard to sustain without external aid flocking to fill the gaps opened in the rural economy. The Taliban seem to offer the ban to the international community as a gesture of good will, expecting some form of support. Should that not come forth over the next 1-2 years, the Taliban would have a justification for reversing the ban."
