        "text": "The Taliban overthrew the elected government in August 2021, after launching a renewed offensive in May. In September, the Taliban declared the formation of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IEA) and installed an unelected cabinet. Mohammad Hasan Akhund, the head of the movement’s Rehbari Shura (Leadership Council), was named prime minister. Haibatullah Akhundzada, the movement’s leader, was named the IEA’s supreme leader.\n\nPrior to the Taliban takeover, the president was directly elected for up to two five-year terms and could appoint ministers with parliamentary approval. The last republican president, Ashraf Ghani, was declared by the Independent Election Commission (IEC) to have won reelection in September 2019 presidential contest with 50.6 percent of the vote.\n\nScore Change: The score declined from 1 to 0 because the elected president was deposed by the Taliban, who appointed an unelected prime minister.\n\nWhile Afghans were previously represented by a parliament, no popularly elected body functions under Taliban rule.\n\nUnder the 2004 constitution, the National Assembly consisted of the directly elected lower house, the 249-seat Wolesi Jirga (House of the People), and the 102-seat Meshrano Jirga (House of Elders), the upper house. Two-thirds of upper-house members were elected by provincial councils, while the president appointed the remaining third. Ten Wolesi Jirga seats were reserved for the nomadic Kuchi, including at least 3 women, and 65 of the chamber’s general seats were reserved for women.\n\nThe parliament that was effectively dissolved in 2021 was elected in 2018. Half of all registered voters participated, though the elections were affected by fears of violence, technical issues, and long lines at polling stations.\n\nScore Change: The score declined from 1 to 0 because the elected legislature ceased functioning after the Taliban deposed the country’s elected government.\n\nWomen are unable to seek political rights or electoral opportunities under the Taliban. The Taliban included no women in its cabinet in September 2021.\n\nMost Taliban members are ethnic Pashtuns, who are believed to represent 42 percent of the Afghan population. However, members of other ethnic groups also support it. Ethnic Pashtuns dominated the government announced in September 2021, though a deputy prime minister, Abdul Salam Hanafi, is an ethnic Uzbek. Some Taliban members who are not part of the Pashtun ethnic group reportedly hold civil and military posts.\n\nLGBT+ interests are not considered by the Taliban, who declared they would not respect LGBT+ rights in an October 2021 statement.\n\nThe republican constitution recognized multiple ethnic and linguistic minorities and provided more guarantees of equal status to minorities than historically available in Afghanistan. Women and traditionally marginalized Shiite Muslims, including most ethnic Hazaras, enjoyed increased levels of political representation and participation. Presidential tickets had included vice-presidential candidates from minority ethnic groups to broaden their appeal. Through this tradition of coalition building, Tajiks, Hazaras, and Uzbeks all had a stake in electoral contests.\n\nScore Change: The score declined from 2 to 0 because political rights for women, ethnic minority groups, and LGBT+ people have been largely suspended under the Taliban.\n\nThe Taliban appointed an unelected government in September 2021. The elected executive and legislative branches of the republic ceased functioning after its August collapse.\n\nThe republic’s president was charged with setting government policy, assisted by a cabinet and subject to parliamentary oversight. However, the republic’s ability to govern was affected by its economic and military reliance on the United States and its allies. During US-Taliban talks, US-led diplomats applied intense pressure on the Ghani administration to accept their favored negotiated compromise. The elected government had no role in those negotiations, which concluded in 2020 with a US commitment to withdraw troops from Afghanistan, despite the agreement’s implications for its future.\n\nScore Change: The score declined from 1 to 0 because the country’s elected national representatives were deposed by the unelected Taliban.\n\nWhile Afghanistan had a vibrant media sector during the republic, media freedoms are severely restricted under the Taliban.\n\nJournalists were subjected to violence while the republic was in power in 2021. In March, three Enikass Radio and TV employees were killed by unidentified gunmen. In June, Ariana News anchor Mina Khairi died in a car bomb explosion along with her mother and two other passengers in Kabul. The Taliban have also used force against journalists since taking control of Afghanistan, with journalists being detained and attacked by Taliban for covering demonstrations. The Taliban detained at least 32 journalists since deposing the elected government.\n\nThe Taliban instituted restrictions on artistic and media activity since taking power. In October 2021, the MVV reportedly banned live music in some public places. In November, it banned broadcasts of programs featuring female actors, while ordering female news presenters to wear “Islamic hijab,” a term they did not specifically define. The MVV also imposed other guidelines, including a ban on broadcasts showing images of the prophet Muhammad.\n\nThe media sector has severely contracted since the collapse of the republic. In late December 2021, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) and the Afghan Independent Journalists Association reported that 231 media outlets closed since the Taliban took power, while 84 percent of female journalists have lost their jobs. Nearly all independent outlets operating outside Kabul have shuttered. Tolo News, an independent outlet, has continued to function and employs female presenters, however.\n\nScore Change: The score declined from 2 to 1 because journalists face reporting restrictions, harassment, and physical violence under the Taliban, and media outlets have closed since the group assumed power.\n\nReligious freedom, which was hampered by violence and discrimination under the republic, has been heavily curtailed by the Taliban. In September 2021, the Taliban reconstituted the MVV, which had previously been used to enforce their interpretation of Sharia. The current ministry is reportedly less strict in its enforcement than under the regime that was deposed in 2001, however.\n\nMembers of religious minority groups have faced restrictions and violence from the Taliban and armed groups. Salafists have accused the Taliban of closing houses of worship and detaining and killing members. Afghan Christians sought to leave the country after the Taliban’s takeover, with Taliban reportedly killing Afghans believed to adhere to Christianity.\n\nHazaras, most of whom practice Shia Islam, have been targeted by the IS-K. The IS-K claimed responsibility for attacking a mosque in Kunduz in October 2021, killing at least 72 people. It also assumed responsibility for an attack on a Kandahar mosque that month, killing at least 63 people. Hazaras have also been targeted by the Taliban; in late August, Taliban fighters reportedly killed 13 Hazaras, many of them former government soldiers, in Daykundi Province. In September, reports surfaced of Taliban forcibly evicting Hazara families from their homes.\n\nThe Afghan population was acutely vulnerable to armed conflict and violence during 2021, before and after the Taliban takeover.\n\nUS forces and the Taliban largely refrained from direct conflict after concluding an agreement in 2020, under which the United States committed to a conditional withdrawal timetable. The Taliban continued to fight the republic’s forces, however. In April 2021, US president Biden announced that US troops would be withdrawn by September 11 (in July, Biden accelerated the timetable, with the US military presence being fully removed by the end of August). The Taliban launched a renewed offensive against the government in May, engaging in fierce fighting for control of some district centers. Provincial capitals fell to the Taliban in rapid succession in August. On August 15, Taliban fighters entered Kabul and took control of the city. The UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) reported 1,659 civilian deaths and 3,524 injuries during the first half of 2021. The Afghan army’s former chief of staff, meanwhile, estimated that 1,000 military personnel were killed and another 1,000 went missing in the final weeks of fighting, with 92,000 service personnel killed throughout the war.\n\nThe Taliban engaged in retaliatory violence after their campaign. Some 47 members of the deposed government’s security forces were either executed or disappeared between the middle of August and the end of October 2021 according to Human Rights Watch (HRW). In December, the United Nations claimed that over 100 people had been extrajudicially killed by the Taliban for their ties to the former government.\n\nAfghans face the death penalty under the Taliban. In September 2021, Nooruddin Turabi, a founding member, said that the Taliban would carry out executions as well as amputations.\n\nOther armed groups were active during the year. The IS-K engaged in violent activity throughout 2021; UNAMA reported that the IS-K claimed responsibility or was believed responsible for 77 attacks in the first four months of the year. The IS-K also claimed responsibility for a bombing near Kabul Airport in August, which killed over 170 civilians and 13 US military personnel. IS-K activities continued after the elected government collapsed; in November, the IS-K attacked a military hospital in Kabul, killing at least 19 people.\n\nIn August 2021, the Taliban fought the NRF in the Panjshir Valley. The Taliban claimed victory in September, though the NRF vowed to continue its operations.\n\nThe Taliban ended the limited formal protections from domestic violence offered by the republic. Shelters for survivors of gender-based violence (GBV) were closed by the Taliban, with some residents reportedly being sent to prisons. Individuals who were convicted of GBV were among those released by the Taliban during their takeover.\n\nThe Taliban have explicitly sought to restrict women’s freedoms, including control over appearance.\n\nUnder the republic, women’s choices regarding marriage and divorce were restricted by custom and discriminatory laws, a situation which has been aggravated by the effective loss of protection mechanisms. The forced marriage of young girls to older men or widows to their husbands’ male relations was a problem, and many girls were married before the legal age of 16. The courts and the detention system were used to enforce social control of women."
