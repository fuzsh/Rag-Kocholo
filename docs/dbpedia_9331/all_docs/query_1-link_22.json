        "text": "The recent history of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo) has been one of civil war and corruption.\n\nIt is rich in natural resources but has suffered from political instability, a lack of infrastructure, centuries of both commercial and colonial exploitation, and little widespread development since independence.\n\nDuring the two Congo wars, from 1996-2003 the country was at the centre of what some observers call \"Africa's world war\", with widespread civilian suffering. The war claimed an up to six million lives, either as a direct result of fighting or because of disease and malnutrition.\n\nSince the late-2000s, there has been continuing fighting in the east where a United Nations force is struggling to keep the peace.\n\nPresident FÃ©lix Tshisekedi won a second term in the December 2023 elections, which we condemned as a \"sham\" by several opposition candidates.\n\nThe president won about 73% of the vote, with his nearest challenger, Moise Katumbi, on 18%, officials said. The election was marred by widespread logistical problems. It had to be extended to a second day in some parts of the country.\n\nAbout two-thirds of polling stations opened late, while 30% of voting machines did not work on the first day of the vote, according to an observer group.\n\nThe opposition said the problems were part of a deliberate plan to allow the results to be rigged in favour of Mr Tshisekedi, 60.\n\nMr Tshisekedi became president in January 2019 after protracted political wrangling in the wake of a controversial election in December 2018. He succeeded Joseph Kabila, who had become president when his own father Laurent was assassinated in 2001.\n\nPresident Tshisekedi also comes from a political dynasty, as his father Ãtienne was opposition leader and later prime minister under the dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nSome key dates in DR Congo's history:\n\n1200s - Rise of Kongo Empire, centred in modern northern Angola and including extreme western Congo and territories round lakes Kisale and Upemba in central Katanga (now Shaba).\n\n16th-17th Centuries - British, Dutch, Portuguese and French merchants engage in slave trade through Kongo intermediaries.\n\n1870s - Belgian King Leopold II sets up a private venture to colonise Kongo.\n\n1884-85 - European powers at the Conference of Berlin recognise Leopold's claim to the Congo basin. Leopold announces the establishment of the Congo Free State, headed by himself.\n\n1908 - Belgian state annexes Congo amid protests over killings and atrocities carried out on a mass scale by Leopold's agents. Millions of Congolese are said to have been killed or worked to death during Leopold's control of the territory.\n\n1959 - Belgium begins to lose control over events in the Congo following serious nationalist riots in Leopoldville (now Kinshasa).\n\n1960 - Congo becomes independent with Patrice Lumumba as prime minister and Joseph Kasavubu as president.\n\n1960 July - Congolese army mutinies; Moise Tshombe declares Katanga independent; Belgian troops sent in ostensibly to protect Belgian citizens and mining interests; UN Security Council votes to send in troops to help establish order, but the troops are not allowed to intervene in internal affairs.\n\n1961 - Patrice Lumumba murdered, reportedly with US and Belgian complicity.\n\n1963 - Moise Tshombe agrees to end Katanga's secession.\n\n1965 - Mobutu Sese Seko seizes power.\n\n1971 - Country is renamed Zaire.\n\n1977 - French and Belgian paratroops, alongside Moroccan forces, help repulse attack on Katanga by Angolan-based rebels.\n\n1996-97 - First Congo War. A civil war and international military conflict, which culminates in a rebel invasion replacing President Mobutu with the rebel leader Laurent Kabila. The country is renamed the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\n1998-2003 - Second Congo War. Kabila's unstable government comes into conflict with his allies, setting the stage for a renewed civil war, drawing in several neighbouring countries. Dozens of armed groups fight on in the east, requiring a large United Nations military force to try to maintain order. An estimated 900,000 to 5,400,000 people are killed or die of disease or famine.\n\n2004 - Kivu conflict breaks out in eastern DRC. The series of protracted armed conflicts in the area involves more than 120 different armed groups.\n\n2006 - First free elections in four decades. Joseph Kabila wins the run-off vote.\n\n2012-13 - M23 rebellion. The rebel March 23 Movement is formed. A UN report finds that Rwanda created and commanded the M23 rebel group.\n\n2013 - 3,000-member UN Intervention Brigade deployed to fight and disarm M23 rebels in the east.\n\n2016 - President Kabila remains in power in violation of the constitution.\n\n2017 - M23 rebels resume their insurgency.\n\n2019 - Officials declare opposition candidate Felix Tshisekedi the winner of December's presidential election.\n\n2022 - DR Congo, UN, US and others accuse Rwanda of sending its soldiers to fight alongside M23 rebels in eastern DRC, who face accusations of carrying out war crimes against civilians. Rwanda denies this.\n\n2023 - President Tshisekedi wins a second term in a disputed election."
