        "text": "KINSANGANI\n\nTracing the Congo River upstream you find the jungle city of Kisangani in the heart of the country. Featured in Conrad’s ‘Heart of Darkness’, the secluded port is filled with crumbling colonial buildings unable to withstand the tropical heat. The waterfront brings life to the city, pumping out African jazz into the humid air. Watch the fisherman trap fish in conical baskets by the waterfalls or travel inland in search of the rarely seen Okapi.\n\nLAKE KIVU\n\nLake Kivu sits on the border between the DRC and Rwanda. The lake is opportune for water activities such as fishing or kayaking or just to sit by and stare at the mountainous landscape. Rising above the lake is the active volcano of Mount Nyiragongo, whilst the bustling hub of activity is found in the lakeside towns of Goma and Bukavu.\n\nVIRUNGA NATIONAL PARK\n\nOf the numerous national parks in DRC, a stand out has to be the Virunga National Park. The oldest national park in Africa is famed for its biological and geographical diversity. Tracking mountain gorillas or climbing to look into the world’s largest active lava lake are unforgetable experiences. It’s even possible to ski in the North of the UNESCO World Heritage site in the Rwenzori Mountain."
