Under the leadership of the Taliban, the government is a theocracy and an emirate with political power concentrated in the hands of a supreme leader and his clerical advisors, collectively referred to as the Leadership. The Leadership makes all major policy decisions behind closed doors, which are then implemented by the country's civil service and judiciary. As Afghanistan is an Islamic state, governance is based on Sharia law and Pashtunwali, which the Taliban enforces strictly through extensive social and cultural policy.\n\nOver its history, Afghanistan has variously been governed as a monarchy, a republic, and a theocracy. The current theocratic government came to power in 2021 with the United States-led coalitions withdrawal after a twenty-year insurgency against the western-backed Islamic Republic, after having itself been ousted in 2001.\n\nThe current government is internationally unrecognized and lacks a clear constitutional basis, though the Taliban announced plans in January 2022 to form a constitutional commission. Instead, the government applies an interpretation of Sharia law. There is no separation of powers, with total authority vested in the Leadership.[1][2] The government is criticized by international observers for totalitarianism,[3] systemic human rights violations, as well as for being unaccountable, opaque, and exclusive of women, religious and ethnic minorities, and those with dissenting views. Since coming to power, it has grappled with an economic crisis, international isolation, terrorism and rebellion, and a string of natural disasters.\n\nLeadership of the Islamic Emirate\n\n[edit]\n\nSupreme Leader\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Supreme Leader of Afghanistan\n\nThe supreme leader of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is the head-of-state, commander-in-chief, and religious leader of Afghanistan.[4] These responsibilities include appointing and dismissing the cabinet, judiciary, armed forces general staff,[5] and provincial and municipal governments, issuing decrees, special instructions, and orders regulating the operations of those mentioned above.[6][7][8][9][10][11] The supreme leader also approves or vetos laws drafted by cabinet ministries, after they are vetted by the Ministry of Justice and a review committee for compliance with Islamic law.[12] Supreme leaders have all served life terms, with their deputies appointed by the Leadership Council to succeed them.\n\nThe supreme leader is advised by an advisory council of four to six individuals on appointments, national security, and domestic and religious policy, which form an advisory committee. These individuals have the final say on all policy decisions.[13]\n\nDeputy Leader(s)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Deputy Leader of Afghanistan\n\nThe deputy leader(s) of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is the deputy head-of-state and is appointed by the supreme leader for an indefinite term. The deputy leader serves as acting top leader when the former is incapacitated or otherwise unavailable to execute their duties.[14] However, there can be more than two deputy leaders,[15][16] as was the case with Akhtar Mansoor promoting Haibatullah Akhundzada and Sirajuddin Haqqani to the positions. By norm, the first deputy leader succeeds the supreme leader upon death.\n\nUlema Council of Kandahar\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Ulema Council of Kandahar, or Kandahar Provincial Council, is the de facto ruling and executive oversight body of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.
