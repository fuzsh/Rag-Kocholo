        "text": "KANDAHAR, Afghanistan (AP) — The Taliban view their rule of Afghanistan as open-ended, drawing legitimacy from Islamic law and facing no significant threat, their chief spokesman said in an interview marking the second anniversary of the Taliban takeover of the country. He also suggested a ban on female education will remain in place.\n\nWATCH: Taliban’s crackdown on women makes delivering aid to Afghanistan even harder\n\nZabihullah Mujahid brushed aside any questions from The Associated Press about restrictions on girls and women, saying he had nothing new to say on the matter while also indicating the status quo will remain. The ban on girls attending school beyond sixth grade was the first of what in the second year of Taliban control became a flurry of restrictions that now keep Afghan girls and women from classrooms, most jobs and much of public life.\n\nThe Taliban seized power on August 15, 2021, as U.S. and NATO forces withdrew from the country after two decades of war.\n\nThey marked their second anniversary as rulers of Afghanistan on Tuesday, which was declared a public holiday. Women, largely barred from public life, didn’t take part in the festivities.\n\nIn the southern city of Kandahar, the spiritual birthplace of the Taliban, military personnel posed with armored vehicles. Young men rode through the city on two wheels or four, waving flags and brandishing weapons. Toddlers clutched smaller white Taliban flags with a photo of the Defense Minister Maulvi Mohammad Yaqoob on the bottom right corner.\n\nIn the capital, Kabul, pick-up trucks crammed with males of various ages wound their way through the city. Men swarmed Martyrs Square, taking selfies and clambering on to a monument. Boys posed with rifles.\n\nWATCH: U.S. report on Afghanistan evacuation blames intelligence failures, Trump administration\n\nOver the past two years, it has become increasingly apparent that the seat of power is in Kandahar, the home of supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada, rather than the Taliban-led government in Kabul.\n\nThe interview with Mujahid took place late Monday in a TV studio on a rundown former military compound in Kandahar. The U.N. Mission in Afghanistan and local government departments are located nearby.\n\nMujahid arrived in a white SUV, accompanied by one guard and a driver. He spoke calmly and politely, falling back on Taliban talking points on issues like women’s rights and international recognition.\n\nHe said Taliban rule is open-ended because it draws its legitimacy from Islamic law, or Sharia. “There is no fixed term for the Islamic government,” he said. “It will serve for as long as it can and as long as the emir (the supreme leader) isn’t removed for doing something that goes against Sharia.”\n\nTaking stock after two years, Mujahid said that there is no threat to Taliban rule from inside or outside the country. He claimed that the current government is acting responsibly, and that Afghans crave consensus and unity. “There is no need for anyone to rebel,” Mujahid said.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, the Taliban government listed what it considered its accomplishments, including restoring a sense of personal safety and national pride.\n\nThe statement makes no mention of the tens of thousands of Afghans who fled in the aftermath of the takeover or the severe economic downturn and deepening poverty as international aid dried up. At the same time, the Taliban appear to have settled in, avoiding internal divisions and even keeping their struggling economy afloat, in part by holding investment talks with capital-rich regional countries.\n\nMujahid was reluctant to discuss the restrictions on girls and women, brushing aside questions about the issue as repetitive and saying there was no point talking about it unless there were updates.\n\nHe did suggest change was unlikely.\n\nIn conversations with foreign diplomats and aid officials, the Taliban typically avoid saying they oppose female education on principle, arguing instead that they need more resources and time to allow for gender segregation in classrooms and campuses, in line with their interpretation of Sharia.\n\nMujahid presented this argument in the interview, noting that “everything will be under the influence of Sharia.”\n\nAsked why the Taliban aren’t enlisting Muslim-majority countries with Sharia-based systems to restart female education, he said the Taliban don’t need the help of others.\n\nAkhundzada, the supreme leader, is seen as the leading force behind the classroom ban which was issued unexpectedly in March 2022, just as Kabul-based government ministers said they were preparing to allow girls from seventh grade and up to return to school.\n\nMujahid said there was disagreement among religious scholars on female education, and suggested that maintaining harmony among them was more important than getting girls and women back into classrooms.\n\nThe prospect of international isolation, and the lack of recognition as Afghanistan’s legitimate government because of restrictions on women and girls, isn’t a pressing concern for the Taliban leadership.\n\n“Our interaction with China, Russia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Iran, Pakistan and other countries in the region is official,” he said. “We have embassies, travel, consulates. We have businesses. Traders come and go and transfer goods. These are all the things that mean the recognition of officialdom.”\n\nAid agencies, rights groups and the U.N. this week issued statements condemning the Taliban’s rule and warning of the humanitarian crisis gripping the Afghan population.\n\nREAD MORE: UN food agency says $800 million urgently needed for Afghanistan\n\nWorld Vision said the number of people in need of assistance has increased by around 5 million. It said 15 million people will face “crisis” levels of food insecurity this year, with 2.8 million in the “emergency” category, the fourth highest in the world.\n\nAn alliance of rights groups, including Amnesty International, said the Taliban should be pressured to end violations and repression and should be investigated for alleged crimes under international law, including gender persecution against women and girls.\n\nIn Geneva, the World Health Organization expressed concern about Afghans’ lack of access to basic health services. Spokeswoman Dr. Margaret Harris said 20% of the population suffer from mental health problems and 4 million from drug addiction and associated disorders.\n\n“Most health facilities have poor infrastructure, and there are fewer qualified health care workers due to immigration, limits on women’s movement and employment, and reduced funds to pay salaries and keep facilities open,” Harris said.\n\nAssociated Press writer Jamey Keaten contributed to this report from Geneva."
