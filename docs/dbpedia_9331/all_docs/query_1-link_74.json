        "meta_description": "In December 2022, the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared a national outbreak of mpox and an incident management system has been in place since February 2023, based on the increasing number of reported cases.   \r\n\r\nSince September 2023, an outbreak of mpox in South Kivu province has continued to spread within the province and recently to neighbouring North Kivu, driven by sexual contact transmission. A new variant of clade I MPXV has been described in South Kivu. It carries predominantly APOBEC3-type mutations, indicating adaptation of the virus due to circulation among humans. It was estimated to have emerged around mid-September 2023, and its human-to-human transmission has been ongoing since then. This is the first documented sustained community transmission of the virus in the country.   \r\n\r\nIt is not known if this variant is more transmissible or leads to more severe disease than other clade I MPXV strains. Additionally, it carries gene deletions that affect diagnostics in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. To date, only clade I MPXV has been detected in the country, which in the WHO African region, reports the highest number of cases. \r\n\r\nIn 2024, as of 26 May, a total of 7 851 mpox cases were reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, including 384 deaths (Case Fatality Rate (CFR) 4.9%). These cases were reported in 177 of the 519 (34%) health zones across 22 out of the 26 provinces (85%).  \r\n\r\nThe continuing development of the mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo remains concerning due to the continuing high incidence of mpox reported in endemic areas of the country in recent years with high case fatality, the geographic expansion to previously unaffected areas, the appearance of a novel strain of clade I MPXV, the observed sustained community transmission driven by sexual transmission and other forms of close physical contact in the eastern part of the country, resource constraints to respond over such a wide geographic area, limited public awareness of mpox, the insufficient availability of treatment kits and lack of vaccines to date, multiple competing public health priorities, and insecurity. Based on the situation, WHO assesses that the risk associated with mpox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo remains high.",

        "text": "Since 2022, an epidemic of mpox caused by monkeypox virus (MPXV) clade IIb has been ongoing globally, affecting many countries outside the African continent that had never reported mpox previously. Its spread has been mainly driven and sustained by transmission via sexual contact among men who have sex with men, who represent the most affected group.\n\nAlthough, MPXV strains circulating in Democratic Republic of the Congo belong to clade I, and no cases of MPXV clade IIb have so far been detected, an increase of reported cases, as well as a geographical expansion of their distribution, has been observed in the country since 2022.\n\nTransmission due to sexual contact of MPXV clade I was first formally documented in April 2023 in a small cluster of cases in Kwango province, as mentioned in the previous Disease Outbreak News report.\n\nThe occurrence of sexual transmission of MPXV clade I was further established by the reporting in September 2023 of several new cases exposed through sexual contact with a known case in Kamituga health zone, in South Kivu province. Since then, the number of cases reported in South Kivu has continued to increase, including among sex workers and their contacts, and from an increasing number of health zones. Case investigations and subsequent outbreak investigations together with virus genetics confirm the sustained human-to-human transmission of MPXV clade I in the area without suspected animal exposure.\n\nOn 1 June 2024, the first case of mpox was confirmed in North Kivu Province, in Karisimbi Health Zone in the city of Goma[1]. A 19-year-old woman presented with a macular skin rash, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), dysuria (pain on urination), headache and genital lesions. PCR of swabs from the skin lesions tested positive for MPXV. A total of 45 contacts are being followed-up. In-depth epidemiological investigation identified a sexual contact with suspected mpox and a travel history to South Kivu Province. The contact reportedly traveled onwards to Masisi Health Zone, North Kivu, where the investigation continues. The case of mpox in Goma, North Kivu, which is characterized by insecurity, is the first ever reported case in that province.\n\nOverall, in 2023, a total of 14 626 mpox cases and 654 deaths (CFR) 4.5%) were reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, representing the highest figures in the recorded in the country and the highest among countries in the WHO African Region. Among these cases, 1 461 (10%) were laboratory-tested, of which 966 were positive (test positivity, 68%).\n\nIn 2024, as of 26 May, a total of 7 851 mpox cases were reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, including 384 deaths (CFR 4.9%). These cases were reported in 177 of the 519 (34%) health zones across 22 out of the 26 provinces (85%). The new case in Goma raises this to 23 of 26 (88%) provinces. The most affected provinces in 2024 are Equateur, Sud Ubangi, Sankuru and South Kivu (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1. Geographic distribution of reported mpox cases, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 1 January to 26 May 2024 (n=7 851).\n\nSource: National mpox integrated disease surveillance data, Democratic Republic of the Congo; North Kivu will be included in the next update to include the new outbreak in Goma.\n\nIn 2024, children continue to represent the most affected age group (Table 1); of the 7 851 reported mpox cases, 39% were reported in children aged under 5 years (n=3 090), including 240 deaths (62% of the total).\n\nTable 1. Age distribution of reported mpox cases and deaths in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 1 January to 26 May 2024 (n=7 851).\n\nSource: National mpox integrated disease surveillance data, Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nScabs, vesicles, and blood samples were taken from 1 415 reported cases. Of these, 994 were laboratory-confirmed as positive for MPXV, representing test positivity of 70%. Among the provinces with reported mpox cases in 2024, 15 out of 22 (68%) have confirmed at least one case this year (Figure 2). Among confirmed cases with the information available, 59% (502 of 852) are male; 50% of confirmed cases are under 15 years of age (Figure 3).\n\nFigure 2. Geographic distribution of confirmed mpox cases, Democratic Republic of the Congo, 1 January to 26 May 2024 (n=994).\n\nFigure 3. Age and sex distribution of confirmed mpox cases, Democratic Republic of the Congo, 1 January to 26 May 2024 (n=852*)\n\n*142 confirmed cases had missing age and sex data\n\nSource: National mpox integrated disease surveillance data and national reference laboratory database (INRB), Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nIn 2024, the proportion of reported mpox cases tested at national level has fluctuated between 8 and 30% (Figure 4). As of 26 May 2024, 18% (1 415 of 7 851) of all reported cases had been tested. Supported by expanded testing capacity, this represents an 80% increase compared to the 10% of reported cases tested in 2023.\n\nFigure 4. Epidemic curve of reported mpox cases and the proportion of reported cases tested in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 1 January to 26 May 2024 (n= 7 851).\n\nSource: National mpox integrated disease surveillance data and national reference laboratory database (INRB), Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nThe introduction of GeneXpert for field-based PCR diagnostics in two key provinces, Equateur and South Kivu, along with ongoing efforts to test for MPXV using GeneXpert in Tshopo and Tshuapa, is significantly improving the capacity for mpox diagnostics and surveillance. However, cases confirmed by GeneXpert in 2024 have not yet been included in the national case count pending completion of GeneXpert test validation exercise.\n\nCurrently, only clade I MPXV has been detected in the country. In late 2023, testing for clade II MPXV was introduced in the national laboratory and is used for new cases/clusters in previously unaffected provinces.\n\nNew variant detected in South Kivu\n\nIn South Kivu, between 1 January and 2 June 2024, 777 cases were reported through the national surveillance system after investigation of alerts. Following laboratory testing of samples from 426 out of 777 cases (55%), 373 cases were confirmed as positive (test positivity of 88%), including seven deaths (CFR 1.8% among confirmed cases).\n\nThe mpox cluster in South Kivu, initially detected in the Kamituga Health Zone and driven by sexual contact transmission, has been expanding geographically and currently 19 of 34 (56%) health zones have reported at least one mpox case.\n\nThe type of contact reported by cases includes sexual contact, non-sexual direct contact, as well as household and healthcare facility contact. No cases with suspected zoonotic transmission have been reported in the province since the start of the outbreak.\n\nThe majority of laboratory confirmed cases in South Kivu are among persons aged more than 15 years, and among those with age and sex data available, the sex distribution is similar, with 51% female and 49% male.\n\nThrough genomic sequencing of MPXV samples collected between October 2023 and January 2024, a novel variant of clade I MPXV was identified in the Kamituga health zone. This variant carries a deletion of a gene that widely serves as a target for clade-specific molecular assays. This deletion was confirmed by the national reference laboratory, the Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB), as well as other academic and public health institutes.\n\nThe new variant was found to have predominantly APOBEC3-type mutations, indicating adaptation of the virus due to circulation among humans. It was estimated to have emerged around mid-September 2023, with sequence data suggesting sustained human-to-human transmission since then. It is not known if this variant is more transmissible or leads to more severe disease than other virus strains circulating in the country.\n\nAll publicly available virus sequences from clinical specimens from South Kivu in 2024 identify the strain to be the novel variant. However, in all other publicly available sequences from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, including recent sequences from Equateur, Kinshasa and Tshopo, there is no evidence of APOBEC-3 type mutations. With the publicly available data, it remains unclear whether this novel variant evolved in South Kivu or in other under-sampled regions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo or the larger Congo Basin area. Additional sequencing data from across the country and the larger Congo Basin area are needed to better understand the origins of this novel variant, and better understand all virus strains circulating in the country.\n\nMpox situation in WHO Africa Region\n\nBurundi\n\nVerbal reports of suspected mpox cases have suggested potential cross-border transmission from South Kivu in the Democratic Republic of Congo. As of 30 May 2024, no suspected mpox case has been officially reported from Burundi. An assessment of the national level of preparedness for mpox has been conducted, procurement of testing kits and inventory of medical stocks are ongoing. Discussions to develop a mpox contingency plan are also ongoing.\n\nCameroon\n\nFrom 1 January to 30 April 2024, there have been 23 suspected cases of mpox, with five confirmed cases (four males and one female) and two deaths (40% CFR). Genomic sequencing of these cases has identified clade II as the responsible variant. Over the years, Cameroon remains to date the only country to have reported both clades I and II MPXV. In 2024 the confirmed cases are distributed across three regions Nord-Ouest (n=2), Sud-Ouest (n=2), and Littoral (n=1) regions, highlighting the potential for regional spread.\n\nRepublic of the Congo (ROC)\n\nOn 23 April 2024, the government declared a national mpox epidemic, activating the Centre d’opérations d’urgence de santé publique (COUSP) and the Incident Management System on 3 May 2024. Genomic sequencing of MPXV samples confirmed clade I, similar to those found in endemic neighbouring areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. From 1 January to 30 May 2024, the Republic of Congo reported 19 confirmed and 10 probable mpox cases across four departments: Cuvette (14 cases), Likouala (two cases), Plateaux (two cases), and Pointe-Noire (one case). The modes of transmission for these cases have not been documented. As a result, there's a high risk of the outbreak spreading. The outbreak peaked during week 4 to 10 (from 21 January to 9 March) 2024, and no cases have been reported in more recent weeks. However, only 9 of the 35 suspected cases recorded in week 21 were tested (all negative), highlighting a low testing rate.\n\nRwanda\n\nGiven the proximity to South Kivu, preparedness activities have been ongoing in the country. Surveillance has been strengthened in districts bordering Bukavu. Between 28 April and 4 May 2024, teams from Rwanda Biomedical Centre, CDC, IOM and University of Rwanda (FETP residents) conducted mpox active case search, assessment of points of entry and health facilities readiness to detect and respond to mpox outbreaks, health worker sensitization and community awareness within Rusizi and Nyamasheke districts. As of 4 May 2024, 16 suspected cases were recorded from Rusizi (15) and Nyamasheke (1) districts. All the cases tested negative for mpox by PCR. The national mpox contingency plan is under finalization.\n\nSouth Africa\n\nFrom 1 January to 6 June 2024, five confirmed mpox cases have been reported, all of whom are men aged between 35 and 39 years old. All five cases have been sequenced as clade IIb MPXV. Two cases were reported in Gauteng province, and a cluster of three cases in KwaZulu-Natal province. The cases in these two clusters did not report any international travel history. Four of the five men initiated treatment with tecovirimat provided by WHO from the limited reserve for compassionate use, upon request of the Government of South Africa. The severity of all the cases identified in persons with immune suppressions suggests less severe cases are not being identified, tested or reported. Outbreak response is underway in collaboration with the HIV/AIDS control programme, including contact-tracing and clinician training. There is extensive travel between South Africa and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, linked to commercial and professional activity between the two countries.\n\nGeneral\n\nHealth authorities and clinicians/health workers of all countries should be aware that the global mpox outbreak linked to clade IIb MPXV is ongoing in all WHO regions, that incidence of mpox continues to be documented in endemic areas and that outbreaks due to sexual transmission of the more virulent clade I MPXV continue in eastern parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The new strain of clade I MPXV linked to human-to-human transmission represents a renewed risk of cross-border and international spread which may potentially lead to an increased risk of severe illness.\n\nWHO strongly advises that countries continue to follow the Standing Recommendations of the Director-General of the WHO issued in August 2023, particularly concerning epidemiological surveillance of mpox and strengthening of laboratory diagnostic capacities in line with updated WHO interim guidance, including genomic sequencing of viruses. The Standing Recommendations advise that all countries should have prevention, preparedness, control and elimination plans for mpox.\n\nThere must be sustained implementation of risk communication and community engagement appropriate to each context, maintenance or initiation of vaccination for persons at risk, optimal case management, adherence to infection control measures, strengthening research to better appreciate modes of transmission and effectiveness of countermeasures in different contexts, and sustained support for the development of rapid diagnostic methods and treatments adapted to the needs of patients.\n\nWhere the number of cases or clusters remains low, health authorities should strive to achieve elimination of human-to-human transmission of mpox and ensure maintenance of capacity for outbreak response. Given the decline in surveillance and silent circulation of the virus, health authorities should assume that mpox can appear at any time and be prepared to respond.\n\nAnyone with a clinical or laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of mpox should follow the instructions of health authorities according to their local context, likely including isolation during the infectious period. Contacts of a confirmed case are asked to limit their movements (and to abstain from sexual relations) for 21 days, the monitoring period for the appearance of symptoms.\n\nSmallpox/mpox vaccines composed of vaccinia virus protect against mpox due to the antigenic similarity of orthopox viruses. For this reason, several smallpox vaccines have been approved for prevention of mpox. Third-generation vaccines causing fewer side effects are available, such as MVA-BN approved in 2019 or the LC16 vaccine approved in 2022 for the prevention of mpox. A few countries maintain stocks of vaccines, especially since the start of the global mpox outbreak in 2022. Vaccination against mpox is recommended for people at risk.\n\nThe WHO SAGE updated its recommendations on the use of vaccines to prevent mpox in outbreak settings and preventive vaccination for high-risk groups in non-outbreak settings:\n\nIn the context of an outbreak, to allow the greatest flexibility for local risk assessment, varied modes of transmission and response options, populations to consider for vaccination may include: (i) adults and children in a geographically defined area or community (e.g., villages) with a documented risk of exposure; (ii) persons with multiple sexual contacts; (iii) health workers at risk of repeated exposure; and (iv) known contacts of persons with mpox.\n\nNoting the endemicity of disease in the African continent, the distinct epidemiology of mpox in this region and the inequitable access to vaccination, SAGE issued a strong call to action to promote epidemiological and vaccine research on mpox in the region and urgent steps to facilitate equitable access to vaccination. Research should also be embedded in the outbreak response.\n\nFor antiviral treatments being assessed for effectiveness against mpox, requesting access through national health authorities is usually necessary.\n\nIt is essential to deepen knowledge of the epidemiological links between mpox and HIV, their respective and common risk factors for infection and progression to severe disease, optimal case management, and the effectiveness of vaccines and therapeutic approaches. It is important to offer relevant and appropriate health services for people at risk, and to integrate case management within a strengthened and agile health service to meet patient needs.\n\nIt is essential to emphasize the importance of case investigation with sensitivity and absence of stigma and in-depth understanding of the human-to-human transmission of mpox in communities while strengthening the One Health approach in areas where the monkeypox virus circulates in possible mammalian hosts or reservoirs.\n\nIn the community\n\nCommunication on the risks of sexual transmission of mpox must be strengthened, especially among the groups of people most at risk and individuals and households affected. Advocacy is needed at all levels to support, inform and engage community leaders in implementing measures to inform and engage their communities about mpox and how to stop its spread.\n\nRisk communication and community engagement activities will be vital in motivating affected communities to become aware of risks and protective behaviours. Socio-behavioural data should be collected, and a situation analysis should be carried out to understand better the transmission factors and those affected. This information can then be used to improve decision-making, to ensure response efforts are aligned with community needs, priorities and capacities, and to inform the development of risk communications plans and evidence-based community engagement.\n\nKey audiences should be identified, including health professionals, key populations including commercial sex workers, men who have sex with men, trans and gender-diverse individuals, people working at or attending venues and events where sexual activity takes place, and people at risk of more serious illness (including persons living with untreated or poorly controlled HIV infection).\n\nPartnerships should be established with trusted networks working with these communities to facilitate community engagement. Two-way feedback systems should be established or activated. Particular attention should be paid to measures to understand, prevent and combat stigma and discrimination – these are never acceptable and can undermine the response to the epidemic and have a serious impact on health outcomes.\n\nIn addition to this, for patients with non-severe mpox for whom care at home is considered, some of the IPC measures that should be implemented include the following: patient should be isolated in an area separate from other household members and away from shared areas of the home (e.g., stay in a dedicated, well-ventilated room separate from others in the household).\n\nPatients should wear a well-fitting medical mask and cover lesions when in close proximity to others, and when moving outside of the designated isolation area (e.g., to use the toilet). Dishes and utensils and household surfaces, such as furniture, beds, toilets or floors, or any location where the patient has had contact should be cleaned with water and soap and disinfected regularly (e.g., common household disinfectant or bleach products). Pay attention to frequently touched surfaces. Please refer to “Clinical management and infection prevention and control for monkeypox: Interim rapid response guidance” for further guidance on IPC measures for patients and health and care workers in community settings.\n\nIn healthcare settings\n\nImplementing infection prevention and control measures in healthcare, congregate or household settings are necessary to prevent and control transmission of mpox. It is important to train staff on control measures, including standard and transmission-based precautions. Staff should also have access to and appropriately wear personal protective equipment, adhere to the WHO advice on 5 Moments for hand hygiene, and ensure frequent cleaning and disinfection of the patient environment, and implement appropriate patient placement and isolation. The transmission-based precautions for mpox are contact and droplet precautions and the recommended PPE for health and care workers are gloves, gown, respirator (e.g. N95, FFP2) and eye protection. In the healthcare setting, in addition to contact and droplet precautions, airborne precautions should be implemented if varicella zoster virus (e.g., chickenpox) is suspected and until it is ruled out. For further guidance on IPC measures that are required when caring for patients with mpox please refer to the “Clinical Management and infection prevention and control for mpox: Interim rapid response guidance”.\n\nWhile protecting themselves with recommended measures, health and care workers should also ensure that stigmatization of patients with mpox is avoided, and that psychological support is provided to patients and their families.\n\nWhen collecting clinical and laboratory specimens: Specimens collected from people and animals suspected of being infected with MPXV should be handled by trained personnel working in equipped laboratories. Confirmation of MPXV depends on the type and quality of the sample, and the type of laboratory test. Thus, specimens must be packaged and shipped in accordance with national and international requirements. RT-PCR is the preferred laboratory test, given its accuracy and sensitivity. For this, diagnostic samples should be taken from skin lesions - fluid from vesicles and pustules, and dry scabs. PCR blood tests are generally inconclusive due to the short duration of viremia compared to the time of sample collection after the onset of symptoms; they should not be systematically collected from patients. As orthopox viruses are serologically reactive, antigen and antibody detection methods are not specific for mpox. It is therefore essential that laboratories support health authorities in providing supplies for specimen collection that are appropriate for swabbing skin lesions.\n\nAt points of entries\n\nAccording to the Director-General of the WHO, and in accordance with the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR), States Parties are recommended to encourage authorities, health and care workers and community groups to provide travelers with relevant information to protect themselves and others before, during and after travel to events or gatherings where mpox may present a risk.\n\nWHO recommends that countries refrain from implementing travel-related health measures specific for mpox, such as entry or exit screening, or requirements for testing or vaccination."
