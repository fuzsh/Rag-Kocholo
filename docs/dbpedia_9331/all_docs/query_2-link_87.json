        "text": "\"I will stand by my students and my girls until the last breath I have,\" Razia Jan said.\n\nHumanitarian Razia Jan has a clear message to girls in the Deh Sabz District, women in Kabul and people watching across the world as Afghanistan finds itself thrust into deepening political turmoil: We aren't going anywhere.\n\nJan, a native of Kabul and a former Marshfield resident, has watched in fear for more than a week as her home country and its capital city is retaken by the Taliban, a militant group that ran the country in the late 1990s. A lifelong advocate for women, Jan is marking 14 years of running a free school for girls on the outskirts of Kabul.\n\nAfghanistan is largely considered one of the worst places in the world to be a woman, and under the Taliban's original control, girls were restricted from getting an education.\n\nJan is the former owner of Razia’s Tailors and Cleaners in Duxbury and a past president of the Duxbury Rotary Club. In 2007, she founded Razia’s Ray of Hope, a nonprofit dedicated to educating Afghan girls. In 2012, she was named a CNN Hero for her efforts.\n\nAfter receiving her education in the United States, it wasn't until the Taliban fell in 2001 that Jan, then in her late 50s, returned to Afghanistan.\n\nMore: Taliban take over Afghanistan\n\nMore: Biden tells Americans 'we will get you home' as evacuation flights resume\n\nNow she is watching the Taliban sweep back into power in a country she has reconnected with in ways she was never sure she would.\n\n\"My heart is broken. I am so sad,\" Jan said while holding back tears during an interview with The Patriot Ledger. \"But I have hope. And I will go back. It is a tragedy that we have to face. After 30 years of hard work, we are back to the point that we started. But right now, we are in a much better position. We have the backing of the community where I have my school and of people all over Afghanistan. We will try to keep the girls in school.\"\n\nThe Taliban and women's rights\n\nLast week, Taliban leaders vowed to respect women’s rights despite its history of oppression. Following a lightning offensive across Afghanistan in which many cities fell to the insurgents without a fight, the Taliban have sought to portray themselves as more moderate than when they imposed a strict form of Islamic rule in the late 1990s.\n\nZabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban’s longtime spokesman, last Tuesday promised his group would honor women’s rights within the norms of Islamic law, without elaborating. The Taliban have encouraged women to return to work and have allowed girls to return to school, handing out Islamic headscarves at the door.\n\n\"I hope they are going to do what they are promising. Right now, we have nothing but to take their word because we have no other choices. We have no other government, we are at the mercy of the Taliban,\" Jan said. \"I think if they are willing to continue to let us continue education, we will try to do that. ... I will stand by my students and my girls until the last breath I have. We are not going to abandon them.\"\n\nThe treatment of women varies widely throughout the Muslim world and sometimes even within the same country, with rural areas tending to be far more conservative. Some Muslim countries, including neighboring Pakistan, have had female prime ministers, while ultraconservative Saudi Arabia only recently allowed women to drive.\n\nThe mission of the Zabuli Education Center\n\nNear Jan's school, the Zabuli Education Center, she said people have become largely supportive of the mission to educate women and girls, but not without decades of hard work.\n\nMore: 'It’s just rubbish': Experts doubt Taliban's promises on women and girls\n\n\"I started at the grassroots and I started working with men in that community and those men are benefiting from the education of their daughters and granddaughters,\" Jan said. \"My girls are teaching at my school and other schools in surrounding villages, they are trained midwives and they are taking care of their communities. In the 14 years of service to their communities, we have never had a problem. Men are standing behind us, and we can't give up.\"\n\nToday, the school educates almost 800 girls ages 4 to 19, and this year will graduate the first class of students who have attended since they were in kindergarten. There are more than 300 girls on waiting lists for kindergarten enrollment through the year 2026. Jan is working on building an extension to the Zabuli Education Center with 28 classrooms, an auditorium, a library and a science lab.\n\n\"It is amazing what everybody wants to do. A lot of people have left (the capital city of) Kabul and come to these villages, but we can't accommodate them because we don't have room,\" Jan said.\n\nThe education of nearly an entire generation of girls in the region has led to a shift in how women are perceived by themselves, their peers and men in their communities, Jan said.\n\n\"I have great hope. I think that the last 20 years have made a great difference in the awareness of self-respect, self-care and being a person of our own for women and girls,\" she said. \"I think it has changed, and men are – in my area – really respecting these girls. They are not selling them, not giving them away or forcing marriage. These are the things that I see every day and I believe in all of these young women.\"\n\nJan said her school was in a planned closure last week for a religious holiday and to allow girls to study for exams. The school has not reopened since the Taliban takeover, but she said her teachers and staff are working to do so as quickly as possible.\n\nMore: How did Afghanistan end this way? The finger-pointing begins.\n\nMore: A timeline of the US withdrawal and Taliban recapture of Afghanistan\n\n\"It's awful and everything came so fast, but people are still in their homes and my girls are safe,\" she said. \"Nobody is stealing them, nobody is taking them away. They are safe and they are with their families.\"\n\nHow you can help\n\nRazia's foundation launched a GoFundMe page late last week with hopes of raising $500,000 for the families and staff of the Zabuli Education Center. Donations are tax deductible and money will be used to pay for operating expenses and expanded enrollment for students whose families have been displaced to the school's region amid the ongoing instability.\n\n\"People are losing their lives right and left,\" Jan said. \"It is a really, really terrible situation but we appreciate the prayers, the well wishes and the help to continue. I'm not giving up and nobody else should.\"\n\nThe foundation also runs a sponsorship program to match donors with students and support student costs, which makes the school free to attend. The Beyond the 11th organization provides monthly financial support to widows in the community so their daughters can continue their education instead of working or marrying.\n\nThanks to our subscribers, who help make this coverage possible.
