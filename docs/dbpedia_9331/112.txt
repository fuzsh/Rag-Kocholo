Located at a crossroads in Asia, roughly halfway between Istanbul, Turkey, in the west and Hanoi, Vietnam, in the eastâ€”it is situated in a strategic location along the trade routes of Central Asia and South Asia, and was a key destination on the ancient Silk Road; it was traditionally seen as the meeting point between Tartary, India, and Persia.

In the 16th century, the Mughal Empire used Kabul as a summer capital, during which time it prospered and increased in significance. It briefly came under the control of the Afsharids following Nader Shah's invasion of India, until finally becoming under local rule by the Afghan Empire in 1747; Kabul became the capital of Afghanistan in 1776, during the reign of Timur Shah Durrani (a son of Ahmad Shah Durrani).
