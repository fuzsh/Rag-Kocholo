The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, also known as the Republic of Afghanistan, the DRA, and just Afghanistan, is a Marxist-Leninist Islamic Republic in Central Asia that is aligned with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. It managed to defeat the Afghan Mujahideen in 1992, securing its existence. The country was founded in 1978 following the Saur Revolution. It is led by the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan. The country, despite being Islamic Socialist, has subscribed to a more 'Progressive Islam', being more inclusive of LGBTQ+, women, non-Muslims, and non-Pashtuns. However, the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan has been controversial since it's inception with the Soviet-Afghan War and the Afghan Civil War, though the government managed to survive and defeat the Afghan Mujahideen, causing it to split into multiple groups, including the Taliban. In more recent years, the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan's factionalism caused several groups to split off, making the government more multi-party. These new parties include the National United Party of Afghanistan, Watan Party of Afghanistan, and the National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan. It was praised by Conservatives in 2001 for attempting to resist the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the starting of the War on Terror, however Conservatives continue to oppose the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and call it Authoritarian.

Saur Revolution and Aftermath (1978-1979)[]

On April 27, 1978, the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan began the Saur Revolution. The Saur Revolution was a Communist coup in the country, led by the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan. The armed Marxist-Leninists marched through Kabul, seizing important key buildings and declaring the Republic of Afghanistan, a Capitalist state that had existed since 1973, to be dissolved. The People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan proclaimed the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. Many Islamists, Capitalists, Anti-Communists, and even some Maoists would protest the new government and form the Afghan Mujahideen, starting an insurgency against the new Democratic Republic of Afghanistan

Soviet-Afghan War (1979-1989)[]

On the night of December 27, 1979, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics sent millions of troops into Afghanistan to aid the Marxist-Leninist government. The Soviets seized the major cities, even clashing with the government they were supporting. Soviet forces quickly seized Kabul and Herat, two of the largest cities in the country. This essentially turned the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan into a Soviet puppet. Soviet and Afghan soldiers then marched to the Afghan city of Islamabad and recaptured it from the Afghan Mujahideen in early 1980. By 1981, the Afghan and Soviet armies began to besiege the Panjshir Valley, which was controlled by various Afghan Mujahideen factions. In 1985, the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan's constitution was written. Panjshir was recaptured by the Afghan and Soviet forces in 1986. However, in 1987, thousands of Afghan Mujahideen forces entered the suburbs of Kabul, beginning the Battle of Kabul. This caused the Soviets to prepare their withdrawal, which they completed in 1989.

Afghan Civil War (1989-1992)[]

Following the Soviet withdrawal, the Afghan Civil War began. Despite the lack of Soviet forces, the Afghan soldiers realized that they needed to rely on themselves and were motivated to fight. The Afghan army charged and pushed, recapturing thousands of miles of territory in 1990. They pushed the Afghan Mujahideen back, 573 miles away from Kabul. By 1991, the Afghan Mujahideen had retreated to the far southern portions of the country and the mountains of northern Afghanistan. On April 26, 1992, Kandahar, the last stronghold of the Afghan Mujahideen was captured by the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. The Afghan Mujahideen surrendered the next day on April 27, 1992.

Aftermath of the Cold War (1992-2001)[]

See also: Collapse of the United States of America, 1994-1995 Afghan Protests

Following the Collapse of the United States of America in 1991, the Cold War was declared a victory for the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. With the end of the Afghan Civil War in 1992, the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan was finally at peace and began major reforms. Homosexuality, bisexuality, and pansexuality were all legalized in 1994. This move sparked the 1994-1995 Afghan Protests by Islamists, but they ended in 1995 after the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan compromised by making it so same-sex unions were legal but marriage was not. Though, same-sex marriage was legalized in 1996. The next year, 1997, non-binary, transgender, and gender fluid were all recognized.

War on Terror (2001-Present)[]

Main article: War on Terror (World of Sovietism)

On September 11, 2001 Al-Qaeda and allegedly the Taliban crashed two planes into the Twin Towers in what is called the September 11 Attacks or "9/11". The Socialist Republic of New York, the government controlling New York City (NYC), the city where the Twin Towers were, declared that they would respond by rebuilding the area but refused to declare war on Al-Qaeda. Osama bin Laden, seeing that he had failed to attract a war against the Afghan government, publicly admitted to the attack to try and gain more attention. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) then responded by declaring war on Al-Qaeda as an organization and ordered the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan to ban the Taliban. The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, wanting to maintain peace and democracy, refused to take actions. The USSR then invaded northern Afghanistan and seized the Badakhshan Province's capital city, Fayzabad. The Afghan National Army then clashed with the Red Army but lost the following Battle of Fayzabad. After this, the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan banned the Taliban and declared the political party illegal, leading to the Red Army withdrawing. Following this, many battles and skirmishes have happened between the Taliban and the Afghan government over the course of this War on Terror.

COVID-19 Pandemic (2019-Present)[]

The first case of COVID-19 in the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan was discpvered on December 27, 2019. This made the Democratic Republic the third country to be hit by COVID-19. Throughout 2020 and 2021, various battles and tons of cases occurred during the pandemic. The first series of controversies during the pandemic came in 2020 from right-wing conservatives that opposed lockdown and vaccine measures imposed by the Afghan government. The second wave occured in 2021, primarily coming from Christians over vaccine controversies.

UOC Sports (2022-Present)[]

Main article: UOC 2

While not directly involved, the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan announced it's support for Zemeorilia in UOC 2, a cross-world international event involving martial arts. The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan also expressed interest in joining UOC 2 directly, but ultimately decided against it.

Politics[]

Government[]

The government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, officially the Soviet of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, is the governing organizations and the political organs of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. The Afghan people directly elect all 352 members of the Soviet of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. The Afghan people then vote for the President of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan based on the 352 members of the Soviet, which is then the head of the Soviet and proposes the new laws and changes for the Soviet to vote on.

Law[]

Drugs[]

In 1992, following the surrender of the Afghan Mujahideen, the President of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan declared that, "It is the position of the Soviet of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan that drugs are a vital part of Afghan society for medical usage and to prevent the spreading of diseases and other pains." Because of this 1992 declaration, the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan recognizes all drugs as legal and does not punish drug addicts. However, drug dealing is illegal if you aren't licensed as a pharmacist. Drug cartel crime is also punishable.

LGBTQ+[]

Homosexuality, bisexuality, and pansexuality were all legalized in 1994. This move sparked the 1994-1995 Afghan Protests by Islamists, but they ended in 1995 after the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan compromised by making it so same-sex unions were legal but marriage was not. Though, same-sex marriage was legalized in 1996. The next year, 1997, non-binary, transgender, and gender fluid were all recognized.

Religion[]

The official state religion of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan is Islam, this is indisputable and has been clarified by the government multiple times, most recently in 2020 during the COVID-19 Pandemic. However, in 1978, the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan declared freedom of religion to be a right of the people of Afghanistan following the Saur Revolution. In 2021, the Christian minority of Afghanistan protested during the COVID-19 Pandemic due to the fact that they were being given less vaccines than Muslims. This caused the government to rework the vaccine programs.

Controversies[]

Authoritarianism[]

The main controversy regarding the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan primarily comes from right-wingers, primarily conservatives, that claim that the Afghan is authoritarian. These claims are mostly misconceptions as the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan calls itself a dictatorship of the proletariat, causing it's opponents to spin as a literal dictatorship. This is false as, in Marxist literature and theory, a dictatorship of the proletariat isn't a literal dictatorship, but a rule of proletarians over the bourgeoisie.

Religion[]

Being an Islamic nation, many Christian conservatives have criticized the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan from an Islamophobic viewpoint. This criticism is often skewed and biased as it comes from those who have a strong anti-Islam stance. However, groups such as the Taliban which also call themselves Islamic have called the Afghan socialist government 'fake Muslim', but this is also a false claim. Islam is a very diverse religion with many sects and variants, some of which the DRA's government do fall under.
