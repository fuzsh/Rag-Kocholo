Her 1922 book “Etiquette: The Blue Book of Social Usage” instantly became the American bible of manners and social behavior and established her as a household name. The book inspired many letters asking her for advice on manners in specific situations. She used these letters as the basis for her radio show and her syndicated newspaper column, which eventually appeared in more than 200 papers. She died in 1960.\n\n***\n\nFRIGHT NIGHT: H.G. Wells’ “The War of the Worlds” was broadcast on this day in 1938. As part of a series of radio dramas based on famous novels, the Orson Welles and Mercury Theater production resulted in mass panic when listeners believed that the simulated news bulletins describing a Martian invasion of New Jersey were real. The following day, the Brooklyn Daily Eagle reported, “The more than 300 calls which cluttered the switchboard at Brooklyn Police Headquarters composed what one patrolman there called the strangest incident in his 25 years of service. Although dozens of unusual messages reach the Telegraph Bureau of the department each week, none were more fantastic than those last night.”\n\n***\n\nSpecial thanks to “Chase’s Calendar of Events” and Brooklyn Public Library.\n\nQuotable:\n\n“I must study politics and war that my sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy”\n\n— U.S. Founding Father John Adams, who was born on this day in 1735"
