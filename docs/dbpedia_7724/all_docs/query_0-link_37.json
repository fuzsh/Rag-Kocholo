        "text": "Nia Long and Ime Udoka's longtime relationship has come to an end.\n\nThe Fatal Affair actress and the former professional basketball player first met in Boston back in 2010, after work brought them both there by chance. They were introduced by a mutual friend, and from that point on, the couple was inseparable — despite Udoka's NBA coaching jobs taking him to cities like San Antonio, Philadelphia and Brooklyn, and Long's acting career having her film all over the country.\n\nAfter welcoming a son together in November 2011, Long and Udoka became engaged in June 2015. The pair later returned to Boston once again in June 2021 — but this time, with Udoka as head coach of the Boston Celtics.\n\n\"We both have beautiful careers,\" Long said after Udoka nabbed the head coaching position. \"The thing that I think makes it work for us is we give each other the space and time to do what we have to do individually, as well as together.\"\n\nIn September 2022, however, Udoka was suspended from his position, with the Celtics issuing a statement that said he had violated \"team policies.\" Shortly after, ESPN reported that Udoka had a \"role in an intimate relationship with a female member of the franchise's staff.\" PEOPLE later confirmed the allegations.\n\nLong issued a statement to PEOPLE soon after the news broke.\n\n\"The outpouring of love and support from family, friends and the community during this difficult time means so much to me,\" she shared. \"I ask that my privacy be respected as I process the recent events. Above all, I am a mother and will continue to focus on my children.\"\n\nOn Dec. 6, 2022, a source exclusively confirmed to PEOPLE that Long and Udoka had broken up. Long's rep also confirmed that the couple are \"no longer together but remain fully committed to co-parenting their son [Kez].\"\n\nEight months later, Long filed for full custody of their son Kez.\n\nHere's everything to know about Nia Long and Ime Udoka's relationship.\n\nFebruary 2010: Ime Udoka and Nia Long begin dating after being set up by a mutual friend\n\nLong and Udoka, then a professional basketball player with the Sacramento Kings, first met in Boston in February 2010, according to the Boston Globe. A mutual friend set them up when they were both in the city; Long was filming a pilot for NBC and Udoka was playing against the Boston Celtics.\n\nThe former Fresh Prince of Bel-Air actress and the NBA player spent their first date talking in the hotel lobby until 1 a.m. The following night, they went to an Italian restaurant in the North End of Boston. The two became a couple soon after.\n\nJune 17, 2011: Nia Long and Ime Udoka announce they're expecting their first child together\n\nLong and Udoka exclusively revealed to PEOPLE that they were expecting their first child together.\n\n\"This is the most exciting time in our lives,\" the couple told PEOPLE in a statement. \"Words can't explain how thrilled we are by the new addition to our family. We feel truly blessed and appreciate all the well wishes and prayers.\"\n\nLong was already mom to son Massai from a previous relationship, while the new addition would be Udoka's first child.\n\nOctober 5, 2011: Nia Long says she \"asked God\" for her pregnancy with Udoka\n\nA doctor's visit originally left Long with little hope of having children with boyfriend Udoka, the actress revealed in the November 2011 issue of EBONY.\n\n\"I honestly asked God for this,\" Long said of her pregnancy. \"I remember I was driving home from the doctor, and I called Ime, and I was like, 'Babe, I'm really kind of sad right now … the doctor actually said if I wanted to have more children, it would be hard.' \"\n\nDespite the doctor's news, the couple remained hopeful they would be able to expand their family.\n\n\"The next time [Ime] came to visit, he said, 'I don't believe that.' I said, 'You don't?'
