        "text": "Hollywood Shuffle is a series that celebrates our cultural icons in film and television whose performances have resonated with generations of viewers. From the pioneering actors and actresses who’ve helped break barriers and pave the way for those to follow, to the most promising and decorated thespians of today, their dedication to their craft is respected and appreciated.\n\nIn a career spanning over three decades, Nia Long has earned a reputation of being one of Hollywood’s most talented and beloved starlets of her time. Born in Brooklyn, N.Y., Long briefly moved to Iowa with her mother before settling in Los Angeles as a child, where she landed her first acting roles with bit parts on TV shows 227 and Disney’s The B.R.A.T. Patrol. Graduating from high school in 1989, Long further established herself in the entertainment industry, landing her first movie role in the 1990 film Buried Alive.\n\nFrom there, Long quickly became a face that fans gravitated towards, with a succession of appearances in films and television shows during the ’90s and ’00s that were later hailed as cultural classics. Several of the projects she’s contributed to over the years have helped push Black thespians and directors to the forefront of the industry, making her an indispensable component in some of the most unforgettable moments captured on film to date.\n\nIn celebration of Nia Long’s 53rd birthday, VIBE‘s Hollywood Shuffle column highlights the 10 iconic movie roles that have defined the legendary actress’ career."
