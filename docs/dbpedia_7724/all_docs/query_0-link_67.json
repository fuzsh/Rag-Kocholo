        "text": "Nicki Minaj is, perhaps, the most world-renowned celebrity hailing from the twin island of Trinidad and Tobago. The rapper often boasts about her Trini roots in her rhymes — even writing a song called \"Trini Dem Girls\" about the women in her home country. She even shot her music video for her single \"Pound the Alarm,\" off of her album \"Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded,\" in her home country alongside the Trini local residents and artists.\n\nAlfonso Ribeiro also keeps it no secret that he is proud of his Trini roots. Though he was born in New York City, both of his parents are of Trinidadian descent and instilled the culture in him from a young age.\n\n\"Best Man\" actress Nia Long comes from a family that boasts a melting pot of Caribbean cultures, including Grenadian and Bajan. However, as her mother is of Trinidadian descent, she has some close roots in the island and is known for visiting quite often.\n\nLorraine Toussaint, who is probably best known for playing villain V on \"Orange Is the New Black,\" was born in Trinidad and Tobago. She spent the beginning of her childhood on the island before moving to Brooklyn to be with her mother, who was a teacher in the New York borough back in the late 1960s.\n\nHeather Headley, known most for her hit song \"In My Mind,\" was born in Barataria, Trinidad, and serves as one of the most successful entertainment figures not only of Caribbean descent, but across country lines. She has won a Tony, a Grammy and a Drama Desk Award and continues to be awarded for her talent to this day.\n\n\"227\" actress Jackée Harry is known as one of the funniest icons on television. However, many don't know that she has Trini blood running through her veins. She was born in North Carolina, but she is the product of a Trinidadian mother and African-American father.\n\nRomany Malco, known for his roles in films like \"Think Like a Man\" and \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin,\" hails from Brooklyn, New York, but is a part of a family that is majority Trinidadian. The actor also vocally represents the country any chance he gets, switching his accent back and forth and even visiting once for the nation's world-renowned Carnival celebration.\n\nThe \"Black Panther\" superstar was born in Tobago. Raised by a single mom, his family moved to Brooklyn when he was nine years old. Back in 2018, he credited the island for his passion for storytelling, \"My love for storytelling started back home in Tobago. I would listen to the older people in my village tell folklore stories about a gold-toothed donkey that they believed was a person who could shape-shift. Or of the douens which were supposedly the souls of children who died before they were christened.\""
