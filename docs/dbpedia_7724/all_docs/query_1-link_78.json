        "text": "The American Black Film Festival (ABFF) recently took Miami Beach by storm with four days of screenings, panels and special events. Now celebrating its 28th year, ABFF is an event that celebrates Black artists and spotlights a diverse range of entertainment content created by and for individuals of African descent.\n\nWith screenings of “Unprisoned Season 2,” followed by a Q&A with Kerry Washington, Nia Long also participated in a conversation titled “Money & Mindfulness.” There was a screening of “Ol’ Dirty Bastard,” a documentary about the founder of Wu Tang Clan, which was executive produced by his son YDB who wore a custom jacket in tribute to his father.\n\nWith interactive panels and conversations on a wide range of topics from representation, content acquisitions, and storytelling through voice acting, ABFF took place June 12 – 16 in Miami Beach.\n\nWinners of the 2024 festival included Peripheral, Vince Washington, Coke Daniels, “Train: The Dick Night Tran Lane Story,” “Unsolicited,” and “Chocolate With Sprinkles.”\n\nAlso in attendance was Denzel Washington who shared an exclusive first look at his upcoming Netflix film, “The Piano Lesson.” Following the clip, he joined Chaz Ebert on stage in a conversation that celebrated his achievements on screen as well as his significant cultural impact off-screen as a director, producer, humanitarian, husband, and father.\n\nSince its inception, ABFF has premiered the work and supported the careers of many of today’s most successful filmmakers, actors, writers, and stand-up comedians and is recognized as a standard-bearer of excellence for Black creativity.\n\nBy Samantha Ofole-Prince / Images Courtesy of the American Black Film Festival"
