        "text": "BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. — \"For us, by us\" is more than a mantra for Black women in entertainment.\n\n\"When I push boundaries to ensure that I am seen and heard, it isn't just for me. It's for us,\" said Nia Long onstage at the 15th annual Essence Black Women in Hollywood luncheon Thursday.\n\nThe sounds of celebration, sisterhood and support rang clearly and emphatically at the affair, which honored \"King Richard\" star and Oscar nominee Aunjanue Ellis, \"Abbott Elementary\" triple-threat Quinta Brunson, \"A Journal for Jordan\" and \"Roxanne Roxanne\" actress Chanté Adams and \"Love Jones\" and \"The Best Man\" star Long.\n\nAs stars mingled in the crowded Beverly Wilshire Hotel ballroom at the hottest ticket in Black Hollywood, there was a noticeable sigh of relief and collective smile shared by guests who were happy to celebrate each other in person after two years of a raging pandemic and a virtual ceremony in 2021.\n\nDuring a break in speeches while lunch was served at the pre-Oscars function, the cast of Amazon Prime Video's \"Harlem\" chatted at their table, \"Euphoria\" actress Storm Reid and Long shared a hug and Lena Waithe greeted Niecy Nash.\n\n\"Snowfall\" star Damson Idris served as emcee (and seemingly as bartender, too, as he poured attendees glasses of rum backstage) for the awards show, set to stream on Essence's website Monday (7 p.m. EDT).\n\nStanding ovations were the norm for each honoree, and we've rounded up the biggest highlights from inside the show:\n\n'She's killing it': Serena Williams, Aunjanue Ellis shine at Essence Black Women in Hollywood luncheon\n\nWill Smith toasts 'King Richard' co-star Aunjanue Ellis\n\nEllis picked up her Essence trophy ahead of Sunday's Academy Awards, where she is up for best supporting actress, her first Oscar nomination.\n\n\"At the core of Aunjanue is a fierce, noble integrity,\" Smith said. \"And what is beautiful about being friends with Aunjanue is she demands it of you in the most loving way.\"\n\nSmith got teary-eyed as he sang Ellis' praises: \"Damn it, I said I wasn't going to be up here crying, too.\"\n\n'King Richard' star Aunjanue Ellis ditched her phone to avoid Oscar news. She got nominated anyway.\n\n\"I did it in the dark,\" Ellis said of her career. \"This moment of shine, of luminosity, y'all, is going to pass. My next job is not going to be with Will Smith, it may not be loved and the next one after that may not be loved, but I will continue to work in the dark anyway. I have to because I have to fight against my certain annihilation, those who would obliterate me as a Black American.\"\n\nSerena Williams cheered on Ellis from the crowd alongside a special date: her 4-year-old daughter Olympia, sitting on her lap. Two of Ellis' best friends beamed in the audience.\n\nOscar predictions: Who will win Sunday's Academy Awards – and who should\n\nMaking history in Essence: Niecy Nash, wife Jessica Betts are 'making herstory' as first queer couple on cover\n\nNia Long, Larenz Tate give fans 'Love Jones' reunion\n\nBefore Long took the stage to accept her award, her \"Love Jones\" co-star introduced her and reminisced about working together – and delivered a few lines from his \"Brother to the Night\" poem from the 1997 classic romantic drama.\n\n\"We had no idea what we were doing – but we knew what we were doing,\" Long said about working with Tate on the film. \"There is no one that I (would) want to make cinematic history with but you. Everybody's still talking about that iconic kiss in the rain.\"\n\nLong said her career, which includes culture-defining roles in \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,\" \"Soul Food\" and \"Boyz n the Hood,\" has been a \"deliberate decision by design.\"\n\n\"I have fought to be heard and respected in an industry that would rather us mute our voices for fame and play small so that they can stand tall,\" Long said.\n\nLong noted that everything she does isn't just for herself: \"It's for us.\"\n\n\"Managing micro and macroagressions without shrinking to the comfort of others isn't just for me. It is for us. When I commit to taking care of myself first, I'm committed to taking care of you and the generation of women who follow us,\" Long said, her voice cracking with emotion.\n\nQuinta Brunson scores laughs with Donald Glover; Chanté Adams celebrates\n\n\"Atlanta\" creator and star Glover, rocking a shaved head, introduced Brunson, the creator, producer and star of ABC's newly-minted hit workplace comedy \"Abbott.\"\n\nGlover remembered his first time meeting Brunson. \"As soon as we met, we immediately locked eyes – and argued,\" Glover said, laughing.\n\nGlover joked that Brunson's Essence honor \"is about something much bigger\" than her current work, and should have been given to her for herviral \"he got money\" meme.\n\nBrunson infused her speech with the comedy and sincerity she's known for.\n\n\"You women are incredible – and taller than I expected. I thought there would be a step stool for me,\" she joked.\n\n\"Black women are such important pillars of my life, from my amazing mother and sisters to my many cousins and aunts to my teachers both in school and in dance, members of congregations growing up, friends, coworkers, sometimes just a girl who told me I looked cute at a party; she's important, too,\" Brunson said. \"I don't know who or where I would be without them.\"\n\nReview: Donald Glover’s ‘Atlanta’ (finally) returns for searing, surreal Season 3\n\nThe youngest honoree of the night was 27-year-old Adams, who starred alongside Michael B. Jordan in \"A Journal for Jordan.\" With an introduction from producer Mimi Valdes, Adams recalled her father's dream for her to be on the cover of Essence magazine.\n\n\"Even when I was in Vanity Fair, he said, 'That's cute, but my dream is for you to be on the cover of Essence.' And with every career move that has been made, I've said a silent prayer that it would put me one step closer to my father's dream, which in turn became my own,\" she said. \"Well daddy, I guess we need a new dream.\"\n\nTank closed the show with a performance\n\nSitting down behind a keyboard, R&B singer Tank concluded the event with a performance of \"I Can't Make You Love Me.\"\n\nHe joked about thinking he would be the only man at the event (\"that's why I didn't wear no shirt\" under his suit jacket, he riffed) before toasting those gathered. \"You are beautiful, you are amazing, and if no one else tells you this tonight, I love you.\"\n\nThe soulful crooner also got sentimental on the red carpet, opening up to USA TODAY about his recent loss of hearing in his right ear.\n\n\"When it first started, it was kind of up in the air in terms of how I would be able to perform and what it would sound like,\" he said, noting his upcoming album and the two No. 1 records he's had since his diagnosis. \"It's not (coping), it's just using the tools I have in my toolbox.\""
