        "text": "Long's acting coach was Betty Bridges, better known as the mother of Diff'rent Strokes star Todd Bridges.[1] Her earliest role was in the Disney television film The B.R.A.T. Patrol alongside Sean Astin, Tim Thomerson and Brian Keith. Her first notable role on television was a three-year contract role as Kathryn \"Kat\" Speakes on the soap opera Guiding Light.[11] Long portrayed Kat from 1991 to 1994. Long also played Brandi in Boyz n the Hood.[11] The film excited Long, who was doing her \"first real movie role\". It also helped Long build her confidence as an actress. \"It introduced me to the world in a way that it was okay for me to be who I am and still find success,\" she added. \"I didn't have to conform to anything.\"[12][13] From 1994 to 1995, she played Will Smith's girlfriend and fiancée Beulah \"Lisa\" Wilkes on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.[11] Jada Pinkett Smith was originally supposed to play Lisa, but was too short for the role (opposite a 6'2\" Will Smith), thus leaving Long to take the part. Also, in the second season of the show (episode 8 - \"She Ain't Heavy\" 1992), Long appeared as Claudia, a love interest of Smith's, alongside Queen Latifah.\n\nIn 2000, Long auditioned for the role of Alex Munday in Charlie's Angels, but did not get the part because she \"looked too sophisticated and too old next to Drew Barrymore.\" The role was eventually given to Lucy Liu.[14] In 2003, Long joined the cast of the drama Third Watch, where she played NYPD officer Sasha Monroe, continuing until the series finale in 2005. In 2005 and 2006, Long appeared on Everwood, and guest-starred on Boston Legal during its 2006–2007 season. She then starred alongside Michael Vartan and Dylan McDermott in Big Shots from 2007 to 2008. In 2016, Long was cast as Giuliana, a Las Vegas club owner, in a recurring role on the TV series Empire.[15]\n\nLong has had supporting roles in a number of films such as Friday and Made in America. She has also played a leading role, or was a member of the primary ensemble, in several films,[11] including Soul Food, Love Jones, Boiler Room, Big Momma's House, Are We There Yet?, and The Best Man. Ice Cube has starred with her in four films, while fellow Westchester High alum Regina King has starred with her in two. Long has also starred alongside Michael Beach in the film Soul Food and on the TV series Third Watch.[citation needed]\n\nLong made a cameo appearance in the video for Kanye West's \"Touch the Sky\". She also directed Yolanda Adams's video for \"This Too Shall Pass\". Long won a NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Drama Series in 2004 for her performance on Third Watch.[11] She co-directed and appeared in Ashanti's music video, \"Baby\", and made a guest appearance on the sitcom Living Single during its first season. She originally voiced Roberta Tubbs on The Cleveland Show[11] before being replaced by Reagan Gomez-Preston.\n\nLong later appeared in the 2013 film The Best Man Holiday, reprising her role from the original 1999 film. Unlike the original film, however, her character is in an interracial relationship with a white man. After Long was revealed to be pursuing an interracial relationship in the film, she explained: \"We're living in a modern world where it happens and it's OK and it's no disrespect to any black man. I love black men, but the reality is the sistahs are marrying white men and the brothas are marrying white women and that's the world that we live in and it's not to be judged, and if it works for you then embrace it\". Director Malcolm D. Lee also supported the interracial relationship being portrayed in the film: \"African-American women who are extremely successful can't always find black male counterparts on that level so it's a little bit of a reflection of reality that black women are starting to date outside their race — and why not?\"[16]"
