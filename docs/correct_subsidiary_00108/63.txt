Terra Lycos has chosen a potential buyer for its U.S. Lycos subsidiary, the Barcelona provider of Internet access, services and content disclosed Wednesday in a filing with Spain’s Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores, the agency in charge of supervising the country’s stock markets and related activities.

The sale price will be in the range of $95 million to $115 million, the filing states. This is a far cry from the $12.5 billion Terra paid for the Waltham, Massachusetts-based Lycos in the heady days of the Internet frenzy in May 2000. Terra Lycos, with its largest base of operations in Madrid, will disclose the potential buyer’s name when the two parties reach a definitive agreement, according to Wednesday’s filing.

Prior to the sale, some Lycos Inc. assets will be transferred over to Terra Lycos, including Lycos Inc.’s stakes in the Terra Networks USA and Lycos Europe units. Terra Networks USA’s most visible activity is the operation of the Terra.com portal for U.S. Hispanics, a Terra Lycos spokeswoman said. Meanwhile, Lycos Europe operates a network of European Web sites in various languages and provides a variety of Internet services and content, according to information found on its Web site (www.lycos-europe.com).
