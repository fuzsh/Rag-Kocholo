        "text": "LONDON (CNN) - Internet portal operator Lycos Europe said it is open to a possible takeover from Spain's Terra Lycos or German media giant Bertelsmann.\n\n\"As long as it is good for the company, I think it would be fine,\" chief executive Christoph Mohn told the Reuters news agency in Barcelona on Tuesday.\n\n\"Realistically I think it's highly unlikely we would be bought out by anybody other than Terra Lycos or Bertelsmann. From a Terra Lycos perspective, this is one of their options,\" he said in an interview.��\n\nLycos Europe, which says it is Europe's largest Internet portal by sales and users, will trim advertising revenues this quarter, Mohn said. He predicted overall revenues would pick up in the fourth quarter of the calendar year.��\n\nMohn said Lycos Europe was considering offering users fee-based online banking, insurance and travel services.\n\nLycos Europe's investor relations manager, Guillaume Jourdan, told CNN there were no takeover discussions, but Lycos Europe was open to \"alliances\" with major shareholders.\n\n\"The main target of Lycos Europe is to drive the company to profit,\" he said.\n\nLycos Europe was founded in 1997 by the U.S.-based portal and Germany's Bertelsmann. The U.S. company was then bought by Spain's Terra Networks.\n\nTerra Lycos and Bertelsmann each own 29.6 percent of Lycos Europe, which floated in March 2000 on the Neuer Markt in Germany and Nouveau Marche in France. It bought the Scandinavian portal Spray Network and the French community site Multimania last year."
