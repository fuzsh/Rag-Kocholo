        "text": "Bob Davis is the Founder and former CEO of Lycos, Inc. In October 2000, he served as the CEO of Terra Lycos (TRLY) with the $5.5 billion acquisition of Lycos by Terra Networks of Spain. Bob is renowned for turning Lycos into the fastest IPO in Nasdaq history after a mere nine months from inception to offering. Bob has served on the boards of several public and private sector companies including John Hancock (JHFS), Ticketmaster (TCMS), Terra Lycos (TRLY), Lycos (LCOS) and Lycos Europe (LCY). He has advised former President Clinton on matters relating to internet commerce and regulation and has addressed Congress, The United Nations, The National Press Corps and the U.S. Council of Foreign Relations. He is currently a General Partner at Highland Capital Partners focusing primarily on digital media and the internet.You can follow him on Twitter at @BobDavisHCP.\n\nIn this interview, Bob talks about how he came up with the idea for Lycos, how he decides which companies to invest in, where he gets his ideas from, how you can become a VC and his best advice to young entrepreneurs.\n\nHow did you come up with the idea for Lycos and what were the challenges of turning the idea into a business?\n\nLycos was my encounter with the old adage that says \"luck is where preparation meets opportunity\". The technology was invented at Carnegie Mellon University and was licensed by friends in venture capital. I was approached to start the company as its first employee and CEO. My job was to develop a business around some exciting technology in an industry - the Internet - that few had known much about.\n\nThe early days of the company were full of challenges as there was little precedent to follow for building an online media destination and fewer still on how to generate revenue. We needed to hire a team, all of whom joined us from traditional companies such as NBC, AT&T, Disney, Valvoline and others, that shared a vision for pioneering a market that didn't exist. We then had the dual effort of building two types of customers, the first being end users of Lycos and the second being paid advertisers, all while competitors tried hard to beat our every move.\n\nWhat is most important to you when you decide which companies to invest in? What's least important?\n\nThe most important criteria for me in making an investment decision is people. It's the strength of the team behind the idea. I learned long ago that a great team can turn a marginal idea into a home run as they pivot and adjust to market challenges and opportunities and then build huge companies of lasting distinction. Steve Jobs' tenure at Apple might be the best example of that ever as a brilliant leader adapted to countless scenarios and re-invented market after market.\n\nSo when a powerful visionary with the ability to execute walks in my door I want to back him all day long. I almost don't care what his or her idea is as I know they will figure that out over time. Surprisingly, the area I care least about when first meeting an entrepreneur is the detail behind the product offering. There will be a time for that but in our early discussions I want to understand the leader and his or her vision.\n\nWhere do you get your ideas from and how do you decide which ones to put your energy into?\n\nThe ideas we get for investments as venture capitalists come from two primary sources. The first is from the entrepreneurs that identify pain points or opportunities in the market. It's these folks that see something and say I can change the world. The second source is from good old fashioned research. We work hard at becoming subject matter experts. We dig into the sub sectors of industries and try to understand what makes them tick. We work hard to understand all of the competitors in a market, the trends going forward and the slivers of light that will allow a young company to exploit the weakness of titans.\n\nHow does someone become a venture capitalist? What are the qualifications?\n\nThere is no formal training program to become a VC. In fact, the backgrounds of those in the business are remarkably diverse. Some have been entrepreneurs, like myself, who have built businesses of their own and experienced the trials and tribulations of starting a company. Others have been classically trained at the best business schools in the country and have developed the skills to succeed through apprenticeships in venture firms. Yet others have strong technical backgrounds across any number of industries. Some are doctors and some are journalists that have taken new career paths. A common thread, however, seems to be a passion for building something and enough curiosity to believe what isn't still might be.\n\nWhat three pieces of advice would you give to a young aspiring entrepreneur right now?\n\nThe advice I would offer to an inspiring entrepreneur today would be:\n\n1) Dare to dream - believe in your vision, don't listen to the naysayers and build something where there was nothing;\n\n2) Do your work - once inspired do your research, be sure you understand the market and the competitors, be sure you understand the capital costs to succeed and be sure you have the team necessary to prevail;\n\n3) If you let up, you lose - the life of an entrepreneur is not for the faint of heart and your perseverance will be tested again and again. The work is long and hard and the sacrifices are significant. In fact, the life of an entrepreneur is one of setbacks, challenges and failures. It's a life of missed anniversaries and birthdays, it's a life of falling down and picking yourself back up but ultimately, for those that have the vision, the hard work and a little bit of luck, it's the ultimate high of looking at a successful company and saying \"I built that\"."
