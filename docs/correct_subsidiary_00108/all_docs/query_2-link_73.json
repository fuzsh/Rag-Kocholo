In the event that TI USA ISP determines that IDT has not established reasonable and adequate procedures for compliance with IDT's obligations hereunder, IDT agrees to take such appropriate corrective action as the Parties may mutually agree. IDT agrees, upon the request of TI USA ISP, to allow representatives of TI USA ISP to meet with IDT's management in order to discuss IDT's general procedures in providing the Services and protecting the security of TI USA ISP Proprietary Information resident on IDT's systems or in the possession of IDT.

Any such audit will be conducted during IDT's normal business hours and at the IDT location where the relevant records are kept in the normal course of business and shall be conducted to minimize any disruption to IDT's business activities. In the event that any such audit reveals that IDT has underpaid any amounts due to TI USA ISP under this Agreement by more than five percent (5%) IDT will immediately pay the difference (required payment minus actual payment) and interest thereon at LIBOR + 2% from the date due until the date paid to TI USA ISP together with the reasonable costs of such audit. If the audit reveals that IDT has overpaid any amounts due to TI USA ISP under this Agreement by more than five percent (5%), then TI USA ISP shall reimburse IDT the difference between the amount due and the amount paid. 10.3 During the Term and for a period of at least three (3) years thereafter, IDT shall retain complete and accurate books, records and supporting -9- <PAGE> 10 documentation sufficient to document the Services provided to and Access Fees paid by End Users and to satisfy its obligations under Sections 10.1 and 10.2 above. 11.

Upon at least thirty (30) days' notice prior to the expiration of the Term TI USA ISP may elect to renew this Agreement for an additional one (1) year term on the same terms and conditions, subject to making mutually agreed upon adjustments to pricing and other terms necessary to reflect changes in market conditions. Thereafter, TI USA ISP may elect to renew this Agreement on terms to be mutually agreed upon by the Parties. Termination of this Agreement at any time shall not affect any rights, obligations or interests arising prior to the effective date of termination and which, to give effect to their meaning, must continue in accordance with their terms. 11.2 If there is any material breach of this Agreement by one Party, the other Party may (reserving cumulatively all other remedies and rights under this Agreement and in law and in equity) terminate this Agreement, in whole or in part, by giving thirty (30) days' written notice; provided, however, that such termination shall not be effective if the breach has been cured prior to the expiration of said thirty (30) days. 11.2.1 Notwithstanding the foregoing, IDT's material or repeated failure to comply with the Service Levels set forth in this Agreement in the manner described in Section 6.4 shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement whereupon TI USA ISP may (reserving cumulatively all other remedies and rights under this Agreement and in law and in equity) terminate this Agreement, in whole or in part, by giving IDT three (3) business days' written notice; provided, however, that such termination shall not be effective if the breach has been cured prior to the expiration of said three (3) business days; provided, further, however, that the failure to comply with a particular Service Level in three (3) consecutive months or in five (5) months in any twelve (12) month period shall entitle TI USA ISP to terminate this Agreement notwithstanding any subsequent cure of such failure to comply. 11.3. TI USA ISP may terminate the Services provided under Sections 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 and 2.6 at any time without cause, in whole or in part, by giving written notice to IDT prior to such termination as specified in the next sentence of this Section 11.3.

TI USA ISP shall have the right upon termination of the Exclusivity Period and/or termination or expiration of this Agreement, to transfer the performance of Internet services to another ISP. IDT shall provide reasonable assistance with any such migration or transfer on a time and materials basis, at a rate not greater than the rate then offered to the IDT's most favored customers, in order to ensure uninterrupted provision of Internet services to the End Users. In the event that termination is due to a material breach by IDT of any of its obligations under this Agreement, then such migration shall be performed by the IDT at no additional cost to TI USA ISP. 12. Proprietary Information. 12.1. During the Term of this Agreement and for a period of two (2) years thereafter, each of the Parties shall hold in confidence, and shall use only for the purposes of this Agreement, any and all Proprietary Information of one party which is disclosed, made available or otherwise obtained by the other.

Each Party's obligation to maintain Proprietary Information in confidence shall be deemed performed if such Party observes, with respect thereto, the same safeguards and precautions which such Party observes with respect to its own confidential, sensitive and proprietary information. It shall not be deemed to be a breach of the obligation to maintain Proprietary Information in confidence if Proprietary Information is disclosed upon the order of a court or other governmental entity provided, however, that the Party served with such order shall notify the other Party so as to enable such other Party to apply to a court of law for a protective order. 12.2. Each Party shall, in advance, by agreement, instruction or otherwise, ensure that each of their respective employees, auditors, regulators, attorneys or financial advisors who may be bound by the non-competition and confidentiality provisions herein, understands and agrees to comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Each Party further agrees to take any other reasonable and adequate steps, by agreement, instruction or otherwise, to ensure compliance with the obligations set forth herein. 12.3. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that in the event of a breach or threatened breach of any of the confidentiality provisions of this Agreement, the non-breaching Party will have no adequate remedy in damages and, accordingly, shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief; provided, however, no specification of a particular legal or equitable remedy shall be construed as a waiver, prohibition or limitation of any legal or equitable remedies in the event of a breach hereof. 13.

General Overview It is IDT Corporation's (\"IDT\") policy to offer unlimited, uncensored access to the Internet. This agreement defines the terms and conditions of Internet service for all types of accounts and services, both personal and business, that are offered by IDT (\"Agreement\"). IDT has specific guidelines and regulations that must be enforced for the benefit of both IDT Accountholders as well as all other users worldwide. Hence, IDT Corp. requires all Accountholders to adhere to the guidelines set forth herein. II. Accountholder Consent To Guidelines Please read the following terms and conditions carefully before opening or continuing an account with IDT. These guidelines, terms and conditions represent the complete agreement and understanding between IDT and you (the \"Accountholder\"), the IDT Dial-Up Accountholder. These terms and conditions also supersede any other written or oral agreement pertaining to your IDT account, with the exception of applicable software license agreements. By using IDT services or IDT software, you agree to comply with these acceptable Usage Guidelines just as if you had signed it. Moreover, you agree that IDT may terminate your account with or without notice if you fail to comply with the following guidelines, terms and conditions. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE GUIDELINES, TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU SHOULD IMMEDIATELY END YOUR USE OF IDT SERVICES AND IDT CORP. SOFTWARE AND NOTIFY THE IDT CUSTOMER SERVICES DEPARTMENT SO THAT IDT CORP. MAY INITIATE A CLOSURE OF YOUR ACCOUNT. Upon notices published on-line via IDT services, IDT may modify the Acceptable Usage Policy as well as change or discontinue the services offered. Your continued use of IDT services following such changes will be deemed acceptance of the modification. A. USE OF SERVICES 1. The Accountholder agrees to use IDT services for lawful purposes, in compliance with all applicable laws. IDT services are defined as the use of computing, telecommunications, software and information services provided by IDT. These services also include the means of access to computing, telecommunications, software and information services provided via the global Internet. The types of accounts available through IDT include but may not be limited to SLIP/PPP accounts, UNIX Shell accounts and ISDN Connection accounts. <PAGE> 37 2. IDT dial-up accounts are provided for use in conformance with these Guidelines, Terms and Conditions. IDT reserves the right to investigate suspected violations of the Guidelines. When IDT becomes aware of possible violations, IDT may initiate investigations that may include gathering information from the Accountholder or Accountholders involved and the complaining party, if any, and examination of material on IDT's servers. 3. During an investigation, IDT may suspend the account or accounts involved and/or remove the material involved from its servers. If IDT believes a violation of these Guidelines has occurred, it may take responsive action at its sole discretion. Such action may include, but is not limited to, temporary or permanent removal of material from DT's servers, the cancellation of news group posts, warnings to the Accountholder or Accountholders responsible, and the suspension or termination of the account or accounts responsible. IDT reserves the right to terminate an Accountholder's account with or without notice. IDT, at its sole discretion, will determine what action will be taken in response to a violation on a case-by-case basis. Violations of these Guidelines could also subject the Accountholder to criminal or civil liability. 4. To comply with applicable statutes and lawful government requests, IDT reserves the right to access and disclose any information. This may include disclosing the usernames of accountholders and other pertinent information. IDT will fully cooperate with law enforcement authorities in investigating suspected lawbreakers and reserves the right to report to law enforcement any suspected illegal activity that it becomes aware of. B. USE OF MATERIALS 1. Materials in the public domain (e.g. images, text and programs) may be downloaded or uploaded using IDT services, Accountholders may also re-distribute materials in the public domain. The Accountholder assumes all risks regarding the determination of whether material is in the public domain. 2. The Accountholder is prohibited from storing, distributing or transmitting any unlawful material through IDT services. Examples of unlawful material include but are not limited to direct threats of physical harm, child pornography, and copyrighted, trademarked and other proprietary material used without proper authorization. The Accountholder is also prohibited from storing, distributing or transmitting any information that may be determined to be of a harassing nature. Further, the Accountholder may not post, upload or otherwise distribute copyrighted material on IDT's servers without the consent of the copy right holder. The storage, distribution, or transmission of unlawful materials could subject the Accountholder to criminal as well as civil liability, in addition to the actions outlined in Section I.IA. above. 3. The Accountholder may not store or distribute certain other types of material on IDT's servers. Examples of prohibited material include, but are not limited to, programs containing viruses or Trojans and tools to compromise the security of other sites. <PAGE> 38 C. PASSWORDS 1. IDT Corp. personal dial-up accounts are for individual use only. Accountholders may not share passwords or accounts with other individuals. Accountholders are also responsible for maintaining the security of their accounts and passwords. 2. IDT shall provide passwords to Accountholders. In the event that the security of an Accountholder is compromised, IDT shall provide the Accountholder with a new password. 3. IDT staff may monitor the security of Accountholders' passwords at any time. An Accountholder with an insecure password may be directed to change the password to one which complies with the above rules. Accountholders who repeatedly choose insecure passwords may be assigned a password by IDT; continued failure to maintain password security shall be immediate grounds for account termination D. System Security 1. The Accountholder is prohibited from utilizing IDT services to compromise the security or tamper with IDT's system of resources or accounts on any of IDT's computers, routers, terminal servers, modems, or any other equipment at IDT or at any other site. Use or distribution of tools designed for compromising security is prohibited. Examples of the tools include but are not limited to password guessing programs, cracking tools or network probing tools. Any attempt to access any of IDT's corporate assets is strictly prohibited. 2. IDT reserves the right to release the user names of Accountholders involved in violation of system security to system administrators at other sites, in order to assist them in resolving security incidents. E. System Resources 1. IDT will allocate system resources to provide all Accountholders with the best service possible. As part of resource allocation, IDT may limit, restrict or prioritize access to system resources, including CPU time, memory, disk space, session length, and the number of sessions. 2. Additionally, IDT may institute services and fees for Accountholders who are interested in accessing system resources above and beyond acceptable usage. 3. IDT may log instances of abuse of system resources, including but not limited to those outlined below, and take action as outlined in Section II.A. above. 4. System abuse is defined as any use of IDT resources which disrupts the normal use <PAGE> 39 of system or Internet services for others. Examples of system abuse include, but are not limited to attempting to disrupt the sessions of other Internet users, consuming excessive amounts of time, memory or disk space bandwidth or otherwise affecting the performance of IDT servers or networks. 5. Accountholders may not run programs which provide network services from their accounts. Example of prohibited programs include, but are not limited to, Mail, HTTP, IRC servers and multi-user interactive forums. 6. Accountholders may only make use of IDT system resources while logged in. Further, Accountholders are not permitted the use of software of any device that would allow the account to stay logged on while the Accountholder is not actively using the system or the account. The sole exception to this policy are e-mail filters that process and sort mail as it arrives. III. ACCEPTABLE USAGE Acceptable usage is hereby defined as the normal activities associated with the usage of the Internet, including but not limited to usage of IDT's systems and network facilities for accessing the WWW, IRC, Usenet News, E-Mail, and other Internet features. Depending on the account type, this may include a moderate amount of file storage on IDT's servers for Accountholders' own personal web page, file access area (FTP), and possibly Unix utilities used in a shell account. Shell users may be permitted to use their own software, subject to IDT's discretion, provided such software does not use excessive system resources or in any way compromise system integrity and does not fall under any of the prohibited activities listed within this document. This policy is subject to any and all laws and regulations set forth by the Federal, State or any other governmental authority. IV. PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES Activities specifically prohibited by IDT administration include but are not limited to the following: 1. Background and/or server-type applications including but limited to IRC Bots, HTTP Servers, and any other process that is initiated by the user that upon execution continues the user's account even after log-out. 2. Long-term storage of data. Long-term storage of data is referred to as the storage of files which are not used regularly in an account for an extended period of time. This specifically includes but is not limited to programs such as shareware programs which the user may download to their account for purposes of transferring to their home computer. Such programs should be removed at such time as they are successfully transferred to the user's personal system. <PAGE> 40 3. Flooding or abuse of other users. Flooding is a fairly common occurrence on the Internet, and one that is strictly prohibited by IDT. Flooding takes place in numerous ways, including but not limited to ICMP flooding, mail bombing (sending large amounts of e-mail repeatedly to a person for purposes of harassment), mass mailings to multiple addressees, msg/CTCP flooding on IRC, as well as other, less common methods. a. 'Mail-bombing' constitutes sending more than ten (10) similar messages to the same e-mail address and 'news-bombing' is defined as sending more than 10MB of data to one particular newsgroup. 4. Attempts to compromise system and/or network security Programs such as 'packet sniffers', password crack programs and similar utilities found to be running from a user s account are prohibited. This forbidden activity also includes any attempts to penetrate either the IDT system or the accounts of others, regardless of whether or not the intrusion results in corruption or loss of data. 5. Sharing of accounts Sharing of a user's account with another party for purposes of avoiding payment for a second account is strictly prohibited. 6. Attempts to bypass resource usage limitations. In order to provide fair service to all IDT users, IDT has implemented certain resource limitations, the two most common being disk quotas on the servers and idle time-outs on dial-ups. Attempts to bypass disk usage quotas by any means may result in immediate loss of system privileges. Attempts to bypass the idle time-outs are also prohibited. The current idle time-out limit is twenty minutes. 7. PPP/SLIP Emulation Software. Since PPP/SLIP is a product offered by IDT, users desiring such access are required to sign up for that service, rather than attempting to emulate it by software. Any such software will be removed from the user's account by IDT immediately when found. All software provided by IDT to Accountholders are copyrighted by IDT and may not be tampered with, decompiled or reverse engineered. 8. Conducting business through a personal account The regular dial-up accounts (Basic and Premium) provided by IDT are designed for the home/casual user and not to provide the level of service required for conducting business. Therefore, conducting business with an individual account is prohibited. If a business account is desired, please contact the IDT Dedicated Sales Department 9. Excessive use of system resources. IDT account descriptions specify limits on bandwidth and disk space utilization. Any use in excess of those stated limits is not permitted, unless IDT has made special arrangements with the user. This segment can be broken down into two parts - system and dial-up. a. System Limits - This can be defined as the continued use of Programs or commands that take a large amount of system resources, be that processor time, network, <PAGE> 41 bandwidth, and/or drive space on the host system. b. Dial-Up - This prohibition focuses on the continued use of a dial-up port to simulate a dedicated connection for the user's home system. Dial-up accounts are designed solely to provide on-demand access for Accountholders, not dedicated connections. If a dedicated connection is desired, the Accountholder needs to speak with IDT's Dedicated Sales Department (800)225-5438 Ext. 4. 10. E-Mail abuse. E-mail abuse is typically manifest in three forms: a. The sending of a message to unsolicited individuals or individuals who have expressed a desire not to receive like messages; b. The sending of harassing and/or threatening messages to other users; c. The forging of e-mail addresses ('spoofing') in which the user manipulates the email address so that the message appears as though it came from another user. Any attempts to forge the headers will result in account termination. Further, this prohibition extends to sending unsolicited mailings from another service, which in any way implicates the use of IDT's service, IDT's equipment or any of IDT's e-mail addresses. 11. Usenet order news abuse. Similar to e-mail abuse, includes forging of addresses, harassment/threats, the posing of the same message to multiple news groups ('spamming'), as well as the posting of information in groups where it is not relevant and unwanted. 12. Pyramid/money-making schemes. Such activities as the transfer of information or solicitation of persons via the Internet in an attempt to extort money or other valuables or the use of pyramid/chain letters, are all prohibited. 13. Pirated software. Pirated software is defined as the illegal exchange of software via the Internet for purposes of avoiding the purchase of said software by the individuals involved. This includes most commercial applications such as Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, etc. Such activities are prohibited by federal law and are thus not allowed in any form on IDT. Such prohibition also includes the unauthorized copying of copyrighted material including, but not limited to, digitization and distribution of photographs from magazines, books, or other copyrighted sources and copyrighted software. The exportation of software or technical information in violation of U.S. Export control laws is strictly prohibited. 14. High-Traffic web sites. Individual accounts on IDT machines are intended to provide access to individuals only. As most individual pages are fairly low-traffic for the most part, the performance for everybody on the systems is optimal. However, some individuals occasionally choose to put content on their pages which draws a large number of hits to their pages and thus degrade performance for other users' page. Due to this, <PAGE> 42 IDT has had to implement certain limitations on the amount of traffic an individual user's home page can receive. Typically a page can safely receive around 4-5,000 hits per day and/or transfer under 20-25 megs per day without causing excessive load on the host system. Sites generating more than this must be moved over to Web Services where they are better able to deal with the extra traffic. 15. In an effort to control multiple logins and offer all of our customers an equal chance to get on-line, users are permitted only one active session running at a given time. If users require multiple sessions simultaneously, IDT requires that the user obtain additional accounts. Violators are subject to immediate termination without warning, as IDT sees fit. 16. If IDT discovers an objectionable 'spam' making reference to either an IDT hosted web site or e-mail address, regardless of where the spain originated from, IDT reserves the right to remove the e-mail address, web site or objectionable material from its servers. V. PENALTIES FOR ABUSE A. All prohibited activities are subject to immediate termination of a user's account and any and all criminal and civil penalties available under the law. The penalties imposed on a user for abuse will vary based on the level of the offense. Typically the user will receive a warning on the first offense. However, if the offense is severe enough, IDT reserves the right to disable the account immediately. Accounts that have been disabled by administration for abuse will not be re-opened for a user. It is vital for IDT to provide a quality service for all users, and IDT will not tolerate users who through their actions hinder us in that endeavor. It is also important for IDT to have a non-intrusive presence to the rest of the net, and thus prohibited activities that adversely affect users on the other service providers and their associated networks. To this end, IDT reserves the right to modify and/or disable user's service at any such time abuse occurs. B. IDT will not reimburse users whose service was suspended or disabled due to any of the reasons listed above. C. All IDT Internet users agree to indemnify, waive and hold IDT, its officers, directors, shareholders, employees, agents, subsidiaries and affiliates harmless from any and all claims and expenses related to the user's violation of this agreement, including any abusive or unlawful behavior on the part of the user or anyone using the user's account, or the infringement of any intellectual property or privacy rights of any person or entity. This means that you cannot sue or recover damages whatsoever from IDT as a result of IDT's decision to remove material from its servers, warn you, suspend or terminate your account or take any other action during the investigation of a suspected violation or as a result of IDT's conclusion that a violation has occurred. D. You agree to defend, indemnify and hold IDT harmless form any claims, losses <PAGE> 43 and damages, including attorney's fees, resulting form your violation of any provisions of this agreement, with or without your knowledge or consent. IN NO EVENT SHALL IDT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR OTHER CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOST PROFITS) ARISING OUT OF VIOLATIONS OF THIS AGREMEENT OR THE ACCOUNTHOLDER'S USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE IDT'S SERVICES. IDT'S ENTIRE LIABILITY AND YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY SHALL BE AT IDT'SELECTION, EITHER RETURN OF SERVICE FEES PAID OR REPLACEMENT OF CONNECTION SERVICE OR PRODUCTS. VI. ADDITIONAL POLICIES A. Due to the explosive growth of the Internet and the constant addition of new services and thus the new possibilities of abuse, IDT reserves the right to add and enforce new policies. B. While IDT strives to provide local access to our Accountholders, IDT cannot guarantee such service. It is the user's responsibility to verify with the telephone carrier whether the calls made via the Accountholder's modem to access the Internet are local or not. IDT makes no warranties as to whether IDT can provide users with local Internet access numbers. Users are responsible for paying their own dial-up telephone charges for accessing the Internet, as well as for contacting IDT's Accountholder and/or Technical Support lines. IDT WILL NOT REIMBURSE USERS FOR ANY LONG DISTANCE CHARGES. VII. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY THE IDT INTERNET SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN AS IS, AS AVAILABLE BASIS. NO WXRRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THOSE OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ARE MADE WITH RESPECT TO IDT INTERNET OR ANY INFORMATION OR SOFTWARE THEREIN. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, SHALL IDT INTERNET SERVICE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSE"
