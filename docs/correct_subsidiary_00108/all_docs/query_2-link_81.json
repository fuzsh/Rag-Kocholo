        "text": "A late comment, but I suspect that you use FileZilla as your FTP client. Did you know that FileZilla stores your FTP site credentials (site/user/pass) in a plain text file in the %APPDATA% folder?\n\nAnd I also suspect there is a hidden malware on your computer. It grabbed your FileZilla credential files, and used them to change your header.php file in your theme folder. In fact, I suspect that you will find changed header.php in all of your themes folders.\n\nAnd if you are technical enough to look at your FTP log files, you will find the access to those files: a download, then an upload of the changed files. You might also find some random file names that were uploaded to your root ('home') folder, although those files were deleted by the hacker.\n\nAnd, you will find that the IP address in the FTP log of the hacker was from China."
