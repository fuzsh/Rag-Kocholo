        "text": "WALTHAM, Mass – Internet group Terra Lycos has entered the consumer health channel market with launch of Lycos Health (http://health.lycos.com) on Oct. 30.\n\nCreated with Healthology Inc., a privately held New York-based online health media company, Lycos Health already includes thousands of physician-authored articles, video Webcasts featuring leading medical authorities, customized newsletters, health polls and quizzes. Lycos Health provides information organized by therapeutic category to help users more efficiently find information about specific diseases and conditions.\n\nHealthology spokesman Rafael Cosentino said that the new site is centered less around late-breaking news on health topics and more on disease management.\n\n“All the articles are designed to help people understand and manage their conditions and diseases,” he said. “We’ve talked about adding tracking applications at some point in the future, but right now, 100 percent of the content is created by doctors and we’re concerned that (automated applications) … could take away from physician-based credibility.”\n\nLycos officials are confident of the site’s immediate utility.\n\n“Health represents an area that is one of the highest priorities in our users’ lives, and health related terms are among the most searched items for the tens of millions who come to Lycos every month,” said Steve Gross, Vice President of Marketing for Lycos. “The new Lycos Health built with Healthology, Inc., is another way for Lycos to aid our users in connecting with the most important issues and people in their lives.”\n\nHealthology distributes its original content through relationships with consumer distribution partners via co-branding, re-branding, and licensing arrangements."
