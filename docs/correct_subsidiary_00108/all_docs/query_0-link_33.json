        "text": "Lycos, Inc., is aweb search engine andweb portal established in 1994, spun out ofCarnegie Mellon University. Lycos also encompasses a network of email, webhosting, social networking, and entertainment websites. The company is based inWaltham, Massachusetts and currently a subsidiary ofKakao.\n\nThe word \"Lycos\" is short for \"Lycosidae\", which isLatin for \"wolf spider\".[5]\n\nLycos is auniversity spin-off that began as a research project byMichael Loren Mauldin ofCarnegie Mellon University's mainPittsburgh campus in May 1994. Lycos Inc. was formed with approximately US$2 million inventure capital funding fromCMGI.Bob Davis became the CEO and first employee of the new company in 1995, and concentrated on building the company into an advertising-supportedweb portal. Lycos enjoyed several years of growth during the 1990s and became the most visited online destination in the world in 1999, with a global presence in more than 40 countries.[6][7]\n\nIn April 1996, the company completed the fastestinitial public offering from inception to offering inNASDAQ (LCOS) history, ending its first day with a market value of $300 million. It also became the first search engine to go public, before its big rivalsYahoo! andExcite.[8] In 1997, it became one of the first profitableInternet businesses in the world. In 1998, Lycos acquiredTripod.com for $58 million in an attempt to \"break into the portal market\".[9]\n\nLycos started offeringe-mail services in October 1997.[10]\n\nLycos Europe was a joint venture between Lycos and theBertelsmann transnational media corporation, but it has always been a distinct corporate entity. Although Lycos Europe remains the largest of Lycos's overseas ventures, several other Lycos subsidiaries also entered into joint venture agreements including Lycos Canada, Lycos Korea and Lycos Asia.[11]\n\nLycos was one of the most popular websites on the internet, ranking 8th in 1997, and peaking at 4th in both 1999 and 2001.[12]\n\nNear the peak of thedot-com bubble on May 16, 2000, Lycos announced its intent to be acquired byTerra Networks, the Internet arm of the Spanish telecommunications giantTelefónica, for $12.5 billion.[13] The acquisition price represented a return of nearly 3,000 times the company's initial venture capital investment and about 20 times its initial public offering valuation.[14] The transaction closed in October 2000 and the merged company was renamed Terra Lycos, although the Lycos brand continued to be used in the United States. Overseas, the company continued to be known as Terra Networks.\n\nSet back by the dot-com bubble burst, in late-2001, Lycos abandoned its own search crawler and started usingFAST.[14]\n\nIn August 2004, Terra announced that it was selling Lycos toSeoul,South Korea-based Daum Communications Corporation, nowKakao, for $95.4 million in cash, less than 2% of Terra's initial multibillion-dollar investment.[14] In October 2004, the transaction closed and the company name was changed back to Lycos.[14] The remaining Terra half was reacquired by Telefónica.\n\nUnder new ownership, Lycos began to refocus its strategy. The company moved away from being a search-centric portal and toward a community destination for broadband entertainment content.[14] With a new management team in place, Lycos also began divesting properties that were not core to its new strategy. In July 2006,Wired News, which had been part of Lycos since the purchase of Wired Digital in 1998, was sold[14] toCondé Nast Publications and re-merged withWired Magazine. The Lycos Finance division, best known forQuote.com andRagingBull.com, was sold[14] to FT Interactive Data Corporation in February 2006, while its online dating site,Matchmaker.com, was sold[14] to Date.com. In 2006, Lycos regained ownership of the Lycos trademark from Carnegie Mellon University, allowing the company to rename to Lycos, Inc.[14]\n\nDuring 2006, Lycos introduced several media services, including Lycos Phone which combined video chat, real-time video on demand, and an MP3 player.[15] In November 2006, Lycos began to roll out applications centered on social media, including its video application, Lycos Cinema, that featured simultaneous watch and chat functionality.[16] In February 2007, Lycos MIX was launched, allowing users to pull video clips fromYouTube,Google Video,Yahoo! Video andMySpace Video. Lycos MIX also allowed users to create playlists where other users could add video comments and chat in real-time.[17]\n\nAs part of a corporate restructuring to focus on mobile, social networks andlocation-based services, Daum sold Lycos for $36 million in August 2010 toYbrant Digital, an Internet marketing company based inHyderabad, India.[18][19][20] Ybrant Digital paid $20 million at signing and there has been a legal dispute over magnitude of the second installment between Ybrant and Daum. In 2018, a New York court ruled in favor of Daum and appointed Daum (by then merged withKakao) as receiver of Ybrant's 56% ownership interest in Lycos.[21]\n\nIn May 2012, Lycos announced the appointment of former employee Rob Balazy as CEO of Media division of Lycos.[22]\n\nIn September 2014, Ed Noel was appointed in place of Rob and manages the operations under the title of General Manager of Lycos Media.[23]\n\nIn June 2015, Lycos announced a pair of wearable devices, called Band and Ring.[24]\n\nLycos Network sites\n\nAngelfire, a Lycos property providing free web hosting, blogging and web publishing tools\n\nGamesville, Lycos's massive multi-player gaming site\n\nTripod.com, a Lycos property providing free web hosting, blogging and web publishing tools\n\nWhoWhere.com, a people search engine\n\nInsiderInfo\n\nWeather Zombie, a Lycos property providing weather forecasts, with a zombie theme, viaAccuWeather.\n\nLycos-branded sites\n\nLycos Domains, Internetdomain name purchasing\n\nLycos Mail, an e-mail provider formerly known as Mailcity.com.
