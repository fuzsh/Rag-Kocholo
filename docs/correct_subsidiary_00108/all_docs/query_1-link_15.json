        "text": "Spanish Internet company Terra Networks approved an all-share acquisition of search engine Lycos Inc. The deal involves issuing 340.9 million shares of Terra stock and using those shares ($15.4 billion worth) to buy Lycos. Lycos' management has already okayed the takeover, though stockholders have yet to vote on it. That makes the combined Terra-Lycos the third largest Internet company in the world and first in terms of geographic spread.\n\nClose to two-thirds of Terra stock is owned by Telefonica, which recently was the target of a new virus that attacked Web-accessible cell phones. The text message virus specifically railed against Telefonica's business practices and the planned purchase of Lycos.\n\nThe merged companies would create the third largest Internet company, according to Terra/Telefonica Chairman Juan Villalonga.\n\n\"We are already an industry leader in a sector which is the epicenter of the U.S. revolution,\" he said. \"Hey, can I borrow a buck for a cup of coffee?\""
