The conditions established in that Agreement were on preferential terms.\n\nII.Whereas, a change has taken place in the business models created at the end of the 90s and beginning of 2000 to capture the growth value of the Internet, mainly based (although not exclusively) on income obtained by monetisation of the audience through access and advertising, , and one must also point out the worldwide crisis on the advertising market. On the other hand, the wave of offers in narrow band as well as broad band through the media provided by the telephone access or cable television operators has led to such operators developing their own business lines on the Internet, or having sought alliances with specific Internet access suppliers and/or Internet portals, in which sense one must point out the clearly complementary nature of TELEFÓNICA and TERRA due to their coinciding presence in Spain and Latin America. There is also a clear difference between the catalogue of services and products demanded by BERTELSMANN AG. and TELEFÓNICA, and BERTELSMANN AG. also focuses on the United States market which is more linked to LYCOS, Inc. These circumstances that have arisen have a great effect on articulation of the new phase of the relation, just as has been publicised on the markets since the last month of October. In this new context, the Parties, along with LYCOS, Inc. and BERTELSMANN AG., have considered it more convenient to continue their relations, leaving said Agreement without effect, it being fully replaced by this Strategic Alliance Framework Agreement and a new Memorandum of Understanding entered into with this same date (hereinafter Agreement II), which regulate the general terms of the new framework of relations between BERTELSMANN AG., TERRA and TELEFÓNICA, considering as the essential aspect for the purposes of its development the execution of this strategic alliance between TELEFÓNICA and TERRA.\n\nIII.Whereas, indeed, the trend shown by telephone access operators to seek alliances with specific Internet access providers has shown the convenience of taking advantage of the complementary factors there are between TELEFÓNICA and TERRA on all the markets in which both are present. In this sense, while TELEFÓNICA, as a telecommunications operator, has a clearly competitive position in matters of connectivity and provision of access to the international Internet nodes promoted by the development of broad band, TERRA is now the leader on the Spanish and Portuguese speaking market as a specific supplier of Internet access, being the reference portal in Latin America and Spain (as a leading aggregator and contents manager and provider of value added products and services related to the Internet), having developed a brand image which is unquestionably recognised in the New Technologies and Internet sector that contributes the experience and knowledge required for sustained joint construction of a sophisticated offer of narrow and broad band contents and services.\n\nIV.Whereas, by virtue of this complementary nature in its objectives, needs and business plans and identification of an improvement in the opportunities of growth, the Parties intend to establish a long term strategic alliance whose main objective will be to improve the joint development of both companies on the narrow and broad band Internet markets in all the countries in which both Groups are present, preferably in the residential segment, SOHO and, if appropriate, SMEs.\n\nV.[***]\n\nFREE TRANSLATION FROM SPANISH ORIGINAL\n\n3\n\nAny text removed pursuant to Terra Networks confidential treatment request has been separately filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and is marked [***] herein.\n\nVI.Whereas, due to all the foregoing, the Parties hereby enter into this Framework Agreement, according to the following:\n\nCLAUSES\n\nONE.
