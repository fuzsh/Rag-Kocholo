Wright previously held those same positions at Terra Lycos, a global Internet content provider headquartered in Barcelona with operating centres in Madrid and Boston.\n\nMr. Wright will work with Markham, Ont.-based Geac's senior management team to orchestrate product development, strategic partnerships and acquisitions, Geac said in a release Monday.\n\nAt Terra Lycos, Mr. Wright was responsible for managing a technology organization of over 700 developers across all its international business lines.\n\nHe also recently served as an adviser to the White House's Office of Homeland Security and was a member of the U.S. Secret Service Task Force on Electronic Crimes.\n\n\"Tim's technology leadership experience, coupled with an extensive knowledge of enterprise-level engineering and operations, make him an outstanding executive to lead and further focus Geac's product development efforts,\" said Paul Birch, Geac's president and chief executive officer.\n\nGeac supplies software which is used by corporations for core administrative functions such as accounting and human resources.\n\nThe Toronto-area company, which markets its products around the world, also develops more specialized software for several industries including systems for real estate, construction and libraries."
