        "text": "U.S.-Spanish Internet media company Terra Lycos faces an uphill struggle to turn the company around, a campaign it may be forced to undertake without help from its biggest ally, Bertelsmann.\n\nThe loss-making company, 37 per cent-owned by Spanish telecoms group Telefonica, has been hit by a brutal on-line advertising slump, while its broadband business is in the doldrums.\n\nTo make matters worse, it is likely to lose all or part of a $675-million (U.S.) advertising contract with Bertelsmann.\n\nThe German media giant accounts for 40 per cent of Terra's advertising revenue, the legacy of a $1-billion ad pact struck between the two companies at the height of the dot-com boom in May, 2000. The deal stipulates that Bertelsmann pay up to $675-million over a three-year period beginning in October.\n\nIn other words, Bertelsmann could pay one dollar or the whole tranche.\n\nAnalysts say that unless Terra is able to jumpstart its moribund access business, any loss of Bertelsmann's advertising business could force management to consider selling off properties.\n\n\"If they lose Bertelsmann it could be the end for Lycos,\" one Internet analyst speculated.\n\nOn Wednesday, Terra Lycos reported second-quarter revenues of $162.2-million, which is 5 per cent below the analysts' consensus forecast.\n\nIn April, Bertelsmann said it would like to renegotiate the deal, seeking to pay an amount that more reflects today's depressed on-line advertising prices.\n\nA Bertelsmann spokesman said on Thursday that no decision has been reached on the contract. Stephen Killeen, Terra Lycos's U.S. head, told Reuters on Wednesday, \"there hasn't been any material change in the relationship.\" Telefonica is contractually obliged to stump up the difference should Bertelsmann pull out, but analysts are growing exceedingly pessimistic that the indebted telecoms firm will honor the deal. As part of a turn-around plan, Terra has begun charging consumers for such features as extra e-mail storage and music downloads. Analysts though are not convinced it will improve revenues, which have remained static for the past five quarters."
