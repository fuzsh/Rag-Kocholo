        "text": "First: Itâd be useful to start with a word that has a lot of vowels and donât have any repeated letters. We have filtered the best 30 starting words for you:\n\nABOUT\n\nADIEU\n\nAISLE\n\nAROSE\n\nAUDIO\n\nCLINT\n\nCONES\n\nCRANE\n\nCRONY\n\nCRONY\n\nHATES\n\nJUICY\n\nOCEAN\n\nOUIJA\n\nPIOUS\n\nPOUTY\n\nROATE\n\nROUND\n\nSABER\n\nSALET\n\nSERAI\n\nSNORT\n\nSOARE\n\nSTARE\n\nSTERN\n\nSTORE\n\nSULLY\n\nTALES\n\nTRACE\n\nTRAIL\n\nThe above words are not just for the first try. You may pick one of them on your second try. However, try your best not to repeat the letters. For instance, SABER and CLINT - These two words are also my starting guesses for almost every single wordle game."
