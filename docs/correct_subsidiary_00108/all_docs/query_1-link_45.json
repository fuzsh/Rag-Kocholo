        "text": "South Korea's top website operator, Daum Communications, is to buy the U.S. portal business of Spain's Terra for $95 million, less than 1 percent of the $12.5 billion Terra paid near the height of the Internet boom.\n\nIn a move that emphasizes the growing global ambitions of South Korean technology companies, Daum said on Monday it will pay 111.2 billion won for 100 percent of Lycos, which Terra bought in an all-stock deal in May 2000. (Wired News is owned by Lycos.)\n\nDaum shares fell 5.6 percent to 31,100 won, underperforming a slight fall in the wider market, amid doubts over synergy prospects from the Lycos buy and increasing pessimism about the Internet sector's earnings outlook.\n\nTerra said it would keep Lycos' European portal business and its Spanish-language portal in the United States, Terra Networks USA.\n\nThese assets, which Terra valued at $435 million, tally with its parent company Telefonica's strategy of focusing on the Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking world, abandoning more ambitious expansion plans it launched during the telecom boom.\n\nTerra, meanwhile, said the price for the Lycos deal was $105 million, including $10 million in guarantees for real estate leased for Lycos' U.S. operations.\n\nLoss-making Terra, 72 percent controlled by Telefonica, said it should book a pre-tax capital gain from the sale of around 20 million euros.\n\nWhile the sale will lower Terra's 2004 revenues, the company said it would not derail its target of turning an EBITDA profit this year. Terra posted a first-half core profit of 2.4 million euros.\n\nTerra's volatile shares had slipped 1.7 percent to 2.98 euros at 10:28 a.m. GMT, but analysts said the price of the long-expected deal was within the $95 million to $115 million price range set by Terra in late July.\n\n\"Obviously, the value of Lycos is nothing like it was in the days of the Internet boom, but the sale price is within the range that Telefonica set,\" said Glen Chapman, analyst with Ibersecurities brokerage in Madrid.\n\nLycos remains a force on the Internet with Tripod, which allows people to build their own Web pages, and the Wired News site.\n\nDaum, the fifth-biggest stock on the junior Kosdaq exchange, said it would finance the deal with 70 billion won of its cash reserves and a bond issue.\n\nThe Korean firm derives half its revenues from advertising fees, a quarter from online shopping and the rest from video games, lottery, Web-based education, job hunting and other services. South Korea has more broadband connections per head than any other country.\n\n\"The buyout will provide a springboard for our company to venture into the U.S. Internet market and become a global player,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nAnalysts were less effusive.\n\n\"The buyout price looks reasonable for now, but whether Daum will benefit from the buyout depends on whether synergies could be found,\" said S.T. Hwang, analyst at Hyundai Securities.\n\n\"Daum appears to be trying to enhance its brand and long-term profitability by the acquisition.\"\n\nAbout 70 percent of South Korea's 48 million people have access to the Internet, with about 11.8 million having high-speed connections, giving the country the highest broadband penetration in the world.\n\nLycos is ranked seventh in the United States in terms of site visits and has about 170,000 paid users, according to data provided by Daum.\n\nLycos was put up for sale in April at an asking price of $170 million with investment bank Lehman Brothers acting as advisers.\n\nThe Korean firm has a joint venture with a Japanese company that is due to launch Web services in September."
