        "text": "LONDON (Reuters) -- U.S.-Spanish Internet media company Terra Lycos faces an uphill struggle to turn the company around, a campaign it may be forced to undertake without help from its biggest ally, Bertelsmann.\n\nThe loss-making company, 37 percent-owned by Spanish telecoms group Telefonica, has been hit by a brutal online advertising slump, while its broadband business is in the doldrums.\n\nTo make matters worse, it is likely to lose all or part of a $675 million advertising contract with Bertelsmann.\n\nThe German media giant accounts for 40 percent of Terra's advertising revenue, the legacy of a $1 billion ad pact struck between the two companies at the height of the dot-com boom in May, 2000. The deal stipulates that Bertelsmann pay up to $675 million over a three-year period beginning in October.\n\nIn other words, Bertelsmann could pay $1 or the whole tranche.\n\nAnalysts say that unless Terra is able to jumpstart its moribund access business, any loss of Bertelsmann's advertising business could force management to consider selling off properties.\n\n\"If they lose Bertelsmann it could be the end for Lycos,\" one Internet analyst speculated.\n\nOn Wednesday, Terra Lycos reported second-quarter revenues of $162.2 million, 5 percent below the analysts' consensus forecast, and a loss before interest, tax, amortization and depreciation of $31.8 million.\n\nIt also trimmed $108.5 million from the top end of its full-year revenue guidance, now saying the business will bring in $661 million to $720 million in 2002.\n\nAnd that's with Bertelsmann still on board.\n\nIn April, Bertelsmann said it would like to renegotiate the deal, seeking to pay an amount that more reflects today's depressed online advertising prices.\n\nA Bertelsmann spokesman said on Thursday that no decision has been reached on the contract. Stephen Killeen, Terra Lycos's U.S. head, told Reuters on Wednesday, \"there hasn't been any material change in the relationship.\" Telefonica is contractually obliged to stump up the difference should Bertelsmann pull out, but analysts are growing exceedingly pessimistic that the indebted telecoms firm will honor the deal. As part of a turn-around plan, Terra has begun charging consumers for such features as extra e-mail storage and music downloads. Analysts though are not convinced it will improve revenues, which have remained static for the past five quarters.\n\nTerra shares closed down 0.7 percent at $5.63, outperforming the Dow Jones technology stock index, which dropped 2.2 percent.\n\nBroadband, dollar concerns\n\nOn Thursday, analysts weighed in with pessimistic notes about Terra's future. Goldman Sachs cut Terra to \"underperform\" from \"market perform,\" citing a failure to attract new customers and disappointing revenue outlook.\n\nIn a research note, JP Morgan said the company \"now has a valuation floor of 2.80 euros per share.\" Plus, Terra's inability to build up its Spanish broadband business has confounded analysts.\n\n\"In our opinion, the Spanish access market has high growth potential, yet Terra added 1,000 new ADSL (broadband) subscribers in the last quarter,\" BNP Paribas Internet analyst Alexandra Lord said in a research note on Thursday.\n\nBy comparison, Terra's rivals, including France's Wanadoo and Germany's T-Online, are experiencing double-digit quarterly growth levels for higher-margin broadband services in their home markets."
