        "text": "This article proposes a quantitative and empirical methodology for calculating the present and future value of Web sites, specifically of a hypothetical company called abc.com. As more and more Internet properties are \"on-sold\" from one owner to another, it becomes important to be able to affix a monetary value to them. This new methodology has been tried out successfully on three sites as diverse as Internet gambling, a cuisine site, and an Internet portal. It falls squarely under a new category of methodology called Web site valuation. What my article aims to do is to establish the future value of Web sites. This involves making assumptions on much of the above, plus the added complication of affixing future growth multiples on various variables based upon assumptions of a predicted growth.\n\nDiscounted cash flow (DCF) is the most accepted approach for company valuation. However, the DCF approach presents a number of serious weaknesses within the internet companies' context. One of these weaknesses is tackling the uncertainty that characterise future cash flows of these companies. This paper looks at the way in which uncertainty can be incorporated into the DCF approach so that the latter, which is otherwise conceptually sound, becomes relevant.\n\nAcademics and practitioners are in relative agreement on what drives a company’s fundamental value, primarily it’s current assets and future cash flows. The practice of paying a premium may thus be due to the non-tangible factors associated with perceived value that currently are not incorporated into the assets of the company and the expected growth of the cash flows. This paper looks at the most common theoretical models used in the calculation of the value of a firm. It then explains how human factors can cause divergence in the original price set. Empirical evidence proves that the price paid for a company can easily reach 40-50 per cent above this calculation of the current value. Until valuation models can account for the factors that drive premium pricing, it is necessary to recognize that intangible and, in some cases, emotional aspects will have a great influence on the final price.\n\nWe suggest a methodology for valuing corporate securities that allows the straightforward derivation of closed form solutions for complex scenarios. The tractability of the framework stems from its modularity-we provide a number of intuitive building blocks that are sufficient for valuation in typical situations. A further advantage of our approach is that it makes economic interpretation far easier than what is typically possible with other approaches, such as solving systems of partial differential equations."
