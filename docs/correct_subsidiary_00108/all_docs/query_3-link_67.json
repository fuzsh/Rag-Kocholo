        "text": "Anna Kournikova has signed a multi-year endorsement deal with Terra Lycos, according to USA TODAY's Michael McCarthy, who reports that Kournikova will appear in TV, print, outdoor and online ads promoting the search engine and portal. McCarthy reports the deal is for an undisclosed amount of cash, as Kournikova did not take stock options. The first TV spot of a $10M campaign by Hill Holliday, Boston, kicks off a promotion called \"Win Anna's stuff.\" The grand prize is Kournikova's BMW Z3 Roadster, autographed by Anna, who will take the winner for a drive. The spot will \"air heavily\" on CBS's NCAA men's basketball telecasts. Additional ad buys have been made on ESPN, MTV and VH1. Kournikova has ranked number one on the Lycos Sports 50, the company's survey of the most searched for athletes online. Octagon VP/Athlete Marketing Patrick McGee, Kournikova's agent, said the deal shows his client can \"compete with the likes of Britney Spears for endorsement contracts.\" McGee: \"She's a model and an athlete. You can't find that anywhere else in the sports world\" (USA TODAY, 3/16)."
