        "text": "NEW YORK: IBM Corp. and Spain's Terra Lycos said on Thursday they struck a\n\ntwo-year agreement that makes the world's largest computer maker the main\n\nprovider of servers, enterprise software and services for the Internet media\n\ncompany.\n\nIn a separate deal, the companies said in a statement that IBM will advertise\n\non Terra Lycos' network of sites. Terra Lycos was created by the merger of\n\nSpanish telecom giant Telefonica SA's Internet arm and US-based Internet company\n\nLycos last year.\n\nThe deal comes at a time when Internet media companies are aggressively\n\ntrying to sign-up blue-chip clients in the wake of a sharp decline in\n\nadvertising spending. Financial terms of both deals were not disclosed but the\n\ncompany said the hardware and services component of the deal will amount to\n\n\"tens of millions of dollars\" over the term of the pact.\n\nAs part of the technology and marketing deal, IBM will provide the products\n\nand services for Terra Lycos' worldwide e-business infrastructure, helping the\n\ncompany service its Web surfers and handle more customers while cutting\n\noperating costs.\n\nThe IBM systems will tie together Terra Lycos' Web-serving, enterprise\n\nresource planning, and customer relationship management and systems. The\n\ncompanies have also agreed to explore marketing opportunities in the future, as\n\nwell as collaborate on research.\n\n\"Today's announcement creates a powerful relationship between IBM and\n\nTerra Lycos,\" said Joaquim Agut, executive chairman of Terra Lycos, in a\n\nstatement. \"The pairing of the two global leaders provides a platform for\n\ntechnology exchanges and collaboration on strategic projects.\"\n\nIt is similar to deal struck by Terra Lycos rival AOL Time Warner Inc., who\n\nhas become known for its myriad of marketing deals this year struck with\n\ndifferent partners, including some of its technology suppliers.\n\nThe deal comes ahead of Terra Lycos' quarterly earnings report next week. The\n\ncompany, like many of its peers, has been hit by the ad slump created by the\n\neconomic slowdown and dot-com bust, and investors will gauge the company on its\n\ncost-cutting efforts and progress toward profitability."
