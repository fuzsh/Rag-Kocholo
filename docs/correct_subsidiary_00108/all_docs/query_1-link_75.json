        "text": "Terra Lycos SA has sold its U.S. subsidiary, Lycos Inc., to the South Korean Internet portal company Daum Communications Corp. in a deal valued at $105 million, Terra Lycos announced Monday.\n\nThe deal, which is subject to regulatory approval in the U.S., will not include Terra Networks USA, or Terra’s stake in Lycos Europe, as those Lycos assets will be transferred to Terra Lycos prior to the completion of the deal, the Barcelona company said.\n\nTerra originally purchased Lycos, based in Waltham, Massachusetts, in May 2000 in a stock deal worth $12.5 billion. According to Terra Lycos, the Lycos assets it is selling to Daum Communications represented about 16 percent of its total earnings in 2003.\n\nTerra Lycos said the sale is part of its plan to refocus its efforts on geographical areas in which it has significant operations and in the Spanish and Portuguese speaking market. For its part, Daum Communications has been expanding its operations internationally, and last month launched a joint venture in Japan with PoweredCom Inc.\n\nREFERENCES: Terra Lycos finds buyer for US unit, Jul. 29, 2004 Terra to Buy Lycos in US$12.5B Stock Deal, May 17, 2000 South Korea’s Daum discussing Lycos aquisition, Jul. 30, 2004"
