The company is part-owner of Lycos Europe, which announced recently that cuts in areas such as administration had succeeded in reducing third quarter losses.\n\nIt is thought that the introduction of charges may be applied to some Lycos Europe e-commerce services, which are paid-for already in some European countries, and some mobile phone site services.\n\nLycos: www.lycos.com\n\nSubscribers can access the New Media database by selecting “New Media” from the drop-down box at the top of this page."
