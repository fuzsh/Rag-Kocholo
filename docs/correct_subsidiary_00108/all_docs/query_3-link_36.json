The combination of Microsoft software and Intel-based servers will deliver a significant performance upgrade, increased scalability and greater reliability to the Lycos Network which is accessed by more than 32 million Lycos customers monthly. This includes the www.lycos.com and the my.lycos.com portals. In addition, the technology provided by Microsoft and Intel will help Lycos to achieve aggressive new product implementations and realize rapid time-to-market objectives.\n\nMicrosoft and Intel additionally announced an e-Business alliance, working together to deliver joint customers best-of-class, end-to-end e-Business solutions as well as offering integration and services to e-Businesses such as Lycos.\n\n\"Lycos selected Microsoft and Intel technology, not only because they deliver a rich user experience and help us meet our aggressive goals with new-product implementation, but also because their e-Business solution makes economic sense, both in terms of capital expense and operating expense,\" said Tim Wright, CIO at Lycos. \"We're looking forward to continuing our relationship with Microsoft and Intel, utilizing their e-Business solutions to help us deliver industry-leading services to our customers.\"\n\nThe Microsoft and Intel technology-based implementation, already in progress, covers a majority of the Lycos Network sites, including the popular www.lycos.com portal.
