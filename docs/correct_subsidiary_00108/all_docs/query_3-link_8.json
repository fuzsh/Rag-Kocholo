        "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — The leading Internet service provider in the Spanish-speaking world is buying Lycos Inc., the first time a major U.S. Web portal has been bought by a foreign company.\n\nThe widely expected acquisition by Terra Networks SA was announced Tuesday. The Spanish company is paying $12.5 billion in stock for its beachhead in the United States, where it likely hopes to attract Hispanic subscribers.\n\nThe new company, to be called Terra Lycos, ties together Lycos' Internet traffic, Terra's access business and the telecommunications infrastructure of Telefonica SA, Spain's largest phone company and the majority owner of Terra.\n\nTelefonica owns wireless networks and broadcast stations in Spain and Latin America . It is also rolling out high-speed Internet access.\n\nContent for the network will come both from Lycos, Telefonica's media holdings and from Bertelsmann AG. Terra and Lycos announced Tuesday a five-year deal with the German media giant to gain access to its vast library of books, music, television and film.\n\nBertelsmann will buy $1 billion in advertising and other services from the new company.\n\nThe Lycos network of Web sites is visited by 33 million people per month, including Internet users in Europe and Asia.\n\nSet up in 1998, Terra has 2 million subscribers in Europe and Latin America, but has found it hard to gain entry to the U.S. market, where an estimated 35 million Spanish-speakers generally have higher incomes than their counterparts south of the border.\n\nLycos already operates a Spanish-language U.S. Web portal, as well as country-specific portals for Spain and many Latin American nations.\n\nJuan Villalonga, the high-profile chairman of Telefonica and Terra Networks, said the new company's relationships with Bertelsmann and Telefonica would give it ``a first-mover advantage to create the first truly global access platform.''\n\nHe said the new company will introduce Web services for mobile phones and Telefonica's high-speed Internet connections.\n\n``We have the ability to not only to offer multiple forms of content, but also multiple forms of connections,'' Robert Davis, chief executive of Lycos, said.\n\nVillalonga will be chairman of the new company, which will be based in Spain, while Davis will be chief executive.\n\nShares of Lycos had climbed 18 percent on Tuesday before the announcement, rising $11.31 1/4 to $72.93 3/4 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, where Terra's shares fell 6 percent, or $3.31 1/4 to $53.56 1/4 .\n\nUnder the merger agreement, Lycos stockholders will get $97.55 worth of Terra stock for each Lycos share, so long as Terra's stock price does not rise or fall more than 20 percent from recent levels. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter.\n\nAnalyst Lanny Baker at Salomon Smith Barney said the terms sell Lycos investors short, giving them only about 40 percent ownership of the combined company even though 60 percent of the revenues would be generated by the Lycos operations.\n\nAlthough Lycos is a profitable company, Terra Networks lost $63.8 million in the first quarter and does not expect to turn a profit until 2003.\n\nTaking another tack, Jupiter Communications analyst Patrick Keane said Lycos investors could smile and ``ride into the sunset,'' noting that the stock market has not been kind to the company. Its shares traded at less than $40 late last month.\n\n``The general perception is that Lycos has been sitting on their hands a bit, while their competitors have been doing deals at a furious pace,'' he said.\n\nKeane said other portals have rushed to create ties with Internet service providers and to differentiate themselves. For instance, the Excite portal was bought by cable access provider At Home, and now specializes in content for its high-speed subscribers.\n\n``In the content space, you really need to be tied to a network,'' Keane said.\n\nA year ago, Lycos was set to be acquired USA Networks Inc., owner of Ticketmaster and the Home Shopping Network, for about $6 billion. The merger was called off after opposition by Lycos investors."
