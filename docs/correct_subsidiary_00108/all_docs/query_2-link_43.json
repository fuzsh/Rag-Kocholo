        "text": "To block form submissions that contain an email address with a free domain, you can turn on the Block free email providers feature in a HubSpot form. This helps you maintain a healthy sending reputation by mitigating potential hard bounces to expired email addresses.\n\nYou can review a list of all blocked email domain providers below. HubSpot regularly monitors free email domains. However, there may be domains that have been blocked, but haven't been added to the list yet. If you encounter this, please try submitting the form with different email address.\n\nYou can also download a CSV file that includes all the domains in the list. If you need to make any manual modifications to the list, you can make these changes, then paste the resulting list into the Email domains to block field instead.\n\nPlease note: by default, some domains below will be blocked regardless of whether the Block free email providers checkbox is selected. These are disposable email domains that become invalid after a short period of time. Keeping these emails can lead to hard bounces which will damage your sending reputation and make it harder for legitimate mail to reach your recipient's inboxes."
