        "text": "NEW YORK -- Spanish Internet group Terra Networks SA agreed Tuesday to buy U.S. Internet search company Lycos Inc. for $12.5 billion in stock, or $97.55 a share, in a move to create one of the world's largest Internet companies and broaden its geographic reach.\n\nThe combined company, which will be called Terra Lycos Inc., will have pro forma 2000 revenues of about $500 million and together currently have an estimated 50 million unique users and 175 million page views per day.\n\nJuan Villalonga, who is chairman of both Telefonica and Terra, will head the merged Lycos-Terra. Robert Davis, currently Lycos president and chief executive, would be the chief executive, the source said.\n\nAs part of the agreement Germany's Bertelsmann AG, the third-largest media company in the world, agreed to purchase $1 billion of advertising, placement and integration services from Terra Lycos worldwide over five years.\n\nTerra-Lycos, meanwhile, will gain access to Bertelsmann's books, music, television, film, and other media content, on preferred terms. This alliance builds on the existing Lycos-Bertelsmann joint venture in Europe, Lycos Europe, of which Bertelsmann will remain a significant shareholder.\n\nLycos is the parent company of Wired News.\n\n- - -\n\nRegister to vote: ABCNEWS.com has reached an agreement with OnlineDemocracy.com that makes ABCNEWS.com the first news site to offer voter registration over the Internet.\n\nThe deal, effective immediately, makes it easier for citizens in 46 states to either register for the first time or to change their voter registration information.\n\nRegistration forms can be obtained at ABCNEWS.com's politics section.\n\n- - -\n\nScotched: The maker of Scotchgard waterproofing products will stop manufacturing part of its line after tests revealed that the chemical compounds involved can linger in the environment and in the human body for several years.\n\nMinnesota Mining and Manufacturing, better known as 3M, said Tuesday that it would phase out product lines that contain perfluorooctanyl, including Scotchgard that is commercially applied to carpets.\n\nThe affected product lines account for about $300 million in annual sales, or about 2 percent of total 3M sales.\n\n- - -\n\nThey sing, they talk: GetMusic said Tuesday that it will host a weekly, hour-long talk show featuring sit-down interviews with band members and music personalities.\n\nThe show, with Rolling Stone magazine contributor Anthony DeCurtis doing the interviews, debuts on May 24 at 8 p.m. EDT. The band Phish will be first up for the webcast.\n\nReuters contributed to this report."
