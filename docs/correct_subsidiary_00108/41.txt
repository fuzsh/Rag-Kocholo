Internet portal company Terra Lycos Inc. has chosen former Raging Bull president and CEO Stephen J. Killeen to lead its U.S. division in Waltham, Mass.

Killeen will report to Terra Lycos President and Executive Chairman Joaquim Agut. Prior to joining the Barcelona, Spain-based company, Killeen was president and director of Marketing Services Group Inc. in New York.

“The U.S. market is the largest in the world, and it is a critical focus for our company to continue to grow our presence in the U.S.,” Agut said in a statement. “Stephen’s exceptional leadership qualities and experience running … Internet companies and large organizations made him the perfect choice for this new, pivotal role at Terra Lycos.”

Killeen said in a statement that he is “thrilled” to be joining the company.

A month ago, Terra Lycos CEO and co-founder Bob Davis resigned over an alleged dispute about his role in the company. Davis was CEO of Waltham, Mass.-based Lycos Inc. before it was acquired by Spanish telecommunications giant Telefonica SA’s Terra Networks subsidiary last year. Terra Networks chief executive Abel Linares and U.S. operations president Ron Sege also resigned.

Andover, Mass.-based financial information site Raging Bull was acquired by Terra Lycos last month.

According to the statement, Killeen will be responsible for revenue, profit and all “customer experience” at the U.S. business unit. His duties will include managing all of the Web sites in the network, sales, product development and marketing areas.

Terra Lycos officials could not be reached for further comment.
