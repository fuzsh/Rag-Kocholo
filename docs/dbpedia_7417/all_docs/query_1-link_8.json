The integration of live news into digital signage not only increases viewership in customer areas such as shops, malls, hotels, airports, banks and hospitals, but also ensures that viewers remain informed about the breaking news when they see signage screens. Nayatel has also upgraded its digital signage solution (now known as Boostboard), making it easy and user-friendly for brands to display public information, promotions, and product details on display TVs. As Hum TV is known for authentic and balanced news reporting, the partnership has great future potential and will offer significant growth to businesses that would use BoostBoard to display their content. https://lnkd.in/eFJDUBTd https://humnews.pk/ Nayatel | HUM Network | Hum Network Ltd | HUM News |\n\nAnd we‚Äôre back with another offer! üî• This month, pay your Nayatel bill through Telenor Microfinance Bank Limited (easypaisa) and participate in our lucky draw!
