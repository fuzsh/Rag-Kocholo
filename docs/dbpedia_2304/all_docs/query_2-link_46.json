        "text": "Main Births etc\n\nCedar Rapids /ˈsiːdərˈræpɪdz/ is the second largest city in Iowa and is the county seat of Linn County. The city lies on both banks of the Cedar River, 20 miles (32 km) north of Iowa City and 100 miles (160 km) east of Des Moines, the state's capital and largest city. Until massive flooding in 2008, the city's government was headquartered in the Veterans Memorial Building, near the Linn County Courthouse and jail on Mays Island in the Cedar River; Cedar Rapids was one of a few cities in the world, along with Paris, France, with governmental offices on a municipal island.[5]\n\nA flourishing center for arts and culture in Eastern Iowa, the city is home to the Cedar Rapids Museum of Art, the National Czech & Slovak Museum & Library, the Paramount Theatre, Theatre Cedar Rapids, the African-American Historical Museum and Cultural Center of Iowa, and the Iowa Cultural Corridor Alliance. Cedar Rapids is an economic hub of the state, located in the core of the Interstate 380 Cedar Rapids/Iowa City Technology Corridor of Linn, Benton, Jones, Johnson, and Washington counties.[6] As of the 2010 United States Census, the city population was 126,326.[7][8]\n\nThe estimated population of the three-county Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes the nearby cities of Marion and Hiawatha, was 255,452 in 2008.[9]\n\nCedar Rapids has been residence to famous figures for the United States, including American Gothic painter Grant Wood, journalist and historian William L. Shirer, writer and photographer Carl Van Vechten, and aerodynamics pioneer Dr. Alexander Lippisch. In the 1990s and 2000s, Hollywood would feature several Cedar Rapidians including actors Bobby Driscoll, Ashton Kutcher, Elijah Wood, and Ron Livingston. The area has also produced a number of professional athletes such as Ryan Sweeney, Trent Green, Zach Johnson, and Kurt Warner, as well as Mark Walter, co-owner and chairman of baseball's Los Angeles Dodgers. The city is also the setting for a musical, The Pajama Game and the comedy film Cedar Rapids.\n\nCedar Rapids is nicknamed the \"City of Five Seasons\", for the \"fifth season\", which is time to enjoy the other four.[1] The symbol of the five seasons is the Tree of Five Seasons sculpture in downtown along the north river bank. The name \"Five Seasons\" and representations of the sculpture appear throughout the city in many forms.[1]\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe location of present-day Cedar Rapids was in the territory of the Fox and Sac tribes.\n\nThe first permanent settler, Osgood Shepherd, arrived in 1838. When Cedar Rapids was first established in 1838, William Stone named the town Columbus. In 1841 it was resurveyed and renamed by N.B. Brown and his associates. They named the town Cedar Rapids for the rapids in the Cedar River at the site, and the river itself was named for the large number of red cedar trees that grew along its banks. Cedar Rapids was incorporated on January 15, 1849.[10] Cedar Rapids annexed the community of Kingston in 1870.\n\nThe economic growth of Cedar Rapids increased in 1871 upon the founding of the Sinclair meatpacking company.\n\nIn 1960, the Census Bureau reported Cedar Rapids' population as 98.6% white and 1.2% black.[11]\n\nFlood of 2008[]\n\nDuring the Iowa flood of 2008, the Cedar River reached a record high of 31.12 feet (9.49 m) on June 13, 2008, the previous record was 20 feet (6.1 m) surpassing the 500-year flood plain. 1,126 city blocks were flooded, or more than 10 square miles (26 km2), 561 city blocks were severely damaged, on both banks of the Cedar River. This is 14% of the city's total area. There were a total of 7,749 flooded properties that had to be evacuated, 5,900 were homes, and 310 were city facilities including the City Hall, Central Fire Station, Main Public Library, Ground Transportation Center, Public Works building, and Animal Control building. It is estimated 1300 or more properties are to be demolished in the Cedar Rapids area because of the flood.[12]\n\nGeography[]\n\nThe city is divided into four quadrants, used in addressing. 1st Avenue (U.S. Route 151 Business) divides the north and south sides of the city, and the Cedar River divides east and west. Mays Island, in the middle of the river, is the only area of the city where addresses have no quadrant. Areas outside of the city limit that use the \"Cedar Rapids\" city name on their mailing address also do not use the quadrants.\n\nExcept in the downtown area, 1st Avenue and the Cedar River tend to run diagonally instead of along the cardinal directions. Due to the curving of 1st Avenue, there are some areas in western Cedar Rapids where NW addresses are actually south of SW addresses.\n\nCedar Rapids is divided into fourteen ZIP Codes. Mays Island and the downtown area are covered by 52401. The northeast quadrant is covered by 52402 and 52411. The southeast quadrant is covered by 52403. The southwest quadrant is covered by 52404. The northwest quadrant is covered by 52405. Post office boxes are covered by ZIP codes 52406, 52407, 52408, 52409, and 52410. Several other ZIP codes are for specific business (Aegon USA, Rockwell Collins, etc.).\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 72.07 square miles (186.66 km2), of which, 70.8 square miles (183.37 km2) is land and 1.27 square miles (3.29 km2) is water.[2]\n\nNeighborhoods[]\n\nCzech Village is located along 16th Avenue SW, which is south of the Cedar River. It is home to such Czech-related businesses as The Czech Cottage, Sykora Bakery, Al's Blue Toad, and Deda and Babi's Antiques. The National Czech & Slovak Museum & Library is one of the major tourist attractions in Cedar Rapids, and the nearby Bohemian National Cemetery may also be of interest to visitors. The National Czech & Slovak Museum's main building was located directly on the river and was badly damaged by the 2008 floods. As of late 2010, the board of directors of the National Czech & Slovak Museum & Library is pursuing a plan to move and then elevate its flood-damaged museum building. There is a temporary location open in Czech Village that people may visit as the main site is in the process of recovery.\n\nThe Cedar Rapids Czech Heritage Foundation is one of many local organizations working to promote and preserve Czech heritage in Cedar Rapids. They support and sponsor many programs and events throughout the year. One of these programs is the Miss Czech-Slovak Iowa pageant. Two Miss Czech-Slovak US queens can claim this community as home: Lisa Volesky and Stasia Krivanek.\n\nOlga Drahozal was the famed band leader of the Czech Plus Polka Band, a performing group that frequents the Kosek Band Stand in Czech Village. She, along with Bessie Duggena and Leona Poduška, taught Czech School (Česká škola) at Wilson Middle School.\n\nIn 2003, the African-American Historical Museum and Cultural Center of Iowa opened its doors. Cedar Rapids is also home to the historic 26 acre (105,000 m²) Brucemore Estate, on which sits a 21-room mansion, and the Masonic Library and Museum.\n\nThere are twelve active neighborhood associations in Cedar Rapids. The neighborhoods nearest downtown include Wellington Heights and Oakhill Jackson in the southeast quadrant and Moundview in the northeast quadrant. Also farther north in the northeast quadrant is the Kenwood Park which was independent until it was incorporated into the Cedar Rapids city limits and Noelridge Park neighborhood. The boundaries of Kenwood are 32nd Street to Oakland Road to Old Marion Road to C Avenue to 40th Street then 1st Avenue between 40th street and 32nd Street.[13]\n\nIn addition to the neighborhood associations in Cedar Rapids, there are many informal, unofficial neighborhoods, such as Bowman Woods, Vernon Heights, Stoney Point, New Bohemia (NewBo) and Wilderness Estates.\n\nIn 2009, Cedar Rapids was rated one of the \"Top 10 cities to Grow Up In\" in the United States, partly due to a low crime rate and a good public school system.[14]\n\nDemographics[]\n\nHistorical populations Year Pop. ±% 1860 1,830 — 1870 5,940 +224.6% 1880 10,104 +70.1% 1890 18,020 +78.3% 1900 25,656 +42.4% 1910 32,811 +27.9% 1920 45,566 +38.9% 1930 56,097 +23.1% 1940 62,120 +10.7% 1950 72,296 +16.4% 1960 92,035 +27.3% 1970 110,642 +20.2% 1980 110,243 −0.4% 1990 108,772 −1.3% 2000 120,758 +11.0% 2010 126,326 +4.6% \"American FactFinder\".

The MSA had a 2000 census population of 237,230, with an estimated 2008 population of 255,452;[9] Linn County was the only county in the MSA before the MSA was redefined after the 2000 census.\n\nAs a growing job center, Cedar Rapids pulls commuters from nearby Marion and Hiawatha. Other towns that have become bedroom communities include Ely, Swisher, Shueyville, Palo, Atkins, Fairfax, Walford, Robins and Bertram.\n\nBased on the 2010 American Community Survey[15] 1 Year Estimates, the median income for a household in the city was $51,186, and the median income for a family was $63,265. Males had a median income of $40,413 versus $26,402 for females. The per capita income for the city is $26,370. About 6.3% of families and 11.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 15.5% of those under the age of 18 and 4.3% of those 65 or older.\n\n2010 census[]\n\nAs of the census[16] of 2010, there were 126,326 people, 53,236 households, and 30,931 families residing in the city.

The average household size was 2.31 and the average family size was 2.95.\n\nAge spread: 23.5% under the age of 18, 11.2% from 18 to 24, 27.4% from 25 to 44, 24.8% from 45 to 64, and 13.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 35.3 years. For every 100 females there were 96.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 94.4 males.[17]\n\n2000 census[]\n\nIn the 2000 census, Cedar Rapids was 91.9% non-Hispanic white, with well over half of the population claiming a specific ethnic European ancestry, such as Germans (35.5%), Irish (17.1%), English (9.4%), Czechs (7.8%), Norwegians (5.1%), and French from either France or Canada (3.2%).[18] The city also has a growing minority population: for example, in the three-year period from 2006 to 2008, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated that 4.9% of the Cedar Rapids population identified as African Americans, up from 3.7% in the 2000 census.[18][19]\n\nMuslim heritage[]\n\nCedar Rapids has played an important role in Muslim culture in the United States. The National Muslim Cemetery on 12 acres (49,000 m2) of land donated by Haj. Yahya William Aossey in 1948 is said to be the first exclusively Muslim cemetery in North America. Graves in the cemetery face Mecca.[20] The Mother Mosque of America, dedicated on June 16, 1934, is the longest standing mosque in North America.[21][22] In 1972, another mosque was built and the original mosque was sold and fell into disrepair before being purchased in 1990 by the Islamic Council of Iowa and renovated.[23][24] It is on the National Register of Historic Places. The Iowa flood of 2008 extensively damaged the basement, destroying many historic documents.\n\nMuslim presence in the area dates to 1895 when the first immigrants arrived from the Beqaa Valley in today's Lebanon and Syria.[25] Islamic Services of America (I.S.A.) was established in Cedar Rapids in 1975 and provides Halal Certification and supervision throughout the world.[26]\n\nEconomy[]\n\nCedar Rapids is one of the largest cities in the world for corn processing. The grain processing industry is Cedar Rapids' most important sector, directly providing 4,000 jobs that pay on average $85,000, and also providing 8,000 indirectly.[28] Fortune 500 company Rockwell Collins is based in Cedar Rapids,[29] and Aegon has its United States headquarters there. A large Quaker Oats mill, one of the four that merged in 1901 to form Quaker Oats, dominates the north side of downtown. Other large companies that have facilities in Cedar Rapids include Archer Daniels Midland, Cargill, General Mills, Toyota Financial Services and Nordstrom.[28] Newspaperarchive, based in Cedar Rapids, is the largest newspaper archive in North America with a repository of more than 150 million pages assembled over 250 years; it was taken offline for two days by the 2008 flood.\n\nTop employers[]\n\nAccording to Cedar Rapids' 2011 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,[30] the top employers in the area are:\n\n# Employer # of Employees 1 Rockwell Collins 8,700 2 Aegon 3,872 3 St. Luke's Hospital 3,184 4 Cedar Rapids Community School District 2,936 5 Hy-Vee 2,599 6 Mercy Medical Center 2,312 7 Whirlpool 2,225 8 Kirkwood Community College 1,895 9 City of Cedar Rapids 1,311 10 Quaker Oats Company 1,018\n\nArts and culture[]\n\nCedar Rapids is home to Orchestra Iowa, the Paramount Theatre, Theatre Cedar Rapids, and Brucemore, a National Trust Historic Site, among others.\n\nCedar Rapids is also home to the Cedar Rapids Museum of Art, The Cedar Rapids Ceramics Center, Legion Art's CSPS Hall, the National Czech & Slovak Museum & Library, the African American Historical Museum, Kirkwood Community College's Iowa Hall Gallery, and the legendary Grant Wood Studio at 5 Turner Alley.

It has many facilities including Camp Wapsie.[35]\n\nGovernment[]\n\nCedar Rapids mayors since 1969 Mayor In office Don Canney 1969–1992 Larry Serbousek 1992–1995 Lee Clancey 1995–2002 Paul Pate 2002–2006 Kay Halloran 2006–2009 Ron Corbett[36] 2010–\n\nFrom April 6, 1908, to December 31, 2005, Cedar Rapids used the city commission form of government. It was one of the few larger American cities remaining to operate under this model. Under this form of government, the council was made up of a public safety commissioner, a streets commissioner, a finance commissioner, a parks commissioner, and a mayor. The council members worked on a full-time basis, served two-year terms, and were considered department heads. Don Canney, the longest serving mayor in city history, served for twenty-two years under this system.[37] The last mayor of Cedar Rapids under this form of government was Paul Pate.\n\nIn 2005 the Cedar Rapids Area Chamber of Commerce spearheaded a movement to change from the commission form of government. A panel was appointed by Mayor Pate and the City Council to study the issue, and recommended that voters be presented with three options:\n\nStay with the current commission form of government.\n\nAdopt a \"strong mayor form\" where the council would be part-time, the mayor would be full-time, and a city manager would run the day-to-day affairs of the city.\n\nAdopt a \"weak mayor form\" of government, in this form the mayor and council would both work on a part-time basis. A full-time city manager would run the day-to-day operations of the city.\n\nOn June 14, 2005, voters went to the polls to decide whether to adopt a new form of government or continue with the commission form. 28,818 of the 83,514 registered voters (29.72%) cast ballots on the issue. 68.80% of the voters decided to adopt a new form of government.[38] Elections were held on November 8, 2005 and 30 candidates ran. Kay Halloran, a retired attorney and state legislator, became the first mayor elected under the new system. Several members of the city council were elected outright; however, the remaining races were close enough to require a runoff election, which took place in December.\n\nCedar Rapids now has an Iowa \"Home Rule\" charter which establishes a weak mayor system with a part-time City Council and Mayor both on four-year terms.[39]\n\nEducation[]\n\nCedar Rapids is home to two four-year colleges: Coe College and Mount Mercy University.
