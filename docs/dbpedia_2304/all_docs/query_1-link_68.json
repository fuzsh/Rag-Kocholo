        "text": "Reviewed By 417owenb - Council Bluffs, United States\n\nSo a date night at our age consists of a nice meal and shopping. We had eaten here I once before about 3 years ago a d had a nice meal so since we were in the area decided to try it again. The open area concept of the combination of Bar and dinning area blends nicely. It was fairly busy and the the noise from the bar was not a problem. The waitress was prompt and answered all our questions. Now for the food. I had the Pork tenderloin with onion rings, my wife had the Patty melt with waffle fries. The tenderloin was cooked perfectly, crust was crispy and light. The meat was tender and juicy. Garnish on the side. Onion rings were thick and cooked perfectly and the blue cheese I ordered to dip them in was thick. My wifes patty melt (which she ordered well done) was cooked the way she likes it. Her waffle fries were crispy on the outside and soft in the middle just the way they are supposed to be! We wont wait 3 years again before going back. ????"
