        "text": "Reviewed By crschwab - Red Deer, Canada\n\nDuring a visit the Omaha we wanted to check out a movie theatre and happened on this theatre as one close to our hotel. We were pleasantly surprised at how nice, clean and efficient this theatre was. They have a full bar on site, you can even bring your drinks into the theatre. We were there on a weeknight and the place was so quiet. The concession was fast and easy. What really excited us about this theatre were the plus red leather chairs that recline and have foot rests. Something we had never seen in a traditional movie theatre. This was the most enjoyable and comfortable I have every had/felt in a theatre. We even decided to come back a second night just to experience it again but didn't stay as the move choices had changed and we didn't want to see any of them.\n\nReviewed By cheetahwind\n\nLove the buffet, something about a AAA 4 diamond buffet always keeps a person interested. The sports bar has a nice selection of drinks, appetizers, and food as well. The rooms are nice and spacious and have that upgraded feel to them. The casino has plenty of selection of slots from the newest to some of the older style slots as well. I was a bit disappointed that there was a lack of a high roller blackjack option available on a Friday night. That was one of the perks of this place was they always had a separate pit for the high rollers. Yet I'm guessing this isn't the case anymore since they've introduced bacarrat. Otherwise the casino is nice, slots play just fine, the free drinks while playing tables is a perk. The only other downside is the fact you have to put 1,000 points on your card before you can redeem anything."
