        "text": "23rd March 2024 – (Hong Kong) In a remarkable achievement, Fu Ka-ching, the 16-year-old daughter of renowned actor Alex Fong Chung-shun, formerly known as Fu Lik, and former Miss Hong Kong, Hoyan Mok, has made her mark as a member of the Hong Kong Equestrian Team. Known for her elegance and grace, Fu Ka-ching bears a striking resemblance to her accomplished mother.\n\nAs a member of the Hong Kong Jockey Club Junior Equestrian Team, Fu Ka-ching has recently gained further recognition by appearing on Hong Kong Radio and sharing insights into her daily routine. Having attended an international school since childhood, she speaks with an endearing charm that captivates listeners.\n\nFu Ka-ching’s talent in the field of sports is truly exceptional. She began learning horse riding at the age of seven and has since focused on competing in the equestrian triathlon. In October 2022, she secured fourth place in the HKE80 category at the Beas River Country Club Triathlon. Subsequently, in February 2023, she achieved seventh place in the same category."
