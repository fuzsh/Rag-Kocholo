        "text": "Hong Kong actor\n\nFor the former Hong Kong swimmer turned actor and singer with the same English name, see Alex Fong (singer).\n\nAlexander Fong Chung-sun (Chinese: 方中信; born 17 March 1963) is a Hong Kong actor. He married actress Hoyan Mok in 2008; they have one daughter.\n\nIncidents\n\n[edit]\n\nFong has been a brand representative of DOXA, a brand of watches since 2008. In the opening ceremony of DOXA's flagship store in Guangzhou, Fong was sexually harassed by another female guest at the event. DOXA issued an open declaration stating Fong's under-performing had harmed the image of the brand, and therefore they terminated the arrangement. Mani Fok, the representative of the artist management that Fong belonged to, explicitly said that the issues involved some requirements which were outside the signed contract as a brand representative.
