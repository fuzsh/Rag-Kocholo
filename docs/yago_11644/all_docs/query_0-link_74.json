        "text": "Days and Nights at the Museums\n\nAugust 30, 2012\n\nBLOG BY FELICIA (29th August 2012)\n\nMost of us would have thought the museums would be boring, seeing old, historical stuffs. The Singapore Museums have done a great job and installed exhibits not just for the historical values. They have exhibits for family and kids too! There were many good programs and mostly interactive ones that were really interesting and kids loved it!\n\nHere’s our 4 days trip to the Museums over 2 weeks!\n\nThe Peranakan Museum\n\n(Armenian Street)\n\nThinking it would be just a showcase of old Peranakan heritage objects, furniture and outfits, I didn’t have much expectation. But I had always wanted to come coz the museum building was my formal primary school (Tao Nan School) building back in 1912! By the time I enrolled in this school, she had moved to her second home at Marine Parade.\n\nElkan and Jovin were wondering around this small three-stories building looking out for motifs to be embossed on their little handouts where upon completion of all the motifs found in the museum, they will receive a small gift! They get to do some fun ink stampings on postcards. And we watching Elkan and Jovin did a stint pretending to be a character in “Emily of Emerald Hill”, a famous play about a young Peranakan bride in the 20th century. They were both all dressed up in the sarong and kebaya! After the stint is recorded, we get to view other videos, and vote our favorite!\n\nMy mum and me walked around looking and admiring the exhibits. I must say the exhibits was really a great collection and well presented. The famous bead works on their traditional shoes was amazing! So much details made from the tiny beads. We came visit this museum two days in a row as Elkan wanted to do more embossing and try the stint again, pretending to be another character. We spent a good 2 hours there each visit. Better than straying in the malls!\n\nSingapore Art Museum at Q8\n\n(Queen Street)\n\nThis is a museum just for kids! There was not many exhibits but more interactive and little fun activities to engage your kids with handy crafts and drawings. There was a round table tennis table which Joe had blogged before. Unfortunately, when Joe was back then, the museum was closed that day. So we came back again.\n\nA giant octopus that flashes colourful lights from its body when it sensed that you are near! A thrill for young toddlers. Grow a night garden in the city! Learn to fold flower and butterfly origami and grow them in a glowing night garden. Scream…. kids! And see what comes out from your screams on the screen! Doreamon, flowers, cartoons or super heros?? Dance silly and have a good laugh! Save mother earth, colour and plant your own trees on the wall. Use mummy’s cloths peg from the kitchen and make nice repeat patterns on a piece of clay.\n\nWe went there twice too. Elkan sweats it out with other kids in a game of table tennis at the outdoor round table tennis table. While I sit comfortably on a sofa indoors with aircon, gaming on my iphone :p. Heee…..\n\nSingapore National Museum\n\n(Stamford Road)\n\nWe signed up for a museum tour about weddings old and new from 200 years ago, Victorian styles to our local weddings of different ethnic groups. So we got up early that day, arrived on time. But found out that we were the only ones who turned up……. Well, the organizers decides to go ahead even with just two of us. So while waiting…… Suddenly, a Caucasian lady dashed into the exhibit hall frantically and crumbled onto the ground, crying loudly! Elkan was shocked and hid behind me. I was taken aback too. But after a while I realised that it was an act! An interactive performance with the audience to help this lady plan her wedding. Haha… it was a brilliant idea.\n\nAnd so, she relates to us, showing us her awful bright green wedding dress that was supposed to be white. And all preparations were not ready for her wedding which falls on the next day. So help came when another performer walked in and introduced himself as a wedding dress designer and we got involved in this wedding planning! Elkan managed to find some veils, gloves and picked his favorite dress design and put together a wedding dress for the lady. Learned interesting customs like breaking a glass to signify congratulating to a Jewish couple. He even helped wrote a wedding vow for the lady, completing a simple poems that rhymes. No prizes won. But was great fun.\n\nSingapore Art Museum\n\n(Bras Basah Road)\n\nIt’s a colorful event of the Night Festival. A series of light installations that stretches from The School of the Arts (SOTA) to the Singapore Art Museum (SAM), Singapore Management University (SMU) and the National Museum of Singapore.\n\nThere were enlarged children’s drawing of fairy tale characters lighted up outside SOTA. Musicians and dancers attracted lots of passerby to stop and enjoy their performance along the streets and in the big open space within the SMU compound. The projected images on the facade of the SAM and National Museum was fascinating! Old, new, nature, faces, animals, and architectural images were flashed onto the building. It was sightisfying!\n\nHyper-Activation Day!\n\nAugust 22, 2012\n\nWe had our first “Action-Day” yesterday. It was our first team-bonding session to kickstart next year’s creative goals. 2012 has been an awfully hectic year for many of us. With more new young faces (Hoyan, Clara, Tommy and Crystal) joining our team, we picked an unusual conference venue – on a boat!\n\nThe weather was fantastic! No typhoon or smog, it was all sunny and clear blue sky. What a great way to mix work and play! On second thought, I might prefer the more cozy air-conditioned 5-star hotel conference room. I have no idea that it was so physical-demanding. (Honestly, I thought it was simply hot bikinis, yummy BBQ food and napping on a hammock!) First stop – the “Leap of Faith“. While leaping off the 3m tall deck, I landed terribly on my big tummy. No tsunami waves but I suffered a painful water slap on my chest. I heard roaring laughters louder than the ocean! (Terrible colleagues!) Next, the 400m swim to and fro the beach nearly killed me. Guess my lazy bones couldn’t take this kind of “hard work”.\n\nNevertheless, I saw many “courageous” and unusual acts by my colleagues. Valerie took a dip into the water – despite not knowing how to swim! David and Mayee leapt off the deck despite their “height phobia”. Tracy, Kurt and Kelly struggled to keep their balance in their first wake-boarding trials. Harry impressed the girls with his suave wake-boarding moves. Tai-tai Chowpo maintained her stylish look despite all those hard physical workouts. New Tommy boy and hot “mama” Clara bonded well with the team. And Harshad sunk the banana boat and conquered the demons inside his heart. All is well!\n\nIt was an extraordinary day for all of us – burnt bodies, aching muscles, laughters and tears! It wasn’t the food or the boat that made this day special. It was the strong bonding of this team and the things we did together that made this day special. Most of us returned to office today with aching bodies (back, neck, shoulder, head…) For once, we arrived early and no one is complaining. Time to get the head cracking for creative concepts. Enjoy the photos.\n\nMeet the new Action Hero – “Lutetium-Man”\n\nAugust 1, 2012\n\nPersonalisation isn’t a new thing. But to impersonate a superhero is a great ego booster. Meet my new alter ego – Lutetium-Man! Actually, my head is resting on a 12-inch Ironman Mark II body but I got to find a metal name “more precious” than iron. My colleague Valerie pointed out that Lutetium is the rarest and most precious metal. (And Titanium-Man is a Marvel Super Villain.)\n\nThat’s My Face.com (http://www.thatsmyface.com) is the company that produced my 3D head. It is a US-based company and the friendly staffs offer great services! Simply submit your head-shots online and let them do the rest. I submitted my photos 3 weeks ago and I received the heads today. (A sweet surprise when I opened the parcel! I paid for 1 head but they gave me 3 different heads!) That’s My Face offers many different sizes / formats of heads – for different sized figurines. Price varies depending on your final configuration. I ordered the typical 12-inch figurine head (as most of my superheroes collections are in that size). This is a great gift idea for friends or colleagues. (We made a Superman birthday gift for my boss David last month! Opps…we haven’t paid Tracy the present money!)\n\nOnce you have paid for your order, the guys at That’s My Face will email you a couple of hi-res 3D images for your approval. They will not proceed to production without your approval – so you can be ensure of the quality of your 3D heads. I have tried other “personalisation” companies that produce cartoonish clay characters, they did not allow me to “preview” my head before/during production. Most of the times, the resemblance rate is fairly low.\n\nClearly, I have chosen a different hairdo for my 3D head and made some “cosmetic” improvement. I got rid of my chubby neckline for a more masculine jawline. It is an alter ego, why not make it more stylo, right? I customised a long-hair version for my “Ah Beng” character. Unfortunately, That’s My Face couldn’t provide me a pair of glasses for my 3D head. On second thought, no superhero wears glasses in their suit anyway. The guys at That’s My Face kept as much details as possible – they managed to retain my skin-tone, lips, eyes and my moles! I gave them a high 90% rating (honestly, it is difficult to be 100% especially when this is done over photographs submitted online). The only small thing I didn’t like is the rough texture. It is not the typical smooth rubbery, waxy figurine material. But that is not a big issue for me.\n\nThe initial response at my office? My colleagues thought I cheated with my 20-year old photos. One loved it so much that she wanted to customise a Transformer Bumblebee for her son. My wife texted me “Huh…Is that you in long hair????” My boss was quite worried about the new supersize me, he asked me to take a good break from work.\n\nWell, I love it. I bet Elkan is screaming for his alter ego right now! Love to make 1 for him and Felicia. Maybe it is time to assemble my own “Incredibles” members. (Some suggestions: Kalinda as Cat Woman, Lionnel as the Elastic-Man, Harshad as the Hulk, Tracy as Alice of Resident Evil, Joey as Spider-girl, Karen as Green Lantern, Felicia as Wonder-Woman, Joanne as Black Widow, Jimmy as Thor, Gareth as Hellboy, Duuk as Wolverine and Juliana as Electra!) Of course, it is good to become an Action Hero and there can be only 1 “Lutetium-Man”."
