        "text": "​\n\nHailed as Hong Kong’s Richard Gere, Alex Fong Chung-sun (方中信) used to be the prodigal son. When he first started dating 1993 Miss Hong Kong winner Hoyan Mok (莫可欣) in the late 90’s, Alex’s triad rule was “no marriage, no kids, only dogs.” Who knew that twelve years later, the couple would not only get married, but also have a daughter, Fu Ka-ching (符迦晴).\n\nKa-ching was born in June 2008. Alex and Hoyan registered for marriage only two days before her birth. For the first time in his life, Alex set his goals for his family rather than for himself. The money that he spent was not for his car collection, but for his wife and daughter.\n\nAccording to a recent tabloid report, Alex just purchased an apartment suite in the luxury residential complex Bel-Air Residence for $30 million HKD—and 50 percent of that ownership went to Hoyan. Alex also invested in a $610,000 HKD Benz, which also went to his wife.\n\nSuccess of the high-budget drama The Legend of Miyue <羋月傳>, which sees Alex starring alongside one of China’s highest-paid actresses Sun Li (孫儷), has pushed his career in Mainland China to an all-time high. Alex reportedly earned over 300,000 RMB per episode for the drama. Alex has also garnered praise for his portrayal as Kent Cheung in the TVB legal drama Law dis-Order <律政強人>, winning him a fruitful amount of endorsements in Hong Kong.\n\nOnce a self-certified diamond bachelor himself, it is surprising to see how much Alex has mellowed down after starting a family with Hoyan. After getting into a minor accident with another car driver, the first person Alex called was his wife. To give Hoyan a birthday surprise, Alex drove all the way to Kowloon City to buy a special rose cake for her.\n\nDespite Alex’s constant travels due to work, his bond with his wife and daughter remains strong. Perhaps their trust in each other is what makes their relationship stay so strong.\n\nCreds: Eastweek"
