It has been widely rumored TVB excluded Yoyo Mung from the series promotion because she is going to join Ricky Wong's HKTV. Indeed, Yoyo was absent from the first promotional event, but she's still seen in the center on the large series poster at the event. Producer Marco Law denied that he's cutting Yoyo off. He expressed he and Yoyo have consensus to promote selectively.\n\nAs for Yoyo not participating in the series promotion? Alex said: \"She chose her own path, she can take her path however she likes to. (Her contract hasn't ended yet, but she's not allowed to participate in the promotion, do you think TVB is being too sensitive?) They have less empathy, but thinking in the shoes of a large company like TVB, you cannot blame them. Since she intends to leave the company, then should complete all the series promotions first and then when the contract ends, she can go discuss contracts with other companies. That makes the situation less complicated. (Yoyo should learn from you?) Of course, I would say its best to go back to Mainland and make the Chinese yuan! (Has Ricky Wong invited you to join HKTV?) I was approached by them before, but I believe a salary of several HK$10,000 per episode, there is no reason why TVB can't give me that same offer. I believe working in a familiar environment is better. If TVB calls me back, I will definitely come back to help them. I'm currently freelance and don't have plans of becoming a contracted artist for any company.\" Producer Marco Law expressed he and Yoyo are good friends. He stressed he did not boycott Yoyo, he said: \"There is Yoyo in the promotional clips and on the poster. Yesterday she came back to shoot the TVB Weekly cover. We discussed with Catherine Tsang already and all have consensus that she will promote selectively.”\n\nWhen Tavia Yeung learned it was her idol Alex’s 50th birthday on March 17th, she gave him a birthday kiss. Asked if she’s afraid rumored boyfriend Him Law will get jealous? She’s not afraid because Him likes Alex too and will definitely applaud. Tavia is actually more worried Alex’s wife Hoyan Mok might get jealous. In regards to Yoyo not being able to participate in the promotions and Tavia will have to take the flag? Tavia said: “Alex is one of the main leads too and has many housewife fans. She feels a little disappointed that she cannot promote with Yoyo, but unfortunately TVB has their policies.”\n\nAimee said with a smile that she still feels happy despite being teased because she's used to it. She said: \"I hope the audience will get the 'Chan Mo disease' and 'Aimee disease' too, and support my series!\" Yesterday it was White Day (3/14), Aimee expressed Valentine's Day (2/14th) is more important to her.\n\nclass=\"ipsType_pagetitle\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 26px; font-weight: 300; line-height: 1.3; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(50, 50, 50); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"Tavia Yeung’s Lie Detector Reading Unstable When Asked About Love LifeSunday March 24, 2013 Hong KongSource: The SunTranslated by: aZnangel @ http://asianuniverse.net\n\nYesterday Tavia Yeung, Aimee Chan, Christine Kuo, Edwin Siu, Matthew Ko and the rest of the cast of TVB series A Great Way to Care II attended the promotional event. The event organizer hired a psychiatrist to assist in the games. The psychiatrist brought a lie detector with him and tested it on Tavia, Aimee and Christine. When Ronald Law asked Tavia how she's currently doing in her love life? Tavia changed the subject: \"I have outdoor shooting later.\" The lie detector readings were not stabled either, the psychiatrist explained its because Tavia is feeling extremely uncomfortable.\n\nWhen Aimee was asked whether she has an especially good feeling for anyone by the surname of Chan? She didn't know how to answer either and just smiled. The test results indicated that Aimee's heart was beating fast, the others teased its because she drank too much coffee.\n\nThen it was Oscar Leung's turn to ask questions. He asked Christine if she went to Aaron Kwok's concert a few nights ago and if Aaron invited her? Christine remained calm and chose not to answer. Leanne Li appeared in a black sleeveless top, which revealed her red colored bra and attracted a lot of attention.\n\nEarlier Matthew Ko and Christine were spotted quite intimate at Stefan Huyuh's wedding, Christine explained: \"Perhaps because we are too friend.\" As for Matthew, he expressed he had always had many MCI friends, \"Probably because they all live in Tseung Kwan O and sometimes I take them home after work.\" When asked what is their relationship? Christine said: \"Just friends. (Any chance to develop further?) I have an open attitude, won't say if there is a possibility or not.\" Matthew agreed: \"Christine and I came back from Toronto, so we have more in common.\"\n\nclass=\"ipsType_pagetitle\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 26px; font-weight: 300; line-height: 1.3; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(50, 50, 50); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"Edwin Siu 36th Birthday, Haven't Thought of Marrying Gigi Ho YetSunday March 24, 2013 Hong KongSource: Oriental DailyTranslated by: aZnangel @ http://asianuniverse.net\n\nEdwin Siu celebrated his 36th birthday with a large group of friends including Alex Fong, Johnson Lee, Otto Chan, Sharon Chan, Christine Ng and 'girlfriend' Gigi Ho. Edwin's popularity has been on the rise due to his recent role as the 'Buck Teeth Boy' in A Great Way to Care II. Edwin's birthday was on March 23rd, his friends threw him a surprised birthday party at a restaurant on the 22nd. Edwin said: \"They asked me to help get stuff, but then I saw them all there. Many of them gave me glasses, perhaps because of my recent 'Buck Teeth Boy' look.\"\n\nWhen asked what his rumored girlfriend Gigi Ho gave him? He denied the relationship, but revealed: \"She and her sister Lily Ho spent a lot, they both pitched in to buy me a new computer, probably because they knew my computer is broken. We're just friends though.\"\n\nJohnson and his girlfriend Bobo Wong ('spring roll') were rumored to have broken up, but Edwin disclosed the two appeared as normal. This is the first time Edwin had seen them attend a private party together. Bobo expressed her relationship with Johnson is stabled.\n\nYesterday afternoon at the A Great Way to Care II promotion, Edwin was asked since he's a big boy now, when is he planning to get married? He said: \"Never thought about it. My career is my priority. (Have consensus with Gigi?) No need, I have always kept my relationships low-profile. Also, we are just good friends.\" Edwin is pretty lucky in this series, he has several scenes with Aimee Chan and Christine Kuo. He joked: \"Many guys envy me. Later, I'll have a kiss scene with Aimee and then another getting wet rain scene with Christine. (Will Gigi Ho get jealous?) There won't be anyone jealous, they should all be happy for me.\"\n\nclass=\"ipsType_pagetitle\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 26px; font-weight: 300; line-height: 1.3; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(50, 50, 50); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"Alex Fong & Tavia Yeung Fight Out a \"Brotherly\" RelationshipThursday March 28, 2013 Hong KongSource: Oriental DailyTranslated by: aZnangel @ http://asianuniverse.net\n\nSince The Building Blocks of Life several years ago, Alex Fong and Tavia Yeung collaborate once again in TVB new series A Great Way to Care II. Although they aren't a couple, just a doctor and a police undercover investigating the same case, they still had chemistry right from the start. Tavia regards Alex as the 'TV Drama Soul', she complimented that his performances are steady and has his own style to portray the role, which helps his co-stars easily get into character. She believed if the new generation actors can learn this strength of his, then there will definitely be good prospects.\n\nWhen speaking of having scenes opposite of this handsome Alex Fong, one can easily get 'electrified' by him? Tavia laughed and said their relationship is like brothers. When they were filming, they mutually showed off their skills and prepare their responses together beforehand. Many times, Alex would test her to see if she could improvise on the spot. She said: \"The grudge between Alex and I started from Building Blocks of Life. The moment we met, we started fighting and it can get really intense too. Although Christine Ng is the strongest, when the three of us come together, we could really play hard. We're always breaking the props on the set. He pushes me; I bump him, but all of the bruises are on us, he gets none of it. But it's a joy still.\"\n\nAlthough Tavia encountered a playful co-star, she did not hesitate to say that Alex does have his attentive side too. She disclosed during filming, she had an unhappy incident happen to her and as a good friend, he went to comfort her. Even though he just said a few words, but it's the thought that counts. Tavia said: \"At the time, my emotions weren't that bad. When I got to work, I still played with Alex. I thought the things the aren't true, I shouldn't let them bother me. I really have to let it go. My colleagues won't know that much, they could only support me spiritually and cannot help me resolve the issues, but now it's already the past. Don't have to pay too much attention to it and not like it's a big deal.\"\n\nAlex praised Tavia back, expressing her acting is great otherwise she couldn't have become TV Queen. The playful him did not forget to tease Tavia: \"Now you have more life experiences, in both your acting and love life. If not, then don't take the TV Queen title! Actually dating is a part of life, next time just don't lean towards that area again when you vomit! But, I do have to compliment that you have good ethics of an artist.

The actress, who was renewed to a series regular in the first line sitcom, \"Come Home Love\" since late 2012, also stars in second line serial, \"Sergeant Tabloid\" with Niki Chow and PG rated drama, \"A Great Way to Care 2\", which premiered since last week.\n\nConsequently, viewers are complaining that the actress' recurrences only caused confusion to which character belongs to what drama.\n\nHowever, this is not the first time TVB has been caught reusing the same actors in their dramas over and over again. Two years ago, veteran Hong Kong actor Law Lok Lam made it to the international news when he died in five different television dramas that aired in a 24-hour period, while earlier this year, veteran actress Mary Hon's characters in both \"Friendly Fire\" and \"Missing You\" were broadcast on the same days, sharing the same story arc that dealt with her reuniting with her sons.\n\nclass=\"ipsType_pagetitle\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 26px; font-weight: 300; line-height: 1.3; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(50, 50, 50); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"TVB Hosts Celebration for 'Friendly Fire', 'Sergeant Tabloid' & 'A Great Way to Care II'Saturday September 14, 2013 Hong Kong\n\nSource: Oriental Daily\n\nTranslated by: aZnangel @ http://asianuniverse.net\n\nEarlier TVB established a cross-platform ratings, resulting in several of the series reaching the 30 point mark. Last night TVB chairman Norman Leung hosted a celebration for the cast of Friendly Fire, Sergeant Tabloid and A Great Way to Care II, the contestants and crew of Miss HK and The Voice of the Stars. The celebration had 19 tables and over 200 artists and behind-the-scenes crew in attendance. The attendees included Michael Tse, Tavia Yeung, Kate Tsui, Niki Chow, Sharon Chan, Mandy Wong and many more. TVB boss Charles Chan, General Manager Mark Lee, Production & Resource Director Virgina Lok and executive Catherine Tsang were there as well. Norman Leung boasted during the toast that TVB will forever be the boss! The audience cheered loudly in response. Norman expressed the next celebration will be in October for Triumph in the Skies II.\n\nEven though Michael's contract had already expired, he was still arranged to sit at the executive's table. Michael and the TVB boss were seen chatting closely, it appears there might be big plans in the works! Earlier it was said Niki Chow is dating Mainland actor Jeremy Jones, although she expressed they are just friends, she urged the public to give them a chance to develop. Asked what about Jeremy attracts her? Niki said: \"A good guy, he's filal and ambitious. (What did he get you for your birthday?) I don't have to say it. (He gave himself to you?) Not that old fashioned. (A kiss?) I don't remember. After all, I'm currently very happy. Thank you all for the concern.\"\n\nTavia Yeung had just completed shooting for her new series Property Protector, she expressed recently she has been resting to treat her collar bone spurs and lower back injury. She said: \"Friends told me to go swimming to relax. (Ask former life guard Him Law to teach you!) There is no place in Hong Kong where nobody can take pictures of you. I'm afraid of water, I don't want to be calling for help so often.\"\n\nIn regards to the saying that there is \"nobody\" in TVB, Miss Lok said TVB Siu Sangs have always been best sellers; their artists have many opportunities and the company will not stop them from making money externally. She added TVB is like a parent allowing them (the artists) to go out and experience working elsewhere, it is a good thing and TVB's goal is hoping the artists can shoot 2 TVB series a year. She said: \"We're very harsh, must sign long-term contracts, even the first line artists. As you all say, we hire external help such as Eddie Cheung and Lawrence Ng. Anthony Wong and Tony Leung are coming back soon as well.\""
