        "text": "Although Hoyan Mok (莫可欣) is now better known as Alex Fong’s (方中信) wife, the 51-year-old was crowned Miss Hong Kong 1993. Her win at the time was marked with controversy, as many complained that she was not beautiful enough to win the crown. When Hoyan dated and eventually married Alex, many felt that she was not good enough for him.\n\nDespite her pageant win, Hoyan’s career at TVB was lackluster as she held mainly supporting roles in her five-year stint there. After leaving TVB in the 1990s, she began working as an assistant for a construction company. Recalling this career shift, Hoyan expressed, “I couldn’t adapt to the 9-to-5 work life. I quit after three months. After punching in my time card, I would sneak into the bathroom to nap for 20 minutes.”\n\nFading away from the entertainment industry after she started dating Alex in 1996, Hoyan was the ideal girlfriend in her patience. Despite facing public disapproval, the couple eventually married in 2008 and welcomed the arrival of their daughter.\n\nSince becoming a mother, Hoyan has primarily stayed away from the public eye. However, she recently accepted an interview and graciously shared how she and Alex maintain their 12-year marriage. “It is not all sunshine and butterflies. We are quite different when it comes to work. Our paths and pace are different. To maintain our marriage, we really need to accommodate one another. He is the one who often starts arguments. I don’t like arguing, and would rather give him annoyed looks.”\n\nAlex, who is dubbed as “Hong Kong’s Richard Gere,” saw beyond Hoyan’s looks, “She is not beautiful, but she has a great personality. We are very compatible and get along well. It is fate.”\n\nHer Buddhist beliefs also inspire Hoyan to cherish her marriage–as fate brought them together in this lifetime, she wants to make the best out of their limited time together. She said, “We have the fate of husband and wife. Perhaps there was something in our past lives that we still owe one another, so we were brought together in this life to settle the score. I said to Alex, why don’t we treat each other better in this life and clear the score board, so that we hopefully will not become husband and wife again in the next life? That way, we won’t owe each other anything and can just be friends.”\n\nSource: Hket"
