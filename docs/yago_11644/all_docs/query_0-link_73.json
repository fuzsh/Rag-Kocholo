        "text": "La Vache\n\nWhen I was doing my stage in France, this middle-aged lady would come to the B&B and help out every time there was a big catering event. She was an odd bird, and one of her ticks was she would involuntarily yelp “oh la vache!” roughly five times an hour. Sheerly through osmosis, I gradually found myself doing the same every time something went wrong in the kitchen, ie. often.\n\nKeep reading\n\nPlat du Jour\n\nFor the first time in many weekends, I managed to get out of bed early enough to get to Island East Markets and try the lobster roll that everyone has been talking about. Let’s just say it’s no Burger and Lobster. Anyway, as we were leaving, we walked around the corner and stumbled upon Plat du Jour, Swire’s first restaurant outside of a hotel.\n\nKeep reading\n\nBrick Lane, Admiralty\n\nI always thought Brick Lane served Indian curries, but my sister told me that they actually served a mean fish and chips. She suggested I try it, but this was when Brick Lane was only in Tsim Sha Tsui. It was across the street from Sushi Kenjo and let’s face it, if I’m up and awake on a Sunday morning on the dark side, I’d choose Kenjo over fish and chips every time.\n\nKeep reading\n\nZafran\n\nI had suggested going to try the new tapas place, Zafran, with a friend of mine for dinner. Earlier on in the day, she excitedly Whatsapped me to say, “I heard the chef is from El Bulli.” Cynically, I replied, “Who isn’t nowadays? Besides, how do we know he wasn’t just there on a stage?” I had also heard that Zafran is Aqua Group’s latest venture. Aqua Group, in my opinion, is a lot better at designing stylish interiors than offering real, substantial cooking. The final prejudice I had about Zafran was that it stays open until 3am every day, which doesn’t strike me as something a serious restaurant would do.\n\nKeep reading\n\nHairy Crabs\n\nI absolutely adore hairy crabs. Shanghainese hairy crabs, sanma (Pacific saury) sushi and white truffles are three reasons why autumn is my favourite season. Normally, I prefer to eat hairy crabs in the privacy of my own home. My sister orders them from her favourite vendor in Causeway Bay, we steam it for 10 minutes at home, and voila. It’s easy, much better value for money than eating them at a restaurant, and just plain more enjoyable because you can eat them in your pajamas.\n\nKeep reading\n\nNagahama No.1 Ramen\n\nUnlike a lot of food writers in Hong Kong, I am not, nor can I pretend to be, a ramen expert. Truth be told, I don’t even like ramen that much. I don’t mind an occasional bowl of miso ramen when I’m freezing in Hokkaido, but in the hot, sweltering summers of Hong Kong, it boggles my mind that people could actually queue for a bowl of heavy, greasy tonkotsu ramen.\n\nKeep reading\n\nThe Teppanroom\n\nI was writing a food trends piece for the December issue of Tatler, and included a paragraph about the proliferation of exclusively teppanyaki restaurants that have opened recently. Sanka, which I wrote about here; IM Teppanyaki in Tai Hang which is popular thanks in part to chef Lawrence Mok; and The Teppanroom, which is the private room of Kaetsu at the Grand Hyatt converted into a standalone teppan-only venue.\n\nKeep reading\n\nAn Nam\n\nAlthough my mum was born in Hoi An in Vietnam and my grandmother used to say how much I looked like a little Vietnamese girl (“she means boat person,” my sister would interject rudely), we are actually ethnically Chinese.\n\nKeep reading"
