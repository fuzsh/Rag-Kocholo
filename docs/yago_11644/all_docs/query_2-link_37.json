        "text": "It took too long for me to learn this painful lesson at my new job. I was the new facilities manager of a commercial facility in Accra. I was super eager to strut my stuff. But that eagerness would soon lead me down a dark, lonely path. Trying to channel my inner Einstein to solve every problem alone, I was making a massive mistake. I soon realized I was subjecting myself to needless and avoidable workplace stress by going solo. Unknown to me, I had help right before me. And I let it lie dormant. I could have saved myself from many headaches by discussing things with a colleague next door. Why didn't that occur to me much sooner? When we started collaborating, things got smoother. No, the challenges didn't disappear. But I often felt a chunk of the weight was off my shoulders by asking for help/attacking the problems together. How many times have you tried to go all alone at work when you could have made things easier by asking for help? Realize that more colleagues at work are more willing to help than you think. Aren't you all pulling in the same direction? Drop the ego and ask for help to solve that problem. Of course, you can only ask for help from colleagues with whom you have a decent working relationship. Or at least you'll be more comfortable doing that. Start building those bridges because you’ll need them sooner or later. Respect them, genuinely care for their welfare. I wish I knew - and embraced - this truth sooner. I would have had so much fun and far fewer headaches fighting fires at work.\n\nHaving finally gotten clarity on the purpose of the questionnaire – to gauge job satisfaction, identify skill gaps, assess stress levels, and evaluate overall well-being – Kinyanjui went ahead to complete it. Relief washed over him as the deadline received another extension (Kenyan style), extended to Friday's close of day. Meanwhile, Wambui, the HR manager, was facing an uphill battle. Explaining the importance of the questionnaire to staff had been a struggle. She tirelessly emphasized the benefits – a tailored evaluation of individual needs and structured support to enhance everyone's well-being and effectiveness. Wambui desperately hoped for 100% participation by the end of the day. After all, it was a critical step in understanding the workforce and building a stronger, more supported team. Suddenly, Leah, the office's gossip queen, burst into Kinyanjui's workspace, interfering with his concentration. Her breathless announcement – the long-pursued major prospect had finally agreed to come on board! Though excited, Kinyanjui, a seasoned professional, kept his emotions in check. Only after holding a formal award letter, he knew, could he allow himself to truly celebrate not premature pronouncements! #workplace #worklife #employeewellbeing #skillsdevelopment #careerdevelopment #staffengagement\n\nHow Does a Strong Community Keep You Safe and Sane? #MKK MKK usually runs every Wednesday morning until afternoon, but since today is a public holiday, Happy Wesak Day to all Malaysians who celebrate it! I would also like to share an important message. Three things I've learned from Marketing Kaw Kaw by Choobub Creatives, led by Dr. Eric Siew: 1. Listen to Understand, Not Just to Reply - Sometimes we have a response ready, but is it necessary? 2. No Judgment - Let’s leave judgment to a higher power who sees all angles. 3. Kindness in Every Situation - Isn’t it rewarding to treat and be treated with kindness? It enriches not just the moment but our entire lives. Isn’t it valuable to have a safe space to fall back on? A community that not only fosters professional growth but also enriches your life emotionally and intellectually? In this community, when you share a story, they listen to understand. Over time, you receive feedback and insights on how things could be improved. Sometimes, they even provide everything needed for you to execute and take action. After observing, listening, and being sensitive to the nuances of each situation, I decided to return to MKK 2. I took a break from work, rejoined, and felt safe sharing my stories—stories that resonate with theirs. This isn’t a paid partnership. I told Dr. Eric, 'I just want one ticket to come back and be part of it again.' Here, I feel safe; no judgment is passed, and both my professional insights and emotional experiences are heard. Have a good Public Holiday Malaysian People! Follow Choobub for more insights and to meet the entire team! Selena K.
