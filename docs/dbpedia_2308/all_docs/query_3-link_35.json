        "text": "Shaivism (சைவ சமயம்) is the oldest of the four major sects of Hinduism, the others being Vaishnavism, Shaktism and Smartism. Followers of Shaivism, called \"Shaivas\", and also \"Saivas\" or \"Saivites\", revere Shiva as the Supreme Being. Shaivas believe that Shiva is All and in all, the creator, preserver, destroyer, revealer and concealer of all that is.\n\nThe word Shaivam refers to \"associated with Shiva\", also known as Shaivism. Shaivam is the religion that worships Lord Shiva. Shaivam a very old religion in the Hindu family of religions and is very rich in its philosophies. With its vivid branches very well integrated into the root, it becomes the oxygen and life of many philosophers. With the matured philosophies standing on the great vedantic and sidhdhantic strong bases it presents to its followers the great paths to the Blissful Supreme called Shiva.In the Shaivam there are many doctrines shaiva sidhdhantham, kashmira shaivam, veera shaivam, vedanta shaivam and many others. The Shaivites worship the Supreme as formless, symbol and through many forms, all leading to the Ultimate Attribute less Supreme.\n\nThe Tamil land that was excelling in the vaidhika path and shaiva tradition in the ancient times underwent a dark period during 4, 5,6th century ACE, with the invasions from the north that put the Buddhism and more specifically Jainism on the royal throne. The art, architecture and lifestyle of the people that kept them as example of civilization diminished because of the self-punishing and colorless religions. The festivals and worship of God full of love that nourished in the minds of people became like fire covered with ash.\n\nAt this time by the Grace of God came the resurgence of the shaivism in the land of God given Tamil happened with the four pillars rising up the glorious light of shaivism. This was a golden period between 7th and 12th centuries. These four traveled through the length and breadth of Tamilnadu kindling the spiritual confidence that the God is not a difficult one and you all can live blissfully and also get supreme liberation, sing and hail, worship our Lord Shiva’s fame - the truth of the four holy Vedas! By their tireless effort they brought back the light in the faces of the masses. For bringing about these changes they had to undergo many fatal threats given by the emperors of the land. They were undaunted and roared, \"We are slaves only for the Supreme!\" The Grace of God acting as the power behind them they won and also brought to their fold the kings who tried to liquidate them. The latter two saints kept up the momentum created by the initial two and made the land a real glorious place. The songs of the four Gurumar are very vitalizing and nurture the minds to be a mature loveful and wise abode of the Supreme Shiva.\n\nThe influence they created through their songs stay even now after a millennium and by the Grace of God should continue to inspire the minds of the generations to come. These beacons of shaivism are the guides the shaiva world looks up to and so they are called Samayak Kuravargal.\n\nSaivam is one of the oldest religions in the world, still which is practiced by many people. Lord Siva is the prime God of Saivam. The oldest base for Saivam we are getting now a day is Vedas, ubanisath and Siva Agamas. During Vedic period Saivam was flourished and many temples were constructed in many places in sub-continent of Asia. The contribution of great saints Agathiyar, Pathanjali and Pulippani are well noticeable. They established many Temples in India that includes Tamil Nadu as well.\n\nCommon people could not understand the concept of Siva. There was a desperate need to take Saivam to all people and elucidate to their level to make them understand. During 7th century Thirugnanasampanthar and Thirunavukkarasar (Appar) were sanctified by Lord Siva and they wrote thousands of Tamil Hymns and that all people can easily understand. We can say they brought religious revolution in South India. Later 9th Century Sundharar also followed the same path and later Manikkavasagar too.\n\nThese people realized the grace and glory of Lord Shiva. They sung Thevaram and Thiruvasagam, which enlighten what they experienced with Lord Siva. In their Hymns they also tell about vicinity of the Temple, easy way to attain God, good practice to follow in day to day life and how to overcome from troubles and immorality. The Collection of Thevaram, Thiruvasagam, Thirumandiram, Thiruvisaipa, Thirupallandu, Periyapuranam and other small collection of Siva hymns are called as Thirumurai. Thirumurai is not just songs of Lord Siva; they are “Tamil Veda”. Each song has its own importance and supremacy.\n\nAt the age of 3, Sampanthar took the sacred milk given by Lord Parvathi along with Lord Siva. By that time he got enlighten (Gnanam) and started singing thevaram starting with “Thodudaiya Seviyan…”\n\nதோடுடையசெவியன்விடையேறியோர்தூவெண்மதிசூடிக்காடுடையசுடலைப்பொடிபூசியென்னுள்ளங்கவர்கள்வன்ஏடுடையமலரான்முனைநாட்பணிந்தேத்தஅருள்செய்தபீடுடையபிரமாபுரமேவியபெம்மானிவனன்றே\n\nBy birth Navukkarasar was Saivist, he was influenced by Jainism and he lived as a Jain for many years. Later he got ulcer (Soolai nooi) kind of illness. He prayed God Siva with the help of his sister Tilagavatiyar. And with Lord Siva’s graces he got cured and got enlighten (Gnanam). He sung Thevaram “Kootra enavaru…” to cure his illness.\n\nOn the day of Sundharar’s marriage, Lord Siva came like an old man to the occasion and argued that Sundharar and his generation are His slaves. Sundharar’s forefathers given authorized note for the same. There was a big debate and hearing, finally God won the argument. He took him to Thiruvennainallur and do make him realize the secret of his birth. He got enlighten and started pricing God starting with “Pitha piraisudi…” in Thevaram.\n\nThiruvathaurar (Manikkavasagar) was a minister of a Pandya King. To develop the army power, once he went to buy more horses from South Tamil Nadu. On the way, one night he stayed in a Temple. He was more impressed by Lord Siva, so he spent entire money that he carried to buy horses to renovate that Temple. He stayed in the same Temple for so many days. There he got enlighten. He sung Thiruvasakam that is famous for its simplicity, richness of words and he shared his experience with God in words. Amazing!! As famous Tamil proverb says, “If you don’t thaw (impressed) for Thiruvasagam, you will never dissolve for any other poem”.\n\n“திருவாசகத்திர்க்கு உருகாதார் ஒரு வாசகத்திர்க்கும உருகார்”\n\nNote:\n\nThe order in which these four great saints are kept is on the account of the order in which they attained the abode of Lord Shiva. It may be recalled that day of attaining the abode of Lord Shiva is considered much glorious than the day of birth. Though Sambandhar was born few decades later than Appar, he attained mukthi earlier than Appar in his young age. So he is first in the order.\n\nThere are four types of Marghams (the way of worshipping God) told in Shaiva Samayam\n\n1. “Sathputra” Margham – Loving & worshipping Shiva as Father (Father – child)\n\n\"சற்புத்திர மார்க்கம்” என்பது சிவனைத் தந்தையாக நேசிப்பது.\n\nThirugnanasambhandar comes under this margham\n\n2. “Dhasa” Margham – Worshipping and loving Shiva as his Slave (Master – Slave)\n\n\"தாசமார்க்கம்\" என்பது சிவனுடைய அடிமையாக இருந்து வழிபடுவது\n\nThirunavukkarasar comes under this margham\n\n3. “Sagha” Margham – Worshipping and loving Shiva as Friend (Friend – Friend)\n\n\"சகமார்க்கம்\" என்பது சிவனைத் தோழனாக நேசிப்பது.\n\nSundarar comes under this margham\n\n4. “Nayaga Nayagi” Margham – Worshipping and loving Shiva as lover (Mister – Mistress)\n\n\"நாயகநாயகி மார்க்கம்\" என்பது சிவனையே காதலனாக நேசிப்பது.\n\nManivasagar comes under this margham"
