        "text": "(PDF contains a preview of the book from Routledge's website, including the TOC and Introduction.) This book explores the key motif of the religious other in devotional (bhakti) literatures and practices from across the Indian subcontinent unmasks processes of representation that involve adoption, appropriation, and rejection of different social and religious agents. The contributing authors reconsider and challenge inherited notions of the bhakta’s or devotee’s other. Considering the ways in which bhakti might be conceived as having an inter-regional impact—as a force, discourse, network, mythology, ethic—the book critically engages with extant scholarly narratives about what bhakti is and traces when and how those narratives have been used. The sheer diversity of South Asia’s devotional traditions renders them an especially rich resource for examining social and religious fault lines, thereby furthering scholarly understanding of how communalism and sectarianism originate and develop on local or regional levels, with wider geographic implications. Bringing together studies from a subcontinent-wide variety of linguistic, geographical, and historical frames for the first time, this book will be an important contribution to the literature on bhakti and will be of interest to scholars of South Asian Religions and Asian Religions.\n\nThe aim of this brief communication is to present a summary of the hymns of Kāraikkālammaiyār (c. 500 CE; Zvelebil 1974: 91), familiarly known as Ammaiyār (the Mother) in Tamil Śaiva lore and try to find some correspondence between the ideas aired in her poems and the later medieval phase of Śaiva iconography. For this purpose we have selected a temple car (Tamil tēr, Sanskrit ratha) from Tirupparāyttuṟai (base of Śrī Rāmakrishṇa Maṭha; on the way from Tiruccirāppaḷḷi to Karūr) an important center of Śaivism from the most ancient period onward extolled in the hymns of the Tamil mystics (e.g. the Tēvāram) who propagated the bhakti cult during the 7th-8th century. The tēr on the site is a later medieval work datable to the 16th century CE; maybe a contribution of the Nāyakas of Maturai (Aiyer 1924, Rajarajan 2006) who had their metropolis at Tiruccirāppaḷḷi for some time. The Nāyakas of Maturai gave a fresh impetus to the revival of the bhakti traditions adumbrated by the Āḻvārs and the Nayaṉmār (Parthiban 2016: 1-23). When a team of our scholars, including R.K. Parthiban and Raju Kalidos visited and photographed the tēr some five years ago Raju Kalidos (cf. 1988, 1989) wanted me to examine the wooden sculptures in the context of the hymns of Ammaiyār. The present communication is the outcome of such an endeavour. I have followed the a simple method to coherently present a summary of the hymns of the ‘Ammaiyār’ and try to find out some concordance between the thoughts expressed a millennium ago and a temple car fashioned centuries later. What I mean to say is “śāstras are invincible” and “traditions are inviolable” in India as is the unwritten British Constitution, an idea that I put forward in a recent National Conference organized under the auspicious of His Holiness Śrī Śaṅkarācārya Maṭha at Kāñcīpuram (Rajarajan 2016)."
