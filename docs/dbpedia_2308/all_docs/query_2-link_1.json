        "text": "Group of Hindu saints devoted to Shiva\n\nThe Nayanars (or Nayanmars; Tamil: நாயன்மார், romanized: Nāyaṉmār, lit. 'hounds of Siva', and later 'teachers of Shiva )[1] were a group of 63 Tamil Hindu saints living during the 6th to 8th centuries CE who were devoted to the Hindu god Shiva. Along with the Alvars, their contemporaries who were devoted to Vishnu, they influenced the Bhakti movement in early medieval South India.[2] The names of the Nayanars were first compiled by Sundarar. The list was expanded by Nambiyandar Nambi during his compilation of material by the poets for the Tirumurai collection, and would include Sundarar himself and Sundarar's parents.[citation needed]\n\nThe Nalvar (lit. 'The Four') are the three foremost Nayanars Appar, Sundarar, Sambandar along with Manikkavacakar.[3]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe list of the Nayanars was initially compiled by Sundarar (Sundararmurthi). In his poem Tiruthonda Thogai he sings, in eleven verses, the names of the Nayanar saints up to Karaikkal Ammaiyar, and refers to himself as \"the servant of servants\".[2][4][5] The list did not go into the detail of the lives of the saints, which were described in detail in works such as Tevaram.[6]\n\nIn the 10th century, king Raja Raja Chola I collected the volumes of Tevaram after hearing excerpts of the hymns in his court.[7]: 50 His priest Nambiyandar Nambi began compiling the hymns into a series of volumes called the Tirumurai. He arranged the hymns of three saint poets Sambandar, Appar and Sundarar as the first seven books which he called the Tevaram. He compiled Manikkavasakar's Tirukovayar and Tiruvasakam as the eighth book, the 28 hymns of nine other saints as the ninth book, the Tirumandiram of Tirumular and 40 hymns by 12 other poets as the tenth book. In the eleventh book, he created the Tirutontanar Tiruvanthathi (also known as Tirutoṇṭar Antādi, lit. Necklace of Verses on the Lord's Servants), which consisted of 89 verses, with a verse devoted to each of the saints. With the addition of Sundarar and his parents to the sequence, this became the canonical list of the 63 saints.[6] In the 12th century, Sekkizhar added a twelfth volume to the Tirumurai called Periya Puranam in which he expands further on the stories of each of 63 Nayanars.[1][2][4]\n\nThe Nayanars were from various backgrounds, including Nadar, Vanniyar, Vellalas, Idayars, Kurumbars, Thevars, oilmongers, Brahmins, Vannar, and Dalits.[1] Along with the twelve Vaishnava Alvars, they are regarded as the important Hindu saints from South India.\n\nMany Kannada works, such has Nambiyannana Ragale and Tiru Nilakanta Devara Ragale, are written on Nayanars by Kannada poet Harihara. Sundara Murthy nayanar is known as Nambiyanna in Kannada literature.[citation needed]\n\nList of Nayanars\n\n[edit]\n\nSundarar's original list of Nayanars did not follow any sequence with regards to chronology or importance. However, some groups have since followed an order for arranging their Nayanar temple images according to Sundarar's poem as well as the information from Nambi and Sekkizhar.[4][8]\n\nList of 63 Nayanars No.[8] Person Notes 1 Sundarar Born in Aadi month, Swathi nakshathiram 2 Tiru Neelakanta 3 Iyarpagaiar His name \"Iyarpagai\" means \"Contrary to Nature\" 4 Ilayankudi Maranar 5 Meiporul 6 Viralminda 7 Amaraneedi 8 Eripatha 9 Yenathinathar A Brave swordsman/general in Chola Military 10 Kannappa Believed to be a reincarnation of Arjuna 11 Kungiliya Kalaya 12 Manakanchara 13 Arivattaya 14 Anaya 15 Murthiyar 16 Muruga 17 Rudra Pasupathi 18 Nandanar (Thirunalai Povar) 19 Tiru Kurippu Thonda 20 Chandeshvara 21 Appar (Tirunavukkarasar) His efforts convinced the Pallava king, Mahendra- Varman I to take up Shaivism. 22 Kulachirai He became the Prime Minister of the Pandyan King Koon Pandiyan. 23 Perumizhalai Kurumba 24 Karaikkal Ammeiyar Nagarathar Woman saint who lived in the 6th century[9] 25 Apputhi Adigal 26 Tiruneelanakka 27 Nami Nandi Adigal 28 Sambandar A child prodigy Saiva Saint who lived only 16 years 29 Eyarkon Kalikama 30 Tirumular 31 Dandi Adigal 32 Murkha 33 Somasi Mara 34 Sakkiya 35 Sirappuli 36 Siruthondar Army general of the Pallava king Narasimavarman I 37 Cheraman Perumal Tentatively identified with Chera ruler Rama Rajasekhara[10]\n\nBorn in Aadhi month, Swathi nakshathiram\n\n38 Gananatha 39 Kootruva 40 Pugal Chola Chola King 41 Narasinga Muniyaraiyar 42 Adipaththar 43 Kalikamba 44 Kalia Born in Aadhi month, Kettai nakshathiram 45 Satti 46 Aiyadigal Kadavarkon 47 Kanampulla 48 Kari 49 Ninra Seer Nedumaara Pandya King 50 Mangayarkkarasiyar Queen and consort of Nindra Seer Nedumaran 51 Vayilar 52 Munaiyaduvar 53 Kazharsinga Tentatively identified with Pallava king Narasimhavarman II (Rajasimha) 54 Idangazhi 55 Seruthunai 56 Pugazh Thunai 57 Kotpuli 58 Pusalar 59 Nesa Nayanar Saliyar, weaver who donates clothes to Lord Shiva's devotees 60 Sengenar (Kochengat Chola) 61 Tiru Nilakanta Yazhpanar 62 Sadaiya Sundarar's father 63 Isaignaniyaar Sundarar's mother\n\nOther saints\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 9th-century poet Manikkavacakar was not counted as one of the 63 Nayanars but his works were part of the eighth volume of the Tirumurai.\n\nIn Tiruchuli, the Tamil poet-philosopher Valluvar is worshipped as the 64th Nayanar.[11] Valluvar was also added as the 64 saint in the annual Mylapore procession of the 63 Nayanars since c. 1905.[12][13]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nManikkavacakar\n\nTamil mythology\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]\n\nCort, John E.
