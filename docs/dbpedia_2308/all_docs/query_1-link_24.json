This document provides profiles of several important Hindu religious orders in Tamil Nadu. It discusses their origins and histories.

It has made many contributions to Tamil literature. The Dharmapuram Adheenam was founded in the 16th century to spread Saiva Siddhanta philosophy and has emphasized the importance of Tamil.
