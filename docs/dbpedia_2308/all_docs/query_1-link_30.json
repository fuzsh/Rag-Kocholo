Journal of the Indo Nordic Author’s Collective 1 The Big Temple Brihadisvara Temple built by Rajaraja I, a UNESCO World Heritage Site- Mysteries Solved Dr Uday Dokras- Ph D SWEDEN Rajaraja I, born Arulmoli Varman often described as Rajaraja the Great, was a Chola emperor (reigned c. 985–1014) chiefly remembered for reinstating the Chola power and ensuring its supremacy in south India and Indian Ocean. His extensive empire included the Pandya country (southern Tamil Nadu), the Chera country (Malabar Coast and western Tamil Nadu) and northern Sri Lanka. He also acquired the Lakshadweep and Maldive Islands in the Indian Ocean. Campaigns against the Western Gangas (southern Karnataka) and Chalukyas extended the Chola influence as far as the Tungabhadra River. On the eastern coast he battled with the Chalukyas for the possession of Vengi (the Godavari districts). Rajaraja, an able administrator, also built the great Brihadisvara Temple at the Chola capital Thanjavur. The temple is regarded as the foremost of all temples in the medieval south Indian architectural style. During his reign, the texts of the Tamil poets Appar, Sambandar and Sundarar were collected and edited into one compilation called Thirumurai. He initiated a massive project of land survey and assessment in 1000 CE which led to the reorganisation of the country into individual units known as valanadus. Rajaraja died in 1014 CE and was succeeded by his son Rajendra Chola I. Rajaraja indulged in a lot of queens some of whom were Dantisakti Vitanki aka Lokamadevi, Vanavan Madevi aka Thiripuvāna Mādēviyār, Panchavan Madeviyar, Chola Mahadevi, Trailokya Mahadevi, Lata Mahadevi, Prithvi Mahadevi, Meenavan Mahadevi, Viranarayani and Villavan Mahadevi. He had at least three daughters. He had a son Rajendra with Thiripuvāna Mādēviyār. He had his first daughter Kundavai with Ulaga Madeviyar. Kundavai married Chalukya prince Vimaladithan. He had two other daughters named Mathevadigal and Ģangamādevi or Arumozhi Chandramalli. Rajaraja died in 1014 CE in the Tamil month of Maka and was succeeded by Rajendra Chola I. Administration:\n\n2. Journal of the Indo Nordic Author’s Collective 2 Brihadisvara Temple built by Rajaraja I, a UNESCO World Heritage Site Mural depicting Rajaraja and his guru Karuvuruvar found in the Brihadisvara temple, Tamil Nadu, 11th century. Before the reign of Rajaraja I, parts of the Chola territory were ruled by hereditary lords and princes who were in a loose alliance with the Chola rulers. Rajaraja initiated a project of land survey and assessment in 1000 CE which led to the reorganization of the empire into units known as valanadus. From the reign of Rajaraja I until the reign of Vikrama Chola in 1133 CE, the hereditary lords and local princes were either replaced or turned into dependent officials. This led to the king exercising a closer control over the different parts of the empire. Rajaraja strengthened the local self-government and installed a system of audit and control by which the village assemblies and other public bodies were held to account while retaining their autonomy. To promote trade, he sent the first Chola mission to China. His elder sister Kundavai assisted him in administration and management of temples. Rajendra Chola I was made a co-regent during the last years of Rajaraja's rule. He was the supreme commander of the northern and north-western dominions. During the reign of Raja Chola, there was an expansion of the administrative structure leading to the increase in the number of offices and officials in the Chola records than during earlier periods. Villavan Muvendavelan, one of the top officials of Rajaraja figures in many of his inscriptions. The other names of officials found in the inscriptions are the Bana prince Narasimhavarman, a general Senapathi Krishnan Raman, the Samanta chief Vallavaraiyan Vandiyadevan, the revenue official Irayiravan Pallavarayan and Kuruvan Ulagalandan, who organised the country-wide land surveys. Rajaraja was a follower of Shaivism but he was tolerant towards other faiths and had several temples for Vishnu constructed and encouraged the construction of the Buddhist Chudamani Vihara at the request of the Srivijaya king Sri Maravijayatungavarman. Rajaraja dedicated the proceeds of the revenue from the village of Anaimangalam towards the upkeep of this Vihara Architecture:\n\n3. Journal of the Indo Nordic Author’s Collective 3 Rajaraja embarked on a mission to recover the hymns after hearing short excerpts of Thevaram in his court. He sought the help of Nambi Andar Nambi. It is believed that by divine intervention Nambi found the presence of scripts, in the form of cadijam leaves half eaten by white ants in a chamber inside the second precinct in Thillai Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram.The brahmanas (Dikshitars) in the temple opposed the mission, but Rajaraja intervened by consecrating the images of the saint-poets through the streets of Chidambaram. Rajaraja thus became known as Tirumurai Kanda Cholan meaning one who saved the Tirumurai. In his work Nambiyandar Nambi Puranam alias Tirumurai Kanda Puranam, Nambi identifies his patron as Rasarasamannan-Abhayakula-sekharan, that is king Rajaraja, the best of the race of Abhaya. Thus far Shiva temples only had images of god forms, but after the advent of Rajaraja, the images of the Nayanar saints were also placed inside the temple.[76] Nambi arranged the hymns of three saint poets Sambandar, Appar and Sundarar as the first seven books, Manickavasagar's Tirukovayar and Tiruvacakam as the 8th book, the 28 hymns of nine other saints as the 9th book, the Tirumandiram of Tirumular as the 10th book, 40 hymns by 12 other poets as the 10th book, Tirutotanar Tiruvanthathi - the sacred anthathi of the labours of the 63 nayanar saints and added his own hymns as the 11th book. The first seven books were later called as Tevaram, and the whole Saiva canon, to which was added, as the 12th book, Sekkizhar's Periya Puranam (1135) is wholly known as Tirumurai, the holy book. Thus Saiva literature which covers about 600 years of religious, philosophical and literary development. Brihadisvara Temple In 1010 CE, Rajaraja built the Brihadisvara Temple in Thanjavur dedicated to Lord Shiva. The temple and the capital acted as a center of both religious and economic activity. It is also known as Periya Kovil, RajaRajeswara Temple and Rajarajeswaram. It is one of the largest temples in India and is an example of Dravidian architecture during the Chola period.[82] The temple turned 1000 years old in 2010. The temple is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site known as the \"Great Living Chola Temples\", with the other two being the Gangaikonda Cholapuram and Airavatesvara temple. The temple is one of the most visited tourist attractions in Tamil Nadu. Before the reign of Rajaraja the Chola coins had on the obverse the tiger emblem and the fish and bow emblems of the Pandya and Chera Dynasties and on the reverse the name of the King. But during the reign of Rajaraja appeared a new type of coins. The new coins had on the obverse the figure of the standing king and on the reverse the seated goddess. The coins spread over a great part of South India and were also copied by the kings of Sri Lanka. A typical lithic inscription of the Chola period\n\n4. Journal of the Indo Nordic Author’s Collective 4 Due to Rajaraja's desire to record his military achievements, he recorded the important events of his life in stones. An inscription in Tamil from Mulbagal in Karnataka shows his accomplishments as early as the 19th year. An excerpt from such a Meikeerthi, an inscription recording great accomplishments, follows: Hail! Prosperity! In the 21st year of (the reign of) the illustrious Ko-Raja-Rajakesarivarman, alias the illustrious Rajaraja-deva, who, -while both the goddess of fortune and the great goddess of the earth, who had become his exclusive property, gave him pleasure,-was pleased to destroy the ships at Kandalur and conquered by his army, which was victorious in great battles, Vengai-nadu, Ganga-padi, Nulamba-padi, Tadigai-padi, Kudamalai-nadu, Kollam, Kalingam and Ira-mandalam, which is famed in the eight directions; who,-while his beauty was increasing, and while he was resplendent (to such an extent) that he was always worthy to be worshipped,- deprived the Seriyas of their splendour,-and (in words) in the twenty-first year of Soran Arumori, who possesses the river Ponni, whose waters are full of waves..[90][91] ஸ் வஸ் திஸ்ர் திருமகள் ப ோல ப ருநில/ப ருநிலச் பசல்வியுந் தனக்பகயுரிமம/பகயுரிமம பூண் டமம மனக்பகோளக்/கோந்தளூர்ச் சோமலக் களமறூத்தருளி பவங்மக/உமடயோர் ஸ்ரரோஜரோஜ Excerpts of Rajaraja's inscription from Brihadisvara Temple in Thanjavur (first line in every image) Rajaraja recorded all the grants made to the Thanjavur temple and his achievements. He also preserved the records of his predecessors. An inscription of his reign found at Tirumalavadi records an order of the king to the effect that the central shrine of the Vaidyanatha temple at the place should be rebuilt and that, before pulling down the walls, the inscriptions engraved on them should be copied in a book. The records were subsequently re-engraved on the walls from the book after the rebuilding was finished. Another inscription from Gramardhanathesvara temple in South Arcot district dated in the seventh year of the king refers to the fifteenth year of his predecessor that is Uttama Choladeva described therein as the son of Sembiyan-Madeviyar. The Chola emperor was overawed by several stone edifices of the Pallavas, including the Mamallapuram Dharmaraja Ratham Under Raja Raja Chola (947-1014), the Chola empire expanded in all directions and the king (regnal 985-1014) was eulogised as the Lion among kings. But it is the Brihadiswara Temple, also known as the Big Temple, which stands as a reminder of this great ruler, 1,000 years after he consecrated it. What makes the Big Temple special and more important, what inspired Arunmozhi Varman, who became Raja Raja or the King of kings, to raise a temple, which has become a symbol of Tamil architecture?\n\n5. Journal of the Indo Nordic Author’s Collective 5 Sthapati K. Dakshinamoorthy has delved into the background and come up with facts, which establish the Pallava influence, unmistakable in the structure of the Big Temple. The grandeur of the stone edifices that the Pallava kings erected, in Mamallapuram and other places across the country and beyond had an impact on Raja Raja, who modified and refined the techniques. Dakshinamoorthy sthapati specifies Dharmaraja Ratham — one of the five famous chariots at Mamallapuram — as the precursor to the Brihadiswara temple, in fact for all the stone temples, down South. Brick and mortar gave way to stone at this point, he says. The sthapati traces major monuments, which must have triggered the imagination of Raja Raja, quite a few of which belong to the Pallava period. At the one end of the spectrum are the cave temples, which were introduced south of the Vindyas by Mahendra Pallava (A.D. 600-630). In his Mandagapattu inscription, the king records that he has raised temples for Brahma, Vishnu and Siva without using brick, wood, metal and mortar. Narasimhavarma Pallava (630-668) introduced monolithic rock-cut temples. Dharmaraja Ratham, however, is an incomplete structure, the Big Temple rising as an example of its refined version, filling those gaps, which the Pallava ruler chose to leave. Kailashnatha Temple Big temple | Two categories It is necessary here to briefly touch upon the two broad categories — Analpitam and Arpitam — into which temple architecture falls. Analpitam is gharbagriha (sanctum sanctorum) with two walls, which have a gap in between, called alindam. In Arpitam, the wall is not detached.\n\n6. Journal of the Indo Nordic Author’s Collective 6 The earliest example of analpita type of temple is Dharmaraja Ratham, which has flights of steps in cardinal directions (E-W-N-S) and the gap for pradikshina. The Kanchipuram Vaikunta Perumal temple, built by Nandivarma Pallava II (730-795), is an evolution of Dharmaraja Ratham, says Dakshinamoorthy. It has four entrances, deities in cardinal directions and a circumambulatory passage as well. The Kanchi Kailasanatha temple, built by Rajasimha Pallava again is a take-off from Dharmaraja Ratham. Two centuries later, the Thanjavur temple was built in the Analpita- Alpita style with four dwaras and four deities in cardinal directions and alinda pradikshina. “The Tiruvadigai Veerattanam temple, built by Parameswara Pallava, served as another main reference point for Raja Raja,” says the sthapati and explains. The main shrine of Brihadiswara is built in the Analpita style — from ground floor and for Tier 1. The Pallava architecture was improved by Raja Raja in several ways. The most significant, according to Dakshinamoorthy, is what is called Karnakuda — the dome at the edge of the gopuram. In the Kanchi Kailasanathar and Tiruvadigai cases, the first tier domes are big, the size getting significantly reduced in the next, a feature found in Thanjavur too. Generally, the size is gradually reduced as the tower tapers off to the peak. “By adopting the Alpitam-Analpitam combination and through the Karnakuda size, Raja Raja achieved the height and the magnificent design,” says Dakshinamoorthy. This was replicated by Raja Raja’s son and successor Rajendra Chola at Gangaikonda Chozhapuram, another iconic structure.\n\n7. Journal of the Indo Nordic Author’s Collective 7 Prambanan temple, Indonesia | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement There are inscriptions to suggest that Raja Raja visited Kanchi Kailasanatha temple several times. Four of them, dating to his 12th and 15th regnal years, are available. An overawed Raja Raja calls the structure Kanchipurathu Periya Tirukkatrali (the big stone temples of Kanchipuram). Rajasimha’s accomplishments must have come as a great source of inspiration to the Chola king, asserts Dakshinamoorthy. The hundreds of titles that the Pallava ruler boasted, his devotion to Saiva philosophy and agama sastra must have impressed the king too. The Mamallapuram seashore temple has Rajaraja’s inscriptions dating to his 25th and 26th regnal years. Sun among temples As many as 24 inscriptions are available in Uthiramerur, 17 of which are in the Sundaravarada Perumal temple, belonging to the period of Dandivarma Pallava. Raja Raja must have seen the inscription, which said that the one who designs a temple like this (Sundaravarada) would be an expert in Vastu. This is referred to as the Sun among all temples. “The architectural significance of the Uthiramerur Vaikuntanatha Perumal temple, is often eclipsed by the historical evidence that its inscriptions bear regarding state administration,” points out Dakshinamurthi, who is sure that Rajaraja visited this temple before and after the work on the Big Temple was completed.\n\n8. Journal of the Indo Nordic Author’s Collective 8 There is evidence of the Chola ruler’s visit to Tirukoshtiyur, where the famous Sowmyanarayana temple, is located. The Pandya temple from atop which Sri Ramanuja pronounced the Ashtakshara mantra and the one existing now are not, however, the same, informs the sthapati. So impressed was the Pandya king that he inscribed his appreciation on stone in a Vishnu temple close-by! Raja Raja’s territory extended on all sides up to Kalinga, Ezham (Sri Lanka) and Lakshadweep. His military exploits and trade — sea included — took him across the length and breadth of this country and beyond. Dakshinamoorthy is sure that Raja Raja came across several temples, either finished or in the making, many of them majestically rising to the sky. These included the Khajuraho Kandariya Mahadev temple, the Lingaraja temple of Bubhaneswar, the Ellora Kailash rock-cut monolithic temple, the Prambanan Trimurti temple and Borobudur Buddhist temples in Indonesia, Koh Ker temple that Jayavarman IV built in Cambodia and the Pre Rup temple (Rajendra Varman), and Phimeanakas of Rajendra Varman and Surya varman (both at Angkor, Cambodia). This must have set the king thinking and he desired to build a temple, equally fabulous and thus was born the Brihadiswara temple, called Dakshina Meru Vidangar — a temple as massive as the Meru, dedicated by Raja Raja, known as Sivapadasekara, to his favourite deity, Siva.1 The Great Living Chola Temples is a UNESCO World Heritage Site designation for a group of Chola dynasty era Hindu temples in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Completed between early 11th and the 12th century CE, the monuments include the Brihadisvara Temple at Thanjavur, the Temple of Gangaikonda Cholapuram and the Airavatesvara Temple at Darasuram. The Brihadisvara Temple was recognised in 1987; the Temple of Gangaikondacholapuram and the Airavatesvara Temple were added as extensions to the site in 2004. ----------------------------------------------------------- 1.https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/the-brihadiswara-temple-also- known-as-the-big-temple-stands-as-a-reminder-of-raja-raja-chola/article18154244.ece\n\n9.

The site has a nearby airport (IATA: TJV) which does not have a regular air service. The nearest airport with regular services is Tiruchirappalli International Airport (IATA: TRZ), about 55 kilometres (34 mi) away. Airavatesvara Temple A pillar in Dravidian architectural-style in Airavatesvara Temple\n\n10. Journal of the Indo Nordic Author’s Collective 10 The Airavatesvara Temple is in the town of Darasuram, near Kumbakonam completed in 1166 CE. It is one among a cluster of eighteen medieval era large Hindu temples in the Kumbakonam area. The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva. It also reverentially displays Vaishnavism and Shaktism traditions of Hinduism, along with the legends associated with sixty three Nayanars – the Bhakti movement saints of Shaivism. Named after the White Elephant of Indra, this temple is an exquisite testimony to the grand temple architecture of the Cholan Empire. It is the last of the three great Cholan temples built by successive generations of kings starting from Rajaraja I. Airavateswara temple was built by Rajaraja II around 1150 AD. One of the striking features of this temple is Rajagambhira Thirumandapam - Royal Courtyard, with intricately carved pillars, long steps made of granite stones and elegant chariots drawn by horse - again hewn out of stone. You will see finer workmanship in this temple than the earlier temples. Darasuram is literally a stone's throw away from Kumbakonam. The stone temple incorporates a chariot structure, and includes major Vedic and Puranic deities such as Indra, Agni, Varuna, Vayu, Brahma, Surya, Vishnu, Saptamtrikas, Durga, Saraswati, Sri Devi (Lakshmi), Ganga, Yamuna, Subrahmanya, Ganesha, Kama, Rati and others.[11] The temple was much larger and once had seven courtyards according to inscriptions. Only one courtyard survives, parts of the temple such as the gopuram is in ruins, and the main temple and associated shrines stand alone. The temple continues to attract large gatherings of Hindu pilgrims. Brihadeeswarar Temple View of the Śrī Vimāna of the Brihadeeswarar Temple The Brihadisvara Temple at Thanjavur is a Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva.[15][16] It is one of the largest South Indian temples and an exemplary example of fully realized Tamil architecture.[17] Built by Raja Raja Chola I between 1003 and 1010 AD. The original monuments of this 11th century temple were built around a moat. It included gopura, the main temple, its massive tower, inscriptions, frescoes and sculptures predominantly related to Shaivism, but also\n\n11. Journal of the Indo Nordic Author’s Collective 11 of Vaishnvaism and Shaktism traditions of Hinduism. The temple was damaged in its history and some artwork is now missing. Additional mandapam and monuments were added in centuries that followed. The temple now stands amidst fortified walls that were added after the 16th century. Built out of granite, the vimanam tower above the sanctum is one of the tallest in South India.[16] The temple has a massive colonnaded prakara (corridor) and one of the largest Shiva linga in India.[16][20] It is also famed for the quality of its sculpture, as well as being the location that commissioned the brass Nataraja – Shiva as the lord of dance, in 11th century. The complex includes shrines for Nandi, Amman, Subrahmanyar, Ganesha, Sabhapati, Dakshinamurti, Chandesrvarar, Varahi and others.[21] The temple is one of the most visited tourist attractions in Tamil Nadu. Brihadeeswarar Temple, Gangaikonda Cholapuram The Gangaikondacholapuram Brihadisvara Temple is a Hindu temple located at Gangaikondacholapuram about 70 kilometres (43 mi) from Thanjavur Brihadisvara Temple. Completed in 1035 AD by Rajendra Chola I as a part of his new capital, this Chola dynasty era temple is similar in design and has a similar name as the 11th century, and sometimes just called the Gangaikondacholapuram temple It is dedicated to Shiva and based on a square plan, but the temple reverentially displays Vaishnavism, Shaktism and syncretic equivalence themes of Hinduism with statues of Vishnu, Durga, Surya, Harihara, Ardhanishvara, and others. In addition to the main shrine with linga, the temple complex has a number of smaller shrines, gopura, and other monuments, with some partially ruined or restored in later centuries. The temple is famed for its bronze sculptures, artwork on its walls, the Nandi and the scale of its curvilinear tower. • Criterion (i): The three Chola temples of Southern India represent an outstanding creative achievement in the architectural conception of the pure form of the Dravidan type of temple. • Criterion (ii): The Brihadisvara Temple at Thanjavur became the first great example of the Chola temples, followed by a development of which the other two properties also bear witness. • Criterion (iii): The three Great Chola Temples are an exceptional and the most outstanding testimony to the development of the architecture of the Chola Empire and the Tamil civilization in Southern India. • Criterion (iv): The Great Chola temples at Thanjavur, at Gangaikondacholapuram and Darasuram are outstanding examples of the architecture and the representation of the Chola ideology. Brihadishvara Temple, also called Rajarajesvaram or Peruvudaiyār Kōvil, is a Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva located in South bank of Kaveri river in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu, India.[1][3] It is one of the largest South Indian temples and an exemplary example of a fully realized Dravidian architecture. It is called as Dhakshina Meru (Meru of south).[5] Built by Tamil king Raja Raja Chola I between 1003 and 1010 AD, the temple is a part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site known as the \"Great Living Chola Temples\", along with the Chola dynasty era Gangaikonda Cholapuram temple and Airavatesvara temple that are about 70 kilometres (43 mi) and 40 kilometres (25 mi) to its northeast respectively.\n\n12. Journal of the Indo Nordic Author’s Collective 12 The original monuments of this 11th century temple were built around a moat.

The temple was damaged in its history and some artwork is now missing. Additional mandapam and monuments were added in centuries that followed. The temple now stands amidst fortified walls that were added after the 16th century. Built out of granite, the vimana tower above the sanctum is one of the tallest in South India.[3] It was, in all likelihood, one of the tallest structures in the world at the time of its construction The temple has a massive colonnaded prakara (corridor) and one of the largest Shiva lingas in India. It is also famed for the quality of its sculpture, as well as being the location that commissioned the brass Nataraja – Shiva as the lord of dance, in 11th century. The complex includes shrines for Nandi, Parvati, Kartikeya, Ganesha, Sabhapati, Dakshinamurti, Chandeshvara, Varahi and others. The temple is one of the most visited tourist attractions in Tamil Nadu. Nomenclature: Rajaraja, who commissioned the temple, called it Rajarajeshvaram (Rajarājeśvaram), literally \"the temple of the god of Rajaraja\". A later inscription in the Brihannayaki shrine calls the temple's deity Periya Udaiya Nayanar, which appears to be the source of the modern names Brihadisvara and Peruvudaiyar Kovil. Brihadishvara (IAST: Bṛihádīśvara) is a Sanskrit composite word composed of Brihat which means \"big, great, lofty, vast\",[ and Ishvara means \"lord, Shiva, supreme being, supreme atman (soul)\". The name means the \"great lord, big Shiva\" temple. The Brihadeswara Temple is located in the city of Thanjavur, about 350 kilometres (220 mi) southwest of Chennai. The city and the temple though inland, are at the start of the Cauveri River delta, thus with access to the Bay of Bengal and through it to the Indian Ocean. Along with the temples, the Tamil people completed the first major irrigation network in the 11th century for agriculture, for movement of goods and to control the water flow through the urban center. The Kaveri is sacred river to the people of South India and is worshipped as the Goddess Kaveriamma. The Kaveri is also one of the seven holy rivers of India. Kaveri (also known as Cauvery, the anglicized name) is an Indian river flowing through the states of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The Kaveri river rises at Talakaveri in the Brahmagiri range in the Western Ghats, Kodagu district of the state of Karnataka, at an elevation of 1,341 m above mean sea level and flows for about 800 km before its outfall into the Bay of Bengal. It is the third largest river – after Godavari and Krishna – in South India and the largest in the State of Tamil Nadu, which, on its course, bisects the state into North and South.\n\n13. Journal of the Indo Nordic Author’s Collective 13 Statue of Rajaraja Chola I who built the temple over 1003-1010 CE. A spectrum of Hindu temple styles continued to develop from the 5th to the 9th century over the Chalukya era rule as evidenced in Aihole, Badami and Pattadakal, and then with the Pallava era as witnessed at Mamallapuram and other monuments. Thereafter, between 850 and 1280 CE, Cholas emerged as the dominant dynasty. The early Chola period saw a greater emphasis on securing their geopolitical boundaries and less emphasis on architecture. In the 10th century, within the Chola empire emerged features such as the multifaceted columns with projecting square capitals. This, states George Michell, signaled the start of the new Chola style. This South Indian style is most fully realized both in scale and detail in the Brihadeshvara temple built between 1003 and 1010 by the Chola king Rajaraja I. Additions, renovations and repairs The main temple along with its gopurams are from the early 11th century. The temple also saw additions, renovations, and repairs over the next 1,000 years. The raids and wars, particularly between Muslim Sultans who controlled Madurai and Hindu kings who controlled Thanjavur caused damage. These were repaired by Hindu dynasties that regained control. In some cases, the rulers attempted to renovate the temple with faded paintings, by ordering new murals on top of the older ones. In other cases, they sponsored addition of shrines. The significant shrines of Kartikeya (Murugan), Parvati (Amman) and Nandi are from the 16th and 17th-century Nayaka era the Dakshinamurti shrine was built later.\n\n14. Journal of the Indo Nordic Author’s Collective 14 Architecture Brihadisvara temple, seen in profile. The temple \"testifies the brilliant achievements of the Chola in architecture, sculpture, painting and bronze casting.\" The temple finds mention in many of the contemporary works of the period like Muvar Ula and Kalingathuparani. According to Chatterjee, the Dravidian architecture attained its supreme form of expression in the temple and it successor, the Brihadeeswarar Temple, Gangaikonda Cholapuram.[59] The temple has been declared as a heritage monument by the Government of India and administered by the Archaeological Survey of India as a protected monument. The temple is one of the most visited tourist attractions in Tamil Nadu. • It was built for Shiva by Rajendra I (1014-1044 CE). • The temple has sculptures of exceptional quality. • The bronze sculptures of Bhogasakti and Subrahmanya are masterpieces of Chola metal icons. Airavatesvara Temple (Darasuram) • It was built by the Chola king Rajaraja II (1144-1173 CE): • It is much smaller in size as compared to the Brihadisvara temple at Thanjavur and Gangaikondacholapuram. • The temple consists of a sanctum without a circumambulatory path and axial mandapas. • The front mandapa is unique as it was conceptualized as a chariot with wheels. The temple was declared as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, along with the Brihadeeswara Temple at Gangaikondacholapuram and Airavatesvara temple at Darasuram that are referred as\n\n15. Journal of the Indo Nordic Author’s Collective 15 the Great Living Chola Temples.[6] These three temples have similarities, but each has unique design and sculptural elements.[60] All of the three temples were built by the Cholas between the 10th and 12th centuries CE and they have continued to be supported and used by Hindus. The temples are classified as \"Great Living\" as the temples are active in cultural, pilgrimage and worship practises in modern times. The temple, which is one of the tallest temples in India, still remains an engineering mystery as it is completely made of granite and archaeologists still don’t know how the builders got such huge pieces of granite for construction at this height. Brihadeshvara temple plan and development utilizes axial and symmetrical geometry rules. It is classified as Perunkoil (also called Madakkoil), a big temple built on a higher platform of a natural or man-made mounds. The temple complex is a rectangle that is almost two stacked squares, covering 240.79 metres (790.0 ft) east to west, and 121.92 metres (400.0 ft) north to south. In this space are five main sections: the sanctum with the towering superstructure (sri vimana), the Nandi hall in front (Nandi-mandapam) and in between these the main community hall (mukhamandapam), the great gathering hall (mahamandapam) and the pavilion that connects the great hall with the sanctum (ardhamandapam). The temple complex integrates a large pillared and covered veranda (prakara) in its spacious courtyard, with a perimeter of about 450 metres (1,480 ft) for circumambulation. Outside this pillared veranda there are two walls of enclosure, the outer one being defensive and added in 1777 CE by the French colonial forces with gun-holes with the temple serving as an arsenal. They made the outer wall high, isolating the temple complex area. On its east end is the original main gopuram or gateway that is barrel vaulted. It is less than half the size of the main temple's vimana. Additional structures were added to the original temple after the 11th century, such as a mandapa in its northeast corner and additional gopurams (gateways) on its perimeters to allow people to enter and leave from multiple locations. The Brihadisvara temple continued the Hindu temple traditions of South India by adopting architectural and decorative elements, but its scale significantly exceeded the temples constructed before the 11th century. The Chola era architects and artisans innovated the expertise to scale up and build, particularly with heavy stone and to accomplish the 63.4 metres (208 ft) high towering vimana. The apex structure on top of the temple is believed to be carved out of a single stone carving.It is so designed that the Vimana does not cast a shadow at noon during any part of the year. Vimana is the structure over the garbhagriha or inner sanctum in the Hindu temples of South India and Odisha.It is like a stepped pyramid that rises up geometrically rather than the curving Shikhara of North India. Some of the shrines and structures were added during the Pandya, Nayaka, Vijayanagara and Maratha era, before the colonial era started, and these builders respected the original plans and symmetry rules. Inside the original temple courtyard, along with the main sanctum and Nandi-\n\n16. Journal of the Indo Nordic Author’s Collective 16 mandapam are two major shrines, one for Kartikeya and for Parvati. The complex has additional smaller shrines. Nandi mandapam and the entrance gopurams, northeast view from courtyard. The temple faces east, and once had a water moat around it. This has been filled up. The fortified wall now runs around this moat. The two walls have ornate gateways called the gopurams. These are made from stone and display entablature. The main gateways are on the east side. The first one is called the Keralantakan tiruvasal, which means the \"sacred gate of the Keralantakan\". The word Keralantakan was the surname of king Rajaraja who built it. About a 100 metres (330 ft) ahead is the inner courtyard gopuram called the Rajarajan tiruvasal. This is more decorated than the Keralantakan tiruvasal, such as with its adhishthanam relief work narrating scenes from the Puranas and other Hindu texts. The inner eastern gopuram leads to a vast courtyard, in which the shrines are all signed to east-west and north-west cardinal directions. The complex can be entered either on one axis through a five-story gopuram or with a second access directly to the huge main quadrangle through a smaller free-standing gopuram. The gopuram of the main entrance is 30 m high, smaller than the vimana. The vimanam (temple tower) is 216 ft (66 m) high and is the tallest in the world. The Kumbam (the apex or the bulbous structure on the top) of the temple is carved out of a single rock and weighs around 80 tons. There is a big statue of Nandi (sacred bull), carved out of a single rock measuring about 16 feet long and 13 feet high at the entrance. The entire temple structure is made out of granite, the nearest sources of which are about 60 km to the west of temple. The main temple-related monuments and the great tower is in the middle of this courtyard. Around the main temple that is dedicated to Shiva, are smaller shrines, most of which are aligned axially. These are dedicated to his consort Parvati, his sons Subrahmanya and Ganesha, Nandi, Varahi, Karuvur deva (the guru of Rajaraja Chola), Chandeshvara and Nataraja. The Nandi mandapam has a monolithic seated bull facing the sanctum. In between them are stairs leading to a columned porch and community gathering hall, then an inner mandapa connecting to the pradakshina patha, or circumambulation path. The Nandi (bull) facing the mukh-mandapam weighs about 25 tonnes. It is made of a single stone and is about 2 m in height, 6 m in length and 2.5 m in width. The image of Nandi is a monolithic one and is one of the largest in the country.\n\n17. Journal of the Indo Nordic Author’s Collective 17 Sanctum and the Sri-vimana Different views of the Sri-vimana. The sanctum is at the center of the western square. It is surrounded by massive walls that are divided into levels by sharply cut sculptures and pilasters providing deep bays and recesses. Each side of the sanctuary has a bay with iconography. The interior of the sanctum sanctorum hosts an image of the primary deity, Shiva, in the form of a huge stone linga. It is called Karuvarai, a Tamil word that means \"womb chamber\". This space is called garbha griha in other parts of India. Only priests are allowed to enter this inner-most chamber. In the Dravida style, the sanctum takes the form of a miniature vimana. It has the inner wall together with the outer wall creating a path around the sanctum for circumambulation (pradakshina). The entrance is highly decorated. The inside chamber is the sanctum sanctorum, which houses the brihad linga. The main Vimana (Shikhara) is a massive 16 storeys tower of which 13 are tapering squares. It dominates the main quadrangle. It sits above a 30.18 metres (99.0 ft) sided square. The tower is elaborately articulated with Pilaster, piers(a raised structure), and attached columns which are placed rhythmically covering every surface of the vimana. Deities and Natya Sastra dance mudras The bronze Nataraja design of Thanjavur found in many museums was commissioned for this temple's sanctum. The temple is dedicated to Shiva in the form of a huge linga, his abstract aniconic representation. It is 8.7 m (29 ft) high, occupying two storeys of the sanctum. It is one of the largest monolithic linga sculptures in India.\n\n18. Journal of the Indo Nordic Author’s Collective 18 Sculptures on the maha-mandapam walls North side South side Bhairava (Shiva) Ganesha Mahishasuramardini (Durga) Vishnu Saraswati Gajalakshmi The sikhara, a cupolic dome (25 tons), is octagonal and rests on a single block of granite, weighing 80 tons. The Shaivism temple celebrates all major Hindu traditions by including the primary deities of the Vaishnavism and Shaktism tradition in the great mandapa of the main temple. The distribution of the deities is generally symmetric, except for the east entrance side which provide for the door and walkway. In addition to the main deities, each side provides for dvarapalas (guardians), and various other sculptures. The vestibule has three stone sculptures that is intricately carved, and mural paintings. The ground floor level sanctum walls have the following sculptures: • East wall: Lingodbhava, standing Shiva, Pashupata-murti, plus two dvarapalas flanking the pathway from ardha-mandapam\n\n19. Journal of the Indo Nordic Author’s Collective 19 • South wall: Bhikshatana, Virabhadra, Dakshinamurti, Kalantaka, Nataraja[note 3] plus two dvarapalas • West wall: Harihara (half Shiva, half Vishnu), Lingodbhava, Chandrashekhara without prabhavali, Chandrashekhara with prabhavali, plus two dvarapalas • North wall: Ardhanarishvara (half Shiva, half Parvati), Gangadhara without Parvati, Pashupata-murti, Shiva-alingana-murti, plus two dvarapalas One of the 81 dance positions carved on the outer wall of the upper storey corridor wall. On the second floor, Shiva's Tripurantaka form in different postures is depicted corresponding to these sculptures. Above these floors, the sri-vimana towers above in thirteen storeys (talas). Above these storeys is a single square block of granite weight 80 tons, and 7.77 metres (25.5 ft) side. On top of this block, at its corners are Nandi pairs each about 1.98 metres (6 ft 6 in) by 1.68 metres (5 ft 6 in) in dimension. Above the center of this granite block rises the griva, the sikhara and the finial (stupi) of Tamil Hindu temple architecture. This stupi is 3.81 metres (12.5 ft) in height, and was originally covered with gold (no longer). The sikhara at the top is cupola-shaped and weighs 25 tons. Each storey of this tower is decorated with kutas and salas. The shrinking squares tower architecture of this temple differs from the tower at the Chola temple at Gangaikondasolisvaram, because this is straight in contrast to the latter which is curvilinear. The temple's sri-vimana magnitude has made it a towering landmark for the city.[38] The upper storey corridor wall of the aditala is carved with 81 of the 108 dance karanas – postures of Natya Sastra. This text is the basis of the Bharathanatyam, the classical dance of Tamil Nadu. The 27 unrepresented karanas are blank blocks of stone, and it is unclear why these were not carved. The 81 postures carved suggest the significance of this classical Indian dance form by early 11th century. The garbhagriha is square and sits on a plinth. This is moulded and 0.5 metres (1 ft 8 in) thick. It consists of upapitham and adhishthanam, respectively 140 cm and 360 cm thick.\n\n20. Journal of the Indo Nordic Author’s Collective 20 Mandapa The two mandapa, namely maha-mandapa and mukha-mandapa, are square plan structures axially aligned between the sanctum and the Nandi mandapa. The maha-mandapa has six pillars on each side. This too has artwork. The Vitankar and Rajaraja I bronze are here, but these were added much later. The maha-mandapa is flanked by two giant stone dvarapalas. It is linked to the mukha-mandapa by stairs. The entrance of the mukha-mandapa also has dvarapalas. With the mandapa are eight small shrines for dikpalas, or guardian deities of each direction such as Agni, Indra, Varuna, Kubera and others. These were installed during the rule of Chola king Rajendra I. Inscriptions indicate that this area also had other iconography from major Hindu traditions during the Chola era, but these are now missing. The original eight shrines included those for Surya (the sun god), Saptamatrikas (seven mothers), Ganesha, Kartikeya, Jyeshtha, Chandra (the moon god), Chandeshvara and Bhairava. Similarly, in the western wall cella was a massive granite Ganesha built during Rajaraja I era, but who is now found in the tiruch-churru-maligai (southern veranda). Of the Shaktism tradition's seven mothers, only Varahi survives in a broken form. Her remnants are now found in a small modern era brick \"Varahi shrine\" in the southern side of the courtyard. The original version of the others along with their original Chola shrines are missing. Murals A mural of Rajaraja I and his guru. Nayaka dynasty ceiling mural in the Nandi shrine.:The temple has an underneath layer of Chola frescoes on the sanctum walls along the circumambulatory pathway. These frescoes which cover floor to ceiling, were discovered in 1931 by S. K. Govindasami of the Anamalai University. The painters used natural pigments and infused it into the wet limestone layer as it was setting in. The Chola frescoes were largely of Shaivism themes. These were restored in the 2000s. The total Chola fresco area is about 670 square metres (7,200 sq ft), of which about 112 square metres (1,210 sq ft) had been uncovered as of 2010 in a method that preserves both paintings, a technique developed by Archaeological Survey of India. The frescoes narrate Hindu mythology. According to Balasubrahmanyam, most frescoes are related to Shiva, but the 11th century Chola frescoes also show Vishnu, Durga and others, as well as scenes of Chola royalty, courtly and common life.\n\n21. Journal of the Indo Nordic Author’s Collective 21 Murals in the ceiling of Nandi mandapa, Brihadeeswara temple The later constructions, additions and modifications to the temple curtailed the amount of natural light inside the temple. The frescoes were thus photographed in a limited way and interpreted. According to Sriraman, a complete imaging with better photographic equipment suggests that these historic interpretations were incorrect. For example, a fresco that was previously interpreted as Dakshinamurti Shiva is actually a secular scene of a royal guru meditating under a banyan tree. On the tree are shown peacocks, birds, monkeys, squirrels and owls, plus a cobra. The animals and birds are shown as worried of the cobra, the one's closer to the snake are shown to be more worried. Other parts of the panel similarly show a court listening to a saint. Other show women in different dresses in different dance mudra. Some of the paintings in the sanctum sanctorum and the walls in the passage had been damaged because of the soot that had deposited on them once upon a time. Owing to the continuous exposure to smoke and soot from the lamps and burning of camphor in the sanctum sanctorum over a period of centuries certain parts of the Chola paintings on the circumambulatory passage walls had been badly damaged. The Archaeological Survey of India, for the first time in the world, used its unique de-stucco process to restore 16 Nayak paintings, which were superimposed on 1000-year-old Chola frescoes.[42] These 400-year-old paintings have been mounted on fibre glass boards, displayed at a separate pavilion. Inscriptions Tamil Inscriptions in Thanjavur Brahadeeshwara Temple written 1000 years ago The temple walls have numerous inscriptions in Tamil and Grantha scripts. Many of these begin with customary Sanskrit and Tamil language historical introduction to the king who authorized it, and predominant number of them discuss gifts to the temple or temple personnel, in some cases residents of the city. The temple complex has sixty four inscriptions of Rajaraja Chola I, twenty nine inscriptions of Rajendra Chola I, one each of Vikrama Chola, Kulottunga I and Rajendradeva (Rajendra Chola II), three of a probable Pandyan king, two of Vijayanagara rulers namely, Achyutappa Nayaka and Mallapa Nayaka.\n\n22.

Temple personnel An inscription on the north wall of enclosure, dated 1011 CE, gives a detailed accounts of people employed and supported by the temple. The inscription gives their wages, roles and names. It includes over 600 names including those of priests, lamp lighters, washermen, tailors, jewelers, potters, carpenters, sacred parasol bearers, dance gurus, dancing girls, singers, male and female musicians, superintendents of performance artists, accountants among others. Their wages was in parcels of land, so their temple employment was likely part-time.[47][45] The temple employed devadasis who were dancers and singers of devotional hymns. Among its numerous inscriptions are frequent gifts that state, \"to provide for worship, for food to assembly of sannyasis (monks or ascetics) and for repairs\". According to George Michell, the Thanjavur temple was a major charity institution in its history. It provides free meal for pilgrims, devotees and wayfarers on a daily basis. On the days of Hindu festivals, these meals were elaborate and when brahmins were particularly invited and fed. Millennium commemoration 1,000-year-old Thanjavur Brihadeeshwara Temple - view at sunrise. Dancers gathered at Brihadishwara Temple to commemorate it. Built in the year 1010 CE by Raja Raja Chola in Thanjavur, the temple is popularly known as the Big Temple. It turned 1000 years old in September 2010. To celebrate the 1000th year of the grand structure, the state government and the town held many cultural events. It was to recall the 275th day of his 25th regal year (1010 CE) when Raja Raja Chola (985–1014 CE) handed over a gold-plated kalasam (copper pot or finial) for the final consecration to crown the vimana, the 59.82-metre tall tower above the sanctum.\n\n23. Journal of the Indo Nordic Author’s Collective 23 Bharathanatyam Yajna To mark the occasion, the state government organised a Bharathanatyam Yajna, classical dance show under noted dancer Padma Subramaniam. It was jointly organised by the Association of Bharatanatyam Artistes of India (ABHAI) and the Brhan Natyanjali Trust, Thanjavur. To mark the 1000th anniversary of the building, 1000 dancers from New Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Singapore, Malaysia and the US danced in concert to the recorded 11 verses of divine music Thiruvisaippa (ninth volume of Thirumurai) composed by Karuvur deva (the guru of Raja Raja Chola). The small town turned into a cultural hub for two days beginning 26 September 2010 as street performers and dancers performed throughout the town. Commemorative stamps and coins On 26 September 2010 (Big Temple's fifth day of millennium celebrations), as a recognition of Big Temple's contribution to the country's cultural, architectural, epigraphical history, a special ₹ 5 postage stamp featuring the 216-feet tall giant Raja Gopuram was released by India Post.The Reserve Bank of India commemorated the event by releasing a ₹ 5 coin with the model of temple embossed on it.[53][54] A Raja, Cabinet Minister of Communications and Information Technology released the esteemed Brihadeeswarar temple special stamp, the first of which was received by G K Vasan, Cabinet Minister of Shipping.Mumbai Mint issued Rs 1000 Commemorative Coin with the same picture as on the Rs 5 coin. It was the first 1000 Rupees coin to be released in the Republic of India coinage. This coin was a Non Circulative Legal Tender (NCLT). On 1 April 1954, the Reserve Bank of India released a ₹ 1000 currency note featuring a panoramic view of the Brihadeeswar temple marking its cultural heritage and significance. In 1975, the then government led by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi demonetised all ₹ 1,000 currency notes in an effort to curtail black money. These notes are now popular among collectors.[56] In 2010, the then Tamil Nadu chief minister, M Karunanidhi renamed Semmai Rice, a type of high productivity paddy variant, as Raja Rajan-1000 to mark the millennial year of the constructor of the temple, Rajaraja Chola]. The temple is currently administered and managed by Babaji Bhonsle, the head of the Thanjavur Maratha royal family. He serves as the hereditary trustee of the palace Devasthanam which continues to manage 88 Chola temples including the Brihadeeswara temple. Tamil groups have been unsuccessfully petitioning the Tamil Nadu government to revoke these rights as he is not of Chola or Tamil lineage. According to one of the protesters, who also happens to be the coordinator of the Big Temple Rights Retrieval Committee, Babaji Bhonsle is also not the legal heir of the Maratha kings of Thanjavur Brihadisvara Temple, Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu, India\n\n24.

It is huge a 216 feet hollow structure which has withstood all weak or violent disturbances of nature – winds, rainfalls, storms – when the Great Tanjore Temple is built of interlocking stones without any binding material. We call ourselves modern and technologically advanced but even today – No 200+ feet structure in this world is built without binding materials, cements or blocks. Such highly developed, flawless and perfect is the Vedic building technology used by Hindu King RajaRaja Chola and his Hindu engineers that in comparison it portrays our present construction technology as primitive and farce. The Tanjore (Thanjavur) City and Temple is not Built by Aliens But Tamil Hindus Who Respect their Gods The city is believed to have been named after an asur (demon) Rakshas Tanjan who was annihilated by Bhagwan Vishnu. Locals say that the city gets its name from ‘Than-sei- oor’, which means a place surrounded by rivers and green paddy fields. Several hundreds of years ago Tanjore was initially developed and maintained by Chola dynasty (பசோழர்) with rigorous hardwork and for selfless bhakti, love towards Bhagwan Shiv. That is the main reason that Tanjore is lush green, lavishly spread with good water facilities and palm forests. Hindu RajaRaja Chola was proponent of fresh environment and cared for nature, to let divine opulence flow through Tanjore and other nearby cities developed by him and his heirs. There are many places, structures and ancient establishments developed with Vedic engineering that are considered mysterious as it is seen with the paradigm of vested western mindset. Bhagwan Shiv Mandir, Thanjavur or famously corrupted by english as the Tanjore big temple is one of the most mysterious dharmic structure around.\n\n29. Journal of the Indo Nordic Author’s Collective 29 ! Peruvudaiyaar Kovil – Solved Mysteries of Brihadisvara Shiv Temple, Thanjavur (Tanjore) SOME OF THE MYSTERIES OF THE THANJAVUR (TANJORE) BIG TEMPLE ARE: 1. Underground passages in Thanjavur (Tanjore) 216 feet Temple 2. Huge cap stone at the top of Thanjavur (Tanjore) Shiv Temple 3. Painting in Thanjavur (Tanjore) Big temple 4. Granite stones used for the Mandir construction 5. Cutting and carving of Granite stones for Building Shiv Temple 6. Secret passages in Thanjavur (Tanjore) Big temple 7. Shadow of Thanjavur (Tanjore) Shiv Temple 8. The construction of the world’s first known and only shallow Shiv temple built by interlocking stones and not by binding them is still a great mystery to the people of world who are devoid of\n\n30. Journal of the Indo Nordic Author’s Collective 30 knowledge based on Vedas and ancient Hindu texts. With the blessing of Shiv Shankar, Hindu King RajaRaja Chola constructed Thanjavur (Tanjore) temple. 1. UNDERGROUND PASSAGES IN BRIHADISVARA THANJAVUR (TANJORE) 216 FEET TEMPLE The Tanjore big temple contains more than 100 underground passages to various places. The underground channels also contain some secret paths that lead to various places like the Palace of RajaRaja Chola and also to other important destinations. The underground transits end to different temples and also to various places in and around Tanjore. Most of the underground passages were sealed and if the people choose the wrong passage then there are possibilities that the path might lead to mazed unexitable zones. It is widely known that this was a trap for the safety of RajaRaja Chola kingdom. Underground Passages of Thanjavur (Tanjore): The underground passage is build for Sages, Kings, Queens who roamed through the various temples using underground routes conveniently. The routes were very useful to reach temples during auspicious days like Thaipusam (தமிழர் திருவிழோ), Deepawali (दीपावली), Makar Sankranti (मकर संक्ांति) , Maha Shivratri (महा तिवराति) and other such pious Hindu festivals. Few passages were interconnected to be used for free flow of fresh air running through lush green vegetation filled with oxygen for healthy breathing of the occupants roaming through the underground transits of the Thanjavur (Tanjore) temple. There was a separate elevated platform constructed for RajaRaja Chola so that he was conveniently able to do abhishek of large Shiv Ling present in Garbhagriha.\n\n31. Journal of the Indo Nordic Author’s Collective 31 Other passages were leading to doorways of tunnels which were sources of water channelized from the fresh river water. 2. HUGE CAP STONE AT THE TOP OF THANJAVUR (TANJORE) SHIV TEMPLE The biggest mystery of all the other mysteries in Thanjavur (Tanjore) Shiv temple is the huge cap stone in the top of the huge Mandir (பகோவில்). The weight of the cap stone at the top of Thanjavur (Tanjore) weighs astonishingly 80 tons. No man built shallow structure around the world has such huge stone cap at the top of the constructed temple. “Why was the top of the Thanjavur temple capped ? and How did the Hindu builders of Thanjavur (Tanjore) were successfully able to place the heavy cap stone at the top of the Gopuram on 216 feet high temple ?.” These are frequently asked queries which globally baffles scientists, archaeologists and common people. 2.1 Why was the Top of the Thanjavur temple Capped The Garbhagriha, where Shiv Lingam is placed emits huge amount of electromagnetic positive energies. The 80 tons stone was kept as a repulsive force so as to make the energy revolve around the temple perimeter and keep the place pious and divinely graceful. The flow of energy move around and within the Vedic structure giving healthily calming, soothing and mentally composing effect to the bhakts and yogis.\n\n32. Journal of the Indo Nordic Author’s Collective 32 2.2. How Hindu Tamil Architects of Tanjore Placed Stone at the Top of Thanjavur Shiv Temple There are two explanations (a) Manually (b) Vedic Mantra (a) 80 Ton Stone Cap Placed on top of Brihadeeswarar Temple The Massiveness of Structure and 80 Ton Stone Cap at Top of Thanjavur Shiv Temple At the top of the Sri Vimana Thanjavur temple, near the neck of the Gopuram there are 8 Nandis seen very prominently even while standing from the ground. These Nandis are huge and carved from single stone. A Nandi of the similar scale is seen on the southern Prahara. One can judge the size of the Nandi and its relative weight. On the front side of the Vimana that is facing the east direction one can see the sculptures of abode of Bhagwan Shiv called as Mahameru. The whole of Sri Vimana is built using granite rocks and the sculptures in them are covered by a thin layer of mortar to preserve the granite sculptures inside.\n\n33. Journal of the Indo Nordic Author’s Collective 33 It is widely known that there were no heavy machines, cranes or any high end equipments used to lift the stone up and place it at the top of the temple. The only thing that could help achieve, the almost impossible feat, were the fleet of elephants. A massive triangular podium of half- pyramidal shaped structure was constructed that was erected adjacent to the opposite side of the massive temple. The mammoth task was carried over by intelligent Vedic architects while performing Yagna to take blessings of Bhagwan Shiv, under guidance of Brahmans, Hindu Sages and RajaRaja Chola. The figure below represents the construction site, explains how it was done. Massive staircase of rollers were constructed at the base to pull 80 tons stone by fleets of elephants and men. The platform was more inclined towards ground and not so angular as seen in the representational image. Mammoth: The Size of the 80 Ton Stone Cap and Nandi Moortis at Top of Shiv Temple\n\n34. Journal of the Indo Nordic Author’s Collective 34 (b) Vedic Mantra Used to Place 80 Ton Stone on Top of Thanjavur (Tanjore) Temple ओ३म् (ॐ) is the Vedic sound and the creator of everything in this universe – invisible atom to biggest mountains. Sun itself recites ॐ (chanted as ओ३म् ) while giving light to the world. The meditation of OM (ओम) by Sun God keeps it alive and helps it in positioning itself properly in the solar system. YOU CAN HEAR SOUND OF ॐ RESONATED BY SUN . SAGES AND COMMON HINDUS KNEW THE SECRET OF SOUND VIBRATION\n\n35. Journal of the Indo Nordic Author’s Collective 35 When chanting of Vedic Mahamantra ॐ ( as ओम) can position sun and make it master of our solar system. Then reciting Vedic Mantra could levitate 80 ton stone for placing it at top of Brihadeeswarar Temple or Periya Kovil, an easy task for Vedic sages. There were many gupt mantras (ரகசிய மந்திரங்கள்) that were recited by Hindu Sages to get impossible tasks done while penancing and remembering Bhagwan Shiv. It might sound miracle for all of us so called modern but materialistic beings; it was never a secret for ancient Hindus. In fact, modern inventions are stolen from Vedas – the material yantras (machines) that we all use today was strictly prohibited by our Sages. 3. PAINTING IN THANJAVUR (TANJORE) BIG TEMPLE There are lots of high quality paintings in the Tanjore big temple that explain many things about the kingdom of Chola dynasty and also the greatness of particularly, the RajaRaja Chola. Some paintings also explain about the RajaRaja Chola’s selfless bhakti towards Bhagwan Shiv Shankar. There were also depiction of contemporaneous history in the painting of Thanjavur (Tanjore) or Thanjai. Thanjavur has a unique place in the history of Indian painting, it is so because the paintings are splendid, beautiful and looks very fresh as if the depictions were made recently. Painters across the world are awestruck and they are still trying hard to figure out how even today these hundreds of years old Hindu paintings look so natural and novel. RajaRaja Chola always respected Hindu Sages, Gurus and Sadhus – one of the paintings reflect him giving respect to his Guru. Thanjavur Paintings Everlasting Beauty: The everlasting beauty of Thanjavur paintings lies in the herbs. Hindu Sages used natural elements for designing Vedic symbols which acted as gateways of communication. These symbols were purposely painted using solution made up of natural elements like flower petals, colorful leaves, haldi (turmeric), treated muds, crushed salts, neem, pressed herbs, etc. The lasting of such Vedic designs were ensured using medicinal learnings of Ayurved. Hindu Sages were intelligent and they knew that to establish divine connection with Gods, the continuous recitement of mantras should be supported by yantras that have longer recency and permanency. The same method of Hindu Sadhus were originally\n\n36. Journal of the Indo Nordic Author’s Collective 36 replicated by Hindu Painters, who used their ancient knowledge to paint everlasting beautiful paintings. 4. GRANITE STONES USED FOR THE MANDIR CONSTRUCTION The granite stones are one of the strongest stones in the world. It is very difficult to carve intricate designs on the granite stones without powerful blunt devices. Granite is also very heavy so movement of huge stones from one place to another is also not possibly easy. More than 130,000 tons of granite were used to build Rajarajeshwar Thanjavur temple. The heavy stones weighing several tons were bought down from the place that was located 50 miles away from the Tanjore temple. Granite Stones Pulled By Elephants: Hindu Kings had huge resource of animals for building temples and army forces. How opulent was legacy of Hindu Kings, can be known from the fact – Greek biographer stated that Nanda dynasty had a mighty military power of 80000 horse back troops, 200000 foot soldiers, 6000 battle elephants and about 8000 war horse-drawn vehicles. The reference of human and animal resource of Nanda dynasty was only for battlefront. For constructing structures they had different pool of animal resources. Similarly, RajaRaja Chola had allocated over 1000 elephants and over 5000 horses for the construction of structures.\n\n37. Journal of the Indo Nordic Author’s Collective 37 After constructing several temples, RajaRaja Chola and his Hindu engineers mastered the art of building Mandirs from Granite stones. 5. CUTTING AND CARVING OF GRANITE STONES FOR BUILDING SHIV TEMPLE The cutting and carving of the granite stone is very difficult, britishers after seeing Granite block temples tried to replicate the feat but failed miserably. While mughals when saw such temples tried ways to dismantle or reconvert Hindu temples into satanic tombs and mosques – true to the terrorism legacy they got from quran and dacoit mohammed. It was patience, selfless bhakti and love towards mother earth that made it possible. Hindu Kings were keen on protecting nature and never did any harm to the environment when they build temples. Whenever range of trees were cut from the forests for the construction of temples, an equal and in some cases double the number of trees were planted. Even today it is not possible to carve intricate designs on the Granite stones, as shown in the Thanjavur temples. How Granite Stones were Cut, Carved and Customized: Series of holes were created in the granite block. The holes could be deeper or surfacial based on the requirement. Then wooden sticks were filled in those holes, water was poured in the holes. After a long period of time the rocks would break. And in similar manner, customized Granite blocks were cut.\n\n38. Journal of the Indo Nordic Author’s Collective 38 6. SECRET PASSAGES IN THANJAVUR (TANJORE) BIG TEMPLE A dedicated secret passage was created to connect different secret places in hidden mesh-like structure. It is decorated with distinct features depicting Vedic history of Bharat (India). While roaming through secret passages, it is impossible to come back to the starting point, as no one knows the route to reach the inter-places meshed to each other. That is the reason, most of the underground and secret passages are closed for the common public and archaeologists. What are Secret Passages of Thanjavur (Tanjore): Secret Passages are closed since entrance to them is only possible when you recite right mantra to enter it. The in-roads through the secret passages lead to places which RajaRaja Chola wanted only his close confidante to know. Such places were holding keys to the treasure chest, rare scripts, calligraphs and vaults whose confidentiality were to be maintained. Shadow of Thanjavur (Tanjore) Gopuram of Shiv Temple not Falling on Ground\n\n39. Journal of the Indo Nordic Author’s Collective 39 The huge cap of Tanjore big temple is constructed in such a way that the shadow of the Tanjore big temple Gopuram will not fall on the ground at noon in any season. It will just fall on itself. Why Does the Shadow of Gopuram Does not Fall on the Ground: It is the only structure in the world to have this peculiar feature. During morning or evening when the Sun is out, the shadow can be seen falling on the ground. It is only during noon that the shadow of Gopuram will not fall on ground but on itself. The main reason is the basement of structure which is big enough to absorb the shadow of the Gopuram on its base itself. INTERESTING FEATURES OF THE BRIHADEESHWARA TEMPLE OF TANJORE (THANJAVUR) WORLD HERITAGE A study in Oriental architecture or history is certainly incomplete without a mention of the Tanjore Brihadeeshwara Temple or the Tanjore Periya Kovil (Big Temple). This imposing structure was built by RajaRaja Cholan and his sister Kundavai, both ardent devotees of Bhagwan Shiv. It was constructed by the King at the height of the Chola reign to signify his bhakti, power and strength. Here are few interesting facts about this Chola temple of Thanjavur: a) The original name of the deity was Rajarajeshwar. The Hindu Marathas protected it from mughal invasion, gave it the name Brihadeeshwara or the Great Ishwara. b) The main temple is entirely built of granite. More than 130,000 tons of granite were used to built it. c) The only temple in the world wherein the shadow of its Gopuram does not a appear on the ground at noon. d) The statue of Nandi at the entrance of the temple is carved out of a single stone. e) The main Vimanam, which is at about 200 feet is often called Dakshin Meru or Southern Meru. Meru also signifies the centre of the universe and the axis of the world. f) The inspiration to build the temple came to Raja Raja Cholan during his visit to Sri Lanka seeing Vedic structures of Hindu kings and was a result of a divine dream he had. g) The temple has a portrait of Raja Raja Cholan paying obeisance to Bhagwan Natraj. This is undoubtedly, the first ever instance of a royal portrait. h) Inscriptions in the temple point towards Kunjara Mallan Raja Raja Perunthachan as the chief architect of the temple. His successors survive to this day and practice the art of Vastu or Vastu Shastra. i) Portraying dance is the reflection of divine emotions of Bhakts (devotees) showing their joyful\n\n40. Journal of the Indo Nordic Author’s Collective 40 feelings which they sense when they see the God himself. Depictions of nartakis or dancers showing eighty one of hundred and eight karanas (108 synchronised movements of hands and feet) in Bharat Natyam are carved here. These selective karanas represented here are a part of karanas mentioned in the Natya Shastra of Rishi Bharat. There is also evidence that the temple was a platform for trained dancers to showcase their devotional talent. These depictions are first of their kind. j) The inscriptions also mention the different kinds of jewels used in the period. Each of these jewels are mentioned in detail. A total of twenty three different types of pearls, eleven varieties of diamonds and rubies are mentioned in these inscriptions. k) The chanting of ॐ in the Grabhagriha exponentially expands the positive energies in the temple. What astounds historians is that there was not a single granite quarry in about 100 km radius of the temple. This means that transporting these stones would have been a herculean task. But Raja Raja Cholan insisted on the use of these stones. All of these features make this Chola temple of Tanjore, a magnum opus of the opulent Chola kingdom. Tourists across India must be encouraged to visit this amazing temple. It is wonderful structure similar to another stunning Kailasa temple architecture. Both these temples are beautiful and opulent than thousands of Taj Mahals put together – a tomb that needs repair almost every year. No such Hindu temples ever needed any repair since the time of inception. Few needed restoration post series of raids and destruction of Mughal terrorists. Time to showcase our glory to the world. We Indians must promote such temples to restore our culture and educate Hindu youth about our affluent past. GREAT INTEGRATION OF MUSIC, VEDIC SOUND AND HINDU ARCHITECTURE The Only Tallest Hindu Temple Known to be at Least 1000 Years Old The temple was built within schedule, completed in record time of 7 years, amounting to moving and placing almost 50 tons of rock each and every day, not to forget carving and aligning it. When the Brihadeeswara temple was completed in 1003 CE, it was the tallest temple in India by an order of magnitude of 10. A thousand years later, standing at 216 feet, it is still the tallest non- bound temple in India and world. Atop the soaring Viman (famously known due to its structure as explained in Vymanika Shastra) – is a capstone that weighs 80 tons. The best thing in the Chola temples is that the tower lies over the sanctums has more elevation as compared to the towers set over the Gopuram (tower) that could be found at the entrance. After dusk, when the temple is been illuminated, its topmost light over the dome seems not less than another planet glowing and coming closer to the earth. This is also one of the attraction of the tallest Shiv Temple that draw thousands of people to it. Thanjavur (Tanjore) Temple Honors Vedic Music and Sacred Sound of the Universe Sree Ganesh idol is worshiped first before praying other Gods. At the entrance of sanctum sanctorum, one can see the two idols of Shivputra Ganesh in the corridor. On taping the two, you will feel the sound traveling through stone in one idol and through metal on the other. The main hall of the temple was used by the devotee dancers and musicians performing bhajans to praise Bhagwan Shiv. There are some musical pillars producing different sounds when tapped. The entire Vedic structure was built in sync with sacred sounds, vibrations, geometry and mantra. It is great integration of Vedic elements collated into one massive building\n\n41.

X The temple sanctum remains closed from 12 pm to 4 pm, and one must keep that in mind while visiting. By Monidipa Dey Standing as a shining example of the high standards reached by the mighty Cholas in field of art and architecture, the Brihadeeswara Peruvudaiyar temple in Thanjavur is also a reminder of the times when temples held a central position in the polity of the land and dominated the socio- political, religious, and educational scenarios. A masterpiece of Raja Raja Chola’s times (1010 CE), the temple was built to dominate the skyline of Thanjavur of that era, and it continues to do so even to this very day.\n\n42. Journal of the Indo Nordic Author’s Collective 42 The main shrine in Brihadeeswara Peruvudaiyar temple is dedicated to Shiva, and the sanctum holds a large Shivalinga established by the great Raja Raja himself. Like other Chola temples, this one also has a flight of steps leading from two sides to a raised platform, which further leads on to the pillared mandapas and sanctum. The tall vimana over the sanctum is pyramidal in shape with a circular stone shikhara on top and is one of the tallest in South India. The large temple courtyard is surrounded by a prakara or wall, and attached to the wall is a pillared cloister that holds murtis of Nagadevtas, and 108 Shivlingas. As one enters the temple complex, the first small gate that one crosses is known as the Maratha gate, built by the Marathas at a later period. The Maratha gate is followed by two Chola era gates with tall gopuras that are crowded with sculptures, while the walls hold beautiful carvings depicting stories from the epics. An empty moat runs around the temple complex. The east facing the main temple has a large nandi mandapa in front. Built at a later period, this pillared mandapa has a huge monolithic black nandi sitting inside it. There are colorful paintings on the mandapa ceiling, which were done at a much later period (early 20th century) by the local artists’ guild. Besides the nandi mandapa, there are other subsidiary shrines built at different times in the temple courtyard, which include the Ganapati shrine, Karuvur devta shrine, Subhramanya shrine, Chandikesvara shrine, Amman shrine, and Nataraja shrine.\n\n43. Journal of the Indo Nordic Author’s Collective 43 READ: IRCTC Northeast packages: Explore adventurous and hilly terrains of Meghalaya like never before; details here\n\n44. Journal of the Indo Nordic Author’s Collective 44 The main temple walls hold some of the most exquisite Chola era stone sculptures, which include huge dwarapalas with their famous tarjani (warning) and vismaya (wonder) mudras. The other murtis seen on the temple walls include Ganesha, Vishnu with Sridevi and Bhudevi, various aspects of Shiva, Saraswati, and Mahishasuramardini. The Brihadesvara Peruvudaiyar temple is especially famous for its inscriptions that give a detailed account of the different rulers and dynasties. This temple has inscriptions by the Cholas, Pandyas, Vijayanagara kings, Marathas, and Nayakas. One of the Maratha inscriptions gives details on how the king arranged for purification and re-consecration ceremonies of the temple in 1801-02 while building mandapas, repairing damaged shrines, and renovating the wall, kitchen, and courtyard flooring.\n\n45. Journal of the Indo Nordic Author’s Collective 45 The magnificence of Chola art can be viewed here in the form of incomplete carvings of fine karanas of Natyashastra on the corridor walls in the first floor. The dark ambulatory passage that goes around the sanctum springs a surprise in the form of three large sculptures of Shiva, along with exquisite Chola era paintings on ceilings and walls. Travel tips: Brihadeswara Peruvudaiyar temple in Thanjavur tends to overwhelm the viewer with its beautiful architecture, paintings, and exquisite sculptures. The temple is huge and the entire complex will take a few hours for a thorough look. The best time to visit is from November to January when the weather is relatively cooler. The temple sanctum remains closed from 12 pm to 4 pm, and one must keep that in mind while visiting. (The author is a well-known travel writer.

The site includes three great 11th- and 12th- century Temples: the Brihadisvara Temple at Thanjavur, the Brihadisvara Temple at Gangaikondacholisvaram and the Airavatesvara Temple at Darasuram. The Temple of Gangaikondacholisvaram, built by Rajendra I, was completed in 1035. Its 53-m vimana (sanctum tower) has recessed corners and a graceful upward curving movement, contrasting with the straight and severe tower at Thanjavur. The Airavatesvara temple complex, built by Rajaraja II,\n\n46. Journal of the Indo Nordic Author’s Collective 46 at Darasuram features a 24-m vimana and a stone image of Shiva. The temples testify to the brilliant achievements of the Chola in architecture, sculpture, painting and bronze casting. Great Living Chola Temples (India)\n\n47. Journal of the Indo Nordic Author’s Collective 47 Outstanding Universal Value Brief synthesis The great Cholas established a powerful monarchy in the 9th CE at Thanjavur and in its surroundings. They enjoyed a long, eventful rule lasting for four and a half centuries with great achievements in all fields of royal endeavour such as military conquest, efficient administration, cultural assimilation and promotion of art. All three temples, the Brihadisvara at Thanjavur, the Brihadisvara at Gangaikondacholapuram and Airavatesvara at Darasuram, are living temples. The tradition of temple worship and rituals established and practised over a thousand years ago, based on still older Agamic texts, continues daily, weekly and annually, as an inseparable part of life of the people. These three temple complexes therefore form a unique group, demonstrating a progressive development of high Chola architecture and art at its best and at the same time encapsulating a very distinctive period of Chola history and Tamil culture. The Brihadisvara temple at Tanjavur marks the greatest achievement of the Chola architects. Known in the inscriptions as Dakshina Meru, the construction of this temple was inaugurated by the Chola King, Rajaraja I (985-1012 CE) possibly in the 19th regal year (1003-1004 CE) and consecrated by his own hands in the 25th regal year (1009-1010 CE). A massive colonnaded prakara with sub-shrines dedicated to the ashatadikpalas and a main entrance with gopura (known as Rajarajantiruvasal) encompasses the massive temple. The sanctum itself occupies the centre of the rear half of the rectangular court. The vimana soars to a height of 59.82meters over the ground. This grand elevation is punctuated by a high upapitha, adhisthana with bold mouldings; the ground tier (prastara) is divided into two levels, carrying images of Siva. Over this rises the 13 talas and is surmounted by an octagonal sikhara. There is a circumambulatory path all around the sanctum housing a massive linga. The temple walls are embellished with expansive and exquisite mural paintings. Eighty-one of the one hundred and eight karanas, posed in Baharatanatya,are carved on the walls of second bhumi around the garbhagriha. There is a shrine dedicated to Amman dating to c.13th century. Outside the temple enclosure are the fort walls of the Sivaganga Little Fort surrounded by a moat, and the Sivaganga Tank, constructed by the Nayaks of Tanjore of the 16th century who succeeded the imperial Cholas. The fort walls enclose and protect the temple complex within and form part of the protected area by the Archaeological Survey of India. The Brihadisvara temple at Gangaikondacholapuram in the Perambalur district was built for Siva by Rajendra I (1012-1044 CE). The temple has sculptures of exceptional quality. The bronzes of Bhogasakti and Subrahmanya are masterpieces of Chola metal icons. The Saurapitha (Solar altar), the lotus altar with eight deities, is considered auspicious. The Airavatesvara temple at Tanjavur was built by the Chola king Rajaraja II (1143-1173 CE.): it is much smaller in size as compared to the Brihadisvara temple at Tanjavur and Gangaikondacholapuram. It differs from themin itshighly ornate execution. The temple consists of a sanctum without a circumambulatory path and axial mandapas. The front mandapa known\n\n48. Journal of the Indo Nordic Author’s Collective 48 in the inscriptions as Rajagambhiran tirumandapam, is unique as it was conceptualized as a chariot with wheels. The pillars of this mandapa are highly ornate. The elevation of all the units is elegant with sculptures dominating the architecture. A number of sculptures from this temple are the masterpieces of Chola art. The labelled miniature friezes extolling the events that happened to the 63 nayanmars (Saiva saints) are noteworthy and reflect the deep roots of Saivism in this region. The construction of a separate temple for Devi, slightly later than the main temple, indicates the emergence of the Amman shrine as an essential component of the South Indian temple complex. CRITERION FOR A LIVING CHOLA TEMPLE Criterion (i): The three Chola temples of Southern India represent an outstanding creative achievement in the architectural conception of the pure form of the dravida type of temple. Criterion (ii): The Brihadisvara Temple at Thanjavur became the first great example of the Chola temples, followed by a development of which the other two properties also bear witness. Criterion (iii): The three Great Chola Temples are an exceptional and the most outstanding testimony to the development of the architecture of the Chola Empire and the Tamil civilisation in Southern India. Criterion (iv): The Great Chola temples at Thanjavur, at Gangaikondacholapuram and Darasuram are outstanding examples of the architecture and the representation of the Chola ideology. Integrity These temples represent the development of Dravida architecture from Chola period to Maratha Period. All three monuments have been in a good state of preservation from the date of the inscription of the property and no major threats affect the World Heritage monuments. These monuments are being maintained and monitored by the Archaeological Survey of India. The tradition of temple worship and rituals established and practiced over a thousand years ago, based on still older Agamic texts, continues daily, weekly and annually, as an inseparable part of life of the people. Authenticity The three properties are considered to pass the test of authenticity in relation to their conception, material and execution. The temples are still being used, and they have great archaeological and historical value. The temple complexes used to be part of major royal towns, but have remained as the outstanding features in today’s mainly rural context. The components of the temple complex of the Brihadisvara at Thanjavur, declared a World Heritage property in 1987, includes six sub-shrines which have been added within the temple courtyard over a period of time. The later additions and interventions reinforce the original concept embodied in the main temple complex, in keeping with homogeneity and its overall integrity. The traditional use of the temple for worship and ritual contribute to the authenticity. However the periodic report of 2003 noted a number of conservation interventions that have the potential to impact on authenticity e.g chemical cleaning of the structures and the total replacement of the temple floor; highlighting the need for a Conservation Management Plan to guide the conservation of the property so as to ensure that authenticity is maintained. Similarly at the Brihadisvara complex at Gangaikondacholapuram, the sub-shrines of Chandesa and Amman were originally built according to the plan of Rajendra I, as well as the Simhakeni (the lion-well).Over time The sub-shrines of Thenkailasha, Ganesha and Durga\n\n49. Journal of the Indo Nordic Author’s Collective 49 were added. The authenticity of these additions is supported by the Agamictexts concerning renewal and reconstructions of temples in use. At Darasuram, archaeological evidence since gazettal enhances the authenticity of the property. The Airavatesvara temple complex itself has been entirely built at the same time with no later additional structures, and remains in its original form. The Deivanayaki Amman shrine built a little later also, stands in its original form within its own enclosure. Protection and management requirements The three cultural properties, namely, the Brihadisvara Temple complex at Thanjavur, the Brihadisvara temple complex at Gangaikondacholapuram and the Airavatesvara temple complex at Darasuram have been under the protection of the Archaeological Survey of India from the years 1922, 1946 and 1954 respectively. Further, all of them were brought under the Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act from the year 1959, at the time of its enactment. The management of these cultural properties can, therefore, be divided into two distinct parts: (1) The conservation, upkeep and maintenance of the properties, covering physical structure, architectural and site features, environment and surroundings, painting, sculpture, and other relics; and, (2) Temple administration covering staffing structure and hierarchy, accounting and bookkeeping, records and rules. The management authority in relation to (1) is solely vested with the Archaeological Survey of India while the aspects covered in (2) are entirely looked after by the Department of Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Therefore, it is evident that the property management is, in effect, jointly carried out by these two agencies, one a Central agency, the other belonging to the State. The practice has been for the two agencies to prepare their own management plans independently, and review them from time to time. When necessary, joint discussions are held and any apparent contradiction or points of conflict are given due consideration and sorted out. In the case of the Brihadisvara temple at Thanjavur and the Airavatesvara temple at Darasuram, the agencies consult the Hereditary Trustee of the Palace Devasthanam when necessary to finalise any issue which requires the Trustee’s input. However, since the nomination of the extended property , the Archaeological Survey of India the Department of Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments, Government of Tamil Nadu, have, in principle, agreed to draft a joint property management plan encompassing the specific requirements of both while meeting the fundamental objectives of protecting and promoting (1) the three cultural properties while enhancing their Outstanding Universal Value; (2) the Vedic and Agamic traditions and their significance in the life of the people; (3) the arts (sculpture, painting, bronze casting, dance, music and literature) inseparable components of traditional culture; and (4) the ancient science of vastu and silpa shastras, the fundamental guidelines to the construction of temples and religious structures, and to sculpture and painting. Since the inscription of property as World Heritage property, the monuments have been maintained in a good state of preservation and no major threats affect the monuments. Periodic maintenance and monitoring of the monuments by Archaeological Survey of India keeps the monuments to the expectation of tourists. However a Tourism Management and Interpretation Plan and a Conservation Management Plan are required to guide future work and determine priorities for conservation and interpretation effort. Basic amenities like water, toilets, etc. have been provided attracting more tourists to the place. Improving landscaping and tourist amenities\n\n50. Journal of the Indo Nordic Author’s Collective 50 are some of the long term plans. The temples have been centres of worship for the last 800-1000 years and continue to serve in this way. Monitoring of visitor numbers and impacts is necessary to ensure that they do not threaten the Outstanding Universal Value. https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/250/ Brihadeeswarar Temple about 70 kilometres (43 mi) to the southwest in Thanjavur.[1] The Gangaikonda Cholapuram Temple is smaller yet more refined than the Thanjavur Temple. Both are among the largest Shiva temples in South India and examples of Dravidian style temples. The temple is also referred to in texts as Gangaikonda Cholapuram Temple or Gangaikondacholeeswaram Temple, Jayankondam, in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Completed in 1035 AD by Rajendra Chola I as a part of his new capital, this Chola dynasty era temple is similar in design, and has a similar name, as the older 11th century. The main. temple dedicated to Shiva is based on a square plan, but it reverentially displays other Hindu deities such as Vishnu, Durga, Surya, Harihara, Ardhanarishvara, and others.[3][5] It opens to the sunrise and its sanctum, as well as the mandapas, are aligned on an east-west axis. In addition to the main shrine, the temple complex has a number of smaller shrines, gopura, and other monuments, with some partially ruined or restored in later centuries. The temple is famed for its bronze sculptures, artwork on its walls, the depiction of Nandi and the scale of its tower. As well as its notability for having been built by Rajendra I, the temple is also noteworthy for its numerous inscriptions, although none of them are his. Except for this temple, the old city of Gangaikonda Cholapuram – the capital of a powerful Asian empire from around AD 900 to AD 1215 or over three centuries along with its other major Chola-era Hindu temples have been completely destroyed, leaving a desolate place.[7][8] The Gangaikonda Cholapuram temple remains an active temple. Four daily rituals, and many yearly festivals are held there, of which the Shivarathri during the Tamil month of Masi (February– March), Aipassi Pournami during Aipassi (October– November) and Thiruvadirai during Margazhi (December–January) are the most prominent. It is one of the most visited tourist attractions in Tamil Nadu. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) administers the temple as a protected heritage monument. UNESCO declared it a World Heritage Site in 2004, along with the Brihadeeswarar Temple at Thanjavur and Airavatesvara temple at Darasuram. These are referred to collectively as the Great Living Chola Temples. The Brihadeeswarar Temple is located near the village of Gangaikonda Cholapuram, about 280 kilometres (170 mi) southwest of Chennai and 50 kilometres (31 mi) from Chidambaram. Roughly 70 kilometres (43 mi) to the northeast is the similarly named Chola dynasty era Brihadeeswarar Temple in Thanjavur, and is about 30 kilometres (19 mi) to the northeast of the Airavatesvara Temple. All three are UNESCO world heritage sites.[3][9] The temple is on Highway 81 connecting Tiruchirappalli and Chidambaram.[10] The nearby city of Chidambaram is connected to other major cities by daily trains on the Indian railway network, Tamil Nadu bus services and National Highways 36, 81, and 245.[11][12] The nearest airport with regular services is Tiruchirappalli International Airport (IATA: TRZ), about 120 kilometres (75 mi) away.[13]\n\n51. Journal of the Indo Nordic Author’s Collective 51 Though inland, the temple is near the Kollidam River, within the Cauveri River delta with access to the Bay of Bengal and through it to the Indian Ocean. Description The vimana traces a curve, unlike Thanjavur temple./The Ganesha shrine with the main Shiva temple Architecture Gangaikonda Cholapuram Temple is built in Dravidian style of architecture with a square plan. The original courtyard is two squares stacked next to each other, all mandapas, the upapitham, the shrine plans, the garbha griha (sanctum) and the tower elements are all square shaped and incorporate circles and principles of geometric symmetry. The structural elements resemble the big Brihadisvara Temple in Thanjavur. Both include a courtyard entered through multiple gateways and relatively small gopuram (tower). Inside are shrines, most of which are aligned on an east-west axis; a few are perpendicular. The temple complex includes Nandi Mandapa, Alankar Mandapa, Maha Mandapa, Mukha Mandapa and Ardha Mandapa. Some of these were added and restored by Hindu kingdoms after the 14th century or by British India art conservation officials in the 19th century. The visible upapitham measures 103.63 m (340.0 ft) long by 30.48 m (100.0 ft) with an east- west axis, but part of it is likely missing with the surviving foundation covered by soil and with a restored surface for tourism. On the visible part, states Balasubrahmanyam, the garbha griha (sanctum) is 30.48 m (100.0 ft) long, the maha mandapa (great hall) is 53.34 m (175.0 ft) long, and the ardha mandapa (partial hall) is 19.81 m (65.0 ft). The square-shaped ardha mandapa connects the sanctum and the great hall. The temple is one of the earliest ones to have pillared halls, which became a common feature in subsequent temples.] The main temple is built on an elevated structure with the courtyard measuring 560 ft (170 m) by 320 ft (98 m). Its sanctum measures 100 sq ft (9.3 m2 ) and is entered through the Ardha Mandapa. The sanctum doorway is flanked by dvarapalas, the guardians, each 6 ft (1.8 m) tall.\n\n52. Journal of the Indo Nordic Author’s Collective 52 The sanctum contains Brihadeeswarar (Shiva) in the form of lingam. This lingam is 4 m (13 ft) tall and the base has a circumference of 18 m (59 ft). There is an image of a seated Nandi bull in the courtyard, aligned axially 200 m (660 ft) facing the sanctum. There are five shrines around the sanctum and a Lion well, which was added during the 19th century. The temple site has a monolithic representation of Navagrahas, the nine planetary deities. Sri-vimana The vimanam (temple tower) is 55 m (180 ft) high, which is 3 m (9.8 ft) smaller than the Thanjavur Temple. Historians believe that the height of the temple is deliberately kept low in dimensions compared to the Thanjavur temple as a mark of respect of Rajendra to his father's masterpiece. Compared to the Thanjavur Temple, which has straight contours, this temple has a curvilinear contour, slightly concave towards the top. It is divided into eight zones. The tower rises as a vertical square structure to a height of 10.67 m (35.0 ft) above the adhisthanam. It has two horizontal bands with a massive cornice wrapped around it. Each band has five individual bays on the south, west and east sides with pilasters between the bays. The end bays are squares, the other three are oblong. The center bay of each set of five being the widest. On each side are carvings on the wall with four horizontal rows of friezes. These narrate Hindu legends and Puranic mythologies from the Shaiva, Vaishnava and Shakta traditions. Each storey has moulded horizontal projections (cornices) with floral arch-shaped motifs (gavaksha). According to Balasubrahmanyam, incorporated in the features are mythical creatures in the form of yali, and the entablature is decorated with necklace shaped motifs. Gangaikondacholapuram temple sculpture Ardhanarishvara (half Shiva, half Parvati) Harihara (half Shiva, half Vishnu) Saraswati Varaha avatar of Vishnu The Sri-vimana at Gangaikonda has nine storeys (talas) including those at the lower levels, in contrast to the thirteen storeys at Thanjavur.
