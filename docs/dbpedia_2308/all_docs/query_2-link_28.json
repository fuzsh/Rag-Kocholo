        "text": "Bhagavad Geeta Chapter 2 - Verse 18 अन्तवन्त इमे देहा नित्यस्योक्ताः शरीरिणः । अनाशिनोऽप्रमेयस्य तस्माद्युध्यस्व भारत ॥ २-१८॥ Only the material body of the indestructible, immeasurable and eternal living entity is subject to destruction; therefore, fight, O descendant of Bharata. Purport - The material body is perishable by nature. It may perish immediately, or it may do so after a hundred years. It is a question of time only. There is no chance of maintaining it indefinitely. But the spirit soul is so minute that it cannot even be seen by an enemy, to say nothing of being killed. As mentioned in the previous verse, it is so small that no one can have any idea how to measure its dimension. So from both viewpoints there is no cause of lamentation because the living entity can neither be killed as he is, nor can the material body, which cannot be saved for any length of time, be permanently protected. The minute particle of the whole spirit acquires this material body according to his work, and therefore observance of religious principles should be utilized. In the Vedānta-sūtras the living entity is qualified as light because he is part and parcel of the supreme light. As the Supreme Lord maintains the entire creation, so the light of the soul maintains this material body. As soon as the spirit soul is out of this material body, the body begins to decompose; therefore it is the spirit soul which maintains this body. The body itself is unimportant. Arjuna was advised to fight and sacrifice the material body for the cause of his duty. All the bodies which, are perceptible, are perishable, while the soul is imperishable and eternal. But this immortal soul, though different from body, identifies itself with the body and develops 'an ego' or 'I' ness with it, and thus regards its death, as the soul's death. He who identifies himself, with wealth and learning etc., calls himself as wealthy and learned etc. Similarly, when one accepts a body, as one's own, one develops the feeling of attachment or mine-ness for it, and this attachment, extends to wealth and family etc., because he accepts these as his own, by having affinity with these. By this affinity of 'I' ness and 'Mine-ness', all evils are born, one cannot discriminate, between the real and the unreal, and is thus grieved. While the wise are not grieved, because they realize that the Soul cannot perish and the body was never meant to last. Practicality - Any entity of this world is a part of the material creation. It is certainly meant to perish. So, all the bonds with such perishable entities are certainly meant to have an end sooner or later. So, the wise are those who realize this and develop detachment towards the entire creation. When the interest in any material activity subsides completely, the fourth order of life, automatically gets bestowed upon.\n\nIn the ongoing progression of technology over time, it is imperative that we harmonize our intellectual development with a profound understanding of the past, enabling us to contemplate the future with greater insight. While the prevalent mantra often encourages us to 'let go' of our past and unceasingly push forward in life, it is essential to recognize that the events of tomorrow are intrinsically linked to the events of the past—a concealed, infinite loop akin to the symbol of eternity. In the present moment, we find ourselves at the nexus where we must diligently undertake the actions required to sustain this equilibrium. Time, in its continual illusion, should not be restricted to the physical realm of birth, life, and death but, conversely, should be regarded as a metaphysical dimension awaiting exploration through the convergence of the finest elements of science, spirituality, and even the introspective effects of psychedelics. It would be remiss to dismiss the disciplined and unconventional paths pursued by spiritual luminaries. Equally, it would be shortsighted to underestimate the value of their practices in our own lives and our approach to living this existence. The concept of a higher power, often referred to as 'God,' may be enigmatic, yet it would be fallacious to dismiss it entirely. Likewise, it would be futile to disregard the indelible marks left on Earth by the sacrifices and choices of individuals ranging from leaders, saints, and gurus to deities, travelers, messengers, and entire civilizations. Such reflections often lead me to ponder deeply. In a brief but enriching experience, I had the privilege of acquainting myself with the royal family of Indore and collaborating with them on several occasions. In this regard, I have crafted a blog that delves into the legacy of Devi Ahilya Bai, which I would like to share.\" https://lnkd.in/dmMh9Yzf #royalfamily #indore #spiritualawakening #history #india #contentwriting #deepthoughts #metaphysics #psychedelicresearch #ahilyabai #indianhistory #blogs #digitalohm\n\n#WordForTodayDevotional Saturday May 25, 2024 HOW TO RECOGNIZE THIS WISDOM (6): WITHOUT PARTIALITY But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, … James 3:17 (KJV) Acting without partiality is a hard thing to do, but it is a godly thing and therefore worth doing. Part of growing to have the “wisdom that is from above” involves setting aside our automatic human reactions to situations and replacing them with how Yahweh would react. Before we start looking at how we’re to be impartial, it’s important to note that Yahweh doesn’t show partiality regarding whom He blesses with wisdom. James writes, “if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him.” If you meet the basic requirements — seek Elohim and ask in faith (see James 1:5-6) — then Elohim will give wisdom regardless of your age, background, ethnicity, status, ability, etc. He is not a “respecter of persons” who shows favouritism or twists His rules based on who someone is (see Deut. 10:17; 2 Chronicles 19:7; Acts 10:34). This is very grave when we consider what I Peter 1:15-17 says, “15 But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation? 16 Because it is written, Be ye holy? for I am holy. 17 And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man’s work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear:” You only endear yourself to the Lord when you work according to His Word. Part of becoming holy is learning to be like God, and one of the ways He operates is without showing favouritism. If we respect Him as Father, then we should know Him as impartial judge and respect Him by living in reverent fear. Interestingly, this sort of fear is called “the beginning of wisdom” (see Ps. 111:10; Prov. 9:10, see also Prov. 15:33; Is. 33:6). Shortly before telling us the wisdom from above is “without partiality,” James gives us one example of what ungodly partiality looks like. James 2:1-4 says, “1 My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons. 2 For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment? 3 And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place? and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool: 4 Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?” When we show partiality we separate, make distinction, discriminate, and prefer one thing or person over another. That’s what diakrino means (G1252, Thayer’s dictionary definition). In contrast, wisdom is adiakritos — without diakrino (G87) PLEASE READ FULL DEVOTIONAL HERE: https://lnkd.in/gZPfB6YY\n\nColossians 3:5-7 (NKJV) 5 Therefore put to death your members which are on the earth: fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry. 6 Because of these things the wrath of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience, 7 in which you yourselves once walked when you lived in them. This is a violent passage of Scripture, a passage that attacks many persons right where they are living. But it is a passage that is desperately needed by us all. It covers the violent demands of the believer's new life in Christ. The first demand is violent—put to death the sins that enslave the body and its members. The word \"mortify\" means to put to death or to act as though the body is dead. The believer is to take the various parts of his body and put them to death in so far as sin is concerned. How does a believer do this? He considers his body to be hid in the death of Christ. He acts as though his body is dead with Christ. And remember: a dead man cannot sin; a dead man can do nothing. Therefore, the believer is dead to sin. The point is this: it is all an act of the mind or spirit. A person wants to live for God; therefore, he looks at his body and at sin. The only way he can possibly conquer sin is to treat his body as dead to sin or to consider sin as dead to his body. The person has to live as though his body has no part in sin, and sin has no part in his body. But note: this life is possible only in Christ. Christ alone—through the Holy Spirit—can work within the human heart and give it the energy and power to conquer sin permanently and eternally. Some men can discipline themselves to overcome some sin, but not all sin, not permanently and not eternally. This can be done only through Christ. There is an enormous difference between human discipline and godly control, and that difference is Jesus Christ. What sins are to be mortified or put to death? The Bible is very specific, for there are some very specific sins which tend to enslave the human body. In fact, note the term \"children of disobedience\" (Col. 3:6). These particular sins are not only terrible acts of disobedience to God, they are sins that can enslave the human body so much that they make a child of disobedience out of a person. They cause a person to actually become a child of disobedience. Shocking! 1. What are the sins that enslave the human body so much? a. There is the sin of fornication: (Galatians 5:19-21). b. There is the sin of uncleanness: (Galatians 5:19-21). c. There is the sin of inordinate affection: passion, craving, strong desire, intense arousal, a driving lust. It is, of course, a desire and craving for the wrong things such as the second and third helping of food, alcohol, drugs, nudity, pornography, suggestive and filthy literature, illicit affairs, extra-marital sex, etc. Preacher's Outline and Sermon Bible - Commentary\n\nJune 3, 2024 The Healing Ministry of Jesus “When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick: That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.” (Matthew 8:16-17) The earthly healing ministries of Jesus are here said to have fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah 53:4: “Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows.” The Hebrew words used do allow this New Testament application, so this passage does, indeed, predict the healing work of the Messiah in His earthly ministry. Isaiah 53:5-6 then predicts the substitutionary atoning work of the Messiah, concluding with the statement: “The LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.” The order is important. The healing ministry preceded the atonement, just as the prophecy of healing preceded the prophecy of Christ’s atoning work. This means that particular healings cannot be a part of the atonement itself. The reason for the earthly healing work of Christ was “that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins” (Matthew 9:6). The saving work of Christ includes deliverance from the death penalty for sin in one’s past life, the power of sin in this present life, and the very presence of sin in the future life. Our great salvation has already delivered us from the eternal torments of the second death (Revelation 20:14; 21:8), from the defeating power of physical infirmities in our present bodies, and from the very presence of sickness and pain in the future. In any case, there is no question that God is well able in particular situations right now either to provide direct healing in answer to prayer or sufficient grace to meet whatever physical need we have in a way that honors Him (2 Corinthians 12:7-9).
