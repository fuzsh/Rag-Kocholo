        "text": "Saiva siddhantham speaks of four steps in spiritual progress. They are Sarya(work to others) Kriya,Yoga,and Gnana. These four saiva Acharyas, Thirunavukkarasar (Appar), Thirugnanasambandhar, Sundharar, Manickavasagar, are supposed to represent these four methods.The Thevaram and Thiruvasagam which comprise the first eight books of the Thirumurai constitue the bedrock of saivism. The lives of the four great Acharys form part of their songs and consititute a unified lesson and inspiration for the saivites and their philosphy.\n\nThirunavukkarasar (Appar)\n\nHis songs are mellow, didactic and delicately emotional. He is humble and his attitude to god is that of a servant to his master. He also gives a new orientation to hinduism by laying emphasis on service to god and fellowmen. My duty is to serve is his motto. Thirunavukkarasar and his divotees renovates the many sivan temples, that team is called \"uzhavara padai\". Thirunavukkarasar (Appar) was the great example for Sarya bakthi.\n\nThirugnanasambandhar\n\nHe is a boysaint, He takes some liberties with his father(siva). He takes delight in music. He sees god in nature and fine arts. Thirugnanasambandhar was the great example for Kriya bakthi.\n\nSundhararmoorthy Nayanar\n\nHe was very much of this world,having two wives and having luxurious life.But he never forgotten the lord,whom he considered as his friend and on whom he depend for every kind of help. Sundhararmoorthy Nayanar was the great example for yoga bakthi.\n\nManickavasagar\n\nHe was unique in many respects. His highly emotional love for god and the urgency shown by him for union with him is comparable to the love between the lovers. Manickavasagar was the great example for Gnana bakthi."
