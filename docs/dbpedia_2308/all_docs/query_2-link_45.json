        "text": "This series tends to bring to notice the extraordinary lives of 63 Nayanars, the glorious Shiva devotees. The Nayanars are quite celebrated in the southern part of India but somehow lack their presence in the north. My intention behind this series is to help Shiva devotees like myself deepen their devotion and reach Shiva with the grace of devotees such as the Nayanars.\n\nIf you haven’t read the first part, you can read it here.\n\nA Short Introduction:\n\nIn the sixth and eighth centuries, a group of devoted followers of Lord Shiva lived in ancient Tamil Nadu, India. They were known as the 63 Nayanars. They were men and women from various social classes and origins who came from various regions of Tamil society. The word “Nayanar” means “devotee” in Tamil, and these people — often via poetry and selfless service — showed an unbroken love, devotion, and dedication to Lord Shiva. Their songs, called “Thevarams,” are essential to Tamil Shaivism and powerfully portray their profound spiritual experiences. Their shared commitment cut over social boundaries, highlighting the idea that love for the holy is limitless and that devotion is universal.\n\n(AO in the passage means Ashutosh Om)\n\nAmarneeti Nayanar\n\nAmarneeti Nayanar was born at Pazhaiyarai in the Chola kingdom. He served the devotees of Lord Siva giving them towels and loincloths as gifts. Once, Lord Siva came to him in the form of a devotee and gave a loincloth for safekeeping. After bathing in the river Kaveri, the devotee asked Nayanar to return his loincloth. Amarneeti found the cloth missing. He offered to compensate the loss but neither a new loincloth nor his family jewels and all his belongings could tilt the balance favourably when they were placed on the weighing scales. Finally, Amarneeti sat on one plate of the scales along with his whole family and both the plates got balanced on account of his devotion. By the grace of Lord Siva, the weighing scales then became a flying chariot and took Nayanar and his family to the abode of Lord Siva.\n\nSadhanaByAO- We should learn that doesn’t matter how many offerings and rituals we make in the glory of the lord. Nothing will work until we have complete surrender at the feet of the lord, the grace of the devotees and until we offer ourselves including what we call our’s to the lord and dissolve in him. Kailasha (abode of Shiva) is just a dream.\n\nYeripattha Nayanar\n\nYeripattha Nayanar was born in Karuvoor in the Chola kingdom. He always carried an axe in his hands to protect the devotees of Lord Siva. Once, the royal elephant attacked Sivakamiyandar, a devotee of Lord Siva, while carrying flowers to the temple. Nayanar cut the trunk of the elephant and also the mahouts who failed to control the elephant. When King Pugazh Cholan heard about the incident, he owned responsibility for the elephant’s deed as the king. Then he gave his sword to Nayanar and asked for punishment. Nayanar, who knew that the king was a devotee of Lord Siva, tried to cut his own throat with the sword. The king stopped him. The elephant and the mahouts were resurrected by the grace of Lord Siva. Yeripattha Nayanar was made the chief of the attendants of the Lord in His abode Kailash.\n\nSadhanaByAO- We should protect Shiava Dharma and Devotees, no matter what. Serving the devotees of Shiva is equivalent to serving Shiva himself. We also get a message that spiritual examination is crucial and can happen at any moment, hence we should conduct ourselves with wisdom and devotion, holding our principles firmly.\n\nYenatinatha Nayanar\n\nYenatinatha Nayanar was born near Kumbakonam. His profession was training the soldiers in sword fight. He had great devotion for Lord Siva. Another trainer Athisooran became jealous of Nayanar and tried to defeat him many a time in single combat but failed. Hence, he plotted a cunning scheme. He then invited Nayanar for a single combat and fought with him hiding his forehead on which he put on the sacred ash with his shield. When both came very close to each other during the combat, Athisooran suddenly removed his shield and exposed his forehead. When Nayanar noticed the sacred ash, he did not press for a victory and let the enemy prevail over him. Athisooran thrust his sword into Nayanar’s body and killed him. Yenatinatha Nayanar thus attained Lord Siva’s holy feet.\n\nSadhanaByAO- Yenatinatha’s life teaches us the importance of Sacred ash and as the Shiva Purana says the Person who applies sacred ash is regarded as Shiva himself. He portrays the true essence of Shaiva Dharma and its principles. His life is an example that devotees are beyond logic and regard of ‘Meipporul’, the sacred insignia of Saivism viz., Rudhraksha, sacred ash is itself a path to Shiva and his glory.\n\nKannappa Nayanar\n\nThinnan was the son of hunter-king Nagan. He would carry water in his mouth and flowers on his head to worship Lord Kudumi Devar who resided in the form of a Sivalinga. Before offering the meat to the Lord, he would taste it first to offer the best part of it. Lord Siva wished to make the devotion of Thinnan known to the world and caused one of the eyes on the Sivalinga to bleed. Thinnan plucked his own eye and replaced the damaged eye. Then the other eye on the Sivalinga started bleeding. Overwhelmed with devotion, Thinnan placed his leg near the bleeding eye to mark the place and attempted to remove his other eye too with an arrow. Lord Siva held his hands uttering, ‘Stop Kannappa.’ Thus Thinnan, who received Lord Siva’s grace in six days through intense devotion, became Kannappa Nayanar.\n\nSadhanaByAO- This is for sure beyond logic. There is nothing pure or impure when we reside in Shiva Tatwa (the essence of Shiva) and are Shivamayi (Witness everyone as Shiva as he resides within all). This portrays exceptional surrender which can only developed with daily and consistent sadhana. Only we the heart is cleansed, the truth shines in full glory. His love for Shiva is exceptional, devotion to Shiva is our only true wealth. If manage to develop even a percent of what Kannappa had, we shall be fortunate.\n\nKungiliyakkalaya Nayanar\n\nKungiliyakkalaya Nayanar offered incense everyday to Lord Amrutaghatesvar at Tirukkadaiyoor. Lord Siva made him poor in order to test him. One day, there was no rice in his house. To buy some, Nayanar’s wife gave him her ‘Mangala Sutra’ for selling. On the way, Nayanar saw a trader selling incense. He exchanged the ‘Mangala Sutra’ for the incense and went straight to the temple. Pleased with his devotion, Lord Siva bestowed great wealth upon him. Once at Tiruppanandal, Lord Siva bent His head to receive a garland from a woman devotee and remained so from then onwards. The Chola king tried his best to straighten the Sivalinga but in vain. Nayanar went and tied one end of a silk rope around it and the other end around his neck and pulled. Lord Siva yielded to his love and the Sivalinga got straightened.\n\nSadhanaByAO- There is a principle which says that, if a person does the ritual for 12 years without even a single break, he shall have the lord’s vision. The ritual can be as small as offering some water on a linga or offering a flower or a bilva leaf to Shiva. Devotees never worry or care about themselves, the only thing that they care about is their Lord, they can cross all boundaries to serve the Lord. Even if they have to starve and die for the lord. The intensity and love of these saints is unparalleled. We should apply their actions and teachings in our lives, however bizarre they may sound. Devotion is a personal affair between you and the lord.\n\nManakkanjara Nayanar\n\nManakkanjara Nayanar lived in a place called Kanchanoor. He made arrangements for his daughter’s wedding with Yeyarkon Kalikkamar. On the day of the wedding, Lord Siva visited Nayanar’s house in the guise of a Sadhu belonging to a particular sect of North India. Manakkanjara Nayanar asked his daughter to prostrate before him. The Sadhu noticed her beautiful and long plaited hair. He asked for it to make a broad sacred thread called Panchavadi for his use. Without showing any hesitation, Nayanar cut off her hair immediately and gave it to the Sadhu. Thus Lord Siva made Manakkanjara Nayanar’s devotion known to the world and blessed him. By His grace, Nayanar’s daughter also regained her beautiful hair and the marriage took place on a grand scale.\n\nSadhanaByAO- The Lord can test us at any place and at any moment. Our devotion should be intense and our service towards the devotees of Shiva should be firm. Detachment or Vairagya is the key to excel in the spiritual realm.\n\nI will talk about other Nayanars in a batch of 5 or 6 in my upcoming posts. So that we can apply their life teachings and deepen our devotion.\n\nMay Shiva Bless us with his Devotion.\n\nHonourable Mention: Sri Ramakrishna Math, Mylapore, Chennai for reference text.\n\nHope this flicks a switch in you and gives birth to realisation.\n\nI offer my obeisance to the divine in you.\n\nHar Har Mahadev,\n\nAlakh Niranjan, Adesh.\n\nAshutosh Om."
