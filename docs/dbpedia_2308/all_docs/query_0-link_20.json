Saint Manickavasagar, them heading the cabinet of Pandya king, came to this place Tiruperundurai, now Avudayar Kovil to buy horses. He heard the sound of \"Shivagama mantras there and saw a guru sitting there. The Prime minister fell at the feet of the lord and begged him to teach him wisdom. While learning, Manickavasagar plunged into deep meditation when he opened his eyes, he found his teacher absent in the place and understood that his guru was none other than Shiva himself.\" 1"
