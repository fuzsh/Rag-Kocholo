Karuvurar Siddhar, of Karur, one of the 18 famous Siddhars of South India, has praised the Lord in his hymns “Thiruvisaippa”, which forms a part of the 9th Thirumurai. Out of jealousy, some Brahmins complained against Karuvurar Siddhar to the king that the Siddhar was following the Vama Margam - offering wine and meat to the Lord. Upon enquiry it was found this complaint was baseless and the king punished the complainants. However, unable to bear the continual harassment, he ran towards the shrine, embraced and became unified with the Lord Ahnilaiyappar. Because of his embracement, the Lingam is found in a slanting position. Inside the temple, there is a Jeeva Samathi of Karuvurar Siddhar. Moolavar: Sri Kalyana Pasupatheeswarar / Sri Ahnilaiyappar /Sri Pasupathy Nathar; Ambal: 1. Sri Soundyarya Nayaki (Vadivudaiyal) 2. Sri Alangara Nayaki; Theertham: Brahma Theertham, Thadaagai Theertham, Ambiravathi-Amaravathi River; Sthala Vriksham: Vanji. The temple is very big - its Rajagopuram 7-tiers facing East. The Moolavar Lingam is a Swayambumurthi (self-manifested). As per legend, Lord Brahmma became proud of his position as Creator of the world. To teach him a lesson, Lord Shiva made divine cow Kamadenu come to Earth through Narada to perform penance on Him in this place, a forest of Vanji trees then. As per instructions, Kamadenu was pouring its milk on Lord in the anthill. Lord told Kamadenu that He would be worshipped as Pasupathi Nathar as the cow (Kamadenu) worshipped Him and that Kamadenu would do the creation work. Kamadenu began the job that wiped of the pride of Brahmma. Merciful Lord returned the creation job to Brahmma then and took Kamadenu with Him. As per another legend, Emperor Musukunda, belonging to the Skanda Mahapurana period, undertook renovation of this temple. As per another legend, Eripatha Nayanar, a staunch worshipper of Lord Pasupatheesvarar, would always carry a weapon - an axe, to protect Shiva devotees. Once the king’s elephant wrenched the basket of flowers from Sivakami Andar, - a Shiva devotee and destroyed them .Sivakami Andar started crying ; Eripatha Nayanar happened to pass that way and became furious that an elephant had caused an aged Shiva devotee such distress. He hurled his powerful axe and killed it. He also killed the Mahouts since the Mohouts failed to controll the elephant. On hearing the news King Pugazh Cholan (staunch Shiva devotee) reached the spot .He requested Eripathar to kill him with his own sword as he took moral responsibility. . Moved by the King’s devotion to the Lord and fearing that he might have caused distress to the King - another Shiva devotee, Eripathar wanted to punish himself and he began to cut his own throat. Alarmed, the king grabbed the sword and stopped him. At this point ,Lord restored the elephant and Mahout back to life and intimated thatHe wanted the world to know the greatness of Eripathar As per another legend, Vadivudaiyal who was born in a place called Appipalayam (near Karur), was devoted to Lord Pasupatheeswarar and wanted to marry him. She worshiped the Lord faithfully and her parents could not dissuade her from what they felt was a foolish dream. However,she merged with Lord and re-christened as Soundarya Nayaki. Must have darshan.\n\n3 people found this review helpful 👍\n\n5/5 Takuya K. 5 months ago on Google • 38 reviews\n\nEven if I don't know much about Hinduism, I feel like my heart has been purified.
