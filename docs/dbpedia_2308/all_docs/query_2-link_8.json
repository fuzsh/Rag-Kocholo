        "text": "O rain clouds\n\nseeming like dark clay outside\n\nliquid wax within,\n\nrain down upon Venkatam\n\nwhere the handsome lord dwells.\n\nHelp me to find within me\n\nmy beloved.\n\nWhen he folds me in close embrace\n\nmelts my heart.\n\nThen rain down upon us.\n\n(Translation by Vidya Dehejia)\n\nThese are the words of a teenage Tamil girl, Kothai, who lived 1,300 years ago. She was no ordinary girl. She was in love with Lord Vishnu and refused to wed any mortal man. Centuries before the 16th-century Bhakti poet-saint and devotee of Lord Krishna Mirabai, she composed songs reflecting her deep longing for god.\n\nThe legend goes that her father, a priest at the Vatapatrasayi Vishnu temple at Srivilliputhur, 80 km from Madurai, once caught her wearing the garland prepared for the God’s idol, and severely chastised her. Kothai was pretending to be the Lord’s bride. But her devotion, or rather passion, was so strong that when she was about 16, Vishnu appeared in a dream to her father and conveyed his willingness to accept Kothai as his wife. A wedding procession was arranged from Srivilliputhur to the Ranganathaswamy Temple in Srirangam. Here, upon entering the garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum), Kothai merged with the idol of her God.\n\nKothai, popularly known as Andal, is a legendary figure in South India. She is the only woman in the group of 12 Vaishnavite poet-saints called ‘Alwars’. Their counterparts, the 63 Shaivite poet-saints, are called ‘Nayanars’. They all existed in different time periods (mostly between the 6th and 9th centuries CE) and came from different social backgrounds. But what connects them is that they all became the earliest proponents of the Bhakti Movement, a new wave that celebrated a person’s personal connection with God.\n\n– It is very difficult to translate what Bhakti means. Derived from the Sanskrit word ‘bhaj’, which means to ‘to worship’ or ‘to revere’, the movement promoted an intimate relationship with a personal God, an intense love for the chosen deity.\n\nThis was a far cry from the prevalent orthodox Vedic faith, based on ritualistic stipulations and hierarchies.\n\nTo understand the origin of the movement, it is important to know the context in which it emerged. In Tamilakam, the area covering present-day Tamil Nadu and Kerala, a base for Buddhism had already been built in the 2nd century BCE. Pandit Hisselle Dharmaratana Maha Thera, in his book Buddhism In South India (1968), says that there is evidence that Mauryan Emperor Ashoka’s son, Mahinda, on his way to Sri Lanka, stopped in present-day Tamil Nadu and preached the Dhamma. In the 3rd century CE, with the end of the Sangam period, the curtain also fell on the influence of the Vedic religion in the region.\n\nThe Invasion of the Kalabhras\n\nThis was the time when a wave of ‘invaders’, the Kalabhras, made their way from beyond the northern boundaries of Tamilakam, to take over the once-prosperous city of Madurai. These invaders defeated a succession of princes from the ruling dynasties of the South, the Sangam-era Cholas, Cheras and Pandyas, who had dominated the land for centuries.\n\nAccording to historian Indira Vishwanathan Peterson, in her work Sramanas Against The Tamil Way – Jains As Others In Tamil Saiva Literature (1998), points to the fact that the Kalabhras likely patronised the Sramana religions (Buddhism, Jainism, Ajivikas), more particularly, the Digambara sect of Jainism. Under their patronage, Jain scholars formed an academy in Madurai and wrote texts in Sanskrit, Pali, Prakrit and Tamil.\n\nTwo of the most remarkable post-Sangam epics, the Manimekalai and the Silappatikaram, also have clear Jain leanings. Besides, the Jain monks coming South from the Deccan must have also found a place in other royal courts and we have references to the early Pandya and Pallava rulers being Jain.\n\n– However, the practitioners of the Vedic-Puranic religion saw Buddhism and Jainism as alien to Tamil culture and a threat to their Tamil ‘roots’.\n\nBhakti was a grassroots-led reaction to this, pioneered by poet-saints who propagated the ‘back to the soil’ movement. These saints were champions of what later came to be known as the Hindu tradition and travelled from village to village singing songs of devotion to Shiva and Vishnu and their multiple avatars.\n\nThese songs were not in Sanskrit, but in Tamil, and set to melodies already prevalent among the people, making them accessible to the masses. The saints came from all walks of life and also drew their followers from every section of society, cutting across caste, class, gender and other hierarchies. They went from temple to temple and embodied the idea that before God, everyone is equal.\n\nAnd thus, with the origin of the Bhakti Movement, Indian society and its literature entered a new phase of evolution.\n\nBhakti Literature\n\nHistorian Burton Stein notes in his Peasant, State And Society in Medieval South India (1980) that the Bhakti Movement was a social reaction to the town-based and mercantile society of Jains and Buddhists. It may be seen as an expression of the largely rural population with emphasis on agriculture.\n\nEvening has come,\n\nbut not the Dark One.\n\nthe bulls,\n\ntheir bells jingling,\n\nhave mated with the cows\n\nand the cows are frisky.\n\nThe flutes play cruel songs,\n\nbees flutter in their bright\n\nwhite jasmine\n\nand the blue-black lily.\n\nThe sea leaps into the sky\n\nand cries aloud.\n\nWithout him here,\n\nwhat shall I say?\n\nhow shall I survive?\n\n(Translation by A K Ramanujan)\n\nThis is a verse by the Alwar saint Nammalvar, who is believed to have been born into a lower caste family. The poems by the Vaishnava saints were compiled by a theologian named Nathamuni in a text called Naalayira Divya Prabhandham in the 9th-10th centuries CE. It contained 4,000 verses in praise of Vishnu. Similarly, the compilation of Nayanar poetry and literature is called Tirumurai. It comprises 18,426 songs dedicated to Shiva.\n\nProbably the most popular Nayanar saint, Appar, is credited with converting the great Jain Pallava ruler, Mahendravarman I (r.c. 600-630 CE), back to Shaivism. Interestingly, it is believed that Appar, who was raised by his Shaivite older sister, had left home and joined a Jain monastery in Tiruppatirippuliyur (in present-day Cuddalore, Tamil Nadu). But he returned home within a few years due to a painful stomach illness.\n\nAs a cure, his sister gave him Tiruneeru (sacred ash) and the five syllable mantra ‘namaccivaya’ (Namah Shivaya). They also visited the Shiva temple in Atikai, where Appar is said to have spontaneously composed his first hymn of Tevaram. As he sang the second verse, he was miraculously cured of his stomach ailment. The story goes that that was when Appar renounced Jainism and became a devout Shaiva.\n\nTevaram is a collection of works composed by Nayanar saints Appar, Sambandar and Sundarar. Partly hagiographies, these works talk of devotion leading to miracles. But these saints also write of cruelty imposed upon them by Buddhists and Jains.\n\nThose Buddhists and mad Jains may slander speak.\n\nSuch speech befits the wand’rers from the way.\n\nBut He who came to earth and begged for alms,\n\nHe is the thief who stole my heart away.\n\nThe raging elephant charged down at Him;\n\nO marvel! He but took and wore its hide;\n\nMadman men think Him, but He is the Lord\n\nWho in great Bramāpuram doth abide.\n\n(Translation from Hymns of the Tamil Saivite Saints by F Kingsbury and G P Phillips, 1921)\n\nThis is a verse by Sambandar, a child prodigy said to have mastered the Vedas by the age of three.\n\nAmerican Indologist John E Cort, in his book Open Boundaries: Jain Communities and Culture in Indian History (1998), writes that the hymns of Sambandar include criticism and allegations of persecution of the Shaiva community by Jain monks, along with a ‘bitter anti-Jain polemic.’ However, no historical evidence supports his allegation. So, such verses need to be seen against a background of a conflict of ideas, rivalry with non-orthodox sects and competition for royal patronage.\n\n– Although it might be difficult to separate fact and legend from the verses of these Bhakti saints, their literature provides a valuable window into the history and culture of the Tamil land of the period. They give us names of villages, crops grown, temple rituals, trade, music, etc. which modern historians may not find in inscriptions.\n\nAn important feature of the Tamil Bhakti was the institutionalisation of religion with temple worship. This point is supported by the significance given to the 108 divyadesams (holy places related to Vishnu) in the hymns of the Alwars.\n\nHistorian and social scientist Radha Champakalakshmi in her paper on Tamil Bhakti saints, titled From Devotion and Dissent to Dominance, writes, “The emphasis in Bhakti literature on ritual worship as highly meritorious and the temple as the house of god and the iconographic descriptions of the Puranic deities are closely related to the teaching and ethos of the Agama and Tantra…”\n\nTidal Wave of Devotion\n\nOver the next few centuries, this ripple of religious fervour which started in Tamil Nadu, turned into a tidal wave that spread as far north as Punjab. First, the Bhakti Movement spread north to Karnataka in the 12th century through the works of Basavanna (1105-68 CE) and then to Maharashtra in 13th century CE, through the Varkari movement.\n\nThe greatest text of the Bhakti Movement in Maharashtra was the Dnyaneshwari, which was a commentary on the Bhagavad Gita by saint Dnyaneshwar (1275-1296 CE). This was revolutionary as till then, Bhagavad Gita, written in Sanskrit, was out of reach for most common people. The Bhakti Movement unleashed a wave of translations of religious literature in regional languages, from Kannada and Marathi to Maithili, Awadhi, Bhojpuri and Punjabi.\n\nOn its way northwards, the movement even took a different face. Indira Peterson, in her book, Poems to Siva: The Hymns of the Tamil Saints (2007), points out that the Tamil Bhakti movement saw itself as a champion of Vedic-Puranic traditions and communal solidarity against the dominance of Buddhism and Jainism. This was in contrast to the Bhakti movements in northern India, which were a reaction to Hindu orthodoxy and a form of social protest. In the North, the Bhakti Movement was quite critical of the Brahmin orthodoxy and the rigid caste system.\n\nThese saints transformed society and left behind a lasting legacy. Art Historian Vidya Dehejia writes in her Antal and Her Path of Love (1990), “The saints of South India acquired a position of such great eminence that a cult arose around them. Bronze sculptures of both Nayanars and Alvars were commissioned by every temple for placement in the innermost courtyard beside the sanctum sanctorum.” In fact, the Alwars came to be considered as amsas or secondary incarnations of Vishnu’s companions and his attributes. Andal was regarded as an amsa of Vishnu’s second consort Bhudevi, the Goddess Earth.\n\nEven today, after centuries, the devotional hymns and poems of these saints are a part of the temple liturgy. They are often sung on special occasions across South India.\n\nWhy bathe in Ganga's stream, or Kaviri?\n\nWhy go to Comorin in Kongu's land?\n\nWhy seek the waters of the sounding sea?\n\nRelease is theirs, and theirs alone, who call\n\nIn every place upon the Lord of all.\n\n(Hymn by Appar, translation by F Kingsbury and G P Phillips)\n\nThis article is part of our ‘The History of India’ series, where we focus on bringing alive the many interesting events, ideas, people and pivots that shaped us and the Indian subcontinent.
