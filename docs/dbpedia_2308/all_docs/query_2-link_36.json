Dorai Rangaswamy | 1958 | 410,072 words\n\nSummary: This work deals with the poems of Nampi Arurar (also known as Sundarar), one of three Thevaram (Tevaram) Saints in Tamil Saivism. The 7th-century Thevaram is a collection of devotional poems of Shiva and represents the first seven volumes of the Tirumurai.\n\nAccording to Sundarar himself, his poems contain the quintessence of his predecessors, named Campantar (or, Sambandar) and Tirunavukkaracar (or, Appar).\n\n[Note: The proofreading is not yet verified so transcription errors are not impossible. Transliteration in this book may also differ from modern syntax. For example, Thevaram = Tevaram and Thiruvarur = Tiruvarur]"
