        "text": "Masilamaneeswarar Temple, Thiruvaduthurai – Legends\n\nGomuktheeswarar:\n\nOnce, Lord Shiva and Mother Parvathi were playing the game of dice in Kailash. Lord Shiva purposely made goddess Parvathy to win each game. Overwhelmed with the joy, she become arrogant and had excessive pride in her success. On seeing her arrogance, Lord Shiva cursed to be born as a cow on earth. She was born as a cow in Therazhundur and Lord Vishnu became her cowherd. She in the form of cow worshipped Lord Shiva at Thirukozhambam.\n\nShe hit the Shiva Linga mistakenly and its hoof mark can be seen on the Linga at Thirukozhambam. Goddess Parvathy in the form of cow came to Thiruvaduthurai and worshipped Lord Shiva for relief. Pleased with her worship, Lord Shiva restored her back to original form. As goddess Parvati worshipped Lord Shiva here in the form the cow, the place came to be called as Thiruvavaduthurai (Thiru means a respectful prefix, Aa means cow and Thurai means river bank).\n\nAs Lord Shiva restored her back to original form from cow form, he came to be called as Gomuktheeswarar (Go means cow, Mukthi means relief & Eswarar means Lord Shiva). Goddess Parvathy also wanted to marry Lord Shiva in an earthly marriage with all religious rites on the earth. At the same time, Sage Bharatha performed Putra Kameshti Yagna at Thiruthuruthi for child boon.\n\nIn order to fulfill her wish, Lord Shiva made goddess Parvathy to appear in the form of child from the Yagna Kunda. Sage Bharatha raised her as his own daughter. When she attained the marriageable age, the sage was worried about finding a suitable groom for her. Sage Bharatha prayed to Lord Shiva in finding a suitable groom for her. Lord Shiva appeared in his dream and assured him that he would marry her and also revealed to the sage that she is none other than Goddess Parvathy.\n\nSage Bharatha was overwhelmed with joy and made the arrangements for the divine marriage. Sage Bharatha received his son in law at Ethirkolpadi. The Yagna (Velvi) for the wedding ceremony was held at Thiruvelvikudi. The earthly marriage of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvathy took place in Thiruvelvikudi. The divine couple came after their wedding to Thirumanancheri and granted their wedding darshan to everyone at Thirumanancheri.\n\nThirumoolar:\n\nTirumular originally known as Sundaranathar was a Tamil Shaivite mystic and writer, considered one of the sixty-three Nayanmars and one of the 18 Siddhars. His main work, Thirumandiram consists of over 3000 verses, forms a part of the key text of the Tamil Shaiva Siddhanta, the Thirumurai. Verse 74 of the Thirumandiram makes the claim that Tirumular lived for 7 Yugams before composing the Thirumandiram.\n\nHe probably belonged to the beginning of the eighth-century CE. Sundaranathar, as the saint is known, was a Yogi originally from Then Madurai (currently Madurai) who travelled to Mount Kailasha and was initiated directly by Lord Shiva’s chief attendant Nandi. Lord Shiva favored him completely. After imparting all the knowledge, Nandi directed him to move to South.\n\nHe undertook a journey to meet his contemporary sage friend Agasthya in Podhigai Hills. After having darshan in various temples, finally he reached the Kaveri delta and had darshan at Thiruvavaduthurai. After darshan, while he was walking near Sathanur village, he saw a group of cows shedding tears near the dead body of the cowherd, Moolan. He took pity on the plight of the cows.\n\nUsing his spiritual powers, he separated his physical body from life and kept the body in a bush. He then entered the dead body of Moolan (In Tamil it is called Koodu Vittu Koodu Payudal or Parakaya Pravesam). Due to this, Moolan got up as if he was awakened from his slumber. The cows rejoiced after seeing their keeper alive. Moolan brought the cows back home. On his arrival, Moolan’s wife tried to touch him.\n\nSundaranathar told her the entire story of his entering Moolan’s body. When the villagers did not believe him, he made a demonstration by entering into the body of a dead goat and then re-entering Moolan’s body. The villagers realized that they were in the presence of a great saint. The Yogi went back to the place where he had hidden his original body. To his surprise, he could not find it there.\n\nHe then went into a trance and realized that his entering Moolan’s body is also one of the commands of the Lord. Lord Shiva appeared before him and he was ordered to write the Saivite philosophy and the rules for proper living in simple Tamil, so that everyone could understand and follow. Hence this place became an important pilgrimage centre to celebrate the conversion of uneducated Moolan into the revered Thirumoolar.\n\nHe was deeply immersed in meditation under a Peepal tree in Thiruvavaduthurai and received the holy hymn verse in Tamil. 3000 of holy hymns have been documented in to the book called Thirumandiram. After completion of his work, Shri Thirumoolar returned to Kailash. Today, there are 3,047 hymns are available in Thirumandiram. Possibly, 47 hymns might have been added later on. Apart from being part of the 18 Siddha group, he is also revered as one of the 63 Nayanmars.\n\nLord Shiva gifted bag of gold coins to Sambandar for conducting a Yagna:\n\nSaint Tirugnanasambandar was staying in this place for a while with his father, Shivapada Hrudayar. Shivapada Hrudayar wanted to perform a yajna in Sirkazhi and requested his son to fund him for conducting the Yagna. Sambandar sang a pathigam of ten verses praying to Lord Shiva for gold and other materials needed for the yajna. Lord Shiva placed a bag of 1000 gold coins on the Balipeedam through his Bhoodaganas.\n\nThe Bhoodaganas informed Sambandar that this bag will forever remain filled with gold. Sambandar gave the bag to his father to conduct the Yajna. The Balipeedam can still be seen in the temple surrounded by idols of the Boodhaganas. It is believed that worshiping the Lord Shiva from this place in the temple would bring prosperity and wealth to devotees.\n\nIt is also believed that while taking the purse from the Balipeedam, Sambandar could smell a pleasant scent and he called it as Tamil Manam (Manam means Smell in Tamil). He realized that something might have been hidden under the Balipeedam. He requested the people to move the Balipeedam and found 3000 songs of Thirumoolar written on palm leaves. This collection of the songs came to be called as Thirumandiram. These palm leaves are preserved in the Mutt here.\n\nThiru Maligai Thevar:\n\nThiru Maligai Thevar is the first among the nine Shaiva devotees who sung the Thiruvisaippa, the ninth Thirumurai. He is also considered to be one of the disciples of Saint Bhogar. He was born in Adi Shaiva family in Thiruvidaimarudur. His family lived in a place called Maligai Madam in Thiruvidaimarudur. Hence, he came to be called as Thiru Maligai Thevar. He was a scholar and served as guru to various Chola kings.\n\nHowever, he decided to renounce his material life and turned to spirituality. He came to Thiruvavaduthurai and practiced austerity under fig tree. He was blessed with various divine powers by Lord Shiva and Parvati. A local king named Narasingan ordered beheading of Thiru Maligai Thevar believing some baseless allegations against him. When the soldiers came to this place, Ambika urged Lord Shiva to protect him.\n\nLord Shiva directed all the Nandis in the compound wall to drive away the soldiers. As directed, the Nandis drove away the soldiers. Then, all the Nandis merged together to become one huge Nandi. This Nandi can be seen in front of the Lord. Hence, the sculptures of Nandi cannot be seen in the compound wall of this temple.\n\nIt is also believed that Thiru Maligai Thevar once made a dead man walk to the cremation ground using his yogic powers. Also, it is believed that he made the Chidambaram car (Ther) run again after it had gotten stuck. Thus, reviving the car festival in Chidambaram. The place where Thiru Maligai Thevar lived is presently the Thiruvavaduthurai Mutt. There is a shrine for him considered to be his burial place (Samathi) inside the Mutt.\n\nEmperor Musukunda Chakravarthy was blessed with Child here:\n\nAs per legend, Emperor Musukunda Chakravarthy was childless and was worshipping an idol of Thyagaraja presented to him by Lord Indra. One day, Lord Shiva appeared in his dream and advised to come to this place for worship to get a child. The emperor visited this place next day, took bath in Gomukthi Theertham and came to the Masilamaneeswarar shrine. Lord gave darshan to the emperor in the form of Vanmeeganathar of Thiruvarur and also blessed him with child. It is believed that devotees would be blessed with child if they pray to Lord Shiva here.\n\nSundarar visit to this temple:\n\nAs per legend, Sundara Nayanar visited this temple on his way to Thiruvarur from Kanchipuram. When he reached this temple, he was unwell. He prayed to Lord Shiva for relief from his illness. Lord Shiva blessed him and cured him. Sundarar then rendered a hymn praising Lord Shiva of this temple.\n\nNavakoti Siddharpuram:\n\nAs per legend, Navakoti Siddhars including Bhogar had performed penance on Lord Shiva in this place. Lord Shiva taught the Ashtama Siddhis (8 yogic powers) to Navakoti Siddhars. Thus, the place came to be called as Navakoti Siddharpuram.\n\nChera, Chola & Pandya Kings worshipped Lord Shiva here:\n\nIt is believed that emperors from three different kingdoms namely King Cheraman Perumal, one of the 63 Nayanmars from Chera dynasty, King Kochengata Chola from Chola dynasty and King Vikrama Pandyan from Pandya dynasty had worshipped Lord Shiva of this temple.\n\nLord Yama worshipped Lord Shiva here:\n\nLord Yama (Dharma Devta) is believed to have worshiped Lord Shiva here. Lord Shiva blessed him and gave him the honour of taking the place of his bull mount here.\n\nArasapuram:\n\nAs per legend, Devas and sages requested Lord Shiva to bless them by performing his Thandava. Pleased with their request, Lord Shiva performed his Thandava under the Sthala Vriksham, Arasa Maram. Thus, the sabha came to be called as Bodhi Ambala Sabha and the place came to be called as Arasapuram. It is believed that the devas and sages are present in the form of Arasa Tree.\n\nThunaivantha Ganapathi:\n\nAs per legend, Lord Ganesha accompanied his Mother Parvati and had shown the way to locate the Lingam. Hence, Lord Ganesha of this temple came to be called as Thunaivantha Ganapathi.\n\nPeople worshipped Lord Shiva here:\n\nIt is believed that Goddess Parvati, Brahma, Devas, Dharuma Nandi, Musukunda Chakravarthy, Angaraka, Agastya, Agni, Navakoti Siddhars, Bhogar, Sambandar, Appar, Sundarar, Manickavasagar, Kochengata Chola, Varaguna Pandya, Sendanar, Pattinathu Pillaiyar, Nambiyandar Nambi, Sekkizhar, Cheraman Perumal, Thirumoolar and Thiru Maligai Thevar had worshipped Lord Shiva of this temple.\n\nOther Names:\n\nThe place was called as Gomukthi Nagar, Arasavanam, Arasapuram, Kokazhi, Sivapuram, Mukthi Kshetram, Nandi Kshetram, Brahmapuram, Agasthyapuram, Dharuma Nagar, Gajaranyam, Thuraisai, Thiruvavaduthurai, Bhooloka Kailasa, Thyagapuram, Bodhivanam, Mahathandavapuram, Vedapuram, Nandi Nagar and Navakoti Siddhapuram during ancient times.\n\nSages & Lord Brahma got their upadesam of Shiva Gnanam here:"
