He is generally counted as the eighth in the list of 63 Nayanars.\n\nThe life of Pugal Chola is described in the Periya Puranam by Sekkizhar (12th century), which is a hagiography of the 63 Nayanars. Pugal Chola is described as an early Chola king. However, his dating is uncertain.[3] His historicity seems \"probable\" and he could one of the legendary early Cholas.[4] He is described as the ancestor of Kulothunga Chola II (Anapaya), who reigned between 1133 and 1150 CE. He is described a contemporary of Eripatha Nayanar, another Nayanar saint"
