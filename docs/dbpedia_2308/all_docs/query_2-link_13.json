They are installed in the prākāramaṇḍapas. Their height usually varies from two feet to three feet.\n\nOf these sixty-three saints, four saints referred to as Nālvar are installed separately in a few temples. They are\n\nTirunāvukkarasu (Appar),\n\nSundarar,\n\nMāṇikkavācakar,\n\nTirunyānasambandar.\n\ncontext information\n\nVastushastra (वास्तुशास्त्र, vāstuśāstra) refers to the ancient Indian science (shastra) of architecture (vastu), dealing with topics such architecture, sculpture, town-building, fort building and various other constructions. Vastu also deals with the philosophy of the architectural relation with the cosmic universe.\n\nDiscover the meaning of nayaṉmar in the context of Vastushastra from relevant books on Exotic India\n\nGeneral definition (in Hinduism)\n\nSource: Oxford Bibliographies: Hinduism\n\nThe term nāyaṉmār (singular, nāyaṉār) is a Tamil-language word that today generally means “leaders,” but as the term is widely known and used it specifically refers to sixty-three exemplary human figures in the Hindu devotional path of Tamil Shiva bhakti (devotion to the god Shiva), whose lives are described in a 12th-century volume attributed to Cēkkiḻār, the Periya Purāṇam (Great story), also known as Tiruttoṇṭar Purāṇam (The story of the holy servants).\n\nThe term nāyaṉār seems to have been first used in the 13th century to describe the three most famous male poet-saints (Campantar, Appar, and Cuntarar) in an inscription dated to the tenth regnal year of the Chola dynasty king, Rājendra III (1256 CE). The term nāyaṉmār may have been first expanded in the next century to refer to all of the devotees described in the Periya Purāṇam, in a text that purports to describe the making of the Tamil Shiva-bhakti canon.\n\nThe nāyaṉmār have a prominent presence in Tamil religious history as well as the present, wherever Tamils have settled across the globe—through their own compositions; biographical stories about them; their rendering in images including song, art, and film; and their incorporation into the lineage of the Tamil philosophical school, Shaiva Siddhānta. The nāyaṉmār are also fruitfully understood within the wider context of other bhakti poet-saints from Tamil tradition, as well as bhakti poet-saints from across India.\n\nLanguages of India and abroad\n\nTamil dictionary\n\nSource: DDSA: University of Madras: Tamil Lexicon\n\nNāyaṉmār (நாயன்மார்) noun < நாயன்.
