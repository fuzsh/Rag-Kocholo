        "text": "Among the numerous Hindu temples that adorn the northern bank of river Cauvery, the one at Thirailokki near Thiruppanandal in Thanjavur district has a special significance.\n\nIt is here that Brihaspati or Guru Bhagawan worshipped Lord Siva and Parvati and was blessed with the Darshan of Sundareswarar and Bharya Sowkhya Pradayini.\n\nThe scene has been enchantingly portrayed in sculpture at the temple where Siva and Parvati are seen seated on the Rishabha vahanam bestowing their blessings on Guru Bhagawan, who is standing in front with folded hands. On top of the seated divine couple one can see the icons of Kinnaras, Gandharvas and Apsaras playing music and performing dance.\n\nOn the reverse side of the panel Lord Siva is seen in Linga form, indicating that Guru Bhagawan’s intense prayers had earned him the darshan of the divine couple in the form of the presiding deities here and the powers to bestow happiness in the marital life of his devotees.\n\nThirailokki, originally known as Eamanallur on account of the good tidings that Eaman (another name for Brihaspathi) got at this place, is located on the Kumbakonam-Anaikkarai route five kilometre away from Thiruppanandal. A stone inscription of the Rajendra Chola period refers to the village of Eamanallur having been gifted to Vedic scholars to pursue their vocation, in memory of Thirailokki Madevi, a queen of Raja Raja Chola, thus causing the name of the village to be changed to Tiruloki. Saint Thirunavukkarasar has also sung in praise of this Lord in his Thiruthandakam referring to Eamanallur as a Vaipputhalam.\n\nSaint Karuvoor Thevar has praised Lord Sundareswarar in ‘Thiruvisaippa’ with a Pathigam in Gandhara Pann as ‘Thrailokya Sundarane.’ The temple has separate niches for deities such as Akhilandeswari, Dakshinamurthy, Viswesar, Bhairavar and Chandikesar in the prakaram.\n\nIt is believed that by worshipping the Lord at Thirailokki, devotees are blessed with happy marital life.\n\nThis ancient temple has recently undergone renovation and is awaiting kumbabishekam once the the gopuram work gets completed.\n\nContributions are solicited for the same. For details contact T.M. Rajamanickam, secretary, Karuvoorar Charitable Trust (Regd.) Thirailokki (City Union Bank, Thiruppanandal 5001010190405). Phone: 0435-2456696/ 94437 14384/94429 32145."
