        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nIn the early medieval period, the Alvar and Nayanmar (also known as Nayanar) saints of South India gave a new emphasis and expression to Vaishnava and Shaiva devotionalism, one that was deeply rooted in the Tamil land, language, and ethos. As mentioned in an earlier chapter, the Sanskrit word bhakti comes from the root bhaj, which means to share or participate. By extension, the bhakta is one who shares or participates in the divine. The Tamil word that is used by Alvars and Nayanmars to express their devotion to their god was anbu, which means love. The use of the term bhakti, or its Tamil version Patti, is fairly late. The relationship between devotee and God was perceived as a reciprocal one, and the term used to refer to the love of the god for his devotee was arul. The roots of South Indian bhakti can be traced to certain features in late Sangam poetry, as well as to certain elements in the Paripatal and Pattuppattu.\n\nAccording to tradition, there were 12 Alvars and 63 Nayanmars. The hymns of these saints are still sung in temples. The saints themselves are worshipped, a practice that goes back to the Chola period. Images or paintings of the Nayanmars are usually und in the hall around the sanctum and are worshipped, Vishnu temples generally have a separate shrine for images of the Alvars. There is uncertainty about the historicity of some of the saints and it is often difficult to disentangle fact from myth in their hagiographies. The male saints were not recluses or ascetics. They lived their lives as a part of society and most of them were married. The case with the female saints was relatively different.\n\nAlvar and Nayanmar poetry reflects a devotion that is at once intimate, intense, and ecstatic. The poets visualized their god in various ways-as friend, mother, father, master, teacher, and bridegroom. Many male saints took on the feminine voice of a lover or bride when expressing their longing for union with God.\n\nNayanmar is an honorific. The Shaiva saints did not refer to themselves by this name; they described themselves as atiyar (servant) or tontar (slave), indicating that they considered themselves servants or slaves of Shiva. Out of the 63 Nayanmars, 3 (known as the muvar, 'three revered ones')- Sambandar, Appar, and Sundarar-are considered especially important, and their images are sometimes housed in a special separate shrine in temples. They are occasionally accompanied by an image of Manikkavachakar.\n\nAlvar means 'those who dive deep' or 'those who are absorbed in the divine. The hymns of the 12 Alvars were collected in the 10th century by Nathamuni in the Nalayira Divya Prabandham (Four Thousand Holy Hymns), which constituted the Vaishnava anon. The first major hagiography of the Alvar saints was a 12th century work called the Divyasuricharitam by Garudavahana. In Alvar bhakti, the relationship between the devotee and Mayon or Mal (Krishna) was often expressed in terms of the lover-beloved relationship. In some instances, the mother-child relationship was also invoked. For a devotee of the lord, the performance of sacrifices or actions conventionally considered as marks of religious piety were meaningless. The focus was entirely and exclusively on love for the god.\n\nSOCIAL CONTENT\n\nMany scholars believe that the Bhakti of Alvar and Nayanars was result of their dissent towards the Brahmanical orthodoxy and emerged in India when various groups yearned for a more egalitarian, inclusive, and flexible expression of faith. Early medieval India saw the rise of many artisanal and peasant classes, which ultimately fell in the lower strata of the society. Simultaneously, Brahmans\n\ncreated elaborate rites and rituals that only they were worthy of performing to strengthen their powers. To top it off, they were virtually the only group who understood and learned Sanskrit: the language of the scriptures.\n\nIn a quest to redefine society and get closer to their God, many people started denouncing the authority of the Brahmans and the need for a mediator to reach God. Instead, they started preaching a form of devotion that included one-to-one interaction between God and the devotee, unconditional adoration of God, and participation of all regardless of their caste, class, gender, occupation, or origin. Poems and songs dedicated to God became the most common way to express their love, desires, hardships, and beliefs.\n\nThus, the discontentment towards Brahmanical traditions led to creating a form of worship where God became more approachable than before, and the language of religion became localized. Vernacular languages replaced Sanskrit, and community participation became widespread. The ideological reconstruction advocated that God exists in every individual, unaffected by the material differences created by society.\n\nAlvar and Nayanar bhakti brought several strands together, the typical Sangam Tamil humanism, anthropocentric religion, emotional and sensual character of worship, and the northern Brahmanic/Sanskritic concept of a transcendental absolute (monotheism), together with several mythological structures. God was no longer seen as far away but was brought into the huseholds of people. They didn’t require any elaborate rituals or knowledge of Sanskrit to express their love for the god.\n\nA major aspect of this process of acculturation relates to the creation of temples at various centres by royal and chiefly patrons which meant— apart from new shrines— the conversion of local cult centres into shrines of Siva. The priests of such local cult shrines were evidently integrated into the new order of worship based on the Agamas, and the priestly group called Siva-Brahmanas in the ninth-twelfth centuries would seem to be such newly initiated temple priests. This class of temple priests later came to be distinguished from the more orthodox Smarta Brahmanas and Vadamas, that is, followers of Vedic and Smrti rites, with an inferior rank among the brahmana sub-castes.\n\nBhakti thus arose as a sophisticated expression, that is, in singing the praise of God, and as an emotional seeking of union with the absolute, symbolized by the temple image. It grew into an instrument of protest or dissent against brahmana orthodoxy, existing social norms and inequalities; developed into an ethical and moral principle capable of evolving new value systems; and thereby provided the basis for the emergence of a dominant ideology that was to ultimately become the ruling ideology at the hands of powerful dynasts and elite groups, with immense capacities to sustain and revitalize itself during situations of crisis.\n\nThe Bhagavata Purana of the late-ninth and early-tenth centuries AD marks the culmination of the bhakti ideal in its emotional form and renders in Sanskrit the religion of the Alvar. It integrates all the different strands— Tamil and Sanskrit— but preserves its southern character as it derives its content and mythology from vernacular sources, namely Alvar bhakti poetry, although it adopts the Puranic literary structure. This text even adopts the Advaita position, probably in response to the non- dualism of Shankaracharya, to reconcile bhakti with Brahmanical orthodoxy. It marked an age of vigorous intellectual activity at both secular and spiritual levels.\n\nThe starting point of the bhakti cult was the system of offering material objects like land, cattle, utensils and lamps. In place of the material objects, one could offer one’s own self in the spirit of service in the same way in which commendation took place. This meant that devotion was offered in\n\nThe bhakti hymnists were, at the same time, not negating the importance of the Vedas as scriptures. On the contrary, they were trying to provide the status of the Vedas to the Tamil hymns. The idea, hence, was to establish the Tamil hymns— both Vaisnava and Saiva— as scriptures, that is, marai, equal to the Vedas, to invest the hymns with authority. The sense of a community revolving around a sectarian theistic cult comes through strongly in both the Vaisnava and the Saiva hymns. In the Saiva context, the image of a community supersedes that of social hierarchy, with the members of the community sharing their love and devotion for Siva and his sacred shrines. Through ritual singing of hymns {pamdlai or garland of verses), ecstatic dancing, ‘seeing’ {darsana) and helping fellow devotees to gain Siva’s grace, it is said, the sense of communitas61 increasingly binds or brings together people of varying social backgrounds. A significant proportion (about two-thirds) were Brahmanas, as were some of the most important saints. But there were also people from other social backgrounds-kings, minor chieftains, civil and military officials, merchants, and landowners. The saints also included a cowherd, washerman, weaver, potter, toddy fermenter, hunter, fisherman, and highway robber. Two saints-the Shaiva saint Nandanar and the Vaishnava saint Tiruppan Alvar-are described as 'untouchables'.\n\nThe concept of pilgrimage added to the growing strength of the movement by chalking out the sacred, cultural geography of that community dotted by Saiva shrines.\n\nThe twelfth-century represents a crucial period for both the Saiva and the Vaisnava sectarian movement. We find them constantly drawing upon the bhakti tradition of the hymns of the Nayanars and Alvars to strengthen their hold.\n\nAs the popularity of Jainism and Buddhism waned, and many more kings and landed magnates, patronized Hinduism through the bhakti movement, the openness and flexibility of the movement gradually disappeared, i., it became a part of the establishment.\n\nHowever, even if the Alvar and Nayanar traditions didn’t last for long, they were still able to challenge the Brahmanical orthodoxy in some ways. Even if the society wasn’t didn’t witness any drastic changes, this deviation from the tenets of orthodox philosophy, accompanied by a sense of liberation from the rigid code of ritual, certainly contributed towards the refinement of society. The shining ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity—liberty from ritual, equality of caste and fraternity in devotion—were placed before the people. Of course, untouchability for the paraiya and the miserable state of poverty of lower classes continued. But all this was made more acceptable, and even more dignified, in the light of the ideal of renunciation. resides, there was at least some exposure and criticism of the evils of greed, licentiousness and sensuality. Thus, there was some deviation from the unbridled course of vanity and worldliness due to the spontaneous evolution of a code of moral conduct among the community of devotees who propagated a new set of values in life. It was almost a revolutionary idea that Nantanár, the paraiya, could be admitted to a temple even after a series of ordeals and that Tiruppána Alvar was counted as a favourite devotee of Vishnu, and worthy of being carried on the shoulders of the chief priest of the temple. A king’s readiness to forget his pride and mix with commoners, apologize to the lord and priest for offences committed, and be a humble slave at the feet of the deity was in itself a spectacle that chastened the minds of the people. The freedom which the devotees enjoyed from all rituals, and even rules of society, was a step forward in establishing the individual’s inherent right to rebel, provided rebellion was legitimized by devotion. These devotees mixed freely and fearlessly with kings and Brahma/zas, assuming equality and even superiority at times. In this way, they set up a parallel spiritual-social authority, different from royal courts, and brahmana councils, which derived its power from the conscience of the people. The badge of bhakti, in the form of the sacred ashes or the sandal paste of\n\nthe forehead and chest, gave a certain immunity from punishment in this period, serving the same purpose as the sacred thread through the ages.\n\nIn addition it certainly provided the basis for the bhakti movements of the 12th and 13th century which draw inspiration from the Alavars and Nayanars constantly."
