        "text": "The Shaiva Siddhanta, which are dualist teachings about Shiva, is the basis of the Shaivite Bhakti tradition. The sixty three Nayanars were the main saints associated with this Bhakti tradition. They were all based in Tamil Nadu. Technically, Nayanar means leader and they were leaders in establishing Shaivism. The Nayanars were the first people (perhaps starting in the 3rd century CE) to advocate emotional bonding and love for the divine (Shiva) and deemphasise the importance of the Vedic rituals or Upanishadic philosophies. This was motivated by the need to enable non-Brahmins to attain Moksha (salvation).\n\nThe Shaivite Bhakti movement, popularised by the Nayanars, was absorbed into temple-based worship by the Brahmin priests. The Chola kings supported this perhaps to to avoid unnecessary divisions in society. This gave official status to the Shaivite Bhakti movement. Thus the Shaivite Bhakti movement which started as a way to overcome caste divisions did not address social reform against general caste-based discrimination. It was more about not accepting rigid forms of connecting with God.\n\nSome of the reforms were aimed at the kings who were taxing their subjects heavily to fund their wars. If the kings were more pious, they would less inclined for wars which will reduce their need to tax the subjects. However, because many of the Nayanars were kings or ministers to kings, their compositions have elements of violence. These poems show how Shiva is not averse to using violence to protect his devotees. The Shaivite Bhakti movement was also opposed to ascetics who were viewed as filthy and anti-social. That is one of the reasons why the Shaivite Bhakti movement denounced Buddhism and Jainism, where being an ascetic is important. For the Nayanars Bhakti was paramount. Puja (ritual worship), which was not essential, was still better than renunciation. Renunciation was equated with atheism, and thus denounced.\n\nAll the Nayanars accepted Bhakti as a way to worship Shiva. Each Nayanar developed their own style of devotion and did not really worry about theology. Some of the Nayanars composed poetry and hymns. Appar, Sundarar and Sambandar were the three main composers. In the 10th century CE many of these were published as a collection of almost 800 hymns called Tirumurai. They were also called Tevarams meaning garlands for Shiva.\n\nMany of the Nayanars were advisors to kings or part of their army. They used their influence to convince the kings to adopt their style of devotion to Shiva. For example, Yenathinathar, a general, is supposed to have promoted the importance of the Tripundra (the three horizontal lines that marks one as a Shaivite). Kulachirai, a general for a Pandyan king, convinced the king to give up Jainism and become a Shaivite. Siruthondar was also a general for a Pallava king. After defeating a Chalukya king, he decided to give up war and became a Shaivite monk (although many of the Nayanars were opposed to renunciation).\n\nSome of the Nayanars were also kings. Koon Pandian (the Pandian king who was hunch back), was a Shaivite who converted to Jainism. He converted back to Shaivism after being influenced by Sambandar. It is said that Sambandar cured his hunched back after which he as called Sundara Pandian (the beautiful Pandian). Cheraman Perumal was another king who as influenced by Sundarar and became a strong Shaivite leading him to be one of the Nayanars. Aiyadigal Kadavarkon was another king who found that ruling the kingdom hindered his spiritual progress. So he crowned his son as king and undertook a pilgrimage to visit all the Shiva temples in his kingdom.\n\nThe list of Nayanars also includes women. Mangayarkarasiyar (the queen among women) was the wife of Koon Pandian. Her role in convincing her husband to return to Shaivism is said to be greater than that of Sambandar. She is also said to have worked with Appar to ensure that Jainism was wiped out from the kingdom. Karaikkal Ammaiyar (mother to the people of Karaikal) was very influential in spreading Shaivism amongst the traders who visited the port city of Karaikal.\n\nIn keeping with the general idea of recognising devotion, independent of one’s caste, the list of Nayanars includes people who were neither Brahmins nor Kshatriyas. Nesa Nayanar was a weaver who made various garments for Shiva. He devoted all his actions to Shiva. Kanampulla Nayanar, who was a grass cutter, Anaya Nayanar, who was a cowherd, and Kannapan, who was a tribal, are other examples.\n\nThe story of Kannapan is perhaps the most well known. Kannapan found a Shivalinga in the forest and wanted to worship it. But he did not know any rituals. So, every day, he carried water in his mouth to wash the Shivalinga as his hands were full with the flowers that he picked up from the forest. Because he was a hunter, he offered parts of the animals he killed to Shiva. The Brahmin priest in charge of the Shivalinga was outraged at this. He complained to Shiva about the behaviour of Kannapan. Shiva asked the priest to observe the depth of Kannapan’s devotion. One day, the Shivalinga developed eyes and one of them was bleeding. Kannapan used different herbs from the forest, but that did not help. So he dug out one of his eyes and placed it over the bleeding eye. Then the second eye started bleeding. So Kannapan placed his foot on the bleeding eye (so that he had marker) and was about to dig out his other eye to place it over the bleeding eye. Shiva appeared before him and completely restored his vision. This is to illustrate the importance of intent of the actions rather than the actions themselves. Although Kannapan “spat” on the Shivalinga, offered meat to Shiva, and kicked the Shivalinga, it illustrated his intense devotion. Kannapan was totally selfless and wanted no material benefits for himself.\n\nManikavacakar, who lived in the 9th century CE, is not part of the 63 Nayanars. But he is given special status as being part of Nalvars – the four main saints. That is, Manikavacakar has the same status as the Muvar (the trio) of Appar, Sundarar and Sambandar. He was perhaps the most prolific composer. His composition called Tiruvacakam is said to have popularised the Shaiva Siddhanta.\n\nThe life of all the Nayanars is described in the Periya Puranam (or the great epic). The Periya Puranam is based on Nambi‘s work in the 11th century CE called Tiruttondar Tiruvanthadi. Nambi, who was supported by Raja Raja Chola, collected the major writings that were available to him. This was the basis of a Shaivite religious text that could be followed by all common folk. The Periya Puranam was composed in the 12th century by Sekkizhar (also called Chekkilar) who was a minister to a Chola king. The aim of the Periya Puranam is to narrate stories associated with the Nayanars, so that the common person would be inspired to become a devotee of Shiva. But it is mainly a hagiography and hence exaggerates the achievements of the Nayanars.\n\nOverall, many of the Nayanars were not tolerant of other religious ideas (e.g., Jainism) and actively promoted Shaivism. Many of them were great devotees. However, in many cases their devotion was not without attachment because the Nayanars were against renunciation. They advocated carrying on with one’s life but always sing the praise of Shiva. The initial Nayanars, like Appar, can be said to be the source of the different types of Bhakti including Viraha Bhakti or the devotion caused by separation. All the Nayanars suggest that Moksha can be got only with Shiva’s grace and knowledge (or jnana) is not essential.\n\nReferences:"
