        "text": "Hint: The Nayanars are a group of 63 saints who lived in Tamil Nadu from the 6th to the 8th centuries. They are dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva. Together with the contemporaries Alwar who was dedicated to Vishnu, they influenced the Bhakti movement in South India in the early Middle Ages.\n\nComplete Answer:\n\nThevaram:\n\nThevaram represents the first seven volumes of Tirumurai and the twelve volumes of Saiva devotional poems. These volumes contain the works of the three most outstanding Tamil poets of the 7th and 8th centuries: Samdbandar, Appar, and Sundarar. These three poets not only participated in their dedication to Lord Shiva but also attracted a group of believers through their songs. Their works are an important source for understanding the rise of the early medieval Bhakti movement in southern India.\n\nThiruvasagam:\n\nThiruvasagam is a collection of Tamil hymns composed by the ninth century Shaivite bhakti poet Manikavasagar. It contains 51 components and constitutes the eighth volume of Tirumurai (Sacred Anthology of Tamil Shaiva Siddartha). According to legend, Thiruvasagam is the only work narrated by Manikkavasagar under the guise of Lord Shiva and disguised by the Tamil man. The poet chased the writer without success but saw a palm-leaf manuscript in the lock sanctuary of Thillai Nataraja, signed by the Lord.\n\nNote: The 9th-century poet Manikkavacakar is not considered one of the 63 Nayanar, but his work is part of Tirumurai's eighth volume. Although there are only 63 traditional Nayanars, the Tamil poet and philosopher Valluvar is often regarded as a symbol of honor for the 64th Nayanars and is used by various communities including Mylapore and Tiruchuli. The community marches every year."
