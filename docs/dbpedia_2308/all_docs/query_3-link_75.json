        "text": "OM NA MA SI VA YA VAARGZHA\n\nIntroduction\n\nFrom the dawn of history, mankind has believed in a Supreme Being, commonly referred to as ‘God’. This belief has resulted in the growth of many religions; each differing from the other due to how each perceives this God.\n\nHistory of Religions\n\nNearly all of the religions of the world today can be traced to a period when they were founded and also establish their respective founders. Unlike most religions, one cannot establish a date for Saivism because it existed from pre-historic times and has no founder. Evidence found in the Indus Valley establishes the fact that Saivism is more than 5000 years old.\n\nScriptures\n\nMankind draws its spiritual inspiration and knowledge about God from Scriptures. Does Saivism have any scriptures? Most certainly! Of all the religions of India, Saivism has the largest volume of scriptures.\n\nSaivism draws its inspiration from the Agamas and Vedas, both of which are written in Sanskrit. The Vedas are general in that they deal with many gods such as Varuna, Indra etc. and the various rituals performed for these gods. The Agamas, however, are special in that they deal with Siva Peruman alone.\n\nPopular Scriptures in use by Saivites may be classified into two groups –‘Thothiram’(Devotional or Bakthi literature) and ‘Sasthiram’ or philosophy.\n\nDevotional Works\n\nSaivite Saints have sung in praise of Siva Peruman. These devotional outpourings are not only an expression of their Love, but contain valuable messages and deep insights into our religion. These devotional works are collectively known as the Thirumurais. There are 12 Thirumurais and they are numbered as follows:\n\nThirumuraigal 1 – 3 by Thirugnanasambandar\n\nThirumuraigal 4 – 6 by Thirunaavukarasar (Appar)\n\nThirumuraigal 7 by Sundramurthi Swamigal\n\nNOTE: This is important. The above seven ‘Thirumurais’ are commonly referred to as the Thevaram.\n\nThirumurai 8: Thiruvasagam – St. Manikkavasagar\n\nThirumurai 9: Thiruvisaippa – Nine Saints\n\nThirumurai 10: Thirumandiram – Thirumoolar\n\nThirumurai 11: Collection of works by Karaikaalavaiyar and others\n\nThirumurai 12: Periyapuranam by Sekkizhaar\n\nPhilosophical Works\n\nUnlike many religions of India, Saivism is fortunate to have a large volume of philosophical works. These works make intellectual an inquiry into the nature of God, Soul and the fetters (discussed later).\n\nThe fourteen philosophical works are:\n\nThiruvinthiyar -Thiruviyaloor* Uyavandha Devar\n\nThirukalirupadiyar – Thirukadvoor* Uyavandha Devar\n\nSivajnanabodham – Lord Meikandar\n\nSivajnaana Siddhiyar – Arulnandhi Sivaachiriyar\n\nIrupa Irupathu – Arulnandhi Sivaachiriyar\n\nUnmai Vilakkam – Manavaasagam Kadanthaar\n\nSivapirakaasam – Umapathi Sivaachaariyar\n\nThiruvarutpayan – Umapathi Sivaachaariyar\n\nVinaa Venba – Umapathi Sivaachaariyar\n\nPorripahrodai – Umapathi Sivaachaariyar\n\nKodikar – Umapathi Sivaachaariyar\n\nNenju Vidu Thoothu – Umapathi Sivaachaariyar\n\nUnmai Neri Vilakkam – Umapathi Sivaachaariyar\n\nSankarpa Neerakaaranam – Umapathi Sivaachaariyar\n\nLater Saiva Devotional Works\n\nLater Saiva Saints such as Thaaiyumaanavar, Arunagirinaathar, Sivajnana Munivar and Kumarkuruparar produced works of exceptional quality."
