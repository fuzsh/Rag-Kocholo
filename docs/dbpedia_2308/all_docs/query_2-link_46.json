        "text": "7 min read\n\nFor Prelims: Odhuvars, Saivite, Pathigams, Tirumurai, Thevaram, Avvaiyar, Bhakti Tradition\n\nFor Mains: Recognition of Odhuvars will legitimize the age-old tradition and benefit the community at large.\n\nSource: TH\n\nWhy in News?\n\nRecently, Tamil Nadu government handed over appointment orders to 15 Odhuvars (among them five are women), who were assigned to Shaivite temples in the Chennai region as they serve the deities by singing the hymns and praise.\n\nWho are Odhuvars in Tamil Nadu?\n\nAbout:\n\nOdhuvars sing devotional hymns in Tamil Nadu’s Hindu temples but are not priests. They are in the service of Lord Shiva by singing his praise from Thirumurai in Saivite temples. They sing devotional hymns but do not enter the sanctum sanctorum.\n\nOrigin of Odhuvars:\n\nThe tradition of Odhuvars can be traced back to ancient times, with its roots firmly embedded in the Bhakti movement, which flourished between the 6th and 9th centuries in Tamil Nadu.\n\nDuring this period, several saint-poets known as Alwars and Nayanars composed devotional hymns in praise of Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva, respectively. The Odhuvars emerged as custodians of this rich musical and devotional heritage.\n\nAlvars and Nayanars: The Saints of Tamil Bhakti Tradition\n\nAlvars:\n\nDevotion to Lord Vishnu: The Alvars were a group of twelve Vaishnava (devotees of Lord Vishnu) saint-poets. Their compositions primarily centered on their deep devotion to Lord Vishnu and emphasized the concept of surrender (prapatti) to attain salvation.\n\nPoetic Works: The Alvars' devotional hymns and poems were collected in the Naalayira Divya Prabandham, a significant Vaishnavite scripture. These hymns were composed in the Tamil language and celebrated the divine qualities and forms of Lord Vishnu.\n\nNayanars:\n\nDevotion to Lord Shiva: The Nayanars were a group of sixty-three Shaiva (devotees of Lord Shiva) saint-poets. They were deeply devoted to Lord Shiva and composed hymns and poems in praise of him, emphasizing the path of bhakti (devotion) and love for the divine.\n\nPoetic Works: The Nayanars' hymns and poems were collected in the Thirumurai, a corpus of Shaivite scriptures. These compositions, written in Tamil, celebrated the various manifestations and attributes of Lord Shiva.\n\nWhat is the Significance of Odhuvars in Present Context ?\n\nReligious Significance: Odhuvars continue to hold a crucial place in the daily and festive rituals of Tamil Nadu temples. They are responsible for reciting Thevaram and Thiruvasagam, two ancient Tamil texts filled with hymns and praises for Lord Shiva.\n\nCommunity Engagement: Odhuvars often come from marginalized communities, and their role in temples offers economic opportunities. Moreover, their performances bring the local community together, fostering a sense of unity and belonging.\n\nPreservation of Tamil Language: Odhuvars contribute to the preservation of the Tamil language. Through their recitations, they ensure that the ancient Tamil texts are understood and appreciated by successive generations.\n\nPromotion of Devotion: Odhuvars help create a devotional atmosphere within the temples. Their soul-stirring renditions instill a sense of piety and spiritual connection among the worshippers.\n\nWhat are the Challenges and Issues of Odhuvars in Tamil Nadu?\n\nEconomic Vulnerability:\n\nMany Odhuvar families struggle to make ends meet, as their income depends largely on temple donations and offerings. This economic vulnerability can lead to the decline of the tradition.\n\nLack of Recognition:\n\nThe Odhuvars' contribution to temple rituals and preservation of Tamil culture often goes unnoticed. They receive limited recognition, which can be demotivating.\n\nDeclining Interest:\n\nThe younger generation may not be as interested in continuing the tradition, as it can be financially unstable and offers limited social prestige. This raises concerns about the continuity of the tradition.\n\nTechnology and Modernization:\n\nThe advent of recorded music and modernization has altered the way people consume religious and devotional content. Odhuvars may find it challenging to compete with digital media and contemporary musical forms.\n\nLack of Institutional Support:\n\nRecognised government institutions like Sangeet Natak Academy etc have been non-committal to Odhuvar’s concerns as their expertise and competence in the field can alleviate the suffering of the community.\n\nUPSC Civil Services Examination, Previous Year Question:(PYQ)\n\nPrelims\n\nQ 1.
