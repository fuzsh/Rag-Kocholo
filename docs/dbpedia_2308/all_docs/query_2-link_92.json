        "text": "(idangkazhi nAyanAr purANam - Periyapuranam as English poetry)\n\n“I am a servitor of glorious Idangkazhi, the great one\n\nThat wears a garland of petalled flowers.”\n\n- The Tiru-th-Tonda-th-Tokai\n\n1. Konaadu is rich in groves where male kuyils\n\nNibbling at the tender mango-shoots, search\n\nFor their hiding mates and thus gladden them;\n\nThis realm is like unto the picturesque toyyil\n\nWorn on her breast, by the Lady Earth who has\n\nFor her clothing the great sea full of rising waves. (4109)\n\n2. Kodumpaaloor of Konaadu is the capital in whose\n\nPonds and tanks of cool and lucid waters,\n\nChafers buzz over fragrant and melliferous red lotuses\n\nAnd drink their honey; there the storks and their mates\n\nGet well fed and these, to shun the moist northern wind\n\nSlumber in the gardens of Kurukkatthi. (4110)\n\n3. Mighty-shouldered Aadithya Chozha, bedecked with jewels\n\nOf gold, hailed from the glorious dynasty\n\nOf Irukku Velir; he ruled from this city, and it was he\n\nWho gold-plated the roof of the aeviternal Ponnambalam\n\nWith the famous and fresh and weighty gold\n\nOf Konghu; Idangkazhiyaar was his ancestor. (4111)\n\n4. The great name of Idangkazhiyaar was famous\n\nThroughout the world; he would only think of the way\n\nOf servitorship to the Lord who burnt the triple\n\nHostile cities; he would not, at any time,\n\nThink of any crooked way even in his dream;\n\nBorne by great and continuous love, he would render\n\nAll acts of service, as desired by the devotees. (4112)\n\n5. He so ruled that the Saivite way flourished\n\nAlong with the dharmic way of the Vedas; for this,\n\nIn increasing splendour he caused the performance\n\nOf poojas as ordained in the Saivaagamas in all the temples\n\nWhere the blue-throated Lord abides aeviternally;\n\nThus he flourished in great and ever-increasing glory. (4113)\n\n6. One day, a subject in his realm who was endowed\n\nWith the tapas of feeding Lord Sankara’s serviteurs,\n\nCould not come by the provision for preparing\n\nA nectarean meal to Siva’s serviteur; when thus stumped,\n\nWithout knowing what he was doing by reason of his\n\nSpiralling desire (to feed the Lord’s servitor), (4114)\n\n7. At dead of night he broke into the king’s granary\n\nSituate within the many-walled and well-guarded\n\nPromptuary where heaps and heaps of paddy were kept\n\nStored in rows, and started removing some paddy;\n\nThe guards who kept watch during the night\n\nAnd who announced the passage of time by beat of drums,\n\nApprehended him and brought him before the king. (4115)\n\n8. When the spear-wielding king (in his court) questioned\n\nThe tapaswi-devotee, he replied thus: “I did this as I was\n\nStymied in all my efforts to feed the servitor of our Lord,\n\nThe Father.” When he so spake, the king grew exceedingly\n\nCompassionate, released him and said: “Lo, he indeed\n\nIs a treasure unto me.” (4116)\n\n9. Feeling contrite, the king would come by the fruit\n\nOf his riches, caused his drummers to announce thus\n\nEverywhere: “The servitors of the Lord are free to carry\n\nAway not only paddy but other riches too from the royal\n\nAnd limitless treasury and promptuary.” (4117)\n\n10. With all his consciousness and in love, he allowed\n\nHis immense and limitless treasury to be looted,\n\nAs it were, by the Lord’s servitors, and felt\n\nDelighted; he caused the flourishing of the way\n\nOf they Holy Ash by his rule of grace -- cool and serene--,\n\nOver the earth for many years and then he reached\n\nThe umbrage of the Lord’s flower-feet. (4118)\n\n11. Adoring the ankleted feet of Idangkazhiyaar,\n\nGreat and glorious in his adoration of the traditional\n\nServitorship unto the beauteously blue-throated Lord,\n\nWe proceed to narrate the divine servitorship\n\nOf Serutthunaiyaar, the tapaswi who valued not\n\nAught as superior to the way of the Lord,\n\nThe Granter of salvation true. (4119)\n\n----------------\n\nNOTES\n\nVerse No.\n\n1. Konaadu: This formed part of the old Pudukkottai state.\n\n2. Kodumpaaloor: The capital of Konaadu.\n\n7. A servitor of Siva who had vowed to feed Atiyaar regularly, would\n\nindulge in dicing and even larceny, on occasions. Tirumangkai\n\nAazhwar took to way-laying.\n\n8. As the king himself was a servitor of Siva, he viewed the criminal\n\nbefore him with extreme devotion and compassion.\n\nHere ends the Puranam of Idangkazhi Naayanaar\n\nSincere thanks to Sri. T N Ramachandran of thanjavur, for permitting his English rendering of the holy text periyapurANam be published here."
