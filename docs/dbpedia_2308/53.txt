Thiruvisaippa is a great master piece in the Shaivite Texts. This holy text is supposed to be composed during the 10th century, by the following great Shavite Saints who are also the staunch devotees of Lord Shiva: Thirumaligai Thevar, Senthanar, Karuvur Thevar, Ponnthuruthi Nambi Kata Nambi, Kandarathithar, Venattadigal, Thiruvaliyamuthanar, Purshottama Nambi, Sethiyar.

Out of the above nine Shavite saints, Sri Kandarathithar, was a Chola king, he and his pious consort Ma Sembian Mahadevi were sincere devotees of Shiva. Though he was interested to write few more texts on Lord Shiva during his period, but his dream was came true through his grandson Rajaraja I.

Some of the wonderful verses from the Holy Text, Thiruvisaippa are as follows:-

The great Lord Shiva is the one, who is the root cause of everything!
