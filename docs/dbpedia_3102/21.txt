AUNTIE MAME

US, 1958, 144 minutes, Colour.

Rosalind Russell, Forrest Tucker, Coral Browne, Fred Clark,

Patric Knowles, Peggy Cass, Lee Patrick, Joanna Barnes.

Directed by Morton da Costa.

Auntie Mame was based on Patrick Dennis's very popular story of his eccentric aunt. Rosalind Russell created the role on stage (and it is said that Dennis based his characterisation on her). She was the star of this lavish film version of 1958 - nominated for several Oscars including Best Film, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress (Peggy Cass as Agnes Gooch).

The film is a lavish production in Technirama, directed by stage director Morton da Costa (The Music Man). Rosalind Russell is full of verve in the Eve Arden vein. She has pleasing support from a range of characters including Coral Browne as Vera Charles, Lee Patrick as a snobbish New England mother, Roger Smith as the grown-up Patrick, Fred Clark. There is excellent atmosphere, re-creation of the period, attractive score by Bronislau Kaper.

The film became a musical, a stage success for Angela Lansbury and, less successfully, with Lucille Ball on screen.

The film is an affectionate, tongue-in-cheek view of the American decades of this century - and a satiric look at pretensions and snobbery.
