        "text": "“Auntie Mame” is film dreamed up in Technicolor by the Broadway ladies who lunch.\n\nBased on a play of the same name, and starring the same inimitable Rosalind Russell, “Mame” is an epic of style and sensibility. In an era of high cost and full saturation blowout productions, as Hollywood threw its Golden Age good bash, “Mame” is a treasured guest of honour at the party.\n\nThe movie and stage show were a career winter period revitalisation for the 51-year-old Russell, who literally leaps and bounds into the picture with such vim and vigour that the actress broke her ankle running down a flight of stairs. It’s just the sort of glamorous injury one would expect from perhaps cinema’s greatest…\n\nMy gay cousin gave me this DVD for Christmas the year I turned 8 and read my baby gay ass for filth.\n\nRosalind ending every scene by hitting her mark and playing her reaction for another 5 seconds under spotlight is the eternal mood.\n\nI listened to the Mame OBCR again in my car the other day and cried.\n\nYou know that feeling when you want an event to finally occur so you can experience a piece differently? Like, I want to fall in love with someone so that when we break up and I finally experience heartbreak, I can watch Carol differently. I really don't want my mom to die, but knowing that I'll have 20th Century Women and…\n\nWe should all try to be the weird aunt that the rest of the family talks about.\n\nOne of the hidden gems of the Best Picture Nominee backlog, Auntie Mame has all the liberated, quirky energy of a 2000s indie film, but with a midcentury style and a lovely sentiment running through it. The concept seems like a screwball comedy - a boy sent to be raised by his eccentric aunt while people in starched collars try to spoil the fun - but the final product is a sweeping epic of familial love brimming with a passion for life. The plot is scattered all over the place and covers many years of loss and triumph, but it all comes together…"
