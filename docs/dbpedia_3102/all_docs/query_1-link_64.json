        "text": "For a little something different on TMP today, I’ve got a fun meme/tag! I’ve seen this floating around “booktube” and have decided to change a couple of things around, adapting it to make it about movies and make a blog post out of it. What began as “The Book Burger Tag” is now going to become “The Movie Burger Tag.”\n\nThank yous to RyanReadsBooks (the creator of the tag) and LittleBookOwl (the channel where I noticed the tag) for giving me this idea.\n\nBottom half of bun: The first film in a series that you love\n\nGidget (1959): the first and best of three fun films following a surf-obsessed teenage girl and the apple of her eye, Moondoggie\n\nBurger patty: A long film (2.5+ hours) that you’ve watched and enjoyed\n\nGone with the Wind (1939): a true masterpiece of the classic era running at nearly four hours, but with not a minute wasted! This is the only film of such great length that I love enough to re-watch regularly, and am willing to re-watch at any time.\n\nCheese: A so-bad-it’s-good film that you love\n\nHillbillys in a Haunted House (1967): The title says it all. Hokey mystery-comedy featuring some of the greats of classic horror and the greats of country music. If you’ve ever wondered what it would be like to see Lon Chaney Jr. and Merle Haggard in the same film, here’s your chance.\n\nLettuce: A short film (less than an hour long) that you love\n\nNew Shoes (1936): the strangest and most wonderful 10-minute film you’ll ever see\n\nTomato: A film of average length that you either loved or hated, depending on whether you love or hate tomatoes\n\nInvasion of the Star Creatures (1962): I don’t like tomatoes unless they’re in sauce or salsa, so I’m going with a film I didn’t like for this one. I’d order my movie burger just as I order real burgers: with the command of “Hold the tomato!” This film is awful.\n\nSauce: A film you didn’t expect to love\n\nAuntie Mame (1958) – I knew I’d enjoy Auntie Mame but I didn’t expect to truly love it as much as I do. It has become, from the very first watch, one of my all-time favorite classic comedies!\n\nTop half of bun: The last film in a series that you dreaded watching, because you didn’t want the series to end\n\nSong of the Thin Man (1947) – Obviously I wasn’t alive to dread this film’s initial release, but once or twice a year I like to marathon the entire Thin Man series, and I always dread its end. I could watch a million of these. They are, in my opinion, the best set of mystery-comedies ever made.\n\nDelicious! What would you put on your movie burger? Share in the comments, or feel free to use my adapted version of the tag for a post of your own!"
