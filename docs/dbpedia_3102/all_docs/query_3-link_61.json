Directed by three- time Tony winner Jerry Mitchell, and with music by 16-time Grammy winner David Foster, the production most recently enjoyed its out-of-town run at Chicago’s CIBC Theatre ahead of its Broadway opening in 2025.\n\nAinsley was previously on Broadway in the title role of Disney’s Aladdin The Musical — off the back of leading the Australian national tour, for which he received a Helpmann nomination — and his performance was immortalised in a live capture of the production filmed at the Prince Edward Theatre, London, for future release.\n\nHis other credits include Prince Topher in Rodger’s & Hammerstein’s Cinderella (Crossroads Live), Pippin in Pippin (Crossroads Live), Molina in Kiss of the Spider Woman (Melbourne Theatre Company), Charley in Merrily We Roll Along (Hayes Theatre Co), Felix in The Normal Heart (State Theatre SA), Sonny in Xanadu (Hayes Theatre Co) and The Lost Boy in Watershed: The Death of Dr. Duncan (State Opera SA).
