        "text": "I finally watched Dune Part Two on Wednesday, so I thought I'd give my thoughts on the film. Spoilers ahead. Overall, I thought it was a good, exceptionally well-made film with its flaws for which I wish to discuss in particular. I do believe that the film tried to cover too much even in its nearly 3 hour runtime. As a result, I felt that many of the scenes were shorter than they should've been, dropping the audience in the middle to piece together what's happening while following the action. In a lot of cases this can be a very good thing, as it keeps the audience engaged, but it felt like most scenes were like this which made the film feel rushed in parts, particularly with the big final battle which is skipped over in favour of an extended sequence in the throne room awaiting for Paul Atreides to arrive. Maybe it was just me that found this to be a problem since I've seen lots of positivity around the film and don't get me wrong it is good, but I just felt that it jumped around a lot to an almost jarring extent. On the positive side, it is incredibly well shot, much like the first one and I thought that the dynamics between characters were particularly strong, especially Paul's difficult decision at the end of the film which potentially leads him down a darker path. The ending certainly leans into the option for a third, which would be interesting to see, but is at least a couple of years away. Feel free to share your thoughts on the film in the comments. #duneparttwo #films #filmreview #screenwriting"
