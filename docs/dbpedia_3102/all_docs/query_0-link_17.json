The dead were W R Nu ckols, Sealy, and W G Atwell, Opelousas, La. Heston G Howard, 33, of Beaumont suffered an arm injury. The men, employees of Workover, Inc, a company that cleans out oil wells, were at work on a well in the Katyfield, five miles west of Katy. The wells are cleaned by blowing them out with natural gas. Witnesses said there was a terrific blast, which tore up the piping at the head of the well. A seventy-five foot length of pipe, two and a half inches in diameter, was swung in a circle. The pipe struck Nuckols in the head, decapitating him. It knocked Atwell fifteen feet, breaking his neck.
