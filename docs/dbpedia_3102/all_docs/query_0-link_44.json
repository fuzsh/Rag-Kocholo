Messerli, President of Susquehanna University Dr. Jonathan C. Messerli, the 12th president of Susquehanna University, assumes office on September 1 for the start of the University's 120th academic year. He replaces Gustave W. Weber, who retired after almost two decades of service to the University. Dr. Messerli, the first lay president in the history of Susquehanna, will open the academic year as the featured speaker at Opening Convocation on Sunday, September 4 at 7:30 pm in the Weber Chapel Auditorium. The general public is cordially invited to attend. At the convocation, the Uni- versity will confer two honorary degrees— the doctor of divinity to Jacob M. Myers, recently retired professor of Old Testa- ment at the Lutheran Theologi- cal Seminary at Gettysburg; and the doctor of humane letters to Helen M. Thai, professor of home economics education at Pennsyl- vania State University. Bachelor's degrees will be awarded to Susquehanna stu- dents graduating at the end of the summer term and University Scholars will be recognized for their outstanding academic achievement. Faculty and staff will join Dr. Messerli's Primary Goal : Redefine Liberal Arts Education by Barb Wallace \"Many proposals will be placed before faculty, students, admin- istration, board, everyone. Prob- ably, and I say this with a vested interest, the task of redefining a liberal arts education in the next decade is the most intellectually exciting thing in American higher education today.\" The redefinition of a liberal arts education, what it is, and how it will affect the Susque- hanna University community, was one of many topics for which Dr. Jonathan C. Messerli, new President of Susquehanna Uni- versity, expressed great enthusi- asm. What exactly does this redef- inition involve? \"The action follows a couple of lines',\" explained Messerli. \"One is that a new president builds upon the strength that is already in the institution. Some of those strengths include a fairly high quality of sense of community here among faculty and students. That is a tremendous asset.\" \"Students are going to read literature and rediscover rele- vant authors. Clearly in the sciences they won't be going back to just the old academic categories. Theres going to be more of a focus on ecology, on a way of life the sociologists and theologians are going to be thinking moie about. 'How do you live in a society where there are declining sources of energy?' Students will be studying prob- lems like that from intellectual disciplines like sociology, anthro- pology, philosophy, and econom- ics. They woril start out studying current issues, out they'll have a good intellectual background. This is what will happen when faculty and students start think- ing about redefining liberal arts education. All of that goes on while students are going to be looking for jobs. This will create more of a dynamic tension.'* 'The future of liberal arts education and what it means and what its relationship is to pre-professional and graduate study has undergone a lot of criticism in past years. The next five years are going to redefine what that will be.\" There are two facets of the redefintion that take place in this process, Messerli explained. The thing that will take the most effort is to continue rethinking what the curriculum is and sonstantly holding our- selves responsible to thinking about separating general educa- tional issues from procedure, such as what you'll major in and what the balance of your courses should be.\" Concerning curriculum changes. Dr. Messerli thinks that the curriculum will have mors of an intellectual content. \"Content won't be just old history or old chemistry. Neither will it be a pseudo— intellectual exercise in current socially relevant issues. What will happen is that there will be more of an effort to understand the close relationship between intel- lectual disciplines and how disciplines mesh with each other. There must be a complete respect for intellectual disci- plines but also that intellectual discipline as it opens up new areas and resolves new prob- lems. That's one thing that's going to happen.\" Dr. Messerli also expressed a great deal of interset in communicating with students. He hopes to attend as many student functions as possible and to host open houses at Pine Lawn. He addressed a short message to all students: \"I feel I have a special relationship with the freshman class because I am a freshman president. To the sophomores, juniors, and seniors, I have to tell them that one of the reasons I came, when the offer was finally given, was the tremendous impression Mrs. Messerli and I had of the students. Most of the interviews I had were happy and stimulat- ing but the ones with Susque- hanna students were especially so. I have great expectations of working with Susquehanna stu- dents.\" When the changes begin to take place students will sense the changes on two levels. According to Dr. Messerli, \"The first level may be in a new auricular arrangement. The curricular arrangement is the more con- crete, fundamental change. The other, less tangible, change will come in terms of students recognizing improved teaching, better offerings in the library, and more excitement in the faculty.\" These changes will take time and Dr. Messerli explained that a definite date cannot be set for when these changes will occur. \"As to just when the changes will happen, they will probably catch up on us rather than take the form of a bold new announce- ment. I think you will see some changes, although the first year will consist of a good deal of listening and thinking, of getting much more of a sense of where we can go and what we can do.\" Help Wanted Bored of college life already? newspaper, is seeking staff Looking for some exciting members from all classes to aid activity to take up some spare in its publication.

Last spring, the SEA booked KANSAS, and sold out the Chapel Auditorium. Instead of resting on their laurels, the committee has booked The David Bromberg Band for a concert on Saturday, September 17. Co- median Tom Parks will be the opening act for the evening, set to get underway at 8:30 pm. Bromberg has been pleasing audiences for some time. Other schools have called his perform- ance \"a great show\", \"totally professional\", \"well received by the audience\". Bromberg has released albums on both the Columbia and Fantasy labels. His latest album, \"How Latell Ya Play Til? M , has been given high marks by reviewers. About now you're probably saying, \"but what kind of music does he play?\" A good question, and one that is simply answered. Bromberg plays it all. Electric blues and rock and roll, country and folk, Dixieland and ragtime, all the variations. His instru- ments include guitar, fiddle, mandolin, and dobro. He made his reputation through his association with Norman Blake and Bob Dylan. At a recent concert in York, Pa., B omberg couldn't get off the stage. He and his band of Lance Dickerson, Hugh McDonald, John Firmin, Dick Fegy, George Kindler, and & ~t Linberg were called back for encore after encore by a wildly enthusiastic audience. No matter what your prefer- ence .is in music, the David Bromberg Band can satisfy you. Tickets for the concert are only $4 with an SU ID card, and will go on sale on Tuesday, Septem- ber 6, at 4:30 pm in the Campus Center Box Office. The SEA has booked this year's first major concert in the area. With student support for this concert, there can be more. And is $4 really that much for an evening of live music? New Phone System Installed To Modernize Communications by Barb Wallace The new orange phones on campus are the result of a three-year effort to update and extend the telephone system at Susquehanna. The new system provides many new services which will eventually make the calling process much more efficient. Many of the new features concern only those with private lines, such as administrators and faculty. Some of these features include conference calls, which permit up to ten parties on the line simultaneously, and directed call pickup which enables secre- taries to pick up a call someone has placed on hold. The process for dialing inside lines is the same as with the old system. What is changed is the choice a caller has if he receives a busy signal. The first alternative is called camp-on, which enables the caller to notify a busy inside line that he is trying to get through. The camp-on warning tone consists of a double \"beep\". If you reach a busy line: Dial 1; receive camp-on warning tone; and wait for an answer. Camp-on cancels automatically after 36 seconds. If you receive a camp-on warning tone while you are in conversation you can ignore the tone because it cannot be heard by the other party in your call. Or, you can terminate your call. You need not hang up; when the person to whom you were speaking hangs up, the waiting party will be connected to you automatically. An alternative to camp-on is a process called Automatic Call- back. When you use this feature, a busy line you tried to reach will call you back as soon as it is free. First your phone rings (if you do not answer within 4 rings, the Automatic Callback will be cancelled). When you answer, the previously busy phone rings. The equipment will 'remember\" an Automatic Callback until both phones involved are available for connection to each other. Auto- matic Callback does not interfere with the normal operation of either phone involved. If you reach a busy line: Dial 2; wait for dial tone and hang up. Mr. Ritter explained that the new system is not very much more expensive than the pre- vious one. The orange phones cost less than a key phone with several different numbers on it. Each office on campus has a phone, thus reducing the amount of party lines. For instance, Heilman Hall and the English Cottage/which each had only one inside line, now have 11 and 9 extensions, respectively. The residence staff has a copy of the new directory for inside lines. The system should be hooked up completely by today or Monday, at the latest.

This test has been designed to acquaint you with some of the subtleties of life at Susquehanna. You will not be judged, graded, hospitalized or publicly mortified as a result of taking this test. You can even use a number three pencil. 1. Dr. Jonathan Messerli is a. the new President of Susquehanna University* b. closely related to Gustave W. Weber, Did You Know The Laws Have Changed? by Dave Getz State Changes For those of you who live out of state (and for those of you who live in the state but haven't as yet heard the news), Pennsyl- vania's motor vehicle code has some new wrinkles. The changes, which went into effect on July 1 of this year, are designed to ease the flow of traffic. By far the most important change is that you can now make a right turn on a red light, after coming to a full stop and allowing all traffic to pass, including pedestrians. Intersections where such turns are prohibited will be marked with signs. Some of the lights in the Selinsgrove area have \"no turn\" signs, many do not. Usually they are suspended from an overhead wire, but some are posted on poles on the corners of the intersection. Look around before pulling out. U turns are now permitted where they can be made safely and without interfering with traffic. A U turn may not be made on curves, hills, or where prohibited by signs. Pedestrians have the right-of- way if crossing the street at a green light or walk sign. If a pedestrian is crossing the street (or about to cross the street), and you have a stop sign, don't run him over. He has the right-of- way. Accidents resulting in bodily injury or death must be reported to the local or state police immediately. If one of the vehicles involved cannot be driven, the accident must also be reported at once. Accident reports do not need to be submitted to PENNDOT unless the police are unable to investi- gate the accident. That's one small step against red tape! If a vehicle is making or waiting to make a left turn, you may pass on the right, using the shoulder if it is adequate to pass safely. You may also pass on the right on highways with two or more lanes of traffic moving in the same direction, but the shoulder may not be used. If you pull out from a yield sign and are involved in an accident, you are automatically at fault. The Code considers bikes and skateboards (and almost all other wheeled objects except pianos) to be vehicles. Operators of any such vehicle must use proper hand signals when making turns. The new Code also covers vehicles moving from private property to public roads. You must come to a complete stop before proceeding onto the public road. This applies to leaving Weis Markets the same as it applies to leaving a parking lot or driveway on campus. Selins- grove police have indicated that they will enforce this part of the Code as completely as any other law. Borough Changes This brings us to changes in the Borough Code since last May. An ordinance was passed requir- ing pedestrians to use sidewalks when they are available. So, when returning from your favorite night spot downtown, stagger down the sidewalk, not the street. Bikes must be licensed this year. Licenses are fifty cents each and are good through May. They may be obtained at the borough police station. There has been a problem in the borough lately with bikes disappearing from garages and porches. The license will help police return your bike if someone \"borrows\" it for a short ride. Vehicles must be parked with the flow of traffic. This is an old law which is being enforced this year. Parking against the flow will cost you a $15 fine plus $10 costs. The parking meters downtown are hungry— feed them. Most of the meters are on Market Street and the streets running into it. Tickets are being given for overtime parking. The change in the Borough Code that will affect students the most is the Anti-Noise Ordi- nance, passed on August 15. It lists several acts as being loud, unnecessary, or unreasonable noises, but adds that the list is not exclusive. Among the enu- merated offenses are yelling, shouting, hooting, whistling, or singing on the public streets between 11 pm and 7 am; squealing tires; the creation of a loud or harsh sound by means of any horn or signaling device; the sounding of any horns on vehicles except as a danger warning; and, last but not least, the operation of a radio, phonograph, or other musical device above the volume which is necessary for the hearing of the persons who are in the room or vehicle. This is in effect from 11 pm to 7 am. If the sound can be heard clearly fifty feet from the device (or from the vehicle or building in which it is located), and a complaint is made, somebody is going to get in trouble, namely, somebody near the device which is doing the offending. Fines for this ordinance range from $25 to $300, or thirty days imprison- ment if the fine is not paid. Selinsgrove police report that they are enforcing the laws much more strictly than has been done in the past. You have been warned! c. wishing he had never heard of Selinsgrove, PA* 2.

Dr. Wiley will also visit libraries and museums in Germany, France, and England. Farel was one of the early leaders of the Protestant reform movement in French-speaking Switzerland and was author of the first summary of Protestant theology in French. He was a close associate of John Calvin. Dr. Wiley is also working on a translation of Farel's major treatise \"La Sommaire.\" Dr. Kenneth 0. Fladmark, professor of business administra- tion, has been invited to serve as a visiting professor of manage- ment in the European Division of Troy State University.

Grants Six Susquehanna University faculty members received grants totaling $4500 from the univer- sity to support summer research projects. The Summer Research Grants are awarded annually by a faculty committee. Recipients of the 1977 awards and their research projects are listed below: Donald Reekie, associate pro- fessor of music, The Teaching of Woodwind Instruments: A Crea- tive Approach for Future Teach- ers; Donald Beckie, associate pro- fessor of music, \"The Teaching of Woodwind Instruments: A Crea- tive Approach for Future Teachers\"; ant professor of political science, \"Liberalism, Imperialism, and American Foreign Policy: The Transformation of an Ideology of World Order\": Barbara Feldmann, lecturer in English, \"Edition of Elizabeth Barrett Browning's Juvenilia\"; Dr. Otto Reimherr, professor of philosophy and religion, \"A Bibliographical Study of the Writings of Four Church Fathers: Irenaeus, Hippolytus, Theodoretus, and Epiphanius\"; Dr. G. Edward Schweikert, assistant professor of psycholo- gy, \"Behavioral and Electro- physiological Effects of Caffeine in the Rat\". Housley Dr. Donald Housley, associate professor of history at Susque- hanna University, participated in the Summer Seminars for Col- lege Teachers program of the National Endowment for the Humanities. He attended a two month seminar on \"Business in the History of American Society\" led by Richard M. Abrams at the University of California at Berkeley. In its fifth year, the National Endowment for the Humanities program this summer is funding 106 seminars throughout the country on a wide variety of topics in 24 disciplines of the humanities. Twelve college teachers are \"selected from stiff competition\" to join each semi- nar, according to a recent NEH announcement. Each Summer Seminar has received a NEH grant of about $44,000 which includes a $2,000 stipend and a travel allowance of up to $400 for each participant. 'The program provides oppor- tunities for college faculty in undergraduate and two-year colleges to work in their areas of interest under the direction of a distinguished scholar and to have available the resources of a library suitable for advanced study,\" the NEH says. Dr. Housley, a graduate of Houghton College with an MA from the University of Connecti- cut and a PhD from Pennsylvania State University, has been a member of the Susquehanna faculty since 1967. Pesticide Research New Profs Richard L. Baker and Randall P. Bandura will join the accounting department faculty at Susquehanna University in September. Baker's appointment as a full-time instructor in accounting represents an addition to the staff of the department. Bandura has been given a one-year appointment as an instructor to replace Raymond Laverdiere who is on sabbatical leave and enrolled in a PhD program at Pennsylvania State University. Baker is a 1973 graduate of Bloomsburg State College and is currently enrolled in an MBA, program there. Certified as a CPA by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, he worked for three years with the James C. Rogers and Associates account- ing firm in Lewisburg. Bandura holds the BS degree Silver Susquehanna university has named Lorna Silver, a 1977 SU graduate as assistant director of the Writing Center. Directed by Hans Feldmann, associate professor of English, the Writing Center provides personal consultation for stu- dents who seek help with their writing. In May Miss Silver received the B.A. degree \"magna cum laude\" with departmental honors in English. She was on the editorial staff of \"Focus,\" the campus literary magazine, serv- ing as poetry editor during her sophomore year and editor as a junior and senior. Irvin Bigler R. Irvin, has been named director of career de- velopment and cooperative edu- k pesticide research project begun last summer at Susque- hanna University under a $21,000 grant from the federal Environ- mental Protection Agency has been funded for a second year by another grant from the EPA totaling $27,000. Dr. Thomas McGrath, profes- sor of chemistry at Susquehanna, is directing the research project in the university's Environmen- tal Studies Laboratory. He is being assisted this summer by Dr. Neil Potter, associate profes- sor of chemistry; May 1977 graduates JoAnn Pochekailo and Rick Husband; and senior chem- istry majors Bill Smeal and Joe Cheruka. The SU chemists are conduct- ing recovery studies from tap water of chlorinated pesticides like DDT and Kepone and organophosphorus pesticides such as Malathion, analyzing for the presence of pesticides at very low concentration, down to one part per billion. Analysis is done by gas-liquid chromatography, using the electron-capture and flame photometric means of detection. Their work involves controlled tests of testing techniques. They put a measured amount of pesticide into a water sample and then determine exactly what percentage of the pesticide is recovered. This information will be valuable to environmentalists by providing a measure of what a water sample test means in terms of how much pesticide is actually present compared to how much the testing techniques are able to extract. Dr. McGrath has been con- ducting pesticide research for several years, beginning in 1973-74 while on sabbatical leave from Susquehanna when he spent two months learning techniques at the EPA labora- tories in \"Cincinnati. The current project on tap water will be completed during the upcoming school year, Dr. McGrath says. Thereafter he hopes to receive further EPA funding for similar research involving surface water and mud.

Not just a winner, but a big winner— a team the school can gather behind, support, become enthusiastic about, and most importantly, be proud of its accomplishments.

The two programs are de- signed for individuals in all walks of life, but are expected to be of special interest and value to such persons as clergymen, school teachers, nurses, counselors, and social workers. Tuition is $140 for each course, valued at 3.5 semester hours credit. Individuals in some occupations may be eligible to receive reimbursement from their employer. A limited num- ber of one-half tuition stipends will be awarded to qualified applicants by Susquehanna through funding from the county Mental Health/Mental Retarda- tion offices.

The offense is another story entirely. The Crusaders will be losing their entire offensive line Mike McFatridge, Susque- hanna University junior, finished in a tie for 64th place in a field of 120 of the nation's best small college golfers at the 1977 NCAA Division III Golf Championship. Playing at the Apple Valley Golf Club in Gambier Ohio, he had a 72- hole total of 318 to finish 22 strokes behind the winning score of 296 by David Downing of Southeastern Massachusetts. McFatridge was \"up and down\" with daily scores of 83-77-82-76. Hosted by Kenyon College, the tournament was held May 24-27. McFatridge received an indi- vidual invitation to the NCAA Tournament on the strength of his eighth place finish in the Middle Atlantic Conference Tournament in April and his standing as the top golfer on the Susquehanna squad. He paced the Crusaders to 9-5 record this season with a 76.8 average. McFatridge is one of three Susquehannock High School products on the SU golf roster. The others are Mark Bostic, who averaged 77.4, and brother Mitch McFatridge who averaged 82.5. They will be joined next spring by another brother, Mark McFatridge. Women's Volleyball r with the exception of tackle Kevin Zumpetta. To rebuild this area adequately may take some doing, and it is possible that the success of this year's squad hinges on accomplishing this. Another major blow to the offense is the loss of both quarterback Hadley Brown and split end John Xanthis. Brown, leading MAC passer for the past two years, and Xanthis, leading receiver in the conference, combined for a great deal of the Crusader yardage and scoring last season. However, the key to this season's scoring success could be the 76 JV squad. The \"Little Knights\" overcame a devastating opening game defeat at the hands of Lycoming to win the remainder of their games and claim the best record (4-1) in JV Football History. Their quarter- back, Tom O'Neill, enjoyed an outstanding season and appears to be a more than adequate replacement for Brown. Leading the 76 JV's pack of talented receivers was Keith 'Fly' Ander- son. The O'Neill-Anderson air attack combined for four of the Little Knight's TDs. It seems this combination could be exactly what the Crusaders will be looking for. In fact, it has been speculated that Coach Hazlett may forego the power I forma- tion so another wide receiver can by Kathy Lehman September of 1976 marked the first year of Susquehanna's Volleyball Club. If this comes as a surprise to many readers, they are forgiven, since quite a few students may not have realized there actually was a Volleyball Club! Due to the incompletion of the new gym last year, the members of the club spent most of their time walking to and from the Selinsgrove Middle School each evening for practice. Con- sequently, these girls may never have been spotted on campus! However, circumstances have changed and prospects for this year's season are much brighter. The SU Volleyball Club is now the SU Women's Volleyball Team, and as such, is now considered a varsity sport. Two coaches, Mrs. Jinny Harnum and Mrs. Pat Reiland have been hired, and under their super- vision, the team is looking forward to a good first season. Club players who will be returning to compete on a varsity or junior varsity level include: senior Kathy Lehman; junior Sherry Rohm; and sopho- mores Carol Fagan, Karen Flynn. Alma Gibson, Julie Hall, Rosea nn Osborn, and Barb Soltau. The first season for any team is a building year. Women': Volleyball has always been a big athletic interest at SU and hopefully many talented intra- mural players will play this year on a varsity level. Also, freshmen women who would like to play volleyball are urged to go out for the SU Volleyball Team. Since this is the team's first year in existence, no spots on the team have been filled, and each girl has an equal chance at a varsity and junior varsity posi- tion. SU Volleyball Team's schedule includes matches against York, Bucknell, Franklin and Marshall, Dickinson, Juniata, and Western Maryland. Any predictions as to the team's success cannot be made until after a few weeks of practice, but coaches and players are looking forward to a bright first season. Hockey Team by Susan Stetz After a disappointing 76 season, this year's Field Hockey Team hopes to turn 77 into a winning season. Coach Connie Delbaugh will enter her 4th year as varsity coach, and she and the squad are going to try for their second winning season in these past four years. Many talented players will be returning to the team but one loss that will not be easily forgotten is the loss of right inner Sue Booth. Senior Booth was definitely a team leader and a fine hockey players, and as a result of these qualities was elected to the Susquehanna Valley and Mid-East Regional All-Star Squads. Nevertheless, the 77 team has all the potential for a victorious year. Returning to forward positions are letterwomen senior Audrey Klijian, junior Nancy Madara, and senior Anne Guckes. Halfback Jo Kinkle, a senior, will be adding her experience to the squad. Other important letterwomen are jun- ior fullback Janeen Kruse and senior goalie Chris Evans. Another player who improved vastly last year, junior Deri Kaltenthaler will also be return- ing. With a squad loaded with experience and talent, the 1977 Field Hockey Team should be able to look forward to a very successful season. The team will open with an away game against Western Maryland on Sep- tember 23. High Hopes For Harriers by Susan Stets The only fall varsity sport to produce a winning record for SU last year seems to be headed in exactly the same direction this season. The Crusader harriers will be a tough squad to beat. Last year's Freshman sensa- tion Russ Stevenson, who led the 76 thinclads to their 10th winning season in the last 13 years, will be returning to lead the team, hopefully, to yet another victorious year. Steven- son, who was a consistent first place finisher, broke the record for the 4.9 mile twice. He initially broke the record set by Jeff Yoder with a time of 24:32, then beat his own record with a time of 24:09. Another outstanding runne who will be returning to the ranks is senior Chris TheideJ Theide ran very well last fallj usually finishing right behim Stevenson, and beat him in on race. Sophomore Chris Haidinger, who improved tremendously b; the end of last season, will ad his talents to the squad. Junio Dave Nelson, a two yeari letterman, will also be a valuable asset to the team. With an improved squad which should be losing only one letterman, the 77 harriers have) good reasons to be optimistic. This year's schedule opens with an away meet against Lebanon Valley on September 24. The team fell to the Dutchmen last season.

This year's Convocation contained many of the characteristic features from previous services, but nonethe- less bore an air of uniqueness and change. As usual, the program began with the academic procession of faculty members and administra- tors, all wearing caps, gowns, and hoods, the latter specially colored to designate the wearer's field of study. After the members of the procession had seated themselves at the front of Country Music In The Grotto By Robin And Linda Williams by Judy Rile Next weekend the Grotto begins its year of visiting performers with the visit of Robin and Linda Williams. Far from the typical country music (Johnny Cash and Loretta Lynn) that is found in the coffeehouse circuit, Robin and Linda Williams carry on the tradition of American folk. Their blend of folk, blues and country music is enhanced by their use of guitar, banjo, and mouth harp. They not only perform a large selection of contemporary and traditional songs but also include many of their own compositions. Their entire act reflects their authentic \"down home\" flavor, as Robin and Linda are from the foothills of the Allegheny Moun- tains. Both tell stories well and have the extraordinary ability to weave this wit into their musical performance. Several of their ablums have been released, the most recent being \"Shenandoah Moon\" by Thursday and Friday at 8 pm for Symposium Records. a unique experience in true So, for the mere price of a country hospitality and excellent quarter, come to the Grotto next music.

Pictured are Robin and Linda WUUams, who will be in the Grotto next week performing their unique country music. the chapel, and a few pre- liminaries had been accomp- lished, Dean Reuning presented the candidates for regular course degrees. Eleven students re- ceived the bachelor's degrees, and five were awarded the associate's degree. In most cases, these were students who had finished up their course work over the summer term. Also presented at the Opening Convocation were two honorary degrees. One of them, that of Doctor of Divinity, was con- ferred upon the Rev. Dr. Jacob M. Meyers, who for forty years served as professor of Old Testament at the Lutheran Theological Seminary in Gettys- burg. The University also hon- ored Dr. Helen M. Thai, a professor of home economics education at Pennsylvania State University. Dr. Thai was award- ed the degree of Doctor of Humane Letters. Next in the program came the recognition of University Schol- ars. These are students who have achieved a cumulative grade point average of 3.25 or better. One of the most interesting and anticipated parts of the program was the announcement of several special awards. William Betz, a senior biology major, received the $500 Lind- back Foundation Scholarship Award, given annually by faculty vote to a student who \"by reason of scholastic attainment, charac- ter, personality, and all-around ability gives great promise of being a useful and valuable citizen of the community.\" In addition, senior Joseph Kimbel was awarded the Presser Foundation Scholarship, pre- sented each year to an outstand- ing senior music student. Margaret Hamilton received the Elizabeth G. Eyster Award in Music for her accomplishments as an outstanding junior music major. The Petite Brogan Schol- arship Award, given annually to an outstanding psychology major from the senior class, was captured by Glenn Miller. The last of the individual awards, the Stine - Robison Mathematics Prize, went to Ellen Knutson, honored for being the junior student with the highest average in mathematics. Finally, Sigma Kappa Sorority and Phi Sigma Kappa Fraternity won trophies for having the highest cumula- tive averages among, respective- ly, the four sororities and five fraternities on campus. Up until this point in the program, the Opening Convoca- tion service of last Sunday had not differed much from those of previous years. The difference came when Dr. Jonathan C. Messerli, the new president of Susquehanna University, got up to speak. He was, of course, addressing his first Convocation service at SU, and no doubt also his largest audience since coming here. For these reasons the occasion was indeed unique. The focus of Dr. Messerli's speech concerned the current dilemma in higher education resulting from a need to achieve both \"equality of educational opportunity\" and \"the right to individual excellence.\" The new president traced the growth of education in America, saying that while much had been done to make our system one of egalitarianism and openness, still much remained to be accomp- lished. Yet he deplored any attempt to equalize opportunities by lowering admissions stand- ards or leveling grading criteria so as to force everyone's academic accomplishments to center around the mean. Accord- ing to Dr. Messerli, such a strategy would prove not only \"disastrous to colleges and universities, but it can deprive our society of the leadership and competent citizenry without which this nation cannot func- tion.\" Rather, Dr. Messerli main- tained that colleges and universi- ties must continue their efforts to make educational opportuni- ties available to a broader spectrum of people, while at the same time preserving a high standard of academic excellence. Dr. Messerli concluded his address by challenging all con- nected with Susquehanna Uni- versity to continually strive for \"that combination of high stand- ards in a variety of outcomes which is the hallmark of the outstanding colleges in this nation.\" HEALTH CENTER A new procedure has been instituted for the Health Center. Nurses will be there Monday through Friday 8 am to 10 pm and Saturday from 10 am to 2 pm. A nurse will be on call at all other times and may be reached by calling 374-9164. A physician or paraphysician will see students Monday through Friday from 12:30 pm to 2 pm, but appointments must be made in advance with the nurse. The nurse may be reached at ext. 385. After dark, students should first call the nurse before going to the Health Center.

Commentary INNOVATION OR RENOVATION? by Deborah Bernhisel We claim that Susquehanna has reached a turning point, the beginning of a new era, but are the changes which we are in the process of making, really new and innovative or are they simply the realization that we as an institution were headed in the wrong direction? I see it as the latter; that we, like hundreds of other educational institutions, lost sight of some of the basic concepts in a solidly founded education. Letter To The Editor Nell To the Editor, As a US field hockey player, I am compelled to complain about the horrendous conditions of the hockey field. I realize that the August band camps provide SU with addition- al revenue. However, I do not believe that summer programs should interfere with the quality of programs offered to our own students, especially when alter- native avenues of action are possible. People familiar with the game of field hockey know that the ground must be level and the grass thick and plush in order to propel the ball along the ground as intended. With ruts every five yards, the game is difficult to play. In fact, the game becomes dangerous since the ball is often lofted when it hits a bump in the surface. It seems to me that this problem could be alleviated without either program suffering if some cooperation would occur. I think it is unfair and unfortunate that the students, our prime concern, always seem to come out short-handed. Sincerely, Rose Ann Neff Life Is Crowded In The Ghetto by Barb Wallace Two main factors contributed to the overcrowded situation in male dormitories this year. The first is that there was a lower attrition (drop out) rate last year than there has been in past years. The second factor is that of the unbalanced ratio of men to women in the present freshman class. Including transfer stu- dents, who contribute fifty students to the statistics, the freshman*' class is 61 percent men and 39 percent women. The ideal ratio is 55 percent men and 45 percent women. Last year, 24 students withdrew their deposits before September; this year only 14 did so. The greatest problem this creates is in housing. During orientation and the beginning days of classes, the second floor of New Men's housed the overflow, which consisted of one hall of triples, a typing room housing four men, and the upper lounge which housed eight.The typing room has no windows and the lounge has two desks for eight people. Mr. Rod Copeland, Director of Residence Affairs, has offered these students alternatives which include a $50 bonus to those moving off campus by today. All inconvenienced stu- dents will receive a rebate on their room fee. I am not claiming that we personally are responsible for a)4 the changes in both the attitudes^ and the thinking processes which have tested the very foundations of the educational process throughout the country. We are, however, responsible for our own activity or non-activity in promoting a solidly founded Liberal Arts Education. Traditional education with its rote memorization and its unin- spiring grammar lessons holds as important a position in the educational process as the self -designed major and the open classroom. Each exposure pro- vides a student with an impor- tant learning experience: one prepares the foundation, the other designs the structure. It seems rather naive and impractical for an intelligent body of educators to overlook the importance of a well-rounded education, one which will en- hance rather than detract from a major field of study. For, of what value is an individual who has become so specialized that he is unable to interact intellectually with anyone outside of his own discipline? Disciplinary specialization should come at the end of one's education, not the beginning, because the purpose of special- ization is to narrow the field of research in order to increase the possibility of new discoveries. Innovative concepts, however, are useless unless they are able to be communicated to other disciplines which can in turn put them into practical application. Such concepts are not new. A well-rounded education has been encouraged by educators for youth ever since the time of Aristotle and perhaps before. What has changed is not the need for a solid foundation in the three R's (reading, writing, arithmetic) but the possible avenues of intellectual pursuit which these basics can open up and en- courage. Valuable time and intellectual capacity has been and still is being wasted by our unwilling- ness to acknowledge that many of the innovative educational concepts are not meeting the needs of our students and, therefore, our society. The longer we wait to begin a re-evaluation of our educational process the more damage we will do to ourselves and our society. What we need is not only a cooperative effort between facul- ty and administration, but also a cooperative effort on the part of students who are mature enough to accept the responsibility for their own education. It should be an effort toward blending the traditional with the modern in order to meet the needs of our practical and very businesslike society without destroying the intellectual expansion which en- hances our culture, a new pursuit for Susquehanna, perhaps, but an old discovery for mankind. WOMEN NEEDED Women are needed to house prospective students this year. The 605 housing project is to aid admissions in housing both male and female prospective freshmen for next year. The male situation has been taken care of but if you're a girl who would be able to put up a prospective freshman once or twice a term for a night, please contact Mike Fordham through campus mail or at ext. 372. Please enclose your name, extension, dorm and room number. The residents of 605 appreciate all possible help. one* At* EDWHM IS THE SCXICST ^A?^ J* .^FSSf* ClRL IN THE MlOWCST »* A PERPETUAL fOS.

It consists of Don Mann, a veteran of many productions here; Rose Anne Sinkosky, who many will remember as Helena in last year's production of \"A Midsum- mer Night's Dream\",* Stephen Hinks, Janet Heaton, and Nancy Adams. Finally, what is Spoon River? Anyone who expects a typical evening of theatre will come from the show greatly surprised. In a broad sense, the play is not a play at all, but a theatre piece for five actors. It is set in the following Wednesday at mid- night and Sunday at 7 pm. \"The James Bonds, Perry Masons, and even Hercule Poirots come and go,\" says Walter Sheppard, Manager of WITF-FM, \"but no one has been able to dislodge Holmes and his companion, Dr. Watson, from their commanding position of popularity. The vitality of the characters created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is such that they have assume the reality of flesh and blood.\" He cites the example of parties of French schoolboys who, on arriving in London, still want to be taken to visit Holme's fictional address, 221-B Baker Street. 'The current business occupant of the address has a staff member assigned to answer the hundreds of letters sent there every year addressed to 'the world's first consulting de- tective',\" Sheppard says. Holmes and Watson have appeared in plays, in a Broadway musical, in films, on TV, and even in a ballet, but the Hershey station manager believes \"they are most successful— outside of the printed pages of the originals— on the radio.\" The most famous portray er of Holmes in the United States is the late Basil Rathbone (Nigel Bruce was his Watson), and John Gielgud played him (with Ralph Richardson as Watson) in a brief series WITF-FM aired a few years ago. The newest series has veteran British radio actor Carleton Hobbs as Holmes with Norman Shelley as his com- panion, who introduces and narrates each episode. One highlight of the new series is that each of the four novels Doyle wrote about Holmes and Watson is serialized over three half-hour episodes, \"a much more satisfactory treatment than jam- ming them into thirty minutes apiece,\" Sheppard thinks. WITF- FM will broadcast the first of them— 'The Hound of the Bas- kervilles\"-on October 20 at 10 pm as a 90-minute special. National Teacher Exams lines for meals, ID pictures, and registration.

Now that the major portion of the work is completed, some of the committee members are beginning to look back on their efforts. Sue Odjakjain, for instance, claims that the entire orientation passed by so quickly that its memory seems blurred. OJ does, however, remember open gym slots were new to this year's program and needed to be organized prior to the arrival of the Freshman Class. Over all, however, Ms. Anderson was pleased with the outcome of the program, having been especially encouraged by the cooperation of the new students. Of course, not everything ran as smoothly as was desired, especially course selection and registration, but in these areas a computer foul-up and over the experience as an enjoyable crowding were the major deter one, but she regrets not having rents. For the most part, the had as much personal and verbal freshmen seemed more prepared contact with the incoming fresh- f or registration than in previous men as she had had during a previous orientation. Jean Hedrick, chairman of the Orientation Planning Commit- tee, on the other hand, views the entire program as a success, praising the hard work and competent management execut- ed by her- committee members. Jean also found Dr. Messerli an especially helpful addition to the orientation program; his en- years, especially through the efforts of the student advisors and the \"Need to Know Session\" included in the orientation activities.

Educational Testing Service, the nonprofit, educational organization that administers this testing pro- gram, said today that the tests will be given November 12, 1977, February 18, 1978, and July 15, 1978, at nearly 400 locations throughout the United States. Results of the National Teach- er Examinations are considered by many large school districts as one of several factors in the selection of new teachers and used by several states for the credentialling of teachers or licensing of advanced candidates. Some colleges require all seniors preparing to teach to take the examinations. On each full day of testing, registrants may take the Com- mon Examinations, which mea- sure their professional prepara- tion and general educational background, and/or an Area Examination that measures their mastery of the subject they expect to teach. Prospective registrants should contact the school systems in which they seek employment, their colleges, or appropriate educational association for advice about which examinations to take and when to take them. The Bulletin of Information for Candidates contains a list of test centers and general information about the examinations, as well as a registration form.

Fierro becomes dis- gusted with the extremely unjust and corrupt conditions in Argentina and rejects the socio- political system of his country. By refusing to conform to the government and its respective institutions, the gaucho offers persecution and must continually run from the authorities. Martin Fierro will be shown in Faylor Lecture Hall, Science Building, on Tuesday, Sep- tember 13 at 7:90 pm. The entire campus community is invited and admission is free. We hope there will be English subtitles. Come see the South American western movie at its finest!
