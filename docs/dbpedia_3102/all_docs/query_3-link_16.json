        "text": "The character of Mame Dennis has endured many iterations, as the titular character in Edward Everett Tanner III’s novel and later it became the 1966 hit Broadway musical, Mame, starring Angela Lansbury. In 1974, the musical Mame was adapted into the movie musical of the same name, starring Lucille Ball. Ball’s version is considered an absolute disaster and she was considered miscast. Lansbury’s performance as Mame Dennis was one of the highlights of her career. As much as I love Lucille Ball, I wish that Lansbury had been given the opportunity to reprise her role in the film. The iteration that is the most remembered however, is the 1958 adaptation, Auntie Mame, starring Rosalind Russell. Russell was reprising her Tony Award-winning role in the 1956 adaptation of Tanner III’s novel. She was born to play Mame Dennis. It is the perfect marriage of star and part.\n\nAuntie Mame starts in 1928 when Mame Dennis’ nephew Patrick is orphaned when his father Edwin dies unexpectedly. Edwin’s sister, Mame, is given custody of Patrick per Edwin’s will. The trustee of Patrick’s large inheritance, Dwight Babcock (Fred Clark), had been tasked by Edwin to try and undermine Mame’s enormous influence over everyone. Her larger than life personality and love for unique people, cultures and experiences– her overall lust for life so to speak, charms her to many people from different walks in life. Mame has an eccentric group of friends, all whom end up at her townhouse all hours of the day–often because she’s invited them over for a wild party. Some of Mame’s friends include book publisher Lindsay Woolsey (Patric Knowles), actress Vera Charles (Coral Browne), and Acacius Page (Henry Brandon) who runs a nudist resort. Patrick of course is fascinated by all these people, which horrifies Mr. Babcock.\n\nThe stock market crash of 1929 bankrupts Mame. She is forced to start working to pay her bills. All her jobs end disastrously, including appearing on stage with Vera where the bells on her jewelry and clothing is distracting both to the actors and audience. Later, Mame works as a switchboard operator and finally as a sales girl at Macy’s. While at Macy’s, Mame meets oil baron Beauregard Jackson Pickett Burnside (Forrest Tucker). Mame and Beauregard fall in love and marry and spend their days traveling the world. Meanwhile, Patrick is living under the guardanship of Mr. Babcock which is leading to Patrick developing a more conservative personality.\n\nVERA to MAME: What the HELL have you got back there? Reindeer?!\n\nCoral Browne as “Vera” to Rosalind Russell as “Mame” while Vera and Mame appear onstage.\n\nIn 1937, Beauregard dies in a mountain climbing accident, leaving Mame a very wealthy widow. Beauregard’s death serves as the moment when the film transitions from child Patrick to adult Patrick (Roger Smith). When Mame returns to her home after her husband’s death, she is greeted with gifts from Patrick: a Dictaphone, typewriter, and a secretary named Agnes Gooch (Peggy Cass). Patrick and Mame’s friends encourage Mame to write her memoirs. A ghostwriter is hired, Brian O’Bannion (Robin Hughes) is hired, though it quickly becomes apparent that he’s after Mame’s money.\n\nNow comes for my favorite part of the film: the introduction of the Upson family. Patrick announces to Mame that he’s engaged to Gloria Upson (Joanna Barnes), the snobby rich daughter of Doris (Lee Patrick) and Claude (Willard Waterman). There’s a funny scene where Mame visits Doris and Claude and is given Claude’s signature cocktail, a daiquiri made with a lot of honey. Rosalind Russell is hilarious in this scene. Her facial expressions fully inform the audience how disgusting this drink is. Later, she basically tosses the drink over her shoulder and wisely turns down a refill. It is this scene where Mame learns that the Upsons live in a restricted community. Of course, Mame who loves people from all religions, occupations, etc. is appalled. She gets delicious revenge later.\n\nGLORIA: Oh my, what a stunning apartment!\n\nMAME: Thank you.\n\nGLORIA: Books are awfully decorative, don’t you think?\n\nJoanna Barnes as “Gloria” and Rosalind Russell as “Mame”\n\nJoanna Barnes’ performance of Gloria is hysterical. At Mame’s party, she tries to entertain Mame and her friends, with actual interesting lives and stories, with her anecdote involving a wild ping pong game which resulted in the ball being stepped on. As one can imagine, Mame and her friends are not impressed at this vapid, snobby, idiotic woman. Gloria constantly calls everything “top drawer” with her nasally “Valley Girl-esque” voice. She tries so hard to impress everyone with her wealth and status, but she’s so shallow and has no substance that she comes off as an idiot. Mame is repulsed by the Upsons and does everything she can to try and open up Patrick’s eyes to the family he’s about to marry into.\n\nGLORIA: Bunny Bixler and I were in the semi-finals – the very semi-finals, mind you – of the ping-pong tournament at the club and this ghastly thing happened. We were both playing way over our heads and the score was 29-28. And we had this really terrific volley and I stepped back to get this really terrific shot. And I stepped on the ping-pong ball! I just squashed it to bits. And then Bunny and I ran to the closet of the game room to get another ping-pong ball and the closet was locked! Imagine? We had to call the whole thing off. Well, it was ghastly. Well, it was just ghastly.\n\nJoanna Barnes as “Gloria” in Mame\n\nEventually Mame gets a new secretary, Pegeen Ryan (Pippa Scott), after Agnes ends up pregnant after a (presumably) one night stand with O’Bannion. Earlier in the film, Mame had sent Agnes to a party in her place to sabotage O’Bannion’s attempts to woo her, i.e. move in on her money. Patrick is smitten with Pegeen, a pairing that pleases Mame. At the aforementioned party, Mame invites her friends over to show off her memoir. She also redecorates her townhouse with futuristic decor, including a seating area that can be raised and lowered with different cords. Mame’s goal of course is to drive the Upsons out of her home and of course, Patrick’s life.\n\nRosalind Russell is everything in the role of Mame. She is loud, vivacious, glamorous, hilarious and incredibly charming. I love how Mame’s zest for life is portrayed through the evolution of Mame’s costumes and decor in her townhouse. As Mame visits a new country or becomes interested in another culture or decorating style, her clothing and furnishings change to reflect her new interests. Russell’s costumes are gorgeous, my favorite costume being the silver sequined shirt and harem pants with a chartreuse organza wrap she wears at her big party with the Upsons. Mame also wears a great orange crepe coat with a mandarin collar while she’s in her “Asian period.” At the end of the film, while Mame is packing for a trip to India she is dressed in a beautiful gold gown with a matching embroidered gold wrap. I think Russell’s height (5’8) suited her well for all the gorgeous coats and gowns that Mame wears.\n\nThe supporting cast is excellent as well and work well in Mame’s world. Coral Browne plays Mame’s best friend, Vera, and is just as outrageous. She often gets plastered at Mame’s parties and just sleeps it off. Vera has an acid tongue and is hilarious. Peggy Gooch as Mame’s secretary is hysterical. Her raspy high pitched voice is funny enough, but it is even funnier with her frumpy appearance. Joanna Barnes as the snobby and spoiled daughter of the Upsons is hilarious–especially when you can see from where she got her behavior. Lee Patrick and Willard Waterman are obnoxious. They’re like every snobby rich person who thinks that money makes up for having class and taste. Because they’re rich, everything they eat, drink, do, etc. is fancy and for the elite, because they’re doing it.\n\nVERA: If you kept your hair natural like I do…\n\nMAME: If I kept my hair natural like yours, I’d be bald.\n\nCoral Browne as “Vera” and Rosalind Russell as “Mame”\n\nAn interesting aspect of Auntie Mame‘s presentation is how it is presented as if one were watching a play on the screen. Each section of the play ends with a dimming of the screen and a bit of a pause in the action–as if we needed to wait for new sets and costume changes. This gives the film a very stylized, elegant presentation which might be off-putting to some, but I find it appropriate for the Mame character. She herself is a stylish person. She is sophisticated. Since her style evolves as she does, the stylish aesthetic of the film is fitting. The presentation of the film and of Mame herself supports her message: Life’s a banquet and most poor suckers are starving to death!\n\nOn July 1, 2020, Dame Olivia de Havilland celebrated her 104th (!) birthday in Paris, France. Aside from being the last surviving cast member from Gone With the Wind, she is also one of the last surviving figures from the Golden Age of Hollywood. Olivia is a two-time Oscar winner, having won the Best Actress Academy Award for her roles in Hold Back the Dawn (1941) and The Heiress (1949). However, aside from being known for her age and status as an Oscar-winner, Olivia is probably best known for her nine (!) collaborations with the incomparable Errol Flynn.\n\nFull Disclosure: I LOVE Errol Flynn.\n\nIn his autobiography, My Wicked, Wicked Ways*, Errol admits that he fell in love with Olivia during the making of his (and her) first big studio film, Captain Blood. However, despite his infamous reputation as a panty-dropping ladies man, Errol does not kiss and tell. In fact, he states that his propensity for playing juvenile pranks on Olivia probably lost him his chance at a relationship with her. Olivia on the other hand, admits that the two of them had some sort of passionate romance, however, their relationship was never consummated. What is the real truth? The only people who know that for sure are Errol and Olivia. Errol unfortunately is no longer around (passed in 1959) and Olivia is remaining tight-lipped on the subject.\n\n*My Wicked, Wicked Ways is an amazing book. It, along with Desi Arnaz’ A Book, is the most entertaining book I have ever read. During my first read, when I got toward the end, I actually read just one page a night because I didn’t want it to stop!\n\nWhat we do know is that on-screen, Errol and Olivia’s chemistry is off the charts.\n\nErrol and Olivia appeared in the following films together:\n\nCaptain Blood (1935). Errol and Olivia’s big break. This film made an overnight matinee idol out of Errol and opened the doors for Olivia. Errol appears as the title character, Dr. Peter Blood aka “Captain Blood.” Peter is arrested for treason while treating a patient who participated in the recent rebellion. Peter is given a break (maybe?) and instead of execution (after being sentenced to death), he is sold into slavery. Peter, along with other future slaves, are shipped off to the West Indies.\n\nOlivia appears as Arabella Bishop, the niece of the local military commander, Colonel Bishop. Arabella fulfills every woman’s fantasy and purchases Errol… err… Peter for 10 pounds to be her slave. You got one heck of a deal, Arabella. You will not be unhappy. Peter of course, resents being sold into slavery and is cold to Arabella. Eventually Peter and the other men revolt, seize a Spanish ship and become pirates.\n\nPeter and Arabella’s relationship follows a similar trajectory that many film romances share. Boy meets girl. Boy and girl don’t get along. Boy or girl spend much of the movie trying to get the other to like them. They fall in love at the end. However, unlike most of the romantic fluff out there, Captain Blood is exciting, entertaining, and fun. Errol and Olivia’s playful flirtation and rapport is one of the big reasons for this film’s success.\n\nThe Charge of the Light Brigade (1936)\n\nI’ll admit that I’ve only seen this film once. It features Errol and Patric Knowles as brothers living in India during the mid-19th century. Errol is a Major and Patric is a Captain with the 27th Lancers of the British Army. The main conflict is that Patric has betrayed Errol by taking up with his fiancee, Elsa, played by Olivia.\n\nMuch of this film features battles (blah) and the love triangle between Errol, Patric, and Olivia (ooh I love love triangles). However, the animal abuse by the film production crew, and Errol’s subsequent outrage is my biggest takeaway from this film.\n\nIn his autobiography, Errol details in length the cruel tactics used to make the horses trip for the battle scenes. An animal lover and accomplished horseman, Errol was disgusted and outraged by what he saw on set. He was further incensed by director Michael Curtiz’ nonchalant attitude toward the numbers of horses injured and killed by his stunts. Errol reported the production to the ASPCA. This action led to the US Congress implementing measures to ensure that animals used in film production were not injured or killed–thus the “no animals were harmed in making this motion picture” statement that is featured in most movies today.\n\nThe Adventures of Robin Hood (1938)\n\nThis is probably Errol and Olivia’s best known film collaboration, as well it should be. This film is perfect from start to finish. It is exciting, funny, has a great cast, fun characters, beautiful costumes, everything that one wants in a film. And this film, in its glorious Technicolor, is absolutely gorgeous.\n\nI don’t think much plot is necessary, as most people, I imagine, are familiar with the Robin Hood legend. Errol plays the titular character, Robin Hood. Robin and his gang of merrymen have been banished to Sherwood Forest after opposing Prince John (Claude Rains)’s tax raise and voicing his opposition to Prince John’s usurping his brother, King Richard the Lionheart (Ian Hunter)’s throne and his intention to restore Richard’s place in the kingdom when he returns from fighting in the Crusades. Olivia plays Maid Marian and she’s disgusted by Robin’s insolence and vigilante behavior. She also doesn’t like that Robin and his gang regularly rob the rich to pay the poor.\n\nHowever, as the film progresses, Marian begins to see Prince John for who he truly is, and also realizes that Robin is a good guy and begins to fall in love with him–much to the chagrin of Sir Guy of Gisbourne (Basil Rathbone).\n\nFour’s a Crowd (1938)\n\nThis is one of Olivia and Errol’s lighter fare. After appearing in back to back swashbucklers, Flynn was eager to do something else. Warner Brothers appeased their star by placing him in this light comedy. Honestly, this isn’t the greatest film, but it has a fantastic cast, Errol looks great, it’s amusing, and it’s fun to see Errol in a comedic part. He shows a flair for comedy. It’s a shame that he wasn’t given more opportunities.\n\nOlivia in this film is adorable, but honestly, her character is annoying. The best pairing in this film is Errol and Rosalind Russell.\n\nIn this film, Errol plays Bob Lansford, the former editor-in-chief of the local newspaper where Jean Christy (Russell) works as a reporter. Jean is concerned that her new boss, Pat Buckley (Patric Knowles) is running the newspaper into the ground. Since leaving the paper, Bob has formed a new PR firm. Jean appeals to Bob to return to the helm of the newspaper. While initially uninterested, Bob becomes interested in this prospect when he learns that Pat’s fiancee is Lori Dillingwell (Olivia). Lori is the granddaughter to John P. Dillingwell (Walter Connolly), a millionaire who has developed a poor reputation. Bob hopes to use Lori to gain access to John P. so that he can obtain his business for his PR film.\n\nErrol is his usual charming self in this film. Olivia on the other hand, while pretty and adorable, acts like a giggly airhead and has an irritating laugh. Patric Knowles’ character isn’t much better. The two of them together can be a little annoying at times. However, if you love Errol and love Rosalind Russell (like I do), then they are worth the time spent watching this film. I’ve watched this film numerous times, so obviously Olivia and Patric’s characters don’t keep me away from this film too much.\n\nDodge City (1939)\n\nI’m not a big Westerns fan, but I love this movie. In this film, Errol plays Wade Hatton, an Irish cowboy who has ties to Dodge City is enlisted by Colonel Dodge to clean up the town. It has been overrun by Jeff Surrett (Bruce Cabot) and his gang. Wade brings his friends, Rusty (Alan Hale) and Tex (Guinn “Big Boy” Williams) to assist. Olivia plays Abbie Irving, a settler who is traveling to Dodge City with Wade and his companions. She is planning on living with her aunt and uncle who reside in Dodge City.\n\nAfter initially turning down the sheriff job, Wade agrees after witnessing the tragic death of a young boy in town. Wade, Rusty and Tex are doing a good job of clearing out the riff raff, but obviously are met with opposition by Surrett and his cronies. Abbie, meanwhile, has taken a job writing for the local newspaper, headed up by Joe Clemons (Frank McHugh).\n\nDespite being a Western, I think this is a really fun film and Olivia and Errol once again light up the screen. Alan Hale is hilarious, especially when he inadvertently joins a temperance movement. Frank McHugh is always a delight.\n\nAnn Sheridan’s talents and personality are wasted in this film. She appears in a small part as a saloon girl. Someone of Sheridan’s caliber was not needed for this role.\n\nThe Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex (1939)\n\nAt this point in her career, Olivia was tired of playing Errol’s girlfriend in all her films (there are worse things you could be, imo). She wanted a chance to play more challenging parts and stretch her acting chops. She had just completed one of her most famous roles, Melanie in Gone With the Wind, and hoped that this was her chance for more meaty parts. However, Jack Warner, the bigwig at Warner Brothers was afraid that this experience would go to her head. To keep her grounded, he cast her in a small part in The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex starring Errol and Bette Davis.\n\n‘Elizabeth and Essex’ is Bette’s film. Olivia’s part is so insignificant, that it could have been given to anyone and not made much of a difference. Olivia is completely lost in this film, especially in the shadow of Bette’s performance as Queen Elizabeth I. This film details Elizabeth I’s relationship with the much younger Lord Essex, played by Errol. While in love with Elizabeth I, Essex also yearns for power and is frequently at odds with his lover/Queen when he defies her orders. Elizabeth I struggles with her age, vanity, and her love for Essex, but also wants to retain her power.\n\nOlivia plays Lady Penelope, Elizabeth I’s lady in waiting. The main conflict with her character is that she’s in love with Essex as well. Elizabeth I fears losing Essex to the much younger and prettier Penelope. Penelope also schemes to break Elizabeth I and Essex up so that she can pursue him. This could possibly be a meaty part, but Bette’s performance as Elizabeth I is so intense and, frankly, it’s A LOT, that one almost forgets that Olivia is even in the film until she’s seen again.\n\nWhile I love Bette, I cannot decide if I like this performance. Sometimes I think it’s amazing and other times, I can’t get past Bette’s constant fidgeting. What does make this film worth watching are the gorgeous costumes, a young Nanette Fabray in her film debut, and Errol’s thigh-high boots.\n\nSanta Fe Trail (1940)\n\nThis film must be Errol and Olivia’s least popular. I only say that because this film is in public domain. As far as I know, it’s never received a proper studio release. I’ve only seen it a couple times, it’s not bad, but it’s not my favorite either.\n\nIn this film, Errol plays Jeb Stuart, a recent West Point graduate. He, along with his friend George Custer, played by Ronald Reagan, are sent to Fort Leavenworth, the most dangerous assignment in the Army. Both Jeb and George relish this assignment. On the way to Kansas, Jeb and George meet Cyrus Holliday who is building the railroad to Santa Fe, NM. His daughter, Kit, played by Olivia, is also accompanying him. Both Jeb and George are smitten.\n\nMost of the remainder of the film features Raymond Massey as the villain, John Brown, and lots of battles and such. I don’t really remember the particulars.\n\nThey Died With Their Boots On (1941)\n\nThis is technically Olivia and Errol’s last film together. They have a very fitting goodbye scene toward the end of the film. While Errol’s dialogue is given within the context of a husband (who knows he will most likely die) saying a final goodbye to his wife (who knows deep-down that she won’t see her husband again), the words could apply to Errol and Olivia as well.\n\n“Walking through life with you, ma’am, has been a very gracious thing.”\n\nGeorge Custer (Errol Flynn) to wife, Elizabeth Bacon Custer (Olivia de Havilland)\n\nIn this film, Errol plays General George Custer. At the beginning of the film, he is arriving at West Point in a ridiculous uniform that he designed himself, with the intention of looking like a visiting foreign general. While at West Point, George racks up a series of demerits for pranks and general disregard for any protocol and rules. Despite being at the bottom of his class, George and his class graduate early so that they can report immediately to Washington, D.C. at the onset of the Civil War.\n\nPrior to graduation, George had met Libbie Bacon (Olivia) when she approached him, asking for directions. He asks her out on a date, but is unable to meet up with her when he is forced to report to DC for his war assignment. When they finally meet up again, George has made himself very unpopular, after making a joke at Libbie’s father’s expense. Libbie and George have to meet up in secret. Libbie’s maid, Callie (Hattie McDaniel), helps the couple keep their secret.\n\nThrough a miscommunication with the War Department, George is mistakenly promoted to Brigadier General. Despite this however, his regiment, the Michigan Brigade, wins at Gettysburg.\n\nThe remainder of the film features George and Libbie’s lives leading up to that fateful day at the Battle of the Little Bighorn, where the audience knows George will meet his fate.\n\nThis is a very sweet film, though not one that I re-watch very often. War and Westerns aren’t my favorite genres, but Errol and Olivia and Hattie make this film very re-watchable. Errol’s appearance at he beginning in his outlandish military garb is hilarious.\n\nThank Your Lucky Stars (1942)\n\nErrol and Olivia appeared in this film together, but they weren’t together. Both appeared as themselves in separate numbers. Thank Your Lucky Stars was made during WWII and created to serve as a fundraiser for the war effort. Every star who appeared in the film donated his or her salary to the Hollywood Canteen.\n\nThe Hollywood Canteen was an organization opened by Bette Davis and John Garfield. It was intended to serve as a club that catered only to servicemen fighting in WWII. In addition to the US servicemen, servicemen of Allied forces and women in any branch of service were invited to attend. The idea of the Hollywood Canteen was that servicemen (and servicewomen) could enter the club using their uniform as a ticket. All amenities within the club were free. The club was staffed by countless members of the entertainment industry. Everyone from the big A-list stars down to the key grips volunteered to work at the Hollywood Canteen. A serviceman could enter the canteen and have Rita Hayworth serve him lunch, only to dance with Betty Grable afterwards.\n\nThe plot of Thank Your Lucky Stars is very thin. Basically, Edward Everett Horton and SZ Sakall are trying to stage a “Cavalcade of Stars” wartime charity show, but star Eddie Cantor’s ego is threatening to take over the production. Aspiring singer Tommy (Dennis Morgan) and his songwriter girlfriend, Pat (Joan Leslie), conspire to join the production by coaxing Horton and Sakall into replacing Cantor with their look-a-like friend, Joe.\n\nThroughout the initial part of the plot, Hollywood stars like Humphrey Bogart make non-musical appearances. At the end of the film, we’re treated to what is presumably Horton and Sakall’s “Cavalcade of Stars.” It is in this section where we’re treated to Olivia and Errol’s only on-screen musical performances. They do not appear in the same production number. Olivia is paired with Ida Lupino. Honestly, their number isn’t really that great. Errol on the other hand, has a solo number and his song is one of the best in the show. His natural charisma and good looks are on full display, despite the silliness of the number.\n\nIn my first post, I lamented blogs being abandoned soon after being started. I unfortunately temporarily fell victim to that phenomenon, because I didn’t know what to do next. I wanted to start the blog, but felt overwhelmed. I decided today (Labor Day) to try and get this thing going. I thought I’d kick things off with the film I’m watching right now in honor of Labor Day–Picnic (1955).\n\n(I’ve seen this film multiple times and never tire of it)\n\nPicnic opens with star William Holden (Hal Carter) hitching a ride on a freight train headed through a small Kansas town. He has an acquaintance (and former fraternity brother), Cliff Robertson (Alan Benson) who lives in this town. Hal, who failed in his latest venture, Hollywood star, is hoping that Alan will set him up with a job at his wealthy father’s grain mill. After disembarking from the train, Hal ends up meeting Verna Felton (Mrs. Potts), a kind elderly woman who not only dispenses kind advice to the young single mom next door, but she also is her mother’s (!) caretaker. In exchange for breakfast, Hal offers to help her out with any work she needs done around her home. Despite her protests (“It’s Labor Day. Nobody works on Labor Day,” Mrs. Potts tells Hal), Hal insists on completing some yard work for her. Mrs. Potts is hilarious because on at least two occasions (perhaps even three), she tries to get Hal to take his shirt off. She succeeds in the first scene when she offers to wash his shirt while he does her yard work.\n\nWhile Hal is working away in the yard, Susan Strasberg (Millie Owens), a soon to be high school senior, is sitting outside next door, reading The Heart is a Lonely Hunter. She is a bookworm, a bit of a tomboy who very much resents being in the shadow of her 19 year-old sister, Kim Novak (Madge Owens). Madge is considered one of the prettiest girls in town. Betty Field (Flo Owens) portrays the single mother of the two girls. It seems that Mr. Owens walked out on the family when Millie was a newborn, so Flo has been on her own for a long time. Flo’s main goal for her daughters is that Millie will use her academic talents to attend college and Madge will use her beauty (it is alluded to that academics aren’t Madge’s specialty) to snag a rich husband, in this case, the intended target is Madge’s boyfriend, Alan. Rosalind Russell portrays Rosemary, the local schoolteacher who also rents out a room in the Owens’ home. She is also depressed because she’s unmarried and is hoping that her longtime beau, Arthur O’Connell (Howard Bevins), will marry her so she can lose the title of spinster. All these characters end up at the annual Labor Day Picnic, which is where a bulk of the action takes place.\n\nThe main conflict in this film:\n\nFlo wants Madge to be more committed to wealthy boyfriend Alan, who is really only interested in Madge because she looks good on his arm. Madge, it seems isn’t really into Alan, she’s dating him because her mother wants her to. There is some funny and icky (in the sense that it’s mother and daughter) dialogue between Flo and Madge about her relationship with Alan.\n\nFLO: “If she (a pretty girl) loses her chance when she’s young, she might as well throw all her prettiness away.”\n\nMADGE: “I’m only nineteen.”\n\nFLO: “And next summer you’ll be 20, and then 21, and then 40!”\n\nMADGE: “You don’t have to be morbid.”\n\nMadge then later has to endure this awkward conversation with her mother, where her mother essentially tells her to put out in order to seal the deal with Alan and secure him as a husband:\n\nFLO: “Madge, does Alan ever make love?”\n\nMADGE: “Sometimes we park the car by the river.”\n\nFLO: “Do you let him kiss you? After all, you’ve been going together all summer.”\n\nMADGE: “Of course I let him!”\n\nFLO: “Does…does he ever want to go beyond kissing?”\n\nMADGE: “Oh mom!”\n\nFLO: “Well I’m your mother for heaven’s sake…these things have to be talked about! Do you like it when he kisses you?”\n\nMADGE: “Yes.”\n\nFLO: “You don’t sound very enthusiastic.”\n\nMADGE: “Well, what do you expect me to do? Pass out every time Alan puts his arms around me?”\n\nFLO: “No. You don’t have to pass out. But there won’t be many more opportunities like the picnic tonight, and it seems to me you could at least–”\n\nMADGE: “What?!”\n\nAt the picnic, Flo sees that Hal is crushing on Madge and Madge is reciprocating. Madge and Hal’s attraction to one another is obvious when they dance to “Moonglow” at the picnic. Flo is worried that Madge’s attraction to Hal will get in the way of Madge’s relationship with Alan which would move her family up on the social ladder. Flo is also concerned about Hal’s influence on Millie.\n\n(One of the most romantic scenes in film)\n\nSome of the minor conflicts:\n\n2. Millie resents Madge getting all the attention because of her beauty. On the flip-side, Madge resents that Millie gets attention for being so smart and winning a full ride scholarship to college.\n\n3. Rosemary is jealous that Hal is only paying attention to the younger Madge and not interested in her.\n\n4. Alan is upset with Hal because his former fraternity buddy is obviously hot for his girlfriend. Alan wants Madge because she would look good on his arm (i.e. “A trophy wife”). Alan’s father doesn’t approve of Madge because her social standing is much lower then theirs.\n\nAll of these conflicts come to head at the annual Labor Day Picnic.\n\nI love this film. I am a sucker for the overwrought melodramas anyway and Picnic does not fail to deliver. This film has everything: shirtless William Holden, romantic dancing, a sexy “did they? or didn’t they?” love scene, a drunken breakdown, over-the-top dramatic scenes and much more–everything you’d want in a melodramatic film. It also offers one of the corniest, albeit creepiest, pick up lines in film history:\n\nALAN (to MADGE): “I want to see if you look real in the moonlight.”\n\n(Alan is obviously hinting to Madge that he wants to seal the deal too).\n\nIf you like any of the stars and/or melodramatic films, I highly recommend Picnic."
