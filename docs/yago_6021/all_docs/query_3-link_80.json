        "text": "Libby Purves is joined by former Speedway star Barry Briggs, actors Roberta Taylor and Peter Guinness, author Dacre Stoker, and bridge designer Richard La Trobe-Batemen.\n\nDacre Stoker is the great grand-nephew of Bram Stoker, author of Dracula. A long-lost journal written by the young Bram Stoker was recently discovered in the attic of his great grandson. The notebook reveals some of Bram's private thoughts and his developing style before he wrote Dracula. Assisted by a team of Dracula scholars and historians, Dacre Stoker and Dr Elizabeth Miller have connected the dots between the contents of the notebook and Stoker's later work. 'The Lost Journal of Bram Stoker' is published by Robson Press.\n\nBarry Briggs was one of the most accomplished and popular speedway riders of all time. Born in Christchurch, New Zealand, he came to the UK in the Fifties at 17 to pursue a speedway career and went on to win four World Championship titles. During his career 'Briggo' rode for top clubs including Wimbledon, Hull and Swindon, wowing crowds of 90,000. Along the way he taught Steve McQueen how to slide a speedway bike. His autobiography 'Wembley and Beyond - My Incredible Journey' is published by Sphere.\n\nRoberta Taylor and Peter Guinness are actors who met whilst at drama school. This real life couple are performing together in the play Reunion by John Caine, playing a couple in their sixties who are in the throes of a life or death decision. Peter's character has motor neurone disease and wants to end his life; however if he is to end it, he needs the help of his wife, played by Roberta. The couple debate the issues around assisted dying in their small kitchen over the course of 24 hours. Reunion is at London's Jermyn Street Theatre.\n\nRichard La Trobe-Bateman is a furniture maker who has now turned his skill and passion to designing bridges. He has built wooden bridges from the National Pinetum in Bedgebury to the Tassajara Monastery in California. His work is in public collections at the Victoria and Albert Museum, Crafts Council and Royal Society of the Arts. His latest exhibition, 'Making Triangles' is at the Crafts Study Centre, University for the Creative Arts, Farnham Surrey.\n\nProducer: Paula McGinley."
