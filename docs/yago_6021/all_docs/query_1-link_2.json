        "text": "Roberta sadly passed away on July 6 2024 and is survived by her husband Peter and her son.\n\nHere’s what we know about Peter Guinness, the actor who appeared in iconic films and TV shows.\n\nWho is Roberta Taylor's husband Peter Guinness?\n\nPeter Guinness was born in Whitstable, Kent in 1950.\n\nHe showed his creative streak from a young age and wanted to become an art teacher.\n\nHowever, while working in South London, he became interested in theatre.\n\nThis led him to apply to drama schools such as the Central School of Speech and Drama.\n\nHe graduated from the drama school in 1976, where he quickly became a huge presence in the UK drama scene.\n\nFans often mistake Peter for being related to Alec Guinness, but there is in fact no relation between the two men.\n\nHow did Roberta Taylor and Peter Guinness meet?\n\nBoth Peter and his wife applied to the Central School of Speech and Drama in 1973. However, they met properly some years later.\n\nRoberta was born in East London and, by the time she met Peter, had given birth to her son and divorced her husband Victor Taylor.\n\nRoberta and Peter ran into one another at the Glasgow Citizens Theatre, where they began dating.\n\nWhen did Roberta Taylor and Peter Guinness get married?\n\nThe couple dated for years before deciding to get married.\n\nEventually, they tied the knot in 1996, in a private ceremony.\n\nSoon after the couple got married, their star power began to rise.\n\nIn 1997, Roberta landed a role in Eastenders and Peter appeared in a Hollywood thriller called The Saint.\n\nDid Roberta Taylor and Peter Guinness have children?\n\nAlthough Robert and Peter did not have children together, they raised Roberta’s son, Elliot, from her first marriage.\n\nRoberta had Elliott with her first husband, Victor Taylor. Victor was a rope-maker and married Roberta in 1966.\n\nThe couple later divorced in 1975 and Roberta then went on to marry Peter.\n\nWhat has Peter Guinness starred in?\n\nPeter Guinness has starred in a range of TV shows and films, both in the UK and in America.\n\nHe had his film breakthrough with 1992’s Alien 3, where he played Gregor, and 1999’s Sleepy Hollow, where he played Lord Crane.\n\nIn 2023, he appeared in The Boys in the Boat which followed the American rowing team as they prepared for the 1936 Berlin Olympics.\n\nPeter also starred in ITV's beloved crime drama The Bill, alongside his wife.\n\nHe played the lover of Roberta’s character, Gina Gold.\n\nOn stage, he has appeared in adaptations of Arthur Miller’s The Crucible and Władysław Szpilman’s The Pianist."
