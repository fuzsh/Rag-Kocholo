        "text": "EastEnders star Roberta Taylor has died at the age of 76. The soap legend was best known for playing the role of matriach Irene Raymond on the BBC show from 1997 until 2000.\n\nShe later moved to ITV's The Bill, playing Inspector Gina Gold from 2002 to 2008. The actress - who had emphysema - died on July 6 after suffering a fall two months earlier.\n\nThe fall is said to have 'agitated her underlying ill health with pneumonia', The Guardian reports. Her last major TV series was comedy Shakespeare & Hathaway, which she starred in alongside Jo Joyner and Mark Benton.\n\nREAD MORE: Lauryn Goodman breaks silence on 'KW necklace' she wore at court to face Kyle Walker\n\nDon't miss the biggest and breaking stories by signing up to the BirminghamLive newsletter here.\n\nArriving in Albert Square in the 90s, Taylor's character Irene was the matriarch of the Hills family. She had stopped by to visit her estranged children Sarah, played by Daniela Denby-Ashe, and Tony, played by Mark Homer.\n\nOver her three years with the soap, Irene had an affair with toyboy Troy Harvey - played by Jamie Jarvis - and tried to resolve marriage issues with husband Terry Raymond, played by Gavin Richards. She previously told the Mirror: \"EastEnders has been a fantastic experience. But I'm pleased to be leaving. I was always thinking \"when can I learn my lines?\".\n\n\"I gave over much of my life to the show and if I was to carry on at such a pace I'd have to continue to put my life on hold. I didn't want to do things at half-cock.\"\n\nShe added: \"I had a lot of fun playing Irene, and Gavin, who plays my screen husband Terry, and I got on brilliantly. Irene was a complicated lady.\n\n\"I never knew what was going to happen next, but that's what life is like. We worked hard at our characters. People thought we were comical but actually there was a lot of sarcasm.\"\n\nBorn in Plaistow, east London, Taylor left school without any qualifications and took on secretarial work. She trained as a dental nurse while taking drama classes.\n\nShe leaves behind her actor husband Peter Guinness, son Elliott, a granddaughter and two stepbrothers."
