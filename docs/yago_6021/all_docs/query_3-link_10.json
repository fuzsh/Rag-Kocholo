        "text": "EastEnders and The Bill legend Roberta Taylor is seen in her final public appearance before her sad death at the age of 76. The star, who played Albert Square's Irene Raymond from 1997 until 2000 before joining The Bill as Inspector Gina Gold in 2021, died from an infection caused by a fall two months prior that agitated her underlying health problems.\n\nShe was last seen in public in February this year, taking part in a celebrity quiz hosted by Strictly's Claudia Winkleman and attended by a string of other famous faces including her former co-stars from The Bill, who will remain instantly recognisable to fans of the show.\n\nRoberta was pictured with Cyril Nri, who was Spt Adam Okaro, Patrick Robinson, who played DC Jacob Banks and also appeared in Casualty, and Trudie Goodwin, who was Sergeant June Ackland.\n\nAlso taking part were Chris Simmons aka DC Mickey Webb, Lisa Maxwell, who was DI Samantha Nixon, and her husband Peter Guinness, who himself played multiple characters in The Bill.\n\nThey all took part in the Centrepoint Ultimate Quiz 2024 in February this year, nearly 15 years after The Bill disappeared from screens after more than two decades on ITV.\n\nRoberta's death was revealed last night - sparking an outpouring of tributes from her friends and co-stars. EastEnders released a statement this morning, saying: \"Weâ€™re deeply saddened to hear that Roberta Taylor has passed away.\n\n\"Roberta made an impact with audiences from the first moment she arrived in Albert Square with her performance as the formidable Irene Raymond. Roberta will always be remembered fondly by everyone that worked with her and our love and thoughts go to her family and friends.\"\n\nDiana Parish, 54, who plays Denise Fox in EastEnders, replied, calling her: \"An incredible, kind and fiercely talented woman\" before adding: \"Rest in Peace.\""
