        "text": "I loved Irene when she first came in, I thought she was hilarious. Then she got with Terry and at first it really worked. Fantastically trashy. Then the writers made her the sensible, long suffering one, and her character went drastically downhill for me. Shame. As for her coming back, nah probably not. Would she even know anyone who's there now? Maybe Phil and Ian apart?\n\n0\n\nI loved Irene but frankly there is no room for her at present. The show needs to put some focus in bringing in young, fresh new characters now. I cannot see why she would return anyway, unless it was with Sarah.\n\n0\n\nWhy? EE needs new characters not resurrected old ones.\n\nAnd we do get new ones, constantly. Why do some people think we can't have both?\n\nWould love to see Irene again, but without throwing her into a completely new setting and characters she's not familiar with (which could work wonderfully, juxtaposing with the fact she's also Kathy's former sister-in-law), I can't see it happening without Terry's link to Courtney or one of Tony or Sarah returning first - as Kathy's niece and nephew, this is more likely.\n\n0\n\never since the carters have come in I have always wanted Irene to return. because Irene's maiden name is carter. I would love if Irene turned out to be Stan's niece and Shirley and Tina's first cousin. I think Sarah and Joe should also return. she would have plenty family and I would have her work in Beale's a bit like Sheila working in Lassiters in neighbours. I would make Elaine a regular and have Elaine, Irene, Kathy, Pam, Carol and Glenda( if she returns which I think she should) as friends regularly meeting in the Vic for a drink. I really do think that Irene would have real purpose in eastenders if she does return. dtc please bring back Irene and Glenda and make Elaine a regular if u are reading this.:)\n\n0\n\nThis is not a very well worded question, the only way this question can ever be answered is \"Yes should could return, the character is not dead\"\n\nA better question may be:\n\n\"Would the return of the character Irene Raymond, played by Roberta Taylor, ever be beneficial to Eastenders?\" or something similar.\n\n0\n\nTerry and Irene were one of the best and most realistic married couples EE has ever had. I wouldn't want her to return (she has no reason to, and so it would feel awfully contrived) but both characters are underrated.\n\n0\n\nOh whatever\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/uT48k.png\n\nDoes it really matterhow badly worded my question is? It's just a bloody forum>:(\n\nWell yes, of course it does.\n\nIf you want a question to create debate you need a question that creates debate and not one that can only be answered in one way.\n\n0\n\nWell yes, of course it does.\n\nIf you want a question to create debate you need a question that creates debate and not one that can only be answered in one way.\n\nAnd yet the discussion is happening away.\n\nThis is a forum for people to come along, chill and talk about soaps. I don't see the point in arguing about some bad grammar. Not everyone on this planet can be well educated, bear in mind that there are those on this forum who could easily suffer with learning difficulties and they don't need the likes of you rubbing it in their faces.\n\n0\n\nAnd yet the discussion is happening away.\n\nThis is a forum for people to come along, chill and talk about soaps.

I type fast and therefore always have some kind of typo somewhere and don't have anythingn said to me apart from that Alfie join which tbh I found halarious.\n\nNot everyone has the perfect education and many male typos and it shouldn't make a difference\n\n0\n\nI wasn't complaining about grammar or spelling....\n\nI was pointing out that the question, if taken at face value can only have one answer. I don't think i rubbed anything in anyones faces or made any comment about education, special needs, dyslexia or whatever else it is you think you can accuse me of.\n\nThe question could only have one answer - the answer being that yes she could.\n\nI didn't personally attack anyone (as others have done on here, calling me names).\n\n0"
