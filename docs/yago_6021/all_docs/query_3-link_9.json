        "text": "EastEnders star Roberta Taylor, best known for her role as Irene Raymond in the long-running soap, died this week at the age of 76.\n\nThe star, also known for her role as Inspector Gina Gold in the popular ITV crime soap drama The Bill, left behind her actor husband Peter Guinness, her son Elliott, a granddaughter and two stepbrothers. Her last major TV series appearance came on the private investigator's comedy Shakespeare & Hathaway.\n\nShe joined EastEnders in 1997 and left in 2000. The actress was introduced as the matriarch of the Hills family who stopped by to visit her estranged kids Sarah (Daniela Denby-Ashe) and Tony (Mark Homer). Roberta went through many storylines over the years and had a few love interests, including with Terry Raymond (Gavin Richards).\n\nAfter her death was announced, friends and fans rushed to social media to pay tribute. But how did she die? Roberta suffered from lung disease emphysema and passed away on 6 July after a fall a couple of months ago led to the infection. The actress's condition got worse and she caught pneumonia.\n\nTributes poured in after her death, with actor Nicholas Pegg writing on X: \"Beautiful, brilliant Roberta Taylor. Adored by millions for her roles in The Bill and EastEnders. Outstanding in Shakespeare, Inspector Morse, and all points in between. A mighty raconteur, a demon at Scrabble, and a dear friend. Thoughts are with her family and her beloved Pete.”\n\nStory producer on EastEnders, Kyri Zindilis, posed: “Devastated to hear this – I adored Irene Raymond. We have this picture printed out and up on the wall in the Story Department, and it always makes me smile. RIP Roberta Taylor.” Former co-star on The Bill, Stuart Antony penned: \"Sad to hear lovely Roberta Taylor has passed away. She was a joy to work with and always great fun when I saw her - RIP x\"\n\nWhen Roberta departed the Walford Cobbles in 2000, she chatted with the Mirror about her time on the show and said: \"I was always thinking, 'When can I learn my lines?' I gave over much of my life to the show and if I was to carry on at such a pace I'd have to continue to put my life on hold.\n\n\"I didn't want to do things at half-cock [...] I had a lot of fun playing Irene, and Gavin, who plays my screen husband Terry, and I got on brilliantly. Irene was a complicated lady. I never knew what was going to happen next, but that's what life is like. We worked hard at our characters. People thought we were comical but actually there was a lot of sarcasm.\""
