        "text": "EastEnders icon Roberta Taylor, famed for her stint as Irene Raymond on the square, has passed away at 76.\n\nRoberta was claimed to have succumbed to an infection following a fall that exacerbated existing health complications with pneumonia two months earlier.\n\nBest known aside from her EastEnders fame for portraying Inspector Gina Gold in the popular police series The Bill, Roberta is survived by her actor husband Peter Guinness, her son Elliott, a granddaughter and two stepbrothers. Her final major TV gig was on the detective comedy Shakespeare and Hathaway.\n\nREAD MORE: EastEnders legend cryptically hints 'crew are more my friends than anyone else' on set\n\nREAD MORE: Click for more brilliant Daily Star TV stories\n\nRoberta's gig on EastEnders kicked off in 1997 and she waved goodbye to Albert Square in 2000. She first popped up as the head of the Hills family, dropping in on her distant offspring Sarah (played by Daniela Denby-Ashe) and Tony (portrayed by Mark Homer).\n\nDuring her drama-packed spell on the show, she juggled multiple love interests, including Terry Raymond (played by Gavin Richards), and even sparked a saucy affair with her tenant Troy Harvey (Jamie Jarvis), reports the Mirror.\n\nTalking about her departure back in the day, Roberta spilled to the Mirror: \"I was always thinking, 'When can I learn my lines? ' I gave over much of my life to the show and if I was to carry on at such a pace I'd have to continue to put my life on hold.\"\n\n\"I didn't want to do things at half-cock [...] I had a lot of fun playing Irene, and Gavin, who plays my screen husband Terry, and I got on brilliantly. Irene was a complicated lady. I never knew what was going to happen next, but that's what life is like. We worked hard at our characters. People thought we were comical but actually there was a lot of sarcasm.\"\n\nHer career wasn't just limited to soap operas; she graced the screen in Silent Witness, Inspector Morse, Doctors, and her final act was in the gritty Luther in 2019.\n\nFollowing the announcement of her passing, the internet has been awash with heartfelt tributes. Stuart Antony, her former colleague from The Bill, took to Twitter/X to say: \"Sad to hear lovely Roberta Taylor has passed away. She was a joy to work with and always great fun when I saw her - RIP x\".\n\nA fan reminisced: \"Sad news about the passing of Roberta Taylor. Gina Gold was one of my favourite TV characters growing up and I still think of her one liners, some well needed comic relief in what could be a pretty heavy episode.\"\n\nAnother shared their sorrow: \"Heartbreaking news. RIP Roberta Taylor, one of the finest actors this country has ever seen. Thinking about her family, friends and fellow fans.\"\n\nThis is a breaking news story and is being constantly updated.
