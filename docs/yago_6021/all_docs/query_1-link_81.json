        "text": "Tributes have been paid to an EastEnders actress who has died at the age of 76.\n\nRoberta Taylor played Irene Raymond on the soap for three years between 1997 and 2000 and was part of several dramatic storylines including when her husband-to-be Terry's first wife announced they were still married.\n\nToday's top videos\n\nAnnouncing the news of her death on Wednesday, Roberta's agent Roxane Vacaa said: 'Sadly I can confirm that Roberta died on 6 July. She was 76.'\n\nAccording to the Guardian, Roberta suffered from emphysema. They reported that she had a fall two months ago and developed pneumonia.\n\nA tribute to Roberta shared on the EastEnders Facebook account read: 'We’re deeply saddened to hear that Roberta Taylor has passed away. Roberta made an impact with audiences from the first moment she arrived in Albert Square with her performance as the formidable Irene Raymond.\n\n'Roberta will always be remembered fondly by everyone who worked with her and our love and thoughts go to her family and friends.'\n\nFans of the show also shared tributes to Roberta, with one writing: 'One of my favourite characters… ever! Brilliant actress that will be missed.' Another said: 'Brilliant actress who could show her hand at drama and comedy in the same line.'\n\nEastEnders producer Kyri Zindilis also paid tribute to Roberta, writing: 'Devastated to hear this - I adored Irene Raymond. We have this picture printed out and up on the wall in the Story Department, and it always makes me smile. RIP Robert Taylor.'\n\nRoberta's EastEnders character Irene arrived at Albert Square in 1997 to reconnect with her children Sarah and Tony after her estranged husband Ted moved to South Africa.\n\nShe then found love with Terry and after their colourful start to her life together the couple went on to run the Square's grocers and Irene embarked on an affair with Troy in 1999 which came to a head in the Christmas episode.\n\nAfter her time on EastEnders, Roberta joined the cast of The Bill where she played Inspector Gina Gold for six years. She also starred in TV shows such as Casualty and Inspector Morse.\n\nRoberta is survived by her second husband Peter Guinness, her son Elliott, and her granddaughter Ellis."
