        "text": "EastEnders star Roberta Taylor's cause of death had been reported as tributed poured in for the star. The acting legend, who was best known for her role as Irene Raymond on the BBC soap from 1997 to 2007, died at the age of 76 on July 6.\n\nRoberta, also well known for playing Inspector Gina Gold in The Bill, had faced health issues in the months before her death. The Guardian reported that she had died 'from an infection caused by a fall two months prior, agitating her underlying health problems with pneumonia.'\n\nShe leaves behind her actor husband Peter Guinness, her son Elliott, a granddaughter and two stepbrothers. Roberta's last TV appearance came on the BBC private investigators comedy Shakespeare & Hathaway.\n\nRead more Channel 4 Hunted star dies 'unexpectedly' at home\n\nReflecting on her departure from Albert Square in 2000, Taylor spoke to the Mirror, expressing how the show demanded much of her time: \"I was always thinking, 'When can I learn my lines? ' I gave over much of my life to the show and if I was to carry on at such a pace I'd have to continue to put my life on hold.\n\n\"I didn't want to do things at half-cock [...] I had a lot of fun playing Irene, and Gavin, who plays my screen husband Terry, and I got on brilliantly. Irene was a complicated lady. I never knew what was going to happen next, but that's what life is like. We worked hard at our characters. People thought we were comical but actually there was a lot of sarcasm.\"\n\nRoberta also had roles in dramas Silent Witness, Inspector Morse and Doctors. News of Roberta's death sparked a spring of tributes from fans, with posts on X including: \"Such sad news about Roberta Taylor she was fantastic in EastEnders and The Bill. Rest in peace.\"\n\nAnother fan wrote: \"Heartbreaking news. RIP Roberta Taylor, one of the finest actors this country has ever seen. Thinking about her family, friends and fellow fans.\""
