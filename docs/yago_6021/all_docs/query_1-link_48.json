        "text": "Roberta Conlyn Taylor PORTER CORNERS – Roberta Taylor, 76, of Plank Road in Porter Corners died Tuesday, November 3, 2015. She was in her home, surrounded by her family after living a long fulfilling life. She was a dedicated loving wife, mother and grandmother. Born in Troy, New York on August 1, 1939, she was the daughter of Robert and Marion Conlyn. Roberta,(Bobbie) grew up and went to high school in Williamstown, Massachusetts. She later attended University of Massachusetts at Amherst. She married Gordon R. Taylor and they served as house parents at the Charlton School for Girls for several years. They then moved to Porter Corners where they raised their family and lived happily. Roberta enjoyed spending time with her children and grandchildren, bird watching, reading, gardening and knitting. Over the years she made friends working part time jobs and was involved in charitable projects such as the Scouts, Meals on Wheels and knitting caps for babies in the hospital. Roberta was predeceased by her husband Gordon of 44 years and her sister Lois Sweener. She is survived by her brother Craig Conlyn and the families of her five children: Wendy Taylor, Earl(Clay)Taylor, Matthew Taylor, Beth Ballester and Marion Gyarmathy and eleven grandchildren. At Roberta’s request a private, family memorial service will be held on Saturday, November 7, 2015. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made to St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital, #2 Pines West Plaza, Suite 202, Albany, NY 12205."
