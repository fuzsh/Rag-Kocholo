        "text": "Roberta Taylor, the actress, who has died aged 76 after suffering from emphysema, brought both integrity, gained from a long theatre career, and a gravelly voice and no-nonsense persona to two of television’s most popular dramas, as Irene Raymond in EastEnders and the hard-living Inspector Gina Gold in The Bill.\n\n“I’m glad Irene is having a bit of fun, although it wouldn’t be my style,” she said of Irene, who took a toyboy, during her three-year run from 1997 in EastEnders. “I’ve never met a teenager with much to say. There’s gotta be something up here [tapping her head] before there’s anything down there!”\n\nRoberta Taylor’s character arrived in Albert Square as Irene Hills, a divorcee reconnecting with her estranged children, Sarah and Tony. After Irene married Terry Raymond, a recovering alcoholic, they ran the grocery store First Til Last, but she could not resist the temptations of their young lodger, Troy Harvey.\n\nTerry eventually twigged and evicted him. Although he forgave Irene, life was never the same and Terry called his wife’s bluff by offering her money to leave and travel the world. To his shock, she accepted and left. Nevertheless, two years later, he headed for Portugal after she told him on the phone that they should give their marriage another chance.\n\nSoon afterwards, Roberta Taylor was making a big impression in The Bill. On Gina Gold’s arrival at Sun Hill police station in 2002, the new inspector steps out of her car and stamps out a cheroot before popping another into her mouth. Walking into her office, she stashes a bottle of whisky in her desk and gives her ashtray pride of place on top.\n\nViewers knew they had a tough character in their midst who had no wish to make friends. “I’ll have your nuts in a jar!” she tells one officer. Alongside this, her formidable alcohol intake leads her to be caught drink-driving, though she is saved by a colleague rigging the test results; and, on another occasion, she is suspended for drinking on duty. Inspector Gold also weathers accusations of bullying from a young female constable.\n\nGold never lets down her hard-as-nails guard, even when diagnosed with cervical cancer, followed by chemotherapy; but a string of colleagues’ deaths begins to affect her and she resigns with stress in 2008.\n\nThe actress was born Roberta Alexandra Mary Roberts on February 26 1948 in Plaistow, East London, to Winifred Roberts, a trolley-bus conductor, and Robert Archer. Until she was five, she and her mother lived with her grandmother, grandfather, four aunts and an uncle.\n\n“I’m illegitimate,” she said. “I met my father quite a few times – he was a married man, [also] a bus conductor, and unable to marry my mum even though she loved him.”\n\nWhen Roberta was five, her mother married Arthur Marney, had two more children, Bill and Lionel, and the family lived in Millwall on the Isle of Dogs. She recalled her childhood – especially the many women around her – in her unsentimental 2006 autobiography, Too Many Mothers: A Memoir of an East End Childhood.\n\nOn leaving Sir Humphrey Gilbert School, Stepney, at 15 with no qualifications, she worked in secretarial jobs, then trained as a dental nurse. She also took drama classes at Toynbee Hall, Whitechapel (“The world opened up like a huge envelope for me,” she said), married Victor Taylor in 1966 and had a son, Elliott, but the marriage ended in divorce in 1976.\n\nIn the same year, she joined the Citizens Theatre, Glasgow, after training at the Central School of Speech and Drama, where she taught Rupert Everett how to apply make-up – and met Peter Guinness: they eventually married in 1996.\n\nGaining a grounding at the Citizens had been her ambition since seeing photographs of performances there. “They were doing plays I had never heard of – all European theatre,” she said.\n\nAuditioning in the role of an old woman in a 1930s nightdress, plastered in make-up, with 50 plaits in her long hair and nothing on her feet, did not impress. Asked to return with a different speech, she was successful, staying on and off until 1995.\n\nOne of her first plays was The Seven Deadly Sins by Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill. She recalled: “My whole performance was in bra, knickers and a bunch of balloons, and doing naughty things with the pantomime donkey.”\n\nShe soon showed a talent for injecting a subversive streak into classic material. The Financial Times’s critic praised her “chunky, impulsive, outrageously camp on occasion, statuesque, funny” Amanda in Noël Coward’s Private Lives (1984). Then, she was a memorable Mrs Cheveley, uttering a four-letter expletive, in Oscar Wilde’s An Ideal Husband (1986).\n\nLater in Glasgow, she played the sex worker Yvette, in red platform-sole lace-up boots, in Brecht’s Mother Courage (1990), alongside Glenda Jackson, and travelled with the production when it transferred to the Mermaid Theatre, London.\n\nHer other notable stage roles included Catherine Petkoff in George Bernard Shaw’s Arms and the Man at the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester (1989), and the nurse in Romeo and Juliet (Lyric, Hammersmith, 1995).\n\nIn 2014 she returned to the Citizens as Gertrude in Hamlet, opposite her husband Peter Guinness playing Claudius. Guinness was also her boyfriend for a time in The Bill (2006-07).\n\nRoberta Taylor’s final stage role was on a 2018 tour of Jonathan Harvey’s jukebox musical Dusty as Dusty Springfield’s slyly subverting mother.\n\nHer last television part, between 2018 and 2020, was as the theatrical costumier Gloria Fonteyn in Shakespeare & Hathaway: Private Investigators.\n\nShe is survived by Peter Guinness, along with her son.\n\nRoberta Taylor, born February 26 1948, died July 6 2024"
