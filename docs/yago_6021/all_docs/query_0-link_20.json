        "text": "Roberta Taylor discusses the end of The Bill in 2010\n\nRoberta Taylor has died following a prolonged infection the actress could not overcome, according to reports. The EastEnders actress, who was also famed for her role on The Bill, has died aged 76.\n\nThe actress suffered from emphysema and had a fall two months ago which is believed to have agitated her underlying ill health with pneumonia. The on-screen star reportedly died earlier this month on July 6.\n\nThe star, also known for her role as Inspector Gina Gold in the long-running ITV crime soap drama The Bill, leaves behind her actor husband Peter Guinness, her son Elliott, a granddaughter and two stepbrothers.\n\nHer last major TV series appearance came on the private investigator's comedy Shakespeare & Hathaway.\n\nTributes have poured in online as fans offered their condolences to the late actress.\n\nREAD MORE BBC 'in crisis' as half a million viewers switch off and cancel licence fee\n\nOne person penned: \"Heartbreaking news.

It is in the Isle of Dogs that she was raised by her mother Winifred Roberts, grandma and aunties.\n\nShe began her career as a dental nurse but continued to take drama classes in her spare time.\n\nRoberta tied the knot with married ropemaker Victor Taylor in 1966, and the couple had a son, Elliott, in the same year. In 1973, a friend urged her to audition for drama school, where she would go on to meet her second husband Peter Guinness.\n\nShe refined her acting skills working for the Glasgow Citizens Theatre from 1980 to 1992.\n\nDuring this period she was cast in A Waste of Time, in which her co-stars were Rupert Everett and Gary Oldman.\n\nRoberta's time in Walford began in 1997 and lasted until 2000, where she played Irene Raymond. She was introduced as the matriarch of the Hills family who stopped by to visit her estranged kids Sarah (Daniela Denby-Ashe) and Tony (Mark Homer).\n\nShe had several love interests on the BBC soap including a dalliance with Terry Raymond (Gavin Richards). She also engaged in an affair with her lodger Troy Harvey (Jamie Jarvis) in a drama-filled stint on the London-based soap.\n\nThe actress landed another high-profile role when she jumped ship and appeared in ITV's series The Bill (2002-08), as the hard-drinking, no-nonsense Inspector Gina Gold.\n\nAway from the two popular soaps, Roberta's impressive CV saw her star on the likes of Silent Witness, Inspector Morse and Doctors.\n\nHer last acting job came in 2019, where she played a role on the crime drama series Luther."
