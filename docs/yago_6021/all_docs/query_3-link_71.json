        "text": "EastEnders and The Bill actress Roberta Taylor, famed for her portrayal of Irene Raymond in the BBC soap, has died at the age of 76. It is understood that the actress died after contracting an infection that developed following a fall two months earlier, which exacerbated her pre-existing health issues, including pneumonia.\n\nBest remembered as well for her role as Inspector Gina Gold in ITV's The Bill, Roberta leaves behind a loving family: her husband, actor Peter Guinness, her son Elliott, a granddaughter, and two stepbrothers. Her final significant television role was in the comedy series Shakespeare and Hathaway.\n\nJoining EastEnders in 1997, Roberta became a central figure until her departure in 2000. As the head of the Hills family, she arrived in Walford to reconnect with her estranged children, Sarah (played by Daniela Denby-Ashe) and Tony (portrayed by Mark Homer).\n\nREAD MORE: Couple's sandwich van was so popular they now run a restaurant\n\nDON'T MISS: I ate at Carmarthen's new restaurant and you won't be able to keep me away\n\nDuring her tenure on the show, Roberta's character had several romantic entanglements, notably with Terry Raymond (played by Gavin Richards), and even an affair with her lodger Troy Harvey (Jamie Jarvis), adding to the drama of her time in the fictional London borough, reports the Mirror.\n\nReflecting on her decision to leave EastEnders, Roberta previously shared with the Mirror: \"I was always thinking, 'When can I learn my lines? ' I gave over much of my life to the show and if I was to carry on at such a pace I'd have to continue to put my life on hold.\"\n\n\"I didn't want to do things at half-cock [...] I had a lot of fun playing Irene, and Gavin, who plays my screen husband Terry, and I got on brilliantly. Irene was a complicated lady. I never knew what was going to happen next, but that's what life is like. We worked hard at our characters. People thought we were comical but actually there was a lot of sarcasm.\" Join our WhatsApp news community here for the latest breaking news\n\nRoberta whose acting career spanned several acclaimed television series including Silent Witness, Inspector Morse, and Doctors, last graced the screen in 2019 with a role in the crime drama Luther.\n\nThe entertainment world mourns the loss of Roberta as fans express their sorrow on social media. Stuart Antony, a former The Bill co-star, shared his condolences on Twitter/X: \"Sad to hear lovely Roberta Taylor has passed away. She was a joy to work with and always great fun when I saw her - RIP x\".\n\nA fan reminisced about Taylor's impact: \"Sad news about the passing of Roberta Taylor. Gina Gold was one of my favourite TV characters growing up and I still think of her one liners, some well needed comic relief in what could be a pretty heavy episode.\"\n\nAnother expressed their grief: \"Heartbreaking news. RIP Roberta Taylor, one of the finest actors this country has ever seen. Thinking about her family, friends and fellow fans.\""
