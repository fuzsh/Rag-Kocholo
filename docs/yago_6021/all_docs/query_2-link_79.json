        "text": "Roberta (Berta) Taylor, 86, died on January 30, 2022 at Bee Hive Homes Assisted Living in Kalispell. She was born April 10, 1935 in Wolf Point, Montana to Milo “Emery” and Virginia Ren. Roberta was a twin to Robert “Bob” Ren and they were number 4 and 5 of 7 children. Roberta was married to Delphin “Del” Gunderson in Columbia Falls on April 29, 1955, and they had 2 sons, Steve and Scott Gunderson. Del preceded Berta in death on December 31, 1982. Roberta and Jim Taylor were later married on May 5th, 1984. Roberta and Jim enjoyed life together until Jim passed on June 27th, 2011. Roberta reconnected with a longtime friend Howard Paullin and the two were inseparable. They danced, golfed, power walked, did road trips and greatly enjoyed life together. Sadly Howard passed away on Oct 4th, 2019.\n\nRoberta continued to live life and devote herself to her Lord and Savior and was truly a cherished member of the Church of God and regularly gave of herself so that others not so fortunate could be helped through the church. Roberta was a very active member of the Lincoln County Republican Club and active with local politics. Berta was a wonderfully dedicated volunteer at the Libby Community Thrift Store for many years. She served as President and was instrumental in the yearly scholarship donation to Libby High School. The isolation created by the last 2 years took its toll on her as she was not able to stay as active as she had. She passed peacefully surrounded by family and friends. Berta went to her Lord with a clear mind, knowing she will meet with family and friends.\n\nRoberta is preceded in death by her parents and siblings Doug, John, Will, Bob, Mike and Terry.\n\nSurvivors include her sons, Steve (Cherie) Gunderson, Libby; and Scott (Linda) Gunderson, Kalispell; grandsons Dustin, Kalispell; and Jason, Livingston; Ryan, Missouri; great grandkids Clayton and Hadley.\n\nCelebration of Life to be held February 12, 2022 at 11:00 am at the Church of God church, 1007 Utah Ave, Libby, MT. In Lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the Church of God or the Libby Community Thrift Store so they may continue doing God's work in Robert's name. Arrangements are by Schnackenberg Funeral Home in Libby. Online condolences and memories may be shared at www.schnackenbergfh.com."
