        "text": "November 26, 2018\n\nCarter replicates A Princess of Mars (of course) with a plot arc traversing multiple books. This is not a bad idea in itself, but it means that there's no satisfying payoff at any level for this particular book: romantic interest Princess Darloona reluctantly accepts Jandar's presence at best, the Black Legion has captured the princess and her home city, and Jandar and his compatriots have not (yet) achieved distinction and social success. Their actual successes are necessary but not exactly showpieces, and are usually achieved at cost. Jandar's stupid mistakes give the opportunity to redeem himself, but they don't cover the fact that he keeps making stupid mistakes.\n\nLin Carter's writing style, here, is blessedly free of author intrusion, but there is little attempt to amaze the reader. The story diverges into discussions of the way the sky glows to simulate daylight, or the mechanism of the preposterous flying pirate ships, when a simple handwave would do. Edgar Rice Burroughs had the ability to detect when reader interest was flagging and would change things up by introducing something weird or something exciting. Of all of Lin Carter's shortcomings, his lack of self-criticism has always been the most glaring.\n\nThis reread, after quite a bit more bad sword-and-planet stories, has put the book in more context, but it reveals that \"stretch it out\" is not the thing to do with A Princess of Mars.\n\nJune 28, 2011\n\nAmazing! Just found this in my local hole-in-the-wall used bookstore. It's totally awesome. The first of a series but the store only had this and I think #4 (Mind Wizards of Callisto). Gotta hunt up the rest. I feel like I could read the whole series (six books I think) in about a weekend. Out of print these days I think. It's an ERB-type thing about a military guy in Vietnam who gets whisked away to Cllisto, one of Jupiter's moons, there to encounter six-legged tigers, evil bad guys, red-leafed plants and, of course, a moon princess who's a total hottie. God I'm a sucker for this stuff. Why isn't THIS being made into a movie?\n\nJune 17, 2015\n\nThis book was a fun and somewhat fresh take on Burroughs' A Princess of Mars. Pretty much the same formula, but new environment. Some of the elements are certainly contrived and a bit of a stretch to get the protagonist to fit into the John Carter mold. Certainly it would be rare that someone going to war in Vietnam would have had fencing practice as a kid, but just go with it. This is not high literature, it's a fun adventure.\n\nIf you're looking for more Barsoom-esque tales, here you go.\n\nAugust 31, 2015\n\nMore than simply \"inspired by\" the John Carter novels of Edgar Rice Burroughs, this is still a fun example of the sword and planet sub-genre from one of fantasy's great \"hacks\"--and I use that word with great respect, believe it or not. Jandar of Callisto succeeds at being good old fashioned goofy FUN.\n\nMarch 30, 2017\n\nLin Carter does it again. By “It” I mean he disappoints.\n\nI'll say right at the start that this is the best thing I've probably read from him, largely because he chose to try and “pay homage” to an adventure writer. Yes, this book is “dedicated with respect and affection to” Edgar Rice Burroughs. This book came out in 1972, which made it one of many series from around that time to pay similar homage.\n\nLin Carter's hero, Jon Dark, joins the likes of Dray Prescot, Tarl Cabot, (to a lesser extent) Dr. Zanthar, and others who followed in the shadow of John Carter. Anybody who has read the Barsoom series knows what's coming, which may leave them (as it did me) just a tad impatient.\n\nLet's set comparison aside for just a second though.\n\nThis book basically has three prologues: the first, in which Lin Carter tells us he is a wonderful author, but he did not write this, the second, in which air-force guy Gary Hoyt says that all the boys in Vietnam love his wonderful Thongor books and that his missing friend Jon Dark vanished and left this mysterious manuscript, and finally the third, in which Jon Dark narrates his early life at length in order to explain how he wound up in Cambodia and why he is such a masculine badass (somehow he holds off telling how much he likes Thongor until later).\n\nThe result is that 43 pages go by before our sword-and-planet hero actually gets to the planet.\n\nAnyhow, he gradually realizes he's on Jupiter's moon, Callisto (and admits that he can't figure out why it has an atmosphere), he becomes the slave of the insect/humanoid Yathoon horde, somehow befriends Koja, their leader, and in no time, Princess Darloona shows up for Jon Dark (or Jandar, as they call him there) to fall in love with.\n\nLike I said before, this is probably the best thing I've read from Lin Carter, and this is due entirely to the Edgar Rice Burroughs influence forcing him to include escapes, sword fights, mishap, peril, etc. Essentially, most of the sci-fi/adventure/fantasy things that are missing in more of Carter's “exciting” stories actually appear. The problem is that he uses them all begrudgingly and not very well.\n\nThe effectiveness of Burroughs stories, any of his stories, was not just the use of planets or inventions or creatures, but a heightened sense of drama carried through by the hero's sense of heightened longing and desperation. Jon Dark's motivations are there from time to time, but he does not seem to possess the crystal-clear tunnel vision that kept John Carter ravaging Mars from pole to pole looking for Dejah Thoris.\n\nPart of the problem is that the romance is never quite there. Romantic love seems like an alien thing to Lin Carter, probably because that would take time away from him describing clothes and settings and listing colors. Princess Darloona is put off by Jon Dark because of social errors (much like Dejah Thoris was), but she never seems to get over it and she remains an object of desire only.\n\nAnother issue is that Jon Dark is never really a badass of any description. He passes through many of the kinds of situations that a Burroughs hero would, only he just isn't as good. The lengthy early chapter seems to make this guy a ready-made action hero, and yet he isn't really a man of action and doesn't win any fights, at least not at first. The book is more than half gone before he actually manages to slay one of his foes (notice I was “checking my watch”), but shortly thereafter he meets a sword-master and sorta sharpens up.\n\nI'm probably rattling on too long about this, but I will add that most of the book is bogged down in description and that Jon Dark has a long sword fight in which he tries to write his name on the other guy's chest because he's suddenly decided he's awesome.\n\nLin Carter wrote 7 sequels to this. I own some of them. I doubt I'll read them.\n\nMarch 30, 2017\n\nJandar of Callisto is dedicated to Edgar Rice Burroughs. Author Lin Carter was obviously an ERB aficionado and, in writing this science (and I use the term loosely) fantasy pulp adventure series, he has assembled an incredible homage to the master of the genre. As with Burroughs’ own pastiche of himself (perhaps, not intended, but it comes off so) in the Carson of Venus series, we have a manuscript delivered to the author, purporting to be from the protagonist of the adventure. Naturally, the latter is using the same structure as the John Carter of Mars, the author acts as either editor or “medium” in publishing the story. Although Carson Napier has a rocket go awry, it is launched from a third world location. John Carter found hieroglyphics in a desert cave. Jon Dark finds an abandoned well in a Cambodian village) which causes him to be teleported to a location in space. John Carter, of course, finds himself on a version of Mars which couldn’t exist while Carson finds a version of Venus which couldn’t exist and Jon Dark finds himself on a version of Jupiter’s moon, Callisto, that couldn’t exist.\n\nIn that regard is why one uses the term “science” loosely in even calling these science-fantasy. The fantasy element is that just as ERB created societies on a dying Mars and a mysteriously fecund Venus, Lin Carter creates a society of warrior protocol and airships on Callisto. John Carter has Dejah Thoris, Carson Napier has his Princess Duare, and, of course, Jon Dark (aka “Jandar”) quickly meets his Princess Darloona (Why do these women always start with “D?”). You know before you start reading that either the Princess or both Jandar and the Princess will be captives more than once and you know before you start that the earthman protagonist is going to have some kind of physical advantage due to having been transplanted to worlds of different gravity and atmosphere. As a result, you know that the protagonist is going to win an improbable one-on-one duel at some point. There is even the obligatory gladiator-style scene, though I enjoyed the images in this one even more than one I remember from the John Carter series (The Chessmen of Mars as memory serves me).\n\nWhen I started the book, I thought Lin Carter was doing a slavish imitation of ERB. Upon completing the book, I can say that in spite of all the homage scenes (and characters), there is enough freshness to make it interesting. I can’t explain what I mean without spoiling part of the book, but the relationship between Darloona and Jandar is handled differently (and much more interestingly). Even though the structure is ERB-compatible (I just made up that term for my own amusement), it is full of clever ideas in terms of settings, society, and suspense. After all, Jandar of Callisto doesn’t exactly resolve everything you would expect at the conclusion. It leaves room for more adventure and entertainment. It's yet another light, escapist series I will be collecting.\n\nSeptember 18, 2022\n\nDetta är en portalfantasy, vilket klassar den som en fabelfantasy, men den är väldigt annorlunda än det mesta i genren som jag har läst. Huvudpersonen hör hemma i Sword & Sandal, världen är satt på en annan planet, och med en teknologisk nivå som varierar mellan bronsålder och steam-punk. Den är välskriven, som genrelitteratur.\n\nMarch 7, 2018\n\nQuick and entertaining read. Fun Swords and Planet story. If you are a John Carter of mars fan these are a good read. Recommended\n\nJuly 4, 2016\n\nThis was the first novel by Lin Carter I'd ever read. I wanted to like it, but by the halfway point I was worn out by Carter's windy and overblown style. Although it strives to be colorful and imaginative, the ideas often seemed lazy and uninspiring, and the actual reading experience at times was like being hit over the head with a pocket thesaurus. It's clear that Carter enjoys writing - so much so that he seeks out ways of being overly wordy and forcing his readers to re-read the same cliches and phrases over, and over. Gary Provost once said that good writing is writing in which every word is doing a job. If that's the litmus test then this novel falls short in my view. I really felt at one point like I was reading a very impressive 7th grade creative writing project. I don't want to sound overly critical, and I think anyone who is looking for a fun and light adventure story will enjoy this. To be fair, the story is truly fantastic in its scope and quickly thrusts the reader into a larger-than-life adventure. And perhaps I would've enjoyed it more if my expectations had been a little lower. For me, however, it was a disappointment, though I will probably give Lin Carter another shot at some point in the future.\n\nAugust 24, 2016\n\nIf you like Edgar Rice Burroughs Mars series then this is right up your alley. It is pretty much a fanboy kind of story which mirrors the Mars stories alot. Lots of adventure, a princess, and good friends made. Though I did find the princess to be quite annoying and I believe the story would of been better if he would of kicked her to the curb and said Bro's before Ho's! But I know that you got to have a lovely princess to save so, nope, it just didn't happen. Now on to book two!\n\nAugust 6, 2011\n\nIf The Green Star Saga Is Carter doing ERB's Venus then Calisto is Carter doing ERB's Mars. Oddly enough were Burroughs falls flat, Carter soars, and in reverse were Burroughs Mars is wonderful Calisto is slightly less than. Although not completely without merit, Carter was doing much better elsewhere.\n\nOctober 29, 2017\n\nI'm beginning to suspect that at the time of the likes of this book the fantasy literature lacked good editors and was often too much like borderline or whole fan fiction, though it could had easily been more - since fantasy fiction back then was much more fantastic, more mobile&expressive, more experimental and more faster paced (in a positive way) than the dull hogwash we get today, it is really a bit sad thing that authors such as Lin Carter didn't cross the threshold to become Howards, Burroughses or CA Smiths of their own era. I believe it wasn't even far, that threshold.\n\nJandar of Callisto is disappointing and shallow at the beginning, but gets better and better all the time -with a good editor and maybe some bolder moves in narrative it would had been a really good book, but there are errors that can't really be excused, only ignored for the sake of the ride. It was a page turner for me, wanting to read the kind of stuff that this is -Sword and planet/ sword and sorcery fantasy with lot of suspense and swordfights and weird otherwordly scenery.\n\nBut there are minuses:\n\n1) How the life story of the protagonist goes before entering another world is stupid and very unconvincing, the worst part of the book. No one lives the kind of life portrayed here: childhood in the jungle with adventuring father, then going to Yale and becoming an expert student and also a sword champion of the university, ending up in Vietnam... Oh god, this is so bad. Sword champion and time in Vietnam would had been adequate. Now it reads like some kid making the most unrealistic roleplaying character imaginable, kind of forcing the character to become the character of the jungle planet story in question.\n\n2) Too much fantasy/horror/scifi namedropping, I mean things like \"I remembered the story from Clark Ashton Smith where...\" -seems that beside spending his early years in jungle, protagonist has read all the books of the genre that he himself with his adventures represents. It's a really bad idea and also unconvincing, it breaks the illusion. As the book otherwise follows also much on the footsteps of likes of Burroughs, Leigh Brackett and Jack Vance, it would had been a more tasteful thing to leave namedropping to minimum, especially as there are some own and unique ideas also. And when fighting a duel in an airship making a reference like \"I felt like I'm in Errol Flynn movie\" is just plain stupid and again fucks up the illusion.\n\n3) Swordfighting is badly written. I am the first one to like realistic swordfight based on real systems of fence, but it is really a bad idea to write with terminology that only sport fencers and rapier fencers understand.\n\nFrom these cons it could be wrongly deduced that I don't think much about Jandor of Callisto but actually I'm reading these books happily, I'm already on a third one. Lin Carter besides these stupid ideas of his is really good at keeping a good suspence, making some really likeable characters and the moon of jupiter where the action takes is really a cool place full of wonders and weird sights. I genuinely like this stuff and am good in ignoring the bad stuff for the sake of the good ride.\n\nAugust 2, 2024\n\nThe first of Lin Carter's Callisto books, a homage to Edgar Rice Burroughs' Barsoom series, was a blast to read and served as a clear reminder of why Lin Carter is one of my very favourite pulp writers - and one of my favourite authors, period. In fact, although this may be blasphemous to some readers, I actually preferred this to the Barsoom books I've read.\n\nAlthough there are certainly some writing flaws at play here, such as excessive and dry exposition that occasionally breaks up the action, this still ticks all the boxes you could want from a pulpy sword and planet yarn. The world of Thanator is unique and colourful, with strange races, creatures, and cultures galore, and the adventures of Jandar are exactly the kind of thing classic heroic fiction should comprise of. Ultimately, you can tell Lin Carter is a super-fan of the kind of materials he writes, and his passion emanates from almost every single page.\n\nFor those reasons, this gets a solid 4 stars from me, and I look forward to seeing what the next seven books in this interplanetary saga have to offer.\n\nJune 5, 2018\n\nIf you're into Edgar Rice Burroughs style adventure novels, then this is certainly for you. Not only is it similar to the Mars novels, it's almost the exact same thing, but on Callisto. These books are dedicated to ERB himself, so it is more of an homage to him, rather than a rip-off of his stories. I almost wish Carter would have created his own extension novels of the Mars novels in addition to this, or instead of. He does a great job of creating the world of Callisto. It's fast paced and entertaining, so I'm going to continue the series to see what Carter has in store.\n\nFebruary 16, 2023\n\nRead this in 1973 and liked it, so decided to read it again after 50 years; did not age well. Author spent about 100 pages setting up the background and building the plot, but once the story got going it fell flat. There was absolutely no chemistry between the hero, Jandar, and the beautiful princess, Darloona. Carter is the poor man's Edgar Rice Burroughs, and this series is sort of like the Martian series, but it lacks the rick rich flavor, realistic atmosphere, and charismatic characters that ERB created.\n\nSeptember 2, 2021\n\nAnother one of Lin Carter's Burroughs homages, and not his best. It gets off to a slow start and doesn't pick up much from there. The best part comes after he joins forces with the fencing master and learns how to swordfight. I was disappointed. I really enjoyed Carter's underground world novels. He turned them into almost a satire of the genre. He played this one too straight. I checked out the rest of the series from Kindle Unlimited and I'll give them a go and see if they improve.\n\nJuly 16, 2024\n\nThe first of a series of eight books. Heavily based on ERB's A PRINCESS OF MARS, this is a fine work of fantasy on a jungle world/moon filled with strange people and even stranger monsters. Jon Dark somehow transported to a moon of Jupiter, which somehow has air, light, heat and living things; makes friends, and some enemies as he goes from one adventure to the next. The novel runs at a good pace and ends where you expect the second novel to start.\n\nDecember 22, 2020\n\nI read this book in a single take. It was trash, but the extremely enjoyable type.\n\nAlso, I found Carter's prose to be more fun than Burroughs', who the author was clearly imitating\n\nJune 21, 2022\n\nAbsolutely awesome.\n\nGreat story with gripping plot and interesting writing from Lin Carter. I highly recommend it for all ages. I can't wait to read the next book.\n\nJanuary 24, 2017\n\nIt's basically John Carter of Mars fan fiction, and I love it.\n\nNovember 22, 2017\n\n2.5 Stars.\n\nThis is a first book in a series written over forty years ago which is based upon the Burroughs Princess of Mars series.\n\nA Vietnam helicopter pilot crash lands in the jungle of Cambodia and discovers an ancient city where he is transported to one of moons of Jupiter.\n\nWell he gets captured by a intelligent insect type of creature, saves a princess and so on.\n\nThere are the usual tropes here.\n\nStory has some promise so am pushing on to volume two to give it a chance."
