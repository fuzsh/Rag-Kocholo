        "text": "\"When the Green Star Waned\" was Nictzin Dyalhis' first story for Weird Tales. It landed his name on the cover and proved the most popular story in the issue in which it appeared (April 1925) and of the year in which it appeared. \"When the Green Star Waned\" was also the fifth most popular story printed in Weird Tales between 1924 and 1940. The cover art was by Andrew Brosnatch. Finally, the cover of Weird Tales for January 1933. The cover story is \"Buccaneers of Venus\" by Otis Adelbert Kline. The cover art was by J. Allen St. John, the artist who perhaps more than any other is associated with the fiction of Edgar Rice Burroughs. St. John (1872-1957) was a near contemporary of Burroughs, and like the author, hailed from Chicago. He also created nine covers and numerous interior illustrations for Weird Tales."
