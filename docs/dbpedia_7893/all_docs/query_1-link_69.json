        "text": "Chapter 002: The Idols of the Old Ones\n\nIn releasing Dungeons & Dragons in 1974, Gary Gygax needed to convince wargamers that fantasy and science fiction were valid realms for hobby gaming. But how could he market a game type that had never existed before?\n\nThe Adventure Continues\n\nHello, and welcome once again to the Oldskull 74 project, where we are reading the Original 1974 Gygaxian & Arnesonian rules page by page, in search of lost pieces of wisdom that we can bring forward into 2023 role-playing play and game design.\n\nIf you missed the first installment, Forward, you might be interested in reading that first, here.\n\nInto the Hall of the Fallen Idols\n\nToday, we are looking at the closing paragraph of Gary’s Foreword to the system, where he talks about his influences on the design of the world’s first published role-playing game.\n\nThis is quite interesting, because although we know a lot about Gary’s overall inspirations on the game (through research on Appendix N, forum posts, interviews, and many other well-mined sources), this small November 1973 list is the very first establishment of origins for the revolutionary game, a game that no one quite understood when it hit the market.\n\n(Because no one had ever seen anything quite like it.)\n\nThese Rules Are Strictly Fantasy\n\nImmediately, Gary had a problem: He had put the subtitle “Rules for Fantastic Medieval Wargames Campaigns” on the cover, with artwork portraying a knight astride a warhorse.\n\nThere was a very good chance that customers would be picking up this new game being under the assumption that it was a war simulation set in the Middle Ages. There was no real advertising, no back of the box description, and not much else to go on. And the fact that many prospective buyers were already familiar with Gygax and Perren’s Chainmail (1971) would lend further credence to this assumption.\n\nSo right out of the gate, Gary comes out and says it in the Foreword, “These rules are strictly fantasy,” and warns further that “wargamers who lack imagination” will not find this system to their tastes. (Gary had already lost a couple of regulars out of the Lake Geneva gaming group, due to the group’s shifting focus away from medievalism toward monstrous and draconian battles.) Instead, in writing this in late 1973 Gary was banking on the surprise audience that had already embraced his Chainmail Fantasy Supplement, which in turn had proved to be the “popular cart which pulled the horse.”\n\nWhile the 1974 box was an upstart in a potentially hostile and realism-heavy marketplace, many wargamers were already familiar with the invasive idea of fantasy and the battle lines had been drawn between realistic “simulationism” and fantasy “imagination gaming.”\n\nWe can go through the intricate history of all that at length – see for example my Hawk & Moor series books, as well as Playing at the World – but for today, suffice it to say that creativity in wargaming was largely frowned upon by many of the hardcore regulars. Even staging hypothetical Napoleonic skirmishes that “didn’t really happen” could get you growled at by the grognards from time to time.\n\nBut Gary felt that this new fantasy audience, which had so warmly received Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings a few years earlier, might be ready to try something bold and new. As examples of the new game’s spirit of pulp adventure, in his Foreword he cites these four influences that might resonate with players who were looking for something new:\n\nThe Barsoom tales, by Edgar Rice Burroughs, featuring John Carter.\n\nThe Conan saga, by Robert E. Howard.\n\nThe fantasy stories of L. Sprague de Camp and Fletcher Pratt.\n\nThe Fafhrd and Gray Mouser tales of Fritz Leiber.\n\nA point in Gary’s writing here that is easily lost – unless you are an avid reader of old pulp fiction and Weird Tales – immediately arises. These four groupings of imaginary worlds are set roughly in chronological order, with Burroughs being popular in the 1910s and 20s, Conan in the 30s, de Camp and Pratt in the 40s and 50s, and Lankhmar in the 60s and early 70s.\n\nWe will take a look at these four specific idols and their influences one at a time. But first …\n\nToday’s Game Design Takeaway\n\nIn considering things that have fallen by the wayside, and that are not much considered in the current age of game design, but should be:\n\nIt’s not always enough to know what your idols’ inspirations were by name, date, and summary. Sometimes, you need to dig down and actually experience those inspirations for yourself.\n\nThis is the exact difference between remote inspiration and direct inspiration. Gygax and Arneson, for example, were directly inspired by the influences they put into their Lake Geneva and Twin Cities games in the early 1970s.\n\nThe current Wizards crew of 5E designers, however, are – in the vast majority and with a few exceptions – remotely inspired. This is the difference between actually walking the walk, or just talking the talk. I think you can tell the difference in the flavoring of the dishes that each “design chef” provides.\n\nNow I know that’s a bit harsh, but it’s true. It’s easier to lose your way when you didn’t actually adventure through all of the places that you think you did.\n\nDon’t worry, I know that most people don’t read old books at all these days. Even as a professional data researcher and amateur historian, I’m guilty of it myself. Even though I’ve read a lot of the core Appendix N texts for example, my to be read list is hundreds of titles long. And many of these books are 100 years old or more, written by people who lived in ages with very different societies, prejudices, and cultural norms.\n\nNevertheless, despite the current popularity of dismissing older creators from a 21st-century moral perspective, I think it’s a very good idea to get directly acquainted with the early inspirations on a direct and personal level. Try reading what came first. It might be boring or difficult from time to time, but it’s also challenging. And being challenged is always good. That’s how you flex your creative design muscles.\n\nYou will find treasure, amidst the dust. Carry forward whatever you find inspiring. And even if you don’t fully embrace all of the old things you read, the ways in which you react against the things that you don’t like will strengthen whatever it is you’re currently creating.\n\nGroping Through Black Pits\n\nAnd now we look at Gary’s first cited inspiration, John Carter.\n\nThe age of Edgar Rice Burroughs’ fame is sadly mostly gone, having now faded away to a few hardcore devotees of lost world fiction and the sword and planet genre. It is worth noting that John Eric Holmes, the editor of the “red dragon, blue book” Basic Set of 1977, was a devout fan of Burroughs himself, and he was an author who shared in the portrayal of Burroughs’ fabled hollow world at the center of the Earth, Pellucidar.\n\nFew people even know what Pellucidar is any longer. The most well-known Burroughs character now is probably Tarzan (who many mistake as a Disney creation), and John Carter’s saga – regarded by some as a Star Wars knock-off, even though George Lucas was actually inspired by Barsoom – is known to many only from the Walt Disney movie which disastrously flopped in 2012.\n\n(It was a victim of bad marketing, with the creators inexcusably not even wanting to put “Mars” in the title, and no one younger than 40 really understood what it was all about unless they were earlier in the know via adventure fiction.)\n\nThe John Carter stories are highly relevant to the 1974 game, because they feature a swashbuckling fighting man who awakens in a post-apocalyptic world of wonder and finds that he is able to progress his combat mastery and physical prowess to near superheroic proportions over time, aided by his wartime-honed skills with blade and firearm. His coming from a planet with heavy gravity is a big help as well, giving him the ability to leap a considerable distance, along with other feats of endurance and physical strength.\n\nGary loved John Carter to the point that he created the Warriors of Mars game (later in 1974) along with Brian Blume, but he would quickly run afoul of the ERB estate and copyright claims … which means that direct allusions to Carter and Barsoom, intended as a tribute, would fade rather quickly after a starring role in the 1974 rules. (Which we will get to, as we consider those future pages.)\n\nGary specifically mentions Carter as “groping through black pits,” which is a plotline that he was reminded of when he played in his first dungeon role-playing adventure, as refereed for him by Dave Arneson c. early 1973.\n\nThe exact allusion of Gary’s description of Carter and the “black pits” comes from Barsoom Book II, The Gods of Mars (serialization 1913, novel 1918), Chapter XIV, The Eyes in the Dark.\n\nIf you want to read a free copy for yourself, go here.\n\nDead Cities and Dungeons Deep\n\nTherein, Carter recalls a time when he was a prisoner, held in an underground dungeon of the Warhoons. He uses this memory to aid in navigating the subterranean understructure of an ancient building when he is trying to rescue his friend Tars Tarkas.\n\nCarter, sneaking along at the edge of radiant light that is cast by an enemy’s torch, sneaks after several guards through “a maze of tortuous corridors” in order to find his friend. Fearful of detection, he is forced to travel through the darkness on his own. He fears that he might “plunge headlong into some terrible pit,” or “meet with some of the ghoulish creatures that inhabit these lower worlds beneath the dead cities.”\n\nHe soon finds himself pursued by shadowy creatures with baleful glowing eyes, and he readies his long sword and backs away through the darkness. Eventually he is trapped by the creatures, because they can see in the dark, and just as he raises his sword to attack: “A cold, moist, slimy something fastened itself upon my throat. I stumbled and went down.”\n\nHere, we can see some of the exact story beats that Gary later drew into his 1974 dungeon exploration game. The fighter class, swordsmanship, lost cities, dungeons, subterranean torchlight, exploration, guard patrols, pit traps, wandering monsters, shadowy ghouls, infravision, humans lacking infravision, evasion, and surprise … they’re are all right there.\n\nThis scene is indeed quite dramatically stirring, and it could rather easily be argued that it inspired Robert E. Howard’s portrayal of his own later hero, Conan, escaping from a subterranean dungeon in The Scarlet Citadel (1933).\n\nAnd that is quite a tale in itself. For another day.\n\nAnother Adventure\n\nIn our next installment, we will look at the Lin Carter connection, and the secret D&D design lore hidden away in his 50 year old book, Imaginary Worlds.
