        "text": "APPENDIX N: INSPIRATIONAL AND EDUCATIONAL READING\n\nInspiration for all the fantasy work I have done stems directly from the love my father showed when I was a tad, for he spent many hours telling me stories he made up as he went along, tales of cloaked old men who could grant wishes, of magic rings and enchanted swords, or wicked sorcerors [sic] and dauntless swordsmen.\n\nThen too, countless hundreds of comic books went down, and the long-gone EC ones certainly had their effect. Science fiction, fantasy, and horror movies were a big influence. In fact, all of us tend to get ample helpings of fantasy when we are very young from fairy tales such as those written by the Brothers Grimm and Andrew Lang. This often leads to reading books of mythology, paging through bestiaries, and consultation of compilations of the myths of various lands and peoples.\n\nUpon such a base I built my interest in fantasy, being an avid reader of all science fiction and fantasy literature since 1950.\n\nThe following authors were of particular inspiration to me. In some cases I cite specific works, in others, I simply recommend all of their fantasy writing to you. From such sources, as well as any other imaginative writing or screenplay, you will be able to pluck kernels from which will grow the fruits of exciting campaigns. Good reading! Anderson, Poul: THREE HEARTS AND THREE LIONS; THE HIGH CRUSADE; THE BROKEN SWORD\n\nBellairs, John: THE FACE IN THE FROST\n\nBrackett, Leigh\n\nBrown, Frederic\n\nBurroughs, Edgar Rice: \"Pellucidar\" series; Mars series; Venus series\n\nCarter, Lin: \"World's End\" series\n\nde Camp, L. Sprague: LEST DARKNESS FALL; THE FALLIBLE FIEND; et al\n\nde Camp & Pratt: \"Harold Shea\" series; THE CARNELIAN CUBE\n\nDerleth, August\n\nDunsany, Lord\n\nFarmer, P. J.: \"The World of the Tiers\" series; et al\n\nFox, Gardner: \"Kothar\" series; \"Kyrik\" series; et al\n\nHoward, R. E.: \"Conan\" series\n\nLanier, Sterling: HIERO'S JOURNEY\n\nLeiber, Fritz: \"Fafhrd & Gray Mouser\" series; et al\n\nLovecraft, H. P.\n\nMerritt, A.: CREEP, SHADOW, CREEP; MOON POOL; DWELLERS IN THE MIRAGE; et al\n\nMoorcock, Michael: STORMBRINGER; STEALER OF SOULS; \"Hawkmoon\" series (esp. the first three books)\n\nNorton, Andre\n\nOffutt, Andrew J.: editor of SWORDS AGAINST DARKNESS III\n\nPratt, Fletcher: BLUE STAR; et al\n\nSaberhagen, Fred: CHANGELING EARTH; et al\n\nSt. Clair, Margaret: THE SHADOW PEOPLE; SIGN OF THE LABRYS\n\nTolkien, J. R. R.: THE HOBBIT; \"Ring trilogy\"\n\nVance, Jack: THE EYES OF THE OVERWORLD; THE DYING EARTH; et al\n\nWeinbaum, Stanley\n\nWellman, Manley Wade\n\nWilliamson, Jack\n\nZelazny, Roger: JACK OF SHADOWS; \"Amber\" series; et al The most immediate influences upon AD&D were probably de Camp & Pratt, R. E. Howard, Fritz Leiber, Jack Vance, H. P. Lovecraft, and A. Merritt; but all of the above authors, as well as many not listed, certainly helped to shape the form of the game. For this reason, and for the hours of reading enjoyment, I heartily recommend the works of these fine authors to you.\n\n- E. Gary Gygax, 1979, AD&D Dungeon Masters Guide, p. 224\n\nStarting about a decade ago, I made an effort to read more classic fantasy literature; books and short stories that could have influenced the creation of D&D. I'm less interested in the exact list of authors and works that Gary Gygax saw fit to mention in the AD&D DMG.\n\nMy personal Appendix N:\n\nThe Well at the World's End by William Morris\n\nKing Solomon's Mines and She by H. Rider Haggard\n\nThe House on the Borderland and The Night Land by W.H. Hodgson\n\nVarious short story collections by Lord Dunsany\n\nThe Moon Pool and The Ship of Ishtar by Abraham Merritt\n\nThe Conan and Solomon Kane stories by Robert E. Howard\n\nVarious short stories by H.P. Lovecraft (though I consider him more a horror and SF writer)\n\nVarious short stories by Clark Ashton Smith\n\nThe Worm Ouroboros by Eric Ruckert Eddison\n\nThe Lord of the Rings trilogy by J.R.R. Tolkien\n\nTitus Groan and Gormenghast by Mervyn Peake\n\nThree Hearts and Three Lions by Poul Anderson\n\nThe Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser stories by Fritz Leiber\n\nThe Dying Earth stories and various others by Jack Vance\n\nThe Elric stories by Michael Moorcock\n\nLord of Light and the original Amber series by Roger Zelazny\n\nThe Book of the New Sun by Gene Wolfe\n\nAppendix N is great. I first learned of it from the now-defunct blog Grognardia.\n\nThe Grognardia blog was great. It's a pity James Maliszewski abandoned it at the end of 2012.\n\nMany of those books are on Appendix N.\n\nYes, I'm aware of that. Just thought I'd mention the fantasy fiction that I personally find inspiring for use in RPGs.\n\nAnd GG wasn't very clear on what was and what wasnt to be read. Like he just says \"lovecraft\" and that's it.\n\nIf Comte hadn't already posted the contents of Appendix N, I would have included it in my own post. As you can see, Gygax does include specific suggestions for many authors, though for many he apparently finds all their works worthwhile, or at least too many to be listed.[/QUOTE]\n\nI have read most of it, and it is a great grounding in D&D's sources of inspiration - you get to see why this or that rule/class/magic item/monster got into the game, how you ought to interpret them, and where Gary Gygax & Co. were coming from when they were saying D&D is not a Tolkienesque game. Most of them are also a lot more suitable for inspiring a D&D campaign than the \"hero's journey\" stuff that became ubiquitous in the 1980s.\n\nIn particular, the list drew my attention to the amazing American pulp tradition of the first half of the 20th century - you can't go wrong with that stuff. Personally, I'd also add the following works to it:\n\nHarold Lamb: Khlit the Cossack stories. Lamb was a writer of historical pulps in the late 1910s, and was one of Robert E. Howard's sources of inspiration. His stories are lean, steeped in an in-depth knowledge of history and local customs, and really clever with their plotting - his hero, an illiterate old Cossack gradually who is still great with the blade but gradually losing his fighting edge, survives more by his wits than his fighting prowess. These stories were reprinted in the early 2000s.\n\nTalbot Mundy: King of the Khyber Rifles, Guns of the Gods, Tros of Samothrace (etc.). Another pulp author and REH inspiration, Mundy's stories draw from his personal experiences as an IRL adventurer in the British Empire. They are heavy on mysticism and exotic fantasy, combined with a good eye for depicting common people. King is great colonial adventure, and introduces Princess Yasmini as its main antagonist, whom REH used wholesale for his own stories as Princess Yasmina (People of the Black Circle, etc.) - although, if possible, the original is a much richer and more dangerous character. Tros is set in the times of Caesar, and it is a 1000-page swords&sandals epic written on a grand scale.\n\nClark Ashton Smith: A puzzling omission by Gygax, but definitely up there with Howard and Lovecraft.\n\nMoore, Catherine L.: Jirel of Joiry stories. Jirel is one of the notable fighting women. The stories are heavy on dungeon-crawling into hellscapes that are kinda-sorta like the D&D underworld.\n\nAlex Raymond: Flash Gordon. This comic book series - particularly its early stories - are pure D&D, with exotic landscapes, bizarre monsters, non-stop adventure and sociopathic alien cultures (the 1980 movie is a fairly accurate representation).\n\nJack Vance: Lyonesse. Vance is already on the list, but his Lyonesse books were only published in the 1980s. It is a relevant book because it is D&D's Western/Northern European fantasy through a vancian lens, full of odd detours and incidental plotting.\n\nDan Parsons: Navero of the Correct and Unalterable Way. This is sort of cheating, because Navero is a series of play reports from some guy's AD&D campaign posted on Usenet. On the other hand, it shows what is totally the right way to play AD&D. Never finished, but it is a lot of fun to read what is available."
