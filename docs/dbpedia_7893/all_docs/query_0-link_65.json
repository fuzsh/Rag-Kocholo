        "text": "“One glance at a Paul illustration can change your life forever. I was eight years old when I laid eyes on an illustration he did for A. Hyatt Verrill story about a world with giant ants. It made me want to be part of a world of imagination and within a few years I fell completely in love with science fiction– all from this one illustration.” – Ray Bradbury\n\nThe first and only book on the life and art of the Grandfather of science-fiction illustration. The book is edited with an Introduction by Stephen D. Korshak, a Preface by Sir Arthur C. Clarke, a Foreword by Jerry Weist and Roger Hill, and essays by Gerry de la Ree, Sam Moskowitz, Forrest J Ackerman, and a Paul Bibliography by Frank Wu. The Hardcover Trade Edition is 128 pages of text, color and black and white illustrations. The Deluxe and Ultra Deluxe Editions will have an Illustrated Index of all of Paul’s full-color science-fiction magazine covers and 20 pages of additional art.\n\n​\n\nTo order this publication visit www.shastaphoenixart.com.\n\nThis, Vanguard's second volume devoted to the work of the original grand master of fantastic art, J. Allen St. John, concentrates on the artist's full-color fantasy, science fiction and adventure paintings for novels and Pulp magazines by famous authors, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Jack Williamson, Robert E. Howard and more.\n\nSt. John is the original, grand illustrator of Tarzan, John Carter of Mars, and others. His illustrations inspired generations of later fantastic artists including Roy G. Krenkel, Jeffrey Jones and Frank Frazetta. St. John will always be recognized as the first and most important illustrator of Burrough's writings and this book is produced with the full endorsement and cooperation of Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc.\n\nAlso featured are essays by renowned science fiction author Jack Williamson, Danton Burroughs, Lin Carter, and illustrators Vincent Di Fate, and Frank Frazetta.\n\n​\n\nTo order this publication visit www.shastaphoenixart.com.\n\nStarting in 1932, Margaret Brundage, wife of leftist revolutionary Slim Brundage, -- whom she met at the wildly-bohemian Dil Pickle Club during the Chicago Renaissance -- forever changed the look of Fantasy and Horror with her alluring, sensationalistic covers for the legendary pulp magazine, Weird Tales. Brundage, whose art contemporaries include Virgil Finlay and Hannes Bok, is unique as she was the first female cover artist of the pulp era.\n\nDecades before the Gothic fetish craze, Brundage's lush, provocative paintings, which frequently featured smoldering, semi-nude young women bearing whips, became a focus of acute attention and controversy. At the very peak of the notorious pulp's classic run, the magazine's appeal was due as much to Brundage's covers as to the stories inside by famous authors H. P. Lovecraft, Clark Ashton Smith, Robert Bloch and Conan creator, Robert E. Howard. Long before Frazetta, it was Brundage who was the very first Conan cover artist.\n\nThe Alluring Art of Margaret Brundage is the premier book devoted to this noted artist and features all of her Weird Tales and Conan covers.\n\n​\n\nTo order this publication visit www.shastaphoenixart.com.\n\nHannes Bok's paintings, woodcarvings, and illustrations captured the imagination of science fiction readers for 30 years, arguably the peak period of the genre. Bok achieved a luminous, stained-glass quality in his work through the use of an arduous glazing process, reminiscent of the work of his early mentor, Maxfield Parrish. Hannes Bok's fantastic illustrations graced the pages of many major science fiction magazines and books. A Hannes Bok Treasury features 45 full color and 50 distinctive black and white illustrations, including previously unpublished paintings and drawings. Also reproduced here are rare samples of Bok's work in costume design and his elaborate paper mache masks. This unique showcase edition is for every fan of science fiction and fantastic art.\n\n​\n\nWe apologize, this text is SOLD OUT."
