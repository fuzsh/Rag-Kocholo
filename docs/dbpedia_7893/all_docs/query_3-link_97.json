        "text": "The virtual Carolina Calots meetup held in April of 2024 took an intriguing turn. Participants were all geared up to discuss their beloved speculative fiction writers other than Burroughs and engage in a detailed analysis of the similarities and differences between Burroughs' writing style and that of the author they selected. The conversation turned out to be both captivating and intellectually stimulating, with a plethora of renowned authors and their literary creations being brought into the spotlight. Although it's impossible to recount every single remark or observation made during the discussion, I've made an effort to highlight some of the most exceptional recommendations that were shared.\n\nClive Cussler, also known as The Master of Adventure in the literary world, is renowned for his captivating series of novels featuring the iconic hero Dirk Pitt. These technotrillers are a unique blend of science fiction, historical references, lost civilizations, and heart-pounding action sequences that keep readers on the edge of their seats. Among the standout titles in Cussler's collection are Pacific Vortex!, where human divers equipped with artificial gills take center stage, Cyclops, which delves into the mysteries of a secret Moon colony, and Shock Wave, which unfolds on a mysterious tropical island hidden deep in the Pacific Ocean. In addition to the Dirk Pitt series, Cussler has collaborated with Paul Kemprecos on the Kurt Austin books, featuring a protagonist similar to Dirk Pitt. Lost City, one of the notable works in this series, introduces readers to a secretive family of arms dealers seeking immortality for thousands of years, with hints of an Atlantis-like Lost World lurking at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. With a knack for weaving elements of the fantastic into his narratives, Clive Cussler's novels promise readers a thrilling and immersive experience that transcends the boundaries of traditional adventure storytelling. Discover the captivating world of Cussler at your nearby library, where you can find his thrilling adventures in various formats. For those who enjoy audiobooks, I strongly suggest choosing Scott Brick as the narrator for an immersive experience with Cussler's works.\n\nRobert E. Howard, a beloved author in the realm of science fiction and fantasy, captivates readers from the very first sentence of his writings and keeps them engrossed until the very end. With a diverse range of genres under his belt, including fantasy, science fiction, boxing, adventure, and westerns, Howard's versatility knows no bounds. He is widely regarded as the true pioneer and source of inspiration for the sword-and-sorcery genre, which initially thrived within the science fiction market until the late 1960s when fantasy emerged as a distinct marketing category. Following this shift, Howard's work experienced an extraordinary surge in popularity after his passing. Fortunately, Project Gutenberg offers a treasure trove of Howard's literary gems as free e-downloads, allowing readers to delve into his captivating worlds. (Link to free Robert E Howard downloadable eBooks)\n\nBefore transitioning into popular fiction writing in the early 1920s, Otis Adelbert Kline had an active career in music. However, it was his foray into writing that truly showcased his talent across various genres. Kline's work predominantly fell into the Planetary Romance style, which had been primarily shaped by the renowned author Burroughs. Interestingly, there was a time when editor Donald A Wollheim sparked rumors of a \"Kline-Burroughs War,\" but as time passed, these rumors lost their credibility and are now regarded as nothing more than a clever publicity stunt. Among Kline's notable works are the captivating Robert Grandon stories, including \"The Planet of Peril,\" \"Planet of Peril,\" and \"The Prince of Peril.\" These thrilling tales transport readers alongside the swashbuckling Grandon to the enchanting planet of Venus, where he embarks on a remarkable journey from slavery to marrying a princess. Additionally, Kline's Mars tales are linked to this series through the character of Dr. Morgan, a brilliant scientist who facilitates interplanetary transfers. This collection includes \"The Swordsman of Mars\" and its sequel, \"The Outlaws of Mars.\" Kline's creativity extends beyond the realms of Venus and Mars. He also introduced readers to the captivating world of Jan of the Jungle, and the mystical story The Bride of Osiris. While it may be challenging to find Kline's works for free, some of his writings have been reprinted and are conveniently available on platforms like Amazon, with prices as low as 99 cents.\n\nS M Stirling has openly acknowledged the influence of iconic authors such as Burroughs, Kline, and Leigh Brackett on his work. He first gained recognition in the genre with his Fifth Millennium fantasy tales before delving into his Alternate-History Draka series, known for its intense violence and his right-wing beliefs. As his career progressed, Stirling ventured into The Change trilogy, where the town of Nantucket is transported back in time to the Stone Age, forcing its inhabitants to adapt and survive in a primitive world. This was followed by The Change: Emberverse series, where the sudden failure of all technology in the early twenty-first century leads to a post-apocalyptic scenario where Americans struggle to navigate a world without modern conveniences. Additionally, Stirling's The Lords of Creation series, which includes The Sky People and In the Courts of the Crimson Kings, explores an Alternate History where Mars and Venus have been transformed into settings for Planetary Romance adventures involving humans and indigenous species, all thanks to an ancient alien civilization. Stirling's unique blend of fantasy, alternate history, and science fiction has captivated readers and solidified his place as a prominent figure in the genre. (This author is still writing and so no free downloads. Here is a link on Goodreads to his Emberverse books for more reviews and suggestions.)\n\nMichael Moorcock, was a fan of Burroughs, and gained some popularity through his Kane of Old Mars trilogy and his contributions to the Tarzan Adventures as a youth. One of Moorcock's most prominent recurring characters is the Eternal Champion, who appears in various series such as Eternal Champion, Elric of Melniboné, Hawkmoon, Corum, and Von Bek. Moorcock skillfully utilizes the Multiverse and the concept of the Eternal Champion to interconnect his vast array of tales into one cohesive series. The Elric stories, which marked Moorcock's initial significant literary achievement, revolve around the character Elric of Melniboné, an albino plagued by melancholy and bound to a Chaos-inducing sword that he wields with treacherous consequences. In the 1970s, Moorcock collaborated with James Cawthorn to create the screenplay for the film The Land that Time Forgot (1975), inspired by ERB's work. For those interested in exploring Moorcock's works further, we recommend checking your local library as our branch currently has three of his books available for borrowing.\n\nRobert A Heinlein blended the adventurous spirit of Burroughs with the visionary imagination of H G Wells. His storytelling prowess was unmatched, painting a vivid picture of the future as a tangible place where characters truly lived and breathed, setting a standard of excellence that remains unchallenged. Heinlein's characters were not just ordinary individuals, but competent men of action who could seamlessly transition from using their fists to wielding a slide-rule, actively engaging in the intricate mechanisms that drove the world forward. One of his acclaimed works, \"Friday\", a successor to \"Gulf,\" features a highly skilled special agent grappling with her own insecurities about being a robot as she navigates a fractured future America in search of a new beginning. Another notable piece from Heinlein's repertoire with echoes of Burroughs was \"Glory Road,\" where a young man's simple response to a newspaper ad leads him on a dangerous journey alongside a captivating woman to retrieve the mythical Egg of the Phoenix. Your local public library is a treasure trove of Heinlein's works (ours did not have the two books we mentioned, so off to Amazon), including the renowned book, and movie adaptation, of Starship Troopers. Personally, I'm a huge fan of the movie, and it makes me curious to explore how the book might offer a completely different experience.\n\nIsaac Asimov, a prominent figure in speculative fiction, played a crucial role alongside Burroughs in captivating readers with his unique writing style. Asimov's literary journey commenced with the captivating tale of \"Marooned off Vesta,\" which swept readers off their feet. Remarkably, he penned this masterpiece while still in his teenage years, setting the stage for the three works that would define his name for the next fifty years. Firstly, \"Strange Playfellow,\" the inaugural story in the Robot series, introduced the Laws of Robotics, which would soon become a cornerstone of the genre. Secondly, \"Nightfall,\" arguably the most renowned story of all time, captivated audiences with its brilliance. Lastly, \"Foundation,\" the first installment of the celebrated Foundation series, revolutionized the concept of the Galactic Empire, transforming it into a fundamental backdrop for countless future histories in the field. Asimov's narratives transcend the realm of ray guns, delving into the intricacies of social life and presenting captivating characters driven by dialogue and storytelling. Undoubtedly, your library should boast a plethora of Asimov's books, and you may even stumble upon some hidden gems in used bookstores.\n\nNever enough time to touch on them all, but amidst our discussions we couldn't help but mention a plethora of other remarkable authors. Among them were Frank Herbert, H. Rider Haggard (whose works undoubtedly influenced Burroughs), A. Merritt (The Moon Pool), Lin Carter, Ralph Milne Farley (The Radio Beasts), Poul Anderson (Swordsman of Lost Terra), Dan Brown, Jules Verne (20,000 Leagues Under the Sea), and Michael Crichton. The list goes on, and we eagerly await your suggestions. Don't hesitate to leave us a comment and let us know, if not Burroughs, then who? We're all ears!"
