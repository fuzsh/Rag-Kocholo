        "text": "In John Carter, Lynn Collins plays Dejah Thoris, a Martian princess whose people are involved in a war with another Martian nation. But Dejah Thoris is no helpless maiden. She’s not only smart, but can hold her own in a fight with the boys.\n\nCollins spoke to The Hollywood Reporter on the carpet at the premiere on Wednesday.\n\nPHOTOS: ‘John Carter’ Premiere Red Carpet Arrivals\n\n“She is a strong, independent, intelligent female with her hands both firmly grasped on her masculinity,” she told THR. “And that’s something we just don’t see that much. And I wanted to inspire women with that image, with that character.”\n\nCollins was reunited with her X-Men Origins: Wolverine co-star Taylor Kitsch for John Carter. Kitsch, known for playing Tim Riggins on Friday Night Lights, plays the titular character in Disney’s film, which is based on the Barsoom series by Edgar Rice Burroughs.\n\nVIDEO: ‘John Carter’ Star Taylor Kitsch on Playing a Flawed Character\n\n“He’s amazing,” Collins said of Kitsch. “I have to say he just helped me through so many times I was scared and we were doing stunts.”\n\n“He’s incredible and he’s got such a rare sensitivity,” she added. Kitsch plays a down-on-his-luck Civil War vet who is mysteriously transported to Mars where he becomes involved in resolving the conflict between the warring nations.\n\nIn the film, helmed by Wall-E director Andrew Stanton, Collins’ character does a lot of fighting and even some flying and falling. Collins told THR that the scariest stunt she had to do was a swan dive that was about a six-story fall.\n\nTHR asked her if she is afraid of heights. “I was,” she said. “Now who knows. Who knows what I’m afraid of anymore.”"
