        "text": "From the moment I read my first Conan story by Robert E Howard, I had an interest in swords. Heck, it might have gone back to when I read “The Song of Roland” as a child.\n\nAs a teen I wanted to take up fencing, but unlike most sports, it wasn’t taught in school. Maybe it was and maybe my mom didn’t think it was a good idea. I don’t recall. I do recall that settled on other martial arts, generally of the non-weapons variety — judo, tai chi, and tae Kwon do.\n\nNot being able to play with them in real life, I wrote fiction about them, some of it the sword and sorcery type.\n\nBut I never thought of collecting them. For one thing, where would I put them in the Navy? And it’s not a cheap hobby, as I’m finding out.\n\nIt wasn’t until I took my family to the renaissance faire that I realized, I really wanted a sword. I mentioned my desire to my wife who bought a couple off of eBay. Neither of us knew any better.\n\nSo for years I had two swords. One was a Scottish claymore style. The other, I have no idea what it is. I assumed maybe it was a Viking sword. What did I know?\n\nNothing as it turned out. Recently I got an ADHD bug up my ass. For those who don’t know what that is, that’s where we sufferers of that disorder suddenly become obsessed with something and dive in head first into a hobby or interest and we become consumed by whatever it is.\n\nSo I suddenly wanted more — a couple weeks ago. And I watched eBay and saw some good prices, and pulled the trigger.\n\nAnd then, I started researching. I know, research should have come first, but I wanted them now! Only after I made my purchases did I discover my error.\n\nI found a lot of good information on swords online and discovered that the swords I had were known as wall-hangers or SLOs (Sword-Like Objects) and were good for nothing more than display. And not even that in the case of the two I already had.\n\nAside from the fact that the swords are made of stainless steel (good for knives, not so good for swords), the two swords are actually scale models, so to speak, of the real swords.\n\nBoth have blades of about 22 inches, whereas a “battle ready” production Scottish Highland Claymore is generally a two-handed weapon with an overall length of over 55 inches and a blade length of 41 inches. Here’s an example of one over at Kult of Athena:\n\nAs you can see, that one is nothing like the one I own.\n\nSo drat it all. I just realized I’d purchased more wall-hangers because I didn’t research my topic, which is really unlike me. Sometimes I’ll spend months in the research phase just enjoying that as an end to itself. But here I jumped in head first without looking.\n\nSo what did I find out, aside from the fact that eBay offerings of swords are generally crap?\n\nI found out that quality swords, not SLOs, are made of carbon steel — generally either 1045, 1060, or 1095, which represents the percentage of carbon within the steel. The higher the better. Stainless steel is OK for knives and blades under a foot in length, but the steel is too brittle for anything longer. Carbon offers strength and flex, something you need for a sword if your going to be doing anything other than hangin it on a wall.\n\nReal swords have a solid tang–the part that isn’t the blade that the hilt (handle) surrounds. A quality tang is actually a continuation of the blade, slightly narrower. This is important, because some swords have what is known as a “rat tail” which is a small thin piece of metal welded onto the blade. In other words, it’s a terrifyingly weak point of the sword and if you were to actually hit something with it, it could snap off. Hell. it could snap off under forceful swinging and the blade could helicopter away from you toward who knows what or whom.\n\nIf you don’t believe me, here’s the infamous Home Shopping Network Katana Incident. Keep in mind that although my wall-hangers are not sharpened, for some reason decorative katana’s often are. Why? I don’t know, but it’s like having a 2 or 3 foot long sharpened butcher’s knife in your hand. Now imagine that blade breaking off and striking something. Now watch the video.\n\nThink about that until I return with Part 2.\n\n-30-\n\nWhen people think of sword and sorcery, the first think that pops into their head are the tales of Conan the barbarian from the Northern wastelands known as Cimmeria, as originally written by Robert E. Howard.\n\nBut it is possible that those stories might have faded into the distant past as the majority of stories did that were published back in the halycon days of pulp fiction had it not been for the diligent investigations of L. Sprague de Camp. Howard’s legacy had been passed on from his father, who continued to work with REH’s literary agent after Howard’s death. But then things got convoluted and confusing. Dr. Howard passed the rights onto a friend, who passed them on to his wife and daughter. From there they ended up with a cousin’s widow, who passed them on to her children. Today, the rights are allegedly held by a Swedish Company, Paradox Entertainment Inc., although questions of copyright renewal arise.\n\nBut the point is, had it not been for the de Camp ferreting out Howard’s Conan stories, editing them, rewriting others, and publishing them in fiction magazines and in book collections in the 1950s, today when we speak of Conan, we might all just think of the late night talk show and not our beloved sword swinging barbarian.\n\nAs I’ve mentioned previously, I’m working my way through the Lancer/Ace Conan series of books that were released in the late 1960s and 1970s and blogging about each. I’ve finished the second book in the Lancer/Ace collection of Conan printed in the late 1960s and 1970s, Conan of Cimmeria.\n\nFirst, here’s the book’s cover, illustrated by Frank Frazetta. This is one of my favorite illustrations of Conan by Frazetta. I had a reproduction of it on my wall back when I was a teen and first reading this series. Not sure what ever happened to it. Looking at it now, I think I’d like to purchase another, frame it, and put it in my library.\n\nThe piece is titled, “The Snow Giants,” and also was used as the cover for the American rock band, Dust on their second album release, “Hard Attack.”\n\nConan of Cimmeria (1969) (by Robert E. Howard, L. Sprague de Camp, and Lin Carter)\n\nContents\n\n“Introduction” (L. Sprague de Camp)\n\n“The Curse of the Monolith” (L. Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter)\n\n“The Blood-Stained God” (Robert E.

A brief essay on Howard and his writings on Conan and his creation of The Hyborian Age, an essay on the prehistory of Conan’s world.\n\nThe Curse of the Monolith. First publication was in Worlds of Fantasy Vol. 1, No. 1 in 1968 as “Conan and the Cenotaph” Later publication: Warlocks and Warriors anthology (Mayflower, 1971, ed. Douglas Hill) and The Conan Chronicles (Sphere Books, 1989). The story was also adapted in Marvel’s black and white graphic magazine, The Savage Sword of Conan #33, scripted by Roy Thomas, penciled by Gene Colan, and inked by Pablos Marcos.\n\nA non-Howard story. Conan is a Captain in the Turanian army on a diplomatic mission to Kusan. Returning, Duke Feng, a high noble of the court of Kusan, takes Conan into his confidence: there is an ancient, hidden treasure in a king’s tomb only he knows the whereabouts of. Conan agrees to help him and at the Duke’s behest because of all the dangers, dons all his armor. When they arrive at a tall stone monolith and all the metal digging tools are snatched from Conan’s grip and quickly he becomes ensnared in the unseen magnetic force until he too is stuck fast to the stone. Feng plays a weird tune on a pipe and an amoeba-like creature materializes at the top, slowly oozing it’s way down to devour Conan. As a de Camp/Carter story, it isn’t bad and has enough of a Howardian feel to it that it fits in just fine.\n\nThe Blood-Stained God. This is from an unpublished story by Howard, found and rewritten by de Camp, called “The Trail of the Blood-Stained God” that was set in modern Afghanistan featuring another Howard character, Kirby O’Donnell. In rewritten form, as a Conan tale, it was first published in 1955 collection Tales of Conan (Gnome Press, 1955).\n\nThe story concerns Conan seeking out the people who stole a treasure map from him. He comes upon a Kezankian prisoner being tortured and intervenes. In the process he is knocked unconscious but awakens in the company of an Iranistan named Sassan. They agree to become partners, until such time as it’s convenient that one kills the other, to find the treasure in an ancient, hidden temple in the mountains. As a modern middle eastern story crammed to fit into the Conan mold, it isn’t badly done, and in fact, has an interesting middle eastern flavor to it that, I’m guessing, de Camp couldn’t completely eliminate without totally rewriting the entire story. My only issue with the story is the supernatural element, which is a statue of a god coming to life and just sort of smacks of the story, “The City of Skulls” from the first book in this series, Conan.\n\nThe Frost Giant’s Daughter. An REH story that was rejected Weird Tales. Howard rewrote it, changed the character from Conan to Amra of Akbitana and retitled it, “The Frost King’s Daughter.” It was published in the March 1934 issue of The Fantasy Fan under the title, “Gods of the North.” L. Sprague de Camp found the story and rewrote it. The new version was published in the August 1953 issue of Fantasy Fiction. It was also published in The Coming of Conan (Gnome Press, 1953). Later publications were in The Conan Chronicles Volume 1: The People of the Black Circle (Gollancz, 2000) and Conan of Cimmeria: Volume One (1932-1933) (Del Rey, 2003). The story was also adapted by Marvel in Conan the Barbarian #16 by Roy Thomas and Barry Smith.\n\nConan is on a battlefield facing the last Vanir. Conan defeats him but is exhausted and collapses. He is surprised to hear a woman’s laugh and he sees a beautiful, nearly naked woman. She taunts him and he rises to give pursuit. She dances just out of his reach as they travel miles toward the mountains, until she leads him into a trap set by her two frost giant brothers. (See cover illustration.) I’ve always enjoyed this story in the various incarnations of it I’ve read. I think its the dream-like quality of the story that even Conan isn’t sure any of it happened. In the end, he’s found half-frozen in the snow by his comrades who do their best to thaw him out as he tells his story. They disbelieve him until they manage to open his hand and find a gossamer raiment from the girl.\n\nConan the Barbarian #16, July 1972, cover by Barry Smith\n\nThe Lair of the Ice Worm. This De Camp/Carter stories appears in print here for the first time. It is later republished in The Conan Chronicles (Sphere Books, 1989). I think the term “filler” is fitting here. It is a forgettable story and is thrown in simply to show what a 23-year-old Conan did between the previous story and the next.\n\nQueen of the Black Coast. This story first appeared in the May 1934 issue of Weird Tales. It was reprinted in Avon Fantasy Reader No. 8, 1948, and The Coming of Conan (Gnome Press, 1953). Later publications were in Sword & Sorcery annual (Ziff-Davis, 1975), The Conan Chronicles Volume 1: The People of the Black Circle (Gollancz, 2000) and Conan of Cimmeria: Volume One (1932-1933) (Del Rey, 2003). It has also been adapted by Marvel in Conan the Barbarian, with a story arc about Bêlit introduced in issue #57 and continued until #100. Most recently, it is the basis for three issue story presented in Dark Horse Comics’ Conan the Barbarian #10 – #12.\n\nBêlit! This is as classic a Howardian epic as there is. The ship Conan has hitched a ride upon is beset by pirates. Conan, the only real warrior on the ship and the only one wearing armour, is the sole survivor, and he battles the pirates like a living hurricane, until:\n\nBefit sprang before the blacks, beating down their spears. She turned toward Conan, her bosom heaving, her eyes flashing. Fierce fingers of wonder caught at his heart. She was slender, yet formed like a goddess: at once lithe and voluptuous. Her only garment was a broad silken girdle. Her white ivory limbs and the ivory globes of her breasts drove a beat of fierce passion through the Cimmerian’s pulse, even in the panting fury of battle. Her rich black hair, black as a Stygian night, fell in rippling burnished clusters down her supple back. Her dark eyes burned on the Cimmerian.\n\nConan meets Bêlit the pirate and it’s love at first site. If you want to read it now, it’s available for free at Gutenberg Project. And lest I forget a chance to rip on the 1982 schlockfest known as Conan the Barbarian starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. That movie took a small piece of this story and incorporated it rather poorly (Warning: SPOILER): the idea where Bêlit dies, promising to return to protect Conan in time of need. It was an embarrassing scene with Sandahl Bergman all silver, sparkly, and silly, saying, “Do you want to live forever?” Well, yes, if dying means I have to dress like that. Adapting “Queen of the Black Coast” as written would make a glorious movie, but as usual, Hollywood thinks they can write better than Howard and just pick and choose concepts instead of adapting stories whole cloth.\n\nThe Vale of Lost Women. An original Howard story that was published posthumously for the first time first published in The Magazine of Horror, No. 15, Spring, 1967. Later publication came in The Conan Chronicles Volume 1: The People of the Black Circle (Gollancz, 2000) and Conan of Cimmeria: Volume One (1932-1933) (Del Rey, 2003). It was adapted by Marvel Comics in Conan the Barbarian #104.\n\nMore of Howard’s wonderful prose, but although this is a Conan story, it’s told from the point of view of Livia, a woman held prisoner by a Bakalah jungle tribe. Enter Conan, who is chieftain of a rival tribe at this point. Livia sneaks out of her tent (not much of a prisoner) and enlists Conan’s aid to free her, promising if he kills the king, he can have his way with her. Conan agrees and the next day his warriors launch their attack. Livia, not wanting to be ravished, escapes in the confusion, but ends up lost and wanders into an ancient valley that legend says is filled with ghost women. It is and they capture her to sacrifice to their giant bat-god. Will Conan save her?\n\nThe Castle of Terror. Another de Camp/Carter Conan pastiche that appears here for the first time and is reprinted in the The Conan Chronicles (Sphere Books, 1989).\n\nAnother filler piece that is part “The Thing in the Crypt” and part “The Vale of Lost Women” in that here Conan is traveling across the plains, being pursued by lions this time instead of wolves, and he comes upon an ancient citadel this time instead of a rock cave, that is filled by male spirits this time instead of female. Anyway, the spirits are energy suckers, but they’ve been starved for so long, they can’t suck Conan’s energy. So they start to coagulate into one monstrous spirit being while Conan sleeps just as a group of Stygian slave traders enters to escape the rains. The spirit monster is attracted to them because there is more “food” upon which to eat. The monster made up of hundreds of heads, arms, and legs, attacks and in the confusion, Conan makes his escape.\n\nThe Snout in the Dark. This story was rewritten by de Camp/Carter from an outline and the first half of a rough draft started by Howard. It is published here for the first time and later reprinted The Conan Chronicles Volume 1: The People of the Black Circle (Gollancz, 2000) and Conan of Cimmeria: Volume One (1932-1933) (Del Rey, 2003).\n\nIt’s a story of political intrigue and murder that takes place in Kush within the walled city of Shumballa. The city is inhabited by the Gallahs, but ruled by arristocratic rulers called Chagas. The Queen is Tanada, but a noble, Tuthmes, wants the thrown. So he plots to overthrow her using a wizard who uses a pig-like demon that can materialize out of thin air. The queen has thrown Amboola, a person loved by the Gallahs into prison. Tuthmes kills him using the demon, then blames Tanada for his death. While Tanada is out riding in the city, the angered Gallahs attack. Just as Conan appears, who saves her life and is rewarded by becoming her Captain of the Guard and lover. In the end he thwarts Tuthmes plans but the Gallahs rise up and kill all the Chagas and Conan is on the road again.\n\nAll in all, Conan of Cimmeria was a fun read, pastiches and all. If you enjoy Conan no matter what, it might be fun to seek these books out. They’re available online inexpensively (unless you’re looking for first editions) from various used book outlets and to me, with the Frazetta covers, they make a fine addition to anyone’s Conan collection.\n\nOtherwise, if you just want your Conan as written by Howard, the Del Rey additions of The Coming of Conan the Cimmerian, The Conquering sword of Conan, and The Bloody Crown of Conan are mandatory. They present every Conan story as it was originally written, plus all of the fragments and outlines Howard wrote on his famed barbarian. Well worth seeking out.\n\nSo, until I finish Conan the Freebooter, remember: To crush your enemies — See them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of their women! (Which, not surprisingly, is actually a quote that Conan the Barbarian movie lifted from Harold Lamb’s book, Genghis Khan: The Emperor of All Men.)\n\n-30-\n\nLancer/Ace Conan\n\nLancer/Ace Conan of Cimmeria\n\nConan the Freebooter"
