        "text": "The genre of F&SF I love most is an old one, indeed one of the very first to emerge: 1912, to be exact. I was born more than half a century after that. Since then the genre has become a root inspiration for many other SF franchises, Star Wars among them. So exactly what is sword and planet? Is it science fiction at all?\n\nHere’s my riff on the Wikipedia definition: Sword and planet is that genre of science fiction or science fantasy of swashbuckling adventure and swordplay set on an exotic alien world. In film terms it’s Spartacus, Sinbad, and The Three Musketeers on Mars (substitute the planet of your choice for Mars). If you were to give it a taxonomy, it would be something like: Speculative Fiction > Science Fantasy > Planetary Romance > Sword and Planet. The genre was pioneered by Edgar Rice Burroughs, better known as the creator of Tarzan.\n\nWhat makes it different from Planetary Romance? While Planetary Romance deals with adventure on exotic alien worlds, Sword and Planet is about milieus where the action is anachronistic and often infused with anachronistic ideals like chivalry. Both feature adventures set primarily on a single planet, and that planet’s physical and social environment play large parts in the story. Both are differentiated from Space Opera by de-emphasis on interplanetary travel. Star Wars is more Space Opera because a lot of the action happens on board spacecraft, in between planets; while Flash Gordon is more Sword and Planet because the action all takes place on Mongo.\n\nSword and Planet fiction celebrates that most vital of science fictional themes, sense of wonder, with dramatic vistas of alien worlds, exotic and dangerous creatures, and fantastic technology overlaid with the barbaric trappings of the Medieval and Classical ages that are the root of so many of our myths. I think it’s that combination of the exotic with a familiar mythic core that makes it so appealing.\n\nBecause we need a familiar viewpoint, someone who can point out the contrasts between the story’s setting and the familiar, S&P fiction usually has a protagonist from Earth. Because of the time when most of these stories were written that protagonist was often male and white; but it’s a mold that invites breaking. Even Edgar Rice Burroughs broke it soon enough: Chessmen of Mars and A Fighting Man of Mars have native Martian protagonists, and Synthetic Men of Mars, though it features the Earthman John Carter, is mostly about the Martian Vor Daj.\n\nOver time, though, ERB and those who followed in his path introduced some tropes that have become weaknesses for the genre. There’s the overuse of the damsel in distress plot, and for many readers, the rather objectified portrayal of women. A friend told me his wife was hesitant to play the John Carter game because of the art; it seems Dejah Thoris just keeps getting sexier in artists’ heads, to the point that she does Sports Illustrated poses topless during combat in some recent comics. I’m a hetero male and I like sexy women, but yeah, there is such a thing as overdose of that. Nudity in general became a lazy trope to to mark the milieu as exotic.\n\nAnother trope that got overused is the Earthman as Superman. As the protagonist of a story has to be a vital agent, the sole Earthling of most S&P often got so much power and plot immunity that he got Marty Stu-ish. John Carter is super-strong on Mars, and the telepathic Martians can never read his mind. I think that’s the reason that of all the Barsoom novels the one I enjoyed the most is A Fighting Man of Mars, as the native Martian hero wins through with nothing but his own Marsborn wits and skill. I think this trope’s overuse was made worse by ERB’s often depicting his villains as stupid; while this was usually his means of poking fun at something, such as Nazism or religion, it starts to feel like he’s saying White Earthman Smart, Native Stupid after a while.\n\nSo. How to revive modern reader interest in Sword and Planet? Make no mistake, while I see the weaknesses ERB had, I still enjoy much of his work. I’ve also had the fortune to read some of the better S&P works by other authors that stand the test of time quite well. Here’s a list of my recommended Sword and Planet for the 21st Century Reader:"
