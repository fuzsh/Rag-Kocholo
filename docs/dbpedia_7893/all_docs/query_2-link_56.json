        "text": "There’s sort of a recurring theme to a few of the books I’ve read recently, so I’ll expound on that in these three reviews. Tales from the Perilous Realm, by J.R.R. Tolkien – This volume collects some of Tolkien’s short … Continue reading →\n\nWARNING! SPOILERS! Pearl – We watched this on Wednesday night in preparation for the release of Maxxine. It’s a prequel to X, providing the background for the murderous old lady played by Mia Goth, the same actress as Maxine. While … Continue reading →\n\nWARNING! SPOILERS! Don’t Look Now – This movie starts with a girl drowning when she goes into a pond after a ball. Children in movies really need to stop chasing after objects, although I guess you can also meet frog princes that way. That’s … Continue reading →\n\nRumo and His Miraculous Adventures, by Walter Moers – Rumo of Zamonia made a brief appearance in the first book in the Zamonia series, but this story does not intersect with that one, although it takes place in the same … Continue reading →\n\nWhat Moves the Dead, by T. Kingfisher – This is an adaptation and expansion of Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Fall of the House of Usher,” which I read in preparation for this. It contains other references as well, with the … Continue reading →\n\nThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz, by L. Frank Baum – There was some discussion on a Facebook group I’m on of having a discussion of one Oz book a month, and while I don’t know that anything was ever officially … Continue reading →\n\nSomething About Eve: A Comedy of Fig-Leaves, by James Branch Cabell – The books in this series that I’ve read so far are pretty formulaic, usually about a somewhat sleazy guy who philosophizes a lot without doing much of anything, … Continue reading →\n\nDragon Quest IV was pretty amazing when I played it on the NES, so I made sure to pick up a copy of the DS remake in 2008, after which I played through most of the game and then set … Continue reading →\n\nThe First Kothar the Barbarian Megapack, by Gardner F. Fox – This collects three different volumes, Kothar: Barbarian Swordsman (itself originally published as three short stories), Kothar of the Magic Sword, and Kothar and the Demon Queen. The author is … Continue reading →\n\nSPOILERS for all five of these! I had meant to write about some of them earlier, but I haven’t been feeling well as of late. Quiet on Set: The Dark Side of Kids TV – This is a four-part documentary … Continue reading →"
