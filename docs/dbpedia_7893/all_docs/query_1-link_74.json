        "text": "So I thought it might be fun if we discussed what our personal Appendix N or Moldvay's 'Source for Inspirational Reading' is.\n\nHow you define that is up to you but I'd suggest we keep the list to a Top Ten so it doesn't become too unwieldy.\n\nIt could be what sources of fiction or with Moldvay's list as an example non-fiction that inspires your play now, or a list of what inspired your play when you first started playing rpgs.\n\nOr anything else you think of, Gygax mentions comics and films but doesn't list any but no reason we can't.\n\nMy Appendix N is going to take the approach of what I was most into when I discovered and played D&D as a kid and a teen.\n\nIronically although I was obsessed with D&D as a kid I was never a big fantasy or sf fiction reader until my early adulthood so some of my choices will range from the obvious to the odd.\n\nHere is my list in no particular order.\n\n1. Conan the Barbarian/Savage Sword of Conan\n\nI read some scattered Howard stories as a kid but this film directed by Milius and written by Oliver Stone and the B&W Savage Sword had the much bigger impact on me until I came to read Howard more extensively as an adult.\n\nSavage Sword I loved for the B&W art, shocking (to me) violence and occasional nudity.\n\n2. The Hobbit\n\nObvious sure but one of the few fantasy novels I was taken with as a kid. Still prefer it to LotR as (among other things) I think Bilbo is more interesting as a protagonist and Smaug is a great villain.\n\n3. Dune\n\nThe Lynch film was my Star Wars as a kid. I watched it so often I still have large chunks of the over-the-top dialogue memorized.\n\nOdd that I only got around to reading the book years later although I'm slowly working my way through a re-read now in between other books.\n\n4. Excalibur/The Once and Future King\n\nExcalibur was another film I was obsessed with as a kid, it seemed to be on afternoon TV all the time and it led me to White's masterpiece which remains one of the best fantasy novels I've read. If anything it set the bar so high that one reason I didn't become a big fantasy reader until later in life was because most of what I encountered didn't measure up to it. This novel and film is why I instantly bought Pendragon when I discovered it hidden on the shelf in the local comic shop and opened my mind to a world of games beyond D&D.\n\n5. The Chrysalids by John Wyndham.\n\nThis post-apocalyptic sf novel with its psionic mutant kids struck my imagination like few others and led me to read a long string of very 70s/80s post-apoc sf novels for teens, which led me to my next pick...\n\n6. Brother in the Land by Robert Swindells.\n\nThis book moved and scarred me in equal measure as a kid. It hit me at just the right time as it at first seems to play to an adolescent's fantasies about what a post-apoc world would be like before crushing those fancies with one of the most realistic portraits of what a post-nuclear war world would really be like comparable to the equally devasting TV film Testament.\n\nI grew up next to a military base and went to school with navy brats who enrolled in cadets, etc. so nuclear war haunted my imagination like little else (besides girls) in the 1980s.\n\n7. The Dungeons & Dragons cartoon. My grognard credentials just went out the window since I wasn't milk fed on a steady diet of Moorcock and Leiber like alot seem to claim.\n\nI can't recall what came first, this cartoon or one of my older brothers bringing home the Red Box and roping his younger brothers into playing. But I loved this cartoon as a kid, probably moreso than He-Man and Transformers but definitely not as much as Star Blazers, Robotech and Looney Tunes.\n\nToday like a lot of 80s Saturday morning cartoons I find it very bad indeed but I retain those fond memories.\n\n8. Endless Quest books. Again, terminally uncool and slighted by modern adult gamers, especially when compared to Fighting Fantasy but these books were beloved by me and many other kids in my youth.\n\nFor some reason I never encountered FF which I'm sure I'd have obsessed over. But it was the wonderful interior artwork by Jeff Easley, Jim Holloway and Larry Elmore that engaged as much, if not more, than the CYOA books themselves.\n\nWhen I found a few used I was shocked to find how much the artwork had burrowed into my mind. Mountain of Mirrors and Return to Brookmere must have been the ones I owned as those are the ones I most remember.\n\n9. Heroes, Gods and Monsters by Bernard Evslin. Evslin's modern retelling of classic myths for young readers, including most memorably for me the terrible Fall of Troy, is a model for clean, polished prose that didn't shy away from the often horrific content of the original tales.\n\nRead this when I was 12 or 13 and it was ground zero for blowing my mind. I loved how fantastic, violent and sexual these old Greek myths were.\n\nAlthough I didn't realize it at the time, I would have referred to it as 'dark,' it was the consistently tragic nature of these myths that most engaged me.\n\nIt also wiped out any ideas I may have had that people from the past were somehow ignorant or less sophisticated as we were as the world-weary stoicism and wisdom of the Greek viewpoint of life so resonated with me then and now.\n\nIt led me to read the Iliad, the Odyssey, ancient poetry and history and even via the backdoor to Joyce's masterful Dubliners.\n\n10. The Adventures of Robin Hood. So yeah, another movie but what a movie. This film is pure joy from start to finish when Flynn walks in with a deer on his back until the climatic and still classic swordfight with the death of the wonderful Basil Rathbone.\n\nThis film opened my young mind to the fact that older films weren't really 'old' and in tone inspired so much of what I wanted from a fantasy game but only captured in flashes.\n\nTrying to get this feel into a game is what drove me to seek out lighter, quicker systems I think as 2e D&D got bogged down in layers and layers of rules and options.\n\nThis is a great thread, and a continual topic of discussion around my gaming table. I have a core group of books which influenced my early gaming and I suspect that core hasn't changed a lot over the decades, but my family has read essentially none of those books.\n\nFor me it would be the following (in no definite order)\n\n1. Robert E. Howard. Mostly the ACE Conan series, but other characters as I found them. Howard told stories in a way none have duplicated.\n\n2. Fritz Leiber. Fafhrd & the Grey mouser tales read like early D&D adventures, but were written before OD&D.\n\n3. Tolkien. My concept of elves and dwarves and hobbits and wizards and .... well, they often came from the Professor.\n\n4. Edgar Rice Burroughs. John Carter and Barsoom and the \"save the princess\" model of storytelling is amazing.\n\nThose are the books that grabbed me the most in my teens, and the ones that shaped my concept of what an RPG game \"ought\" to look like. Later I would add a couple more.\n\n5. Michael Moorcock. Elric and Corum and others having a battle of law versus chaos.\n\n6. Roger Zelazny. Amber and Dilvish and Lord Demon help to define the smartass character.\n\n7. Jim Butcher. (Much later, obviously.) The Dresden Files shaped my idea of a modern magic campaign. My favorite living author.\n\nI'd prefer for my personal Appendix N to be short, and not a list of every book on my shelf. Those are mostly the books that I've read over and over and continue to serve as the inspiration for the way I see RPGs.\n\nNow, the problem I have is that my wife is more into Mercedes Lackey and Anne McCaffrey, my sister likes mysteries and Watership Down, and my son is into Warhammer and 40K fiction. Not much intersection in the Venn Diagram, sadly, so things that my high school buddied \"just got\" in the 70's often have to be explained in greater depth to my current group.\n\nThis is a great thread, and a continual topic of discussion around my gaming table.

Not much intersection in the Venn Diagram, sadly, so things that my high school buddied \"just got\" in the 70's often have to be explained in greater depth to my current group.\n\nAll of those are important authors for me - Zelazny & Burroughs slightly less for me than the others, but all good. Have run 2 campaigns in the Dresdenverse.\n\nI would add\n\nDavid Gemmell - really strong story's, with flawed characters seeking redemption. Heroic, but with a seam of darkness and happy endings not guaranteed.\n\nJoe Abercrombie - very well written characters. His playing of WHFRP definitely evidenced. Dark, cynical, but understands his characters flaws and makes them likeable.\n\nJack Vance - wonderfully ornate and droll fantasy. Love his imagination, best writer of Science Fantasy IMHO.\n\nDefinitely going to go with some non books. Again in no particular order, apart from some category grouping.\n\n1. Diana Wynne Jones - Charmed Life\n\nThe first author I ever truly fell in love with and I'm still a fan today. Her books are brimming with ideas and world building, with plot twists worthy of a murder mystery writer. And crucially, she always wrote for children, but never wrote down to them. It is my staunchly held view that she's one of the greatest British fantasy writers of last century and that only gets overlooked because of a snobbery about \"juvenile\" literature.\n\n2. Eva Ibbotson - The Great Ghost Rescue\n\nNot quite as great as Wynne Jones, but still very good indeed. Where Wynne Jones was fantasy, Ibbotson's strength was modern supernatural and even horror. There's a real warmth and humanity in her books and her characterisation is top notch.\n\n3. Mark Smith & Jamie Thomson - Way of the Tiger\n\nI toyed with whether to include gamebooks here, but they were undoubtably a major route into RPGs for me. While I played them, I was never that much of a fan of Fighting Fantasy compared to some of the others. These were probably my favourite. Orb was Smith and Thomson's D&D campaign setting and the level of detail showed that. Also, I was the right age to think \"martial arts plus high fantasy\" was a very cool idea. These also excited me by playing with the format; you got to run a city and make tactical wargame decisions in later books.\n\n4. 2000 AD\n\nI think you'd be hard pressed to find British roleplayers of a certain generation not influenced by Slaine, Dredd, Nemesis and the rest. Very much a comic that felt of the \"now\".\n\n5. Misty\n\nI\n\nI wasn't quite old enough to get this originally and naturally I wouldn't have been seen buying a \"comic for girls\" anyway. But the kids I babysat for had all the annuals and I devoured them. From the same publisher and with many of the same writers as 2000 AD, there has never been a comic like Misty before or since. The stories were genuinely spooky, even terrifying. This is best illustrated with an example:\n\nDay of the Dragon — Gayle learns that she is the reincarnation of a young Chinese woman who killed herself to escape a forced marriage to an evil man. But the man, also reincarnated, has now found Gayle and wants to claim his bride\n\nWinner Loses All — Sandy sells her soul to the Devil to save her alcoholic father. The Devil gives her a horse named Satan (conjured to life from a picture on the sign outside a pub) so that Sandy can fulfill her dream of becoming a show-jumping champion; but, if anyone guesses where the horse came from, the deal will be broken and Sandy will go to hell for all eternity.\n\nFancy Another Jelly Baby? — A girl begins to question why a sweet shop's jelly babies look like the local children who have been reported missing.\n\nMisty's big innovation was understanding that girls like being scared too.\n\n6. Deadline\n\nMostly remembered as the comic that brought us Tank Girl, Deadline was to 17 year old me what 2000 AD was to 14 year old me. Full of swearing, sex, drugs and rock and roll (it also did music articles about painfully hip rock bands), it can probably be blamed for my later Vampire LARP career. I believe it was also the first comic I ever saw with boobs in it, which I greatly appreciated.\n\n7. Blue Öyster Cult\n\nAs you might be able to tell, I wasn't into the \"classic\" fantasy that much. (Quite liked The Hobbit. Got very bored by Lord of the Rings). But why would I need to be, when BÖC had it covered for me with their songs about Godzilla, Nosferatu, Elric and, um, Joan Crawford? This was my entry into a high fantasy world, helped along the way by the fact it rocked and it rocked hard.\n\n8. Hawkwind\n\nAnd this was my other \"roleplaying band\". They made me feel like LSD before I was in fact on LSD. Just look at that album cover. While BÖC visited other worlds, Hawkwind came from them. Any time my fantasy RPG gets weird and gonzo, I think there's a little bit of Hawkwind in there.\n\n9. Knightmare\n\nAnother attempt to recreate the magic of RPGs on television. This shouldn't have worked. Get a kid in a helmet so he can't see, get his mates to shout advice at him and have him go through a dungeon via the magic of the green room. And yet... It was glorious. With a level of difficulty that put adult gameshows to shame (in its seven year run only eight teams got through the dungeon), this was Dark Souls before Dark Souls. Absolutely no patronising \"everyone wins\" here. You were almost certainly going to die horribly. (I had a real issue with being talked down to as a kid).\n\n10. Dramarama\n\nAn ITV children's series of one off dramas, most of which had a supernatural or sci fi theme. I found out years later this was part of a power struggle between the new and old guard at the ITV children's department and this made perfect sense. This wasn't Auntie Beeb trying to educate me, this was shows for me with a cast who took that seriously.\n\nI think I was thirteen when I got into the D&D in 1987 and I wasn't a big fantasy reader at that time, but I was obsessive about drawing, painting and did love me some cartoons and fantasy movies so my Appendix N was pretty heavily influenced by visual media.\n\nBooks & Comics:\n\n1. The Hobbitt - I read this when I was about 8 or 9 and re-read it all the time for years thereafter. I think I bounced off of Lord of the Rings the first time I tried it at 11 or 12.\n\n2. D'Aulaire's Book of Greek Myths - This thing was in my elementary school library and from about 3rd grade all the way through 6th I would read this thing at lunch and constantly check it out and re-check it out. The illustrations were amazing and the world it depicted made me wish I'd been born 3,000 years earlier.\n\n3. Treasure Island - The idea of going off to adventure with pirates as a small boy seemed pretty awesome at the time.\n\n4. Groo - I loved all things Mad Magazine, so getting hooked on Sergio Argonnes brain-dead barbarian was easy. Groo ultimately lead me to reading Conan stories, first the Robert Jordan books from Tor, then De Camp, and finally I stumbled on to Howard in my late teens and realized what I had been missing so that was pretty cool too.\n\n5. Hawkmoon - I think I read this at almost the same time I started playing D&D, but maybe like a month or two before? A good friend of mine loaned it to me and I don't think I ever gave it back. Thereafter I think I tried to checkout every book by Moorcock that was available at the public library. I remember actively disliking Elric at the time, but I loved Corum, the Oswald Bastable books, Von Bek, and could barely make heads or tails of Jerry Cornelius\n\nFilms & TV:\n\n1. Thundarr The Barbarian - The weird mix of science-fantasy in a ruined far future earth really struck a nerve and probably explains why I love Jack Vance's Dying Earth and Gene Wolfe's Book of the New Sun so much.\n\n2. Ridley Scott's Legend - Even then I thought Tom Cruise sucked, but Tim Curry's Lord of Darkness and the visual design of the goblins and the faeries is still the image I have in my mind of fantasy. I think I was mildly disappointed at how banal goblins were in D&D when I finally encountered them later that year.\n\n3. Dragonslayer - I remember being struck by how bleak and hopeless the world portrayed in this movie seemed at the time and how unfair it was that all of these girls were being sacrificed to appease the dragon, but it definitely informed my perception of quasi-medieval life\n\n4. Time Bandits - This movie blew my mind when I saw it. I remember feeling really jealous that the little boy got to go live with the ancient greeks for a time and I always resented that they didn't let him chill out with Sean Connery in his palace. This started my life-long love affair with Terry Gilliam's films, and there's always a little bit of his surreal, absurdist crap floating around in the fantasy games I've run.\n\n5. Clash of the Titans - Who wouldn't want to wear a helm of invisibility and ride around on Pegasus?\n\nI think I was thirteen when I got into the D&D in 1987 and I wasn't a big fantasy reader at that time, but I was obsessive about drawing, painting and did love me some cartoons and fantasy movies so my Appendix N was pretty heavily influenced by visual media.\n\nBooks & Comics:\n\n1.

Clash of the Titans - Who wouldn't want to wear a helm of invisibility and ride around on Pegasus?\n\nWe must be about the same age! Groo, D'Aulaire's Greek (and Norse) Myths, and Time Bandits were all very influential. I haven't even thought about Groo (and what Groo does best!) in decades."
