Sprague de camp\n\n1) the coming of conan 1953\n\n2) conan the barbarian 1954\n\n3) the sword of conan 1952\n\n4) King conan 1953\n\n5) conan the conqueror aka ( the hour of the dragon) 1950\n\n6) The Return of conan 1957 with de camp and Bjorn Nyberg\n\n7) Tales of conan 1955\n\nhave yet to read these but they are slowly being made into e books.\n\nI plan to get the that one and the other two books in that trilogy. the one I got seems to be de camp stories.\n\nRe: Robert e Howard,Edgar rice Burroughs & H.P.lovecraft comics & book\n\nthis is one of my favorite series by burroughs and here is my reading list for john carter of mars:\n\na Princess of mars\n\nthe gods of mars\n\nthe warlord of mars\n\nThuvia maid of mars\n\nThe chessmen of mars\n\nThe master mind of mars\n\na fighting man of mars\n\nsword of mars\n\nsynthetic men of mars\n\nLIana of gathol\n\nJohn carter of mars\n\nand here are two that were written by his son\n\njohn carter and the giant of mars\n\nskeleton men of Jupiter\n\nnow last two I have never read and are the hardest to find and I am hoping soon\n\nthat all the books will be in e form.\n\nwell the good news is all but john carter of mars is aviable on the nook. which is fantastic the only bad thing is it's none of the frazetta books.\n\nRe: Robert e Howard,Edgar rice Burroughs & H.P.lovecraft comics & book\n\nRather bad and confusing John Carter movie poster. Is that supposed to be JC in the poster? He looks more like one of the aliens!\n\n(And as for Harry Potter, that kid just can't look \"bad-ass\" - poor strategy to make him try.)\n\nI agree on both counts bad posters but at least we have a movie date now. so thanks for the link and here's hoping the movie is better than the poster.\n\nget you're ass to mars....\n\nRe: Robert e Howard,Edgar rice Burroughs & H.P.lovecraft comics & book\n\nLANCER/ACE paperback editions 1966 - 1977 these are all so books co written by L. sprague de camp and lin carter with art by the great Frank Frazetta:\n\n1) conan 1968\n\n2) conan of cimmeria 1969\n\n3) conan the freebooter 1968\n\n4) conan the wanderer 1968\n\n5) conan the adventurer 1966\n\n6) conan the Buccaneer 1971\n\n7) conan the warrior 1967\n\n8) conan the usurper 1967\n\n9) conan the conqurer aka the hour of the dragon 1967\n\n10) conan the avenger aka the return of conan 1968\n\n11) conan the aquilonia 1977\n\n12) conan of the isles 1968\n\nnow these books I have read mostly because I loved the art so much. and this is where I came into conan for books.\n\nI first came to Conan through the Lancer editions, as did most people. However, I would suggest that any readers now first coming to the series stick to Howard's originals, as they are readily availible in many trade paperback editions (as much of Howard's work is now in the public domain).\n\nI read the first Lancer compilation under the impression that it was all Howard's work, and not knowing that it consisted mostly of pastiches by L. Sprague DeCamp and Lin Carter. There were seven or eight stories in that first volume. When I finished it, I said to myself, well two of the stories in that book were awesome, but the others were kinda lame. Guess this Howard fella wasn't all he's cracked up to be.\" Later on, of course, I learned that the two stories I liked were the only two original Howard stories in that first volume."
