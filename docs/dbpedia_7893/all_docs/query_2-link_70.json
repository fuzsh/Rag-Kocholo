        "text": "by Gary Romeo\n\nAnybody that knows me, knows that I am a big fan of the Lancer Conan series. A long time ago I acquired some copies of the “Royalty Report” forms that Lancer Books provided L. Sprague de Camp when the Lancer bankruptcy was going on.\n\nAt that time I didn’t have a blog, didn’t really have a way of sharing them, and didn’t really know what to do with them. But now I do have a blog, can share them, and so now will try to see if they have anything significant to say.\n\nAs most reading this probably know, Lancer Books declared bankruptcy on October 10, 1973. One of their hottest properties was the Conan series as edited by L. Sprague de Camp. When Sprague heard about Lancer going under he immediately wrote a letter to his colleagues Glenn Lord, Lin Carter and Bjorn Nyberg. Carbon copies went to his lawyer Cecil Catron and Lin Carter’s agent, Henry Morrison.\n\nLancer owed de Camp for unpaid royalties at the time of the bankruptcy and these royalty reports forms were part of the court proceedings. I have a report form for each of the 11 Lancer books. I’ve collated the results onto the table below:\n\nConan of Aquilonia was not published by Lancer. I included it on the table but probably shouldn’t have. Oh well. I do not have figures for the Prestige/Ace paperbacks. This chart is only for the Lancer books. The books are listed in order of copies sold with #1 selling the most. Full title and year of publication are given. REH stands for Robert E. Howard, LSdC for L. Sprague de Camp, LC for Lin Carter, and BN for Bjorn Nyberg. In the “Artist” column, FF indicates Frank Frazetta, JD is for John Duillo, and BV is Boris Vallejo.\n\nThe royalty amount is higher for some books even though fewer copies were sold. Most likely de Camp negotiated a higher royalty for that particular book. These figures come from Lancer Books (those Royalty Reports) and may or may not be completely accurate. Lancer would have had a financial incentive to UNDER REPORT for obvious reasons but as these figures were presented as part of court proceedings they are probably reasonably accurate.\n\nWhat do they tell us?\n\nAdding up the royalties paid column I get $71,423.75. There was $10,116.55 in unpaid royalties at the time of the bankruptcy. De Camp split the royalties among the Howard heirs, Lin Carter, and Bjorn Nyberg based on whatever percentage agreements were made at the time a contract was signed. It is easy to see that Conan royalties added considerably to everyone’s income.\n\nThe total copies sold add up to 1,970,472. Close to 2 million copies. Previously I heard the figure for the Lancers was 3 million. In any event the books were best sellers and continued to sell well when Prestige/Ace took over the publishing.\n\nIt does not appear that REH only volumes sold significantly better than the multi-authored ones except for Conan the Conqueror. Conan of the Isles sold better than some books with REH content. Perhaps it sold well by being the last book (chronologically) of the series. Conan the Buccaneer was the most recently published book at this time and that may account for the lower sales.\n\nThe cover artist does not seem as much of a factor as previously rumored. Frank Frazetta has the top books but Conan the Wanderer with John Duillo cover art sold more than several of the other books with Frazetta covers.\n\nThese “Royalty Report” forms give us some information about the success of the Lancers before the bankruptcy. The details of all the infighting and aborted deals that took place during the bankruptcy are still hazy. I’m working on getting more information about all that but that could take a long while.\n\nDe Camp did write about the bankruptcy in his autobiography, Time and Chance, Donald M. Grant, 1996. According to de Camp there was 3 and a half years of litigation which he financed on behalf of the Howard heirs and himself. De Camp remembers a grueling cross-examination by the Lancer lawyer and apparently it upset him enough to recall it in his autobiography. “The lawyer bellowed at me until even the judge called him down, saying: “Mr. Weinberger, couldn’t you address the witness in an ordinary tone of voice? I don’t believe he is deaf.”\n\nEventually the rights to publish Conan in paperback was divided between Ace and Bantam Books. Ace reprinting the Lancer series and Bantam publishing new adventures. Conan Properties, Inc. was formed. De Camp sums up:\n\nHopefully all this was interesting to most. On a personal note I must say I wished more people subscribed to this blog. The recent post I did reviewing Blood of the Serpent is currently close to 800 views! On average I get anywhere from 75 to 150 views depending on the topic. I’m satisfied with those numbers for the most part but I do wish more would actually “follow” the blog. It’s painless, you get an email, which you can simply ignore or not. I plan to review more new books and present more actual letters and rarer items in the future. Follow the blog and get a reminder! Easy, peasy, and I know I’m being cheesy but go ahead and do the “follow” thing. Thanks in advance.\n\nby Gary Romeo\n\nAfter participating in the Howard Days panel about the Lancer Conan series https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvkXTwZlzDc I realized quite a few are interested in Lancer Books and the later Zebra Books. The presentation (and my previous article) concentrated on Frazetta’s influence but now lets talk a little more about Irwin Stein and Walter Zacharius, the founders of Lancer Books\n\nIrwin Stein had a journalist background but had an affinity for comic books and science fiction. He wrote for Quality Comics (chiefly known for Jack Cole’s Plastic Man) and later the romance comics line for St. John. When he left comic books to start his own company, Royal Publications, he published genre magazines (men’s adventures, detective, SF, monsters).\n\nStein and Zacharius became partners somewhere along the line. They formed Magnum Communications Corporation. One of their first purchases was Swank Magazine. Martin Goodman (Timely/Atlas/Marvel) was the owner at that time. Swank had a reputation as a quality men’s magazine. Aficionados of these things say the quality took a slightly downward slide after their takeover. Magnum Publications also included Untamed, Lion Adventures and True War.\n\nThey then started Lancer Books in 1961. Later Stein hired Larry Shaw as editor. Shaw was instrumental in acquiring the Conan series and in getting Frazetta to illustrate the first cover. Mr. Shaw was honored with a special Hugo Award for lifetime achievement in 1984, a year before his death.\n\nThe early Lancer books had a distinctive green (often bluish looking) edge around the pages. 1962 saw the start of the Lancer Science Fiction Library. These sold for 75 cents at a time when most paperbacks were only 50 cents. Lancer realized they were pitching to a specialty market that would pay a premium. In 1966 they began publishing paperback originals with the purple colored edges. One notable entry was Michael Moorcock (writing as Edward P. Bradbury) doing a Martian series that owed a great deal to Edgar Rice Burroughs.\n\nFor Robert E. Howard fans, the key year was 1966, and the publication of Conan the Adventurer. There is no need to rehash that story again; suffice to say everyone knew that the Frazetta cover was a smash!\n\nStein in an interview, from Confessions, Romances, Secrets, and Temptations: Archer St. John and the St. John Romance Comics by John Benson, talks about that first Conan painting:\n\n“Yes, those covers really put him on the map, I think. He was known mostly to the fans at the time. I tried to keep one of the paintings, and he threatened to come up with a gun. Well, most of the cover artists, if you said you liked something, they’d say, “Keep it.” What the hell, they had very little residual value at the time. But Frazetta always had a huge sense of his own worth. And rightfully so. Generally there were very few that I really wanted to keep for myself. But that was one of them, and I asked him for it.”\n\nIn 1968 they reissued Conan the Adventurer and issued Conan the Wanderer at 95 cents. From the fanzine, Megavore, which featured a Lancer SF Checklist in their 10th issue comes this comment:\n\n“It tells you something about the popularity of the series that Lancer could jump the price so rapidly and not have to worry about the effect it would have on sales.”\n\nLancer was doing well and besides the Conan books published Howard’s King Kull, The Dark Man and Others, and Wolfshead. Larry Shaw left Lancer in 1968. He was replaced by Robert Hoskins. Hoskins, apparently a fan of S&S, edited an anthology Swords Against Tomorrow for Signet Books that mentions REH as a literary descendant of Homer.\n\n1971 saw the change from purple edges to yellow and 1973 saw the bankruptcy.\n\nThe details of the bankruptcy can probably be found with enough patience and access to legal archives but suffice to say Lancer Books was no more. Magnum Communications Corporation continued on with various publishing ventures and at least three other non-publishing ventures: Vacation Ownership Marketing; Capital Solutions I, and Fuda Faucet Works.\n\nGerald Jones in Men of Tomorrow: Geeks, Gansters and the Birth of the Comic Book tells the story of Harry Donnenfeld. Donnenfeld started National (DC) comics. Donnenfeld apparently had ties to gangster Frank Costello. New York publishers bought a lot of paper shipped from Canada. Canada was in full liquor production during the failed U.S. experiment of prohibition. Along with shipments of paper there was plenty of booze. So pretty much all publishers of exploitation literature (comics, pornography, and men’s adventures) have rumors of mob money.\n\nAs mentioned before Stein and Zacharius purchased Swank from Martin Goodman (of Marvel Comics fame) and Stein worked for various comic book companies. So, yes, they traveled in the same circles as Donnenfeld and others that might have had mob ties. No doubt pornography publishing makes strange bedfellows but no real evidence of organized crime exists. There was the occasional article in the SFWA Bulletin newsletter about Lancer not paying royalties and offering lame excuses and after the Lancer bankruptcy their remaining publishing arm, Magnum Books, republished books from the Lancer catalog that were in violation of previous contracts. So there were shady-doings but nothing that other publishers had not set as a precedent.\n\nAfter the Lancer bankruptcy Walter Zacharius chose to start the Kensington Publishing Corporation (which included Zebra Books) with a new partner, Roberta Grossman. Apparently there was a falling out with Stein but other than a very brief mention in Publishing Romance: The History of an Industry, 1940s to the Present by John Markert not much has been said.\n\nZebra Books published 14 REH books:\n\nThe Sowers of the Thunder\n\nTigers of the Sea\n\nWorms of the Earth\n\nA Gent From Bear Creek\n\nThe Vultures of Whapeton\n\nThe Incredible Adventures of Dennis Dorgan\n\nThe Lost Valley of Iskander\n\nThe Iron Man\n\nThe Book of Robert E, Howard\n\nThe Second Book of Robert E. Howard\n\nPigeons From Hell\n\nBlack Vulmea’s Vengeance\n\nThe Sword Woman\n\nThree Bladed Doom\n\nAccording to Leon Nielsen in Robert E. Howard: A Collector’s Descriptive Bibliography:\n\n“[the] books were selling so well that Zebra capitalized on its success by adding the line, “Heroic fantasy in the tradition of ROBERT E. HOWARD” to the front cover of any book that might fit loosely into the category of heroic fantasy.”\n\nSecond only to Frazetta as a fan favorite, most of the REH Zebra books featured art by Jeff Jones.\n\nJeff Jones (later known as Jeffrey Catherine Jones) had loads of artistic talent. If Frazetta was power, then Jones was poetry. I think it is possible her standing among REH fans could surpass Frank Frazetta one day. Her best work is breathtaking if not always true to the story.\n\nWalter Zacharius was always an innovator. Early in his career he help start the Ace Double Novel line (along with Aaron Wyn), and with Kensington he signed deals with Wal-Mart and QVC, and made the first forays into e-books.\n\nOne of his more exploitative tricks was during the height of Lee Iacocca’s success with the automobile corporation, Chrysler. Iacocca was popularly known as an innovative entrepreneur (there was talk of him running for President, as if Americans would vote for someone with no political experience!) He had a best-selling autobiography eating up the sales chart. Zacharius republished a previously little read paperback with the same title and it ended up as one of the best selling paperbacks of 1985.\n\nEven with his other successes the Lancer Conan series was a hallmark. His New York Times obituary had this to say in summing up his accomplishments:\n\n“With Irwin Stein, [Walter Zacharius] founded Lancer Books in 1961 to publish genre fiction, primarily science fiction and fantasy, notably the “Conan the Barbarian” stories of Robert E. Howard…”\n\nThe New York Times knew “those were books!”\n\nby Gary Romeo\n\nOver at YouTube there was a clip available of actor/comedian Joe Rogan giving a spirited defense of Robert E. Howard and Conan. The Podcast host gives a hyper-macho somewhat humorous speech about the greatness of REH and Conan. What makes this important to this article is his summary statement:, “… you’d buy the paperbacks, with the Frank Frazetta oil paintings on the covers! Holy Shit! Those were books!”\n\nWhile fans can argue over his comments about REH’s sanity, you can’t argue with his conclusion. The Lancer paperbacks are totemic. They’ve become a distinctive and venerated symbol of sword and sorcery.\n\nLet’s rehash the familiar story. REH died in 1936 and Conan seemed a goner as well. There was talk of other authors continuing the adventures of Conan but Farnsworth Wright put the kibosh on that idea.\n\nThe Conan stories remained uncollected except for a few that were reprinted in Arkham House’s Skull-face and Others. Derleth said jokingly, the complete stories would need to “printed on blood-colored paper.”\n\nThen publisher Martin Greenberg, whose reputation seems to be one of avoiding royalty payments to authors, along with longtime REH fan John D. Clark editing the first few volumes, began the Gnome Press editions. Author Fletcher Pratt gave a copy of Conan the Conqueror to L. Sprague de Camp. De Camp became an instant fan and took over the character for the next 40 years.\n\nGnome Press went out of business in 1962 and de Camp gambled on taking the books to another publisher. Legal wrangling between him and Greenberg came out in de Camp’s favor and Lancer editor Larry Shaw made the decision to start publishing Conan paperbacks.\n\nLancer Books existed from 1961 – 1973. Irwin Stein and Walter Zacharius were the men behind the curtain. Stein was a former magazine publisher who was betting paperback publishing was the better horse. Zacharius (also an author) was more the financial backer and when Lancer went bankrupt in 1973, he continued on with Zebra and Pinnacle Books.\n\nLarry Shaw, a science fiction writer, was no stranger to SF/Fantasy fandom and publishing and was aware of Frazetta and Krenkel’s art for Ace Books and their successful Edgar Rice Burroughs’ line. According to Arnie Fenner, writing in Icon, Shaw was astute enough to offer Frazetta “twice the pay rate he was getting from Ace and a provision that the original art would be returned to him.”\n\nAccording to Fenner, again from Icon, “Upon publication of the first cover, Conan the Adventurer in 1966, long-time friend and fellow illustrator Wallace Wood clapped Frank on the back and asked, “How’s it feel to be the world’s greatest cover artist?””\n\nConan the Adventurer sold well and was followed with more great Frazetta covers. Sometimes, it is said by the more Frazetta oriented fan, that his covers sold the books. It is, of course, axiomatic that an editor chooses art that sells books. Farnsworth Wright paid Margaret Brundage to sell Weird Tales, publishers paid Robert McGinnis to sell sexy thrillers, Bantam Books paid James Bama to sell Doc Savage and so on.\n\nBut REH’s fiction and the Conan character kept fans buying the books and turning them into million sellers. REH and Frazetta were the perfect combination. Other series with Frazetta covers did not sell as well and Frazetta’s own concepts like Death Dealer and Fire and Ice did not have the impact of Conan.\n\nDid Lancer Books know that Frazetta was such a hit? Even though Larry Shaw hired him and knew he was a talent, they hedged their bets in 1968. Five Conan books were published that year and three of the books featured cover art by John Duillo.\n\nWho knows the thinking at the time? Paying Frazetta for five covers might have been too expensive for the art budget (Frazetta was definitely asking for more money) or maybe they figured the books would sell anyway without Frazetta, or maybe it was an intentional decision to try another artist?\n\nDe Camp apparently had criticized the Frazetta look in some fanzines. I’m unaware of any specific criticisms but de Camp’s final words on the subject appeared in his autobiography Time and Chance. Sounding like your cranky grandpa de Camp writes:\n\n“Conan the Adventurer had a cover by Frank Frazetta, who painted covers for most of the Lancer Conans. Frazetta’s work was superior to that of most illustrators, but he gave Conan something I have objected to ever since. Robert Howard described Conan’s hair as a “square cut black mane,” implying a Prince Valiant bob. In 1966, however, the rage among rebellious youth was to let one’s hair grow long. So Frazetta gave Conan hair down to his solar plexus, and long-haired Conan has been ever since.”\n\nThe Lancer Books were easily available in most cities but rural consumers relied on other means. Jim Warren, publisher of Eerie, Creepy, and Vampirella had used Frazetta covers on his magazines. Jim Warren said he found advertisers avoided his “monster” magazines and he needed revenue from other streams other than newsstand sales. He created Captain Company to sell genre products to his readers. Rubber masks, TV tie-ins, posters, etc. The Captain Company ad for the Conan paperbacks had the iconic Frazetta barbarian but they did not overly stress Frazetta. Two of the four illustrations in the ad are of Duillo art. So, the thinking at the time favored the Conan name over Frazetta.\n\nFrazetta was back for Conan of Cimmeria in 1969, so maybe the Duillo books did sell less as Frazetta supporter’s claim. But printing history for the books does not really support this. Conan the Wanderer (Duillo) went through more printings than Conan the Usurper (Frazetta). So most likely there were letters and fanzine articles that simply clamored for Frazetta’s return and the books in total sold well enough to give the fans want they wanted.\n\nLancer obviously realized the popularity of Frazetta since they released a Conan poster in 1971 and it sold over 100,000 copies. Frazetta’s wife, who had a head for business, realized they should have a poster business of their own to sell Frazetta’s work. In the early ads for Frazetta posters they featured the Conan name prominently.\n\nAccording to Icon, business acrimony developed between Lancer and Frazetta over the Conan name being used in ads for the posters. The posters began appearing under new names. Conan the Conqueror became Berserker, Conan the Adventurer became Barbarian and so on.\n\nDespite the Conan phenomenon, Lancer went bankrupt in 1973, it took a while for the Conan books to be scarce but once they were the British Sphere series began appearing in the United States. They were heavily advertised as featuring the Frazetta covers.\n\nWith the Lancers out of print Frazetta began overshadowing REH, leading some Frazetta fans to credit Frazetta’s art as being the most successful element in the Conan series. But REH fandom was growing as well and the Marvel Comic was huge. Out of the ashes of Lancer, came Zebra Books. They placed their faith in REH and Jeff Jones.\n\nWhen Ace Books republished the Conan series, they had Boris Vallejo do the new volume Conan of Aquilonia and Vallejo later did new covers for the Duillo volumes but Frazetta remained the premiere artist.\n\n.\n\nREH and Frazetta are forever linked. Both have their own fandom and intermingling, of course, exists. After Frazetta, Conan’s popularity continued to rise with scores of new books from Bantam and Tor, two successful movies, and the continuing comics.\n\nFrazetta received his own volumes of illustrations. The Fantastic Art of Frank Frazetta published by Ballantine Books sold over 300,000 copies!\n\nToday Frazetta’s original Conan art has been sold for record prices. His repainting of Conan the Buccaneer sold for 1.5 million. Conan remains a popular character with graphic novels, planned films, and gaming modules.\n\nREH’s stories are pretty much vacant from the newsstand though. The book industry changed big time after the Thor Power ruling: http://www.sfwa.org/2005/01/how-thor-power-hammered-publishing/ so now paperback publishers no longer keep an inventory of classic SF/Fantasy authors unless their names are Tolkein, Heinlein, and Dick.\n\nConan books (in the U. S.) are currently mostly available online through the remaining stock of the Del-Rey volumes or public domain knock-offs. Will we ever see a revival of Conan? It is impossible to know. Conan is available in millions of old books, public domain collections, and even on-line pirated and non-pirated formats. We most likely will never see a groundswell like the Lancers ever again.\n\nBut Joe Rogan was right. Those were books!\n\nby Gary Romeo\n\nThere were a few Robert E. Howard books published between 1937 – 1965. None of them had the success of the Lancer Conan series. For better or worse, the Lancer Conan series introduced millions of readers to the works of Robert E. Howard.\n\nConan the Adventurer\n\nThe first book published in the Lancer series was Conan the Adventurer (1966). It features the seminal depiction of Conan by Frank Frazetta on the cover. Several fans credit the immediate success of the Conan series to this painting. There is undoubtedly some truth in that belief. The cover immediately grabs attention. It is starkly done in brown tones. There is a small swash of pale orange fire that highlights the stack of dead bodies that Conan stands astride. A wispy painted female figure holds onto Conan’s leg. A suggestion of sex overwhelmed by the images of skulls and weirdness in the background. An unnatural green tone highlights Conan’s muscles. It is a startling and fascinating painting.\n\nThe book also features several blurbs designed to attract the reader’s attention. Superlatives are dished out like M&Ms. The cover states, “The world’s greatest fantasy hero – ‘The ultimate in swashbuckling adventure’” the back cover states, “A hero mightier than Tarzan,” and “more imaginative than Lord of the Rings.” De Camp states on the back cover [Howard’s] tales are unsurpassed for vivid, colorful, headlong, gripping action.”\n\nThe whole package appeals to an immediate purchase. The book was a success and 10 more volumes followed. Clearly the writing contained therein proved to be the ultimate reason for the series’ continued success. The Frazetta paintings became a bonus instead of the reason for purchase.\n\nThe book starts with praise about the Conan character from artist Roy G. Krenkel. An introductory note states Robert E. Howard is a writer deserving a reputation comparable to Edgar Rice Burroughs. It also mentions that Howard had a tragic death but no details are given. The second page tells the reader a bit about Amra, a Conan fan organization. The copyright information tells the reader that L. Sprague De Camp completed one of the stories “Drums of Tombalku”. The rest of the stories are by Robert E. Howard, “The People of the Black Circle,” “The Slithering Shadow,” and “The Pool of the Black One.”\n\nA map of the Hyborian Age appears next, followed by an introduction by L. Sprague de Camp. De Camp gives only cursory details of Howard’s life. It is mentioned he lived a short life and from the dates given the reader can calculate Howard died at 30 years of age. There is no mention of the suicide. He mentions Howard’s westerns, detective fiction, and other genre writings. He praises REH’s writing and the Conan tales in particular. He states it his “good fortune” to edit the stories, complete the unfinished ones, and rewrite other REH stories as part of the Conan saga. He says Conan the Adventurer will be the fourth of eight volumes. He then goes on to explain the Hyborian Age and tells the reader of Conan’s previous exploits setting the stage for the stories in this collection. He continues the stage setting in brief introductions to each story throughout the volume.\n\nThis book was a great introduction to the character for readers unfamiliar with Robert E. Howard’s Conan. It set the standard for the following volumes. The next of which was Conan the Warrior.\n\nConan the Warrior\n\nConan the Warrior (1967) features another Frazetta painting. The primary colors are pale blue and a blue-green. Conan is painted in realistic flesh tones this time and seen in a long distance shot killing scores of naked savages while a serpent prepares to attack. Bright red blood drips from his axe. A pleasing cover although Conan’s facial expression seems a bit off and the naked savage in the bottom center detracts the eye from Conan.\n\nThe back covers call the three stories contained therein “glorious adventures by the greatest master of heroic fantasy.” The stories are “Red Nails,” “Jewels of Gwahlur,” and “Beyond the Black River.” There are no de Camp completions in this volume. The book follows the same format as the previous volume. Information about Amra, the copyright info, the map, then followed by an introduction.\n\nDe Camp begins by praising the genre of heroic fantasy. De Camp praises REH and cites some of his literary influences: Jack London, Talbot Mundy, Harold Lamb, Edgar Rice Burroughs, and H. P. Lovecraft. He praises Conan and again introduces the character to the reader. He states that the saga will be twelve volumes of which this is the seventh. He again sets the stage for the following stories.\n\nConan the Conqueror\n\nNext up is Conan the Conqueror (1967). This is another Frazetta classic. The primary color here is gray. A swash of reddish fire splits the painting into a dark gray sky and a raging battle. A pale gray Conan, in berserker rage, astride an armored horse is charging an army composed of men and animated skeletons. The back cover features a blurb by artist Roy Krenkel. “Howard’s words rang like strokes of brazen sledges on the anvil of some wargod’s smithy! This is not mere narration – his scenes of carnage evoke an almost tangible smell of blood. Our ears are deafened by the clash of sword and war-axe on buckler and mail. We flee, half mad with fear, through night-black, adder-haunted swamps…”\n\nAgain the same format is kept. De Camp gives the basic facts once again but adds mention of the historic roots of this type of fiction by mentioning William Morris, Lord Dunsany, and E. R. Eddison. He mentions this is the ninth of 12 volumes and the only book-length Conan novel. He briefly mentions Howard’s suicide and goes on to compare this novel with The Worm Ouroboros, The Well of the Unicorn, and The Fellowship of the Ring series. A little caveat is given, “While it may be inferior to some of these in literary grace or philosophical profundity, it yields to none in action, color, excitement, and headlong drive.” De Camp goes on to critically look at Howard but he sings his praises as a natural storyteller. He makes a comment that he kept the Conan the Conqueror title (from the 1950 Gnome Press hardcover edition) instead of the original name “because, while “The Hour of the Dragon” is intriguing, it has practically nothing to do with the narrative.” De Camp detractors have latched onto this comment with undue ferocity. It is definitely weak reasoning on de Camp’s part in this instance. The most likely reason for keeping the Conan the Conqueror title was to match it with the rest of the Lancer series’ naming convention.\n\nConan the Usurper\n\nThe next volume was Conan the Usurper (1967). Frazetta is back with another brown toned cover. Conan is chained to the floor while an impossibly huge snake slithers between his legs and coils back to face him with dripping fangs. Skeletons are piled in the corners and ghoulish figures watch on a staircase. This is an excellent cover that is impossible to resist. The scene was closely duplicated in the “Conan the Barbarian” movie.\n\nThe back cover calls Conan, “Fantasy-Adventure’s most colorful hero.” The book contains two de Camp revisions, “The Treasure of Tranicos,” and “Wolves Beyond the Border,” along with two Howard stories, “The Phoenix on the Sword,” and “The Scarlet Citadel.” Again the same format is followed. De Camp mentions Howard’s versatility as a writer, citing his humorous westerns as an example. He cites Conan as Howard’s greatest creation. He again states the plan to publish a Conan saga saying this book is about number 6 in the series.\n\nConan\n\nThe singularly named Conan (1968) comes next. It is the first volume chronologically. The cover features a fantastic painting by Frank Frazetta. Another dark brown toned cover but this time with a large red center. Conan is attacking an ape-like creature in a dimly lit dungeon. His muscles strain as he plans to slay the red-cloaked beast with a large knife. This scene was duplicated in the “Conan the Destroyer” movie. The back cover states “Epic Fantasy at its best.” Fantasy author, Fritz Leiber is lengthily quoted. The book contains a letter from REH to P. S. Miller (co-author of the fan written “Informal History of Conan the Cimmerian”), part of REH’s Hyborian Age essay, and the following stories by REH: “The Tower of the Elephant,” “The God in the Bowl,” and “Rogues in the House.” It also contains a mixture of Howard, de Camp, and Lin Carter collaborations: “The Thing in the Crypt,” “The Hall of the Dead,” “The Hand of Nergal,” and “The City of Skulls” (incorrectly listed as “Chains of Shamballah” in the first edition).\n\nThe introduction gives the first lengthy biographical sketch of REH. De Camp talks about bullying REH received as a child and views that as partial incentive for Howard to become an “exercise fanatic.” He describes REH as 6 foot of mostly muscle. He talks about REH’s success as a writer during the depression. He calls REH maladjusted to the point of psychosis. He mentions REH’s fascination with suicide and how when his mother “to whom he was excessively devoted” was near death, he chose to shoot himself.\n\nDe Camp goes on to praise Howard’s writing and mentions Solomon Kane, Kull, Bran Mak Morn and others. He then quotes letters from Howard explaining the creation of Conan. All this was undoubtedly fascinating to the Lancer readers who were just learning about the man, Robert E. Howard. De Camp talks about his role in editing the stories and preparing them for publication. He talks a bit about the heroic fantasy genre and places REH as an integral part of fantasy’s literary history. De Camp gives the addresses of Amra, The Howard Collector, and mentions Arkham House and Donald M. Grant as places to read more of Howard’s other fiction.\n\nConan the Avenger\n\nConan the Avenger (1968) was the first volume to not contain any REH Conan content. Howard is represented only by the concluding section of his Hyborian Age essay. The book features a bluish toned painting by Frank Frazetta. Conan is realistically flesh colored and has an expression of fear. This is radically different than previous versions of the Cimmerian, but perhaps fitting for a book with mostly non-Howard content. Conan is lunging toward a bearded sorcerer while a scantily clad beauty lies prone on an altar. The painting almost appears to be underwater. Medallions are flying off of Conan’s necklace looking almost like bubbles. There is an octopus and alligator lying at the foot of the altar suggesting an aquatic setting. The back cover features a blurb by Damon Knight that apparently refers to this novel by de Camp and Bjorn Nyberg.\n\nThe introduction starts with an overview of heroic fantasy. De Camp goes on to praise Howard for his “rare knack of giving the impression of a highly colorful scene without actually using many adjectives to describe it.” De Camp goes on to explain how this novel (originally called The Return of Conan) and the Hyborian Age essay came to be.\n\nConan the Freebooter\n\nThe first non-Frazetta cover appears on Conan the Freebooter (1968). It features a greenish cover with a realistically drawn Conan hacking off the arm of a large routinely drawn gorilla. The background suggests an element of weirdness, but the primary focus is on the gore. The cover art is by John Duillo. The back cover features a blurb by Dr. John D. Clark. It focuses on the vicarious thrill a reader may get from reading adventure fantasy. The book contains 3 Howard stories: “Black Colossus,” “Shadows in the Moonlight,” and “A Witch Shall Be Born” and two posthumous de Camp/Howard collaborations: “Hawks Over Shem,” and “The Road of Eagles.” The introduction tells of de Camp’s edits, rewrites, and completions. This book is the seventh to appear but the third in chronological order. The introduction features a lengthy letter by Dr. Clark and ends with the standard addresses for fans to subscribe to Amra and The Howard Collector.\n\nConan the Wanderer\n\nConan the Wanderer (1968) features another Duillo painting. It is a mostly orange painting with some effective black tones. A realistically drawn Conan is hurling a foe onto oncoming arrows while a fire rages in the background. An Easter Island type statue suggests a small element of weirdness. The back cover blurb says “Conan the Barbarian is the hero of heroes.” The book features two stories by REH: “Shadows in Zamboula” and “The Devil in Iron,” one by REH and de Camp: “The Flame Knife,” and one by de Camp and Carter: “Black Tears.” The introduction gives a short history of REH’s life briefly mentioning it ended in suicide. De Camp tells the origin of “The Flame Knife.” It is a rewritten REH story that featured a character named Francis X. Gordon AKA El Borak. De Camp gives the normal Conan history explaining this book is the fourth chronologically.\n\nConan of the Isles\n\nConan of the Isles (1968) features a nicely drawn older Conan wielding a sword against a somewhat comically drawn dragon. It’s body a dull red transitioning into a bright green head with large fangs and spitting red tongue. Skeletons are piled in the corner bottom left of the illustration. Again the painting is by Duillo. The back cover blurbs praise this “new novel of the world’s greatest hero.” This book has a dedication to authors, John Jakes, Fritz Leiber, Michael Moorcock and Jack Vance. The introduction starts with an explanation of the genre. De Camp gives a good historical overview of fantasy’s roots. He gives a strong defense of the genre that unfortunately takes silly jabs at mainstream fiction. “A novel called The President’s Boyfriend ought to be a lead-pipe cinch,” cracks de Camp. De Camp adds Sax Rohmer to his previous list of authors who influenced REH. The rest is mostly restatements of earlier comments. De Camp gives a lengthy history of Conan setting the stage for this, Conan’s chronologically last recorded adventure as written by de Camp and Carter.\n\nConan of Cimmeria\n\nConan of Cimmeria (1969) features a beautiful blue and white painting by Frank Frazetta. It suggests fierce cold and fierce combat. Two large red-bearded warriors attack Conan. An icy mountain looms in the background. There is no real weird element in the painting other than the warriors being slightly taller than average. The book has three Howard stories: “The Frost Giant’s Daughter,” “Queen of the Black Coast,” and “The Vale of Lost Women,” 1 posthumous collaboration: “The Bloodstained God,” and four stories by de Camp and Carter: “The Curse of the Monolith,” “The Lair of the Ice Worm,” “The Castle of Terror,” and “The Snout in the Dark.” The introduction is more restatement of previous introductions with little new information. De Camp ends the introduction by plugging the work of Jane Gaskell, John Jakes, Fritz Leiber, Michael Moorcock, Andre Norton, Fletcher Pratt, and Jack Vance.\n\nConan the Buccaneer\n\nThe last Lancer volume a full-length novel by de Camp and Carter called Conan the Buccaneer (1971) features a dark gray and black cover by Frank Frazetta. Conan is drawn with a small chest and massive arms. He is strangling a warrior lying atop a heap of dying men. It repeats some of the images in the painting for Conan the Warrior but instead provides a close-up view. There is an effective orange-yellow light shining out of a stormy sky. The lighting of the painting suggests weirdness as much as Frazetta’s previously painted shadowy ghouls and serpents. A very nice cover to end the series with. The back cover repeats the “Epic Fantasy’s mightiest hero” line. The introduction this time is by Lin Carter. It talks about the world of sword & sorcery. Carter credits Howard as the modern inventor of Sword & Sorcery. Carter compares Conan’s popularity to Sherlock Holmes, Tarzan, and James Bond. Carter tells how he came to be a Howard fan and he shows a real enthusiasm for the genre and his role in it. Carter ends the introduction with a mention of the popular comic books and hints of Hollywood offers.\n\nConan of Aquilonia\n\nThe last volume in the de Camp edited Conan saga was published by Ace Books in 1977, Conan of Aquilonia. The cover is by Boris Vallejo and features Conan and his son attacking a beast-man astride a dragon-like creature. The back cover has the line, “fantasy’s most powerful hero.” The introduction is by de Camp and it repeats the same information as in previous introductions. The book consists of four stories all by de Camp and Carter. This wasn’t to be the last Conan book though. After the popularity of the movie more Conan product was produced for Bantam Books and then later for TOR Books.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe Lancer series sold millions and established Howard and Conan as a force in fantasy publishing. Lots of nonsense has been stated about de Camp causing harm to Robert E. Howard’s literary reputation. It is plainly obvious than Howard’s recognition as a master fantasist was bolstered by the popularity of this series and the Conan character.\n\nDe Camp unnecessarily edited some of the Howard stories collected in the Conan series to be sure. Some of the editing was useful, “The God in the Bowl” for instance, and some of the editing was done for racial sensitivity, but most of it was done for copyright reasons and was not really necessary. Still, it is a great leap in bad judgment to suggest that it is de Camp’s minor editing of the Weird Tales published Conan stories that is keeping the literati from recognizing Howard as a writer on a par with his Weird Tales’ peers Tennessee Williams or H. P. Lovecraft.\n\nDe Camp and Carter admitted their tales paled in comparison to Howard’s Conan and fans of the Lancer series were quick to notice this also. The fans divided into two camps: Conan fans and Howard fans (of course there is intermingling between the two.) Non-Howard Conan books are still being published today proving the popularity of the Conan character. Conan fans are pleased about this whereas Howard fans are inexplicably hostile to the idea. It has been illogically suggested that the popularity of the Conan character keeps other Howard characters out of print. That the lack of popularity of other Howard characters is what keeps other Howard characters out of print seems to be too heinous a concept for some Howard fans to accept. Despite a history of book, comic book, and magazine publishing that proves otherwise, some Howard fans have trouble accepting the fact that non-Howard Conan is more popular than REH characters like Breckinridge Elkins or El Borak.\n\nThe canard from some Howard fans that de Camp hurt REH’s literary reputation appears to be primarily an emotional reaction to de Camp’s less than flattering description of Howard in the REH biography, Dark Valley Destiny. The biography is full of praise for Howard’s writing ability and any literary critics that read the book would understand that. It hardly seems likely that “The New York Review of Books” lacks in-depth articles on Robert E. Howard because de Camp considered Howard to be too attached to his mother. But the fevered imaginations of some Howard fanatics accept that view as gospel.\n\nSome Howard fans are uncomfortable with de Camp’s emphasis on Howard’s suicide. They blame de Camp for starting the view that Howard was emotionally disturbed. Some Howard fans have argued that Howard’s suicide was a “reasoned choice” but shooting yourself in the head seems like a bad idea to a majority of people. De Camp can hardly be blamed for creating that majority opinion.\n\nThe Lancer series was a blessing to heroic fantasy fans and is remembered by most with great fondness and love. The joy of seeing these purple-edged volumes appear on newsstands throughout the country was a living breathing phenomena. Millions of fans looked forward to the next volume in the series and breathlessly read the meaty prose of Howard and also enjoyed the candy bar thrills of de Camp and Carter. Perhaps it is time for a revitalization of the Lancer series now that unedited REH Conan is readily available. Facsimile editions of the Lancer series would be an impossible item for those millions of readers with fond memories of the series to resist."
