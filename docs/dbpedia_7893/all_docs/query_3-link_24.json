        "text": "Author[]\n\nLin Carter was a fantasy, horror, and science fiction writer.\n\nHe wrote a number of stories about Conan and Kull, creations of Robert E. Howard, including original works and stories written from unfinished fragments from Howard, some in collaboration with L. Sprague de Camp.[2] He also participated to the Cthulhu Mythos, pastiching H.P. Lovecraft.\n\nHe created his own characters, such Jandar of Callistro (published at Dell Books), or the sword-and-sorcery hero Thongor the Valkarthan,[2] similar to Conan in many ways.\n\nMarvel Comics[]\n\nSpider-Man TV series[]\n\nLin Carter was a major script writer for the Spider-Man 1967 animated series, and is credited among the writers of 51 episodes.\n\nAdaptations of his sword-and-sorcery stories[]\n\nThongor[]\n\nIn the end of the 1960s, Roy Thomas looked into licensing other characters, and thought of Conan (though he wasn't a fan at the time). He was given by Martin Goodman $150 an issue to offer as a license to acquire a character. Thomas though the Robert E. Howard estate would not accept such as small sum.[3] He instead went to Lin Carter for his character Thongor the Barbarian, who didn't accepted the $150 licensing fee.\n\nRoy Thomas finally went to the Robert E. Howard estate, who accepted an offer.[4] Marvel did only obtain the rights to the REH material, but not for the subsequent pastiches written by L. Sprague de Camp, Lin Carter and others.[5]\n\nThongor was eventually adapted in Creatures on the Loose 22 (March, 1973) to 29 (May, 1974):\n\n\"Thongor!
