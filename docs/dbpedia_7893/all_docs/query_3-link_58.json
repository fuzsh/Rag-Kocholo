        "text": "by Gary Romeo\n\nI recently had a great weekend. [This was in October 2016.] Around the first of October I was checking out Bill Thom’s Coming Attractions webpage. There was a blurb about a Tarzan exhibit at the Brazos Natural History Museum in Bryan, Texas. Bryan is about 3 hours from Dallas.\n\nI started thinking about going. I was reluctant at first. A 3 hour drive to see Tarzan toys, comics, books, (stuff I already have a lot of myself!) interspersed with once living stuffed animals. I dunno.\n\nAbout three weeks later as the exhibit was closing I decided to go. It turned out to be a fun trip. The drive was actually a bit scary at one point. Around Corsicana I started hitting a LOT of fog. The road was visible enough but everything around the road was obscured by dense fog. I considered turning back as I figured a storm or something was imminent. I pulled off the exit and asked a gas station attendant about the fog.\n\nTurns out it was normal for that time of the year. The area is very low sea level and fog settles in heavily in the morning and is gone by noon. A big relief. I continued on.\n\nI found the museum without a hitch and really enjoyed the exhibit. It was mostly what I thought in would be. That is Tarzan memorabilia with once living stuffed animals but the lights, huge displays, and overall presentation was very very good.\n\nI spent over an hour looking and reading everything. There were some great J. Allen St. John paintings, a Roy Krenkel painting, and some of ERB’s personal items.\n\nAfter visiting the museum I ate in downtown Bryan. A charming old section with lots of good restaurants and shops. After Bryan I journeyed on to College Station, the home of Teaxas A&M. It is a nice attractive college town.\n\nThe big tourist attraction is the George Herbert Walker Bush Presidential Library. I paid a cheap admission for that and relived some of the Bush years.\n\nAll in all it was a good time.\n\nBut that got me to thinking about a Conan Exhibit. It would be similar of course. More stuffed apes and snakes than lions and leopards. There is tons of memorabilia for both. But whereas this exhibit had mostly comments about Africa, what would a Conan exhibit be centered on?\n\nI figure more on ancient history and weapons would work best. Maybe some information about cataclysms. That civilization can rise and fall through internal issues and forces of nature. Maybe tie the rise and fall of the Hyborian Age with the effects of global warming? I dunno. But something to daydream about.\n\nby Gary Romeo\n\nI don’t buy too many new authors these days. I’m still reading Edgar Rice Burroughs, Robert E. Howard, H. P. Lovecraft, Clark Ashton Smith, Sprague de Camp, and Lin Carter stuff I haven’t read. Some other authors to finish up include: Chester Himes, George Cuomo, Eric Ambler, Phil Farmer, and Jack London.\n\nI have finished the complete works of Jim Thompson, Ian Fleming, Donald Goines, Robert Cormier, Richard Yates, and Raymond Carver.\n\nAll the above writers are dead, of course.\n\nI was keeping up with some living writers for a brief while. I liked Bret Easton Ellis for a while but got tired of him. Same with Chuck Pahlaniuk. Sara Gran and Daniel Woodrell are still authors I buy. I had a fondness for S. E. Hinton’s first four novels but have bought some of her more recent stuff and was disappointed.\n\nJared Diamond and Noam Chomsky are some living non-fiction writers who I will buy from time to time.\n\nBut all in all nothing much from live writers. Mostly filling up my shelves with stuff I should have read when I younger by the dead: Hemingway, Tennessee Williams, Vonnegut, Phillip K. Dick, and various one-time classics.\n\nI really should be reading Black Gate, various S&S web sites, perusing the fantasy shelves at B&N and looking for new writers who’ll thrill me. But it ain’t gonna happen.\n\nI still buy some pastiches of Fleming, Howard, and Burroughs when I see them. Putting me even further behind in any attempt to read completely original new works. My most recent read was an ERB knock-off called Tarzan Presley.\n\nI consider this a new original work. This was no mere pastiche. But a real literary attempt to try to cross-examine two very popular American creations. The author is a New Zealander named Nigel Cox.\n\nAs far as I know, the singer Ray Stevens was the first to combine Tarzan and Elvis Presley in his hit single “Gitarzan.” This book is more ambitious than that but just as odd and amusing.\n\nCox boldly states Tarzan was born in New Zealand and adopted by gorillas. Tarzan’s New Zealand jungle fictionally has not only the gorillas but also giant cave weta. Wetas are a plump hand-sized grasshopper type insect unique to New Zealand. In ERB lost civilization mode the weta here are cow-sized and will attack and eat the gorillas.\n\nMostly everything stays true to ERB in quite a few ways. Tarzan is nursed and raised by Kala. The gorilla leader bullies him. He finds the cabin, but instead of learning to read, learns to sing. The cabin here has a windmill power source and a working radio.\n\nJane is a bug researcher and discovers Tarzan. Tarzan and Jane have heaps of sex and she observes the Giant Cave Weta and eventually brings Tarzan back to civilization.\n\nTarzan is a big handsome muscleman and can sing like the dickens. He eventually goes to Memphis and cuts records at Sun Studios under the direction of Sam Phillips.\n\nThe novel really does a change here and becomes the Elvis story. The Presley’s adopts Tarzan. Their son Elvis died in a truck accident and Mrs. Presley teaches Tarzan some of the rudiments of Christianity.\n\nTarzan Presley being the natural savage never really takes to religion but is every much the respectful southern gentlemen that Elvis was. He just likes sex, drugs, food, and rock n’ roll too much.\n\nThe author had carried me along about halfway through the novel. He has a short quick natural style. You don’t really question the unbelievable narrative and accept the combined stories of the fictional Tarzan and the real life Elvis without too much quibble.\n\nIn the first half, the author pretty much told the story, with only a little commentary, and then with a lot of poignancy. By the second half, the author overreaches and there is too much poignancy. It is still artful but it seems to be trying too hard. Clearly the author is a fan of both Tarzan and Elvis and sees some connection with both characters in their quest to be human.\n\nWe see the downfall of Tarzan Presley, as we all know it: too many bacon cheeseburgers, too many pills, too many bad movies, and too little good music.\n\nIt makes sense, a person raised by Gorillas could succumb to all that excess without realizing the harm. Surrounded by enablers who are neither all good nor all bad, it all just happened.\n\nThe last third of the book covers Tarzan Presley after his supposed death and the book remains poignant but loses whatever interesting narrative it had from combining the lives of Tarzan and Elvis and becomes its own thing that is not completely satisfying.\n\nNevertheless, I’m glad I read it. It was both old and new. I like that."
