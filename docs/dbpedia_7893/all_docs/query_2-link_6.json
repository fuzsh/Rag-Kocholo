        "text": "by Gary Romeo\n\nThough a lot has changed since the heyday of L. Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter, there was a time when new Conan stories by this writing team were anxiously awaited by many a fan. Ted White, editor of Fantastic, said the August 1972 issue in which the de Camp and Carter story, “The Witch of the Mists” first appeared “sold … the best of any issue of Fantastic … published in 1972. … Significantly better.” Some grumbled, of course, about the continuing adventures. In that very same issue of Fantastic, an article by Alexei and Cory Panshin stated, “… the sword and sorcery complex itself is a living fossil with no apparent ability to evolve.” However the July 1973 issue of Fantastic saw White writing, “it is my conviction that, under Conan’s herald, fantasy is enjoying a great popular resurrection….” Further, the March 1974 issue had a letter, written by myself, vigorously defending sword and sorcery. Though clearly the work of a 15-year-old, this letter represented some of the magazine’s readership and de Camp and Carter fans. Clearly many different opinions have been held about sword and sorcery and the de Camp and Carter Conan stories.\n\nDe Camp’s views on sword and sorcery have rankled some. He mainly spoke for an escapist view of the genre. In the introduction to his collection, The Spell of Seven, he asks, “How would you like to escape to a world of wizards and warlocks, warriors and wenches – a world where gleaming cities raise their shining spires against the stars, sorcerers cast sinister spells from subterranean lairs, baleful spirits stalk through crumbling ruins, primeval monsters crash through jungle thickets, and the fate of kingdoms is balanced on the bloody blades of broadswords brandished by heroes of preternatural might and valor?”\n\nWhile some may dislike the emphasis de Camp places on the more fantastical elements of the genre, his love for it is plain to see. Further, he dedicates this book, “To my fellow enthusiasts for the art of heroic fantasy: the members of the Hyborian legion.” He explains the reference in his introduction to the reprinted Robert E. Howard story, “Shadows in Zamboula.” De Camp writes, “[the Hyborian legion is a] club of admirers of heroic fantasy [whose] magazine is called Amra, a name used by Conan when he was a pirate among the black corsairs of Kush.”\n\nDe Camp was aware of criticisms toward the genre and answers those critics in his well thought out defense of Sword and Sorcery in the introduction to his anthology Warlocks and Warriors. He writes, “[Sword and Sorcery fiction is] no further removed from reality than the countless yarns about superspys who race about in supercars from one posh gambling joint to another, finding a superbabe awaiting them in bed at each stop, or detective stories wherein, after the stupid cops have failed to catch the culprit, a brilliant amateur – a reporter, a priest, or a little old lady – steps in and solves the murder.”\n\nDe Camp went on defending Sword & Sorcery (herein called Heroic Fantasy) in his introduction to Conan of the Isles. “Certain trends [were] against heroic fantasy. These included the vogue for stories presenting a strongly subjective, sentimental, or psychological view; stories about an anti-hero – a dull, pathetic little twerp, who could do nothing right; stories concealing their lack of an interesting narrative by a pyrotechnic display of stylistic eccentricities; and stories with an intense and absorbing interest in contemporary politics or in sex, especially in its more bizarre manifestations. … There are still, however, many readers who read … to be entertained.” Clearly de Camp sees Sword & Sorcery to be valid fiction, immune to faddishness and transitory trends.\n\nIn turn, Carter gave his definition of Sword & Sorcery in his introduction to Flashing Swords! #1. He wrote, “We call a story Sword & Sorcery when it is an action tale, derived from the traditions of the pulp magazine adventure story, set in a land, age or world of the author’s invention – a milieu in which magic actually works and the gods are real – a story, moreover, which pits a stalwart warrior in direct conflict with the forces of supernatural evil.”\n\nCarter, in another forum, replied to the Panshin’s criticism of Sword & Sorcery. In Imaginary Worlds he wrote, “Must a school of writing evolve? I wonder why. Evolution implies change into something else. [We] write the stuff because we love reading it.” Yet elsewhere, he does say the genre has evolved. He wrote in Flashing Swords #1 that the locations and settings of the genre now include the future and completely imaginary worlds, as well as “the mythic epoch which preceded history” as in Robert E. Howard’s Conan stories.\n\nCarter, in giving a personal defense of the genre in Flashing Swords #5, avoids the comparison to mainstream or realistic fiction altogether. Carter writes, “I’ve long since given up trying to figure out why I prefer such fantasies to other kinds of fiction. It’s not that I disapprove of social realism or science fiction or the formal historical or the mystery yarn or anything else. Perhaps it is quite simply that in the imaginary world fantasy, the author has the widest possible room to swing his imagination: he can invent worlds where magic works and the hard sciences just plain don’t; worlds ruled by gods or wizards or elves; flat worlds, hollow worlds, worlds that are real only in dream. In other words, Sword & Sorcery gives the broadest conceivable scope to the playfully inventive imagination. Maybe that’s why I like it best.”\n\nCarter came to love Sword & Sorcery during his childhood in St. Petersburg, Florida. Carter tells the story in the introduction to his book, Beyond the Gates of Dream. “It was great being a kid in the days when I was a kid. … Saturday was really the Big Day of the week. You started out early in the morning; you went downtown to Red Ackerman’s big newsstand and checked to make sure whether the latest issues of Startling Stories … was in yet … then you went down Central Avenue to your spiritual home, Haslam’s second-hand book and magazine store. There was … no telling what might have turned up in the stacks of dog-eared, dilapidated old pulps since last week … maybe another coveted issue of Doc Savage … or another antediluvian copy of wonderful Weird Tales with yet another one of those enthralling Conan stories by Robert E. Howard….”\n\nIn contrast, De Camp came to be a fan of Sword & Sorcery when “his friend and colleague Fletcher Pratt gave him a copy of the newly published Conan the Conqueror.” From such moments are history made. De Camp loved it and became the undisputed champion of Robert E. Howard and Conan for the next several decades. De Camp rewrote some of Howard’s unpublished fiction for magazine publication and inclusion into the Gnome Press series. But it was in 1966, that de Camp, as Robert Price says in Lin Carter: A Look Behind His Imaginary Worlds, “put a whole generation of fantasy readers in his debt by suggesting Lancer Books reprint Robert E. Howard’s Conan tales in cheap paperback editions.”\n\nIt was almost inevitable that these two Robert E. Howard fans would meet. Carter published his first novel, The Wizard of Lemuria, in 1965. It was the first of his Edgar Rice Burroughs and Robert E. Howard inspired Thongor tales. The Thongor books were popular enough and given a bigger boost after the popularity of the Lancer Conan series. Glenn Lord, the literary agent for Howard’s heirs, had come across some unpublished stories and fragments from Howard’s King Kull series among others. Carter was given the task of editing these stories for the Lancer Book King Kull and the Dell Book Bran Mak Morn. Carter successfully edited these books and de Camp brought Carter aboard to finish up one Howard fragment and collaborate with him on new Conan stories. L. Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter had become a writing team.\n\nWhen imagining de Camp and Carter working together most probably imagined the two men hashing out the plot of a story, discussing where it fit in the Conan saga, and mulling over how effectively they emulated Howard’s style. It seemed like a sacred duty to young Conan fans and sales figures show that they were happy to see the fruits of de Camp and Carter’s labor. The men seemed to enjoy a real camaraderie; praising each other in other forms and editing anthologies that featured each other’s solo work. De Camp wrote the introduction for Carter’s collection of poetry, Dreams From R’lyeh. De Camp relates a discussion about poetry he had with Carter that tells you the men were the best of friends and discussed more than just their Conan work. De Camp calls Carter a natural storyteller. This is the same compliment that de Camp also gives Robert E. Howard. De Camp once called storytelling the “sine qua non” of a writer. Carter returned de Camp’s favor by writing an introduction to de Camp’s Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers. Carter took the opportunity to write a lengthy essay praising de Camp entitled, “Quixote with a Pen.”\n\nAlso some de Camp and Carter fans knew of Isaac Asimov’s Black Widower stories. These were mystery stories originally published in Ellery Queen’s Mystery Magazine. De Camp and Carter (among others) were fictionalized and became the basic for two characters in the stories. De Camp was Geoffrey Avalon and Carter was Mario Gonzalo. One reader summarized the characters this way: “Avalon is dignified, pedantic – good for the odd spot of in-character exposition. At the other extreme, Gonzalo, the youngest, is usually eager for each puzzle to appear.”\n\nTo a young Conan fan, de Camp and Carter were enviable professionals, writing one of the most popular and exciting fantasy series ever and hobnobbing with the greats of fantasy and science fiction. It is not a stretch to say that de Camp and Carter’s successful continuation of the Conan series was responsible for many Conan fans wanting to become writers themselves. De Camp published a book for budding writers. His Science Fiction Handbook (originally published in 1953 and later revised in 1975) and Carter’s Imaginary Worlds were both full of advice for aspiring young fictioneers. Among writers acknowledging gratitude to de Camp and Carter are such popular authors as Harry Turtledove and Terry Pratchett.\n\nCarter’s first Conan collaboration was not with de Camp though. It was a posthumous collaboration with Robert E. Howard called “The Hand of Nergal.” Carter explains how he approached the story in Beyond the Gates of Dream: “Well, I sat down and sweated. I read and dipped into and sampled all the other Conan stories to hand, making notes on style and word-choice, average length of sentences, the flavor of names, the usual length of a descriptive passage, how Howard had handled dialogue and action. I combed that story-fragment minutely, searching out every fleck of information, every nuance, every intonation, everything that might point or suggest a direction for the rest of the yarn to take. Quite frankly, I worked harder on that one story than I have on whole novels I have since written.”\n\nRobert Price devotes a chapter of his previously mentioned book to the de Camp and Carter collaborations. Asked by Price how the collaborations worked, de Camp answered, “In collaboration with [Fletcher] Pratt and later with Carter, the collaborators found that it worked best if the younger writer (at least, younger in writing experience) did the rough draft and the older one the final. The younger writer is apt to have greater facility and be more fertile with ideas, while the older one is more alert for errors, infelicities, mistakes of grammar, inconsistencies, etc. With Pratt, he was the older; with Carter, he was the younger. In each case we got together and roughed out the plot first; then the junior author went home, wrote a synopsis or treatment (which he might or might not show the senior author) and then did the rough draft. The senior collaborator wrote the final draft and submitted it to the junior for minor changes before sending it out. We found out that when we reversed the procedure it didn’t work well.”\n\nPrice also informs the reader that several of the de Camp and Carter Conan stories were based on Carter’s Thongor plots. By examining other details of the various plots, Price can separate de Camp’s and Carter’s contributions. His method is sound and those interested in that aspect of the collaborations should seek this book out. Looking, then, at each story, as a tale written by an equal team, and assessing the impact of each, is important and perhaps a new idea.\n\nThe first de Camp and Carter story was “The Thing in the Crypt.” This was a rewritten Thongor plot called “The Creature in the Crypt.” This story, undoubtedly because it is an “origin” story of sorts, has been adapted quite often to other media. The John Milius movie Conan the Barbarian borrows from it and so did the first episode of the Conan television series. Most curiously, it was adapted as a Golden Adventure Book (basically a storybook format in the vein of The Pokey Little Puppy) and re-titled The Thing in the Cave.\n\nTheir second collaboration was “The City of Skulls.” This was an important story as it introduced a heroic black character, Juma the Kushite. The film versions of Conan, as well as the comics, followed de Camp and Carter’s lead and gave Conan companions of color. Charles Saunders, a writer of Sword & Sorcery himself, said in an essay titled “Die, Black Dog!” that: “Throughout [Saunders was excluding stories where blacks were villains, he discussed those earlier] Howard’s Conan stories, blacks play only a fringe role as the exotic loinclothed Cecil B. DeMille-type slaves that crop up everywhere from Argos to Zamora. To their credit, however, de Camp and Carter’s additions to the canon have introduced Juma the Kushite, who is a black equal to Conan. Howard himself never deviated from his stereotypes – in his Conan stories at least.”\n\nNext was “Black Tears” a sequel to Howard’s “A Witch Shall Be Born.” This tale, likes it predecessor, also features an evil woman, this time a vampiric goddess. The story has some nice writing that emulates Howard. The following excerpt is a good example: “[Conan’s] flashing blade clove the dusty air and caught the mocking face of the goddess – slashing the third eye in twain. She did not move. With her two normal eyes of surpassing beauty, she stared silently at the grim warrior, her face blank and white. A change swept over her. From the ruins of the Gorgon’s third eye, dark fluid ran down the face of inhuman perfection. Like black tears, the slow dew fell from the shattered organ.” According to Lin Carter fan, Phil Burger, the plot of this story was “borrowed” from Pierre Benoit’s Queen of Atlantis aka Atlandide.\n\n“The Curse of the Monolith” was another reworking of a Thongor story. Here de Camp and Carter write a tale that effectively features a weird menace that harkens back to the grade B movie classic, “Beware the Blob.” The idea of a mindless unstoppable smothering creature really does scare the living daylights out of a lot of people.\n\n“The Lair of the Ice Worm” was another rewritten Thongor tale. This is probably one of the most effective de Camp and Carter stories. Charles Hoffman apparently confused it for a genuine REH story in his essay, “Conan the Existential” published in Ariel #1. Hoffman in presenting the idea of Robert E. Howard as an existentialist mentions this de Camp and Carter creation. “The outstanding quality of Conan is his sheer force. His great size and physical power are the instruments of an irresistible will. When he vows vengeance on an ice-worm or on a Stygian lieutenant, he exacts it….” Recently the ice worm was referenced again on the cover of a collection of essays called The Fantastic Worlds of Robert E. Howard. This is ironically amusing, as the collection is practically a manifesto for de Camp and Carter bashers. Thus, even they, let in a Freudian slip that shows de Camp and Carter created a memorable menace.\n\n“The Castle of Terror” is a hackneyed title and the weakest of the stories discussed thus far. Still it features some nice Lovecraftian imagery and ties the serpent men of the Kull stories with Conan. The story is suitably entertaining featuring a pride of lions and some Stygian slavers. Conan has a short but fulfilling sword fight with a Stygian sentry (perhaps a lieutenant!).\n\nConan of the Isles was de Camp and Carter’s first full-length novel. Carter, in Beyond the Gates of Dreams, called it “our pride and joy,” but apparently confessed to Price that he “did not think his and de Camp’s first Conan novel … was one of their better efforts.” Price, however, admits to “thinking it quite good.” Hoffman in “Conan the Existential” says, “Howard’s intrinsic existentialism [is] what separates his stories from the Conan stories written by the team of L. Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter…. The Carter/de Camp stories are for the most part rather good, but the authors occasionally fall into the use of fate, gods, prophesy, and other devices usually avoided by Howard. … When de Camp and Carter employ Epimetreus [a character from Howard’s “The Phoenix on the Sword] in the second chapter of their novel, Conan of the Isles, the spirit tells Conan that “from the beginning the gods of eternity marked you for great deeds and undying fame …” Conan goes along, asking what they expect from him. Especially in light of Conan’s existentialism, this seems out of character.”\n\nPrice says of their second novel Conan the Buccaneer that “it “feels” Howardian at many points. … [The] Prologue [has] much good, thick Howard ambience….” Price goes on to point out that the novel has familiar stock Carter characters though: a tomboy princess and the humorous Sigurd Redbeard. Charles Saunders was probably happy to see Juma the Kushite appear again. Not that Saunders was wholly praiseful of de Camp and Carter. He states in “Die, Black Dog!” that “Carter and de Camp, on the other hand, continue to practice good old-fashioned bigotry in their non-Conan endeavors. Though they have done a good job at ameliorating some of Howard’s more blatant racism, their own efforts at sword-and-sorcery are throwbacks.”\n\nNext up were the four stories comprising Conan of Aquilonia. Asked by Price if these stories were purely his, Carter replied, “They were [genuine collaborations], except that in the early collaborations, if Sprague decided to change something, I was too intimidated by his prestige to speak up, even though he might be watering one of my ideas down. So in these, which were about the last thing we did, I spoke up a little more strongly, and he would go along with me.” Price, nevertheless, detects some de Campian elements in the four stories, “The Witch of the Mists,” “The Black Sphinx of Nebthu,” “Red Moon of Zimbabwei,” and “Shadows in the Skull.” De Camp talked about certain fan reaction to these stories, “The tales tell of Conan, in his fifties, and his twelve-year-old son. I suspect that the vehemence with which some Howard fans have denounced these stories is due as much to their adolescent revulsion at seeing their footloose, carefree, irresponsible, invincible young adventurer-hero become a settled, middle-aged family man, as it is to any faults of the stories themselves. The idea of a graying Conan watching his diet, playing catch with his kids, and figuring his taxes horrifies them.”\n\nConan the Swordsman was published by Bantam Books. The popularity of the character now had him sought by a better publishing house. Price says the stories in this collection were a marked improvement over the stories in Conan of Aquilonia. Price suggests de Camp began reworking Carter’s draft more thoroughly. “Legions of the Dead” is an eerie exciting tale of Conan’s youth. “Shadows in the Dark” is a sequel to Howard’s “Black Colossus.” “The Gem in the Tower” is a sequel to “Drums of Tombalku.” “The Ivory Goddess” is a sequel to Howard’s “Jewels of Gwahlur.” “Moon of Blood” takes place after Howard’s “Beyond the Black River.” All the stories are interesting and have some Howardian elements. “Legions of the Dead” is probably the highlight of the book.\n\nConan the Liberator marks the last time Carter contributed to a Conan pastiche, although one more was co-credited to him. This book is a direct sequel to “The Treasure of Tranicos.” Price recounts a letter from de Camp, “Carter started on his part but pooped out early in 1972. (We began on January 27.) After some months of fiddling around and trying to get him to work, Catherine and I gave up, and Catherine did the rest of the collaboration.” This novel tells the tale of Conan becoming king of Aquilonia. It is decidedly more realistic than the previous collaborations, with an emphasis on battle strategy and political alliances. The evil sorcerer, the power behind the throne, is an effective menace and the novel has some genuine suspense. A little “high-fantasy” is unfortunately allowed to creep in with an exchange between Conan and some forest satyrs that ruins the novel for some.\n\nThe final novel bylined by de Camp and Carter was Conan the Barbarian, the novelization of the John Milius movie. Price says, “Amazingly, Lin said he loved this travesty.” Price quotes Carter, “The fact that they took one scene out of a story Sprague and I wrote pleased me, too.” Sprague talked about the novelization and said, “Carter had no part in this one, although his name appears on it and he was paid his share.” This book was the lowest point in the entire Conan series. Sprague who had always been protective of his worked out Conan chronology allows for a new version of Conan’s youth and first adventure. Price says it best, “Of course neither movie nor the book has the slightest trace of Robert E. Howard’s influence. By contrast, the earlier Carter-de Camp Conan pastiches were often quite effectively Howardian, for all that this statement will ring like blasphemy in the ears of militant Howard purists.”\n\nDe Camp wrote about the de Camp and Carter collaborations in his memoir Time and Chance. “How successful this plan [the continuations by himself and Carter] turned out is not for me to say. I do not think any of the pastiches, including my own, are up to Howard at his best. But Howard’s stories vary in quality, just as do their modern imitations. As to which tales merit the term “great,” come back in a century or two to see which if any are still read.” De Camp goes on to talk about his choice of Lin Carter as a collaborator: “With 20-20 hindsight, I suspect that my greatest single mistake in handling Conan was taking on Carter as a collaborator without first sounding out Leigh Brackett to see if she would like to join the project. She had, I think, a better sense of the barbaric viewpoint than either Carter or me. She had previously turned down a similar proposal from Greenburg [the Gnome Press publisher], but perhaps I could have persuaded her. Since the idea occurred to me only after both she and Carter were dead, we shall never know.”\n\nDe Camp’s comments seem a bit self-serving and they are dismissive of de Camp and Carter fans thoughts on the matter. But Time and Chance is more than just an article, it is de Camp’s autobiographical swansong and he owed it to his fans to be completely candid and tell his real thoughts. Carter’s later unreliability and self-destructive urges undoubtedly affected de Camp’s later views. De Camp, like a friend would, avoids discussing Carter’s demise. De Camp, later in the narrative provides an example of Carter’s generosity and this shows that de Camp was sensitive to his friend’s downward spiral. “In 1976, we [Sprague and his wife, Catherine] went on from Atlanta to Texas to visit Gerry [his son] in Austin, then to Kansas City for the WorldCon, where I was delighted to receive the Grand Master Award, the Gandalf, for contributions to fantasy. This award originated with Lin Carter, who I believe paid for the handsome statuettes as long as he could.”\n\nAs with anything that becomes popular, and especially after Conan the Barbarian, there was the inevitable backlash to de Camp and Carter’s continuation of the Conan series. The reasons for this are many and not all of them are related to the quality of their pastiches. This topic has been discussed elsewhere and does not need to be reconsidered here. Suffice to say, that today, years after both men have passed away and gone to whatever Valhalla awaits the storytellers and skalds of heroic fantasy their contributions are still being praised and debated. Tor Books has reprinted a good part of De Camp and Carter’s Conan work in the last several years. Clearly, they are still entertaining some. And most likely all their work will reappear again when public interest in Conan reaches another zenith.\n\nDe Camp and Carter were both quick to glorify the sheer entertainment value of Conan and sword and sorcery. Some suggest this view hurt Robert E. Howard’s literary reputation. This view conveniently ignores de Camp’s biographical research of Howard, the popularizing of Conan, and Carter’s important editorial work in the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series. Marc Cerasini and Charles Hoffman said in The Starmont Reader’s Guide # 35, “If other writers in the future are able to see further than de Camp and his collaborators, it is because these authors have laid the groundwork for all future Howard criticism.”"
