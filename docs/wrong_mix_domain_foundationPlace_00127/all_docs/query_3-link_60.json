        "text": "Appears I have been scammed out of nearly $20\n\nI have been a customer for years as I prefer HO games and they seem to have a good variety of them. Each time I have had a concern they have addressed it and given me extra coins to make up for the mistake. That is until recently. June 10/24 I made a purchase with the same CC I always use. This is used to pay for the membership and for game purchases. I purchased two games, my CC was billed but the games were not available for me to download. They show a faded \"Processing\" in my Game Library. I contacted support and they are telling me my payment didn't go through. I have provided them with a screenshot of several past and this present amounts sent from my banking app, I have also called the bank and gotten a reference number for the transaction (which I'm told any financial institution can track) but over 3 weeks later I am now getting no response from them. Last week I emailed for an update and they have \"forwarded my request for a review\" Two days ago I sent another request for a response and I have heard nothing.\n\nDate of experience : July 04, 2024\n\nLost a customer\n\nI have been writing back and forth for almost over 1 week now trying to get help with their game manager which they wont even admit has issues, I get gifted points to help solve the issue which doesn't even cover half of what i spent on a game that doesn't worth.. The people doesn't even seem to care, or listen at all when you write to them.. Its sad to see how far bigfish has fallen from grace... I will definitely be doubtful about buying games there in the future\n\nAlso they tend to finish the corresponding before even helping their customers... Its honestly just disappointing and I've sued this for YEARS\n\nYou probably lost another customer now...\n\nDate of experience : May 26, 2024\n\nFriendly, helpful and great games!\n\nI have used and bought Big Fish Games for almost 15years. I recently contacted customer services with a query about my game club membership and they replied within a couple of hours, very friendly and went above and beyond to sort it out. I'm sad to see all of the negative reviews on here when my experience of contacting them over the years has always been super positive, they have always done everything they can to help. I have hundreds of games from them and everything always works perfectly, never an issue!\n\nDate of experience : March 08, 2024\n\nWrong currency and wrong amount charged\n\nI chose to pay in euros. My cart showed a total of 18.90 euros. Then I continue to pay, and suddenly I'm charged in USD and suddenly an additional tax amount was added. Beats me why they don't show the tax amount before charging me. And why charging in USD when I set the currency to EUR? I've sent an email to their customer support but received an automated reply that they are having high volumes of email and it will take longer than the standard 72 hours. After 14 days, I can submit a dispute for this purchase at the credit card company. This company is on the verge of bankruptcy and they cannot be trusted.\n\nDate of experience : April 17, 2024\n\nBigFish will not let you change billing information\n\nIt is a shame that I cannot give Big Fish games zero stars. I changed my bank account and went into my page to change my billing method. I also bought a game, and my payment was accepted. However, Big Fish keeps sending my bill to my old checking account and I have changed this information 4 times already The customer service is non-existent and, after 10 years being a paid member, I am cancelling my account.\n\nDate of experience : December 10, 2023\n\nRemoves your account for their own mistakes\n\nThey deleted my account because of their own mistake, they released a code and didn’t specify it was a one time use, then banned the users that used it. My account that’s several years ago is gone. Never buy from them, they can remove your account and games with their own fault because their “terms and conditions” allow them to do so.\n\nDate of experience : December 12, 2023\n\nI would have given 0 stars if it were…\n\nI would have given 0 stars if it were an option. I've been a Big Fish member for nearly 15 years and am seriously concidering ending my membership. They used to have at least one good, pure HOGA (hidden object game adventure) a week,often more than one. Now we're lucky to see one month, and most of them are misleading. Many times it seems that there is a new game released by one of my favorite producers like Elephant games or MadHead, only to find out they've used an old title and put it on a silly solitaire game or something. It's just getting hard to justify the membership price with the poor offerings lately.\n\nDate of experience : July 04, 2023\n\nGame purchased but no game available\n\nThey offer a game for a 60 minute trial, which I played, before purchasing it. They took my money, but then the game could not be activated. I wrote to customer service, and got a very quick reply : the game has been removed from the site and will not be available to upgrade. So... why is it still on the site to download and purchase ? Isn't that theft ? I was given Big Fish points to get another game but I don't want to download anything from that site anymore.\n\nDate of experience : March 23, 2024\n\nExcellent service - great response - points credited\n\nExcellent service, game wouldn't proceed, but I got a personal response within 24 hours, with suggestions .\n\nWhen that didn't work I replied to confirm no luck and they credited me my game points so I could purchase another game at no cost to me. Sad to see so many bad reviews, as this is the second time I have had a problem and they have been brilliant.\n\nDate of experience : November 16, 2023\n\nchanges to big fish\n\nsince the change in august the monthly sobscription has gone up over £2 GBP per month i know its not a lot but the change info advice prior to the change said there would be NO increase also they have now added tax which was 0.00 VAT on all my previous purchases i also have been a BF member since 2006 but not for much longer i detest being screwed over\n\nDate of experience : September 21, 2022"
