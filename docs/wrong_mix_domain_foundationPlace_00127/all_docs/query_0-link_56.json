        "text": "Buenos Aires, Argentina has often been called, “The Paris of South America,” and with its thriving cultural scene, world-class cafes, and stunning, European-inspired architecture, it’s easy to see why.\n\nBut the country’s capital city is a gem in its own right. From its culinary delights to its historical gems to its incredible artistic offerings, there are no shortage of options for the adventurous traveler to try.\n\nSo saddle up a horse, settle into your theater seat, and check out some fun and unusual things to do in Buenos Aires.\n\n1 – Take a street art tour\n\nWhile there are plenty of incredible galleries and museums in Buenos Aires, it’s well worth taking a look at the thriving street art scene.\n\nAll over the city, you can see beautiful and creative murals crafted by local artists, and with a street art tour, you can explore both the popular pieces and the hidden treasures scattered throughout the neighborhoods.\n\nWith a variety of styles and themes, these works offer creative perspectives on the ideas and concerns that influence modern life in the city.\n\nThe Palermo neighborhood is particularly famed for its density of street art and graffiti, and there are many excellent tours available for those seeking a closer glimpse.\n\nFollow a local guide through the winding streets as you take in the many different works, and learn about the political and creative origins behind them.\n\nFor an even deeper dive into the city’s culture, consider pairing your trip through Palermo’s art world with a wine or dining experience.\n\nstreet art tours in Buenos Aires\n\n2 – Cruise (or paddle) through the Tigre Delta\n\nLocated just outside of town, the Tigre Delta flows out from the Rio De La Plata, and offers a scenic getaway from the big-city bustle.\n\nTaking a sightseeing tour down the waterway to the town of Tigre is an ideal option if you’d like to see more than just the city itself. Hop on board your vessel and set sail, watching the impressive urban landscapes transition into quieter, rural scenes.\n\nAfter about an hour and a half, you’ll dock in Tigre, where you can explore the streets on foot and get a feel for the charming local culture. Visit the museums, enjoy some fresh empanadas, or just take in the sights and sounds in this popular city.\n\nBoat tours through the delta may include stops in other nearby towns, such as San Isidro (known for its beautiful Catholic church). If you prefer a more self-guided endeavor, try a biking and kayaking tour.\n\nStart in the scenic, tree-filled area of Los Bosques de Palermo, then make your way north to the delta, where you’ll swap your wheels for a paddle.\n\nWhether you’re a seasoned kayaker or a nautical novice, this is a wonderful way to explore the beautiful island areas at your own pace.\n\nboat tours in Buenos Aires\n\n3 – Explore the ins and outs of Polo\n\nOne of the country’s most iconic pastimes, polo – a sport in which players ride on horseback while trying to knock a ball into the other team’s goal – has been beloved by Argentines for decades.\n\nAlthough it is traditionally known as an elite and exclusive sport, there are plenty of ways for you to learn more about polo during your visit. For a truly immersive experience, try booking a lesson for yourself while you’re in town.\n\nSeveral tour companies offer half-day or all-day lessons, where you can learn the basics of the game, proper riding form, and more.\n\nAfter going over the essential components, you’ll get to saddle up and try a few rounds of the sport. No previous experience is necessary for this authentic and unique adventure!\n\nOnce you’ve tried your hand at the game, kick back and enjoy some of the many amenities of a traditional Argentine ranch, including barbecues, wine tastings, and splendid views of the surrounding countryside.\n\nYou can even take the opportunity to watch professional players go head to head on the pitch. Back in the city, don’t miss a chance to catch a game at Campo Argentino de Polo, the premier stadium in the area.\n\nOften called “The Cathedral of Polo,” this venue is the place to go to catch some world-class matches. It’s one of the best things to do in Buenos Aires for those seeking an authentic Argentine experience.\n\nIts biggest event is undoubtedly the yearly Argentine Polo Tournament, held in November and December.\n\nBut there are also plenty of matches between local clubs throughout the year, which are much cheaper and easier to get tickets for, so be sure to check the schedule while you’re visiting! Whether you’re playing or watching, a day at the polo pitch is sure to be a delight.\n\npolo experiences in Buenos Aires\n\n4 – Look for street dancers in La Boca\n\nAnother one of Buenos Aires’ most unique and iconic neighborhoods, La Boca got its start as a haven for immigrants, port workers, and other marginalized individuals.\n\nOver time, it also developed a reputation as an artistic hub, as well as a great spot to catch some soccer matches at the nearby Estadio Alberto Jose Armando (La Bombonera).\n\nThe diverse influences of the neighborhood are best explored via a walking tour.\n\nSee some of the intricate murals and historic enclaves in this unique community, as well as the massive port, where so much of the city’s trade and commerce took place.\n\nAlong the way, you’ll learn more about the challenges that La Boca continues to face, and how its unique demographics represent the city’s multilayered history and class struggles.\n\nAnd, of course, you’ll learn a lot about tango, the national dance that has a particularly strong following here.\n\nLa Boca tours\n\n5 – Visit Casa Rosada\n\nPresidential residences tend to be impressive places, but few have such a distinctive hue as Casa Rosada. With its vivid pink facade and impressive size, it’s a hard building to miss\n\nIn addition to housing Argentina’s president, the building is an architectural and historical triumph, with beautifully detailed interiors to complement its striking exterior.\n\nIt also features a museum celebrating the country’s history from the 19th century to the modern era.\n\nFor those looking to explore the building more in-depth, there are many guided tours available, offering the chance to see some of the building’s many historic chambers up close.\n\nYou may even catch a glimpse of the president’s office!\n\n6 – Sample some local foods\n\nBuenos Aires is famous for its culinary offerings, and a food tour is a great way to enjoy some of the best that the city has to offer.\n\nOpen up your palate with a broad range of wines, taste some finely crafted tapas, or make your way through the city’s delicious assortment of street food (including the famous choripan sausage sandwich).\n\nOr chow down on one of the many excellent steaks for which the region is known.\n\nFor sweeter palates, be sure to sample some fresh dulce de leche, a tasty dessert that is similar to caramel in taste and consistency.\n\nAlong with these more iconic offerings, many of the tours will take you to smaller restaurants and local markets, allowing you to explore some of the nuances of local cuisine.\n\nAnd if you’re really feeling ambitious, be sure to book a tour that includes a traditional Argentine dinner. With multiple hearty courses (and a selection of wines), you’ll never come away hungry.\n\nfood tours in Buenos Aires\n\n7 – Experience the Gaucho life at San Antonio de Areco\n\nFor another authentic experience outside of the city hustle and bustle, take a trip to San Antonio de Areco.\n\nThis village, which is 70 miles away from Buenos Aires, is a wonderful showcase for the traditional gaucho culture of the Argentinean plains.\n\nTake a day tour to one of the local ranches and learn about some of the daily activities that take place there, and see how ranching customs have developed over the centuries.\n\nYou’ll also have time to explore the surrounding town and learn about its colorful past.\n\nCheck out a goldsmithing demonstration, and try your hand at making a few pieces yourself. Or take in a folk show, where you can witness the dances, customs, and celebrations of the region.\n\nBack at the ranch, you can try your hand at horseback riding or a carriage tour, before settling down to a delicious, traditional barbeque.\n\nThis is the ideal trip for those seeking to better understand the gaucho customs and lifestyle.\n\nGaucho day tours from Buenos Aires\n\n8 – See the Floralis Genérica on a bike tour\n\nBuenos Aires is famous for its walkability, but it’s also an excellent place for biking. With plenty of bike tours all over the city, there are no shortage of options to explore some famous parts of town from a new vantage point.\n\nThe two biggest choices you’ll face will be the length of the tour (half or full day), and which section of town you want to cover.\n\nTake a half-day excursion through Palermo and Recoleta, where you’ll see beautiful art, interesting architecture, and impressive monuments to some of the city’s most famous figures, such as the incredible Floralis Genérica sculpture.\n\nOr cruise through the center of the city, passing iconic communities like artsy La Boca or the green spaces of Puerto Madero.\n\nIf you want the fullest possible experience of the city, try one of the full-day tours, where you can hit all the highlights in town and see the connecting communities along the way.\n\nThis history lesson on wheels is a great way to get some exercise while learning about the inner workings of a world-class metropolis.\n\nYou’ll also get lots of ideas for other things to do in Buenos Aires while you pedal through town!
