        "text": "Samuel Montalvo\n\nSamuel Montalvo is a Post Doctoral Research Fellow under the Wu Tsai Human Performance Alliance. As part of the Wheeler research lab, I am working to understand the mechanical, molecular, and physiological mechanisms of human performance by utilizing data generated by the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium. Additionally, I am working on a secondary project aiming to generate exercise prescriptions and testing guidelines for individuals with neuromuscular disorders. Outside of the lab, I conduct research in martial arts in collaboration with several national sports institutes aiming to understand and maximize human performance. I practice and coach martial arts as my main hobby. I also love to play guitar and like to spend time with my family.\n\nRodrigo Mendez\n\nRodrigo is a Postdoctoral Scholar and Medical Geneticist from Argentina. Rodrigo completed a residency program in Medical Genetics at Centro Nacional de Genetica Medica – ANLIS (Buenos Aires, Argentina) and a Master’s program in Medical Molecular Biology at Buenos Aires University. Rodrigo continued his scientific career at a German Genomic Start-up, working as a human geneticist and providing his experience in rare disorders, genomic data (WGS/WES/gene panels) analysis, variant interpretation, and its integration with a deep focus on genotype-phenotype correlation. Rodrigo’s areas of expertise are rare disorders, NGS technology, Whole Genome Sequencing analysis, and ACMG interpretation guidelines, and his research aims are:\n\n- Collection and analysis of clinical data through deep-learning phenotyping approaches.\n\n- Multi-omic data integration to elucidate complex and rare genetic disorders.\n\n- International collaborations to break down barriers to research participation amongst those who have been under-represented.\n\nAt Stanford University, under the supervision of Dr. Matthew Wheeler, he is conducting his postdoctoral research studies to achieve his scientific goals.\n\nRaquel Alvarez\n\nRaquel Alvarez is a Life Science Research Professional at the Wheeler lab. She received her BS in Biological sciences with an emphasis in Microbiology and Immunology from UC Merced. After receiving her bachelor’s degree, she’s worked for over 6 years as a cell culture associate at various start-up companies within the biotech industry as well as academia at UCSF in their Pulmonary division.\n\nHer prior work consists of 1) mapping regulatory DNA in the IL33 gene locus by using CRISPR Cas9 as well as CRIPSRa screens to identify novel regulatory regions in the IL33 gene in epithelial airway cells. 2) Defining the genetic contribution to the airway response to asthma cytokine IL13 by exposing over 150 human airway epithelial cell cultures to IL13 and performed DNA/RNA sequencing to define the genetic contribution to the IL13 response.\n\nAs a research professional in the Wheeler lab, she will investigate the mechanism of disease in novel rare disease associated genetic variants using mouse and human cell models. All while collaborating with multiple groups focused on uncovering mechanisms in rare and undiagnosed diseases.\n\nOutside of the lab, Raquel enjoys exploring new places, going to sporting events, and always wanting to try new foods.\n\nLaurens van de Wiel\n\nLaurens van de Wiel, Ph.D., is a postdoctoral scholar in the Wheeler lab with a keen focus on bioinformatics and multi-omics in the realm of rare, undiagnosed diseases. With a solid foundation in computer science, evidenced by a B.A.Sc., an MSc, and over three years of industry experience, Laurens excels in developing robust large-scale scientific software solutions. His academic journey, which spans nearly a decade, boasts first-author publications in prestigious scientific journals such as Nature. As the author of the widely-used MetaDome web server, Laurens has empowered over 15,000 researchers and clinicians around the globe in their genetic diagnostic pursuits. Presently, he is diving deep into the intricacies of rare diseases at Stanford through the \"Multi-omic Identification of Disruptive Alternative Splicing in Rare Disorders\" project, for which he was awarded the esteemed Rubicon Fellowship from The Dutch Research Council (NWO/ZonMW).\n\nOutside of the lab, Laurens loves exploring new places, be that in a random city, underwater while scuba diving, hiking through a national park or skiing down a hill slope. He also enjoys the comfort of home where he likes to ferment things and play video games.\n\nJennifer Marino\n\nJennifer Marino is the Certified Clinical Research Coordinator II at the Stanford Center for Inherited Cardiovascular Disease. She has her BS in Biomedical Science from the University of Colorado, where she began working on biomedical research in the lab as well as clinic spaces. She has experience working on everything from small Phase 1, first in human trials to massive global studies with expansive data sets. Working with the Wheeler Lab at Stanford, Jenn helps patients with cardiovascular diseases that are often overlooked or under-represented, connect with the many novel medications and devices that may not be available through traditional means.\n\nWhen not in the clinic, Jenn can be found tinkering with her fish tanks, reading in a hammock, hiking the foothills or playing in the surf; always accompanied by her two St. Bernard mixes Petra and Novinha.\n\nSarah Abramowitz\n\nSarah Abramowitz is a Life Science research professional in the Wheeler Lab. She explores mechanisms of rare genetic diseases, using in vitro, in vivo, and in silico approaches to investigate the roles of rare variants in causing or modifying disease.\n\nSarah joined the Wheeler lab in 2019 as an undergraduate intern, returned full time after graduating with her BA from Dartmouth College, and has remained involved since starting medical school at the Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell. Outside of school and science, Sarah enjoys cooking, sports, and outdoor adventuring with family and friends."
