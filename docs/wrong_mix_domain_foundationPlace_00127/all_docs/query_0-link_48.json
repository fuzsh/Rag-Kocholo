The answer is simple - it's the incredible people, the vibrant culture and the opportunities for growth that have unfolded on this journey. Back in 2015, I joined as one of WeWork's first cohort of UK employees, starting as a Community Associate in London. Little did I know that this would mark the beginning of something truly special! Reminiscing about the years gone by, several highlights stand out: üìç Moving back to the north to launch and lead our first regional market in the UK&I, Manchester. üè¢ Launching and managing our largest WeWork building globally, 10 York Road London. üåá Overseeing our West London portfolio of WeWork buildings and the talented teams who worked so hard to seamlessly run them. üí≠ Leading the product vision, strategy and global expansion of Growth Campus, a multi million social impact investment in space and business resources specifically aimed to support the entrepreneurial ecosystem bounce back post-COVID. üìà Being a founding team member of our Ancillary Revenue department. Today, in my role as Head of Ancillary Revenue across International, I‚Äôm so grateful. Thank you WeWork, for the doors you've opened and the experiences you've facilitated over the past 8 years. Thanks to both past and present colleagues who have provided mentorship, partnership, and lots of fun along the way. It's for sure been a rollercoaster journey so far - excited to see what we achieve together in 2024!"
