        "text": "Australian gambling giant Aristocrat has begun a strategic review of its portfolio of mobile casual and mid-core games. It is possible that following the review, it may sell Plarium and Big Fish Games (but not Big Fish Social Casino) or their assets.\n\nRAID: Shadow Legends\n\nAristocrat announced this in its financial report. It clarified that no decisions have been made yet and all options for the subsidiaries' future are being considered. The main goal is to \"increase shareholder value and ensure the continued success of these businesses.\"\n\nIn the same report, Aristocrat noted that Plarium and Big Fish Games are its important assets, which helped it cope with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. They also made a significant contribution to the group's business growth.\n\nRevenue for the Pixel United division, which includes Plarium and Big Fish Games along with Product Madness, fell by 1% to $872.2 million from October 2023 to March 2024. Revenue from social casino games grew by 2.4% to $496.3 million, revenue from RPGs, strategies, and action games fell by 4.2% to $283.7 million, and revenue from casual games declined by 7% to $97.2 million.
