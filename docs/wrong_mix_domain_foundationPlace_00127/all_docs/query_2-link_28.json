Games I know I purchased say that No Purchases is Found for this Account. Some I have only played once. Apple needs to get this resolved. Yes, it is a Big Fish Game, but I purchased these games from Apple.\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: ss3110\n\nUser level: Level 1\n\n8 points\n\n*UPDATE*\n\nI have found if I go to purchase again and press to buy it comes up with a message saying I’ve already bought, do I want to get it for free. This seems to have worked in restoring the games\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: Drew_7\n\nUser level: Community Specialist\n\nHi MCFFan66,\n\nFrom what you've shared the best steps to take for your issue can be found in the following article: If there's an issue when you redownload apps, movies, or other content from Apple - Apple Support\n\nSpecifically, review the following.\n\nIf you don't see the item that you want to redownload\n\n* Make sure that the item is in your purchase history for your Apple ID. If you don't see the item in your purchase history, you might have purchased the item with a different Apple ID.\n\n* If you don't see an app that you want to redownload, that app might not be compatible with your device. For example, an app that you bought for your Mac might not also work on your iPhone or Apple Watch.\n\n* If you don't see items in your purchase history on other Apple IDs, the purchases might be hidden. Learn how to redownload hidden apps or unhide music, movies, TV shows, books and audiobooks.\n\n* Do you want to redownload an app or other content that a family member purchased? If you have Family Sharing, you can download shared purchases.\n\nBest regards.\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: judysings\n\nUser level: Community Specialist\n\nGood afternoon MCFFan66,\n\nDid you try to delete the app and then redownload it? Make sure you have a backup of your iPhone before performing these troubleshooting steps.\n\nDelete apps on your iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch - Apple Support\n\nRedownload apps and games from Apple - Apple Support\n\nIf you still are not able to open the app after redownloading, contact Apple for help with this: Get Support\n\nTake care.\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: glensboxers1\n\nUser level: Level 1\n\n12 points\n\nHave u fixed your issue yet? I’m having the same problem. I’ve been thru big fish support and Apple but nothing…. I’m getting frustrated. It has to be an issue on their end if many of us are having the same issue\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: glensboxers1\n\nUser level: Level 1\n\n12 points\n\nI’ve been thru Apple and big fish. I give up. Everything they have said to do I’ve done and if there are a few of us having this issue then the problem is on their end. I won’t be buying any more big fish games which is sad because I really did enjoy them. If anyone figures it out please post\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: ss3110\n\nUser level: Level 1\n\n8 points\n\nGlad I’m not the only one. Apple and big fish are no help. Big fish have me things to try which didn’t work so sent me to apple. Apple said they can’t do anything. I can see the invoices showing I’ve paid for apps and it’s telling me no purchase found. Funny because a couple of them work but most don’t. So annoying because I really enjoy the games and have been playing them for years!\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: glensboxers1\n\nUser level: Level 1\n\n12 points\n\nBig fish games on iPad and iPhone will no longer work IF… they are under IOS10 and under 32 bit games. So all your older games will now say something like no account found, or just won’t download. If u want to buy a new game make sure it is for IOS 10 and above and make sure it is not a 32 but game. I hope this helps. This is an apple decision not big fish. I suggest playing in the computer or laptop which has nothing to do with Apple.\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: Kayla2094\n\nUser level: Level 1\n\n8 points\n\ni’m having this exact same issue, were you able to figure out how to fix it?\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: glensboxers1\n\nUser level: Level 1\n\n12 points\n\nBig fish has now I turned me they have changed their format, therefore games may not work\n\nif that is true I want my money back for the last three games I purchased\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: glensboxers1\n\nUser level: Level 1\n\n12 points\n\nUnfortunately that didn’t work for me. Ugh this is very frustrating. I’m glad u found a way to get the games to work.\n\nLink"
