        "text": "Hi,\n\nI've been trying to run Hollywood Tycoon (an old game from Big Fish games) in a window using the tool, but every time the game window appears and disappears. I tried taking logs with the setting recommended in the help files, but the log file always comes out empty.\n\nIs there anything I could try that may help run the game?\n\nOk, let me say (again) that Big Fish games are, despite the apparent simplicity, a hellish task to tame because they have very strong protection schemas. I downloaded the time-limited 1 hour demo and got some success, but in 1 hour I won't be able to help any more.\n\nBecause of the protections the game needs early hook and hot patching, definitely the strongest set of hooking tools. I would also add to DxWnd.exe administrator capabilities, just in case.\n\nThe attached export should work as it is, since the game installer doesn't let you pick a different game folder, in any case you can check and update the path if necessary.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nThank you very much for the help. I have the official copy from Big Fish so unfortunately can't help with where else to get it from. However with your solution I still only make it the intial loading screen before it crashes. Still appreciate the effort a lot.\n\nIn the attempt to recover the game I got a CD image from Internet Archive, it is \"Hollywood Tycoon\" by Astragon, 2005, but the game doesn't resemble at all the one with the screenshots here. It works, but I believe it is another game."
