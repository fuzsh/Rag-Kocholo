        "text": "Seattle based casual games company, Big Fish Games is going real money.\n\nBig Fish says it will offer players in the U.K. the ability to make real bets through their upcoming version of its Big Fish Casino iPhone app.\n\nSadly for USA players this won’t be available, until the gambling laws change there.\n\nBut American regulators are moving toward a legal and regulated online gambling system, and setting up a virtual casino now gives Big Fish a new stream of cash while it waits for the U.S. landscape to sort itself out.\n\nBig Fish’s casino app is the result of a purchase the 10-year-old company made last year, buying Oakland, CA’s Self Aware Games.\n\nThat small company made a virtual gambling game called Card Ace: Casino, which was a Top 10 iPhone app.\n\nBig Fish’s entry into the world of online gambling is a huge signal about where the industry is going.\n\nBy jumping into the fray now, Big Fish is also getting ahead of other big names in the casual games business. High on that list is San Francisco-based Zynga, that announced last month that it was getting into online gambling in the first half of 2013.\n\nSource: gaming-awards.com"
