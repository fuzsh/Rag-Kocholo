        "text": "This game used to be fun and they say the odds are just like a real casino but I've been to a real casino many times and you win at least once or twice in the past two years out of the 15. I've been a member list last two years have been the WORST! CUSTOMER SERVICE IS NONEXISTENT HALF THE TIME AND YOU WOULD THINK ANYWHERE FROM 500 TO 900 A MONTH IN A GAME. YOU COULD KEEP A LITTLE BIT OF CHIPS ABSOLUTELY NOT! FUNNY HOW IN OTHER CASINO GAMES YOU ACTUALLY CAN ACQUIRE BILLIONS AND THEN OF COURSE LOSE IT BECAUSE YOU'RE CARELESS, BUT YOU AT LEAST WIN THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY ZERO WINS IF YOU HAPPEN TO WIN BY CHANCE IT'S TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AWAY AND YOU CAN TELL IF YOU RECORD HOW THEY DO THAT! I think they should treat their VIP members that spend quite a bit of money. They keep their app going in there, plus few workers in support working with more respect! And you a little better with what they give you,in there, they say VIP program is malarkey, and if something goes wrong in the app, you damn near, have to bring God down to prove it to them! Don't don't waste your money, nor your time there are other apps out there that truly truly charge very little for their coin packages and you actually win and have a fun time, there yet you don't have to buy you actually win that's all! Have a good day!\n\nTip for consumers:\n\nThey are criminals!\n\nService\n\nValue\n\nReturns\n\nI am not sure who bought BFG but they are the worst and least helpful group I have ever run into - all errors are my fault and they tell me to read their 'fix; for everything as if I have no experience with BFG! All I want now is credit for the last dozen games I purchased and cannot download. I have turned to iWin for m entertainment - eventually all the BFG games come to iWin.\n\nProducts used:\n\nvideo games I downloaded and played on my PC - some many times, but hundreds I have yet to download and play.... 25 years and I am finished.\n\nService\n\nValue\n\nReturns\n\nQuality\n\nGood selection of games, GREAT prices, no malware or ads. I have purchased over 10 games from them and have never had a problem. I have changed computers a couple times and was able to easily re-download my games. I like that they let you \"try before you buy\"\n\nYou have to join their club to get discounted price on games, but you can cancel it as soon as you download your game... then just start it again when you want another game. Or stay with the membership and get special deals from them.\n\nNow on day 15 waiting for tech support. After (now) literally weeks receiving links to their FAQ's I have received the following support ticket reply. 15 days and they tell me there will be a delay to their next response. 15 days and they have kept my money. 15 days and they have done nothing to resolve their issue. I have even told them exactly what steps THEY need to take to get my games working...\n\nThank you for writing back to us.\n\nThank you for your patience and for providing relevant information. I'm escalating this to our senior team so we can figure out the next steps. Please know we are currently receiving a high volume of tickets, and unfortunately, there will be a delay with our next response. We are working through these tickets as quickly as possible and will get back to you as soon as we're able.\n\nThank you for your understanding. Have a great weekend.\n\nRegards,\n\nRyan N.\n\nTip for consumers:\n\nEverything is ok until you have a problem - then it takes many many days before you receive a 'form letter' response. You then need to go back into their (lack of) tech support system to try to resolve the problem.\n\nI am at 15 days and counting and I have just been informed that their response may be delayed - I am not surprised that they recently lost a class action lawsuit, and I am waiting to sign up to the next one.\n\nIf you want to buy a game to play today, buy them elsewhere.\n\nProducts used:\n\nGames\n\nQuality\n\nI have had 3 billing issues with bigfish. They send my invoice for 6.99 in AUD dollars. They take out the American amount. I have tried endlessly to have this rectified. All falling on deaf ears. My membership runs out in 2 weeks I think I will cancel my membership. I have sent them 7 emails in 3 weeks with no response. I have updated my account to say AUD but it keeps taking out the wrong amount every time. I have asked for someone to contact me and give me the instructions in case there is something I am missing. I am sick of the silence. Please don't use them They owe me over $20 and won't accept responsibility. SO, I shall go elsewhere. One consultant said they didn't care. I wish there was a game site in Australia that has the same games.\n\nThey are now offering certain packages at a certain price like you get 289 million coins 52,000 gold bars for $49.99 but when you go to purchase it you're not getting that you're getting just a regular package for that price And you can tell that they are controlling the slots at no payout rate I have tons of videos of them cheating the system they're collecting extra cash and Apple. For instance, does nothing about it. They will not return your money even if you can show them that they're wrong they don't care they won't give you your money back, they have side games that you play but you have to bet billions to even move an inch on the sidebar game to win something like a chest a low level chest they make it impossible so that you have to purchase and then they control what you win which is nothing?\n\nTip for consumers:\n\nNow are the worst app on or available and Apple will not refund any money they take more money than they should. When you haven’t even purchased it’s their word against yours and they don’t care. Them and Bigfish casino are in cahoots.\n\nProducts used:\n\nNa\n\nService\n\nValue\n\nQuality\n\nTheir games are very tight but not at first as they \"lure\" u in. Once ur in that's when they get you. Games will be very hard to win. Buying chip packages can get pricey. And DONT contact customer support. I just did & had a slight typo where I complained bout them say all the time \"they punch luck or chance\" that was the typo it should have been \"push luck & chance\" when there is none. They removed me from playing. I said no curse words I simply had a typo & they were quick to remove. I highly do not recommend this company whatsoever. They \"bully\" you,,, and you have no freedom of speech as I cannot make a complaint. Please go to a different place to play. This company has also been sued & lost twice. Do research. They make $150+ Million a year. That's stealing money from customers. Read what I wrote. You can see I had a typo they took wrong way. Does it look like I said something wrong?\n\nTip for consumers:\n\nPLEASE AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL COSTS\n\nProducts used:\n\nChips bought for game play. $100’s of dollars spent by many people. This is supposed to be non gaming site???\n\nService\n\nValue\n\nReturns\n\nQuality\n\nThe Big Fish and Jackpot Magic casino games are starting to be a real bore. You NEVER win, no matter what your bet level is, and you continually run out of coins. Im in a club in both sites and none of them can move up or do anything, one of which has 40 members, seems like we should be able to do something? Used to be fun, now it's frustrating and getting to the point where i am thinking of taking both games off and moving on to something else that is at least entertaining... I don't spend real cash to play, cause i don't get real cash in payout, so figure it out game masters, you will soon lose your following if you continue to wrap it so tight no one can play except at the bottom bets with no real wins.\n\nUsed to be a lot of fun but now if you want to play,\n\nYou buy thinking maybe this time I will win and be able to play awhile, but that never happens. Chips are gone in one day. People complain about the odds and never winning but the company never listens. Customer service is a joke. More and more people are disgusted and take it out on other players or they dont have any chips to spend and sit without spinning. Worse is the players with millions who dont spin and collect and big fish casino does nothing. This is the newest CON Artist of the electronic age and they should be ashamed!\n\nI was a member of Big Fish, I once loved this site, but many changes have happened over the past few years. You had great Hidden Object games and a wonderful online community with real reviews of games. Nowadays there are fake 5 star reviews by the same people for every game. If you honestly review a game and give it a low rating they will remove your reviews. It's a money game at Big Fish games with no care to the people playing and paying for their games. They pump out mature themed games with a challenge level for elementary school children. The quality of the games have taken a nose dive along with customer service which is non existent.\n\nWhen i joined the big fish games club i was happy at the time for over a two year period until one day i noticed that money was going out of my account for games not ordered by me. So i tried to contact the help service which they claim to have but no joy there. I could not sign into my account anymore so i rang my bank and told them what was going on. They closed my account and got every penny back that i had paid to this corrupt company. Never buy games or give them your credit card numbers.\n\nI started playing Big Fish Casino for about 3 years & have purchased a lot of chips. It was fun in the beginning but in the past couple of weeks have endured people starting drama within the tables, also losing most of the time, & also the constant laughing regarding another player at the table. I do not find anything funny regarding any player whether they are black, white, red, or whatever, if the have a billion chips or just one, it doesn't matter. Why can we not just get along?"
