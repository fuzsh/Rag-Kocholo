        "text": "Besides the published Scars Above, we are working on\n\nTWO UNANNOUNCED GAMES\n\nBoth are based on famous and beloved IPs, which franchises' fans will eagerly anticipate. While we can't reveal too much just yet, we promise these titles will push the boundaries of regional game development and generate some serious hype!\n\n2011\n\nThe Heroes Spawn Point is created\n\nThe Mad Head Games studio is built on the solid foundations of ambition, talent, and friendship - all with one goal: catching that magic spark of wonder that allows an idea to become a game.\n\n2012\n\nStart of the HOPA invasion\n\nOur first HOPA, Rite of Passage: The Perfect Show, reaches an audience of a million. The studio enters the gaming map as a new rising star, kicking off the collaboration with Big Fish Games.\n\n2013\n\nTrailblazing and growing\n\nOur studio continued to pioneer the way for regional game developers while adding more muscles to the team in the process. We officially became an intercity studio as we opened the Belgrade office.\n\n2014\n\nWe conquered our territory\n\nWe believe this was the year when we laid the foundation of the Mad Head culture. Besides establishing numerous internal events that became a tradition, we gave the first edition of GameUp to the local game dev community.\n\n2015\n\nWorking hard, partying hard\n\nOur studio becomes a true powerhouse of the HOPA scene, winning many awards along the way. Our team continues to grow, both quantitatively and qualitatively - along with our ambitions.\n\n2016\n\nLeaving the comfort zone behind\n\nOur first indie HOPA series Adam Wolfe hits Steam. Parallelly, our first ARPG project named Kingewitch (later renamed Pagan) is born. In no time, Kingewitch is declared the most promising Unreal project in development at the Brighton Developer Conference - and we get our first hardcore fans.\n\n2017\n\nExpanding to new territories\n\nKingewitch wins the Best Desktop Game award at Moscow's Dev GAMM, and its name is changed to Pagan. Talks with Wargaming kick off, and Pagan is greenlit, speeding past all the other competitors in the Wargaming incubator.\n\n2018\n\nA Newcomer on the hardcore gaming map\n\nTeamed with other eminent studios from Serbia, we form the Serbian Gaming Association. Reboot Develop awards us with the Regional Street Hero Award for contributions to the regional gaming scene. A publishing deal with the Wargaming Alliance for the future ARPG - Pagan Online is officially signed.\n\n2019\n\nRockstars, babe!\n\nA massive year for the studio. Pagan Online is in Early Access on Steam! A few months later, the game gets its big global premiere at Gamescom (Cologne, Germany) and becomes The Best Selling RPG game on Steam in 2019! The team size reaches its peak in terms of headcount.\n\n2020\n\nTransform\n\nation and resilience\n\nThis year is the most challenging one for the whole team - especially once we turned our homes into home offices. However, after the rain comes the sun, and we get ourselves a big enough reason for celebration: we become a proud member of Saber Interactive, a subsidiary of Embracer Group!\n\n2021\n\nNew Decade, New Direction\n\nWe celebrate an entire decade of existence - entirely transformed. The casual games are now simply a part of our legacy, as we refocus on action games for PC and Consoles. Our next big game is confirmed - its name is Scars Above, a 3rd person action-adventure Sci-Fi shooter with Koch Media being its publisher. Our other action game project, based on a famous movie franchise, moves from prototyping into production at the same time.\n\n2022\n\nMad Head Games 2.0\n\nThe new mission types require a new suit, and the studio rebranded. We completely refreshed our visual identity: the casual outfit is retired, and we kicked off 2022 wrapped in a fresh and adventurous costume!\n\nHalfway through the year, we became an international studio as we opened an office in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina."
