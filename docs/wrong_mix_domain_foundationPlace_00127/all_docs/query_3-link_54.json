The rate of accrual will be determined by a player’s Game Club status.

At that time, Game Club Credits and Punch Card Coupons were automatically exchanged for 699 Big Fish Points each.\n\nWhen will I earn my 699 Big Fish Points?\n\nAs usual, your Game Club subscription will be automatically renewed on a monthly basis. At the time of each renewal, members will accrue 699 Big Fish Points.\n\nHow much am I saving with Big Fish Points?\n\nIf you’re an active Game Club subscriber, you’ll earn 15% back on each purchase. Otherwise, you’ll earn 1%. As an example, if you make an eligible purchase of $13.98 (before taxes and fees) and your account has an active Big Fish Game Club subscription, you would earn 209 Big Fish Points (worth 15% of the value of the purchase price or $2.09).\n\nAny taxes or fees included on a transaction will not earn you additional Big Fish Points. Purchases made with Points or from Restricted Offerings will also not earn you additional Points.\n\nWhich purchases are eligible for Big Fish Points?\n\nMost cash purchases made on bigfishgames.com or the Big Fish Game Manager are eligible for Big Fish Points.\n\nWhat kind of purchases are restricted?\n\nThere are some purchases that won’t be eligible for Big Fish Points. For example, Big Fish Casino players won’t be able to earn Big Fish Points on purchases made in Big Fish Casino. Similarly, these players won’t be able to redeem Big Fish Points for purchases in Big Fish Casino. Also, any games or in-app purchases that occur somewhere other than bigfishgames.com won’t be eligible for Big Fish Points.\n\nWhere can I find my Big Fish Points?\n\nOnce we’ve added the new Points system, you can access them from the Big Fish Games website. Make sure you’re signed in. From the account dropdown menu in the header, select “Big Fish Points” to access the Big Fish Points page. From here, you can review your Points history by transaction.\n\nHow can I use Big Fish Points?\n\nBig Fish Points can be applied during the checkout process. After adding a game to your cart, select “Checkout” and notice the “Add Big Fish Points or coupon code” section below Payment Method. From the Big Fish Points field, you can add or remove any number of Points you have available. Big Fish Points will automatically be added to this field and you will need to remove or adjust them if you prefer not to use them. After you’re happy with the number of Points, select “Apply”, and then “Review Order” to move to the final checkout page. For example, if you’ve added a game to your cart that costs $6.99 and applied 699 Big Fish Points for $6.99 off, your new subtotal would be $0.\n\nWhat if I’m using a currency other than USD?\n\nThe Big Fish Points system is based on USD. Points will be accrued based on and redeemed for each game’s price in USD regardless of your chosen currency.\n\nWhat else can I do with Big Fish Points?\n\nBig Fish Points can be used toward the purchase of games for that account's use. You may not transfer Points between accounts, purchase Points outright, gift Points, or hold onto Points for more than two years.\n\nDo Big Fish Points ever expire?\n\nBig Fish Points will expire after 2 years. You will be able to review those expiration dates from the Big Fish Points page. To make your Points easier to manage, each time you choose to redeem Big Fish Points, our system will automatically use those Points with the nearest expiration date."
