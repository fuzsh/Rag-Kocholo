        "text": "About[]\n\nBig Fish Games Studios (shortened to Big Fish Studios) is the internal development studio that published original titles every year under Big Fish Games. They are most famous for game series like Mystery Case Files, Drawn (purely puzzle-based), Azada (again purely puzzle-based; since taken over by ERS Games), Life Quest (strategy-based), and Fairway Solitaire (solitaire-based).\n\nBig Fish Games seems to have moved on from Big Fish Games Studios at least in terms of developing hidden object games as Big Fish Games has only primarily published other hidden object games since Mystery Case Files: Shadow Lake in 2012. Big Fish Games has developed other games that are not hidden object-based since (primarily free-to-play mobile games), just not under the title Big Fish Game Studios anymore.\n\nGames List[]\n\n(Please note that, as this is a Hidden Object game wiki, only the Hidden Object games will be listed.)\n\nMystery Case Files was given to Elephant Games, then Eipix Entertainment, and finally GrandMA Studios.\n\nHidden Expedition was given to Eipix Entertainment and then DominiGames.\n\nAlthough not promoted as such, Mystery in London: On the Trail of Jack the Ripper is a Travelogue 360 game with the same exact gameplay style.\n\nReleased Series & Continuity Name 20051114Nov 14, 2005 Mystery Case Files: 01 Huntsville 20060406Apr 06, 2006 Mystery Case Files: 02 Prime Suspects 20061215Dec 15, 2006 Mystery Case Files: 03 Ravenhearst 20071107Nov 07, 2007 Mystery Case Files: 04 Madame Fate 20081127Nov 27, 2008 Mystery Case Files: 05 Return to Ravenhearst 20091125Nov 25, 2009 Mystery Case Files: 06 Dire Grove 20101125Nov 25, 2010 Mystery Case Files: 07 13th Skull 20111123Nov 23, 2011 Mystery Case Files: 08 Escape from Ravenhearst 20121120Nov 20, 2012 Mystery Case Files: 09 Shadow Lake 20060722Jul 22, 2006 Hidden Expedition: 01 Titanic 20070601Jun 01, 2007 Hidden Expedition: 02 Everest 20080620Jun 20, 2008 Hidden Expedition: 03 Amazon 20091024Oct 24, 2009 Hidden Expedition: 04 Devil's Triangle 20110814Aug 14, 2011 Hidden Expedition: 05 The Uncharted Islands (with Floodlight Games) 20061130Nov 30, 2006 Travelogue 360: 01 Paris 20070620Jun 20, 2007 Travelogue 360: 02 Rome: The Curse of the Necklace 20071214Dec 14, 2007 Travelogue 360: 03 Mystery in London: On the Trail of Jack the Ripper\n\nGallery[]\n\n[]"
