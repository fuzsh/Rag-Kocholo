        "text": "50 is a whimsical and somewhat limited number for a to-do list in Buenos Aires because the truth is that this city - bustling and cosmopolitan, chaotic and charming - has so many things to do, to explore, to discover, taste, and experience. It may sound arrogant - indeed, this is one of the adjectives that Porteños often receive when we talk about our city - but we are not lying. Because Buenos Aires has it all: historical heritage, one of the most vibrant cultural lives in Latin America, Creole gastronomy and inherited or fused flavors, characters worth knowing, and many experiences to connect with the Argentinean spirit. The streets of Buenos Aires have that \"je ne sais quoi,\" you know? Here is our selection of the 50 best things to do in Buenos Aires, which you must experience at least once in your life.\n\n1. Admire the city from the lighthouse of the Palacio Barolo\n\nA building that combines Neoromantic, Neogothic, and Indian styles in its architecture and is also inspired by Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy? Yes, at the Palacio Barolo, that's possible. This tour is ideal for lovers of both architecture and literature because learning its history - it was commissioned by the agricultural producer Luis Barolo to the architect Mario Palanti - leads you to review one of the most iconic literary works in the world. For that same reason, the building has three parts: Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise. In this last space, on the 13th floor, there is a terrace where you will see one of the most beautiful panoramic views of the city center. And obviously, another must-do plan is to watch the sunset while having a cocktail at its incredible rooftop bar called Salón 1923.\n\nThe tip: above Paradise, there is a lighthouse with a glass dome 100 meters high. Climbing up there is something you will hardly forget. There are guided tours during the day, at night, and personalized.\n\nWhere: Av. De Mayo 1370.\n\n2. Walk or bike through El Rosedal\n\nIt is one of the most important green lungs of the city; it could almost be said that it is the Buenos Aires Central Park. And of course, it is called that precisely because in its 3.4 hectares it has more than 18,000 rose bushes, of 93 different species that make the walk a true feast for the senses.\n\nThe tip: in the center of El Rosedal, there is a typical Andalusian Patio, which was donated by the city of Seville. Also in that same park, there are lagoons, running circuits, bicycles, and rollerblades, for a sports session or simply to bring a blanket and mate, lie on the grass, sunbathe, and contemplate nature in its purest state.\n\nWhere: Av. Libertador y Av. Sarmiento (las calles internas del Parque son Pedro Montt, Iraola e Infanta Isabel).\n\nAdvertising\n\n3. Stroll through Chinatown\n\nThis small gastronomic and cultural hub, where the oriental community of immigrants from China, Japan, and Taiwan gathers, is located in the Belgrano neighborhood and is 100% renewed. The best thing to do is to start the circuit at the 11-meter arch located at the corner of Juramento and Arribeños, specially brought from China. What to do there? Eat street food, buy cheap souvenirs, take a look around its supermarkets for oriental delicacies (there is a great selection of tea blends, fresh fish, and exotic fruits).\n\nTip: If you want to enjoy the emerging gastronomic scene, walk through Pasaje Echeverría, a pedestrian street bursting with vibe, where you can eat one of the best ramen in the city at Orei or enjoy some good empanadas with boutique Argentine wines at Vina Buchette.\n\nWhere: Arribeños y Juramento, Estación Belgrano C, Belgrano.\n\n4. Give Tango Dancing a chance at a Typical Milonga\n\nBuenos Aires moves to the rhythm of the 2x4; it is the musical genre for which we are recognized worldwide, and dancing is always an opportunity to live a different, attractive, and sensual experience. There are many \"milongas\" where tango enthusiasts gather to dance, spread across different neighborhoods, with dancers of all ages. At La Viruta, there are classes for all levels on Wednesdays, Fridays, and Sundays, and after class... the dancing begins!\n\nTip: Just want to watch tango and not dare to dance? Then, your place is El Viejo Almacén, one of the most traditional tango venues in the city, located in a colonial building from 1769, which used to function as a countryside store during the Viceroyalty.\n\nWhere: La Viruta Tango Club (Armenia 1366, Palermo) and El Viejo Almacén (Av. Independencia 299).\n\nAdvertising\n\n5. Stroll through San Telmo Market\n\nWalking through San Telmo on a weekend is a trip back in time; the streets turn into a fair, and just like being at El Rastro in Madrid, you can find vintage pieces and Creole crafts. In the heart of the neighborhood is the Market: a building created in 1897 and used as a food supply center during the first waves of immigrants to the country. A Historic Monument since 2000, today you can find antique collectors - from furniture to objects, clothes, and toys - among its aisles.\n\nTip: If you feel like nibbling on something, in the Market, there are some gastronomic fair stalls to eat well or buy anything from a Mendocino wine to a good choripán.\n\nWhere: Defensa 963.\n\n6. Ascend to the \"Paradise\" of Teatro Colón\n\nIt is Argentina's most important cultural building and one of the most respected opera houses in the world, on par with La Scala in Milan, the Opéra Garnier in Paris, or the Royal Opera House in London. Entering there and experiencing a music concert is undoubtedly an unforgettable experience for any music lover. The guided tour of its building - which took 20 years to build - is also a walk in itself: the main hall is one of the largest in the world, with seating for 3000 spectators. Try to visit during the opera or dance season; you won't regret it.\n\nTip: Also, you can visit Colón Fábrica, an immersive experience in the neighborhood of La Boca, where you can see the scenery, costumes, wigs, and special effects used in their shows.\n\nWhere: Tucumán 1171; Colón Fábrica (Av. Don Pedro de Mendoza 2163).\n\nAdvertising\n\n7. Have a Good Argentine Asado\n\nAsado (barbecue) is the flagship dish of the world-famous \"Argentine beef\" and is also part of the city's gastronomic culture; there are thousands of grills spread across all neighborhoods, for all tastes and budgets. If you're in a luxury mood, it's worth stopping by Don Julio (@donjulioparrilla), which ranks in \"50 Best\" as the third best restaurant in Latin America and was recently included in the Michelin Guide. But if you want a closer experience, there are also great barbecue temples at Desnivel in the San Telmo neighborhood or at El Obrador, in La Boca.\n\nTip: If you want to learn how to prepare it and train in its smoking ritual, take classes at The Asado Experience, led by a team of female grillers.\n\n8. Enjoy \"standing\" pizza at Güerrín\n\nWith this experience, you become a true Porteño. Few gastronomic customs are as emblematic of Buenos Aires as going to this pizzeria on Corrientes Street, which has been selling pan pizzas (with slightly thicker crust than stone-baked pizzas) since 1932. Order individual slices at the counter and eat them \"standing\" in the initial section of the salon, where you'll see the city's life passing by.\n\nTip: If you go with a group or friends, you can also go to their renovated Patio Napolitano, at the back of the premises. The experience is not the same, but the flavor makes up for everything.\n\nWhere: Av. Corrientes 1368.\n\nAdvertising\n\n9. Attend a Boca-River match (or any Buenos Aires superclásico)\n\nSaying Argentina is synonymous with saying football. Everything surrounding a match - especially a superclásico - has the charm of fables and urban mythology. The rituals of arriving at the stadium (the choripán, the chants of the fans, the clothing, the merchandise) are sometimes even more entertaining than the game itself, so even if you're not a fan of this sport, it's a great experience. But if you want to see one of the big clubs, both \"El Monumental\" (River Plate's stadium, in the Núñez neighborhood) and \"La Bombonera\" (Boca Juniors' stadium, in the La Boca neighborhood) are must-visit spots for lovers of world sports.\n\nTip: Both stadiums have their own museums, showcasing the clubs' history and their top players. Obviously, with tremendous stores to buy any merchandise you can think of. For \"millionaires\" (River Plate fans), there's good gastronomic news because the club opened Banda a few months ago, a restaurant where you can eat and drink well with a view of the stadium. A luxury that only a few football fans can afford.\n\nWhere: Estadio Monumental (Av. Pte. Figueroa Alcorta 7597); Estadio La Bombonera (Brandsen 805).\n\n10. Get lost in Ateneo Grand Splendid bookstore\n\nThis bookstore is the largest in South America and was inaugurated in 2000, but its building was originally the Grand Splendid Theater (that's why it keeps its name), and its early 20th-century decoration remains intact: you'll see staircases with original railings and a dome with frescoes of 20 meters in diameter. But besides the architectural impact, you won't believe the number of books its floors and corridors house. Choose the book you like the most and sit on the theater stage to enjoy it. It's a unique feeling. It's probably the most beautiful bookstore you've ever visited.\n\nTip: Not only can you find countless books, but you can also buy records, movies, and games.\n\nWhere: Av. Santa Fe 1860.\n\nAdvertising\n\n11. Go to the theater on Corrientes Street\n\nStrictly speaking, it is one of the city's most important avenues, known as \"the street that never sleeps.\" It has a pedestrian area for strolling and walking with a view of the Obelisco, the monument that, with its 67.5 meters in height, is the quintessential symbol of Buenos Aires, ideal for taking selfies. But it's also the mecca of theatrical life; between Callao and L.N. Alem streets are located the most important theaters in the country – Opera, Gran Rex, San Martín, Complejo La Plaza – which are renewed every season with high-quality shows.\n\nTip: Going to the theater in Buenos Aires is a celebration, and many premieres are coming up, including several musicals.\n\nWhere: Av. Corrientes, from Av. Callao to Av. Leandro N. Alem.\n\n12. Visit Evita's tomb in Recoleta Cemetery\n\nEva Duarte de Perón was perhaps the most iconic woman in Argentina. She was an actress, married General Juan Domingo Perón, was First Lady of the Nation, and became involved in Argentine politics; she founded the Female Peronist Party, and thanks to her impetus, the Female Suffrage Law was passed in 1947, allowing women to vote and participate in democratic life. She was both loved and hated. Myths, legends, musicals, and movies grew around her figure. The most remembered Evita in cinema? None other than Madonna, directed by Alan Parker in 1996. Eva died of cancer on July 26, 1952, and her remains now rest in the Duarte family mausoleum, which is ideal to visit with a guide to learn about all the mysteries surrounding her body.\n\nTip: The Government of the City of Buenos Aires offers free tourist visits from Monday to Sunday from 9 am to 5 pm.\n\nWhere: Junín 1760.\n\nAdvertising\n\n13. Shopping in Palermo\n\nIt's the ideal neighborhood for walking, strolling, and discovering the best circuit of shops from top brands and independent designers, offering the best in fashion, decoration, and culture. Two spots to explore? The surroundings of Plaza Inmigrantes de Armenia and Plaza Serrano, which are a few blocks apart. Get lost in those little streets, and we guarantee you won't leave empty-handed.\n\nTip: It's not only the mecca of fashion but also of the foodie world. There are thousands of cafes and restaurants for snacking and having a drink. A classic that never fails? Marks Deli & Coffee House, a pioneer in the area since it opened in 2002, offers salads, sandwiches, and sweet treats that are superb.\n\nWhere: Plaza Inmigrantes de Armenia (Malabia, between Costa Rica and Nicaragua); Plaza Serrano (Serrano and Honduras).\n\n14. Get inspired and wander through the Flea Market\n\nOn the border between the Palermo and Colegiales neighborhoods, this mega warehouse houses hundreds of stalls of artisans and antique collectors. You'll be able to browse and purchase antique and restored furniture, vintage clothing, tableware, lamps from all eras, and even decorative objects, toys, mirrors, and trunks.\n\nTip: It's worth going with time because each stall is a mysterious universe to discover. And if you're in the mood for digging, we assure you'll find some retro gems to take home at reasonable prices. Open every day (except Monday) from 11 am to 6:30 pm.\n\nWhere: Av. Dorrego y Niceto Vega.\n\nAdvertising\n\n15. Spend some hours at the National Museum of Fine Arts and admire Berni's work\n\nDedicating half a day to touring this museum will allow you to encounter not only one of the largest collections of Argentine art – don't miss the works of Antonio Berni, Quinquela Martin, and Xul Solar – but also to admire some masterpieces of European art and the French impressionist movement – there are paintings by Édouard Manet, Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Edgar Degas, and Paul Gauguin. There are free guided tours without prior registration.\n\nTip: Feeling a bit tired from walking and hungry? In the same building as the museum is Bellas Artes Bar, with three gastronomic proposals for all tastes: La Fernetería, Collette Bar, and Trapizzino Shop, a store offering typical Roman sandwiches.\n\nWhere: Av. Del Libertador 1473.\n\n16. Visit the Plaza de Mayo\n\nIt is the oldest square in the city and is the epicenter of Argentina's historical, political, and social life. In its surroundings, you can find the Casa Rosada - the seat of the Executive Power -, the Cabildo of Buenos Aires, and the Metropolitan Cathedral - where Pope Francis held mass for more than 15 years before becoming the Supreme Pontiff. In the center of the Plaza is the May Pyramid, which besides being the first national monument, is also a highly significant symbolic space in the history of Human Rights, as around this pyramid in 1977 began the marches of the Mothers and Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo, a group of brave women demanding the return of their relatives who disappeared during the Argentine military dictatorship, perpetrated between 1976 and 1983.\n\nFun fact: Every day at 7 p.m., the grenadiers of the Casa Rosada lower the Argentine flag in the square. It's a nice ritual to watch live.\n\nWhere: Hipólito Yrigoyen y Bolívar.\n\nAdvertising\n\n17. Discover the incredible mural by Siqueiros at the Bicentennial Museum\n\nThis may be one of the city's best-kept secrets: beneath the Casa Rosada, the seat of the Executive Power, there is a masterpiece of Latin American art. It's called \"Ejercicio Plástico\" and was created in 1933 by the Mexican muralist David Siqueiros and a group of Argentine painters (Lino Enea Spilimbergo, Antonio Berni, and Juan Carlos Castagnino), along with the Uruguayan set designer Enrique Lázaro. It was commissioned by the businessman Natalio Botana and is a avant-garde experiment for its time: a mural with a surrounding effect for the viewer.\n\nFun fact: If you dare, lie down on the floor to admire it.\n\nWhere: Av. Paseo Colón 100.\n\n18. Dance with La Bomba del Tiempo\n\nRhythm and energy come together at La Bomba de Tiempo, the improvised percussion show that has revolutionized the musical scene of Buenos Aires (and has reached Dubai), with its good vibes and shot of energy. The classic Monday event since 2006: a space to connect with movement and enjoyment to the rhythm of drums. A ritual that, in the heart of Abasto, has attracted millions of spectators and over time has become a Buenos Aires cultural phenomenon.\n\nFun fact: While the classic event happens every Monday at 7 p.m. at Konex, for June 2024 they have scheduled a European tour, visiting cities such as Malaga, Barcelona, Madrid, London, Amsterdam, or Berlin. Great plan if you're traveling or to share with friends from other places.\n\nWhere: Sarmiento 3131.\n\nAdvertising\n\n19. Feel like a child again at MIJU (Museum of Imagination and Play)\n\nThis is especially worthwhile if you're in Buenos Aires with children aged 0 to 12. But it's also worth it if you want to feel like a child again exploring its creative rooms. Because in this museum, the premise is to play and let your imagination soar. There are motor rooms, others more immersive, others more technological, and even a space with outdoor games to connect with nature. It opened in September of last year and is one of the newest museums in the city. Check it out!\n\nFun fact: Don't leave without immersing yourself in the immersive room of Ferocious Tales, to enjoy the classic stories we heard in our childhood, but reimagined and illustrated by great artists.\n\nWhere: Av. de los Italianos 851.\n\n20. Eat alfajores with dulce de leche\n\nA delicious sweet treat to eat at any time. In Argentina, each province has its own alfajor, but most agree on one heavenly ingredient: dulce de leche. This preparation based on milk and sugar can become -spoiler alert- your sweet addiction. You can find them in their more commercial versions at any kiosk in the city, but if you want to try some more sophisticated ones, you can try Guolis, the classic Havanna, or Cachafaz.\n\nAdvertising\n\n21. See the exhibitions at the Usina del Arte\n\nOne of the most modern and innovative cultural centers in the city is now located in the La Boca neighborhood, in the building that was designed to house an electricity plant. It was inaugurated in 1916 and for more than 80 years provided electricity to the city until, in the 1990s, with the privatization of the electricity company, the building was abandoned. After many years of renovation, it was reopened in 2012 as one of the key artistic spaces and is the ideal spot to listen to live music concerts, visit traveling art exhibitions, or take a stroll with children.\n\nFun fact: Around the corner from Usina is the Pablo Ducrós Hicken Film Museum, with treasures for cinephiles.\n\nWhere: Agustín R. Caffarena 1.\n\n22. Make a gourmet stop at the Carriage Market\n\nA traditional market in the heart of the Retiro neighborhood that sells fresh products and also serves as a small gastronomic hub amidst modern skyscrapers. It is a Historic Heritage of the city because it is located on what used to be the site of the \"presidential garages\" of the 19th and early 20th centuries, where presidential carriages were stored. It has more than 40 stalls, but there are some must-visit stops: a trip to Madrid with churros and chocolate from San Ginés, raclette from Pica Despensa, and grab-and-go meat sandwiches from La Cabrera.\n\nFun fact: Don't forget to visit its terrace; it's ideal for having a drink at sunset!\n\nWhere: Leandro N. Alem 852.\n\nAdvertising\n\n23. See the La Boca bridge from the terrace of the Proa Foundation\n\nWalking through the La Boca neighborhood is to feel the port pulse of the city. Be sure to visit Caminito, a pedestrian museum street surrounded by colorful houses that served as tenements during Italian immigration, which settled mainly in this riverside area. Here you'll feel the tango, the culture of Boca Juniors (the Genoese who settled in this area in the early 20th century), the proximity to the river, and the art of Benito Quinquela Martín, the artist who painted the neighborhood in vibrant colors and immortalized it in his art.\n\nFun fact: An ideal spot for the best panoramas? Café Proa, on the terrace of the Fundación Proa, a contemporary art museum to see the city's most innovative artists.\n\nWhere: Av. Don Pedro de Mendoza 1929.\n\n24. Eat a napolitana milanesa at \"El Obrero\"\n\nPorteño taverns are those places where one of our grandmothers could have cooked. They don't have great luxuries or protocols, but there is always homemade and abundant food, always good artisanal pasta, and \"milangas\" napolitana, a typical dish of Argentine gastronomy born in the heat of Italian immigration. This breaded meat covered in tomato sauce, cheese, and ham has more and more versions in our city. Where to eat it? There are many taverns in every neighborhood, but one of the best is in La Boca and it's called \"El Obrero\".\n\nFun fact: A game while waiting for food? Look at the photographs decorating the walls and try to guess the endless list of international personalities who visited, including Bono from U2, Susan Sarandon, Willem Dafoe, and the Prince of Monaco.\n\nWhere: Agustín Caffarena 64.\n\nAdvertising\n\n25. Travel to space at the Galileo Galilei Planetarium\n\nIf you're a lover of the celestial world, don't miss out on the experience of seeing more than 8,900 stars, planets, and satellites of the universe in a semicircular dome, with unique technology in Latin America. Yes, it's literally out of this world.\n\nFun fact: Also, on weekends there are telescopes available for free sky watching, on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\nWhere: Av. Sarmiento y Av. Belisario Roldán.\n\n26. Eat a choripán at a stall on the Costanera\n\nThe traditional \"carts\" can be seen as the most genuine food trucks in the city, those stalls that roam the avenues bordering the river (both in Costanera Sur and Norte). They usually offer meat sandwiches, pork loin, burgers, but if you want to play it safe, order an authentic choripán. As its name suggests, it's a chorizo sandwich... 100% unforgettable. It's an essential part of any barbecue. It's the pre or post-match ritual at the stadium.\n\nFun fact: Season it with \"chimichurri\" or \"salsa criolla\". It's a one-way ticket.\n\nWhere: Av. Dr. Tristán Achaval Rodríguez 1150.\n\nAdvertising\n\n27. Bike through the Costanera Sur Ecological Reserve\n\nDeclared a Natural Park, this is the city's best green space to explore biodiversity, contemplate nature, and be in contact with the flora and fauna of the Rio de la Plata ecosystem, forgetting a bit about the city's concrete and chaos. You can rent bicycles and do the circuit on two wheels or hike - there are six designated paths - and birdwatching, as this reserve is a destination for enthusiasts to observe its more than 343 species.\n\nFun fact: Another highlight? Discover the ceibo, Argentina's national flower, with its typical reddish bloom.\n\nWhere: Av. Dr. Tristán Achaval Rodríguez 1550.\n\n28. Have a coffee at one of the city's notable bars\n\n\"Shall we have a coffee?\" is a phrase that any true porteño says perhaps more than once a day. This ritual has a circuit of notable bars in the city, spaces with a certain spirit and history, where great personalities of Argentine culture were regular customers and protagonists. There is a notable bar in almost every neighborhood (there are a total of 82), but you can fine-tune and find your favorite.\n\nFun fact: We recommend Los 36 billares and Café Tortoni, both on Av. De Mayo; Café San Bernardo on Av. Corrientes; Las Violetas on Av. Rivadavia, and Bar Los Galgos on Av. Callao.\n\nAdvertising\n\n29. Marvel at the best of Latin American art at the Malba\n\nWith its collection of about 400 works by the most renowned artists in the region - including Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera, Antonio Berni, Xul Solar, and Fernando Botero - visiting the Malba (Museum of Latin American Art of Buenos Aires) is a must. Additionally, there are always cutting-edge temporary exhibitions, thematic film cycles, and cultural extension activities for adults and children.\n\nFun fact: After the visit, you can enjoy its art store (with books, objects, and the best of emerging design) and its restaurant.\n\nWhere: Av. Figueroa Alcorta 3415.\n\n30. Perform an impossible dribble in a Diego Maradona mural\n\nThe global soccer star is perhaps one of the reasons Argentina is recognized in many parts of the world. Especially after his death on November 25, 2020, the city tries to honor him in infinite ways; one of the most beautiful is through street art. In numerous streets, corners, and fields of the city, the football D10S is immortalized in images, colors, and postcards that paint him forever. One of the most impressive is the one made by the artist Martin Ron on a 1800 square meter wall, in the San Cristóbal neighborhood. But you'll surely come across many more.\n\nFun fact: Other Maradona tours? The stadium of Club Atlético Argentinos Juniors is also full of different images of him on the walls; you can also visit “La Casa de D10S” in the La Paternal neighborhood, which was the first family home that Diego could buy as a professional footballer.\n\nWhere: Av. San Juan y Solís.\n\nAdvertising\n\n31. Go have tea in the gardens of the Duhau Palace\n\nFew buildings in Buenos Aires have the power to transport you elsewhere like the Duhau Palace; entering its gardens is almost like feeling for a moment in Paris, given that the architectural inspiration is from the French neoclassical period. It was formerly a residence of aristocratic families, but since 2006, it has been the headquarters of the Park Hyatt Buenos Aires, one of the city's most exclusive hotels. If the budget doesn't allow for a dreamy overnight stay, it doesn't matter: you can also enjoy - for a much more modest price - its classic \"five o'clock tea\" in the halls of the Piano Nobile (one of its restaurants); the selection of sweet petit fours from its patisserie will make you delirious with excitement. We recommend asking for a table on the outdoor terrace, with an incredible view of the gardens.\n\nFun fact: If you're more into savory and want to try one of the best plant-based menus in the city, don't miss the proposal from Gioia Cocina Botánica. You won't regret it.\n\nWhere: Av. Alvear 1661.\n\n32. Go read a good book in the central courtyard of the Recoleta Cultural Center\n\nLocated near many tourist attractions in the city - the Museum of Fine Arts, the Recoleta Cemetery, and the Plaza Francia Crafts Fair - this cultural center is one of the most vibrant, with innovative proposals for all tastes. In addition to having an incredible agenda of art exhibitions, photography, and concerts, it has some hidden gems. For example, in the center of the building, there is a huge courtyard with small tables, lounge chairs, and trees, where the best plan is to sit down and read your favorite book. Didn't bring any book? No problem; right there operates a branch of Librería Céspedes, a literary refuge with the best selection.\n\nFun fact: Want to accompany your reading with a coffee and something tasty? No problem; there is also a branch of Bilbo Café in the same building.\n\nWhere: Junín 1930.\n\nAdvertising\n\n33. Dance like never before at La Grande on Tuesdays\n\nIsn't it a wonderful plan to go dancing on a Tuesday night? You'll have a lot of fun (and move a lot more!) with this proposal from La Grande, a rhythmic improvisation band created by Santiago Vázquez. It has been running for 8 years now, every Tuesday starting at 7 p.m. in Chacarita, in an artistic space that also has a food and beverage bar, ping-pong, foosball, and a lot of cool vibes.\n\nFun fact: There are also sets by resident DJs, just to keep the dance going until midnight.\n\nWhere: Santos Dumont 4040.\n\n34. Take a stroll through the Ciudad Cultural Konex\n\nBefore being one of the most innovative cultural spaces in the city, this building housed, from 1920 to 1992, an oil factory. Then, it was remodeled by the Clorindo Testa studio - one of the Argentine architects representing the brutalist movement - and today it is a space where you can enjoy theatrical works, artistic performances, concerts, and \"out of the box\" experiences for both adults and children. Choose any of the highlights from its permanent agenda.\n\nFun fact: In addition to being a cultural circuit of the Buenos Aires underground scene, Abasto is a neighborhood where the city's Peruvian cuisine has its best representatives. A favorite that's almost a direct trip to Lima? Los Trujillanitos (at Av. Corrientes 3564), for a good ceviche after enjoying a show.\n\nWhere: Sarmiento 3131.\n\nAdvertising\n\n35. Have a cocktail at Florería Atlántico\n\nIs it a flower shop? Is it a bar? Is it a restaurant? Well, it's all of that together. And much more. Located on one of Buenos Aires' most Parisian streets, visiting this place is a beautiful surprise: on the outside, the facade of a traditional flower shop, with its window full of flowers and colors. But upon opening a secret door, you find yourself facing a staircase that leads you straight to an underworld, mysterious, and secret maritime world. Because beneath the flower shop lies, perhaps, one of the most beautiful bars in the city. Created by the great Tato Giovannoni - one of the country's star bartenders - here you'll find a great selection of signature cocktails, which you can accompany with seafood cuisine.\n\nFun fact: In addition to its classic drinks, there is a series of beverages inspired by the stories of indigenous peoples. That's the way to go.\n\nWhere: Arroyo 872.\n\n36. Watch the sunset over the Río de la Plata from Costanera Norte\n\nA great plan that doesn't require pesos; this natural spectacle that happens every day with the sunset has an ideal spot for its best views in Costanera Norte. And beware, because the plan is twofold: if you position yourself in front of Jorge Newbery Airport, you can also watch the takeoff and landing of airplanes, which is often a fun plan for both adults and children. And if suddenly you're hungry? Also in this section of the coastal avenue, there are multiple \"carts\" that sell food and drinks on the go.\n\nFun fact: Pork loin sandwiches and choripanes are in high demand as the evening falls.\n\nWhere: Av. Costanera Rafael Obligado.\n\nAdvertising\n\n37. Dine at Aramburu\n\nWith the arrival of the Michelin gastronomic guide to Buenos Aires (it's also in the city of Mendoza), there are some restaurants that are in full hype. And with good reason. Aramburu is the only Argentine to be awarded two stars, thanks to its sophisticated proposal under the leadership of chef Gonzalo Aramburu. Of course, eating there can be an experience not suitable for all budgets, but rather a luxury that deserves some celebration. But for this same reason, the world's most famous gastronomic guide also recognized a handful of spots with the Bib Gourmand award, which precisely evaluates the price-quality relationship when choosing.\n\nFun fact: Want to eat with a Michelin seal, but without spending a fortune? Then the best options are Mengano,Bis Bistró - also by Gonzalo Aramburu -, Reliquia,Anafe andLa Alacena.\n\nWhere: Pasaje del Correo, Vicente López 1661.\n\n38. Enjoy art with the Amalita Collection\n\nAmalita Lacroze de Fortabat was, for many years, the richest person in Argentina. She was a businesswoman - she owned Loma Negra, a cement and concrete factory - philanthropist, and a passionate art collector, both Argentine and international. In 2008, she inaugurated her own museum in the Puerto Madero neighborhood - designed by Uruguayan architect Rafael Viñoly - with more than 250 works that she owned and decided to share with the general public. In its halls, you will find pieces by the most important Argentine artists - Antonio Berni, Prilidiano Pueyrredón, Benito Quinquela Martin, Xul Solar, Juan Carlos Castagnino, Marta Minujin, among others - and also pieces by Salvador Dalí, Andy Warhol, Marc Chag.\n\nTip: Right there is the most beautiful location of Croque Madame, the French bistro that has stolen the hearts of Buenos Aires residents with its cuisine and its strategic locations, in the most picturesque spaces of the city.\n\nWhere: Olga Cossettini 141.\n\nAdvertising\n\n39. Singing \"Mi Buenos Aires querido\" in front of the remains of Carlos Gardel\n\nSome records say he was born in France, others say he was born in Uruguay, but few figures define Argentina as much as this tango singer - also an actor and composer - who took this musical genre from Buenos Aires to the highest peaks. \"El Zorzal\" tragically died on June 24, 1935, in Medellin (Colombia), as a result of an aviation accident, and his remains now rest in the Mausoleum of Chacarita Cemetery.\n\nTip: afterward, you can take the opportunity to explore this neighborhood and its gastronomic offerings, with El Imperio de la Pizza - for a quick slice of muzza -, Picarón - for a slightly more sophisticated menu - or stop by to meet Ipolitina, a true Italian \"nonna\" who cooks all the typical dishes of her homeland in her small place, including - of course - a true Roman pizza.\n\nWhere: Av. Guzmán 680.\n\n40. Attending a concert with the best audience in the world\n\nWe're not saying it, musicians, artists, and other fans who visit us say it: the Argentine audience has that \"je ne sais quoi.\" We don't know if it's the passion and energy with which we sing, the rituals around the shows, or the collective euphoria we surrender to, but the truth is that any concert becomes a superlative experience in these lands. The best concert venues in the city to experience a show? Without a doubt, the Monumental Stadium, in the Núñez neighborhood, and the Movistar Arena, in the Villa Crespo neighborhood. We challenge you to surpass this experience.\n\nTip: check the schedule to see which concerts are coming up.\n\nWhere: Av. Pres. Figueroa Alcorta 7597;Humboldt 450.\n\nAdvertising\n\n41. Walking along the docks of Puerto Madero\n\nIt has skyscrapers and luxurious offices. It has five-star hotels. It has museums and art centers. It has a view of the river and a waterfront. It has a varied gastronomic offer, with the most renowned restaurants in the city, one next to the other. Without a doubt, Puerto Madero is one of the most modern neighborhoods and, at the same time, with more history in the city. Walking through its streets is to understand that mixture between its port origins, its imprint as the financial capital of the country, and the tourist attraction for export.\n\nTip: some must-sees in the neighborhood? Crossing the Puente de la Mujer - designed by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava -, visiting the ship-museum A.R.A Fragata Sarmiento - moored in Dique 3 - and ending the day by having some drinks at The Library Lounge, the incredible bar of the Hotel Faena.\n\n42. Visiting the ESMA Memory Site Museum\n\nThe ESMA (former School of Mechanics of the Navy) functioned as an illegal detention site during the last Military Dictatorship, which occurred between 1976 and 1983. In the democratic era, this building became one of the greatest symbols of memory and human rights in Argentina.\n\nTip: visiting its rooms and exhibitions - permanent and temporary - and listening to the testimonies of the survivors is almost a must for all those who want to understand our recent history.\n\nWhere: Av. Del Libertador 8151/8571.\n\nAdvertising\n\n43. Cycling through the city's most beautiful bike paths\n\nLet's admit it: we may not be Amsterdam or Berlin, but we have our own thing when it comes to bike culture. Buenos Aires is a very bike-friendly city; we don't have steep slopes or gradients in our geography, so a great plan is to create a route through its extensive network of bike paths and cycle lanes.\n\nTip: the most beautiful ones in the city? Those that run along Av. Del Libertador (passing through the Rosedal de Palermo), Figueroa Alcorta (passing through the River Plate Monumental Stadium and part of the Palermo Lakes), Superí streets (to admire the beautiful architecture of Belgrano R), and Gorriti (to make gastronomic stops at small places in Palermo).\n\n44. Taking a photo with Mafalda at the Paseo de la Historieta\n\nMafalda is probably one of the most iconic illustrated characters in our country. And in the world. Created in 1964 by the cartoonist Quino, this girl - concerned about world peace, social movements, and who rebelled against the adult world - addressed through graphic humor a critique of the society of the 60s and 70s. At the corner of Chile and Defensa, in the heart of the San Telmo neighborhood, there is a replica of her, sitting on a park bench and accompanied by her beloved friends Susanita and Manolito.\n\nTip: if you're into comics, you can continue visiting the stops along the walk; there are figures of Clemente, Isidoro Cañones, and Patoruzú, other indispensable protagonists of Argentine comics.\n\nWhere: Chile 371.\n\nAdvertising\n\n45. Watching the city at night from the dome of the Kirchner Cultural Center\n\nIn the emblematic building that used to be the Palace of Post and Telegraphs, today stands the Kirchner Cultural Center (or CCK), a completely renovated cultural space with an area of more than 100,000 square meters dedicated to art, music, theater, literature, and childhood.\n\nTip: there are many proposals for all tastes, but we recommend two experiences: listening to a concert in the National Auditorium or the Sala Argentina (both with incredible acoustics and architecture) and going up to La Cúpula, at the top of the building, which with its 500 square meters completely glazed allows one of the most beautiful panoramas of the city center, especially at night.\n\nWhere: Sarmiento 151.\n\n46. Having a cocktail from the heights at the Trade Sky Bar\n\nThe Buenos Aires night is magical. And even more so from the 19th floor, 88 meters high. If you feel like sitting down and toasting with a cocktail at one of the most beautiful bars in the city - and with one of the best views - this is your place. Also, this \"heights bar\" is in the Comega building (built in 1934), an architectural heritage of Buenos Aires for its rationalist imprint.\n\nTip: if you go early, from around 6 p.m., you can contemplate a postcard that you'll hardly forget: watching the sun set behind the Obelisk in a dreamy sunset.\n\nWhere: Av. Corrientes 222, piso 19.\n\nAdvertising\n\n47. Taking a ride on the historic tram\n\nThis is an original and fun way to explore the city. For about 100 years, the tram was the quintessential urban transport, until it disappeared in 1963. Today there is still a \"historic tramway\" service, which makes a 20-minute journey in the Caballito neighborhood, ideal for family outings and a trip back in time, since everything - the vehicle, the driver's clothing, and even the ticket you receive when boarding - refers you to another era. It only operates on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays.\n\nTip: if you want another trip back in time very close by, a few blocks away you can visit the historic Mercado del Progreso, which was founded in 1889 and today still stands as one of the most important gastronomic fairs in the city.\n\nWhere: Emilio Mitre al 500.\n\n48. Strolling through the English Quarter of Caballito\n\nWant another plan nearby? Take a walk through the English Quarter of Caballito; you'll think you're in London at times, with its British-style residences, quiet sidewalks, and some bars and restaurants to have a five o'clock tea.\n\nTip: we recommend having dinner at Centro, the restaurant of chef Fernando Golabek, in one of the most elegant corners of the city, located in an impressive art deco building from 1940 that enhances the high gastronomic proposal of the chef who worked in three Michelin-starred restaurants in Europe and returned to his homeland to open his own project in the geographical center of the city of Buenos Aires.\n\nWhere: between Pedro Goyena and Del Barco Centera avenues, and Emilio Mitre and Valle streets.\n\nAdvertising\n\n49. Photographing cherry blossoms in the Japanese Garden\n\nIf you want to find an oasis in the middle of the city, the Japanese Garden - the largest Japanese-style park outside of Japan - is one of those spaces that can transport you. It's a place with magic, almost dreamlike, where the green environment - full of cherry blossoms, bonsai trees, natural ponds with fish, orchids, magnolias, and camellias - harmonizes with the ancestral culture of the East.\n\nTip: it also has a tea house (Chashitsu), where you can experience a traditional tea ceremony, and a restaurant where you can try sushi of the highest quality.\n\nWhere: Av. Casares 3401.\n\n50. Reading a story by Borges at the National Library\n\nThis is the most important library in Argentina. There are many reasons to visit it: it was founded in 1810, one of its most important Directors was none other than Jorge Luis Borges - who led it from 1955 to 1973 - and its building is amazing. It is an iconic work worldwide of brutalist architecture, which was led by the architect Clorindo Testa. Take a few hours in its spacious reading rooms to read some classics of the work of the key writer of our literature.\n\nTip: if you've immersed yourself too much in the stories and words, another plan is to continue reading at the outdoor tables of Invernadero Bar, at the foot of the library, with a good gin and tonic in hand (they specialize in this classic drink, so be sure to try their varieties).\n\nWhere: Agüero 2502."
