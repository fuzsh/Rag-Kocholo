Rob Lowe is preparing to get shagadelic as he winds up negotiations to rejoin his “Wayne’s World” co-star Mike Myers in the sequel to the 1997 hit spypic goof, “Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery.”

The original “Powers” starred Myers as the very groovy British secret agent frozen in an early-1960s concept of hipness. The comedy grossed $54 million in U.S. receipts.

New Line’s followup, “Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,” stars Myers and Heather Graham (“Two Girls and a Guy,” “Lost in Space”). Jay Roach, who helmed the original “Powers,” returns to direct the sequel. Myers and Michael McCullers scripted. Producers include Myers, John Lyons and Erwin Stoff. A November start date is planned in anticipation of a June release.

Lowe will also star in a two-part NBC mini, “Atomic Train,” in which he plays an investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board who races to prevent an explosion on a government railroad convoy that’s carrying nuclear waste. Telepic, currently lensing in Vancouver, will air in 1999.

Lowe was repped in the “Powers” deal by Tiffany Kanter and Kevin Stolper at United Talent Agency. He’s managed by Bernie Brillstein and Peter Safran at Brillstein-Grey Entertainment.
