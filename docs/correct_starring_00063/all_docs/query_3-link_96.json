        "text": "It's no secret that I spend a healthy amount of time defending films that were written off after opening weekend and/or were wrongly tagged with the label of failure. I may eventually do a straight sequel to that \"flops that weren't\" piece from August (perhaps if The Wolverine ends up crossing $459.4 million to become the biggest-grossing X-Men film, it's already in second place), but for the moment I'd like to concentrate on what I feel is the definitive \"flop that wasn't\". I'm speaking of course of Mike Myers and Jay Roach's modern comedy classic Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery.\n\nThe strange thing about this franchise-starter is that it was actually held up as a solid hit in the aftermath of its theatrical release. But its reputation has changed over the last sixteen years for the explicit purpose of giving hope to hopeless franchises. To wit, Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery opened on May 2, 1997 to the tune of $9.5 million on 2,115 screens. It came in second that weekend to fellow opener Breakdown, a Paramount release which opened with $12.3m during that brief post-Stargate period (1994-1998) when Kurt Russell was a face-on-the-poster opener (it is today most notable for including the first trailer to James Cameron's Titanic). The New Line Cinema release earned solid reviews and eventually garnered equally solid word-of-mouth. The film fell just 26% in weekend two for a $7m weekend and then fell 17% in weekend three. By the time the film left theaters, it had acquired $53.8m domestically and $13.8m overseas. That's a worldwide total of $67.8m, or 4.1x its $16.5m budget.\n\nBy any rational standard, that's a solid hit. So, sixteen years later, why is the film's reputation that of a bomb or a disappointment*? Well, its reputation stems from what happened next and what it represents. The film proved uncommonly popular on home video. The priced-to-buy VHS proved popular due to new audiences discovering the film after hearing from people like myself about how great it was (I saw it in an oddly packed theatrical screening on the third Friday of its release and loved it), and due to the fact it actually contained a number of buzz-worthy deleted scenes at the end of the feature, a rarity for a VHS film. In theaters, on video, and on that brand new thing called \"DVD\" (it was among the first batch of DVDs released into the market), the film became a genuine pop culture item, with fans quoting the various catch phrases and character beats and turning Powers and Dr. Evil into pop culture icons.\n\nTwo years later, we got the much-anticipated Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. While the film's teaser amusingly admitted that it was at-best the second most anticipated film of summer 99 (\"If you see one movie this year... see Star Wars! But if you see two movies this summer...\"), it parlayed franchise goodwill and a superb marketing campaign into a stunning $54 million debut weekend, the third-biggest opening weekend on record at the time. Yes, the second Austin Powers film earned more on its opening weekend than the original did over its entire theatrical run. If the first film was a cult hit that grew in acclaim and appreciation, the sequel established the Austin Powers franchise as the biggest comedy franchise on the block, surpassing (at least in America) even the 007 series that it was intended to spoof. The Spy Who Shagged Me ended its theatrical run with $206 million domestic and $105m overseas, for a dynamite $310m total on a $33m budget.\n\nThree years later, Austin Powers: Goldmember may have pleased neither audiences nor critics, but it closed out the trilogy with a $73m debut (the fourth biggest debut at that time and still bigger than any 007 opening outside of Skyfall and bigger than any Bourne or Mission: Impossible debut) and a $213m US/$86m overseas total. The franchise stands as a prototypical example of a series that absolutely exploded after the first entry, akin to the Terminator series (which took just over three days to surpass the domestic total of the first film), the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, and the Chris Nolan Dark Knight trilogy (which took just over five days to trump part I). But unlike those franchises, its initial entry is consistently tagged as a flop for one very specific reason: To give hope to fans who pine for a second installment of their favorite genuine flop franchise.\n\nThe reason that the first Austin Powers needs to be seen as a failure that broke out on part II, rather than a solid hit whose sequel exploded the second time out, is that it gives false hope to those who would want to see a John Carter 2 from Disney or a Dredd 2 from Lionsgate. Whenever a geek-centric film flames out, you still get those who hope or feel entitled to a second installment. And eventually the conversation comes around to \"Look at Austin Powers!\". The idea is of course that a proverbial MacGruber 2 could somehow parlay the alleged goodwill of the first installment and thus break out the second time around. But of course Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery technically broke out the first time around.\n\nIt was a cheap comedy with no expectations and little pre-release buzz that had a leggy run in the opening frames of summer 1997. It had good reviews and terrific word-of-mouth, which resulted in its successful theatrical release being supplemented by a healthy home video run as well. Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery wasn't a flop the first time that broke out via a sequel. It was a hit the first time around too. It didn't lose money while becoming a cult favorite among the passionate few, it was a box office hit that grossed four times its budget on theatrical distribution alone. But if we admit that fact, then those who pine for unlikely sequels to the likes of Universal's Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World will have to admit that it's just not going to happen. So we keep repeating the lie that Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery was a box office flop.\n\nBut it's not true. It wasn't true in 1997 and it's not true today. It's time to undo the years of libel thrown at what remains one of the great mainstream comedies and social satires of the 1990's. We can debate the critical merits of each installment (I hate both sequels, you probably like the second one) or whether or not there remains a need for a fourth installment (absolutely not). But what is absolutely inarguable is that Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery was a hit in theaters as well as a hit on video.\n\n* The second piece I linked to is an otherwise fine piece of box office \"corrective\" history that, respective disagreement aside, I heartily recommend reading."
