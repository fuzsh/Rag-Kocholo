        "text": "I didn't go to college.\n\nI was gonna go but then I got The Outsiders.\n\nAm I gonna do The Outsiders with Francis Ford Coppola\n\nor am I gonna go to freshman year at UCLA, USC?\n\nI think I chose okay.\n\nHi, I'm Rob Lowe, and this is the timeline of my career.\n\n[jazzy music]\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nMy first big job, I was 15, I had a David Cassidy hairdo.\n\nAlthough, my brother Chad likes to say that\n\nmy hairdo looked more like Karen Carpenter's.\n\nIt's a look.\n\nI had my first girlfriend and in the summers,\n\nI would have to go back to Ohio to visit my dad\n\n'cause my parents were divorced.\n\nI had to go away for the summer and I was so heartbroken.\n\nMy agents called and they were like,\n\nYeah, there's an audition if you wanna\n\npay your own fare and fly back for it.\n\nYes, I'll do it!\n\nI could've cared less.\n\nThe only real reason I came back\n\nis 'cause I wanted to see the girl.\n\nWell, I got it.\n\nI learned a lot about comedy from Eileen Brennan,\n\nwho played my mom, and she was just coming off of\n\nPrivate Benjamin, where she was nominated for an Oscar.\n\nWe shot a bunch of shows and weren't on the air.\n\nThen all of a sudden, we were on the air\n\nand did our next show and when I came out,\n\nthe girls screamed in the audience.\n\nWe'd been on the air one week.\n\nAnd I thought, Wait a minute, I'm still the dweeb\n\nthat couldn't get a date in high school.\n\nThat's the power of entertainment.\n\nIt was a horrible bomb.\n\nThere were 62 shows on television.\n\nYou're lookin' at number 62, dead last.\n\nAnd the network's big fix, literally you turn it on\n\none Friday and there was this new family living there.\n\nIt didn't work.\n\nBut here's the good news: the daughter?\n\nJanet Jackson, Miss Jackson if you're nasty.\n\nSuper-what? All brawn, no brains.\n\nDarry, have you seen my DX shirt somewhere?\n\nNo. Hey,\n\nyou gotta wear pants, too, buddy.\n\nI think there's a law or somethin' bout that.\n\nHow 'bout my jeans?\n\nI was still new enough that\n\nI didn't realize how unique it was.\n\nCoppola had all of the actors auditioning\n\ncome at the same time to a soundstage that he had bought\n\nand we would all sit on the floor\n\nand we would play characters and then he would send one down\n\nand have somebody come up and change characters\n\nand we all watched each other.\n\nAnd then it went on like this, 12 hours a day, for days.\n\nI don't know if the best actors got the parts,\n\nbut I will tell you that for sure\n\nthe most competitive and the toughest ones did.\n\nKill or be killed.\n\nWhen we got the movie, there was a ton of prep.\n\nFrancis would create a world for us,\n\nhe would have us go and sleep overnight\n\nfor nights with these greaser families.\n\nSo, it's me and Tom Cruise in a guest bedroom\n\nin some bad area of Tulsa, Oklahoma\n\nwith some people who are high school delinquents.\n\nFrancis wanted to toughen us up\n\nso he had us play tackle football on the asphalt\n\nwith, like, the local gang o' thugs.\n\nTommy Howell, being the sophisticated one of all of us,\n\nand he was all of 13, huddled us up, and he says,\n\nI don't know about you but I'm outta here.\n\nIf I break my leg on this play,\n\nthey'll have somebody else playing Ponyboy tomorrow.\n\nAnd we'd sorta boycotted it and walked off. [laughs]\n\n[upbeat rock music]\n\nEndless, endless, endless training for the rumble.\n\nThat was my first time learning a stunt\n\nand we had the great Buddy Joe Hooker,\n\nprobably the first iconic stuntman.\n\nEach one of us got to sort of choreograph\n\nour own version of the fight\n\nthat we would work on relentlessly.\n\nThe day we went to shoot it,\n\nwas a massive, torrential rainstorm.\n\nFrancis said, I'll just shoot in the rain.\n\nAnd then the rain stopped, so for the next week,\n\nwe had to bring in fake rain.\n\nGod, just those nights under that rain and that mud.\n\nI mean, it wasn't Apocalypse Now\n\nbut it was as close as we were gonna get.\n\nEvery seventh grader in the country,\n\npretty much, is required to read the book.\n\nAnd, of course, they see the movie.\n\nSo every year, I get 13 year olds who lose their mind.\n\nThat is an amazing gift as an actor.\n\nI'll always kinda be frozen in time.\n\nIt's really special, I have to say.\n\n[upbeat rock music] [shouting]\n\nYou know what it is?\n\nIt's St. Elmo's fire, electric flashes of light\n\nthat appear in dark skies outta nowhere.\n\n[fire whooshing]\n\nTo be barely 21, being able to\n\nmake movies with people you loved,\n\nand the movies were about us hanging out,\n\nso all we did was hang out.\n\nThe part I played was the part of Billy.\n\nI know a good part when I read one,\n\nbut they didn't want me for that part,\n\nthey wanted me to play the straight,\n\nsquare part that Judd Nelson played.\n\n'Cause they didn't think I was edgy enough.\n\nSo I spent the next 20 years of my life proving them wrong.\n\nI showed up for my meeting with Joel Shumacher\n\nwith, like, a six-pack of beer and he was like,\n\nOh, this guy's edgy enough.\n\nAnd I, I got that part.\n\nThat's not a, an easy speech, it's so earnest.\n\nAnd also, the meaning of St. Elmo's fire is all wacky.\n\nSailors would guide entire journeys by it.\n\nSailors thought it was the things\n\nthat appeared on the masts of ships but it's not,\n\nit's the things that appear in the, it's like, augh.\n\nBut I think I did it okay.\n\nThey made it up because they thought they needed it\n\nto keep 'em going when things got tough.\n\nThose movies still have a meaning,\n\nwhich I'm shocked at, really.\n\nSomething like Stranger Things, for example, and you go,\n\nOh, yeah, that's, that's based on\n\nmy character from St. Elmo's Fire.\n\n[upbeat saxophone music]\n\nThe year that that came out,\n\nI remember going out for Halloween\n\nand seeing multiple people dressed as my character.\n\nWeird and awesome!\n\nBy the way, the only reason I knew it were my character\n\nis they had a saxophone around their necks and a bad wig.\n\nI followed Clarence Clemons around, from the E Street Band.\n\nUsually it's worn right here but mine's worn like a guitar\n\nand I can throw it over my back, it's a guitar strap.\n\nIt's hilarious, it's so good.\n\nYeah, the sax scene's my favorite.\n\nI can fake-play the sax to this day.\n\nI'm better at fake-doing everything.\n\nWelcome to Club Sprockets, Etienne.\n\nThank you, Dieter.\n\nIf you'da told me that I would host\n\nSaturday Night Live one day, I'd be like, Get outta.\n\nIt was the highlight\n\nand, frankly, remains.\n\nOne of the greatest compliments I ever got\n\nwas from Mike Myers who said that I shoulda been\n\na Not Ready for Prime Time Player, me and Alec Baldwin,\n\nand I would have loved that.\n\nLorne likes to describe hosting it as being,\n\nit's like being shot out of a cannon.\n\nI mean, the adrenaline when they announce you\n\nand you come out and it's that iconic stage\n\nand they're playing that iconic opening music.\n\nIn terms of rushes, I don't know if I've ever topped that.\n\nThe real collaboration I had was with Mike Myers.\n\nHe was either gonna do a Wayne's World sketch or Sprockets.\n\nAnd I was like, I'm not a big Wayne's World fan.\n\nLittle did I know.\n\nAnd I played Etienne, the pansexual choreographer.\n\nIt was heaven.\n\nMike and I had such a good time\n\nthat when he wrote Wayne's World,\n\nhe wrote me into it purely because of that.\n\nI know that I may be wasting my time\n\nbut here I am with the contract\n\nand two cashier's checks for five thousand dollars each.\n\nMike and Dana had never been in a movie.\n\nThey didn't know where to stand in front of a camera.\n\nI'm not kidding.\n\nAnd Paramount was like, Yeah, whatever, sure, Lorne.\n\nHere's some chump change, go make your little whatever.\n\nAnd I sat in a screening and Bohemian Rhapsody came on\n\nand when they started moving their heads\n\nlike this, the place went ballistic.\n\n[Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen]\n\nLike I've never seen before.\n\nAnd I remember looking at Mike and they were\n\nlooking at each other and going, Holy shit.\n\nAnd literally the rest was history.\n\nBenjamin was a really, really fun character for me to do\n\nand started my mini-career as a good looking comic dick.\n\nI was just so excited to be allowed to be funny.\n\nAnd then as it grew into Tommy Boy and Austin Powers,\n\nit was a chance to use a muscle\n\nthat I hadn't had a chance to.\n\nI mean, About Last Night and St. Elmo's Fire\n\nhave comedy in them, but they're not comedy comedies,\n\nso it was, it was pretty fun.\n\nYeah, you're fired.\n\n[ominous music]\n\nYou guys, come on, can you believe\n\nJohn Smith is getting married tomorrow?\n\nI'm uncredited in Tommy Boy and the first Austin.\n\nWell, you know he works as a henchman for Dr. Evil.\n\n'Cause that's literally a cameo in the very first Austin.\n\nI think it's only in the extended DVD cut.\n\nMike and I, as I said, were friends\n\nand we were playing golf one day.\n\nI grew up with Robert Wagner, I knew his daughters,\n\nand we started talking about RJ, as he was called,\n\nand I imitated him and Mike lost his mind.\n\nWe laughed about it and that was it.\n\nAnd six months later, he sent me\n\nAustin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and there I am,\n\nin the script, Young Number 2, played by Rob Lowe.\n\nFirst of all, Dr. Evil's my favorite\n\ncharacter in cinema history.\n\nThe globe that was there, when we were screwin' around,\n\nI would dribble it like a basketball\n\nand it got me thinking and I went to Mike\n\nand I said, Hey Mike, do you remember The Great Santini?\n\nAnd Mike's a cinemaphile like me\n\nand that's a great movie with Robert Duvall.\n\nHe was a bastard father and he's\n\nmaking his son play basketball.\n\nI bet you're gonna cry.\n\nC'mon, momma's boy.\n\nLet's see you cry, come on, squirt it some, come on, cry.\n\nAnd I was like, We should do The Great Santini\n\nwhere you throw the ball off my head.\n\nWe only did it once, we did it in one take\n\nas an ad lib and it made it into the movie.\n\nHuh, you gonna cry?\n\nNo, I'm not gonna cry. You gonna cry?\n\nOh, what are you-- Huh, huh?\n\nAre you gonna squirt some? I don't really think\n\nI'm gonna, oh-- You gonna cry, huh, huh?\n\n[sobbing]\n\nYeah, see?\n\nYou gonna cry, huh?\n\nYou're a big man now, huh?\n\nYeah, thought so.\n\nThere's a woman over there, I think she's lookin' at me.\n\nReally? I dunno.\n\nI never know if they're lookin' or not.\n\nWhen I read the title, West Wing, I thought it was\n\na sequel to the Pensacola: Wings of Gold.\n\nNo idea what the hell it was.\n\nI never really had this in my career, ever.\n\nI was like, Oh, I'm this guy.\n\nThat's all fine and good for me to feel that way.\n\nThe question is what does everybody else think.\n\nAnd I vaguely knew the name Aaron Sorkin.\n\nAaron, to this day, has you come in and read\n\n'cause his writing's very specific\n\nand you can either do it or you can't.\n\nThey offered me the part in the parking lot.\n\nI clearly had a connection that.\n\nI had a conversation with a very famous actor\n\nwho was maybe going to do Newsroom.\n\nDo you have to say everything that he?\n\nI'm like, Yeah.\n\nBut so wait, so like, I can't, like,\n\nyou know, like, make it my own?\n\nI'm like, Dude, you're not making it your own.\n\nWhat, why would I ever wanna do that?\n\nI'm like, Because the beauty of it is the math.\n\nBeing able to be in the orchestra\n\nand to know your place, to play your notes.\n\nI remember the audition, like, I knew it cold,\n\ncomma, letter perfect.\n\nI mean, Aaron's just a guy who writes great stuff.\n\nI do think, though, coming offa that comedy run I was on\n\ngot me the part.\n\nIt was the very first scene in the pilot\n\nand when I was done, everybody laughed\n\nand Aaron turned to the network and said,\n\nI told you this scene was funny.\n\nIt was a unwritten rule of show business.\n\nYou do not do a show about politics.\n\nOnly because Aaron wrote such a good script\n\ndid they even consider it and even then,\n\nit sat literally on a desk until Scott Sassa,\n\nthe then-president of NBC, goes,\n\nYeah, I'll give it a shot.\n\nNow, there are 10 political shows on every single network.\n\nRemember that it is not the DNC\n\nbut rather your tax dollars that pay my salary,\n\nso I work for you, whether you voted for us or not.\n\nMy body has no fat to protect itself from disease,\n\nthings happen very quickly.\n\nListen to me, it's very important\n\nthat you replenish my body with electrolytes\n\nafter every involuntary loss of bodily fluids.\n\nOh boy. So there was a notion\n\nthat they were gonna add a character\n\nto 30 Rock, my favorite show ever,\n\nand that I would be a nemesis to Alec.\n\nAnd I don't think it was ever a real conversation\n\nbut it sparked the network saying, I don't know about that\n\nbut would Rob ever consider going on Parks and Recreation?\n\nIt was a total shotgun marriage.\n\nI met Mike Schur, Mike met me,\n\nand it was literally a blind date.\n\nLiterally, see, I said it.\n\nAnd I remember Amy just happened to walk in.\n\nYou know, it was a love fest from the minute, from go.\n\nMike, understandably, didn't know if it was gonna fit\n\nand, frankly, neither did I, so we kind of agreed\n\nthat we would do a six episode trial.\n\nBut, because Amy was pregnant, it was really\n\nthis convoluted schedule where it's really crazy.\n\nWe decided really, really early\n\nthat it was great and we all wanted to do it.\n\nAnd I remember the day that it happened.\n\nWe were doing an episode that's called the Flu Episode\n\nwhere he gets very, very sick\n\nand he looks in the mirror and says, Stop pooping.\n\nAnd that's an ad lib.\n\nAnd when I looked in the mirror and ad libbed that,\n\nI think Mike Schur was like, We're keepin' him.\n\nThat staff was insane.\n\nIt's like the 1927 New York Yankees' Murderers' Row.\n\nEverybody on the show is a steroided\n\nversion of who they actually are.\n\nI do have a little bit of energy and I am kind of optimistic\n\nand I am kind of enthusiastic and they just mainlined it.\n\nSo much so that, season's end of playing Chris, I was like,\n\nI wonder if there's just other layers to Chris.\n\nNope, there's none.\n\nThat Chris could be excited about the most mundane,\n\nboring thing, it just was a well that never ran dry.\n\nBut now, I am infected\n\nwit the killer virus and I feel fine.\n\nTherapy.\n\nNow I've gotta go back home and I don't know\n\nwhat I'm supposed to do with myself.\n\nMaybe you're doing it here.\n\nThe thought of going to Africa\n\nand shooting a movie legitimately\n\nin the wilds of Africa with real wild animals,\n\nthey're not trained, they're not being told what to do.\n\nDo you wanna shoot a movie in Africa?\n\nDon't even need to read it, yes, in.\n\nBecause you know it's gonna be an adventure.\n\nAnd I love Kristin Davis.\n\nFirst of all, she looks exactly the same.\n\nShe's beautiful and is nice and wonderful\n\nand she's just a, just a great person.\n\nIf I didn't have her there,\n\nI don't know what I would've done\n\nbecause it's such a specific life, living in Africa,\n\ngiving your whole life to elephants\n\nand living in a tent and.\n\nUnlike the West Wing, where I've lived part of that life,\n\nthere's no iteration of me that's ever lived that.\n\nShe was invaluable to me.\n\nI'm outdoors almost every minute of every day\n\nthat I can be outdoors, I love being outdoors,\n\nand to be there in that kinda majesty\n\nand to be making a movie there, it was surreal.\n\nAnd it's the kinda things that you know\n\nyou're not gonna get a chance to do\n\nmaybe ever again in your life.\n\nI ran as fast as I could from that dust cloud.\n\n20 years later, it's finally catchin' up to me.\n\n[solemn piano music]\n\nPack your things, we're gettin' outta town.\n\nI remember turning on my TV and seeing this show Nip/Tuck\n\nand seeing this character, Dr. Christian Troy,\n\nand turning to my wife and going,\n\nWhy can't I have a character like that?\n\nThat's what I should be playing.\n\nAnd I had a meeting with Ryan and I told him about\n\nhow much I loved Dr. Christian Troy and he was getting\n\nwhiter and whiter and whiter as I was talking.\n\nAnd I finally said, What's wrong?\n\nHe goes, Don't you know I wrote it for you?\n\nHe wrote it for me and my agents never gave it to me.\n\nSo since that day, we've been trying to\n\nfigure out how to work together.\n\nAnd this is the good news: I've had a show\n\non the air every season since 1999.\n\nFinally, I was available when he wanted to\n\ndo a new iteration of his 9-1-1 franchise.\n\nIt's big, it's massive, it's gritty,\n\nit's a great part, great cast, Liv Tyler.\n\nI feel like I'm part of a big train.\n\nI play a firefighter who's obsessed\n\nwith his hair, his skin care regimen.\n\nThat's such a, like, a Brad Falchuk,\n\nRyan Murphy, Tim Minnear kind of thing.\n\nThey have a weird secret sauce\n\nand it's that kinda bizarre, like, you're not quite sure\n\nhow they actually get away with it.\n\nThat's the brand and they've done it and it's really fun.\n\nHey, go back, go back!\n\n[dramatic music]\n\nI'm grateful that I'm able to do both,\n\nthat I can have shows on the air\n\nthat are out and out comedies, like Parks, and do,\n\nyou know, Lone Star, which is out and out action/drama.\n\nEven the mistakes or the things that\n\ndon't turn out the way, maybe, you want to,\n\ninevitably lead you into something bigger and better.\n\nAnd that's been my experience not only\n\nprofessionally, but personally.\n\nI'm glad because I've always had\n\na sense of purpose about my life.\n\nI'm really fortunate."
