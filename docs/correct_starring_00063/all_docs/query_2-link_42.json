        "text": "Watch: Austin Powers' Dr Evil returns for Super Bowl advert\n\nMike Myers has reprised his much-loved Austin Powers role for a new Super Bowl commercial.\n\nSeth Green (Scott) and Mindy Sterling (Frau Farbissina) are featured as Dr Evil’s sidekicks in the ad for General Motors.\n\nRob Lowe stars as the younger version of Number 2, the character played by Robert Wagner in the series.\n\nRead more: Jay Roach says Austin Powers 4 could 'make people want to go back to the theatre'\n\nThe ad sees Dr Evil taking over General Motors, with climate change and electric vehicles on the agenda.\n\n“Ladies and gentleman, our takeover of General Motors is complete,” he announces.\n\nScott reveals that he’s had a baby boy and Dr Evil declares: “I shall name him… Baby Me!\"\n\nHowever, Scott insists the infant's name is Kyle.\n\nDr Evil then starts bopping around as Scott shouts: “You act like a child!”\n\n“You can’t push my buttons any more!” he shrieks.\n\nMyers played the iconic character in Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery in 1997 and reprised the role in The Spy Who Shagged Me two years later.\n\nHe returned three years later in Austin Powers In Goldmember.\n\nFans were thrilled to see the return of the characters and the advert made many call for another film in the series.\n\nOne fan tweeted: “Oh good lord, this made me so happy. Please let Austin Powers 4 happen.”\n\nRead more:Austin Powers 4 would have told Mini-Me's life story, director reveals\n\n“Not exactly the Austin Powers revival I wanted... But I'll take it!” said another.\n\n“I may be in the minority, but I think it's time for an AUSTIN POWERS 4,” another said.\n\n“I want another Austin Powers movie so bad,” one begged.\n\n“I hope this ad means there’s a new Austin Powers in the works,” said another hopeful fan.\n\nThe ad will air during the Super Bowl on Sunday, 13 February."
