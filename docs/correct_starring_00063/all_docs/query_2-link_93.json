        "text": "By Charlene Badasie |\n\nRob Lowe says that leaving the political drama series, The West Wing was the best decision he ever made. “Whenever I talk to actors who complain about, you know, their relationships on their shows, it happens – it happens in any workplace. You could be in an environment where people sandbag you, want to see you fail, don’t appreciate you, whatever it is,” Lowe told the Podcrushed podcast via Variety.\n\nSharing his thoughts on his West Wing tenure, Rob Lowe explained that he felt undervalued throughout his time on the show.\n\nRob Lowe played White House communications director Sam Seaborn in the acclaimed NBC drama. However, his character was written off the show during its fourth season due to alleged salary disagreements. Sharing his thoughts on his West Wing tenure, Lowe explained that he felt undervalued throughout his time on the show.\n\n“Whenever I share my stories, people are like, ‘I will never share my own stories again,'” Rob Lowe continued. “They would make your hair stand up, and there’s some of them I wrote. I shared some of them in my book, but I purposely didn’t share half of the other ones because it would make the people involved look so bad that I didn’t want to do it to them. So, I did not have a good experience,” he added.\n\n“‘It’s so popular, it’s so amazing, it must be amazing.’ But I know what it’s like, and if I couldn’t walk away from it, then how could I empower my kids to walk away from it? I walked away from the most popular girl at school, but I also knew that it was a super unhealthy relationship, and it was the best thing I ever did.”\n\nRobe Lowe on his decision to walk away from The West Wing\n\nThe actor likened his time on The West Wing to the abusive relationships some of his children endured. Rob Lowe said. “‘She’s the popular girl, everybody likes her, she’s beautiful, it must be great’ – all the things people would say about making The West Wing to me.”\n\n“‘It’s so popular, it’s so amazing, it must be amazing.’ But I know what it’s like, and if I couldn’t walk away from it, then how could I empower my kids to walk away from it?” Rob Lowe added. “I walked away from the most popular girl at school, but I also knew that it was a super unhealthy relationship, and it was the best thing I ever did.”\n\nRob Lowe didn’t share any detailed insights into the behind-the-scenes events of The West Wing. When the actor exited the series in season four, he vaguely stated that it had become evident that there was no longer a suitable spot for Sam Seaborn. He returned to portray the character in two episodes during the show’s final season in 2006 and again in 2020 for a reunion special on HBO.\n\nCreated by Aaron Sorkin, The West Wing originally aired on NBC from 1999 to 2006. The series is set in the fictional White House West Wing and revolves around the lives and work of the staff members of the fictional Democratic administration of President Josiah Bartlet. The show is known for its fast-paced dialogue, witty writing, and engaging characters.\n\nEach episode provided an inside look into the daily operations of the President’s senior staff, including his advisors, speechwriters, communications team, and more. While the series primarily focuses on the political landscape and policy decisions, it also delves into the personal lives and relationships of the characters (like Rob Lowe’s Sam Seaborn), creating a balanced blend of drama and comedy.\n\n“Whenever I share my stories, people are like, ‘I will never share my own stories again.’ They would make your hair stand up, and there’s some of them I wrote. I shared some of them in my book, but I purposely didn’t share half of the other ones because it would make the people involved look so bad that I didn’t want to do it to them. So, I did not have a good experience.”\n\nRob Lowe on his time on The West Wing\n\nThe primary cast featured Martin Sheen as President Josiah “Jed” Bartlet, the President of the United States, a highly intelligent and compassionate leader dealing with the challenges of his office, both political and personal. John Spencer played Leo McGarry, President Bartlet’s Chief of Staff and close friend, who guides and supports the administration.\n\nRob Lowe portrayed Sam Seaborn, initially the Deputy Communications Director; Sam is a speechwriter and policy advisor with a strong sense of idealism. Bradley Whitford played Josh Lyman, the Deputy Chief of Staff and a brilliant strategist known for his sharp wit and dedication to his work. Richard Schiff, Toby Ziegler, Allison Janney, and Janel Moloney also starred.\n\nDespite his terrible experience on The West Wing, Rob Lowe has had a diverse and successful film, television, and theater career. The actor gained prominence in the 1980s as a member of the “Brat Pack,” a group of young actors who appeared in a series of coming-of-age films like The Outsiders, St. Elmo’s Fire, and About Last Night.\n\nAfter The West Wing, Rob Lowe continued working in film and television. He appeared in movies like Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me in 1999, The Invention of Lying in 2009, and Behind the Candelabra in 2013. He also starred in several television movies, series, and miniseries, including Brothers & Sisters, Parks and Recreation, and The Grinder.\n\nIn recent years, Rob Lowe starred in the medical drama series 9-1-1: Lone Star and has remained active in the entertainment industry. Additionally, he is known for his sense of humor and has been involved in comedy and parodies, often appearing in humorous sketches and commercials."
