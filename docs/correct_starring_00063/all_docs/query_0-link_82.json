        "text": "Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery (1997)\n\nC – 89m\n\nAspect Ratio: 2.39:1 – Widescreen (Original) / 2.35:1 – Widescreen (Blu–ray)\n\nA.K.A.: Austin Powers\n\nCo – Writer: Mike Myers\n\nDir.: Jay Roach\n\nStarring: Mike Meyers, Elizabeth Hurley, Michael York, Mimi Rogers, Robert Wagner, Seth Green, Mindy Sterling, Charles Napier, Will Ferrell, Clint Howard, Cindy Margolis, Barbara Ann Moore, Brian George, Burt Bacharach, Tom Arnold, Carrie Fisher, Susanna Hoffs, Richard Joel, Mike Judge, Rob Lowe, Michael McDonald, Christian Slater and Sterling Wolfe.\n\nAfter being cryonically frozen in the 1960’s and released in the 1990’s the swinging 1960’s spy Austin Powers, now paired with his former partner’s daughter, chases his old nemesis Dr. Evil, who was also frozen in the 1960’s and released in the 1990’s. The first Austin Powers film is smart and fresh, despite being another parody of the popular 1960’s spy films. The cast is game and the material is fun. One trivia note: Mike Myers wanted Jim Carrey to play Dr. Evil but Carrey passed due to scheduling conflicts with his own film, Liar Liar (1997).\n\nRated: [PG–13] – Nudity, Sex–Related Dialogue & Humor\n\nOut Of Print on VHS but Available on Blu–ray, DVD & Digital Copy\n\nAustin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999)\n\nC – 95m\n\nAspect Ratio: 2.39:1 – Widescreen (Original) / 2.35:1 – Widescreen (Blu–ray)\n\nA.K.A.: Austin Powers 2: The Spy Who Shagged Me, Austin Powers 2: It’s Shagging Time, The Return Of Dr. Evil, It’s Shagging Time, Austin Powers 2\n\nCo – Writer: Mike Myers\n\nDir.: Jay Roach\n\nStarring: Mike Myers, Heather Graham, Michael York, Robert Wagner, Rob Lowe, Seth Green, Mindy Sterling, Verne Troyer, Elizabeth Hurley, Kevin Cooney, Clint Howard, Jeff Garlin, Jennifer Coolidge, Michael McDonald, Steve Wilkos, Burt Bacharach, Elvis Costello, Will Ferrell, Woody Harrelson, Kristen Johnston, Charles Napier, Willie Nelson, Tim Robbins, Rebecca Romijn, Jerry Springer and Fred Willard.\n\nDr. Evil travels back to 1969 and steals Austin Power’s mojo while Powers is frozen. The current day Powers suffers from it and in turn travels back to 1969 to stop Dr. Evil’s 2nd attempt and world domination; he (Powers) is paired with Felicity Shagwell. Oscar® nominated for Best Makeup. The makeup is impressive and the gags are abundant. Rarely is a sequel better than the original but this is the case here. Almost everything works.\n\nTrivia: It took 7 hour for Mike Myers to get into the Fat Bastard suit and makeup. Reportedly Heather Graham was about to accept an offer to appear in a softcore porn film until she landed the role in this film. Additionally it is reported that she used some of the money she made from this film to buy a copy of the said film that she would have been in. And finally it is reported that Mike Myers partially based Heather Graham’s character, Felicity Shagwell, on the title character in Barbarella (1968).\n\nRated: [PG–13] – Sexual Innuendo & Crude Humor\n\nOut Of Print on VHS but Available on Blu–ray, DVD & Digital Copy\n\nAustin Powers In Goldmember (2002)\n\nC – 94m\n\nAspect Ratio: 2.39:1 – Widescreen (Original) / 2.35:1 – Widescreen (Blu–ray)\n\nA.K.A.: Austin Powers: Never Say Member Again, The Third Installment Of ‘Austin Powers’, The Next Installment Of Austin Powers, Austin Powers: Goldmember, Austin Powers 3, Austinpussy\n\nCo – Writer: Mike Myers\n\nDir.: Jay Roach\n\nStarring: Mike Myers, Beyonce (Knowles), Seth Green, Sir Michael York, Robert Wagner, Mindy Sterling, Verne Troyer, Sir Michael Caine, Fred Savage, Kevin Cooney, Clint Howard, Mandy Moore, Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, Steven Spielberg, Quincy Jones, Britney Spears, Nathan Lane, Katie Couric, Michael McDonald, Ozzy Osbourne, Sharon Osbourne, Kelly Osbourne, Jack Osbourne, John Travolta, Burt Bacharach, Rob Lowe, Will Ferrell and Heather Graham.\n\nDr. Evil teams with 1970’s whack–job Goldmember for world domination and kidnapping Austin’s father. Once again Austin Powers must travel back in time, to stop Dr. Evil, Goldmember and rescue his father. He does so only to learn some long buried truths about his family. The third outing in the series is tired and it shows. The humor appears to be recycled from the first two films but the added laughs of poking fun at Hollywood for music videos and films were / are welcome. The cast is game even if some of the material is subpar. Worth a watch just to complete the series.\n\nTrivia: Heather Graham reprised her role in a scene that was ultimately cut from the film and so did Will Ferrell, this time answering the question he was asked four times. Sir Sean Connery was considered for the role that went to Sir Michael Caine. Sir Michael Caine used his glasses from The Ipcress Files (1965), which Austin Powers’ glasses were modeled after. And finally: Director Jay Roach’s first cut of the film ran three hours.\n\nRated: [PG–13] – Sexual Innuendo, Crude Humor & Langauge\n\nOut Of Print On VHS but Available on Blu–ray, DVD & Digital Copy"
