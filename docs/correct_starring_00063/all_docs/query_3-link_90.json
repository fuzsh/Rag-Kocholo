        "text": "I am not sure if this movie should even be given the honor of being reviewed on this site, but I think there may be some out there who might appreciate the information (i.e. parents of teenagers).\n\nI am a 21 year old female. My boyfriend (26) and I went to see Austin Powers… and walked out after 30 minutes.\n\nThe basis of the movie is that Austin Powers (Mike Myers of “Saturday Night Live”), an English type of James Bond, is battling his enemy, Dr. Evil (also played by Mike Myers). The year is 1967. Dr. Evil is sent into space in a “Big Boy” statue so Austin freezes himself through cyrogenics. In 1997 people learn that Dr. Evil is returning to Earth so they de-thaw Austin. Austin is aquainted with his ex-lover’s (one of MANY) beautiful daughter, who is going to give Austin information on Dr. Evil’s plans. Austin feels it is his quest to get her to have sex with him. In the mean time Dr. Evil learns that Austin is back and is out to get him.\n\nBecause we walked out on this one, I don’t know precisely how the story ends, but I can recommend great caution. From the previews, the movie appears fun/silly, a “no-brainer”—type. Throughout the movie (at least what I saw) EVERY, and I do mean EVERY comment made by Austin is sexual in nature. He refers to himself as the “twig and two berries” (among other things) and an enemy of his is named “Alota Fagina.” This character cannot speak to a woman without strongly “coming on” and inviting her to have sex with him.\n\nThis review is meant as a warning for Christians, especially parents! If you seek to walk by the Word of God and in the paths that Jesus exemplified, avoid this movie. I truly regret going myself."
