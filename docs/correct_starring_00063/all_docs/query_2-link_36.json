        "text": "Highest Rated: 100% Attack of the Hollywood Clichés! (2021)\n\nLowest Rated: 0% Under Pressure (1999)\n\nBirthday: Mar 17, 1964\n\nBirthplace: Charlottesville, Virginia, USA\n\nOne of the better-known survivors of teen stardom, actor Rob Lowe managed to put his heartthrob status behind him. Lowe made his initial impact in teen-oriented movies, flashing his toothpaste commercial smile and essaying a sort of untrustworthy charm in \"The Outsiders\" (1983) and \"St. Elmo's Fire\" (1985). Lowe later laid the groundwork for a dramatic career with a number of well-received cable TV movies before enjoying consistent critical and popular success on the Emmy darling \"The West Wing\" (NBC, 1999-2006). Lowe made some memorable comedic appearances in \"Wayne's World\" (1992), and in the Golden Globe-nominated \"Thank You For Smoking\" (2006), though his steadiest work continued to be primetime roles in \"Brothers & Sisters\" (ABC, 2006-11), TV movies and miniseries that generally cast him as an earnest hero battling inner, or in the case of his Stephen King offerings, outer demons.\n\nHighest rated movies\n\n94% Behind the Candelabra\n\n93% A West Wing Special to Benefit When We All Vote\n\n86% Thank You for Smoking\n\n79% Wayne's World\n\n71% The Hotel New Hampshire\n\n70% The Outsiders\n\n68% Salem's Lot\n\n68% Contact\n\nPhotos\n\nRob Lowe Rob Lowe at arrivals for THE GRINDER and GRANDFATHERED at the 2015 Paleyfest Fall TV Previews for FOX, The Paley Center for Media, Beverly Hills, CA September 15, 2015.
