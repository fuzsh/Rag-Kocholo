Feel free to add any popular Austin Powers characters missing from the list.\n\nMost divisive: Foxxy Cleopatra\n\nOver 3.2K Ranker voters have come together to rank this list of The Best Characters In The Austin Power Movies, Ranked\n\nFilm : International Man of Mystery, The Spy Who Shagged Me, Goldmember\n\nDr. Evil is a fictional character, played by Mike Myers in the Austin Powers film series. He is the antagonist of the movies, and Austin Powers' nemesis. He is a parody of James Bond villains, primarily Donald Pleasence's Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Dr. Evil routinely hatches schemes to terrorize and take over the world, and is typically accompanied by Number-two: an eye-patch wearing goon who fronts his evil corporation Virtucon Industries, his cat Mr. Bigglesworth and his sidekick Mini-Me, a dwarf clone of himself. Myers revived the character for a brief appearance on the December 20, 2014 episode of Saturday Night Live, a show on which Myers previously had a regular role.\n\nFilm : International Man of Mystery, The Spy Who Shagged Me, Goldmember\n\nSir Augustine Danger \"Austin\" Powers, KBE, is a fictional character from the Austin Powers series of films, and is created and portrayed by Mike Myers. He is the protagonist of Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, The Spy Who Shagged Me and Austin Powers in Goldmember. He is a womanizing, hard-partying British spy embodying the Swinging London mod culture and hippie culture of the 1960s who, with his nemesis Dr. Evil, was frozen in a cryogenics experiment. The series' humor follows his attempts to adjust to the modern world as he continues to try to save it from terrorism.\n\nFilm : The Spy Who Shagged Me, Goldmember\n\nMini-Me is a character played by Verne Troyer in the second and third Austin Powers movies: Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and Austin Powers in Goldmember.\n\nFilm : International Man of Mystery, The Spy Who Shagged Me, Goldmember\n\nScott Evil is a fictional character from the Austin Powers series of films. He is played by Seth Green. Scott Evil is the biological son of Dr. Evil and Frau Farbissina. He was conceived in 1969 after Dr. Evil obtained and used some of Austin Powers' mojo and returned via time-travel to have a one-night stand with Farbissina. During childhood, Scott was told that he was artificially conceived in a laboratory.\n\nFilm : The Spy Who Shagged Me, Goldmember\n\nFat Bastard is a fictional character in the second and third films of the Austin Powers series. A morbidly obese henchman hailing from Scotland, Fat Bastard serves Dr. Evil in his quest to defeat Austin Powers. The character is portrayed by Mike Myers. His extreme size endows Fat Bastard with massive strength. He exhibited this prowess in the sumo ring in Goldmember. Fat Bastard is noted for his foul temper, his emotional monologues that end with flatulence, his vulgar manners, and his unusual diet. These go as far as to include a cannibalistic taste for human infants and dwarves, whom he gluttonously calls, \"The other, other white meat\". In Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, he boasts that he once ate a baby, and tries to refuse Dr. Evil's money for his services in exchange for getting to eat Mini-Me. He also has the same Scottish accent as Shrek, whose eponymous film was released two years later in 2001. Mike Myers has jokingly said that it took about 64 hours to transform into Fat Bastard's body.\n\nFilm : International Man of Mystery, The Spy Who Shagged Me, Goldmember\n\nFrau Farbissina is a fictional character from the Austin Powers series of movies portrayed by Mindy Sterling. She is the attack and defence specialist of Dr. Evil and the founder of \"the militant wing of the Salvation Army\". Though in the present she identifies as a lesbian, Farbissina conceived her son Scott with Dr. Evil earlier in her career."
