        "text": "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me\n\n4 Stars (Out of 4)\n\nReviewed by Mac Verstandig on June 9, 1999\n\nhttp://www.moviereviews.org\n\ncri...@moviereviews.org\n\nRelease date in USA - June 11, 1999\n\nHilarious, entertaining, sexy and perhaps even shagadellic, Austin\n\nPowers: The Spy Who Shagged Me is the type of\n\nfall-out-of-your-seat-laughing comedy that only comes around on the\n\nrarest of occasions. With acting so uproariously funny, and a script\n\nthat delivers punch line after punch line at a pace so rapid that you\n\nmiss most of the movie while trying to stop laughing, Austin Powers is\n\nthe comic convention of 1999.\n\nA sequel in the truest of ways, the latest adventures of Austin Powers\n\nfollow those of his in the 1997 hit, Austin Powers: International Man of\n\nMystery. Dr. Evil (Mike Myers in one of three boisterously entertaining\n\nperformances in this film) is back on earth in 1999 despite his previous\n\nventure into space at the conclusion of the 1997 movie, and more evil\n\nthan ever. He plans on taking over the earth and ridding it of his\n\nenemy, Austin Powers (Mike Myers). In order to do this he must travel\n\nfrom his new space headquarters, a Starbucks shop, in 1999 back to 1969\n\nand steal Austin Powers' mojo. Considering this seems to be a movie\n\nspoofing Star Wars heavily, it is assumed that this mojo is the\n\nequivalent of the \"the force\" and can be easily withdrawn from a frozen\n\nbody. Understanding that leads to the obvious point that a total and\n\nutter suspension of reality is essential.\n\nDr. Evil has yet another problem to deal with, as his son, Scott Evil\n\n(Seth Green), is upset with him for doing what he does. This leads to a\n\nwonderful spoof on the times, as the two meet again on the Jerry\n\nSpringer Show. Just infuriating Scott further, Dr. Evil has been cloned\n\nas well. The result is what he refers to as Mini-me, an exact replica,\n\nbut only 1/8 his size. To Dr. Evil the clone is like the son he always\n\nwanted and never had. After all, as the first movie showed, there is\n\nnothing like a good father son conflict to bring laughs to the screen.\n\nThis is an absolute truth as the characters continuously try to out-hip\n\neach other, while Dr. Evil complains that Scott is only \"The Diet Coke\n\nof Evil.\"\n\nWhen you have a spy as sexy as Austin Powers himself, the women\n\nnaturally follow. In this installment, we meet Felicity Shagwell\n\n(Heather Graham), Ivana Humpalot (Kristen Johnson of TV's 3rd Rock from\n\nthe Sun), Robin Swallows (Gia Carides) and a few other shagable young\n\nwomen. The basic plot outline of their roles is that all of them are\n\nworking for Dr. Evil, save Felicity who is a secret agent.\n\nAdditionally, this production is full of cameos from some most notable\n\nnames. Burt Bacharach, Elvis Costello, Will Ferrell, Woody Harrelson,\n\nWillie Nelson, Tim Robbins and Jerry Springer all poke into the film at\n\nsome point, with most of them just delivering one of the countless penis\n\njokes as themselves. Mike Myers also takes on a third role, of a more\n\ncameo like nature.\n\nWhat really brings the humor to Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me\n\nare the spoofs on every day things that people can relate to, and\n\nclassic movies that have always begged to be lampooned in this fashion.\n\nEven the trailers for this film suggested that \"If you can only see one\n\nmovie this summer, see85Star Wars: Episode One\" as the film immediately =\n\nadapts to being released in the wake of the sure hit from Lucas. So the\n\nsolution chosen was to tease the force to nth degree, even beginning\n\nthis film with yellow text scrolling up the screen, with an outer-space\n\nbackground. Additionally, there are the obvious connections to James\n\nBond which would be the central focus of the film if it was a plot\n\nconcentrated work instead of a witty collection of humor. And just to\n\ntop it off there is a moment just slightly modified from John Watters'\n\ncult classic, Pink Flamingos, involving the consumption of human waist.\n\nMike Myers may well be doing these movies because his talent is limited\n\nelsewhere. Despite moderate success as Wayne in Wayne's World, and an\n\naward worthy performance in 54, the actor has been wise enough to limit\n\nhis work after the 1993 flop, So I Married An Axe Murderer. Regardless,\n\nhe is perfect for these roles probably due in large part to his writing\n\ncredit on the film as well. Heather Graham is the ideal counterpart to\n\nMyers, bringing the presence of an actress capable of delivering the\n\njokes and body humor just as well as anyone else, with a sexual appeal\n\nthat makes her the Bond Girl of Austin Powers. This is never better\n\nshown than a scene which pits her in bed with an obese character simply\n\nknown as Fat Bastard (Myers' third role). The two of them light up the\n\nscreen and make an otherwise totally disgusting, uncalled-for scene into\n\na funny and just mildly nauseating one that sticks with you for a long\n\ntime.\n\nMike Myers has created a comic gem. Spoofing everything in sight,\n\nholding nothing back, and running monologues of nothing but penis humor,\n\nAustin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me is the year's most refreshing\n\ncomedy. Further enlightened by great character acting and distinguished\n\ncameos, the film will make you hope for and anticipate a future\n\ninstallment. Needless to say, this certainly isn't the Diet Coke of\n\nmovies.\n\nSmashing, Baby!\n\nAustin scores again\n\nby Wallace Baine\n\nFilm writer\n\nSanta Cruz Sentinel\n\nThis summer, Austin Powers may pass Elvis Presley as the world’s record\n\nholder for Most Bad Impersonations Inspired. The next time you have to\n\nendure a woeful “You’re shagedelic, Baby!” on an answering machine, you’re\n\nfree to hate him for it.\n\nBut let’s be mature about this, shall we? Let’s learn to separate the\n\nmessiah from the fools who invoke his name. “Austin Powers: The Spy Who\n\nShagged Me,” the second big-screen adventure of the horse-teethed Carnaby\n\nStreet clown, is a howling good time, no matter how grating you may find\n\nthe promotional hype. However poorly Mike Myers’s nutty creation comes off\n\non TV or magazine covers, the movie is a kaleidoscope of madcap brilliance\n\nwhere the star is not Austin, but Austin’s insanely conceived world.\n\n“The Spy Who Shagged Me” is fundamentally a cascade of gags, many of them\n\npuerile and delightfully disgusting and the rest saucy send-ups of\n\npop-culture clichés. In the long history of “Saturday Night Live” alums\n\nelevated to movie-star status, Myers is, in fact, one of the few (the\n\nonly?) still doing “SNL”-style schtick, deftly adapting it to the\n\nfeature-film format and brazenly appealing to his audience’s smarts and its\n\nweakness for a well-executed poop joke.\n\nPlaying three of the film’s central characters and having co-written the\n\nscript with “SNL” pal Michael McCullers, Myers is in full control of the\n\nAustin Powers persona. With the help of fun-loving director Jay Roach (who\n\ndirected the original “Austin Powers”), Myers creates a set that captures\n\nthe lightning-in-a-bottle feel of inspired improvised comedy. The result is\n\nan endless parade of sight gags, in-jokes, dopey sexual humor and wildly\n\ndepraved -- but never over-the-top -- satire. For every joke that doesn’t\n\nquite gel, there are four or five gems and one or two that are\n\nwet-your-pants funny. That makes for a pretty good batting average.\n\nWhen we last left Austin, he had landed the beautiful and highly shaggable\n\nVanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley). The new film opens with the couple’s\n\nhoneymoon which, for reasons best left under wraps, ends up with Austin a\n\nsuddenly single swinger again. In no time, however, the International Man\n\nof Mystery is in the clutches of another stunning babe.\n\nCIA agent Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham, in a star-making turn) -- the\n\nkind of gun-toting, Jaguar-driving, miniskirt-wearing sex kitten that only\n\nexists in the imaginations of 16-year-olds with extensive Playboy\n\ncollections -- pops up to help Austin battle the notorious Dr. Evil (Myers\n\nagain). The bald and effete Dr. Evil (who we first meet on the set of the\n\nJerry Springer Show) hires a monstrously obese Scotsman named Fat Bastard\n\n(Myers yet again) to travel back in time to 1969 to extract Austin’s “mojo”\n\nwhile Austin is cryogenically frozen. As a result, Austin tragically loses\n\nhis libido at the moment of passion with a vamping Russian fashion model\n\nnamed (ha, ha) Ivana Humpalot (Kristen Johnston of “Third Rock from the\n\nSun”).\n\nTo recover the lead in his pencil, Austin himself goes back to 1969 and\n\nthere is a great sense of infectious fun in Austin’s scenes at the center\n\nof London’s swingin’ go-go scene, where he in fact he meets foxy Felicity,\n\nwho almost immediately also wants a piece of Austin’s power.\n\nCuriously, Austin Powers is not the catalyst for the movie’s best humor.\n\nThat honor belongs to the persnickety, pinkie-kissing Dr. Evil, a cackling\n\nbad guy with world-domination fantasies who has to deal with some\n\nhilariously contemporary problems: a disaffected teenage son and the\n\nawkwardness of a sudden sexual encounter with a co-worker. Disappointed by\n\nhis sarcastic slacker son Scott, Evil creates a companion in his own\n\nlikeness, a dwarf with the same bald head, gray suit and black heart he\n\ntouchingly christens Mini-Me (Verne Troyer). Scott hates the little guy,\n\nFat Bastard wants to eat him, but he brings out devoted love from the mad\n\nscientist who is taken to blurting out to his Mini-Me things like “You\n\ncomplete me” (smile, you “Jerry Maguire” fans).\n\nAs a piece of short-attention-span comedy, “The Spy Who Shagged Me” pays\n\nattention to detail. The delights comes in diverse forms from unexpected\n\ncameos from the likes of Elvis Costello, Tim Robbins, Woody Harrelson and\n\nBurt Bacharach (a veteran of the first movie) to pointed spoofs of rap\n\nvideos to the casting of Rob Lowe as villanous, one-eyed Robert Wagner’s\n\nyounger self to a series of deliciously dumb gags revolving around the\n\nsynonyms for the male organ (high-brow it ain’t). The main satirical\n\nscaffolding is, of course, the James Bond series. Bond fans will recognize\n\na number of sly references to Bond films but 007 is only one of dozens of\n\ncultural allusions that will reward inveterate TV, pop music and movie\n\nhounds. Even product placement, skewered so well in Myers’s pre-Austin hit\n\n“Wayne’s World,” gets zinged. Starbucks, for instance, must have mixed\n\nfeelings that one of its franchises serves as Dr. Evil’s world-domination\n\nheadquarters.\n\nUnlike another, much-hyped summer blockbuster (you hear me talking, Jar\n\nJar?), “The Spy Who Shagged Me” lives up to its billing. It’s less a\n\ncohesive story that a series of set pieces, each explosive in comic\n\npotential. To take one example, the scene of Myers as Fat Bastard, cocooned\n\nin realistic-looking latex fat lying naked in bed drooling and eating\n\nchicken while the lovely Felicity looks on in acute disgust is the kind of\n\npungency that makes this movie such a devilish treat. By mixing arch\n\npop-cult references with goofy, sexy fun and tossing in a handful of\n\nexpertly drawn bodily-function vulgarities, Mike Myers has created a movie\n\nvalentine to the under-30 crowd. Bow to Austin Powers, for he is the\n\nlearned Doctor of Scatology. Smashing, baby. Simply smashing.\n\nAUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME\n\nA film review by Steve Rhodes\n\nCopyright 1999 Steve Rhodes\n\nRATING (0 TO ****): ***\n\n\"Do you smoke after sex?\" the voluptuous Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth\n\nHurley) asks her new husband, Austin Powers (Mike Myers). \"I don't\n\nknow,\" he replies with his boyish grin. \"I've never looked.\"\n\nYes, that \"International Man of Mystery\" is back. This time, in AUSTIN\n\nPOWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME, he goes back to England in the Swinging\n\nSixties to recover his mojo. Can't be a world-famous playboy if your\n\nmojo is not working. Even a huge clump of chest hair two inches thick\n\nisn't enough to wow the women if your mojo is missing.\n\nIn a hilarious opening sequence, Austin discovers that his television\n\nremote control, including the fast forward, mute and alternate language\n\nselection buttons, command his new wife. Once again Myers, who shares\n\nthe writing credits with Michael McCullers, has clearly put enormous\n\nthought and effort into the design of every sight gag and every snippet\n\nof dialog in the movie.\n\nThe first AUSTIN POWERS film was a bit too cluttered and hurried, as if\n\nMyers wanted to pack it with every joke imaginable. This second one\n\ngoes down a bit easier since it is the more relaxed and good-natured of\n\nthe two. This time Myers seems more confident of his abilities so he\n\ngives his picture more room to breathe.\n\nThe good-spirited movie has great fun ripping off a host of other\n\npictures, especially Bond films. The names of the characters, à la\n\nBond, are a particularly enjoyable source of mirth. A Russian sexpot\n\nnamed Ivana Humpalot (Kristen Johnston) engages Austin in an erotic game\n\nof chess. Another character's name is Robin Swallows, but her maiden\n\nname was Spits. You can probably guess where the writers go with that.\n\nFull of self-deprecating humor, the movie is never happier than when it\n\nis making fun of itself. One drive, supposedly in England but clearly\n\nfilmed in the hills above Los Angeles, has a sign proclaiming \"English\n\nCountryside.\" Austin remarks that Southern California doesn't look\n\nanything at all like England.\n\nAnd if you're tired of all those ridiculously blatant product\n\nplacements, the movie parodies the most hyped company in the movies\n\ntoday, Starbucks. One of the scenes, spoofing a typical council chamber\n\nscene from STAR WARS, is set in a huge space needle with a hundred-foot\n\nhigh Starbucks sign on the outside.\n\nThe plot has Austin's nemesis, Dr. Evil, going back to 1969 to steal\n\nAustin's mojo, which renders him powerless in the present. Austin goes\n\nback to recover his mojo. The plot is actually more complicated than\n\nthis, and Austin makes fun of its logical flaws.\n\nMyers also plays Dr. Evil, as well as a couple of other hard to spot\n\nroles. Dr. Evil clones himself into a miniature version of himself\n\ncalled Mini-Me (Verne Troyer). At one-eighth Dr. Evil's size and\n\nlooking and acting exactly like him, Mini-Me is treated as a cross\n\nbetween a loyal dog and a favorite son.\n\nIn the present, Robert Wagner repeats his role as Number 2. In the\n\npast, Rob Lowe gives a dead-on performance as the Young Number 2. Lowe,\n\nin an uncanny performance, looks and acts so much like Wagner that one\n\ncould be convinced that they were father and son in real life.\n\nThe best part of the casting is the addition of Heather Graham (BOOGIE\n\nNIGHTS) as CIA operative Felicity Shagwell. As Austin's fellow spy, she\n\nprovides a playfulness and an innocence that lightens up the story,\n\nwhich has a tendency to go too much over the top. The sexual chemistry\n\nbetween the two leads is delicious and genuine. (Without giving too\n\nmuch away, let's just say that Austin spends most of the picture as a\n\nbachelor.)\n\nThe dialog has little gems of wit. After a one-night fling, Dr. Evil\n\nexpresses some regret the next morning. \"I can't let my feelings for\n\nyou interfere with my taking over the world,\" he admonishes his\n\nparamour. Other lines make little sense but Myers delivers them so\n\nconfidently, they work anyway. (\"He's the snake to my mongoose,\" Dr.\n\nEvil says of Austin, and then admits that it might be the other way\n\naround.)\n\nSome of the best bits in the film are visual. Austin and Heather are\n\nshown in silhouette inside a tent. She appears to be doing unspeakable\n\nthings to his body. The camera periodically cuts to the inside of the\n\ntent so we can see that nothing unnatural is happening. Even knowing\n\nhow the joke is performed doesn't diminish its humor or keep you from\n\nsquirming as you watch.\n\nWith energetic music, including such old favorites as \"American Woman,\"\n\nand with intricately planned comedy, this latest AUSTIN POWERS should\n\ndelight the fans of the original as well as attract new ones. This time\n\nthe sequel is better than its predecessor.\n\nAUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME runs 1:33. It is rated PG-13 for\n\nsexual innuendo and crude humor and would be fine for kids around 11 or\n\n12 and up.\n\nEmail: Steve....@InternetReviews.com\n\nWeb: http://www.InternetReviews.com\n\nby Curtis Edmonds -- blue...@hsbr.org\n\nI walked into the second Austin Powers movie prepared to write a scathingly\n\nbad review. I was ready to deploy my army of poison pens -- er, make that\n\npoison pixels -- in opposition to the overwhelming, shattering avalanche of\n\nstupidity I knew to be coming. I entered the theater totally prepared for\n\na never-ending cycle of potty jokes, sniggering references to body parts,\n\nand gags drawn out far enough past their normal life expectancy to make an\n\nactuary cry. And I wasn't a bit disappointed.\n\nMost people who liked the first Austin Powers movie won't be disappointed,\n\neither. Mike Myers dons the geeky glasses, the dead-weasel hairpiece, the\n\nhorribly bad bridgework, the fake chestal hair, the frilly lace cravat and\n\nthe velvet suit to duel Dr. Evil and save the world yet again. Along the\n\nway -- and this is the sort of movie where \"along the way\" matters more\n\nthan anything else -- Austin mugs, grimaces, shags, cavorts around naked,\n\nand generally acts annoying. Alternatively, the movie presents Myers as\n\nDr. Evil, who combines the worst features of Ernst Blofeld and Ed Sullivan.\n\nI am not inclined to argue with people who think these characters are\n\nfunny, and will merely state that this sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.\n\nIf the Powers and Evil characters share one trait, it is their mammoth,\n\ngargantuan narcissism. The real battle in The Spy Who Shagged Me isn't\n\nbetween the forces of evil and good, it's between Myers's ego and his\n\ngenerosity. This movie could easily have been a Mike Myers extravaganza of\n\nself love, with all other comic possibilities squeezed out. Fortunately,\n\nthough, the forces of good make some inroads here that weren't made in\n\nAustin Powers: International Man of Mystery. The Spy Who Shagged Me is a\n\nbetter movie because Myers is a little more willing to share the wealth and\n\nspread out the good lines more evenly. This allows the focus to be taken\n\noff the Powers/Evil duality occasionally and allows a little bit of genuine\n\nhumor to sneak in now and then.\n\nConsider the treatment of the female leads in both movies. Elizabeth\n\nHurley was perfectly cast as Austin's sidechick in the first movie (she's\n\nthe perfect casting choice for every movie she's ever been in) but the\n\nspotlight wasn't really ever on Our Liz. Hurley shows up momentarily in\n\nThe Spy Who Shagged Me and is generously given one of the truly funny lines\n\nin the movie -- not much, but one more than she had before.\n\nIn comparison, the lovely Heather Graham as CIA agent Felicity Shagwell\n\nredeems the entire movie. In a movie season replete with special effects,\n\nthe sight of Heather Graham in a micro-miniskirt is still the best piece of\n\neye candy around. Felicity is smart, dangerous, absolutely ravishing, and\n\nhas a way with the sexy one liner. \"You're light on your feet,\" Austin\n\nraves as they dance. \"I'm pretty light off my feet, too,\" says the\n\nshagadelic Felicity, in a tone calculated to make a man's knees turn to\n\njelly. This is Heather Graham's happening, baby, and it's groovy, man.\n\nSeth Green had a marginal part in the first movie as Scott Evil, but he\n\nstole the show with his criticism of his old man's megalomaniacal ways.\n\nGreen gets a little more time to shine here, imparting a little bit of\n\nGeneration X common sense to the Sixties silliness. There's still too\n\nstrong of a strain of whiny brat in his performance, but he's got the\n\nadolescent sneer down pat. When Dr. Evil dubs his newest plan to destroy\n\nthe world \"The Alan Parsons Project\", Green is there to poke wicked fun; \"I\n\ncan't wait for Project Bananarama.\"\n\nUnfortunately, the wealth isn't shared all that equally. Rob Lowe, who was\n\nso good in Wayne's World, is well-cast as a young Robert Wagner but gets\n\nlittle to do. (One wishes that Wayne Campbell would make a cameo\n\nappearance, if only to remind us how babelicious Heather Graham is.)\n\nKristen Johnson disappears in the second reel, which is too bad -- she's\n\ngot the Natasha Fatale accent down pat.\n\nI thought The Spy Who Shagged Me was quite a bit funnier than the\n\noriginal. Most of the comedy takes place below the waist, but now and\n\nagain there's a funny bit that provides a respite from the onslaught of\n\nbathroom and sex jokes. It's still not that great, though. (The biggest\n\nreaction I heard from the audience was when Austin's own Willie Nelson\n\nshowed up in a cameo.) Your inner fifteen-year-old will be happy to see\n\nsee The Spy Who Shagged Me, but those looking for more sophisticated humor\n\nshould stay away and avoid further disappointment.\n\n--\n\nCurtis D.

Then you see what happens.\"\n\n-- Napoleon Bonaparte\n\nAUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME\n\nRATING: 7 / 10 --> Good movie\n\nFor more reviews and movie trivia, visit http://www.joblo.com/\n\nOkay, so I was a little distracted by the fact that I had Jacques\n\nVilleneuve, Formula I race car driver, snuggling up to his better half a few\n\nrows behind me in the theatre, but once the groovy tunes sounded off, the\n\ncolorful characters jumped on-screen and Austin Powers blasted into his\n\nall-familiar mojo fever, there was no denying that the 60s were back, and\n\nthis shagadelic sequel had begun!\n\nPLOT:\n\nDr. Evil time-travels back to the 1960s to steal Austin Powers' mojo (His\n\nessence, his aura, his libido, if you will). With the absence of his horny\n\nspirit, Austin loses focus and must also return to the 60s in order to\n\nregain his essence.\n\nCRITIQUE:\n\nClever, witty, enjoyable, fun and almost as fresh and original as the first\n\none, save for a few redundancies which didn't click and Heather Graham who\n\nwas not as interesting as Elizabeth Hurley in the original (although her\n\noutfits are simply smashing!), this movie will definitely satisfy all\n\nAustin/Dr. Evil lovers and guarantee a solid box-office summer for Myers and\n\ncrew. This movie starts off with a bang, as the first 20 minutes deliver\n\nsome of the film's funnier moments (The whole Jerry Springer sequence\n\ncracked me up). It also seemed as though they put more emphasis on the Dr.\n\nEvil character in this follow-up, which was all fine with me, cause I\n\npersonally found him to be more entertaining than Austin in the first place.\n\nNevertheless, kudos go out to Mike Myers once more for pulling off plenty of\n\nsmart one-liners, movie homages galore, and tossing a couple of new\n\ncharacters into the mix. Mini-me, a midget Dr. Evil, seemed to be the\n\nbiggest crowd pleaser, and the Fat Bastard (Myers under 80 pounds of latex\n\nfat), who I could've done without, save for one hilarious scene in bed with\n\na female spy.\n\nA couple of other things which didn't truly delight me were the Austin\n\nPowers dancing segues between scenes, which seem forced and self-indulgent,\n\nand the song and dance numbers in the film, which appeared to be nothing\n\nmore than time-fillers. But on the whole, this movie is funny and will have\n\nyou cracking up at Dr. Evil's father/son silly banter, Mini-me's fight with\n\nAustin, the multitude of sexual overtures delivered by Austin, and the\n\noverall enthusiasm of the entire ride down the 60s free-wheeling, all-loving\n\nshagfest. Folks who did not enjoy the first film, will undoubtedly scoff at\n\nthis sequel, which plot-wise, does even less than its predecessor. But for\n\nall of you who enjoyed the first movie for what is was, a goofy, original,\n\nover-the-top spy parody, chances are that you will most certainly enjoy the\n\nbulk of this film, with its re-occurring characters (and jokes, at times),\n\nMyers' fantastic performance as Evil and Powers, its fun loving,\n\nself-deprecating attitude, and all the kitchy goodness that you could stuff\n\ninside of ninety minutes of groovy cinema. Now does that make you horny?\n\nLittle Known Facts about this film and its stars:\n\nCameos galore in this one as well (Don't read further, if you don't want to\n\nknow who they are). Tim Robbins plays the President of the United States of\n\nAmerica, Woody Harrelson shows up as, well, a character named Woody, and\n\nKristen Johnston plays some husky Russian babe, Ivanna Humpalot. Clint\n\nHoward, Ron Howard's brother, also returns as the radar operator. Burt\n\nBacharach, Elvis Costello, Willie Nelson, Rebecca Romjin-Stamos and Jerry\n\nSpringer also show up as themselves.\n\nThe actor playing Mini-me is named Verne Troyer. He is 32 inches tall. You\n\nmay remember him as the tiny Santa Claus on top of Arnold Schwarzenegger in\n\n1996's JINGLE ALL THE WAY.\n\nMike Myers claims that nearly 40% of the dialogue in this film was\n\nimprovised on the spot, and that he has agreed to do up to five Austin\n\nPowers films in all. Even King Hussein of Jordan was a huge Austin Powers\n\nfan according to Myers, and watched the tape when he was ill at the Mayo\n\nClinic.\n\nThe original AUSTIN POWERS film became Billboard's No.1-selling video in its\n\ncategory in 1998, and has been there ever since (as of June 9, 1999...64\n\nweeks and counting).\n\nJames Bond film references: (Entertainment Weekly#489) The title is a direct\n\nrip-off of THE SPY WHO LOVED ME. When Austin and Felicity hit the beach in\n\nbikinis, it's a reference to Ursula Andress in DR.NO. The new volcanic lair\n\nof Dr. Evil is from YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE (Just as Dr. Evil is patterned after\n\nTWICE's Blofeld character). The music for the sequel is very CASINO ROYALE,\n\nand there's a bit of GOLDFINGER in the scene where Austin sees an assassin\n\nbehind him in the reflection of his glasses. There are also plenty of other\n\nfilm references tossed in and around, such as INDEPENDENCE DAY, JERRY\n\nMAGUIRE, THE EXORCIST, STAR WARS, THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR, and many more\n\nwhich I just can't seem to remember at this time.\n\nThis film was originally titled IT'S SHAGGING TIME and THE RETURN OF DR.\n\nEVIL.\n\nIn the U.S., \"shag\" is far less offensive than in other English-speaking\n\ncountries. Singapore briefly forced a title change to THE SPY WHO SHIOKED ME\n\n(\"Shioked\" means \"treated nicely.\").\n\nReview Date: June 9, 1999\n\nDirector: Jay Roach\n\nWriters: Mike Myers and Michael McCullers\n\nProducers: Mike Myers, Demi Moore, John Lyons\n\nJennifer Todd and Suzanne Todd\n\nActors: Mike Myers as Austin Powers/Dr. Evil/Fat\n\nBastard\n\nHeather Graham as Felicity Shagwell\n\nGenre: Comedy\n\nYear of Release: 1999\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nJoBlo's Movie Emporium\n\nhttp://www.joblo.com\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n(c) 1999 Berge Garabedian\n\nAUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME\n\nReviewed by Jamie Peck\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRating: ***1/2 (out of ****)\n\nNew Line / 1:34 / 1999 / PG-13 (constant sex/bathroom humor, language,\n\ncomic violence, pseudo-nudity)\n\nCast: Mike Myers; Heather Graham; Robert Wagner; Michael York; Mindy\n\nSterling; Seth Green; Verne Troyer; Rob Lowe\n\nDirector: Jay Roach\n\nScreenplay: Mike Myers; Michael McCullers\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA sequel to a movie that wasn't a very big hit to begin with isn't an\n\nespecially encouraging idea -- unless, of course, it's \"Austin Powers: The\n\nSpy Who Shagged Me.\" This second helping of bawdy business from\n\nstar/writer Mike Myers successfully begins to stack a franchise on top of\n\nthe 1997 original, which was basically a base send-up of British cinema,\n\nthe James Bond series in particular. \"Spy\" has greater ambitions and makes\n\ngood on them, sticking it to the aforementioned target while\n\nsimultaneously leaving no pop-culture stone unturned. In the first 10\n\nminutes alone, Myers lampoons 007 themes, \"Star Wars\" screen-crawls and\n\nEsther Williams' underwater ballets -- and they mostly click, in-season or\n\nnot.\n\nThis inspired silliness carries into and throughout the entire film, which\n\nfinds '60s nemeses Austin Powers (Myers), the swinging sleuth with a\n\nghastly Shirley Partridge-'do and ghastlier Nehru jackets, and Dr. Evil\n\n(Myers again), the wicked mastermind with a kooky affinity for his\n\nhairless kitty and kookier plans for world domination, again clashing in\n\nthe '90s. Evil's nonsensical schemes involve using time-travel to steal\n\nPowers' mojo (or, for those not in the know, his libido), though in the\n\nfunnier self-referential bits, Myers and Co. draw attention to plot holes\n\nand suggest that overlooking them is in full enjoyment's best interest.\n\nBut do people really care if the story adds up? Far more pressing matters\n\ninvolve whether or not Myers, both as scribe and performer, is at his\n\ncheekiest. The answer -- a strong \"don't worry\" -- comes long before he\n\ndebuts yet a third role, that of a slobbering, Scottish Dr. Evil henchman\n\ncalled Fat Bastard. Giving life to this loathsome brute enables Myers to\n\nnot only hide under what looks like a ton of latex, it permits the kind of\n\nkilts-and-haggis humor he mined so effectively in \"So I Married an Axe\n\nMurderer.\" He'd be guilty of spotlight-hogging were he not so dead-on in\n\nall three parts, each of which could probably occupy their own farce\n\nalone.\n\nLike Myers' hats, the film fuses cast members old and new. Showing up from\n\nthe former \"Austin\" are familiar favorites such as Number Two (Robert\n\nWagner), Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling) and Scott Evil (Seth Green).\n\nMisunderstood Scott, the bad Dr.'s son, partakes in clashes with dad that\n\nare utterly priceless, leading the elder Evil to instead play\n\nfather-figure to his 28-inch-tall clone (Verne Troyer), a malevolent\n\nmunchkin he affectionately dubs Mini-Me. This \"Island of Dr.\n\nMoreau\"-inspired character gets used and abused frequently, reaffirming\n\nhow \"Spy\" shuns political-correctness in its search for a quick giggle\n\nfix. But the jokes are never offensive, even if they spend a majority of\n\nthe time in and around the toilet.\n\nAs with all spoofs, misfires occur -- how not original to cut to an\n\nerupting volcano following suggested sexual activity -- and every single\n\npunchline doesn't quite hit a home run; \"The Spy Who Shagged Me\" has a\n\ntendency to drag a few shenanigans out to the point of overkill, though\n\nthat's less of a stumbling block here than it was for its predecessor\n\n(remember the interminable urination bit?). One area done better by the\n\nprevious installment, however, would be the female lead: Elizabeth Hurley\n\nbrought her an appealing mix of sensuality and sportsmanship. Hurley gets\n\nexplained away in a nifty prologue, thus opening the door for Heather\n\nGraham, who looks fetching in mesh but seems out-of-sync with the groovy\n\ngoings-on.\n\nNo matter. With Myers, Mini-Me and more delightfully gag-worthy gags than\n\n\"There's Something About Mary\" -- a naughty shadow show and a coffee\n\npitcher full of feces blow low and lower -- these flaws hardly register.\n\n\"Austin\" 1 did about $50 million at the box-office and then found an\n\naudience of avid devotees upon its video release. With those folks now\n\nfoaming at the mouth over the prospect of future films, \"Austin\" 2 is\n\npractically guaranteed to destroy the notion of diminishing returns. In\n\nfact, from the wit, love and craft on display here, another \"Austin\"\n\nadventure promises to generate the same solid hype and eager anticipation.\n\n\"Goldswinger,\" anyone?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1999 Jamie Peck\n\nE-mail: jpe...@gl.umbc.edu\n\nVisit The Reel Deal Online: http://www.gl.umbc.edu/~jpeck1/\n\nThis review is available online:\n\nhttp://www.gl.umbc.edu/~jpeck1/films/austinpowers2.html\n\n\"Upon hearing word of this outrage, Star Wars' creator George Lucas (in\n\nthe throes of developing scripts for the two remaining Star Wars' films)\n\nquickly removed all references to an upcoming character allegedly named\n\nStingy MacHaggis, a kilt-wearing alien who was to spend a good portion of\n\nEpisode II' drinking, picking fights and playing an alien musical\n\ninstrument that strongly resembled a set of bagpipes.

Austin Powers 2, the sequel to the sleeper hit of 1997, is\n\nfilled to the brim with uproarious sight gags and lurid toilet jokes\n\nthat will make you keel over with hilarity. The mind of Mike Myers is\n\nobviously a very bizarre place.\n\nMyers returns as the swinging 60’s spy and his arch-nemesis, the bald\n\nheaded Dr. Evil, who is given much of the spotlight here. There’s an\n\nearly scene in which Dr. Evil and his son Scott (Seth Green) appear on a\n\nJerry Springer segment entitled “My Dad is Evil and Wants to Take Over\n\nthe World”, hosted by Springer himself. Most of these talk-show gags,\n\nspoofing everything from Oprah to Regis and Kathie Lee, are no longer as\n\nfunny as they once were. Happily, this is an exception, especially when\n\na fight breaks out between Dr. Evil and the other guests. (Sample\n\ndialogue- “Come back here you mother #@%$^!! You want a piece of me?”)\n\nThe audience was in stitches.\n\nThere are many good things about this sequel. Dr. Evil is now assisted\n\nby Mini-Me (Verne Troyer), a pint-sized clone who is the result of an\n\nexperiment gone awry. Mini-Me is the most perfect new character that any\n\nfan could ask for, and Troyer does a terrific job of mimicking\n\neverything that his big brother does, pinkie and all. Mindy Sterling\n\nreturns as Frau Farbissina, Evil’s loud-mouth assassin sidekick, and\n\nhere we are treated to a brief romantic liaison between the two in an\n\nunderground bedroom chamber. This works surprisingly well. Afterward,\n\nthere’s even a meeting at the coffee machine, where their awkwardness is\n\nexpressed in a scene you would expect in any normal office environment.\n\nOh, yes... the plot. After a short honeymoon with Vanessa Kensington\n\n(Elizabeth Hurley) that goes disastrously wrong, Powers is back on the\n\ncase to thwart the diabolical plans of Dr. Evil. In the original, the\n\nsubject of the day was cryogenic freezing that enabled the characters to\n\nhop between two time periods. Here, it’s time travel. Dr. Evil has this\n\ncrazy plan to steal Austin’s mojo (the source of his sexual powers), so\n\nhe jumps through a time portal back into 1969 when Powers is still is\n\nhis freezing chamber. There, he employs a grotesque 600-pound Scottish\n\nassassin named Fat Bastard (also Myers) to commandeer the mojo, so that\n\nour future hero is left completely shagless.\n\nMeanwhile, Austin is informed of Evil’s wrong-doing by Basil Exposition\n\n(Michael York), and is supplied with his very own time-traveling device\n\nin the form of a Volkswagen Beetle. Once back in 1969, Powers meets a\n\nfoxy CIA operative named Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham), and learns\n\nof Dr. Evil’s plans to destroy Washington DC with a lazer on the moon.\n\nIn one of the many uproarious jabs at Star Wars, Evil calls the moon\n\nbase a “Death Star”. If there ever was a movie that knew from the start\n\nit was a complete joke, it’s Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.\n\nAP2 has many hilarious moments, much more so, than the original Austin\n\nPowers. But what it doesn’t have is the confident support system that\n\nthe first boasted, and the jokes are now more scattershot and\n\nhit-and-miss. While Myers has a knack for delivering clever, inspired\n\ngags, he sometimes doesn’t know when to call it quits. The hilarious\n\nscene in the original involving Mustafa (Will Ferrell) and his refusal\n\nto die is played out here in a disappointing and tired manner. Robert\n\nWagner, as Dr. Evil’s #2 man, has only one scene early on in the film,\n\nwhere he lacks all the focus of the character. One nice surprise is Rob\n\nLowe, as the young #2, who patterns Wagner’s voice and movements right\n\ndown to a tee.\n\nThere are more recycled jokes from the predecessor, including Kristen\n\nJohnston as Ivana Humpalot (an unfunny rendition of Alotta Fagina). But\n\nMyers has clearly put so much dedication into this project, and many\n\nbits are side-splittingly funny. Don’t miss an extended visual gag in a\n\ntent, where the shadows leave much to the imagination....\n\nOf the new characters, Graham doesn’t leave much of an impression. Her\n\nperformance is merely okay, and she lacks the gung-ho enthusiasm that\n\nmade Elizabeth Hurley so enjoyable before her. And as for Fat Bastard...\n\nwell, he provides one or two hilarious moments, but all of the obesity\n\njokes and bathroom talk go too far.\n\nBut my most severe complaint: Mr. Bigglesworth was only in one scene!!\n\nBut, with gritted teeth, I managed to get over that. This sequel will\n\nnot leave fans disappointed; it’s more often than not a laugh riot. And,\n\nI look optimistically to the future, where I foresee more installments\n\nto the Austin Powers collection. If Myers can up the quota of fresh\n\nideas, we should be in store for much more.\n\n(C) 1999, Jamey Hughton\n\n........................\n\nJamey Hughton (15) has written a weekly column in The StarPhoenix,\n\nSaskatoon, Sk since November, 1997.\n\nHe was a 1999 Writing Finalist in the Canadian YTV Achievement Awards.\n\nOriginal Austin Powers Review\n\n( You'll need your 'Shades')\n\nand More\n\nMOVIE VIEWS at:\n\nhttp://welcome.to/movieviews\n\nContact Jamey also at: movie...@hotmail.com\n\n..........................\n\nAustin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me\n\nA film review by Marty Mapes\n\nCopyright 1999 Marty Mapes\n\n*** (out of 4) Austin fans, THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME is funnier and better\n\nthan the first movie!\n\nActually, I should say that I found the first movie to be mediocre. The\n\nconcept was good and some jokes and scenes worked great, but the film\n\nitself fell apart because of all the dry spells between gags. Those\n\nspells were filled with observations on the late sixties, slavishly\n\nworked-in spy movie references, and plot.\n\nThis one is much funnier because it borrows the successful elements from\n\nthe first and shuns what didn't work. That means more jokes, lower-brow\n\nhumor, more of that handsome Dr. Evil, and less plot. Mike Myers wrote\n\nthe first film, and this time he was joined by newcomer Michael\n\nMcCullers. Together, they seem to have worked out the kinks.\n\nThe film opens with Austin Powers (Mike Myers) leading the easy life\n\nwith his wife Vanessa (Elizabeth Hurley) now that the evil Dr. Evil\n\n(Mike Myers) has been vanquished. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Powers, Dr.\n\nEvil has been thawing and plotting his revenge. Dr. Evil acquires a time\n\nmachine and goes back in time to steal Austin Powers' mojo.\n\nLater, when Austin Powers... ahh, to heck with the plot summary. You\n\nwill not care about, much less notice, the plot. There is just enough to\n\nkeep the action moving and the jokes rolling in, and that's all that\n\nmatters, isn't it?\n\nA comedy that makes me laugh out loud comes along once, maybe twice a\n\nyear, and SHAGGED is one of them. The near-nudity gags from the original\n\nare repeated and expanded upon, and a new verbal gag using synonyms for\n\n\"penis\" is introduced (told you it was low-brow). Actually, both had my\n\naudience (okay, I admit, me too) laughing out loud. If there is a third\n\nAustin Powers movies, you can bet both gags will resurface.\n\nMost importantly, Dr. Evil gets a lot more screen time than in the first\n\nmovie. He steals the show as he works out his paternal feelings both for\n\nhis son (Seth Green) and for his 1/8 size clone, Mini-Me (Verne Troyer).\n\nDr. Evil and Mini-Me get the biggest, best-deserved laughs.\n\nI would certainly recommend this movie (especially if you have an\n\nadolescent streak in you). As with most comedies, I would also recommend\n\nseeing it in a big crowd. The fuller the theater, the funnier the jokes.\n\nBut a few tell-tale signs indicate that it may not be destined for the\n\nnext AFI top 100 list.\n\nFirst is the caliber of the jokes. A few too many are grossout jokes.\n\nMyers plays a third character, Fat Bastard, an agent of Dr. Evil's.\n\nMyers wears a fat suit like the one made for Eddie Murphy in THE NUTTY\n\nPROFESSOR. Naturally, since this is a comedy, we find out entirely too\n\nmuch about Bastard's digestive system. As repulsed as I was, I have to\n\nadmit I laughed. But I don't know if I'll be renting this movie when I\n\nhave polite company over.\n\nSecond is the repetition of the jokes. Many of the funniest gags are\n\nrepeated. Luckily, the latest round is always just a little funnier than\n\nthe first round, but really, they're the same gag, and if you didn't\n\nlike it the first time, you'll just hate it the second time.\n\nAnd finally, there are some references to Star Wars that play very well\n\nright now because we are swamped by \"Phantom Menace\" pool toys and\n\ngalactic-mint Star Wars toothpaste. But in time, the Star Wars jokes\n\nwon't be quite so biting as they are now. Comedy that relies on parody\n\nand reference (like a lot of Zucker Brothers movies) is extremely chancy\n\nand very dated.\n\nBased on these points, I would recommend seeing SHAGGED sooner rather\n\nthan later. I think the longer the movie has been around, the less funny\n\nit will seem.\n\nNow don't get me wrong. I'm not panning SHAGGED. I actually had a lot of\n\nfun. But I do feel it's necessary to temper my praise with a dose of\n\nreality.\n\nBut having hedged my review, let me close by saying that AUSTIN POWER:\n\nTHE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME is a very funny movie, and is one of the few\n\nsequels to surpass its predecessor.\n\nCheck out more current movie reviews at http://www.moviehabit.com\n\n--\n\nMarty Mapes\n\nmma...@moviehabit.com\n\nMovie Habit\n\nhttp://www.moviehabit.com\n\n_Austin_Powers:_The_Spy_Who_Shagged_Me_ (PG-13) ** 1/2 (out of ****)\n\n_Austin_Powers_ is one pop culture phenomenon that has flown clear over\n\nmy head. The shagadelic spy's first screen outing, 1997's\n\n_International_Man_of_Mystery_--whose box office grosses topped out at\n\njust north of $50 million, yet became a sensation on video--was\n\ndefinitely a likable, high-energy affair, but for me, that wasn't enough\n\nto redeem a script whose hit-and-miss stabs at humor were more amusingly\n\nsilly than genuinely hilarious. The bigger, though not necessarily\n\nbetter, sequel, _The_Spy_Who_Shagged_Me_, doesn't pretend to be anything\n\nmore than it is--more of the same. Whether or not that's a good thing,\n\nhowever, depends on who you are: fans of the original are indeed likely\n\nto find this installment to be groovy (as did the rowdy fans at my\n\nscreening), but for me, it was another scattershot adventure with a few\n\ngood chuckles but not quite as funny as it believes it is--or should be.\n\nOne of the key problems I had with the original film was that about\n\nthree-quarters of the way through, the schtick of Austin Powers (Mike\n\nMyers) was exhausted. He's a defrosted British secret agent still stuck\n\nin the swinging '60s who is perpetually up for a shag and believes\n\nhimself to be irresistibly sexy. That's it. By the time he performed\n\nhis climactic striptease to \"I Touch Myself,\" I wasn't laughing but\n\nsilently grinning, if even that.\n\nAfter _The_Spy_Who_Shagged_Me_ gets past a brief prologue that writes\n\noff the love interest of the previous film, Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth\n\nHurley), the film dives headlong into an elaborate credit sequence:\n\nAustin prances through a hotel in the buff (with strategically placed\n\nprops, natch), culminating in an Esther Williams-style aquatic production\n\nnumber. Once this is all over, Austin is, to borrow one of his catch\n\nphrases, \"spent\"--creatively speaking. It's not so much that Myers,\n\nco-writer Michael McCullers, and returning director Jay Roach do nothing\n\nnew with Austin in terms of story (again, he must thwart the\n\nmagalomaniacal Dr. Evil, who has travelled back in time to 1969 to steal\n\nAustin's \"mojo\") than in terms of his thin character. Austin's \"Yeah,\n\nbaby!\" one-liners, retro wardrobe, bad teeth, and swinging attitude--all\n\nmined for their entire worth and then some in\n\n_International_Man_of_Mystery_--haven't gotten better, just older. Even\n\nthe diehards in the audience got bored; after Austin's umpteenth scene\n\ntransition dance number, one once-howling fan was overheard saying, \"That\n\nwas stupid.\"\n\nFor me, Austin's archnemesis, the idiotic, hopelessly square, but no\n\nless dastardly Dr. Evil (also played by Myers) was always more\n\ninteresting. Surprisingly, _The_Spy_Who_Shagged_Me_ focuses more on him\n\nthan it does Austin, and the film benefits from that fact. Unlike their\n\nlaissez-faire treatment of Austin, Myers and company have actually taken\n\nDr. Evil in a fresh direction. In the first film, Dr. Evil's antiquated\n\n'60s sensibilities clashed with those of the '90s; in this one, the\n\nopposite is the case, with his new pseudo-hip, ultra '90s mentality a\n\njarring anachronism in 1969. It sounds less than inspired in concept,\n\nbut in execuation it fuels the film's best moments, most of which involve\n\nhis new midget clone Mini-Me (Verne J. Troyer), whom a doting Dr. Evil\n\nprefers to his black sheep biological son Scott (Seth Green, also\n\nreturning).\n\nThe rest of the film is a study in give and take. Heather Graham cuts a\n\nshagadelic figure as Austin's new sidekick/love interest, CIA agent\n\nFelicity Shagwell, but Hurley's icy hauteur in the first film made for a\n\nmore effective foil. As enjoyable as the bulk of Mini-Me's antics are,\n\nhis knock-down, drag-out fight with Austin is a less effective retread of\n\nthe MTV Movie Award-winning Ben Stiller-Puffy the Dog confrontation in\n\n_There's_Something_About_Mary_. Rob Lowe does an even better Robert\n\nWagner than Wagner himself as the '60s incarnation of Dr. Evil's yes-man\n\nNumber Two (Wagner also briefly reprises his role as the '90s Number\n\nTwo), but he is underutilized.\n\nAs with the original film, my just-OK assessment of\n\n_Austin_Powers:_The_Spy_Who_Shagged_Me_ is sure to be in the minority,\n\nand the film's certain success will cement _Austin_Powers_ as a New Line\n\nfranchise. And as lukewarm as my take on these first two films are, I'd\n\nwelcome a third--that is, if there can somehow be an _Austin_Powers_ film\n\nwithout Austin himself.\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\nMichael Dequina\n\nmrb...@iname.com | michael...@geocities.com\n\nMr. Brown's Movie Site: http://welcome.to/mrbrown\n\nCompuServe Hollywood Hotline: http://www.HollywoodHotline.com\n\n__________________________________________________________\n\n___________________________________________________________________\n\nGet the Internet just the way you want it.\n\nFree software, free e-mail, and free Internet access for a month!\n\nTry Juno Web: http://dl.www.juno.com/dynoget/tagj.\n\nAUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME\n\nA film review by David N. Butterworth\n\nCopyright 1999 David N. Butterworth\n\n**1/2 (out of ****)\n\nAustin Powers has lost his mojo all right. And so, unfortunately,\n\nhas Mike Myers.\n\nIn this much-anticipated follow-up to 1997's \"Austin Powers:\n\nInternational Man of Mystery,\" Myers and his co-conspirators have missed a\n\nwonderful opportunity to improve upon the original film and given us\n\ninstead a wildly uneven romp which misses about twice as much as it hits.\n\nThe dark forces in \"Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me\" draw\n\nconsistently bigger laughs than the swinging secret agent and his latest\n\nshag-pad material, CIA operative Felicity Shagwell (a stunningly awful\n\nHeather Graham).\n\nDr. Evil (Myers) is back, hysterically so, as is his right-hand\n\nwoman, the Rosa Klebb-styled Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling, still having\n\na blast). They're joined by Dr. Evil's delinquent son (Seth Green, also\n\nterrific) and an obese Scot with the catchy moniker of Fat Bastard. Played\n\nby Myers under what seems to be three metric tonnes of makeup and\n\nprosthetics, Fat Bastard is a repulsive cross between Monty Python's Mr.\n\nCreosote (from \"The Meaning of Life\") and Charlie MacKenzie's father in \"So\n\nI Married an Axe Murderer.\" Myers has the accent down perfectly and his\n\nFat Bastard is a welcome, if gross, addition to the film's eccentric roster\n\nof villains.\n\nAlso in tow in \"The Spy Who Shagged Me\" is a one-eighth-the-size\n\nversion of Dr. Evil. \"I shall call him <pinkie to the lower lip> Mini Me.\"\n\nMini Me (played by Verne Troyer) is another brainstorm; too bad they\n\ncouldn't have come up with a kitten-sized version of Mr. Bigglesworth. And\n\nlast but not least there's Rob Lowe as the young Number Two, who does a\n\nbetter Robert Wagner than Robert Wagner.\n\nWhenever the bad guys are on screen, especially Dr. Evil, the film\n\nis a hoot. One of the film's funniest lines comes when Dr. Evil is going\n\nthrough his \"zip it\" routine with his son Scott. But the writers don't do\n\nanything with Austin except to land him with the great-looking but\n\nhopelessly-afloat Graham. A brief but satisfying appearance by the\n\noriginal film's Elizabeth Hurley only reinforces just how bad Graham is.\n\nAustin flashes his bad teeth and growls \"groovy baby, yeah!\" but\n\nhis character is becoming very repetitive and Myers himself doesn't seem to\n\nknow how to extend his creation. So the film settles for a lot of\n\nunwelcome bathroom and bodily orifice humor. And I mean a lot. Austin\n\nPowers accidentally mistaking a stool sample for coffee? Felicity\n\n\"retrieving\" things from Austin on all-fours in silhouette? You have to\n\nbelieve that Myers and his co-writer Michael McCullers can do better, much\n\nbetter, than that.\n\n\"Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me\" has some terrific sight\n\ngags, several outrageously funny product placements, a bunch of inspired\n\ncameo performances (Burt Bacharach and Elvis Costello *not* included), a\n\ncleverly-edited sequence in which various people comment on the phallic\n\nnature of Dr. Evil's spaceship, and a wonderful throng of evildoers who ham\n\nit up at every possible opportunity.\n\nBut for those of us who expect a little more from the extremely\n\ntalented Mike Myers, the psychedelic love machine in his Carnaby Street\n\nduds is--at least for the time being--all shagged out.\n\n--\n\nDavid N.

Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged\n\nme is the sequel to the 1997 smash comedy Austin Powers: International Man of\n\nMystery. Many are skeptical about sequels, saying that the sequel is never\n\nbetter or as good as the original, but Austin Powers: TSWSM goes beyond the\n\nfirst film.\n\nAustin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me stars Mike Myers in three different\n\nroles. He reprises his role as the title character, Austin Powers, the\n\nshagadelic spy whose body was frozen in 1967, and unfrozen in 1997 to stop his\n\nlong time nemesis Dr. Evil, also played by Mike Myers, from destroying the\n\nearth. TSWSM leaves off where the original stopped, with Dr. Evil's 詮risch's\n\nBig Boy' space capsule floating through space. Dr. Evil returns back to earth\n\nby ejecting from his capsule, plotting to go back in his time machine to the\n\nyear 1967, in which he plans to steal Austin Powers' \"mojo\", what keeps Austin\n\ngoing with spy talents. Upon his return to his secret lair, which is now a\n\nStarbucks coffee shop, Dr. Evil learns that his evil henchman, which includes\n\nthe returning Robert Wagner as Number 2 and Mindy Sterling as Frau, have\n\ncreated a 1/8 size clone of Dr. Evil, which is later named Mini Me. The evil\n\nMini Me replaces Scott Evil, played by Seth Green, as Dr. Evil's son in the\n\nmadman's mind, because Dr. Evil thinks of Scott to be only \"quasi-evil.\" Dr.\n\nEvil has always wanted a son that is evil just like him, and now he has one.\n\nDr. Evil tells Mini Me, \"You complete me,\" in a loving manner. Dr. Evil\n\nloving? Wow! Mike Myers' third role is as Fat Bastard, a Scottish henchman of\n\nDr. Evil's, who is sent to steal the mojo from Austin Powers' frozen body.\n\nAustin Powers learns of Dr. Evil's trip back into the 60s, and uses his own\n\ntime machine to take him back to 1967, to try to save his mojo before Fat\n\nBastard gets a hold of it. Once arriving in the year 1967, Austin travels to\n\nhis \"pad\", his smashing home/dance club, where he meets Felicity Shagwell,\n\nplayed by Heather Graham, a CIA Agent who is willing to help him in his journey\n\nto stop Dr. Evil.\n\nAs the film progresses, hilarious one liners are thrown at us, mainly by Dr.\n\nEvil, for example, \"Don't go there, girlfriend!\" to the President of the United\n\nStates. Many witty gags take place, note the entire tent scene, and just\n\nplain, funny scenes which are so stupid- they're funny come a dozen per fifteen\n\nminutes. Take for example, Scott Evil going on The Jerry Springer Show\n\ncomplaining about how evil his father is. The way Austin Powers: TSWSM uses\n\nits humor is clever, throwing a hilarious scene at you, followed by five\n\nminutes of one liners, followed by another outrageous scene, so you never stop\n\nlaughing. There was honestly not one moment in Austin Powers: TSWSM where I\n\nwasn't laughing. The last film that I laughed so hard in, was well, Austin\n\nPowers! It is apparent that Mike Myers knew how funny this film was while\n\nwriting it. The film even makes fun of itself in a line, something along the\n\nlines of, \"It's funny how England and southern California look nothing alike.\"\n\nTSWSM was filmed in southern California, but was supposed to take place in\n\nEngland. I can tell you one thing- He is having a lot of fun with this\n\nenormously popular character, which is all over television, newspapers,\n\nmagazines, and the movie theaters.\n\nI believe that Dr. Evil got more attention in the TSWSM than Austin Powers did.\n\nDr. Evil provided more laughs, more memorable moments, and more interesting\n\ndialogue than Austin did this time around, who seems to missing the funny touch\n\nthat he had in the first film. I felt that Austin really did have his mojo\n\ntaken away, but from screenplay writer Mike Myers, not Fat Bastard.\n\nAlso making a great addition to the series is Mini Me, who is played by Verne\n\nTroyer. Even though the midget actor is 30 years old, he is adorable by Dr.\n\nEvil's side constantly.\n\nThe first Austin Powers film had barely any sentimental quality, such as lack\n\nof character development, barely any detailed plot characteristics, and barely\n\nany good acting, but Austin Powers TSWSM actually shows some quality behind the\n\nfrequent humor. Mike Myers, with his three roles, acts as Eddie Murphy did in\n\nThe Nutty Professor, disguising himself completely in one of the roles. (Fat\n\nBastard) All three characters are different, and Mike Myers does do a good job\n\nhandling each one of them. Heather Graham made a great addition with her\n\ntalent to TSWSM, and does a much better job than Elizabeth Hurley did, who gave\n\na very flat performance in the original, speaking her lines without any feeling\n\nor emotion. Speaking of Hurley, she can be seen in TSWSM for a few brief\n\nmoments. Hopefully, Graham tags along for future Austin Powers adventures.\n\nThe Bottom Line- A groovy sequel that Mike Myers put all of his mojo into\n\nwriting.\n\nAustin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999)\n\nReviewed by Eugene Novikov\n\nhttp://www.ultimate-movie.com\n\nMember: Online Film Critics Society\n\n***1/2 out of four\n\n\"Whereever we go... There we are.\"\n\nStarring Mike Meyers, Heather Graham, Seth Green, Verne Troyer. Rated\n\nPG-13 (but should be R).\n\nWhen a someone journeys to the theater to see a comedy, he always risks\n\nhaving to sit through inanity such as what we recently saw in films like\n\nEDtv and Office Space. It really is too bad that comedies are so hit-\n\nand-miss, because when a moviegoer goes in a theater expecting to be\n\namused, it really is a shame when the alleged comedy fails to deliver.\n\nBut weep not, dear readers, because the latest comedy out of the\n\nHollywood movie mill is nothing less than a sure bet. Austin Powers: The\n\nSpy Who Shagged Me is one of the funniest things I've had the pleasure\n\nto see in a long time; a completely looney, delightful parody of the\n\noften pretentious James Bond flicks. If all comedies (or even half; or -\n\n- what am I saying? -- even a fifth of them) could be this consistently\n\nhysterical, I would take up residence at my local multiplex.\n\nEven more to this movie's credit is the fact that it is a sequel to the\n\n1997 sleeper/cult hit Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery. The\n\noriginal came out of nowhere; it was a low-budget, eccentric movie that\n\nmany expected to flop like a Leslie Nielsen parody. All of a sudden it\n\nwas being quoted by teenagers all over America. Ironically, Powers'\n\n\"Yeeeeah baby, yeah!\" has almost become an icon of the late 90s.\n\nThus another installment was inevitable, but it's also undoubtedly\n\nwelcome. The Spy Who Shagged Me is one of the most unrestrained, over-\n\nthe-top comedies I have ever seen in my entire life. It brings back most\n\nof the characters from its predecessor (even if only briefly) and adds\n\nnew ones. Austin Powers (Mike Myers), a swinging hipster from the 60s\n\ntransported into the 90s has to go back to his own time to get back his\n\nmojo (oh, you'll figure it out), which Dr. Evil (Meyers again) has\n\nstolen. He enlists the help of a gorgeous secret agent Felicity Shagwell\n\n(now that his prior sidekick Vanessa has been properly disposed of in a\n\nhilarious opening sequence), played without much distinguishable gusto\n\nby Heather Graham and together they go back to the 60s to defeat Dr.\n\nEvil yet again.\n\nSurprisingly, the real star is Dr. Evil rather than Austin. He gets most\n\nof the screen time because he was so popular in the first movie. Perhaps\n\nthis is true because he is portrayed and written so affectionately.\n\nInstead of being the scheming, villainous mad scientist we might expect\n\nfrom a character like this he is a bumbling, often sweet mad scientist\n\nwannabe.\n\nThe Spy Who Shagged Me has much of the same stuff we saw in the\n\noriginal, but that's okay by me because the original left us wanting\n\nmore. By the time that one was over we haven't had nearly our share of\n\nshag jokes, crude puns and Powers' antics and this sequel satisfies our\n\nappetites. Even by its conclusions, I'm still not sure I've had my fill\n\nof bits like \"Do you smoke after sex?\" \"I don't know, baby, I never\n\nlooked.\"\n\nThis may seem awfully immature of me, but understand that the Austin\n\nPowers series, unlike most of the crap Hollywood feeds us these days, is\n\ngenuinely funny. I don't know if I've ever laughed harder at any movie\n\nthan I did during the Jerry Springer send up or the indubitably\n\nhilarious \"Just the Two of Us\" rendition by Dr. Evil and his new\n\nminiature clone named \"Mini-me\".\n\nI don't have any pretensions that this is particularly smart social\n\nsatire or anything of the sort. Indeed there is little beyond the joy a\n\nviewer feels when he sees something that is able to entertain him as\n\nmuch as this movie did. But as far as I'm concerned, that is enough.\n\n©1999 Eugene Novikov\n\n&#137;\n\nSent via Deja.com http://www.deja.com/\n\nShare what you know. Learn what you don't.\n\nAustin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999) 2 stars out of 4. Starring\n\nMike Myers, Mike Myers, Mike Myers, Heather Graham and Michael York.\n\nAustin Powers is back, bad teeth, elephantine libido and all. And like in\n\nthe original, Mike Myers has stretched a one-joke premise to the breaking\n\npoint.\n\n\"Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me\" is more of a series of sketches\n\nand shtick, rather than a cohesive, follow-the-plot feature.\n\nI mean, how can it be anything else considering Myers' free-flow imagination.\n\nNo, what \"The Spy Who Shagged Me\" is really is a Valentine to the 1960s\n\nand the spy melodramas that proliferated during that era. The super-stud,\n\nsuper-agents such as Bond and Flint who could kill a man with one hand\n\nwhile caressing a woman with the other.\n\nThose who loved the first Austin Powers movie will undoubtedly enjoy this\n\nsequel, which is basically more of the same. Those who felt the original\n\nmovie was stupid and childish are advised that they are taking their\n\nchances here.\n\nFor like the original, the humor in \"The Spy Who Shagged Me\" is that kind\n\nof juvenile, smuttiness, double-entendre jokiness we all thought was so\n\ncool in junior high school.\n\nThe premise of \"The Spy Who Shagged Me\" is quite simple. Austin Powers'\n\nnemesis, Dr. Evil (also Myers), travels back to 1969 and steals Powers'\n\nmojo - his libidinous life force. The theft doesn't seem to incapacitate\n\nour hero, or even slow him down. It merely keeps him from bedding luscious\n\nCIA agent Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham), while Dr. Evil tries to carry\n\nout his nefarious plan to extort millions from the nations of the world.\n\nThe movie does have some funny bits: Dr. Evil trying to reconcile with his\n\nestranged son, Scott, on \"The Jerry Springer Show\"; a romantic sidewalk\n\ninterlude during which Austin and Felicity dance to \"I'll Never Fall in\n\nLove Again,\" as played by Burt Bacharach and sung by Elvis Costello; and\n\nmost of all two very well-edited sequences in which people around the world\n\nsee Dr. Evil's spaceship - which has a very distinctive shape - and\n\ncontinually use phallic euphemisms and slang to call attention to it.\n\nGraham is deliciously funny as Shagwell, entering the spirit of the\n\nenterprise with a twinkle in her eyes and a smile on her lips.\n\nMyers, of course, is becoming a master at the knowing nod, the mischievous\n\npause that lets the audience know that he, too, is in on the joke, whether\n\nhe is portraying Austin Powers or Dr. Evil.\n\nHowever most of the tomfoolery that comes between the sequences seems like\n\nempty filler.\n\nEven the introduction of some new characters, including Mini-Me, a\n\ndiminutive double of Dr. Evil, and Fat Bastard, a one-ton slovenly killer\n\nScot, also portrayed by Myers, cannot cover the cracks in silly going-ons.\n\nMyers and co-screenwriter Michael McCullers constantly walk the edge of\n\nbad taste, but skirt it with a wink and a smile.\n\n\"The Spy Who Shagged Me,\" honestly, is a movie no one in their right mind\n\ncan take seriously. It is a spoof, a parody, but its flaw is that it\n\ncontinually meanders around trying to cram in too many affectionate riffs\n\nabout the 1960s.\n\nA little more discipline and a lot less scatology and sex jokes would have\n\nmade for a better - and funnier - picture.\n\nBob Bloom is the film critic at the Journal and Courier in Lafayette, IN.\n\nHe can be reached by e-mail at bl...@journal-courier.com or at\n\ncbl...@iquest.net\n\nAustin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me * * (out of * * * * )\n\nDirected by Jay Roach.\n\nCast: Mike Myers, Heather Graham, Michael York, Mindy Sterling, Seth Green,\n\nVerne J.

Now we have \"Austin\n\nPowers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,\" which will be sure to go down as one of the\n\nfew sequels to do better financially than its predecessor (if the sold-out\n\ncrowd I saw it with is any indication). The terms, \"Yeah, baby, yeah!\" and\n\n\"let's shag, baby,\" have been ingrained in most moviegoers' minds due to the\n\noriginal, and when was the last time a movie created its own vernacular, and\n\naudiences followed?\n\nGetting off to a brisk, but disappointing start, this film continues where\n\nthe first left off, with Austin Powers (Mike Myers) and Vanessa Kensington\n\n(Elizabeth Hurley) on their romantic honeymoon. Within five minutes time, it\n\nis discovered that Vanessa was a dreaded fembot all along, a henchman of Dr\n\nEvil's (Myers). Realizing he's a single man again, Austin doesn't take too\n\nmuch time grieving before he learns that Dr. Evil has created a time machine,\n\ngone back to 1969 when Austin was cryogenically frozen, and stolen his\n\n\"mojo.\" In hot pursuit, Austin time travels back to the swingin' '60s\n\nhimself, meets up with beautiful and \"randy\" CIA agent Felicity Shagwell\n\n(Heather Graham), and together they set out to get his \"mojo\" back. But\n\nthat's not all, as Dr. Evil also is plotting to destroy Washington, D.C. if\n\nhis demands (several billion dollars) aren't met.\n\n\"Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me\" has, thankfully, created the same\n\natmosphere that the mildly successful first one set up. From the first frame\n\nto the last, it is apparent that we've stepped back into the world of Austin\n\nPowers, but that doesn't mean that the new movie is as good, and it isn't.\n\nFor one thing, the whole prologue is a gigantic betrayal of both Austin\n\nPowers fans and Elizabeth Hurley. Making her turn out to be a fembot will,\n\nfrom now on, seriously put a damper on the way people watch the original,\n\nbecause now we know that she didn't even actually care about him at all, but\n\nwas on the \"evil side.\" It also creates a noticably large plot hole: If\n\nVanessa Kensington was a fembot, then her mother, Mrs. Kensington (played by\n\nMimi Rogers in the original), also had to have been, and this little fact is\n\nnot dealt with at all in the uneven screenplay, by Mike Myers and Michael\n\nMcCullers. If Hurley didn't want to appear for more than a brief cameo, the\n\nfilmmakers surely could have thought of a stronger way for her to go out.\n\nJust watching \"Austin Powers\" right before I saw its sequel, I noticed\n\nanother downfall. While the first one was not hilarious, it was light,\n\ncharming, and occasionally funny. In \"The Spy Who Shagged Me,\" there might be\n\nsome bigger laughs (the sure-to-be-classic \"tent scene\" comes to mind), but\n\nthere are also just as many jokes that fall astoundingly flat, and others\n\nthat are merely recycled. The film has opted for the\n\n\"everything-but-the-kitchen-sink\" approach, and in doing so, has forgotten\n\nabout all of the returning characters who, in essence, are nothing more than\n\nextended cameos. Seth Green, as Dr. Evil's misunderstood son, Scott, comes\n\nclose to breaking out into his own person (especially when he appears on a\n\nJerry Springer episode, entitled \"My Father is Evil and Wants to Take Over\n\nthe World\"), but there is no payoff. Robert Wagner, as another of Dr. Evil's\n\nhenchmen, Number 2, has all of one scene, until Dr. Evil goes back in time\n\nand the role is taken over by the younger Rob Lowe (who does a killer\n\nimpression of Wagner). Mindy Sterling has a few nice moments as assistant\n\nFrau Farbissina who, midway through, has a steamy affair with Dr. Evil, and\n\nlater shares an uncomfortable moment with him by the coffee machine.\n\nThe new characters are a memorable, if underused, bunch. Taking over the\n\nromantic interest role from Hurley, Heather Graham is energetic and has\n\nproven to be a fine actress (see 1997's \"Boogie Nights\" or 1989's \"Drugstore\n\nCowboy\" for proof), but here doesn't get to stretch her acting muscles, and\n\nher relationship with Austin feels a little more forced than that of Vanessa\n\nand he. The bright spot in the film is Mini Me (Verne J. Troyer), a clone of\n\nDr. Evil, only 1/8 his size. Troyer is often hysterical and even cute, and\n\nhis relationship with Dr. Evil is actually a sweet one. Going for a \"Nutty\n\nProfessor\"/Eddie Murphy type of deal, Myers has given himself a third role,\n\nas Fat Bastard, a repugnant Scot who weighs a \"metric ton\" and, at one point,\n\nhas a disgusting roll in the hay with one of the female characters. In the\n\nwasted department are the two femme fatales, Ivana Humpalot (Kristen\n\nJohnston) and Robin \"maiden-name's-Spits\" Swallows (Gia Carides), who show\n\nup, do their thang, and quickly disappear.\n\nOf course, in the forefront of the whole operation is Mike Myers, who is\n\ncomic dynamite and doesn't disappoint. Much of the joy that comes from\n\nwatching Myers (whether it be as Austin or Wayne) is actually watching him.\n\nHe clearly has a great love for performing, and especially for his Powers\n\ncharacter, and his talent only shines through more when considering all of\n\nthe different roles he plays here. You know going in that Dr. Evil is also\n\nplayed by Myers, but while watching him, it's easy to forget such a thing\n\nbecause of how utterly convincing he is.\n\nWith \"Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,\" what you see is what you get.\n\nThere is certainly no deep meanings behind anything that occurs within the\n\n95-minute running time, and it has a fast pace so your mind won't wander too\n\nmuch. The fact that a third \"Austin Powers\" movie will probably be coming out\n\nat this time in 2001 is a given, but after seeing his second adventure, you\n\nhave to wonder how many times the same jokes can be played out before they\n\nstart to overstay their welcome. Having Austin say \"yeah, baby, yeah!\" was\n\namusing the first time around, but it isn't here. And judging from this\n\nnot-bad, but lackluster first sequel, Myers should start brainstorming his\n\nideas now for the next installment. A little bit of variety and originality\n\nmay very well come in handy in the future.\n\n- Copyright 1999 by Dustin Putman\n\nHttp://hometown.aol.com/FilmFan16/index.html\n\nAUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME **1/2 (out of four)\n\n-a review by Bill Chambers ( sha...@filmfreakcentral.net )\n\n[Reviews! DVD stuff! Contests! @ Film Freak Central\n\nhttp://filmfreakcentral.net\n\nBring a friend!]\n\nI can’t wait to revisit Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. 1997’s\n\nAustin Powers: International Man of Mystery failed to light up my life\n\nthe first time I saw it; I felt no urge afterwards to utter Austin’s\n\ncatchphrases, among them \"Yeah, baby, yeah\" and \"Shag-adelic!\"\n\nSubsequent viewings of the film somehow improved its comedy; by the\n\ntime I received Austin Powers... on DVD for Christmas, I was a\n\nfull-fledged fan. The Spy Who Shagged Me features as many guffaws as\n\nits predecessor, but I left the screening feeling again amused but\n\nunenamoured.\n\nThis sequel picks up almost immediately where the first picture left\n\noff. After the luminous Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley) makes a\n\nstartling revelation to Austin (Myers) during their honeymoon, the\n\nsuperspy is off once again to do battle with Dr. Evil (also Myers).\n\nThis time, the bald, scarred, pale madman has devised a time machine,\n\nwhich he uses to go back to the sixties. There, with the aid of his\n\npint-size clone Mini-Me (Troyer) and an obese bagpiper (who eats\n\nbabies) named Fat Bastard (Myers, in repulsive make-up), he locates\n\nAustin Powers’ cryogenically frozen body and steals his mojo. Nineties\n\nAustin is rendered impassive to espionage and randy women, so he\n\ntravels thirty years into the past to get his groove back. At his old\n\npad, he hooks up with sexy Felicity Shagwell (heart melting, doe-eyed\n\nGraham), and together they search for Dr. Evil’s volcanic lair.\n\nDespite much crass humour that follows (including an endless anal sex\n\njape), The Spy Who Shagged Me is ultimately sweet. The film covers no\n\nnew ground in terms of homage to bygone spy thrillers, and very little\n\nof the humour is innovative, but its genteel tone smoothes over the\n\nlaughless bumps.\n\nAustin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me is only casually interested in\n\ntelling us a complete story. Mostly, it’s a showcase for Myers' range\n\nand improvisational skills. (Duh.) Austin, Dr. Evil, and Fat Bastard\n\nare such distinct characters that one will not likely scan for\n\nsplit-screen lines when any combination of them is on camera together.\n\n\"Distinct,\" however, doesn’t necessarily mean \"rich.\" Austin, for all\n\nhis signature attributes (the rotting teeth, the velvet suits, the\n\nsoundbite-ready dialogue), sends-up popular British TV and movie\n\nsecret agents who were never taken seriously in the first place. Watch\n\na swinger like \"The Avengers\"’ John Steed (played with pursed-lip\n\nwinkingness by Patrick Macnee in several incarnations) or the mod\n\ncriminals Steed pursued in action and you’ll see prototypes for Austin\n\nPowers rather than ripe targets for parody. Austin the man is a\n\none-note joke whose only real appeal is his promiscuity—it’s been too\n\nlong since we’ve had a hero who lives and breathes for sex. (Aside: a\n\nnaked Austin once again prances around buck naked, but his private\n\nparts aren’t so cleverly disguised in The Spy Who Shagged Me—in fact,\n\ndigital trickery appears to have erased them altogether.)\n\nIn other words, Austin is amusing but Dr. Evil is the star of this\n\nshow. Much funnier than Austin’s non-sequitor gags, such as a lame\n\nmontage involving the Queen’s guards set to \"I’m a Believer,\" are Dr.\n\nEvil’s non-sequitor gags. It is through the desperately uncool Dr.\n\nEvil that Myers and company skewer: the Jerry Springer show (in\n\ntwo very funny sequences—be sure to stay through the end credits);\n\n1996’s The Island of Dr. Moreau remake (Dr. Evil and Mini-Me perform a\n\nhilarious piano duet of Joan Osborne’s \"One of Us\"); Jerry Maguire;\n\ntime travel movies; and, of course, James Bond. There are also amusing\n\nsubplots involving Dr. Evil’s sampling of Austin’s mojo and the\n\nstrained relationship between the doctor and his logic-prone son,\n\nScott (Green). (As before, Scott is constantly told to shut up by his\n\nfather, here in umpteen variations on \"zip it.\" My favourite: \"Ladies\n\nand gentlemen of the court, exzipit ‘A.’\")\n\nThe audience I watched it with cheered the antics of both Austin and\n\nDr. Evil. (Perhaps I will, too, one day.) Based on crowd reaction, The\n\nSpy Who Shagged Me will see smashing box office returns. While I have\n\nreservations about recommending it, I would never begrudge it of\n\nsuccess.\n\n-June, 1999\n\n“Austin Powers -– Still Putting the GRRR in Swingrrr, Baby\n\nby Homer Yen\n\n(c) 1999\n\nIf there’s one thing I admire about Austin Powers-the man (Mike Myers),\n\nit’s that he has a boundless amount of energy and feel-good silliness\n\nthat could make the grayest skies turn blue. He’s a manic, I\n\nwant-to-fight-evil-and-shag machine that’s constantly working in\n\noverdrive. Austin Powers will always be the man that every girl wants\n\nand the only one who can thwart the mad schemes of power-hungry Dr.\n\nEvil (also played by Mike Myers). Dr. Evil knows that he can’t defeat\n\nPowers because the latter possesses something called ‘mojo’, the\n\nessence of what makes a man a man. Having this enables a person to\n\nhave confidence, appeal, and ‘shagability’. Powers’s mojo is\n\nespecially strong. So, he plans to steal it. He presumes that if\n\nPowers is mojoless, he won’t have the self-confidence needed to defeat\n\nhim. But as the story progresses, Powers learns a life-affirming\n\nlesson that ‘mojo’ isn’t what makes a man. It’s something far greater\n\nthan what his playful mind can ever imagine. And what is it? I think\n\nthat Austin, between shags, is still trying to figure it out.\n\nIf you’ve seen the first “Austin Powers,” then you’re already familiar\n\nwith the premise of this film. At its core, it is a parody of every\n\nJames Bond flick that has ever been released. And for the most part,\n\nit’ll put a smile on your face. You have the femme fatales with the\n\nlibidinous names such as Robin Swallows and Ivana Humpalott. Power’s\n\nalso teams up with a CIA operative (Heather Graham) named Felicity\n\nShagwell (“Shagwell in name and shag very well in reputation,” she\n\ngrowls). There is the standout henchman with an oddball name who\n\npossesses a special evil talent, in this case named Fat Bastard (also\n\nplayed by Myers). There are the secret lairs hidden beneath volcanoes\n\nand even a pursuit that takes everyone to the moon where Dr. Evil hopes\n\nto execute his grand plan.\n\nEach of these elements is milked for all its worth and these kinds of\n\nsilly exaggerations are something that any James Bond-loving fan can\n\nlaugh at. But there are also the nuggets of comedy that make this more\n\nenjoyable than the standard parody.\n\nThe opening credits features Powers strutting stark naked through a\n\nhotel, but manages to hide his ‘jewels’ from the audiences’ view by\n\ncleverly standing behind a large banana, a loaf of French bread, a\n\ncarefully placed pinwheel, and other assorted, suggestive items.\n\nAnother clever sequence involved a series of scenes featuring people\n\nall unknowingly making references to a man’s sexual organ. This is a\n\nscene that must be watched in order to be appreciated. I also like his\n\nunderappreciated, underloved son (Seth Green). He and his evil father\n\ngo on the Jerry Springer show where his Dad says, “you are the Diet\n\nCoke of evil – just one calorie – not evil enough.”\n\nWhat made the first one super-groovy, however, was that Austin and Dr.\n\nEvil were products of the ‘60s, living in the ’90. They were both\n\nabsurdly out of touch with reality, and that was funny. This obvious\n\ntarget for laughs is not exploited here, and it instead relies on a\n\nformula of straight parody. The result sometimes borders on\n\nSaturday-Night-Live-Skit-Mediocrity. Half-way through the film, laughs\n\nwere harder to come by and too much time was devoted to Fat Bastard,\n\nwhom I found annoying. Fortunately, Mike Myers shows commitment to his\n\ncharacter and zest for his antics. What’s not to like?\n\nGrade: B\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\nDo You Yahoo!?\n\nGet your free @yahoo.com address at http://mail.yahoo.com\n\nAUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME\n\nA Film Review by Brian Takeshita\n\nRating: **1/2 out of ****\n\nWhen AUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY made its debut in\n\n1997, it was an idea whose time had come. Mixing dead-on spoof with\n\nhilarious conventional comedy, the film was a continuous, unrelenting\n\nlaugh-fest that poked fun at the 1960's secret agent movie genre.\n\nIt's sequel, AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME, attempts to carry\n\non in the same tradition, but unfortunately fails to entertain as well\n\nas it's predecessor.\n\nMike Myers returns as British super spy Austin Powers, frozen in the\n\n60's and thawed out in the 90's to combat his arch nemesis Dr. Evil\n\n(also played by Myers). At the end of the previous film, Dr. Evil\n\nescaped capture by sending himself into space in a giant Bob's Big Boy\n\nstatue. The beginning of THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME features the evil Dr.\n\nEvil returning from the cold reaches of Earth orbit, bent upon\n\ndestroying Austin Powers by traveling back in time to 1967, when\n\nPowers was still frozen, and stealing the life force that makes him a\n\nsuccessful international operative: His \"mojo.\" Dr. Evil is\n\nconvinced that once the constantly randy Powers is robbed of his\n\nlibido, his ability to thwart the plans of the world's dark forces\n\nwill be sapped for good (or bad, as the case may be). Powers must\n\ntherefore pursue Dr. Evil into the past in order to save the world and\n\nhis ability to shag.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME attempts to capitalize\n\nupon what worked so well for the first film. This means there is\n\nstill a lot of parody of movies like DR. NO and OUR MAN FLINT, and\n\neven the Patrick Magoohan television series \"The Prisoner.\" In many\n\ncases, this works very effectively, such as when Dr. Evil builds his\n\nsecret hideout in the middle of an active volcano on a secluded\n\nisland, or whenever Powers gets into an automobile and the background\n\nimmediately looks like pre-filmed scenery. However, many of the jokes\n\nwe get in THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME are also just retreads from the last\n\nfilm without sufficiently new angles to make them as funny the second\n\ntime around, such as when one of Dr. Evil's henchmen just won't die,\n\nor when Powers goes romping naked through a hotel lobby. Both jokes\n\nwere brilliantly executed in 1997, but this time they are by nature\n\nless inspired and fall relatively flat.\n\nUndeveloped jokes are actually a serious problem in this film, a\n\nresult of screenwriting lapses and poor directorial choices. For\n\nexample, the Evil empire invested heavily in Starbucks, and now the\n\nEvil headquarters is located in the Seattle Space Needle. As Dr.\n\nEvil's right hand man Number Two (Robert Wagner) explains, it was a\n\ngreat investment because Starbucks offers \"premium coffee at\n\naffordable prices.\" The utter ridiculousness of this proposition,\n\nalong with the plausibility of the empire association (Amazon.com\n\ncould have been another good choice), presents many opportunities for\n\nfurther comedic exploitation throughout the film. Picture Frappucino\n\nmachines lifting themselves off of their mounts and walking down the\n\nstreet wreaking havoc. It's too bad the possibilities weren't pursued\n\nfurther. Additionally, there are instances where a character will say\n\nsomething which seems to be a lead into a punchline, but the dialog\n\nimmediately moves on to something else, leaving the audience hanging\n\nand confused. A good director would have recognized this and\n\nrectified the situation on the set or in the editing room.\n\nThe saving grace for this movie is that when the jokes do hit the\n\nmark, they hit solidly. Most of the time, the Dr. Evil character\n\nsteals the show, but one of Dr. Evil's henchmen, Fat Bastard (also\n\nplayed by Myers) may be the most outrageous. Drooling and inflated\n\nwith the notion that he's a sexy man, he also once ate a baby. Myers\n\nhas played over-the-top Scotsmen on Saturday Night Live and in SO I\n\nMARRIED AN AXE MURDERER, and Fat Bastard seems to be the next logical\n\nstep in the progression.\n\nThe other actors in the film are pretty much window dressing, although\n\nthey do what they can. Robert Wagner only has a small role as Number\n\nTwo before the film moves to 1969, and a younger Number Two is played\n\nby Rob Lowe, who does a great Wagner impression. Seth Green as Dr.\n\nEvil's son, Scott Evil, is under-used and has a lot less screen time\n\nthan he did in the last movie. Mindy Sterling returns as henchwoman\n\nFrau Farbissina, and Elizabeth Hurley has a short performance as\n\nSecret Service agent Vanessa Kensington. Powers' new love interest\n\nand action partner is portrayed by Heather Graham as CIA agent\n\nFelicity Shagwell, but she doesn't live up to the better performance\n\nby Hurley the last film. I realize THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME is a\n\ncomedy, but Graham just doesn't hold up in the scenes which require\n\nmore than a pretty face. Disappointing, considering her wonderful\n\nacting in BOOGIE NIGHTS, and I have a feeling the direction had more\n\nto do with this than anything else.\n\nOne of the new characters in this film is a one-eighth sized clone of\n\nDr. Evil, which he dubs Mini Me (Verne Troyer). I was impressed by\n\nthe fact that the film got a lot of mileage out of this diminutive\n\ncharacter who has no spoken lines, but actually helps the plot along\n\nin addition to providing a lot of laughs. In the end, however, Mini\n\nMe is somewhat of a metaphor for this follow up to AUSTIN POWERS:\n\nINTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY. It comes from the same stock as the\n\noriginal, but it's a lot less.\n\nReview posted June 13, 1999\n\nSo, in the wee early morning hours of Monday (well, not that early),\n\nwhile having my breakfast cereal, I see in the newspaper that \"Austin\n\nPowers\" has utterly crushed \"Star Wars\" this weekend. Ah, well, it's\n\ndefinitely a funnier film.\n\nUttering \"Austin Powers\" and \"Star Wars\" in the same breath isn't an\n\noutlandish thing. \"Austin Powers\" had at least a few \"Star Wars\"\n\nreferences, from its advertising campaign to the opening text crawl.\n\nWe can take it a bit further, and say that Dr. Evil is, like, the\n\nlightsabre duel, Austin himself was sort of like the Pod Race, and no\n\none was Jar Jar Binks. Well, I could have done with less Fat Bastard,\n\nbut I don't think, Fat Bastard Die Die Die. \"Austin Powers\" is a very\n\nconsistently funny movie, without many soft spots. Some things go on\n\nfor too long, like your typical SNL skit, but not many.\n\nWhat plot there is centers on Dr. Evil going back in time to steal\n\nAustin's mojo. This is basically an excuse to wander into all sorts of\n\nshameless product placements, the most inspired of which is the one for\n\nthe new Volkswagen Beetle; psychedelic Sixties theme park fun with\n\nHeather Graham in short-shorts; and some very neat jokes with clueless,\n\ndisplaced Sixties personalities who have seen the future but have now\n\nbeen sent back to their home turf. Dr. Evil trying and badly failing\n\nto use late 1990s-isms was inspired (\"One hundred billion dollars!\"), a\n\nsort of conscious set of reversals from the usual man-out-of-time\n\nidioms. Austin himself was less interesting in this regard.\n\nI'm starting to think that cultural critics of the 21st Century will\n\nrecognize Jerry Springer as a brilliant auteur, conjuring forth a\n\nsubtle performance art piece on a daily basis, casting it as a lewd\n\ntalk show in order for his devastating social criticism of fin-de-siecle\n\nAmerica to reach the widest audience in the most subversive way\n\npossible. But I could be wrong. I've only watched one of his shows,\n\nwhen I was on sick leave last year.\n\nI actually didn't like the original movie all that much. It plodded\n\nalong: once you get the idea of spy movie-spoof guys from the 1960s\n\ntrying to make it thirty years later, you have a lot of the joke.\n\nThat's material for half-hour sitcoms (South Park actually had a\n\nwonderful episode of this, with an ice man from 1996 being revived in\n\n1999: Land's End, Ace of Base, and the Internet was difficult to get\n\non), not feature-length films. This new movie just works better by not\n\npaying much attention to that idea, by self-consciously pointing out\n\nhow silly the movie is (\"It's remarkable how much the English\n\ncountryside looks like southern California\", and the London street\n\nscene with sun-burnt hills in the background), and by playing with the\n\naforementioned man-out-of-time-back-in-time jokes.\n\nOh, stay for the entire credits. Little skits in the credits. And the\n\nDVD for this movie _must_, absolutely _must_ have karaoke.\n\nMONDAY MORNING MOVIE WATCHER\n\nThis is the debut of my film reviews here on this ng. Any portion of it is\n\nconsidered public domain with attribution, so feel free to post it where\n\never. I'm between web page hosts right now, but I will post the new home\n\nfor the reviews when I find one.\n\n*NOTE*\n\n\"Monday Morning Movie Watcher is an informal review that takes all facets\n\nof the movie experience into effect, including crowd reaction,\n\nanticipation for the film, assorted \"hype\" surrounding the film, and\n\nultimately what the box office and overall reaction for the film was after\n\nthe initial weekend of release. In other words, I'm not trying to be\n\nPauline Kael here people, just a product of late 20th century\n\nmass-media pop culture.\"\n\n\"Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me\" (Released June 11, 1999)\n\nCaught the sequel to Austin Powers at the AMC Academy in Greenbelt, MD.\n\nSince the theater is next door to a college town, my companion and I\n\ncaught a late matinee in fear of a sell-out that evening.\n\nLike most AMC theaters, this one relies on a very loud sound system to\n\ncompensate for a lack of a dynamic stereo set-up, but I've found it to be\n\na good place to watch a film.\n\nA fairly large crowd for a Friday matinee rolled in, filling the seats\n\n(and the film's mostly young male demographics) well.\n\nTHE TRAILERS:\n\n\"Big Daddy\" - The Sandler movie looks to be a jump back towards his\n\n\"Wedding Singer\" success. Having now seen this trailer a bunch of times, I\n\nhave a new concern about the film -- what if the trailer's all its got?\n\n\"The Iron Giant\" - Very highly anticipated by those in the know, but an\n\nunknown quantity for those in today's audience. I love the design of the\n\nGiant, and the film looks like a nice take on the \"boy finds freak\" story.\n\nBut this may suffer the same fate as every other non-Disney offering. The\n\nreaction from the crowd was less than thrilling. I just can't see kids\n\ngetting that enthused over this film after what should be a jolt of\n\nexcitement from \"Tarzan.\"\n\n\"Detroit Rock City\" - a nice trailer that seems to suggest a cross between\n\n\"Dazed and Confused\" and a road movie. It's got a nice feel to it, looks\n\ngood, and might be good nostalgia for those who can remember the 70's.\n\n\"Wild Wild West\" - Bad, bad, trailer. But the Will Smith song is slowly\n\nselling this thing.\n\nTHE FILM:\n\nIt was funny. Very funny. The same kind of funny as \"There's\n\nSomething About Mary\": a few funny scenes sandwiched between hilarious\n\ncomedy bits, sprinkled with gobs of gross-out humor.\n\nBut not as good as the first one. The shine is off the premise. It played\n\nlike \"Ace Ventura 2\", as a series of \"greatest hits\" catch phrases\n\nintegrated in with new, very funny scenes.\n\nMyers, in writing the new film, seems to have figured out what his\n\naudience deduced from the original: that Dr. Evil, not Austin Powers, is\n\nthe interesting, breakout character. So he gives Evil all the good lines\n\nand plays him with twice the veracity as he does Powers.\n\nAnd that's part of the problem. Myers has boiled the hero down to his\n\nbarest parts: (and no, not his twig and berries - his essentials) a series\n\nof catch phrases and mannerisms that seems to be there just to string\n\nalong the comedy bits. On the other hand, he's taken the best character of\n\nthe first film, Evil, and made him into an over the top parody of...well,\n\nof himself.\n\nEvil was a clever send-up of Donald Plesance's Blofeld from the Bond\n\npictures, and really every other diabolical enemy. It was a fresh\n\ntake on a subject ripe for parody, just as Ace Ventura was a send-up of\n\nsuper detective/cops.\n\nBut just like in \"Ace 2,\" the character is imploded. All of the hilarious\n\nsatire on the original subject matter is used for dumbed down laughs. Dr.\n\nEvil is less a insightful parody than he is an over-the-top clown. It's\n\nWayne Campbell as Dr. Evil, and it's a bit of a let down. After such a\n\nwell-crafted character stole the first film, to see him jump out of\n\ncharacter just to ham it up leaves one wondering if Myers had simply\n\nexhausted the subject.\n\nNot to say this ham isn't tasty. Dr. Evil is still the funniest thing in\n\nthe film. His lines hold up over the duration of two films (not so Powers)\n\nand he participates in the film's single funniest bit: The Evils\n\nappearing on Jerry Springer.\n\nAs for the new additions to the cast, the most highly anticipated, and\n\nrightfully so, is Mini-Me, Evil's tiny clone. He is worth the hype and\n\nsteals every scene he's in. The battle between him and Powers should\n\nenrage little persons advocates, but it is priceless.\n\nThe introduction of Mini-Me opens the door for a rel comedic oppertunity\n\nMyers fumbles in the film. Part of the great fun that the original\n\nprovided was supplied by the dysfunctional relationship between Dr. and\n\nScott Evil. Here, the subject of Scott's reaction to and the nature of the\n\nrelationship bewteen Dr. Evil and his pint-sized clone. But the family\n\nrift is sqwandered with some \"He tried to kill me\" jokes and the film's\n\nlow-point: an awkward, completely out-of-character and momentum killing\n\nparody of Will Smith's ode to his son, \"Just the two of us.\" It's another\n\nin a series of examples where Myers has come up with a humerous idea, but\n\nthe execution in the film, and the character that is burdened by the gag,\n\nis a letdown.\n\nOne concept that seems to work is Myers as Fat Bastard, a really bizarre\n\ncreation. A grotesque Scotsman who eats babies. Weird, but funny. This\n\ncharacter lets Myers explore the darker, more obscure side of his humor\n\nthat was on display in \"So I Married an Ax Murderer\" and his less quoted\n\nwork on \"SNL.\"\n\nAs for Heather Graham, well, she's shagolicious. She literally looks\n\nsexier in each progressive scene, but there simply isn't any chemistry at\n\nall between her and Powers. While Ms. Kennsington and Austin had a bit of\n\nan emotional click, Felicity goes into the relationship worshiping Powers.\n\nWith such a lothario as Powers, a little courtship goes a long way towards\n\nbuilding an interesting relationship.\n\nMaybe it's character underdevelopment or just the \"american\" nature of\n\nFelicity, but something just doesn't click here. We know Austin will end\n\nup with the girl (as Hurley's Ms. Kennsington is hilariously dispatched\n\nearly). We just don't know why he would.\n\nHurley's early withdraweral brings us to another subject I'm a bit unsure\n\nof, and that's Myers' winking acknoledgement that the film's plot is\n\nunnecessessary. Part of the charm of the Bond films is that no matter how\n\nperposterious the scheme of the bad guy, Bond plays it straight, gets the\n\ngirl and saves the day. The first film spoofed that by asking why the\n\nvillain just doesn't kill the hero. Now, we are told the plot is stupid,\n\nwe are told the villain is stupid, and we are stupid to enjoy it all.\n\nBut that's where the film falters. It forgets what made the first film so\n\nspecial: the relationship between Hurley and Myers, the fish-out-of-water\n\nscenario and the sharp satire of spy films. The film hits all the right\n\nmarks, but as the lights cames up, I wiped the tears of laughter from my\n\neyes and felt the same way I felt after Ace 2, Naked Gun 2 and\n\nGhostbusters 2: I laughed, I cried, but I didn't see much I didn't catch\n\nthe first time.\n\nTHE AFTERMATH:\n\nThe crowd ate it up. The entire experience really did remind me of \"Mary\"\n\nin the sense that the very funny parts had the audience laughing so loudly\n\nthat you miss the next piece of dialogue.\n\n>From the grosses, the country ate it up, dethroning, as many of us thought\n\nit might, \"Star Wars\" as the top movie in the country.\n\nNext weekend will be interesting. I don't know how much repeat viewing\n\nthis one will have. The jokes are pretty obvious, and many are funnier\n\nwhen you just repeat them in conversation rather than see them on the\n\nscreen.\n\nTwo more thoughts:\n\n1. The reviews have ranged all over the place. One thing is certain -\n\nthis movie does make you laugh. How hard, or how satisfying the experience\n\nwill be, depends on the viewer.\n\n2. Calls have come for this film to be an \"R.\" Idiotic! Double talk\n\nand gross-out humor are squarely a PG-13 characteristic. Let's try and\n\nsalvage whatever merit the current ratings system has and not overdue it.\n\nGreg Wyshynski\n\nThe Clerk Jester\n\nAustin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999)\n\nDirector: Jay Roach\n\nCast: Mike Myers, Heather Graham, Michael York, Robert Wagner, Seth\n\nGreen, Mindy Sterling, Verne Troyer, Kristen Johnston, Rob Lowe\n\nScreenplay: Michael McCullers, Mike Myers\n\nProducers: John S. Lyons, Demi Moore, Mike Myers, Jennifer Todd,\n\nSuzanne Todd\n\nRuntime: 95 min.\n\nUS Distribution: New Line Cinema\n\nRated PG-13: sexual innuendo, crude humor\n\nCopyright 1999 Nathaniel R. Atcheson\n\nI am a fan of the original Austin Powers, and I'm also a fan of Mike\n\nMyers. I don't know much about him, but he seems like a really\n\ndown-to-earth guy, one of those comedians who doesn't find it necessary\n\nto make a fool of himself every time he appears before a live studio\n\naudience. I'm glad to see that he's finally found his crowd-pleasing\n\nniche; though most of his films have found their audiences on video,\n\nAustin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me is likely to be the first massive\n\nbox office success of Myers' career (with the exception of Wayne's\n\nWorld, which doesn't count for various reasons).\n\nI liked AP2, but not as much as I liked the original. My reasons for\n\nthis should not come as a surprise: too many elements are rehashed or\n\nexpanded from the first film, there are sizeable gaps in the laugh-flow,\n\nand there is way too much toilet humor. The story is goofy and dopey\n\nenough to carry itself through the slow sections, and so I never found\n\nmyself completely bored. There are also some brilliant casting choices,\n\na few truly hilarious subplots, and the gleeful use of sexual vulgarity\n\nand phallic symbols. I recommend the film, but I miss the\n\nexcrement-free environment and hokey originality of the first movie.\n\nHowever, I think I like the story behind this one better. It has a\n\nkind of insane genius about it that makes it entertaining even when\n\nthere aren't many laughs. Myers also does the right thing by giving Dr.\n\nEvil what seems like more screen time than Austin himself. (That also\n\nmakes me wonder if the series shouldn't be named after the villain.)\n\nThe basic structure revolves around Dr. Evil -- he goes back in time to\n\nsteal Austin's mojo. After drinking the mojo, Dr. Evil becomes much\n\nmore hip, and even has a one night stand with Frau Farbissina (Mindy\n\nSterling). Austin, meanwhile, works to recover his mojo with the help\n\nof Felicity Shagwell (the luminous Heather Graham, looking happy to be\n\nin an Austin Powers movie). Little does he know that Dr. Evil has new\n\nevil cohorts: Fat Bastard (an unrecognizable Myers in an enormous\n\nprosthetic suit), and Mini-Me (Verne Troyer), a robot version of Dr.\n\nEvil, one-eighth his size.\n\nAP2 is a rare example of a comedy that uses subplots in the right way.\n\nJust before things get dull, the scene switches to any one of the three\n\nor four subplots, and audience interest in the film is held through the\n\nend. The best subplot is certainly the relationship between Dr. Evil\n\nand Mini-Me; Troyer is absolutely wonderful as the mute little monster,\n\nand Dr. Evil's love for his diminutive pet is actually kind of touching\n\nin a sarcastic sort of way. This also adds a new dimension to Dr.\n\nEvil's biological son, Scott Evil (Seth Green). Green is a very funny\n\nyoung actor, and the rivalry between him and Mini-Me is quite\n\neffective. Mindy Sterling, reprising her role from the first film as\n\nthe crazy German lady, thankfully is given more screen time here. And\n\nRob Lowe does a perfect imitation of Robert Wager, playing the young\n\nversion of Number Two.\n\nThere's no doubt that AP2 shines in several scenes with inspired\n\nbrilliance. The two best sequences really can't be described in words,\n\nbut those who have seen the film will remember the way various people\n\nall over the world describe Dr. Evil's phallic space ship as it blasts\n\noff. And Myers' love for these characters and this series keeps the\n\nfilm from ever feeling perfunctory or dull. But some scenes go way too\n\nfar: everything with Fat Bastard, for instance, is not funny, and\n\nsimply disgusting (laughing and cringing are two separate reactions\n\naltogether).\n\nI had the distinct sense of deja vu all through AP2, as if Myers had\n\nbeen afraid to explore new territory. I can't say I blame him; it would\n\nhave been a mistake to seriously change the look and feel of this\n\nsequel. But it lacks the discovery and newness of the first film, and\n\nso it comes off almost as outtakes from the original, rather than a new\n\nmovie altogether. Don't get me wrong: Myers has made a funny picture.\n\nAnd, seeing as how a third installment in this series is inevitable, I\n\nhave high hopes that Myers will find an all new angle on his series and\n\nexploit it into oblivion.\n\nPsychosis Rating: 6/10\n\n**********/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\************\n\nVisit FILM PSYCHOSIS at\n\nhttp://www.pyramid.net/natesmovies\n\nNathaniel R.
