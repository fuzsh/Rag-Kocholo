When I heard him in the film, my first\n\nreaction was to lean over to my wife and say, \"Lowe's doing a\n\n*great* Robert Wagner impression\". She listened for a few more\n\nlines, and said, \"I think Wagner is dubbing the voice\".\n\nAfter a few more minutes, the \"Wagner voice\" seemed so perfect\n\nthat I was inclined to agree with her.\n\nNow that I find that it really *was* Lowe, I must congratulate\n\nhim on an *impeccable* impression. Great work."
