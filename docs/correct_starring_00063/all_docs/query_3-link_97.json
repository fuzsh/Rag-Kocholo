        "text": "We may be on the verge of some groovy news! It’s been 20 years since the last Austin Powers movie, but the international man of mystery himself, Mike Myers, is strongly hinting that we may get a fourth film sooner rather than later.\n\nIn a recent interview with SYFY WIRE for his new Netflix comedy series — The Pentaverate — Myers was artfully coy about the possibility of Austin Powers making a shagadelic return to the big screen. \"I can neither confirm nor deny the existence or non-existence of such a movie, should it exist or not exist,\" he told us, before hastily adding, \"But I would love to do it.\"\n\nHe gave a suspiciously similar response to Sirius XM's Jess Cagle (via Entertainment Weekly). When Cagle said that his statement sounded like he wanted to say yes but couldn’t, Myers said it was “a non-confirmed confirmation confirmation.\"\n\nWhich means there’s a film in the works? Maybe?\n\nThe first Austin Powers film, Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, premiered back in 1997 and had Myers playing a satirical version of James Bond, as well as a host of other hysterical characters. The movie was enthusiastically received (and still widely quoted), and two more movies — 1999’s Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and 2002’s Austin Powers in Goldmember, came after. All three movies, which were directed by Jay Roach, brought in over $676 million at the worldwide box office.\n\n\"I wouldn't say never never,\" Roach said of a fourth installment during a chat with Deadline in early 2020. \"But it does depend on Mike having something that he's inspired about and after all these years, it hasn't quite clicked yet. But I'm always game for anything he wants to do. He's a genius and he helped me get started and it was a blast to learn comedy.\"\n\nThe filmmaker went into a bit more detail the year before while speaking to The Independent:\n\n“We’ve been trying to think up an idea that could earn a fourth film for a long time, but it’s always up to Mike. He and I always thought there was more to do with Dr Evil. To be honest, I don’t know how we’d do it without Verne [Troyer, the Mini Me actor who passed away in 2018]. We always had ideas of revealing a whole life that he had that would have taken his character much further. If Mike cracks it and figures it out, we would definitely do some kind of tribute to him. I’m there if he ever wants to do it.\"\n\nWhile there’s still no confirmation (or non-confirmation?) that a fourth Austin Powers movie is happening, we can definitely see Myers take on eight new roles in The Pentaverate (all six episodes are now streaming). If you’re looking for some Dr. Evil action, you can also absolutely see Myers’ recent reprisal of Austin’s nemesis in a GM commercial that aired during the Super Bowl this year."
