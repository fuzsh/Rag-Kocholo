        "text": "Join a Discussion on Current Film\n\nBy JANET MASLIN\n\nhere may come a time when even Austin Powers tires of the words \"Oh, behave,\" but it isn't here yet. The sequel with the fab title \"Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me\" is several love beads short of its predecessor, but some of that was bound to happen once Austin's novelty dimmed.\n\nDespite an oversupply of bathroom jokes and scattered scenes that play like outtakes, this is still a crafty, intermittently hilarious comedy that deserves its place alongside Bill, Ted, Wayne, Garth, Ace, Mary and the Waterboy in the Smart-Stupid Hall of Fame. Mike Myers' neo-Sellers multiple-personality act guarantees that.\n\nIn a cheerful hit-or-miss laugh-in that plays like \"The Three Faces of Mike,\" Myers slips back into party mode as the happily delusional nerd and hedonist of the title. He grins gamely once again as the man who made bad teeth adorable and restored the word \"shag\" to its former glory.\n\nNew Line Cinema Mike Myers stars as Austin Powers, the happily delusional nerd, hedonist and secret agent.\n\nMyers wrote the screenplay with Michael McCullers for a candy-colored, amiably slapdash film directed by Jay Roach.\n\nEven the credit sequence shows that this franchise's sense of fun hasn't faded. Wearing nothing but his dead-animal chest pelt while scampering through a hotel, Austin shields himself with enough metaphorical edibles (two hams covering his posterior, phallic anything, etc.) to recapture the first film's giddiness immediately. It doesn't hurt that the very first thing on screen here is a poke at \"Star Wars,\" with a couple of others waiting in the wings.\n\nThe new film nominally centers on the possible destruction of Washington and a plot to steal Austin's mojo. (That term, as loosely defined here, is whatever makes one sway when Marvin Gaye sings \"Let's Get It On.\") But the real stealing comes from Austin's nemesis and alter ego, Dr. Evil, who emerges again as Myers' most inspired creation. If Austin is lovable for his wishful studliness (\"I put the grrrr in swinger, baby\"), and for not having any idea how nutty it is, Dr. Evil is an even more recognizable bundle of neuroses. He's the peevish but endearing villain who shows how easy it is to think like a large impatient baby, whether bossing his underlings or plotting to rule the world.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAfter the newlywed Austin is alarmed to find that his bride (Elizabeth Hurley, in a brief, delicious cameo) can be made to speak Spanish with a remote control, he reverts to his man-of-the-world mode and winds up with Heather Graham's Felicity Shagwell as his new companion. In hot pants or a macrame dress, Ms. Graham also makes terrific eye candy, but she doesn't share Ms. Hurley's quick-witted air of being in on the joke.\n\nFelicity, Austin and the 1969 Carnaby Street setting for much of the film are essentially one-note inventions. (Incidentally, at 95 minutes, the film still has enough water-treading time for Burt Bacharach and Elvis Costello to do a musical number in its swinging London locale.)\n\nBut the film's Dr. Evil scenes have more to work with. While Seth Green plays an even funnier version of Dr. Evil's surly teen-age son than he did the first time (the two turn up on a \"My Father Is Evil, and He Wants to Take Over the World\" segment for Jerry Springer), \"The Spy Who Shagged Me\" also provides an added element of sibling rivalry.\n\nIt gives Dr. Evil a new favorite in the form of a tiny, worshipful clone named Mini-Me (Verne J. Troyer) who wordlessly mimics every Evil gesture, even that smirky way of making mock quotation marks with his fingers. Dr. Evil, whose tantrums often leave him hilariously tongue tied (\"You're the Diet Coke of Evil! Just one calorie! Not evil enough!\"), naturally prefers the slavish copy to the offspring who talks back.\n\nUncanny as Myers can be while squaring off against himself in Austin vs. Evil confrontations, he becomes even more so in the id-like third persona of a drooling, loutish Scotsman. Pumped up to Jabba the Hutt proportions by the Stan Winston Studio, this scatological slob plays as perhaps a nightmarish overreaction to too many viewings of \"Trainspotting,\" or just a gross-out gambit to win the hearts of teen-age boys. Though Myers shows his versatility from behind the blubber, the film's wit is not heightened by the joke about the Scotsman's stool sample.\n\n\"The Spy Who Shagged Me\" mostly does a good job of paring down and improving the first film's minor characters. Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling), whose Yiddish name is perfect for her sourpuss demeanor, is magically transformed into Dr. Evil's love slave midway through the story. (\"I can't let my feelings for you interfere with my taking over the world,\" he tells her solemnly. \"You know that.\") The character named Mustafa (Will Ferrell) remains accident prone.\n\nAnd Dr. Evil's sidekick No. 2 is again played by Robert Wagner in present-day scenes, but he spends much of the film being Rob Lowe in 1969. Lowe's deadpan impersonation of Wagner is one of the film's sly little pleasures.\n\nAmong the more sure-fire comic routines here, at least for the film's target audience, is one in silhouette that has Austin and Felicity horrifying onlookers with, among other things, a gerbil and an umbrella. And presuming that nothing delights the true Austin Powers fan more than a penis joke, the film has special fun with synonyms. Cameo appearances by Woody Harrelson and Willie Nelson come in handy.\n\nPRODUCTION NOTES:\n\n'AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME'\n\nDirected by Jay Roach; written by Mike Myers and Michael McCullers; director of photography, Ueli Steiger; edited by John Poll and Debra Neil-Fisher; music by George S. Clinton; production designer, Rusty Smith; produced by Suzanne Todd, Jennifer Todd, Demi Moore, Eric McLeod, John Lyons and Myers; released by New Line Cinema.\n\nRUNNING TIME: 95 minutes.\n\nRATING: \"Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me\" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes every dopey double-entendre it can think of."
