        "text": "Length of film: 189 Minutes\n\nRated:\n\nGenre: Action, Adventure, Comedy\n\nDirector: Jay Roach\n\nStarring:\n\nIMDB Rank:\n\nPart 1 Time: 94 Minutes\n\nPart 2 Time: 95 Minutes\n\nWhere does the first film end? Dr. Evil (Mike Myers) orbits the Earth in his Big Boy space-shuttle half frozen.\n\nFinal line of dialogue on the first film: Dr Evil speaks to his cat, “I’m gonna get you, Austin Powers. It’s fricking freezing in here, Mr. Bigglesworth!”\n\nFirst line of dialogue on the second film: In a ‘Star Wars’ opening crawl sequence a narrator recaps the first film, “Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, was frozen in 1967 and defrosted in the Nineties to battle his nemesis, Dr. Evil.”\n\nHow jarring is it when the first film ends? Minimal, Austin Powers has prevented Dr. Evil from destroying the Earth. However, Dr. Evil was able to escape and is currently orbiting the Earth in the ‘cold recesses of space.’ It is only a matter of time before Dr. Evil returns Earth with another plan to overtake the Earth.\n\nWhich film part is better? The Austin Powers franchise parodies the James Bond franchise, mocking both Bond characters and story elements. Both film parts are memorable for their comedic segments and characters. Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, certainly has the most memorable characters with Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham), Fat Bastard (Mike Myers) and Mini Me (Verne Troyer), but lacks the character arcs that made the narrative a parody masterpiece. The jokes presented in the first film were original and creative, whereas the jokes in the second film were much more crude and recycled. All in all, Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery is the better of the two films."
