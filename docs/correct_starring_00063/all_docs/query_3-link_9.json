        "text": "✔\n\nClick To Help ! Whatever life holds in store for me, I will never forget these words: \"With great power comes great responsibility.\"\n\nSpider-Man has declared that this article is still under construction.\n\nPlease don't delete or edit this article yet because it may contrast with the original author's edits.\n\nAfter I finish this article, the world will be saved!\n\nHero Overview\n\n“ Oh, behave! „ ~ Austin's catchphrase.\n\n“ Yeah baby, yeah! „ ~ Another one of Austin's catchphrase.\n\nSir Austin Danger Powers is the titular main protagonist of the trilogy of the same name. He is a geeky-looking, hippie-like secret agent.\n\nAustin was frozen in 1967 and defrosted in 1997 to battle his (former) arch-nemesis and brother Dr. Evil.\n\nHe is portrayed by Mike Myers, who also played Shrek, The Cat in the Hat (2003) and Fat Bastard and Goldmember.\n\nHistory[]\n\nWhen Austin was a baby, he, his parents and brother Doug went on a trip to Belgium. At one point during the trip, his father left the car to urinate, during which time the car was blown up. Austin survived the explosion, but his mother was killed, and his brother was missing and presumed dead. Due to the loss of his wife and one of his sons, Nigel kept a very distant relationship with his remaining son, acting more like a friend than a father.\n\nIf the song \"Daddy Wasn't There\" is any indication, while growing up, Nigel never took Austin to the fair or changed his underwear. Austin was also baptized and circumcised while growing up. Years later, Austin entered the British Intelligence Academy to become an International Man of Mystery. Unknown to Austin, his roommate Douglas Evil was actually his long-lost brother. It was during his time at the academy that he first met Basil Exposition.\n\nIn the second movie, he is enjoying his time with this wife, Vanessa Kensington, until she reveals that she is one of Dr. Evil's fembots and soon explodes. Glad that he's single, Austin can continue his womanizing. He is doing a photoshoot with one of Dr. Evil's femme fatales, in order to seduce and eventually defeat Austin, but this fails as she has fallen for Austin's classic charm. While the two are having sex, Dr. Evil travels back to 1969 (when Austin was frozen in the first movie) and steals Austin's mojo - his sexual essence that gives Austin his charm and womanizing skills. Austin then teams up with Felicity Shagwell, following Dr. Evil to his moon base.\n\nDespite Douglas Evil having the highest marks in the class, Austin is chosen as his class's International Man of Mystery. He asks his father to stand up and take a bow, but the seat reserved for Nigel Powers is empty, causing everyone in attendance to laugh at Austin.\n\nPersonality[]\n\n“ \"Do I make you horny baby? Do I? Do I? Do I make you positively randy?\" „ ~ One of Austin's most famous quotes.\n\nTwo of Austin Powers' most prominent traits are his stereotypical English mannerisms, and his persistent womanizing. With these traits combined, he is charmingly irresistible to almost all women who know about him. Austin is shown to be a comedic, witty, yet sometimes buffoonish secret agent. Despite any flaws he has, he is willing to do anything it takes to stop his nemesis, Dr. Evil, and is shown to be a questionably good fighter. Even in the most dangerous of situations, Austin never seems to run short of humorous anecdotes and catchphrases.\n\nUnfortunately, Austin's quirky traits and libido can be his downfall, distracting him from serious situations, as well as causing him to make very embarrassing and humiliating mistakes. In Austin's early life, his father was not around when Austin needed him the most, which has given Austin deep-seated mental issues and insecurities. Although Austin is often friendly and charming, he can be very deadly, and has killed his enemies in horrifically brutal ways, which include drowning one of Dr. Evil's henchmen by sticking his head in the toilet, and another by sticking his head in a pool of vicious mutated sea bass and having his head bitten off. Granted, both of these men were killed in self-defense, and attacked Austin first.\n\nAustin is also shown to be somewhat forgiving to some of his enemies, one moment being where he could have killed Dr. Evil with ease in the second movie where Austin had him under a gun, but let him live because the evil doctor informed Austin how to save his deceased girlfriend: going back in time with Dr. Evil's time machine and preventing the death altogether. Another example of this is when Austin and Felicity Shagwell don't even bother arresting or killing Fat Bastard, despite the overweight henchmen trying to kill them.\n\nAustin's womanizing can go so far as to scramble his ethics, as seen in the first movie when suggesting that he and Vanessa Kensington \"shag\", a suggestion that came out of nowhere. At this time, Vanessa was not interested in Austin, and just wanted to focus on the mission, although Austin kept pushing the issue. Later, the two warm up to each other, Vanessa is open to making love to Austin, but he doesn't go through with this, as Vanessa was drunk. Austin's skills in womanizing are apparently so intense, that he can make female robots malfunction, as seen in the first and third movie, where Austin used his charm to disable Dr. Evil's fembots.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nHe is a parody of James Bond.\n\nNavigation[]"
