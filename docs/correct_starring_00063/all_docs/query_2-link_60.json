        "text": "Virgin Radio\n\n5 May 2022, 10:45\n\nCredit: Rex\n\nYeah, baby! Mike Myers has teased the potential for a fourth Austin Powers film 20 years after the last installment.\n\nThe actor and comedian played the legendary spy in 1997’s Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, 1999’s Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and 2002’s Austin Powers in Goldmember.\n\nIn a recent interview with SiriusXM, Myers was asked whether or not a fourth film could be in the works, and he didn’t exactly say no.\n\nHe said he “would love to do” another movie for the comedy franchise, but added: “I can neither confirm nor deny the existence or non-existence of such a project, should it exist or not exist.”\n\nWell, never say never?\n\nWhen the hosts said Myers’ answer felt like a confirmation, he joked: “It was a non-confirmed confirmation confirmation”.\n\nIt’s not completely out of the question- Myers already reunited with some of the cast earlier this year for a Super Bowl advert and reprised a beloved character from the Austin Powers franchise.\n\nIn the advert, Mike Myers makes a return the notorious Dr. Evil alongside Seth Green (Scotty), Rob Lowe (young Number Two) and Mindy Sterling (Frau Farbissina).\n\nSeth Green spoke about returning to the role of Scotty at the time in a statement acquired by Variety.\n\nHe said: “It really does feel like the band that has been playing together for 30 years. Austin Powers is still one of the most globally recognised things I've done. There is a fan base for it.”\n\nFor now, however, Myers will be appearing in his new comedy series titled The Pentaverate, where he plays eight different characters.\n\nThe comedy follows a Canadian journalist who gets embroiled in an international conspiracy as he attempt to answer the question: “What if a secret society has been influencing world events for the greater good since the Black Plague?”\n\nStarring alongside Myers in the series is Jennifer Saunders (who plays two different roles), Ken Jeong, Keegan-Michael Key, Debi Mazar, Richard McCabe and Lydia West."
