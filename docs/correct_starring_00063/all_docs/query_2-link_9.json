        "text": "For the third installment of the Men in Black franchise in 2012, the creators looked to the past. Will Smith, reprising his role as Agent J, travels back in time to 1969 to prevent an alien baddie named Boris from slaying Tommy Lee Jones’s Agent K. Instead of attempting to de-age Jones, the filmmakers instead cast Josh Brolin to play the younger incarnation of Agent K, which he called \"the toughest thing I'll ever do.\"\n\nBrolin, who had worked with Jones twice before, in No Country for Old Men and In the Valley of Elah, told Entertainment Weekly:\n\nThe ambiance that Tommy creates on a set is just unparalleled... The tension is f*cking amazing. I just found it fascinating. I grew up with a lot of cowboys, so it doesn’t affect me as deeply as it would the urban norm. I just laugh at it. But it’s still uncomfortable. That’s his genius: \"How can I make this the most uncomfortable moment anybody has ever had in the world?\" There’s no way he’s thinking it - it’s just intrinsic.\n\nIn Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999), Rob Lowe might have played Number 2, but his impersonation of a younger Robert Wagner puts him at No. 1. Lowe's impersonation of the original henchman in the sequel was so deceiving, editors were unable to discern Lowe’s voice from Wagner's. They assumed Wagner had done voiceover work to produce the footage.\n\nMike Myers, who plays Austin Powers, had apparently been impressed by Lowe's impression of Wagner when they were out golfing and wanted to include Lowe in the film. Lowe had actually met Wagner before as a friend of the actor's daughter. And apparently, impressions are another of Lowe's talents, as he recalled in an interview:\n\nI'm a mimic. It's not a skill I've used in movies, just with friends. Mike likes my impressions. One of the people I do is Robert Wagner, who was in the first Austin Powers, but this time Mike needed a young Robert Wagner.\n\nWhen taking on the role of Obi-Wan in Star Wars: Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999), Ewan McGregor braved the task of playing a legacy character in a beloved franchise and put himself at the mercy of potentially disappointing fans. Because the film was a prequel, McGregor played a younger version of Obi-Wan Kenobi and had to portray the character in a recognizable way.\n\nMcGregor said on The Graham Norton Show that he not only studied Alec Guinness’s performance as Obi-Wan but also watched many of the older actor's earlier films:\n\nThe fun thing about doing them in the first place, when I was much younger, was trying to imagine Alec Guinness, how would he play these scenes as a younger guy. It led me to watch a lot of his early work, which I hadn't seen before. Brilliant movies, wonderful films that he'd been in, and I just had such a great time studying him in those movies.\n\nHe probably didn't foresee that he would end up reprising the character while in his 50s, an age much closer to the 63 that Alec Guinness was when he appear in A New Hope.\n\nAlthough the 1992 Charlie Chaplin biopic Chaplin has been largely viewed as imperfect, Robert Downey Jr. received widespread praise and an Oscar nomination for his performance as the comedy film icon. Downey said he knows he wasn't the movie studio's first choice for the role, but director Richard Attenborough championed him. Plus, \"I know that I was supposed to play this,” he said. Downey idolized Chaplin as an actor and even took up residence at one point in a Hollywood home where Chaplin had lived.\n\nDowney looked like Chaplin, but that was the easy part: He had to figure out how to play him over a long period of the actor's life, and master Chaplin's accent, posture, miming, and other quirky moves. \"It was challenge on top of challenge and frustration on top of frustration,” Downey said. And \"[l]earning pantomime was the hardest thing I've ever tried to do.\"\n\nTo prepare for the role, over a period of a year Downey read about Chaplin, watched his films, and studied with voice and movement coaches. He even learned to play tennis and play the violin (with his left hand).\n\n\"Robert was determined to get it right, which is what Chaplin himself was all about,” Attenborough said.\n\nIn Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (2017), the board game takes a new form - as a video game. When a group of teenagers in detention boot up the video game, they get sucked into it and discover they’ve been transformed into their avatars. Armed with new abilities but not knowing how to escape, the quartet must figure out how to finish the game and get back to the real world.\n\nJack Black plays a brilliant professor named Shelly Oberon, the in-game mascot for 16-year old Bethany Walker (Madison Iseman), which meant he had to portray the mannerisms of a teenage girl. Apparently, he had not difficulties channeling the teen, as he told Collider:\n\nIn a weird way, I feel like it was the real life I was born to play. It was very easy to tap into my inner 16-year-old girl. I don’t know why. But just to have that power of attraction. It’s subtle, but when you know you’ve got it, you know you’ve got it. And it’s just a look, a subtle gesture, and you know you’ve got it.\n\nIn the 1999 biopic Man on the Moon, a tribute to the late comedian Andy Kaufman, fellow funnyman Jim Carrey reenacts the comic’s greatest hits with impressive detail. But the lengths he went to in order to impersonate Kaufman weren't fully understood until the release of the 2017 documentary Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond. The film reveals how intensely Carrey dove into method acting and had trouble separating his persona from Kaufman's, going so far as to hurl insults at the director while in character.\n\nCarrey told the Los Angeles Times:\n\nI didn’t black out, but the balance was way in Andy’s corner. I broke a couple of times on weekends and stuff, but pretty much from when I woke up to when I went to bed, the choices were all his...Somewhere in the background, there’s a little piece of Jim going, \"Oh, no, you’re not going to do that.\" But I was just along for the ride.\n\nKaufman's family members even treated Carrey as the real Andy."
