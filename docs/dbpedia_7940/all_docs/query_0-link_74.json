        "text": "Tribeca Festival has revealed its feature film lineup for its 2024 festival, which includes films from actors Lily Gladstone and Michael Cera and documentaries featuring Prince, Carlos Santana and Dolly Parton.\n\nThe opening night film is documentary “Diane von Furstenberg: Woman in Charge,” directed by Tribeca alumna Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy and Trish Dalton.\n\nThis year’s festival, which runs from June 5-16 in New York City, has a program of 103 feature films from 114 filmmakers spanning 48 countries. The lineup features 86 world premieres, two international premieres, six North American premieres and eight New York premieres.\n\nThe final selections were chosen from a record-breaking pool of 13,016 submissions. Half of the films in competition are directed by women and 35% (36) of all feature films are directed by BIPOC filmmakers. There are 30 films directed by first-time filmmakers and 25 directors are making their return to the annual New York film festival.\n\n“In a year of record high submissions, despite industry-wide challenges, and global tumult, our incredible filmmaking community delivered again with some of the most surprising, inspiring, hilarious, galvanizing, boundary-breaking and downright entertaining work we’ve had the privilege to feature at the festival,” said Cara Cusumano, Tribeca Festival director and SVP of programming. “Whether grappling with everything from the crisis of global democracy to the most intimate of human dramas, it was heartening to be reminded of the undeniable power of a great film to illuminate our world.”\n\nFor the first time this year, Tribeca’s signature Viewpoints film selections will screen in competition. The interdisciplinary program encompassing U.S. and international films across narrative, documentary and animation includes the animated feature “Boys Go to Jupiter” starring Elsie Fisher, Tavi Gevinson, Julio Torres and Sarah Sherman, and the narrative thriller “Darkest Miriam” with Britt Lower. Also part of the Viewpoints selections are documentaries “Champions of the Golden Valley”, directed by Ben Sturgulewski, an inspiring sports fable and portrait of people in profound political and social transition, and “Searching for Amani”, directed by Debra Aroko, which follows a 13-year-old’s dramatic quest to investigate his father’s mysterious murder in one of Kenya’s largest wildlife conservancies.\n\nThe 23rd edition of Tribeca reflects a running theme of political activism and the power of art to spark change in the face of global catastrophe. Part of this year’s lineup is “The Cranes Call,” directed by Laura Warner, which spotlights war crimes investigators for the Clooney Foundation for Justice, led by Amal and George Clooney, as they risk their lives traveling across Ukraine to build cases against Russian soldiers and commanders, and “America’s Burning,” directed by David Smick and narrated by Michael Douglas, which dives into the economic root of hate and division.\n\n“Each year, the Tribeca Festival reflects our culture, capturing the essence of the present moment. We’re thrilled to showcase our 23rd edition, delving into captivating explorations of artificial intelligence with Demis Hassabis, thought-provoking discussions on the future of democracy, and so much more,” said Jane Rosenthal, Tribeca Co-Founder and CEO. “Storytelling possesses a remarkable ability to bring us together, offering hope in these challenging times. We eagerly anticipate engaging with audiences on difficult yet timely subjects.”\n\nSee the full feature film lineup listed below:\n\nU.S. NARRATIVE COMPETITION\n\nAdult Best Friends, (United States) – World Premiere.
