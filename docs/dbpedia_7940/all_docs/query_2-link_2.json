        "text": "Fictional character\n\nOld Mother Riley is a fictional character portrayed from about 1934 to 1954 by Arthur Lucan and from 1954 to the 1980s by Roy Rolland as part of a British music hall act.[1][2]\n\nOld Mother Riley (full comedy name: Daphne Bluebell Snowdrop Riley) is an Irish washerwoman and charwoman character, devised by Lucan (born Arthur Towle).[1][3] His wife Kitty McShane played Old Mother Riley's daughter, Kitty.[1] It was essentially a drag act but also a double act. The couple played music halls, theatres, and broadcast on radio and appeared in films. Lucan was voted sixth biggest British box-office star by the Motion Picture Herald in 1943.[4][5] In 1939, Jimmy Clitheroe appeared in an Old Mother Riley pantomime called The Old Woman who Lives in a Shoe,[6] and then the following year had a part in the film, Old Mother Riley in Society. The Film Fun comic included an \"Old Mother Riley\" strip cartoon in the 1940s.\n\nOld Mother Riley was the first and arguably the most influential drag act on stage and screen. Although nothing like the glamorous acts like Danny La Rue, Old Mother Riley proved that drag could be a smash hit with audiences and make you a star. The Old Mother Riley films also proved that drag could be an acceptable part of comedy and storytelling. Previous to Old Mother Riley, drag was a mixture of singing acts and short comedy sketches in music halls across the UK.\n\nRoy Rolland was Lucan's understudy and stand-in, and after Lucan's death in 1954 he continued to play the Old Mother Riley character in pantomime, on television and in cabaret until the 1980s.[1]\n\nThe character and show exist in a comic lineage that extends to Mrs. Brown's Boys.[7]\n\nOld Mother Riley films\n\n[edit]\n\nMade on a minuscule budget, but extremely profitable, 16 of the 18 films made by Arthur Lucan featured him as Old Mother Riley:\n\nStars on Parade (1936)\n\nBridget's Night Out (1936)\n\nKathleen Mavourneen (1937)\n\nOld Mother Riley (1937)\n\nOld Mother Riley in Paris (1938)\n\nOld Mother Riley, MP (1939)\n\nOld Mother Riley Joins Up (1940)\n\nOld Mother Riley in Society (1940)\n\nOld Mother Riley in Business (1941)\n\nOld Mother Riley's Circus (1941)\n\nOld Mother Riley's Ghosts (1941)\n\nOld Mother Riley Overseas (1943)\n\nOld Mother Riley Detective (1943)\n\nOld Mother Riley at Home (1945)\n\nOld Mother Riley's New Venture (1949)\n\nOld Mother Riley Headmistress (1950)\n\nOld Mother Riley's Jungle Treasure (1951)\n\nMother Riley Meets the Vampire (1952) â€“ co-stars Bela Lugosi.\n\nAt the time of Lucan's death he was scheduled to film Old Mother Riley's Trip to Mars.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nDrag queen\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nSources\n\n[edit]"
