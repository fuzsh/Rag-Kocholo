        "meta_description": "The music hall reinvented itself as variety with sufficient success for new theatres to be built in the 1930s. The early days of the music hall were evoked nostalgically in Champagne Charlie and a string of films which followed. In the late 1940s, the cinema's debt to the music hall was evident in the Mancunian comedies and the Old Mother Riley series. Both were distinctive forms of British cinema, though their proletarian character means that they have received scant critical attention. The scenarios of Mancunian films, the characters of the stars and the low production costs resulted in a unique style of filmmaking which appealed to northern, working-class audiences. Two Mancunian offerings, Somewhere in Camp and Somewhere on Leave drew the largest audiences at the Majestic, Macclesfield, in 1942 and 1943 respectively. Home Sweet Home is a typical Mancunian product in its casting and scenario.",
