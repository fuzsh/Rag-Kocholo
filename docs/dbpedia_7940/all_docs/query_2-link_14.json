        "text": "Riley Andersen is the overarching protagonist and location for her emotions of the Disney/Pixar Inside Out franchise. She is a 13-year-old girl who loves ice hockey. She was uprooted from her happy and simple life in Minnesota, and taken to San Francisco, California, where she experiences various changes in her life. Her emotions (Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger) help her through this tough time, ensuring her well-being. After reaching puberty, Riley gets a new set of emotions: Anxiety, Envy, Embarrassment, Ennui, and Nostalgia.\n\nQuick Answers\n\nWhat sport is Riley Andersen passionate about in the movie Inside Out?\n\nRiley Andersen, the central character in the movie Inside Out, is a huge fan of ice hockey. She loves the sport so much that she even misses her old hockey team when she moves to San Francisco from Minnesota. Her passion for ice hockey is a key part of her character throughout the film.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nHow does Riley Andersen's move to San Francisco affect her emotions in Inside Out?\n\nRiley Andersen's move to San Francisco in Inside Out significantly impacts her emotions. Initially known for her happy and simple life in Minnesota, the move introduces her to a range of new emotions including Anxiety, Envy, Ennui, and Embarrassment. This transition period is tough, and she becomes more sentimental, shy, and uncertain of herself. Despite the initial struggle, her emotions help her navigate this new phase of life, gradually accepting her new home. However, she misses Minnesota and struggles to express her true feelings to her parents, adding to her emotional turmoil.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nWhat are the names of the emotions that guide Riley Andersen in Inside Out?\n\nRiley Andersen from Inside Out is guided by five core emotions. These are Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust. Each emotion plays a unique role in shaping Riley's reactions and decisions, making her the vibrant character we know and love!\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nWhat changes does Riley Andersen experience in the sequel of Inside Out?\n\nIn the sequel to Inside Out, Riley Andersen experiences a significant change with the introduction of a new emotion - Anxiety. This sixth emotion is extremely nervous and anxious, especially about meeting the pre-existing emotions like Joy. This addition to Riley's emotional spectrum suggests that she might be dealing with more complex feelings and challenges in Inside Out 2.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nBackground[]\n\nPersonality[]\n\nRiley's emotions contribute to her primary behaviors in the film. Overall, Riley is an upbeat, honest, and goofy person when she is content. However, in adolescence, Riley becomes more sentimental, shy, and uncertain of herself as her other emotions begin to appear. By the time her family moves to San Francisco, she starts to be more troubled, irked, and lonely. Her emotions at this point try to help her get adjusted to the new life. Riley can second-guess herself, but she doesn't always repent her actions.\n\nRiley really misses Minnesota and is unable to cope with the transition. However, Riley is afraid to tell her parents her true feelings as they want her to accept the new home and because she has always been their \"happy girl\".\n\nAs time goes on, however, Riley becomes emotionally vulnerable, entering a sort of numb state of mind and coming to the point where she tries to run away, almost losing herself in the process. But it is here that she realizes that she has almost given up on the things that matter most to her in life, and realizes the risk just in time. Returning home and admitting to her parents that she's greatly depressed, Riley learns to accept San Francisco when her parents comfort her over the personal loss, and Riley (with the guidance of her emotions) eventually adapts to her new home in San Francisco.\n\nWith Riley's emotions now working all together and without one superseding the other, it would seem she had reached emotional stability. However, once she reaches puberty, she starts to feel her emotions more deeply, with any emotional stimulus, for more small it was, being multiplied. After learning her best friends wouldn't go to the same high school as her, Riley's behavior suffered a sudden change, with her usual upbeat and happy demeanor becoming anxious, as she tries desperately to make the hockey team of her future high school and be friends with a new crowd so she wouldn't be alone to the point of abandoning her old friends and feeling embarrassed whenever she tries to express her true feelings.\n\nHer desire to become friends with the popular girls caused her anxiety to become even worse, as she started to change everything about her to better blend in, even if that meant to do things she didn't like. After learning the coach deemed her not ready for the team, Riley started to project everything that could go wrong, leading her to have the idea to outdo Val, the best player, when she was a freshman. However, that caused Riley to feel like she was not good enough, leading her to act selfish during the final game and accidentally hurt one of her best friends. Eventually, Riley's anxiety culminated in a big anxiety attack. Only when she vented her worries to her old friends and they reassured her they would never stop being friends, Riley was able to finally find her joyful self and let go of her anxiety.\n\nPhysical appearance[]\n\nIn the first film, Riley is an 11-year-old preteen (later 12) with a slender figure. She has shoulder-length, dirty-blonde hair and cornflower-blue eyes. Both her parents have brown hair and brown eyes, implying that both the dirty-blonde hair and cornflower-blue eyes are recessive traits. She has very faint freckles around her nose, and she also has a noticeable gap between her two front teeth. In the second film, Riley is now 13 years old. Her hair becomes a lighter blonde and has grown longer, and she puts it up in a ponytail, just like her mother. She also has braces on her teeth, and an acne mark on her chin to signify her transition into puberty.\n\nRiley is seen in a variety of outfits throughout the film. In the teaser trailer, she wears a long-sleeved shirt with thin horizontal red, yellow, and light green zigzag lines, brown pants, and red Converse sneakers. On her first day of school, she adds a yellow jacket to this outfit. When Riley experiences a brain freeze, she changes into a solid pink short-sleeved shirt, blue jeans, and green Converse sneakers. Upon arriving in San Francisco, she dons a long-sleeved rainbow shirt, blue jeans, and pink socks. During her period of depression when her Personality Islands break down, Riley's outfit becomes a black hoodie, black shirt, black jeans, and dark shoes. For pajamas, she wears a green short-sleeved shirt with blue trim featuring a koala bear on the front and dark blue sweatpants. In the second film, her pajamas changed to her father's old 'Brang' t-shirt and black sweatpants.\n\nIn the book, Don’t get Angry!. She’s seen wearing a large-sleeved pink shirt.\n\nIn the second film, her wardrobe currently consists of an azure blue zip-up sweater with a hood over a mint green t-shirt mixed with pastel blue, purple, and light yellow, black leggings, white socks with yellow and purple stripes, and black Chuck Converse-style sneakers with white soles. A flashback of how her sense of self is formed shows her being her 12-year-old self where she wears a blue jacket with the Foghorns logo and some blue jeans. She now has a seafoam green hair clip for her bangs.\n\nMind Locations[]\n\nRiley's mind is extremely large and includes certain locations like:\n\nEmotion Headquarters: The central part of Riley's mind, where Anger, Disgust, Joy, Fear, and Sadness (later, Anxiety, Ennui, Envy, Embarrassment, and Nostalgia) all live and control Riley and where her memories are produced.\n\nPersonality Islands: Multiple personifications of different sides of Riley's personality, as determined by the core memories. Whenever Riley is doing whatever relates to a specific island, that island will animate.\n\nLong Term Memory: Enormous shelves of various memories form the main layout of her mind.\n\nImagination Land: A place where everything Riley imagines is built.\n\nDream Productions: Where dreams are filmed.\n\nSubconscious: Contains Riley's worst fears.\n\nAbstract Thought: A place where ideas (or anyone inside) are simplified to abstract concepts for better understanding.\n\nTrain of Thought: A train that connects Headquarters and the rest of the mind, bringing to the emotions things like thoughts (facts and opinions) or daydreams. It also moves memories around the different parts of the mind.\n\nMemory Dump: An abyss surrounding Headquarters, where faded memories end up and eventually disappear to be forgotten forever.\n\nSar-Chasm: a chasm formed after Ennui uses sarcasm as a defense mechanism to shield Riley from humiliation. It is located somewhere at Long Term Memory and turns anything that is said on one side into a sarcastic remark when reaching the other one.\n\nBelief System: A place located in the lowest part of her mind, where it connects to the Headquarters base and Riley's Core Memories and beliefs are stored, especially regarding her Sense of Self, the way she perceives herself.\n\nThe Vault: A prison that holds Riley's deep secrets.\n\nStream of Consciousness: A stream that crosses Long Term Memory and appears to have many types of food floating around, reflecting on what Riley is tasting or desiring.\n\nBack of the Mind: A dark place with a mountain made of bad memories that Riley wants to forget for now.\n\nThe time of day in Riley's mind changes depending on what Riley is doing at the moment. When she's awake, it's daytime, and when she's asleep, it darkens to a night sky. When she becomes depressed and apathetic, it becomes foggy and dark.\n\nAppearances[]\n\nInside Out[]\n\nRiley is a major character in the film. Her mind is the main location and the main priority of it. When Riley is born, Joy, her first living emotion, is conjured up with baby Riley smiling right at her parents. A few seconds later, another emotion named Sadness appears and makes Riley cry. Joy pushes Sadness out of the way and makes Riley happy again. Over the years, Riley starts to grow up in Minnesota and her other emotions, Disgust, Anger, and Fear, are born. Riley becomes happy and jolly pretty much all the time and hardly sad at all. Because of her happiness and joy, Joy unintentionally mistreats Sadness (who was only used when Riley threw tantrums). Riley also becomes one of the best players on her hockey team, the Prairie Dogs.\n\nWhen it is time for Riley and her parents to move to San Francisco, Riley becomes sad and misses her life in Minnesota. Riley starts to go from joyous and happy to sentimental and a bit depressed because she misses the good old days in Minnesota, not to mention that their new house is horrible, and the only type of pizza they serve at a pizza restaurant is broccoli pizza. Riley becomes even sadder, and Joy does all she can to prevent this from happening. Things go from bad to worse when Sadness accidentally humiliates Riley by making her sob in front of the class while telling her class about the good old days in Minnesota (although the other kids had empathetic looks on their faces when she was crying). This causes a new core memory to be created, which is a sad one. Joy doesn't want Riley to ever be sad, so she decides to get rid of it. But during an argument, Joy and Sadness literally get lost in Riley's mind, leaving the others to try to keep Riley's head on straight, but only end up causing Riley to become rude, reclusive, and cantankerous.\n\nFrom there, matters start taking turns for the worse. The next day, Riley video chats with her old friend Meg from Minnesota. Things go well until Meg tells Riley all about the wonders of her new best friend, whereupon Riley feels replaced and gets so angry that she hangs up on Meg. When she attends the hockey tryouts, she doesn't perform well, partly because of Anger ruled over her. When an excellent slap shot fails to get to the goal, Riley is frustrated.\n\nRiley figures that since everything in San Francisco is horrible, combined with her being so nostalgic about Minnesota, she decides to run away and return to Minnesota (an idea that Anger created, believing it was in her best interest). She steals her mother's credit card and skips school to catch a bus back to Minnesota. As her emotions struggle inside her mind, Riley becomes apathetic and fully depressed. When Joy and Sadness finally make it back to Headquarters, Riley finally realizes what she's doing is wrong and decides to run back home. When Riley returns to her worried parents, she confesses that she was pretending to still be happy and misses the good old days in Minnesota. Her parents confess that they miss Minnesota as well, and Riley finally lets her feelings out. Soon enough, things are finally looking up for the Andersen family. One year later, Riley is part of a brand-new hockey team, the Fog Horns, and there are new islands in her mind. She has finally accepted San Francisco as her new home.\n\n[]\n\nRiley returns in the short film, where she goes out skating with a boy named Jordan (whom she met at the end of the film). Meanwhile, her parents suspect that she is going out on a date with him and the Andersen's emotions all try to find a way to make it through this, like when her mother tells Riley in a \"cool way\" that Riley is hanging with Jordan, leaving Riley confused, with weird and comical results. After assuring her mother that she and Jordan are going skating with a group of friends, she soon realizes that Jordan was left alone with her father. She rushes downstairs to find her father and Jordan listening to loud rock music while playing air guitars. Embarrassed, Riley drags Jordan out the door.\n\nInside Out 2[]\n\nRiley's emotions are happily tending to her during a hockey game and preparing her for high school. As they work in tandem, the emotions have created a sub-basement in Headquarters called the \"Sense of Self\" where they place the memories that help build Riley's character. This results in the creation of a ball of strands that voices Riley's inner self; \"I am a good person\". Joy has also built a pipe that shoots out terrible memories that they want to forget to the \"back of the mind\". Riley wants to try out for her high school's hockey team, the Fire Hawks, and the emotions make sure that Riley feels her best self.\n\nIn the middle the night, the emotions are awoken by the sound of the puberty alarm. Headquarters is suddenly swarmed with workers who proceed to take apart the place and make additions to the control board. They leave without having finished, but warn them of new people coming in. The emotions quickly learn that their effect on Riley is much more unstable with her overreacting over minute details. Riley gets ready to go to hockey camp with her friends Grace and Bree. She calms down when she voices her intent for the three of them to make the Fire Hawks together, but Grace reveals that she and Bree are actually going to another high school, much to Riley's worry.\n\nUpon arriving at camp, the emotions are shocked to be greeted by Anxiety, a new emotion who constantly concerns herself with the worst case scenario in Riley's future. They also meet Envy, who is constantly jealous and amused at the other's traits, Embarrassment, who rarely speaks to the others, Ennui, who chills out on her couch and alters the control board with her phone, and Nostalgia, who constantly reflects on the past, but remains downstairs throughout the majority of the film.\n\nRiley runs into her idol Valentina \"Val\" Ortiz who became a Fire Hawk during her freshman year. Anxiety and Envy ensure that Riley comes off as assured in front of Val, though they manage to make it incredibly awkward. When Riley struggles with either going with Val or her friends, Anxiety forces Riley to ignore her Sense of Self. While in the locker room, Joy gets Riley to goof off with Grace and Bree, however Coach Roberts catches them and orders everyone to give up their phones and has them do exercises, making Riley embarrassed.\n\nAnxiety continues to push Riley to look cool in front of Val and ignore Grace and Bree. To accomplish this, she takes her Sense of Self and launches it to the back of the mind. Anxiety tells Joy that she needs to reinvent Riley for the future and has Embarrassment literally bottle up Joy, Anger, Sadness, Disgust, and Fear and send them all the way back to the vault along with Riley's other hidden beliefs and emotions. In the meantime, Anxiety gets Riley to get back on Val's good side and motivates her to practice extra hard and to look good in front of her and Coach Roberts.\n\nWhile in the vault, the emotions meet Bloofy and Pouchy, characters from a cartoon show that Riley still likes, Lance Slashblade, a video game character that Riley and Disgust have a crush on, and Deep Dark Secret, a large being that hides Riley's most terrible secret. Deep Dark Secret breaks them out of their bottle while Pouchy produces a stick of dynamite to help them get out. Lance manages to defeat the security guards (by rolling into a ball and inadvertently knocking them into each other) and the emotions escape. They find the stream of consciousness and Joy plans for them to find Riley's Sense of Self at the back of the mind and coerces Sadness to go back up to Headquarters so that she can recall them back via walkie talkies.\n\nAnxiety continues to have Riley alienate her friends in favor of Val and her group. During this time, she has her sarcastically quip about a band she likes, has her eating a protein bar that lacks flavor, and pushes her to constantly overwork herself, making her act out. Joy, Anger, Disgust, and Fear's journey to the back of Riley's mind is blocked off by the Sar-chasm, forcing them to go the long way around through the aisles of Riley's long term memory.\n\nAfter Fear, Disgust, and Anger voice their frustration with their predicament, Joy admits that she does not know what to do and that she feels hopeless and pushed to her limit over constantly having an upbeat attitude. The others apologize and proceed to venture further. They eventually get to Imagination Land, but find that everything is being rearranged, save for \"Mount Crushmore\". They find that the massive pillow fort has been converted into a studio that creates future anxieties for Riley. The emotions convince the workers to envision positive ideas for Riley. While this causes Riley to be put at ease, this upsets Anxiety as she finds them unrealistic. The workers start ignoring Anxiety and the emotions flee from security.\n\nThe emotions run into a literal parade of future jobs and capture a balloon of Riley as a judge and fly away. Back at Headquarters, Sadness has holed herself up in a corner trying to read through the manuals for an answer. She is found out by Embarrassment, but he chooses to keep quiet about her existence. Anxiety decides to pull ideas, portrayed as light bulbs, so that she can make Riley change her mind. They call upon several, causing a brain storm to form and hindering Joy, Disgust, Anger, and Fear's adventure. They ultimately escape the storm, but a giant light bulb is brought back to Headquarters.\n\nAnxiety has Riley get out of bed and head to Coach Roberts' office so that she can see how well she is doing at camp. Sadness manages to get Ennui's phone to prevent her from going through with it, but she is found out and captured. The emotions discover that Riley is \"not ready yet\", causing Anxiety to suggest completely devoting themselves to making themselves look better than everyone else. Riley's new Sense of Self forms, created entirely with Anxiety's emotions, and now utters \"I'm not good enough\", though Anxiety insists that it will go away eventually.\n\nJoy, Disgust, Anger, and Fear finally reach the back of the mind and climb the mountain of abandoned memories. They found the Sense of Self and contact Sadness who managed to escape thanks to Embarrassment. She is too late to save the other emotions as Anxiety tears apart the pipe back. Joy finally breaks down as she is incapable of trying to put together how to save Riley who has grown into a self-conscious, self-hating individual. Anger calls upon Pouchy who gives them a lot of dynamite so that they can ride a flood of memories back to Headquarters.\n\nDuring her hockey game, Riley injures Grace and is sidelined, causing her to have an anxiety attack, caused by Anxiety rapidly attempting to fix Riley and creating a wind storm in Headquarters. The rest of the emotions return with the memories imbuing themselves into the threads of Riley's Sense of Self. As they make it back to the top, Joy reaches out to Anxiety telling that everything will be okay and that she needs to let Riley go, freeing her from her own anxiety.\n\nJoy places the original Sense of Self on the pedestal, but it is not enough to stop the storm. Realizing that pushing her mistakes to the back of her mind limited Riley's world view, Joy removes the Sense of Self and allows the flood of memories to create a new one, making Riley complex and emotional. Grace and Bree check on Riley who admits that she was upset over them going to different high schools and wanted to prove herself to make up for it. She apologizes for how she behaved and Grace and Bree forgive her, promising her that they will always be friends. The control panel willingly calls Joy to make Riley happy now that she is better.\n\nRiley continues to warm up with Val and the rest of the Fire Hawks while still keeping tabs on Grace and Bree. Anxiety now has a corner for herself so that she can relax, Embarrassment becomes more open, though he is still shy, and the rest of the Emotions embrace their expanding family, though Nostalgia still remains in the basement. Riley, now having an ever changing Sense of Self, continues to live her life as she gets a text about her possible Fire Hawks recruitment. She opens it and smiles.\n\nIn the mid-credits scene, Riley's parents ask her how hockey camp went. The emotions grow worried, but Ennui simply has her say it was alright. Mom's emotions start to wonder what Riley meant by that, then Mom's Anxiety appeared when she looked at her red locks and wondered if she joined a band. And Mom's Sadness welcomed Mom's Anxiety back to Headquarters while Dad's Anxiety appeared and wondering the same thing that Mom's emotions wondered, and Dad's emotions affirmed that it's exactly what Riley said. Then they to go back to watching the game.\n\nIn the post credits scene, Joy lets Deep Dark Secret out and asks what his secret is. He admits that Riley was the one who burnt the hole in the rug, with Joy admitting that she thought it was when she peed in the pool. This causes Deep Dark Secret to lock himself in the vault again.\n\nFinding Dory[]\n\nRiley makes a cameo appearance in the movie. When Dory is thrown into Destiny's aquarium, she swims back and fears with a child, together with the group of children and Riley.\n\nDisney Parks and live appearances[]\n\nRiley's mind was built at Hong Kong Disneyland during the Coolest Summer Ever event in 2015. Guests can enter her mind and meet Joy and Sadness at the Art of Animation exhibition in the Opera House on Main Street, USA.\n\nRiley made her first actual live appearance in the Disney On Ice show Follow Your Heart.\n\nGallery[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nIn the teaser trailer, Riley and her mom and dad are eating from Chinese food boxes of the same type as the ones seen in A Bug's Life and several other Pixar films.\n\nIn the said teaser trailer, the playground scene in Riley's Memory Orbs is taken from Sunnyside Daycare in Toy Story 3.\n\nHer last name is based on Pixar employee Darla K. Anderson and the Toy Story character Bonnie Anderson.\n\nRiley is cross-dominant, using her left hand when drawing Bing Bong on the walls as a toddler and shooting the puck in hockey, and her right hand when she is eating.\n\nRiley is one of the few characters in the film to have emotions of different genders.\n\nThis is for budget and production time reasons: according to Pete Docter, this was done to make them as diverse as possible, while the emotions of other people were uniformized for quick readability. He states that it's \"a little phony, but hopefully, people don't mind.\"\n\nWhen going into the minds of various characters, the film seems to suggest that some children and teenagers have emotions of the same gender, while all adults' emotions are the same gender, but a cat's and dog's emotions are identical to the cat's or dog they're controlling.\n\nRiley's original hometown was Minneapolis, as shown as the arrival city on the Transway Bus Lines website when she gets the idea to run away.\n\nKaitlyn Dias was 11 years old and underwent puberty during production; as her voice had dropped during that time, she had to adjust her voice to sound younger.\n\nDuring the production of the sequel, Kensington Tallman replaced Kaitlyn Dias due to casting mandates as only hiring an actress to match the character's age[4][5] as Dias would be considered \"too old\" for the role, current in her early 20s.\n\nRiley's yelling, screaming, and crying when she was a toddler are actually recycled recordings of Boo's shouting and crying from Monsters, Inc.\n\nCoincidentally, both Monsters, Inc. and Inside Out were directed by Pete Docter, which is said in several posters and TV spots.\n\nMary Gibbs, Boo's original voice actor, is even listed under additional voices for this film.\n\nRiley's original home in Minnesota might be a reference to director Pete Docter, who was also originally from Minnesota.\n\nRiley is inspired by Pete Docter's daughter, Elie (the voice of Young Ellie in Up, which he also directed). Elie Docter was very outgoing and goofy when she was little but became quieter and more introverted as she got older.\n\nWhat appears to be the A113 Easter egg is positioned on a wall next to Riley before she pulls out her phone the first time when she is running away. It is spray-painted black behind her.\n\nRiley appearing as a cameo in Finding Dory could imply that both Inside Out and Finding Dory could take place in the same universe, as the Marine Life Institute is in California and Riley currently lives in San Francisco.\n\nKaitlyn Dias was in tears while recording the scene of Riley confessing to her parents that she misses her old home.\n\nA live action version of her can be seen in this Samsung washing machine ad, although it had only 4 seconds of screentime.\n\nReferences[]\n\nThis page uses Creative Commons Licensed content from the Pixar Wiki.
