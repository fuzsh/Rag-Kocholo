        "text": "One of the more jarring developments of the Washington Wizards season is how dependent the team has become on 35-year-old center Ian Mahinmi. Even more surprising is how effective he has been.\n\nMahinmi missed training camp and the first 19 games of the year while rehabbing an injury, but he returned in early December just as starter Thomas Bryant (foot) and backup Moritz Wagner (ankle) both suffered injuries of their own.\n\nMahinmi was the break-glass-in-case-of-emergency center on the Wizards roster, and he’s performed admirably.\n\nSigned during the 2016 offseason to a four-year deal with Washington, Mahinmi spent three years battling injuries, battling for playing time and providing lackluster results during the playing time he did receive.\n\nDuring the 2016-17 season, he played in just 31 games and averaged just 5.6 points. He was supposed to be the backup to Marcin Gortat, the incumbent center since 2013, but Mahinmi underwent knee surgery before the season and received platelet-rich plasma treatment during the year. The Wizards, instead, relied on Jason Smith as the backup center.\n\nIn 2017-18, Mahinmi saw the floor in 77 games but averaged just 4.8 points per game in 14.9 minutes.\n\nLast year, Mahinmi’s scoring average slipped again, to 4.1, and he appeared in 34 contests. While Mahinmi and Dwight Howard both sat out with injuries, Bryant flourished during his first year in Washington after being cut by the Lakers.\n\nThis past offseason, Bryant was rewarded with a three-year, $25 million contract, and Washington helped New Orleans and the Lakers facilitate an Anthony Davis trade, which landed Wagner in DC.\n\nIt appeared as though Washington’s center troubles were over: The Wizards could build around Bryant, 22, and Wagner, 22, and Mahinmi’s deal would come off the books after this season.\n\nThe future looked bright. And the future still looks bright, given that neither Bryant nor Wagner’s injuries are terribly serious.\n\nBut in their unforeseen and concurrent absences, Mahinmi has stepped up and played more like the 2015-16 version of himself: Career-highs in points (9.3), rebounds (7.1) and minutes (25.6) with the Indiana Pacers—figures that earned him the four-year, $64 million deal with Washington in the first place.\n\nHe’s underwhelmed since then, but he has come on strong arguably when the Wizards have needed him most.\n\nTo be clear, Mahinmi is not a world-beater, but there’s something to be said regarding a player who can suit up and deliver some respectable stats when called upon. Further, Mahinmi’s resurgence, if you want to call it that, is even more impressive because of how injured he’s been in previous years and how slow he’s looked as a result.\n\nIn 2019-20, though, he’s averaging a career-high 22.5 minutes per game, and he’s already been in the starting lineup 23 times entering Thursday. His points (8.2), rebounds (6.0) and assists (1.5) are at levels not seen since he left the Pacers, and he’s averaging a career-high in blocks as well (1.4).\n\nHe’s only scored in double figures five times this season, but his presence on the court—as a means of filling center minutes and finally justifying his giant contract—has been a pleasant surprise that should not go unnoticed.\n\nMahinmi made his NBA debut in 2007, but he was initially drafted in 2005 by San Antonio with the 28th pick of the first round.\n\nMahinmi is one of the few players still hanging around from that 2005 class, but his options for playing beyond this season may be scarce when considering his skill set, age and injury history.\n\nAt the risk of calling an end to his career before the end of the season, if this is indeed Mahinmi’s last year, it’s admirable that he’s going out as a productive player on a team that, in a weird way, ended up desperately needing him.\n\nAll statistics via basketball-reference.com."
