After being drafted 28th pick by the Spurs in 2005, I debuted my career with the reigning champs on October 30, 2007 with a win over the Portland Trailblazers. I retired as Washington Wizard and played my last official game on August 13, 2019 defeating the Boston Celtic. \n\nI want to thank the 4 organization I played for @spurs @dallasmavs @pacers @washwizards from the owners and ownership groups, front offices, coaches and players, staff, workers at the facilities and arenas, and most importantly the fans. \n\nThe Association! What a special place to grow from a young man to a man! I can’t think of a better environment for competitiveness, professionalism, big stage, brotherhood, and leadership. The high demands and discipline required made us to be mental tough, taught us hard work with unseen hours, made us embrace this love-hate relationship… thank you @NBA\n\nThanks to my support system that had been pretty much the same my entire career through the ups and downs, in season/off season, days and nights @agence_comsport (@nbouna & @jeremymedjana) @misternytimes @john.karaffa.7 @issa_oam @vasse210 @spyceco @mat_prepa @hdizzle31 @christiancompeanmovement @sarahcho @chinookyogifromanotherplanet \n@m_e_travel \n\nLastly thank you to my day 1! My family, my friends, my wife and my 3 daughters. It definitely took a village to raise a kid.\n\nThank you guys for making this chapter in my life so intense, so knowledgeable, so extraordinary. I promise to put everything I learned to use in the next one!\n\nChapter close\nLove\nIan Mahinmi.\".",
