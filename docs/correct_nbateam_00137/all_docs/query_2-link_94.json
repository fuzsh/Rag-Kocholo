        "text": "The Washington Wizards are the NBA’s hottest team.\n\nAnd they’re only getting healthier.\n\nAccording to CSN Mid-Atlantic’s J. Michael, the Wizards are hopeful that Ian Mahinmi, their biggest offseason addition, will be ready to rock before the NBA’s All-Star break:\n\nThe Wizards, other league sources said, believe that Mahinmi has a chance to play before the All-Star break that begins after a Feb. 16 road game at the Indiana Pacers. That’s eight games, starting Tuesday vs. the N.Y. Knicks, but Mahinmi has to go full-contact practice before he can play.\n\nThis is a big deal for the Wizards. Mahinmi, whom they penned to a four-year, $64 million deal over the summer, has appeared in just one game while coping with various knee injuries. When healthy, he stands to drum up their defensive value quite a bit.\n\nNo, head coach Scott Brooks won’t want to get in the habit of playing him beside Marcin Gortat. The Wizards are better running four-out, sometimes five-out, lineups and Mahinmi doesn’t boost their floor-spacing.\n\nBut the Wizards have gotten this far, just 2.5 games off the Eastern Conference’s No. 2 seed, with a crummy bench and a lot of Jason Smith. Adding Mahinmi to the rotation, even in a limited capacity, can basically be viewed as a trade-deadline acquisition."
