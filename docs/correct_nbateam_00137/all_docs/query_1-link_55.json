        "text": "Born in Rouen from a Beninese father and a Jamaican mother on the 5th of November 1986, Ian Mahinmi is a French professional basketball player, center for the NBA team, the Washington Wizards.When he first started, playing with the team from Le Havre, Ian Mahinmi is unknown from the public, but his talent will be recognized by the San Antonio team, the Spurs, when attending a NBA Draft.\n\nIan is only 19 years old, the Spurs, in order to have him continue his training in Europe, will make an agreement with his actual club so that he stays on 2 more seasons. He joins the Elan Bearnais team from Pau-Orthez in 2006 for one season before signing with the San Antonio Spurs the 23rd of August 2007. In 2010, he will then be transferred to the Dallas team, the Mavericks, where his energy will be praised by his team mates and staff members.\n\nHe will play one of the greatest game of his career against the Golden State Warriors in December 2010 with 12 points, 10 rebounds and 1 blocked shot. He then becomes the 2ndFrench player to be consecrated “champion” by the NBA.The 13th of October 2011, Ian will sign again with his initial club during the lock-out period, in-between seasons, before joining the Pacers from Indiana in 2012.\n\nAt the end the season 2015-2016, several NBA teams, convinced by his talent, will come looking for him. He will choose to join the Washington Wizards and will sign with them for 4 years.\n\n“Hip hop, streetwear fashion and sports have been with me forever. These cultures are in constant synergy and influence one another. Today, even as a professional NBA basketball player and member of the Equipe de France, I always keep an eye out for new designers and, am always on the lookout for unusual items. I love bold combinations, my taste is anything but conventional. The instinctive take on fashion I share with my associates is what enables our creative expression. Joining the French Deal label was a natural choice.”\n\nIan Mahinmi"
