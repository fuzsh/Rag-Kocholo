        "text": "By Johnny Askounis/ info@eurohoops.net\n\nAfter 12 NBA seasons, Ian Mahinmi called it a day. He announced his decision to retire as a guest of the NBA Extra show of beIN SPORTS.\n\nMahinmi, 34, last played for the Washington Wizards during the 2019-20 season. He logged 7.4 points, 5.7 rebounds, 1.3 rebounds, 1.2 blocks, and 0.8 steals per contest over 38 appearances to conclude his lengthy NBA run.\n\nThe French center was selected with the 28th overall pick of the 2005 draft by the San Antonio Spurs. He went on to play 685 games, including 67 playoff tilts and the 2011 championship with the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nPrior to moving to the NBA, he played in France with STB Le Havre and Pau Orthez. He returned to Le Havre for a short stint through the 2011 lockout.\n\nHis next step will see him in an active role as a minority owner of the Basketball Africa League, BAL.\n\nPhoto Credit: Getty Images"
