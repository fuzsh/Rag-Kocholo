        "text": "Personal Bio/PreCareer Summary\n\nIan Mahinmi was born in 1986 and raised in Rouen, France. His name is pronounced \"Yahn mah-HEEN-me\", but he is comfortable with either the English (Ian) or French pronunciations. Mahinmi says his dad calls him Ian while his mom refers to him as Yan. Mahinmi's mother is from Jamaica and his father is from Benin, Africa. The big center has two brothers and two sisters. His older brother played professional soccer in Canada. Mahinmi helped lead France to a bronze medal in the 2004 European Junior Championships. He was a member of the French National Team from 2006 through 2011. Mahinmi represented France in the 2010 World Championships in Turkey and averaged 4.5 points, 3.2 rebounds and 10.0 minutes in six appearances. The veteran has his own fashion line called French Deal. He also hosts a basketball camp in France during the summer. Fans can follow him on Twitter (@ianmahinmi) and Instagram (ianou76). Mahinmi began his professional basketball career in 2004-05 with STB Le Havre of the Jeep Elite league in France, averaging 6.0 points and 4.0 rebounds in 33 games. His raw talent drew the interest of the Spurs, which selected the 6-foot-11 center with the 28th overall pick in the 2005 NBA Draft. Mahinmi remained in Europe and started 28 of 36 games the following season, averaging 19.6 minutes per contest and posting per-game averages of 9.7 points, 5.2 rebounds and 1.8 blocks while shooting 56.1 percent from the field. He graduated to France's top professional league in 2006-07, playing 51 games for Elan Bearnais Pau-Orthez. Mahinmi continued his efficient shooting during that season, notching a 55.3 field goal percentage and a respectable 68.4 FT mark from the line. He also averaged 4.3 points, 3.2 rebounds and 0.5 blocks despite averaging 12.2 minutes of run."
