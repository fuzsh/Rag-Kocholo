        "text": "WASHINGTON — For only a split second, Jason Smith might have been the sole man standing at the Capital One Center.\n\nA half-filled arena watched the Wizards’ preseason opener reach its most mundane moments Monday night. Reserves had flooded the floor by the middle of the third quarter. The crowd was either distracted or disinterested with Washington down seven.\n\nNothing remarkable. Nothing worth celebrating. Until just before Smith left his seat.\n\nIan Mahinmi hit a 3.\n\nAnd not some end-of-the-clock chuck that he had no choice but to vomit at the backboard. Nope, Mahinmi set a screen for teammate Bradley Beal, popped to the arc, received a pass and went directly into his shooting motion with 11 seconds remaining on the shot clock.\n\nBoom.\n\nAs if he knew it was good before the ball even graced the net, Smith sprouted off the bench, arms over his head, to howl something incoherent.\n\n“He was laughing down the court because he just saw me over there on the sideline screaming,” Smith said. “I was happy for him. That’s big time to see your first 3 go down.”\n\nMahinmi has taken exactly eight regular-season 3s in his career. He’s never made one. Seven of those were heaves from beyond half-court. The other was a contested turnaround he chucked as the shot clock expired in a game from this past March.\n\nMonday’s was the first regular old 3-pointer he’s ever attempted in the rhythm of an NBA offense.\n\n“I ain’t gonna lie. I was pretty happy,” Mahinmi said. “I was talking to J-Smooth (Smith) before the game … and I was telling him that I gotta get my first 3 in one of these preseason games, get it out the way.”\n\nAfter a summer of concentrating specifically on taking his game to 23 feet, he’s accomplished Baby Step No. 1.\n\n“It was a good feeling,” Mahinmi said. “I came home, talked about it with my boys. All my boys called me and were like, ‘Ahh, you’re shooting 3s now?!’”\n\nOnly 14 other NBA centers, who played at least as many minutes as Mahinmi last year, didn’t make a 3.\n\nThe NBA is changing. Mahinmi knows. The Wizards do, too. It’s why they’ve encouraged his relocation inspiration.\n\n“You gotta keep an open mind. … You gotta be like a Play-Doh,” Mahinmi said.\n\nAnd if Scott Brooks & Co. mold their center into someone who can take the occasional 3, they’ll have to learn to balance.\n\nMahinmi has struggled over his first couple of seasons in Washington, but he’s still maintained as one of the league’s best offensive rebounders. He finished sixth in offensive rebound rate last year. But shooting 3s consistently would pull him away from the rim, even if he says hanging around the perimeter can help his offensive rebounding “because it gives me a running start.”\n\nBrooks isn’t worried about a potential hit on the boards, though he acknowledges it as a possibility. As he’s preached all preseason, he wants as much spacing as the team can manage.\n\n“If he hits one out of three (3-pointers), that’s really good. You’re gonna have to be aware of that,” Brooks said. “For offensive rebounds, we can live with a few chances if we’re not there.”\n\nWashington has been adamant about becoming more 3-point reliant. Those John Wall midrange ejections are supposed to become 25-footers. Beal’s long 2s are supposed to come from farther away. And other guys are chiming in, too.\n\nFor those, like Mahinmi, who hadn’t shot 3s in games before, the transition is as mental as it is physical.\n\nThe NBA’s worst shooters can splash in an open gym whenever they want. Players at this level are simply too talented to lack skill when no one else is around. But to hoist in game, they must grow comfortable first.\n\n“I think it’s just mental and habits,” Knicks coach David Fizdale said before Monday’s game against the Wizards. “Sometimes, you just need to be told it’s OK, especially with big guys.”\n\nFizdale has seen the transition with other centers, coaching one of the league’s most well-known midcareer ventures out to the 3-point line when he was in Memphis helping Marc Gasol turn into an accurate tripler.\n\n“A lot of times, it’s just saying to a guy, ‘It’s all right. Let it fly! Take one big step back and shoot it,’” Fizdale said. “And once they realize it’s OK, and you’re not gonna take them out for it, a lot of these big guys can actually shoot the ball.”\n\nOf course, Gasol was once one of the league’s best-shooting big men from midrange. The “big step back” to the arc Fizdale mentioned took only a normal-sized person’s legs.\n\nGoliath, meanwhile, might not even be able to stride to the 3-point line from Mahinmi’s usual hangout spot. The 11-year vet has lived around the rim his entire career.\n\nBut no more, he hopes.\n\nHe doesn’t need a gradual improvement to midrange. The Wizards have no desire for more long 2s. Only 3s. However, they can get them. And they want some from Mahinmi.\n\nJust let them fly.\n\n(Photo: Nick Wass/Associated Press)"
