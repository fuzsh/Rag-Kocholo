However, he's ready to return.\n\nContinue for updates.\n\nMahinmi Active vs. Pistons\n\nSaturday, Feb. 6\n\nHead coach Frank Vogel announced Mahinmi will start against Detroit on Saturday.\n\nMahinmi Provides Underrated Presence at Both Ends for Pacers\n\nWhile Mahinmi isn't one of the Pacers' key players, they're a better team when he's healthy and available.\n\nHis absence has provided a silver lining, as it has allowed Myles Turner to see more time on the court, but Mahinmi's presence in the paint makes the team better on the offensive and defensive ends.\n\nMahinmi is averaging 8.5 points and 7.1 rebounds per game, and his one block per game provides value on the defensive end as well."
