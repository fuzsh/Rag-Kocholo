        "text": "After missing out on the hottest commodity in the big man free agency market in Al Horford, who reached an agreement with the Boston Celtics Saturday night, the Washington Wizards reached an agreement with Ian Mahimni, the former Indiana Pacers center.\n\nMahinmi, just like Horford, broke the news via Twitter.\n\nThe two parties reached a four-year, $64 million agreement, a person with knowledge of the negotiations told USA TODAY Sports. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because, due to the NBA's moratorium period, the contract can't be officially signed until July 7.\n\nMahinmi certainly isn't a center of Horford's caliber, but he's a solid, athletically-gifted big man who — when finally given the chance to start last season — put together the best year of his eight-year career (9.3 points, 7.1 rebounds, 1.1 blocks).\n\nWith the frontcourt in Washington thinning out after the departure of Jared Dudley to the Phoenix Suns and with Nene an unrestricted free agent, Mahinmi will likely see plenty of time on the floor next season as the team looks to recover from a disappointing 2015-16 campaign.\n\nThe Washington Post first reported the agreement."
