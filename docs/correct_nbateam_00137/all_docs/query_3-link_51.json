        "text": "Ian Mahinmi used to hate the Mavericks.\n\nThat's the way it is when you come from France, get drafted by San Antonio and spend the formative years of your NBA career with the Spurs.\n\nThe rivalry can embed ill will in your brain when you only know one side of the equation.\n\nMahinmi, a 6-11 center-forward who has had a strong training camp with the Mavericks, knows better now. He's learned that the Mavericks aren't so bad after all.\n\n\"I'm surprised,\" Mahinmi says. \"I thought it would be harder because of the rivalry. I had a wrong opinion of some of these guys.\n\n\"I thought Jet [Jason Terry] was a bad guy. Now I know he's one of the greatest guys. I've really enjoyed becoming part of this team. After one or two days, I found out they're all good guys, great guys.\"\n\nThat's step one of Mahinmi's transformation. Step two, growing an utter disdain for his former team, will only happen over time.\n\nIn between, the Mavericks are hoping Mahinmi can become a solid member of the center rotation. He and Alexis Ajinca are clearly behind Brendan Haywood and Tyson Chandler. But in a Western Conference that requires competing with the big, long, athletic LA Lakers, there's no such thing as having too much size.\n\nInterestingly, the native of Rouen, France, toyed with the idea of staying in San Antonio, which had an option year that it could have picked up as part of Mahinmi's rookie contract. But the two sides understood it was time to move on.\n\n\"I wanted to go back to San Antonio, but then I was like, 'Let's open a new chapter,' \" he said. \"Dallas was interested from the start.\"\n\nIt appears to have been a good decision for both sides. Mahinmi has drawn rave reviews from the Mavericks' coaching staff. In Saturday's outdoor game at Indian Wells, Calif., he had seven points and two assists in the fourth quarter to spark a rally. It was the two passes for baskets that made Mahinmi happiest.\n\nAfter two seasons with the Spurs, defense is not a problem for Mahinmi. But the Mavericks are finding that he has a functional offensive game, too.\n\n\"I just have to play the right way,\" he said, when asked how he can convince the coaches he deserves playing time. \"Hopefully, I can pass the ball and help make my teammates better.\"\n\nBriefly: The Mavericks will play host to Cleveland tonight in an exhibition game at American Airlines Center. With LeBron James gone, expect a heavy dose of J.J. Hickson, Ryan Hollins and Daniel Gibson. ... Coach Rick Carlisle, who missed Saturday's exhibition after fainting at practice Friday, will rejoin the team at the shootaround this morning."
