        "text": "Doug McSchooler/Associated Press\n\nOn Saturday, Ian Mahinmi announced that he intends to sign with the Washington Wizards:\n\nAccording to the Washington Post's Tim Bontemps, Mahinmi agreed to terms on a four-year, $64 million deal with the team.\n\nThe Wizards were among the teams that were pursuing free-agent center Al Horford. The Vertical's Adrian Wojnarowski reported Horford was \"incredibly intrigued\" with Washington's roster. Horford, however, all but confirmed he's going to the Boston Celtics:\n\nWith the four-time All-Star off the board, the Wizards focused their attention on Mahinmi. The 29-year-old is coming off a career year with the Indiana Pacers, averaging 9.3 points, 7.1 rebounds and 1.1 blocks per game.\n\nMahinmi was a good defender inside. According to NBA.com, opposing shooters made 55.6 percent of their shots inside six feet—4.4 percent below the league average. Indiana was 3.8 points better per 100 possessions when the Frenchman was on the floor, per NBA.com.\n\nSB Nation's Bullets Forever wasn't thrilled to see what the Wizards offered Mahinmi:\n\nSimilarly, ESPN.com's Zach Lowe didn't offer a hearty endorsement of the move:\n\nWhereas Mahinmi excels on the defensive end, Marcin Gortat is known more for his offense than defense under the basket. Since their skill sets don't overlap all that much, head coach Scott Brooks could play both Mahinmi and Gortat at the same time. But that would mean moving Markieff Morris to the 3 or leaving him on the bench—neither of which is a good scenario for the Wizards.\n\nWashington could look to trade Gortat. The fact he's due a little over $38 million the next three seasons might have scared off teams in past years, but that salary is looking a little more reasonable with the cap rising. The Wizards should find some suitors for Gortat in the event they make him available."
