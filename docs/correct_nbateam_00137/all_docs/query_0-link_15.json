        "text": "The San Antonio Spurs' brass spent a longer-than-usual summer spending the ownership group's money like an alcoholic with a gambling addiction, thrusting a provident franchise deep into luxury tax territory.\n\nThe objective: give Tim Duncan a roster capable of winning a playoff series with the Lakers and a fifth championship.\n\nPopovich and R.C. Buford met most of the objectives.\n\nAthletic wingman to counter Lamar Odom, Carmelo Anthony, LeBron James, and other scorers at the three spot?\n\nRichard Jefferson. Check.\n\nHard-working, stingy defenders?\n\nYep. Jefferson, Keith Bogans, and Malik Hairston.\n\nRugged rebounding?\n\nThat's not a draft. It's the wind being knocked out of someone trying to grab a loose ball from second-rounder Dejuan Blair.\n\nInterior defense and a reliable scorer alongside Duncan?\n\nEnter Antonio Miggedy-Miggedy McDyess.\n\nThere is one hole left open, and the French draftee who could fill it remains as much a mystery as the popularity of Jon and Kate.\n\nWhen Popovich looks at advantages the Lakers might enjoy in a regular season or playoff match, beyond the obvious terror and remonstrance Kobe Bryant promises in a fourth quarter, the words \"long and athletic\" come to mind.\n\n\"Long and athletic\" refer to the spectacular inconsistency of the versatile Odom, the disruptive arms and post production of Pau Gasol, and the potential of former Kareem Abdul-Jabbar student Andrew Bynum.\n\nMost favor the Lakers to repeat because they can trot out three seven-footers with NBA-level talent. Gasol is an All-Star and future Hall of Famer, Odom is a championship-level difference maker, and Bynum could someday become both.\n\nEven after an astounding shopping spree, Ian Mahinmi—the Spurs' first round selection in 2005—is the only player who can match the size and athleticism of the aforementioned LA trio.\n\nAfter one D-League season, a stint with the French national team, two summer leagues and a preseason, Popovich still has no idea what to make of his talent-rich, 22-year-old work in progress.\n\nIn Sean Elliott terms, the Spurs coach doesn't know if Mahinmi has junk in his game or if his game is just junk.\n\nThe team must decide by Oct. 31 whether to pick up the fourth year on his contract, and his moments of NBA-level production have not made the decision any easier than his frequent stretches of foul trouble, poor decision-making and injury.\n\nA comparison to the heralded Bynum makes sense, even if the latter has already proven he belongs in the NBA and will soon wear a championship ring.\n\nMahinmi has often taken Bynum's worst qualities to the max. Various lower leg injuries ended Mahinmi's 2008-2009 season before it began.\n\nHe struggles to stay out of foul trouble and often exhibits lapses in concentration.\n\nWhen the Spurs watched brief highlight films of the French forward/center before the 2005 draft, they saw a mobile big man who could dunk with the ferocity of Dwight Howard and Shawn Marion.\n\nThey knew he would be a project, but they were hoping for Lowe's \"let's build something together,\" not do-it-yourself Home Depot.\n\nIn his breakout season with the Austin Toros, I saw him block a shot with such force that it flew to the other end of the hardwood and grazed the rim. It would have been the first rejection-turned-full court three pointer in basketball history.\n\nAs many times as he wows with his athleticism, he commits stupid fouls, takes bad shots or turns it over in ways that would leave even a casual fan perplexed and dumbfounded.\n\nThe Spurs' decision is about a lot more than a few million bucks and another year on a contract.\n\nMahinmi possesses physical gifts that could help the Spurs now. He flashes a package as rare as it is lethal.\n\nRobinson built a Hall of Fame career around his ability to jump higher than many and run faster than most from end to end.\n\nMahinmi runs the court with determination and enviable agility, but no one would ever confuse him with No. 50 at his worst.\n\nThe Spurs' retooled roster boasts quality big-men aplenty. Duncan, Blair, McDyess, Theo Ratliff, Matt Bonner, and situational forward Marcus Haislip could comprise one of the deepest frontcourts in the league.\n\nStill, aside from Duncan, each sports a dangerous flaw.\n\nBonner has physical limitations that cannot be overcome against elite opponents on either end, but particularly on defense. If only his production could match his effort.\n\nMcDyess is undersized at 6'9\", and knee setbacks robbed him of his once ferocious athleticism. Not exactly Dikembe Mutombo from the strong or weak side.\n\nBlair has responded to every challenge posed from high school to college to the pros, but there are valid reasons to be skeptical. Can a rookie who looks shorter than his listed 6'7\" height defend opponents with two to five inches on him in games that count?\n\nCan he manufacture points against taller defenders the way he did in the summer league and preseason? He may be a draft-night steal, but he's not even Charles Barkley at Auburn when it comes to hops.\n\nRatliff can still erase shots from the weak side, but how much can Popovich expect a 36-year-old on his last legs to do against high-flyers 10 years younger?\n\nHaislip brings size and a newfound defensive acumen, but his limitations make him attractive only in certain matchups.\n\nThat leaves Mahinmi—the big man chased by giant questions.\n\nHe can catch alley-oops. He can block attempts from the strong and weak sides. He rarely gives up significant inches to opponents. He's just 22.\n\nSuch promise points to the Spurs bringing him back for another year.\n\nHowever, does it speak well of his prospects in San Antonio that the two most common questions associated with his name are, is he injured yet, and how many fouls has he committed?\n\nIf the NBA allowed 15 fouls in a contest, no one would be shocked to see Mahinmi use every one of them before the final buzzer.\n\nEven Bynum could not manage that dubious feat.\n\nAs the Spurs ponder his future with the club and Mahinmi wonders what to do next, both sides will point to last year as the culprit in this difficult decision.\n\nLeg ailments caused Mahinmi to miss all of training camp in 2008—when the Spurs knew the first few months without Manu Ginobili would be rougher than sandpaper and more murderous than Michael Meyers with a meat cleaver and an AK47.\n\nDuncan started opening night against the Phoenix Suns with Bonner and rookie Anthony Tolliver as his best available frontcourt sidekicks. Kurt Thomas, nursing a hamstring injury, and Fabricio Oberto, resting after his heart fluttered for the second time that year, watched the loss in street clothes.\n\nThe front office might know if the 17 points and eight rebound averages in Austin that made him a D-League All-Star two years ago could ever translate to the next level.\n\nInstead, Popovich, his assistants, Buford and his accomplices are left with more questions than a Jeopardy contestant.\n\nSuch promise. Such inconsistency.\n\nMahinmi needs something the Spurs cannot offer. He needs it like a swimming fish needs water.\n\nTime.\n\nWill the Spurs scrounge up a few million more and give Mahinmi another chance or has the clock run out on a defective dream?"
