        "text": "The Mavericks are close to signing former San Antonio Spurs center Ian Mahinmi, NBA sources said Sunday. Mahinmi (6-11) played 26 games for the Spurs last season and is an unrestricted free agent. He averaged 3.9 points and 2.0 rebounds in six minutes per game last season. Several NBA sources said the 25-year-old Frenchman is ready to make a significant improvement moving forward. The Mavericks signed center Brendan Haywood to a six-year deal last week, but Erick Dampier is on a non-guaranteed contract. Dampier is likely to be either traded or waived before the Mavericks would have to pay the $13 million for the final year of his deal."
