        "text": "“I like to go to boutiques and find new designer stuff. Every year I like to add new pieces to my closet. For me, it’s fun.” Mahinmi has turned that passion into a business. “I own my own clothing line, so I like to go to places to see what’s going on out there,” Mahinmi said. “For me it’s something that’s very interesting.

The injury occurred Thursday during a morning practice in Vitória, a city in Brazil. “Yes, [the news is true],” Mahinmi wrote to VigilantSports.com early Friday. “I will be back in Indy sometime this week for (further) exam on my shoulder…”"
