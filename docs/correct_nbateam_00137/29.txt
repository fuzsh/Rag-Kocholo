“Hip hop, streetwear fashion and sports have been with me forever. These cultures are in constant synergy and influence one another. Today, even as a professional NBA basketball player and member of the Equipe de France, I always keep an eye out for new designers and, am always on the lookout for unusual items. I love bold combinations, my taste is anything but conventional. The instinctive take on fashion I share with my associates is what enables our creative expression. Joining the French Deal label was a natural choice.”
