        "text": "No. 2 Dutch Troop training in Scotland\n\nOn 16 July 1942 No. 2 Dutch Troop moved to Port Madoc, a town in northern Wales , to join No. 10 Inter Allied Commando, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel D. Lister. In the second half of 1942 Dutch Troop got to full strength when 45 freshly arrived Commandos joined them, and waited for their first operational assignment. On 31 May 1943 No. 2 Dutch Troop together with other parts of No. 10 Inter Allied Commando, moved to the English town of Eastbourne , which would remain the home base to this international unit for the duration of the war. In December 1943 on request by Lieutenant Linzel and Prince Bernhard, the British decided to deploy No. 2 Dutch Troop together with a British Commando Brigade to the Far East . A number of Dutch Commandos were not keen on the idea of being sent off to Asia , they would rather fight the Germans to liberate their homeland, but Prince Bernhard insisted, so most of them went. The eleven Dutch Commandos that took part in the landings on 1 November 1944 at Flushing, codename \"Infatuate I\", were Lieutenant C. de Ruiter, Sgt. W. van Genderen, Sgt. D. van der Wal, Sgt. K. Kruit, Cpl. J. van Woerden, Cpl. W. de Liefde, Cpl. J. Bothe, Cpl. L. Persoon, Cpl. H. van der Steen, Cpl. K. Baggerman and Cpl. C. van de Gender. Despite strong resistance the Commandos were able to make a succesful landing, in which Cpl. De Liefde took point to mark the landing area with a signal lamp. The Dutch Commandos got caught in heavy street fights for the next two days, but with only two wounded and the assistance of other Commando units, were able to liberate Flushing on 2 November."
