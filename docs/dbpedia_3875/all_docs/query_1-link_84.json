        "text": "Operation Infatuate\n\nOperation Infatuate was the codename given to an Anglo-Canadian operation during the Second World War to open the port of Antwerp to shipping and relieve logistical constraints.\n\nThe operation was part of the wider Battle of the Scheldt and involved two assault landings from the sea by the 4th Special Service Brigade and the 52nd (Lowland) Division. At the same time the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division would force a crossing of the Walcheren causeway.\n\nWalcheren Landings\n\nOn 1 November 1944 the Operation started with the Walcheren landings. No. 4 Commando landed at 05:45 hours just east of the Oranjemolen, a windmill on the sea dyke at Flushing, with the main part of the troops arriving ashore at 06:30 hours.\n\nSEE ALSO: Friedrich Lengfeld: I died for the Enemy during Battle of Hürtgen Forest\n\nThe Operation ended on November 8, 1944 after four German officers approached the Allied troops to ask for a surrender for the remaining German troops. An estimated 40,000 German troops surrendered.\n\nWalcheren Landings: British Marine Commandos Land on Walcheren at Westkapelle. 1 November 1944, on Board An Lci (s). the Final Phase of the Battle To Free the Approaches To the Belgian Port of Antwerp Began When Royal Marine Commandos Landed at Dawn at Westkapelle, the Western Most Point of the Island of Walcheren.

This image shows German coastal guns and blockhouses which the British forces quickly put out of action on Walcheren Island.\n\nStores are being landed near Flushing after the landing.\n\nThe images show troops advancing along the waterfront near Flushing with shells bursting ahead.\n\nBritish assault troops landed on Walcheren at dawn on 1 November 1944 and most of Flushing was included in the first bridgehead. The landings were supported by fire from British warships. The object of the assault is to silence the enemy guns menacing the Scheldt passage to the port of Antwerp.\n\nThese images show the British assault troops advancing through the streets at Flushing where there was sharp fighting.\n\n3″ mortars in action from behind the cover of amphibious tanks.\n\nThis scene on the Walcheren coast after the British landing has been effected.\n\nThis image shows the wounded being attended to by a British medical officer.\n\nA German POW captured during the Allied assault on Walcheren Island in Holland, November 1944.\n\nImage shows some of the first prisoners captured after the landing.\n\nGerman prisoners that were taken in the fighting being housed in a barn on the way to the Prisoner of War cages.
