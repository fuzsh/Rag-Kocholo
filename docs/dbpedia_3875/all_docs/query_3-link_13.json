On \"Uncle Beach\" in Flushing's Dock Harbour; troops and supplies come ashore from LCAs; the 4th KOSB's then file through abandoned German shore defences and head for objectives in the Old City. A Wehrmacht soldier helps British medical orderlies dress a buttock wound on a fellow prisoner; German prisoners are seen helping wounded to safety and unloading supplies from LCAs at \"Uncle Beach\" (including from one craft damaged and drifting near the eastern breakwater). A German shell bursts on top of the landing beach. Infantrymen from either 4th KOSB's reserve company or from the 5th KOSB reinforce the assault troops; more German prisoners (some wounded) arrive at the top of \"Uncle Beach\". Infantrymen from either of the two KOSB units advance through the Old City past buildings wrecked and set on fire by British shelling and bombing.\n\nPhysical description\n\n35mm\n\nObject Details\n\nCategory\n\nFilm\n\nRelated period\n\nSecond World War (content)\n\nCreator\n\nArmy Film Unit (Production Company)\n\nConnolly, J R (Production individual)\n\nProduction date\n\n1944-10-01\n\nPlace made\n\nGB\n\nDimensions\n\nwhole: Footage: 260 ft.; Running time: 3 mins.\n\nCatalogue number\n\nA70 187-7\n\nObject associations\n\nAssociated places\n\nOur collections information\n\nWe have over a million object records online, and we are adding to this all the time.
