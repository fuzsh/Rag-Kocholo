        "text": "Lasting Images of W.W. 2\n\nby Barry McClory\n\nOn reviewing my experiences of W.W.2 , I find that I have condensed the lasting images, which remain with me, into three poems.\n\nTrained as a Fleet Signalman, I was disappointed to be drafted to Combined Operations to join L.C.F. 36. However, I found that my time spent on board her was rewarding. As part of a squadron of Close Support Craft, we took part in \"D DAY\", the squadron was then re- organised as the Support Squadron Eastern Flank to join other ships in operation \"Trout Line\" as described in my second poem. In October we worked up to be ready for Walcheren.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the attack on Walcheren by the Support Squadron took place within the octave of the feast of St Crispin. The thoughts of all of us who survived that day must go to the men who died there. The three L.C.S. (L)s hit and burnt in the gap, L.C.G.(M) 102, beached but eventually set on fire. We have the pictures of the survivors of L.C.G.(M) 101 being picked up. The list could go on, the L.C.G.(L)s that fought until they were sunk, L.C.F. 37, hit by shells at 09.20 a.m., hit again by more shells and blew up at 09.50.\n\nOur Flotilla Leader L.C.F. 38, was ahead of us in the firing line, she was hit and set on fire\n\nat 10.20. we went alongside and took off survivors. Going back into the firing line we were eventually hit and holed at 11.15. Dodging more shells we withdrew,and after the survivors of L.C.F. 38 had been taken off, we limped back to Ostend, we were lucky not to have any casualities. The reason for the title of my third poem will now become quite obvious, \"The Forlorn Hope\",!!\n\nD DAY\n\nThe buildings seemed within our reach,\n\nAs if we sailed off Brighton beach.\n\nNo welcoming hoteliers these,\n\nTo we, who sailed upon the seas.\n\nTheir windows spouted fire and flame,\n\nAnd from their walls, more of the same.\n\nWe, close support were trying to give\n\nThat men upon the beach might live.\n\nAnd as we plied out deadly trade,\n\nWith port then starboard cannonade,\n\nWe watched the second wave arrive\n\nAnd thrust themselves into the tide.\n\nThey came with purpose, full intent,\n\nNo time for thought or argument.\n\nI saw them then, I see them still,\n\nAs if they climbed a massive hill.\n\nAnd when they died, they took their rest,\n\nAs easily as you or I, might to our nightly sleep reply.\n\nThe wounded took a little longer,\n\nThey fought the sea, the sea was stronger.\n\nWe watched them dying in that hill\n\nOf water, water, rising still.\n\nThe battle gave us no respite\n\nAnd it was not until the night,\n\nI watched the bodies floating by,\n\nAnd thought, it might be you or I.\n\nFloating outward with the tide,\n\nOut, to where the big ships ride.\n\nWho checked a tag?, or knew a name?.\n\nI'm sure it would not be the same,\n\nIf on the shore they had met their fate,\n\nFrom earth they had entered Heaven's gate.\n\nEventually there would be found,\n\nSome spot of well remembered ground.\n\nA sailor knows that he may be,\n\nMissing, or buried in the sea.\n\nBut soldiers must have found it hard.\n\nTo miss their burial, by a yard.\n\nBarry McClory\n\nTROUT LINE\n\nThe middle watch had just begun,\n\nWhen the craft next to us blew,\n\nAnd of a hundred men on board,\n\nWe found there were but two.\n\nL.C.F. number one.\n\nThe Germans had chosen well.\n\nAnd as we circled in the dark,\n\nWe cursed the Hun to Hell.\n\nSupport Squadron, Eastern Flank,\n\nLying in the dark.\n\nGuarding the Day anchorage,\n\nWhere all the big ships park.\n\nSix miles out from Oustraham,\n\nWe would form our watching line.\n\nFrom dusk until the morning light.\n\nAll through the summer time.\n\nIn front of us, the M.G.B.,s\n\nSettled the \"E\" boats score.\n\nBelow, the one man submarine,\n\nAnd flippered frogman bore.\n\nBringing with them the limpet mine,\n\nTrying to find a way,\n\nTo make a breach in the line we held,\n\nBefore the break of day.\n\nAnd after them, the Weasel,\n\nWith it's long low wicked prow,\n\nDriven by powerful engines,\n\nWith explosives in her bow.\n\nA tracer shot from some craft's bridge\n\nWould mark a German's wake.\n\nAll the guns would open up,\n\nAnd the very decks would shake.\n\nWe carried a lot of ammunition ,\n\nFor ships so small and tight,\n\nAnd when one blew, she would split the air\n\nAnd scar the summer night.\n\nWe could not think about their crews,\n\nAs now we may sit and sigh.\n\nFor we had to carry on the fight,\n\nAnd they, they had to die.\n\nI dont know how many craft we lost.\n\nSomeone must have the score.\n\nBut then it was many years ago,\n\nIn nineteen forty four.\n\nSo, take a trip from Oustraham,\n\nWith Le Havre across the bay.\n\nAnd when your nearly six miles out,\n\nStop for a while and pray.\n\nBarry McClory\n\nThe Forlorn Hope\n\nFog is down in England,\n\nWe must go in alone.\n\nAlthough we all would rather hear,\n\nOur fighter bombers drone.\n\nA cold November morning,\n\nAnd Walcheren lying dark.\n\nThe Oerlikons rapid splatter,\n\nThe Pom Pom's slower bark.\n\nShells cream the sea around us,\n\nAs we make our way inshore.\n\nThe Commandos on the beach head,\n\nAre asking us for more.\n\nAs we turn along the shoreline,\n\nAnother craft goes down.\n\nThe Close Support Squadron,\n\nContinues it's turn around.\n\nShe goes in flame and fury,\n\nThat enter the heart's core.\n\nThe remainder of the Squadron,\n\nStand in along the shore.\n\nThe Hospital ship has opened it's decks,\n\nAs the rescue boats come in.\n\nWarspite has now stopped firing,\n\nBut the cacophony and din,\n\nSeem to increase each pass we make.\n\nWe have nothing much to show,\n\nOur shells bounce off the concrete,\n\nOnto the rocks below."
