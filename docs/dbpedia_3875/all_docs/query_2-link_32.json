        "text": "Hi\n\nMy great uncle John Edward Thompson (Royal Marine) was killed aboard LCS (L) 256. His family believed he was killed at Dieppe however the CWGC and other records record him as being killed during operation infatuate, when the ship was sunk - furthermore the ship was built after Dieppe in 1943.\n\nUnfortunately, I can't answer too much about this but I am too looking for information relating to this gunboat.\n\nhttps://ww2talk.com/index.php?threads...unboats.49530/\n\nThe above link contains lots of helpful information, but there is not too much information about it's time in Scotland. Soon, I should receive John's service record and this may provide some information - I am unsure whether he was with the ship by D-Day or with another unit and had not yet been trained for gun crew service or whether he was even with LCS 256 by this date or not as I am only certain that he was onboard when he was killed at operation infatuate. Please let me know of any information that you may have and I hope that the link may be of some use even though it does not contain any information relating specifically to Scotland.\n\nOperation Infatuate\n\nThe force sailed from Ostend at 03:15 hours and by 09:30 hours they were off the objective. The ships bombarded the German defences with everything at their disposal\n\nincluding the 15-inch (380 mm) guns of HMS Warspite, Erebus and Roberts, the Landing Craft (Gun)s, the rockets of LCT(R)s. The first German fire at 8:09 was followed\n\nby the other batteries. Most of the German fire was concentrated on the support landing craft rather than those carrying the troops.[4] Several landing craft were\n\nhit including a rocket LCT which received a direct hit. The RAF was able to provide a squadron (No. 183 Squadron) of explosive rocket-firing Typhoon fighter-bombers\n\njust at the point the LCTs were due to land.[4]\n\nPart of the naval Support Squadron of 27 small craft, under Commanders Sellar and Leefe, closed to engage the eleven still-operational German shore-based batteries,\n\non the direction of Captain A.F. Pugsley, R.N., DSO, the naval commander of the amphibious landings. This they did with conspicuous gallantry, but with very heavy\n\ncasualties.\n\nBy 12.30pm, nine of the Support Squadron's craft had been sunk, eleven put out of action, and a high percentage of their crews killed or wounded.\n\nUltimately the Support Squadron was recalled as so many of the craft had been damaged or destroyed, but their aim, of drawing the fire of the defending batteries\n\nfrom the landing craft making the primary assault, had succeeded.[5][6]\n\nRoyal Marine Commandos landing at Walcheren using DUKW's, LVT, LCT's and Buffalo amphibians on 1 November 1944\n\nIn a tribute to the bravery of the Support Squadron, General Laycock, Chief of Combined Operations, wrote to Captain A.F. Pugsley with the following words:\n\n\"I understand that the success of the landings and the comparatively light casualties sustained by No. 4 Special Service Brigade at Walcheren was due largely\n\nto the heroic efforts of the Naval Support Craft who, at great cost to themselves, effectively silenced the coastal defences. I should like to express the\n\nappreciation of all ranks, Special Service Group, and particularly that of General Sturges and Brigadier Leicester and all ranks of No. 4 Special Service\n\nBrigade for the self-sacrifice shown by all naval personnel during the landings, which had such splendid results.\"[5]\n\nThe naval haul of gallantry awards was significant. Of particular note were the actions of Leading Seaman Owen Joseph McGrath who was Coxswain of a Landing\n\nCraft (LCP(L) 144) during the assault on Westkapelle. McGrath's citation for the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal (the highest award for gallantry available to\n\nnon-commissioned naval personnel short of the Victoria Cross) reads as follows: \"[LCP(L) 144's] duty was to make smoke on the Southern flank. Many craft were\n\nhit by the accurate enemy fire, and some blew up very close inshore under the enemy guns. LCP(L) 144 was ordered to close, make smoke and pick up survivors.\n\nThis was done at point blank range with an off-shore wind making effective smoke difficult. By his courageous action Leading Seaman McGrath rescued over twenty\n\nsurvivors\".[7][8]"
