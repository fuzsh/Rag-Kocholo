Chad Johnson at (330) 744-8451 or cjohnson@youngstowndiocese.org.\n\nSeptember 25, 2022\n\n26th Sunday in Ordinary Time\n\n“My child, remember that you received what was good during your lifetime while Lazarus likewise received what was bad; but now he is comforted here, whereas you are tormented. Moreover, between us and you a great chasm is established…” Luke 16:25-26\n\nWhen God created the world He declared that it was good and He gave it to all mankind for us to enjoy. However, over the years we have created a chasm between those who have great gifts and those who do not. In today’s Gospel we see that with our own generosity we must bridge that gap between those who have much and those who have little or we may find ourselves on the wrong side of the chasm in the next life.\n\nOctober 2, 2022\n\n27th Sunday in Ordinary Time\n\n“For God did not give us a spirit of cowardice but rather of power and love and self-control.” -2 Timothy 1:7\n\nMany of us compartmentalize our Faith, we bring it out only when we attend Mass or when we attend a parish event. Being a good steward requires discipline and striving to put God first in everything – all the time. The next time you are at a neighborhood party or at work or out shopping, would your words and actions signal to others that you are a good and faithful servant of our Lord?\n\nOctober 9, 2022\n\n28th Sunday in Ordinary Time\n\n“Has none but this foreigner returned to give thanks to God?” -Luke 17:18\n\nMost of us live relatively “easy” lives. We have food, shelter, clothing and money. We go on vacation every year and own a car or two. Most of us take this all for granted. Did you ever notice that people with the least amount of possessions are usually the most grateful? Shouldn’t this be the other way around? Take time every day and thank God for all He has given you and discern how He is calling you to share your gifts.\n\nOctober 16, 2022\n\n29th Sunday in Ordinary Time\n\n“…proclaim the word, be persistent whether it is convenient or inconvenient…” -2 Timothy 4:2\n\nIt is not always convenient to be a good steward, especially when all the temptations of our busy and materialistic world get in the way. Now add our own pride and ego into the equation and living a stewardship lifestyle may be downright uncomfortable! Remember, God didn’t call us to be comfortable. He never said that we would have an easy life. Rather, He called us to be faithful!\n\nOctober 23, 2022\n\n30th Sunday in Ordinary Time\n\n“…for whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and the one who humbles himself will be exalted.” –Luke 18:14\n\nPride and ego are the root causes of most of our sins. Thinking your time is so valuable or your talent is better than anyone else or your money gives you status is another way of making those things “gods” before God. Pride is the opposite of humility. Remember, all that we have and all that we are is a gift from God. We should be humbled by God’s incredible generosity and be grateful for all we have been given. Ultimately, gratitude leads us to humility.\n\nOctober 30, 2022\n\n31st Sunday in Ordinary Time\n\n“But Zacchaeus stood there and said to the Lord, ‘Behold, half of my possessions, Lord, I will give to the poor, and if I extorted anything from anyone I shall repay it four times over.’” -LUKE 19:8\n\nWe are all called to gratefully give back to the Lord in proportion to the gifts we have been given. This means everyone isn’t called to give the same amount, but everyone is called to give equal sacrifice. Open your heart and talk to God about how you use your money. How is God calling you to be more generous with your financial resources and possessions?\n\nNovember 6, 2022\n\n32nd Sunday in Ordinary Time\n\n“May our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who has loved us and given us everlasting encouragement and good hope through his grace, encourage your hearts and strengthen them in every good deed and word.”2 Thessalonians 2:16-17\n\nThere are two important lessons here.First, we are called to be generous with our encouragement and hope with others.As God shows us mercy, we must be merciful to others.Second, joy is contagious!The joy we receive from doing good works not only strengthens us, it encourages others as well.Share the joy of living your faith whenever you can.\n\nThe-Rosary-is-Alive: A Picture book for Children and Young Adults.
