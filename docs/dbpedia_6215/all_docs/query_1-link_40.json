It serves as an annual reminder of the importance of families and communities working together to prevent child abuse and neglect. The Catholic Church remains dedicated to being at the forefront of raising awareness about the scourge of child abuse, implementing the best policies and procedures to protect children from potential abusers, and working with professionals to bring healing to those who have been abused. During the month of April, you are encouraged to visit the diocesan safe environment webpage (https://doy.org/safe-environment/), where you will find reporting resources and access to our free online safe environment VIRTUS training. This online training provides information about the signs and symptoms of abuse and what steps you can take to prevent and/or report it.\n\nPlease take time this month to pray A Prayer for Healing Victims of Abuse, which is provided by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.\n\nGod of endless love, ever caring, ever strong, always present, always just: You gave your only Son to save us by his blood on the cross. Gentle Jesus, shepherd of peace, join to your own suffering the pain of all who have been hurt in body, mind, and spirit by those who betrayed the trust placed in them. Hear the cries of our brothers and sisters who have been gravely harmed, and the cries of those who love them. Soothe their restless hearts with hope, steady their shaken spirits with faith. Grant them justice for their cause, enlightened by your truth. Holy Spirit, comforter of hearts, heal your people’s wounds and transform brokenness into wholeness. Grant us the courage and wisdom, humility and grace, to act with justice. Breathe wisdom into our prayers and labors. Grant that all harmed by abuse may find peace in justice. We ask this through Christ, our Lord. Amen.\n\nUniversal Prayer:\n\nOne or more of the following petitions should be included with your Universal Prayers on the weekend of Sunday, April 30th.\n\nFor victims of child abuse and neglect, may God help to free them so that they may live safely in the peace of Christ….we pray to the Lord.\n\nFor children suffering physical, emotional, or sexual abuse, may they be delivered into the compassion of the Lord….we pray to the Lord.\n\nFor all victims, may they feel neither guilt nor shame, but have the courage to seek help in order to free themselves from all that ails them….we pray to the Lord.\n\nFor perpetrators of child abuse or neglect that they may stop and seek professional help….we pray to the Lord.\n\nFor those who witness abuse or neglect, that they may understand that abusive behavior is never an expression of love, is never acceptable, and must never be tolerated….we pray to the Lord.\n\nFor our community of faith, that we may become compassionate and sensitive towards victims as Jesus would be….we pray to the Lord.\n\nFor an end to all child abuse and neglect, that all of us may be an instrument of peace, a beacon of light, and source of healing….we pray to the Lord.\n\nCHURCH AT HOME COMBINED COLLECTION (Bulletin Materials) -NEW\n\nJUNE 3/4, 2023\n\nThe Diocese of Youngstown will be participating in the Church at Home Combined Collection the weekend of June 3/4. This important collection supports the Catholic Campaign for Human Development, USCCB Catholic Communications Campaign, and The Catholic University of America/Newman Apostolate. Please see the suggested bulletin and pulpit announcements in this month’s Communique attachments for more information.\n\nPARISH BULLETINS/PUBLICITY\n\nSUGGESTED BULLETIN/PULPIT ANNOUNCEMENTS\n\nWeekend of May 27/28\n\nNext weekend, parishes in the Diocese of Youngstown will hold the annual CHURCH AT HOME combined collection. This three-in-one collection supports the national and local work of three important Church ministries. The Catholic Campaign for Human Development works to break the cycles of poverty by providing local and national support for low-income people with a hand up, not a hand out. The USCCB Catholic Communication Campaign helps the Church spread the Gospel message through local and national media. The Catholic University of America and Newman Campus Ministries supports educational and research programs and develops future leaders at the national university of our Catholic Church. Please prayerfully consider a generous donation.\n\nWeekend of June 3 / 4\n\nThis weekend our parish will participate in the combined collection to support the local and national work of three major CHURCH AT HOME ministries: The Catholic Campaign for Human Development, the USCCB Catholic Communication Campaign, and the Catholic University of America and Newman Campus Ministries. Please give generously.\n\nWeekend of June 10 / 11\n\nThank you for your support last weekend of the Diocese of Youngstown CHURCH AT HOME combined collection which supports the Catholic Campaign for Human Development, the USCCB Catholic Communications Campaign, and the educational and research ministries of the Catholic University of American and Newman Campus Ministries. If you were unable to give last weekend, please consider giving at your parish today for this important collection.\n\nTHE CATHOLIC ECHO MAGAZINE IS ARRIVING! -NEW\n\nThe first issue of The Catholic Echo magazine is expected to arrive at most registered households the first week of May. Extra copies will be sent directly to the parish for new parishioners who may have joined the parish recently and are not yet in our database. The diocese will send a request for updates to the database in September. (Please hold off sending updates until then.)\n\nFor magazines sent to the parish: We ask that you place magazines in the backs of your churches on the weekend of May 6/7, after the majority of parishioners receive the magazines in their homes. If you find you need more or fewer magazines for the back of your church next month, just let me know and we’ll adjust your bulk order.\n\nWe are asking that you make an announcement at all Masses the weekend of April 29/30 and the following weekend (May 6/7):\n\nAnnouncement – April 29/30:\n\nThe Catholic Echo is arriving! Be sure to look for the 1st edition of the Catholic Echo, our diocese’s new magazine, in the mail this week.\n\nThe Catholic Echo is replacing the Catholic Exponent. Every registered household in the parish will be receiving a copy: most should receive them this week. Be sure to take a look at “The Catholic Echo” when it arrives.\n\nAnnouncement – May 6/7:\n\nHave you received the first edition of “The Catholic Echo, our diocese’s new magazine? The Catholic Echo is replacing the Catholic Exponent. Every registered household in the parish will be receiving a copy – but if you are a new parishioner and haven’t received yours, please find extra copies in the back of Church.\n\nAdditional Information for Parish Offices:\n\nPlease remember to email Katie Wagner, Editor-In-Chief with any major parish initiatives happening that might be included in future editions – kwagner@youngstowndiocese.org. The Catholic Echo magazine, website and supporting multimedia products will highlight all aspects of Catholic life across the six counties of the diocese.\n\nMore information about the financial support for the Catholic Echo from your parish will be coming soon from the diocese’s Finance Office.\n\nWe encourage all parishes to put a link to the Catholic Echo website, CatholicEcho.org– on your parish home page. The Catholic Echo includes up-to-date news, an email newsletter, along with video programming, the Wineskins podcast, local Catholic news stories, event information and much more.\n\nCATHOLIC TV YOUNGSTOWN UPDATES -NEW\n\nHappy Easter! As the Church continues to celebrate this great season of resurrection, enlightened by the Risen Christ, I want to thank you for journeying with our multimedia ministry in the Diocese of Youngstown. In the past few months, we have again produced our coverage of the annual Chrism Mass, narrated by Father Jim Korda, and our weekly Our Sunday Mass, including Easter Sunday with Bishop David Bonnar. Our radio program Wineskins continues to be available on the radio and now also podcasting on Spotify. And we are gearing up now for coverage of upcoming events, including ordinations in June. You can find all of our past and upcoming video and multimedia at the new Catholic Echo website at www.catholicecho.org/live/\n\nOn TV, our cable channel is taking a new name: “CatholicTV Youngstown,” in close collaboration with our longtime national partner, CatholicTV. This remains a local station, with local programs and events, while also featuring programs from CatholicTV that are favorites for our viewers.\n\nAs you know, our channel remains on the air for Armstrong customers, but not on Spectrum. We continue to work to get it reconnected for Spectrum customers, and in close collaboration with “CatholicTV.” We have been told that, unfortunately, this process will continue into the summer. We apologize for this long period of waiting. When we are reconnected, our channel number for Spectrum will change. We will contact you when we know the new channel number.\n\nIn the meantime, the Mass continues to be available in the following places:\n\nTelevision in Youngstown, Warren, Mahoning Valley:\n\nWFMJ TV-21: Sundays at 6am\n\nArmstrong Cable Channel 45: Sundays at 8am, 12pm, 7pm\n\nTelevision in Stark County:\n\nSpectrum in Canton Channel 989, Massillon Cable Channel 128, and WIVM TV-39: Sundays at 9:30am\n\nOnline: At catholiecho.org/live/ and at facebook.com/DOYoungstown/\n\nThank you to our community. We remain committed to serving you however you connect with us. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Justin Huyck, Director of Communications, at (330) 744-8451, ext. 320.\n\n2. Social media helpful hint of the month – Be sure to interact and monitor! -NEW\n\nOften, people may think that “being on social media” for the parish, school, office or agency is like putting a flier up on a bulletin board and leaving it. However, even with bulletin boards, you must periodically check to see if anyone wrote on or ripped the fliers. Likewise, someone must monitor the account at least weekly to assure that only appropriate content is visible.\n\nWith social media, the point of being “social” is to have interaction. That means when people comment or ask questions on a post, they need a timely reply to stay engaged with your page/account. (It is the newer version of leaving someone a voicemail message and awaiting a response, except for younger people, there is an expectation of a quick reply.)\n\nYou must also monitor for any negative comments that do not meet the purpose of your post. If there appears to be a “teachable moment” that responding to the comment might help clear up any confusion or gently correct inaccurate information (this is after all part of the Spiritual Works of Mercy in our faith!) then take it! But there will be times when you may need to hide or delete comments. It can be counter-productive to your social media mission for visitors to see a destructive chain. I do often direct-message the person who commented when possible to explain why the comment was being removed (often as simple as copying and pasting the page “rules.”) Here is how to do so on a few platforms:\n\nOn Facebook, click on the three dots to the right of the comment, then select hide, delete or report (if this is a continuous spammer or offensive content that you think Facebook needs to monitor.)\n\nOn Instagram, slide the message to the left to reveal the trashcan icon to discard the comment.\n\nOn Twitter, click on the three dots to the right of the comment, then scroll down the pop up menu to “hide reply” or “block” as desired.\n\nOn LinkedIn, click on the three dots to the right of the comment, and click on “delete” in the menu.\n\nOn YouTube, click on the three dots to the right of the comment and select “remove” from the menu.\n\nIf a person continually posts inappropriate comments, you may need to block them. This seems to happen on the diocesan Facebook and Instagram accounts mostly with “fake accounts” (i.e. those posting about getting your air ducts cleaned or asking for friend requests outside the country.) As your account reaches more and more people, unfortunately, that means the bots and spammers will find you.\n\nIf you have a team working on social media, consider dividing up monitoring duties; Person 1 can check posts every Monday, Person 2 can check on Wednesdays and Person 3 can check on Fridays or Saturdays. It need not be an arduous task, but it is important to make sure that our pages/profiles/boards/feeds uphold our Catholic mission and help to present our parish, school, office or agency as a place of Good News!\n\nIf you have other ideas for the monthly Helpful Hints, please let Cindee Case, ccase@youngstowndiocese.org, know.\n\nPriest Anniversary and Retirement Celebration -NEW DETAILS\n\nThe annual Priest Anniversary Celebration will be on Wednesday, May 10, 2023 at Saint Jude Church in Columbiana.

This collection will be held every year on the Fourth Sunday of Easter or Good Shepherd Sunday, which this year is April 30, 2023. The Vocations Office will supply envelopes to all parishes that need them. Questions or inquiries can be directed to Fr. Chad Johnson at 330-744-8451 or cjohnson@youngstowndiocese.org.\n\nSee this month’s attachments folder with information from the Office of the Chancellor: Seminarian Support Collection about bulletin and pulpit announcements.\n\nPARISH BULLETINS/PUBLICITY\n\nPARISH BULLETIN/PULPIT ANNOUNCEMENT (REVISED)\n\nThis year we are adding a special collection for Seminarians. With the added number of vocations and ordinations this year, we are in the midst of a good problem. Yet, with an increase in vocations comes an increase in education expenses and opportunities to participate in important ministry experiences. Your generosity will help ensure that our future priests will receive the very best formation as they look forward to serving in our parishes.\n\nThis year, through the gracious support of Catholic Extension, every dollar will be matched on a 1:1 basis up to $32,500 – so your donations will go even farther to support our seminarians! Thank you all for your continued prayers and support of seminarians and please continue to pray for an increase of all vocations.\n\nFor more information about seminarians in our diocese, or to give online, visit https://doy.org/seminarians/\n\nNew in the Library -NEW\n\nA set of Saint John’s Bibles were generously gifted to the library by the Knights of Columbus Reagan Council 1890. Please stop by and take a look at these beautiful books.\n\nThe Saint John’s Bible: Gospels and Acts. Donald Jackson, designer. Liturgical Press, 2005. The first of seven full-color, page-by-page reproductions from The Saint John’s Bible, Gospels and Acts has more than 25 illuminations, including full-page opening illuminations for each of the four gospels. Some of the prominent illuminations include the Genealogy of Jesus, the Birth of Christ, the Raising of Lazarus, the Crucifixion, Christ Our Light, the Last Supper, the Road to Emmaus, and Pentecost.\n\nThe Saint John’s Bible: Psalms. Donald Jackson, designer. Liturgical Press, 2005. Visual representations of chants from Benedictine, Native American, Muslim, Taoist and other traditions are the basis for illuminations of the Psalms. The varying pitch of the chants is rendered graphically to provide a motif for the abstract illumination. Every Psalm page features a small gold image that graphically renders the chanting of the monks from Saint John’s Abbey. This process of reading of the Psalms is a continuous reminder that the Psalms are to be sacred songs “and that in such singing God is present.”\n\nThe Saint John’s Bible: Pentateuch. Donald Jackson, designer. Liturgical Press, 2006. The third of seven full-color reproductions from The Saint John’s Bible, Pentateuch is foundational to both Judaism and Christianity. Pentateuch features text and illuminations of the first five books of the Old Testament (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy) known as the Torah in Judaism. Prominent illuminations include Creation, Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve, Jacob’s Ladder, Abraham and Sarah, the Ten Commandments and the Death of Moses.\n\nThe Saint John’s Bible: Prophets. Donald Jackson, designer. Liturgical Press, 2006. Prophets includes artistic depictions from Isaiah, Ezekiel, Jeremiah, Micah, Amos, Daniel, and Zechariah. Major images are Isaiah’s Vision of the New Temple, Suffering Servant, Ezekiel’s Call, Valley of the Dry Bones, Daniel’s Son of Man, Amos ‘ Plea for Social Justice, and Zechariah’s Messianic Predictions. In addition, famous passages such as Isaiah 2:4 “He shall judge between the nations, and shall arbitrate for many peoples; they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more” receive special calligraphic and artistic treatment.\n\nThe Saint John’s Bible: Wisdom Books. Donald Jackson, designer. Liturgical Press, 2007. Wisdom Books includes some of the Old Testament’s literary masterpieces, including Song of Solomon, Ecclesiastes, and Proverbs. Also in this volume is the much-loved book of Job and two Old Testament works including the Wisdom of Solomon, which was originally written in Greek, and Sirach, which comes to us from the Greek tradition. Wisdom Books continues the work of earlier volumes, with a script created by calligrapher Donald Jackson specifically for this project. And the images are not to be missed. There are over fifteen large illuminations, among them the spectacular frontispiece for Ecclesiastes and another titled Creative Wisdom.\n\nThe Saint John’s Bible: Historical Books. Donald Jackson, designer. Liturgical Press, 2010. As the largest book in the series, Historical Books features more than twenty-five stunning illuminations as well as multiple text treatments and marginal details that dramatically depict the Bible’s inspiring and thought-provoking passages. Through beautiful handwritten script and elegant design, this volume illustrates how the grace of God’s justice and peace can rise from the most unlikely of places, reminding us that our redemption is always close at hand.\n\nThe Saint John’s Bible: Letters and Revelation. Donald Jackson, designer. Liturgical Press, 2012. Letters and Revelation is the final volume of the entire monumental project. It includes some of the most crucial works of all the Christian Scriptures: epistles traditionally attributed to Paul, John, Peter, James, and Jude, and the fascinating book of Revelation. Donald Jackson’s artistic vision lends them a new life and vibrancy for modern readers.\n\nRegional Respect Life Meetings -NEW\n\nThe Office of Pro-Life, Marriage and Family Life in conjunction with the Office of Peace and Justice has scheduled regional meetings for parish pro-life representatives, members of parish respect life groups and individuals involved in any pro-life ministry. These meetings are taking place because “the dignity of life in its earliest stages is threatened by groups proposing an amendment to Ohio’s Constitution for the November 2023 ballot that would enshrine and expand abortion at the expense of protections for preborn children and women” (Catholic Bishops of Ohio).\n\nPlease attend one of the four regional meetings which will take place from 7:00 to 8:30 p.m. on:\n\n– Wednesday, May 3 at St. Michael Parish, Canfield (300 N. Broad St.) in the Social Hall, which is on the south side of the church building,\n\n– Monday, May 8 at Immaculate Conception Parish, Ravenna (409 W. Main St.) in Tobin Hall,\n\n– Thursday, May 11 at Blessed Sacrament Parish, Warren (3020 Reeves Rd. NE) in Holy Family Hall, or\n\n– Tuesday, May 16 at St. Michael the Archangel Parish, Canton (3430 St. Michael Blvd. NW) in the St. Michael Room, which is in the lower level on the west side of the church building.\n\nIn addition, there is the possibility of attending a “virtual” meeting via Zoom on a date and time to be determined.\n\nFor more information or to RSVP contact 330-744-8451 ext. 272 or dschmidt@youngstowndiocese.org.\n\nPARISH BULLETINS/PUBLICITY\n\nDangerous Proposed Amendment to Ohio Constitution would Enshrine & Expand Abortion (Bulletin Materials)\n\nThe Catholic Bishops of Ohio have issued a letter about a proposed amendment to Ohio’s Constitution for the November 2023 ballot which threatens life in its earliest stages (see “Attachments” section of this Communique at bit.ly/may2023comm). The Bishops strongly encourage Catholics and all people of good will in Ohio to work against including the proposed amendment for the November ballot and, if it appears on the ballot, vote against the amendment to prevent countless deaths of preborn, innocent children.\n\nThe Catholic Conference of Ohio is working with dioceses to coordinate a campaign to promote the dignity of life at every parish in Ohio. They will also collaborate with other Ohio organizations to defeat the amendment. More information and materials will become available as they mobilize to oppose the proposed amendment in the months ahead.\n\nThis dangerous and extreme amendment would annihilate parental rights and measures currently in place to protect young girls. It would abolish current Ohio law guaranteeing parental involvement before any abortion is performed on their minor daughter. It also removes critical health and safety protections for Ohio women that are currently in place. If this amendment passes the wellbeing of Ohio’s women and girls would be sacrificed so that the abortion industry can bring to Ohio painful abortions up until the moment of birth.\n\nFor more information contact Office of Pro-Life, Marriage and Family Life at call 330-744-8451 ext. 272 or dschmidt@youngstowndiocese.org.\n\nPlease Pray for the Defeat of the Proposed Pro-Abortion Amendment to the Ohio Constitution\n\nPro-abortion groups are proposing an amendment to the Ohio Constitution which would enshrine and expand abortion at the expense of protections for preborn children and women. Please pray at 7:14 a.m. and 7:14 p.m. each day until the amendment is defeated. Why 7:14? Because II Chronicles 7:14 says:\n\nIf then my people, upon whom my name has been pronounced, humble themselves and pray, and seek my face and turn from their evil ways, I will hear them from heaven and pardon their sins and heal their land.\n\nIn response to the proposed pro-abortion amendment, our Catholic Bishops of Ohio have said:\n\nThe Church must not be silent and cannot remain on the sidelines when confronted with such a clear threat to human life. This proposal demands a response, and we strongly encourage Catholics and all people of good will in Ohio to work against including the proposed amendment for the November ballot and, if it appears on the ballot, vote against the amendment to prevent countless deaths of preborn, innocent children.\n\nThe Catholic Bishops of Ohio conclude their letter with the following prayer:\n\nGod our loving Father,\n\ngrant wisdom to those who govern us,\n\ncompassion and courage to those who work to defend human life,\n\nand safety and care to every human being.\n\nFor you alone who formed us in our mothers’ wombs,\n\nand who call us home to heaven,\n\nare God, for ever and ever. Amen.\n\nWalking with Moms in Need & INTO LIFE\n\nLast year Bishop Bonnar wrote to all pastors encouraging the implementation of Walking with Moms in Need in their parishes. This initiative from the USCCB is to help parishes come alongside and accompany pregnant and parenting mothers facing difficulties. Anyone interested in establishing Walking with Moms in Need in their parish or region may contact Dave Schmidt in the Office of Pro-Life, Marriage and Family Life at dschmidt@youngstowndiocese.org or 330-744-8451 ext. 272.\n\nINTO LIFE – Love Changes Everything is a 12-part original series on accompanying a woman into life. The Sisters of Life and the University of Notre Dame’s McGrath Institute for Church Life teamed up to create an original 12-part video series based on the work of the Sisters serving women who are pregnant. Journey with the Sisters of Life as they explain what it means to walk with a woman who is pregnant and vulnerable. Learn what it means to deeply listen to and understand the heart of another, how to rejoice in the beauty of the individual person, and what it means to truly accompany someone into God’s life and freedom.\n\nINTO LIFE can be instrumental in establishing Walking with Moms in Need at your parish or school.
