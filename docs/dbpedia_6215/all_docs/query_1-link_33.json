Farther on aud close to tbe city in the suburbs are tbe ''Warm Springs.\" They re pleatant to bathe in during tbe en tire season. They are used fur bathing purposes, and commodious building are erected there for the purpose .\n\nIt is cleasant to bathe in the water at all seasons of the year without the aid of artificial beat. Bathing is indulged in to a great extent by most of tbe citi aens for medicinal purposes and Strang ers seldom visit Salt Luke without giv ing the spring a visit and indulging in a bath which costs each individual twenty five cents. Cottonwood Lake, within ten or twelve miles, abounds with mountain trout They are also very plentiful and it is only necessary to throw in a baited book to catch tbm and dt zens will eagerly bite it. You are sure of a trout every time yon throw in your hook. Utah Lake, about fifty miles from the city, abounds with Bilmon trout, weighing from ten, twel le and fifteen ponnds, and many thousands of the same are annually secured by sein, and afterwards packtdand salted, and .\n\nsold throughout tbe territory. Tbe City of Salt Lake contains a population of 20,000. But I must not forget that lam on a journey to and should not wander from, the route and therelore return to The hour for changing trains, etc. goon expired and \"all aboard was given, and soon tbe train was wending its way over the Great Central Pacific with the undersigned aboard of it. Promontory we reach fifty miles distant from Ogden .\n\nIt was here on the 10:. cf May, 1869 that the two roads were formally joined. By previous arrangenfents telegraphic communications were organized with the chief cities of the east and west, and, at a stated hour the lines were put in connection, and all business was suspended. At the time appointed 12 the road were here formally joined by ex Governor Sanford, President of the Central Pacific, who with the aid of a hammer, made of Arizona silver, gave the first tap on the head of the last spike made of California gold, and with the telegraph wires attached to the handle of the hammer it was so arranged that the news of tbe event was, at tbe first tap, 12 instantly communicated by telegraph to the inhabitants of tbe civilized world. The wiiier being present at tbe time will not Boon forget the scenes and incidents which transpired on that important occasion .\n\nEverybody seemed deeply interested, everybody seemed to understand that it was a grand event and that everybody Bbould be happy, and everybody was happy for tbe time being at least, and everybody indulged more or less in wines and other stimulants and there was a illy time generally. There were natives from almost every nation on the earth, present on this occasion and largely in tbe ascendency were tbe Chinese who, clad in their native costumethe broad brim bat, the overall shirt (worn outside the breeches) with their vooden shoes and peculiar dark complexion and \"pig-tail,\" attracted no little attention. Tbey were there in thousands and had a right to be there for they had, principally constructed with their labor tbe building of tbe road. And I may here add that what ever objections may be urged against tbe Chinamen they are a hard working class of men, and a general rule sober, induB trious, saving and reliable. A Chineman will do all he is engaged to do, and they make reliable help as domestics .\n\nToe principal objection urged against tbe Chiuaman is that be can live at such trifling expense that he can afford to work at much less figures than any other class of men generally. Although you hear complaints urged against Chinamen yet almost everybody seems to employ them. You can leave your house or other property entrusted to tbe care of a Chinaman and he will be faithful to his trust, No danger of him quitting his post or getting drunk. You will find him there on your return and. your property had been, in your absence, in safe bands, You will find the Cainamen now all over the couutry west of tbe Rocky Mouu taint employed from one to a hundred in every ranche, location, town, village and city .\n\nIt is very seldom you enter a dwelling or other habitation in tbe country referred to that you do not find \"John Chinaman\" with bis \"pig tail,\" wooden aboes and overall shirt at work in some capacity, most generally in tbe kitchen or tbe dining room. But we speed along over this flue road at the rate of thirty miles an hour, towards the metropolis of the west and facinc, and pass enroot hundreds of towns, villages, and cities with their chorchea, School houses, county buildings, among which the fallowing named are the most prominent Cor-tiniie Promontory, (the mountainex-tending into Great Salt Lake, and the Point at which the last spike was driven by President Sanford,) Monument, Hal-leek, Elko, Uarlin, Palasaids, Cltiro, Wlnnemnoca, Humbolt, Granit Point. Mirage, Hot Springs, Desert, Wads worth, Beno, Trnckee, etc From Granite Point, altitude gradually increases until the summit of tbe Sierras ko iwuuBu, mii feet above tbe sea level. tnis latter point with tbe Golden 8tate spread out in a panoramic view far below you, we rapidly descend the lofty Sierras, passing Emigrant Gap, vymiTuo, iuicn ist, Uald Kun, vrmaz.viipDerijap, Auourn, etc, Most ine latter named are well known niaing poinU; tha whole surface of the bumuhj -seemingly, washed out in the lne Pilous metal.

Io a few hours Utter we reached Sacramento, and afterafew minutes star we speed along and toward evening we are landed in the Cltv of Francisco, with a popula lionof 300 000, made up and composed of natives from everv clime and nation fifths known world. I Dut up at the Pulnce Hotel. The building is certainly ihe finest on tbe continent, if not in the world .\n\nIt occuoies one entire and com nlete block, and is one huudred and tntv feet hieh. It was originated by the great Pan flu banker, tbe lamented Woi. Ralston and Senator 8hnron. Tka latter is now sole proprietor, and a hrnther frnm Sniebenville, Ohio, its manager. The ex erior of this stately nd immense structure is verv imposing; the myriads of bay windows diversifying its four immense ironts irom top io uoi torn relieve the oppressive massiveness which wou otherwise cnaracter'zi it, This JstupendouB structure, including the side walks, cover nearly three acreo oferound .\n\nIt has seven lony stones nhivA the busement. and in some por tionsofthe building eight. Tbe height of the fi st story is over twenty-seven fee the uppermost sixieen. The build inir is reallv dunlex. a hue self-support ing frame of iron, of enormous strength, within masnive walls of brick and stone The other aud visible walls are proof airainstflre, while an inner and invisible frame secures against earthquakes .\n\nIt has one grind central crystal roofed gar-dan rvmrt. fl inked bv a lesser and par- rallel court on each side. The grand central court has a carriage entrance, expanding into a circular drive-way, sur rounded oy a maroie inea prciumim-iB. and a tropical garden of rare exotics, statuary, fountains, etc. The total num her nf rooms fr guests above the mar ble flwr is 735 .\n\nIt is provided with five lawe elevators, running from the basement to the roof. From the epacioiiB arcade promenade, surr mnding tbe lower trarduuflmr. broad entrances admit guests directly into the Dezir ironts oi the numerous elegant stores occupying tbe lower floor front along the several streets on which tbe hotel extends Each of these stores have show windows facing outward on the street and inward on the promenade, and ladies aud gen tlemen may indulge in shopping to their hears' content without ie-iving tbe building or without going from under the roi f. Within and without in all its approaches and appointments, and be longings of this great and magnificent structure, positively and without doubt, surpasses, not only in size but in grandeur, all tbe hotels on the continent, if not in Europe. I remained in San francisco one day and two nights only, and started to hunt upA'izonaand Camp Thomas .\n\nBut I made up my mind, however, before leav- ng the former city, thai Stanley, tue great African explorer, would hnd a large finld in his profession for active operations iii this, partialy tsplored territory; and I learnpd very soon af er my arrival at San Francisco that was only a land of promise, and that for mineral wealth; and for tbe prenent time it was not considered, by any means, a a desirable country to go to for pleasure purposes, and that the accommodation? for travelers were.not of the best order, Where to find Camp Thomas and my company was pretty bard to determine, for I could obtain no reliable iuforma tion on that Doint. But there was only one route before me to reach it, and that was Brut from San Francisco to Yuma City, over the Great Southern Pacfli! Railroad, a distance to commence on, of 725 miles, and then at the latter point learn further. I lefr, the former city in the evening and arrived in the latter on the morning of the second day rouie nearly south. Yuma City was then the termiMis of tbe Southern Pacific, but pushing forward to completion at the rate of three miles per day; and I may also add that Yuma City is at the end of any other railroad further south from civilization. I ba-ij raveled 3 599 miles from Pittsburgh to that point by rail, but the j-mruey was here at an end, and the balance of the uirney was to be performed by buckboard, 'jerky\" wagons and horses, and here at Yuma City, the journey actually commenced .\n\nContinued ntxt week. THE ENGLISH FARMER'S FUTURE. An American farmer, to whom the acquirement of laud is only a matter of so many dollars an acre, finds it difficult to understand the position of his EnglUh brother, who may never see a chance to sit \"under his own vine and fig tree.\" Thousands)of fertile acres await settlers in the great North-west. Farms are al ways in the market in tbe East; and their titles can be transferred without difficulty, and almost without expense, Hut very seldom does a piece of land come into toe market in tie BritisD I -lit 8nd when it does, it is so entangled in a net or deeds atiu mortgages, and leases, that a poor man cannot afford to pay for the inquiry which must bo made before the title can be called good. For example, iu December, 1877, a farmer of email means bought in Eugland tbree acres of glebe land with atithe rent of $75 a year, fend to pay over $580 for the ex amination estaolkhment, and transfer of tbe title .\n\nSuch an experience as this does not encourage a farmer to buy and. Bu' the land laws of Great Brit- ian, which Mr. John Bright recently de nounced in Parliament as stupid and mischievous, render it almost impossible for him to buy land even in this way. The general effect may be seen in tbe distribution of the laud. In England and Wales there are, in round numbers, 37,520,000 acres, and 17 500.000 acres, or nearly one-half, are owned by 4 550 persons .\n\nThree of these persons own acres. In Scotland there are 19,000,. 000 acres, of which 9,400,000 are owned by seventy persons. Tbe Duke of Sutherland owns 1,328,000 acres in Scotland, and nine-tenths of Scotland's area are in the hands of less than 1,700 per sons. One-balf of Ireland is owned by iesr than 760 persons, and two-ttiirds less than 2,000 .\n\nTbese numbers arc small in comparison tbe dense population of which they are part. Toese land laws now demand special attention oecause the influence of America has made farming iu England unprofitable, even, it is said, upou farms for which tbe landlords charge no rents. By tbe law of entail, which tnany people only know by tbe part it plays in the novels tbey readtthe land owner can, by deed or will, deed bis estate intact and from being sold for many years after his death, aud as his heirs usually renew tbe deed or. agreement, many estates have beon tied up in4his way fjr hundreds of years. This law witholds mach property from aood management and favors the imposition of i acuta braucee for wh ich tenants have to pay in increased rent .\n\nThe law of primogeni- it a tore and' the law which allows a land owner to make a lease for 999 years also tend to tie up estates and keep land out of the market. Another law gives to the landlord anything which a tenant adds to his farm such as a barn, a green- bouse, or a mill as soon as it is added, and works directly against agricultural Improvement. Bv tbe law of distress, the landlord recovers from a tenant who cannot pay his rent, without ordinary process of law-. He simply seizes enough of the tenant's cai tie or furuitureto satisfy the debt at publio auction, and those whom tbe farmer may owe for the cattle or furniture can do nothing. While the English farmer could make a living at home these laws could be endured; now, when he cannot, be must come to America, where farming pavs .\n\nand be will be seen ere long on the broad lands OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.

He gave notice before leav ing Washington, that he will expose tbe Louisiana fraud in all its iniquity, unless the balance of the money necessary to relieve his property is forthcoming immediately .\n\nSays the Post Casanave is prepared, too, to carry out his threat. He ruade a practice during the sittings ot the board in 1870, to take possession of all the documentsthatcanie in bis way, and be has preserved imim-r oils letters and telegrams which will throw light upon that dark transaction. He has a habit of taking notes of all important business matters, and he filled several books with memoranda of the Returning Board sessions. He is prepared to give a true history of the steal and to fortify his words with documentary testimony. He exhibited a few of his tell-tale documents here in Washington, and it is pretty safe to predict that tbe fraudulent Administration will send him the balance of the money he demands .\n\nThb Sandusky (Ohio) Regider (Rep expresses the general sense of tbe whole country, except the Miss Nancys, when declares that never was there any thing of the Civil Service order of Hayes, We quote from it: \"The N.

THE GENUINE DR .\n\nC. McLANE'S CELEBRATED LIVES FILLS, FOR THE CURE OF Hepatitis, or Liver Complaint, DVSFEFSIA AND SICK HEADACHE. Symptoms of a Diseased Liver. PAIN in the right side, under the edge of the ribs, increases on pressure; sometimes the pain is in the left side; the patient is rarely able to lie on the left side sometimes the pain is felt under the shoulder blade, and it frequently extends to the top of the shoulder, and is sometimes mistaken for rheumatism in the arm. The stomach is affected with loss of appe tite and sickness; the bowels in een- eral are costive, sometimes alternative with lax; the head is troubled with pain, accompanied with a dull, heavy sensation in the back part .\n\nThere is generally a considerable loss of mem ory, accompanied with a painful sensation of having left undone something which ought to have been done. A slight, dry cough is sometimes an attendant. The patient complains of weariness and debility; he is easily startled, his ieet are cold or burning, and he complains of a prickly sensa tion of the skin; his spirits are low; ana although he is satisfied that exer cise would be beneficial to him, yet he can scarcely summon up fortitude enough to try it. In fact, he distrusts every remedy. Several of the above symptoms attend the disease, but cases have occurred where few of them ex isted, yet examination of the body .\n\nafter death, has shown the liver to have been extensively deranged. AGUE AND FEVER. Dr. C. McLane's Liver Pills, in cases of Ague and Fever, when taken with Quinine, are productive of the most happy results .\n\nNo better cathartic can be used, preparatory to. or after taking Quinine. We would advise all who are afflicted with this disease to give them a fair trial. tor all bilious derangements, and as a simple purgative, they are unequaled. BEWARE OF IMITATIONS .\n\nThe genuine are never sugar coated. Every box has a red wax seal on the lid. with the impression Dr. McLane's Livkr mi.s. The genuine McLane's Liver Pills bear the signatures of C .\n\nMcLane and Fleming Bros, on the wrappers. Insist upon havinc the eenume Dr. C.
