        "text": "Probably the pups. They're undefeated and have clinched a home game. I don't think that they would just lay down for Massillon because of that. It's just too big of a game. Massillon has more incentive to win being that they occupy the last spot in the region to make it in and they control their own destiny. McKinley isn't going to make it easy for them, though. What a burn it would be for Massillon fans to not even get into the playoffs in their first season in D2, especially being that they feel they have a loaded team this year.\n\nIf Massillon wins they have a home playoff game. If they lose they are out.\n\nToo bad Big Red couldn't win one or two of their bigger games and get Massillon some 2nd level points. Those injuries against Massillon hurt them more than us. Weird how things turn out."
