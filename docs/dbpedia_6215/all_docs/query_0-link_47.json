        "text": "A collection of anecdotes from our reporters along the route of the 2013 Pro Football Hall of Fame Enshrinement Festival Timken Grad Parade in Canton on Saturday, marking the 50th anniversary of the Hall of Fame:\n\n‘THIS IS THE BEST ONE’\n\nCathy Gallagher is a parade connoisseur.\n\nShe’s been to the Rose Parade, she’s watched the Orange Bowl parade and all sorts of parades in Florida. She’s even taken in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City.\n\nBut when it comes to parades, Cathy wants to be in Canton the first weekend of August, not far from the house where she grew up, so she can watch the Pro Football Hall of Fame Timken Grand Parade.\n\n“This is the best one,” Cathy says of the festivities in her home town. She repeats the comment for emphasis. “The best one.”\n\nFor years now, the Gallagher family has set up camp along Cleveland Avenue N near the Bell Store, just down from 18th Street NW. More than a dozen people representing three generations, several cities and two football teams watched and cheered.\n\nMargie Irvin, one of Cathy’s sisters, came over from Alliance with her grandchildren and boyfriend, David Behney, in tow. She allowed Behney to come along even though he insisted on wearing a Steelers T-shirt. The Gallagher’s are Browns fans.\n\nBehney chimed in to help his kind when they took some ribbing from a Canton police officer who waved a Browns towel as he passed.\n\n“Booooo! Booooo!” Behney jeered back. “I saw that taunting.”\n\nA parade highlight for the Gallagers is watching their brother, Freddy, roll past in his vintage Corvette with a player aboard. — Edd Pritchard\n\nI REMEMBER WHEN...\n\nNot even the Hall of Famers elicited as much “I remember when” nostalgia as the Canton Park Commission’s “Save Mother Gooseland” float. The float featured the former city amusement park’s original Wizard of Oz and Humpty Dumpty characters as well as a replica of Willy the Whale.\n\n“I remember when I was little, I used to jump on Willy the Whale,” said Marquise Butler of Canton, who visited the amusement park when she was roughly 7 years old. “... All the other stuff is kind of foggy to me, but I remember the train and the whale.”\n\nShe also recalls when the park closed.\n\n“I was salty,” she said.\n\nButler, now 30 with four children of her own, said children nowadays need something like a Mother Gooseland or a water park nearby to keep them occupied.\n\nThe park district’s float was part of a $1 million campaign to revitalize the Mother Gooseland park in the 1400 block of Tuscarawas Street W. The first phase of a three-phase plan includes creating a dog park and a limestone walking path later this year. — Kelli Young\n\n‘HI HI. HI.’\n\nMcKenna Young, 3, had a neon-pink plastic lawn chair just her size, but she didn’t see any use for it.\n\nThe Alliance resident preferred to stand as close as she could get to the parade participants, waving her hands at them as they walked past.\n\n“Hi. Hi. Hi.”\n\nBut the bands and unicyclists weren’t the best part of the parade.\n\n“I like,” she said, pausing for emphasis, “the balloons!”\n\nMcKenna had a white whistle hanging from her left wrist, and she puffed on it to prove how loud it was.\n\nThe whistle didn’t make a sound.\n\nBut McKenna pulled the toy out of her mouth and gave a self-satisfied smile before she and her brother Landon, 5, turned their attention to something more important — watching the beaver balloon float past. — Alison Matas\n\nSEE IT ON TV\n\nFor those who missed the parade Saturday or who want to relive the action again, Fox Sports Net Ohio will broadcast the parade from 4:30 to 6:30 p.m. Aug. 11 and from 8 to 10 p.m. Aug. 14. The parade also can be viewed at 8 p.m. Aug. 13 on Time Warner Cable Channel 989, WIVM Channel 39 and Massillon Cable Channel 128. — Kelli Young\n\nPURPLE AND GOLD\n\nIt was a birthday present, but Sean McTaggart figures it probably covers Christmas and a few other gifts for several years to come.\n\nThat’s OK with the football fan from Sicklerville, N.J.\n\nSean roots for the Minnesota Vikings — has the team’s logo tattooed on his left arm — and is a fan of inductee Cris Carter. So the McTaggart family — wife, Sharyn, and kids Logan, Luke and Larissa — came to Canton to see Carter enshrined this weekend.\n\nThe family watched the parade, and Sean and oldest son, Logan, planned to take in the enshrinement Saturday night.\n\nHow does a guy from Jersey wind up a Vikings fan? Especially when everyone else in his family loves the Philadelphia Eagles?\n\nSean figures it’s the team colors. He was stuck with hand-me-downs from an older cousin who happened to be an L.A. Lakers fan. An uncle lives in New Orleans and often sent Louisiana State gear as gifts.\n\nThat’s a lot of purple and gold.\n\n“I think the colors just stuck,” Sean said.\n\nAs for traveling from New Jersey to Canton, it’s been a good trip from the McTaggart family, Sean said.\n\nThe big surprise: “How nice everyone is.” — Edd Pritchard\n\nFAMILY FEUD STAYS CIVIL\n\nCandy Henson held a cellphone in one hand and a pair of tongs in the other as she stood in the back of a Silverado, flipping turkey sausage on a grill.\n\nAlso on the breakfast menu for the Canton resident’s friends and family were scrambled eggs topped with cheese, which sizzled on a nearby skillet.\n\nThe truck staked out a spot on the parade route at 9 a.m. Friday. Henson’s family showed up at 11 p.m. that night, and no one had left — or slept —since.\n\nOn Saturday morning, the adults swore the overnight rain didn’t bother them, but the kids launched into a contest to out-yell each other about who got rained on the most.\n\nThe real problem, though, wasn’t the weather but the fact that Henson’s sister, Darla Price, was at the parade to cheer on the Baltimore Ravens. Henson likes the Cleveland Browns.\n\nBut Price offered a compelling argument for why an Ohio girl would switch her allegiances.\n\n“Her clowns ain’t goin’ nowhere,” Price said about Henson’s team, laughing. — Alison Matas\n\nBAKE SALE\n\nPepperoni rolls, peanut butter cookies and fudge were the big sellers at Gerri Pierce’s bake sale that was in the 1200 block of Cleveland Avenue NW. Pierce was raising money to renovate the former Domino’s Pizza shop at 1244 Cleveland Avenue NW into a new art studio. She now teaches art to students next door at the Hughes Kitchens & Bath, which she and her husband own.\n\n“I wanted to use the space and bring life to the city,” she said. “I want to see this area have a little life to it. I would like to see some color.”\n\nPierce hopes her art studio, which will be named Studio of Hope, could begin offering art classes to students aged 7 years in about a year. Pierce also wants to add a café and provide framing and matting at the studio.\n\n“We’re in the very beginning stages,” Pierce said. “... It has to be gutted and painted on the outside.” — Kelli Young\n\nSINGING IN THE SEASON\n\nAnthony McNeill burst into song when he saw two dedicated Washington Redskins fans among participants in The 12th Man Float, where the loudest — in attire at least — fans march.\n\nThat would be the Redskins fight song, of course.\n\nAnd the 12th Man participants sang right along with McNeill, a dedicated Redskins fan from outside of Richmond, Va.\n\nThe nephew of Hall of Fame store employee Madeline Harris, McNeill has been coming to Hall of Fame festivities for the past 20 to 25 years. He usually watches the parade from a vantage point near the Kempthorn Automall, where his uncle Raymond Harris recently retired after 35 years.\n\nComing to Canton means good times with the family, McNeill said.\n\nIt also means football season has arrived. “I’m a big football fan, so it’s a good way to kick the year off,” he said. — Edd Pritchard\n\n‘I HAD A HUNCH’\n\nFor Tim Davis’ 40th birthday, his wife surprised him with a 13-hour car trip to Canton.\n\nHusband and wife, along with their sons, drove from Fairmont, Minn., to see Cris Carter in the parade. They only planned to stay for the weekend.\n\nLynn and Tim donned purple Vikings gear for the occasion. Sons Tyler and Carter sported Twins sweatshirts instead.\n\nThe parade was their first activity on the Hall of Fame birthday-weekend adventure, as they spent Friday recuperating at the hotel.\n\nAll four still looked a little dazed at 7:30 Saturday morning as they stood on a mostly empty Cleveland Avenue — but, to their credit, it was only 6:30 a.m. Minnesota time.\n\nDespite Lynn Davis’ good intentions, Tim Davis wasn’t exactly shocked to find himself in Ohio this weekend.\n\n“I just had a hunch,” he said. — Alison Matas\n\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY\n\nFor Hayle Dazey and Elizabeth Thornsley, the parade was the beginning of their birthday celebrations. With a “Happy Birthday” balloon tied to their stroller, Hayle, who turned 2 years old Thursday, and Elizabeth, who turned 1 Friday, watched wide-eyed as the floats passed.\n\nTheir mother, Contessa Thomas, said the girls already are becoming parade veterans, as she brought both of them to the route when they were newborns. She said the family was going to continue the birthday celebration back at their Canton home with cake and ice cream. — Kelli Young\n\nFROM A DISTANCE\n\nAway from the crowds on Cleveland Avenue, Janet Martin set up her folding chair on the steps of the Cultural Center, observing the festivities from a distance.\n\nThe rain kept Martin’s daughter and grandchildren from coming to the parade, but she showed up, anyway — she just left the doughnuts she’d purchased for the kids at home.\n\nShe was hoping to see Cris Carter because, she said, she grew up with his mother in Troy, and she was wearing her Ohio State pullover to show her support.\n\nMartin moved to Canton in 1968. By her count, she’s been to about 45 parades.\n\n“I wouldn’t have missed one,” she said. — Alison Matas\n\nAFTERMATH\n\nFood wrappers, religious leaflets, half-eaten sandwiches and doughnuts, plastic caution tape and even folding chairs and a broken umbrella were scattered along the sidewalks of Cleveland Avenue NW in the aftermath of the parade.\n\nCanton City workers armed with leaf blowers walked along the sidewalks to blow the trash into the roadway for the street sweepers to push into a pile. A front loader then scooped up the piles and deposited the trash into the bed of a dump truck.\n\nBy the end of the 2.2-mile route, crews had filled at least one truck bed to the top. — Kelli Young"
