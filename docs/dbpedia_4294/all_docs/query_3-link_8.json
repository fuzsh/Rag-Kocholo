        "text": "València (officially Comunitat Valenciana) is a territory in eastern Spain inhabited by five million people where both Catalan (officially known as Valencian in this territory) and Spanish or Castilian (castellà, i.e. Castilian, is the traditional name of the Spanish language in València and the other Catalan-speaking lands) are official languages. The official use of Catalan was banned in València in 1707, but restored in 1983, after democracy finally arrived in Spain. From 1983 to the present, Catalan has made significant legal advances, among them the reinstatement of the original Catalan/Valencian official names of the municipalities, most of which had been adapted or translated into Castilian/Spanish after 1707. Nowadays, 396 of the 542 municipalities of València belong to the Catalan-speaking area, and most of these have adopted a Catalan official name; 32 of them, however, have chosen a bilingual name; and 48 have kept the Castilian/Spanish form untouched or simply have not adapted their name to the modern orthographic rules of Catalan –among these is the territory’s capital, the city of València (officially Valencia). These anomalies will be reflected in a series of GIS maps, in which we will show patterns that are repeated, such as municipalities with Catalan names that have never been altered; municipalities with an original Catalan name that was once translated or adapted into Spanish and where, later on, the Catalan name was reinstated; municipalities which nowadays have bilingual place names; municipalities where the original Catalan name has never been reinstated, etc."
