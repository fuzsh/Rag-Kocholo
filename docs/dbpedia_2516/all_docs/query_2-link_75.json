        "text": "Someday your child may cry\n\nAnd if you sing this lullabye\n\nThen in your heart\n\nThere will always be a part of me\n\nBilly's ballad \"Lullabye (Goodnight, My Angel)\" is a dreamy and contemplative song about our connection with our children or other loved ones. Billy's little girl Alexa, who was about seven years old at the time, had asked Billy what will happen when he dies. He reassures her that \"wherever you may go, no matter where you are, I never will be far away.\" And later that he will continue to live through her, \"someday your child may cry, and if you sing this lullaby, then in your heart, there will always be a part of me.\"\n\nBilly explained that he told Alexa that \"when we die, you go into other people's hearts, you never really go away. You go into the rest of the people that you know, go to the rest of their lives . . . .\" Billy has said that he believes that when you die, you go into the hearts of your loved ones. Billy talks about the song and its special meaning between him and Alexa in this snippet from SiriusXM. Click player below:\n\nâ€‹ In addition, this was around that time Billy and his wife Christie were separating and eventually divorced, and the song was a way for Billy to express to young Alexa that he would always be there for her. As Alexa stated in an Instagram post in 2022: \"this song was his way of reassuring me that he would never leave me; that I would always be a part of himâ€¦ no matter what. Thatâ€™s the kind of love that transcends space and timeâ€” for a melody like this; as sacred, storied, and beloved as an ancient hymn: it carries on through the ages forevermore. â€˜Someday weâ€™ll all be gone, but lullabies go on and onâ€¦ they never die, thatâ€™s how you and I will be.'\" ðŸ•Š\n\nâ€‹\n\nAlexa discusses \"Lullabye' on SiriusXM"
