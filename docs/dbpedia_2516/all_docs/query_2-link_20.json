        "text": "The next two albums overlap a bit in their studio recording dates.\n\nColtrane left Monk's working band to rejoin Miles' group. With Cannonball and the rest of the band, they enter Columbia's 30th Street studio on February 4, 1958 to begin work on Milestones. But they don't finish recording until they return on March 4. In the meantime, Coltrane and the Red Garland Trio go down to Rudy's on February 7 to record:\n\nJohn Coltrane - Soultrane\n\nPrestige 7142\n\nRecorded February 7, 1958\n\nAt Rudy Van Gelder's Hackensack home studio\n\nWith Red Garland (p), Paul Chambers (b), Art Taylor (dr)\n\n1. Good Bait\n\n2. I Want to Talk to You\n\n3. You Say You Care\n\n4. Theme for Ernie\n\n5. Russian Lullaby\n\nIn my experience, people who like Coltrane but don't have many of the Prestige albums tend to have this one. It was the last record he made for Prestige that was released in the year it was recorded, with Trane's involvement.\n\nThis is most notable, perhaps, for Ira Gitler's first use of the phrase \"sheets of sound\" in the liner notes.\n\nRed begins \"Russian Lullaby\" with an out-of-tempo introduction before Trane comes ripping in. Taking this and \"Soft Lights and Sweet Music\" as evidence, it would seem that the boys like to play their Irving Berlin at high velocity. I'm sure this \"Lullaby\" would keep Nikita awake and swinging all night. Trane's \"sheets of sound\", which he has since put to wider use, are demonstrated in the beginning of the tag.\n\n​\n\nAnd indeed they are! Gitler also notes that Coltrane has shed the influence of Sonny Rollins to become his equal and an influencer in his own right.\n\nWhen reading The New Yorker, usually I am most amused by an S.J. Perelman gem, the cartoons or something in \"The Talk of the Town.\" In the May 17, 1958 issue, however, it was the jazz department that gave me my biggest guffaw when Whitney Ballet, in the course of reviewing a Miles Davis album, wrote, \"Coltrane, a student of Sonny Rollins . . .\". Of course, we know he didn't mean that Trane was going to Sonny's house, armed with a Klose book, for weekly lessons but the implication was clear, in this perfunctory dismissal, that Coltrane was indebted to Rollins for his style.\n\nIt is true that when Coltrane joined Miles Davis' quintet in late 1955, Sonny (the Rollins of that time and slightly before) was exerting a peripheral influence over him. Even this proved to be transient. The influences of Dexter Gordon (vintage 1946), Sonny Stitt, Stan Getz (certain facets of sound) and a general essence of Charlie Parker were more evident, even then. Since that time, Trane has developed along personal lines to become quite an influence himself. He and Sonny are parallel figures now, each contributing new ideas to jazz in his own way.\n\n​\n\nAnd so they would continue, as parallel figures and as friends, each a giant of the tenor saxophone and a towering figure in jazz history.\n\nWhat do you all think about this classic Coltrane album?\n\nGreat album name! I haven't listened to this one in a while, but I love it. I love the players here and the fact that it's a quartet setting in this phase of his playing. Art Taylor tends to get looked over but I think he's a fantastic drummer.\n\nLove this album! 'Theme For Ernie' is my favorite there.\n\nTotally missed this thread. I will add that I’ve found most of his 1949-1952 materially digitally and it’s of little consequence from a Coltrane perspective. Just a young kid playing sax in various big bands. You’d have a hard time picking him out. For academic interest only.\n\nThere is so much material on Prestige aside from the famous Davis sessions. I have managed to gather it all through legal digital download services, but as a listener I am still a novice. In general, I would say it ranges from good to excellent, and is essential listening compared to the earlier big band material. Now you really get a sense of Coltrane as an evolving soloist and leader.\n\nOne thing I really like about this era is that you get to hear Coltrane with some unusual instrumentation. French Horn, two tenor saxes, and guitar with the wonderful Kenny Burrell.\n\nI would highly recommend the three Prestige sets Fearless Leader, Interplay, and Side Steps as a way to gather up this material. Excellent masterings and when they were released made the material more accessible than the expensive, out of print complete Prestige box set. I managed to get Fearless Leader for $9.99 from iTunes a few years ago. What a steal!\n\nThe two Ray Draper albums are great. I don’t remember anything in particular about Coltrane’s playing, but his presence led me to appreciate Draper’s voice in jazz. He really elevates what would typically be a background instrument in a marching band or orchestra. Definitely worthwhile listens.\n\nRussian Lullaby is one of my favourite early Coltrane songs if only for Red’s intro."
