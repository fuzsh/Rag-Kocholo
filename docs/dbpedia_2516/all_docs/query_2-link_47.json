        "text": "\"Hot Dawg!\"\n\nMickie Quinn\n\nBluegrass. Klezmer. Jazz. Latin. Swing. All of these sounds, combined into one sound, will be heard on the stage of the Alice Statler Auditorium. The David Grisman Quintet comes to Ithaca on Monday, February 12. If you haven't bought your ticket yet, GO!!! RUN!!! NOW!!! Before it's too late.\n\nNeed convincing?\n\nDavid Grisman, master of the mandolin, has a unique resume. Grisman has blended all of his influences into a sound that he has named \"Dawg Music.\"\n\nWhile growing up in New Jersey, Grisman discovered his passion for the mandolin and bluegrass music. In the early 1960's, during the birth of bluegrass, Grisman was playing in the \"Kentuckians\" with Red Allen. In 1973-75, Grisman was involved with \"Old & In The Way\" -- a bluegrass ensemble featuring Vassar Clements on fiddle, Jerry Garcia on banjo and guitar, Peter Rowan on guitar and John Kahn on acoustic bass. Their release was recorded live at the Boarding House in San Francisco on October 8, 1973 by Owsley Stanley. The recording includes mostly originals, a couple of traditionals such as \"Pig In A Pen\" and \"Knockin' On Your Door\", and a couple of cover tunes including the Rolling Stones' classic \"Wild Horses\".\n\nIn 1990 Grisman started his own label -- Acoustic Disc in order to preserve his own artistic integrity and freedom. Many of his own recordings are on this label as well as those of other acoustic performers.\n\nGrisman's friendship with Garcia, and their ability to blend their sounds also led to many recording sessions. (David Grisman's mandolin appeared on the Grateful Dead's American Beauty track \"Ripple\"). Recordings continued during recent years in Grisman's basement studio. One released recording was the self titled \"Garcia/Grisman\". Over 20 tunes were collected on tape in 1990 during the sessions for this recording. Ten cuts were finally selected including their version of \"Friend of the Devil\", a Grateful Dead classic, Irving Berlin's \"Russian Lullaby\" and a collaborative song, \"Grateful Dawg\".\n\nAnother popular Garcia/Grisman collaboration was a recording of children's songs in the traditional folk style. \"Not For Kids Only\" includes the acoustic duo playing songs like \"Freight Train\", \"Hop Along Peter\", and Teddy Bear's Picnic. While the tape may be childrens' songs, the title says it all.\n\nIn 1994, Grisman's love and knowledge of vintage fretted stringed instruments resulted in a recording with Tony Rice, guitar legend. \"Tone Poems\" seventeen guitars and seventeen mandolins on seventeen tracks of mostly Grisman songs or arrangements of traditionals make this album a must-have for music lovers.\n\n1995 was a busy year for Grisman; three of his own albums were released. \"Tone Poems II\" with guitarist Martin Taylor, is in a similar format as the original, with one exception: this album is all jazz standards: from George Gershwin to Chick Corea, the best of jazz is captured on vintage instruments. Both albums include full color booklets with a history of each instrument played.\n\nExploring his heritage, Grisman got together with Andy Statman, clarinetist, and recorded traditional Jewish music. The album ranges from liturgical songs from hundreds of years ago to upbeat Klezmer tunes heard at weddings and celebrations. It also includes a 36 page booklet capturing Jewish life before World War II in Eastern Europe.\n\nAlso, in 1995, the David Grisman Quintet recorded their second album \"Dawganova\". This Latin inspired disc includes all members of the current quintet: Enrique Coria (guitar), Joe Craven (percussion, percussion), Jim Kerwin (bass), and Matt Eakle (flute, bass flute). A listen to this disc would be a preview to their live performance. Regulars such as the title cut, \"Dawagnova\", \"Claiente\", and \"April's Wedding Bossa\" (a wedding gift to Grisman's daughter) are all outstanding tracks. DGQ has fired up some Latin standards such as \"Tico Tico\" and \"El Cumbanchero\".\n\nThe live performance of DGQ is outstanding and I was fortunate enough to be in Portsmouth, New Hampshire the night of a performance and purchased two of the last remaining tickets. Each of the musicians could stand alone on the stage and easily impress a room full of music experts. Together they are a tight group with diverse talents that blend to create Dawg Heaven. Their atmosphere is laid back, and the music, energetic.\n\nHighlights of the show would include percussionist/multi-instrumentalist, Joe Craven. His rhythmic talents surface with his hand drums, percussion toys (i.e. maracas, rain sticks) and vocal percussion; he'll then step to the side and play mandolin -- for a couple of tunes, the violin will be his instrument.\n\nAnother memorable moment was the tribute to the late Jerry Garcia, a great friend of Grisman. DGQ gave their version of an Old & In The Way song, with Grisman apologizing for not having the same sweet voice that Garcia was well known for. The audience, made up of many young fans, rose in respect to this tribute and again at the end of the show during two encores.\n\nThis show encouraged me to dive deeper into Grisman's music. And with the aid of the World Wide Web, I discovered DawgNet- \"100% Handmade Acoustic Superhighway.\" DawgNet is one of the most thorough web sights I have ever seen. It gives the basics: tour dates, news, audio tracks. To go above and beyond, like everything else associated with Grisman, the sight includes the discography of everything released on Acoustic Disc, Dawg trivia and trivia contests for free CDs, reviews on Grisman's music, pictures and biography of Mad Max \"the dog behind the Dawg\", and on-line mandolin lessons.\n\nVisit the sight at: http://www.sfm.com/dawgnet/\n\nSo what next? 1996 will be bringing another release of the Old & In The Way recordings. Touring with DGQ. Perhaps the release of the recordings Garcia made in Grisman's studio weeks before his death.\n\nWhatever else happens, 1996 is bringing the David Grisman Quintet to the Alice Statler Auditorium on Monday, February 12 at 8pm. Tickets are available at Ithaca Guitar Works, Rebop Records, Micky Roof Jewelers, or by calling (607)277-2726 -- $12.50 for general admission/balcony; $15 for reserved; and $17.50 for special reserved.\n\nSee you there!"
