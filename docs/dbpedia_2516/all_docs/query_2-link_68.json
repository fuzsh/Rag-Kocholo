No singing, no jingling. Only Scrooge would be happy with that! It is a time for music to fill the air. Part of the fun is hearing things that are only played at Christmas and at no other time of year — carols that make you think of the end of term, or the holidays, or bobble hats; songs that make you think of food, or snow, or stockings. Here are some of the most popular carols, as well as some other surprises… Merry Christmas!\n\nOnce in Royal David's City 00:03:19\n\nThredbo Suite: III. Sleighride to Thredbo (arr. P.

He wasn’t taller or fatter than everyone else, but his music is big and his name is important. Beethoven is like the Olympic champion of classical music. Some of the music he wrote is strong and serious, and some of it is very gentle. Listen here to orchestras, pianos, violins and other instruments playing some of the most famous pieces of all!\n\nTrack listing:\n\nSymphony No. 5 in C Minor, Op. 67: I.
