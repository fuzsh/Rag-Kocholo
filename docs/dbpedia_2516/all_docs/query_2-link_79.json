Makin’...\n\nMmmh Big changes...\n\n‘Cause if you lift your head a bit more\n\nYou will see how beautiful this world can be whenever you get sad and lonely Just open your eyes...Walking down the street!Walking down the street, by walking\n\nDon’t loose time on things that would hurt you Looking forward’s better for you\n\nNever...\n\nLet that time go nowIt’s up to you to chase all the blues Nobody’s gonna do it for you\n\nLet it..\n\nShine through\n\nHanging out, we’re in another fightI just want you to turn up and walkHide those tears, you think that I’m pleased, how come we never agreed\n\nIt is so sad that after all those years\n\nNo one tries to stop the fights and the fears\n\nYour losing the north boy, you’re losing it!\n\nFlaming love, hatred’s above\n\nI just want you to give me more\n\nHide those tears, you think that I’m pleased, how come we never agreed\n\nIt is so sad that after all those years\n\nNo one tries to stop the fights and the fears\n\nYour losing the north boy, you’re losing it!\n\nLive, love, dream and funEnjoy your day from monday to sunday Live, love, dream and fun\n\nThose summer waves taking your soul away\n\nIt’s summertime, the sun is high in the sky\n\nThe day is mine, no place for doubtings and why suncream, cocktails, drinks, tanned skin\n\nLazy, nothing more to feel in\n\nHey!\n\nThe day is mine...\n\nHigh heels, sunset color of heat No breeze to refresh our bodiesIt’s time to live free\n\nFollowing pleasure and sun\n\nEverything has to be filled with color and fun Moving slowly, towards water and sand\n\nLet your soul be, enjoying further around\n\nIt’s time to live free\n\nFollowing pleasure and sun\n\nEverything has to be filled with color and fun Moving slowly, towards water and sand\n\nLet your soul be, enjoying further around\n\nSnap, snap, little girlTake possession of your surroundings\n\nSnap, snap, little girl\n\nWhen you’re walking down the street with your vibrant wiggleYou my sweet sunshine, won’t you ever do it right ‘Cause you turn my head upside down\n\n‘Cause you come then turn around\n\nYou my sweet sunshine, please stay here by my side And you’ll find what’s inside my heart, and never rip it outYou are my sweet sunshine\n\nBetter find what’s inside my heart because you are mine Because you turn my head upside down\n\nYou are my, you are my, you are my, oh\n\nRain drops fallI’m going to lose controlWhy don’t you just pay smallAttention to me\n\nHear me callLook at my broken soulOut of this deep dark holeCome and rescue me\n\nCan’t you see that I’m reaching out for youTake my hand and we’ll try something new\n\nI felt tallAble to break a wallThought we had touched the goalJust you and me\n\nNow I’m smallYou chose to let me fallLike an old used dollYou’ve abandoned me\n\nCan’t you feel that I’m still loving youIn my dreams we were meant to be two\n\nRaindrops fallI’m going to lose controlWhy don’t you just pay smallAttention to me\n\nHear me callLook at my broken soulOut of this deep dark holeCome and rescue me\n\nCan’t you feel that I’m still loving youIn my dreams we were meant to be two\n\nCan’t you see that I’m reaching out for youTake my hand and we’ll try something new\n\nIf you wanna know, how hard it wasSince you’ve been gone, all night long\n\nIf you really wanna know, how time can be long And how freezing cold, your mind can beThen just, listen to those words I say And pray for your heart to melt awayIt’s the broken heart lullaby\n\nFor you to realize it cries\n\nHow many wonders you can put in just one heart This one is broken from the start\n\nPain in my heart\n\nI put it there\n\nMade you believe you could love me\n\nthen made you not want to care\n\nThis pain in my heart\n\nthat burns down to my soul\n\nI’ll never let that women knowDomed from the start\n\nhow could I dare\n\nThink that you\n\nwere just a one night love affair\n\nThis pain in my heart\n\nthat burns down to my soul\n\nI’ll never let that women knowNever let her know\n\nI still love her so\n\nNever let her know\n\nshe will stay in my heart forevermorePain in my heart\n\nI put it there\n\nMade you believe you could love me\n\nthen made you not want to care\n\nThis pain in my heart\n\nthat burns down to my soul\n\nI’ll never let that women know\n\nI really thought we could’ve stayed friends But fate wanted us to partI told that I don’t understand\n\nThis way of holding me backI know I could have let things go\n\nIt is the hardest part of all\n\nIt is not the perfect time to tell you what’s on my mind I know we should’ve loved us so, that it can beThat it can be warmer\n\nOur skins getting closer\n\nI can’t forget you\n\nOur love is a chapter you won’t even remember I can’t forget you\n\nI know we could’ve cared at all Don’t let your heart break it and fall You left traces in my life\n\nWarmer, warmerI really thought we could’ve stayed friends But fate wanted us to part\n\nI told that I don’t understand\n\nThis way of holding me backI know I could have let things go It is the hardest part of allThat it can be warmer\n\nOur skins getting closer\n\nI can’t forget you\n\nOur love is a chapter you won’t even remember I can’t forget you\n\nWarmer, warmer\n\nIt’s crazy how it works when your feelings are lurked\n\nYou enlighten your face soon as mine starts to fade\n\nAnd meanwhile, taking a while, to catch a smile\n\nEasing up your days, sayin’ all is okStarting to believe you improved all the ways\n\nJuvenile, and so what maybe puerile, you catch my smileRather be happy than sad\n\nLooks like it’s stupid to say\n\nBut if you really make this effort your life will never be the same\n\nYou will look at everything brighter and nothing harder will remain\n\nYou’ll bet no game, no pain, no rain, smilin’!\n\nJust live your life no compromises!Never take it easy on something that could cause you pain\n\nDon’t doubt that only love will remain\n\nOnly catch a smile\n\nx4Easing up your days, sayin’ all is ok\n\nStarting to believe you improved all the ways\n\nJuvenile, and so what maybe puerile, you catch my smile\n\nDon’t doubt that only love will remain\n\nBut if you really make this effort your life will never be the same\n\nNever take it easy on something that could cause you pain\n\nOnly catch a smile!\n\nSmile!\n\nLook at the bright side of your life\n\nEnjoy every single time(said that angle there)\n\nPush your heart to be wildSometimes life ain’t easy\n\nBut you gotta keep hope and faith\n\nThis man left without any trace\n\nHe’s gonna be found anyway by his own mistakesI truly believe that if you live for the good your soul won’t bleed\n\nAnd giving as mush as your heart allows will bring love anyhowSmile, smile, smile, smile...\n\nI was so lonely, but you saved meNow I feel so confident\n\nWithout you anyway, (I) wouldn’t be there\n\nNow I feel so confidentI was so lonely, you saved me\n\nWithout you anyway, I’d be scaredOh oh oh oh...Confidence is something you work on all day\n\nMeans that I don’t need you every time anyway\n\nbut when you’re near I feel so better that way\n\nYou enlighten my strength and I can face life and say\n\nLay back just for an hourAnd hold on ‘till I get there\n\nYou say you feel you’ve got no powerJust let me in and I shall take care\n\nYour wings seem broken you can’t unfold them\n\nYour pain’s unspoken you can’t move on\n\nCool down let me embrace youBreathe in and welcome the air\n\nYou say you’ve got none to hold on toJust lean on me we’ve got so much to share\n\nYour wings will open just dare to move them\n\nAll pain that’s spoken is half overcome\n\nYou see life’s just like a flowerWaiting to bloom if handled with care\n\nCheer up, no need to cower\n\nGo on you‘re almost there\n\nYour wings wide open allow you to move againTo live in hope and then fly away"
