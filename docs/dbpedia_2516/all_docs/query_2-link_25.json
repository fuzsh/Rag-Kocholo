        "text": "Robert Hunter “Tales Of The Great Rum Runners” recorded Aug-Sep(?) ’73\n\nSometime around or just after August ’73 when the Dead recorded “Wake Of The Flood” at Sausalito Record Plant, Robert Hunter embarked on sessions for his own first solo album “Tales Of The Great Rum Runners” at Mickey Hart’s barn studio. Though Hart had been in self-imposed exile from GD touring and recording, there appears to have been a doozy of an ongoing party in progress at the barn. (Girlfriend Jerilyn Brandelius claims she once didn’t leave the site for a year.) Hart had a three album deal with Warner Brothers, of which “Rolling Thunder” was the first. Recordings continued 72-74 for future proposed releases (one working title; “Area Code 415”), utilizing the participation of some GD members, as well as Barry Melton, David Frieberg, Peter Albin, and John Cippolina, just to name a few. The Planet Earth Rock ‘n Roll Orchestra aka “PERRO” aka “Marin County Conglomerate” was still alive, partying, and recording. Song titles for Hart’s projects included “Speed Racer”, “Night Of The Vampire”, “Marshmallow Road”, “Ghost Riders In The Sky”, and even an early rap version of “Fire On The Mountain”. Warner’s ultimately rejected the stuff, but it still floats around in the ether.\n\nHunter’s album features several of the same players and edgy arrangements. I presume the aim was both Hunter’s artistic expression and possibly the very specific need for product on the new Grateful Dead subsidiary label Round Records. Round Records funding for solo projects was held in a separate coffer to the Grateful Dead album releases and a different label was used. Perhaps if Hart hadn’t been tied to WB at the time, he might have released something on Round?\n\n“Rum Runners” featured a commissioned Rick Griffin cover with imagery somewhat similar to WOTF. The album was released in tandem with the yellow “Garcia (Compliments Of)” and GD “Mars Hotel” album about nine months later in June 1974, and featured as a 3 song side on the first Round Records fan mail sampler (approx 26,000+ on the mailing list at the time) b/w tracks from the “Garcia (Compliments Of)” album recorded in Feb ‘74.\n\nThe album’s not as “smooth” musically as a GD release, but it had it’s own charm. Some performances border on spoken word, which is not surprising being a poet (but not as dodgy sounding as, say, Rod McKuen!) , but Hunter also cuts loose vocally in “That Train” and the pub cheer “Does God look down on the ‘Boys In The Barroom’?....mainly forsaken but surely not judged”. The song “Rum Runners” has a jaunty nautical lilt where one can almost smell the brine. Most will of course know “It Must’ve Been The Roses” which was soon assimilated into the 1974 GD live sets. Such a quaint and pretty tune, …until it sinks in that the girl (or her ghost) with the roses and ribbons in her hair sitting in the corner of the old seamen’s shanty has been deceased for quite a long while, “ ..and it’s strange how no one comes ‘round anymore.” (The tune also inspired a few post-show “It must’ve been the doses” sing-alongs.) I personally found the rhyming and content on songs like “Keys To The Rain”, “Maybe You’re A Bluebird”, and “Standing At Your Door” to be a bit different to the kind of songs Jerry honed into Dead songs. I guess that infers to me that not every Hunter song would make a Dead song. “I Heard You Singing” and “Mad” were recorded by Freiberg and Hart for the aborted WB album (and the former by Quicksilver in 1975), but pop up here instead. All a bit incestuous, huh? At any rate, it was an early opportunity to finally hear the elusive Robert Hunter barding.\n\nAnybody “Love That Bob”?\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom deaddisc.com;\n\nTales Of The Great Rum Runners\n\nRobert Hunter\n\nInitial release : June 1974\n\nRound Records RX 101\n\nRobert Hunter's first solo LP.

He’d caught back up with mandolinist David Grisman (who’d played on “American Beauty” and more recently heard overdubbed on a track on the Keystone album) who in turn brought Peter Rowan who’d played guitar with bluegrass great Bill Monroe. (Rowan also wrote “Panama Red” and “Lonesome LA Cowboy” played here and later covered quite successfully by the New Riders.) They set up at John Kahn’s house (with JK on upright bass) and soon played gigs that Spring from informal school performances, to small club dates, to a radio show, to a bluegrass festival. McNally’s book notes that OAITW could “warm up” for 3-4 hours, play for 2-3, then cool down for another two; possibly a couple nights a week with Jerry and John alternating with Saunders/Garcia nights, or Jerry on the road with GD. (No wonder there aren’t many tales of Jerry running amok in public or destroying stuff; he was PLAYING nearly every night of his life.) In June they did a small East tour and met fiddler Vassar Clements, who became the 5th member (and was also asked to play on the WOTF sessions). This quintet version was recorded (approximately 10 days before DP19 10/19/1973 Oklahoma) at the Boarding House SF in one of Owsley Stanley’s impeccable “audio journals”. Archive additions in recent years include “That High Lonesome Sound”, “Breakdown”, and a fairly recent download version “Old & In The Way: 10/8/73 The Boarding House, San Francisco, CA”. Tracks are a mix of traditional country and bluegrass (including “Catfish John”), as well as several Rowan songs (also including the beautiful “Midnight Moonlight”), as well as the Stones’ “Wild Horses”. ”. The original single album was released 16 months later as another of the Round Records solo projects (and had a song side on the second batch of Round Record mail samplers), and JUST HAPPENS to be the biggest selling bluegrass album ever; no doubt due to an army of inquisitive DeadHeads and the crossover appeal of several of the songs.\n\nAnyone wanna chew the fat or spin any yarns about OAITW? Anybody see OAITW*? (*there was also another Garcia/Grisman bluegrass outfit that toured in 1974 called Great American String Band. The membership alternated, but included Jerry Garcia on banjo/vocals, David Grisman mandolin/vocals, Richard Greene fiddle, David Nichtern acoustic guitar/vocals and Taj Mahal bass/vocals. Guest vocals included Maria Muldaur. Bass alternated at some gigs with Maria’s manfriend/husband John Kahn, … and Amos Garret may have been in there too?)\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom deaddisc.com;\n\nOld & In The Way\n\nInitial release : February 1975\n\nRound Records RX 103\n\nThe original Old and In The Way LP with Garcia on banjo and vocals.\n\nTracks\n\n• Pig In A Pen (Traditional)\n\n• Midnight Moonlight (Peter Rowan)\n\n• Old And In The Way (David Grisman)\n\n• Knockin' On Your Door (Traditional)\n\n• The Hobo Song (Jack Bonus)\n\n• Panama Red (Peter Rowan)\n\n• Wild Horses (Mick Jagger / Keith Richard)\n\n• Kissimmee Kid (Vassar Clements)\n\n• White Dove (Carter Stanley)\n\n• Land Of The Navajo (Peter Rowan)\n\nMusicians\n\n• Jerry Garcia - banjo, vocals\n\n• David Grisman - mandolin, vocals\n\n• Peter Rowan - guitar, vocals\n\n• Vassar Clements - fiddle\n\n• John Kahn - acoustic bass\n\nCredits\n\n• Recorded live at the Boarding House, San Francisco in October 1973\n\n• Recording engineers - Owsley Stanley and Vickie Babcock\n\n• Producer - David Grisman\n\n• Editors - David Grisman and Owsley Stanley\n\n• Mixed - Owsley Stanley\n\n• Sleeve illustration - Greg Irons\n\n• Sleeve layout - Raymond Simone\n\nNotes\n\nSleeve note by David Grisman. December 1974:\n\nI first met Peter Rowan on the school grounds at Union Grove, North Carolina in 1963. The following year, Garcia and I crossed paths in the parking lot at Sunset Park in West Grove, Pennsylvalnia. Back then we were all on a quest, searching out that 'high lonesome sound' of Bill Monroe, Flatt and Scruggs, the Stanley Brothers, and other idols (Vassar, among them). The music on this disc, recorded live at a gig, embodies the spirit of that original Blue Grass quest, and a genuine affection for that superlative acoustic blend of banjo, guitar, fiddle, mandolin, string bass and voice(s). We hope you dig.\n\nAn additional Owsley Stanley technical note is added for the CD release;\n\nEight microphones were used in recording - four in each channel, mixed live onto a Nagra tape recorder. Tape speed of 15 IPS with 'Nagra Master' equalization insured low noise on transfer to disc. Persons interested in this EQ sould read 'Master Tape Equalization Revisited' by John G. McKnight And Peter F. Hille, Audio Engineering Society preprint #865 (A-G)\n\nIn an interview in 1973 Garcia spoke of the formation of the group;\n\n.... It's been eight years since I've played banjo. We all used to be heavily into bluegrass, so we got together a little over a month ago, started playing and then decided, '*****, why don't we play a few bars and see what happens.'\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThat High Lonesome Sound\n\nInitial release : 1996\n\nAcoustic Disc ACD 19\n\nAcoustic Archive Series\n\nOriginal Live Recordings From 1973 - Vol. 1\n\nThe first of two archive releases of live Old And In The Way recorded in 1973.\n\nTracks\n\n• Hard Hearted (Jim McReynolds / Jesse McReynolds)\n\n• Great Pretender (Buck Ram)\n\n• Lost (Buzz Busby / Cindy Davis)\n\n• Catfish John (Bob McDill/ Allen Reynolds)\n\n• That High Lonesome Sound (Peter Rowan)\n\n• Lonesome Fiddle Blues (Vassar Clements)\n\n• Love Please Come Home (Leon Jackson)\n\n• Wicked Path of Sin (Bill Monroe)\n\n• Uncle Pen (Bill Monroe)\n\n• I'm on My Way Back to the Old Home (Bill Monroe)\n\n• Lonesome L.A.

You’ll note from the label that this was NOT originally called “Compliments Of..”, but it’s generally in use now to differentiate from the first WB “Garcia” solo album (and save much confusion). The two albums are VERY different animals, the WB “Garcia” being classic 1971 GD originals, and this latter RR “Garcia” being a 1974 stab at mostly R&B and jazz-tinged covers. It’s a pleasant enough lp if you’re not expecting “The Wheel Mark II”, with woodwinds and strings sometimes suggesting the 30’s sensibilities of “Wake Of The Flood. I’ve always harbored the notion that Victor Miscoso’s cover is a stylized interpretation of Garcia in front of a bank of music/bird emitting speakers.\n\nAs described in the deaddisc.com blurb below, Jerry’s bassist John Kahn set up a series of sessions (with some genre framework clearly pre-ordained) he felt might enrich or challenge Garcia’s vocal range or musical chops. If you’ve heard the extended version bonus tracks, there were a few obscure tunes attempted before this more eclectic and catchy final line-up was finalized. Chuck Berry’s “Let It Rock” is completely reworked into a fat loping bass funk, which survived into the Kahn/Garcia live sets, as did “That’s What Love Will Make You Do”. “When The Hunter Gets Captured By The Game” (Smoky Robinson for the Marvellettes) has some delightfully twisted chord changes, I only regret the last verse is missing (I guess they worked from the Marvellettes single?). Irving Berlin’s “Russian Lullaby” was Jerry’s choice and gets a sprightly acoustic treatment compared to the later dirgy live versions. I always thought this selection was a bit of Jerry tongue-in-cheek Cold War humor. Van Morrison, Dr John, and the Rolling Stones get a look-in too. A big favorite of mine is Peter Rowan’s haunting “Mississippi Moon”, appearing on the bonus tracks as a slow honky-tonk band arrangement before being worked up for the album with a dreamy clarinet, oboe and violin arrangement. (I also loved the ultra-slow-motion versions played by Garcia/Kahn bands over the next few years.) There is also “Midnight Town”, a rare Kahn/Hunter original with lyrics implying deeply personal but somewhat mysterious relationship.\n\nAt the time of release, I don’t recall reading anywhere who the personnel on the album were but it was pretty clear that it wasn’t a straight Saunders/Garcia/Kahn band, and it was also clear that Maria Muldaur was in the mix on “Let’s Spend The Night Together”. She’d become part of the extended Dead family via her relationship with John Kahn. What I didn’t expect to see in the credits was a visit from Geoff Muldaur and Amos Garrett, who’d duetted “Lazybones” on Geoff & Maria’s WB “Sweet Potatoes” album. Merl’s on a few cuts as is Elvis drummer Ron Tutt; soon to be a Legion Of Mary/JGB regular. Vocalists Merry Clayton & Clydie King, and super session guitarist Larry Carlton are in there too.\n\nThe American Round Records (label pictured) had a lightly embossed cover (to thwart counterfeiting), and faded on the end of “Turn On The Bright Lights”. The UK Kinney version featured add’l silver star roses on the label background. The UK back cover listed the songs (“…and more”), and indeed, “Turn On The Bright Lights” didn’t fade on the UK version. The cd version is the latter.\n\nAny uh, compliments for this solo elpee?\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom deaddisc.com;\n\nGarcia (Compliments of Garcia)\n\nJerry Garcia\n\nInitial release : June 1974\n\nRound RX 102\n\nGarcia's second solo LP.

The label set up in 1974 for solo projects. This album was titled simply Garcia as was the 1972 Garcia LP. It became known as Compliments Of Garcia as the word \"compliments\" was printed above the title on early, complimentary copies of the LP. This title was officially adopted for the 1989 release to match common usage and avoid confusion with the 1972 Garcia.\n\nThis was the second LP to be released on the Grateful Dead's record label - Round Records. The first release was the Robert Hunter’s “Tales Of The Great Rumrunners”.\n\nThis LP is often described as one for which Garcia chose some of his favorite songs but this is not the case. He discussed the LP during an interview in the early 80's.\n\nMost of those songs I didn't know, either, so I went in there like a studio vocalist, with the lyrics - most of them I'd only heard one or two times. That was one of the few times when I didn't really go on a trip about the material. I let John do the material selecting, except for a few suggestions like Russian Lullaby, which was one of mine. I wanted him to have something to do. I enjoy working with him and it's one of those things that he can do, and it's one of those situations that doesn't happen to him much in the other parts of his musical life ... John and I share such similarities of taste, something that I like John is almost sure to like it. We're very like each other musically. That's one of the reasons I've been playing with him all this time.\n\nJohn Kahn described the process, in an interview for The Golden Road, as follows;\n\nI would present him with a bunch of ideas and he'd take the ones he liked and work on those. It was mainly stuff that he wouldn't ordinarily thought of, and I think that was part of the challenge for him to try something that was really new for him. I admired Jerry for being game for that stuff. A lot of performers wouldn't do something like that - stuff they're not familiar with - risking possible embarrassment or making mistakes.\n\nReached number 49 in Billboard's album charts,\n\nRelated releases\n\nReissued as Compliments of Garcia in April 1989 on LP/CD/Cassette (CDV/GDCD/GDC 4011)\n\nReissued in 1990 on CD by Grateful Dead Records (GDCD 40092)\n\nThe complete Garcia (Compliments) album plus bonus tracks from the album recording sessions were included in the Garcia box set;All Good Things: Jerry Garcia Studio Sessions, Jerry Garcia / Jerry Garcia Band, 2004\n\nThe All Good Things version of the album was subsequently released as a single CD in 2005.\n\nOne single was released in conjunction with the LP;\n\n• Let It Rock / Midnight Town, Jerry Garcia, 1974\n\nA promotional single was also distributed;\n\n• Let It Rock 7\" promotional single, Jerry Garcia, 1974\n\nPre-release mixes of Turn On The Bright Lights and Midnight Town were included on a Round Records sampler EP that also included tracks from Robert Hunter's Tales Of The Great Rum Runners; Sampler For Deadheads (EP 1 of 3), Robert Hunter/Jerry Garcia, June 1975, Round Records RR SAMP 102\n\nAttached Files:\n\ndeadcompjerry.jpg\n\nFile size:\n\n16.6 KB\n\nViews:\n\n4\n\ndeadcomplimentsfrt.jpg\n\nFile size:\n\n92.7 KB\n\nViews:\n\n5\n\ndeadcomplabel.jpg\n\nFile size:\n\n10.7 KB\n\nViews:\n\n4\n\n1974 – “Wall Of Sound” and the Martian Chronicles\n\nI was thinking I’d just jump straight into “Mars Hotel” studio album, but I don’t think that can be done without first mentioning GD’s hi-tech “Wall Of Sound”, which pretty much set the mood for the year (I’ve even got a cute “ufo” story later on about the Dead Movie) and may explain a bit of this “Mars” bizniz.\n\nThe DeadHead newsletter excerpts attached describe some stats about the final evolution of the Grateful Dead’s sound system. Several other bands were touring with their guillotines and fireworks and movie interludes syched to their music (Pink Floyd had their quad system, but it wasn’t anything quite like this GD system). The Dead were apparently synched only to the cosmos and their ideas of quality in performance and sound reproduction. They (Owsley/Wickersham/Alembic/GD road crew) aimed for and built the finest portable sound system of it’s time, as they fully believed it was in the very best interests of serving the music, themselves and their audience. The monster took 14 hours to assemble as stages leap-frogged to gigs, and at least one roadie was hired for his scaffolding experience alone. The GD played multi-hour shows (each one inherently different) to make the labor all worth while. Lucky us. It was a glorious time to be a concert goer!\n\nThe first time I laid eyes on it I remember thinking that it looked like a giant Martian hieroglyphic sitting in the sunny campus field. Sitting up close, things only got more complex as eyes darted back and forth across the surface of the massive structure. Like an MC Escher drawing, the racing mind tried to assimilate the shifting perspective illusions created by the different sizes of speakers on what had become a humming alien-looking hive. Phil had a large screen oscilloscope sitting on his rig, so there was a visual feedback situation watching the waveforms of his hyper-clean bass tones.\n\nIt wasn’t ear bleeding as you might expect. Band and audience were bathed together in crystal clear sounds that could be sound like a crisp crack of thunder or hang on a single fretted note. The biggest winners were Garcia’s ultra clean modified Strat pickup which rang like a bell, and Phil’s many bass grunts and chord growls from his multi-channel bass. Everything was low impedence with pre-amps; they weren’t playing on a rock sound system, they were playing on a high end hi-fi. (They occasionally played Sgt Pepper’s on it during the break; Beatle fans eat your hearts out!) Being a multi-channel but non-merged system in linear columns meant it was clearer than your stereo. There was an interesting slight echoing effect that you can occasionally hear on audience tapes, but I’m not sure if it created any standing wave cancellations. Probably not, though, as sound was emitting from the centre and radiating outward from the stage in a cylindrical sound wave. The trade off to the front-of-speaker noise-cancelling microphones was some loss of bottom (which they reckoned would have been corrected in time), but it was fun to see the singers dart up and back from the mics like feeding fish (a forced new technique). Each player adjusted their own volume; every instrument was so clear and audible that the balance between instruments on tapes could be off-kilter but unnoticed sometimes. Meanwhile, roadies would occasionally climb up and down the scaffolding checking for Frisbee damage to speakers (normally after a bark from Lesh to the crowd), and it’s rumored that the floor was lashed down as it would rise and fall with changing air pressure (haven’t verified that). Phil said after the March “soundcheck” that “For me, it’s like piloting a flying saucer, or riding your own sound wave”. The sessions for the new album started a few days later.\n\nOther high-tech flavor to the year was the acquisition of a computer for Ned Lagin and Phil to explore the physiological effect of various sounds on humans (and non). This spawned some flavor to the new album, live show segments, and a very ‘outside’ Lagin/Lesh side album for Round. There was also GD a newsletter item about the ongoing development of a new music reproduction medium; namely the use of a holographically encoded plastic prism to be read by a laser player the size of a cigarette pack. The prism was a friendly hoax clearly beyond their capabilities, but when small laser-read cd’s appeared years later I could help wondering how far-sighted the idea had been.\n\nPictures of the full “Wall Of Sound” system didn’t circulate widely for quite a while, so undoubtedly there were many worried sidelong family glances back home at dinner as the returned DeadHeads intently sculpted their mashed potatoes into esoteric shapes and muttered “This must mean something!”. LOL.\n\nDoes any of this mean anything to you?\n\nAttached Files:\n\ndeadwallstats.jpg\n\nFile size:\n\n37 KB\n\nViews:\n\n10\n\ndeadmicvocals.jpg\n\nFile size:\n\n42 KB\n\nViews:\n\n11\n\ndeadwallnews.jpg\n\nFile size:\n\n46.9 KB\n\nViews:\n\n10\n\ndeadwalloakland.jpg\n\nFile size:\n\n66.8 KB\n\nViews:\n\n11"
