        "text": "A Static Lullaby\n\nFaso Latido\n\n3.5\n\ngreat\n\nReview\n\nby USER (38 Reviews)\n\nMay 2nd, 2005 | 10 replies\n\nRelease Date: 2005 | Tracklist\n\nHey here to review the only A Static Lullaby album on the site. Pretty suprising considering this is a very good band. I learned that from their first album \"...And Don't Forget To Breathe\". A perfect mix of Screamo/Emo and Punk to make them a cool group. They're worth a good listen. Here I go.\n\nA Static Lullaby is...\n\nJoe Brown (vocals)\n\nDan Arnold (guitar/vocals)\n\nNathan Lindeman (guitar)\n\nPhil Pirrone (bass/vocals)\n\nBrett Dinovo (drums)\n\nHere's the individual song reviews...\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOverture - A cool intro to the album. Filled with creepy and bone chilling sounds. I get the chills everytime I listen to this. Like a bizarre mix of outside noises, a phone, and a door creaking. (8.5/10)\n\n-----\n\nSmooth Modulator - A cool startoff with good screaming. Cool guitar riff. Pretty catchy song. The backround vocals is what puts this one in the bag for me though. The chorus gets a little old though. (8/10)\n\n-----\n\nStand Up - The single on the album. Obviously, because it stands out as one of the best songs on the album. It has good screaming in the verses. But the constant \"Staaaand Up\" get annoying after a while. But still one of my favs. (9/10)\n\n-----\n\nRadio Flyer's Last Journey - I like the title here, but completley un-related to the song itself. A really edgy and fast-paced song. I really enjoy listening to this one. The screaming is what gets me though. It's so friggin good! This song helps break in the unused repeat button on my new stereo. (9/10)\n\n-----\n\nCash Cowbell - An intro that kind of throws you into the song. Good lyrics and guitar makes this one of the best on the cd. The dramatic pauses form verse to chorus is cool. The chorus isa also extremely catchy. I love it. I wish all music was as addictive as this (9.5/10)\n\n-----\n\nHalf Man, Half Shark; Equals One Complete Gentleman - The title really makes you think. That's what I've always liked about A Static Lullaby. Anyway, this song starts off slow but gets yuo into it with the (once again) good screaming. Slow verses and a fast chorus put this at th e top of my list. (9.5/10)\n\n-----\n\nShotgun! - One of the slowe songs on the album which is quite suprising by the title. The lyrics seem whiny here. Not my favorite song. But its okay for a once-in-a-while listen. The title kept me waiting but ended up dissapointing me. (6.5/10)\n\n-----\n\nCalmer Than You Are - A cool and punky song wit han explosive intro. I liek it a lot. A cool turnaround next to Shotcrap. Well it has cool whispering in the verses that is awfully creepy. But the chorus is fast as ever. (8/10)\n\n-----\n\nFaso Latido - Here we are. The title song. Before you get your hopes up, it's not very good. It's whiny, but that's fixed with the screaming. It's okay. Not very good. Very thrashy also. (7/10)\n\n-----\n\nGodbless you (God Dammit) - Cool title. Slower intro that works into a cool song. A little slow for my tastes though. It's an okay song. Souns a little like a ballad. That can't be good. (6.5/10)\n\n-----\n\nMarilyn Monrobot - Hysterical title. Had me laughing for hours. Amazing guitar in this one. This is where the album shows most of it's Screamo. Good spot for the song because I was losing intrest in the album. (8/10)\n\n-----\n\nModern Day Fire - Another explosive intro. But this song seems to fallow the exact formula that every other song on the album had. Cool and catchy chorus though. Good enough song to give it a good score. (8.5/10)\n\n-----\n\nJesus Haircut - I can't tell if they're trying to be funny or not. But the song doesn't give any hints. It's not really a good end to a so-so album. It;s a shame, I've been waithing for this album for a while. (7/10)\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat can I say. It was OKAY not the best. I will only continue to listen to a select few of the songs on the album. It sort of went down hill midway through. Well this is what I thought. Not the bands best but hopefully, many improvements next time.\n\nOVERALL SCORE - (7/10)\n\nTweet\n\nRecent reviews by this authorTV on the Radio Young LiarsHammock Maybe They Will Sing for Us TomorrowRussian Circles StationUnwound New Plastic IdeasHelmet MeantimeStrike Anywhere Dead FM"
