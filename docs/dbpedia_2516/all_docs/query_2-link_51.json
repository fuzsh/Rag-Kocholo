        "meta_description": "Never Stand Still by Tyrone Shoelaces, released 29 November 2013\n\n1. I&#39;ve Got My Demons\n2. Parc Bench Penthouse Featuring Tres Myers\n3. So Far Away\n4. Late at Night Parts I &amp; II\n5. Forget About Me\n6. Russian Lullaby\n7. Ain&#39;t Got Nuthin&#39;\n8. Never Stand Still\n\nOur second release. This time featuring The TSL Horns and The TSL Ladies. Our first single I&#39;ve Got My Demons seems to really connect with lots of people. It is by far the first song that we are recognized by. Tres Meyers adds hippity hop hop on our reggae classic, Parc Bench Penthouse. The TSL Ladies shine on So Far Away-our Van The Man inspired song. We begin to experiment with the dub on our TSL Horns led Late at Night Parts I &amp; II. Who new that one day the dub sound would become a big part of our show? Back to the rock for Forget About Me. A classic On the road song. Our tip of the hat to Jerry Garcia for inspiring our second line Nola version of the Irving Berlin Classic, Russian Lullaby. We start where Jerry ends...Aint Got Nuthin- a Lost Boy Classic written by our best bud Perry Paletta and finally, the NYC subway No. 6 train makes an appearance on the title track- written to remind everyone you can Never Stand Still. Hope you all enjoy!!!!! NOTE: With the download of this album, you will receive exclusive pictures from the recording of the album!",
