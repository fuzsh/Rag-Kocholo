        "text": "There is a lot of debate about gift cards for Christmas. Some people think they are a cop-out when it comes to Christmas Shopping. I personally love them. I love to give them. I love to receive them.\n\nI really do. Nothing beats an Amazon gift card as far as I am concerned. I don't care who you are. I love it. You may think they are impersonal but are they really? I mean what is better than finding a place you actually like to go shopping? Letting you pick out something you will not return.\n\nPlus you sure save a lot of money on shipping. We did very personal gifts this year with photos of my granddaughter. By the time we went to the store and bought all the supplies, and took the photos and envelopes to mail that was a lot of work. Oh, then don't forget having to wait in line at the post office. They did a great job but shipping ended up being more than the gift itself.\n\nI know the family will love the gifts but I feel that pictures can just be sent digitally. Save the postage on frames. I don't know just text them the photos and get them a gift card to their favorite place. One stamp is all it takes. No waiting in line.\n\nMy daughter and I argued about this very thing. She loves gift cards too but she thinks the personal gift is better. She is one of those.\n\nWe are having a white elephant gift exchange at our Christmas party here and guess what? They said we all need to bring a $10 gift card. No hunting for something stupid to exchange at the party. No, we all will leave with a gift card. I'm in.\n\nSo what is wrong with that? When you are shopping for gift cards you do still need to kind of know the person. What do they like? Is there a certain food they like better? Do they go out to see movies? Where do they like to shop? Do they have Prime through Amazon and get free shipping?\n\nSee there still is work to be done. You still have to research. Plus you know they will use your gift. I am team gift card all the way.\n\nHow About You?"
