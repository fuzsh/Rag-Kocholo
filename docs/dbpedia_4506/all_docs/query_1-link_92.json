        "text": "Recent, slow normal and strike-slip faulting in the Pasto Ventura region of the southern Puna Plateau, NW Argentina\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nZhou, Renjie; Schoenbohm, Lindsay M.; Cosca, Michael\n\n2013-01-01\n\nRecent normal and strike-slip faulting on the Puna Plateau of NW Argentina has been linked to lithospheric foundering, gravitational spreading, plate boundary forces and a decrease in crustal shortening from north to south. However, the timing, kinematics and rate of extension remain poorly constrained. We focus on the Pasto Ventura region (NW Argentina) located on the southern Puna Plateau and recent deformation (<1 Ma). Field mapping and kinematic analysis across offset volcanic cinder cones show that the overall extension direction is subhorizontal, is oriented NE-SW to NNE-SSW, and occurs at a slow, time-integrated rate of 0.02 to 0.08 mm/yr since at least 0.8â0.5 Ma. A regional compilation from this study and existing data shows that recent extension across the Puna Plateau is subhorizontal but varies in azimuthal orientation dramatically. Data from the Pasto Ventura region are consistent with a number of models to explain normal and strike-slip faulting on the Puna Plateau, all of which likely influence the region. Some role for lower lithospheric foundering through dripping appears to be seen based on the regional extension directions and ages of mafic volcanism in the southern Puna Plateau.\n\nLate Quaternary stratigraphy, sedimentology, and geochemistry of an underfilled lake basin in the Puna (north-west Argentina)\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nMcGlue, Michael M.; Cohen, Andrew S.; Ellis, Geoffrey S.; Kowler, Andrew L.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nDepositional models of ancient lakes in thin-skinned retroarc foreland basins rarely benefit from appropriate Quaternary analogues. To address this, we present new stratigraphic, sedimentological and geochemical analyses of four radiocarbon-dated sediment cores from the Pozuelos Basin (PB; northwest Argentina) that capture the evolution of this low-accommodation Puna basin over the past ca. 43 cal kyr. Strata from the PB are interpreted as accumulations of a highly variable, underfilled lake system represented by lake-plain/littoral, profundal, palustrine, saline lake and playa facies associations. The vertical stacking of facies is asymmetric, with transgressive and thin organic-rich highstand deposits underlying thicker, organic-poor regressive deposits. The major controls on depositional architecture and basin palaeogeography are tectonics and climate. Accommodation space was derived from piggyback basin-forming flexural subsidence and Miocene-Quaternary normal faulting associated with incorporation of the basin into the Andean hinterland. Sediment and water supply was modulated by variability in the South American summer monsoon, and perennial lake deposits correlate in time with several well-known late Pleistocene wet periods on the Altiplano/Puna plateau. Our results shed new light on lake expansionâcontraction dynamics in the PB in particular and provide a deeper understanding of Puna basin lakes in general.\n\nThe ages and tectonic setting of the Faja Eruptiva de la Puna Oriental, Ordovician, NW Argentina\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBahlburg, Heinrich; Berndt, Jasper; Gerdes, Axel\n\n2016-07-01\n\nThe Ordovician Faja Eruptiva de la Puna Oriental is a magmatic, predominantly intrusive belt in the Puna of northwestern Argentina with a N-S extension of ca. 400 km. Scarce isotope geochemical ages and biostratigraphic data on some of the folded Faja Eruptiva country rocks assign the magmatism either to the Lower and lower Middle Ordovician, or to the latest Ordovician. Interpretations of origin and tectonic framework of the Faja Eruptiva are controversial and vary between arc, back-arc and collisional-orogenic settings. We present high-resolution La-ICP-MS U-Pb age and Hf isotope data on zircons from 10 plutonic samples covering the magmatic belt along a length of 200 km in the northern Argentinian Puna. The xenocrystic and magmatic zircon age data have a wide spread between 2700 Ma and 440 Ma. Concordia and weighted mean age data document protracted magmatism in two phases between 480 and 460 Ma, and between 453 and 444 Ma, and constrain the time of the last intrusions at 444 Â± 3 Ma and at 445 Â± 2 Ma thus defining this last and main phase of intrusion at 444 Ma. ÎµHf(t) values define a main vertical trend centered at 500 Ma with ÎµHf(t) values between + 3 and - 16 indicating significant mixing of juvenile early Paleozoic melts with Paleoproterozoic crustal components. A second trend is formed by zircons with ages between 1.1 Ga and c. 500 Ma and predominantly positive ÎµHf values between + 8 and - 3 and originates in juvenile mantle compositions between 1.6 and 1.1 Ga. The spread of the zircon and Hf data document that the Faja Eruptiva intrusives have experienced large-scale contamination by the hosting crustal basement. It follows that the basement of the Puna is formed either by the upper Proterozoic-lower Cambrian Puncoviscana Formation as an erosional product of the Proterozoic orogenic belts of SW Amazonia or that the Puna including its Puncoviscana basement is underlain by a crust shaped by these orogenies. The main intrusive event at 444 Ma has been\n\nDietary patterns of the Andean population of Puna and Quebrada of Humahuaca, Jujuy, Argentina.\n\nPubMed\n\nRomaguera, D; Samman, N; Rossi, A; Miranda, C; Pons, A; Tur, J A\n\n2008-02-01\n\nThe aim of the present study was to describe dietary patterns in a representative sample from Puna and Quebrada of Humahuaca, Jujuy, Argentina. A cross-sectional nutritional survey was carried out in a representative sample (n 1236) of individuals from these regions. For the present study, only children aged 2-9 years (n 360), adolescents aged 10-18 years (n 223) and adults aged 18 years or over (n 465) were considered. Breast-fed children, pregnant women and lactating women were excluded. Dietary data collection methods comprised one 24 h recall and a semi-quantitative FFQ. We used principal component (PC) analyses to identify prevailing dietary patterns. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to assess the determinants of the identified dietary patterns. Two dominant PC were identified: PC1 reflected a 'Western-like' diet with an emphasis on not-autochthon foods. This pattern tended to be present in urban areas of the Quebrada region and was associated with a younger age, a higher level of development, and a worse diet quality. PC2 reflected an 'Andean-like' diet including a variety of autochthon crops. This was preferred by individuals living in rural areas from Puna with a high level of development during the post-harvest season, and was associated with a greater diet quality. These results suggest that the nutrition transition phenomenon is a reality in certain sectors of this population and might be one of the leading causes of the observed double burden of malnutrition.\n\nThermal biology in two syntopic lizards, Phymaturus extrilidus and Liolaemus parvus, in the Puna region of Argentina.\n\nPubMed\n\nGÃ³mez AlÃ©s, Rodrigo; Acosta, Juan Carlos; Laspiur, Alejandro\n\n2017-08-01\n\nBody temperature is the most important ecophysiological variable affecting reptiles' life history. Moreover, thermoregulation in ectotherms implies a struggle to reach preferred temperatures in natural conditions due to the influence of biotic and abiotic factors. Our objective was to evaluate and compare the thermal biology of two syntopic species, Phymaturus extrilidus and Liolaemus parvus, in the Puna region of San Juan, Argentina. We determined body temperature (T b ), micro-environmental temperatures (T a and T s ) and operative temperatures (T e ) in the field. In the laboratory, we measured preferred temperatures (T pref ) and calculated the index of thermoregulatory efficiency (E). Neither body temperatures in the field nor preferred temperatures varied between seasons and sexes. Body temperatures were lower than preferred temperatures for both species. Nevertheless, regardless of the low thermal offer available in habitat, both species did achieve body temperatures higher than operative temperatures during activity. Thermoregulatory effectiveness was moderate in P. extrilidus (E=0.65), while L. parvus presented greater thermoregulatory efficiency (E=0.78). We conclude that under the rigorous climate conditions of the Puna, Phymaturus extrilidus and Liolaemus parvus are able to actively and efficiently thermoregulate, maintaining body temperatures close to the preferred and higher than those of its habitat. Differences in thermal characteristics between Phymaturus extrilidus and Liolaemus parvus are a consequence of differential limitations imposed on each species by the environment and of forces inherent to their life histories.

The Tocomar geothermal volcanic area (Puna plateau, Central Andes, NW Argentina) has a high geothermal potential. It is crossed by the active NW-SE trans-Andean tectonic lineament known as the Calama-Olacapato-Toro (COT) fault system, which favours a high secondary permeability testified by the presence of numerous thermal springs. This study presents new stratigraphic, structural, volcanological, geochemical and hydrogeological data on the geothermal field. Our data suggest that the main geothermal reservoir is located within or below the Pre-Palaeozoic-Ordovician basement units, characterised by unevenly distributed secondary permeability. The reservoir is recharged by infiltration in the ridges above 4500 m a.s.l., where basement rocks are in outcrop. Below 4500 m a.s.l., the reservoir is covered by the low permeable Miocene-Quaternary units that allow a poor circulation of shallow groundwater. Geothermal fluids upwell in areas with more intense fracturing, especially where main regional structures, particularly NW-SE COT-parallel lineaments, intersect with secondary structures, such as at the Tocomar field.\n\nX-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy study of white decorations on tricolored ceramics from Northwestern Argentina\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFreire, E.; Acevedo, V.; Halac, E.

M.\n\n2011-12-01\n\nWind erosion of bedrock has been suggested to be responsible for the removal of more than 800 m of strata in the Qaidam Basin while wind deposition creates large-scale landforms such as the loess plateau. Wind eroded landforms, such as desert pavements in the Namibian Desert, Africa, form relic landscapes that are stable for more than 5 Ma. Desert pavements are of particular importance because of their widespread occurrence on terraces and fans, in mountains and coastal areas, and in hot and cold deserts including: Southwestern Africa, Antartic Dry valleys, Southwest USA, Denmark, Ireland, Israel, Sweden, and Central Tibet. Moreover, greater than 95 % of ventifacts on desert pavements are suspected to be late Quaternary to Holocene in age and are located on surfaces suitable for cosmogenic radionuclide dating. In spite of this, glacial, fluvial, and mass wasting systems have received far more attention than wind as an important geomorphic agent of erosion, deposition, and rock mass redistribution. Our goal is to: 1) quantify bedrock wind erosion rates; 2) quantify the ages of old, stable desert pavements; 3) and to identify which lithology-isotope pair provides the most accurate exposure ages for desert pavements in arid landscapes. The Puna Plateau, Argentina, is an ideal area to undertake this study because numerous wind eroded/deposited landforms are present, rates of fluvial erosion are low, and glaciation is limited. Mapping using remote sensed images shows that a significant portion of the Puna Plateau surface is covered by wind eroded or wind deposited landforms. These landforms align with the dominant wind direction (southeast) determined from ~450 ventifact measurements from 9 locations on the plateau. Twelve amalgamated samples sets that span six lithologies (granite, gneiss, quartzite, rhyolite, diabase, and basalt) using four cosmogenic isotopes (10Be, 26Al, 36Cl, 3He) on ventifacted clasts were collected from two surfaces to identify the most\n\nA Middle Miocene (13.5-12 Ma) deformational event constrained by volcanism along the Puna-Eastern Cordillera border, NW Argentina\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAramayo, Alejandro; GuzmÃ¡n, Silvina; Hongn, Fernando; del Papa, Cecilia; Montero-LÃ³pez, Carolina; Sudo, Masafumi\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThe features of Middle Miocene deposits in the Puna-Eastern Cordillera transition (Valles CalchaquÃ­es) indicate that Cenozoic deformation, sedimentation and volcanism follow a complex spatiotemporal relationship. The intense volcanic activity recorded in the eastern Puna border between 14 and 11.5 Ma coincides with the occurrence of one of the most important deformation events of the Neogene tectonic evolution in the region. Studies performed across the Puna-Eastern Cordillera transition show different relationships between volcanic deposits of ca. 13.5-12.1 Ma and the Oligocene-Miocene Angastaco Formation. In this paper we describe the ash-flow tuff deposits which are the first of this type found concordant in the sedimentary fill of Valles CalchaquÃ­es. Several analyses performed on these pyroclastic deposits allow a correlation to be made with the Alto de Las Lagunas Ignimbrite (ca. 13.5 Ma) of the Pucarilla-Cerro Tipillas Volcanic Complex located in the Puna. Outcrops of the ca. 13.5 Ma pyroclastic deposits are recognised within the Puna and the Valle CalchaquÃ­. However, in the southern prolongation of the Valle de HualfÃ­n (Tiopampa-Pucarilla depression) that separates the Puna from the Valle CalchaquÃ­ at these latitudes, these deposits are partially eroded and buried, and thus their occurrence is recorded only by abundant volcanic clasts included in conglomerates of the Angastaco Formation. The sedimentation of the Angastaco Formation was aborted at ca. 12 Ma in the Tiopampa-Pucarilla depression by the Pucarilla Ignimbrite, which unconformably covers the synorogenic units. On the contrary, in the Valle CalchaquÃ­ the sedimentation of the Angastaco Formation continued until the Late Miocene. The different relationships between the Miocene Angastaco Formation and the ignimbrites with ages of ca. 13.5 and ca. 12 Ma reveal that in this short period ( 1.5 m.y.) a significant deformation event took place and resulted in marked palaeogeographic changes, as\n\nNorthwestern Argentina as seen from the Apollo 7 spacecraft\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1968-01-01\n\nPuna de Atacama area of northwestern Argentina, Provinces of Salta and Catamarca, as seen from the Apollo 7 spacecraft during its 154th revolution of the earth.

R.; Bookhagen, B.; Alonso, R. N.; Pingel, H.; Freymark, J.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nWith average elevations of about 3.7 km the Altiplano-Puna Plateau of the southern central Andes constitutes the world's second largest orogenic plateau. The plateau generally consists of internally drained, partly coalesced sedimentary basins bordered by reverse-fault bounded ranges, >5 km high. In the Puna, the Argentine sector of the plateau, active tectonism has been interpreted to be characterized by a low level of strike-slip and normal faulting associated with mafic volcanism. In contrast, the eastern plateau margins and the adjacent foreland record a higher level of seismicity and ongoing contraction. Despite ubiquitous Plio-Pleistocene normal faulting along the eastern plateau margins, our new observations record contraction in the plateau interior. Fanning of E-dipping Miocene sedimentary strata involved in the formation of an anticline in the Pocitos Basin of the central Puna interior indicates growth, which must have begun after 7 Ma; 1.5-m.y.-old lacustrine strata as well as tilted Pleistocene lacustrine shorelines associated with this structure indicate sustained uplift into the Quaternary. Corresponding observations along the eastern border of the Pocitos Basin show that <3.5-m.y.-old strata are involved in contractile deformation and basin compartmentalization. Shortening in the central Puna is compatible with Plio-Pleistocene shortening in the low-elevation Salar de Atacama farther west, and may indicate that low-elevation sectors of the plateau have not yet reached a critical elevation that is conducive to normal faulting as observed elsewhere. The onset of extensional deformation in the Puna is thus highly disparate in space and time. Coeval regional thrusting, strike-slip, and normal faulting do not support a structural and topographic setting that promotes wholesale extension and orogenic collapse of the plateau realm.\n\nRelationship between Famatinian Arc Magmatism and Recent Mafic Volcanism in Northwest Argentina: Implications for Lithospheric Composition and Evolution Beneath the Puna Plateau\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDrew, S.; Schoenbohm, L.; Ducea, M.\n\n2008-12-01\n\nThe tectonic and magmatic evolution of the Puna Plateau (NW Argentina) has generated much debate over the past two decades. This study focuses on the young (< 7 Ma), mafic magmatism that led to the creation of monogenetic and simple polygenetic volcanoes throughout the plateau. These volcanics provide a means to evaluate the recent petro-tectonic development of the plateau and, in combination with Ordovician intrusive rocks, determine the isotopic composition and long term evolution of the sub-continental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) beneath the Andean back-arc domain. Here we present new whole rock major and trace element data and isotopic values for volcanic samples collected from the Antofagasta and Pasto Ventura basins in the southern Puna Plateau. Major element chemistry shows most of our samples are basalt, trachybasalt, basaltic andesite and basaltic trachyandesites, some with < 50.0 wt% SiO2 and > 8.0 wt% MgO, which is indicative of a strong mantle component. The more primitive lavas likely have a sub-crustal origin and experienced minimal interaction with overlying crust during transport to the surface. Two of our samples with low wt% MgO, a silicic andesite and a dacite, indicate an extensive crustal component and possibly a lower crust origin for evolved magmas. All samples have light trace element enrichment compared to NMORB and elevated abundances of LIL and LRE elements compared to HFS and HRE elements, indicating the magmas originated from a metasomatized source region. The samples also have variable (low and high) Nb, Ta and Ti negative anomalies, which are interpreted to be a signature of the source region. Our samples do not have a lithospheric delamination (~OIB) trace element signature as proposed by previous workers in support of a delamination model. Additionally, the samples have isotopic values (e.g. 87Sr/86Sr >0.7055 and ÉNd <0) that are not comparable to depleted asthenosphere. It is impossible for asthenospheric magma to obtain these\n\nPaleozoic to early Cenozoic cooling and exhumation of the basement underlying the eastern Puna plateau margin prior to plateau growth\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nInsel, N.; Grove, M.; Haschke, M.; Barnes, J. B.; Schmitt, A. K.; Strecker, M. R.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nConstraining the pre-Neogene history of the Puna plateau is crucial for establishing the initial conditions that attended the early stage evolution of the southern extent of the Andean plateau. We apply high- to low-temperature thermochronology data from plutonic rocks in northwestern Argentina to quantify the Paleozoic, Mesozoic and early Tertiary cooling history of the Andean crust. U-Pb crystallization ages of zircons indicate that pluton intrusion occurred during the early mid-Ordovician (490-470 Ma) and the late Jurassic (160-150 Ma). Lower-temperature cooling histories from 40Ar/39Ar analyses of K-feldspar vary substantially. Basement rocks underlying the western Puna resided at temperatures below 200Â°C (<6 km depth) since the Devonian (Ë400 Ma). In contrast, basement rocks underlying the southeastern Puna were hotter (Ë200-300Â°C) throughout the Paleozoic and Jurassic and cooled to temperatures of <200Â°C by Ë120 Ma. The southeastern Puna basement records a rapid cooling phase coeval with active extension of the Cretaceous Salta rift at Ë160-100 Ma that we associate with tectonic faulting and lithospheric thinning. The northeastern Puna experienced protracted cooling until the late Cretaceous with temperatures <200Â°C during the Paleocene. Higher cooling rates between 78 and 55 Ma are associated with thermal subsidence during the postrift stage of the Salta rift and/or shortening-related flexural subsidence. Accelerated cooling and deformation during the Eocene was focused within a narrow zone along the eastern Puna/Eastern Cordillera transition that coincides with Paleozoic/Mesozoic structural and thermal boundaries. Our results constrain regional erosion-induced cooling throughout the Cenozoic to have been less than Ë150Â°C, which implies total Cenozoic denudation of <6-4 km.\n\nQuaternary shortening in the central Puna Plateau of NW Argentina: Preliminary results from the Salar de Pocitos, Salta province (24.5Â° S, 67Â° W)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFreymark, Jessica; Strecker, Manfred R.; Bookhagen, Bodo; Bekeschus, Benjamin; Eckelmann, Felix; Alonso, Ricardo\n\n2013-04-01\n\nActive tectonism in Cenozoic orogenic plateaus is often characterized by a combination of active extensional and strike-slip faulting subsequent to protracted phases of shortening and the build-up of high topography. In the Puna Plateau of NW Argentina, the southern part of the world's second largest orogenic plateau, the changeover from shortening to extensional tectonics is thought to have occured between 7 and 5 Ma along the southeastern plateau margin, while the central and northern plateau areas apparently changed into an extensional regime between 9 and 6 Ma (Cladouhos et al., 1994). Despite these observations of extensional structures we report on new data from the Salar de Pocitos that show sustained shortening in the south-central part of the plateau. The south-central Puna Plateau is characterized by an average elevation of about 3700 m with low relief and internally drained basins, which are bordered by reverse-fault bounded ranges. The N-S oriented Salar de Pocitos is an integral part of these contractional structures and covers an area of ~435 kmÂ². The western border of the basin constitutes the eastern flank of an anticline involving Tertiary and Quaternary sediments, while the eastern border is delimited by a N-S striking reverse fault, bounding the range front of the Sierra Qda. Honda. In the north of the Salar de Pocitos the three Miocene volcanoes Tultul, Delmedio and Pocitos form a barrier with the Salar del RincÃ³n, and the south of the basin is bordered by fault blocks involving Ordovician lithologies that have left only a narrow valley that may have provided an outlet of the basin in the past. Multiple terraces generated during Late Pleistocene and Holocene lake highstands straddle the Pocitos Basin and serve as excellent strain markers to assess neotectonic deformation. We surveyed the terraces along N-S and E-W transects using a differential GPS. The E-W surveys are perpendicular to the structures that bound the basin and record\n\nTracing Altiplano-Puna plateau surface uplift via radiogenic isotope composition of Andean arc lavas\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nScott, E. M.; Allen, M. B.; Macpherson, C.; McCaffrey, K. J. W.; Davidson, J.; Saville, C.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nWe have compiled published geochemical data for Jurassic to Holocene Andean arc lavas from 5oN to 47oS, covering the current extent of the northern, central and southern volcanic zones. Using this dataset we evaluate the spatial and temporal evolution of age corrected Sr- and Nd-radiogenic isotopes in arc lavas at a continental-scale, in order to understand the tectonic and surface uplift histories of the Andean margin. It has long been noted that baseline 87Sr/86Sr and 143Nd/144Nd ratios of Quaternary lavas from the central volcanic zone, located within the Altiplano-Puna plateau, are distinct from volcanic rocks to the north and south. This is commonly attributed to greater crustal thickness, which increases to roughly twice that of the average continental crust within the Altiplano-Puna plateau. By comparing 87Sr/86Sr and 143Nd/144Nd ratios in Quaternary lavas to published crustal thickness models, present day topography and the compositions of basement terranes, we note that Sr- and Nd-isotope values of Quaternary lavas are an effective proxy for present day regional elevation. In contrast, variation in basement terranes has only a small, second order effect on isotopic composition at the scale of our study. Using this isotopic proxy, we infer the spatial extent of the plateau and its surface uplift history from the Jurassic to the present. Our results concur with a crustal thickening model of continued surface uplift, which initiated in the Altiplano, with deformation propagating southwards into the Puna throughout the Neogene and then continuing in central Chile and Argentina up to the present day.\n\nStructural control on geothermal circulation in the Cerro Tuzgle-Tocomar geothermal volcanic area (Puna plateau, Argentina)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGiordano, Guido; Pinton, Annamaria; Cianfarra, Paola; Baez, Walter; Chiodi, Agostina; Viramonte, JosÃ©; Norini, Gianluca; Groppelli, Gianluca\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe reconstruction of the stratigraphical-structural framework and the hydrogeology of geothermal areas is fundamental for understanding the relationships between cap rocks, reservoir and circulation of geothermal fluids and for planning the exploitation of the field. The Cerro Tuzgle-Tocomar geothermal volcanic area (Puna plateau, Central Andes, NW Argentina) has a high geothermal potential. It is crossed by the active NW-SE trans-Andean tectonic lineament known as the Calama-Olacapato-Toro (COT) fault system, which favours a high secondary permeability testified by the presence of numerous springs. This study presents new stratigraphic and hydrogeological data on the geothermal field, together with the analysis from remote sensed image analysis of morphostructural evidences associated with the structural framework and active tectonics. Our data suggest that the main geothermal reservoir is located within or below the Pre-Palaeozoic-Ordovician basement units, characterised by unevenly distributed secondary permeability. The reservoir is recharged by infiltration in the ridges above 4500 m a.s.l., where basement rocks are in outcrop. Below 4500 m a.s.l., the reservoir is covered by the low permeable Miocene-Quaternary units that allow a poor circulation of shallow groundwater. Geothermal fluids upwell in areas with more intense fracturing, especially where main regional structures, particularly NW-SE COT-parallel lineaments, intersect with secondary structures, such as at the Tocomar field. Away from the main tectonic features, such as at the Cerro Tuzgle field, the less developed network of faults and fractures allows only a moderate upwelling of geothermal fluids and a mixing between hot and shallow cold waters. The integration of field-based and remote-sensing analyses at the Cerro Tuzgle-Tocomar area proved to be effective in approaching the prospection of remote geothermal fields, and in defining the conceptual model for geothermal circulation.\n\nCrustal and Upper Mantle Investigations Using Receiver Functions and Tomographic Inversion in the Southern Puna Plateau Region of the Central Andes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHeit, B.; Yuan, X.; Bianchi, M.; Jakovlev, A.; Kumar, P.; Kay, S. M.; Sandvol, E. A.; Alonso, R.; Coira, B.; Comte, D.; Brown, L. D.; Kind, R.\n\n2011-12-01\n\nWe present here the results obtained using the data form our passive seismic array in the southern Puna plateau between 25Â°S to 28Â°S latitude in Argentina and Chile. In first instance we have been able to calculate P and S receiver functions in order to investigate the Moho thickness and other seismic discontinuities in the study area. The RF data shows that the northern Puna plateau has a thicker crust and that the Moho topography is more irregular along strike. The seismic structure and thickness of the continental crust and the lithospheric mantle beneath the southern Puna plateau reveals that the LAB is deeper to the north of the array suggesting lithospheric removal towards the south. Later we performed a joint inversion of teleseismic and regional tomographic data in order to study the distribution of velocity anomalies that could help us to better understand the evolution of the Andean elevated plateau and the role of lithosphere-asthenosphere interactions in this region. Low velocities are observed in correlation with young volcanic centers (e.g. Ojos del Salado, Cerro Blanco, Galan) and agree very well with the position of crustal lineaments in the region. This is suggesting a close relationship between magmatism and lithospheric structures at crustal scale coniciding with the presence of hot asthenospheric material at the base of the crust probably induced by lithospheric foundering.\n\nElastic stress interaction between faulting and volcanism in the Olacapato-San Antonio de Los Cobres area (Puna plateau, Argentina)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBonali, F. L.; Corazzato, C.; Tibaldi, A.\n\n2012-06-01\n\nWe describe the relationships between Plio-Quaternary tectonics, palaeoseismicity and volcanism along the NW-trending Calama-Olacapato-El Toro (COT) lineament that crosses the Andean chain and the Puna Plateau and continues within the eastern Cordillera at about 24Â° S. We studied in detail the area from the Chile-Argentina border to a few km east of the San Antonio del Los Cobres village. Satellite and field data revealed the presence of seven Quaternary NW-striking normal left-lateral fault segments in the southeastern part of the studied area and of a Plio-Quaternary N-S-striking graben structure in the northwestern part. The NW-striking Chorrillos fault (CF) segment shows the youngest motions, of late Pleistocene age, being marked by several fault scarps, sag ponds and offset Quaternary deposits and landforms. Offset lavas of 0.78 Â± 0.1 Ma to 0.2 Â± 0.08 Ma indicate fault kinematics characterised by a pitch angle of 20Â° to 27Â° SE, a total net displacement of 31 to 63.8 m, and a slip-rate of 0.16 to 0.08 mm/yr. This fault segment is 32 km long and terminates to the northwest near a set of ESE-dipping thrust faults affecting Tertiary strata, while to the southeast it terminates 10 km further from San Antonio. In the westernmost part of the examined area, in Chile at altitudes > 4000 m, recent N-S-striking normal fault scarps depict the 5-km-wide and 10-km-long graben structure. Locally, fault pitches indicate left-lateral normal kinematics. These faults affect deposits up to ignimbrites of Plio-Quaternary age. Scarp heights are from a few metres to 24 m. Despite that this area is located along the trace of the COT strike-slip fault system, which is reported as a continuous structure from Chile to Argentina in the literature, no evidence of NW-striking Plio-Quaternary strike-slip structures is present here. A series of numerical models were also developed in an elastic half-space with uniform isotropic elastic properties using the Coulomb 3.1 code.

The rotations are clockwise in southern Bolivia, northern Chile and northwestern Argentina. Various models have been proposed to explain the geodynamic evolution of the Central Andes, but the driving mechanism of these rotations remains controversial. Constraining the spatial variability and the timing of the rotations may contribute to a better understanding of their origin. Our results complement information from previous studies, improving the knowledge of tectonic rotations in the region of the northern Argentine Puna and western Cordillera Oriental. In the San Juan de Oro basin (SJOB), 132 cores were drilled from the middle Miocene Tiomayo Formation in the zone of Tiomayo-Santa Ana (22Â°30'S-66Â°30'W), and from the Ë17 Ma Casa Colorada dacite dome complex. Another 114 cores were collected from middle Miocene dacitic dome centers emplaced in the zone of Laguna de Pozuelos basin (22Â°30'S-66Â°00'W). The results of our paleomagnetic study suggest that the sampled zones underwent very low, statistically insignificant rotation since middle Miocene. However, a tendency for low magnitude rotation appears when observing our data together with paleomagnetic results from coeval rocks in neighbouring areas. If so, this low rotation could be related to middle Miocene thrust activity in the central and eastern parts of the Cordillera Oriental. The combined analysis of paleomagnetic and structural data illustrates the probable, direct relationship between timing of significant rotations and timing of local deformation in the sourthern Central Andes.\n\nEarly Tertiary Exhumation, Erosion, and Sedimentation in the Central Andes, NW Argentina\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCarrapa, B.; Decelles, P. G.; Gerhels, G.; Mortimer, E.; Strecker, M. R.\n\n2006-12-01\n\nTiming of deformation and resulting sedimentation patterns in the Altiplano-Puna Plateau-Eastern Cordillera of the southern Central Andes are the subject of ongoing controversial debate. In the Bolivian Altiplano, sedimentation into a foreland basin system commenced during the Paleocene. Farther south in the Puna and Eastern Cordillera of NW Argentina, a lack of data has precluded a similar interpretation. Early Tertiary non-marine sedimentary rocks are preserved within the present day Puna Plateau and Eastern Cordillera of NW Argentina. The Salar de Pastos Grandes basin in the Puna Plateau contains more than 2 km of Eocene alluvial and fluvial strata in the Geste Formation, deposited in close proximity to orogenic source terrains. Sandstone and conglomerate petrographic data document Ordovician quartzites and minor phyllites and schists as the main source rocks. Detrital zircon U-Pb ages from both the Geste Formation and from underlying Ordovician quartzite cluster in the 900-1200 Ma (Grenville) and late Precambrian-Cambrian (Panafrican) ranges. Sparse late Eocene (~37-34 Ma) grains are also present; their large size, euhedral shape, and decreasing mean ages upsection suggest that these grains are volcanogenic (i.e. ash fall contamination), derived from an inferred magmatic arc to the west. The Eocene ages corroborate mammalian paleontological dates, defining the approximate begin of deposition of the Geste Formation. Alternatively, these young zircons could be of plutonic origin; however, no Eocene plutons are present in the surrounding source rocks and this interpretation is not likely. From W to E, fluvial rocks of the Quebrada de los Colorados Formation show similar sedimentological features as those observed for the Geste Formation, suggesting a genetic link between the two. Detrital zircon U-Pb data show mainly Panafrican ages, with sparse ages in the 860-935 Ma range and a few mid-Proterozoic ages. More importantly, a significant number of late Eocene\n\nHydrogen stable isotopes from hydrated volcanic glass record orogenic growth and climate change at the eastern Puna Plateau margin, NW Argentina\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPingel, H.; Mulch, A.; Rohrmann, A.; Alonso, R. N.; Strecker, M. R.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nIntermontane basin strata along the E flanks of the Puna Plateau in NW Argentina are ideal archives to investigate the interaction between tectonics, topography, and changes in climate. In particular, these strata record the fragmentation of a formerly contiguous foreland by range uplifts, ensuing intra-basin deformation, and surface uplift. These changes were often accompanied by a transition from humid to semiarid conditions as windward range uplift exceeded orographic threshold elevations. The E Andean flanks comprise steep gradients in topography, rainfall, and surface-process rates. Rainfall is focused along the E flanks of the plateau, while the orogen interior is arid. These gradients are mirrored by the stable isotope ratios of modern rainfall, and therefore, in the stable isotope composition of proxy materials that incorporate this water. We present D/H ratios of volcanic glass (Î´Dg) from dated tuffs in Mio-Pleistocene sediments of intermontane basins in the Eastern Cordillera between ~23 and 26Â°S (Humahuaca, Toro, and Angastaco basins). We document a strong co-varying relationship between tectono-sedimentary events in the basins and corresponding Î´Dg values. Initial D-depletion trends in the Toro and Angastaco basins constrains the onset of surface uplift to 6.5 and 7 Ma, respectively. Strong positive Î´Dg shifts of >15â° in Humahuaca at ~3 Ma and <2 Ma in the Toro basin are apparently caused by enhanced evaporation. In this tectonic setting the observed relationships may be related to the attainment of orographic threshold conditions and ensuing hinterland aridification. Î´Dg values in Angastaco, additionally, appear to be episodically influenced by enhanced convective rainfall during the Plio-Pleistocene, similar to modern conditions.\n\nSombrero uplift above the Altiplano-Puna Magma Body: evidence of a ballooning mid-crustal diapir.\n\nPubMed\n\nFialko, Yuri; Pearse, Jill\n\n2012-10-12\n\nThe Altiplano-Puna ultralow-velocity zone in the central Andes, South America, is the largest active magma body in Earth's continental crust. Space geodetic observations reported an uplift in the Altiplano-Puna proper at a rate of ~10 mm/year; however, the nature of the inferred inflation source has been uncertain. We present data showing that the uplift has persisted at a nearly constant rate over the past two decades, and is surrounded by a broad zone of subsidence. We show that the ongoing uplift and peripheral subsidence may result from a large mid-crustal diapir fed by partial melt from the Altiplano-Puna Magma Body.\n\nSediment aggradation and erosional dynamics of intermontane basins in NW Argentina\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBookhagen, Bodo; Castino, Fabiana; Purinton, Ben; Strecker, Manfred\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThe NW Argentine Andes constitute the Andean Plateau (Altiplano-Puna), the second-largest orogenic plateau on Earth, an internally drained highland with a mean elevation of 4.0 Â± 0.5 km (Â±2 sigma). The Puna is flanked by the externally drained Eastern Cordillera thrust belt and the adjacent broken foreland that are connected to the Atlantic Ocean. These mountain ranges lie in the south-central Andes and are characterized by steep topographic and climatic gradients: The first windward topographic rise east of the Puna forms a significant orographic barrier resulting in high orographic rainfall causing some of the wettest places on Earth. In contrast, the higher-elevation areas of the windward flanks become progressively drier westward, until arid conditions are attained in the central Puna. During the Quaternary the south-central Andes have repeatedly experienced significant paleoclimatic changes associated with deeper penetration of moisture into the orogen, and thus an orogenward shift of the climate gradient. This mechanism has resulted in large variations in erosion dynamics and sediment transfer toward the foreland, resulting in thick valley fills and multiple terrace levels. At much shorter timescales, climate variability during the Holocene has caused similar, yet less pronounced hydrologic trends and associated sedimentation- and erosion processes. Here, we use a time series of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) to reconstruct land-level changes in the intramontane basins in NW Argentina. We generated the DEMs and height measurements based on stereo airphotos from the 1980s, ASTER satellite imagery, ICESat and dGPS measurements during the past decade, and several TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X CoSSC pairs starting in 2013. Our data show a strong signal of fluvial sediment aggradation during the past 30 years, in places up to 0.5m per decade, which explains the regionally observed, modern sediment accumulation in basins that has caused major infrastructural problems\n\nEvidence of Newell's Shearwater breeding in Puna District, Hawaii\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nReynolds, Michelle H.; Ritchotte, George L.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nNocturnal surveys using auditory cues and night-vision equipment were conducted during the seabird breeding season in 1993 to determine use of inland areas in the Puna District, Hawaii by Newell's Shearwater (Puffinus auricularus newelli). Two hundred sixty Newell's Shearwater auditory or visual detections were made during 275 survey hours from 23 Jul. 1993 - 20 Sep. 1993. Mean detection rates were 1.26 birds/h at Puulena Crater (n = 160 Newell's Shearwater detections), 1.05 birds/h at Heiheiahulu (n = 99) and 0.04 birds/ h at Puu Kaliu (n = 2). Vocalizing peaked between 50 and 90 min after sunset and 4 h before sunrise. Although night-vision equipment was used on most of the seabird surveys, only 4% of seabirds were detected visually. Two road-killed birds collected in Puna in June 1993, and four burrows located in Puulena Crater after the 1994 breeding season, provided additional evidence of breeding.\n\nActive shortening and intermontane basin formation in the central Puna Plateau: Salar de Pocitos, NW Argentina (24Â° 37S, 67Â° 03W)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStrecker, M. R.; Bookhagen, B.; Alonso, R.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nWith average elevations of about 3.7 km, the semi-arid to arid Puna Plateau is a first-order morphotectonic province of the southern central Andes and is an integral part of the world's second largest orogenic plateau. With few exceptions, this region consists of internally drained, partly coalesced sedimentary basins that are mainly bordered by 5- to 6-km high reverse-fault bounded basement ranges or volcanic edifices. The basins contain continental evaporites, volcanic and clastic deposits, typically between 3 and 5 km thick, and record protracted sedimentation since the Eo-Oligocene. While these basins and ranges are related to contraction, extensional tectonics associated with mafic volcanism characterizes the eastern and southern sectors of the Puna Plateau, while the eastern flanks of the plateau and the adjacent foreland are subjected to shortening. The changeover from contraction to extension in the Puna appears to have been diachronous. Along the SE plateau margin the changeover based on previously published age dating took place between 7 and 5 Ma, while areas in the central and northern Puna document shortening until 6 and 9 Ma, respectively. In the latter two areas, however, evidence for extension comparable to the eastern and southeastern plateau is scarce. This is compatible with our new observations from the Salar de Pocitos area in the western interior of the plateau, which has been characterized by protracted shortening from the Tertiary to the present-day. The N-S oriented Salar de Pocitos basin (435 km2) is the vestige of a formerly contiguous sedimentary basin that extended to the Salar de Arizaro in the west. Unlike many other basins in this region, the Pocitos basin is bordered by the limb of an anticline developed in Tertiary sedimentary rocks on the west, while the east side comprises the reverse-faulted range front of Sierra Qda. Honda. To the north the basin is closed by transverse-oriented late Miocene volcanic edifices, and to the south\n\nZircon U-Pb ages and Hf isotopes for the Diablillos Intrusive Complex, Southern Puna, Argentina: Crustal evolution of the Lower Paleozoic Orogen, Southwestern Gondwana margin\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOrtiz, AgustÃ­n; Hauser, Natalia; Becchio, RaÃºl; SuzaÃ±o, NÃ©stor; Nieves, Alexis; Sola, Alfonso; Pimentel, Marcio; Reimold, Wolf\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe evolution of the rocks of the Lower Paleozoic Orogen in Puna, at the Southwestern Gondwana margin, has been widely debated. In particular, the scarce amount of geological and geochemical data available for the Diablillos Intrusive Complex, Eastern Magmatic Belt, Southern Puna, require a further study for new evidence towards the understanding of sources, magmatic processes and emplacement of magmas, in order to better comprehend the crustal evolution in this setting. We present new combined U-Pb and Hf isotope analyses on zircon by LA-MC-ICP-MS from monzogranite, granodiorite and diorite rocks of the Diablillos Intrusive Complex. We obtained 206Pb/238U concordant weighted average ages of 517 Â± 3 Ma and 515 Â± 6 Ma for the monzogranite and diorite, respectively, and a concordant age of 521 Â± 4 Ma for the granodiorite. These ages permit to constrain the climax of magmatic activity in the Diablillos Complex around â¼515-520 Ma, while the emplacement of the complex took place between â¼540 Ma and 490 Ma (representing a ca. 50 Ma magmatic event). Major and trace element data, initial 87Sr/86Sr values varying from 0.70446 to 0.71278, positive and negative ÉNd(t) values between +2.5 and -4, as well as ÉHf(t) for zircon data between + 3 and -3 indicate that the analyzed samples represent contaminated magmas. The ÉHf(t) and the ÉNd(t) values for this complex specify that these rocks are derived from interaction of a dominant Mesoproterozoic crystalline and/or a metasedimentary source and juvenile mantle-derived magmas, with a TDM model age range of â¼1.2-1.5 Ga, with later reworking during lower Paleozoic times. The combined data obtained in this contribution together with previous data, allow us to suggest that the formation of the Eastern Magmatic Belt of the Puna was part of a long-lived magmatic event during Early Paleozoic times. Whereby the granitoids of the Eastern Magmatic Belt formed through intra-crustal recycling at an active continental margin, with\n\nActive shortening, intermontane basin formation, and geomorphic evolution in an orogenic plateau: Central Puna Plateau, NW Argentina (24Â°37'S, 67Â°03'W)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStrecker, Manfred R.; Alonso, Ricardo N.; Bookhagen, Bodo; Freymark, Jessica; Pingel, Heiko\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThe high-elevation Andean Plateau (Altiplano-Puna; 4km) is a first-order morphotectonic province of the Central Andes and constitutes the world's second largest orogenic plateau. While there are many unifying basin characteristics in this region, including internal drainage, semi-arid to arid climate and associated deposition of evaporites, there are notable differences between the northern and southern parts of the plateau. In contrast to the vast basins of the Altiplano (north) and incipient establishment of fluvial connectivity and sediment transport to the foreland, the Puna (south) comprises numerous smaller basins, bordered by reverse-fault bounded ranges up to 6 km high. The plateau is internally drained and fluvial connectivity with the foreland does not exist leading to thick sedimentary basin fills that comprise continental evaporites, volcanic and clastic deposits, typically between 3 and 5 km thick. However, repeated impacts of climate change and superposed tectonic activity in the southern plateau have resulted in further basin differentiation, abandonment or re-arrangement of fluvial networks and impacts on sediment transport. Here we report evidence for sustained contractional tectonic activity in the Pocitos Basin in the southern plateau. On the western margin of the basin fanning of dipping strata and regraded, steeply inclined gravel-covered pediment surfaces and wind gaps associated with gravel derived from distant sources in the west document late Tertiary to Pleistocene growth of an approximately N-S oriented and N plunging anticline. The growth of the eastern limb of this anticline has caused the isolation of a formerly more extensive basin. In addition, Late Pleistocene and Holocene lake shorelines and lacustrine deposits are tilted eastward along the same structure and InSAR measurements of deformed lake terraces document that the fold is growing. Despite widely reported extensional faulting in the southern Puna, we conclude (1) that the\n\nTectonic evolution of the Arizaro basin of the Puna plateau, NW Argentina: Implications for plateau-scale processes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBoyd, John D.\n\nSedimentary basins of the Altiplano-Puna Plateau within the Andean Plateau in South America contain the record of retro-arc foreland basin evolution during the Cenozoic. The deformation of these basins is characterized by high angle reverse faults and thrusts deforming crystalline basement and sedimentary covers. The mechanism/s responsible for deformation within the region are not fully understood in detail. The relative abundance of intercalated tuffs within these basins and those within the bounding Eastern Cordillera enables the spatial-temporal pattern of deformation across the orogen to be constrained. This study uses the systematic combination of structural, geochronologic and sedimentalogical techniques applied to Cenozoic sedimentary rocks within the Arizaro Basin to investigate the timing of deformation across within the region in order to test two end member models for basin deformation in response to lithospheric processes. The first model attributes the deformation of the basins to internal deformation within an orogenic wedge as part of the taper building process required prior to propagation eastward towards the foreland basin system. The second model attributes basin deformation to isostatic adjustments resulting from small-scale lithospheric foundering. Detailed geologic mapping of the Arizaro Basin reveals a complex interplay of coeval thick-skinned and thin-skinned deformation, which deforms the thick Miocene succession of fluvial-lacustrine strata in both a brittle and ductile manner. Zircon U-Pb analyses of intercalated tuffs from the Vizcachera Formation reveal that approximately three km of the section was deposited between the Early Miocene (ca. 18.3) and the Middle Miocene (ca. 13.9). One tuff in the uppermost Vizcachera Formation constrains the lower limit of timing of deformation for the Arizaro Basin to be 13.9 +/- 0.7 Ma. When combined with published geochronological data across the Puna Plateau and Eastern Cordillera, the new data\n\nMunroa argentina, a Grass of the South American Transition Zone, Survived the Andean Uplift, Aridification and Glaciations of the Quaternary.\n\nPubMed\n\nAmarilla, Leonardo D; Anton, Ana M; Chiapella, Jorge O; Manifesto, MarÃ­a M; Angulo, Diego F; Sosa, Victoria\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe South American Transition Zone (SATZ) is a biogeographic area in which not only orogeny (Andes uplift) and climate events (aridification) since the mid-Miocene, but also Quaternary glaciation cycles had an important impact on the evolutionary history of the local flora.

We collected 152 individuals from 20 localities throughout the species' range, ran genetic and demographic analyses, and applied ecological niche modeling. Phylogenetic and population genetic analyses based on cpDNA and AFLP data identified three phylogroups that correspond to the previously identified subregions within the SATZ.

A.; Hugenholtz, C.; Barchyn, T.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe Puna Plateau of northwestern Argentina is as a promising analogue for Martian aeolian processes owing to its altitude, low atmospheric pressure, aridity, and widespread granular and bedrock aeolian features. The study was conducted in and surrounding the area known as the Campo de Piedra PÃ³mez - a prominent expanse of wind-carved ignimbrite in Argentina's Catamarca Province. To interpret the evolution of this unique laboratory, which is limited by its isolated location and dearth of in situ measurements, we investigated contemporary aeolian sediment transport through a combination of modeled meteorological data, satellite imagery, field measurements, and sediment traps. Our objective is to utilize modeled meteorological data, satellite imagery, and field measurements and samples to characterize the aeolian environment here to base analogue studies. Satellite imagery from Terra MODIS, GeoEye, and Ikonos indicate recent large-scale aeolian sediment transport events and migration of gravel in the region. A prominent, region-wide sediment transport event on 14 August 2015 coincided with synoptic-scale pressure patterns indicating a strong Zonda (Foehn) winds. Sediment traps and marbles provide additional evidence of wind-driven transport of sand and gravel. Yet, despite the body of evidence for sediment transport on the Puna Plateau, modeled wind data from the European Center for Midrange Weather Forecasting suggest wind rarely attains the speeds necessary to initiate sediment transport. This disconnect is reminiscent of the Martian Saltation Paradox which suggested winds on Mars were incapable of mobilizing sediment, despite widespread evidence from rover, lander, and satellite observations. This raises questions about: (i) the suitability of modeled wind data for characterizing aeolian processes on both planets, and (ii) the possibility that most geomorphic work is conducted in extreme, but infrequent events in this region (possibly analogous to Mars).

The particular interest is understanding and locating the deep fracture networks that are necessary for fluid circulation in hydrothermal systems. The dissertation first presents a study in which identification of large scale faulting places Montserrat into a tectonic context. Then follow studies of Puna and Montserrat that focus on faults and fractures of the deep hydrothermal systems. The first chapter consists of the results of the SEA-CALIPSO experiment seismic reflection data, recorded on a 48 channel streamer with the active source as a 2600 in3 airgun. This chapter discusses volcaniclastic debris fans off the east coast of Montserrat and faults off the west coast. The work places Montserrat in a transtensional environment (influenced by oblique subduction) as well as in a complex local stress regime. One conclusion is that the stress regime is inconsistent with the larger arc due to the influence of local magmatism and stress. The second chapter is a seismic study of the Puna hydrothermal system (PHS) along the Kilauea Lower East Rift Zone. The PHS occurs at a left step in the rift, where a fracture network has been formed between fault segments. It is a productive geothermal field, extracting steam and reinjecting cooled, condensed fluids. A network of eight borehole seismometers recorded >6000 earthquakes. Most of the earthquakes are very small (< M.2), and shallow (1-3 km depth), likely the result of hydrothermal fluid reinjection. Deeper earthquakes occur along the rift as well as along the south-dipping fault plane that originates from the rift zone. Seismic methods applied to the PHS data set, after the initial recording, picking, and locating earthquakes, include a tomographic inversion of the P-wave first arrival data.

This suggests that current source-sink inventories fail to adequately characterise the landscapes of the region. This may be particularly true of Andean environments where very few field observations have been made. The high tropical Andes, between tree and permanent snow-lines, is home to diverse grass, shrub and giant rosette dominated ecosystems known variously from Venezuela to northern Chile and Argentina as paramo, jalca and puna. In humid regions these are characterised by wet, organic-rich mineral soils, peat-forming wetlands and shallow lakes. Such conditions are likely to promote methane production and potentially represent a regionally significant source to the atmosphere that should be considered. We report on methane fluxes from a bunch-grass dominated puna habitat at 3500 m above sea level in south-eastern Peru. Mean annual temperature and precipitation are 11 Â°C and 2500 mm, respectively. Temperature is aseasonal but experiences considerable diurnal variations with overnight frosting common-place. In contrast, rainfall is intensely episodic and has a pronounced wet season between September and March. Sampling encompassed a range of topographic features, such as grassland on freely draining, gently inclined or steep slopes and depressions containing bogs, over a 3 ha ridge to basin transition. Monthly sampling was carried out between January 2011 and June 2013 to investigate seasonal variability in methane fluxes. Intensive sampling campaigns were conducted to investigate spatial and short-term variations on a daily basis in two nine-day campaigns during wet and dry season. The site was a net source of methane to the atmosphere during the period of study. Methane fluxes were dominated by emissions from bogs, whereas, freely draining grassland exhibited weak source or marginal sink activity.

M.; Cosca, M. A.\n\n2011-12-01\n\nRecent extension on the Puna Plateau of NW Argentina has been linked to lithospheric foundering, gravitational spreading, and edge effects. However, the timing, kinematics and rate of extension are poorly constrained. In the Pasto Ventura region, along the southern margin of the plateau, we map out two different groups of faults: (1) recently formed Quaternary normal faults and strike-slip faults; and (2) pre-Quaternary reverse faults reactivated in the Quaternary. The faults in Group (1) are relatively short (~1-2 km) normal and strike-slip faults that offset Quaternary geomorphic features. The orientation of these faults indicates NE-SW to NNE-SSW extension. The faults in Group (2) bound exposures of basement rock and are associated with basaltic cinder cones and lava flows. Previous studies indicate they were reverse faults which have been reactivated as normal faults. We applied kinematic GPS surveying and 40Ar/39Ar dating of three cinder cones displaced by two of Group-(2) faults. Kinematic analysis on vertical and horizontal offsets obtained by GPS survey shows that the one fault is now undergoing NE-SW to NNE-SSW extension, consistent with Group (1) fault kinematics. A cinder cone has been displaced 34-40 meters horizontally along this fault, yielding a slow extension rate of 0.02-0.04 mm/yr since 0.8-0.5 Ma. The shift from contraction to extension in the Pasto Ventura region is estimated to be between 7.8 and 0.5 Ma, but more likely between 7.8 and 4 Ma. A regional compilation of kinematics on the southern plateau from this study and existing data, although sparse, shows two spatial groups: the extension directions are N-S to NE-SW south of 26Â°S latitude, while they are NW-SE to NNW-SSW north of 26Â°S latitude. Mafic volcanism, thought to indicate the timing of the onset of extension in the Puna, shows a similar pattern, with the oldest ages (up to 7.3 Ma) clustered near 26Â°S latitude, becoming younger to both the north and the south.

The report is the second of a two part project dealing with archaeology of the Puna GRS area -- or more generally, the Kilauea East Rift Zone. In the first phase of the project, a long-term land-use model and inventory research design was developed for the GRS area and Puna District generally. That report is available under separate cover as Archaeology in the Kilauea East Rift Zone,moreÂ Â» Part I: Land-Use Model and Research Design. The present report gives results of a limited cultural resource survey built on research design recommendations. It offers a preliminary evaluation of modeled land-use expectations and offers recommendations for continuing research into Puna`s rich cultural heritage. The present survey was conducted under the auspices of the United States Department of Energy, and subcontracted to International Archaeological Research Institute, Inc. (IARII) by Martin Marietta Energy Systems, Inc. The purpose of the archaeological work is to contribute toward the preparation of an environmental impact statement by identifying cultural materials which could be impacted through completion of the proposed Hawaii Geothermal Project.Â«Â less\n\nXenarthra (Mammalia) from a new late Neogene fossiliferous locality in Northwestern Argentina\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZurita, Alfredo E.; Camacho, MarÃ­a; MiÃ±o-Boilini, Angel R.; Candela, Adriana M.; Cuadrelli, Francisco; Krmpotic, Cecilia M.; SolÃ­s, Natalia\n\n2017-12-01\n\nNorthwestern Argentina contains one of the most complete continental late Neogene (ca. 9-2.58 Ma) fossiliferous sequences in South America, especially in the current territories of the Catamarca, TucumÃ¡n and Jujuy provinces. More precisely in Jujuy Province several localities bearing mainly fossil mammals have been reported at the Quebrada de Humahuaca in the UquÃ­a, MaimarÃ¡ and Tilcara formations, in which the clade Xenarthra (Mammalia) is well-represented. In this scenario, the fossiliferous potential of other localities of Jujuy Province are less known, especially in those areas located at the northwest end of Argentina, bordering Bolivia in the Northern Puna. A new late Neogene fossiliferous locality near Calahoyo (3639 m.a.s.l), Jujuy Province, is here reported. The materials, belonging to Xenarthra, were exhumed from the base of the Tafna Formation which was deposited in a sedimentary basin by alluvial and/or fluvial currents, undergoing transitions of various lacustrine episodes. The taxa include the Tardigrada Pyramiodontherium bergi (Megatheriidae) and the Cingulata Eosclerocalyptus sp. (Glyptodontidae) and Macrochorobates chapalmalensis (Dasypodidae). From a biostratigraphic viewpoint, this assemblage suggests a Late Miocene-Pliocene age for the base of the Tafna Formation, and partially contradicts the supposed Plio-Pleistocene age of this unit. Finally, the new specimens here described indicate that Xenarthra were taxonomically and ecologically diverse during the late Neogene in the northwest end of Argentina, since they are represented by at least three main lineages (sloths, glyptodontids and armadillos).\n\nResponse To And Lessons Learned From Two Back-To-Back Disasters At Kilauea Volcano, Puna District, Hawaii\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGregg, C. E.; Houghton, B. F.; Kim, K.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nThe Puna District, Hawaii, is exposed to many natural hazards, including those associated with volcanic eruptions and tropical storms, but for decades Puna has also been the fastest growing District in the state due to its affordable real estate. In 2014, populated areas were affected by back-to-back hurricane and volcanic eruption crises. Both events were declared Presidential Disasters and tested response and recovery systems of many of Puna's 49, 000 residents, government services and businesses. This paper summarizes individual and organizational response to the two crises: the relatively rapid onset Tropical Storm Iselle, which made landfall in Puna on August 5 and the slow onset June 27 lava flow. The latter took some 2 months to advance to the edge of developed areas, prompting widespread community reaction. While the lava flows no longer pose an immediate threat to development because they are repaving remote, near-source and upflow areas, the lava could again advance into developed areas over similar time scales as in 2014. Puna is mostly a rural setting with many narrow, privately owned dirt roads. Some residents have no municipal electricity and water; they use solar and gasoline generators and rain catchment systems. High winds and collapse of exotic Albizia trees during Iselle isolated many residents, but people self-organized through social media to respond and recover. Social media and community meetings dominated information sharing during the lava crisis. Major expenses were incurred in response to the lava crisis, primarily through upgraded alternate roads that provide redundancy and construction of temporary school buildings linked to evacuation and relocation of students. Experiences during Iselle primed residents to rapidly self-organize and address the impending inundation by slow moving lava flows which advanced in uncertain directions at rates of 0-450 m/day. People's demand for constant and near-real time information from authorities placed\n\n`Site Testing' en la Puna de Atacama\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRecabarren, P.; Mosconi, M.\n\nWe present a report of the activities developed by the IATE group from the Observatorio AstronÃ³mico de CÃ³rdoba and astronomers from the Pontificia Universidad CatÃ³lica de Chile, from 14 till 22. of April of 2000. We have made seeing and meteorological measurements and a topographical prospecting in order to characterize the environmental conditions in Cerro Toco (5574m), in the region of the Puna de Atacama. The seeing measurements were made with a DIMM (Differential Image Motin Monitor) camera. The seeing measurements during 20. and 21. of April gave an average value of 0.85 arc seconds. We think that more places in the region should be studied.\n\nShear wave splitting and shear wave splitting tomography of the southern Puna plateau\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCalixto, Frank J.; Robinson, Danielle; Sandvol, Eric; Kay, Suzanne; Abt, David; Fischer, Karen; Heit, Ben; Yuan, Xiaohui; Comte, Diana; Alvarado, Patricia\n\n2014-11-01\n\nWe have investigated the seismic anisotropy beneath the Central Andean southern Puna plateau by applying shear wave splitting analysis and shear wave splitting tomography to local S waves and teleseismic SKS, SKKS and PKS phases. Overall, a very complex pattern of fast directions throughout the southern Puna plateau region and a circular pattern of fast directions around the region of the giant Cerro Galan ignimbrite complex are observed. In general, teleseismic lag times are much greater than those for local events which are interpreted to reflect a significant amount of sub and inner slab anisotropy. The complex pattern observed from shear wave splitting analysis alone is the result of a complex 3-D anisotropic structure under the southern Puna plateau. Our application of shear wave splitting tomography provides a 3-D model of anisotropy in the southern Puna plateau that shows different patterns depending on the driving mechanism of upper-mantle flow and seismic anisotropy. The trench parallel a-axes in the continental lithosphere above the slab east of 68W may be related to deformation of the overriding continental lithosphere since it is under compressive stresses which are orthogonal to the trench. The more complex pattern below the Cerro Galan ignimbrite complex and above the slab is interpreted to reflect delamination of continental lithosphere and upwelling of hot asthenosphere. The a-axes beneath the Cerro Galan, Cerro Blanco and Carachi Pampa volcanic centres at 100 km depth show some weak evidence for vertically orientated fast directions, which could be due to vertical asthenospheric flow around a delaminated block. Additionally, our splitting tomographic model shows that there is a significant amount of seismic anisotropy beneath the slab. The subslab mantle west of 68W shows roughly trench parallel horizontal a-axes that are probably driven by slab roll back and the relatively small coupling between the Nazca slab and the underlying mantle.

L.; Strecker, M. R.; Fielding, E. J.\n\n1984-01-01\n\nA proposed analysis of Shuttle Imaging Radar-B (SIR-B) data extends current research in the Sierras Pampeanas and the Puna of northwestern Argentina to the determination - by the digital analysis of mountain-front sinuousity - of the relative age and amount of fault movement along mountain fronts of the late-Cenozoic Sierras Pampeanas basement blocks; the determination of the age and history of the boundary across the Andes at about 27 S latitude between continuing volcanism to the north and inactive volcanism to the south; and the determination of the age and extent of Pleistocene glaciation in the High Sierras, as well as the comparative importance of climatic change and tectonic movements in shaping the landscape. The integration of these studies into other ongoing geology projects contributes to the understanding of landform development in this active tectonic environment and helps distinguish between climatic and tectonic effects on landforms.\n\n[Spatial patterns in communities of aquatic macroinvertebrates of Argentinean Puna].\n\nPubMed\n\nNieto, Carolina; Malizia, Agustina; Carilla, Julieta; Izquierdo, Andrea; RodrÃ­guez, JosÃ©; Cuello, Soledad; Zannier, MartÃ­n; Grau, H Ricardo\n\n2016-06-01\n\nSpatial patterns in communities of aquatic macroinvertebrates of Argentinean Puna. The macroinvertebrates are a vital component of freshwater ecosystems as they contribute to the process of organic matter while serving as food for other organisms such as fish and amphibians. Unfortunately, the knowledge of the aquatic diversity is poor in the high Andean systems (between 3 200 and 5 200 m.a.s.l. and rainfall below 300 mm per year), especially in the Argentinean peatbogs, a fact which has made difficult the interpretation of spatial patterns on a regional scale. The present study aimed to describe the composition of aquatic macroinvertebrates in seven peatbogs in the Argentinean Puna, and to analyze for the first time their spatial patterns. For this, we studied the relationship of these organisms with the environment, and obtained information about the surrounding vegetation and water physico-chemical characteristics. A total of 3 131 specimens of aquatic macroinvertebrates were collected, representing 25 taxa belonging to 22 families and 24 genera. In addition, 62 species of vascular plants were recorded, belonging to 20 families. The most abundant life form were the tufted grasses, followed by cushions. By using an NMDS (Non-Metrical Multidimensional Scaling) statistical analysis, the sampling sites were ordered in each peatbog as follows. The peatbogs located furthest West and South with higher water temperature were grouped on axis 1, whereas those with higher conductivity, whole water dissolved solids and salt concentration were grouped on axis 2. The water temperature was higher than air temperature at all times, and we found no association between temperature and altitude. The altitude had no correlation with the abundance of macroinvertebrates or with plant richness. Life forms such as scattered graminoids, trailing and prostrate herbs (in many cases they get into the channel) and aquatic plants were more abundant in peatbogs 4, 5 and 7 and they had a\n\nRare Earth Element Concentrations in Geothermal Wells at the Puna Geothermal Field, Hawaii\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nFowler, Andrew; Zierenberg, Robert\n\nRare earth element concentrations in the geothermal wells at the Puna geothermal field, Hawaii.

Although the APMB is a first-order geologic feature similar to the Sierra Nevada batholith, its role in the surface uplift history of the Central Andes remains uncertain. Here we show that a long-wavelength topographic dome overlies the seismically measured extent of the APMB, and gravity data suggest that the uplift is isostatically compensated. Isostatic modelling of the magmatic contribution to dome growth yields melt volumes comparable to those estimated from tomography, and suggests that the APMB growth rate exceeds the peak Cretaceous magmatic flare-up in the Sierran batholith. Our analysis reveals that magmatic addition may provide a contribution to surface uplift on par with lithospheric removal, and illustrates that surface topography may help constrain the magnitude of pluton-scale melt production.

J.; Vaselli, O.\n\n2017-05-01\n\nThis study focused on the geochemical and isotopic features of thermal fluids discharged from five zones located in the high altitude Puna plateau (Jujuy Province between S 22Â°20â§-23Â°20â§ and W 66Â°-67Â°), i.e. Granada, Vilama, Pairique, CoranzulÃ­ and Olaroz. Partially mature waters with a Na+-Cl- composition were recognized in all the investigated zones, suggesting that a deep hydrothermal reservoir hosted within the Paleozoic crystalline basement represents the main hydrothermal fluid source. The hydrothermal reservoirs are mainly recharged by meteoric water, although based on the Î´18O-H2O and Î´D-H2O values, some contribution of andesitic water cannot be completely ruled out. Regional S-oriented faulting systems, which generated a horst and graben tectonics, and NE-, NW- and WE-oriented transverse structures, likely act as preferentially uprising pathways for the deep-originated fluids, as also supported by the Rc/Ra values (up to 1.39) indicating the occurrence of significant amounts of mantle He (up to 16%). Carbon dioxide, the most abundant compound in the gas phase associated with the thermal waters, mostly originated from a crustal source, although the occurrence of CO2 from a mantle source, contaminated by organic-rich material due to the subduction process, is also possible. Relatively small and cold Na+-HCO3--type aquifers were produced by the interaction between meteoric water and Cretaceous, Palaeogene to Miocene sediments. Dissolution of evaporitic surficial deposits strongly affected the chemistry of the thermal springs in the peripheral zones of the study area. Geothermometry in the Na-K-Ca-Mg system suggested equilibrium temperatures up to 200 Â°C for the deep aquifer, whereas lower temperatures (from 105 to 155 Â°C) were inferred by applying the H2 geothermometer, likely due to re-equilibrium processes during the thermal fluid uprising within relatively shallow Na-HCO3 aquifers.

The velocity field exhibits a systematic decrease in magnitude from 35 mm/yr near the trench to <1 mm/yr within the craton. We forward model loading on the Nazca-South America (NZ-SA) subduction interface using back slip on elastic dislocations to approximate a fully locked interface from 10 to 50 km depth. We generate an ensemble of models by iterating over the percentage of NZ-SA convergence accommodated at the subduction interface. Velocity residuals calculated for each model demonstrate that locking on the NZ-SA interface is insufficient to reproduce the observed velocities. We model deformation associated with a back-arc dÃ©collement using an edge dislocation, estimating model parameters from the velocity residuals for each forward model of the subduction interface ensemble using a Bayesian approach. We realize our best fit to the thrust-perpendicular velocity field with 70 Â± 5% of NZ-SA convergence accommodated at the subduction interface and a slip rate of 9.1 Â± 0.9 mm/yr on the fold-thrust belt dÃ©collement. We also estimate a locking depth of 14 Â± 9 km, which places the downdip extent of the locked zone 135 Â± 20 km from the thrust front. The thrust-parallel component of velocity is fit by a constant shear strain rate of -19 Ã 10-9 yr-1, equivalent to clockwise rigid block rotation of the back arc at a rate of 1.1Â°/Myr.\n\nVariations in the long-term uplift rate due to the Altiplano-Puna magma body observed with Sentinel-1 interferometry\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLau, Nicholas; Tymofyeyeva, Ekaterina; Fialko, Yuri\n\n2018-06-01\n\nWe present new Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) observations of surface deformation in the Altiplano-Puna region (South America) where previous studies documented a broad uplift at an average rate of â¼10 mm/yr. We use data from the Sentinel-1 satellite mission to produce high-resolution velocity maps and time series of surface displacements between years 2014-2017. The data reveal that the uplift has slowed down substantially compared to the 1992-2010 epoch and is characterized by short-term fluctuations on time scales of months to years. The observed variations in uplift rate may indicate a non-steady supply of melt and/or volatiles from the partially molten Altiplano-Puna Magma Body (APMB) into an incipient diapir forming in the roof of the APMB.\n\nSoil organic matter dynamics at the paramo and puna highlands in the Andean mountains\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nÃngeles MuÃ±oz, M.; Faz, Ãngel; Mermut, Ahmet R.; Zornoza, RaÃºl\n\n2014-05-01\n\nMountains and uplands represent the most diverse and fragile ecosystems in the world, cover about 20% of the terrestrial surface and are distributed across all continents and major ecoregions. The Andean Plateau is the main mountain range of the American continent and one of the largest in the world with more than 7,500 km. The soil organic matter is a corner stone in the fertility management of the Andean agriculture as well as in the erosion control. However, its role is still much unknown in these ecosystems. Moreover, the influence of current global climatic change on soil organic C reservoirs and dynamics is still not clearly understood. The aim of this work was to review the soil C dynamics and the implication of the soil organic matter in the fertility management, erosion control, conservation of biodiversity and global climate change to improve the knowledge on the mountain Andean highlands. Climate, landscape, soil C pools, biomass and management were studied. In general, the Andean climate is affected by three main factors: ocean currents, winds and orography characterized by an abrupt topography. The entire Andean belt is segmented into the Northern, Central and Southern Andes. Northern Andes are called paramo and are characterized by humid climate while Central and Southern Andes dryer zones are called puna. Most of the region is tectonically and volcanically active. Sedimentary rocks predominated in the paramo while sedimentary, igneous and metamorphic ones prevailed in the puna. The most common soils were Andosols, Regosols, Umbrisols and Histosols. The cold and wet climate and the low atmospheric pressure favored organic matter accumulation in the soil. The accumulation of organic matter is further enhanced by the formation of organomineral complexes strongly resistant to the microbial breakdown mainly in the paramo. High organic C contents were observed in the paramo (10%) oppositely to the low contents found in the dryer puna (1%). The C/N ratio\n\nThe 'stealth' lavas of Kilauea: the 2014-2015 volcanic crisis in Puna\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHoughton, B. F.; Gregg, C. E.; Kim, K.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nThe 1983 onwards eruption of KÄ«lauea took a complex turn and changed course in June 2014 when activity switched to a new vent northeast of Pu'u 'Å'Å. New flows were directed into lower Puna, a district which had not experienced lava since 1845. The new flow was the longest seen in Hawaii in 500 years and in OctoberâNovember 2015 it threatened buildings in PÄhoa town and critical lifelines (roading, electricity) to a larger population of some 10,500 people in lower Puna. The behavior of long-lived slow-moving flows of this type is exceptionally difficult to predict over time and the lava advanced as narrow lobes, typically only a few inches high and feet-wide, guided by small changes in ground slope and local barriers, before widening and thickening over time scales of days. New lobes have then broken out either from the front or margins of the flows, often taking unpredictable paths, and allowing the flows to cover progressively larger areas. The uncertainty as to where the flow would appear next made the human response very challenging. At the same time slow advance gave lots of warning time and has led to both a globally unique set of 'just-in-time' measures to mitigation lava impacts and development of a resilient, strong, articulate community. The lava flow retreated back 'up-slope' in mid-2015 but remains a hidden threat that could return to threaten PÄhoa and neighboring subdivisions.\n\nManaging uncertainty: Lessons from volcanic lava disruption of transportation infrastructure in Puna, Hawaii.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Karl; Pant, Pradip; Yamashita, Eric\n\nA recent lava flow in Puna, Hawaii, threatened to close one of the major highways serving the region. This article provides background information on the volcanic hazards and describes events, responses, and challenges associated with managing a complex, long-duration disaster. In addition to the need to better understand geologic hazards and threats, there is a need for timely information and effective response and recovery of transportation infrastructure. This requires coordination and sharing of information between scientists, emergency managers, transportation planners, government agencies, and community organizations. Transportation assets play a critical role in terms of problem definition, response, and recovery. The challenges with managing a long-duration event include: (1) determining when a sufficient threat level exists to close roads; (2) identifying transportation alternatives; (3) assessing impacts on communities including the direct threats to homes, businesses, structures, and infrastructure; (4) engaging communities in planning and deliberation of choices and alternatives; and (5) managing uncertainties and different reactions to hazards, threats, and risks. The transportation planning process provides a pathway for addressing initial community concerns. Focusing not just on roadways but also on travel behavior before, during, and after disasters is a vital aspect of building resilience. The experience in Puna with the volcano crisis is relevant to other communities seeking to adapt and manage long-term threats such as climate change, sea level risk, and other long-duration events.\n\nEndoparasites of fat-tailed mouse opossums (Thylamys: Didelphidae) from northwestern Argentina and southern Bolivia, with the description of a new species of tapeworm.\n\nPubMed\n\nJimÃ©nez, F AgustÃ­n; Braun, Janet K; Campbell, Mariel L; Gardner, Scott L\n\n2008-10-01\n\nThe parasite fauna of 2 species of fat-tailed mouse opossums from northwestern Argentina is herein presented. Five species of helminths were found, i.e., Pterygodermatites kozeki, Hoineffia simplispicula, Oligacanthorhynchus sp., and a new species of tapeworm, Mathevotaenia sanmartini n. sp. (Cyclophyllidea: Anoplocephalidae). The new species is characterized by a calyciform scolex, relatively few testes (32), and a long cirrus sac; it occurs in fat-tailed mouse opossums at localities above 4,000 m. Those characters make it different from 6 species known to occur in marsupials from the New World, and from other species occurring in armadillos and bats. Didelphoxyuris thylamisis, H. simplicispicula, and Oligacanthorhynchus sp. appear to occur in marmosas from the Yungas region. In contrast, both P. kozeki and M. sanmartini n. sp. appear to occur exclusively in the Puna.\n\nLate Miocene ignimbrites at the southern Puna-northern Sierras Pampeanas border (Ë27Â°S): Stratigraphic correlation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMontero-LÃ³pez, Carolina; GuzmÃ¡n, Silvina; Barrios, Fabiola\n\n2015-10-01\n\nNew field observations and petrographic and geochemical data of pyroclastic deposits exposed along the Las Papas valley (border between southern Puna and northern Sierras Pampeanas, Argentina) and further north, lead us to propose a new stratigraphic correlation and classification of the late Miocene volcanism in this area. We redefine the Las Papas, Las Juntas, Aguada Alumbrera and Rosada ignimbrites and define the Agua Caliente and Del Medio ignimbrites. The whole set of ignimbrites are rhyolites and less frequently dacites of calc-alkaline affinity. In the present contribution we divide ignimbrites into the Agua Negra and RincÃ³n groups, based mainly on their geochemical signature. The Agua Negra Group is formed by the Las Papas and Las Juntas ignimbrites, indurated and welded, lithic-rich, with crystal-poor pumices and crystal-rich matrix. The RincÃ³n Group comprises the Agua Caliente, Aguada Alumbrera, Rosada and Del Medio ignimbrites, with variable welding degrees, lithic and crystal content. The greater enrichment of crystals in the matrix in comparison with the crystal content in pumices indicates significant elutriation during flow transport and thus volume estimations are to be considered lower bounds for the actual erupted volume. The total minimum estimated volume for the ignimbrites of the Agua Negra and RincÃ³n groups is 2.8 km3 (2.3 km3 DRE). Field relationships and new analytical data indicate that the different acid ignimbrites that crop out in this small area are related to at least two different magma chambers. The widespread Quaternary volcanism in this area covers the older deposits, thus making it difficult to recognize the volcanic centers that produced these late Miocene ignimbrites.\n\nEarth Observations taken by the Expedition 23 Crew\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2010-04-26\n\nISS023-E-028353 (26 April 2010) --- Central Andes Mountains, Salar de Arizaro, Argentina are featured in this image photographed by an Expedition 23 crew member on the International Space Station. The high plains (3,000 to greater than 5,000 meters elevation, 13,000 to 19,000 feet) of the Andes Mountains, also known as the Puna, appear in the foreground of this photograph, with a line of young volcanoes facing the much lower Atacama Desert (1,000â2,000 meters elevation). Several large dry lakes, marked by light-toned salt crusts, occupy the basins between major thrust faults in the Puna. Salar de Arizaro (foreground) is the largest of the dry lakes in this view (salar means waterless salt flat in Spanish). This panorama was taken by a station crew member looking southeast across the South American continent when the ISS was almost directly over the Atacama Desert near Chileâs Pacific coast. The Atlantic Ocean coastline (River Plate where Argentinaâs capital city of Buenos Aires is located) is dimly visible at top left. A striking geological and landscape contrast is visible at center which separates two distinct geological zones, namely the Puna and the Sierras Pampeanas. The Sierras Pampeanas Mountains are lower in elevation and have few young volcanoes, in contrast to the Puna. Sharp-crested ranges are separated by wide, low valleys in this region. The Salinas Grandesâephemeral shallow salt lakes at top left (salina means salt lake in Spanish) â occupies one of these valleys. The general color change from reds and browns in the foreground to blues and greens in the upper part of the image reflects the major climatic regions, namely the deserts of the Atacama and Puna, versus the low grassy plains of central Argentina where rainfall is sufficient to promote lush prairie grass growthâknown famously as the pampas in Argentina.
