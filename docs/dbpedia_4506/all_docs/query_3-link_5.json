He won scholarships to Fridley High School and Metropolitan State University after learning to speak English from a Peace Corps volunteer when he was a teenager.\n\nEl Mirador Paraguayo newspaper reports that Amarilla’s Nobel-nominated play, “Fecha Feliz” (“The Happy Date” or “Date Happy”), is the story of a young man during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who ruled Paraguay for 35 years before being overthrown in a 1989 military coup.\n\n“A writer really writes best about what he knows,” Amarilla said in a 2006 Pioneer Press interview. “Usually, I think I’m writing about Paraguay, but the people who see my plays tell me it’s more than that, that the themes are universal.”\n\nAmarilla directed the English-language version of the play, titled “Saved by a Poem,” at Teatro del Pueblo, a small Latino theater in St. Paul, and during Intermedia Arts’ annual Latino festival, according to Amarilla’s spokeswoman and TV Paraguaya.com. He also worked with Iraq-born Yacoub Aljaffery to stage Aljaffery’s “Born in Iraq” at Mixed Blood Theater under the auspices of the theater company they formed, Earth Speak.\n\nAmong other plays Amarilla wrote in Minnesota are “Ripped Dress,” which focuses on suicide among Paraguay’s youths, and “La Pruebera,” a lighter story about a character who enlists a “voodoo lady” to track down a stolen scooter. When Amarilla was still a student at Metro State, “Ripped Dress” was staged in Paraguay’s capital at a theater affiliated with the American Embassy there and received national media attention.\n\n“Fecha Feliz” was nominated for the Nobel by literature professor Fulvia Sanchez de Coronel and Joel Filartiga, a victim of the Stroessner dictatorship. El Mirador quoted de Coronel as saying that Amarilla’s work demonstrates “without precedent, a dictatorial period that left its mark on a generation and even its children. The brilliant and realistic use of our indigenous language, guarani, makes ‘Fecha Feliz’ a historical marker that should become embedded in the memories of all who lived that period. …”\n\nAmarilla, a former Fulbright scholar, was born in Coronel Oviedo, where his family grew corn and cotton. By 1997, he was in Fridley on a foreign-exchange scholarship, returning to Paraguay after graduation to work as an interpreter for an American company. He came back to Minnesota to attend Metro State, where he was active in student government and picked as one of the school’s top 10 students in the fall of 2005.\n\nAt Metro State, he thought he would study acting, “but two years into my major, I was starting to realize acting was not challenging enough,” he said in his Pioneer Press interview. That’s when he started to explore directing and writing at the urging of Gail Smogard, director of the university’s theater program.\n\nJulio Ojeda-Zapata contributed to this article.\n\nMary Ann Grossmann can be reached at 651-228-5574.\n\nOriginally Published: February 24, 2010 at 11:01 p.m."
