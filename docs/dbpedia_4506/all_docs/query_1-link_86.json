        "text": "Through TangoE14’s weekly email we offer some suggestions to ‘Keep Tango alive inside you’:\n\n***** ***** ***** *****\n\n***** ***** ***** *****\n\n***** ***** ***** *****\n\n***** ***** ***** *****\n\n***** ***** ***** *****\n\n18th February 2021\n\nHola Tangueros y Amigos,\n\nLast week I talked about Waltz, Viennese Waltz and Tango vals, and invited comments. Michael replied:\n\n“You said (ballroom) Waltz is the easiest etc but I don’t agree for a very simple reason. It is one of the hardest to stay on the rhythm. Once you lose the rhythm the only thing you can do is stop, and start again.\n\nI agree about nightmare Viennesers but I find that is true of nearly all the dancers who go in for competitions. They are used to having the floor to themselves and they are often dancing their routine which they cannot (or do not wish to) adapt.\n\nThe most inconsiderate dancers as a group are Lindy hoppers when the music is quickstep (which they can’t do). So, they take up a spot anywhere on the floor and do Lindy hop anyway. Quick-steppers need to travel round the outside of the room.\n\nLindy hoppers don’t know that, block the line of dance, and can be bolshy about their right to dance anywhere. They would be fine in the middle where there won’t be any quick-steppers.\n\nTango doesn’t present the same problem because it is at least quiet and discreet and occupies much less space than Lindy hop. I can think of a couple of women leaders who although they dance tango to everything, both have floor craft and can mostly keep out of the way of people who need line-of-dance.\n\nJust to get myself in trouble with feminists I think men usually accept the concept of rules even if they have no intention of obeying them or want them changed.\n\nWhereas women are absolutely not team players, and they just don’t care about rules if they feel like doing something different. Men are often willingly subsumed in a regiment but women are always individuals.”\n\nWell, I am not going to agree with everything there, but I am very glad that Michael has taken the trouble to respond.\n\nThe bit about Waltz being very hard to stay on the beat concerns me. I admit that I have observed one or two (ballroom) dancers that have completely missed the point, or are dancing 2 – 3 – 1 2 – 3 – 1, or just not listening to or hearing the music at all. It is perfectly feasible for this to happen, and for many reasons, eg : A person might have poor hearing, the music could be too complex or the rhythm not clear, one or both of the couple might be thinking so hard about steps they are unable to focus on the music, or there is some other over-riding factor which is blocking the couple’s ability to engage together with the music.\n\nSo, lets go back to the point of partner dancing to music. The clue is in the words ‘dancing to the music’. We must be able to hear, feel and ‘see’ the music so that that music, along with our partner, in the space available to us, becomes a whole package, a whole environment, a total experience that we can step into and enjoy without undue hindrance.\n\nWe therefore need to listen to music, and especially the music we want to dance to quite often, so that our minds and bodies recognise it easily.\n\nThis week, our Tango suggestions.\n\n1/ Listen to Argentine Tango music often.\n\nYou can listen to Argentine Tango on the internet, for example try :\n\nhttp://www.ArgentineTangoRadio.com\n\nhttp://tunein.com/radio/Tango-g3149/\n\nhttp://www.todotango.com/english has a very large index of both Music and Artists listed alphabetically. They do not have everything, but they have a lot of original recordings, and it is all free.\n\nOr, just search the internet yourself to see what you can find, either by for example the name of the tango orchestra leader, or ‘Youtube’ followed by the artist you want.\n\nHere are some examples I found easily of couples dancing to Juan D’Arienzo:\n\n‘El Flete’ by the Orquesta Tipica, Juan D’Arienzo\n\nas used in Sally Potter’s film ‘The Tango Lesson’.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-gHJ1HRjoQ\n\n‘Valsecito Criollo’ by Juan D’Arienzo (Note this is a Tango Vals , not a Vals Criollo)\n\ndanced by Kalganova Eleonora and Michael Nadtochi, New York, 2015.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GieiFMcjpD4\n\n‘Milonga, Vieja Milonga’ by Juan D’Arienzo\n\ndanced by Luna Palacios and Pablo Garcia at Biezenmortel, 2010.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbY4TdbZoLE\n\nDid listening to those three, and watching the way people danced to a regular tango, a tango vals, and a milonga help you see how tango dancers listen to and interpret the music ?\n\n2/ Keep fit and able to dance Argentine Tango.\n\nOne of Pablo Veron’s quotes is ‘that to dance well together we first must learn to dance properly on our own’. At different times I have argued with this point, on the grounds that partner dancing is a dialogue, and requires different skills. However, it is obvious to everyone that the very best show dancers are highly skilled and trained dancers. One area of dance, exercise, movement and body training which can be very useful is in ballet.\n\nWe do not need to do extreme movements, or things which hurt or can become damaging, but ballet for adult beginners can provide very useful development of our skills and body awareness.\n\nSo, after you have warmed up with a nice long walk, have a go at some of this:\n\nBallet Class for Adult Beginners, Basic Step Exercise (plie)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJxphzo7qZM\n\nAnd Deborah Sims, who taught the Royal Ballet has lots more, such as ‘Posture’\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rxLKJPByTI\n\n‘Los Ocampo’, Omar Ocampo and Monica Romero continue with their online Tango Technique classes on Thursday evenings at 8pm London time.\n\nExercises include foot work, pivots, leg flexibility, relaxation, posture, balance, dissociation, rhythm, structure, embellishments and new movements to improve your tango. Some simple props are helpful. You can get the latest schedule, themes and tips directly on your phone. Just register to their WhatsApp group by sending your first and last name by WhatsApp to\n\n++ 54 911 44150320 Monica Romero.\n\nDonations and payments can be made to www.paypal.me/losocampo\n\n3/ Develop your interest around Argentine Tango, Culture, History and general knowledge.\n\nI recommend going down the ‘Rabbit hole’ to\n\nhttps://www.todotango.com/english/\n\nThere you can find huge lists of both Artists, and Music.\n\nSo you might start scrolling through the Artists and find Anselmo Aieta for example. Suppose you click on him. Then you find a whole lot of articles which mention him.\n\nYour eye alights on one – ‘Vals criollo’, and you click on that.\n\nhttps://www.todotango.com/english/history/chronicle/268/The-vals-criollo/\n\n‘Gosh’ you say to yourself. That is a different version than Tony’s last week. { Michael is always accusing me of having a Peruvian bias. }. Whatever one person says in a broad cultural context, someone else will have a different angle. Don’t worry about it. Enjoy it. Witness A saw something different to Witness B.\n\nOver the years many people in London have organised very enjoyable and memorable Tango and dance festivals. Here is a link to the 5th London International Tango Festival, at the Porchester Hall from 13-15th November 2009 and was organised by Takis Kalogroulis of ‘Las EstrellasTango School’.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4aIvunqPks\n\nAnd this one from 3rd Tango Festival, London 2001,\n\nJohn Krook and Hanna Korpela dancing to ‘A Evaristo Carriego’.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvtL03P0i5U\n\nTakis’ adventure was the most ambitious Tango Festival in the UK at the time. He brought lots of top tango dancers and teachers. One of those I had the pleasure of doing classes with was Osvaldo Zotto, (14 May 1963 – 8 Jan 2010).\n\nhttps://www.todotango.com/english/artists/biography/1598/Osvaldo-Zotto/\n\nAlthough he performed in shows around the world organised with his brother, Miguel Angel Zotto, he was renowned for his precise Salon Tango. Osvaldo created with Mora Godoy a series of videos, which although in Spanish, are straightforward, and\n\nwell worth studying, especially for beginners and intermediate dancers :\n\n‘Asi se baila el tango. Clase 1A-YouTube’.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9qmWuXy4wk\n\nIf you play this link it leads straight on to the rest of the series, in order.\n\nIn one of Osvaldo’s classes which I attended I was partnered with a lady I had never met. She complained to Osvaldo that I was not ‘leading’ her properly. He told her that I clearly was leading her, but that she was not following. I never saw her again,\n\nso I have no idea what she expected.\n\n***** ***** *****\n\nZOOM TangoE14 Discussion Group at 4 pm Saturday 20th February.\n\nYou are invited to share interesting Tango material, videos or music links that you discover.\n\nLast week, 13th February,\n\nWe talked about the merits of learning steps versus technique.\n\nIn discussing Hedy’s link to Ivica’s Tango Mentor <ivica@tangomentor.com>\n\nand his blog post “Five articles every tango dancer must read“\n\nPaul T reckoned that many Tango classes do not usefully distinguish between Stage and Social Tango. Shan took exception to the word ‘cheap’ as applied to women dancing tango, and their clothes. But Hedy pointed out that Ivica is not a native English speaker, and one should not take his pronouncements too literally or personally.\n\nHedy’s favourite quote is ‘Cacho said the woman is not just a follower …. the leader must listen to the heart of the woman…. and make her feel special.’\n\nMervyn quoted Carlos Gavito ‘… Tango is what happens between the steps’.\n\nThen we talked about the difference in ‘connection’ with a couple dancing a tango as compared to a vals or milonga. Is there a difference ?\n\nPaul T said that in a tanda it might take the first tune, or even the whole tanda, to ‘calibrate’ a couple to each other.\n\n***** ***** ***** *****\n\n11th February 2021\n\nHola Tangueros y Amigos, Here’s wishing for us all a Happy and constructive Chinese New Year. Friday 12th February is the first day of the year of the Ox.\n\nLet’s change tack today and talk once more about Tango Vals (Waltz). How does it fit with Argentine Tango ? What is the difference between Ballroom Waltz, Viennese Waltz, and Tango Vals ?\n\nI will say that Ballroom Waltz is the slowest and easiest for social dancers that do not dance much, or who do not want to take dance lessons. The slow 1 – 2 – 3 – 1 – 2 – 3 – rhythm and pattern is easy to understand, and easy to step or walk to. There is a slight emphasis on the ‘One’, but you still usually step on or mark the other beats. As one develops understanding, ability and feel for the music it becomes possible to stretch moves to take up more than one beat.\n\nViennese Waltz is faster, and many Ballroom Dancers feel intimidated by it. Some ballroom dancers that have a little bit of training in Viennese Waltz seem to go out of their way to intimidate other lesser dancers, and bully or effectively push them off the floor by whizzing round the floor showing off. Unfortunately some of these cases are like sports cars without brakes. But a proper dancer should be able to steer, navigate the floor, stop when necessary, and avoid collisions. I have seen couples who expect to have the entire floor to show off their lengthy, complicated, expertly choreographed (and probably learnt through many expensive classes) routine. They might look quite good when they do have the whole floor, but they are useless on a busy social floor.\n\nTango Vals might not be much different to Viennese Waltz. If you listen to waltzes played by Francisco Canaro for example, especially his earlier recordings, you will ask ‘what is the difference’? { Answers and observations by email please }\n\nWhen I listen to Pugliese’s Valses I definitely feel the Tango flavour. Tango Vals is sometimes called ‘Vals Cruzada’ or ‘Vals Sincopa’. ‘Vals Criollo’ is different in style, and is more common in other Latin American countries, especially Peru. If you want to disappear down another rabbit hole (on computer) you can look at Peruvian folk music, Vals Peruana, Marinera etc, and realise there are probably other largely unacknowledged ingredients emanating from Peru in to what became Tango. Remember that 250 years ago Argentina was just part of the Vice-royalty of Peru. You can hear that there are various complex rhythmic patterns, as are often ascribed to Cuba, but were probably quite widespread in the Latin New World, due also partly to the cross pollination of African rhythms with both the Latin and the indigenous music cultures.\n\nTango Vals can be even faster than an average Viennese, but not necessarily. Often a Tango Vals has more variability of speed. The rhythm might speed up or slow down. Using our Tango skills we can vary our moves to fit the music. We could just step on One and pause, or take the whole ‘1 2 3’ to move. We can dance quickly on every little beat, but we find this becomes tiring and tedious. We could dance 12 and not 3, or 1-31 and not 2, or whatever you like and can do. We can take very long slow moves that draw out or savour the music. But whatever we do, we are aware of our partner and the music, and of course those around us.\n\nCan you dance Tango Vals style to Viennese, or vice versa ? The answer is ‘Yes but -‘ Problems arise with the different dance cultures. A couple dancing Viennese style in a Milonga may get dirty looks for their overtaking if nothing else; that is assuming the milonga is not so crowded as to make overtaking impossible. A couple dancing Tango Vals in a ballroom setting will get dirty looks for not keeping up with the speed of the ronda if they execute moves which do not move forward quickly. If on the other hand they do travel at the same speed as everyone else, they still might run into problems with the fact that most Viennese Waltz moves are well known and predictable by those who have been trained in them. Argentine Tango Vals allows much more possibilities of outcome, so other dancers can easily make wrong predictions of where you are going next. Alternatively, the Tango Vals couple might see a space they could occupy, only to be proven wrong by a Viennese couple coming in very quickly from an unexpected angle.\n\nSo if one chooses to experiment in such situations, do so carefully and considerately, and accept that even then you may still make mistakes.\n\nFrom a different perspective, this is not absolutely true, nor is it a lie, one could consider Tango to be a joining of March music ( 1 – 2 – 3 – 4 – etc ) with Waltz music.\n\nSo you might try:- 1 2 3 4 123123123123 which is possible,\n\nOr 1 2 123123 also possible.\n\nBut what about 1 2 3 4 1.2.3 1 2 It doesn’t look right. Can we make it fit ?\n\nSimplistically, this is the refrain from ‘La Cumparsita’. We have four ‘march’ steps, (a slight pause or intake of breath where we change gear), three quick little steps, ( another tiny pause/breath/change), and then two ‘march’ steps. That completes the musical phrase of 8 beats.\n\nSo by practising our Tango skills and our Vals skills, we continue to grow and refine our clarity and ability of movement, to hold a steady rhythm, change rhythm, pause and communicate that with our partner.\n\nThis week, our Tango suggestions. 1/ Listen to Argentine Tango music often.\n\nThis week listen to lots of Tango Vals by your favouite orchestras. See how these dancers interpret the music:\n\nCarlos Espinoza and Noelia Hurtado ,Tango Vals at TangoMagia, 2012, to a remastered version of ‘Violetas’ sung by Alberto Castillo. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgymcF6Oubs\n\nGustavo Rosas and Gisela Natoli, Tango Vals, Sicily, 2015, to ‘Pobre Flor’.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KQ-5DQ8a7M\n\nGiovanni Perego and Chiara Costa, Tango Nuevo Vals to the music of ‘Sting’.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tqAWarNji8\n\nMarco Pereira and Florencia Borgina, California,Tango Mundial finalists 2018. Vals, ‘Jugando, Jugando’, Miguel Calo. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBa8Cz2AK-o\n\nTango Vals – Walks and Rhythm, with Daniel Noce, Chicago. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF8DSTPYEOw\n\n2/ Keep fit and able to dance Argentine Tango. After you have had your daily walk, you might find this exercise video appropriate: ‘5 Minutes to stronger knees’ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NbeEibKmt0&feature=emb_rel_end She also has other exercise videos.\n\nThe next time you are going for a walk, try counting Tango Vals basic rhythms in your head, 1 2 3 1 2 3 etc. Take long steps just on the ‘One’, but make that step last for all the time available in that ‘1 2 3’. In other words, don’t walk ‘1’ then stop still for 2 and 3 ! Just walk steadily and comfortably for at least two or three minutes and allow your breathing to synchronise with your walking, and be aware of what you are doing.\n\nNow try shorter and quicker steps on every beat , 1 2 3 1 2 3.\n\nNow the same, except on step 2 ‘cross behind. In other words: 1) A short step forward with L, 2) Cross R behind L, 3) A short step forward with L, 4) A short step forward with R, 5) Cross L behind R, 6) A short step forward with R. Continue repeating this, and feel comfortable with yourself that you are doing it with a regular rhythm.\n\nNow try mixing, say, four long slow steps, with four sets of triple steps.\n\nThink about the dancers videos (above) that you have watched. Can you do some of the things they do ?\n\n3/ Develop your interest around Argentine Tango, Culture, History and general knowledge.\n\nPaul kindly forwarded this link to a video made about the last ‘Negracha’ milonga held in the Kensington College of Business, Wild Court, Holborn on 9th February 2018. It operated there for 14 years before moving around various venues. https://youtu.be/YI2SSQM3PHk\n\nIf anyone has news of where Ivan Arandia and ‘Negracha’ intend to restart after Covid, do let us know.\n\nOver the years many people in London have organised very enjoyable and memorable Tango and dance festivals. Today I will mention Kele Baker who ran ‘Tango Al Fresco’ as part of her ‘Dance Al Fresco’ in Regents Park. This enterprise was discontinued a few years ago, but in the first video below filmed in 2010 you can see what went into running this event. The proceeds went to Regents Park for tree planting. In 2010 the guest tango teachers and performers were Junior Cervila and Natalia Royo. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI_fAPXjzyw\n\nIn 2008 the performers were Bruno Tombari and Mariangeles Caamano https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkxgQmRMMMQ Bruno and Mariangeles are dancing to ‘Saludos’. This piece was first recorded by Domingo Federico in 1944. It was written by Domingo and his father Francisco Federico in 1944. Domingo was a very talented composer, teacher, orchestra leader and bandoneonist. For more details about him see https://www.todotango.com/english/artists/biography/732/Domingo-Federico/\n\n***** ***** *****\n\nZOOM TangoE14 Discussion Group this Saturday afternoon, 13th February.\n\nLast week, 6th February, Shan gave us this on ‘Walking in close embrace’, and asked if we noticed anything unusual? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfn8cJ2pZhE&feature=youtu.be\n\nMervyn found ‘Ballerina with Alzheimer’s hears Swan Lake, begins to dance’: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT8AdwV0Vkw&list=PLUnT7s2pQI2M_7_89FVobdgm_CdD3wBcq&index=7\n\n{ Fay Laflin, one of our visiting teachers, has experience in this area.}\n\nMusic Medicine: Sound at a cellular level, Dr Lee Bartel (+disclaimer from TED talks)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDZgzsQh0Dw\n\nIn addition to discussion on vibrations, Tim spoke on the benefits of properly sprung dance floors.\n\nLater, Mervyn also found these amusing links of Tango dancing with a dummy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GV2HaF7jRM&list=PLUnT7s2pQI2MZvJBKyy_EjwRgxXBU-a0I&index=1&t=5s\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI0O35MVUto&list=PLUnT7s2pQI2MZvJBKyy_EjwRgxXBU-a0I&index=3\n\nYou never realised that thinking about and discussing Argentine Tango could take you into so many different places ! Why not join us.\n\n***** ***** ***** *****\n\n3rd February 2021\n\nHola Tangueros y Amigos, Thinking about Social Argentine Tango as opposed to Stage, or performance, or choreographed tango, we often say that it is all about communication, connection and can be likened to a conversation.\n\nFor our last week’s zoom meeting I found a link inspired by Mervyn’s interest in ‘Empathic Listening’, Empathic Listening: Definition and Exercises (healthline.com)\n\nIn summary the writer, Cindy Lamothe in 2019, made ten points about Empathic Listening in a Conversation:\n\n1/ Correct body language. eg face each other, maintain eye contact. 2/ Clear away (all) distractions. 3/ Listen without judging. 4/ Don’t make it about you. 5/ Be present. Slow down and wait for pauses before you jump in. 6/ Pay attention to non-verbal clues, especially body language. 7/ Avoid offering solutions. 8/ Don’t downplay their concerns. Be conscious of uncomfortable feelings. 9/ Reflect back their feelings. 10/ Don’t worry about getting it wrong.\n\nWe all agreed that this list could be remarkably well applied to our approach to Tango, how we interact with our partner, how we connect, how we embrace, and how we dance.\n\nWhat do you think ?\n\nSome of the other points in relation to Tango that came out of our discussion: -The Leader has to understand and know where the Follower is at any moment. How to guage the Followers position, movement, and momentum. – The ‘Best’ Leaders or Followers are not necessarily those that will give the best dance. – One can have a lot of fun with a dancer you have not met before. – We should learn to savour each movement together with the music, like savouring a good wine, rather than just rushing through a well rehearsed sequence. – In conversation we need to articulate our words clearly, and in tango we should be clear in our movements, and what we hope for from our partner. – We noted the difference between the ‘rules’ or etiquette of a Practica compared to a Milonga. – Don’t criticise. – But many said they appreciated feedback, or useful suggestions. So presumably the guideline here is to be sensitive as to what is appropriate, and when. – We should all try to be nicer people.\n\nFurther to Shan’s interest in tango paintings, Tony has found this video of Murat Erdemsel’s painting showing his interpretation of ‘Poema’ (played by Francisco Canaro’s Orchestra). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XgiRzUQx_g (3.41).\n\nIf you want a longer explanation (23.32), look at ‘Form of tango music 3, A TANGO’ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxFviaNy5ps\n\nFinally, Mervyn forwarded this from <bridget@tangowimbledon.co.uk>. -Free stretching taster class this Sunday at 11am for 30-40 minutes. -FREE Tango exercise taster class: Tuesday 9 February Contact Bridget for the ZOOM link. Bridget says ‘ Please do not attend a stretching session if you suffer from acute or chronic pain in the lower back, or consult your doctor before doing so. Class schedule: https://www.tangowimbledon.co.uk/class-schedule/\n\nThis week, our Tango suggestions. 1/ Listen to Argentine Tango music often, and watch closely to see how different dancers interpret the music.\n\nAs a tribute to Juan Carlos Copes (31/5/1931-16/1/2021), https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Carlos_Copes we give you a few links to his dancing:\n\n1974 film ‘This is my Argentina’, Juan and Maria Nieves https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BBp0hqEXfE\n\n2011, Johana Copes dancing with her father in the ‘Tango Salon’ final https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xenMOnrNddk\n\n2013, ‘Juan Carlos Copes tengo una pregunta para vos..’ [Interview with English subtitles] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewlTss5oMQU&t=736s\n\n2016 ‘El ultimo tango’,History of the life and love of Maria Nieves Rego and Juan Carlos Copes.

If you go down to ‘MORE’ on the video details, you will get lots more. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZO9P8rHUX7A&t=37s\n\n2/ Keep fit and able to dance Argentine Tango.\n\nHave a look at this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ka7B3hCg08 What will happen to your body if you walk every day’.\n\nA little advice from Mina and Giraldo; ‘Life isn’t about waiting for the storm to pass, it’s about learning to dance in the rain’. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0DIMdhgcGQ&feature=youtu.be\n\nThey are also doing online/zoom workouts on Tuesday evenings. See contact@Corrientes Social Club\n\nTony points out that if you go walking, and practising your dance movements, and doing exercises when it is raining (not too hard !), or while the ground is still wet, you may find that you can pivot and turn more easily on wet smooth surfaces if you have the right shoes. You do not need good shoes for this. Just be careful not to fall over !\n\nSo there is no excuse. Get out and move about.\n\nLast week we mentioned Junior Cervila and Carlos Gavito.We encourage you to look again closely at these dancers and learn from them.\n\nJunior and Natalia are technically very polished dancers. For example, look at the precision they show with their giros in this video: At 1.16 he controls her to pivot on two feet while he walks around her. At 1.28 he pivots on his R foot and planeos with his L, while leading her to giro round him. At 1.57 he leads her to pivot on her L and invites her to planeo with her R, while he walks round her. At 2.23 he does a cross basic salida, so that at 2.27 he is crossed L behind R, and she is crossed R behind L. He then leads her anticlockwise giro (-side R-back L-side R-fwd L) while he pivots with his feet in a cross. Note that he is mainly pivoting actually on the front of his back (L) foot.As they continue to start their second giro he sacadas with his R, and they walk out. This is all perfectly understandable, but to be able to do it neatly, precisely, and to the music requires balance, control and understanding of ones core. All those exercises, giros, dissociation, and strength of leg and thigh muscles are important.\n\nJunior Cervila & Natalia Royo (to ‘Sinsabor’, Edgardo Donato) 2013 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=___LddTD9yk\n\nCarlos and Maria are usually dancing more slowly, although they do sometimes spice things up with some rapid movements. They are showing us how they savour the music and each other. Carlos Gavito and Maria Plazaolla (to ‘El Ingeniero’, Carlos Di Sarli)2003. .https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfeejNrQ2WE\n\n3/ Develop your interest around Argentine Tango, Culture, History and general knowledge.\n\nReminiscing about Argentine Tango culture and development in London I will today mention Ivan Arandia. I first met Ivan in 1995 at classes run near Brixton by Alison Vale and Eduardo from Chile. Ivan was quicker to pick up tango than me, had a more reliable partner, and probably spent more time on it. He later danced in Tango shows and taught it. In about 2008 when Danny and Diana moved their ‘Tango the Argentino Way’ from the Welsh Centre to ‘Carablanca’ in the Conway Hall, Ivan went head to head with another Friday Night Milonga near Holborn, which he called ‘Negracha’.( I am open to be corrected if any of this is not quite right). Negracha was held in a venue in Wild Court, off Kingsway. The main hall upstairs was not as big as the Conway Hall, but it did have another hall downstairs. So they ran a milonga with two floors. Mainly traditional tango upstairs, and more experimental or tango nuevo downstairs. They also ran classes at the beginning of the evening, with many excellent visiting teachers, but their milonga went until 1am or later. Consequently quite a lot of younger and newer dancers opted for Negracha. Some people went to Carablanca early, and then finished their evening at Negracha, which was only a short walk away. Negracha’s format was quite successful, and amazingly both Negracha and Carablanca not only survived but thrived and consolidated Argentine Tango in London.\n\nBy then the Tango community had grown considerably. Unfortunately the Wild Court venue was closed as the building was earmarked for redevelopment. So Negracha moved to other venues in South London. We understand they more recently operated in Balham and Kingston on Thames. If anyone has up to date information about Negracha, we would be pleased to hear it.\n\nAt Wild Court the atmosphere was less formal than Carablanca. The floor upstairs was not big enough to have many tables, and moving around by non-dancers during tandas was discouraged, especially once it got crowded. The downstairs floor usually offered a bit more room, but not always. Some people preferred a Cabeceo to agree a dance, but a polite approach or request usually worked fine.The range of dance skills exhibited varied. A small minority of people seemed oblivious to simple concepts such as sticking to the line of dance, keep moving forward, and not holding the other dancers up. There was a small risk of injury, such as being trodden on or being struck by an inappropriate move. But it generally had a good vibe, and was certainly popular. Ivan deserves our appreciation for his work in providing different and special tango evenings.\n\n***** ***** *****\n\nZOOM TangoE14 Discussion Group, 4pm on Saturday afternoon:\n\nLast week, 30th January, we talked about applying the suggestions of ‘Empathic Listening’ to Tango, and discussed other ways we might improve our connection to our partners, which we mentioned at the top of this newsletter.\n\nMervyn raised the idea of considering ones ‘thinking levels’. It could be considered on a scale from ‘0 to 10’, so that at Zero we would be in a state of deep meditation, and at 10 we would be in a state of panic. At about 4 – 5 the mind is in a measured state where there is no hindrance or ‘cloud’ over our perception and relationship to our surroundings, and information is understood.\n\nThis idea may partly explain some difficulties we have such as overthinking a situation. Initially we have to concentrate on a new task, and may be quite anxious about it, such as learning to drive. But once we are familiar and practised at it we become more able to multitask, eg driving a car and having a conversation. Some of us recognised similarities to our experiences with learning and developing our tango skills.\n\nGraham suggested it is worth taking a more ‘Zen’ or relaxed approach to both learning tango and to social dancing. Lower ones anxiety, be more open to sense ones partner, and being more ‘in the moment’.\n\nMervyn showed this link about an ‘animal whisperer’ and developing empathy with animals. https://trust-technique.com/lessons/building-trust-connection/\n\nWe also discussed the process of learning. Shan mentioned the theories of B.F.Skinner, an American psychologist, and his concept of ‘negative reinforcement’ (getting a smack if you get it wrong). Graham countered that a punitive approach will embed anxiety, and the activity becomes a burden. In dancing we are there to have a good time, and therefore should remove negativity. Paul suggested that not everybody goes to Tango to have a good time !\n\nGraham also recommended the film ‘White Crow’ about Rudolf Nureyev.\n\nYou never realised that thinking about and discussing Argentine Tango could take you into so many different places ! Why not join us.\n\n***** ***** ***** *****\n\n28th January 2021\n\nHola Tangueros y Amigos, Firstly a very sad announcement. Juan Carlos Copes, b. 31 May 1931 in BsAs, died on 16th January 2021 from Covid-19 which he only contracted in BsAs in December. He is credited as the first to put choreographed Tango into a full stage production. In doing so he had a huge impact on the global popularity of Argentine Tango. However, he consequently bears a lot of blame for the idea that Tango is all about choreography. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Carlos_Copes\n\nLet us reflect a moment on what Argentine Tango means to us. What is the purpose of TangoE14 and this newsletter ? At the moment, because of the Corona Virus restrictions, we are just trying to keep the flame of interest in Tango and dance alive. To encourage us all to keep fit and well and able to dance when we eventually can. To grow our knowledge of Argentine Tango and all the ingredients and influences that have gone into, and continue to go into it. And very importantly, to keep our extended community together. We do not have to always agree with each other on everything, but it is worth acknowledging that we have a common interest, and it is very worthwhile keeping in touch. Many Tango and other dance events have ceased altogether, and we wonder if and when and how they may reappear. A few dedicated souls in London such as Corrientes. Raquel Greenberg, and Tanguito soldier on with online courses and workshops.\n\nWe continue with this newsletter and our free TangoE14 ZOOM discussions.\n\nLet’s just remember some of the Milongas we used to go to. I invite you all to tell me stories about the different Milongas and Festivals you have been to.\n\nToday I will mention ‘Carablanca’. Danny Evans and Diana Syrat started ‘Tango the Argentino Way’ a long time ago. They must have been amongst the first to bring Tango to London in a practical and accessible way. Then they moved to the Welsh Centre, Gray’s Inn Road, in the mid 1990s.\n\n(Tell me when Diana ?)\n\nFriday night Tango at the Welsh Centre was the backbone of the London, and arguably the UK Tango scene at the time. I reckoned the total number of people doing Argentine Tango in London at that time could only have been a couple of hundred, and not many more throughout the whole UK. Every week the Welsh Centre had visiting maestros, many of whom were world class. They started early about 7pm I think, and finished quite early too, about 10.30 pm-ish I think, which was one of the reasons that Tango The Argentino Way eventually moved to the Conway Hall in Red Lion Square.\n\nI first went to Tango at the Welsh Centre in 1995. One of my abiding memories was the evening Junior Suarez Cervila was the guest teacher. The majority of London’s ‘would be’ tango dancers at that time were ballroom dancers of sorts, and most people’s understanding of what Tango really was and how to go about it was very limited. Nobody had much idea of posture, attitude, connection or even ‘how to walk’. Then, almost magically, Junior’s sheer presence had over a hundred assorted people, simply JUST WALKING, all together, with posture, elegance, attitude and timing, forwards and backwards.\n\nWhen Danny and Diana moved in 2008 from the Welsh Centre to the Conway Hall and called their milonga ‘Carablanca’ things changed. For one thing by then there were quite a lot more people doing Argentine Tango, and many teachers. Some of the early students at the Welsh Centre started their own classes, Milongas and even Festivals. I had already in 2006 started teaching on Saturday afternoons near DLR Crossharbour. Ivan Arandia started another Friday evening milonga called ‘Negracha’. So now there were many more dancers, and more opportunities to dance.\n\n‘Carablanca’ changed . It had already become the most long standing, and well known milonga in London. But now it aspired to be the best; the most ‘authentic’, whatever that means. So there is more attention to the music played, and they have a steady stream of arguably the best Tango DJs.\n\nThis week, our Tango suggestions.\n\n1/ Listen to Argentine Tango music often, and watch closely to see how different dancers interpret the music.\n\nJunior Cervila and Guillermina Quiroga to ‘Quejas de bandoneon’, in 2017. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDiQPM_lSuw\n\nJunior Cervila & Natalia Royo dance to ‘Sinsabor’, Edgardo Donato & his orchestra, Horacio Lagos, Lita Morales, New York City. Saturday, March 2, 2013 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=___LddTD9yk\n\nCarlos Gavito and Maria Plazaolla dance to ‘El Ingeniero’, by the Carlos Di Sarli Orchestra. Performed on the 2nd of May 2003 at the Welsh Centre, London (UK). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfeejNrQ2WE\n\nCarlos Gavito and Marcela Duran dance to ‘La Cumparsita’ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QpICrr96SM\n\nCarlos Eduardo Gavito, 27 April 1942 – 1 July 2005 { Source Wikipedia }. He started to dance in 1956 in BsAs. His wife Helen qualified from the Scottish Royal Ballet School. In 1974 Carlos Gavito worked with Juan Carlos Copes. Copes is credited as being the first to bring choreographed tango to full stage performances. In 1995 Gavito went to dance with and become a star in the ‘Forever Tango’ show, but Helen was not invited as the producer only wanted Argentinian dancers.\n\nI was told in conversation many years ago that Juan Carlos Copes and the producers wanted Carlos Gavito to stick to choreography. Gavito flatly refused and said that he danced the feeling. He danced how he felt and how he connected to his partner. So his dancing was never exactly the same. But he became a star of the shows, and one of the clearest advocates that Argentine Tango is really all about connection and feeling, not choreography. However, you can see that Marcela Duran, who is a choreographer, clearly did affect his dancing. Through his career he obviously must have been materially affected by and learned from the other trained dancers he worked with.\n\nI have no details on the life of Junior Cervila, but I understand that he is a dancer with a very solid background of dance training. If anyone has any other details, please let me know.\n\n2/ Keep fit and able to dance Argentine Tango.\n\nYou are probably all sick of me keep telling you to go for walks, and keep moving. But it is important to be as well and fit and supple and balanced as you can be. A little challenge when out walking: Walk to the beat in your head, then at some point cross behind your supporting leg, and pivot on the ball of your supporting foot. What shoes and what surfaces work best for this ? Can you do this without falling over ? Can you pivot a full turn (360 degrees) ? Can you control your axis and your turn all the time ? Can you choose whether to continue walking forward with the foot that was crossed behind, or change weight and walk forward with the front foot ?\n\nHave you looked at the two leading dancers above in section 1 ? They are quite different, yet both elegant and musical. Junior shows his sharp technical skills as well as his tango musicality. Carlos and his partners, with his trademark ‘Apilada’ embrace (ie: with a pronounced lean) show how elegant slow tango is, but spice it up a bit with interjections of occasional flashes of quick or dramatic movement.\n\nCan you copy any of their movements ? Do you see their musical interpretation ?\n\n3/ Develop your interest around Argentine Tango, Culture, History and general knowledge.\n\nLets look at the prevaling culture of what is considered by many to be a ‘proper’ Milonga. We can get some ideas from looking at some aspects of ‘Carablanca’ in London.\n\na/ Floor: The hall is a reasonable size, nearly 14 metres wide and slightly longer. But once tables are put around the edge, then the danceable area is reduced to approximately 9×9 metres or less. It is possible to have 100 couples on the floor. That is 200 dancers, but at that density then it is essential for everyone to follow the lines of dance. There could be three or even four ‘lanes’, and people are expected to not persistently and repeatedly change lane. With only 0.8 square metre per couple there is not much room to move, so it is essential for couples to keep their dancing ‘close’. Large movements such as voleos or anything which might intrude in the space of another couple are avoided. The couple is limited to dancing in their own confined space. In reality when Carablanca is full, people tend not to dance all the time, so maybe only half of them are dancing. There is also the balcony upstairs with plenty of seating, and often people like to go up with a drink and watch the dancers from above. If you want room to move and travel, then the best time is at the beginning. It normally starts at eight and the first hour offers plenty of space. There is room for 25 couples to dance expressively as long as they always remember there are other people on the floor. Typically, the number of people attending can range from 100 to 200, usually somewhere in the middle.\n\nb/ Tables: There are usually four tables along two sides, and three on the entrance side. The fourth side has the stage, with no tables in front. The tables along the sides each have 4 chairs, then a narrow walking space, with more seating or chairs along the wall. The layout is set up with the intention that people do not walk across the dance floor when dancers are dancing.\n\nc/ Bar: At Carablanca the bar has been located in the hall, on the right of the entrance. This works when it is not too crowded, but recent events organised by Beto have seen the bar relegated to the foyer.\n\nd/ DJ and music: The DJs have styles, or formats which usually conform to an accepted protocol. Typically the music is played in ‘Tandas’ (sets). Usually a tanda of 3 or 4 Tangos is followed by a short musical interlude, a ‘Cortina’. The music of the cortina is not meant to be danced to. Then there is a second tanda also of 3 or 4 Tangos. After each tanda the Cortina is long enough for people to clear the floor, and maybe find a new partner. After two Tango tandas there is a tanda of (Tango) Waltzes (Vals). Always a cortina between each tanda. The Vals tanda is followed by two more tandas of Tango. Then there is a tanda of 3 Milongas. Then the pattern starts again, with different pieces of course.\n\nA typical tanda layout is sometimes summarised –\n\n[ T=Tango, V=Vals, M=Milonga, C=Cortina ]\n\n– T T T T C T T T T C V V V C T T T T C T T T T C M M M C –\n\nSometimes DJs might have longer or shorter tandas if they feel like it.\n\ne/ ‘Cabeceo’, the invitation to dance. A ‘Cabeceo’ (a little movement of the head) or a ‘Mirada’ (a look) is often used as a way of inviting, accepting or refusing a dance, but this is not compulsory. Some people claim that it is better to only use the Cabeceo because it avoids the embarrassment of refusal. I suspect that for some people they use this as a form of exclusivity. As far as I am concerned, a Milonga is a social event and we go to meet new people, to dance and to share that special musical and social environment. I have visited Milongas in many countries including Argentina, Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand as well as the UK, and I will say ‘Don’t be too shy. It does not hurt to politely ask.’ Once you know other people, or have danced with them, an accepting glance is all that is necessary. However, it is perfectly sensible to politely ask someone new to dance, but remember they may also refuse. We hope that requests, refusals or acceptances can be done politely. But sadly there are some people in all walks of life that give the impression of being rude, snobbish, intolerant, arrogant or just plain unpleasant.\n\nJust try and allow any unpleasantness to fall away.\n\n***** ***** *****\n\nZOOM TangoE14 Discussion Group, 4 pm Saturday 30th January.\n\nLast week, 23rd January, continuing from earlier discussion about the Tango Embrace, Mervyn and John commented on the variations of embrace ranging from an equal and opposite lean and pressure pairing , to one that appears to be where the woman is really leaning (out of axis) on the man. He is still leaning forward to take her weight, but is relatively more upright. This is sometimes known as ‘Apilada’. It is clearly demonstrated in the dancing style of Carlos Gavito, although he and his partner are not in that position all the time. [ See the links earlier in this newsletter ]. This extreme position can be very tiring for the lady, and hard for her back, so I do not recommend it.\n\nTony then recounted his indirect encounter with Carlos Gavito by having the pleasure of dancing with Eileen McIntyre. In about 1994/95 Carlos Gavito was teaching tango at ‘Tango the Argentino Way’ at the Welsh Centre. He did not have a regular partner to teach with, but for some of the time he was partnered by Eileen. Although she and her partner Des were champion Ballroom and Latin dancers, her dance and life partner did not want to start something new in his 70s. Eileen accepted Carlos Gavito’s direction and skill completely, and without criticism, realising that Argentine Tango was not Ballroom Tango, but started from a completely different place. In 1995 when Carlos joined a touring show, some people asked Eileen to teach tango. She refused, saying she knew nothing about it. By about 2000 Tony had been learning Argentine Tango for over 5 years, and was still struggling. “I was still going to Ballroom and Swing classes as well. I had decided in 1995 that I would be a dancer, but at my age I would concentrate on partner dance. So I wanted to do them all. One day I went to an afternoon Ballroom class taught by Eileen near Aldgate East. After the class there was dancing. I asked Eileen if she would do an Argentine Tango with me. She agreed and we found a suitable piece to play. She stood there and presented herself to me, ready to dance. I took her in my arms in a conventional Argentine Tango embrace. At that moment I nearly broke down and cried. I thought to myself ‘You can’t dance. You are a fraud.’ But straight away I resolved ‘ Come on Tony, you can do this’. We were connected. So what now ? A simple slow step to the side. We were moving. A basic salida, carefully and together to the music. Another salida, a cross. I don’t know what we did, or what order we did things. We just did those basic elements; salida, cross, ochos, giros and so on. When we finished everyone clapped, and a couple of people said it was extremely beautiful. What happened ? I had a partner that waited for my lead, that’s all. “\n\n***** ***** ***** *****\n\n21st January 2021\n\nHola Tangueros y Amigos, A shorter TangoE14 Newsletter this week. But we invite your comments, suggestions and contributions.\n\nThis week, our Tango suggestions. 1/ Listen to Argentine Tango music often.\n\nLook for new groups and musicians, and research the old ones. Listen to the different styles, for dancing, for song, for atmosphere. A new tango group: Bandonegro, concert in 2020 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXwaN8CwFGE&feature=youtu.be [ Note this is a long video, but there is nothing at the start, so skip to ’22 minutes’ before starting.]\n\nA 1990 recording of a 1926 tango song: Raul Garello, b. 3 Jan 1931 (BsAs) -29 Sept 2016 Bandoneonista, director and composer. In 1990 he recorded this 1926 tango, ‘Viejo ciego’ ( Old blind man ), sung by Roberto Goyeneche. It is a melodramatic piece, emphasised by Goyeneche’s voice.\n\nThe first lines: ‘Con un lazarillo llegas por las noches trayendo las quejas del viejo violin.’ ( With a blind man’s guide you arrive at night bringing the complaints of the old violin. )\n\nAnd finishing with: ‘A ver, viejo ciego, toca un tango lerdo, muy lerdo y muy triste, que quiero llorar.’ (‘ Let’s see, old blind man, Play a slow tango, Very slow and very sad, So that (it makes me) want to cry.’) https://www.todotango.com/creadores/ficha/777/Raul-Garello\n\nhttps://www.todotango.com/creadores/ficha/159/Roberto-Goyeneche\n\n2/ Keep fit and able to dance Argentine Tango.\n\nWhen you go for a walk, try changing speed, and change the size of your steps. Can you walk steadily to your internal rhythm, then take lots of little steps at twice, or three times or even four times the speed; and then come out of that and back to your steady walk. Count how many little steps you are taking, and note to yourself how well you fit those to your regular rhythm. Now try breaking into a short run. How many running steps do you take before you change the speed of your breathing ? Try running up a gentle slope or hill. Feel comfortable with your normal breathing and walking, and experiment to discover how much reserve capacity you have for those extra energetic movements or changes of speed that require more breath. Can you hold your breath for a couple of steps ?\n\nYou have to breathe in oxygen, and you have to get rid of carbon dioxide by breathing out; and you need a bit of reserve capacity for when a bit of extra effort is required.\n\nMichael suggested these links on Technique and Specific Moves and Figures which you can just watch, or try out at home: Have a look at them. They are useful, but you may also make observations or criticisms. If you have any points you wish to make, please email your ideas to Tony.\n\nTekla Gogrichiani – Tango Women’s Technique – Music ‘El Huracan’ by Solo Tango: (3 minutes) https://youtu.be/p2nut8Jo2Sw\n\nArgentine Tango 50 steps.

Remembranzas, Mina and Giraldo’s playground sketches for TangoWorkout 2.1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0DIMdhgcGQ&feature=youtu.be\n\n3/ Develop your interest around Argentine Tango, Culture, History and general knowledge. Sometimes I compare and contrast the development of Swing dancing in the USA with the development of Tango in Argentina.\n\nOf course there are many other dances that developed in Latin America, most obviously in Cuba and Brazil. But Swing and Tango have travelled the world probably the most. I say that these two are a fusion of the music and cultures of three distinct groups, namely European, African and Native Americans. Then, of course, there is the influence of the environment in which they formed; the physical, economic, political, historical and other factors.\n\nOne of the factors Tango and Swing have in common is that they are ‘Free’ dances. They are not owned, controlled, patented, or directed by anyone or group. Although of course, there are individuals, schools, and other interests who claim rights or authority over them. Obviously, schools of dance, teachers, and organisers of competitions have an interest in both promoting their business and in defining what it is they are promoting. However, we can note that in 2009 UNESCO declared that Tango was part of the cultural heritage of mankind ( Patrimonio cultural de la humanidad ). The Argentine Minister of Culture at the time said he felt proud about the decision. https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/tango-00258\n\nhttps://www.lanacion.com.ar/cultura/declaran-el-tango-patrimonio-cultural-de-la-humanidad-nid1180674/\n\nAlthough Swing and Tango contain many cultural ingredients in common, the ‘Flour, Milk, Fruits etc’ that went into the pot, there are very different specific ingredients, processes and methods of cooking.\n\nOne question that is simple to ask but not so easy to answer is why we do not usually have drums in a Tango Orchestra, yet they are usually predominant in a Swing Band ? Your thoughts and observations on this are always appreciated.\n\nIt may be fair to say that the African ingredient in Swing music was always greater, and that the Europeans that joined it emulated the musical styles they encountered , and consolidated that. Whereas the immigration to Argentina in the late 1800s and early 1900s had a very high proportion of Italians. That group clearly had an immense influence on the development of Tango. There can be no doubt that the Italians carried with them the significant cultural luggage of musical skills, musical instruments, ability and understanding of composition, and the necessary discipline required. They clearly must have taken Criollo Tango and lifted it to another level.\n\nAnother question I hope is not offensive: Is there a correlation between acceptance of discipline and acceptance of Fascism or Authoritarian control ?\n\nWriters such as Jorge Luis Borges regretted that the original bravery of tango had been replaced by unbelievable and decadent sobbing. He made a distinction between ‘Criollo Tango’ and another one spoiled by gringos ( European immigrants ). However Ricardo Ostuni points out that many of the words of early tango songs were also composed by Italians. https://www.todotango.com/english/history/chronicle/397/Italian-immigration-and-tango/\n\n***** ***** *****\n\nSaturday 23rdJanuary, ZOOM TangoE14 Discussion Group at 4 pm.\n\nYou are invited to share interesting Tango material, videos or music links that you discover. On 16th January, Hedy shared “Aires de Milonga” https://youtu.be/nGtP-e31Pk8 and we discussed Social Tango.\n\nMervyn shared this link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVPLIuBy9CY ‘FOLI’ means rhythm by Malinke tribes. There is no movement without rhythm. It is found in every part of daily life, not just drumming or dancing.\n\nShan showed a selection of Tango paintings. And we had a detailed conversation about the Tango Embrace.\n\n***** ***** ***** *****\n\n16th January 2021\n\nHola Tangueros y Amigos,\n\n‘La lucha continua’ – The struggle continues. Or in English we might say ‘Chin up everyone. Keep going.’\n\nOne of the things we do is our free Saturday afternoon TangoE14 discussion group; details further down.\n\nOur TangoE14 members like to enjoy Tango, dance and life in general. We like to grow our understanding and appreciation of it at our own pace, and share that with our friends and others.\n\nLast week Shan recapped a few points that interested her: ‘What happens in the brain when we listen to music, particularly music we enjoy ? The brain itself treats music we enjoy and music we don’t like differently. Music we like impacts our prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain which releases chemicals in response to pleasurable experiences, such as food, drugs and sex. The brains of musicians show higher levels than average of serotonin. Dancers too have high levels of serotonin. Four chemicals associated with pleasurable experiences are serotonin, oxytocin, dopamine and endorphins. Oxytocin is released by touch and improves bonding. Trance too leads to feelings of bonding and has been used by the military and in sports training to enhance feelings of bonding and unification. Thinking about how vibrations affect humans when dancing I realised that all physical objects vibrate. When we dance our vibrations can match and synchronise. I also mentioned a music vibration installation called Longplayer in Trinity Buoy Wharf in London. It consists of 20 Tibetan sound bowls which began vibrating 20 years ago and will continue to do so for 1000 years. It can be visited online.’\n\n[ Tony, who studied Animal Physiology and Endocrinology in the 1960s looked up the latest on Wikipedia and summarised this:]\n\nOxytocin is a hormone, a large molecule, produced by the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus links the nervous system to the hormonal system via the pituitary gland. The roles of Oxytocin include social bonding, reproduction, childbirth and lactation.\n\nEndorphins are hormones produced in the pituitary gland in the brain. They inhibit pain signals or produce euphoria. They can be linked to ‘Exercise high’ especially from aerobic exercise, sex, music, dance, chocolate and laughter amongst other things.\n\nDopamine is a neurotransmitter in our brains and bodies. It facilitates transmission between nerve cells. Dopamine pathways in the brain include ‘reward motivated’ behaviour and motor control ( of the nervous system including control of skeletal muscles) and some hormone release. It has previously been seen as the main chemical of pleasure, but now seems more that Dopamine confers ‘motivational salience’ or a ‘perceived desirability or aversiveness of an outcome’.\n\nSerotonin (also called ‘5-HT‘) is a neurotransmitter tied to a positive mood, some involuntary (gut) muscle control, and other functions including bone metabolism and organ development. Seratonin is mostly (90%) found in the Enteric nervous system, 8% in blood platelets, and only 1 or 2% in the Central Nervous System, yet can facilitate many neural processes.\n\nThis week, our Tango suggestions.\n\n1/ Listen to Argentine Tango music often. Ernesto Franco (b. 1 Feb 1929 ) He was a bandoneonist, bandleader, composer and arranger. His debut at age 18 was with the orchestra of Elvino Vardaro. Next with Omar Madera (pianist) who died in a flying accident in 1951. Then with Roberto Calo. He formed his own quartet in 1953, and played with the orchestras of Alfredo De Angelis and Osvaldo Fresedo. In 1958 he joined the orchestra of Juan D’Arienzo and stayed with him for 17 years. During this time he played in 423 recordings and went to Japan twice, in 1968 and 1970. Ernesto Franco and Osvaldo Tarantino wrote ‘Sacale-chispas’ (Make sparks). It was recorded by the Orchestra of Roberto Calo in 1957 on RCA-Victor.\n\nhttps://www.todotango.com/english/music/song/5873/Sacale-chispas/\n\nErnesto Franco en Sr Tango, ‘La Cumparsita’,\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7opyFTVvrMg\n\nThe link below has a selection of Juan D’Arienzo recordings. I assume that most of the ones recorded after 1958 will include Ernesto Franco in the orchestra. You can also clearly hear how Juan D’Arienzo’s style and music changes over his career.\n\nhttps://www.todotango.com/english/artists/info/13/Juan-DArienzo\n\n2/ Keep fit and able to dance Argentine Tango. We all need to keep fit and keep well. Keeping moderately fit helps us resist challenges including infections. Keeping happy and with a positive outlook is also very good. So by maintaining our interest in tango, in the music, the culture, the songs, and the dancers we keep that Tango flame going inside of us.\n\nThen whatever else we do to keep muscles, limbs, heart and lungs moving, we should still be able to relate our movements to our own internal tango. So keep walking. Keep doing all those exercises you know or have seen on TV.\n\nThere are loads more on the computer if you need more inspiration. Just look, remind yourself , and then do it if it is appropriate for you.\n\n3/ Develop your interest around Argentine Tango, Culture, History and general knowledge.\n\nIt is curious that Argentina has attracted Nazi and Fascist sympathizers as well as being popular with Jewish immigrants. To what extent this is a cause or a result of the contradictions of Argentina and it’s history is hard to say. Your observations are welcome.\n\nAt the end of World War Two the USA gained a lot of leading German scientists. So did the Russians which helped them to be first into space. But other German scientists went to Argentina. This link shows you ‘Nazi Germany’s last jet fighter’ made in Argentina in 1950, the ‘Pulqui 1’. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXo9koa9MbA\n\nIn 1813, in the early years of the Spanish American struggle for independence, the ‘Assembly of the Year XIII’ established a number of points, including: -‘Freedom of wombs’, whereby children born from slaves were automatically free. – All titles of nobility were voided. – The Spanish Inquisition was abolished, resulting in freedom of worship. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_of_the_Year_XIII\n\nMany Jews emigrated to Argentina, especially during the period of major emigration between 1870s and 1920s. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Argentina\n\nOh yes, and then there is the element of US interference in what it considers to be it’s hemisphere. You have probably heard of the ‘Munroe Doctrine’ which began in 1823. In 1964 there is the ‘Mann Doctrine’. Under US president L.B.Johnson, Mann outlined a policy of supporting regime change and promoting the economic interests of US businesses.\n\nSo maybe it is not just Argentina , but the whole world has problems !\n\n***** ***** *****\n\nZOOM TangoE14 Discussion Group meeting was at 4 pm, Sat 16th Jan. If you feel like a friendy discussion and exchange of ideas do join us. It is free.

However Anita thought the choreography was great.\n\nPaul Thompson told us of his 6 months stuck in Buenos Aires due to the Covid lockdown. He was fortunately able to take private classes with Laisa Souza. Here are some links to her dancing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNkMJ2Uvc_s Laisa Souza with Csongor Kiksi, dancing to ‘Yo’. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9U-UrH-Zas Laisa with Roman Konyshev,’Carnaval de mi barrio’. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPAwdk-IatI Laisa with Martin Ojeda, dancing to ‘Patetico’.\n\nPaul said that Laisa’s main point is to lead from the core; not from the arms, not from the shoulders, not from the ribs, but from the core.\n\n***** ***** ***** *****\n\n6th January 2021\n\nHola Tangueros y Amigos,\n\nWell, here we are in 2021, lockdown continues, and it may be a while before enough of us are vaccinated against Covid-19 and its newer variants to get this thing under control. So we need to keep a healthy body, mind and spirit. Many of us that love to dance, and love music, have discovered the extra mysterious and intangible joys of Argentine Tango. We know that expanding our knowledge of Argentine Tango including it’s culture and history, and also by growing our practical and physical abilities, we can absorb a little of its essence. We might never get to the skill set of the top maestros. We might not ever consider ourselves ‘experts’; But we can be ‘Tangueros’. We can be participants, and take great joy in being involved.\n\nEach week by means of this newsletter, TangoE14 offers you a few ideas to follow up on. Hopefully this will help you to keep your interest, and your internal Tango ‘gyroscope’ working.\n\nThis week, our Tango suggestions. 1/ Listen to Argentine Tango music often.\n\nJorge Dragone ( 12 Feb 1927 – 31 May 2020 ).\n\nHe played piano with the orchestras of Jose Garcia and Edgardo Donato, before forming his own orchestra in 1946. He also later played in the orchestras of Edelmiro Rodriguez, Pedro Laurenz, Juan Sanchez Gorio, Florindo Sassone and Jose Libertella. See https://www.todotango.com/english/artists/info/1291/Jorge-Dragone and click on ‘Music’.\n\nYou may well have heard his version of the Milonga ‘Baldosa Floja’ played at milongas, but not known who the orchestra was. All the words of this song are also there. Notice the words:\n\n‘mi vida es una milonga, y se que bailando yo morire’. [ my life is a milonga, and I know that I will die dancing ]\n\nAlso listen to his version of ‘El dia que me quieras’, with female singer Agustina Lentino.\n\n2/ Keep fit and able to dance Argentine Tango. We all need to keep fit and keep well. Keeping moderately fit helps us resist challenges including infections.\n\nKeeping happy and with a positive outlook is also very good.\n\nSo by maintaining our interest in tango, in the music, the culture, the songs, and the dancers we keep that Tango flame going inside of us. Then whatever else we do to keep muscles, limbs, heart and lungs moving, we should still be able to relate our movements to our own internal tango.\n\nSo keep walking. Keep doing all those exercises you know or have seen on TV. There are loads more on the computer if you need more inspiration. Just look, remind yourself , and then do it if it is appropriate for you.\n\n3/ Develop your interest around Argentine Tango, Culture, History and general knowledge.\n\nLook up Jorge Dragone, ( 12 Feb 1927 – 31 May 2020 ). Jorge Dragone was considered by some to be an’ Ambassador’ of Argentine Tango. His travels took him around Latin America, Europe and Japan. He played for many singers including Edmundo Rivero.\n\nhttps://www.todotango.com/english/history/chronicle/238/Dragone-An-eternal-traveler/\n\nEdmundo Rivero, ( 8 June 1911 – 18 January 1986 ).\n\nhttps://www.todotango.com/english/history/chronicle/6/Rivero-Last-interview-with-Rivero/\n\nwhich briefly mentions ‘Lunfardo’ ( Buenos Aires slang ). Also click on this site on his music. Listen to some of his songs, such as ‘La ultima curda’ which he sang with the Orchestra of Anibal Troilo in 1956.\n\n***** ***** *****\n\nSaturday 9thJanuary, ZOOM TangoE14 Discussion Group at 4 pm, free.\n\nIf you have a particular tango related topic of interest that you would like to research, and then tell us about in 2 – 4 minutes, then please do. However this is not an essential requirement to participate. So, if you want to join in, email Tony and he will give you the code details. apblane@gmail.com\n\nYou are invited to share interesting Tango material, videos or music links that you discover.\n\nLast week, 2nd January, Mervyn shared this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMTuko9d5Jw\n\nMurat Erdemsel, a travelling tango teacher, is at ‘Phantastango’ in Germany, and invites three people into a role playing and musicality game.\n\n***** ***** ***** *****\n\n30th December 2020\n\nHola Tangueros y Amigos,\n\nWishing for you all an EXCELLENT 2021. Well, what will 2021 bring ?What can you do to make the most of it ?\n\nIf you have ever considered visiting Argentina, 2021 might possibly be a good year to do it. You need to wait until we, at least UK and Argentina, have the Covid-19 pandemic sufficiently under control, and ideally be vaccinated. But there might be good opportunies later in the year if you are prepared.\n\nThe Argentine economy and currency has fluctuated quite a lot over the last 30 years or more. Sometimes it has been relatively expensive to visit, and other times more affordable. It appears this might be a better time for UK visitors, as long as the UK Pound does not collapse !\n\nYou will need to check many things including costs of flights and accommodation for yourself. If you can enrol yourself in a Spanish language course, and make a serious effort, you should find that rewarding. For English speakers, Spanish (Castellano), is said to be the easiest foreign language to get to grips with.\n\nTop tips: 1) Spanish is a phonetic language, so if you know how to pronounce it correctly, then you know how to spell it and write it. If you know how to read and write it, you should be able to say it. So get good tuition from a well spoken native Latin American Castellano/Spanish speaker. 2) Spanish verbs are declined like Latin verbs. Get yourself a copy of ‘Hugo’s Spanish Verbs Simplified’ and familiarise yourself with the ‘Auxiliary’ verbs, ‘to have’ and ‘to be’; the ‘Regular’ verbs (ending in ‘ar’, ‘er’, and ‘ir’), and some of the ‘Irregular’ verbs. 3) Get a good Spanish-English dictionary, and realise there are more letters in a Spanish alphabet. Even ‘ch’ and ‘ll’ are separate letters, not just ñ. 4) Many words are almost the same, but pronounced differently, Eg: Universidad – University. But most words that might sound the same have quite different meanings: ‘Sopa is not soap, Ropa is not rope, and Mantequilla is not meant to kill you !’\n\nThis week, our Tango suggestions.\n\n1/ Listen to Argentine Tango music often. Lets listen to some of the earliest reasonable quality recordings of the ‘Guardia Vieja’ (the old guard):\n\nJuan Maglio ‘Pacho’ and his group playing ‘Ventanita de arrabal’, (Little window of the outskirts/suburb) recorded in 1927. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0jAJI8z8dc Notice a picture of the group at 0:53. Four musicians; Flute, Violin, Guitar and Bandoneon.\n\nThere are earlier recordings which you may be able to find, but the sound quality is bad.\n\nAnd then listen to a brand new recording which can be considere to be ‘Tango Nuevo’ (New Tango). Here is the latest offering from El Cachivache Orkesta, released on 26th December 2020: ‘Buscandote’ (‘searching for you’), danced by Hugo Mastrolorenzo and Agustina Gomez. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk8-WI_wlxM\n\n2/ Keep fit and able to dance Argentine Tango.\n\nMerits of walking during Covid lockdown:\n\nMaking new acquaintances and chatting to people you may never have had the time for. Seeing things you had not noticed before; like ‘dancing buildings : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YWWim4d2dw\n\n‘The buildings danced’ by artist Anne Bean.\n\nIf you need some more challenging dance exercises, a good place to start is with beginners basic Ballet exercises. What can you find ? Your feedback is asked for here. What do you find useful of not ?\n\n3/ Develop your interest around Argentine Tango, Culture, History and general knowledge.\n\nFamiliarise yourself with well known tango songs in spanish, and also get some idea what they are saying. Some of it is quite melodramatic. Carlos Gardel has a clear voice. Listen to some famous songs sung by him, but also by others. And read the words in both Spanish and English\n\n‘El dia que me quieras’, (The day you love me) 1935. Music by Carlos Gardel; Lyrics by Alfredo Le Pera: Translation by Alberto Paz.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tGsHECwLWY\n\nVersion en castellanoEnglish translation\n\nLa Cumparsita (The little marching band or procession), 1917. Music: G.H.Matos Rodriguez. Lyrics: Enrique P. Maroni – Pascual Contursi; Translated by Alberto Paz.\n\nVersion en castellano\n\nEnglish version\n\nSi supieras que aun dentro de mi alma,\n\nconservo aquel cariño\n\nque tuve para ti…\n\nQuien sabe si supieras\n\nque nunca te he olvidado,\n\nvolviendo a tu pasado\n\nte acordaras de mi…\n\nMis amigos ya no vienen\n\nni siquiera a visitarme,\n\nnadie viene consolarme\n\nen mi afliccion…\n\nDesde el dia que te fuiste\n\nsiento angustias en mi pecho,\n\ndeci, percanta, que has hecho\n\nde mi pobre corazon?\n\nSin embargo, yo siempre te recuerdo\n\ncon el cariño santo\n\nque tuve para ti.\n\nY estas en todas partes,\n\npedazo de mi vida,\n\ny aquellos ojos que fueron mi alegria\n\nlos busco por todas partes\n\ny no los puedo hallar.\n\nAl cotorro abandonado\n\nya ni el sol de la mañana\n\nasoma por la ventana\n\ncomo cuando estabas vos,\n\ny aquel perrito compañero\n\nque por tu ausencia no comia,\n\nal verme solo, el otro dia,\n\ntambien me dejo.\n\nIf you knew, that still deep in my soul\n\nI keep that affection\n\nthat I had for you…\n\nWho knows if you could know\n\nthat I have never forgotten you,\n\ngoing back into your past,\n\nyou will remember me…\n\nMy friends no longer come\n\nnot even to visit me,\n\nnobody wants to console me\n\nin my afliction…\n\nSince the day that you left,\n\nI feel anguish in my chest,\n\nsay, woman, what have you done\n\nwith my poor heart?\n\nHowever, I always remember you\n\nwith the saintly affection\n\nthat I had for you.\n\nAnd you are everywhere,\n\npiece of my life,\n\nand those eyes that were my joy\n\nI look for them everywhere\n\nand I can’t find them.\n\nTo the abandoned pad\n\nnot even the morning sun\n\npeeks through the window\n\nlike when you were here,\n\nand that friendly puppy\n\nwho because of your absence did not eat,\n\nwhen it saw me all alone, the other day\n\nit also left me.\n\nCarlos Gardel died on 24 June 1935 in an aeroplane crash in Medellin, Colombia, along with his lyricist Alfredo Le Pera and several others.\n\nLook up Carlos Gardel on Wikipedia and on Todotango.com.\n\nMysteries of Tango Part 2 – Mito de Gardel ( with English subtitles ) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2NsQkUkcVI\n\nAlso note https://letrasdetango.wordpress.com/ has words in Spanish and English of many Tango songs.\n\n***** ***** *****\n\nSaturday 2nd January, ZOOM TangoE14 Discussion Group at 4 pm.\n\nOn 26th December Shan shared this link: http://www.tangomusicsecrets.co.uk/ In it Mike Lavocah explains how recording studios changed the speed of their recordings slightly. So for example, by speeding a recording up it not only made the music faster , but the singer also sounded higher !\n\nAnd Mervyn discovered these fascinating demonstrations of how different sound frequencies produce particular shapes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GkFP87Rifw https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJAgrUBF4w&t=107s\n\nWhich led John to consider the relationship between choreography and music, and why some moves just don’t fit the music.\n\nYou never realised that thinking about and discussing Argentine Tango could take you into so many different places !\n\nWhy not join us.\n\n***** ***** ***** *****\n\n23rd December 2020\n\nHola Tangueros y Amigos,\n\nTidings of joy from Rita who is now a proud grandmother. Her first grandson Alessandro was born on 8th October.\n\nCHRISTMAS GREETINGS and BEST WISHES\n\nfrom Pablo Nievas www.pablonievas.com\n\nfrom Los Ocampo www.losocampotango.net\n\nfrom all our visiting teachers,\n\nfrom all our participants,\n\nand from Tony and Anita of TangoE14.\n\nThis week, your Tango suggestions.\n\n1/ Listen to Argentine Tango music often. Listen to Astor Piazzolla.\n\nThere are plenty of sources, so we leave it to you to see what you can find. Piazzollas first Orchestra (1946) has plenty of traditional tangos. His music evolves, but the sources of his innovation come from many places including many important and inspirational tango musicians as well as his classical training.\n\nFurther down we encourage you to look up details of his life on Wikipedia or Todotango.com\n\nLast week we started to listen to some tango songs as well. This is probably Carlos Gardel’s most famous and romantic song; ‘El dia que me quieras’.\n\nThis clip is from the film of the same name https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grAmjjcnWTk\n\n2/ Keep fit and able to dance Argentine Tango.\n\nQuite possibly one might be tempted or obliged to eat rather well over these Christmas and Shortest Day festivals. So enjoy what is on offer, but try not to over do it.\n\nThen the simplest exercise, and one of the best, is to go for good long walks; ideally a couple of hours. Wrap up warmly as Christmas Day is expected to be cold. When out walking take the opportunity to smile at others, to wish them a Merry Christmas, and to have a conversation. As long as you are outdoors in the open air, and as long as you keep a reasonable distance apart; at least two metres; then the risk of infection is very low. I personally enjoy random conversations. I find it lifts my spirits, and being in good spirits helps keep me fit and healthy.\n\n3/ Develop your interest around Argentine Tango, Culture, History and general knowledge.\n\nGo to Wikipedia and look up Astor Piazzolla ( 11 March 1921- 4 July 1992 )\n\nVery briefly: He was born in Mar del Plata, Argentina 1921, the only child of Italian immigrant parents. They all went to New York in 1925. At home he could listen to Tango including Carlos Gardel and Julio de Caro, Jazz and Classical music including Bach. His father bought him a bandoneon from a pawn shop. He took classical music lessons. In 1934 he met Carlos Gardel, and played a paper boy in Gardel’s movie, ‘ El dia que me quieras’ (The day that you fall in love with me). In 1936 he moved back to Mar del Plata with his family and started to play with, meet and be influenced by many very talented and recognisable tango musicians. These included Elvino Vardaro, Anibal Troilo, Francisco Fiorentino. Piazzolla formed his first Orquesta Tipica in 1946. At the same time he was developing his classical music skills. After he disbanded his first orchestra in 1950 he nearly abandoned tango to concentrate on more classical music. He won a grant to study in Paris with Nadia Boulanger, but she encouraged him to pursue his career in tango. With her he studied classical composition including ‘counterpoint’.\n\nLook up Counterpoint and Fugue in music and you will start to understand how a simple musical phrase can be played with.\n\nPiazzolla formed his ‘Octeto Buenos Aires’ in 1955, which is said to be a major development in the history of tango, and the start of Piazzolla’s ‘Tango Nuevo’. Juan Carlos Copes and Maria Nieves performed in Puerto Rico in 1959 with Astor Piazzolla as their musical director. They then toured New York, Chicago and Washington, and appeared on US tv’s ‘Arthur Murray Show’.\n\nAfter Piazzolla learned of the death of his father in 1959 he wrote his very famous tango ‘Adios Nonino’ as a homage to him. That same year, back in BsAs, he set up his first Quinteto. In 1963 he formed his ‘Nuevo Octeto’. He collaborated with many artists incuding the writer Jorge Luis Borges, and singer Edmundo Rivero. He worked with Horacio Ferrer to compose the operetta ‘Maria de Buenos Aires’, which premiered in 1968. In 1975 he set up his ‘Electronic Octet’.\n\nFrom 1976 to 1983, a period of Argentine Military Dictatorship, he lived in Italy, but returned to Argentina several times to record. He had lunch with the dictator Jorge Rafael Videla, and although criticised for this Piazzolla said he was ‘obliged’ to attend , along with many other notables. In July 1984 he appeared with his Quinteto at the Montreal International Jazz Festival.\n\n( Do go to the whole Wikipedia entry, it is worth reading. Especially the note on his Musical Style. )\n\n‘Piazzolla’s Nuevo Tango’ is distinct from traditional tango in its use of jazz elements, extended harmonies, and dissonance, counterpoint, and extended compositional forms. Piazzolla fuses tango with a wide range of other Western musical elements so successfully that it transcends these influences.\n\n” The use of the passacaglia technique of a circulating bass line and harmonic sequence, invented and much used in 17th and 18th century baroque music but also central to the idea of jazz “changes”, predominates in most of Piazzolla’s mature compositions.”\n\nOn 4th August 1990 he suffered a cerebral haemorrhage. He remained in a coma for two years until he died on 4 July 1992.\n\n***** *****\n\nThis Saturday, 26th December, our ZOOM TangoE14 Discussion Group meeting will be at 4 pm.\n\nIf you feel like a friendy discussion and exchange of ideas do join us.

For that to occur there\n\nhas to be real connection and communication between the two.\n\nMichael has taken the trouble to give us his thoughts on the subject:\n\n” I was thinking about the question of tango dancing being a ‘conversation’ and\n\nhad already begun to think that the conversation is not two-way but three-way…..\n\nwith the music. Then last night I was reading an essay about Anthony Powell’s\n\nDance to the Music of Time – which I love. It starts from a famous painting in the\n\nWallace Collection of four people of different ages dancing in a circle while Old Father\n\nTime and a child sit in the corner and play the music. The author said:\n\nA dance, such as is performed by the four seasons in Poussin’s picture, to the melody\n\nsupplied by the old gentleman in one corner and the infant in the other, depends on\n\nthe maintenance of its harmony and the subordination of the participants’ inner\n\nfeelings and reflections to their role in the dance. If the narrator can be considered at\n\nonce the infant and the greybeard [who play the music] he is calling the tune in the\n\nliteral sense, but at the same time he is in thrall to the flux and continuity of movement\n\nthat he is creating. He cannot, so to speak, stop playing and give us an improvisation\n\nof his own, while the dancers stand about. The dance may be spontaneous but it is\n\nalso collective and interdependent; no individual taking part can halt or step outside it.\n\n” In fact this seems to me truer and safer when we dance to recorded music,\n\nbecause it is always the same every time we play it whereas live musicians play every\n\nnumber slightly differently – a little here – a little there – and we must dance the same\n\nnumber to a slightly different rhythm each time. If they slow down or speed up or\n\nsyncopate even a little so must we. As evidence of when this does NOT work we have\n\nall danced to live bands who were used to playing to audiences who were listening in\n\ntheir seats and therefore suddenly jazzed it up undanceably or simply went off for six\n\nminutes enjoying themselves regardless of our exhaustion.\n\n” Then – in conformity with my lifetime practice of contradicting myself –\n\nI realised that tango is actually a dance where you can ignore the music for a while.\n\nWe stop and repeat something that didn’t work or we stop and do ornaments or lead\n\nthe lady to do a slow rondee or sink down with our leg or her leg beautifully extended\n\nwhile the musicians play on.Then we slip ourselves back into their beat when we want\n\n” It reminded me a little of the old days driving a car when you could turn the\n\nengine off and keep rolling…… it was fun to see how far we got compared to last time..\n\n.. trying to save petrol. I think perhaps tango is like that where we sometimes disengage\n\nfrom the music and go on a roll of our own until we feel like engaging again. The same\n\nthing happens in West Coast Swing where either or both partners stand ready to go with\n\nthe appropriate beat but improvise blues moves for as long as the leader wants to do it\n\nhimself or permits his follower to do it. But the followers have free choice over their\n\nmoves and improvise as they will. The leader’s only control is how long he permits it.\n\nIn quickstep it happens with a ‘pepperpot’ and in waltz you can do it in an oversway,\n\nbut in tango we do it a lot. “\n\nWell, there are some interesting views and ideas there, not all relevant.\n\nI can accept that the ‘conversation’ could possibly be three way, but often the\n\nmusicians are not necessarily watching the dancers. Also, Tango orchestras almost\n\nalways play an arranged score. The individual musicians have little opportunity to\n\nimprovise in the same way that Jazz musicians do. So for most purposes the\n\n‘dialogue’ is between the couple in the context of the music.\n\nNo two times dancing to the same piece need ever be the same, and particularly\n\nin social dancing the specific environment/surrounding dancers is constantly\n\nchanging.\n\nThe ‘culture’ of Social Argentine Tango really encourages and allows you to\n\nimprovise to a level not normally seen in other dances, so much so that the level\n\nof attention given to each other does enable a ‘dialogue’ to take place.\n\nWe will be very pleased to have more feedback, observations and thoughts\n\nfrom other readers.\n\nIn the meantime keep up your interest in Argentine Tango music by\n\nat least listening to it regularly. When you listen, or watch videos of tango dancing,\n\npay full attention to what is happening with the music, the instruments, and the\n\ndancers so that you catch the various flavours and nuances – like being a wine\n\ntaster.\n\nThis week, our Tango suggestions.\n\n1/ Listen to Argentine Tango music often\n\n‘Cachivache Orkesta’ are sometimes described as Tango Punk, or another variant of Tango Nuevo.\n\nThat they are excellent tango musicians is not in doubt. You can easily find videos of them playing,and many well known dancers dancing to them – just search for ‘Cachivache Orkesta’. Saturday 12th December online concert.\n\n[ ‘Cachivache’ can mean junk, but in popular Latin American slang ‘Cachivaches’ means one’s personal bits and pieces, including junk jewellry. ]\n\n2/ Keep fit and able to dance Argentine Tango.\n\nRhythm, breathing, and walking.\n\nWhen you are out walking try experimenting with the relationship and awareness between walking and breathing. If any of these exercises makes you faint or dizzy then stop doing them.\n\nRegular, full stride walking. Try and keep the same speed for all of this first set:\n\n– L breathe in and out on each step, R in and out, L in and out, R in and out. Repeat. ie like panting or breathing quickly\n\n– L breathe out, R breathe in, L breathe out, R breathe in. Repeat. ie one step per breath in or out.\n\n– L breathe out, R continue breathing out (or hold), L breathe in, R continue breathing in (or hold). Repeat. ie two steps per breath in or out.\n\n– Can you do 3 steps per breath in or out ?\n\n– Can you do 4 steps per breath in or out ?\n\nNow try combinations that are easily manageable for you; combining eg\n\n-one step breathe in, one step hold breath, one step breathe out, one step hold breath, etc\n\n– one step breathe in, 2 steps hold breath, one step breathe out, 2 steps hold breath.\n\nExperiment with what you can comfortably manage, eg\n\n2 steps breathing in; 3 or 4 or 5 steps holding breath; 1 or 2 steps breathing out; 2, 3, 4\n\nor 5 steps holding breath.\n\nHow much of this can you manage while walking up a hill or stairs.\n\nWhat effect does it have if you try this taking shorter and quicker steps?\n\nAre you becoming aware of your heartbeat ?\n\nCan you feel what speeds are comfortable and practical for you, and fit in the context of your favourite regular tangos?\n\nDoes any of this apply to Tango Vals ?\n\n***** ***** *****\n\n3/ Develop your interest around Argentine Tango, Culture, History and general knowledge.\n\nMervyn found this interesting link, which is part of an interesting 9 part series:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKVg3ZB42-o&feature=youtu.be\n\nMysteries of Tango Part 5 – Los secretos del baile (The secrets of the dance).\n\nTwo of the the tangueros interviewed are Juan Carlos Copes b.31 May 1931,\n\nand Maria Nieves b.6 Sept 1934.\n\nThese are two of the most famous Tango ‘Missionaries’ that brought Argentine Tango back to world attention with the show ‘Tango Argentino’ in 1983.

It requires no acrobatics, you simply have to devote yourself to your heartbeat.”\n\nTheir story is told in the 2015 film ‘Un Tango Mas’ (Our last tango) which is available to watch online.\n\nFor other details see wikipedia or:\n\nhttps://www.todotango.com/english/artists/biography/656/Juan-Carlos-Copes/\n\nhttps://www.todotango.com/english/artists/biography/798/Maria-Nieves/\n\nJuan Carlos Copes was inspired by Gene Kelly’s ‘Singing in the rain’ (1952)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swloMVFALXw\n\nTwo other famous ‘Tango Missionaries’ are Monica Romero and Omar Ocampo, Los Ocampo, who have taught many times at ‘TangoE14’.

John Herbert told me that Doreen passed away in July from Pancreatic cancer following a short illness. We will miss Doreen, and offer our sympathy and love to John.\n\nSome other Tango activities are tentatively occuring , under careful conditions; such as Rachel Greenberg’s ‘La Divina’, and ‘Tanguito’. We at ‘TangoE14’ are unable to do anything in our usual hall until January. However, as we have indicated before, we could possibly do some free and impromptu dancing outdoors if those interested contact Tony by email, so we can make a safe and sensible plan. In the meantime keep up your interest in Argentine Tango music by at least listening to it regularly. When you listen, or watch videos of tango dancing, pay full attention to what is happening with the music, the instruments, and the dancers so that you catch the various flavours and nuances – like being a wine taster.\n\nThis week, your Tango suggestions.\n\n1/ Listen to Argentine Tango music often\n\nMariano Laplume, in his interesting zoom talk on Alfredo Gobbi last week, made a clear distinction between what he described as the ‘Traditional’ tango orchestras and the more ‘Evolutionist’ orchestras. For example, Juan D’Arienzo and Francisco Canaro played with milongeros in mind, who would dance at popular dances (milongas). Their music had a regular beat, a regular rhythm. Incidentally, both D’Arienzo and Canaro put aside their instruments to conduct their orchestras from ‘outside’. Although the ‘Evolutionist’ orchestras typically started off by playing for milongueros, they soon found themselves exploring the possibilities and complexities that Tango offered and allowed. Often the leaders of these more evolutionist orchestras, notably Alfredo Gobbi and Osvaldo Pugliese, conducted their orchestras from ‘within’ the orchestra as they were playing their own instruments at the same time. It is said that these musicians were more ‘in to’ the music, more savouring the music, than the ‘Traditional’ orchestras. So now, choose some pieces to listen to by Juan D’Arienzo and Francisco Canaro. Then see if you can find the same titles played by Alfredo Gobbi, Osvaldo Pugliese, or the Francini-Pontier orchestra. As you listen to them, try dancing on your own to them; or at least try to imagine how you might dance to them. What could you do ? Which do you prefer ? Look up these musicians and their orchestras on https://www.todotango.com/english/artists\n\n2/ Keep fit and able to dance Argentine Tango.\n\nSome more simple exercises to do while standing on one leg:\n\nTry doing this without holding on to anything if you can , but it is still sensible to stand next to a bench or something completely firm to hold on to if necessary. Stand up straight, and have all your weight on one foot. If you can do this without holding on to anything , then also try holding your arms in the approximate position they would be in with a partner. With the knee relaxed, lift the free leg until the thigh is horizontal, and the lower leg is hanging vertically. Now, keeping the thigh completely still, rotate the whole of the free lower leg – First clockwise 8 times, then anticlockwise 8 times. If you can control and point your foot a little bit while you are doing this, that is even better.\n\nSimilar to what you just did, keep the thigh completely still, but also the lower leg (Tibia-Fibula bones) completely still, and this time just rotate your whole foot from the ankle; clockwise 8 times, then anticlockwise 8 times.\n\nNow lower your thigh ( Femur bone ) so that it is suspended at a 45 degree angle; ie half way between horizontal and vertical. Keep your Thigh ( Femur ) completely still, and do the same exercises as above with your lower leg: ie rotate the whole lower leg clockwise, then anticlockwise; then just rotate the foot.\n\n***** ***** *****\n\n3/ Develop your interest around Argentine Tango, Culture, History and general knowledge.\n\nThere has been a lot of news and reporting lately about the life of Diego Maradona, 30/10/60-25/11/20, the famous Argentine footballer. His parents were of Guarani (Paraguayan Indian) and Italian heritage, and he grew up in a poor suburb of Buenos Aires. So it is easy to imagine that some of the ingredients that made him one of the very best football players ever, are the same ingedients that went into the development of the early, and then later the top Argentine Tango dancers.\n\nMaradona is said to have had exceptional spatial and environmental awareness, as well as very good physical skills. He could understand clearly the overall situation he and his team were in, so that he was able to find instant, novel and unrehearsed solutions. But underlying that was, at least in the beginning, a solid foundation of both fitness, skills and technique training and practice, and absolute determination.\n\nI also wonder about the native South American Indian, including Guarani, approach to life, culture, problem solving, and ways of seeing and understanding things. Gauchos were and are excellent stockmen at least in part because they empathise with and understand the animals they deal with; as if the Gaucho and the animal are kindred beings. When I worked in the Peruvian Andes in the 1980s I noticed at markets the cloths layed out with hundreds of traditional medicines for all manner of ailments. Plants, rocks, seeds, fruits and so on. ‘If you have serious problems you need to buy abou 1-2 kilos of a particular cactus. You take it to a ‘Curandero’ (Medicine-man). He makes a special preparation of it. Then he, the Medicine-man, drinks it, and when he is ‘stoned’ he tells you what is wrong with you.\n\nAll I am saying is that there are many ways of approaching a problem, or a desire, such as a desire to dance. Sometimes it may help to stop looking at the vertical cliff in front of you, of the mountain you wish to climb. Just walk round to the other side and there may well be an easier route to the summit.\n\n***** ***** *****\n\nIn our Saturday ZOOM TangoE14 Discussion Group meeting of 28th November:\n\nMervyn found : ‘There is no ‘I’ in Tango.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-pCNlkO7E4\n\nHedy’s links; ‘Milonga para as Missoes’, danced by Maria Filali and Gianpiero Galdi: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPquZDq2wzQ\n\nand ‘Improvisation of slow milonguero style’, danced by Sara de Italia and Carlos Neuman. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_JkjZNfabo&feature=youtu.be\n\nTony commented that in dancing very quick and short foot steps such as displayed in this Milonga, it can be helpful to think not so much about ‘stepping’, but imagining your body exists in it’s space, and your legs are ‘hanging’ (suspended) underneath your body; so you are simply drumming the floor in a relaxed manned with your feet. This only works for quick and very short steps that are directly under your body.\n\nHola Tangueros y Amigos, Hi Everyone,\n\n‘La lucha continua’ – The struggle continues.\n\nWe continue with our interests and activities as best we can. Keep moderately fit, walk, and do a variety of simple exercises for a few minutes several times a day. Keep your body moving. Keep listening to tango music, and when you are watching a video of others dancing tango try and imagine yourself doing that. But on top of that it is worth reflecting about what Argentine Tango is and what it means. To me there is another level, separate from just being a competent dancer, and being physically able to dance – it is an ability to connect with and to communicate with your partner. It is the ability to ‘listen’ to your partner with all your senses.\n\nThis week, your Tango suggestions.\n\n1/ Listen to Argentine Tango music often\n\nEdgardo Donato, b 14 April 1897 BsAs – d. 15 Feb 1963. Played violin with the orchestras of Jose Quevedo, Eduardo Arolas and Adolfo Carabelli, before forming his own orchestra in 1927. He recorded with Brunswick, Victor and Pampa. https://www.todotango.com/english/artists/info/101/Edgardo-Donato\n\nVictor Buchino, b 14 Sept 1920 in San Miguel de Tucuman – Played piano and formed an orchestra for the singer Edmundo Rivera. He recorded with Victor and TK. He also played with other singers ; Ranko Fugisawa, Libertad Lamarque, Juan Carlos Lamas and Susy Leiva. https://www.todotango.com/english/artists/info/887/Victor-Buchino\n\nYou can look up the singers or other artists on https://www.todotango.com/english/artists\n\n2/ Keep fit and able to dance Argentine Tango.\n\nToday a couple of simple ideas to practice : Walking up stairs with co-ordinated breathing, and balancing on one leg. You will need a) Stairs, preferibly a long flight; and b) Two legs.\n\na) Stairs. When walking up stairs , try walking up two at a time. It is a bit more work, takes very slightly longer, and makes you want to take bigger and longer breaths. As you take the first step up ( whether one or two steps of the stairs ) breathe out. Then on the next step ( or two stairs ), breathe in. Keep going up the stairs, ( preferibly 2 at a time if you can manage it ), keeping this constant rhythm/co-ordination of step and breath.\n\nIf you only have a short flight of stairs, after 4 stairs,or any multiple of 4, you will have to come down and start again. Do not run down the stairs or jump down. That would ‘jar’ your joints.\n\nGoing up stairs can be gentle ‘compression’ of joints, but too much running down stairs or steep hills can be damaging. Keep doing this exercise until you start to feel a bit breathless.\n\nThen try complete breathing out and in on every step. This is a useful aerobic exercise, but also helps you to see that you can have polyrhythms in your body of various step and breathing patterns.\n\nb) Balancing on one leg. Can you balance on one leg while you put on or take off your shoes and socks/stockings ? Do this next to something solid and safe that you can touch or hold on to if you start to lose your balance. Be careful !\n\n***** ***** *****\n\nMina and Giraldo – Corrientes – have online classes, https://corrientessocialclub.co.uk Email < contact@corrientessocialclub.co.uk >\n\nRaquel Greenberg Tango has online classes; https://www.raquel-tango.com Email < info@raquel-tango.com >\n\nLos Ocampo, Omar Ocampo and Monica Romero, are doing lessons on ZOOM.
