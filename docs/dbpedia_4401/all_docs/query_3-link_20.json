        "text": "Why reading is important for babies and young children\n\nReading books, sharing stories, talking and singing every day helps your child’s development in many ways.\n\nReading and storytelling can:\n\nhelp your child get to know sounds, words and language, and develop early literacy skills\n\nintroduce your child to the value of books and stories\n\nspark your child’s imagination and curiosity\n\npromote your child’s brain development and ability to focus and concentrate\n\nhelp your child build social, communication and emotional skills\n\nhelp your child learn about the world, their own culture and other cultures.\n\nReading stories with children has benefits for you too. The special time you spend reading together promotes bonding and builds your relationship with your child.\n\nYou can start reading aloud to your baby as early as you like – the earlier the better. Your baby will love being held in your arms, listening to your voice, hearing rhyme and rhythm, and looking at pictures.\n\nMore than reading: storytelling and songs\n\nReading isn’t the only way to help with your child’s language and literacy development.\n\nTelling stories, singing songs and saying rhymes together are also great activities for early literacy skills – and your child will probably have a lot of fun at the same time. Sometimes your child might enjoy these activities more than reading.\n\nYou and your child might like to make up your own stories or share family stories. Your child will learn words and develop language skills from the songs, stories and conversations you share together.\n\nYou can use books to share stories, but you don’t always have to read. Just by looking at pictures and talking about them with your child, you can be a storyteller and a model for using language and books. Your child will also learn by watching you hold a book the right way and seeing how you move through the book by gently turning the pages.\n\nReading with children in diverse languages\n\nYou can read, sing and tell stories with your child in whatever language you feel most comfortable speaking.\n\nUsing a language you’re comfortable with helps you to communicate more easily. It also helps to make reading, singing and storytelling more fun for you and your child. Your child will still learn that words are made up of different letters, syllables and sounds, and that words usually link to the pictures on the page.\n\nIf you speak languages other than English at home but want to introduce your child to reading in English, you can look for dual-language books. Or you could read a book aloud in English or listen to an audio book in English and then talk about the story with your child in whatever language feels most comfortable.\n\nWhen to read, sing and tell stories with children\n\nBedtime, bath time, potty time, on the train, on the bus, in the car, in the park, in the pram, in the cot, when you’re in the GP’s waiting room ... any time is a good time for a story! You can make books part of your daily routine – take them with you to share and enjoy everywhere.\n\nKnowing when to stop can be just as important as finding the time to share a story in the first place. Pay attention to your child’s reaction to the story, and stop if your child isn’t enjoying it. You can always try a different book, song or story another time.\n\nIf you don’t have a book or can’t make up a story on the spot, don’t worry. There are many other ways you and your child can share letters, words and pictures. For example, you can look at:\n\npackages at home or in the supermarket, especially food packaging\n\nclothing – what does it say on the t-shirt? What colour is it?\n\nletters and notes – what do they say? Who sent them?\n\nsigns or posters in shops or on buses and trains – point out signs that have the same letters as your child’s name\n\nmenus – it can be fun for older children to look at menus and work out what they want to eat.\n\nYou could check out our storytelling videos. Let storyteller Anne E. Stewart introduce you and your child to ‘Mook Mook the owl’, ‘The crocodile’ and ‘The old lady and the mosquito’.\n\nTips for sharing books with children\n\nMake a routine, and try to share at least one book every day. A special space where you and your child go to read – with a box of books and something comfortable to sit on – can help with establishing your routine.\n\nTurn off the TV or radio, put your phone on silent, and find a quiet place to read so your child can hear your voice.\n\nHold your child close or on your knee while you read, so your child can see your face and the book.\n\nUse gestures, facial expressions, funny voices, noises and so on. This can get your child interested and help them learn the meaning of words. It’s also fun!\n\nEncourage your child to talk about the pictures and repeat familiar words and phrases.\n\nMake connections between your child’s life and the book. For example, ‘That little boy is playing in the sand. You did this too, didn’t you?’\n\nLet your child choose the books when they’re old enough to start asking – and be prepared to read favourite books over and over again!\n\nIf you have older children, they can share books with your younger children, or you can all read together. Taking turns, asking questions and listening to the answers are all important skills that will help children when they start learning how to read.\n\nJust reading for a few minutes at a time is good – you don’t always have to finish the book. As children grow, they can usually listen for longer.\n\nBooks to read with children\n\nAs a broad rule, young children often enjoy books, songs and stories that have good rhyme, rhythm and repetition. In fact, one of the ways that children learn is through repetition and rhyme.\n\nChildren also like books they can relate to – for example, books about play, toys, dinner, bath time, walks, animals and cars.\n\nIt’s also important to choose books that are the right length for your child.\n\nFor a guide to what might suit your child, you can look at the following articles:\n\nReading with babies from birth\n\nReading with toddlers: 12-18 months\n\nReading with toddlers: 18 months-3 years\n\nReading with preschoolers.\n\nYou can also vary the books and printed materials you read. Picture books, ebooks, magazines, instruction manuals, TV guides and letters can all be interesting and engaging for your child.\n\nIf your older child is interested in ebooks, look for ones without distracting games or animations. Also, it’s important to read ebooks with your child, rather than leaving your child alone with a device. It’s best if ebooks don’t replace paper books.\n\nIf you want to try new books or magazines without much cost, you could arrange book swaps with friends or other parents at your parent group or early childhood centre.\n\nUsing your local library\n\nLibraries have a lot to offer. Getting to know your local library can be a part of learning about and loving books.\n\nYou can borrow great children’s books for free from your local library. This means you can have plenty of books in your home for your child to explore – and it won’t cost you a cent.\n\nTaking your child to the library and letting them choose their own books can be a fun adventure. You can talk about and plan your trip to the library with your child. You could ask your child, for example:\n\nHow many books will you choose?\n\nHow many books can you find by your favourite author?\n\nWill you borrow books that have animals in them?\n\nDo you have a favourite book you’d like to borrow again?\n\nHow many days will it be before we go to the library again?\n\nMany libraries also offer free story times and activities for young children. Going along to these sessions is a way to help your child get familiar with the library, have fun, and enjoy books and stories. Some libraries offer these sessions online.\n\nLibraries often have audio books, dual-language books, ebooks and magazines.\n\nJust contact your local library for more information."
