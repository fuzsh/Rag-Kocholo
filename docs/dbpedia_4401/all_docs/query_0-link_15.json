        "text": "As a nineties kid, there was no greater daily joy than racing home from school, finishing my homework, and watching some of my favorite shows. Different shows depicted different levels of violence. Some of my favorite cartoons were wholesome, like “Doug” or “Rugrats” while other shows were a bit edgier like “Salute your shorts” or “Ren and Stimpy”. To be perfectly honest, there were a lot of shows I simply wasn’t allowed to watch. Even the most prosocial shows about fighting evil and being a positive role model included violence (ex. “Mighty Morphin Power Rangers”).\n\nThirty years later, things have not changed and are perhaps a bit worse despite mounting evidence that violent tv media can increase aggressive behavior (Gruman et al., 2016). I began to wonder if networks responsible for children’s programming had taken any cues from psychological research. Based on my experience watching children’s shows with my kids, my hypothesis – programming had actually become worse.\n\nTo test this, I decided to research the level of aggression in a typical modern-day children’s show compared to a 90s show. I first watched a 20-minute episode of a show called “Gravity Falls” and noted the number of times the characters engaged in aggressive behavior and the types of violence present. This show exhibited 26 acts of violence mostly by children which included smacking, shoving, breaking objects, punching, dismembering, kicking, beheading, burning, strangulation, use of a severed head as a weapon, and murder. Many extreme acts of violence occurred against evil wax statues resulting in their deaths (Hirsch et al., 2012).\n\nI used an episode of “Mighty Morphin’ Power Rangers” for comparison. I chose this show specifically because I expected a great deal of violence. This 20-minute episode included 25 acts of violence, most of which occurred while battling “putties” while using martial arts. Acts of violence included punching, kicking, charging, throwing, fire-blasting, and sword fighting but surprisingly no deaths (Power Rangers Official, 2021). Yet, there were many prosocial themes throughout this episode such as helping others, standing up for positive ideals, never using violence for personal gain, and supporting friendships. Prosocial themes are positive behaviors demonstrated to increase positive behaviors (Gruman et al., 2016).\n\nDespite the similar number of violent acts, the quality of those acts was different. The violence may have differed because the modern-day show was a cartoon while the 90s show was live-action, which somewhat limits the ability to intensify violence. But overall, the modern-day show was exceedingly more gruesome than the 90s show and included few prosocial themes. These findings led me to wonder whether society as a whole is becoming desensitized to violence.\n\nViewing violent media can increase aggression, decrease empathy for others, and elicit fear in children (American Psychological Association, 2013). Our children have become desensitized to violence on television, meaning the more they are exposed to violence, the less it affects them (Gruman et al., 2016). In addition to media desensitization, seemingly endless accounts of real-life violence are also desensitizing society (Pittaro, 2019). So much so that school shootings only headline in the news for a few days (TED, 2020). Clearly, we cannot merely blame television for desensitization but must broaden our perspective to instead observe the whole of society and the real-life violence influencing ourselves and our children.\n\nWhile the jury is still out about which decade of children’s shows is more violent, one thing is clear – tv networks still haven’t taken the psychological research concerning violent children’s shows seriously. Even though psychological research supports non-violent tv programming for children, networks continue to produce violent media. In a world already fraught with terror and sadness, children’s shows should provide an escape for kids and help them to develop prosocial behaviors rather than serve to normalize violence.\n\nReferences\n\nAmerican Psychological Association.
