[1976-04-17], A Bloody Shame [alternate title: Eyewitness L.A.]\n\nSummary: \"'A Bloody Shame' is an investigative report on the high risk of contracting hepatitis because commercial blood from paid 'skid-row' donors is used for transfusions at hospitals throughout Los Angeles. We examine the extent of the problem, why this blood is more dangerous, why it is used, and what can be done to eliminate it from our city's blood supply. The program examines the problem by visiting both volunteer and commercial blood centers and the blood banks of major local hospitals. We talk with both kinds of donors and interview the leading experts in the field. Everything that this program exposes presents a forceful call for more of us to become volunteer blood donors and help prevent tragic deaths which should not be occurring.\n\n\"'A Bloody Shame' was a program in the 'Eyewitness Los Angeles' series--a vibrant, public-affairs, documentary series which each Saturday at 7:00PM airs a magazine-format program composed of stimulating topics of concern and interest to all the people of greater Los Angeles. The series is multifaceted in subject, approach, and technique. It attempts to expose problems; offer solutions; inform the audience about their city's varied apects--good, bad, and unique; and educate viewers to the resources available to them. All this is done using a style that is creative, visual, fast-paced, and entertaining: we are attempting to fascinate as well as inform, involve as well as explain, motivate as well as educate. The series is produced and written by Matthew Shapiro and Adrian H. Joseph.\"--1976 Peabody Awards entry form.\n\nCorporate Producers: KABC-TV (Television station : Hollywood, Los Angeles, Calif.)"
