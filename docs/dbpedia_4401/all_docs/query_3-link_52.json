        "text": "The benefits of technology and media are numerous for children as they make learning fun and an engaging experience for them. However, to maintain a healthy balance, it is crucial for parents to think about both the good and bad effects of television on children.\n\nA Pew Research Center study interviewed parents to evaluate children’s engagement with specific digital devices. The study shared that 88% of parents with a child under 12 acknowledged that their child engages with television regularly. Additionally, 74% of parents with a child aged two or younger stated that their child uses or interacts with a television somehow.\n\nWhile television sets are an inseparable part of our lives, parents may want to know how much TV time children should be allowed and what kind of TV shows are appropriate for their children’s age group.\n\nRead this post to learn more about the positive and negative effects of television on children and the role of parents in helping children get the best out of their TV time.\n\nPositive Effects Of Television On Kids\n\nThe television is not bad. When exposed to the right shows or programs, your child can learn useful things. Research indicates that watching TV can have a positive impact on children. It can help them change their behavior and attitude for good (1). Here are some more ways in which TV can have a positive influence on kids.\n\n1. Educational content\n\nA few television channels are dedicated to creating educational programming and informative content for the audience, especially children. Sesame Street, for example, is one such program that is aimed at preschoolers.\n\nThere are a few channels that broadcast only educational content covering subjects like art and craft, science, history, geography, and math. TV is also a great medium that exposes children to different languages around the world.\n\nAllowing your children to watch news channels, with a little guidance, will help them stay updated with the current affairs and names of significant people in the world.\n\n2. Entertainment\n\nThe sounds and colorful images on the screen appeal to children and also retain their attention. From movies to cartoon shows, there are several programs to keep children engaged.\n\nHowever, make sure that the content is appropriate for your kids based on their age and level of understanding.\n\n3. Sports\n\nEncourage your kids to watch different sports like tennis, soccer, baseball, and basketball, by co-viewing with them. Tell them about the gameplay, rules and other interesting facts about the sport. If they show interest in any, encourage them to play the game or sport.\n\n4. Exposure to different cultures\n\nThe TV can help your child to learn about different countries and teach them about various cultures in the world. With the right choice of programs, your child might learn about various people around the world, their traditions, lifestyles, and cultures.\n\n5. Television might inspire\n\nTV shows aimed at young children and adolescents are not only educational but also inspiring. Educational TV programs encourage children to try new things. For example, a TV show about creative fun can inspire a child to try something new with clay, paints, or paper. Likewise, a documentary about famous scientists, artists, and other public figures can also inspire them to do good deeds or achieve something big in life.\n\n6. 3D TV and programs\n\n3D technology has changed the way we experience television. 3D television programs and movies offer an enhanced experience for kids. Although the popularity of 3D TV has been on the decline in the recent past, there are still a few networks offering educational programs in 3D.\n\nThe American OptometriciA specialized healthcare profession which involves examination of the eyes and related structures Association has confirmed that 3D can be viewed by most children (2). If your child has trouble, consult a medical professional.\n\nYour kids can reap all these benefits from watching TV or the internet only when you guide them to watch the right shows for a limited time.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends limiting screen time and the types of media that children aged six and older watch. For children between the ages of two and five years, screen time should be limited to one hour per day and must only include high-quality programs (3).\n\nDigital media influence can quietly take over your children’s lives if you are not cautious. The “just one more hour” could extend if not corrected at the nascent stageiEarly stage of development or recently coming into existence .\n\n[ Read: Teen Social Media Addiction ]\n\nNegative Effects Of Television On Children\n\nTV affects children negatively as well. Unfortunately, the adverse effects seem to outnumber the positive ones when you do not pay attention to them.\n\nHere are a few ways in which TV can be a bad influence on your children.\n\n7. Curbs physical activity\n\nScreen addiction reduces the amount of physical activity in children. Sometimes, they refuse to do anything else but watch TV all day.\n\nLack of proper physical activity and too much screen time can lead to vision problems.\n\nResearch has also indicated that there is a direct connection between TV time and obesity in kids (4). The American Academy of Pediatrics identifies TV viewing for more than 1.5 hours as an identified risk factor for obesity in kids aged four to nine. The risk of being overweight increases fivefold if teens watch TV for more than five hours daily compared to those who watch for 0 to two hours. Children tend to watch more TV if it is placed in their bedrooms, and the problem is intensified by food advertising and snacking while watching TV (5). A sedentary lifestyle and obesity may also increase cardiovascular health risks in the future (6).\n\n8. Impacts social development\n\nKids who watch a lot of TV do not have time to play or develop social skills.\n\nLess or no interaction with peers can affect their social development. TV eats away the time they get to interact with other children in their social circle, which may affect their knowledge and understanding of social interactions and behavior.\n\n9. Affects brain development and behavior\n\nPediatrician and neonatologist Dr. Neema Shrestha says, “Excessive use of TV/media (>2 hours/day) to watch poor-quality content has been found to lower cognitive development in children. It has been shown to cause language delays, poor reading and math skills, and short-term memory in children between two to five years.”\n\nTV shows may be educational, but excessive watching can have negative cognitive effects and behavioral effects in children, according to studies. The first couple of years in your child’s life are very important for brain development.\n\nResearchers found that prolonged TV viewing might lower cognitive abilitiesiAlso known as general intelligence, cognitive abilities or skills are needed to carry out a task related to short-term memory, early reading, math skills, and language development (7).\n\nAnother study by The John Hopkins University states that toddlers who watch television for more than two hours a day can have behavioral problems (8).\n\nEven educational shows like Sesame Street and Dora the Explorer are recommended for children not until pre-school age.\n\n10. Exposure to vices\n\nFinding age-appropriate and children-friendly content for children can be challenging for parents. Stuart Fleming, a father, recounts the challenges he and his wife faced while looking for suitable programs for their son. He mentions, “My son (Master 4) didn’t have any screen time until after his second birthday, and even then, it was kept to about 30 minutes each week. When his mother and I started searching for age-appropriate programs, we were surprised by how few – both new releases and old favorites – were free from rapid-fire cuts, unwarranted aggression, mean behavior, or inane storylines (i).”\n\nThis difficulty in finding suitable content becomes critical because inappropriate material on TV can impact children negatively. You may also not always be able to control what your kid watches on the TV.\n\nEarly exposure to inappropriate content that has sex, alcohol, and drugs, could bring up questions in children, the answers to which may be too complicated for them to understand. The worst part is that early exposure can even give them a distorted view of these elements.\n\nThe violence portrayed in a “positive” light in superhero movies and the like gives them an idea that it is “okay” to be violent. So, kids watching TV shows based on superheroes may start believing that violence is not bad.\n\nIt may even encourage violent and aggressive behavior in some kids, which can be detrimental to their social development (9). In some children, this behavior may surface immediately, while in some, it could come up during the later years.\n\n“Television programs showing fast-paced or violent content can negatively impact a child’s behavior. Sometimes, children’s programs may also contain content that may not be appropriate for their age,”\n\nobserves Dr. Shrestha.\n\n11. Gives a distorted view of the world\n\nTelevision may have psychological effects and might lead to the “mean world syndromeiA phenomenon in which people may perceive the world to be more harmful due to long-term exposure to violence ” in kids and teenagers (10).\n\nMovies and other television shows may exaggerate reality and create extremely violent scenes online, which may be terrifying for kids.\n\nThe amount of guns and violence exposure through TV may give them the impression that the world is an unsafe place for them.\n\nAt the same time, animated and cartoon shows, which underplay the effects of violence, may desensitize kids to real-world events.\n\n12. Consumerism\n\nAnother bane of television is consumerismiA consumer behavior characterized by a desire for materialistic things and a better lifestyle. . The number of ads that a child sees on TV exposes them to a variety of brands and products that they may not need.\n\nCommercials encourage kids to consume unhealthy foods and drinks.\n\nChildren begin to believe that fast food, ice creams, and carbonated drinks are good.\n\nParents become the victims of consumerism as kids insist on buying something that they saw on TV. They are forced to spend money on things that their children want but do not need.\n\nWhat Can Parents Do?\n\nParents have to take a stand when it comes to television. If you want to protect your children from the damaging effects of television, here is what you can do.\n\n1. Choose The Right TV Shows\n\nThe first step is to figure out what shows are appropriate for children. You will have to do some research to understand the content and the message that the show sends out to the audience. Do not pick a show just because it is for children. Keep in mind the following factors before you decide what to watch for kids:\n\nThe content of the show must be appropriate for your child’s age.\n\nPick shows with shorter duration. The longer they watch, the more the chances of them getting addicted.\n\nCheck the tone and pace of the show as you would not want your kids to watch an energetic show before going to bed.\n\nDo not let them watch ads. Kids are naïve and commercials can be manipulative as their primary goal is to sell products by convincing their impressionable audience.\n\nEncourage them to watch educational programs by watching them yourselves.\n\n2. Limit TV Time For Kids\n\nThe number of hours children spend watching digital media are increasing at an alarming rate\n\n. While you may not be able to control how much TV your kids watch outside, you can surely limit it at home. Here’s how.\n\nNo television during mealtime: Do not allow your kids to watch TV while they are eating. Ensure that you have dinner together, if possible, at the dinner table with no TV in the background.\n\nRemove TV from the bedroom: TV in bedrooms is a bad idea, especially for kids as prolonged exposure to screens can affect their sleeping habits and cause sleep disturbances.\n\nTV is not a babysitter: It is common for parents to use the television as a babysitter when they want to do something without being disturbed by their kids. When you are busy, you may not be able to monitor what the kids are watching, and that can expose them to inappropriate content.\n\nTelevision in the background: It is common to leave the TV turned on in the background when you are busy in the kitchen, doing the laundry or working from home. That will only draw the child’s attention to it. Moreover, excessive television viewing can have negative effects on children’s attention span, making it difficult for them to focus on tasks and engage in creative play. So, do not switch on the TV unless you want to watch something.\n\nSet TV time rules for school days: Chalk out specific TV time for kids for weekdays and weekends and stick to them. That will prevent them from watching too much TV on any given day.\n\n3. Make It A Family Activity\n\nTry to make watching TV a fun family activity, instead of a means to pass the time. That will discourage your children from watching it when they are bored or alone at home.\n\n4. Encourage Physical Activity\n\nOne more thing you could do is encourage your children to go out and play. This might help in shifting their attention away from the digital media. If your kids are resisting, then try these:\n\nOrganize play dates with your neighbor’s kids.\n\nParticipate with them in some outdoor games.\n\nEncourage them to participate in games and sports at school.\n\nReward them if they voluntarily ditch the TV to play outdoors.\n\nRole Of Television In Your Kid’s Life\n\nLet’s face the fact that television is not going anywhere anytime soon. So, not buying a TV to keep your child ‘safe’ does not guarantee that they will not be exposed to it. They can watch TV at school, at a friend’s house, or at any other place.\n\nBut this does not mean you cannot control the influence of television on your children. As a parent, you can decide how much TV your kid sees. If your kids are old enough to understand, then explain to them why you are limiting the screen time and how it can affect them; this might reduce the resistance.\n\nTelevision is a vital part of our lives nowadays. However, when children start to indulge in watching too much TV, most parents wonder about the good and bad effects of television on them. While TV is a source of entertainment and a great way to engage in informative and educational content, sometimes it could also negatively impact a child’s well-being. Hence, it is important for you as a parent to set a few rules, such as establishing a fixed screen time, choosing the right kind of shows for children, and encouraging physical activity. Remember that television can do good for your child when using it with caution and appropriate parental supervision.\n\nIs excessive TV watching detrimental for your child?
