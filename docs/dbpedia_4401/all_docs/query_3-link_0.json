        "text": "The audience is the most important consideration when designing a television show, not the idea or concept. For me, storytelling has to be intentional and has to be guided by predetermined outcomes...at the very least define and identify who your audience is and the emotions you intend to harvest from them.\n\nAs a TV Showrunner and producer, I have long resolved that the future of entertainment is television; whether as a streamed longform series or reels and shorts on a mobile device. The challenge however, is keeping up, speaking to, and connecting with an audience.\n\nAs storytellers we have forever lost the luxury of having brilliant ideas and then going on to produce them expecting that there will be an audience waiting at the end of the line to reward said brilliant ideas. We now live in times where the audience now demands what, where, and how they want to consume content.\n\nIt then makes sense, I think, to re-think the content development process by creating from an audience-demand approach seeing that audiences are now spoilt for choice, with a buffet of options they didn’t have a decade ago, and have no fidelity to storytellers or platforms.\n\nThat brilliant idea will most likely be competing with millions of views for a video of someone eating takeout in their car, so your three act masterpiece might not get anywhere near the numbers you hoped. Not to say that millions of people watching someone eating in their car isn’t entertaining, but one-size fits all content isn’t at all a thing that is possible, not anymore. Now, you must decide who your audience is and then decide what language or codes are best suited to connect with them.\n\nAn audience-demand approach means your story must check a whole new set of boxes if it must cut through the clutter that is getting louder and diversely dynamic. The world has evolved and the audience with it.\n\nThis advertising/research-based process isn’t new, but for independent content makers, this needs to be embraced at the development stage to increase the chances that content will connect with intended audiences. It becomes even more important with the unfolding streaming wars primed to get fiercer and much more strategic with respect to title offerings.\n\nTake live-action super hero TV shows for example; they work because there is a significant number of viewers who grew up reading comic books and watching children animated shows of these super heroes. Will the next generation care about these characters or will the studios need to re-imagine them? Case in point is the very successful show \"The Boys\" which now has a spin-off show titled \"Gen-V\", created no doubt as an offering to this generation of young people (the Gen Zs). \"Stranger Things\" is yet another show that has the actors/characters growing up on the show, and with them a generation of fans.\n\nThere is also the mining of new audiences with studios beginning to test the African and diaspora markets with films and TV shows that appeal to African and black audiences.\n\nAs African creatives however, have we made significant creative investments in the past? Did we do enough by way of creating content made for African children or did we leave it all to the West to do? Our children, in Nigeria at least, I cannot speak for the rest of Africa, largely grew up on western TV shows so these studios can risk banking on significant box office and streaming revenue from the continent for a now readymade adult audience. They made the investment and now we should also, to bridge the huge content deficit with respect to content designed and created for African and black children.\n\nContent is the new oil and as African Storytellers, we need to start story-investing in the audience we want tomorrow as we connect with the day’s audience demand.\n\nFor us at Next Narrative Africa, our intentions are clear, \"telling African stories for global Impact\", it is an approach that is heavy on audience research, and one that also deploys testing of key narrative objectives to ensure they not only meet the emotional desires of our intended audience, but also shows that are entertaining, delivering on social impact.\n\nWe say story is king, but, the audience/subjects decide how long it reigns."
