        "text": "Who doesn't love Netflix? Everybody loves watching Netflix especially in a time like this; corona time. Watching a movie is much more easily consumable way rather than reading a book. A motion picture is more visual and easier to remember, compare with written works like books. Reading can push your imagination cause youâ€™ll be a part of the story, yet a movie helps you visualize the situation easily.\n\nThe effectiveness and influence of movies due to the visual, rather than textual concept, bring out the display content much more quickly than a book. At the end of the day, movies are better than books. Why? Reading a book takes so much time. I think nowadays people will choose to do a Harry Potter movie marathon, rather than to go through 600 pages of it. Because people nowadays are more likely to read a summary or watching a short explanation video about it. Time is money and with all the busy schedules people have, they hardly get time to read 600 pages.\n\nMovies can be an engaging activity since you can only read a book by yourself. On the other side, the experience of watching a movie is different especially when you watch it together with your friends or family. For me, visualization is better than imagination.\n\nTo sum up, people have their own preferences for this matter. If you are looking for details, character development, and such, the book will provide you with a lot of it and use your imagination to visualize on your own. But, if you want quick entertainment due to the lack of time, choose a movie. Watching a movie with a good visualization makes it more interesting."
