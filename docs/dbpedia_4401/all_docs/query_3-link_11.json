And high-quality programming for children can be educational. But the latest evidence also suggests there can be negative consequences to our abundant watching, particularly when the shows are mostly entertainment.\n\nThe harm seems to come not so much from the content itself but from the fact that it replaces more enlightening ways of spending time."
