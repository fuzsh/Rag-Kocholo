Andy previews Intermezzo, the new Sally Rooney (out in September) and enjoys A Body Made of Glass: A History of Hypochondria by the guest on our Agatha Christie show, Caroline Crampton. John chooses Ex-Wife by Ursula Parrott, a re-issue of a controversial 1929 bestseller from Faber Editions and A Spell of Good Things, the latest chronicle of modern Nigerian life by Ayọ̀bámi Adébáyọ̀ while Nicky enjoys Daunt Books reissue of Ann Schlee’s 1981 Booker shortlisted novel, Rhine Journey and ends with a general appreciation of David Nicholls, and his latest bestseller, You Are Here, in particular.

We are joined by Caroline Crampton, writer and host of the Shedunnit podcast, and Laura Thompson, author and Christie biographer, for an investigation of Endless Night (1967), a late entry in the Queen of Crime's extensive catalogue and perhaps her last truly great novel of suspense and surprise. NB. Whilst we refrain from revealing the killer's identity (just about), there are enough clues sprinkled throughout the podcast that listeners may be advised to read the book first; you don't need to be Hercule Poirot or Miss Marple to work out whodunnit. This episode was recorded in front of a live audience at Foyles in Charing Cross Road, London, on 17th July 2024.

First published in 1958, the book is now considered by critics to be a sui genesis classic. Storr was a prolific author, with dozens of titles to her name; her work for children often mixes fantasy and horror with her extensive professional knowledge of child psychology. In 1972, Marianne Dreams was adapted for television as Escape Into Night; in 1988, a film version entitled Paperhouse was released; and in 1999 the author herself turned the novel into an opera libretto. What is it about this story that speaks to successive generations of readers, viewers and listeners? Only the stones - and our guests - know for sure...\n\nBooks mentioned\n\nCatherine Storr - Marianne Dreams\n\nRachael King - The Grimmelings\n\nRichard Blanford - My Life In Orbit\n\nOther links\n\nPaperhouse\n\nEscape Into Night (Youtube)\n\nAuthor Rose Ruane (This is Yesterday, Birding) picks Gaining Ground AKA Abra (1978) by Canadian feminist writer Joan Barfoot. One day, seemingly on a whim, a woman walks out of her home and her marriage, forsaking her family for a life of near-solitude and self-sufficiency. Many years later, her daughter, now grown-up, comes to find her and to ask a simple question: why? But there are no easy answers... In a long and distinguished literary career, Barfoot has won the Marian Engel Award and been longlisted for the Man Booker Prize, for Critical Injuries (2002). Her debut novel, however, seems to have vanished almost as thoroughly as its female protagonist; as you will hear from our discussion, we think the book richly deserves to be rediscovered.\n\nBacklisted will be live at Foyles in London on 17th July with guests Caroline Crampton and Andrew Male - on Agatha Christie's Endless Night - tickets are available now via the Foyles website.\n\nBooks mentioned\n\nJoan Barfoot - Gaining Ground; Abra; Critical Injuries\n\nRose Ruane - This is Yesterday; Birding\n\nSylvia Plath - The Bell Jar\n\nSir Gawain and the Green Knight is the subject of this episode of Backlisted. Dr Martin Shaw and Dr Laura Varnam (hwaet Laura!) join Andy and John to discuss this late 14th-century chivalric romance - or subversion thereof - written in Middle English alliterative verse, author unknown. We discuss the poem's chequered history and a variety of translations by Simon Armitage, J.R.R. Tolkien, Marie Borroff and Dr Shaw himself. We also take a look at some of the film, TV and radio adaptations of the poem, the most recent of which is The Green Knight (2021), starring Dev Patel. This show was recorded in front of a live audience at Foyles in Charing Cross Road, London, on 12th June 2024. Locklisted subscribers will be able to hear more Gawain chat next weekend, including some terrific contributions and questions from members of the audience.

H2G2, as it is known to fans, was a cultural phenomenon in the true sense of that degraded term: first a hit radio show, then a bestselling novel, then a double LP, then a stage adaptation, then a second radio series, then another novel, then a video game, then a TV series, then another LP, then a third novel… you get the idea. We have chosen the scripts of the original radio series as our entry point into the Hitchhiker multiverse because each of us brings our own unique, informed perspective to the saga: longtime Adams fan Joel Morris has written a new book entitled Be Funny or Die: How Comedy Works and Why It Matters; author Gail Renard was a friend and colleague of Douglas’s and an eyewitness to the irresistible and highly improbable success of Hitchhiker; as a publisher, John has worked on several books by or about the great man; and Andy cheerfully admits to having borrowed many of his best ideas from The Guide. Please consider this, then, our loving tribute to a true giant of literature, comedy, technology and being an actual giant, Douglas having been one of the only people in history tall enough to break his nose with his own knee.\n\nBooks mentioned\n\nDouglas Adams - The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy: The Original Radio Scripts\n\nJoel Morris - Be Funny or Die: How Comedy Works and Why It Matters\n\nGail Renard - Give Me A Chance\n\nKevin Jon Davies (ed.) - 42: The Wildly Improbable Ideas of Douglas Adams\n\nOther links\n\nGail Renard website - http://www.gailrenard.com/\n\nJoel Morris - https://x.com/gralefrit\n\nThe Comfort Blanket podcast - https://open.spotify.com/show/5qfcU1fgkeOLMadWjQA5Ix\n\nThe Rule of Three podcast - https://www.ruleofthreepod.com/\n\nNovelist Alex Michaelides (The Silent Patient, The Fury) joins Andy and John to discuss Ford Madox Ford's classic novel The Good Soldier (1915), a tale of passion in which, owing to a narrator of almost comic unreliability, nothing can be taken for granted. It is a book that seems to change on every reading, both a kaleidoscopic psychological drama and 'the saddest story I have ever heard'. During his lifetime 'Fordie' was, variously, a prolific author, a publisher of historical note, a notable polyamorist and a serial liar; we consider the extent to which the character of John Dowell in The Good Soldier may be considered a self-portrait.\n\nThis episode was recorded live on stage at Foyles, Charing Cross Road in London on the evening of 15th May 2024 and is the first date of a monthly residency.

The book she has chosen to discuss is A Marsh Island, a 19th century American novel by Sarah Orne Jowett, who is usually considered one of the foremost proponents of American regionalism – an assumption this episode investigates. The book was first serialised in the Atlantic Monthly magazine in 1885 and published by Houghton Mifflin later that year. The story centres on Dick Dale, a wealthy young urban bohemian artist who finds himself billeted with a traditional farming family in the middle of New England’s Great Salt Marsh. His impact on the small community over the course of a harvest provides what plot there is – but the novel is rich in atmosphere and interior reflection, exploring the complex tensions between rural and urban ways of life in late 19th century East Coast America. It was written at a moment in Jewett’s own life when she had just begun an unconventional relationship with another woman and the episode also explores how that plays out in the subversive presentation of the relationships in the novel.\n\nBooks mentioned\n\nSarah Orne Jewett - A Marsh Island; A Country Doctor and Selected Stories and Sketches; An Arrow in a Sunbeam; The Life of Nancy; Deephaven and Selected Stories; The Tory Lover; A Country Doctor; The Country of the Pointed Firs\n\nNoreen Masud - A Flat Place; Stevie Smith and the Aphorism: Hard Language\n\nOther links\n\nNoreen’s website - https://www.noreenmasud.com/\n\nA reminder that Backlisted will be doing a series of live shows at Foyles in central London.

James. The author is probably best remembered as one of Britain's greatest exponents of detective fiction, an heir to the Golden Age of female novelists such as Agatha Christie, Ngaio Marsh, Dorothy Sayers et al. In The Children of Men, however, James depicts a nightmare near-future in which the world is literally coming to an end. The book became a bestseller; in 2006, it was adapted for the big screen by the Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón. We look at the ways in which James explored issues that seem eerily contemporary: the societal impact of an uncontrolled virus, falling fertility rates, an ageing population, the rise of populism and accompanying exploitation of migrant labour. She also knew how to grip her readers to the very last page. Phyllis Dorothy James, Baroness James of Holland Park, lived a long and remarkable life and it was a pleasure for all of us to revisit her work and biography in this episode.\n\nBooks mentioned\n\nP.D.

We focus on her brilliant second collection All My Pretty Ones (1962). Sexton was a trailblazing American poet of the so-called 'confessional' school of the 1960s, one whose writing continues to provoke controversy and debate; her friends and contemporaries included Sylvia Plath and John Berryman. We hear from Sexton herself, in recordings of readings and interviews, and fronting own experimental jazz-rock ensemble, Anne Sexton and Her Kind, and also from her daughter Linda.\n\nPlease note: Anne Sexton was an unflinching chronicler of her own struggle with mental illness, and this episode contains extensive discussion of suicide and sexual abuse.\n\nBooks mentioned\n\nAnne Sexton - All My Pretty Ones; Mercies: Selected Poems; No Evil Star: Selected Essays, Interviews, and Prose; Anne Sexton: A Self-Portrait in Letters\n\nEmily Berry - Dear Boy, Stranger Baby, Unexhausted Time; The Breakfast Bible; ‘The White Review: The Secret Country of Her Mind’\n\nOther links\n\nEmily Berry website - https://www.emilyberry.co.uk/\n\nSleep World app - https://sleepworlds.com/\n\nThe New School of Confessional Poetry - https://www.poetryfoundation.org/collections/151109/an-introduction-to-confessional-poetry\n\nAnne Sexton and Her Kind Sound Recordings, 1968-1971 - https://library.harvard.edu/collections/anne-sexton-and-her-kind-sound-recordings-1968-1971\n\nAnne Sexton at home reading Wanting to Die - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UM6nWRXCQD8\n\nThis episode of Backlisted is devoted to A Life in Movies (1986), the first volume of memoirs of the filmmaker Michael Powell who, with his partner Emeric Pressburger, is responsible for some of the finest, most magical and soulful films ever to come out of the UK: The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp, Black Narcissus, The Red Shoes, and many more. Joining us for a discussion of Powell's life and work - and his vision of cinema as a space in which all the other arts may find expression - are memoirist and critic James Cook and film writer and academic Melanie Williams. We focus on four productions of the Archers that between them tell the story of Powell and Pressburger's achievement: The Spy in Black, A Matter of Life and Death, \"I Know Where I'm Going!\" and Gone to Earth. If you have yet to see these films, or any of Michael Powell's work, set aside some time for your next personal obsession.

We are joined by two resident experts: the writer Jeff Young and the playwright and screenwriter, Lizzie Nunnery. The book under discussion is Melly’s Scouse Mouse, which is chronologically the first part of Melly’s memoirs. It was first published by Weidenfeld & Nicolson in 1984 and was the third to be released despite covering the first fourteen years of Melly’s life, painting a vivid portrait of growing up in a middle-class Liverpool family, tinged with eccentricity and theatricality, and his painful experiences at boarding school. Subtitled ‘I Never Got Over It’, it was preceded by Rum, Bum & Concertina, an account of his time in the navy, published in 1977, and Owning Up, which covers his years as an aspiring musician in the jazz world of the 1950s, first published in 1965. The final volume, Slowing Down was published in 2005, two years before Melly died.\n\nScouse Mouse was Melly’s personal favourite of the four: ‘I don’t know why the events of over sixty years ago should be so much clearer than those of yesterday afternoon, but they are.’ He also adopted that ever-useful motto for the memoirist: ‘Life is lived forwards but understood backwards.’ How much this classic childhood memoir helps us understand the outrageous, complex and multi-faceted life of the grown-up George Melly is just one of the things the panel explore. They also revisit his brilliant book on the pop culture of the 1960s, Revolt Into Style, a book Andy first discussed back on episode 22 on Randall Jarrell’s The Animal Family.\n\nThis podcast was filmed and will be available as a video on our Youtube channel from Monday 19th Feb. We will also be posting an extra half hour of this episode on the Patreon next weekend for subscribers only.\n\nBooks mentioned\n\nGeorge Melly - Owning Up: The Trilogy (ft.

First published in 1933, Love on the Dole, revolves explores the fortunes of the Hardcastle family, who live in industrial Salford in the 1930s, just as the Depression is beginning to bite. Greenwood’s authentic portrayal of the corrosive effects of mass unemployment and poverty was well received by critics, but it wasn’t until the 1934 stage version had become a hit, that the book became a bestseller. It is estimated that a million people has seen the play by the end of 1935 and the book has remained in print ever since. However, it had to wait until 1941 before being made into a classic film which featured Deborah Kerr in her first starring role. We discuss the books connections to other working-class novels, its wider cultural impact and its influence on the gritty social dramas of the 1960s, the interesting differences between the book and the film adaptation, and we ask why, despite the classic status accorded to Love on the Dole, Greenwood himself and his nine other novels have faded into obscurity.\n\nBooks mentioned\n\nWalter Greenwood - Love on the Dole; Standing Room Only; Cure for Love\n\nAndrew Hankinson - You Could Do Something Amazing With Your Life [You Are Raoul Moat]; Don’t Applaud.

First published in 1964, The Stone Angel is a landmark in modern Canadian fiction. The narrator is the unforgettable Hagar Shipley, a spiky, sharp-tongued, proud and profane ninety-year-old who is trying to resist her family’s attempts to transfer her into a nursing home. This battle is interwoven with memories of her long and difficult life, much of it spent in the Manitoban prairie town of Manawaka, a place closely based on Laurence’s own home town of Neepawa and which would provide the setting for three more novels and a collection of stories. We discuss the book’s place in the Canadian pantheon and speculate on why it hasn’t become an established classic outside Canada (it is no longer in print with Virago). We also discover some unexpected coincidences among Margaret Laurence’s neighbours during the years she lived in England in the late sixties and early seventies. This is a book that deserves to find many more new readers.\n\nAlso here’s a reminder that if you'd like to sign up to our monthly newsletter which features book recommendations from our guests and as well as the three of us, please click here.\n\nBooks Mentioned\n\nMargaret Laurence - The Stone Angel; A Jest of God; The Diviners; Recognition and Revelation: Short Non-Fiction Writings\n\nLennie Goodings - A Bite of the Apple: A Life with Books, Writers and Virago\n\nOther Links\n\nPoet in the City - https://www.poetinthecity.co.uk/\n\nVirago Press - https://www.virago.co.uk\n\nFor this year’s Backlisted Christmas Special we are joined by the poet and novelist Clare Pollard and our producer Nicky Birch to discuss not just a book, but adaptations of a book – and there are hundreds to choose from – and all have contributed to making it perhaps the most famous Christmas story of them all: A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens. Written in six weeks in 1843, it was a massive and immediate success, selling out its first run of 6,000 copies by Christmas Eve. It has been in print ever since and has come to define the festive period for millions of readers, listeners and viewers. We explore why and how this fable – terrifying in parts, warm and reassuring in others – has exerted such a hold on our collective imagination. We each pick a favourite version (you’ll have to listen to find out which) but also range over others from Richard Williams’ celebrated 1971 animation to those featuring Mister Magoo and Ebeneezer Blackadder. Plus Andy has compiled a special festive playlist for you to listen to over the mulled wine and marzipan fruits. There never was such an episode!\n\nAnd finally, on this most special of days, we’d like thank you all for your support during the year and to wish you: A VERY MERRY CHRISTMAS!\n\nBooks mentioned\n\nCharles Dickens - A Christmas Carol\n\nClare Pollard - Incarnation; The Modern Fairies; Fierce Bad Rabbits; Delphi\n\nChris Priestley - The Last of the Spirits\n\nOther links\n\nMister Magoos Christmas Carol (1962)\n\nA Christmas Carol (Richard Williams Productions, 1971)\n\nBlackadder’s Christmas Carol\n\nScrooge The Musical with Albert Finney\n\nScrooged - The Movie\n\nA Muppet Christmas Carol - stream via Disney; Apple TV\n\nAndy’s festive playlist\n\nToday’s episode focuses on a single long poem – Briggflatts by the Northumbrian poet Basil Bunting. It was recorded live in St Mary’s Church, Woodstock in Oxfordshire, as part of the Woodstock Poetry Festival. Andy and John are joined by Neil Astley, the founder of Bloodaxe Books, who knew and published Bunting, and Kirsten Norrie, a poet and composer who writes and performs under her Highland name, MacGillivray. The episode begins and ends with recordings made in 1977 of Bunting reading from the poem, which was first published in 1966. Until that time, Bunting, who in the 1930s had been a friend to W. B. Yeats and Ezra Pound, was living in semi-obscurity in rural Northumbria. It was his live readings of the poem, subtitled ‘An Autobiography’ at the medieval Mordern Tower in Newcastle that transformed his reputation. We discuss his remarkable and sometimes controversial life – before his exile he was at various times a music critic, a sailor, a balloon operator, a wing commander, a military interpreter, a foreign correspondent, and a spy – and its relationship to his work, and particularly Briggflatts, now regarded as one of the greatest English poems of the 20th century.\n\nBooks mentioned\n\nBasil Bunting - Briggflatts; Basil Bunting: Complete Poems\n\nNeil Astley - Staying Alive; The Sheep Who Changed the World\n\nKirsten Norrie - Ravage: An Astonishment of Fire; The Last Wolf of Scotland; Scottish Lost Boys (forthcoming November 2024); An American Book of the Dead (forthcoming 2025)\n\nRosemary Tonks - The Bloater; Bedouin of the London Evening\n\nOther links\n\nBasil Bunting reading from Briggflatts (Bloodaxe Books)\n\nA World of My Own: Basil Bunting (A film by Jeremy Lack, 1969)\n\nFor our 200th episode, we are joined by Richard Osman: television presenter, longtime Backlisted listener, and one of the bestselling authors in the world today. We discuss Trustee from the Toolroom (1960), the final novel by Nevil Shute Norway, whose other books include A Town Like Alice (1950) and On the Beach (1957), widely read in his lifetime but now somewhat forgotten or ignored. How did Shute's long and distinguished stint as an aeronautical engineer fit with his parallel career as a prominent and much-loved author? And what do his tales of ordinary people doing extraordinary things have to offer us in the 21st century? Richard also shares with John and Andy what he's been reading this week; and if you've been with us from the start, you will appreciate his choices all the more.\n\nBooks mentioned:\n\nNevil Shute - Trustee from the Toolroom; A Town Like Alice; On the Beach; In the Wet; Slide Rule: An Autobigraphy\n\nRichard Osman - The Thursday Murder Club; The Man Who Died Twice; The Bullet That Missed; The Last Devil to Die\n\nJ.L.
