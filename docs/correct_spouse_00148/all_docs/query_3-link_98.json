        "text": "Matt Le Blanc and Andrea Anders\n\nMatt Le Blanc and Andrea Andrews have called time on their relationship after eight years together.\n\nLe Blanc arrived at the premiere party for second four of Episodes alone earlier this week, leading to the revelation that he and Andrews are no longer together. A representative told Us Weekly magazine that the couple had parted ways a couple of months ago.\n\nThe actor started dating Andrea shortly after splitting from his ex-wife, former model Melissa McKnight - who he was married to for three years and had daughter Marina, 10, with - in 2006.\n\nAndrea appeared alongside Matt in his 'Friends' spin-off show 'Joey' for two years, in which she starred as his titular character's ditzy next door neighbour Alex.\n\nMatt is currently living in London while shooting 'Episodes' and he was recently part of a 'Friends' reunion with his co-stars Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, David Schwimmer and Matthew Perry which took place over email.\n\nJennifer recently said: \"We tried really hard to get together for a reunion in September but some of us were in New York and some in London so sadly it didn't happen.\n\n\"But we did have a wonderful few days of an email exchange between us.\n\n\"Courteney, Lisa and I all have dinners together regularly. We grew up together - we're family.\""
