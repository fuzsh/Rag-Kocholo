        "text": "What Is Matt LeBlanc's Net Worth and Salary?\n\nMatt LeBlanc is an American actor and producer who has a net worth of $85 million. Matt LeBlanc is easily best known for portraying the character Joey Tribbiani on the hit TV sitcom \"Friends,\" which ran from 1994 to 2004.\n\nBefore his rise to fame, LeBlanc appeared in a variety of commercials and had minor roles in television shows such as \"TV 101\" and \"Married… with Children.\" His early work set the stage for his breakout role in \"Friends.\" As Joey, a struggling actor with a heart of gold, LeBlanc's charming naiveté and impeccable comedic timing won hearts worldwide, earning him three Emmy nominations.\n\nAfter \"Friends,\" LeBlanc took on the lead role in \"Joey,\" which followed his character's attempts to make it big in Hollywood. Though the show didn't replicate the success of \"Friends,\" it demonstrated LeBlanc's commitment to his character. He then took a brief hiatus from television, returning in 2011 with the Showtime/BBC series \"Episodes.\" Playing a fictionalized version of himself, Matt's performance was critically acclaimed, earning him a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Television Series Musical or Comedy.\n\nLeBlanc also ventured into presenting, co-hosting the popular automotive show \"Top Gear\" from 2016 to 2019. His love for cars and charismatic on-screen presence brought a new dynamic to the show. In 2016, he returned to network television with the CBS sitcom \"Man with a Plan,\" on which he played a father who takes on more responsibility at home when his wife goes back to work. The show ran for four seasons, showcasing LeBlanc's talent in family-oriented comedy.\n\nEarly Life\n\nMatt LeBlanc was born Matthew Steven LeBlanc on July 25, 1967, in Newton, Massachusetts. He attended Newton North High School, where comedian Louis C.K. was his classmate. After graduating in 1985, Matt went on to attend the Wentworth Institute of Technology in Boston, but he left shortly after starting his second semester to pursue an acting career.\n\nEarly Acting Career\n\nIn the 1980s, LeBlanc appeared in a series of television commercials for such nationally-known products as Heinz and Coca-Cola. In 1988, he landed his first TV role for the show \"TV 101,\" which only lasted one season. LeBlanc scored a recurring role in 1991 on the popular Fox sitcom \"Married…with Children\" playing Vinnie Verducci. He also appeared in various music videos for artists such as Bon Jovi, Alanis Morissette, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, and Bob Seger.\n\n\"Friends\"\n\nLeBlanc's big break didn't come until he auditioned for the role of goofy, bighearted \"ladies' man\" Joey Tribbiani on \"Friends,\" a role he began playing in 1994 and went on to play for ten seasons. He was reportedly down to his last $11 dollars before landing the gig. This role propelled him to stardom, along with his co-stars, and LeBlanc quickly became a household name. He received three Emmy nominations for his work on the show. He also starred in the spin-off TV series \"Joey\" from 2004 to 2006. Matt also made a few appearances in Lisa Kudrow's show \"Web Therapy\" around this time. He went on a five-year hiatus from acting following the cancellation of \"Joey.\"\n\nOther Work\n\nHis most notable movie roles have been in \"Ed,\" \"All The Queen's Men,\" \"Lost In Space,\" \"Lovesick,\" and \"Charlie's Angels.\" LeBlanc starred in the television series \"Episodes\" from 2011 to 2017. This series was written by Jeffrey Klarik and \"Friends\" co-creator David Crane. Matt began hosting the series \"Top Gear\" in 2016, and the same year, he began starring as Adam Burns on the CBS television series \"Man with a Plan.\" Matt left \"Top Gear\" in May 2018 after three years. LeBlanc has won many awards, including a Golden Globe Award for \"Episodes,\" a Screen Actors Guild Award for \"Friends,\" and People's Choice Awards for \"Joey\" and \"Man with a Plan.\" In May 2020, \"Man with a Plan\" was canceled. In 2021, he appeared on \"Friends: The Reunion\" and \"Top Gear: A Tribute to Sabine Schmitz.\"\n\nPersonal Life\n\nIn May 2003, LeBlanc married his longtime girlfriend, British-born American model Melissa McKnight. Together the couple has a daughter, Marina, who was born in 2004. The couple divorced in October 2006. After becoming divorced, Matt dated actress Andrea Anders from 2006 to 2015. The pair met on the set of \"Joey.\"\n\nReal Estate\n\nIn 2007, soon after divorcing Melissa McKnight, Matt spent $7.4 million on a house in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles. He moved out of the home in 2012 and rented it for $13,000 per month according to real estate listings. He tried to sell the house in 2016 for $10 million. He ultimately found a buyer in 2017 who paid a little less than the $7.4 million Matt spent on the house 10 years earlier. He owns two side-by-side homes in Encino, California, and a 1,000-acre ranch in Santa Ynez, California, that he bought in 2002.\n\nMatt LeBlanc \"Friends\" Salaries\n\nFor the first season of \"Friends,\" each cast member earned $22,500 per episode. That works out to $540,000 for the first season. Their salaries were boosted to $40,000 per episode in the second season. That works out to $960,000 for the second season. Ahead of the third season when their contracts were up, the cast banded together to negotiate as a group. They ended up with a deal that paid $75,000 per episode of season three ($1.875 million for the season), $85,000 for season 4 ($2.04 million), $100,000 for season 5 ($2.5 million), and $125,000 in season 6 ($3.125 million). Ahead of season 7, the cast negotiated for a massive raise. They each ended up earning $750,000 per episode in seasons 7 and 8 ($18 million per season). For seasons 9 and 10, each cast member earned $1 million per episode. That works out to $24 million for season 9 and $18 million for season 10. If you total it all up, each cast member of \"Friends\" earned around $90 million in base salary alone from the show before backend bonuses and ongoing royalties.\n\n\"Friends\" Royalties"
