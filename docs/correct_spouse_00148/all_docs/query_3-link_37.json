        "text": "Matt LeBlanc and his girlfriend, actress Andrea Anders, have broken up after eight years. Us Weekly said LeBlanc's representative confirmed that the split happened some unspecified time ago. LeBlanc, 47, whose Showtime series \"Episodes\" returns for season four on Sunday, married model Melissa McKnight, who had two children from a previous marriage, in May 2003. The couple had a daughter, Marina, 10. LeBlanc filed for divorce in 2006 amid reports of infidelity with Anders, who played his neighbor on his \"Friends\" spinoff, \"Joey.\""
