According to the latest gossip news updates, the Showtime Episodes star is making it clear that he did not cheat on his longtime girlfriend, Andrea Anders, when he was recently in Austin, Texas. LeBlanc claims that all he was doing was taking a few picture at a party with some excited fans, but if things do go south at least this time his net worth will be relatively safe. Despite dating eight years, LeBlanc hasn't married Anders; so at least Matt learned something from that first marriage.\n\nLast week multiple reports surfaced that famous Friends actor Matt LeBlanc had been less than faithful at a Halloween event in Austin, Texas on October 31.\n\nOne eyewitness to the Lone Star State revelry wrote in Life & Style Magazine that Matt was living it up like he was Matt Dillon in Wild Things, and he didn't care who saw it:\n\n\"He proceeded to make out with one woman and then the other before ordering the pair to lock lips with each other!\n\n\"But that wasn't enough to keep Matt entertained.\n\n\"He eventually moved on to a woman dressed as a sex slave, whom he flirtingly slung his arm around for most of the rest of the night.\n\n\"He capped off the evening by hitting on a lady dressed as the Cat in the Hat before calling it quits at 3 a.m.!\"\n\nThe only problem with the story is Matt claims that nothing like that ever come close to happening that night in Austin.\n\nLeBlanc set the record straight in Star's latest December 1, issue explaining that all he did was take a few selfies with some dedicated fans:\n\n\"The reports that I was cheating on my girl are absolutely not true.\n\n\"I took some picture with some people...I was being polite.\n\n\"There was nothing more to it than that.\n\n\"It didn't happen...It's ridiculous.\"\n\nAccording an insider who also spoke with Star this week, if anything, it was the women that were being inappropriate this time around--not Matt:\n\n\"One of the women there was hanging on him; that happens sometimes when you are famous.\n\n\"But Matt was a gentleman.\"\n\nIt seems pretty odd that so many people at the same party would have such different versions of the event in question, but apparently everything really is bigger in Texas...including the B.S.\n\nAbout the Author\n\n© 2024 Classicalite All rights reserved.
