Kind of sad, but true.\n\nSucks to be Joey.\n\nAnd now that Joey is cancelled, I'll never know what will happen in the great Adam Goldberg: father to lameass nephew saga. It's the greatest cliffhanger of all time!\n\ndamn, 3 years? it feels like 6 months since i saw their pics getting married in hawaii.\n\nAnother Hollywood couple splits up, what else is new?\n\nHow you doin?\n\nAnne and Gilbert are so my OTP.\n\nIcon love!\n\nbreakups make me so depressed even if i don't care about the people\n\nsame here :|\n\nYour fortune cookie for today: You are a good person. Lucky number 52.\n\nI agree. I just want celebrities to end up happy, as lame as that sounds.\n\nYeah me too.\n\nomfg your icon--HAHAHAH\n\nI know! :(\n\nThat's too bad about their daughter. I'm too scared to google it but does anyone know if her cognitive development is delayed?\n\nYou mean a developmental delay?\n\nyes, I was wondering what kind of developmental delay. Like cognitive or physical. I hate googling disorders because it freaks me out and worries me. But I still want to know. Make any sense?\n\n(no subject) - velouramor Expand\n\n(no subject) - poppyspiral Expand\n\nhow suprising..\n\nthat's sad... i love matt.\n\nHah, Joey got cancelled? Not surprising..\n\nJoey was cancelled?\n\nI mean, not to say that I'm surprised due to the lack of quality...wait, yes. I am. usually shitty shows are the ones that last.\n\nI blame Jennifer Coolidge. She sucks the life out of everything (and stuffs it in her bra or lips)\n\nPoor kid though. Thats pretty sad.\n\nJennifer Coolidge is alright. :(\n\n*shrug* i find her obnoxious and annoying.\n\nbut hey, thats her schtick. didn't mean to offend.\n\nI agree that her boobs and lips are bloated. But I think she is super-funny.\n\ni don't really understand why couples who date for like 10 years only stay married for like 2-3 years.\n\nHe's so boring in real life. It's hilarious compared to his character.\n\nhe's having a bad year.\n\nwho says their marriage is \"cancelled\"?\n\nMatt LeBlanc."
