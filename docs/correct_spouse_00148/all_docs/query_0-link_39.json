        "text": "Matt LeBlanc is best known for playing ladies' man Joey Tribbiani on \"Friends.\" He played the role on the popular sitcom from 1994 to 2004, earning three Emmy nominations, and even went on to star in the short-lived spinoff, \"Joey,\" which ran for two seasons before it ended in 2006 (per IMDb).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd it turns out that LeBlanc's love life has at times been just as complicated as his alter ego's. In addition to plenty of flings in the early stages of his career, LeBlanc also had long-term relationships that ended due to rumors of infidelity. The actor might have inherited his commitment issues from his father, Paul.\n\n\"My dad has been married eight, nine, 10 times,\" LeBlanc explained, according to the Daily Express. \"He was a ladies' man. Now he's old. I don't talk to him.\" If his father taught him anything, it is that even those closest to you cannot always be trusted. \"You can learn valuable lessons from unpleasant people, too,\" LeBlanc said.\n\nEarly on in his career, LeBlanc reportedly had flings with a bevy of actresses and models, including Minnie Driver, Playboy playmate Tonya Poole, volleyball player Gabrielle Reece, porn star Jenna Jameson, and a then-17-year-old Kate Hudson, according to The Sun (per News.com.au).The two were allegedly spotted hanging out in bars together in the early '90s, although neither one ever confirmed they were seeing each other.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\" alum Brandi Glanville also claimed to have gone out on a date with LeBlanc, but it didn't end well. \"We went back to his house, he let his dog lick his ice cream and I was out,\" she said about LeBlanc, according to Page Six. \"I was like, 'Nope.' I was totally gonna have sex with him, then the dog licked the ice cream and he licked the ice cream and I was like, 'I can't.'\"\n\nPaul LeBlanc, Matt's father, alleged in 2016 that his son told him he had an affair with \"Friends\" costar Jennifer Aniston while she was married to Brad Pitt. \"[Matt] got on good with Jen. They would make out in the dressing rooms. He told me about it — it was when she was married to Brad Pitt,\" Paul claimed, according to the Mirror.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReps for both LeBlanc and Aniston denied the accusation. \"Jennifer has never had a romantic or sexual relationship with Matt LeBlanc,\" explained Aniston's publicist.\n\nYet when Andy Cohen asked the cast on \"Watch What Happens Live!\" if they were ever asked to sign a contract stipulating that they wouldn't sleep with one another, David Schwimmer revealed (or joked), \"Well, that was broken.\" (per In Touch Weekly).\n\nAfter a string of short-lived relationships, Matt LeBlanc seemed to have found \"the one\" with Melissa McKnight. As a model, she appeared in publications such as Elle, Cosmopolitan, and Vogue before shifting to acting. She made her film debut in \"Triangles and Tribulations,\" and also appeared on television on \"VH1: All Access.\" But it's her relationship with LeBlanc that garnered her the most attention. The two were introduced by Lou Diamond Phillips' then-wife, Kelly, and after just one year of dating, LeBlanc and McKnight were engaged (per Famous People).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe couple wed in Hawaii in 2003 and welcomed their daughter Marina the following year. LeBlanc and McKnight faced every parent's worst nightmare when Marina was diagnosed with a rare brain disorder called \"cortical dysplasia\" at eight months. Luckily, with treatment, she made a full recovery. However, the couple's marriage was already on the rocks, reportedly due to LeBlanc's womanizing ways. In fact, he abruptly moved out of the family home. \"It was very sudden,\" Phillips told People at the time. \"She was absolutely blindsided by what transpired.\"\n\nLeBlanc and McKnight were able to put their differences aside for the sake of their children (they also co-parent McKnight's two children from her first marriage). \"You just try and teach them right and wrong, keep an eye on them and be there with them. You can only do so much,\" LeBlanc told People.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSoon after the demise of his marriage to Melissa McKnight, Matt LeBlanc moved on with his \"Joey\" costar Andrea Anders. The actress had appeared in guest roles on \"One Life to Live, \"Law & Order,\" and \"Oz\" before landing the role of LeBlanc's love interest on the short-lived \"Friends\" spinoff (per IMDb). Ironically, when \"Joey\" ended, Anders went on to play Matthew Perry's love interest on the also short-lived \"Mr. Sunshine.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I know, isn't that neat?\" she said at the time. \"I'm just going to slowly work my way through the cast of 'Friends,' although I can't get Jennifer Aniston to return my calls [laughs]\" (via Page Six).\n\nWhile LeBlanc and Anders seemed happy throughout their eight year relationship, the couple wound up splitting in 2015 after LeBlanc was allegedly seen cheating on Anders during a Halloween party in Austin, Texas (per E! Online).\n\nMatt LeBlanc is now dating Aurora Mulligan, who is 17 years younger than her boyfriend. They met on the set of \"Top Gear.\" Mulligan serves as a producer on the popular British show, while LeBlanc joined as the host in 2016. Shortly after, they were seen together at the Hickstead Derby (via The Sun).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"They were very tactile and Matt seemed to be very taken by Aurora as he laughed chatted intimately with her. Aurora just kept laughing at all his jokes and is clearly besotted with the American superstar,\" an observer told The Sun. \"You wouldn't have known that they were work colleagues at all — it's definitely more than just a professional relationship.\"\n\nAnd the couple seem to still be going strong, with LeBlanc saying on \"The Graham Norton Show\" that he and Mulligan are living together. \"It's half and half. I have a flat here with my girlfriend, but my home is in L.A,\" he said, according to Hello!"
