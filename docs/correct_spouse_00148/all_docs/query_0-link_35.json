        "text": "Matt Le Blanc has a wide range of automotive hobbies and formerly worked as a carpenter before becoming an actor. In May 2003, he married Melissa McKnight, a British-born American model and divorced single mother of two children. Kelly Phillips, a mutual acquaintance of McKnight's, introduced them in 1997. A year later, LeBlanc proposed to her. Their daughter, born in 2004, began having seizures when she was eight months old. The ailment, which was assumed to be a type of dysplasia, had mostly decreased by the time she was two years old."
