Here is everything you should know about her, including her relationship and divorce.\n\nHow old is Melissa McKnight?\n\nShe was born on 10th March 1965 in England as Melissa Sue McKnight and celebrated her 57th birthday in March 2022.\n\nWhere was Melissa McKnight born?\n\nAlthough she is English by birth, her nationality is American. She moved to America at a young age and obtained dual citizenship.\n\nHow tall is Melissa McKnight?\n\nSue is 1.78 m tall.\n\nMelissa McKnight's career\n\nMelissa started her career in modeling and not in the film industry, as some people assume. She was featured in the beauty campaigns of many notable brands and was a cover girl of magazines, such as Vogue, Elle, and Cosmopolitan.\n\nOwing to the fame she had acquired from her modeling career, Sue decided to give the film industry a shot. Perhaps this is the best idea because she excelled in the industry. She made her debut in 2001 after bagging a role in the movie Triangles and Tribulations.\n\nThis is the only movie that makes up the list of Melissa McKnight's movies. However, she appeared in the 2001 show VH1: All Access, which brought her much appreciation from critics and fans.\n\nAlthough she had made a name for herself in the film industry with the two projects, Sue never appeared in any other movie or TV show after that. More so, she never revealed any of her future projects. However, she was spotted in The 31st Annual People Choice Awards in 2005.\n\nMelissa McKnight's net worth\n\nAccording to various sources, McKnight has an approximate worth of $1 million.\n\nMatt LeBlanc and Melissa McKnight's relationship\n\nAlthough most people know Sue as Matt Leblanc's ex-wife, she was married before the two met. Yes, Sue was married to Anthony Robert Esposito from 1990 to 1996 when they divorced. They had two children, Tyler Esposito and Jacqueline Esposito.\n\nAfter years of being single owing to her first divorce, Sue found love in the hands of American actor and producer Matt LeBlanc. He is best known for portraying Joey Tribbiani on the global hit TV sitcom Friends.\n\nHow did Matt LeBlanc meet Melissa McKnight?\n\nMatt met Sue in 1997 through a mutual friend, and the two kicked it off. After dating for one year, Matt went down on his knee and proposed. Sue said yes, and they married in May 2003 in Hawaii.\n\nThey welcomed their daughter, Marina Pearl LeBlanc on 8th February 2004. Marina was sadly diagnosed with cortical dysplasia as a child after experiencing seizures since turning eight months.\n\nHer diagnosis took a toll on her parents, with Matt revealing he had problems filming Friends because he \"almost had a nervous breakdown.\" Luckily, she has since outgrown the condition.\n\nMelissa McKnight's divorce\n\nUnfortunately, this marriage did not have a happy ending. The two called it quits and divorced in 2006, citing repetitive infidelity on Matt LeBlanc's end.\n\nAfter the divorce, the two continued to amicably co-parent and share custody of their daughter Marina. LeBlanc has also moved on, unlike his ex, who is reportedly single.\n\nIs Matt LeBlanc still married?\n\nAfter he divorced Sue in 2006, he dated actress Andrea Anders from 2006 to 2015. They had crossed paths during the filming of Joey. He has been in a relationship with Aurora Mulligan since 2016.\n\nWhere is Melissa McKnight now?\n\nSue has been leading a very private life since her divorce from LeBlanc. It is fair to state that she is raising her kids and enjoying her life away from the public eye.\n\nMelissa McKnight is an English born model and actress who most people know as Matt LeBlanc's ex-wife. She has been married twice and has three children. The mother of three is reportedly single.\n\nREAD ALSO: Who is Manolo Gonzalez Vergara?
