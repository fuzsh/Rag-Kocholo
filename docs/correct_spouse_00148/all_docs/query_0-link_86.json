        "text": "To begin with, did any of you see that dreck on PBS last month called The Gin Game? If you didnt, consider it a mechiaya. Not only was it poorly directed, but also it miscast two televisions icons in the lead roles, Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore. I dont know what was worse; the fact that they used two such beloved legends to draw in an audience, or the fact that Van Dyke and Moore agreed to do it! I mean, come on; Rob and Laura Petrie shouting the F word at one another? And for that matter, how dare PBS, supported by our tax dollars, be permitted by the FCC to broadcast dreck like that while the other major broadcast networks arent permitted to do so, and are even fined heavily if they do? The Gin Game was preceded by no warning of content, gave no indication that such foul language was used. And considering the stars they used, one would have presumed it would be safe for children to watch! Shame on PBS for its handling of the property, and Gezunte shame on Van Dyke and Moore for choosing such a trashy, un-redeeming vehicle for their reunion. And yes, its true that there is a reunion of the surviving original cast of The Dick Van Dyke Show, but after seeing the lead actors debase themselves as they have, I fear many people will be loath to watch. Theyve both farblondzet many fans, including yours truly!\n\nOkay, so genug kvetching, on to some good stuff\n\nAnd speaking of lost, as you all know, we lost a television icon last month. Robert Stack, best known as Elliott Ness on the 1950s series The Untouchables and more recently, as the host of Unsolved Mysteries died of what was simply reported as natural causes at his home at the age of 84. Stack was, in private life, a warm funny, self-effacing man who used to say of his deadpan delivery, Im the only one in show business who moves his lips less than Paul Winchell! Stack also appeared to a whole new generation in the Airplane movies. Hell be missed.\n\nA great big Mazel Tov to Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones on the arrival of their daughter. And speaking of the Divine Miss J, if you havent seen her incredible performance in Chicago,\" get off your tokhes and go see it! For once, the Motion Picture Academy and I agree, Chicago was terrific, clearly the best musical since Best Little Whorehouse in Texas!\n\nAnd also, a big Mazel Tov to Matt LeBlanc and his new bride, Melissa McKnight, who were married on the island of Kauai, Hawaii last month. Many of the cast members of Friends\" were in attendance, where they made chazzers of themselves, devouring a cake that was intended for 150 people (normal people that is, these are actors!) and drank champagne. McKnight has two children by a previous marriage, but word has it that they and their new step dad are all friends. Oy, am I ashamed of that one!\n\nAnd for all you Jim Carey Fans, Bruce Almighty is a homecoming of sorts for the Man in the Rubber Mask. He finally seems to have learned that playing to the critics and academies is facacte, and now seems to have returned to the bosom of his fan-mily! Welcome Home Jim! Bruce Almighty is classic Carey, and Morgan Freeman is hysterical as God, his subtle humor contrasting perfectly with Careys manic style. This could well be Careys finest film ever!\n\nAnd this in from the Can you say hypocrite? department, Madonna has been lashing out at the great American dream, insisting that people in America need to be less worried about money, fame, celebrity, and image. Funny, but it seems to me that those are four things that pretty much define her! Oh well, maybe shes going the same way of Michael Jackson, having become so inundated by those things that shes warped her own perception of what shes all about! Go figure!\n\nThis just in from the Geritol on Tap department, word has it that John Travolta and Olivia Newton- John are going to pair up again for a sequel to the mega-hit Grease wherein they will play parents of the next generation of Greasers(?). But didnt they already do a sequel to Grease with Adrian Zmed? Or, maybe they want us to forget that! Anyway, itll be worth the $8.50 to see the almost-fifty-year-old Travolta doing those incredible dance moves! Ben Gay, anyone?\n\nAnd, in general, next month looks to be a great one for new movies as well! Several great new releases are expected, and yours truly will give you the lowdown on them.\n\nWell gang, thats a wrap! And my thanks to all of you whove taken the time to write me all those nice letters! Its very thoughtful of you all, and deeply appreciated.\n\nSee you next month!"
