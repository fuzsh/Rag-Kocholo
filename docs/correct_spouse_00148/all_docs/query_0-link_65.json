        "text": "Friends star Matt LeBlanc has said \"How you doin'?\" to marriage.\n\nThe 35-year-old actor, whose dim-witted, commitment-phobic character Joey Tribbiani on the popular NBC sitcom purrs that catchphrase to woo women, married longtime fiancee Melissa McKnight on the Hawaiian island of Kauai on Saturday.\n\nThe star-studded ceremony took place at night on a bluff overlooking exclusive Anini beach, LeBlanc's Los Angeles-based publicist, Joe Libonati, said today.\n\nLeBlanc's Friends co-stars Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Kudrow,\n\nCourteney Cox and David Schwimmer attended the event, but Matthew Perry was in London starring on stage in Sexual Perversity in Chicago.\n\nAniston's husband, Brad Pitt, and Cox's husband, David Arquette, also attended.\n\nThe couple had been engaged since 1998. It was LeBlanc's first marriage and the second for British-born McKnight, a former model who has two children from her marriage to rocker Anthony Esposito.\n\nOn Friends, LeBlanc found fame as soap-opera actor Joey Tribbiani, the blockheaded ladies' man with a passion for sports, the TV show Baywatch and homemade jam.\n\nLeBlanc's other credits include the 1996 ape comedy Ed, the 1998 sci-fi adventure Lost in Space and 2000's Charlie's Angels. He also co-stars in the upcoming sequel, Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle."
