        "text": "Matt LeBlanc and his Irish girlfriend Aurora Mulligan have reportedly ended their six-year relationship.\n\nAccording to sources close to the couple, the relationship has been over for quite some time.\n\nA spokesperson told MailOnline: ‘They haven’t been together in over a year.’\n\nSimilarly, a source said the couple ‘struck a clean break, but it’s still very raw’.\n\nThey added: ‘It’s a huge shame and Matt has taken the news particularly hard, as anyone would.\n\n‘He and Aurora fell for each on Top Gear and although there was a pretty big age gap they were a really great match.’\n\n‘But when he announced he was leaving Top Gear and took on other work, it was hard for them. He’s mainly based out of LA and was travelling a lot while Aurora was working in the UK.’\n\nThe 54-year-old Friends star met Aurora, 37, during his stint as presenter on Top Gear where she worked as a producer.\n\nThe couple were first believed to have become an item as far back as May 2016 and were spotted at the Hickstead Derby in West Sussex in June 2016.\n\nBy the following year, they were happy to pose for the cameras on the red carpet at events like the Tribeca Film Festival in New York.\n\nAurora Mulligan is from from Enniskillen, Co Fermanagh but moved to the UK when she was just 18 years old\n\nShe studied politics and political philosophy at Liverpool University before starting her career in television.\n\nShe has worked as a producer on BBC Top Gear and for Big Earth Productions – the company behind Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman’s motorcycle travel series Long Way Round and Long Way Down.\n\nShe is currently based in Los Angeles and specialises in car and motorbike related shows.\n\nLeBlanc was previously married to British model Melissa McKnight for three years, with whom he has a daughter, Marina."
