The actor, who spent 10 years as the popular Friends character, stayed out of the limelight a bit after the iconic show ended – largely so he could take on the role of dad to his daughter. He and his ex-wife, model Melissa McKnight, welcomed their daughter Marina in 2004 but split up soon after. Matt has refrained from sharing too much about his little girl, but here’s what we know about their sweet father-daughter bond.\n\nRelated: Coco Arquette Is the Spitting Image of Her Famous Mom, Courteney Cox\n\nMarina Pearl LeBlanc\n\nMarina Pearl LeBlanc was born Feb. 8, 2004. She is Matt LeBlanc’s only daughter with ex-wife Melissa McKnight. Before she was even a year old, Marina was diagnosed with cortical dysplasia. She often had seizures as a baby but the dysplasia corrected itself while she was still a toddler. Matt shares custody of Marina with his ex-wife and is extremely close with his daughter. He told the Telegraph in 2014, “She’s a daddy’s girl. She can wrap me around her little finger. I’m powerless.”"
