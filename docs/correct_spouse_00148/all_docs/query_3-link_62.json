        "text": "Matt LeBlanc has been single for quite some time after quietly splitting from his longtime girlfriend a year ago.\n\nThe Friends actor, who famously played Joey Tribbiani in the hit sitcom, had been in a relationship with Top Gear producer Aurora Mulligan for nearly six years.\n\nHowever, an insider said the couple mutually decided to separate last year.\n\nA rep confirmed the split to the Mail Online, stating: ‘They haven’t been together in over a year.’\n\nA source also told The Sun: ‘Matt and Aurora’s relationship has run its course. It’s all over.\n\n‘It’s a huge shame and Matt has taken the news particularly hard, as anyone would.\n\n‘He and Aurora fell for each [other] on Top Gear and although there was a pretty big age gap they were a really great match.’\n\nAccording to the insider, when Matt announced he was leaving Top Gear and sought other work opportunities, it took a toll on their relationship as he is primarily based in Los Angeles and travels a lot, while Aurora works in the UK.\n\nMatt, 54, and Aurora, 36, were first romantically linked in May 2016 when eyewitnesses said they looked ‘besotted’ with one another when they attended the Hickstead Derby in West Sussex.\n\nThey then made their red carpet debut as a couple at the New York Film Festival in 2017, before attending the launch of the new Top Gear series together in 2018.\n\nPrior to Aurora, the TV actor was married to British model Melissa McKnight and they share a daughter, Marina.\n\nMatt was last pictured out and about over the weekend, visiting a car body shop in LA.\n\nThe Episodes actor is rarely seen in public but stepped out to visit a body shop in Sherman Oaks, where he was seen looking relaxed and smiling.\n\nMatt dressed down for the occasion, wearing a casual pair of sweatpants, trainers and a T-shirt fit for the occasion, reading: ‘Genuine Ford parts’. Trying to go incognito, Matt wore sunglasses as well as a baseball cap, and was seen smiling as he walked between the cars.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Kanye West spends quality time with children North and Saint at Super Bowl after almighty Pete Davidson rant"
