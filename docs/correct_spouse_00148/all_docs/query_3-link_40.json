        "text": "Matt LeBlanc has probably not had much need to use Joey's Tribbiani's popular pickup line 'How you doin', for while. The actor is in a rather serious relationship with Aurora Mulligan, since 2016. The happy space that the actor has found himself in with Mulligan was much needed, as the actor both personally and professionally struggled after 'Friends' came to an end.\n\nHe and his wife, British model Melissa McKnight divorced in 2006 and LeBlanc also had to endure his baby daughter suffering terrible seizures due to a neurological condition dysplasia. Besides this, LeBlanc was increasingly getting stuck in a professional rut, as the world of show business couldn't see beyond his character Joey. It was then that LeBlanc started to look for opportunities across the pond, which led not just to the sitcom 'Episodes' which was an Anglo-US sitcom, but also led to LeBlanc hosting BBC2's Top Gear which is where he met his current lady love, a former producer on BBC's 'Top Gear'.\n\nRELATED ARTICLES\n\n'Friends: The Reunion': Air time, how to live stream and all you need to know about sitcom's special episode\n\n'Friends' star Matt LeBlanc recalls moment when a kid on the street thought he was Joey's dad\n\nWho is Matt LeBlanc dating?\n\nLeBlanc is currently dating Mulligan, a former producer on BBC's 'Top Gear'. Mulligan who hails from Northern Ireland was a political science student before she turned producer. LeBlanc even addressed living with Mulligan on the Graham Norton show in 2018. When asked where he was living, Le Blanc sheepishly replied, \"It's half and half. I have a flat here with my girlfriend but my home is in LA. I spend a lot of time here so I have to kind of like it!' Prior to landing a job at the BBC in 2015, Mulligan worked at both ITV and Channel 5. She even made a cameo in Top Gear when she played a bride whose wedding at St Paul’s cathedral was crashed by LeBlanc. An insider told The Sun at the time: “They were very tactile and Matt seemed to be very taken by Aurora as he laughed chatted intimately with her. Aurora just kept laughing at all his jokes and is clearly besotted with the American superstar.\"\n\nWhile LeBlanc may have quit 'Top Gear' in 2018, his relationship with Mulligan seems to have revved ahead. Aurora is seventeen years younger than LeBlanc, but neither the age gap or the fact that their home bases are on two different continents seems to have come in the way of their romance. As per the Daily Mail in 2019, Mulligan now works as an Executive Director of Sports and Documentaries at Pilgrim Studios and the couple have been spotted on low-key dates around LA.\n\nMatt Le Blanc's previous relationships\n\nBefore marrying Melissa McKnight, one of LeBlanc's most high-profile relationships was with 'Almost Famous' actress Kate Hudson when she was just seventeen years old. The relationship however lasted for just a year. LeBlanc then went on to marry McKnight and it was after the breakdown of their marriage that he seemed to find his longest term relationship till date. LeBlanc began dating Andrea Anders, his 'Joey' co-star around the time that Le Blanc was separating from his wife. LeBlanc dated Anders for almost ten years from 2005-2014. The two finally called in quits, in the midst of rumors that LeBlanc was flirting with several other women. It was also reports of infidelity that led to LeBlanc's marriage with McKnight breaking down.\n\nHowever, it seems that LeBlanc at least for the moment seems to have chosen to learn from his past mistakes. It is due to the stability that he finally seems to have found with Aurora as well as his children, including his daughter Marina and his two step children, that forms a big part of why when anyone asks LeBlanc 'How You doin' these days, the answer appears to be just fine.\n\nTo catch Matt LeBlanc with his old friends, tune into 'Friends: The Reunion' on HBO Max on May 27."
