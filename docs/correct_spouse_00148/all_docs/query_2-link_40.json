        "text": "As Joey Tribbiani on Friends, Matt LeBlanc was the ultimate ladies’ man, leaving women all over New York swooning as he uttered his famous catchphrase, “How you doin’?”\n\nThe 54-year-old actor was popular with women off-screen too, with rumoured flings with the likes of Jennifer Aniston, porn star Jenna Jameson, a teenage Kate Hudson and British actress Minnie Driver, The Sun reports.\n\nThe actor split from his Top Gear producer girlfriend of six years, Aurora Mulligan – who is 17 years his junior — this week.\n\nLast year the “besotted” couple appeared to be going strong, with Matt telling Graham Norton they were living together in London.\n\nHe said: “It’s half and half. I have a flat here with my girlfriend, but my home is in LA.”\n\nStream more entertainment news live & on demand with Flash, a dedicated news streaming service. New to Flash?

He takes his time to woo you and seduce you.\n\n“He would run me huge, deep baths and gently massage every inch of me with oil. Or we would have long, steamy showers together.\n\n“Matt loves making love and he’s the best. When he focuses those big, dark eyes on you, it makes you feel like his entire universe revolves around you.”\n\n“I’ve got an English friend who told me he should be called Matt LeBonk. When she explained it to me and I told him, he cracked up. He thought it was hysterical.”\n\nTonya recalled how she and Matt would have sex “marathons”, making love up to four times a night, and would romp on the beach so often that they had a “favourite cave” which had ”amazing acoustics”.\n\nDates with teenage Kate Hudson\n\nAround the same time he was dating Tonya, Matt, then 28, was spotted in a bar kissing Kate Hudson – who was then 17 years old.\n\nNeither have ever confirmed or denied anything happened between them.\n\n‘Grossed out’ Real Housewives star\n\nReal Housewives of Beverly Hills star Brandi Glanville has said she once dated Matt – but was “too grossed out” to kiss him because he let his dog lick his ice cream.\n\nOn Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen, she said: “It was disgusting.\n\n“I’m not going to kiss you after you lick your ice cream and feed it to your dog. I was like, 20, by the way.”\n\nIn fact, Brandi was so put off, she went on to date Matt’s Friends co-star David Schwimmer for three months instead!\n\nRumoured fling with Jennifer Aniston\n\nMatt and his dad Paul don’t appear to have a good relationship – with things going sour when Paul claimed his son had been secretly “making out” with his Friends co-star Jennifer Aniston.\n\nBoth vehemently denied claims of an on-set fling, but Paul insisted Matt had boasted about snogging Jen.\n\n“He even had a relationship with one of the girls … Jen,” Paul told OK! USA.\n\n“[Matt] got on good with Jen. He told me about it – they would make out in the dressing room.“\n\nBut Jen’s publicist hit back: “Jennifer has never had a romantic or sexual relationship with Matt LeBlanc.”\n\nSudden split\n\nAfter a string of short-lived relationships in the 90s, Matt seemed to have found “the one” with model Melissa McKnight.\n\nThe two were introduced by Lou Diamond Phillips’ then-wife Kelly, and after just one year of dating he popped the question, and they wed in Hawaii in 2003.\n\nThey welcomed their daughter Marina, now 18, the following year.\n\nThe couple faced every parent’s worst nightmare when Marina was diagnosed with a rare brain disorder called cortical dysplasia at eight months old. Luckily, with treatment, she made a full recovery.\n\nBut the couple’s marriage didn’t fare as well, allegedly due to Matt’s womanising ways.\n\nWhen they split it’s reported he abruptly moved out of the family home.\n\n“It was very sudden,” a friend of Lou’s told People at the time.\n\n“She was absolutely blindsided by what transpired.”\n\nCheated with lapdancer\n\nMatt later admitted an encounter with Canadian lapdancer Stephanie Stephens in 2005 was partly what led to the end of his three-year marriage.\n\nMatt told the National Enquirer that a strip club was “not where a family man should be”, but went on to claim the dancer was partially to blame.\n\n“She was in my face, pushing her breasts into me and grabbing my hands to go all over her body,” he said.\n\n“She was telling me to caress her, and in my head I’m thinking, ‘What’s going on?’”\n\nJoey co-star relationship\n\nMatt later dated his Joey co-star Andrea Anders, who played his onscreen love interest in the spin-off show.\n\nIronically she went on to play Friends star Matthew Perry’s love interest on the short-lived TV series Mr. Sunshine.\n\n“Isn’t that neat?” she joked at the time.\n\n“I’m just going to slowly work my way through the cast of Friends, although I can’t get Jennifer Aniston to return my calls.”\n\nThey seemed happy throughout their eight-year relationship, but split in 2015 after Matt was allegedly seen cheating on her during a Halloween party in Austin, Texas.\n\nDumped over text\n\nSeveral women claimed to have flings with Matt, including actress Holly Magrath, who says she met him in 2010 when she was an extra in Episodes.\n\nShe claimed their tryst lasted three weeks, and that Matt plied her with Champagne, confessed he had a girlfriend but told her it was “on-off” and that Holly was his perfect woman.\n\nThe pair reportedly spent two nights together in his hotel suite and exchanged dozens of text messages over a week before meeting again for a third liaison.\n\nAccording to Holly, Matt called time on their relationship in a text message which read: “I can’t see you anymore. Too much drama for me.”\n\nShe told the Daily Mail: “Matt is an incredible guy. He was lovely, very grounded and very normal. There’s a sincerity and warmth to him and he would stare into my eyes for hours.\n\n“But after flattering me constantly, he stopped answering my texts and didn’t keep arrangements to meet. I was annoyed when he called things off but not heartbroken. I knew he was only in London for a short time.”"
