        "text": "Joey is following fellow former “Friend” Rachel to divorce court.\n\nMatt LeBlanc, who played clueless hunk Joey Tribbiani on the long-running hit TV sitcom “Friends,” is splitting with his wife of three years, former lingerie model Melissa “Missy” McKnight.\n\nThe 38-year-old actor and McKnight, 41, were filing for divorce yesterday in Los Angeles Superior Court amid rumors of another pending cancellation in LeBlanc’s life, that of his “Friends” spin-off series “Joey.”\n\nThe two reportedly separated in January – five months after TV’s lovable lunk publicly apologized to his wife for drunkenly groping a stripper at an all-nude club while vacationing with five buddies in British Columbia.\n\nAn NBC spokesman confirmed the uncoupling in a statement:\n\n“Melissa and Matt LeBlanc have decided to end their marriage of three years. The dissolution is amicable. They remain devoted parents and friends.”\n\nHe added, “For the sake of their family, they ask that their privacy be respected at this time.”\n\nAs for the fate of “Joey,” the spokesman acknowledged that “The show’s not on the schedule for next fall right now” but added, “It has not been canceled.”\n\nThe planned divorce is the second split to hit the “Friends” cast in the past year.\n\nJennifer Aniston, who played Rachel on the sitcom, divorced studly husband Brad Pitt last year after he abandoned her for his “Mr. and Mrs. Smith” co-star Angelina Jolie. Their $60 million divorce settlement was just finalized last month.\n\nLeBlanc, who had a reputation as a womanizing party animal, met McKnight in 1997. They were introduced by actor Lou Diamond Phillips and his wife, Kelly.\n\nThey became engaged the following year, and exchanged vows five years later in a magical twilight ceremony on an oceanfront bluff in Kauai, Hawaii, with “Friends” buddies Aniston, Courteney Cox and Lisa Kudrow among the guests.\n\nServing as attendants at the nuptials were McKnight’s children from her previous marriage to rocker Anthony Esposito – son Tyler, now 12, and daughter, Jacqueline, now 10.\n\nThe couple settled down in LeBlanc’s ranch in Encino – not next door but within miles of “Friends” co-stars’ Aniston, Kudrow and Matthew Perry in Beverly Hills; Cox in Malibu, and David Schwimmer in Hollywood.\n\nLeBlanc happily took on the role of stepdad to Tyler and Jacqueline.\n\n“He’s amazing with the kids,” a friend told People magazine. “He’s like a big kid himself, so they have a great time together.”\n\nTwo years ago the LeBlancs had a daughter, Marina.\n\nShe was born with cortica dysplasia, a rare brain disorder that causes seizures.\n\nThe condition also affected the toddler’s vocal cords and her ability to crawl and walk.\n\nLeBlanc and McKnight were devastated.\n\nNoted one friend, “Dealing with her illness has been very tough on them.”"
