        "text": "#10: Matt LeBlanc\n\nUnlike Joey Tribbiani, LeBlanc did find a nice girl and settled down - well, for a few years at least. Matt was introduced to model Melissa McKnight in 1997, he proposed in 1998, they were married in 2003, had a daughter in 2004, and divorced in 2006. The couple went through some scary times when their daughter, Marina Pearl LeBlanc, started having seizures when she was very young. And at 11 months old, doctors diagnosed her with cortical dysplasia, which affects the brain, bones, and motor skills. However, thankfully by the time Marina was two years old, the seizures had pretty much stopped and she has grown out of it.\n\n#9: Charlie Heaton\n\nWhat many “Stranger Things” fans know is that Heaton has been dating his beautiful co-star Natalia Dyer since 2016. And no, we aren’t here to shock you with the news that he and Dyer have a kid together. Because they don’t. However, we are going to shock you with the news that Charlie does have a son with his former girlfriend, singer and drummer Akiko Matsuura. Their son, Archie Heaton Matsuura, was born in 2014. Since the couple parted ways, Archie has been living with his mother. However, there are no custody boundaries and Charlie is able to see his son whenever he wants.\n\n#8: James Marsden\n\nDuring the first decade of the 21st Century, you were watching Marsden on screen in “The Notebook,” “27 Dresses,” and the “X-Men” films. Off-screen, James was having a couple kids with his wife of eleven years, Lisa Linde. Their son Jack was born in 2001 and their daughter Mary was born in 2005. Marsden and Linde split in 2011. Following the divorce, Marsden had a fling with Brazilian model Rose Costa, with whom he had a third child. Their son, William Luca Costa-Marsden was born in 2012.\n\n#7: Idris Elba\n\nKnown for his roles on “Luther” and “The Wire,” Idris Elba has been married three times and has two kids. He had his first child with his first wife, Hanne \"Kim\" Nørgaard. The couple was married from 1999 to 2003 and their daughter Isan was born in 2002. Elba was married again for four months in 2006 and most recently married his current wife in 2019. However, he had his second child in the time between marriage two and three, with his ex-girlfriend, Naiyana Garth. Their son, Winston, was born in 2014.\n\n#6: Hugh Grant\n\nYou may not be surprised to know that Grant has kids. But it may surprise you to know that he has five kids, with two different women, neither of which is Elizabeth Hurley. Grant had his first kid in 2011 with a woman named Tinglan Hong. Their affair was brief and in 2012, the “About a Boy” star had a boy with Swedish TV producer Anna Eberstein. Also in 2012, Hugh had a brief reunion with Hong, which led to his 3rd child being born in December. Now back to Eberstein, who had Grant’s 4th child in 2015 and his 5th in 2018. Also in 2018, Grant put a ring on it and married the mother of three of his kids, Eberstein.\n\n#5: Scarlett Johansson\n\nJohansson has had several highly publicized romances dating all the way back to 2006 when she dated her “Balck Dahlia” co-star Josh Hartnett for two years. Probably most famously she dated and married Hollywood hunk Ryan Reynolds, but that marriage ended in divorce after a couple of years. And she is now married to “Saturday Night Live” Weekend Update co-anchor, Colin Jost. So, which one did she have her kid with? None of them. Between Reynolds and Jost, Scarlett dated and married French adman Romain Dauriac, with whom she had her daughter, Rose Dorothy Dauriac in 2014.\n\n#4: Louis Tomlinson\n\nWhen it comes to One Direction, we know there are hardcore fans that know everything there is to know about the band and each of the guys. So, telling Directioners that Louis has a kid or that Liam Payne also has a child, won’t come as a surprise at all. But to the rest of us casual fans, it might be something you didn’t know. Tomlinson’s son, Freddie Reign, was born in 2016. And the following year, ex-bandmate Payne welcomed his son, Bear Grey Payne, into the world.\n\n#3: Alexis Bledel\n\nWhile there are many “Gilmore Girls” fans out there who would love to hear that Bledel had a baby with Milo Ventimiglia, she didn’t. The two did date, but that relationship ended in 2006 - 9 years (not months) prior to the birth of Bledel’s baby. In 2012, Alexis had a guest-starring role on “Mad Men” and it was there that she shared some steamy scenes with her future husband, Vincent Kartheiser. They have been a very private couple and even when they had their first child in fall 2015, the news was not made public until May of the following year.\n\n#2: Nicholas Hoult\n\nFor almost five years, Hoult dated Hollywood megastar Jennifer Lawrence, whom he met on the set of their film “X-Men: First Class.” Beast and Mystique broke up in 2014 and three years later, the British actor started dating model Bryana Holly. Maybe it was in response to how public his relationship had been with Lawrence, but with Bryana, the couple has been much more private. They were barely seen together on each other’s social media feeds and went years without officially confirming they were a couple. Also, when they had their child, they kept the kid out of public view, off social media, and refused to confirm a name or gender for over a year. We now know they had a son, Joaquin.\n\nBefore we unveil our top pick, here are a few honorable mentions.\n\nHeather Morris\n\nShe Was Gleeful About the Birth of Both Her Sons, Elijah & Owen\n\nTom Hardy\n\nTough Guy Actor Has 3 Kids, 2 with His Wife, Actress Charlotte Riley\n\nLeighton Meester\n\nFormer “Gossip Girl” Star Has 2 Kids with Her Husband, Actor Adam Brody\n\nPete Wentz\n\nFall Out Boy Has 1 Child with Ex-Wife Ashlee Simpson & 2 with His Girlfriend\n\nLauren Conrad\n\nHas Founded 2 Fashion Lines, Published 9 Books, & Birthed 2 Children\n\n#1: Cate Blanchett\n\nBlanchett has been married for 23 years. That’s longer than anyone else on our list. She has seven Academy Award nominations, which is also more than anyone else on the list. And she has more kids than any of them as well, with four. Blanchett has played Queen Elizabeth, Galadriel. and Katharine Hepburn, all while also playing the role of mother. Cate and her husband, Andrew Upton, welcomed their first son, Dashiell, into the world in 2001, Roman in 2004, and Ignatius in 2008. After giving birth to three children, the couple did something they had been wanting to do for a long time. In 2015, they adopted a child. Their daughter, Edith."
