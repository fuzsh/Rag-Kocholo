        "text": "He admitted: “The stress of the show not working took its toll on me, it took its toll on my marriage.\n\n“My marriage was maybe doomed anyway, I don’t know. My daughter was diagnosed with a problem with her head and we had a nanny who sold the story about her to the papers. It was a very dark period.\n\n“But I got through it. Don’t they say what doesn’t kill us only makes us stronger?”\n\nMatt – who remains on good terms with Melissa – shares equal custody of Marina and decided to take a five-year gap out of public life following the end of ‘Joey’ so he could spend more time with his daughter.\n\nHe explained to Seven magazine: “I was so burnt out after Joey, I just didn’t want to work. I wanted to not have a schedule, not be somewhere. And I was in a position where I could do that.\n\n“I wanted to spend time with my daughter. She is the most important thing in my life, and spending time with her as the best thing I have ever done.”"
