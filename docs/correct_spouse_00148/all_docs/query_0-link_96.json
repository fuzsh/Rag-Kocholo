In the 60s my grandma was staying in a hotel and always took her dog everywhere. The salad dresser stopped her on the stairs one day to say \"What beautiful eyes your dog has.\" It always made us laugh when he was saving the souls from the fire in that movie and my grandma would pipe up \"Lovely man and he thought our Cookie had beautiful eyes\".\n\n0\n\ndiddlypi wrote:\n\nThere is a VERY long running lavender marriage that is one of the most famous in Hollywood.\n\nA certain blue eyed hustler who like dressing salads & his \"wife\" who could be The Equalizers sister.\n\nI am sorry I just can't believe that ,if thats true then I am not sure I can even believe the sun rises in the east ::: runs away sobbing ::::\n\n0\n\nAhh...sorry to spoil you illusions.\n\nWhilst filming he is said to have had an affair with the small closeted A lister. You know the one i mean, the one who has just \"fathered\" a child.\n\nFayecorgasm wrote:\n\nI am sorry I just can't believe that ,if thats true then I am not sure I can even believe the sun rises in the east ::: runs away sobbing ::::\n\n0\n\nashley85 wrote:\n\nReese Witherspoon and Ryan Phillipe\n\nTo slightly contradict myself but isn’t he ^ known/rumoured/alleged etc to have previously been, hmm how do I put this, a high class r****** before he made it as an actor?!\n\nAnd maybe the lavender marriage rumours come from this but that doesn’t necessarily make him not straight?

It would be impossible to keep it a secret all these years...think rumours start when very handsome men marry girls who are more homely looking..but they have had one of the strongest marriages in showbiz (30+ years?) - something would have come out by now.....surely?!\n\n0\n\nkz_91 wrote:\n\nbut isn’t he ^ alleged etc to have previously been, hmm how do I put this, a high class ******* before he made it as an actor?!\n\nAnd maybe the lavender marriage rumours come from this but that doesn’t necessarily make him not straight?

If I felt like it, I could decide to post that Richard and Judy were in a lavender marriage. It wouldn't be true - I would have completely made it up - but people would read it, some might believe it, and suddenly a rumour would have started.\n\n0\n\nlulu g wrote:\n\nI don't believe it either.
