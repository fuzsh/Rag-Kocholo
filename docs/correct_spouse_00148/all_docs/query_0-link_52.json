        "text": "Melissa McKnight is an English actress and model. She is the ex-wife of famous actor Matt LeBlanc. Though she is English by birth, she moved to America at a very young age and acquired dual citizenship. She started her career as a model and was featured in many beauty campaigns and magazines as a cover girl before stepping into the film industry. She made her debut in 2001 with the movie Triangles and Tribulations. Already a popular actress and model, she gained even more fame following her marriage to Friends star Matt LeBlanc. Before him, she had been married to Anthony Esposito, with whom she had two children before divorcing. She met Matt LeBlanc in 1997 through a mutual friend and after dating for one year, LeBlanc proposed to her. The couple finally tied the knot in May 2003 in Hawaii. After one year, the duo welcomed their daughter, Marina Pearl LeBlanc. Her marriage with LeBlanc ended in 2006, primarily due to his repetitive infidelity. As of now, she is reportedly single."
