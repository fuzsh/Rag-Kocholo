        "text": "After a little more than three years of marriage, Matt LeBlanc’s divorce has been finalized. LeBlanc and wife Melissa are agreeing to equal custody of their 2-year-old daughter, Marina.\n\nAs a former member of the well-paid “Friends” cast, LeBlanc is considered the high-wage earner between him and his wife. As such, the court has ruled he’s responsible for their daughter’s education, nanny and more. Plus, he’ll pay $15,000 a month in child support.\n\nThe Web site TMZ.com stated the couple have a confidential pre-nuptial agreement. Melissa LeBlanc is waiving spousal support, and instead is getting cash."
