        "text": "The Friends reunion aired last week and we seriously haven't been able to stop talking about it since.\n\nNot only did we learn some brand new information - like David Schwimmer didn't get along too well with Marcel the monkey - we also found out that Ross and Rachel had a crush on each other in real-life. And OH. MY. GOD. someone make this happen.\n\n\"In the first season we… I had a major crush on Jen,\" said Schwimmer, before Aniston added that it was \"reciprocated\".\n\n\"I think we both, at some point, we both were crushing hard on each other,\" he continued. \"But it was like two ships passing, because one of us was always in a relationship and we never crossed that boundary. You know, we respected that.\"\n\nWatch the trailer for Friends: The Reunion. Post continues below.\n\nVideo via HBO Max.\n\n\"I remember saying one time to David, 'It's going to be such a bummer if the first time you and I actually kiss is going to be on national television',\" said Aniston.\n\n\"Sure enough, the first time we kissed was in that coffee shop. So we just channelled all of our adoration and love for each other into Ross and Rachel.\"\n\nAt this stage, it looks like both Schwimmer and Aniston might both be single. So a possible Ross and Rachel reunion might be on the cards...\n\nBut in the meantime, while we keep our fingers (and toes) crossed, here's who the other Friends cast are currently dating.\n\nWho is Matthew Perry dating?\n\nLess than a week after the Friends reunion, Matthew Perry has announced his split from his 29-year-old fiancée Molly Hurwtiz.\n\nThe 51-year-old confirmed the news in a statement to People, saying \"Sometimes things just don't work out and this is one of them\".\n\n\"I wish Molly the best.\"\n\nThe pair, who started dating in 2018, just got engaged in November last year.\n\n\"I decided to get engaged. Luckily, I happened to be dating the greatest woman on the face of the planet at this time,\" Perry told People.\n\nThe news comes after a TikTok user shared a very awkward video call she had with Matthew Perry after matching with him on the Raya, last month.\n\nIn the now-viral video, TikTok user @kittynichole shared footage of Perry flirting with her during a FaceTime call after they met on the exclusive dating app.\n\n\"When you match with Matthew Perry as a joke on a dating app and he FaceTimes you and plays 20 questions with you,\" she wrote at the start of the video, which appears to have been removed from her account.\n\nThe pair wed three years later in 2010, before welcoming a daughter named Cleo.\n\nAlas, after seven years of marriage they decided to split.\n\nWho is Lisa Kudrow dating?\n\nLisa Kudrow met her 'lobster' quite early on in life.\n\nThe actress first laid eyes on her husband, Michel Stern, when he started dating her roommate back in 1987.\n\n\"They went out for two-and-a-half months,\" she told the Daily Mail in 2015.\n\n\"Six years later I met him again at her [the roommate's] birthday party and we just never stopped.\"\n\nThe couple went on to marry in 1995 before welcoming their son, Julian, (who is now 23) three years later.\n\nInterestingly, Kudrow's pregnancy was written into the fourth season of Friends when Phoebe was pregnant with her brother's triplets.\n\nAlmost 26 years later, Kudrow and Stern are still happily married.\n\n\"When [Michel and I] decided to get married, we understood: We're not promising to love each other forever, because you can't do that, but we are promising to work on whatever problems come up,\" she told Glamour in 2014.\n\n\"[Marriage] is like being on a team. Each teammate is different, but you have the same goal.\""
