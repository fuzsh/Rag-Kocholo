        "text": "Matt LeBlanc\n\nAmerican actor\n\nMatt LeBlanc (born July 25, 1967, Newton, Massachusetts, U.S.) is an American actor best known for playing the dim-witted but lovable ladies’ man Joey Tribbiani on the hit TV show Friends (1994–2004).\n\nEarly life\n\nLeBlanc was born in Newton, Massachusetts, near Boston, to Patricia (née Di Cillo) LeBlanc, an office manager, and Paul LeBlanc, a mechanic. The couple divorced in 1974, and Matt LeBlanc saw his father infrequently while growing up. After graduating from high school in 1985, he attended the Wentworth Institute of Technology in Boston, studying building construction management with the goal of becoming a carpenter. However, he dropped out during his freshman year.\n\nActing career\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nThat ’90s Quiz\n\nLeBlanc subsequently moved to New York City to pursue an acting career. While auditioning for roles, he also modeled. His first acting job was in a public service announcement about the U.S. Constitution, for which he earned $300. He began taking acting classes, and in 1987 he starred in a TV commercial for Heinz ketchup. He also was featured in ads for Levi’s 501 jeans, Doritos, and Coca-Cola.\n\nIn 1988 LeBlanc appeared in his first television show, TV 101, a high-school drama that he later described as similar to Beverly Hills, 90210. After the show was canceled in 1989, LeBlanc landed guest roles on such shows as Just the Ten of Us and Married…with Children. His character on the latter program, the boneheaded Vinnie Verducci, later appeared in the spinoff series Top of the Heap (1991), which was reworked as Vinnie & Bobby (1992). However, it was canceled after seven episodes.\n\nIn 1993 LeBlanc appeared in his first feature film, Grey Knight, about possessed soldiers in the American Civil War. He also was cast in music videos, including Bon Jovi’s “Miracle” (1990), Tom Petty’s “Into the Great Wide Open” (1991), Alanis Morissette’s “Walk Away” (1991), and Bob Seger’s “Night Moves” (1994).\n\nFriends\n\nLeBlanc’s breakthrough came with the career-defining role of Joey Tribbiani in Friends. The character is a struggling actor who rooms with Chandler Bing (played by Matthew Perry). Known as a ladies’ man, Tribbiani often flirts using the line “How you doin’?,” which became his catchphrase. Other cast members included Courteney Cox, Jennifer Aniston, David Schwimmer, and Lisa Kudrow, all of whom played young adults living in New York City’s Greenwich Village. The sitcom debuted in 1994 and became wildly popular, transforming the largely unknown cast into international stars. By the last two seasons, LeBlanc and his costars earned $1 million per episode. The show’s 2004 finale drew an audience of more than 52 million viewers. In 2021 the Friends cast reunited for a TV special in which they discussed the show.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

He also has said that he has no problem being primarily associated with Friends. In 2017 he told The New York Times:\n\nI’m very proud of that show. I don’t feel the need to put it behind me. And I don’t think any of us will ever be able to escape it. But I also don’t see why we should try to. That’s something that new generations discover every year, and it’s on all the time all over the world and it makes people laugh and it’s brought people a lot of joy. It’s a positive thing.\n\nWhile on Friends, LeBlanc sought to establish a film career. He starred in Ed (1996), a family comedy about a chimpanzee who plays baseball, and had a major role in Lost in Space (1998), a sci-fi action film inspired by the 1960s television show of the same name. Neither movie was a hit, but LeBlanc had more success with a supporting role in the film adaptation of another TV show, Charlie’s Angels (2000); he returned for Charlie’s Angels: Full Throttle (2003). Both performed well at the box office.\n\nDuring this time, in 2003, LeBlanc married model Melissa McKnight, and the following year the couple had a daughter, Marina. McKnight also had two children from a previous relationship.\n\nLater credits: Joey, Episodes, and Top Gear\n\nShortly after Friends ended, LeBlanc reprised his role in the spinoff Joey, in which Tribbiani moves to Hollywood to pursue his acting career. Although widely expected to be a hit, the show failed to find an audience, and it was canceled in 2006. LeBlanc subsequently told his agent to hold inquiries, and he wound up taking several years off from acting. In addition to his being burned out, he and McKnight divorced in 2006, and he wanted to be able to spend more time with their daughter Marina, who was recovering from a rare medical condition.\n\nLeBlanc’s self-imposed exile ended with Episodes (2011–17), a Showtime comedy created by Jeffrey Klarik and David Crane, the latter of whom helped develop Friends. In the show, LeBlanc plays a fictionalized (and obnoxious) version of himself. Episodes was a hit with critics and TV viewers, and LeBlanc won a Golden Globe in 2012. During this time he also starred in the sitcom Man with a Plan (2016–20), about a father who assumes much of the parenting responsibilities when his wife returns to work.\n\nLeBlanc is a self-described “car nut,” and in 2016 he became the first non-British host of the car show Top Gear, following several guest appearances. He left the program in 2019. LeBlanc is also a motorcycle aficionado, and in 2003 he hosted the miniseries The 5 Coolest Things, in which he interviewed and rode with competitive motorcyclists."
