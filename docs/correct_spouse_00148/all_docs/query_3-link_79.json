        "text": "AS Friends flatmates Chandler and Joey, actors Matthew Perry and Matt LeBlanc enjoyed a bromance that charmed the world. But when the cameras stopped rolling their lives were anything but perfect, as fame brought a host of problems.\n\nWith HBO Max shelling out millions to reunite the sitcom’s six stars for a one-off special, GEORGINA DUVAL tells how Matt and Matthew – plus co-stars Lisa Kudrow and David Schwimmer – have struggled away from Central Perk.\n\nMatt LeBlanc\n\nIN contrast to the happy-go-lucky nature of his character Joey Tribbiani, Matt hasn’t found life easy after Friends.\n\nSince the sitcom ended in 2004 he has divorced, endured a bitter falling-out with his father, watched his baby daughter battle terrifying seizures and grew increasingly despondent at being typecast.\n\nExplaining how he felt when the show ended, Matt, now 52, said: “I had quit smoking and the last episode I started smoking again. It was very sad.\n\n\"It was this closing of a chapter in all of our lives that was amazing. There’s only five other people on the planet who know what that was like to have been a part of.”\n\nThe following chapter in Matt’s life proved even more challenging. In 2004, Marina – his daughter with British actress and model Melissa McKnight, 54 – was born.\n\nWithin eight months the baby began having seizures and she was diagnosed with a form of dysplasia, a neurological condition.\n\nThankfully, Marina would later recover – but Matt’s marriage was doomed. In 2006 he admitted to a “careless and irresponsible” encounter with Canadian lap dancer Stephanie Stephens.\n\nHis career was also in trouble, as industry bosses and fans struggled to see past his Friends character.\n\nThat was hardly surprising given he continued to play him in spin-off Joey, which debuted in 2004 but was cancelled midway through its second season.\n\nMatt revealed: “Because I played the sort of dimwitted dumb guy, people a lot of the time will talk to me slowly. They don’t expect me to be able to spell my name. That happens more often than you would think.”\n\nToday he laughs about it, but in 2006 Matt was so sick of being typecast he turned his back on Hollywood for several years.\n\nWhen he came back in 2011 he played a fictionalised version of himself in the Anglo-US sitcom Episodes. He then took on presenting duties of BBC2’s Top Gear.\n\nAfter some troubling times, Matt is now worth a reported £74million and is in a happy relationship with Irish former Top Gear producer Aurora Mulligan. His daughter Marina, meanwhile, is now a healthy teenager.\n\nMatt, who has been with Aurora since 2016, said: “Having kids has been great for me. I have two beautiful step-kids as well as my own new daughter. They’ve really helped me to keep my feet firmly on the ground and life is good. I feel like I’m the luckiest guy here.”\n\nWhile Matt’s relationship with his kids is great, he no longer talks to his father Paul, who left his mum when Matt was just six months old.\n\nFor a period Matt was reconciled with his dad – even buying him a six-bedroom home in the US state of Colorado and a classic Porsche car.\n\nBut their relationship fell apart when Paul sold a story about Matt to an American magazine. Matt shut his dad out of the house, made him sell the car and cut off all contact.\n\nOf his dad, he said: “He was a ladies’ man. Now he’s old. I don’t talk to him. You can learn valuable lessons from unpleasant people too.”\n\nWhile Matt cherishes his memories of Friends, he finds it difficult to re-visit it.\n\nHe said: “I have a hard time watching it these days, as it makes me feel like I am 100 years old. It seems like every year there’s a new generation that discovers it.\n\n“But now enough time has gone by that kids will come up to me and say, ‘Wow, are you Joey’s dad?’”\n\nMatthew Perry\n\nON Friends his character Chandler Bing was the witty, sarcastic one. But off-screen Matthew’s life has been no laughing matter – despite fame and an estimated £70million fortune.\n\nSince the final episode of Friends aired in 2004, Matthew has failed to truly make it in Hollywood, seen his telly series cancelled, never found lasting love and spent years in and out of rehab battling addictions to drugs and alcohol.\n\nRecently photographed looking bloated and dishevelled, Matthew’s troubles are apparently not over. Discussing his demons, the actor, now 50, revealed: “I was on Friends from age 24 to 34. I was in the white-hot flame of fame. The six of us were everywhere, all the time.\n\n\"From an outsider’s perspective it would seem like I had it all. It was actually a very lonely time for me because I was suffering from alcoholism. It was going on before Friends but it’s a progressive disease.”\n\nMatthew’s troubles worsened when he got hooked on the painkillers he had been prescribed following a jet-ski accident in 1997.\n\nDuring the ten years Friends was aired he was in rehab twice – in 1997 and 2001 – and has said he can’t remember filming THREE YEARS of the show as he was so wasted.\n\nHe said: “I was never high at work. I was painfully hungover. Eventually things got so bad I couldn’t hide it. Everybody knew.”\n\nMarta Kauffman, 63, who created the sitcom with David Crane, said of Matthew’s troubles: “We were certainly aware of some of it and we had some conversations about it. We were protective and, hopefully, supportive.”\n\nHis pal and ex-girlfriend Kayti Edwards claims Matthew tried heroin and crack cocaine and once was so high he superglued his hands to his legs.\n\nKayti, the step-granddaughter of screen royalty Julie Andrews, first met Matthew 13 years ago, when he auditioned for her grandfather, Breakfast At Tiffany’s director Blake Edwards.\n\nRecalling how Matthew demanded to experiment with harder drugs in 2011, she said: “It got to the point where Matthew was using drugs every day. It was about three months of heavy partying.”\n\nShortly afterwards he was admitted to rehab again. Then in 2013 he converted his luxury Malibu home into The Perry House, a sober-living facility for men, only for it to close in 2016 amid rumors he had fallen off the wagon again.\n\nIn 2018 he spent three months in hospital after undergoing surgery for a gastrointestinal perforation.\n\nUnsurprisingly, his career and love life have suffered. Despite saying in 2013 he believes he would “make a great dad”, Matthew has no kids.\n\nHis most recent film role was back in 2009, alongside Zac Efron in 17 Again. On telly he helped create and starred in a revival of The Odd Couple, which was cancelled in 2017 after three seasons.\n\nMatthew has dated stars including A-lister Julia Roberts, 52, and former Baywatch pin-up Yasmine Bleeth. A six-year relationship with Mean Girls actress Lizzy Caplan, 37, ended in 2012. Today he says he is more fulfilled by helping fellow addicts than being an actor.\n\nHe said: “I’ve had a lot of ups and downs in my life and a lot of wonderful accolades. But the best thing about me is that if an alcoholic comes up to me and says, ‘Will you help me stop drinking?’ I will say, ‘Yes, I know how to do that’.”\n\nLisa Kudrow\n\nBEFORE she landed the role of ditzy Phoebe Buffay, Lisa’s career was in the doldrums. She auditioned unsuccessfully for US telly institution Saturday Night Live – the launchpad for some of America’s biggest comic stars – then was axed from Cheers spin-off Frasier after the pilot.\n\nBut Friends changed all that and in 1998 Lisa became the first cast member to win an Emmy. She said: “I’d always thought fame would give you permission to lighten up on yourself. If everybody else likes you, you could finally have permission to love yourself. It’s not true.”\n\nInstead, Lisa, now 56, found happiness off-screen with a happy 24-year marriage to French ad executive Michel Stern and being a mum to Julian, 21. She said: “I made an effort to reject acting, to shove it out of my body because I didn’t want my kids to have an actress as a mother, a silly person.”\n\nNow reportedly worth £69million, Lisa was not always so confident. When first on Friends she starved herself, convinced she was fat compared to Jennifer Aniston and Courteney Cox.\n\nShe recalled: “I felt like this mountain of a woman next to them. Unfortunately, for a woman, if you’re underweight you look ‘good’. When I was too thin, I was sick all the time.”\n\nThe role didn’t come easy. She said: “I had to work hard at being Phoebe. Third season in, I was struggling so much I said, ‘I don’t think I have it, I don’t know what I’m doing’.”\n\nAfter Friends Lisa starred in movies including Analyze This, PS I Love You and Hotel For Dogs. She co-created the web series Web Therapy and appears in new Salma Hayek movie Like A Boss.\n\nLisa says she can now look back fondly on the role that made her name. She said: “Phoebe was basically a ditzy girl who lived in a happier reality than everybody else because everything was so gloomy around her.\n\n“Now, on Twitter or Facebook, I see young girls saying, ‘I identify with Phoebe because I’m different too’. That’s nice – to think people who don’t feel they fit in perfectly well can relate to that character.”\n\nDavid Schwimmer\n\nHIS ten years on Friends made David one of the most recognisable faces in showbiz. But when the show ended he made a conscious effort to step out of the limelight.\n\nSince the final episode aired in 2004, the actor, now 53, has stayed purposely under the radar, opting to live in New York and Chicago rather than Los Angeles. He also turned down Will Smith’s role in 1997 sci-fi blockbuster Men In Black, preferring to work on indie films, theatre shows and voice work.\n\nDavid, worth an estimated £66million, says his most important role is not as uptight paleontologist Ross Geller – but being a dad to daughter Cleo, eight. Talking of his career choices after the show, David said: “I just didn’t want to work so hard. I wanted to enjoy that chapter of my life.”\n\nOf celebrtity, he said: “It was pretty jarring and it messed with my relationship to other people in a way that took years for me to adjust to and become comfortable with.”\n\nFame is clearly not what motivates him. The only Hollywood events you are likely to see him at are those supporting his advocacy work. The year Friends ended he became an anti-violence spokesman on the board of directors of the Rape Foundation in Santa Monica, California.\n\nIn 2018 he appeared in That’s Harassment, six short films about male sexual misconduct in the workplace. He said: “I feel I have a duty to use my celebrity status in a positive way.”\n\nThere have been other forays into acting, including theatre. He was the voice of giraffe Melman in the Madagascar movies and was Emmy-nominated for his role as Robert Kardashian in 2016 TV hit American Crime Story: The People Vs OJ Simpson. He is now starring in new Sky One comedy Intelligence.\n\nDavid has kept his personal life private since the end of his seven-year marriage to British artist Zoe Buckman, Cleo’s mum, in 2017. The non-profit theatre group he co-founded in 1988, Chicago’s Lookingglass Theatre Co, remains a focus too.\n\nHe said: “I’ve made a good amount of money. I’m happy I can now support my theatre company, friends and family.”"
