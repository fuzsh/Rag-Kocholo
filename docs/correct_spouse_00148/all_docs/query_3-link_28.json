        "text": "Matt LeBlanc’s star-studded relationship timeline\n\nMatt LeBlanc, widely recognized for his role as Joey Tribbiani on 'Friends', evolved into the archetypal charmer, captivating women throughout New York with his signature catchphrase, \"How you doin'?\" Beyond the confines of the screen, the 54-year-old actor found himself dating a string of notable women, including Jennifer Aniston, a young Kate Hudson, and even a porn star.\n\nFling with Teri Copley\n\nIn the initial stages of his television career in 1989, LeBlanc was in a relationship with Teri Copley for approximately six months. The couple attended various events together, notably the grand opening of Manhattan West restaurant, where they were captured together in photographs.\n\nThe racy 1990s\n\nThereafter, throughout the '90s, Matt experienced a tumultuous on-and-off romance lasting three years with Playboy Playmate Tonya Poole. Around the same time, Matt, then 28 years old, was caught kissing Kate Hudson, aged 17 years old, in a club during the time he was dating Tonya. A relationship between them has never been verified or denied by either party.\n\nLeBlanc's first marriage with Melissa McKnight\n\nIn 2003, the actor exchanged vows, marrying actress Melissa McKnight, marking the beginning of their marital journey. However, their paths diverged in 2006. During their time together, the couple welcomed a daughter named Marina Pearl in 2005.\n\nDating his co-star Andrea Anders\n\nFrom 2006 to January 2015, Matt was in a relationship with his 'Joey' co-star, Andrea Anders. The 46-year-old actress, originally from Wisconsin, portrayed Alex in the spin-off show centered around the beloved 'Friends' character. Following the conclusion of their eight-year relationship, Anders pursued roles in popular shows such as 'Modern Family' and 'About A Boy'.\n\n'Possible' romantic liaison with Jennifer Aniston\n\nSpeculations arose about a possible affair between Matt and his 'Friends' co-star Jennifer Aniston after Matt's dad, Paul, asserted that his son had been discreetly \"making out\" with Jennifer Aniston. Reportedly, Paul LeBlanc disclosed that Matt and Aniston were allegedly involved before the actress' divorce from Pitt. Post these bombshell revelations, Matt's relationship with his dad grew strained and no one knew if Paul had been making up stories to get attention or if the icing out was because he had betrayed Matt's confidence.\n\nMatt LeBlanc recently split from TV producer girlfriend Aurora Mulligan"
