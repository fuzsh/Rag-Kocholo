Matt LeBlanc has filed for divorce from his wife, citing irreconcilable differences, but his publicist says the two remain “friends.”

The former “Friends” TV star filed papers in Superior Court on Thursday to dissolve his three-year marriage to his wife, Melissa LeBlanc, according to documents obtained by Entertainment Tonight. The couple separated Jan. 1.

“The dissolution is amicable. They remain devoted parents and friends,” LeBlanc’s publicist, Joe Libonati, said Thursday. “For the sake of their family, they ask that their privacy be respected at this time.”

They are seeking joint custody of their 2-year-old daughter, Marina. Melissa LeBlanc has two children from a previous marriage.

The pair married in a celebrity-studded wedding in Hawaii in 2003 that was attended by several of LeBlanc’s “Friends” co-stars.

The 38-year-old played struggling actor Joey Tribbiani in the long-running sit-com that ended its NBC run in May 2004.

LeBlanc has reprised the character in the spinoff “Joey.”
