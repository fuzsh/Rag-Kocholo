KAYSONE, LAOS PDR – 25-27 July 2014: Gathering of Local Climate Experts in Kaysone Phomvihane an International First

Local experts from Kaysone, Laos, Battambang, Cambodia, and Dong Ha, Vietnam came together 25 – 27 July 2014 to share results and combine their learning after conducting climate change impact and vulnerability assessments in their towns. The Regional Knowledge Sharing Workshop took place as part of the Climate Resilience in Cities project, ADB TA 8186.

“The event goes into the record books for a number of reasons,” says ICEM Director General Jeremy Carew-Reid. “It is the first time such large government delegations from medium sized towns in the Mekong region have come together to discuss their shared climate change challenges. It is the first time that sister towns have brought together formally recognised climate change technical advisory groups, and, to my knowledge, the first time such an important exchange between sister towns has been conducted in all three national languages.”
