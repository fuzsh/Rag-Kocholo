This project flyer presents a brief background of the challenge and the two phases of interventions supported. Both aim to facilitate the school to work transition of Kaysone’s youth and tertiary graduates so that they will have the essential skills and job application and onboarding know-how to thrive in the labor market.\n\nThe AASCTF is financed by the Australian Government through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, managed by the Asian Development Bank, and implemented by Ramboll. For the Kaysone project, Ramboll led the implementation of Phase 1 while ADB led Phase 2."
