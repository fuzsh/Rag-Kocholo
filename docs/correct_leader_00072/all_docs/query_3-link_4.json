        "text": "Kaysone Phomvihane (ໄກສອນ ພົມວິຫານ) (13 December 1920 – 21 November 1992) was the leader of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party from 1955, though Souphanouvong served in a figurehead role. He served as the first Prime Minister of the Lao People's Democratic Republic from 1975 to 1991 and then as President from 1991 until his death a year later, in 1992.\n\nBiography[]\n\nPhomvihane was born Nguyen Cai Song[1] to a Vietnamese father named Nguyen Tri Loan, and a Laotian mother named Nang Dok. He had two sisters: Nang Souvanthong, living in Thailand and Nang Kongmany in the USA.[2] He was born in Na Seng village, Khanthabouli district (now Kaysone Phomvihane District, Savannakhet Province), Laos.\n\nPhomvihane attended law school at Hanoi University in Hanoi, Vietnam, with Nouhak Phoumsavan. He dropped out of law school to fight the French colonialists who were in Vietnam. Later, he joined Lao nation, which was also fighting the French colonialists.\n\nHe became an active revolutionary while studying in the Indochinese capital of Hanoi during the 1940s. Lao People's Liberation Army (LPLA) was established by Kaysone Phomvihane on January 20, 1949. He was minister of defence of Resistance Government (of the Neo Lao Issara) the from 1950. In 1955 he was instrumental in setting up the LPRP at Sam Neua in northern Laos, and subsequently served as the Pathet Lao leader, with Souphanouvong as its figurehead. In the years which followed, he led communist forces against the Kingdom of Laos and U.S. forces. After their victory he served as Prime Minister from the founding of the Lao PDR in 1975 until 1991. He married Thongvinh Phomvihane.\n\nPhomvihane displayed expert skills in handling relations with Vietnam.[citation needed] The demarcation process started in 1977 and just finished in 2007. According to western journalist the Lao/Viet borderline is \"very close\" to the 1945 border between Laos and Tonkin and Annam, respectively.\n\nAccording to Vatthana Pholsena, assistant professor of Southeast Asian Studies at the National University of Singapore and author of the book \"Post-war Laos\", Kaysone Phomvihane was the top policy maker in LPDR, and a strongman. He created Sekong province to honour the southern minority for their support in the war effort.\n\nKaysone died in Laos's capital, Vientiane. After Kaysone's death, the government of Laos built a museum in Kaysones honour, in Vientiane, partially funded by Vietnam.[3]\n\nFamily[]\n\nHis son, Sanyahak Phomvihane, was elected to the LPRP Central Committee at the 8th LPRP Congress and became a Major General at the age of 41. However, he suffered an early death, at the age of 45, on 19 July 2013.[4]\n\nForeign honours[]\n\nThailand : Knight of the Order of Rajamitrabhorn\n\nReferences[]"
