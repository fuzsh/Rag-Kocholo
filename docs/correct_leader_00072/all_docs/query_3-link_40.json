        "text": "After a period of standing shoulder to shoulder, sharing, helping and sacrificing blood and bones to bring the cause of national liberation and reunification of each country to complete victory in 1975, Vietnam and Laos entered a new phase with many requirements and challenges of national construction and development.\n\nDeeply aware of the meaning and importance of the special relationship between Vietnam and Laos, on July 18, 1977, the two countries signed the Vietnam-Laos Treaty of Amity and Cooperation. The two sides have committed to protecting and developing the special relationship between Vietnam and Laos, constantly enhancing solidarity and mutual trust, long-term cooperation and mutual assistance, in all respects in the spirit of proletarian internationalism and on the principle of complete equality, respect for each otherâs independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, respect for each other's legitimate interests, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs.\n\nOver the past 45 years, this Treaty has become a valuable and extremely important asset, a solid legal basis for the two countries to constantly expand their special friendship and comprehensive cooperation. The treaty is also a premise for the two countries to sign a series of documents and cooperation agreements in all fields of politics, foreign affairs, security, defence, economy, trade, investment, education and training.\n\nNguyen Van Nghiep, a military expert who joined the volunteer forces to help Laos, in addition to 10 years as an assistant to Party General Secretary Kaysone Phomvihane, excitedly told us about his deep memories with Lao leaders.\n\nPresident Ho Chi Minh and President Kaysone Phomvihane\n\nâAside from work, Comrade Kaysone Phomvihane often asked me about my family and childhood. Even on things like evaluating Lao cadres, he also asked for my opinion. After transferring from the Western Department to the Central Committee for External Relations, in 1990, I retired. Comrade Kaysone said that he wanted me to stay and help him for another year, which means that I had lived and worked in Laos for 43 years. I still remember that there were occasions when Comrade Kaysone Phomvihane went on a business trip abroad. Before departing, he often held a meal with us and asked if we needed to buy anything. I often refused because I was afraid to trouble the leader. But when he returned, he gave me a shirt, a pen, or a bottle of tonic. The concern of the top leader of the Lao Peopleâs Revolutionary Party at that time for a foreign Party member and cadre like me, was a reliable and profound sentiment, making it impossible for me to forgetâ â Nguyen Van Nghiep recalled.\n\nIn the field of defence and security, the cooperation relationship between the two countries has also been continuously promoted, continuing to be one of the important pillars in the special relationship between Vietnam and Laos. The two sides have closely coordinated regularly and supported each other to ensure political stability, security, and social order and safety in each country. The two sides have completed the project of thickening and embellishing the Vietnam-Laos national landmark system; signed two important legal documents, namely the protocol on the Vietnam-Laos borderline and national border markers and the new Agreement on Border Management Regulations between Vietnam and Laos.\n\nIn addition to coordinating and organising the good implementation of signed border agreements, the two sides have also coordinated in the timely settlement of violations in border areas, jointly fought against transnational crimes, and contributed to keeping the borderline safe, maintaining a peaceful environment, with political and social stability, to build the country and defeat all plots to divide the traditional friendship and special solidarity between Vietnam and Laos.\n\nIn the last days of May, we met Major General Hoang Quang Huong at his home in Long Bien, Hanoi. As formerly Head of the Vietnam Ministry of Public Security's Representative Office in Laos, he just retired last year after finishing his working term in Laos. Having worked for many years in the country of a Million Elephants, his nostalgia for Laos is always intense, especially on the occasion of the Laotian New Year, when Lao friends who are working and studying in Vietnam come to visit him.\n\nMajor General Hoang Quang Huong said that 62 years ago, as soon as the Lao People's Public Security force was established (April 5, 1961), the Vietnamese Ministry of Public Security sent the first team of experts to Laos to help the Lao police force to carry out the work of maintaining political security, social order and safety, internal protection, suppression of reactionaries, defamation, fraud, etc. Entering the period of construction and development of Lao, the force of experts in the police of Vietnam continued to effectively advise the Lao side on the work of building the force and basic operations; thereby helping Laos to build and form a strong police force.\n\nMajor General Hoang Quang Huong speaks at an event to recall the support of Vietnamese public security experts for Laos.\n\nBased on the delegation of Vietnamese police experts in Laos, on January 21, 2005, the Representative Office of the Ministry of Public Security of Vietnam was established in Laos, to meet the assigned tasks in the new situation. As the head of the Representative Office of the Ministry of Public Security in Laos (January 2018-2021), Major General Hoang Quang Huong had the opportunity to travel to many provinces of Laos, meet, talk and feel sincere feelings of the people of Laos towards the country and people of Vietnam.\n\nIn the assigned tasks, he was extremely interested in the renovation and improvement of the quality of training cooperation between the two Public Security Ministries. Recognising the practical need for cooperation between the two police forces, Huong proposed that all levels promote the training and teaching of Vietnamese for the Lao police force. He also proposed that the Ministry of Education and Training appoint full-time Vietnamese language teachers for the Lao police force.\n\nâEvery time I attend the closing ceremony of a Vietnamese language class in the Lao Public Security Forces, I feel happy in my heart, because this is my mission and also my small contribution to make the relationship between the two countries stronger.â - Major General Hoang Quang Huong said.\n\nIn addition, Huong also suggested renewing teaching methods, as well as improving the quality of teaching and learning, organising Vietnamese language teaching for two years for each course, and selecting good and qualified students to go to practice in Vietnam. He used to directly welcome a delegation of Lao students to Vietnam, and take care of them through meals and accommodation like his own brothers.\n\nReturning to Vietnam to take up his new duties as Director of the Joint Stock Commercial Bank for Investment and Development of Vietnam (BIDV) - Hong Ha branch, Nguyen Van Binh is always full of memories of his years of working in Laos as General Director of LaoVietBank, Head of BIDV Representative Office.\n\nLaoVietBank - a joint venture of BIDV and Banque Pour Le Commerce Exterieur Lao Public (BCEL), was born with the mission of connecting the two economies of Vietnam and Laos. Step by step stabilising and developing, the bank has made many positive contributions to the implementation of economic and financial policies of Laos, serving well for Vietnam-Laos economic and trade cooperation, with its participation in major projects between the two countries, especially development and social security projects, meet the political and economic tasks in the cooperation and development plans of the two countries.\n\nLaoVietBank is considered by Lao leaders as a model in economic cooperation between Laos and Vietnam, and is not only a financial-banking institution in Vietnam's business activities in Laos but also successfully fulfils its task of being a bridge between the two economies.\n\nNguyen Van Binh speaks at an event in Vientiane, Laos.\n\nIn difficult years, it is determined that LaoVietBank needs to focus on solving difficulties for Vietnamese and Lao businesses in bilateral payment activities, providing timely capital for Vietnamese enterprises to invest in and produce in Laos, Binh and a team of Vietnamese and Lao leaders have always united and joined hands to overcome many seemingly insurmountable difficulties.\n\nThe most memorable event for him is the event related to the expense of setting up the reserve fund of BIDV. This is a valid expense, but your tax authority made a point of still imposing corporate income tax on this expense. Binh met then-Lao National Assembly Chairwoman Pany Yathotou to present and propose. After understanding the knot, she directed the Governor of the Bank of the Lao PDR Sonexay Phaysit to untie it. This issue was then brought to the Lao National Assembly for consideration and settlement following regulations, becoming a mechanism applicable to all banks. âNo matter how busy they are, the Lao leaders are always the same, always caring, understanding and helping Vietnamese businesses when facing difficulties,â Binh affirmed.\n\nBinh recalled, when he first came to Laos, knowing that he could not speak Lao, many Lao friends enthusiastically helped and taught him every word so that he could read, write and communicate fluently, helping him to be more comfortable in life and work.\n\nâMany times, my Vietnamese staff, Lao staff and I were invited by Lao National Assembly Chairwoman Pany Yathotou to her home for dinner and got encouragement from her. On the occasion of the Lao traditional New Year, we also had the opportunity to dance Lamvong and splash perfumed water to pray for good luck. On the occasion of Vietnamese traditional Tet, we were treated to banh chung and other Vietnamese New Yearâs dishes, which made us nostalgic for being away from home. There is no place where deep affection remains forever in my heart like Laos,â said Binh.\n\nIn 2021, when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out in a complicated manner in Laos, Vietnam immediately sent a delegation of the Ministry of Health and a delegation of Vietnamese military medical experts, to support Laos in epidemic prevention and control. According to Dr. Vuong Anh Duong, Deputy Director of the Department of Health Examination and Treatment Management, Head of the Mission of the Ministry of Health said, in a race against time, the mission determined that fighting the epidemic was like fighting the enemy and always remembered Uncle Ho's teaching, âhelping friends means helping ourselvesâ.\n\nThe mission's activities in many provinces and cities in Laos promptly helped to successfully solve many problems in epidemic prevention and control, leaving a deep impression in the hearts of Lao people, doctors and nurses and was acknowledged and appreciated by Lao leaders. Many COVID-19 patients who were treated by Vietnamese doctors and nurses and escaped danger, told us that from the bottom of their hearts, they are very grateful to Vietnamese doctors and nurses and do not know if they will see them again. Ms. Sophanavan Saichandee sent a thank you letter to Vietnamese doctors and nurses.\n\nâI am Sophavan Saichandee, I had COVID-19, but I was not stressed because I had medical staff and doctors who took care of me. Fortunately, there were Vietnamese doctors to help, along with the medical team, Lao doctors are also very good at treatment. Now both my 5-month-old baby and I are much better. I see that the doctors and nurses have had to sacrifice a lot of things to carry out the task of taking care of the people's health; Finally, I wish all the doctors and nurses good health, thank you all for your care and treatment; I am very happy to have recovered from COVID-19, a very complicated disease. Thank you very much- Sophavan.â\n\nThe simple and short letter from the pregnant woman with COVID-19 has encouraged us greatly. Although we want to stay longer to help patients recover, there were still many patients in need of our help, Dr. Vuong Anh Duong recalled.\n\nMany cooperation projects bearing the imprint of Vietnam-Laos friendship appear more and more effectively in the country of Champa, such as the National Assembly Building, Laos-Vietnam international port, and Unitel telecommunications joint venture, and are living proof that continues to affirm the effective and practical cooperation relationship in many fields of the two countries.\n\nIn 2022, on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations, the 45th anniversary of the signing of the Vietnam-Laos Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation, and the Year of Solidarity and Friendship between Vietnam and Laos, many meaningful activities were organised, such as âLao Cultural Week in Vietnamâ, âVietnamese Culture Week in Laosâ, a photo exhibition entitled âThe eternal and sustainable Laos-Vietnam relationsâ, a book exhibition entitled âThe great friendship and special solidarity between Vietnam-Laos, Laos-Vietnam: Imprints through each page of the book, the âStorytelling Memorabiliaâ contest, etc., along with a series of important events in the diplomatic relations between the two countries which were conducted during the year, contributing to consolidating and strengthening the great friendship, special solidarity and comprehensive cooperation between Vietnam and Laos.\n\nThe year 2023 continues to mark milestones in the history of bilateral relations. From January 11-12, 2023, Pham Minh Chinh paid an official visit to Laos for the first time in his capacity as Prime Minister, also the first visit to Laos by a foreign senior leader since Sonexay Siphandone was elected Prime Minister of Laos.\n\nThen, from April 10-11, President Vo Van Thuong and a high-ranking Vietnamese delegation paid an official visit to Laos. This is the first foreign trip of President Vo Van Thuong and Laos is the first country the President has visited in his new position. The above visits once again affirmed the consistent policy of the Party and State which always attaches great importance to and prioritises the great friendship, special solidarity and comprehensive cooperation between Vietnam and Laos.\n\nAssociate Professor Nguyen Huy Hoang\n\nTo strengthen, maintain and develop the special relationship between Vietnam - Laos, Laos - Vietnam, the two sides need to strengthen education for the younger generations of the two countries, helping them properly perceive this relationship, understand and appreciate the heroic history of the two nations and the ancestors of the two countries; understand that the special solidarity between Vietnam - Laos and Laos - Vietnam is sacred, an invaluable asset that successive generations of the two countries need to be responsible for maintaining, protecting and promoting for the sake of permanence and development of both nations.\n\nThe two countries should make every effort to create favourable conditions to encourage and strengthen people-to-people diplomatic relations, and to promote all levels, branches, localities, political, social and professional organisations, of the two countries to expand their opportunities. All while exchanging, and learning from each other's experiences; thereby, helping to consolidate, maintain, cultivate and promote good traditional relations between the two countries.\n\nXayxana Lavilay\n\nThe two countries need to strengthen cooperation in human resource development, especially building and training political, diplomatic and economic cadres to create a succession team of high-quality, suitable for the digital age; improve the organisational structure to be comprehensively strong, ensuring the fulfilment of the Partyâs political tasks in the new period.\n\nIn particular, it is necessary to attach importance to the ideological and political training for Party members, officials and employees to integrate the Party's foreign policy, especially the foundation of the great friendship and solidarity and the special ties and comprehensive cooperation between Laos and Vietnam, making political and diplomatic relations between Laos and Vietnam enhanced, cultivated, replicated and inherited, and achieving new goals in the near future.\n\nDr. Truong Duy Hoa\n\nFor investment cooperation between the two countries to be more and more effective, the Governments of the two countries need to work closely together to create a stable, open and transparent corridor to attract more investors. In addition, both sides also need to have specific mechanisms and policies for key investment projects that are leveraged in economic cooperation between the two countries.\n\nIn addition, both countries need to have mechanisms and policies to prioritise mobilising investment capital in the border economic zones of the two countries, paying more attention to projects connecting infrastructure and logistics in the border provinces. On the Vietnamese side, the Government should pay more attention to capital support, mechanisms and policies so that Vietnamese enterprises can invest in Laos. On the side of businesses, investors need to increase their understanding of the Lao market, the mechanisms, policies and laws, as well as the customs and habits of the Lao people to bring about the effectiveness of projects."
