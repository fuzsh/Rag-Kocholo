        "text": "Prince Souphanouvong (July 13, 1909 — January 9, 1995) was, along with his half-brother Prince Souvanna Phouma and Prince Boun Oum of Champasak, one of the “Three Princes” who represented respectively the communist (pro-Vietnam), neutralist, and royalist political factions in Laos. He was the figurehead President of Laos from December 1975 to August 1991.\n\nSouphanouvong was one of the sons of Prince Bounkhong, the last vice-king of Luang Prabang. Unlike his half-brothers, Souvanna Phouma and Phetsarath, whose mothers were of royal birth, his mother was a commoner, Mom Kham Ouane.\n\nEducated in France and Vietnam, he eventually became a supporter of Ho Chi Minh and joined the Indochinese communist movement. In August 1950, Souphanouvong convened the first congress of the Lao Freedom Front (Neo Lao Issara) — more generally known as the Pathet Lao – which served as the vehicle for the communist challenge to French rule. He was the chairman of the Neo Lao Issara (since 1956, Neo Lao Hak Xat) and Resistance Government.\n\nNicknamed “The Red Prince”, he became the figurehead leader of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party, and upon its successful seizure of power in 1975, he became the first President of the Lao People's Democratic Republic (and President of the Supreme People's Assembly), a position which he held until his retirement in 1986.[1] After 1986, Phoumi Vongvichit Succeeded as president, Kaysone Phomvihane succeeded as president in 1991.\n\nIn 1991, he became an Advisor of Party's Central Committee. Souphanouvong died on 12 January 1995 at the age of 86.[2]\n\nSouphanouvong spoke eight languages, including Greek and Latin. He worked on the ports of Le Havre before taking his engineering degree from the École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées.\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nSouphanouvong, \"Red Prince\" of Laos, dies aged 86\n\nSouphanouvong's photo\n\nNew York Times' obituary\n\nIndependent's obituary"
