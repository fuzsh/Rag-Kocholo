        "text": "Kaysone Phomvihan (born Dec. 13, 1920, Na Seng, Laos—died Nov. 21, 1992, Vientiane) was a Laotian political leader and revolutionary who was a communist leader from 1955 and, following the overthrow of the 600-year-old monarchy (1975), ruler of Laos.\n\nKaysone was born in southern Laos of a Lao mother and a Vietnamese father, a civil servant in the French colonial government. Kaysone protested against Japanese occupation of his country during World War II, and while studying law at the University of Hanoi, he became involved with the nascent Indochinese Communist Party. He was sent back to Laos by Ho Chi Minh to join the anti-French revolutionary movement that was later known as the Pathet Lao."
