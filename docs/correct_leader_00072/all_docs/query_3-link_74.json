        "text": "Before 1945, Laos had no provincial governors — only deputy-governors, because it was still a French colony. At the district chief level, some districts were under direct French control. After 1949, the year Laos regained its independence from France. Laos started seeing native Lao serving as provincial governors. In each of the 12 provinces that were created, the administrative structure consisted of one Chaokhoueng (governor), and several Chaomuang (district chiefs), Nai Kong (mini district chiefs), Tasseng (county chiefs), and Nai Ban (village chiefs). Each of those provinces was represented at the National Assembly by its elected “deputies”. MR-II, created in 1962, covered two provinces: Xieng Khouang and Houaphan.\n\nComposition of Various Lao Government Cabinets\n\nFrom 1893 to 1949, Laos was a French colony. On May 7, 1954 the French lost Dien-Bien-Phu, pulled out their armed forces from Indochina, and later granted independence to Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. Despite being independent, those three countries became the theater of continuing interferences by Communist North-Vietnam. When the French were in control of Indochina, they did not pay much attention to the development of Laos, which was treated as a remote secondary territory, with roads and highways hard to build and maintain because of the high altitudes involved. Laos had no access to the ocean, blocked mostly as it is by high mountain ranges. The French picked Vientiane as a small trading center to relay merchandises to Thailand. They also picked Luang Prabang as the royal residence for the Lao king who served as advisor to the French on an as-needed basis.\n\nThe French selected Seno as the main airbase in southern Laos. For northern Laos, they picked the Plain of Jars and Phongsaly. They divided Laos in two parts: Northern Laos and Southern Laos. They treated all three parts of Vietnam (Tonkin, Annam and Cochinchine) as an important business territory. Their main command center was Hanoi, North-Vietnam with Cap Saint Jacques, South-Vietnam was back-up. They had planned on making these two commercial centers look like Paris, but ran out of time.\n\nWhen Laos was granted independence by the French in 1954, the kingdom of Laos was subdivided into twelve provinces. In 1962, more provinces were added for a total of 18. Today, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic has 17 provinces, including Phongsaly, Luang Namtha, Bokeo, Oudomsay, Luang Prabang, Houaphanh, Xieng Khouang, Sayaboury, Vientiane, Vientiane City, Borikhamsay, Kham Mouane, Savannakhet, Saravane, Sekong, Champasak, and Attapeu. [The province of Sedone was reshaped by the Lao Communists).\n\nIn 1945, the main Lao leader engaged in the fight to regain Laos’ independence from France was Tiao Phetsarath. Because of that fight, the French realigned their role of administrator of Laos to that of defender of Laos (against neighboring Thailand). On August 30, 1945, King Sisavangvong proclaimed Laos’ independence under French supervision. In September 1945, the Lao Issara Movement expressed its dissatisfaction with the proclamation made (with French support) by the king.\n\nOn October 12, 1945, Tiao Chao Phetsarath announced the formation of a united Lao government in Vientiane, with the following cabinet members:\n\nKhammao Vilay Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs\n\nTiao Souvanna Phoumma Minister of Public Works\n\nTiao Somsanith Minister of the Interior and Justice\n\nKatay Don-Sasourith Minister of Finances\n\nNhouy Abhay Minister of Education\n\nTiao Souphanouvong Minister of Defense and Telecommunication\n\nOune Sananikone Minister of Economic Affairs\n\nOuneheuane Norasing Minister of Justice\n\nSing Ratanasamay Vice-Minister of Defense\n\nKeuang Pathoumsath Vice-Minister of Economic Affairs\n\nTham Saygnasithsena Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs\n\nOn October 20, 1945, the government led by Tiao Phetsarath announced the dethroning of King Sisavangvong and put the king in detention. On October 30, 1945, Tiao Souphanouvong announced the formation of a revolutionary group to join hands with Ho Chi Minh to fight against King Sisavangvong’s government. On April 15, 1946 (Buddhist Year 2488) the French regained control of Laos and forced the Lao Issara Movement to seek refuge in Thailand. The Lao Issara Movement then set up a Lao government in exile in Thailand, consisting of the following cabinet members:\n\nKhammao Vilay Prime Minister\n\nKatay Don-Sasourith Minister of Information & Propaganda\n\nTiao Khamtanh Minister of Financial Affairs\n\nTiao Souvanna Phouma Minister of Public Works\n\nTiao Souphanouvong Minister of Defense and Military Affairs\n\nCabinet members not listed above included Tiao Somsanith and Leuam Insisiengmai).\n\nOn January 27, 1946 Touby Lyfoung, Tougeu Lyfoung and Chao Saykham Southakakoumane (governor of Xieng Khouang) liberated Xieng Khouang from the Lao Issara and the Vietminh, who seized Xieng Khouang less than two months ago on December 28, 1945. On April 25, 1946 the French and their Lao rightist supporters regained Vientiane. The Lao Issara leaders from all over Laos opted to cross the Mekong River into Thailand. During one of those escapes, Tiao Souphanouvong got injured from the French air gun fire while crossing the Mekong River from Thakhek to Thailand. When he recovered from his injury, Tiao Souphanouvong fled into the jungle and eventually reported back to his commanding team, the Vietnamese Communist Party (which sent him to Thakhek in the first place in 1945).\n\nOn August 27, 1946, the French signed an agreement granting independence to Laos with King Sisavangvong, who had been trying to bring all Lao ethnic groups under the same umbrella. The king was prepared to adopt a new constitution calling for the election of provincial representatives, and to oversee a Lao administrative system that relied on French support for national defense and economic development. At the same time, the kingdom of Thailand also reached an agreement with France on returning Sayaboury and Champasak provinces to Laos.\n\nOn December 12, 1946, elections were held to select provincial representatives to work on the draft constitution. The final version of the Kingdom of Laos’ Constitution was adopted and publicly announced on May 27, 1947. In August 1947, national elections were held nationwide to elect representatives according to the new Constitution. King Sisavangvong named Prince Souvanna Phouma as Prime Minister for a one-year term. (TouLia Lyfoung was the first elected Hmong representative from Xieng Khouang).\n\n1st ROYAL LAO GOVERNMENT\n\nThe first Lao Government under H.M. King Sisavangvong and appointed per Royal Lao Decree #148 dated July 10, 1947 was in power from March 15, 1947 to March 24, 1948. . Its members were:\n\nTiao Souvannarath Prime Minister, Minister of Interior and Minister of Defense\n\nTiao Kindavong Minister of Economic Affairs\n\nOuthong Souvannavong Minister of Finance\n\nPhoui Sananikone Minister of Education\n\nKou Abhay Minister of Justice and Religion Affairs\n\nPer Royal Lao Decree #3 dated March 4, 1948 this government was modified as follows:\n\nTiao Souvannarath Prime Minister\n\nTiao Kindavong Minister of Defense\n\nOuthong Souvannavong Minister of the Interior\n\nLeuam Insisiengmay Minister of Finances\n\nKou Voravong Minister of Public Works, Justice and Religious Affairs\n\nBong Souvannavong Minister of Economic Affairs\n\nKou Abhay Minister of Education and Public Health\n\nTheir mission ended with the general elections of the National Assembly members on December 7, 1947 that led to the formation of a new government.\n\n2nd ROYAL LAO GOVERNMENT\n\nRoyal Lao decree # 38 dated March 21, 1948 set the terms for the second Lao government from March 25, 1948 to February 24, 1948. Cabinet members of this second Lao government were:\n\nTiao Boun Oum NaChampasak Prime Minister and Minister of Defense\n\nPhao Panya Minister of Finances\n\nLeuam Insisiengmay Minister of the Interior and Public Works\n\nNhouy Abhay Minister of Education, Health, Religion and Information\n\nIn 1949, Kaysone Phomvihane announced the creation of the Lao Issara Movement while Ho Chi Minh formed the Indochina Communist Party in North-Vietnam. On July 19, 1949 granted independence to Laos within the confine of the French Union. On October 24, 1949 the Lao Issara Movement announced from abroad the dissolution of the “Lao Penh Lao” Party. Some members of that party returned to Laos to join hands with the Royal Lao Government, and others opted to join Kaysone Phomvihane’s Lao Issara Movement supported by the Vietminh. On February 27, 1950 Phoui Sananikone was named Prime Minister of the third Lao Government.\n\n3RD ROYAL LAO GOVERNMENT\n\nRoyal decree #34, dated February 28, 1950 set the terms of the Third Lao Government from February 24, 1950 to October 15, 1951. The cabinet members were:\n\nPhoui Sananikone Prime Minister and Minister of Defense\n\nOuthong Souvannavong Minister of Foreign and Education\n\nKhammao Vilay Minister of Justice and Social Welfare\n\nKou Voravong Minister of the Interior and Religious Affairs\n\nPhao Panya Minister of Finances\n\nLeuam Insixiengmay Minister of Economic Affairs\n\nTiao Souvannaphoumma Minister of Public Works, Transportation, Planning,\n\nCommunication, Information and Propaganda\n\nIts terms ended with the election of the new members of the National Assembly on November 2, 1951(Tougeu LYFOUNG was elected as congraessional of Xieng Khouang Province) most of whom supported Prince Souvanna Phouma. During August 13-15, 1950 the Lao Communist Party (LCP) led by Prince Souphanouvong, and Kaysone Phomvihane held their first party meeting. Souphanouvong was the president of the party and Kaysone Phomvihane was the Defense Minister for the LCP, which was under the Indochina Communist Party (ICP) headed by Ho Chi Minh. In 1951, Ho Chi Minh ordered big changes everywhere in the three Indochina countries (Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam). On November 21, 1951 Prince Souvanna Phouma formed the fourth Lao Government.\n\n4TH ROYAL LAO GOVERNMENT\n\nRoyal Lao Decree #286 dated December 23, 1951 set the terms for the Fourth Lao Government from November 21, 1951 to October 20, 1954. Cabinet members included:\n\nTiao Souvanna Phoumma Prime Minister and Minister of Public Works, Transportation,\n\nPlanning & Post-Office\n\nPhoui Sananikone Minister of Defense, Interior, Youth and Sport\n\nKhammao Vilay Minister of Justice, Religious Affairs, Health and Human Welfare\n\nNhouy Abhay Minister of Foreign Affairs, Education and Information\n\nKatay Don-Sasourith Minister of Finances and Economics Affairs\n\nPheng Phongsavanh Minister of the Interior\n\nNgone Sananikone Minister of Economic Affairs\n\nThe composition of this government was revised twice per Royal Decrees #13 dated May 8, 1953, and Decree #104 dated March 18, 1954.\n\nThis government resigned to allow for the formation of a new government in accordance with the Accords signed by nine countries on July 20, 1954 in Geneva. After the signing of the Geneva Accords, the Lao Communist Party loudly proclaimed that the Indochina Communist Party had won a decisive battle. They then used military forces to attack the army of the Vientiane party, which they vilified as the servants of the French imperialists. On September 19, 1954 Kou Voravong, Minister of Defense of the Royal Lao Government and one of the Vientiane faction’s representatives at the signing of the Geneva Accords on July 20, 1954 was murdered while having dinner at Phoui Sananikone’s residence.\n\nOn November 27, 1954 Katay Don Sasorith formed the fifth Lao Government.\n\n5TH ROYAL LAO GOVERNMENT\n\nRoyal Decree #397 dated November 29, 1954 set the terms of the Fifth Royal Lao Government from November 25, 1954 to February 13, 1956. The members of this government were:\n\nKatay Done-Sasorith Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior and Justice\n\nTiao Souvannaphoumma Vice-Prime Minister and Minister of Defense\n\nPhoui Sananikone Vice-Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs\n\nNhouy Abhay Minister of Education\n\nKhammao Vilay Minister of Religious Affairs\n\nLeuam Insixiengmay Minister of Finance\n\nPheng Phongsavanh Minister of Public Works, Planning, Transportation & Communication\n\nNgone Sananikone Minister of Commerce, Industries, Sport and Youth\n\nDr. Thongdy Sounthonevichith Minister of Agriculture and Veterinary\n\nDr. Oudom Souvannavong Minister of Health and Propaganda\n\nOunheuane Norasing Vice-Minister of the Interior\n\nPhouangphet Panareth Vice-Minister of Finance\n\nOn December 1, 1954 Prime Minister Katay Done Sasorith called for a meeting of the two Lao factions to discuss national unification. His representative at the meeting was Dr. Thongdy, while the Lao Communist Party was represented by Phoumi Vongvichit. The meeting was first held in the Plain of Jars and failed to reach any agreement because the LCP acted too much like the winners. The second meeting was again held at the Plain of Jars, this time with Ounheuane Norasing as head of the Vientiane team, and Phoumi Vongvichit as head of the LCP team. The meeting still produced no results. The third meeting was held later in Vientiane, with Nhouy Abhay as head of the Vientiane team and Phoumi Vongvichit as head of the LCP team. Again, there was nothing positive to report from that meeting. The fourth meeting was also held in Vientiane, with Tane Chounlamountri acting as Vientiane team leader and Phoumi Vongvichit as LCP team leader. This fourth meeting was not any more successful than the previous three.\n\nBecause of this lack of progress, Crown Prince Sisavang Vatthana proposed a meeting of the top leaders of the Lao two factions in Rangoon, Burma scheduled for January 6, 1955. The Vientiane team leader was Katay Done Sasorith and the LCP team leader was Prince Souphanouvong. This meeting in Burma led nowhere because the LCP stood by their original winner’s position. On January 21, 1955 the Katay Done Sasorith government ordered the Royal Lao Army to attack LCP military bases in Houaphan and Phongsaly Provinces and other bases. This motivated even stronger reaction from the LCP. On March 22, 1955 the LCP announced they have changed their name from Neo Lao Hak Xat to Khana Phathet Lao. On December 19, 1955 Laos became a member of the United Nations. On December 25, 1955, elections were held in the liberated zones of Laos.\n\n6th ROYAL LAO GOVERNMENT\n\nAccording to Royal Decree #76 of March 21, 1956, the following served duty from March 21, 1956 to July 23, 1957 in the sixth Lao Government:\n\nTiao Souvanna Phouma Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign, Defense &\n\nPublic Works\n\nKatay Don-Sasourith Vice-Prime Minister\n\nNhouy Abhay Minister of the Interior and Social Welfare\n\nLeuam Insixiengmay Minister of Finance, Economics, and Planning\n\nNgone Sananikone Minister of Education\n\nOunheuane Norasing Minister of Justice and Religious Affairs\n\nDr. Oudom Souvannavong Minister of Health\n\nTiao Souphanouvong Minister of Constructions and Rural Development\n\nPhoumi Vongvichit Minister of Religious Affairs\n\nTiao Souk Bouavong Minister of Public Works and Transportation\n\nDr. Thongdee Sounthonevichit Minister of Post-Office and Telecommunication\n\nTiao Somsanith Minister of the Interior and Social Welfare\n\nChao Nith Nokham Vice-Minister of Finances\n\nNouphat Chounlamany Vice-Minister of Economy\n\nBouasy Vice-Minister assigned to Prime Minister’s Office\n\nThong Southivongnorath Vice-Minister assigned to Prime Minister’s Office\n\nNou-Ing Ratanavong Vice-Minister of Justice\n\nThis Government was approved by the members of the 3rd National Assembly elected on December 24, 1955. Their term ended when an agreement was reached to form the “Lao Huam Lao” (Lao United) government. During January 6-14, 1956 the LCP announced the creation of an army dedicated to the liberation of the country. On March 6, 1956, Prince Souvanna Phouma was asked to form a new government. On September 29, 1956 the King’s Council approved the unification of the two Lao factions. On December 28, 1956 the Vientiane Government and the LCP verbally agreed to form a coalition government and to put the two LCP-controlled provinces back under the control of the coalition government. On November 2, 1957 the two Lao factions signed an agreement to create a joint government on November 19, 1957\n\n7th ROYAL SEVENTH LAO GOVERNMENT\n\nBy the Royal Decree # 163 dated August 9, 1957 the seventh Lao government served duties from July 23, 1957 to November 18, 1957. It consisted of the following cabinet members:\n\nTiao Souvanna Phouma Prime Minister and Minister of Defense\n\nKatay Dounesasorith Minister of the Interior, Economics and Social Welfare\n\nPhoui Sananikone Minister of Foreign Affairs & Public Works\n\nLeuam Insixiengmay Minister of Finances, Justice and Religious Affairs\n\nNhouy Abhay Minister of Education\n\nDr. Oudom Souvannavong Minister of Health, Post-Office & Telecommunication\n\nThe 7th Lao Government resigned to pave the way for the formation of the Coalition Government on November 18, 1957.\n\n8th ROYAL LAO GOVERNMENT\n\nThere was no Royal Decree issued, but this Coalition Government last from November 18, 1957 to July 23, 1958. Cabinet members were:\n\nTiao Souvanna Phouma Prime Minister and Minister of Post Office, Telecom and Public\n\nWorks\n\nKatay Done-Sasorith Minister of the Interior and Public Welfare\n\nPhoui Sananikone Minister of Foreign Affairs\n\nNhoui Abhay Minister of Education\n\nLeuam Insixiengmay Minister of Finances\n\nOunheuane Norasing Minister of Economic Affairs\n\nTiao Souk Vongsak Minister of Public Works\n\nDr. Oudom Souvanavong Minister of Public Health\n\nTiao Souphanouvong Minister of Planning, Reconstruction, & Rural Development\n\nPhoumi Vongvichit Minister of Religious Affairs\n\nNgone Sananikone Minister of Defense\n\nDr. Thongdee Sounthonevichit Minister of Justice\n\nTiao Somsanit Vice-Minister of the Interior\n\nChao Nith Nokham Vice-Minister of Finances\n\nNouphath Chounlamany Vice-Minister of Economic Affairs\n\nBouasy Vice-Minister of Public Construction & Transportation\n\nTheir term ended after “Phak Kao Na” and “Phak Pathet Lao” joined together to form the “Lao Hom Lao” party following the new national elections, which the Neo Lao Hak Xat party participated in. Phoui Sananikone’s political party, which became the majority party in the National Assembly, cast their votes to terminate the Coalition Government on July 23, 1958.\n\nIn early 1957, Capt. Kong Le was appointed lead officer for the training of the special, dare-devil units of the Royal Lao Army at the Chinaimo Camp. He used that opportunity to systematically go and chat with Tiao Souphanouvong at his Nam Pasak residence every evening. Tiao Souphanouvong referred to him as an individual with sharp teeth and nails, easy to curb, and very reliable. At that time, none of the Vientiane leaders paid any attention to Capt. Kong Le.\n\nOn May 4, 1958 decision was made to elect additional national representatives. The Vientiane party and the Pathet Lao both announced the names of candidates for their respective party and were actively engaged in pre-election campaigns. June 10, 1958 was the vote casting day. Phagna Touby Lyfoung was one of those who got elected that day. On July 19, 1958 the International Control Commission (ICC) ended their control mission in Laos; members of the ICC then went back to their respective countries. On July 22, 1958 the government led by Prince Souvanna Phouma was dissolved as a result of the cut in all assistance programs by the US –who did not appreciate the presence of communist cabinet members in that Lao government. On August 18, 1958 Phoui Sananikone set up a new government without any Lao communist participation.\n\n9th ROYAL LAO GOVERNMENT\n\nBy Royal Decree #206 dated August 18, 1958 the following cabinet members served duties from August 18 1958, to December 30, 1959.\n\nPhoui Sananikone Prime Minister and Minister of Planning, Public Construction\n\nand Communication\n\nKatay Done Sasorith Vice-Prime Minister and Minister of Defense and V.A. Affairs\n\nBong Souvannavong Minister of Education, Public Health, Religion Affairs\n\nKhamphan Panya Minister of Foreign Affairs\n\nInpeng Sourignathay Minister of Justice\n\nSisouk Nachampasak Minister of Public Information and Propaganda\n\nLeuam Rasasombath Minister of Finances and Economics Affairs\n\nPane Sisouphanthong Vice-Minister of Public Constructions\n\nTane Chounlamontry Vice-Minister of Public Health\n\nLiap Somphounphakdee Vice-Minister of Veteran Affairs\n\nKhoragnok Souvannavong Vice-Minister of Defense\n\nThis Government was reshaped the first time on March 24, 1959 when it was conferred a one-year term of absolute executive power per Royal Decree #36 dated March 24, 1959. The cabinet’s composition was as follows\n\nPhoui Sananikone Prime Minister and Minister of Planning and Public Welfare\n\nKatay Dounsasourith Vice-Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior\n\nBong Souvannavong Minister of Tele-communication and Fine Arts\n\nKhamphan Panya Minister of Foreign Affairs, Education, Public Informationand Propaganda\n\nLeuam Insixiengmay Minister of Finances and Economics Affairs\n\nGen. Sounthone Pathammavong Minister of Defense and Veterans Affairs\n\nSisouk Nachampasak Minister of Public Information, Propaganda, Sports and Youth\n\nInpeng Sourignathay Vice-Minister of Education\n\nPane Sisouphanthong Vice-Minister of Public Constructions and Transportation\n\nTane Chounlamountri Vice-Minister of Justices Affairs\n\nLiap Phisaychoumphon Vice-Minister of Agriculture and Forestry\n\nKhoragnok Souvannavong Vice-Minister of Interior and Religious Affairs\n\nCol. Phoumi Nosavanh Vice-Minister of Defense and Veteran Affairs\n\nLt. Col. Oudone Sananikone Vice-Minister of Public Welfare\n\nThe second reshaping of the Phoui Sananikone’s government took place following a disagreement between members of the Committee for the Defense of the National Interests (“Comite pour la Defense des Interets Nationaux”, CDIN) and members of the Phoui Sananikone’s political party. The disagreement was related to the term extension of the third National Assembly members.\n\nPhoto #90. Lt. Col. Tou Ya, commander of the second battalion of the Lao communists stationed at the Plain of Jars in 1957 during the first coalition government. On May 18, 1959 Tou Ya left from the Plain of Jars and ordered the destruction of the bridge over the Nam Tom Rivernear Ban Phone on Highway 4 between the Plain of Jars and the town of Xieng Khouang. He knew this bridge very well and still got into an accident and died at the site in 1961. It is important to note that his driver, who was a Vietnamese, survived the accident. In 1961, following the political changes that took place between the French war and the US war in Indochina, several politicians and military officers broke ranks to join hands with Gen. Vang Pao and the Vientiane government. Lt. Col. Tou Ya’s death might have been politically motivated because North-Vietnam was known for not allowing too many defections. On page 96 of the book, “Tou Ya Sai Chu, A Great Man from Lane Xang”, one could read, “After learning about Tou Ya’s death, Gen. Vang Pao ordered his troops to cease fire temporarily in the memory of the deceased, and stated he was deeply saddened by the death of Mr. Tou Ya, who was a very competent army officer and well respected by the Hmong people.”\n\nRoyal Decree # 398 dated December 14, 1959 listed the following cabinet members:\n\nPhoui Sananikone Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign, Defense, Rural Development, Public Construction, Propaganda, Sports, and Youth\n\nKatay Don-Sasorith Vice-Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior, Religion & Justice.\n\nLeuam Insixiengmay Minister of Education, Public Health & Public Welfare\n\nTiao Somsanith Minister of Finance & Planning\n\nChao Nith Nokham Minister of Economics Affairs\n\nKhoragnok Souvannavong Vice-Minister of the Interior\n\nPane Sisouphanthong Vice-Minister of Justice\n\nKhoun-One Vive-Minister assigned to Prime Minister’s Office\n\nKhamking Souvanlasy Vice-Minister assigned to Prime Minister’s Office\n\nIn December 1959, this government was dissolved because of its inability to control the political situation, and the emerging influence of the CDIN Committee that heavily attacked Phoui Sananikone. CDIN members, under the leadership of Gen. Sounthone Pathammavong, mounted a coup d’etat and asked Kou Abhay to form an interim government tasked with making preparations for the 4th national elections.\n\nMany noteworthy events also occurred. On May 7, 1959 the government ordered that the two Pathet Lao battalions stationed in Samneua and Xieng Khouang Provinces be combined with the rest of the Royal Lao Army. The Pathet Lao disagreed with the order, forcing Gen. Ouan Rattikoun to fly to the Plain of Jars and try to reach understanding with the Pathet Lao battalion there. But the general was stopped and asked at gun point not to meet with anybody. The general had to fly back to Vientiane and ordered the forces under his control to lay siege to the Pathet Lao battalion at the Plain of Jars led by Lt. Col. Tou Ya.\n\nOn May 17, 1959 the two Pathet Lao battalions sent a fake promise to collaborate with the Vientiane faction within the next 24 hours. In the evening of May 18, 1959 heavy rainfall occurred and the following morning, the whole camp previously occupied by the Pathet Lao troops had been entirely vacated. Gen. Ouan Rattikoun ordered his Vientiane troops to chase the fleeing Pathet Lao in two directions, toward Paksane and toward Ban Bane, but to no avail. He then ordered Maj. Vang Pao to put Hmong troops in the pursuit. The leader of the pursuing team was Capt. Lee Pao. His unit caught up with the fleeing Pathet Lao near Muang Mork and engaged in a light fire arm exchange in which the commander of Pathet Lao Battalion 2, Tou Ya, got shot in the leg. Voices of crying teenagers and women were heard, prompting Capt. Lee Pao to contact Maj. Vang Pao for more orders. Maj. Vang Pao ordered Capt. Lee Pao to stop the attack and let the enemy walk away.\n\nOn May 25, 1959 the Pathet Lao leaders were detained on order from the Phoui Sananikone’s government at the police camp of Phone Kheng because they had refused to combine their troops with the Royal Lao Army and, instead, let them escape.\n\nOn August 4, 1959 the government declared an emergency situation throughout the country. On October 29, 1959 King Sisavang Vong passed away and Crown Prince Sisavang Vatthana was asked to take over the vacant royal seat.\n\nIn late 1959, Capt. Kong Le was named commander of the second battalion of parachutists of the Royal Lao Army stationed at Wattai, Vientiane. The government was under Phoui Sananikone as Prime Minister. Laos was receiving some military training assistance from the US.\n\nIn around December 1959, the Phoui Sananikone government was pressured by the Royal Lao Army to resign. On January 21, 1960 Kou Abhay formed an interim government to allow for new, nationwide elections open to all political parties.\n\n10th ROYAL LAO GOVERNMENT\n\nBy the Royal Decree #403 dated March 8, 1960 the following cabinet members served duties from March 7, 1960 to May 30, 1960:\n\nKou Abhay Prime Minister\n\nNhouy Abhay Vice-Prime Minister and Minister of Education and Youth\n\nNgone Sananikone Minister of Justice and Religious Affairs\n\nKhamphanh Panya Minister of Foreign Affairs\n\nNouphat Chounlamany Minister of Propaganda & Public Welfare\n\nTiao Somsanith Minister of the Interior\n\nGen. Phoumi Nosavanh Minister of Defense and Veteran Affairs\n\nTiao Souvath Saygnavong Minister of Public Health\n\nOudong Souvannavong Minister of Public Works\n\nLeuam Rasasombath Minister of Finances and Economics\n\nTheir term of duties ended after the election of the 4th Congressional Representatives. On April 24, 1960 (the year of ChaoMouang Moua chiasang was assassinated) the election results showed that the newly elected representatives were exclusively from the Vientiane faction. The majority of the votes were casted for the CDIN party led by Tiao Somsanith, who then was automatically assigned the task of forming the next government.\n\n11th ROYAL LAO GOVERNMENT\n\nRoyal Decree #151 dated April 6, 1960 gave the authority to Tiao Somsanith to form the government with cabinet members listed below. The term of duties was from April 5, 1960 to August 9, 1960.\n\nTiao Somsanith Prime Minister; Minister of Interior, Administration Development\n\nKhamphan Panya Minister of Foreign Affairs\n\nGen. Phoumi Nosavanh Minister of Defense and Veteran Affairs\n\nInpeng Sourignatay Minister of Finances and Planning\n\nNgone Sananikone Minister of Justice and Religious Affairs\n\nLeuam Insixiengmay Minister of Propaganda and Socail Welfare\n\nNith Singharath Minister of Public Works, Telecommunication & Transportation\n\nKeo Viphakone Minister of Economics & Rural Development Affairs\n\nNhoui Abhay Minister of Education & Arts\n\nKoukeo Saycocie Minister of Public Health\n\nPhouangphet Phanareth Vice-Minister of Finances and Planning\n\nOu Voravong Vice-Minister of Public Works\n\nBouavanh Norasing Vice- Minister of Justice and Religious Affairs\n\nTouby Lyfoung Vice-Minister of Propaganda and Social Welfare\n\nThis government decided to appoint Souvanna Phouma as Lao Ambassador to France. On May 23, 1960 at midnight, all the Pathet Lao political prisoners detained at the camp of Phone Kheng very easily escaped, led by the main prison guard. This was the time when the Cabinet members were busy with the funeral of King Sisavang Vong in Louang Prabang and then were dismissed following the coup d’etat in Vientiane mounted by Capt. Kong Le, who then asked Prince Souvanna Phouma to form a new government.\n\nCapt. Kong Le mounted a coup d’etat and formed a neutralist government. On August 9, 1960 Capt. Kong Le mounted a coup d’etat against the Royal Lao Government led by Tiao Somsanith and Gen. Phoumi Nosavan. Capt. Kong Lae took that opportunity to bring in Pathet Lao troops and several battalions of communist North-Vietnamese to protect Vientiane, along with his own revolutionary troops.\n\nKongle’s Revoultionary Government:\n\nTiao Souvanna Phouma Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign, Defense, Veteran.\n\nTouby Lyfoung Minister of Justice, Religious Affairs and Information\n\nKinim Pholsena Minister of Interior, Sports and Youth\n\nKhamsouk Keola Minister of Health, Education, Social Welfare and Rural\n\nDevelopment\n\nKhamking Souvanlasy Minister of Finances and Economy\n\nKhamsing Ngonevorarath Minister of Public Works\n\nTiao Boun-Om Nachampasak Vice-Minister of Defense and Veteran Affairs\n\nTiao Sisoumang Sisaleumsak Vice-Minister of Rural Development and Social Welfare\n\nPrince Souvanna Phouma sent Gen. Amkha Soukhavong and Phagna Touby Lyfoung as his representatives to Xieng Khouang that ended up being detained by Maj. Vang Pao. On August 12, 1960 Kong Le sent a helicopter to Ban Na Nhang, near Muang Kasy to pick the five Lao communist leaders, who just escaped from jail, and have them serve as cabinet members in the new neutralist Souvanna Phouma’s government. The five Pathet leaders were Nouhak Phoumsavanh, Phoune Sipraseuth, Sisana Sisane, Singkapo Sikhot-Chounlamany and Phoumi Vongvichit. (Reference: Phoumi Vongvichit’s Memoirs, page 143). On August 15, 1960 Gen. Phoumi Nosavan announced the formation of a counter-coup d’etat government in Savannakhet to stand up against Kong Le’s revolutionary government in Vientiane. On August 16, 1960 Capt. Kong Le asked Prince Souvanna Phouma to form Laos’ third neutralist government.\n\n12th ROYAL LAO GOVERNMENT (NEUTRALIST)\n\nBecause H.M. the King did not endorse the revolutionary government that he just formed, Prince Souvanna Phouma reached an agreement with the counter-revolutionary government led by Gen. Phoumi Nosavan to form another government, this time including both the revolutionary and the counter-revolutionary groups. Royal Decree #220 dated August 31, 1960 confirmed the following cabinet members of the 12th government that served duties from August 31, 1960 to October 9, 1960:\n\nTiao Souvannaphoumma Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Defense and\n\nVeteran Affairs\n\nGen. Phoumi Nosavanh Vice-Prime Minister and Minister of Interior and Religious Affairs\n\nNhoui Abhay Minister of Education and Fine Arts\n\nLeuam Insixiengmay Minister of Economic Affairs\n\nInpeng Souriyathay Minister of Finance\n\nOu Voravong Minister of Post Office & Telecommunication\n\nKinim Phounsena Minister of Information and Propaganda\n\nKhamsouk Keola Minister of Public Health\n\nTouby Lyfoung Minister of Justice\n\nKhamsing Ngonevorarath Minister of Public Works and Transportation\n\nGen. Ouane Ratikoun Vice-Minister of Defense and Veteran Affairs\n\nKhamking Souvanlasy Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs\n\nTiao Sisoumang Sisaleumsak Vice-Minister of Rural Development Affairs\n\nTiao BounOm Nachampasak Vice- Minister of Interior and Religious Affairs\n\nThe counter-coup group did not participate in this government, which was later dissolved after Prince Boun-Oum Nachampasak mounted his coup d’etat. On September 10, 1960, Gen. Phoumi Nosavan and Prince Boun-Oum Nachampasak gathered more than half of the national representatives and opened a National Assembly session in Savannakhet that voted to dismiss Prince Souvanna Phouma’s government. On October 10, 1960 Gen. Kouprasith Abhay mounted an attack to liberate the city of Vientiane, but was not successful because of the strong defense put up by the communist troops. Prince Souvanna Phouma had to fly out to Phnom-Penh after relinquishing his prime ministership to Kinim Pholsena and Gen. Southone Pathammavong.\n\nIn the military and other fronts, in early September 1960, the Souvanna Phouma’s government announced its cooperation with the Neo Lao Hat Xat and allowed the Pathet Lao to set their headquarters in Samneua, Houaphan Province. On October 13, 1960, Soviet Russia opened its embassy in Vientiane. On November 22, 1960 Prince Souvanna Phouma asked that Soviet Russia provide military and economic assistance to his neutralist government. On November 28, 1960 the counter-coup troops under the command of Gen. Phoumi Nosavan attacked the front line of Capt. Kong Le’s forces. During December 13-16, 1960 the Gen. Phoumi Nosavan’s troops attacked and liberated the city of Vientiane. A new government was then formed. [Phoumi Vongvichit in his Memoirs noted that, “We did not want to cause any damages to the population and the city of Vientiane and thus decided to move the battle field to the Plain of Jars”).\n\n13th ROYAL LAO GOVERNMENT\n\nThis government was created per Royal Decree #283 dated December 14, 1960 and stayed in office from December 13, 1960 to April 23, 1962. It put the Kong Le’s revolutionary group to rest, but did not receive the needed votes of confidence from the members of the National Assembly until after the liberation of the city of Vientiane, as stated in Royal Decree #1 dated March 5, 1961. The cabinet members are listed below.\n\nTiao BounOum Nachampasak Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs\n\nGen. Phoumi Nosavan Vice-Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, Veteran Affairs\n\nand National Security\n\nBouavan Norasing Minister of Justice, Information, and Propaganda Affairs\n\nLeuam Insixiengmay Minister of Interior Affairs\n\nPhouangphet Phanareth Minister of Finances and Planning\n\nTouby Lyfoung Minister of Public Health and Social Welfare\n\nNgone Sananikone Minister of Economy\n\nTiao BounOm Nachampasak Minister of Religious Affairs\n\nTiao Sisouk Nachampasak Minister of the Prime Minister’s Office\n\nKhamphan Panya Minister of Public Works, Telecom & Post Office\n\nNhoui Abhay Minister of Education\n\nTiao Sopsaysanath Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs\n\nBounthong Voravong Vice-Minister of Veteran Affairs\n\nBounlap Nhouyvanisvong Vice-Minister of Economic Affairs\n\nPhouangkeo Phanareth Vice-Minister of Public Works\n\nThis government was dissolved to allow for the formation of a tri-party government. Prime Minister Tiao Boun-Oum Nachampasak had to resign to make this happen.\n\nOnce the counter-coup group liberated the city of Vientiane, troops under Capt. Kong Le’s command retreated from Vientiane along highway 13 heading toward Phone Hong, Vang Vieng, Kasy, Sala Phoukhoune, and the Plain of Jars. When they reached Muang Soui on December 25, 1960 they received food supplies and military equipments dropped from Russian airplanes between Kasy and Muang Soui. Once Kong Le has regrouped his troops, he started attacking the rightist forces at Ban Bane, Muang Kham and the Plain of Jars, using military support from the North-Vietnamese communists.\n\nOn December 30, 1960 Maj. Vang Pao, commander of the rightist troops protecting the Plain of Jars, received some air reinforcements from Gen. Phoumi Nosavan but did not have the time to use them.\n\nOn December 31, 1960 the Kong Le’s troops, combined with North-Vietnamese communists, easily seized the Plain of Jars and Xieng Khouang. On February 11, 1961 Prince Souvanna Phouma flew back to Laos and landed in Khang Khay, Xieng Khouang Province, to join hands with the Lao communists and North-Vietnamese communists who had just captured and were in full control of the Plain of Jars.\n\nThe capture of the province of Xieng Khouang by the Kong Le’s troops led to dangerous changes. The people in those two provinces parted ways and/or became enemies as a result of the fight between the three Lao factions –leftists, neutralists and rightists. In the end, the leftists were fighting the neutralists, bringing in Vietnamese communists to slaughter the Lao people. Furthermore, the whole country was also divided into three territories answering separately to the rightists, the leftists, or the neutralists. The Lao people lost all their freedom because of mutual mistrust and total lack of confidence as a result of the Vietnamese communists’ incitement.\n\nOn February 24, 1961 Prince Souvanna Phouma flew back to Cambodia as he felt that the situation was not safe yet for him to stay in Laos, due to the ongoing fighting in all corners of Xieng Khouang and Houaphan Provinces between the rightists, the neutralists, the Pathet Lao and the Vietnamese communists. On May 8, 1961 the International Control Commission (ICC) consisting of representatives of India, Canada and Poland came back to resume its duties in Laos. On May 11, 1961, the ICC announced the cease-fire.\n\nOn May 16, 1961 a negotiation meeting was held in Geneva, Switzerland. On June 22, 1961 the three Lao princes –neutralist Souvanna Phouma, rightist Boun-Oum Nachampasak and leftist Souphanouvong– met in Zurich, Switzerland. They continued their discussions on the formation of a three-faction Lao government until June 12, 1962 at several meeting sites including Hine Heup, Plain of Jars and Zurich. When they failed to reach any agreement, North-Vietnamese and Pathet Lao troops strongly attacked Luang Namtha Province.\n\nIn May 1962, the US sent their military forces to Thailand to control the communist expansion into southeast-Asia. On June 23, 1962 the second Lao coalition government was formed. On July 23, 1962 representatives of the three Lao factions met in Geneva, Switzerland to support Laos’ neutrality. At that meeting, Boun-Oum Nachampasak, Souvanna Phouma and Souphanouvong were represented by Phoui Sananikone, Kinim Pholsena, and Phoumi Vongvichit respectively. One of the agreements reached was to have all the foreign troops leave Laos completely. That agreement did not prevent the Vietnamese communists to beef up their troops in Laos.\n\n14th LAO THREE-PARTY GOVERNMENT\n\nThe Lao Coalition Government was reshaped five times per Royal Decree #219 dated March 23, 1962 due to the peace agreements reached in Geneva. The cabinet members served their duties from March 23, 1962 to June 1974.\n\nTiao Souvanna Phouma Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, and Veteran and Rural\n\nDevelopment Affairs\n\nTiao Souphanouvong Vice-Prime Minister and Minister of Economy and Planning\n\nGen. Phoumi Nosavanh Vice- Prime Minister and Minister of Finances\n\nPheng Phongsavanh Minister of the Interior and Social Welfare\n\nPhoumi Vongvichit Minister of Information, Propaganda & Tourism\n\nLeuam Insixiengmay Minister of Education, Arts & Youth Affairs\n\nBounthan Songvilay Minister of Religious Affairs\n\nTiao Sisoumang Sisaleumsak Minister of Post Office & Telecommunication\n\nNgone Sananikone Minister of Public Works & Transportation\n\nKhamsouk Keola Minister of Public Health\n\nKhoun-One Voravong Minister of Justice\n\nKinim Phounsena Minister of Foreign Affairs\n\nKeo Viphakone Vice-Minister of Social Welfare\n\nBounthong Voravong Vice-Minister of Arts, Sport, & Youth Affairs\n\nKhamfeuane Tounalom Vice-Minister of Economics & Planning Affairs\n\nTiao Souk Vongsak Vice Minister of Public Construction & Transportation\n\nGen. Heuane Mongkhonvilay Vice-Minister of Veteran Affairs\n\nKhampheng Bouppha Vice-Minister of Rural Development\n\nIn November 1962, following an internal disagreement between neutralist Capt. Kong Le and neutralist Deuan Sounarath, the neutralist forces stationed at the Plain of Jars split into two neutralist groups. [In his book on the Phuan history, Chao Khamlouang Nokham wrote on page 232, “Gen. Kong Le started noticing the feet of the snake and the snake then started eating the feet of the hen”]. Tiao Souphanouvong picked Col. Deuan Sounarath to replace Kong Le. As a result, the neutralist troops fell into pieces.\n\nPhoto #91. The three Lao princes (from left to right: Chao Boun-Om Nachampasak, Taio Souvanna Phouma and Tiao Souphanouvong .In 1962, the three princes divided Laos into three parties –rightist, neutralist, and leftist—that fought against each other. In the end, Laos fell to North-Vietnam and the Lao monarchy came to an end in 1975.\n\nDuring 1962-1963, Gen. Vang Pao’s command center located at Padong (LS05) was heavily attacked by the Vietnamese communists. In 1963, Pathet Lao troops combined with North-Vietnamse troops attacked the neutralist troops of Kong Le and pushed them out of the Plain of Jars toward Muang Phann. On February 12, 1963 Col. Ketsana Vongsouvan, Kong Le’s chief of staff, was murdered at the Plain of Jars.\n\nPhoto# 92. The three Lao princes signed an agreement on June 22, 1961.

Kettsana Vongsouvan (the 3rd person to the left of Kong Le and his right hand man who was assassinated in the Plain of Jars in 1964 by Col. Thao Deuane Sounnarath and the Communist Pathet Lao) and Col. Deuane (the last person to the right).\n\nOn April 1, 1964 (Buddhist Year 2507) Kinim Pholsena, Minister of Foreign Affairs and the neutralist signer of the 1962 Geneva agreement on behalf of Prince Souvanna Phouma, was murdered on April 1, 1964 (Buddhist year 2507) by his personal guard, Sergeant Saykong, as he was coming home in the That Dam neighborhood from a dinner party. He was replaced as Minister of Foreign Affairs by Khamsouk Keola. On April 12, 1964 Police Chief Khanthi Siphanthong, a pro-leftist neutralist, was murdered at his home in the Saylom neighborhood, Vientiane. This assassination lifted the neutralist issues one notch further.\n\nIn 1965, the Kong Le’s troops retreated from Muang Phann to Muang Soui, Xieng Khouang Province. In 1967, they then moved from Muang Soui to Kasy, Vientiane Province. Later on, having nowhere else to go, Kong Le chose to go abroad, leaving his neutralist troops all scattered around, some in Vang Vieng, and some in the city of Vientiane. Soon afterwards, Kong Le’s neutralist troops literally disappeared from the scene. The assassination of Kinim Pholsena caused the split within the coalition government, and compelled all the Pathet Lao leaders to go back to Samneua. As a result, Prince Souvanna Phouma had to reshape his government for a total of five times.\n\nPhoto #94. Gen. Kong Lae met with Gen. Vang Pao in 1967\n\nFirst Government Reshape\n\nThe reshape, made at the request of the Kouprasith Abhay’s revolutionary group and effective May 22, 1963 involved the following changes:\n\nPheng Phongsavanh served as acting minister for Kinim Pholsena;\n\nGen. Soukan Vilayhong (new cabinet member) took over Gen. Heuane Mongkholvilay’s position of vice-minister of Veteran Affairs;\n\nOuthong Souvannavong (new cabinet member) took over Khamsouk Keola’s position of Minister of Public Health;\n\nTiao Sisoumang Sisaleumsak took over Phoumi Vongvichit’s position; and\n\nNgone Sananikone took over Tiao Souphanouvong’s position of vice-Prime Minister.\n\nSecond Government Reshape\n\nBouavanh Norasing took over Khoun-One Voravong’s position of Minister of Justice;\n\nOunheuane Norasing took over Bounthan’s position of Minister of Religious Affairs;\n\nTay Keoluangkhot took over Bounthong Voravong’s position of Minister of Education, Sports and Youth Affairs; and\n\nTiao Sisouk Nachampasak took over Phouangphet Phanareth’s position of Minister of Finances.\n\nOn April 16, 1964 the three Lao factions resumed their talks on the coalition government\n\nOn April 19, 1964 Gen. Kouprasith Abhay and Gen. Siho Lanphouthakun mounted a military coup against Prince Souvanna Phouma’s interim coalition government and demanded that this government put a higher priority on resolving the country’s economic and social problems. Their coup d’état was not very productive because foreign countries stood by Laos’ neutrality status and, instead, exerted a lot of pressure on the coup d’etat instigators to return the power back to Tiao Souvanna Phouma’s government. Power was indeed restored to Prince Souvanna Phouma so that he could resume his Prime Minister function and put his government back in action on April 23, 1964.\n\nIn early June 1964, the Vientiane government ordered heavy air bombardment by T-28 aircrafts on Pathet Lao and North-Vietnam’s military command centers in the Plain of Jars area. In September 1964, the three Lao factions opened another series of negotiation meetings in Paris without much success.\n\nOn February 5, 1965 Gen. Kouprasith Abhay and rightist high-ranking military officers mounted a coup d’état to chase deputy-Prime Minister Phoumi Nosavan, National Coordination Department Director Gen. Siho Lanphouthakun, and Lao Air Forces commander Gen. Thao Ma to Thailand. After reaching Thailand, these three individuals sought and got political refugee status from the Thai government.\n\nOn April 17, 1966, Gen. Siho met with a priest in Thailand to ask him for protective amulets and then surrended himself to the Laos authorities in Pakse. He was then sent for detention at the Phou Khao Khouay prison where he was later killed while attempting to evade on September 4, 1966. Nobody paid any attention to his death.\n\nPhoto #95. Gen. Thao Ma and US Ambassador William Sullivan\n\nThird Government Reshape\n\nOn March 10, 1965 (Buddhist year 2508), Souvanna Phouma revised his Government as follows:\n\nLeuam Insixiengmay took over Phoumi Nosavanh’s position as Vice Prime-Minister;\n\nSisouk Nachampasak took over Phoumi Nosavanh’s position as Minister of Finances;\n\nOuneheuane Norasing took over Bouavanh Norasing’s position as Minister of Justice; and\n\nSouvanna Phouma took over the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs from Pheng Phongsavanh.\n\nFourth Government Reshape\n\nFollowing the demand of the provincial representatives, on September 6, 1965 Souvanna Phouma had to revise his government as follows:\n\nInpeng Sourignatay, former vice-president of the National Assembly, took over Ounheuane Norasing’s position as Minister of Justice;\n\nTiao Boun-Om Nachampasak took over Ounheuan Norasing’s position as Minister of Religious Affairs;\n\nTaykeo Luangkhot changed from Minister of Education to Minister of Public Health in replacement of Outhong Souvannavong who became President of the National Assembly;\n\nSouvanna Phouma accepted Khampheng Boupha’s resignation; and\n\nSouvanna Phouma added the position of Minister of Rural Development to his current positions.\n\nIn October 1973, Gen. Thao Ma went to Wattai and used one of the T-28 aircrafts at the airport to drop bombs on the Chinaimo and Phone Kheng military camps for revenge. Gen. Kouprasith was able to escape the bombing at the last minute. After dropping bombs, Gen. Thao Ma flew back to the Wattai Airport to reload more bombs on the aircraft. As his plane hit the air strip, its landing gear got stuck, forcing the pilot to use emergency landing procedures that failed. Gen. Thao Ma was seriously injured, captured and carried to the headquarters of Gen. Kouprasith, who then killed him in front of several witnesses.\n\n1966 was the year Lyteck Ly Nhia Vue got his law degree from a French university. As Gen. Vang Pao needed a staff member with good education to help him, he invited Lyteck to come and work as ethnic group administration and legal affairs. Lyteck, however, chose to go back and work at the Ministry of the Interior in Vientiane. He either did not feel comfortable working with the ethnic minorities and the military, or maybe he had a different career plan. In the end, in 1975, Lyteck was arrested and put in detention in Vieng Xay, Houaphan Province, where he was killed not long afterward. When they were working in Vientiane, Lyteck and Yang Dao ran into several problems. Both were well-educated but lacked cooperation and understanding skills. Lyteck had worked longer as a civil servant than Yang Dao, as Gen. Vang Pao picked Yang Dao who just completed his university level education to be a member of the three-faction Joint Political Committee in 1973.\n\nFifth Government Reshuffle\n\nThis reshape, effective March 6, 1967, involved the following changes of duties:\n\nDr. Khamphay Abhay became the Minister of Public Health;\n\nHoumphan Saygnasith became vice-Minister of Finances & Economy;\n\nSouk Ouplavan became Vice-Minister of Rural Development;\n\nLien Pravongviengkham became Vice-Minister of Education, Youth, Sports and Arts; and\n\nSisoumang Sisaleumsak became Minister of Education, Youth, Sports and Arts; and\n\nAfter all of these five changes, the Souvanna Phouma’s 14th government consisted of the following cabinet members:\n\nTiao Souvanna Phouma Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, Veterans, Foreign Affairs and\n\nRural Development\n\nTiao Souphanouvong Vice-Prime Minister and Minister of Economy & Planning\n\nLeuam Insixiengmay Vice-Prime Minister and Minister of Education, Sports, Youth, Arts\n\nPheng Phongsavanh Minister of the Interior and Social Welfare\n\nSisouk Nachampasak Minister of Finances\n\nInpeng Sourignatay Minister of Justice\n\nPhoumi Vongvichith Minister of Information, Propaganda, & Tourism\n\nTiao Sisoumang Sisaleumsak Minister of Post Office, Telecommunication & Health\n\nNgone Sananikone Minister of Public Works and Transportation\n\nTiao Boun-Om Nachampasak Minister of Religious Affairs\n\nKeo Viphakone Vice-Minister of Social Welfare\n\nKhamfeuane Tounalom Vice-Minister of Economy & Planning\n\nTiao Souk Vongsak Vice-Minister of Public Works and Transportation\n\nSoukane Vilaysane Vice-Minister of Veteran Affairs\n\nSouk Ouplavanh Vice-Minister of Rural Development\n\nKhamphay Abhay Vice-Minister of Public Health\n\nHoumphan Saignasith Vice-Minister of Finances\n\nLien Pravongviengkham Vice-Minister of Education, Arts, Sports and Youth"
