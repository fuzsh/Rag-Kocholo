        "text": "Pakse City is the capital city of Champasak province of southern Laos, and the third most populous in the country, serving as a major transport and commercial hub for southern Laos. It is situated at the confluence of Xedon River and the Mekong, about 100 km north of the country’s border with Cambodia, 30 km east of the Thailand border and 200 km west of the border with Vietnam. It is strategically located at a key point in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), along Road 13S that connects to the GMS’ East-West and Southern Economic Corridors, and along Route 20 that connects Thailand and Vietnam. It is the capital of the southernmost province of Laos, Champasak, and has a total land area of 125 km2. Pakse was officially declared as a city after the government recently announced the upgrade of three provincial capitals (Luangprabang, Kaysone Phomhivane, and Pakse) to city status. A ceremony was held on May 31st, 2018 to announce the new status of Pakse City.\n\nThe city of Pakse is located on a plain area approximately 102 meters above Mean Sea Level (MSL) and surrounded by high peaks adjacent to a large mountain. The Mekong is over one kilometer wide as it passes through Pakse, flowing broadly from northwest to south. The central area of Pakse and its immediate surroundings are relatively flat with slight undulations, levels varying about 20 meters within the urban area and 40 meters in the rural areas. Many of the low lying areas are below the 5-year-flood level of the Mekong River. The area along the Pakse side of the Mekong River is level for the length of the whole urban area. Similarly, the area west and south of the Xedon River to the Mekong River around Pakse Airport is also flat. Towards much of the development east of the city, the land rises towards Mount Bachiang. From north of Pakse to the east of the Xedon River and directly across from the Mekong, land is also relatively flat, serving as the main rice growing area in Champasack Province. Downstream from the Mekong Bridge the land rises towards Mount Palou and Mount Malong, both abutting the Mekong River. Key attributes of the city as follows: plain/flat, lowland, river and coastal, mountainous, and plateau.\n\nKaysone Phomvihane city, previously known as Khanthabouli, is a city in western Laos and the capital of the of Savannakhet province. It sits on the Mekong River, bordering Thailand. The city is also known as Kaysone Phomvihane, the name of the 20th-century president who was born here. Kaysone Phomvihane City has a land area of 779.03 km2, acting as a border town and also serving as a major agro-industrial processing center. The town is the largest city in Savannakhet province, and is bounded to the west by the Mekong River and Mukdahane province in Thailand, to the east by Outhomphone district, to the south by Champhone district, and to the north by Xaibouli district. Kaysone Phomvihane has been officially declared as a city after the government recently announced the upgrade of three provincial capitals (Luangprabang, Kaysone Phomhivane and Pakse) to city status. A ceremony was held on May 25th, 2018 to announce the new status of Kaysone Phomvihane City.\n\nKaysone Phomvihane city is located in the alluvial river plain of the Mekong River with flat land along the river, dry land, and lowland.\n\nLuang Prabang Province is located in the central part of the northern region of Lao PDR, which is about 390 kilometers from Vientiane Capital. The province is adjacent to Phongsaly Province and China in the north side, Oudomxay Province in the west side, Xayabury Province in the south side, Xiengkhouang Province, and Huaphan Province in the east side. The province is also surrounded by mountains; and flat land is situated near the Mekong River and Khan River. In accordance with the ratio of land area and elevation, the land area with elevation lower than 300 meters exists only at 0.25% of the total area, and even the area lower than 500 meters exists only at about 7% of the total. Therefore, there is a limitation for expanding the paddy field and farm yard since most part of the land is not low and not gently sloping."
