        "text": "When the trio looks into the case of Paul (who may or may not be possessed by his doppelgänger but is most definitely Ellen Waverly’s beard from For All Mankind tied to Sister Andrea’s past), Evil 4×12 presents us with a series of what ifs. We don’t, however, get to look too deeply into any of them. Maybe that’s because everyone has a healthy fear of Ben’s mom’s superstition coming true; maybe, even, the whole “sign you were gonna die” thing is a warning to us about what’s coming in the next couple of episodes. (But let the record show we very much prefer the possibility set up in Ellie’s future scenario.) We’d be willing to guess, though, that our time with this assessment is limited because…our remaining time with the assessors is way too limited.\n\nSo, while we explore some alternate paths, we also must try to figure out a plan for everyone’s future. You know, the ones we’re never gonna see. Hm. Guess that brings us to our 12th review in a row in which we take something from the episode and put a “#SaveEvil” spin on it. Should we start a GoFundMe and/or sell some feet like the kids suggested? (Katja Herbers basically already tried the latter…or so some exaggerated reporting might have claimed.) Perhaps, instead, we should offer to do Mr. Stick’s dirty work for him and/or just take care of Judge Jeter’s dumpster. (RIP, Leslie, by the way.) All of the above, maybe? Eh. We’re tired, and we’re dreading the end.\n\nLet’s get to it.\n\n“I am the reason he is in Hell.”\n\nOne of the best things about this series has always been its ability to make you think you’re getting one story, only to completely break you with another. Evil 4×12 “Fear of the Other” is no different. In this case, guest star Nate Corddry comes along and delivers this great performance as three very different characters — Paul, his double Gregory, and his other double Jess the ski instructor — but the episode isn’t really about them. Not really, at least. Obviously, Paul Jr. goes through something pretty terrible here. As always, we’re free to decide what the truth might be. Does seeing his doppelgänger light himself on fire trigger his unhealed sense of abandonment following his dad’s suicide? Or does Gregory really haunt him? We know what Dr. Bouchard’s answer would be…but we also know Sister Andrea’s.\n\nRegardless, the possession of the week (if you will) provides us with this great opportunity to get inside our favorite BAMF of a nun’s head. Possibly more than ever before. We got a little bit of this backstory earlier in the season when the grief demon attacked her by mentioning Paul Sr. But actually having to confront him in demon form, or her imagination’s conjuring of him (or whatever), is a completely different story. It hurts so, so much more, and Andrea Martin absolutely shatters us when her character’s usually-assertive demand that the demon “go back to Hell” comes out halfhearted and heartbroken. As she hands that piece of flesh back to what used to be her childhood friend so he can cover the hole in his head, we kind of just…wish putting her back together and wiping away all her grief could be that simple.\n\nIn the moment, Martin not only makes Sister Andrea’s sense of loss obvious, but we also see doubts start to creep in. Is this a demon? And if so, why isn’t he attacking her? Why doesn’t this thing that looks like Paul Sr. behave like all the others? We can picture her asking these questions — and many more — but she never really does. The only one she actually asks out loud is why he’s trying to kill his son. In addition to all of this, because Sister Andrea’s strength comes from her faith and her faith takes a temporary hit here, something about the character just comes across as small.\n\nAnd then, her double shows up — but far more traditional, far more severe, and far more pious — and tells that “most unholy demon” that is our beloved nun to die. Which, sidebar: How fitting is it that, in any iteration, Andrea is always Sister Andrea?\n\n“….but I fear that my piety may have turned someone I cared for long ago away from God. And the absence of God’s presence in this man’s life led him to take his own.”\n\nFrom there, Evil 4×12 takes Sister Andrea back to church and to our own Father David’s confessional. Jut like Sheryl’s confession earlier this season, Martin’s scene with Mike Colter is an absolute stunner. Unlike that previous scene, though, David’s not in much of a position to be his most reassuring. He just came so close to saving the church — and all his loved ones’, including Andrea’s, jobs — only for money-hungry so-called “leaders” to take his brilliant presentation and use it against him. And now, the one person in the world he knows to be good and faithful — his mentor in so many ways — is breaking down, blaming herself and all the things about her that he admires for her friend’s death.\n\nIt’s too much. For the character, for us, for Andrea who utterly breaks down and is barely able to choke out her “amen” after Father Acosta tells her God has forgiven her…just too much. And Colter delivers a David who’s just worn down, worn out, and at a complete loss. His own faith has taken yet another hit, yet the ritual is all he can really offer. Not to mention, as much as his friend is hurting, he knows he has more bad news for her. Because the series is ending church is closing, and he’s just run out of options for saving it.\n\n“I thought if I followed the path of righteousness, my life would fall into place! But. It hasn’t. I’ve never been more lost.”\n\nWith all that in mind, the way Evil 4×12 ends manages, at least for us, to be both a welcome message of hope and…something that leaves us kinda empty. Ok. So, God’s there. In that very room…and what? We still have only two episodes left to wrap up this story. Andy still ran off with 10 cents on the dollar of that last batch of money from the climb, leaving his family with nothing. Leland still seems to be on the verge of going free because the courts, much like the Church, are corrupt AF…where’s our miracle already?\n\n“It’s all coming apart, isn’t it?”\n\nJust as Evil 4×12 airs just two weeks before we say goodbye, it’s also two weeks before the assessors lose their jobs. Or, rather, Father Acosta — just like his dear friend Sister Andrea — will be reassigned, while Ben and Kristen will have to look elsewhere if they expect to earn a living. Ben looks like he’s going to be set with some kind of six-figure science nerd job or another, but Kristen…not so much. So, she almost gets money dumped in her lap…but, of course, nothing can be that easy. And it’s both kind of shocking she doesn’t even think about actually using her degree until after the big money falls through…and entirely fitting.\n\nAlong the way, though, this idea of two lives (both of them for you) comes into play in a big way here. Because the trio is exhausted, and their world is unraveling. And they’re all getting pushed out of the life they’ve known the past few years with no compass to point them toward the “correct” next path. Even with all of that happening, they still have to keep working, jut watching everything fall apart around them. (Which isn’t that how it always happens?) So, what do they do? They look outward instead of following their hearts and let the algorithm give them a glimpse of what it might decide for them.\n\nFirst up, a supposedly-nonchalant Ben finds himself unable to find any excitement in all his top-dollar super science nerd job offers. So, he turns to the “Find My Doppel” app. What does he see there? A guy who is, somehow, an even bigger nerd…but one who has a family. It’s a great solo scene for Aasif Mandvi in which he proves Ben is not, in fact, as unbothered as he may pretend to be. On the flip side, Kristen actually chickens out on looking up her own double but instead looks for David’s…and then, proving she’s really down bad but looking for a “safe” option, still fantasizes about the doppelgänger. Dedication: We respect that.\n\nBy the end of Evil 4×12, when Kristen finally looks for her own twin, she finds a musician. And “Cientje Stofkooper” is a rather interesting little thing. First off, while she’s alone on the sidewalk as she strums her guitar, she’s clearly enamored with someone behind the camera. Second, there aren’t four — much less five — children shouting over each other, telling her (more than once!) to sell pictures of her feet (I LOLed). Third, she’s just utterly normal.\n\nFurthermore, the way Katja Herbers plays Kristen’s reaction is so understated, yet it still gets us right in the guts. Kristen sees this carefree person with her own face, smiling broadly and doing what she loves, in the fresh air, on a sunny day. She watches the video while her own world is dark — quite literally as it’s the middle of the night, yet also figuratively. Because…well. Y’all know the plot — and, somehow, we don’t get the impression that Kristen is despairing. There’s this sense of longing, sure. But also…hope? Inspiration, even? Interestingly enough, the way Kristen is so drawn to that other reality makes us ache, even if she seems to simply be taking comfort in “what if.”\n\nBut, in our reality, Dr. Bouchard wants to start up a practice in her garage with Dr. Boggs’ help. Do we think that is actually going to happen? Um. No. Not only are the vibes definitely off when Kristen asks Kurt for some referrals, but…the train will probably not be helpful. Oh, and we also have Leland’s “oh, he’s dead” comment after Boggs’ testimony to worry about.\n\nYikes.\n\nNever trust the justice system.\n\nIn another example of these last four episodes of Evil basically saying “f*ck it. We do what we want,” we get a legal drama in the middle of…everything else. Honestly, all we need to make the courtroom scenes better is for Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski) to show up and start handing Leland and his “great evil” of a lawyer their you-know-whats, thus making both this series and The Good Fight officially in the same universe. Alas, we don’t quite get that…but we do get some really compelling and shocking — to say the least — stuff.\n\nThings start out entertaining enough, with Dr. Boggs stumbling through giving the testimony he knows Leland and his demon lawyer want while Kristen levels him with that oh-so-betrayed stare. As far as character building goes, it’s kinda a big deal for Kurt to (eventually) speak up, even after seeing how utterly terrifying Demon Stick actually is. Doing the right thing isn’t easy, especially not when you know it might cost you everything. But Kurt’s integrity, it appears, is still alive and well.\n\nLater, when Kristen has her chance to testify, Herbers is brilliant. First, there’s the very cool, calm, and collected way she has an answer to each and every single one of Stick’s objections. And then, she gets to tell a story — and relish every second of it. Kristen lays it on thick, knows she’s doing so, and is purely elated over the thought that she’s getting under Leland’s skin. Every single time she looks out at the defendant, she is triumphant and almost daring him to speak up. It screams, “you’re going down.” That ever-so-slight little grin off Michael Emerson tells a whole story, too. If Leland weren’t so mad, and if they weren’t on opposite sides of this thing, he might almost be impressed. Almost.\n\nBut then. But then. Leland seems genuinely concerned, perhaps for the first time, when he hears that the prosecution has one more witness: Leslie. This is, of course, where things go completely off the rails. (Except, like, in a good way.) Richard Kind spends the entirety of Evil 4×12 playing a totally normal judge…at least by TV standards. One who even shoots down Mr. Stick’s claims of an extremely composed Kristen being unhinged, one who even gets a little sassy about how he doesn’t think Stick wants a ruling on those objections of his. Even at the start of the scene with Leslie, Judge Jeter comes across as nothing more than a kind, almost dad-like, type.\n\nAnd then.\n\nY’all, talk about a twist!\n\nRIP, Leslie.\n\nHonestly, seeing her head get unceremoniously separated from her body feels kind of like the shock of hearing this series was ending. (Too soon?) Also, will this thing end badly? If so, can David at least move in with Kristen like the crazy lady said before it does?????? Like, we could do a social commentary here about corrupt judges who’ve sold their souls to the greatest evil imaginable. But eh. Pretty sure that’s more than clear. So, instead, let’s just marvel over how great a series has to be to still be able to shock us…and be bitter about the cancellation all over again.\n\nMore on Evil 4×12\n\nLove the upside down “CBS STUDIOS PRODUCTION” card and the way we rotate down that hallway to see Sister Andrea. If y’all are gonna go out, go out with no f*cks left. I know that’s right.\n\n“She was the love of my dad’s life. The…nun who got away.” And Sister Andrea’s reaction is basically a “record scratch/freeze frame” meme.\n\nKristen is so messy. Girl, you do not need that tea when your life is a soap opera right now.\n\nMissed opportunity for Corddry to play yet another Larry, though. Larry Wilson and Larry Radakowski represent!\n\n…I really do watch too much TV.\n\nAnyway.\n\nImagine having to the audacity to start talking about a placebo effect in front of Sister Andrea after she’s come and cleaned your house so many times. Even almost died in a storm to keep your family safe. Kristen, girl, I love you? But no.\n\n“Sure. Haunted house hours? Why not? Let’s go out with a bang.” Yes. Let’s.\n\n“Getting Leland off is not your job.”\n\nI still giggle when Demon Stick’s theme plays. So. Much. Overkill. On purpose!\n\nBig fan of Kurt Fuller playing Kurt so ashamed and timid. Dude can’t even look up, much less speak up, when he says exactly what Leland and his barely-there satisfied smirk wanted him to.\n\n“Because of the severity of Dr. Townsend’s mental disorders, I have determined that he poses a considerable threat to public safety and should be locked away in a maximum security — mental! — psychiatric facility. For life.” Fuller manages to start this at such a low point for Boggs, then build in passion and bravery while he goes. All while still letting the grief come out because he knows he’s cooked after this. Love.\n\n“Think we’re gonna miss this? These ghost stakeouts?” Yes. I will. Thanks for asking.\n\n“I only have two feelings: disdain and hunger.” A mood.\n\nOk but 1) I adore them. 2) Ben deserved that pillow being thrown at him. And worse.\n\nThe tension in Corddry’s body when they find Not-Paul sleepwalking…whew.\n\nVery much prefer that corny AF “high quality content” about the interrupting ghost over that cancellation message we got last week. Mazel tov.\n\nKatja Herbers, scream queen.\n\nAlso, how messed up is it that she sees herself this time??????\n\nThe way she spits her coffee out when Lila brings up an OnlyFans…\n\n“OH MY GOD! WHAT KIND OF A MONSTER RAISED YOU?!!!” …who wants to tell her.\n\nAnd Lexis is there trying really hard not to crack up.\n\nThat “IV therapy” stuff is forever in my Facebook ads. I can now blame Leland.\n\n“You just lost the element of surprise, demon.” Tiny queen!\n\n“Guys. I’m fine.” Girl, please.\n\n“You get to choose who you want to be.” Practice what you preach, Father! Choose.\n\n“Why are you so afraid to succeed?” I am in this photo and I do not like it.\n\n“God gave you this body. You use it.” This is going to be a common line in fic now, huh?\n\nAnyone else remember the two Bens problem? Seems related.\n\nThe way Andrea can’t help but love that man, even when she’s convinced it’s a demon/not actually him…oof.\n\nYes. This. But, like, with the real David.\n\n“She doesn’t seem like the unhinged one to me, Mr. Stick.” You gotta drop that beat to bring out Unhinged!Kristen.\n\nIf y’all follow the gymnastics drama at all, let’s just say Kristen’s fake tears on the witness stand are still somehow more genuine than Mykayla Skinner’s alligator tears. If not, please do disregard.\n\n“She was a kind, loving, giving mother and grandma. Everything she did was for the wellbeing of myself and my four daughters.” So true!\n\nThe entire scene where Kristen lectures the girls about the fake GoFundMe…I am soooooo going to miss this ridiculous little (eh, kinda big) family.\n\n“You’re still gonna sell your feet, right?” Stoppppppp.\n\n“Well, telling the truth is harder than anything these days.” I hate it here.\n\n“Your Excellency. This is not fair.” “I’m sorry you think so.” No but it literally isn’t. Also, it’s super corrupt. I hate you.\n\nGorgeous shot of David alone in the empty church.\n\nThe way Andrea barely gets out that “yes” when David asks if she believes only God decides…ouch.\n\n“But I have doubts.” Where’s the gasoline?\n\nJust…the total change in the judge’s demeanor.\n\nAlso.\n\nHOW. WHAT. WHAAAAT.\n\n“I promise you, Kristen: You and your family will never see me.” It’s…a threat.\n\n“Everyone has a price on their soul.” Yeah. And Harlan Crow can pay it.\n\n“So it alllllll comes crumbling down.”\n\nThey’re like actually proud of her…but I don’t see it ending well.\n\nThis is bad. I don’t want it. Make the whole “it’s ending” thing stop.\n\nWhat did you think of Evil 4×12 “Fear of the Other”? Leave us a comment!"
