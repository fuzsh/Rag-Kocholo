        "text": "When the band of frequencies in the picture signal is imposed on the high-frequency broadcast carrier current in the modulator of the transmitter, two bands of frequencies are produced above and below the carrier frequency. These are known as the upper and lower side bands, respectively. The side bands are identical in frequency content; that is, both carry the complete picture signal information. One of the side bands is therefore superfluous and, if transmitted, would wastefully consume space in the broadcast spectrum. Therefore, the major portion of one of the side bands (that occupying frequencies below the carrier) is removed by a wave filter, and the other side band (occupying frequencies above the carrier) is transmitted in full. Complete removal of the superfluous side band is possible, but this would complicate receiver design; hence, a vestige of the unwanted side band is retained to serve the overall economy of the system. This technique is known as vestigial side-band transmission. It is universally employed in the television broadcasting systems of the world.\n\nThe television channel thus contains the picture carrier frequency, one complete picture side band (including the complete chrominance subcarrier), and a vestigial portion of the other picture side band. (See the diagram of spectrum allocations for compatible colour channels.) In addition, the carrier for the sound transmission and its side bands is included within the channel. Since the band of frequencies needed to convey the sound is much narrower than that needed for the picture, it is feasible to include both sound-carrier side bands. To avoid mutual interference between sound and picture, the picture and sound side bands must not overlap. Moreover, some space must be allowed at the edge of the channel to avoid interference with the transmissions of stations occupying adjacent channels. These requirements are met in the colour television channels of the NTSC, PAL, and SECAM systems shown in the figure.\n\nEach channel in the NTSC system contains the following bands: 4.2 megahertz for the fully transmitted picture side band, 1.25 megahertz for the vestige of the other picture side band, 0.2 megahertz for the sound carrier and its two side bands, and the remaining 0.15 megahertz to guard against overlap between channels. The chrominance subcarrier is included within the fully transmitted picture side band.\n\nThe standard broadcast television channels of the United States are assigned 6 megahertz each in the following segments of the spectrum: VHF channels 2, 3, and 4, 54–72 megahertz; 5 and 6, 76–88 megahertz; 7 through 13, 174–216 megahertz; and the UHF channels, 14 through 83, 470–890 megahertz. These channels are allocated to communities according to a master plan established and administered by the Federal Communications Commission. No more than seven VHF channels are provided in any one area; many smaller cities must be content with one or two channels. In the major cities of Europe, fewer channels (typically two to four per city) are provided, because the higher population density and closer spacing of cities precludes more assignments within the available spectrum.\n\nBroadcast television\n\nAfter the signal wave form and carrier current are combined in the modulator, the modulated carrier current is amplified (typically to 10,000 watts or more) and passed to the transmitter antenna, which is designed to direct radio waves along the surface of the Earth and to minimize radiation toward the sky. The antenna must be placed to stand as high and in as exposed a location as possible, since the radio waves tend to be intercepted by solid objects that stand in their path, including the Earth’s surface at the horizon. Reception beyond the horizon is possible, but the signal at such distances becomes rapidly weaker as it passes to the limit of the service area.\n\nIn the transmitting antenna, the amplified carrier current produces a radio wave of the same frequency that travels through space. This wave induces a considerably weaker, but otherwise identical, current in any receiving antenna located within the service area. The signal picked up by a receiving antenna is typically as low as 0.00000001, or 10−8, watt, yet even this low power is capable of producing reception of excellent quality, since the amount of amplification conferred on the picture and sound currents by a typical television receiver is extremely large. Indeed, when tuned to a station at a distance of 80 km (50 miles), the power picked up by an antenna can be as low as 10−11 watt, whereas the signals fed to picture tube and loudspeaker are on the order of 1 watt. In other words, the receiver produces a faithful amplification on the order of 100 million times.\n\nCable television\n\nIn the United States, about two-thirds of homes obtain their broadcast television over coaxial cable systems. Cable television actually began as a service for people living far from the large cities where most broadcasting took place. The solution for rural consumers was a single master antenna located high on a hill to pick up the faint signals, which would then be amplified and retransmitted over coaxial cables to the homes of viewers. Thus community antenna television (CATV) was invented, with the earliest system being installed in 1948. Later, CATV systems were installed in large cities to provide an improved picture by avoiding ghosts and other forms of noise and distortion. Today, cable systems offer many more programs and services than can be obtained from television broadcast over the air. Most cable television programs are distributed over communications satellites.\n\nA cable television system begins at the head end, where the program is received (and sometimes originated), amplified, and then transmitted over a coaxial cable network. The architecture of the network takes the form of a tree, with the “trunk” carrying signals to the neighbourhoods and “branches” carrying the signals closer to the homes. Finally, “drops” carry the signals to individual homes. Coaxial cable has a bandwidth capable of carrying a hundred six-megahertz television channels, but the signals decay quickly with distance. Hence, amplifiers are required periodically to boost the signals. Backbone trunks in a local cable network frequently use optical fibre to minimize noise and eliminate the need for amplifiers. Optical fibre has considerably more capacity than coaxial cable and allows more programs to be carried.\n\nThe tuners of most television receivers are capable of receiving cable channels directly. However, many programs are encrypted for premium rates, and hence a cable convertor box must be installed between the cable and the television receiver."
