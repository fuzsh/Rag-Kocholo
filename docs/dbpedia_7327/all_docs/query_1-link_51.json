        "text": "By: Gordon Kinlaw\n\nWalmart App Update\n\nIn my last newsletter, I wrote about the Walmart App and Walmart Pay. After a few weeks of using the app, I can say it works great so keep your cards in the card when you shop Walmart. I also switched my RX to Walmart and found that it is very convenient to refill your meds with the app.\n\nVenmo App – free\n\nIf you are over 50, you likely have not heard of this app. It’s is the chosen app for social financial transactions of the younger generation – the debit card generation. Venmo is a no-cost way to send and request money with your friends or even businesses who happen to have the app. It works like PayPal in that you associate your Venmo account with your bank account. You do not have to use a bank account though, you can keep money in Venmo land bank.\n\nThe screenshot shows the social history aspect of the app. You can populate the list of Payees from your Facebook account.\n\nHere’s examples: You go out to dinner with friends and decide to split the bill. One person pays with their debit card and the others send money immediately to the debit card user. Another use is to pay a friend back for a purchase or for your share in organizing a party or shower.\n\nYou can transfer the money from Venmo to your bank account after you receive it. Venmo is designed for using with known contacts so do not use purchases on places like Craigslist.\n\niPhone Rumors\n\nApple does not disclose it’s plans for phones or software until right before the releases. We know to expect a new phone model in September. The 7S models will have new features and as always a new OS to go with it. But it will have a new role this year as an “affordable” option to the iPhone 8 which should be released shortly after 7s September. Apple might also move up the 7S release to get the 8 release in for the Christmas season. iPhone 8’s are rumored to have some slick features and a solid gold price tag of around $1000. $1000 would be the straight out purchase price as compared to the $650 for current phones. Here are some of the rumored features of the 8.\n\n• 5.8″ OLED display\n\n• faster A11 processor\n\n• all glass body- edge to edge\n\n• no home button\n\n• wireless charging\n\n• camera & touch ID integrated into display\n\n• higher level of waterproofing\n\n• dual lens camera lenses like the plus model • (I just don’t see LONGER BATTERY LIFE)\n\nDing Doorbell – $117\n\nDing has not been shipped yet but it sounds like a pretty good idea. It’s advertised as a mid-level solution with not to many frills. It has a outdoor button/speaker, an indoor speaker device and an app for your phone. When someone rings the doorbell, you can talk with them on the speaker or your phone. Ding is Wifi connected, therefore you can take your doorbell alerts when you are away from home. No camera is included. Check the dingproducts.com website for availability.\n\nMost video doorbells are $199 but here’s an option: Zmodo Greet $69\n\nPlaystation Vue – app free – subscription $29.95 and up\n\nVue is the new kid on the block in TV streaming. You might as well try it cause that’s where the market is going. Basically no cable TV soon. Playstation Vue is not just for Playstation owners, Vue will work on more devices: Sony TV’s, Chromecast, Firesticks, ROKU’s, etc.\n\nVue is an alternative to cable & satellite TV except for major entertainment networks (NBC, CBS, ABC) which you can get with an over-the-air antenna like I have (Lava HD 8008 antenna). . Don’t know if you agree but there just isn’t much good content to view on the major networks at night so you might as well watch house flippers, old movies, DIY and sports. OTA TV is Free.\n\nBelow is a list of the channels in the smallest Vue package which will cost you $29.95/ mo. OTA Tv is Free.\n\nThis is an iPhone subject since there is an easy to use app where you find your channel and then send it to Chromecast. You can also just watch it on your phone. I added it to my phone and to the Amazon Firestick. My Samsung TV does not have the app but I’m sure they will expand soon.\n\nThe video quality is excellent so head on over to the website and sign up for a 30-day free trial. Your credit card is required because they will charge you for the subsequent months if you don’t cancel. You can have up to 5 devices streaming from one paid account.\n\nThe other streamers are: Sling TV, DirectTV Now and YouTube TV (not out yet)\n\nACCESS SLIM Package $29.85\n\nABC On Demand – PlayStation Vue doesn’t allow you to stream ABC live, probably because ABC has different programming on at the same time on different local affiliates across the country.
