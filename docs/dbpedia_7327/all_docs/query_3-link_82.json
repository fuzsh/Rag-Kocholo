        "text": "Is anyone else having issues recording shows on USA? I record Raw, NXT, The Purge and a few other shows on USA and recently the recordings skip like crazy. Maybe it's the USA stream and not a channels issue? The issue is only with USA, any suggestions to remedy?\n\nIt was working fine for me for weeks, but the last week or so has been horrible.\n\nWrong, not everyone. I never have issues with recordings on any channels that people are talking about. Sure, I’ve had minor stream problems but that’s from the source but that has been very few times.\n\nMaybe change your dns? I run my own unbound dns server for a few months now and that clear a few errors I was getting when tve launches.\n\nThere was a problem earlier in the week with streams from NBCUniversal. This includes Bravo, USA, E!, SyFy, etc. The stream would pause for a bit, and then start again.\n\nWhen watching live, this showed up as a pause in the stream, and then a skip. When recording, the recording would simply cut out the affected portion. (I ran a test yesterday to see if it was the source stream or Channels, and it was the source stream. The sample recording I made was only 57 minutes for a 60 minute program.)\n\nUnfortunately, Channels is at the mercy of the originating streams when you are using the TVE integration. This means that if there is an upstream problem, there is nothing the developers can do to fix it. You can file a complaint with NBCUniversal that there is a problem with their TV Everywhere stream, but it is outside of Channels' control.\n\nIt’s not a channels thing. It’s your own personal network/router/internet connection thing. It’s not their job to tell you how to manage something you pay another company for. That’s what the forums are for, try different solutions from the community.\n\nYou’re here trying a product that’s easy but certainly need a little tech Knowledge to get it working. If you made it this far, then it would behoove you to learn how the internet works and try different solutions.\n\nYou don’t need to run your own server, just change the dns addresses on your router. If you need help, ask. Don’t blame the developers.\n\nSo change it to something better and test. Try opendns or cloudfare.\n\nThe problem isn't related to the end-user, their equipment, or their internet connection.\n\nThe problem is related to NBCUniversal's servers and the streams they are distributing.\n\nHere is the full list of affected TVE channels:\n\nNBC (If you are able to receive local broadcasts via TVE)\n\nBravo\n\nCNBC\n\nE!\n\nMSNBC\n\nOxygen\n\nSyFy\n\nUniverso\n\nUSA\n\nThis is a known issue, but there is nothing that can be done about it. If you would like it addressed, send them an email from their support page at https://www.nbc.com/contact-us and use the selections of \"I am having a technical problem\" and \"I am having trouble with the live stream\".\n\nNo. Like I said in my first post, I don’t have streaming or recording problems with those channels.\n\nWhile you may have only noticed problems with USA, other users have reported problems with other NBCUniversal streams, predominantly CNBC and MSNBC. While you may only be experiencing it on USA, it is an intermittent problem that is affecting all NBCUniversal TVE streams.\n\nThanks for letting me know, hopefully it clears up on its own soon.\n\nI was seeing this a lot on CNBC earlier in the week, but it appears to be stable again this weekend.\n\nAs others have reported the same issue was occurring on nbc.com/live and that's where the dvr records from."
