        "text": "There are several popular social media accounts that graph weekly cable network schedules, and it’s always stunning to see how many schedulers have just given up. Nearly every cable network, large and small, now mostly program marathons of their most popular shows.\n\nYou know about “Ridiculousness” on MTV, of course. But did you know how much time Disney Channel runs “Big City Greens,” Nick Jr. airs “Paw Patrol,” Adult Swim telecasts “Bob’s Burgers” and “American Dad,” and Nick at Nite runs “Friends”? A lot.\n\nAs basic cable gets zombified, the double-digit declines continue. Live sports, of course, is saving the broadcast networks and some cable networks still in that game. And then there’s the interesting case of the diginets, which have managed to keep their declines small as they program a wider range of nostalgia fare to aging adults. And the networks with a very loyal, specialized audience — bravo, Bravo — experienced the smallest declines this year.\n\nOverall, NBC once again led the year in total viewers (and like last year, just narrowly over CBS) with 4.54 million viewers, while the Super Bowl helped give Fox the lead in adults 18-49 (with a nice 10% year-to-year bump).\n\nRELATED: The 100 Most-Watched Telecasts of 2023: NFL, Oscars, Gordon Ramsay, ‘NCIS’ and a Single ‘Yellowstone’ Episode\n\nTomorrow, Variety will share the ranker of this year’s most-watched primetime telecasts. Spoiler alert, it’s nearly all football. It’s what keeps linear alive! But here, Variety recounts which networks were up and mostly, who was down in 2023.\n\nWINNERS\n\nReelz: “On Patrol: Live” has been the gift that keeps giving for tiny, mostly forgotten cabler Reelzchannel. Since picking up the series, which was essentially a revival of A&E’s canceled “Live PD,” Reelz has seen its average ratings shoot up dramatically. (That, of course, is a sign of how low a base the network was before Dan Abrams & co. joined its primetime lineup.) In 2023, Reelz shot up 34% in total viewers — the most of any network in the top 50. But a hefty caveat: A+E Networks has been given the go-ahead to continue its quest to seek claims of copyright and trademark infringement against Reelz and producer Big Fish.\n\nGrit: The fastest growing broadcast TV network of 2023 is a channel that airs western movies and TV shows (“Death Valley Days,” “The Lone Ranger”) — mostly from 60 years ago, or even older. That indeed is the recipe for success in the dwindling world of linear TV: Appeal to the aging audience still watching linear TV. It’s been a successful formula for cabler INSP, which saw its audience slip this year (perhaps because of that growing competish in the westerns space) but was still a top 20 network. This year, Grit leaped over the CW to become the ninth most-watched broadcast net.\n\nMSNBC, Newsmax, Newsnation: Everyone to their corners. While CNN and Fox News both registered 20% declines this year, somehow MSNBC defied the odds and saw a slight 2% uptick. Newsmax, which continues to go full-conspiracy and ultra right-wing, is feeling the divisive benefits of stoking that fear and rage with a hefty 22% jump. Newsnation, which has also added more opinion to its mix, is up and even heftier 73% (although from a smaller base). Expect all the news networks to see big jumps in 2024, as the Potential Final Year of Democracy should prove that what’s tragic for the country will be excellent for the ratings.\n\nLOSERS\n\nHBO and its linear premium cable counterparts: The pay TV channels have been at the forefront of sending viewers to their streaming counterparts, and that has given them some of the biggest declines of any channels this year. That starts with HBO, down a tremendous 34% among viewers, with Showtime down 25% and Starz down 31%. Starz Encore and Cinemax weren’t even measured this year.\n\nKids TV: Sorry for being a broken record, but the collapse of the linear kids TV network business has been stunning in this streaming age. In 2014, the first year we started this report, Disney Channel was a top 10 network, with nearly 2 million viewers. In 2023, Disney Channel is ranked No. 80, with 132,000 viewers. Nickelodeon (-34%), Disney Channel (-26%), Disney Junior (-27%), Nick Jr. (-34%), Cartoon Network (-19%) all know that kids aren’t watching linear TV, and they’re certainly not watching linear TV in primetime. Somehow, Teen Nick saw a bit of a boost this year, which is interesting since that channel almost exclusively only runs “Henry Danger” on weekdays and “iCarly” on weekends. And that’s pretty much it.\n\nParamount Network: No “Yellowstone,” no numbers. Last year, the power of “Yellowstone” gave Paramount Network an incredible boost – the network was the only major cabler to see gains thanks to the huge success of that show. But in 2023, only one episode of “Yellowstone” aired — on Jan. 1. Without its signature hit, Paramount slipped 30%, putting it back below rivals FX and AMC. (Which also experienced yet another year of double-digit dips.)\n\nBelow are the primetime rankers for broadcast, cable and premium cable networks in 2023, among total viewers (as well as the top 50 list in adults 18-49). Most Nielsen-rated networks can be found here, with the exception of a few channels that are not ad-supported. Networks no longer included in this year’s tally — because they either shut down or no longer rated — include Olympic Channel, Fuse, NBC Sports Network, Black News Channel, G4 and Pursuit Channel.\n\n[For historical record, here are previous year-end network rankers: 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015.]\n\nTHE MOST-WATCHED NETWORKS OF 2023 (BY TOTAL VIEWERS)\n\nTHE 50 TOP-RATED NETWORKS OF 2023 (BY ADULTS 18-49)"
