        "text": "Did someone say WEDDING? Personally I hate weddings, but then again I am a cynic and will talk shit about love from here til the end of time. That being said, I was so ready for the wedding that was set to come in this season finale of My Life With The Walter Boys.\n\nHayley and Will are getting married!\n\nIf you’ve watched this season, you know that this has been a road to get here. It’s been somewhat of a struggle to get here (ok, a lot of a struggle), but good things come to those who wait and we’re about to get something good.\n\nThere’s so much that has happened in this season of My Life With The Walter Boys, that it’s a lot to keep up with. Just imagine if they actually had all of the Walter boys that were in the books. Yet everything has led up to this episode and I can’t hate what got us here, because I have loved this season. I have loved every single moment, even when I have hated every single moment.\n\nThe thing about shows like this is that they are often so bad that they are good or they are so bad that it reminds you of the awkward phases of life.\n\nBut when it comes to this show, this cliffhanger, this ending…\n\nWe’re hooked.\n\nIT IS ALL ABOUT THE WEDDING\n\nJackie is loving the opportunity to organize this wedding. She’s happy having everything put together and part of me thinks that is because she needs to keep things together for others because she can’t for herself.\n\nBut this wedding isn’t going to make everything better. It’s not going to set everything straight. Most likely it’s just going to confuse things even more.\n\nAlex wants Jackie’s attention, but she’s telling him that she needs everyone to do their part and she needs to focus.\n\nGeorge and Katherine are so excited that Will is getting married, but Katherine is nervous. Jackie loves everyone counting on her.\n\nAlex is making everything about him. Yes, I am glad that he’s going away to camp. He needs to. He’s still trying to figure out how to one up Cole, and though George thinks that it’s worked itself out, lets be honest, it hasn’t.\n\nThe way that the wedding is coming together is perfect (except the bouquet, but we’ll talk about that), and seeing Hayley’s Mom support her – I love it. Everyone needs love and support. Hayley and Will find a way to be perfect in the best and worst of circumstances. They know their hearts and they are willing to weather the storm.\n\nWe need to give a second to Hayley’s wedding dress. That dress is stunning. It’s beautiful.\n\nTheir wedding was perfect for the two of them. The reception was perfect for the two of them. The Walter family is a special family and they have so much love to give. Them looking out for each other is something you don’t see in everything, but it’s something that we all want from family.\n\nWhat I did love was Coles speech. I cried. Yes, I cried. It was the most beautiful speech – one that makes me want to meet my person. One that makes me want to fall in love and find the moments that change me.\n\nThe Walter boys – they are special.\n\nWill and Hayley’s first dance was something different and special.\n\nThis whole episode made me want to get married on a Colorado ranch.\n\nWhat I hated about the wedding was Alex and him getting drunk. I don’t know, I think it’s just not forgivable to act like that. He just really always acts like he has something to prove rather than just being who he is.\n\nBut the most awkward thing was Alex telling Jackie that he loved her. It was a lot. Alex is a lot. If I was Jackie, I would have ran the fuck away. Alex expected a reply and she couldn’t give it. He was too drunk for words and lets be thankful that his best friend put his ass to bed. He just was out of line.\n\nAnd he was way out of line telling Kylie that she’s so cool. She’s practically a dude. Alex just keeps fucking up.\n\nIt’s the wedding that makes Jackie realize how great Katherine and George have been to her. Katherine reminds Jackie what her being there has brought the Walter’s. But whats important is that Jackie feels like she’s found her new family.\n\nIt’s that moment – the moment with Katherine that gives me hope that Jackie has/is finding her way. Sometimes that’s short lived, the finding your way part.\n\nTHE BOUQUET\n\nFor the life of me, I can’t understand why it is that Jackie left the bouquet outside by the door. She’s a little overwhelmed, and this is a mistake that isn’t a good one. Especially when the dog eats the flowers.\n\nFor Jackie this feels like an ending. She’s panicked, especially when she can’t get the florist on the phone.\n\nWhen Cole tells her that he can get her flowers and if she doesn’t trust him she can come. Jackie going, well, not shocked, but also it made me smile. Them riding horses out to get flowers, talking, and finding a way to be friends, but yet bond.\n\nI love that Jackie and Cole motivate each other in a way. Cole telling her that he’s going to summer school – I smiled. The way that they two are magnets to each other is kinda the love that I wish I would have had a teenager.\n\nCole wants to talk about when the truck broke down and tells her to forget the stuff he said. But that breaks her. You can see it in her eyes.\n\nFor Jackie, she’s lost the people that loved her the most and feeling the love that she feels with the Walter family is important to her.\n\nJackie lights up in a way that she doesn’t with Alex when she’s around Cole. She deserves that happy.\n\nUNCLE RICHARD AND WILL\n\nWill is a little nervous about getting married, but talking to his parents about selling the place makes his heart hurt. You can see it. George and Katherine had him look over the paperwork for the sale.\n\nThere are no decisions that need to be made at that moment, but for Will, he’s going to do whatever it takes to save the place. He asks Jackie what she thought of it when she got there and she says what we’ve all known. The Walter ranch is special.\n\nWhen Richard arrives, Will decides that he needs to talk to him about investing in the ranch and making it a destination. Richard being there, it’s an opportunity and Will recognizes it. But Richard also recognizes that Jackie is happy there and he wants to do whatever it takes for her to continue to be happy.\n\nRichard telling Katherine that this place is exactly what Jackie needs – to a point I agree. But I feel like what Jackie needs is a little bit of help. She needs help figuring out what she wants and needs. And maybe its Colorado, maybe it’s New York.\n\nI think that Richard investing in the ranch will be a good storyline for season two. One, because it saves the ranch, but two, because it will force Jackie to return.\n\nAnd she needs to return.\n\nLOVE AND THE TEACUP\n\nDanny is so excited to go to New York, but Cole… well, he’s taking a moment to say that woah is me. Now don’t get me wrong, I do feel for Cole and all of the things that he’s lost. But COle is trying to do everything to turn his life around, even if he doesn’t want to admit it. He even finished a paper (and school is over).\n\nCole is supposed to be going on the great American adventure, but when Jackie asks him about it, he tells her about writing the paper. There is so much pride in her eyes.\n\nWhat I loved about Cole going to the school is that he got a chance to talk to Erin. She deserved apologies, but Cole realizing that he hadn’t treated her well, and saying that he didn’t mean to hurt her – well, she definitely did deserve that acknowledgement. Cole is changing. Cole is growing.\n\nSometimes situations change us. Sometimes we’re forced to realize that change is a good thing, especially if we evolve. Cole growing, Erin seeing Danny as someone that she has a crush on, Danny seeing his worth – it’s all good to see.\n\nJackie wants to help the Walters and at the end of the night – helping Danny and finding the teacup – again so many tears. It’s like the I love you that Cole couldn’t say but should have. Her confrontation with Cole about it – I can get why she’s angry and confused.\n\nCole and his constant denial of feelings – if I was Jackie I woulda slapped him before I kissed him. But lord, I did clap when those two kissed. They’re both confused, but they’re perfect halves of a whole that they can find themselves in. It’s scary and it’s calming.\n\nAnd it’s a new feeling for both.\n\nWhile we don’t know everything that happened with Cole and Jackie after the kiss, I do know I am committed to finding out.\n\nREADY TO FLY\n\nLook, I don’t think that Jackie has been ready on any level for romance, because she’s still grieving. She’s still learning how to live without her sister and parents. She’s beginning a new chapter. And that’s been confusing.\n\nBut while she exists in a complicated life, it’s kinda crazy to me that she’s forgotten to live. She’s forgotten that her family would want her to achieve everything that she wants to. Her family would want her to live.\n\nRunning isn’t the way to always go, but I get the inclination.\n\nThe wedding may have brought happiness to some, but for Jackie, it brought her more confusion.\n\nOTHER THOUGHTS\n\nParker not wanting to wear the dress, I get it. Her worrying about her brothers making fun of her – I get it. But I love that Jackie was able to talk to her.\n\nParker and the converse. I am about that.\n\nI need Tara and Uncle Richard to end up together\n\nI really need Tara and Uncle Richard together. I don’t want her with the other guy.\n\nAlex blaming cole – maybe he should take some responsibility for himself too. He was out of line.\n\nJackie leaving the tea kettle – WHY!!!!\n\nThe “i’m sorry” note – kills me\n\nJackies look of pain on the airplane and Danny’s look of confusion.\n\nRichard in the middle seat will forever make me LOL.\n\nOur reviews are below –"
