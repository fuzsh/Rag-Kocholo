        "text": "In the United States, for most of the history of broadcasting, there were only three or four major commercial national terrestrial networks. From 1946 to 1956, these were ABC, CBS, NBC and DuMont (though the Paramount Television Network had some limited success during these years). From 1956 to 1986, the \"Big Three\" national commercial networks were ABC, CBS, and NBC (with a few limited attempts to challenge them, such as National Telefilm Associates [and its NTA Film Network] and the Overmyer Network). From 1954 to 1970, National Educational Television was the national clearinghouse for public TV programming; the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) succeeded it in 1970.\n\nToday, more than fifty national free-to-air networks exist. Other than the non-commercial educational (NCE) PBS, which is composed of member stations, the largest terrestrial television networks are the traditional Big Three television networks (ABC, CBS and NBC). Many other large networks exist, however, notably Fox and The CW which air original programming for two hours each night instead of three like the original \"Big Three\" do, as well as MyNetworkTV, which feature reruns of recent popular shows with little to no original programming, and Ion Television, which has had the same format since around 2007 but has started to pursue sports properties. Fox has just about the same household reach percentage as the Big Three, and is therefore often considered a peer to ABC, CBS, and NBC since it has also achieved equal or better ratings since the late 1990s; as of 2019, it also programs the equivalent amount of sports programming as the Big Three. Most media outlets now include Fox in what they refer to as the \"Big Four\" TV networks.\n\nThe transition to digital broadcasting in 2009 has allowed for television stations to offer additional programming options through digital subchannels, one or more supplementary programming streams to the station's primary channel that are achieved through multiplexing of a station's signal. A number of new commercial networks airing specialty programming such as movies, reruns of classic series and lifestyle programs have been created from companies like Weigel Broadcasting, Sinclair Broadcast Group and even owners of the major networks such as Fox Corporation (through the Fox Entertainment subsidiary), Paramount Global (through the CBS Media Ventures subsidiary), The Walt Disney Company (through the Walt Disney Television subsidiary) and Comcast (through the NBCUniversal subsidiary). Through the use of multicasting, there have also been a number of new Spanish-language and non-commercial public TV networks that have launched.\n\nFree-to-air networks in the U.S. can be divided into five categories:\n\nCommercial networks – which air English-language programming to a general audience (for example, ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox);\n\nSpanish-language networks – fully programmed networks which air Spanish-language programming to a primarily Latin American audience (for example, Telemundo and Univision);\n\nEducational and other non-commercial broadcast networks – which air English- and some foreign-language television programming, intended to be educational in nature or otherwise of a sort not found on commercial television (for example, PBS);\n\nReligious broadcast networks – which air religious study and other faith-based programs, and in some cases, family-oriented secular programs (for example, Daystar and TBN).\n\nShopping networks – which air live presentations of various products intended to be sold directly to the viewer (for example, HSN and QVC).\n\nEach network sends its signal to many local affiliate television stations across the country. These local stations then air the \"network feed\", with programs broadcast by each network being viewed by up to tens of millions of households across the country. In the case of the largest networks, the signal is sent to over 200 stations. In the case of the smallest networks, the signal may be sent to just a dozen or fewer stations.\n\nAs of the 2016–17 television season, there are an estimated 118.4 million households in the U.S. with at least one TV set.[1]\n\nNBC (owned by Comcast)\n\nCBS (owned by Paramount)\n\nABC (owned by Disney)\n\nFox (owned by Fox Corporation)\n\nMyNetworkTV (owned by Fox Corporation)\n\nThe CW (co-owned by Nexstar Media Group - 75% & Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount Global - 12.5% each)\n\nThe CW Plus\n\nTelemundo (owned by Comcast)\n\nUnivision (owned by TelevisaUnivision)\n\nUniMás (owned by TelevisaUnivision)\n\nEstrella TV (owned by Estrella Media)\n\nPBS (cooperative public television network)\n\nAll of the networks listed below operate a number of terrestrial TV stations. In addition, several of these networks are also aired on pay television services.\n\nAmerican Broadcasting Company (ABC) – The nation's third-largest commercial network, ABC was originally formed from the NBC Blue Network (1927–1945), a radio network which the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) forced NBC (National Broadcasting Company) to sell in 1943 for anti-monopoly reasons, the ABC-TV network began broadcasting in 1948. Owned by The Walt Disney Company, ABC airs original programming, sports, and news seven days a week. It has over 200 owned-and-operated and affiliate stations, almost all of which air local newscasts.\n\nCBS (originally the Columbia Broadcasting System) – The nation's second-largest commercial network, it originated as the CBS Radio Network in 1927; the CBS-TV network commenced broadcasts in 1941. Owned now by Paramount Global, CBS airs original programming, sports and news seven days a week. The network has over 200 owned-and-operated and affiliate stations, almost all of which air local newscasts. For most of its existence, CBS has been the nation's most watched network.\n\nNational Broadcasting Company (NBC) – The nation's largest and oldest commercial network, the NBC-TV network was formed out of the NBC Red Network radio service, which launched in 1926; the network commenced television broadcasts in 1939. Owned by NBCUniversal, NBC airs original programming, sports and news seven days a week. It has over 200 owned-and-operated and affiliate stations, almost all of which air local newscasts.\n\nFox Broadcasting Company (Fox) – The nation's fourth-largest commercial network owned by Fox Corporation, Fox was launched in October 1986 through former parent News Corporation's purchase of Metromedia earlier that year (two of the network's owned-and-operated stations once owned by that group at its founding had formed the hub of the old DuMont Television Network, which existed from 1944 to 1956) and the purchase of the 20th Century Fox film studio, originally established in 1915 as Fox Film Corporation by William Fox and 20th Century Pictures founded 1933 and merged into Fox Film in 1935, five years after founder Fox lost control. After a half-century of up and down success, the studio now by Fox Corporation with Australian and later British and American newspaper chain mogul Rupert Murdoch who had bought into the studio in 1985. Fox airs first-run programming and sports seven days a week, programming two hours each night in primetime (three hours on Sundays), along with political talk program Fox News Sunday on Sunday mornings and the optional infomercial block Weekend Marketplace on Saturday mornings. (Fox also allows affiliates the option to air the Xploration Station block on Saturday mornings in place of Weekend Marketplace.) It has nearly 200 owned-and-operated and affiliate stations, almost all of which air local newscasts, with some producing newscasts in-house and others airing newscasts produced by a local affiliate of another major network.\n\nThe CW – The CW was originally formed by CBS Corporation (which later merged with Viacom to create ViacomCBS, now Paramount Global) and Time Warner (later WarnerMedia, which eventually merged with Discovery Inc. to form Warner Bros. Discovery) as a replacement for The WB and UPN, both of which folded in September 2006 after 11 years of existence and whose programs formed most of its initial schedule. Nexstar Media Group, the largest owner of television stations in the country, bought a 75% stake and controlling interest in the network in 2022; Paramount Global and Warner Bros. Discovery each retain a 12.5% stake. The CW maintains approximately 100 owned-and-operated and affiliate stations in the top 100 television markets; it also has approximately 90 additional cable-only and digital subchannel affiliations in smaller TV markets through a programming service feed known as The CW Plus. The network airs two hours of first-run programming in primetime on Monday through Sunday, as well as a three-hour children's programming block on Saturday mornings called One Magnificent Morning and some sports coverage on weekends. Unlike the larger networks, The CW does not directly own its flagship station in New York City; WPIX is instead owned by Mission Broadcasting and operated under a LMA by Nexstar. The CW also does not have a owned-and-operated station in Chicago due to an existing affiliation contract with WCIU-TV, with Nexstar owning independent station WGN-TV (which disaffiliated with the network in 2016 under previous ownership interests, but will return to the network on September 1, 2024). Some CW affiliates air local newscasts, most of which are produced by another station in the market though four of its affiliates (most owned by Nexstar) produce local newscasts in-house, and some Nexstar-owned stations carry additional content from sister cable news channel News Nation.\n\nMyNetworkTV – MyNetworkTV is a programming service owned by Fox Corporation, which is also parent of the Fox network. It was hastily formed in February 2006 to provide programming for stations left out of affiliation with The CW, after CBS Corporation and Time Warner chose to shut down UPN and The WB to form that network. The network launched in September 2006 with a format of English-language telenovelas, but gradually switched to mainly low-budget programming by the end of its first year. Since it converted from a TV network into a programming service in 2009, MyNetworkTV fills its two-hour primetime schedule on Monday through Fridays with reruns of drama series that originated on other broadcast and cable networks. Some MyNetworkTV affiliates air local newscasts, most of which are produced by another station in the market though three of its affiliates (most owned by Nexstar) produce local newscasts in-house. Some affiliates also carry the nightly scheduled out of primetime to accommodate those newscasts and alternate programming (or in the case of several affiliates are primary Fox affiliates), and offer MyNetworkTV as a late night offering instead. For the Fox Television Stations group, most of its stations now brand as a \"Plus\" station of the larger Fox O&O station if part of a duopoly.\n\nIon Television – Ion Television (originally known as Pax TV from 1998 to 2005, i: Independent Television from 2005 to 2007) is a mid-sized network owned by the Scripps Networks subsidiary of the E. W. Scripps Company; it airs off-network repeats of recent television series (usually a daily block of one series) for eighteen hours per day, along with sports, most notably women's sports, including the WNBA basketball on Friday nights and NWSL soccer on Saturdays. Ion is the largest English-language network that is responsible for handling nearly all programming on behalf of its affiliates, some of which run some limited local programming and overflow programming from Scripps sister stations in the same market. It has around 48 owned-and-operated and 23 affiliated stations, the majority of which were owned by former parent Ion Media; Ion is available in markets without an over-the-air (OTA) affiliate via a national feed that is distributed to pay-television providers and AVOD streaming services, along with a group of stations spun out to a separately-owned Ion-only broadcast group, Inyo Broadcast Holdings. As Pax TV and i, it aired several hours a week of original programming in primetime (often produced in conjunction with NBC).\n\nMeTV (a backronym for \"Memorable Entertainment Television\") – MeTV is a network owned by Weigel Broadcasting that airs reruns of classic series from the 1950s to the 1990s sourced primarily from the CBS Media Ventures, NBCUniversal Syndication Studios and Warner Bros.

The network maintains over 160 affiliates (mainly through digital subchannel affiliations, with a small number of stations carrying it as a primary network affiliation), making it the most widely distributed multicast network, and often out-rating programming on The CW despite its much smaller original programming division.\n\nMeTV+ - MeTV's sister network also owned by Weigel Broadcasting that airs more reruns of classic series from the 1950s to the 1990s from the CBS Media Ventures, NBCUniversal Syndication Studios, Sony Pictures Television, and Disney Platform Distribution program libraries, also with some limited content from Weigel.
