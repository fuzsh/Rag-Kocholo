        "text": "Having family and friends living in London and the South East of England, I was looking for a way to save money on my train journey when visiting them. Luckily, I’ve found the Network Railcard – paying just £30, I can use my Railcard for one year to get 1/3 off most rail fares for journeys in the Network Railcard area, which includes even Exeter and Kings Lynn!\n\nFor example, I used to pay up to £30 for a return ticket when travelling to Canterbury, I can now save up to £10 with my Network Railcard. I don’t just use my Railcard to save on rail travel though – I use it to get discounts on bus travel to and from the station, as well as ferries to the Isle of Wight, what’s not to like?\n\nBuying a Railcard with Trainline is super simple too. You just need to provide your first and last name and a passport-style photo, then you can download your Railcard to the Trainline app to use it straightaway – no paper, no fuss!\n\nIf you’re travelling frequently to London and the South East area, a Network Railcard is definitely worth it!\n\nAbout Paola\n\nPaola is one of our trusted, hand-picked travel writers. The information for this article was recorded first-hand, based on her own genuine experience of the journey."
