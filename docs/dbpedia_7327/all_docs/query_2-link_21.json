        "text": "Yes. The Army encourages Soldiers and their families to stay in touch whenever possible. During deployment, you’ll have access to various services that allow Soldiers to contact their loved ones including phones, video phones, email, social media, military networks, and a mail system.\n\nSoldiers’ spouses and dependents can live on base with them in family housing. Parents, extended family, and friends cannot live on base but are welcome to visit. While visiting family members and friends cannot stay overnight in the barracks, there are on-base accommodations for them. You can spend the night with them, if you choose.\n\nThe Army does not allow spouses or family members to join Soldiers during deployment. However, the Army has a strong network of resources to provide support for families while the Soldier in their lives is deployed.\n\nThe Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP) is a mandatory enrollment program that works with other military and civilian agencies to provide comprehensive and coordinated community support, housing, educational, medical, and personnel services to families with special needs. Soldiers on active duty enroll in the program when they have a family member with a physical, emotional, developmental, or intellectual condition requiring specialized services, so their needs can be considered when being assigned a duty location."
