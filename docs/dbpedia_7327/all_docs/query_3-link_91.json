        "text": "Disclaimer: When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.\n\nIn today's very crowded streaming TV landscape, Hulu + Live TV — which includes both Hulu's own massive library of content as well as access to everything on Disney+ on top of 95+ channels of live television — might be the best option available in terms of how much stuff you get for you monthly fee.\n\nBelow, we'll fill you in on the basics of Hulu + Live TV, including package options, the Hulu channels list, and how the platform stacks up against its competitors. We'll also answer frequently asked questions like, \"how can I find a list of channels on Hulu for my area?\" and \"how do I sign up for Hulu + Live TV?\"\n\nWhat is Hulu + Live TV?\n\nHulu + Live TV is a contract-free alternative to traditional cable. With your subscription, you'll be able to stream and record live TV and access Hulu's extensive catalog of on-demand programming (including Hulu Originals).\n\nYou can watch Hulu + Live TV on all types of devices, including smartphones, tablets, laptops, streaming sticks (we're looking at you, Roku and Amazon Fire TV Sticks), and gaming consoles. Certain programs are available to download for offline viewing, depending on your plan.\n\nThere are two plans available: Hulu + Live TV and Hulu (No Ads) + Live TV. The Hulu + Live TV plan includes more than 95+ live and on-demand channels, Hulu's catalog of on-demand content, and bundled access to Disney+ and ESPN+ starting at $77/month. This tier also comes with 50 hours of cloud DVR storage, so you can record your favorite shows, movies, and sporting events.\n\nIf you prefer an ad-free Hulu streaming experience, you can upgrade to Hulu (No Ads) + Live TV for $90/month. It comes with everything in the Hulu + Live TV plan — just without the commercials for most on-demand titles. You can also download select titles for offline viewing in case you're in a no Wi-Fi zone like an airplane or subway.\n\nUsers can customize any of the live Hulu plans with add-ons, including extra DVR storage, access to premium networks, and unlimited screens.\n\nDoes Hulu + Live TV have a free trial or other discounts?\n\nYes, there is a free trial for Hulu + Live TV. New (and some returning) subscribers can get three days for free in order to see if Hulu + Live TV is right for them. This will also get free three-day access to Hulu, ESPN+, and Disney+. Hulu also offers one week and one month free trials for other subscription options, but this does not include the Live TV element.\n\nHulu + Live TV Channel List\n\nWondering what channels are on Hulu?

As a subscriber, you'll get networks like CBS Sports, ESPN, ESPNEWS, FS1, and NFL Network in your Hulu channel lineup.\n\nDepending on where you live, you might have access to a regional sports network in your area, like NBC Sports Bay Area or NBC Sports Chicago. When you sign up with Hulu, you'll designate a \"home network\" that will determine your location and which of these channels you receive. If your physical location is outside of your home network, you may be able to watch local channels in your current location. Some games may be subject to blackout restrictions, depending on the league's broadcast agreements and your device.\n\nIt's important to note that Hulu does not have an agreement with every regional sports network. Some notable exclusions include Bally Sports (formerly Fox Sports Networks), Marquee Sports Network, and NESN (New England Sports Network).\n\nLocal Channels with Hulu + Live TV\n\nLocal channel availability with Hulu + Live TV will depend on your physical location. In certain markets, you'll be able to watch every local network (including ABC, CBS, FOX, and NBC) — unless there's a blackout on a particular program.\n\nPremium Channels on Hulu + Live TV\n\nHulu + Live TV allows you to upgrade your plan with premium channels like HBO and SHOWTIME, and these also include access to their standalone streaming services. So getting HBO will give you access to Max, and SHOWTIME will give you access to Paramount+ with SHOWTIME, even while HBO and SHOWTIME's content is also available within Hulu.\n\nMax: $16/month\n\nCinemax: $10/month\n\nParamount+ with SHOWTIME: $12/month\n\nSTARZ: $10/month\n\nAdd-On Channels and Packages\n\nHulu gives subscribers the option of adding extra channels with premium add-ons and channel packages. Here are your Hulu add-on options.\n\nEntertainment Add-On: $8/month\n\nAmerican Heroes Channel\n\nBET Her\n\nBoomerang Channel\n\nCNBC World\n\nCooking Channel\n\nCrime + Investigation\n\nDestination America\n\nDiscovery Family\n\nDiscovery Life\n\nHallmark Drama\n\nMilitary History Channel\n\nNicktoons\n\nMTV2\n\nMTV Classic\n\nScience\n\nTeenNick\n\nSports Add-On: $10/month\n\nFanDuel Racing\n\nFanDuel TV\n\nMAVTV\n\nNFL RedZone\n\nOutdoor Channel\n\nSportsmann Channel\n\nStrike Zone\n\nTennis Channel\n\nEspañol add-on: $5/month\n\nCNN en Español\n\nDiscovery en Español\n\nDiscovery Familia\n\nESPN Deportes\n\nFOX Deportes\n\nHistory Channel en Español\n\nHogar de HGTV\n\nNBC Universo\n\nThe Weather Channel en Español\n\nHow Do Hulu + Live TV Channels Compare?\n\nNot sure if Hulu + Live TV is the right streaming platform for you? It might help to compare it to other popular services like YouTube TV, Fubo, DIRECTV STREAM, and Sling TV. Here's how the Hulu TV channels compare to other platforms.\n\nFor Entertainment Channels\n\nHulu + Live TV offers a well-rounded selection of entertainment and lifestyle channels, including Animal Planet, Bravo, Comedy Central, History Channel, and TLC. The service also gives you access to a long list of Hulu Originals, such as Only Murders in the Buildingand Nine Perfect Strangers. As mentioned and like most other live TV streaming services, Hulu also has an option to add premium networks like Max and STARZ for an additional monthly fee.\n\nFor Sports Fans\n\nYou'll get a good mix of sports channels with your Hulu + Live TV subscription, enabling you to watch the NFL, NBA, MLB, and college sports. On top of that, your Hulu + Live TV plan also comes with free access to ESPN+ and the ability to purchase more sports channels with the Sports Add-on.\n\nThe channel lineup is similar to what you'll find with providers like YouTube TV and Fubo. However, DIRECTV STREAM offers more regional sports networks than Hulu + Live TV, which makes it a better pick for some sports fans, depending on where you live and which sports you're interested in.\n\nFor Kids\n\nKid-friendly channels like Cartoon Network, Disney Channel, Nickelodeon, and more are included in the Hulu + Live TV channel list. This makes it comparable to most other services, except for Sling TV — which has significantly fewer options for children. You'll also get original content including Trolls: TrollsTopia, Animaniacs, Holly Hobbie, and The Bravest Knight which can't be found anywhere other than Hulu. Also, we mentioned that you'll get Disney+ for free with this subscription service, right? Right. You already know that one will come in handy.\n\nOverall Value for the Price\n\nIn terms of price, Hulu + Live TV is on par with YouTube TV, Fubo, and DIRECTV STREAM. The channel lineups for the services are comparable, but Hulu offers original content that can't be found on other services. Hulu + Live TV is more expensive than Sling TV and \"skinny bundles\" like Philo but has significantly more content.\n\nDoes Hulu + Live TV's Channel List Beat the Rest?\n\nIt's easy to see why Hulu + Live TV is one of the most popular streaming services. Not only does it have a deep and diverse selection of live channels, but it also features one of the most extensive streaming libraries available, exclusive access to Hulu content, and complimentary access to Disney+ and ESPN+.
