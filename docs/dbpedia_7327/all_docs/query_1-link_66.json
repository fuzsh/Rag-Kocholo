Retrieved 9 October 2007.] [ [http://dish.client.shareholder.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=305526 DISH Network Expands National HD Line-Up] ]\n\nToday\n\nThe network is owned by NBC Universal along with similar sister channel Bravo. This station rivals with the A&E Network. USA also shows some sports coverage, such as select golf tournament, the annual Westminster Kennel Club dog show, and the United States Open (tennis), which will move to ESPN2 & the Tennis Channel as of 2009 [cite web |url= http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/news/story?id=3391641|title= U.S. Open to be carried on ESPN2, ESPN360.com starting in 2009|accessdate=2008-09-04 |date= 2008-05-12 |publisher= ESPN] . Since 2004, they have broadcast portions of the Olympic Games, along with many other NBC Universal basic cable channels. Previously, it had a weekly boxing show named \"USA Tuesday Night Fights\", which ran for 17 years. USA was also the home of World Wrestling Entertainment (then called the World Wrestling Federation or WWF)'s flagship cable TV shows from the channel's launch until September 2000, and currently since October 2005. Each April from 1982–2007, USA broadcast the opening two rounds of the The Masters Tournament along with high-definition coverage on Universal HD. The coverage switched to ESPN in 2008.\n\nOnce a minor player in basic cable, the network has steadily gained popularity because of breakout hits like the detective series \"Monk\", the fake psychic crime-solving series \"Psych\", the covert-operations spy series \"Burn Notice\", the return of \"WWE Raw\", the science fiction mini-series turned regular series \"The 4400\", and the Stephen King–based psychic series \"The Dead Zone\". Reruns of ', ', and \"NCIS\" are also frequently shown. Other syndicated programs on the network include \"Becker\", \"House\", \"JAG\", \"Wings\" and \"Walker, Texas Ranger\". The network also broadcasts a variety of films from the Universal Studios library.\n\nNBC Universal announced before NBC released their 2007–08 fall schedule on May 13, 2007 that \"Criminal Intent\" would be renewed for a seventh season. However, the new episodes of the series would premiere on USA beginning in fall 2007, with episodes repeating later in the season on NBC, most likely to shore up any programming holes created by a failed series. Although this is not the first time a broadcast series has moved to cable (as early as 1987, NBC's revival of \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\" moved to USA Network), it is a first in that a series which moved to cable will continue to show episodes on a broadcast network during its first-run era [ [http://nbcumv.com/release_detail.nbc/entertainment-20070513000000-allthree034law.html All Three 'Law & Order'- Branded Series Will Continue On The Networks Of Nbc Universal ] ] . On December 7, 2007, it was announced that USA Network would continue broadcasting first-run episodes of \"WWE Monday Night Raw\" until 2010. [Weprin, Alex.

The show was filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The series debuted June 1, 2008 with some fairly high ratings. It became USA's highest-rated series premiere since the premiere of \"Psych\" in 2006 with 5.3 million viewers.

However, because of programming rights issues in Canada, certain programs would be subjected to blackout, including \"WWE Raw\". [ [http://www.channelcanada.com/Article1744.html CHANNEL CANADA :: USA Network Could Be Coming To Canada ] ] In September 2007, the commission refused Shaw Communications' request to carry USA Network into Canada because it had too much programming that overlapped with Mystery TV. Mystery TV is an English language digital cable specialty channel that is owned by CanWest MediaWorks Inc. and Groupe TVA.
