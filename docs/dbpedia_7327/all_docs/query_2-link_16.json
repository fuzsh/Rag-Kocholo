        "text": "What to Consider\n\n+ -\n\nAvailability\n\nSome of these services are only available in certain locations, or offer different channels depending on your location. Enter your zip code on their websites to find out more about what's available for you.\n\n+ -\n\nPrice\n\nSince many people looking to cut the cord are aiming to save money, you'll want to consider how much you'll be spending each month on a live TV streaming service -- especially if you're already subscribed to other VoD streaming services like Netflix.\n\n+ -\n\nChannel options\n\nWhile most of the live TV streaming services on this list include similar cable channels, some don't include local channels, others don't include sports channels, and all require additional fees to access premium cable channels like Max, Starz, and Showtime. You'll want to consider what shows you want access to when choosing a service.\n\n+ -\n\nDVR storage\n\nAll of the live TV streaming services on this list include some form of digital video recording (DVR) storage, so you can record live shows to watch at your convenience (and fast forward through commercials). However, they range widely, from just 50 hours of storage to unlimited storage.\n\n+ -\n\nUser experience\n\nIf you're making the switch from cable, you'll want to have a user-friendly live TV streaming service that's easy to navigate. Many of these services offer free trials, so if you're interested in testing them out, you can.\n\nPeacock | Best service for streaming the Olympics overall\n\nPeacock\n\nBest service for streaming the Olympics overall\n\nView now View at Peacock\n\nExpressVPN | Best VPN for streaming the Olympics\n\nExpressVPN\n\nBest VPN for streaming the Olympics\n\nView now View at ExpressVPN\n\nDirecTV Stream | Upscale your games watching from HDTV to 4K\n\nDirecTV Stream\n\nUpscale your games watching from HDTV to 4K\n\nView now View at Directv\n\nFubo | Get 4K video content included\n\nFubo\n\nGet 4K video content included\n\nView now View at Fubo\n\nHulu + Live TV | All the stations you need for $77 a month\n\nHulu + Live TV\n\nAll the stations you need for $77 a month\n\nView now View at Hulu\n\nSling TV | The most affordable full streaming service for the games\n\nSling TV\n\nThe most affordable full streaming service for the games\n\nView now View at Sling\n\nYouTube TV | The most channels you can get for $73 a month\n\nYouTube TV\n\nThe most channels you can get for $73 a month\n\nView now View at YouTube TV\n\nShow more (2 items)\n\nThe 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris are well underway, and for those who have cut the cord, there are plenty of ways to catch all the action without a traditional cable or satellite TV subscription.\n\nAlso: The best live TV streaming services\n\nWhere can I watch the Olympics?\n\nThe Olympics officially opened on Friday, July 26, 2024, at noon Eastern time -- 6 p.m. Central European Time (CET) -- in Paris with a ceremony on the River Seine. Some events, such as handball, rugby, and soccer, began earlier that week. The Games will feature 16 days of competition, ending on August 11, with around 10,500 athletes from over 200 nations competing.\n\nNBCUniversal plans to provide at least nine hours of daytime coverage of the Summer Games' most exciting events. Altogether, NBC hopes to present 5,000 hours of live coverage from all 329 medal events. This will include live coverage of swimming, gymnastics, and track and field finals. The major events will be shown on NBC and Telemundo between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. ET. Olympics coverage will preempt all other shows. Other events will be carried on the USA Network, Golf Channel, CNBC, and E!. For Spanish speakers, check out Telemundo, and Universo.\n\nWith an over-the-air (OTA) antenna, you can watch many sports on NBC and Telemundo for free. This is a great option if you live in range of a broadcast tower. You can also watch the opening and closing ceremonies, some medal ceremonies, and highlights for free on the NBC Olympics website.\n\nAlso: The best TV antennas\n\nIf you're outside the US and want to specifically watch NBC's coverage, you may need to use a VPN to stream the Olympic Games. ExpressVPN is our tested pick for the best VPN for streaming.\n\nAlso: Can I stream the Olympics with a VPN? Yes. Here's how\n\nParis is six hours ahead of the United States' Eastern Time Zone. That means most major events will happen in the morning and afternoon for US viewers. The network will also show a three-hour Olympics prime-time show every evening. NBC promises that Paris 2024 will have more programming hours on the NBC broadcast network than any previous Olympics.\n\nWhile the games will be produced in high-dynamic-range 4K video, it's unclear how much of that 4K video will be broadcast in the US, either on OTA or Peacock.\n\nHere's ZDNET's comprehensive guide to watching the 2024 Paris Olympics, ensuring you don't miss a moment of the excitement.\n\nBest live TV streaming services for the Summer Paris 2024 Olympics\n\nShow less\n\nPeacock\n\nBest service for streaming the Olympics overall\n\nThe best way to watch the Olympics will likely be by streaming on Peacock for $7.99 per month (that price went up $2 per month in July, but Peacock is still the best way to watch the Olympics).\n\nWith Peacock, you can stream all 329 medal events live. To help you watch, Peacock will offer features such as Live Actions, which lets you set prompts to jump to new activities, and Discovery Multiview, which allows you to stream four sports simultaneously. You can also create a viewing schedule, search by sport or athlete, and keep updated with all the medals and awards.\n\nPeacock Live Actions is an innovative interactive feature that empowers viewers to customize their Olympic viewing experience during live and prime-time broadcasts. This tool lets you seamlessly switch between different events based on your preferences.\n\nPeacock Live Actions is particularly evident in programs like Gold Zone. This live whip-around show provides continuous coverage from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET. While watching Gold Zone, you can use on-screen prompts to opt for continued viewing of a specific event's live feed rather than following the Gold Zone coverage.\n\nAdditionally, Peacock Live Actions enhances the NBC Primetime simulcast experience by allowing you to add upcoming events to your \"My Stuff\" list for later viewing. Complementing Live Actions is Peacock Discovery Multiview. This offers a four-view experience to help you navigate the most significant events. With up to 40 live events co-occurring, this tool provides real-time on-screen descriptions from NBCU's Olympic experts, highlighting crucial moments such as medal events, elimination risks, or first-time Olympian performances.\n\nPeacock will also offer another multiview option for a few sports, such as soccer, track & field, and wrestling, enabling you to watch up to four matches on one screen. This will work somewhat like the NFL Sunday Ticket does for American football. Both Multiview options enable you to switch between screens, change audio, and access full-screen views for a more immersive experience.\n\nIn addition, Peacock will be offering a host of other improvements. These include:\n\nA \"Browse by Sport\" option lets you quickly find all live events, highlights, and replays for your favorite competitions. You can quickly jump between sports via top-of-screen navigation.\n\nA new \"Search by Star Athlete\" feature lets you more easily follow your favorite athletes through the Games. This includes tracking them whether they are an individual competitor or part of a team sport. As in previous Olympics, you can also search by sport, event, and team, including country names and three-letter country codes.\n\nAn enhanced Interactive Schedule lets you plan your Olympics viewing day-by-day, join events live, watch replays, or add events to your \"My Stuff\" to watch later.\n\nUp-to-date Medal Standings help you keep track of every country competing in Paris.\n\nPeacock's award-winning \"Catch Up with Key Plays,\" which lets you easily access key moments when joining an in-progress game or revisit your favorite plays, will now be available for basketball and golf, in addition to soccer.\n\nThe only possible problem is that Peacock doesn't offer a cloud DVR to basic subscribers. Replays of the most important events and happenings will be offered. With Peacock Premium Plus, which is $13.99 per month, subscribers can download and save some live event content to watch offline later. To do this, click the content's tile and the Add to Watchlist button on the details page. The content will then appear in the \"My Stuff\" section or in \"Featured\" under a row labeled \"My Stuff.\"\n\nIn addition, the Premium Plus plan promises to be ad-free. Most live sporting TV broadcasts still have ads, so I presume the Olympics will too.\n\nShow Expert Take Show less\n\nShow less\n\nPros\n\nStrong commitment to privacy and transparency\n\nForward-thinking security enhancements\n\nExcellent for streaming\n\nStreamlined, easy-to-use app across platforms\n\nPrivacy-friendly jurisdiction (British Virgin Islands)\n\nCons\n\nDNS leaks detected (but immediately addressed)\n\nExpensive\n\nOnly eight simultaneous connections\n\nApple TV app needs work\n\nLatest Tests DNS leaks detected, 25% speed loss in 2024 tests\n\nNetwork 3,000 plus servers in 105 countries\n\nJurisdiction British Virgin Islands\n\nExpressVPN\n\nBest VPN for streaming the Olympics\n\nIf you want to stream the US coverage of the Olympic games outside of the country, you'll need to use a virtual private network (VPN). Our tested pick for the best VPN for streaming is ExpressVPN, thanks to its consistently fast speeds, quick connections, and few buffering issues. The company has also introduced a number of security improvements, including an ad blocker.\n\nShow Expert Take Show less\n\nShow less\n\nDirecTV Stream\n\nUpscale your games watching from HDTV to 4K\n\nRecently, DirecTV Stream didn't offer the NBC channels due to a contract dispute. Fortunately, the Olympic channels you need to watch the games -- CNBC, NBC, NBCSN, Olympics Channel, and USA -- are back now, even on its lowest-price level, the $79.99 Entertainment package.\n\nIn addition, DirecTV Stream includes generous unlimited cloud DVR storage. With it, you can keep as many DVR recordings as you'd like for up to nine months.\n\nYou can watch the game or any other show on up to 20 streaming devices simultaneously on your home network. Away from home, you can share your stream with three other devices.\n\nDirecTV has one unique feature. You can \"upscale\" some sports events to 4K and manually adjust the content to \"Best,\" \"Better,\" or \"Good\" across devices. I don't recommend this approach -- when I tried it, I saw streaming slowdowns and odd video artifacts.\n\nShow Expert Take Show less\n\nShow less\n\nFubo\n\nGet 4K video content included\n\nFubo is best known for its sports coverage, but it's also a full-fledged streaming service with all the usual networks, including the ones that matter the most for the games -- CNBC, NBC, NBCSN, the Olympic Channel, and USA.\n\nFubo's starter plan, Pro, has 183 channels and 1,000 hours of cloud DVR storage. For $74.99 per month, you can stream up to 10 screens on your home network and three screens simultaneously away from home. Fubo's one big plus is that it offers 4K streaming as part of its base package.\n\nFubo's other packages -- Elite for $89.99 and Premier for $99.99 -- include additional channels. The streaming service also offers a week-long free trial.\n\nAll Fubo plans come with unlimited cloud DVR space at no extra charge. You can stream on up to 10 devices simultaneously on your home network, plus three streams outside your home.\n\nShow Expert Take Show less\n\nShow less\n\nHulu + Live TV\n\nAll the stations you need for $77 a month\n\nHulu + Live TV offers an attractive combination of on-demand video and live TV for $83 per month. For Olympics watchers, it offers your local NBC channel, CNBC, NBCSN, the Olympics Channel, and USA.\n\nHulu also offers enhanced cloud DVR, increasing the available DVR storage from 50 hours to 200 hours. That should prove very handy for the Games. In addition, you can store an unlimited number of videos in your cloud DVR archive for up to nine months.\n\nWith the Unlimited Screens package, you can watch the games on unlimited concurrent streams in your home with up to three outside for an additional $9.99 per month. The service comes with a three-day free trial.\n\nShow Expert Take Show less\n\nShow less\n\nSling TV\n\nThe most affordable full streaming service for the games\n\nI like Sling TV's à la carte approach to channels. I enjoy picking and choosing channels, but I know some people find it more confusing than useful. That said, for the Olympics, you might be able to get by with Sling Blue, which costs $45 per month.\n\nIt takes digging, but Sling TV offers NBC and USA in \"select areas.\" Which ones? Good question. This page will let you see what's available, but it doesn't explain the logic. For example, it tells me I can't get FOX, NBC, or ABC even though they are available OTA in my area.\n\nIf you're considering Sling TV, you need to look at the above-mentioned page if you want to watch the Games.\n\nFor CNBC, you'll need to pay $6 per month for a News Extra add-on, and you'll find the Olympics Channel on the $11-per-month Sports Extra package. NBC Sports is not included in any Sling TV package.\n\nSling TV's default cloud DVR offers 50 hours for free. You can upgrade to 200 hours for $5 per month. The video is shown in 720p. With a Sling Orange plan, you can only watch a single stream, and with Sling Blue, you can watch shows on three devices simultaneously. Combined, you can stream your shows on up to four devices.\n\nShow Expert Take Show less\n\nShow less\n\nYouTube TV\n\nThe most channels you can get for $73 a month\n\nWith over 100 channels, YouTube TV offers more popular channels than its competitors, and costs $72.99 per month. It includes all the relevant channels: NBC, USA Network, CNBC, and more.\n\nBy CNET's count, out of the top 100 live TV networks, YouTube TV offers the most channels, 78, of any streaming service. YouTubeTV's DVR is also outstanding. With it, you can record as many shows as you like. The only restriction is that they'll disappear after nine months. I can live with that.\n\nFor 4K, you'll need to pay extra for the $9.99 4K Plus add-on. This also gives you unlimited simultaneous streams and allows offline DVR viewing.\n\nShow Expert Take Show less\n\nCan I stream the Olympics from outside the US?\n\nYes, you'll be able to watch the US overage of the Games outside the country, but no matter which service you use, you'll need a virtual private network (VPN). That's because NBC only has the rights to show the games in the US. To bypass these restrictions, you'll need to use the VPN to make it appear as if you're watching the games inside the US. Here's how to use a VPN to stream the Olympics:\n\nDownload and Install a VPN: ZDNET has several recommended streaming VPNs. Personally, I highly recommend NordVPN. ZDNET has named ExpressVPN the best VPN for streaming.\n\nConnect to the Appropriate Server Location: Open the VPN app and select a place in the US.\n\nFinally, go to your streaming service and start watching the Games.\n\nAlso: The best VPN services (and how to choose the right one for you)\n\nOr, if you want to watch using your usual US streaming service, you can stream the game from your home streaming service with most VPNs.\n\nHow to livestream the 2024 Olympics in different countries\n\nAustralia:\n\nIn Oz, you can watch the Olympics on the Nine Network and its streaming brother, 9Now. The Network will have select live coverage of the Olympics, and you can watch on-demand highlights on the network's streaming service, 9Now. For all 329 Olympic events, though, you'll need the pay-TV service Stan Sport will show all 329 Olympic events ad-free. To watch this, you'll need a Stan subscription, starting at AUS$12 a month at the lowest level and then AUS$25 a month for Stan Sport.\n\nCanada:\n\nIn Canada, the Olympics will be broadcast on TV channels CBC, TSN, and Sportsnet. They will be shown on the free CBC Gem streaming service. In addition, TSN and Sportsnet will be showing the Olympics both on TV and via their online subscription services, TSN+ and Sportsnet NOW.\n\nUK:\n\nThe BBC will broadcast the 2024 Games on its free-to-air channels, BBC One and BBC Two. You can also live stream the action from Paris on the BBC iPlayer. If you want to watch more of the games, you'll need Discovery Plus, which offers 3,800 hours of live coverage across 55 channels. Discovery Plus Standard comes free for Sky Q, Sky Glass, and Sky Stream customers. You can also add Discovery Plus Standard to an Amazon Prime Video membership for £6.99 a month.\n\nWhat is the cheapest way to watch the Olympics?\n\nThe least expensive way to watch the games is with an antenna (find my top picks for the best TV antennas here). You can also watch some of the Olympics on the NBC Olympics site.\n\nYou can also get a seven-day free trial from Fubo and YouTube TV, and Hulu Live TV offers a free three-day trial.\n\nIf you can't watch the Games with an antenna and don't subscribe to a streaming service, there is one other cheap way to do it: Get Peacock.\n\nWhen do the Olympics end?\n\nThe 2024 Olympics Closing Ceremony will take place Sunday, Aug. 11, at 2 p.m. ET, or 8 p.m. Paris time.\n\nFor detailed schedules and updates, visit NBC Olympics.com or the official Paris Olympics website. I guarantee the schedules will change, so if there's a sport you follow closely, keep an eye on what's showing and when. Enjoy the Games!\n\nEditorial standards"
