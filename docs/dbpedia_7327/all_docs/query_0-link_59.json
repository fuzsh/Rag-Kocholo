        "text": "When combining the number of charger ports and locations across Level 1, Level 2, and DC fast chargers, ChargePoint ranks well above all other networks and is easily the largest US charging network with 48,946 charging ports at 15,454 site locations. ChargePoint charging ports account for 42.8% of all US public charging ports and 42.9% of all charging locations.\n\nBelow is a sortable table of the major EV charging networks in the US with the number of DC fast chargers (ports) for each, their percent of the total number installed, and their ranking. This data is sourced from the Alternative Fuels Data Center as of December 31, 2021.\n\nAs you can see, the Tesla Supercharge network dominates the US DC fast charging landscape and accounts for 58% of the 21,676 installed fast chargers. When adding the next three largest DC fast charging networks (Electrify America, EVgo, and ChargePoint) — the top four networks account for 88% of all DC fast chargers in the US.\n\n1) Locations: Number of sites where 1 or more charging outlets exists. Source: Alternative Fueling Station Locator– as of December 31, 2021.\n\n2) Ports: Number of individual charging connectors which can charge an EV simultaneously. In some cases charging hardware has more than one connector (port) per charging station but may or may not be able to charge simultaneously. Most of the charging networks now report the number of ports as those which can charge simultaneously. Meaning a DC fast charger that has two connectors, for example, CCS and CHAdeMO, but can only charge one EV simultaneously is counted as “1” port and not “2” ports.
