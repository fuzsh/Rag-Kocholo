If you’ve already cut the cord so to speak, then you no doubt understand that there are countless options to choose from. The key is finding the right fit for your lifestyle.\n\nEndless Entertainment Options\n\nHow To Start Streaming TV\n\nGet an Internet connection of at least 15 mbps\n\nSubscribe to your favorite streaming TV services\n\nDownload the service apps on a streaming device\n\nStart watching your favorite shows and movies\n\nHow Streaming Devices Work\n\nTV streaming devices, such as Roku’s Streaming Stick or Amazon’s Fire TV Stick, plug into your television’s HDMI port and connect to the Internet over your home Wi-Fi network, and they’ll work even if you don’t own a smart TV that connects to the Internet. Each of the streaming devices has their own features and benefits, many of which include favorites like voice-activated remote and DVR. Most of these devices can also plug into USB port to be played on your PC, laptop, or tablet. Best of all, they are easy to unplug and take with you wherever you go.\n\nLive TV Streaming\n\nSome streaming TV customers have a combination of services to fill out their viewing choices. And there are “live TV streaming services” that can essentially take the place of what audiences view on cable. The experiences vary and you need to become familiar with the different apps…but once you get the hang of it, you’ll be sure to keep yourself entertained!"
