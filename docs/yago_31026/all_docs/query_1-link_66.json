        "text": "Soap actress Andrea Evans, known for her roles on The Young and the Restless as Patti Williams, The Bold and the Beautiful as Tawny Moore, Passions as Rebecca Hotchkiss and, most notably, Tina Clayton Lord Roberts on One Life to Live, passed away on July 9th following a battle against cancer.\n\nAndrea began her role of Tina, the conniving, ditzy, comedic half-sister of series protagonist Viki Lord, on One Life to Live in 1979, remaining until 1981. She returned to the role in 1985, her second stint coming to an end in 1990. During her second stint, which netted Andrea a Daytime Emmy nomination, Tina arguably reached her zenith, including famously showing up to the wedding of Cord Roberts, her one true love, to another woman (played by fellow redhead legend Marcia Cross). The most memorable moment of that return begins at around 2:00 in the clip below:\n\nAlthough the character of Tina remained on the canvas for a few years following Andrea's second departure, the One Life to Live fanbase longed for Tina's return, along with Andrea's. In 2008, as part of the series' 40th anniversary, Andrea returned, although her return was maligned. She left the same year. The character and performer made one final return in 2011, before the series ended its network run in 2012. This return was received much better, and ended with Tina and Cord reuniting yet again.\n\nAndrea is survived by a husband and daughter.\n\n<a href=\"https://daytimeconfidential.com/2023/07/10/soap-legend-andrea-evans-dead-at-66\">SOURCE</a>\n\n<i> Andrea Evans very well may be the reason why I have such a fondness for redheads. I don't remember what Tina was doing when I was a child, but I never forgot the gorgeous redheaded Tina. Thank you for sharing your talents, Andrea! Soap fans will miss you! </i>"
