        "text": "Sorry he will always be Brody from OLTL to me…lol but I have to say I just watched the softball game scenes and then the cute scene at the Floating Rib and I’m impressed. Emme and Mark Lawson have AMAZING chemistry. She has the same sparkling blue eyes like him…lol and they were just charming.\n\nUsually some of these new pairing are forced and contrived but it came off just so FUN and sweet!! And I liked them kinda flirting at The Rib. I think GH finally found a good love interest for her. And was it just me or did Maxie look a little miffed watching them flirt?\n\nFordster99, the way I saw Maxie watching Lulu & Dustin, I thought Maxie looked like she was glad Lulu had found someone to take her mind off Dante for a while. I think, now that Maxie knows how bad off Dante is right now, she wants Lulu to sign the divorce papers so she can have peace & start rebuilding her life without Dante. Of course, that’s just MY take on Maxie’s reaction to Lulu & Dustin.\n\nI guess I meant that she is way too involved in Lulu’s life overall. I would much rather see Maxie hanging out with Peter than watching her friend but I get it. I think I am just over Maxie focusing soooo much time on Lulu in the past four months that it almost went over the edge. Hopefully Maxie will just let Lulu live her life. I would love for Lulu and Dustin to have interactions without Maxie being there. Not sure why they do that with those too. Lulu is a thorn in Maxie’s love life and Maxie is always there when Lulu has interactions with Dustin.\n\nI have been thankful that Maxie and Peter have had a couple of moments lately not talking about Lulu. It seems weird that being in a new relationship her focus has been LULU. I would be all over him. He is so hot! lol. I would love for Peter, Maxie and James to do something as a family. We should see them interact with him more. He is over a year now. And I also want to see them plan Nina’s wedding.\n\nThat would have been ideal. Maybe the writers thought that Dom would come back. To have them just have him come back and then leave things in limbo yet again annoyed me to no end. He came back for what two weeks and then was gone again. It would have been better if she thought he died. I have hated everything about that storyline. Its awful. Lulu just needs something.\n\nWow. When Tina walked in carrying Gabrielle Medina’s baby with Max Holden, what a blast from the past.Cord was marrying Kate Sanders from the insane Sanders family.\n\nShocking that FV was the EP of a show that was actually ABC’s top rated soap when they cancelled it. That show was well written, acted and produced. We watch him as EP of GH and wonder how his talent disappeared on this once great soap.\n\nABC pretty muched saved GH as the stand alone when they cancelled OLTL and AMC because it was the longest running soap. The ratings were in the 2.1-2.3 range while GH struggled at a 1.7-1.9 range. I watched both since 1987. I was 12 years old lol. I rember when Tina’s son was a baby and they figured out he survived because he had Type G blood. Later it changed to match Todd and Tina together as siblings ( note to producers we loyalist viewers are a stickler to continuity)."
