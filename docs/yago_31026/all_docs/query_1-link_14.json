        "text": "Andrea Lynn Evans (June 18, 1957 – July 9, 2023) was an American actress and producer. She was most recognized for her portrayal of Tina Lord on the ABC soap opera One Life to Live, a role she played from 1978 to 1981 and from 1985 to 1990, returning in 2008 and 2011. Evans also appeared on The Young and the Restless soap operas as Patty Williams, The Bold and the Beautiful as Tawny Moore, and Passions as Rebecca Hotchkiss.\n\nCareer\n\nEvans was born in Aurora, Illinois, on June 18, 1957. As a child, Evans appeared in beauty pageants and later regional theater and commercials. She graduated early from high school and attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. While there, Evans was cast as an extra in the 1978 Brian De Palma film The Fury and the same year in the miniseries The Awakening Land. Casting director Mary Jo Slater soon got Evans the role of Tina Clayton on the ABC daytime soap opera One Life to Live, where she stayed until 1981. Evans then went on to portray Patty Williams, Paul Williams' little sister, and Jack Abbott's wife, on The Young and the Restless from 1983 to 1984.\n\nEvans returned to One Life to Live in 1985, in a storyline credited with putting the series \"back on course\" and ultimately bringing Tina to her height of popularity. She was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award in 1988 for Outstanding Ingenue for One Life to Live and has appeared on the cover of Soap Opera Digest five times every year from 1986 to 1990.\n\nIn January 1990, Evans abruptly quit One Life to Live and dropped out of public view for nearly a decade. Years later, she revealed that she had left to escape a persistent stalker who had gone as far as breaking into the ABC studios in New York City, intent on killing her. Co-star Fiona Hutchison tried to pry the stalker off of Evans along with ABC security. At the time, the stalker incident had been played down heavily in the press. On One Life to Live, the character of Tina moved away to California after her divorce from long-time love interest Cord Roberts. In a 2005 episode of the CBS News show 48 Hours, Evans discussed working with Rebecca Schaeffer, who played Annie Barnes on One Life to Live for six months in 1985, and how it was Schaeffer's murder by her stalker in August 1989 that finally led Evans to leave One Life to Live in January 1990.\n\nEvans made two feature films during the 1990s, performing a small part in A Low Down Dirty Shame in 1994 and a significant role in Ice Cream Man in 1995. In 1999, Evans returned to television, appearing as Amber Moore's \"trashy\" mother, Tawny, on The Bold and the Beautiful until 2000. That year she stepped into the role of Rebecca Hotchkiss Crane on the NBC soap opera Passions (replacing Maureen McCormick, whose ten-episode stint had ended), where she would stay until the series' final episode. Evans' longtime recurring status on Passions fueled rumors for years of her return to her One Life to Live role of Tina.\n\nWhen NBC canceled Passions, it was announced in July 2007 that she would stay with the series for its continued run on DirecTV. Passions finished taping in March 2008, though new episodes were broadcast on DirecTV through August 2008.\n\nIn the June 26, 2007 issue of Soap Opera Digest, Evans was asked what her favorite role was besides her current one on Passions; she answered, \"That's an easy one ... Tina Lord Roberts on One Life to Live because in every actor's life, you hope for a role that becomes bigger than yourself and for me, Tina was that role.\" ABC announced in April 2008 that Evans would soon return as Tina; she reappeared onscreen on June 11, 2008. Executive Producer Frank Valentini noted, \"Even though Andrea has not appeared on OLTL since 1990, she has remained among the most requested characters to return to the show ... I welcome her home to OLTL and to the role where she made an indelible mark on our audience.\" Evans' departure from the series was announced on November 5, 2008. Evans and ABC noted that the actress' return was always set to be short-term, as her \"life, family and home\" are in California while One Life to Live taped in New York City Valentini continued in a statement, \"The character of Tina is a very important part of the OLTL canvas ... [If] there is an opportunity to have her — Tina and Andrea — return at a future date, the show would be happy to explore it.\" Evans' last appearance was on November 25, 2008.\n\nOn April 6, 2010, TVGuide.com announced that Evans would be returning to The Young and the Restless, not as Patty Williams, but as Evans' The Bold and the Beautiful character Tawny—the one-episode stint aired on May 12, 2010. On November 8 of the same year, it was announced that Evans would be temporarily returning to The Bold and the Beautiful as Tawny. While still appearing in a recurring capacity on B&B, Evans reprised the role of Tina on OLTL on September 27, 2011, as the series was ending its run. In the story, her character Tina was reunited with her 1980s super-couple partner, Cord Roberts, played by John Loprieno. Her short-term run ended as Cord and Tina remarried on November 15, 2011.\n\nIn 2012, Evans had a supporting role in the Joey Lawrence film Hit List. In August 2013, Evans was cast as Vivian Price in the fourth season of the web series DeVanity, which was streamed in 2014. She was nominated for a 2015 Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer in a New Approaches Drama Series for her performance and won a 2015 Indie Series Award for Best Guest Actress in a Drama for the role.\n\nEvans was the executive producer of the documentary Rocking the Couch, released in 2018. She portrayed the recurring role of Patty Walker on the web series The Bay from 2017 to 2020.\n\nPersonal life and death\n\nEvans was briefly married to One Life to Live co-star Wayne Massey (who played Tina's love interest Johnny Drummond) in 1981. Evans married Los Angeles attorney Stephen Rodriguez on January 10, 1998; the couple adopted a daughter in 2004.\n\nEvans died of breast cancer at her home in Pasadena, California, on July 9, 2023, at the age of 66.\n\nFilmography\n\n1978 The Awakening Land Fay Morrison Wheeler Miniseries; Episode: \"Part III: The Town\"\n\n1978–1981, 1985–1990, 2008, 2011 One Life to Live Tina Lord July 1978–December 1981; February 1985–January 1990; June–November 2008; September–November 2011\n\nIn 1985, Evans also portrayed a younger version of her character's mother, Irene Manning, in flashbacks.\n\n1982 CHiPs Julie Episode: \"Meet the New Guy\" (as Andrea Evans Massey)\n\n1983–1984 The Young and the Restless Patty Williams July 1983–October 1984\n\n1984 Arch of Triumph Nurse Eugenie TV movie\n\n1985 Jenny's War Receptionist Miniseries\n\n1985 Florence Nightingale Mrs. Brent TV movie\n\n1990 Capital News Andrea Schaffer Episode: \"Finished?
