        "text": "(SoapOperaNetwork.com) — John Loprieno brings Cord Roberts back to Llanview just as the Buchanan clan needs him most. But just how accepting will he be of his new kinfolk?\n\nClint Buchanan (Jerry verDorn) may be broke, under house arrest, living in his ex-wife’s home, and recovering from heart transplant surgery, but on Wednesday, September 28, he finally gets a bit of good news when his eldest son Cord leaves the family’s London compound to visit him at Llanfair.\n\nHowever, Cord’s visit isn’t entirely a social call, as he vents his frustrations regarding his little brother Rex’s (John-Paul Lavoisier) handling of the family company, Buchanan Enterprises, among other things.\n\nBut that’s not all. Look for Cord to also cross paths with his two time ex-wife Tina (Andrea Evans) while in town. But will the old flames pick up where they left off, or is there still too much bad blood between them for the pair to be anything more than friends? Tune in to find out!\n\nCord was last seen in Llanview in August of 2008 after blaming Tina for endangering the life of their daughter Sarah in one of her many schemes."
