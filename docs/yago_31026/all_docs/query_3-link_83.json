        "text": "For the second time this week, a video has shown two basking sharks swimming together off the coast of Cape May.\n\nThe sharks were spotted three miles off the coast of Cape May on Thursday, the Cape May Whale Watch and Research Center said in a social media post titled, \"Rare Sighting Alert!\"\n\nEarlier in the week, another video showed beachgoers in Cape May watching a shark's dorsal fin and tail visible above the shallow water close to shore.\n\nWhat is a Basking Shark?\n\nAccording to Ocena, the basking shark is \"a slow-moving, plankton-eating shark that can grow to be the second largest fish in the world, reaching lengths of up to 40 feet and weighing over 5 tons.\n\nAlthough basking sharks are generally thought to be harmless to humans, they are large animals with rough skin, so caution is advised when encountering them.\n\nHow Often Shark Sightings Usually Happen off Jersey Coast\n\nMelissa Laurino, research director and naturalist with theCape May Whale Watch and Research Center, told CBS 3 that the recent sightings mark only two times staff have spotted basking sharks so close to land in the past 10 years.\n\nSince late July, the center said it has spotted four different basking sharks off the coast.\n\nThe two basking sharks were traveling together, which was a first, according to the Cape May Whale Watch and Research Center. In the other two sightings, the sharks were traveling individually."
