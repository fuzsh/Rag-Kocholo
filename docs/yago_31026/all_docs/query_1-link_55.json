        "text": "There are many things in life that I know and even more that I don't. I have always been someone who believes that when you have faith your true and good desires have a greater possibility of coming to fruition. Having faith doesn't mean that you don't sometimes falter or second guess but it means that at the end of the day you know that by putting it out there the dream can become a reality.\n\nThe picture that accompanies this post is from when I went to Buenos Aires in Argentina. When I was eight years old, I first saw those amazing falls known as the Iguazu Falls not in person but on television. I saw them on One Life to Live during the Tina, Cord and Gabrielle story line. Tina went over the falls and it looked so believable to my young eyes. In that moment I wanted to see the water with my own eyes. I dreamed of it and never told anyone but I vowed to visit one day. Nearly 23 years later I was in Argentina overlooking the falls. I held on to faith and although years would pass and I would wonder if I'd ever see them the faith faltered but never wavered.\n\nWhen I think of faith I think of purpose. I often find myself wondering what my purpose is. I'm living life and breathing and trying to be the best that I can be. But...what kind of mark will I leave on this earth. Will people say that I left an impact on their heart? On their soul? I have many desires and things I'd like to accomplish. I believe that it is possible but how and when? I always dreamed of getting married and having children. I dreamed of a beautiful home by the water. I dreamed of the smile that would come across my moms face when she held her grandchild. I dreamed of family. I often felt and at times still do...that my purpose in life was to be a mom and a wife. I'm not sure that my purpose matched God's. But..I do have faith that in the end true happiness and fulfillment will carry me the rest of my days. I feel like I've had to sacrifice and struggle at times in order to appreciate what is coming down the pike. I have faith that that package at the end of the path will be all and more than I could have ever dreamed. With faith anything is possible.\n\nI think about those Iguazu Falls and how I always wanted to see them. A dream became my reality because I never let go of faith. Not sure what my purpose is in life but I do have faith that it will all make sense in due time."
