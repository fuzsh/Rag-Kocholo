        "text": "TWO FOR TUESDAY - ROSEANNE'S REALITY (\"ONE LIFE TO LIVE\")\n\n'ROSEANNE'\n\n\"ISN'T IT ROMANTIC?\"\n\nDuring this episode, Roseanne fantasized about being romanced by three characters of the soap opera 'One Life To Live'. All of them were members of the Buchanan family – the brothers Clint & Bo and Cord Roberts, Clint’s son. Roseanne dreamed herself into the TV and into the Buchanan living room in Llanview, Pennsylvania. One by one, she sampled what loving each of them might entail…..\n\nCLINT BUCHANAN\n\nCLINT:\n\nHold on, you two.\n\nYou may be my brother, and you may be my son, but this is a woman.\n\nA woman I'm not related to.\n\nROSEANNE:\n\nWait a minute.\n\nI'm looking for romance, but I can't have all of you.\n\nAt least, not at the same time.\n\nCLINT:\n\nIf you'll be mine, my darling, I can give you everything you've always wanted.\n\nWow! I've always wanted everything that I’ve always wanted.\n\nBO BUCHANAN\n\nBO:\n\nDon't listen to him.\n\nBecause what you need Is a soul mate.\n\nSomeone who can extinguish the loneliness burning in your soul.\n\nSomeone who knows your deepest, darkest thoughts.\n\nROSEANNE [as thought]:\n\nMan, this guy is good.\n\nHe really knows what goes on inside of us women.\n\nBO [as thought]:\n\nIt's true.\n\nI do know what's going on inside of you.\n\nROSEANNE [as thought]:\n\nReally? Can you hear this?\n\nBO [as thought]:\n\nYes.\n\nROSEANNE [as thought]:\n\nCan you hear this? (Bo nods.)\n\nWow! Talk about being in sync.\n\nCORD ROBERTS\n\nROSEANNE:\n\nWhat about you, Cord?\n\n[Cord takes off his shirt.]\n\nROSEANNE:\n\nWow! Good answer.\n\nAt that point, the fantasy was interrupted…\n\nDAN CONNER:\n\nRoseanne, I’m home!\n\nROSEANNE:\n\nCheese it, it's my husband!\n\nAnd the fantasy clicks off as if it was a TV show.\n\nThat fantasy was in the form of a TV soap because ‘One Life To Live’ is recognized not only as a TV show, but as a soap opera. In this very episode, Roseanne refers to OLTL as a soap opera while her sister Jackie was watching it:\n\n“You're not gonna get what you want\n\nfrom these soap opera guys.\n\nThey can only love you for an hour a day.\n\n'course, that is four times longer than Dan.”\n\nAnd the ‘One Life To Live’ in Toobworld is not the same show from the real world. As part of the fantasy realm, the characters of ‘One Life To Live’ actually exist in that same world in which ‘Roseanne’ exists. Toobworld’s OLTL is a TV show based on the real lives of the people in Llanview, Pennsylvania.\n\nAnd we know that this soap opera has to be a fictionalized look at life in Llanview because of this dialogue from it as heard in that episode of ‘Roseanne’:\n\nClint Buchanan:\n\nI need to know, Bo,,,.\n\nDoes Viki really love Sloan? Or do I have a chance to win her back?\n\nAs in the Trueniverse, ‘One Life To Live’ seems to have hired the same actors to play the roles – Clint Ritchie (Clint), Robert S, Woods (Bo), and John Loprieno (Cord). Only in Toobworld, they are playing actual people.\n\nIt’s a Toobworld standard that eventually everybody will have a TV show about them. It’s the only way to disable Zonks, those discrepancies where TV shows refer to other TV shows which should be sharing the same dimension.\n\nI’ve got three other examples establishing ‘One Life To Live’ as a soap opera, and a fictional one at that:\n\n‘Friends’\n\n“The One with Joey's Award”\n\nJoey Tribbiani, who was nominated for his role in the televersion of ‘Days Of Our Lives’ (but he didn’t win), presented the Soapy Awards telecast for Best Supporting Actress.\n\nJoey Tribbiani:\n\n“Any one of the brilliant actresses nominated for this award deserves to take it home. Unfortunately, only one can.\n\nThe nominees for Favorite Supporting Actress aroee:\n\nFrom ‘Passions’, Erin Goff.\n\nFrom ‘One Life to Live’, Mary Lauren Bishop.\n\n‘All My Children’, Sarah Renee.\n\nAnd from ‘Days of Our Lives’, Jessica Ashley.”\n\nO’Bservation: As far as the IMDb knows, Erin Goff and Mary Lauren Bishop don’t exist in the real world; Sarah Renee and Jessica Ashley are listed as actresses. (Although the last name for Sarah Renee is spelled RENEE’. That apostrophe could be a typo.) But none of those women are listed in the cast for ‘One Life To Live’. More evidence that Toobworld’s version is fictional.Degrassi: Minis:\n\nGood Times Part 2\n\nDave Turner and Bruce the Moose watch the angst-driven conflicts between their fellow students, which Bruce thinks resemble a soap opera…..\n\nDave Turner:\n\nHow often do you do... this?\n\nBruce The Moose:\n\nEver since I found these losers, I've totally given up 'One Life To Live'!\n\nGeneral Hospital:\n\nEpisode #1.12743\n\nTracy:\n\nLauren is real, and between her and pickle-Lila, I'm gonna be back on top, starting right now.\n\nLuke:\n\nOh, Tracy, sadly, \"One Life to Live\" isn't on anymore.\n\nO'Bservation: So even in Toobworld, ‘One Life To Live’ no longer exists as a TV show.\n\nIn this case, Roseanne interacted in a fantasy with characters from a soap opera w ho were based on \"real life\" citizens of Toobworld. But there was another time when she actually met the real people\"who were being portrayed in a soap opera. And we'll be tackling that next. No surfing!\n\nI’m dedicating this blog post to Mary Brooks O’Creagh, who got me hooked on ‘One Life To Live’ once upon a time…..\n\nUntil next time.....\n\nUPDATE: Thanks to Mike Doran, I've edited out a paragraph in which I claimed that Sloan was not an actual character in the show. As Mike pointed out, he was and he was played by Roy Thinnes. When I ran a search of the IMDb full cast list for 'One Life To Live', the name \"Sloan\" did not come up. That's because only the first character played by Thinnes was listed - Alex Crown - and you couldn't see \"Sloan Carpenter\" unless you expanded the entry. Thanks, Mike!"
