This is a list of the 1003 blue plaques placed by English Heritage and its predecessors in the boroughs of London, the City of Westminster, and the City of London. The scheme includes a small number of plaques that were erected privately and subsequently absorbed.

The scheme began in 1866.[1] It was originally administered by the Royal Society of Arts until 1901 when it was taken over the London County Council. The LCC ran the scheme until its abolition in 1965 when its successor body the Greater London Council (GLC) took charge. With the abolition of the GLC in 1986, the blue plaque scheme has been administered by English Heritage.
