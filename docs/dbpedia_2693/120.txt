The English Heritage blue plaque scheme commemorates the link between notable figures of the past and the buildings in which they lived and worked.

Traditionally, blue plaques were only in London, but for a six-year period to 2005 they were also erected in a few other cities, including Portsmouth.

Seven plaques were erected in Portsmouth. The plaques can be seen from the public road, but all are on private property, including two in school grounds.

Other plaque schemes have operated in the city, such as those put up by Portsmouth City Council to commemorate W L Wyllie, Arthur Conan Doyle and John Pounds, amongst others.

Plaques also include one erected at 12 High Street, Old Portsmouth to mark the founding of Portsmouth Football Club in 1898.
