The Short Bros early aviation history in Battersea began when Oswald and Eustace rented arches 75 and 81 from the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway in 1906. The plaque reads THE SHORT BROTHERS HORACE 1872-1917 EUSTACE 1875-1932 OSWALD 1883-1969 Aeronautical Engineers worked in arches 75 and 81 The arches are behind the petrol filling station on Queenstown Road roundabout opposite the Rosery Gate into Battersea Park. They had set up Short Brothers in 1897 when they purchased a used coal gas-filled balloon, with the intention to develop and construct other such balloons. The arches were situated next to the Battersea gas-works, making it easier to get gas for their balloons. known as “The Field”, for balloon launches. They were appointed as the Aeronautical Engineers to the Aero Club and made balloons for many well-known early aviators, a contract from the British Indian Army for three balloons, built the entry flown by Charles Rolls for the first Gordon Bennett international balloon race, began aeroplane construction when built a glider for the aviator and later cabinet minister J Moore-Brabazon, to his own designs.\n\nWhen the American aircraft pilots Orville and Wilbur Wright came to Europe to demonstrate in Le Mans in France in 1908, Oswald exclaimed “this is the finish of ballooning; we must begin building aeroplanes at once, and we can’t do it without Horace.” who was their brilliant engineer elder brother. They obtained the British rights to build copies of the Wright design thus becoming the first aircraft manufacturing company in the world to undertake volume aircraft production.\n\nThey soon had to move to expand their aircraft production although their ballooning continued until 1919. They went on to become a world-famous name in aviation. Short Brothers was bought by Bombardier in 1989, and now owned by Spirit Aerosystems and is the largest manufacturing concern in Northern Ireland. Their plaque on arch 75 was unveiled by Jenny Body OBE, the first female President of the Royal Aeronautical Society.\n\nSean O’Casey 1880 1964) was an Irish dramatist and memoirist.\n\nHere is the link to my blog on himhttps://sheelanagigcomedienne.wordpress.com/2021/11/15/sean-ocasey-battersea-plaque-man/\n\nHe lived at 49 Overstrand Mansions Prince of Wales Drive.\n\nHis plaque reads: SEAN O’CASEY 1880-1964 Playwright lived here at flat No 49. O’Casey was a committed socialist, he was the first Irish playwright of note to write about the Dublin working classes, best known for his first three plays – Shadow of a Gunman (1923) revolutionary politics on the working class people of Dublin, Juno and Paycock (1924), deals with the Civil War and The Plough and the Stars (1926). dealt and the Easter Rising and depicting the lives of the slum dwellers.Silver Tassie In 1929, his great anti-war play showing the devastating impact of WW1 on an Irish footballer and his friends.\n\nHe was the last of five surviving children out of thirteen of Michael and Susan Casey, staunch Protestants both, father worked as a clerk for the Irish Church Missions on Townsend Street. His father died when Sean was 6, leaving the family impoverished and living a peripatetic life thereafter. As a child, he suffered from poor eyesight, which interfered somewhat with his education, but O’Casey taught himself to read and write by the age of thirteen. He joined the Gaelic League in 1906, learned to speak Irish, changed his name to Sean O’Casey, learned to play the Uileann Pipes joined the Irish Republican Brotherhood, became an ardent socialist, was general secretary of the Irish Citizen Army, and, began to write. He became involved in the Irish Transport and General Workers Union influenced by labour leader Jim Larkin. He lived through troubled and turbulent times; the 1913 Lock-out and Strike, the 1916 Easter Rising, the Anglo-Irish War and the Civil War. He became disillusioned with the Irish nationalist movement because its leaders put nationalist ideals before socialist ones.\n\nHaving suffered a number of personal attacks due to the content of the third, he left Dublin for London to receive the Hawthornden Prize for Literature and also give publicity for The Plough and the Stars. It was during casting he met and later married Eileen Carey and married Eileen Carey in 1927 and they moved to Battersea. Though consistently published, he struggled to match the quality of the output of his earlier career in Ireland and regularly upset audiences with the overtly Socialist content of his writing. He eventually left Battersea in 1938 and died in Torquay in 1964.\n\nHis daughter Shivaun, who became an actress and director can clearly remember the moment when she realised just how much some Irish people hated her father. It was 1955 and the 15-year-old had made her first trip to Ireland for the premiere of Sean’s new clerical drama, The Bishop’s Bonfire. “Get out, ye dirty Protestants!””It was a very exciting evening,” recalls Shivaun\n\nThe chapter heading on their life in Battersea is entitled A Drive of Snobs in which he writes scathingly about what he perceived as English class snobbery.\n\nThe O’ Caseys moved to Totnes Devon in 1938 with his two sons Breon and Niall,. on the advice of their friend George Bernard Shaw who suggested that the boys should attend Dartington Hall School. Among letters of congratulations were Nobel laureate George Bernard Shaw and future British prime minister Harold Macmillan.\n\nNiall tragically died of Leukaemia, aged 21. His son Breon became an artist, a jeweller, weaver, etcher, printmaker, engraver, painter and sculptor who had been apprenticed to Barbara Hepworth\n\nSean wrote a further 15 plays. These, however, were less realist and more symbolic and expressionist..Sean died aged 84 in 1964 was cremated at Golders’ Green Crematorium while Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was filming ‘Young Cassidy’ (1965), a movie based on his autobiography,staring Rod Taylor. Shivaun herself had a cameo role as Lady Gregory’s maid in it and very recently his great grand daughter Agnes O Casey, Shivaun’s granddaughter is starring in Ridley Road. So the theatrical gene continues.\n\nJohn Richard Archer (8 June 1863 – 14 July 1932) was elected Mayor of Battersea in 1913, becoming the first black mayor in London. He was a Pan African activist.\n\nPlaque at 55 Brynmaer Road his former home. English Heritage plaque was unveiled in November 2013\n\nHe was a notable Pan –Africanist and the founding president of the African Progress Union. He was born in Liverpool in June 1863 to a Barbadian ship’s steward and an Irishwoman Mary Burns He moved to Battersea with his Canadian wife Margaret in the early 1890s. Margaret appears to have died in the late 1910s as Archer married Bertha White in 1923; there were no children of either union. Archer had many different jobs – the 1901 census records that he was a professional singer, and he may also have been a student of medicine.\n\nArcher entered local politics after attending the Pan-African Conference held in London in 1900, where he met leading members of the African diaspora. In 1918 he became the first president of the African Progress Union working for “advanced African ideas in liberal education”. In 1919 he was a British delegate to the Pan African Congress in Paris and two years later, chaired the Pan-African Congress in London.\n\nHe was elected councillor in 1906 and when he was nominated for Progressive candidate for Mayor in Battersea in November, 1913 the newspapers made something of a fuss, as the first Catholic and Irish nationalist mayor Thomas Brogan, had been John Archer’s mentor prior to his election -both had Irish mothers. https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/black-atlantic/information/john_archer/\n\nIn 1918 he was election agent for Charlotte Despard.

He convinced the Labour Party to endorse Saklatvala and he was duly elected one of the first Indian MPs in Britain. He and Saklatvala continued to work together, winning again in 1924 until the Communist and Labour parties split fully. In the 1929 , Archer was agent for the official Labour candidate who beat Saklatvala.

His travel books, such as Old Calabria (1915), were also appreciated for the quality of their writing. Unfortunately, he is now remembered as a paedophile.\n\nHe was born in Thuringen Austria, His mother was Vanda von Poellnitz. His father was John Sholto Douglas (1838–1874), manager of a cotton mill, who died in a hunting accident when Douglas was about six. He spent the first years of his life on the family estate, Villa Falkenhorst, in Thüringen. He was brought up mainly at Tilquhillie Deeside, his paternal home in Scotland, educated at Yarlet Hall and Uppingham School in England, and then at a grammar school in Karlshrue. He started in the diplomatic service in 1894 based in St Petersburg, but was placed on leave following a sexual scandal. In 1897 he bought a villa (Villa Maya) in Posillipo, suburb of Naples.\n\nThe next year he married a cousin Elizabeth Louisa FitzGibbon (two children, Elsa was two months pregnant and the marriage was arranged very quickly. They lived in Italy, where their first child, Archie, was born, and a second son, Robin, the following year. Douglas obtained a divorce in 1904 on the grounds of Elsa’s adultery and gained custody of their two sons.\n\nHe moved to Capri, began dividing his time between the Villa Daphne there and London, and became a more committed writer. Nepenthe, the fictional island setting of his novel South Wind (1917), is Capri in light disguise, worked for The English Review, met DH Lawrence through this connection. D. H. based a character in his novel Aaron’s Rod (1922) on Douglas, which led to a falling out between the two writers.\n\nDouglas sent his sons to boarding-school in England. In January 1908 he moved to London where he successfully contesting his wife’s attempt to regain custody of her children on the grounds of her husband’s paedophilia. According to Mark Holloway, the author of Norman Douglas : A biography (1976), his wife claimed in court that he was involved in a “rather faunesque pursuit of young boys”.\n\nIn 1916, British prosecutors charged Douglas with sexually assaulting a sixteen-year-old boy, and in 1917 he was charged with indecent assault of two boys, one a 10-year-old and the other aged 12. Douglas was granted bail and fled the country for Capri, Italy. He was also forced to flee Florence in 1937 following allegations that he raped a 10-year-old girl.\n\nFurther scandals led Douglas to leave Italy for the South of France in 1937. Following the collapse of France in 1940 Douglas left the Riviera and made a circuitous journey to London, where he lived from 1942 to 1946. He returned to Capri in 1946 and was made a citizen of the island. His circle of acquaintances included the writer Graham Greene, the composer Shaourj Sorabji and the food writer Elizabeth David. Gracie Fields said she moved to Capri after reading his book.\n\nhttps://evelynwaughsociety.org/2019/norman-douglas-forgotten-author/ There are other alleged child abusers who have died and whose works, once considered great, have faded into obscurity, in no small part because it is almost impossible to memorialize them without creating the impression of condoning their behaviour. The writer Norman Douglas is a prime example. When the truth about his sexual relations with children was fully exposed after his death he became an impossible figure to memorialize. The fact that Douglas has been ignored by biographers may have more to do with the fact that he was an unpleasant or, in the end, uninteresting person.\n\nDouglas died in Capri, apparently after deliberately overdosing himself on drugs after a long illness (see Impossible Woman: Memoirs of Dottoressa Moore, ed. Greene). His last words are reputed to have been: “Get those fucking nuns away from me.\n\nCharles Sargeant Jagger MC (Military Cross, ARA (17 December 1885 – 16 November 1934) sculptor who, following active service in the WW1, sculpted many works on the theme of war.\n\nHe is best known for his war memorials, especially the Royal Artillery Memorial at Hyde Park Corner and the Great Western Railway War Memorial in Paddingron Station and a designed several other monuments around Britain and other parts of the world.

The Sculpture of Charles Sargeant Jagger.\n\nHere is a link to my blog on him as he featured in a talk I gave for the Battersea Society on The Battersea Plaque Men alongside HM Bateman cartoonist 40 Nightingale Lane SW12 and artist and Sean O’Casey playwright 49 Overstrand Mansions https://sheelanagigcomedienne.wordpress.com/2022/03/18/charles-sargeant-jagger-battersea-plaque-man/\n\nCharles was the son of a colliery manager, Enoch Jagger and his wife Mary Sergeant and born in Kilnhurst South Yorkshire and was educated at Sheffield Royal Grammar School. His older sister Edith and brother David became artists and all studied together at Sheffield Technical School of Art.\n\nThere is also a plaque which was unveiled in his home village, Kilnhurst by the Rotherham District Civic Society in October 2018\n\nA fascinating article written in Studio International. In 1915. Rising British Sculptor: Charles Sargeant Jagger written by I G Allister\n\nHe wrote: His first introduction to plastic art was an incident of his childhood which stands out in his memory very clearly. Wandering with his father on Whitby Sands one day they came across a man modelling a sphinx in the clay indigenous to the locality, and as they watched the process the idea arose in the boy’s mind that he must be a sculptor, and he distinctly remembers the thrill of happiness which accompanied a decision from which he never once wavered. His school-days however were an ordeal to him,\n\nAt age 14 in 1889 he became an apprentice metal engraver with the Sheffield firm Mappin and Webb who made beautifully crafted silverware and fine jewellery and had Royal warrants and commissions from Monarchs around the world, In 1887 Granted a Royal Warrant as Silversmiths to Queen Victoria.\n\nHe studied at the Sheffield School of Art, learnt drawing, then modelling in the daytime, and taught drawing at evening-classes, producing some remarkable work such as Man and the Maelstrom and Prometheus Bound, both of which were created before he was eighteen.\n\nHe won a scholarship to study sculpture at the Royal College of Art 1908-11 under Edouard Lantieri. National Art Training School at its new home in South Kensington.\n\nIn 1914 he won the British Prix de Rome scholarship in sculpture but couldn’t take up because of the war, he decided to enlist in the Artist Rifles instead. Other members of the regiment included Edward Thomas, Nash brothers, John Lavery and in 1915 he was commissioned in the Worsestshire Regiment. He served in Gallipoli and on the Western Front, and was wounded three times.\n\nOn 5th November 1915, he was shot through the left shoulder and evacuated first to a hospital in Malta and then back to England. Once recovered he married Violet Constance Smith in 1916 whom he met in 1911. Charles paid for singing lessons for her and she went on to become a concert singer and pianist they had a son Cedric and they divorced in 1924. He was sent out to the Western Front where he was wounded again in 1918.\n\nWhilst convalescing from war wounds in 1919, he began work on No Man’s Land, a low relief which after being cast in bronze it was presented to the Tate in 1923.\n\nJagger’s sculptor style tended towards realism, especially his portrayal of soldiers, his figures were rugged and workman-like.\n\nRoyal Artillery Memorial (1921–25) at Hyde Park Corner in London is one of his best-known works. It features a giant sculpture of a howitzer surrounded by four bronze soldiers and stone relief scenes, and is dedicated to casualties in the British Royal Regiment of Artillery the war. When Jagger was commissioned he remarked to the Daily Express the “experience in the trenches persuaded me of the necessity for frankness and truth”.\n\nHe completed war memorials over the next seven years Manchester Britannia Hotel, in (1921); Southsea (1921); Bedford (1921); Great Western Railway War Memorial (1922); Brimington (1922); Royal Artilley (1921–5); Anglo Belgian War Memorial Brussels (1922–3); Nieuwpoort (1926–8 Port Tewfiq Egypt Crouching Lion (1927–8); commemorated 4,000 officers and men of the Indian Army killed during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign during the war at (1927–8) destroyed by retreating Egyptian troops during the Six Day War of 1967 and later relocated to the Heliopolis War cemetery in Cairo.\n\nDuring this period Charles Jagger produced statues of the Duke of Windsor future King Edward V111 1922), Lord Hardinge Viceroy Governor General India (1928) and Ernest Shackleton (1932).\n\nAlfred Mond the founder of Imperial Chemical Industries, commissioned four large stone figures symbolic of industries for the company headquarters in Millbank. construction (The Builder), marine transport, for agriculture (The Sower), and chemistry and figures – four directly associated with ICI and its predecessors, Ludwig and Alfred Mond, Harry McGowan Alfred Noble and Justus Vobn Leibig Joseph Priestly Antoine Lavoisier and Dimitri Mendelev.\n\nThis is a commission called Scandal in the V Bronze relief and cast-iron fire basket set, 1930, commissioned by Henry Mond (Baron Melchett;) son of his patron and his wife Gwen, for his drawing room at Mulberry House, Smith Square, and was an important feature of its celebrated Art Deco interior. It is about their ménage à trois with the author ( Gilbert Cannan), mocking the tittle-tattle. The firebasket, wall label, the “two snarling cats and a parrot apparently Jagger had a fierce macaw called and there is a photoofit on his shoulder while working’. This is in the V&A Museum.\n\nAs a fellow of the Royal Society of British Sculptors, he was twice a gold medallist for Royal Artillery and figures of St George and Britannia at the entrance to Thames House, Millbank.\n\nEdith and David’s work. Edith Jagger (1880-1977) was an exceptionally gifted painter of flower subjects and still lives. However it is her work as chief designer for the ground-breaking charitable organisation, Painted Fabrics in Sheffield which proved offered occupational therapy for injured British servicemen, It went on to produce fabrics and clothing of fashionable design and high quality for decades. ‘Work Not Charity’ was the companies motto. Twenty-eight of her paintings were included in The Art of Jagger Family, an exhibition which toured to seven towns and cities across the Midlands and North of England during 1939-40.\n\nDavid Jagger (1891-1958) was a skilled and successful portaitist which included Queen Mary, Lord Baden-Powell, Winston Churchill, Vivien Leigh and Dame Nellie Melba and also worked in advertising for J Walter Thompson.\n\nGillian Jagger his daughter became a sculptor in the US. She was was only 4 when her father died suddenly of pneumonia in 1934. Her mother remarried an American and went to the States.\n\nBeing a workaholic, his relentless work rate and old war wounds probably contributed towards his untimely early death in 1934. His studio in Anhalt Road nearby Albert Bridge is now owned by the quirky artist Chris Orr RA.\n\nDr. Edward Wilson (1872-1912) BA, MB (Cantab.) physician, polar explorer, natural historian, painter and ornithologist was as an influential figure of the heroic age of Antarctic exploration, being chiefly remembered today as the artistic scientist who died with Captain Scott.\n\nHe was born in Montpellier Parade, Cheltenham on 23 July 1872. His childhood was full of news from his Wilson and Whishaw relatives, from the far flung corners of Imperial Russia, the British Empire and beyond.From the age of three his parents noted that Wilson liked nothing better than to lie on the floor drawing. This resulted in his mother giving him drawing lessons. Described as “clever but boisterous”. At Cheltenham Proprietary College for Boys he excelled at games, art and in the activities of the Natural History Society, being secretary of the ornithological section for some time and whilst that he received the only systematic art lessons.\n\nHe was educated at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge However, in the Oxford and Cambridge exams he obtained his certificate with honours in science. It was decided that he would enter Gonville and Caius College in Cambridge to pursue a career in medicine, like his father. Natural History and art were clearly seen as subjects for hobbies.\n\nLater joined St. George’s Hospital, London which involved long hours of hard work and he was soon immersed in anatomy, physiology and surgery. Nevertheless, he found time to play football for the hospital and also to row. He took lodgings in Paddington and walked to and from St. George’s which was at Hyde Park Corner. His long hours of work and his experiments with asceticism soon started to take their toll. He moved his lodgings, taking up residence in the Caius Mission house in Battersea. Here he became engaged in youth clubs and Sunday school classes for the children of the slums. The children suffered from fleas, lice and numerous medical afflictions. He continued to walk the 3 miles each way, through Battersea Park and along the Thames to the hospital, every day. It was at the Mission house, one afternoon, that he first met Miss Oriana Souper in 1897. She was a friend of the Warden’s wife. After tea, Wilson excused himself to go and run his boys’ classes and then retired to his rooms to work. Later, he stole down the stairs to quietly listen to Miss Souper sing. Their friendship was to develop slowly.\n\nHe contracted tuberculosis from his mission work and had to recuperate taking time out from his studies and got engaged to Oriana. He recovered and was appointed as the Assistant Surgeon and Vertebrate Zoologist to the British National Antarctic Expedition (1901-1904) aboard Discovery, under Commander Robert Falcon Scott. Three weeks before the Expedition sailed, Wilson married Oriana. Their honeymoon was dominated by Antarctic preparations but they were blissfully happy.\n\nUpon return he was appointed Field Observer to the Grouse Disease Inquiry and illustrated wildlife books. In 1910 he returned to the Antarctic with Captain Scott aboard Terra Nova as Chief of the Scientific Staff.\n\nOne by one they became frost-bitten, Oates so badly that he committed suicide in a bid to save his companions, walking out of the tent with the words “I am just going outside and may be some time”. Badly frost-bitten, dehydrated and short of food and fuel, Wilson, Bowers and Scott perished in their tent 11 miles short of their main One Ton Depot. The following Spring they were buried upon the Great Ice Barrier by a search party, which also recovered their scientific specimens, their diaries and the final sketch books of Edward Adrian Wilson. He died with his comrades on the return from the South Pole in 1912.\n\n‘Life has been a struggle for some weeks now on this return journey from the Pole… Today may be the last effort… I shall simply fall and go to sleep in the snow, and I have your little books with me in my breast pocket… God be with you – my love is as living for you as ever…’\n\nWilhelmina Stirling 1865-1965 author and De Morgan Foundation founder.\n\nWilhelmina Pickering was born in London, was the younger sister of Pre-Raphaelite artist Evelyn De Morgan and niece of the painter Rodham Spencer Stanhope.\n\nIn 1901 she married Charles Goodbarne Stirling. She assembled a substantial art collection that featured Evelyn’s work and that of Evelyn’s ceramicist husband William De Morgan. Wilhelmina was a significant art collector with a preference for paintings by Victorian artists such as William Holman Hunt and John Waterhouse, and decorative arts including a sizeable collection of furniture from the 16th and 17th centuries.\n\nWhen she died aged 99, she bequeathed her collection in trust in perpetuity for public enjoyment. Her biography William De Morgan and his Wife (1922) is the starting point for all researchers interested in the De Morgans today. She also wrote reminiscences of the British landed gentry and on subjects such as spiritualism. The Merry Wives of Battersea is very entertaining, featuring the women who lived in the Battersea Manor House over the centuries.\n\nIn 1931 Wilhelmina and her husband moved into Old Battersea House, which had been threatened with demolition by Battersea Council. They were granted a life tenancy and used the house to display their art collection. Known as Terrace House until the 1930s, it was built for the naval administrator Samuel Pett and was most likely completed in 1699. It is the finest example of seventeenth century domestic architecture in Battersea. After a campaign to save the house, Battersea Council built St. John’s estate on its grounds in the 1930s.\n\nWilhelmina kept carefully documented records of all the treasures. One of these was a black oak cabinet by Morris and Co., hand decorated by William De Morgan in oils, depicting St George and the Dragon. This cabinet is currently at the National Trust property, Standen House and Garden, and is used to display some of William De Morgan’s ceramics.\n\nIn 1961, aged 96, she featured in a short documentary made by Ken Russell, Old Battersea House, and talks passionately about her support for the ideals of the Pre-Raphaelite movement. She loved giving tours and regaling visitors. She could talk for hours on the artworks and tell anecdotal stories about the house itself, for example about sleeping in the bed that had been slept in by the naughty Lord Rochester. Her butler, Mr Peters, carried around a large lamp to illuminate the rooms, as she spoke about the alleged sightings of ghosts.\n\nIn 1957 she wrote the book Ghosts Vivisected. Sir John Beteman described her as reminiscent of Miss Haversham, surrounded by the objects of a past life, but a curator at the De Morgan Foundation observed that this wasn’t the image of Mrs Stirling that she had come to know and love.\n\nIn 2007 Wandsworth Council unfortunately let go of the De Morgan Collection, which it had inherited from the Borough of Battersea, and was based in West Hill Library. The collection was dispersed to the Watts Gallery, the De Morgan Museum at Cannon Hall, Barnsley, Wightwick Manor and collection displays at other museums.\n\nAfter Mrs Stirling died the Forbes family took it over and restored it. Visitors included Liz Taylor and Ronald Reagan. When they sold it was bought by Pugachev who was accused by Russian government for embezzling loans from the government to his Mezhprombank. He fled Britain and his assets frozen. The new owner lives there with his young family. I was lucky enough to visit Old Battersea House before it was sold by the Forbes and again recently whilst organising the installation of a Battersea society plaque to Mrs Stirling in September 2022.\n\nIn Penelope Fitzgerald’s Booker Prize winning novel Offshore the houseboat-dwelling young sisters come over the bridge to St Mary’s foreshore and find De Morgan tiles to flog to a Chelsea antique dealer. They recount a ‘visit to the very, very old lady in Old Battersea House’."
