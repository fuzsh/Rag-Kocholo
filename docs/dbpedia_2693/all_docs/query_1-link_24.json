        "text": "Our Westminster green plaque scheme launched in 1991 to commemorate the diverse cultural heritage of Westminster and the people who have lived or worked here. It highlights buildings associated with people of renown who have made lasting contributions to society.\n\nNominations for new green plaques are reviewed by an independent advisory panel ahead of formal approval.\n\nCriteria\n\nOur green plaques commemorate people who:\n\nare regarded as eminent by most members of their profession\n\ndeserve recognition for their genuine contribution to society or for improving lives\n\nare reasonably well known\n\nand where sufficient time has elapsed since their life to show their lasting contribution to society.\n\nThe scheme also marks buildings of historical interest, that form a significant part of the heritage of the city. Please bear in mind that:\n\na historical or cultural event of great significance must have taken place in any building that is nominated\n\nnominations will not be considered on the basis of anniversaries or short stays from public figures alone\n\nshops, restaurants and organisations must have existed for at least 100 years to be considered for a green plaque.\n\nSubmit a green plaque nomination\n\nFill in a nomination form\n\nProcess\n\nPlease ensure that sponsorship of £3,500 plus VAT is in place before you submit your nomination. This fee helps to cover the cost of administering the scheme.\n\nPlease submit your nomination using the nomination form above.\n\nWe will contact you to clarify any additional information that is required.\n\nYour nomination will be shared with an advisory panel for consideration against the criteria.\n\nMeetings to decide which nominations are taken forward will take place in July and January. Please keep these timings in mind when applying.\n\nWe will contact the building owner to seek permission to install the green plaque and prepare an application for listed building consent, if it is required. If you have a specific timeframe in mind, it helps if you have already secured building owner permission. Please note that Green Plaques cannot be placed on buildings owned by Grosvenor.\n\nThe plaque wording is agreed. There is a maximum word count of 25 words for the plaque to be legible, or lower if the plaque is installed at height. There is a layout template for all plaques to ensure a legible and consistent style for plaques across the city. Logos are not usually possible if the plaque is to remain legible but there is space for a sponsor name at the bottom of the plaque.\n\nYour nomination is shared with ward councillors and a full report is prepared for formal approval by Cabinet Members.\n\nFollowing approval, your plaque is manufactured and installed.\n\nIf you would like to organise an unveiling ceremony, we can provide an unveiling stand and curtain and help you with any logistics. It is your responsibility to organise and cover the cost of the ceremony and reception including microphones and speakers if required.\n\nWestminster Green Plaques are 18\" diameter and weigh approximately 4kg.\n\nRecent green plaques\n\nStanley Kwai-Tsun Tse\n\nSeeWoo, 18-20 Lisle Street, WC2H 7BA\n\nA community leader in London's Chinatown and founder of the SeeWoo Asian supermarket in 1975.
