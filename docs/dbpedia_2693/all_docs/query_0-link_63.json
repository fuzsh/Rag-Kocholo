        "text": "Baden-Powell, Lord Robert of Gilwell\n\nThis plaque commemorates the 100th anniversary of the official opening of the 32nd annual Canadian National Exhibition by Lord Robert Stephenson Smyth Baden-Powell of Gilwell on August 30, 1910.\n\nB-P, as he became familiarly known, founded Boy Scouts in 1907 and Girl Guides in 1910. The movements grew spectacularly and have touched the lives of over 300 million throughout the world. At our investiture we undertake to love and serve God and country and to develop ourselves fully so that we can help others at all times. For over forty years, Scouts Canada of the Greater Toronto Council has operated a free wheelchair service for those who cannot easily get around the EX. Many thousands of visitors appreciate the help provided by the youth and adults of this volunteer Service Corps.\n\nAugust 30, 2010\n\nGreater Toronto Council – Scouts Canada\n\nThe Bandshell\n\nThe Bandshell was built in 1936, replacing the Bandstand that had occupied this area of the Exhibition Place grounds since 1906.\n\nIts Art Deco architecture, designed by Crai and Madill Architects, is modeled after the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, California. The Bandshell was officially opened on August 28, 1936 by Toronto Mayor Sam McBride and Sir Percy Vincent, Lord Mayor of London, as part of the CNE Opening Ceremonies.\n\nSince that time, it has been home to a host of the world’s finest entertainers including military and jazz bands, orchestras, vocalists,choirs, comedians, cartoon characters, musical shows, rock ‘n’ roll bands, urban music, and dignitaries from across Canada and around the world.\n\nThis plaque commemorates the 75th Anniversary of the Bandshell.\n\nAugust 2011\n\nBritish Columbia Fir Flagpole\n\nWhich was cut from a tree two hundred and thirty-seven years old and which is one hundred and eighty-four feet high.

Transported free of charge from New Westminster, B.C. to Quebec by Canadian National Steamships Limited, from Quebec to Toronto by Canadian Steamships Limited, and from the dock to Exhibition grounds by the Toronto Harbour Commission. Erected by the Canadian National Exhibition Ass’n. August 12th 1930.\n\nCanadian International Air Show\n\nHuman fascination with flight has made air shows popular since the early days of aviation. Toronto was the site of numerous air shows as it developed into a center of air transportation and aircraft manufacturing in the early twentieth century.\n\nThe Canadian International Air Show originated in 1946 when the National Aeronautical Association of Canada attracted overflow crowds to a show at De Havilland Airport in Downsview. Staged annually thereafter, the air show moved to Exhibition Place in 1949 and became a regular feature of the Canadian National Exhibition in 1956. Here it developed into a world class exhibition featuring diverse types of aircraft, precision and stunt flying, and aeronautical technology.\n\nOntario Heritage Foundation, an agency of the Government of Ontario.\n\nCanadian National Exhibition Association\n\nThis plaque is erected to commemorate the 100th Anniversary of the Canadian National Exhibition, 1978, CNE 100 Centennial.\n\nOfficers\n\nPresident Richard R.

McGibbon, Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario.\n\nCanadian National Exhibition\n\nThe second half of the 19th century was an era in which technological innovation brought rapid economic progress and social change. The spirit of the age was reflected in the annual fair that first opened the site on September 5, 1879.\n\nStaged by the Industrial Exhibition Association of Toronto, it offered medals and prize money to encourage innovation and improvements in agriculture, manufacturing and the arts. The fair quickly became a popular attraction and a boon to the local economy. A national event since 1912, the CNE continues to showcase Canadian creativity and achievement.\n\nOntario Heritage Foundation, Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Recreation.\n\nCoca Cola\n\nOn November 8, 2021 this sculpture, created by Walter Yarwood and commissioned by Coca-Cola Ltd. in 1965, was dedicated to the City of Toronto in recognition of our Mission to deliver optimism and create a better future for our customers, consumers and communities\n\nCoca-Cola Canada Bottling is Proud to be Your Local Bottler\n\nCoca-Cola is a trademark of Coca-Cola Ltd. used under license\n\nColiseum Complex\n\nColiseum Complex, Exhibition Place\n\nG.F.W. Price, City Architect\n\nThe Coliseum erected to showcase The Royal Agricultural Winter Fair and the agricultural programs of the Canadian National Exhibition, opened in 1921.\n\nWith additions made in 1926, the complex ranked as the largest exhibition space under one roof in the world. Its towers and classical detailing complemented the Beaux Arts Buildings at the west end of the exhibition grounds. During the Second World War, the Coliseum served as a recruitment centre, known as Manning Depot Number One, for the Royal Canadian Air Force. It has hosted a wide range of entertainment and sporting events and has served as a showplace for livestock and other farm products. Today, the Coliseum is part of the Metropolitan Toronto’s National Trade Centre, the largest trade and consumer facility in Canada.\n\nUnveiled by HRH Prince Philip, K.G., K.T., The Duke of Edinburgh.\n\nNovember 5, 1996\n\nToronto Historical Board\n\nDesigning the CNE's Grand Entrance\n\nThe design of a grand eastern entrance to the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE) was the result of visionary waterfront planning by Toronto architect Alfred H. Chapman. In the early 1920s, he was commissioned by the CNE to plan a major expansion of the fairgrounds, and by the Toronto Harbour Commission (THC) to design the western waterfront. In 1922, his firm, Chapman and Oxley, also completed the design of nearby Sunnyside Amusement Area for the THC.\n\nWorking with engineers from the THC and the City of Toronto, Chapman’s plan used landfill to extend the shore of the lake farther south, allowing for the construction of what is now Lake Shore Boulevard. Designed to dramatize the visual impact of the eastern entrance to the CNE grounds, the boulevard would be highlighted a few years later, in 1927, by Chapman and Oxley’s monumental Princes’ Gates.\n\nHeritage Toronto 2013\n\nEarly Exhibition Buildings\n\nThese five buildings – the Administration Building (1904), Music (1907), Horticulture (1907), Government (1912), and the Fire Hall and Police Station (1912) – are the largest and the finest group of early 20th century exhibition buildings in Canada.\n\nDesigned by G. W. Gouinlock, they reflect the influence of the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition of Chicago in their creative classical decoration and ordered integration to a site plan. The first permanent exhibition buildings in Toronto, they are an impressive reminder of the Canadian National Exhibition as the major industrial and agricultural fair of the period.\n\nHistoric Sites and Monuments Board of Canada, Government of Canada\n\n1.

Over fifty young people, directed by professional archaeologists, participated in this excavation.\n\nGround Plan\n\nA Corps de Garde\n\nB Storeroom/ Barracks\n\nC Barracks\n\nD Store and Storekeeper\n\nE Blacksmith\n\nF Officers’ Quarters\n\nG Outbuildings\n\nThe 1982 excavation was funded by the City of Toronto, the Toronto Board of Education, and the Ontario Heritage Foundation.

Henderson, City Clerk\n\nDonald A. Brown, Director of Excavations\n\nFort Rouillé (on monument)\n\nThe last French post built in present-day Southern Ontario. Fort Rouillé, more commonly known as Fort Toronto, was erected on this site in 1750-51.\n\nIt was established by order of the Marquis de la Jonquière, Governor of New France, to help strengthen French control of the Great Lakes and was located here near an important portage to capture the trade of Indians travelling southeast toward the British fur-trading centre at Oswego. A small frontier post, Fort Rouillé was a palisaded fortification with four bastions and five main buildings. It apparently prospered until hostilities between the French and British increased in the mid-1750s. Following the capitulation of other French posts on Lake Ontario, Fort Rouillé was destroyed by its garrison in July 1759.\n\nErected by the Ontario Heritage Foundation\n\nMinistry of Citizenship and Culture.\n\nGarden of the Greek Gods\n\nThese twenty stone sculptures, collectively known as the Garden of the Greek Gods, were created in the 1960s by the late Toronto artist Elford Bradley Cox, RCA (1914-2003). The sculptures represent gods, heroes, and monsters of Greek mythology.\n\nIn 1979, the collection was acquired by Toronto restaurateur Athanasios Karamanos, better known as Arthur Carman. To celebrate his Greek heritage, Carman donated the collection to the City of Toronto for permanent display at Exhibition Place.\n\nCox carved the sculptures from massive blocks of limestone, using an air hammer and chisels. They are some of the largest sculptures in Canada. Hercules is the tallest, at over three metres. Four additional Cox sculptures are located on these grounds, near the Queen Elizabeth Building.\n\nE.B. Cox is widely acknowledged as Canada’s foremost sculptor in stone. His many works of public art can be found throughout the city and province, with countless smaller sculptures held by private collectors across the country and around the world.\n\nExhibition Place 2022\n\nHeritage Entrance and Satok Mural\n\nThis entrance was designed to reflect the historic Halls of Fame building which stood near this location until 2006.\n\nOriginally constructed in 1961 as the Hockey Hall of Fame, the building was expanded in 1967 to include Canada’s Sports Hall of Fame. The portico and vestibule are faithfully reproduced here through the use of materials salvaged from the Halls of Fame building. Heritage elements include the cast-in-place-folded-plate concrete canopy, its four granite columns and two-story glazing including the original glass doors. Also preserved are the exterior pre-cast-concrete panels. Only the interior blue-grey mosaic tiles on the walls were replaced with modern materials to replicate the original tiles.\n\nDominating the entrance is the mural “Face-Off” by Canadian artist Ronald Satok. This mural was originally painted, in situ, at the conclusion of the construction of the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1961 using Polymer Tempura. Prior to the demolition of the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2006, to facilitate the construction of The National Soccer Stadium, the mural was carefully removed and later restored and installed in its current location.\n\nHeritage benches located around The National Soccer Stadium were made using granite salvaged from the Hall of Fame. The benches were commissioned by the Board of Governors of Exhibition Place and designed by Canadian artist, Stephen Cruise. They depict historic events or buildings associated with the Exhibition Place site and the annual Canadian National Exhibition.\n\nHonouring the Environmental Leadership of WindShare Co-op’s First Members\n\n401 Richmond Ltd., Aidan & Shane Ackerley, Active Yoga, Jane Adams, Keith Addison, Brendan Agnew-Iler, David Alexander Alas, Alexandra Park Housing Co-op, Greg Allen, Jason Altenberg, Feodor Alter, Ian Anderson & Margaret Hancock, Margaret Anderson, Robert S.

Woolnough Architect\n\nMungcal, Sito\n\nThis plaque and viewing bench commemorates the life of Sito Mungcal (May 25, 1945 – November 5, 2009) whose service contributions were most evident at Exhibition Place from 1986 until 2009.\n\nThroughout his life, Sito was known for his irreverence, his honesty and warmth for people, his open heart, welcoming smile and his zest for life.\n\nSito enriched the lives of many and will always be remembered fondly by his co-workers, his many friends at Toronto City Hall and in the broader community.\n\nThe Princes' Gates\n\nThis entrance to the Canadian National Exhibition grounds was built in 1927 to commemorate 60 years of Canadian Confederation. The stone and concrete gates were designed by the Toronto firm of Chapman and Oxley and are a fine example of monumental architecture in the Beaux Arts mode. Sculptor Charles D. McKechnie created the statues. The Winged Victory atop the central arch is flanked by figures representing the CNE’s commitment to progress through industry, education and the arts. The gates were opened officially on August 30, 1927 by Edward, Prince of Wales, and Prince George. They have been known ever since as the “Princes’ Gates.”\n\nOntario Heritage Foundation, Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Recreation\n\nPiazza Princes' Gates (1)\n\nIn 2005, a design competition was held for the revitalization of the important public space in front of the Princes’ Gates. Building on strong connections between Canada and Italy, design teams consisting of firms from Milano and Toronto were invited to submit proposals.\n\nAn international jury selected the winning team of Sering + Sistema Duemila (Milano) – The MBTW Group (Toronto). Their design interprets the theme, “Canada Past, Canada Present, Canada Future,” and presents the revitalization project as a beacon of shared culture, friendship and design between Milano and Toronto.\n\nThe landscape elements of this redesigned piazza celebrate the Princes’ Gates, and the Canada-Italy connection.\n\nTen long bands of Canadian granite interpret the original symbolism of the Gates’ columns into the surface of the piazza – each is engraved with the motto of a Canadian province. Seating blocks at the end of the granite bands are marked with the name of the corresponding province or a territory. The blocks are crafted of twinned pieces of granite representing Milano and Toronto – joined together by light.\n\nThe Princes’ Gates Revitalization Project is central to the twinning agreement between Milano and Toronto to promote business, trade and cultural relations between the two cities. This public project was also generously supported by the private sector.\n\nMayor David Miller, Toronto\n\nMayor Gabriele Albertini, Milano\n\nDeputy Mayor Joe Pantalone, Committee Chair\n\nRudolph Bratty, Q.C., Barry Fenton, and Mark Mandelbaum, Fund Raising Co-Chairs\n\nRocco Maragna, Competition Advisor\n\nItalian Chamber of Commerce of Toronto, Facilitator\n\nSusan Samuel, Project Manager\n\nPiazza Princes’ Gates was officially opened on July 19, 2006.\n\nThe Queen's Rangers\n\nThe young province of Upper Canada (Ontario) required troops to defend it and to build public works essential to its development. The Queen’s Rangers was the first regiment raised in Britain specifically for service in the colony.\n\nIt arrived in 1792 and was stationed in York (Toronto) in 1793. Over the next three years the regiment constructed government buildings and fortifications. It also cut important roads through the forest, including Yonge Street north to the Holland River, and Governor’s Road (Dundas Street) west to London. In 1794 detachments were posted along the Great Lakes in response to mounting tensions on the frontier with the United States. When the regiment was disbanded in 1802, many of its men settled on lands in nearby Etobicoke Township.\n\nOntario Heritage Foundation, Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Recreation\n\nRoyal Agricultural Winter Fair and Canadian National Exhibition\n\nThis plaque has been erected by The Royal Agricultural Winter Fair Association and The Canadian National Exhibition Association as an expression of their appreciation of the contribution made by The Corporation of the City of Toronto, The Government of Canada and The Government of Ontario in providing facilities for the promotion of Canadian agriculture. November, 1963.\n\nSakura Tree\n\nThis Sakura tree is one of 68 trees donated to Exhibition Place by the Sakura Project and Mr. Takashi KOEZUKA, Consul of Japan and Chair of the Sakura Committee\n\nThe aim of the Sakura Project is to plant three thousand Japanese Flowering Cherry Trees throughout Ontario. The Sakura tree represents friendship and good will between Japan and Canada\n\nMay 16, 2002\n\nScadding Cabin (on rock)\n\nJohn Scadding (1754-1824), the manager of Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe’s estate in Devonshire, arrived in Canada in 1792, and came to York with Simcoe the following year. He was granted 250 acres east of the Don River where, in 1794, he built a log cabin. He lived in England from 1796 to 1818 but returned to York and sold the cabin and part of his land to William Smith Jr., whose descendants, along with the York Pioneer and Historical Society, moved the cabin here in 1879.\n\nToronto Historical Board – 1978\n\nScadding Cabin\n\nThis log cabin, Toronto’s oldest known surviving house, was constructed for John Scadding in 1794 during the first years of British settlement.\n\nScadding was a government clerk and close friend of Lieutenant-Governor John Graves Simcoe. The cabin stood on the east side of the Don River on a 253 acre land grant that stretched north from Lake Ontario to present-day Danforth Avenue. Scadding lived there until he went back to England with the Simcoes in 1796. When Scadding returned to York in 1818, he sold the cabin and its property to farmer William Smith, who used the cabin as an outbuilding. In 1879, the Smith family offered the cabin to the 10-year old York Pioneers Association; Scadding’s son Henry, a prominent Toronto historian, was a founding member.\n\nIn the summer of 1879, in an early act of Toronto heritage preservation, the York Pioneers dismantled the cabin and reassembled it at this location for the inaugural Toronto Industrial Exhibition, now the Canadian National Exhibition.\n\nErected by the York Pioneer and Historical Society, Heritage Toronto, 2012\n\nShrine Peace Memorial\n\nOn June 12, 1930 this Peace Memorial was presented to the people of Canada by Imperial Potenata Noble Leo V. Youngworth, on behalf of the 600,000 members of the Ancient Arabic Order Nobles of the Mystic Shrine to commemorate the peaceful relationship existing for over a century between Canada and the United States.\n\nThis gift was received by Noble the Honourable George S. Henry Potentate of Rameses Shrine Temple Toronto, representing the citizens of Canada. On August 20, 1958 the surrounding garden and fountain, created by Toronto Parks Department was officially opened and the Memorial was re-dedicated to the cause of peace by Noble the Right Honourable John G. Diefenbaker, P.C., Prime Minister of Canada.\n\nSir Douglas Fir\n\nFrom the Shawnigan Lake Region of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, this Douglas Fir Flagpole is 184 feet in height, has a tip diameter of 15 inches, a butt diameter of 33 inches, weighs 35,000 pounds and is approximately 350 years old. It was erected by the Canadian National Exhibition Association in 1977 to replace the original flagpole which is described below.\n\nStanley Barracks\n\nThe British army established a military post here in 1840-41 to replace aging Fort York.\n\nKnown as the New Fort, it consisted of seven limestone buildings around a parade square, and a number of lesser structures. Massive defensive works were planned for the perimeter but never built. In 1893 the fort was renamed Stanley Barracks in honour of Governor General Lord Stanley. Canadian forces assumed responsibility for the post in 1870 and garrisoned it until 1947. The barracks then served as public housing until the early 1950’s, when all but this building, the Officers’ Quarters, were demolished.\n\nOntario Heritage Foundation, Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Recreation\n\nToronto Industrial Exhibition\n\nThis tablet is erected to perpetuate the memory of the founders of this exhibition which was first held on these grounds 1879.\n\nOriginal officers 1879\n\nPresident John J.

Stanley Barracks constructed in 1841 to replace Fort York, stood on this site until 1953. Only the Officers’ Quarters remain, located due south of this plaque.\n\nPlaced by the Ukrainian Canadian Civil Liberties Association & Ukrainian Community of Ontario, in co-operation with the Ukrainian Canadian Foundation of Tenn Sherchenko. 2 October 1998\n\nVimy Oaks Legacy\n\nVimy Oaks Legacy\n\nLegs des Chenes de Vimy\n\nThese Vimy Oaks are true descendants of the fallen oak trees that were destroyed during the Battle of Vimy Ridge, France, April 9-12, 1917.\n\nAcorns from the many fallen oaks (not a single one survived) were gathered and sent home to Scarborough, Ontario by a Canadian soldier, Lt. Leslie Miller, who fought in that battle. The acorns were planted on the family farm, later named “The Vimy Oaks” and still flourish there today.\n\nThese Vimy Oaks are a living tribute to all Canadian soldiers who fought in the First World War.\n\n2017\n\nThe Warriors' Day Parade\n\nAt the end of the First World War (1914-1918), activities took place across Canada to commemorate the country’s wartime efforts and to honour the over 60,000 Canadians lost.\n\nOne of the most significant and lasting events was a veterans’ parade held at the Canadian National Exhibition in 1919. Edward, Prince of Wales, opened the Exhibition and conducted a military review of the thousands of veterans who attended. In 1921, the annual parade became the highlight of the Exhibition New Warrior’s Day (later Warriors’ Day). The Warriors’ Day Parade has marched through the Princes’ Gates since 1927, honouring the veterans and the over 100,000 who perished in the Boer War, the Great War, the Second World War, the Korean War and in peacekeeping missions around the world.\n\nOntario Heritage Foundation, an agency of the government of Ontario\n\nWestervelt, Alexander Pattullo\n\nIn honoured memory of Alexander Pattullo Westervelt\n\nBorn Dec 3rd 1873 – died July 28th 1936\n\nManager of the Royal Agricultural Winter Fair 1922 – 1936\n\nHe served Canadian Agriculture in its highest branches with zeal and enthusiasm contributed to its prosperity and by able administration was instrumental in placing the Royal Agricultural Winter Fair in high rank among agricultural exhibitions on this continent.\n\nThis tablet was unveiled November 20th 1956 by his Excellency the Governor-General of Canada the Right Honourable the Lord Tweedsmuir, G.C.M.G., C.H. in the presence of former associates and friends.\n\nErected by the Royal Agricultural Winter Fair Association.\n\nThe Withrow Family\n\nThis plaque has been placed here to honour the Withrow family for their many contributions to the CNE, including its founding, and to the City of Toronto\n\nJohn J.
