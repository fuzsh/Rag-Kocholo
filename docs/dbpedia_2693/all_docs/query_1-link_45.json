        "text": "Friday, June 11, 2021\n\nAll the blue plaques in Newham\n\n1) Will Thorne [Trade Union Leader, Politician]\n\n1 Lawrence Road, West Ham, London, E13 0QD\n\nWill Thorne was a pioneer of the Trade Union movement, inspired by being on the sharp end of working practices since he was a child. He moved from Birmingham to London at the age of 25 and took a job at a gasworks, where the introduction of new machinery spurred him to call a meeting which led to the creation of the National Union of Gas Workers and General Labourers. This soon had over 20000 members and Will took the position of General Secretary for the next 35 years. He was later President of the Social Democratic Federation. Mayor of West Ham and for 41 years a local MP. His 94.9% share of the vote in the Plaistow constituency in 1918 has never been exceeded by any other Labour politician. He died of a heart attack at home shortly after stepping down from Parliament, having led a fascinating life.\n\nThe house stands on a quiet street corner a few streets west of Upton Park station. This is a pleasant and leafy residential zone, not so far from West Ham Park, rather than amid the close-packed terraces that characterise some other parts of Plaistow. 1 Lawrence Road is relatively substantial, with two sets of bay windows rather than one, and somehow still fully pebbledashed. The front door's actually round the side, with a large handle above the step to aid access for whoever lives inside. I could imagine a retired trade union official living here but not a leading MP, not any more, for what it's worth.\n\n2) Stanley Holloway [Actor, Singer]\n\n25 Albany Road, Manor Park, London, E12 5BE\n\nIn contrast, Stanley spent his childhood in Manor Park and then moved away when he became successful. His route out started out via singing in his local church choir, before taking to the boards just before and during the First World War. Stanley found success on the West End stage and became one of BBC Radio's first variety performers. He became famous for his monologues, notably the boy-eating The Lion and Albert, and later moved into film. He appeared in Passport to Pimlico, The Lavender Hill Mob and The Titfield Thunderbolt, but his career peaked with My Fair Lady where his portrayal of Alfred P Doolittle earned an Oscar nomination.\n\nI'd never been to Albany Road before this week because it's tucked away in a dead-end residential wedge between two railway lines. Even though Manor Park (Crossrail) and Woodgrange Park (Overground) stations are very close by, nobody would ever have a need to 'just pass through'. Perhaps because of this it's really pleasant, a street of cosy clustered houses with varied front gardens and lush hedges, and somewhere at least one cabbie chooses to call home. Number 25 has a narrow sloping porch, a small flowerbed and a diminutive parking space given over to two wheelie bins. Stanley'd probably laugh if you told him his 3-bed terrace was now worth half a million.\n\nAnd that's it, there are only two blue plaques in the London borough of Newham.\n\nI'm talking official English Heritage blue plaques here, not any local scheme (like that operated by Southwark council). Newham have erected a handful, the latest of which is on a wall behind a pharmacy in Woodgrange Road, Forest Gate. It marks the site of the Upper Cut Club, a music venue where Jimi Hendrix played on Boxing Day 1966 and where he wrote Purple Haze while waiting for the gig. That's a fantastic story, and much more interesting than the usual 'lived here', but you can perhaps see why it didn't make the English Heritage cut.\n\nBexley also only has two blue plaques, one at Red House where William Morris lived and one for Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh. Given that there are 970 blue plaques in Greater London, Bexley and Newham are pitifully represented.\n\nIt gets worse. Three boroughs somehow only have one blue plaque.\n\n» Barking & Dagenham has a plaque to footballer Bobby Moore in Waverley Gardens, just off the A13.\n\n» Brent's sole blue plaque is for comedian Arthur Lucan a.k.a. Arthur Towle, Old Mother Riley.\n\n» Sutton's singular plaque is for William Hale White, the novelist Mark Rutherford.\n\nn.b. The City of London has only one official blue plaque, tucked away in Gough Square off Fleet Street. It's for lexicographer Dr Samuel Johnson, and what's more it isn't blue it's brown. But it was erected by The Society of Arts in 1876, just before the City Corporation took responsibility for all commemorations within its boundary, and their subsequent blue rectangles don't count as official blue plaques.\n\nIt gets worse. Two boroughs have no blue plaques at all, namely Havering and Hillingdon, not because nobody famous ever lived there but because English Heritage's scheme is historically skewed.\n\nTo illustrate this skew, the borough of Westminster has an astonishing 316 blue plaques, that's 33% of London's overall total. Kensington & Chelsea is next with 185 blue plaques, that's 19%, followed by Camden with 173 (or 18%). This means Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea have over half the total all by themselves, and Westminster, Kensington & Chelsea and Camden have 70%. Admittedly these three boroughs were once very much the heart of well-to-do residential London, back when art was being painted, books written and inventions discovered, but it still feels geographically short-sighted.\n\nOnly 14 other boroughs' plaques scrape into double figures, and only Richmond, Wandsworth, Lambeth, Hammersmith & Fulham and Tower Hamlets exceed 20. And even these don't reach 30, which would be the borough average if only the glut of plaques in the West End were equalled out. A bit of future diversity wouldn't go amiss, not just regarding who we commemorate but also where.\n\nposted 07:00 :\n\n<< click for Newer posts\n\nclick for Older Posts >>\n\nclick to return to the main page\n\nLife viewed from London E3\n\n» email me\n\n» follow me on twitter\n\n» follow the blog on Twitter\n\n» follow the blog on RSS\n\n» my flickr photostream\n\ntwenty blogs\n\nour bow\n\narseblog\n\nian visits\n\nlondonist\n\nbroken tv\n\nblue witch\n\non london\n\nthe great wen\n\nedith's streets\n\nspitalfields life\n\nlinkmachinego\n\nround the island\n\nwanstead meteo\n\nchristopher fowler\n\nthe greenwich wire\n\nbus and train user\n\nruth's coastal walk\n\nround the rails we go\n\nlondon reconnections\n\nfrom the murky depths\n\nquick reference features\n\nThings to do in Outer London\n\nThings to do outside London\n\nLondon's waymarked walks\n\nInner London toilet map\n\n20 years of blog series\n\nThe DG Tour of Britain\n\nLondon's most...\n\nread the archive\n\nAug24 Jul24 Jun24 May24\n\nApr24 Mar24 Feb24 Jan24\n\nDec23 Nov23 Oct23 Sep23\n\nAug23 Jul23 Jun23 May23\n\nApr23 Mar23 Feb23 Jan23\n\nDec22 Nov22 Oct22 Sep22\n\nAug22 Jul22 Jun22 May22\n\nApr22 Mar22 Feb22 Jan22\n\nDec21 Nov21 Oct21 Sep21\n\nAug21 Jul21 Jun21 May21\n\nApr21 Mar21 Feb21 Jan21\n\nDec20 Nov20 Oct20 Sep20\n\nAug20 Jul20 Jun20 May20\n\nApr20 Mar20 Feb20 Jan20\n\nDec19 Nov19 Oct19 Sep19\n\nAug19 Jul19 Jun19 May19\n\nApr19 Mar19 Feb19 Jan19\n\nDec18 Nov18 Oct18 Sep18\n\nAug18 Jul18 Jun18 May18\n\nApr18 Mar18 Feb18 Jan18\n\nDec17 Nov17 Oct17 Sep17\n\nAug17 Jul17 Jun17 May17\n\nApr17 Mar17 Feb17 Jan17\n\nDec16 Nov16 Oct16 Sep16\n\nAug16 Jul16 Jun16 May16\n\nApr16 Mar16 Feb16 Jan16\n\nDec15 Nov15 Oct15 Sep15\n\nAug15 Jul15 Jun15 May15\n\nApr15 Mar15 Feb15 Jan15\n\nDec14 Nov14 Oct14 Sep14\n\nAug14 Jul14 Jun14 May14\n\nApr14 Mar14 Feb14 Jan14\n\nDec13 Nov13 Oct13 Sep13\n\nAug13 Jul13 Jun13 May13\n\nApr13 Mar13 Feb13 Jan13\n\nDec12 Nov12 Oct12 Sep12\n\nAug12 Jul12 Jun12 May12\n\nApr12 Mar12 Feb12 Jan12\n\nDec11 Nov11 Oct11 Sep11\n\nAug11 Jul11 Jun11 May11\n\nApr11 Mar11 Feb11 Jan11\n\nDec10 Nov10 Oct10 Sep10\n\nAug10 Jul10 Jun10 May10\n\nApr10 Mar10 Feb10 Jan10\n\nDec09 Nov09 Oct09 Sep09\n\nAug09 Jul09 Jun09 May09\n\nApr09 Mar09 Feb09 Jan09\n\nDec08 Nov08 Oct08 Sep08\n\nAug08 Jul08 Jun08 May08\n\nApr08 Mar08 Feb08 Jan08\n\nDec07 Nov07 Oct07 Sep07\n\nAug07 Jul07 Jun07 May07\n\nApr07 Mar07 Feb07 Jan07\n\nDec06 Nov06 Oct06 Sep06\n\nAug06 Jul06 Jun06 May06\n\nApr06 Mar06 Feb06 Jan06\n\nDec05 Nov05 Oct05 Sep05\n\nAug05 Jul05 Jun05 May05\n\nApr05 Mar05 Feb05 Jan05\n\nDec04 Nov04 Oct04 Sep04\n\nAug04 Jul04 Jun04 May04\n\nApr04 Mar04 Feb04 Jan04\n\nDec03 Nov03 Oct03 Sep03\n\nAug03 Jul03 Jun03 May03\n\nApr03 Mar03 Feb03 Jan03\n\nDec02 Nov02 Oct02 Sep02\n\nback to main page\n\nthe diamond geezer index\n\n2023 2022\n\n2021 2020 2019 2018 2017\n\n2016 2015 2014 2013 2012\n\n2011 2010 2009 2008 2007\n\n2006 2005 2004 2003 2002\n\nmy special London features\n\na-z of london museums\n\nE3 -
