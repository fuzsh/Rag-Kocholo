And perhaps, if in a dreamy way you connected with William Glasby the man who made it he might take you on a journey from Lambeth “where houses thick, and sewers, annoy the air.” to rural Henfield via Pakistan, Afghanistan, Atlanta, the Punjab and nearly finishing up in a skip in Henfield. On 28 December 1863 William Glasby was born to Rebecca the wife of William Henry Glasby a carpet porter. They lived in Church Terrace, Waterloo Road, London\n\nFull article\n\nA Hugely Influential and Very Talented Brighton Musician\n\nPosted in History on Mar 01, 2024\n\nFriday 8th March is International Women’s Day and Brighton Philharmonic Orchestra have some special plans to help celebrate. Their women led orchestra will be performing at the Brighton Dome Concert Hall, a programme set to showcase music by female composers entitled The Mighty River: Celebrating Women. As far as I know, no-one is suggesting that the audience or, indeed, the players will be obliged to wear purple, the official colour of International Women’s Day, but celebrating women and their achievements in a field traditionally dominated by men is seen as important.\n\nFull article\n\nGeorge IV’s enchanted party palace\n\nPosted in History on Feb 01, 2024\n\nThe Royal Pavilion sprang almost entirely from George IV’s creative mind. He was nothing if not daring, often verging on the reckless in his lifestyle, design ideas and spending habits and thus gave us what is surely the most extravagant, madly beautiful, and romantic of all historic buildings in Britain. It was the expression of a man who loved partying and entertaining, as well as being admired and flattered. The Pavilion was, as a guidebook from the 1820s puts it, ‘an enchanted place’, a ‘fairyland’, and always intended to be a place for amusement, where rules were different from those at the London court.\n\nFull article\n\n‘Devil take me!’ George IV’s enchanted party palace\n\nPosted in History on Jan 01, 2024\n\nThe Royal Pavilion sprang almost entirely from George IV’s creative mind.

When a poem by the great anti-war-poet Siegfried Sassoon, possibly the only Sassoon still recognised, was published in 1927 containing the lines- “I accuse the rich of what they’ve always done before – Of lifting worldly faces to a diamond star.” – on the day his aunt, another Sassoon, died he wouldn’t have known that she would leave him enough money to buy a house. However, he would have known that the money could be traced back to Bombay in 1832 and his great-grandfather David Sassoon.\n\nFull article\n\nMourning a Monarch\n\nPosted in History on Sep 01, 2023\n\nElaborate royal funeral rituals began to develop in parts of medieval and Renaissance Europe – wherever and whenever the heir to the throne was publicly declared and acknowledged before the death of the king. Where there was chaos and confusion between rival claimants, by the time the heir apparent had assembled his supporters and arranged his coronation, little time or resources remained for organising a glorious burial for his predecessor. However, once the transition of titles and political power became smoother, the way was clear for magnificent public funeral processions and services that symbolised the sovereignty of the Crown. No expense was spared in royal and aristocratic circles and the wearing of special mourning clothes was a key element of the ritual, a powerful display of wealth and rank.\n\nFull article\n\nA Tilt of Windmills\n\nPosted in History on Aug 01, 2023\n\n<p>In the nineteenth century, there were up to twenty-five windmills in Brighton and over a thousand in the UK. They would either have been a post mill, a smock mill or a tower mill, and there was probably one in your neighbourhood where you and local farmers and smallholders would take your corn to be ground into flour. They were as prevalent as phone boxes and chip shops were in the 1960s. They were put centrally, where people could reach them and where they could get good clean wind. They were on the hills and beside the sea: Hanover, Toronto Terrace, Albion Hill, Rose Hill, Round Hill, Clifto...</p>\n\nFull article\n\n“A Friend of Princes and a Prince of Friends.”\n\nPosted in History on Jul 01, 2023\n\nIn the early 1900s, Brighton, like many other seaside resorts, was in decline. No longer patronised by royalty, its fashionable visitors were long gone, and the middle classes elsewhere, it was, according to the Daily Mail, an “unenterprising, unattractive and outdated holiday resort”. Where others saw a decline, Harry Preston saw an opportunity. He bought the almost derelict Royal York Hotel in the Old Steine (now a youth hostel) in 1901 and began a career in Brighton that would turn him into the city’s foremost hotelier, the friend of kings and a major force in the city’s transformation over the next forty years.\n\nFull article\n\nThe Sale of a Pleasure Palace by the Sea\n\nPosted in History on May 01, 2023\n\nThe Prince Regent, who became George IV, created the Estate at the cost of £1.2 million (£145 million in today’s money.) He paid his last visit to the Pavilion in March 1827, three years before his death in June 1830. His brother William IV inherited and was a regular visitor before he died in 1837. Queen Victoria then succeeded him and her last visit was in 1845. The Royal Pavilion was shut and stripped. It was recorded that the Department of Woods and Forests, which had responsibility for the Estate, ‘had set so liberal an interpretation of the word ‘fixtures’, that in carrying off the pier-glasses, grates and marble chimney-pieces, their agents had nearly carried off the building itself.’\n\nFull article\n\nMan From Patcham Helps Decide Fate of the Monarchy\n\nPosted in History on Apr 01, 2023\n\nIt seems only right that we have an interest in the men and women who have shaped the course of English history. What is a little more perplexing is the fascination many of us have with our reigning kings and queens. From Athelstan, the first King of England, who reigned from AD927 to 939, up to Charles III, we revel in their strengths and achievements and in their flaws and indiscretions. Who knows what the history books will say about the new King Charles, one just hopes his story will not be as ‘bloody’ as that of his namesake, Charles I.\n\nFull article\n\nThe Brighton engine works and the goods yard, part two\n\nPosted in History on Mar 01, 2023\n\nIn this second half of the article, I will show you some of the many engine designs manufactured in the Brighton works. The steam locomotive is a very simple design; water is heated to a very high temperature which turns into steam and the steam is then used to push rods out of a cylinder, which propels the locomotive through a set of connecting cranks. The first locomotives built in Brighton looked like the image top right.\n\nFull article\n\nThe Brighton engine works and the goods yard, part one\n\nPosted in History on Feb 01, 2023\n\nIt may come as a surprise to many that Brighton once made steam locomotives and boasted an extensive railway goods yard in the centre of the city. This two-part article will give a brief picture of the two facilities. Brighton once had a lot of manufacturing and engineering and these two articles touch on a small section of that history.\n\nFull article\n\nCosy Indoors\n\nPosted in History on Jan 01, 2023\n\nKeeping warm in winter has never been such a ‘hot’ topic as it is today, but we live in modern times: just how did earlier generations manage? Heating the home. When I was an infant in the early-1960s, on winter mornings there were exciting Jack Frost patterns on the inside of my bedroom window in our village house. My dad then remembered that as a schoolboy in 1920s London he sometimes had to break ice on the surface of the water jug before he could wash. Clearly, before modern domestic central heating created a warm ambience throughout the home, people were accustomed to chilly interiors and generally felt cooler than we expect to today.\n\nFull article\n\nPeacehaven Beyond the Rural Idyll\n\nPosted in History on Nov 01, 2022\n\nPeacehaven is the only town in the United Kingdom named after “peace”, or so I believe. What is more certain is that both the creation of the town and its name have close links with the First World War. But look beyond the lofty ideals of ‘homes fit for heroes’ and the ‘rural idyll’ and there is a darker story involving duplicity, legal shenanigans, and a fundraising scam. And it all centres around a man called Charles Neville.\n\nFull article\n\nA Different Story for 1953\n\nPosted in History on Aug 01, 2022\n\nYou will have noticed that over the last few months a lot of attention has been given to 1953. Of course, it was the year of the Queen’s coronation, but what else happened during those 12 months? What happened specifically in our area? I decided to have a little “Google about” and see what I could uncover and the event that caught my attention was Billy Butlin opening The Ocean Hotel, Saltdean on 2nd May 1953.\n\nFull article\n\nThe Past is a Different Country\n\nPosted in History on Jun 01, 2022\n\nWe were a lot poorer in Britain at the time of the Queen’s Accession, the average wage was just £5 - £105 in today’s terms after inflation. The average house cost £2064 and only 8% of the population owned their homes - compared to almost 70% today. There was less pressure to buy, many people were housed by the local authority and did not even consider buying.\n\nFull article\n\nA History of Brighton Trams Part 2\n\nPosted in History on May 01, 2022\n\nI am very grateful that the first article was so well received, so here is a little more on the Brighton trams. I will explain the types of trams that Brighton ran, journey times and frequency and also what is left of the tramways today. Brighton corporation started and continued with a basic open topped 4-wheeler tram. As mentioned before, the narrow gauge of 3 foot and 6 inches did cause design limitations, but there were 6 distinct types, lettered A to F.\n\nFull article\n\nDame Anita Roddick\n\nPosted in History on Apr 01, 2022\n\nOn the 27th March 1976 Dame Anita Roddick opened her first Body Shop. The location she chose was No. 22 Kensington Gardens, Brighton. Anyone around the North Laines at that time will remember the excitement they experienced walking into this “funky”, new shop. Hard to imagine today, but everything about it seemed innovative and modern – so very different from the beauty industry that we were used to.\n\nFull article\n\nThe Daily Mail 8th March 1921\n\nPosted in History on Mar 01, 2022\n\nWhatever our personal preferences, the Daily Mail (founded 1896) with its middle-market readership, remains the UK’s highest-circulated daily newspaper: indeed, the early Daily Mail broadsheet was unique in that, from the outset, it aimed to attract female readers. Following the Great War (1914-1918) and years of controversial reporting, it focused on lightweight topics like fashion, the home, travel and music. When the commercial company Historic Newspapers sent me an original newspaper dated 8th March 1921, I recognised an unparalleled historical source for studying past lives and times on the eve of the 1921 Census.\n\nFull article\n\nA Hawaiian Princess in Hove\n\nPosted in History on Oct 01, 2021\n\nMany moons ago a friend and retired Town Planner told me the story of how he had been approached by a woman wanting to secure a Blue Plaque for a house in Cambridge Road, Hove where, during the late Victorian period, a Hawaiian princess had lived. Nothing came of the application and the story might have disappeared into the annals of Brighton’s history had it not been for Jane Couldrey who, in 2014, made an installation artwork, including a short film, for exhibition in Hove Museum all about Princess Ka’iuluni’s life: a life full of thwarted expectations.\n\nFull article\n\nA short history of the Brighton Trams\n\nPosted in History on Sep 01, 2021\n\nAs far back as 1864 a system of horse trams had been presented to Brighton council. This scheme was rejected on the grounds that the streets around the Hanover district were too steep for horse trams to operate on. Towards the turn of the century and with the development of electric trams, an electric tramways system became a viable proposition and in November of 1898 a Parliamentary bill was prepared enabling the town council to go ahead with a tramway system.\n\nFull article\n\nSummer Sandals\n\nPosted in History on Jul 01, 2021\n\nAt time of writing (early June) we are enjoying our first ‘heatwave’ of 2021 and many Sussex residents and visitors are wearing t-shirts, shorts, cotton dresses and sandals. Sandals are defined as an open style of footwear comprising a sole secured to the foot with straps over the instep and sometimes around the toes and/or ankle. Sandals may resemble certain other forms of footwear, but the term usually refers to styles that leave most of the foot exposed.\n\nFull article\n\nMary Adelaide Hare (1865-1945) A Woman of Note\n\nPosted in History on Jun 01, 2021\n\nEarlier this year the twenty-second full Office of National Statistics census took place in the UK. As usual, it counted people and households in England and Wales, but for the first-time respondents were required to answer the questions, all 51 of them, online. Other notable changes in the census procedure took place in 1911 when, for the first time, respondents were asked about their nationality, the duration of their marriage, the number of children born within that marriage, the number of living children and the number who had died. It was also the first census where the forms were completed by the householders and retained, rather than being copied into enumeration books.\n\nFull article\n\nHaile Selassie\n\nPosted in History on May 01, 2021\n\nBrighton has built a bit of a reputation as a place to see famous faces, with a long list of notable people who have visited over the years. They have come to our ‘city by the sea’, for all sorts of reasons - not just to be seen – but to enjoy our fashionable seafront, partake of our culture, embrace our liberal ways and, of course, go shopping. When His Imperial Majesty, Emperor Haile Selassie I, Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah, Elect of God, King of Kings of Ethiopia came he wanted to look at dairy farms!\n\nFull article\n\nLast Orders Please!\n\nPosted in History on Feb 01, 2021\n\nI read recently that the UK’s drinking habits are changing. Of course, this is related to Covid-19 restrictions, the closure of pubs and the move to home drinking, but it is also connected to the rise in non-alcoholic alternatives. It seems that more people, young and old, are developing a taste for booze-free beverages. Even in our house, for decades an outpost for Harvey’s Brewery, the odd bottle of Elderflower Pressé has made an appearance! Although, to be fair, the UK’s drinking culture and history of alcohol consumption has always been one of fluctuation and change.\n\nFull article\n\nHidden from History: A Statue for Mary Clarke\n\nPosted in History on Sep 01, 2020\n\nIn recent weeks people across the world, have been re-evaluating the political and cultural significance of statues. There is disquiet about who and what has been commemorated. There is also a recognition, one that has been growing since 2018 (the centenary of the first women getting the Vote) that, despite women’s many achievements, hardly any named statues across Britain commemorate them. Women have literally been ‘hidden from history’.\n\nFull article\n\nPreston Park Velodrome\n\nPosted in History on Jun 01, 2020\n\nThe Oldest, Working Velodrome in the World. During these strange days of Covid-19, when our lives and, in particular, our sporting lives (actual participant or the sofa-type) are restricted as never before, looking back on past freedoms seems like an activity in itself. Like filling a whole afternoon looking through old photographs and feeling worn-out by the endeavour!\n\nFull article\n\nHats Off!\n\nPosted in History on Mar 01, 2020\n\nPrompted by the windy weather, we decided this month to look briefly at male hats over the past 500 years. Head coverings were first used for warmth and protection, but soon assumed an additional ornamental and symbolic meaning as the wearing of headgear became a mark of identity, authority and respectability. Hats can be mainly functional (for example, helmets) but are usually considered dress items that complement or complete an outfit and so their style generally links to the prevailing fashion and trends in hairdressing. Hats can be tilted at different angles, adding an air of panache, like John Steed from The Avengers; certain hats have been popularly associated with famous individuals, like the homburg favoured by King Edward VII, Sherlock Holmes’s iconic deerstalker and Maurice Chevalier’s straw boater.\n\nFull article\n\nFamily Photographs from WWII\n\nPosted in History on Nov 01, 2019\n\nIn our November issue, coinciding with Remembrance Day, we often commemorate the servicemen and women, and others who have been involved in military conflicts. This year is extra-special, as September marked the 80th anniversary of the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. This has inspired much media coverage, while families and communities are also looking back to that turbulent time, still within living memory for some. Here we examine the kinds of photographic mementoes of WW2 that many of us have at home –studio portraits, formal group scenes and more casual snapshots that collectively record our families’ experiences of the Second World War.\n\nFull article\n\n‘Stop Me and Buy One’\n\nPosted in History on Aug 01, 2019\n\nThe first chilled delicacies date back millennia, to when the ancient Chinese, Romans and other early civilisations combined snow or ice with fruit juice or dairy products for the enjoyment of the social elite. In the Levant sharbat/sherbet became renowned as a summer refreshment, but this concoction, created by whisking ice shavings or snow into sugar syrup flavoured with fruit juices and floral essences, and Middle Eastern-style sherbets replicated in fashionable 17th-century London coffee houses weren’t genuine ices, but scented water-based drinks - sometimes cooled with ice or snow, never frozen.\n\nFull article\n\nA Short History of Gin\n\nPosted in History on Jun 01, 2019\n\nIn the 18th century, long before effective water purification and treatment systems were discovered, quenching the thirst could be hazardous, even deadly. Historically most people consumed ale or light beer, the wealthy enjoyed wine, children were given milk and paupers usually had to drink unsafe water. Enter alcoholic spirits, notably gin - affordable and widely available. Vendors roamed the streets pushing handcarts loaded with gin that, costing only one penny a quarter-pint, was far cheaper than either beer or ale. Gin temporarily disguised the feeling of cold and the hunger pangs of the poorest and most vulnerable in Georgian society: it also led to crime, debt, unemployment, neglect and death. Women, particularly, often bought gin as a medicinal drink to soothe the nerves, possibly giving rise to the epithet ‘Mother’s ruin’, although its precise origins are debateable.\n\nFull article\n\nA Walk in the Park\n\nPosted in History on May 01, 2019\n\nAs the days grow longer and the outdoors beckons, we appreciate more than ever the beautiful public parks of Brighton & Hove. There is a fascinating history attached to city parks – open green spaces for the relaxation and enjoyment of all. An early example is St James’s Park in Westminster, open to the public since the 1660s. However, most municipal parks developed later, many becoming established in the Victorian age.\n\nFull article\n\nTattoos over Time\n\nPosted in History on Apr 01, 2019\n\nToday in Brighton tattoos are everywhere and we have several established tattoo studios. Although not always so fashionable as they are today, tattooing dates back millennia, both scar tattooing and primitive puncture tattooing being practised since Neolithic times. Early tattoos may sometimes have had a medicinal function: the mummified body of Otzi, ‘the Tyrolean Iceman’ (4th century BC) had multiple small markings apparently created by cutting the skin and rubbing in charcoal; concentrated around joints and the lower back, their locations suggest the relief of rheumatic pain, possibly an early form of acupuncture.\n\nFull article\n\nLonely Hearts\n\nPosted in History on Feb 01, 2019\n\nWe might be forgiven for thinking that today’s internet dating, introduction agencies and lonely hearts advertisements are a modern phenomenon, but the open search for love and marriage dates back centuries. The first known ‘lonely heart’ advertisement in the world (supported by firm evidence) appeared in England in 1695, in a weekly pamphlet. The Licensing of the Press Act restricting printing and publishing had recently lapsed, prompting a young man to place the following advertisement: ‘30 years old and in possession of a good estate and who desires to meet a young gentlewoman with a fortune of £300.’\n\nFull article\n\nDieting through the Ages\n\nPosted in History on Jan 01, 2019\n\nJanuary is the month for New Year’s Resolutions and top of many lists will be getting trim and fit after the inevitable extravagances of Christmas. Dieting and preoccupation with body image may have reached extremes in our modern world, yet such concerns are not new, for history reveals a catalogue of attempts at weight management, from alcohol, pills, cigarettes and soap to healthy eating programmes.\n\nFull article\n\nBest Foot Forward: Children’s Shoes\n\nPosted in History on Sep 01, 2018\n\nWhen I was young and moaning about having to wear boring regulation school shoes, my Dad told me to consider myself lucky, as when he was a child in 1920s London some of his classmates had no shoes at all, attending school in bare feet. This seemed unbelievable to me, but, sadly, was true: leather shoes and boots were expensive and often difficult for large families to afford, especially in the days before the welfare state.\n\nFull article\n\nIn the Shade: A History of Parasols\n\nPosted in History on Aug 01, 2018\n\nParasols closely resemble umbrellas - and for good reason. The word ‘umbrella’ derives from Latin umbra (‘shade’) and initially the shade-giving device was used as essential protection from the sun. Ancient sculptures dating from around the 11th century BC reveal sunshades being used over 3,000 years ago in Egypt, India and the Middle East, and later they were adopted by the Ancient Greeks and Romans. Initially inspired by the shady canopies of trees, the first portable sunshades used in hot climates were literally large fleshy leaves, such as banana leaves, or even a converted tree branch.\n\nFull article\n\nBlue Plaque for Brighton Suffragettes?\n\nPosted in History on May 01, 2018\n\nWith many towns and cities marking the centenary of the 1918 Representation of the People Act with statues and plaques for their suffrage pioneers, it is not surprising that support is growing for a campaign to commemorate our Brighton Suffragettes with a blue plaque in the city centre. Hove already has a plaque to Victoria Liddiard, one of the last surviving Suffragettes, who died in 1992 at the age of 102.\n\nFull article\n\nHow does your garden grow?\n\nPosted in History on May 01, 2018\n\nAfter a disappointing start to the gardening year, hopefully by May we shall be tending the flowerbeds and enjoying a profusion of spring blooms. People have long grown plants for food, clothing and medicine, but until around 1800, gardening for pleasure was an exclusive pastime for a privileged minority. So how have we become a nation of gardeners?\n\nFull article\n\nMaking Eyes\n\nPosted in History on Feb 01, 2018\n\nSince the Stone Age humans have adorned themselves using colour, initially during rituals and later for decorative effect. By the time of the ancient civilisations of the Near/Middle East and adjacent Mediterranean region, sophisticated personal grooming practices and widespread use of beauty aids were well established. Early face paints were mineral pigments ground into powder, certain preparations being used to shade and outline the eyes. At Ur (in today’s southern Iraq) Sumerian eye cosmetics were buried with the dead c.2500 BC: cockleshell containers held multi-coloured pigments including purple, blue, green and black. These closely resembled substances found in ancient Egypt (c.3100- 332 BC) and elsewhere: copper compounds produced greens and blues and galena – a dark grey ore – created kohl. Mixed with water or oil, the paste was applied to the eyes with a finger or an applicator of wood or bone.\n\nFull article\n\nChristmas Greetings\n\nPosted in History on Dec 01, 2017\n\nLike many of the festive customs we enjoy today, exchanging greetings cards with relatives, friends and neighbours originated over 170 years ago in Victorian Britain, at a time when early Christmas rituals like carols were being revived and new customs embraced. The first commercial Christmas card was introduced by Sir Henry Cole, a civil servant and inventor who had assisted Sir Rowland Hill with the launch of the Uniform Penny Post in January 1840. Previously, postage had been prohibitively expensive, but the pre-paid penny post was both efficient and affordable for the wider population and sending items through the post gained in popularity. On 1st May 1843, Cole commissioned the artist John Callcott Horsley to design a special card for people to send at Christmas. Horsley’s hand-coloured illustration portraying an affluent family enjoying a lavish meal and raising their wine glasses to the onlooker was reportedly controversial, considered irreligious by some; however, two runs of Horsley’s cards were printed, totalling 2,050, and all sold within that year at one shilling each. The Christmas card tradition was born.\n\nFull article\n\nWW1: Women in Uniform\n\nPosted in History on Nov 01, 2017\n\nRemembering this November the loyal and courageous men and women who served in times of war and following the continuing 1914-1918 Centenary commemorations, here we revisit the evolving role of women during the Great War. Our article of November 2015 considered those who trained as VAD nurses and undertook transport and postal work early on, more becoming ‘munitionettes’ and labouring in heavy industry, particularly from 1915. As the rising death toll overseas fuelled demand for more servicemen, prompting conscription in 1916, so women became indispensable on the Home Front, some eventually being recruited into military units. By 1917 an unprecedented number of British women were in uniform.\n\nFull article\n\nHarvest Home\n\nPosted in History on Sep 01, 2017\n\nSeptember: children are returning to school and days are shortening. The harvest is in and summer will soon incline towards autumn. The word ‘harvest’ originally derived from the Old English word hærfest, meaning ‘autumn’, then came to describe the season for reaping and gathering grain and other crops. Since pagan times in Britain, thanks have been given for successful harvests, through prayer, feasting and celebrations.\n\nFull article\n\nBathing Machines and Beach Tents\n\nPosted in History on Aug 01, 2017\n\nHigh summer and school’s out! Off to the beach…Our love of the seaside dates back centuries, originating with the spas visited for therapeutic purposes. In around 1626 a natural spring was discovered beneath cliffs near Scarborough, mineral water that proved an effective remedy for minor ailments. Sea water began to be identified as having similar curative properties to spring water and learned medical publications extolled the benefits of both sea bathing and drinking sea water. Subsequently Scarborough evolved into a sophisticated commercialized town, Britain’s first seaside resort; by the mid-1700s Brighton, Margate, Weymouth and other well-appointed coastal settlements were also attracting a wealthy, fashionable clientele.\n\nFull article\n\n‘The bathing was so delightful this morning’\n\nPosted in History on Jun 01, 2017\n\nFrom 17 June, a new display at the Royal Pavilion in Brighton will explore Jane Austen’s relationship with coastal towns and life in Brighton during her time, to mark the bicentenary of her death. Jane Austen by the Sea will look at the seaside context of Austen’s novels and letters and paint a picture of the fashionable seaside resorts in the late 18th and early 19th century. When I was asked to curate a display on one of the most important and influential writers in literary history, I was thrilled, especially as it was through literature that I fell in love with the English language and British culture in general.\n\nFull article\n\nCONSTABLE & BRIGHTON\n\nPosted in History on May 01, 2017\n\nBrighton is having a bit of a John Constable moment this year. A beautiful exhibition of his seaside paintings runs at the Brighton Museum & Art Gallery from April to October and, during Brighton Festival in May, his former home and studio in the city will be an Open House - with artists making modern works inspired by his vivid landscapes.\n\nFull article\n\nWinter Warmers: Hand-knitting\n\nPosted in History on Feb 01, 2017\n\nAs winter drags on, we look at the history of hand-knitted clothes. An ancient, widely-practised craft, knitting is the creation of fabric from a single thread formed into horizontal rows of loops that interlock with each subsequent row. Historically, the natural yarns available were linen, hemp, wool and later cotton, although wool was often favoured for its softness and warmth. For centuries, wooden sticks, bone, ivory or quills were the basic hand-tools used, until fine steel needles became more commonplace in the 1800s. Over time, diverse customs evolved in different areas, regional variations giving the knitting of specific locations a strong visual identity; yet the familiar knit and purl loop construction was almost universal and similar knitted textiles have been produced worldwide for centuries.\n\nFull article\n\nThe Forever Changing Face of The North Laine\n\nPosted in History on Jan 01, 2017\n\nI used to live in the North Laine, we moved there in January 1985 and I can’t tell you how exciting it was. We could open the door of our Robert Street house and (if we avoided getting run over by Argus lorries) find everything we needed just steps away: there was a fish monger, a butcher, a baker and a green grocer just in Sydney Street alone; in Gardner Street, a small Tescos, a purveyor of eggs and a shop that sold shoes for vegetarians. Then there was delicious bread from Infinity Foods, a selection of great pubs, and, for a truly new shopping experience, a visit to Anita Roddick’s Body Shop in Kensington Gardens. As young people-about-town we really didn’t want for more!\n\nFull article\n\nChristmas shopping traditions\n\nPosted in History on Dec 01, 2016\n\nThe rampant consumerism at this time of year can seem excessive, almost overwhelming, and yet the avalanche of marketing and merchandise is not entirely new, as Christmas shopping has been big business for generations. Well over a century ago, advertisements for seasonal goods loomed large on billboards, sandwich boards and posters, filled handbills and periodicals, while many shops began stocking their festive fare in September or October.\n\nFull article\n\nBehind the Wheel\n\nPosted in History on Oct 01, 2016\n\nOn 6th November a unique local spectacle takes place, the London to Brighton Veteran Car Run. Organised by the Royal Automobile Club (RAC) and Bonhams, this is the world’s longest-running motoring event, attracting participants and spectators from around the globe. The original Emancipation Run of 14th November 1896 celebrated the passing of the Locomotives on the Highway Act (or ‘Red Flag Act’) that raised the official road speed limit for ‘light locomotives’ from 4mph to 14mph and abolished the requirement for a man on foot to precede these vehicles. The event was first formally re-enacted in 1927 and has been commemorated every subsequent November, except during WW2 and in 1947, when petrol was rationed. This year marks the 120th anniversary of the original 1896 Emancipation Run.\n\nFull article\n\nDressed for Action\n\nPosted in History on Aug 01, 2016\n\nWith the focus now on the Olympic Games, we look back at nineteenth and early-twentieth century sports and sportswear. Before the first modern Olympic Games in 1896, men enjoyed energetic activities like football, rowing and athletics, wearing comfortable adaptations of regular dress or early sportswear. Conversely, undertaking strenuous exercise and winning at competitive events weren’t deemed appropriate for Victorian ladies and underlying these issues were deep-rooted concerns over dress, particularly the ‘immodest’ exposure of the legs, or even their clothed outline. It wasn’t considered decent for women to wear the kinds of clothes that would provide the physical freedom needed to excel in sports and early female sportswear aimed to conceal, hampering the progress of female competition sport. Only in the early-1900s when clothing conventions began to relax, did a shift occur, the gradual development of more modern, movement-enhancing sportswear furthering the expansion of the Games and sporting prowess.\n\nFull article\n\nNew Road – One of the Most Popular Places in the City\n\nPosted in History on Jul 01, 2016\n\nIn May I wrote about the Brighton Unitarian Church and, whilst doing my research, stumbled upon some interesting stories about the construction and history of New Road. It is now one of the most popular places to visit in the City, but it started as just a small part of the Prince Regent’s convoluted plan to form an enclosed estate around the Pavilion.\n\nFull article\n\nBrighton Unitarian Church “At Risk”\n\nPosted in History on May 01, 2016\n\nDuring this year’s festival season, New Road will be positively humming with activity. If you find yourselves there, on the way to the Dome theatre perhaps, watching a street performance or just sitting outside a pub soaking up the festival spirit, take a minute to look at the buildings around you. There is one, in particular, different to all the adjacent buildings that I think is definitely worth exploring.\n\nFull article\n\nA Well Kept Secret: The Largest Municipal Rock Garden in Britain\n\nPosted in History on Apr 01, 2016\n\nIf asked to write a list of all the public gardens in Brighton, I suspect most people would forget to include The Rockery. This really is one of Brighton’s best kept “secrets”. It gets overlooked by residents and is largely unknown to the countless people who drive past it every day. So, in its 80th year, the Garden Manager, Andy Jeavons, and I thought it would be a good idea to shine a little light on its history, the way it is now and plans for the future.\n\nFull article\n\nWearing the Trousers\n\nPosted in History on Mar 01, 2016\n\nWho wears the trousers in your house? Unlike modern women, who dress mainly as they please, earlier generations were both restricted and defined as the weaker sex by their ‘petticoats’. As we mark Mother’s Day and International Women’s Day in March, let’s consider some of the pioneering women who defied convention by literally wearing the trousers (or bloomers or breeches), ignoring censure and paving the way for the sartorial freedoms enjoyed today.\n\nFull article\n\nWinter Sports and sportswear\n\nPosted in History on Jan 01, 2016\n\nNow, in the depths of winter, we can enjoy seasonal outdoor activities. Festive ice-skating rinks are open to the public at the Royal Pavilion, Brighton and at other picturesque venues, while the dazzling slopes of ski and snowboarding resorts beckon energetic holiday-makers. Expertise in traversing the ice and snow are nothing new: for millennia, the inhabitants of cold climates have had to negotiate snowy landscapes and frozen wastes in order to survive; but in recent centuries what were once essential skills have evolved into pleasurable leisure pursuits and serious competitive sports.\n\nFull article\n\nFemale Uniforms of War: 1915\n\nPosted in History on Nov 01, 2015\n\nDuring the First World War (1914-18) more British women adopted uniforms than ever before. Apart from the standardised dress worn by nuns, nurses, domestic servants and members of the Salvation Army, adult females had scarcely been seen in uniform, but the proliferation of new war-related organisations created an unprecedented demand for outfits that would create identity, foster an esprit de corps and demonstrate their wearer’s role. Yet initially, when war erupted in August 1914, women struggled to gain the right to serve and to be seen doing their duty. Warfare was considered a masculine arena: genteel ladies were traditionally regarded as passive home-makers, while working women often held subservient positions, so in the early months of the conflict the expected role of females was, in general, not to undertake active work, but to support their men folk and urge them to sign up. Everything would change in 1915.\n\nFull article\n\nStories from the Sewers\n\nPosted in History on Jul 01, 2015\n\nToday the provision of a safe water supply and the removal of wastes are things that are seldom at the forefront of people’s thoughts, but in past centuries these were major concerns. A water supply is often seen as key to establishing a settlement; locally we describe communities such as Poynings or Plumpton as ‘spring-line settlements’. Small communities can cope with provision of drinking water and the disposal of wastes, but with urban and industrial growth demand for these services outstrips the capacity. During the early years of the 19th century Brighton experienced a massive population growth [103% between 1811and 1821] as a depressed agricultural economy drove people from rural Sussex to booming urban settlements on the coast. These people arrived seeking work and somewhere to live, bringing with them such few possessions as they had, which could include donkeys, cooped hens and a pig or two; all of which would be housed alongside human residents.\n\nFull article\n\nBridal fashions, 1840s-1940s\n\nPosted in History on Jun 01, 2015\n\nSpring always brings seasonal wedding fairs and June is a popular month for weddings. White bridal ensembles were fashionable within early-Victorian high society, for white garments (difficult to care for) signified elevated status and the colour carried Christian associations of innocence, purity and inferred virginity. This vogue evolved into a tradition following Queen Victoria’s wedding to Prince Albert in February 1840. Declining the customary heavy state robes, the young queen favoured a light toilette comprising a creamy-white Spitalfields silk dress with a deep Honiton lace flounce and white satin court train ornamented with orange-blossom, on her head a wreath of orange-blossom attached to a lace veil. Her twelve train-bearers also wore white dresses and the charming impression conveyed by the bevy of white-clad ladies was captured in the visual images and popular souvenirs widely circulated after the event.\n\nFull article\n\nFestival Time!\n\nPosted in History on May 01, 2015\n\nWhilst now two distinct entities, together, Brighton Festival and Brighton Fringe Festival create the largest arts festival in England; putting Brighton right on the international cultural calendar. This is a spectacular achievement and one that deserves to be made a song and dance about and, in 2016, in its 50th anniversary year, the organisers of Brighton Festival intend to do just that. Plans are already being hatched to roll out the red carpet for some really special events. But, ahead of their celebrations, I thought it would be an idea to look back to see how it all came about.\n\nFull article\n\n“Tuppence, Please!”\n\nPosted in History on Mar 01, 2015\n\nIn conversation with my friend Lavender, I mentioned that I was looking for a Brighton “character” to write about and she suggested Henry Ratty. How could I resist such a name? Disappointingly though, my research failed to uncover a tale of passion, sacrifice or murder, but he can be credited with a sort of celebrity, at least historian John George Bishop, writing in 1897, thought so: “There were few men better known to Brighton visitors and residents than Mr Henry Ratty. He was regarded as a Brighton “character” and his good-tempered, smiling features, and obliging manner were long borne in remembrance by many old Brightonians”. It can also be said that Henry was closely associated with a golden period in the town’s development, when, for a time, it was the busiest cross-channel port in Britain.\n\nFull article\n\nThe Turbulent Life and Times of Sake Dean Mahomed aka “Dr Brighton” (1759 – 1851)\n\nPosted in History on Feb 01, 2015\n\nThe history of Asian immigration to Britain does not begin in the 1950s, with post-war labour demands; it goes back much further to the founding of the East India Company in the 1600s and an early and distinctive chapter in this history features Sake Dean Mahomed (also Deen Mohomet). Travelling from India to make a home here, Mahomed demonstrated a resourcefulness and adaptability that was quite remarkable. His skill at reinvention enabled him to move from boy soldier in India to our very own Dr Brighton and, along the way, be the first Indian to publish a book, own a restaurant and do “shampooing” in England.\n\nFull article\n\n“May Everything Go Off Nice And Smooth This Xmas!”\n\nPosted in History on Dec 01, 2014\n\nI know that Christmas is coming because I have had a “visitation”. Nothing particularly existential (or as disturbing as the face of Jacob Marley), more a dream involving my friend Sally! I dreamt of arriving at Sally’s house in Patcham where all was ready for Christmas – the perfect festive scene - the tree was beautifully decorated, at its foot were piles of beautifully wrapped presents and the mantelpiece was covered with cards. My mild surprise on arriving soon turned to panic when I realised that it was Christmas Eve and I had done nothing to prepare for my own family’s Christmas, had not even bought my cards!\n\nFull article\n\nAn Act of Remembrance\n\nPosted in History on Nov 01, 2014\n\nRemembrance Sunday, the second Sunday in November, is the day traditionally put aside to remember all those who have suffered and died in conflict and all those who mourn them. On the 9th November this year, services around the country will be framed to ensure that no-one is forgotten. And in this spirit, we should perhaps spare a thought for the 16 German prisoners of war buried in Bear Road Cemetery, Brighton.\n\nFull article\n\nBack to School: A Short History of School Uniform\n\nPosted in History on Sep 01, 2014\n\nAs the new academic year beckons, most local schools are encouraging a smart, standardised image for their pupils. Until fairly recently relaxed polo shirts and sweatshirts in a specified colour and bearing the school’s logo graced many Brighton & Hove schools, but the past few years have seen a return to a more traditional uniform comprising tailored trousers or skirt, a shirt, tie, V-necked jersey and blazer. Adherents consider that a closely-prescribed, formal school uniform reflects well on the institution and benefits its pupils, helping to raise standards of personal appearance, fostering an esprit de corps among students and even improving conduct.\n\nFull article\n\nBrighton: The Summer of 1914\n\nPosted in History on Aug 01, 2014\n\nThere is something very appealing about looking back exactly one hundred years. It’s just beyond our memory, but was, nevertheless, experienced by people who lived in the houses we now live in, sent their children to the schools we went to, visited the parks, cinemas and theatres we still enjoy. And in the summer of 1914, despite rumours of war, Brighton was a busy seaside resort playing host to holiday-makers, day trippers and those looking for fun, just as it is today. In fact, Brighton was experiencing a bit of a tourist boom, benefitting from the very natural disinclination on the part of many to risk Continental travel.\n\nFull article\n\nThe London to Brighton Bike Ride\n\nPosted in History on Jun 01, 2014\n\nVelocipede (Latin for “fast foot”) is a collective term for any of the various early forms of human-powered land vehicle, like the unicycle, the tricycle and the quadracycle. The most common type of velocipede was, and still is, the bicycle. Something that we are all very familiar with in Brighton, or ‘Cycling Town’ as it is known to some – the place where the Council have multi-million pound plans to create a European centre of excellence for cycling.\n\nFull article\n\nThe Battle of Lewes 750\n\nPosted in History on May 01, 2014\n\nWhilst we may be in the midst of Brighton festival madness our neighbours in Lewes also have some pretty extensive plans in place for May. Not the Festival, the Fringe or even the Great Escape, but the Battle of Lewes 750, designed to commemorate events that took place in May 1264 which, some believe, shaped the future of democracy in this country.\n\nFull article\n\nThe Countess of Huntingdon and her Connexion\n\nPosted in History on Apr 01, 2014\n\nPeople new to Brighton (or just the young), may be surprised to know that there was, until relatively recently, a chapel in North Street; directly opposite the entrance to New Road where Huntingdon Towers, the language school, is today. I was certainly surprised by this discovery, even more so by the fact that it was built by a woman; a woman who felt so passionately that she was prepared to sell her jewellery to pay for it; a woman who took on roles normally attributed to men and went on to form ‘The Countess of Huntingdon’s Connexion’ – her own society of preachers and a popular religious movement.\n\nFull article\n\nBrighton Hippodrome\n\nPosted in History on Mar 01, 2014\n\nAt the time of writing, the future of Brighton Hippodrome remains uncertain. Council Planners have received the required information from Alaska Development Consultants and their application to turn the Hippodrome into an eight-screen cinema is now valid. What happens next is a period of public consultation and interested parties have until the 4th March to make their feelings known. What is not in question is the role this Grade-II* listed building has played over the years in developing Brighton’s reputation as a centre for cultural tourism and, indeed, the place to be on the South Coast. It actually started life in 1897 as an ice-rink. Designed by Lewis Kerslake and situated on the east side of Middle Street, it had a long stuccoed façade with short towers at each end. Its neighbours included residential houses, inns, the Union Charity School, which was founded in 1805 and was the first public elementary school in Brighton, and the fabulously decorated Middle Street Synagogue, built in 1874.\n\nFull article\n\nJourneys - Holocaust Memorial Day\n\nPosted in History on Jan 01, 2014\n\nMonday 27th January is Holocaust Memorial Day and this year the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust have taken as their theme ‘journeys’: how the experience of people who suffered in the Holocaust under Nazi persecution is characterised by forced journeys - journeys often undertaken in terror and ending in death, but also journeys that ended in survival, new lives and new homes.\n\nFull article\n\nFrom Genteel Watering Place to Day Trippers’ Paradise\n\nPosted in History on Oct 01, 2013\n\nClergy denounced the iron horse as an invention of the Devil, breathing out the black smoke of Hades. Medical men had doubts as to the effect of speed on the human constitution, particularly on delicate females. Many thought the railway was just unnecessary – the present carriage service from London was perfectly adequate – and who knew what environmental and economic effects it might have on the area? The well-to-do, in particular, raised objections about the likely impact on their genteel watering place, turning it into a noisy resort for the Cockney hordes. But, however ‘reasoned’ the protest, because of its wealth and fame, Brighton was an inevitable magnet for developers and the arrival of the railway was inescapable.\n\nFull article\n\nThe Friends’ Meeting House\n\nPosted in History on Sep 01, 2013\n\nBack to school, college or university? Or, perhaps this September you are thinking of attending a course at the Friends Centre? Until August 2005, this was located in the Friends Meeting House, Ship Street, where adult education classes have been held continuously since 1876; thanks in no small part to the Quakers – the Religious Society of Friends.\n\nFull article\n\nBrighton on The Level\n\nPosted in History on Jul 01, 2013\n\nAfter much restoration work, The Level is due to open again on the 8th August. As part of the Master Plan, the Parks Project Team have been working with community history website ‘My Brighton and Hove’, oral historians and volunteers to create a record of activities and events associated with The Level, including personal stories of time spent there. What they have uncovered demonstrates the town’s long and varied relationship with one of its most prominent open spaces – a recreational park, an events venue for circuses, fairs, bonfires, prize fights and music festivals and, on its less playful side, for public speeches, political demonstrations and military gatherings.\n\nFull article\n\nBrighton: A Town on Trial The Great Conspiracy Case\n\nPosted in History on Jun 01, 2013\n\nThe 1950s was an interesting decade: a time of change, a move away from the drab austerity of the post-war years into a lighter, brighter world. Prime Minister Harold Macmillan went so far as to say, “most of our people have never had it so good”. In Brighton, the Promettes were on the seafront, housewives could shop in the town’s first supermarket, 200 workers produced BMW Isetta bubble cars in a factory in New England Street, slums were being cleared and plans were in place for the town’s first tower block flats.\n\nFull article\n\nWalking in the Zoo\n\nPosted in History on Apr 01, 2013\n\nIn 1870, music hall artist Alfred Vance had a “hit” singing about walking in the zoo on a Sunday. His song is noteworthy, because it is credited with bringing into popular usage the words “OK” and “zoo”. The abbreviation, zoo, had appeared in print before in around 1847, when it was used for the Clifton Zoo in Bristol, but did not catch on until Vance sang, the okay thing on Sunday is walking in the Zoo. Unsurprisingly, Fellows of the Zoological Society were not OK with the shortened form. Those associated with the very popular and successful London Zoo, in particular, preferred “zoological garden,” which in turn was short for “Gardens and Menagerie of the Zoological Society of London.”\n\nFull article\n\nMedical Failings, Excoriating Reports and Cover-Ups Victorian Style\n\nPosted in History on Mar 01, 2013\n\nMedical scandals are at the forefront of everybody’s mind at the moment, not least because of the catastrophic failings of the Mid-Staffordshire NHS Trust. The national press even went as far as to dub 6th February 2013 the “NHS’s Darkest Day”. Of course, in the history of medicine there have been many low points, although not all of them were the subject of such close scrutiny by the media and the general public.\n\nFull article\n\nBrighton’s Most Famous Ambassador, Sportsman and Philanthropist: Sir Harry Preston\n\nPosted in History on Feb 01, 2013\n\nIn February I usually write something connected to Valentine’s Day: times in our past when the tradition of courtly love, romantic love and even mass-produced, commercial love flourished. However, the focus of this month’s article would not, I fear, be considered a heart throb – a little too short, a little too manicured, with a passion for a little too much cologne! But, and this is a huge but, there is no doubt that he was a man with an enormous heart, “The friend of Princes and the prince of friends” (Brighton and Hove Herald, 15th August 1936).\n\nFull article\n\nAUSTERITY IN BACKYARD BRIGHTON IN THE THIRTIES\n\nPosted in History on Jan 01, 2013\n\nI had heard, in the 80s, about the ‘slum photographs’, as they were known, in the keeping of the Chief Environmental Health Officer of Brighton Borough Council, so I asked him if I could see them. He said I could, if he could find them. Two years passed and I heard nothing so I gave up. I thought that they might have been stolen.\n\nFull article\n\nDon’t try this at home! The hazardous world of the Victorian parlour game\n\nPosted in History on Dec 01, 2012\n\nIf you are looking to switch off the television, computer and game console this Christmas and play some old-fashioned family parlour games you might want to think twice. The words ‘health and safety’ did not trip off the Victorian tongue and certainly not where Christmas was concerned. We recall the candle-bedecked Christmas tree with its inflammable trimmings and the flaming Christmas pudding but less well-known are the fire-themed parlour games.\n\nFull article\n\nThe Changing Face of Commemoration\n\nPosted in History on Nov 01, 2012\n\nAt the eleventh hour on the eleventh day of the eleventh month millions of people observe a two-minute silence to commemorate those who died in the two world wars and all subsequent conflicts. The 11th November this year will be the 94th anniversary of the signing of the Armistice, signalling the end of four years or war – the Great War, 1914-1918.\n\nFull article\n\nThe Witches of Brighton and Sussex\n\nPosted in History on Oct 01, 2012\n\nIt’s Hallowe’en soon and witches will be abroad. There may be covens of witches in Brighton and Hove preparing to celebrate the ancient magic of witchcraft at this very moment. Who knows? Perhaps the people living next door to you are followers of Wiccan. The neighbours of Doreen Valiente, who had a flat at 6 Tyson Place, Grosvenor Street, Brighton, certainly lived next to a witch, indeed, some called her ‘Queen of the Witches’.\n\nFull article\n\nFun in the Water Aquatic Entertainers\n\nPosted in History on Sep 01, 2012\n\nCaught up in the excitement surrounding the Olympics, I went down to the beach to watch the opening ceremony and, while the stream of teams from countries I had never heard of ambled across the Big Screen, I gazed out along the shoreline to the poor old West Pier and the site of the new i360. With construction now scheduled for the autumn 2012 it does seem that this really is going to happen. The West Pier Trust have said that they are delighted and have described the i360 as a “vertical pier” and a “worthy successor to Eugenius Birch’s masterpiece, the West Pier”. Instead of walking out over the sea as the Victorians did, we Elizabethans will rise 150 metres in the air to admire the panoramic views.\n\nFull article\n\nCharlotte, the Forgotten Princess\n\nPosted in History on Aug 01, 2012\n\nThe Prince Regent, later George IV, married his cousin, Princess Caroline of Brunswick in 1795. Princess Charlotte of Wales, born in 1796, was their only child. Her parents separated three months after her birth and Charlotte’s upbringing was that of the child of a broken marriage. She spent a lonely and isolated childhood, kept apart from her mother and with a distant father who was jealous of the nation’s affection for his daughter. ‘My mother was bad’ wrote Charlotte ‘but she would not have become as bad as she was if my father had not been infinitely worse’.\n\nFull article\n\nRoyal Memories: Duke and Duchess of York’s Visit to Brighton\n\nPosted in History on Jul 01, 2012\n\nIn last month’s history notes article reference was made to the visit made by the Duke and Duchess of York to open the east wing of the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Sick Children on 30 May 1928.

For the Paris 1900 Games, for instance, they took place in the River Seine. However, the rules were formalised in 1908, when the London Games staged the first Olympic swimming competition to be held in a pool. This outdoor pool was built on the infield of the athletics track at White City Stadium and the swimmers were all men; women’s events were not introduced until the Stockholm 1912 Games.\n\nFull article\n\nEnthroned in the Hearts of their People\n\nPosted in History on Jun 01, 2012\n\nQueen Elizabeth II has now become the second monarch in British history to celebrate sixty years on the throne.

He studied piano from an early age and at just 19 won an arranging competition staged by The Melody Maker. At 21, he became a staff arranger for the BBC and a year later was named a musical advisor for His Master’s Voice Records. He became conductor of HMV’s house band, known as the New Mayfair Orchestra, and in 1931 wrote his first major hit, “Goodnight Sweetheart”.\n\nFull article\n\nChimney Sweep & Social Activist Harry Cowley (1890- 1971)\n\nPosted in History on Jan 01, 2012\n\nHarry Cowley was born in 1890 and worked in Brighton as a chimney sweep. He was, however, so much more than this. From the 1920s onwards, he was involved in grass-roots social activism, working outside of all political parties for the benefit of local people. With a self-help attitude towards social welfare he organised practical aid for the poor and disadvantaged of the town by mobilising pensioners, moving homeless families into squatted buildings, campaigning for cheap food and running social events and centres.\n\nFull article\n\nA Dickens of a Christmas!\n\nPosted in History on Dec 01, 2011\n\nIn the [happy] days before television celebrities entered our lives novelists were often accorded this status. Amongst their shining number in the 19th century was Charles Dickens, who was a regular visitor to Brighton. Dickens first came here in October 1837 after finishing Pickwick Papers. He liked the town as a seaside resort and a place to write, indeed, he wrote Dombey and Son whilst staying at the old Bedford Hotel, King’s Road. “I feel much better for my short stay here, also the characters one meets at these seaside places.” He particularly liked taking trips on Captain Fred Collins famous pleasure boat. “The sea was rather choppy and his chatter to the trippers was very witty and amusing,” he wrote.\n\nFull article\n\nA Little Piece of Hollywood\n\nPosted in History on Oct 01, 2011\n\nThe future of Saltdean Lido is in the balance once again and a campaign has been set up to try and save this major Brighton landmark. The Save Saltdean Lido Campaign is asking the owners, Brighton and Hove Council, to start proceedings against the current lease-holder who, they claim, has failed to adequately maintain the building, action (or lack of it) which should, in their view, result in the forfeiture of the lease-hold. According to Rebecca Crook, Campaign Chair: ‘This extraordinary Grade II* Listed building is decaying day-by-day.”\n\nFull article\n\nBrighton and Hove Celebrate the Coronation of King Edward VII\n\nPosted in History on Sep 01, 2011\n\nEdward VII (aka Albert Edward Saxe-Coburg-Gotha; 9th November 1841 – 6th May 1910) was a very popular character. During his many years as heir apparent he built a colourful reputation for himself, not least as arbiter of men’s fashion and as a man with a large appetite for wine, women and song – well perhaps not so much song as food! He was, in fact, responsible for introducing the practice of eating roast beef, roast potatoes, horseradish sauce and Yorkshire pudding on Sundays. For that alone I like him, as did the people of Brighton and Hove who felt they had a special bond with this charismatic Royal.\n\nFull article\n\nI like Hove. I like its surroundings and I like its climate - King Edward VII\n\nPosted in History on Sep 01, 2011\n\nThis year marks the 110th anniversary of King Edward VII’s accession to the throne. Unlike his mother, Queen Victoria, Edward was fond of Brighton and Hove. He first came to Brighton as a baby in 1842; while his parents did not return to the town after 1845, Edward remained a regular visitor for the rest of his life. After the sale of the Pavilion in 1850 Brighton lacked a royal residence, but Edward frequently stayed with local friends, such as the Sassoon family. Once he became King in 1901, Brighton once again found itself a favoured resort of the monarch. In his last years, however, more of the King’s time was spent in neighbouring Hove.\n\nFull article\n\nThe Oldest Operating Aquarium in the World\n\nPosted in History on Aug 01, 2011\n\nOn Saturday 10 August 1872 Brighton aquarium formally opened to the public. 139 years later it is still entertaining and informing the masses about an underwater world that remains a mystery to most of us. Today visitors to this showpiece of Victorian splendour can see giant turtles, sharks encircling a tropical reef, an Amazon rainforest with razor-toothed piranhas and deadly poison dart frogs. They can also learn about the intricate balance of the oceans and the ways in which man is endangering some species.\n\nFull article\n\nBlue Plaque Magnus Volk (1851 - 1937)\n\nPosted in History on Aug 01, 2011\n\nMagnus Volk (1851-1937) was a pioneer electrical engineer. He is best known for having built Volk’s Electric Railway, now the world’s oldest working electric railway. He also built the unique, but short lived Brighton and Rottingdean Seashore Electric Railway, together with its unusual Daddy Long Legs vehicle. In 1888, he built an electric car and equipped his own home and some of Brighton’s public buildings with electric light. Born in Western Road, later moved to Preston Road, and lived at 128 Dyke Road from 1914 until his death in 1937.\n\nFull article\n\nI Do Like To Be Beside The Seaside…\n\nPosted in History on Jul 01, 2011\n\nBrighton seafront is to have a new visitor attraction – a giant ferris wheel. Developers are to build a Brighton O on Madeira Drive, opposite The Aquarium. This temporary structure (to be removed by May 2016) will be ready for use this summer and will have the capacity to carry 280 passengers on an 11-minute ride. The Council and local businesses are clearly excited about what has been termed a “high profile visitor attraction” and see it as a new way to bring holidaymakers to the city.\n\nFull article\n\nBlue Plaque Richard Russell (1687 – 1759)\n\nPosted in History on Jul 01, 2011\n\nDr Richard Russell (1687 – 1759), author of A Dissertation on the Use of Sea Water in the Diseases of the Glands, built Russell House on the site now occupied by The Royal Albion Hotel. From 1754 he and his family lived here during the bathing season in order for Russell to be near his patients and to oversee their sea-water treatments. Dr Richard Russell may be said to be the father of Brighton and, indeed, of the seaside and bathing resorts of Britain.\n\nFull article\n\nThe Earliest Royal Visit to the City of Brighton and Hove\n\nPosted in History on Jun 01, 2011\n\nCharles II’s one night in Brighton prior to fleeing to France and the arrival of the Prince Regent are usually thought of as the first occasions the Royal family had any connection with the City. However, the first known visit by a monarch did, in fact, happen much earlier. On 12 September 1302, the man who was arguably England’s greatest medieval king, Edward I, stopped in Patcham. It is possible that he knew of Patcham because his longest serving Archbishop of Canterbury, John Pecham, was born there. (Pecham or Peecham was the spelling used for Patcham at the time).\n\nFull article\n\nThe Gentleman’s Game\n\nPosted in History on Jun 01, 2011\n\nListeners to a recent Radio Four programme were asked what most signified the arrival of summer to them. I replied to my radio, as you do, without hesitation: the almost permanent presence of a large, overflowing and potentially smelly, cricket bag in the hall. Summer means cricket in our house as it does to so many others on a local club, county team and international level and this has been the way, particularly in Sussex, for a very long time. Sussex cricket teams can be traced back to the 17th century, but the county’s involvement in cricket goes back much further than that. In fact, Sussex, alongside Kent, is believed to be the birthplace of the sport; cricket having been invented by children living on the Weald in Saxon or Norman times.\n\nFull article\n\nMemories Preston Manor\n\nPosted in History on May 01, 2011\n\nI loved Upstairs, Downstairs in the 1970s, I really loved the new episodes shown on the BBC last Christmas, but I really, really loved Julian Fellowes’ Downton Abbey. In fact I can’t wait for the second series later this year. These television dramas have given me a taste for Edwardian life; the lives of the servants “downstairs” and their masters “upstairs”; the gradual social and technological changes that took place in all their lives and how the two classes reacted.\n\nFull article\n\nA Dialogue Between the Past and the Present with Mrs Muriel Elms\n\nPosted in History on Mar 01, 2011\n\nSunday 13 February saw the planting of new elms in the centre of Patcham; the place where the old, twin elms had stood for so many years, but the idiom off with the old and on with the new doesn’t apply here. I am sure that I was not the only person to see the new trees in-situ and think of those that had been felled and reflect on all that had been played out in front of them over their long history. Happily though for me, I have had the good fortune to meet a lady willing to talk to me about her first-hand memories of Patcham and Preston Park stretching back to 1913.\n\nFull article\n\nThe Royal Escape Nicholas Tattersall | Brighton History\n\nPosted in History on Feb 01, 2011\n\nBefore 1750 Brighton doesn’t appear very often in the history books, apart from a few incidents which receive mention; the first in 1541 when, as part of his divorce settlement, Henry VIII granted various manors to Anne of Cleves including Preston; then when poor Deryck Carver, a brewer from Black Lion Street, was burned to death in Lewes, making him one of the first Protestant martyrs in Sussex; then, more famous than either of these two events, is the episode that links the town with Charles II’s escape from England - Cromwellian forces hot on his heels.\n\nFull article\n\nThe Popular Figure of the 18th Century Gentleman Smuggler\n\nPosted in History on Jan 01, 2011\n\nLast month all our thoughts were turned to where we were going to purchase the “little extras” we wanted for the festivities. We were on the look out for signs that a bottle of gin was cheaper in Asda than Sainsburys. Now, with Christmas over, we have the additional incentive to buy goods at “sale” prices to help counter the effects of Mr Osborne’s VAT increase.\n\nFull article\n\nBrighton as National Foster Mother\n\nPosted in History on Nov 01, 2010\n\nOn 22 August 1939, Parliament was recalled and the Emergency Powers Defence Act was instigated. This set in motion wartime regulations, including an evacuation procedure, which had been crystallising since 1922. The signal for evacuation was given on the radio on 31 August 1939 and Operation Pied Piper began the next day. Of the 660,000 evacuees streaming out of London over the next three days, approximately 31,000 arrived in Brighton.* 400 buses and a convoy of cars met the evacuees at the railway station and delivered them to six distribution centres throughout the Brighton area.\n\nFull article\n\nNo Ordinary Ghost Story: No Ordinary House\n\nPosted in History on Oct 01, 2010\n\nWe all know about Brighton’s restless dead; the woman in white at Preston Manor, the haunted house in Prestonville Road, the famous grey nun in The Lanes, ghoulish monks, martyrs and drowned sailors. The World Horror Convention went so far as to declare Brighton the UK’s ghost capital. There is, however, one haunting, said to have occurred at Patcham Place, that seems to attract less attention.\n\nFull article\n\nEntertainment for the Masses\n\nPosted in History on Sep 01, 2010\n\nOn the 22nd September the Duke of York’s cinema celebrates its 100th anniversary. This is a real achievement, especially when so many of its contemporaries, with wonderful names like the Bijou Electric Empire (now Burger King), have long since closed their doors. The history of cinema in Brighton goes back further than 1910 though and encompasses not only the rise and fall of glitzy picture palaces and back street ‘flea pits’, but the very birth of the film industry.\n\nFull article\n\nThe Most Notorious Man-Women Story of the Early 20th Century\n\nPosted in History on Aug 01, 2010\n\nI went on an organised walking tour recently of some of Brighton’s more interesting places. Outside The Old Courtroom in Church Street the tour guide regaled us with a fascinating tale that he introduced as similar in theme to the stories surrounding Phoebe Hessel - one of the most well known women of Brighton – who is said to have dressed as a soldier and served in the West Indies in order to be near her lover, Samuel Golding.\n\nFull article\n\nOld Friends\n\nPosted in History on Aug 01, 2010\n\nEveryone will be saddened by the news that the two elms at the centre of Patcham Village - that live so close to each other they form a heart-shaped canopy, have to be felled. They attained monumental stature, 70-80 feet, and it is humbling to reflect upon the dramatic changes they witnessed and were part of in Patcham.\n\nFull article\n\nThe Wagners\n\nPosted in History on Jun 01, 2010\n\nThe Wagners were of German descent and emigrated to England in 1717. They were hatters to the Monarchy and eventually to the British Army, and were thus quite wealthy and influential. The Brighton connection came about when, in 1784, one of the Wagners’ married the daughter of Henry Mitchell, Vicar of Brighton. Henry Mitchell was also a man of influence, having been a tutor to the future Duke of Wellington and a Sussex Yeoman. One of the sons of this marriage was Henry Mitchell Wagner, who apart from inheriting some of the Wagner wealth, became tutor to the sons of the Duke of Wellington and therefore influential in his own right. In 1824, Henry Mitchell Wagner was appointed Vicar of Brighton at St Nicholas Church, a post he held until his death in1870. Also in 1824, his eldest son Arthur Douglas Wagner was born.\n\nFull article\n\nOriental Palace Occupied by King-Emperor’ s Oriental Troops\n\nPosted in History on May 01, 2010\n\nI have tried to think when I last visited the Royal Pavilion. I suppose my first visit was in the 1980s when we came to live in Brighton and then again in the 1990s when our children were small. In those intervening years nothing much had changed. The glittering chandeliers, sumptuous furnishings and exotic decoration were all still there, but nothing new appeared to have been added and I guess that is why I have not ventured back. Now there is a reason, a new permanent exhibition has just opened, charting a fascinating chapter in palace’s history.\n\nFull article\n\nStones at St Peters\n\nPosted in History on Apr 01, 2010\n\nSt Peter’s Church has stood at Preston for more than seven hundred years and holds, in its memorial stones, all manner of stories - of people linked to royalty and also to murder. The oldest graves, from the centuries after the church was built in 1250, no longer survive. One of the earliest memorials is a grey stone plaque in the wall of the bell tower ‘Here lyeth buried the body of Elizabeth the daughter of Sir Richard Shirley, Barronnett who departed this life on 23rd day of April Anno Domini 1684’\n\nFull article\n\nGangland Brighton\n\nPosted in History on Mar 01, 2010\n\nGang warfare, racketeering, welshing and protection – no not the Sopranos, but the more seedy and sordid attractions of gangland Brighton in the inter-war years. A side of Brighton that was brought to us by Graham Greene in his 1938 novel Brighton Rock and later the film of the same name, staring Richard Attenborough as the sadistic teenage gangster, Pinkie Brown.\n\nFull article\n\nThe Passing of St Valentine\n\nPosted in History on Feb 01, 2010\n\nSad as it might sound, I haven’t given much thought to St Valentine for quite a few years now, but when I was in the History Centre this week I did take the opportunity to try and discover how people have regarded Valentine’s Day in the past.\n\nFull article\n\nTHE SEVEN AGES OF BRIGHTON GENERAL\n\nPosted in History on Jan 01, 2010\n\nWhen the newly appointed administrator arrived from his Sheffield teaching hospital to take up his post at Brighton General in 1951, he was shocked at what he found. The wards on J Block, for example, had open fires, wooden floors and no curtains at the windows. They were, he later recalled, “like giant cowsheds filled with people”\n\nFull article\n\nPantomime & Brighton’s Theatrical Heritage\n\nPosted in History on Dec 01, 2009\n\nThe origins of British pantomime probably date back to the Middle Ages and blend the traditions of the Italian “Commedia dell’Arte and the British music hall. Commedia was a type of travelling street entertainment that used dance, music, tumbling, acrobatics and buffoonery in a repertoire of stories passed down through generations of touring troupes. Each plot contained stock characters such as the over protective father, Pantaloon, Columbine his daughter, her love the heroic Harlequin and the servant Pulchinello, (who still exists in this country as the puppet Mr Punch)\n\nFull article\n\nHeartbreak Village\n\nPosted in History on Nov 01, 2009\n\nHeartbreak Village is the title of an article that appeared in The Sussex Country Magazine in January 1946. In it the author, Betty Harvey, gives a firsthand account of what happened to Stanmer Park when the Powers-That-Be requisitioned the village, ‘every stick and stone of it’ and handed it over to the military. Betty lived on the Stanmer estate, her father farmed the 700 acres around the village. When war was declared in 1939, she and her family naively thought that they would carry on much as always. They had no premonition of what fate, the War Office or the Ministry of Agriculture had in store for them or their ‘little piece of old Sussex’.\n\nFull article\n\nThe Lewes Road Cemeteries\n\nPosted in History on Oct 01, 2009\n\nOn the glorious evening of the 10th September the Brighton & Hove Open Door event The Paths of Glory lead to 10 Grade II Listed Buildings on the area of Tenantry Down known as The Lewes Road Cemeteries. The Byzantine oratory, Gothic Revival chapels, mausoleums, Egyptian Pylon and Tabernacle were Romantic and theatrical backdrops but the star of the evening was Nature herself. Golden lambent sunlight filtered through forest-size trees and shone on springy chalk down land turf pawed by badgers. The walkers could only agree with the late Anthony Dale, author of Brighton Cemeteries, that , “ The Extra-Mural Cemetery is one of the most delightful spots in the whole of Brighton.”. And we owe it all to water pollution. In 1850 the disposal of the dead threatened Brighton’s supply of clean water.\n\nFull article\n\nBrighton’s Victorian Railway Heritage\n\nPosted in History on Sep 01, 2009\n\nA new greenway has recently been planted near Brighton Railway Station. It is currently in its maintenance period, before being formally opened to the public later this year. The area has been designated a Site of Nature Conservation Interest (SNCI) and forms part of the approved Masterplan for the Brighton Station Site. It is located to the rear of One Brighton and the Clarenden Centre and the traffic-free path will take in the New England Road Grade II listed bridge. Seating has been placed along the greenway, together with an art installation designed to reflect the site’s Victorian railway heritage (a rocket style steam train I believe).\n\nFull article\n\nDevil’s Dyke: The Largest ‘Dry’ Valley in Britain\n\nPosted in History on Aug 01, 2009\n\nThe Beachdown Festival on Devil’s Dyke is happening again this August Bank Holiday weekend and it looks like it will be quite an event, offering an eclectic line-up of music, film and comedy. Not only do the promoters promise 42 hours of entertainment, they also guarantee the driest underfoot-festival site anywhere in the UK - due to the chalk base of the South Downs any rain that falls will simply seep away.\n\nFull article\n\nWest Pier Story\n\nPosted in History on Jul 01, 2009\n\nBrighton’s West Pier was the finest pier -ever! As a Grade One listed structure it epitomised the exuberance and exoticism of the British seaside combining raffish buildings and superstructures, with the utilitarian engineering of its pilings and struts, girders and bracings. As with many things ‘Brighton’ the pier was at the cutting edge of contemporary style but also engineering innovation and social change.\n\nFull article\n\nThe Hangman and the Corrupt Banker\n\nPosted in History on Jun 01, 2009\n\nFor months now our newspapers have been full of stories about bankers, fraud and corruption, so much so that I must admit to feeling a tad weary of the subject. Until that is I found a story about a corrupt English banker who had forfeited his life for his crimes, and discovered that both he and his hangman had lived in Brighton.\n\nFull article\n\nRoyal Pavilion Gardens\n\nPosted in History on May 01, 2009\n\nAs we all know, Queen Victoria wasn’t a fan of the Royal Pavilion and when her seaside residence on the Isle of Wight was completed she took the opportunity to strip the Pavilion almost bare, leaving it to become the property of the town in 1850. From that time the gardens changed, new paths were laid and seats placed in the shrubbery walks making them the place in the town for promenading.\n\nFull article\n\nThe Battle of Lewes Road\n\nPosted in History on Apr 01, 2009\n\nNot the Battle of Lewes, which took place on 14th May 1264 between the forces of Simon de Montford and King Henry III, but a strike action the Brighton and Hove Herald called the ‘Battle of Lewes Road’. A violent and bloody incident leading from The General Strike called by the Trades Union Congress in defence of mineworkers who were being asked to accept a universal seven-day week and a drop in wages of up to 25%.\n\nFull article\n\nThree Women Called Louisa\n\nPosted in History on Mar 01, 2009\n\nThe first was Louisa Edwards, mother of ten children and wife of James Spicer, paper merchant. She was a committed Congregationalists and believer in religious and moral reforms. Her eldest daughter, Louisa, (1839-1914) became a suffragist and activist for women’s rights and her daughter, Louisa, (1872-1966) in turn became one of the world’s leading experts in obstetrics and gynaecology. Together, they made a big impact on the lives of women, especially those living in Brighton.\n\nFull article\n\nBrighton Love Stories\n\nPosted in History on Feb 01, 2009\n\nA weekend spent clandestinely with a lover. How exciting that sounds – theoretically, of course! But the element of sin and guilt, fundamental to the uniquely English and rather old-fashioned concept of the ‘dirty weekend’, is not quite the same now. Romantic couples no longer have the excitement that signing the hotel register as Mrs and Mrs Smith must have created and those wanting a divorce no longer have to wait in anticipation of being caught in flagrante. However, if you were thinking of a little dalliance you are in the right place. With its raffish, tolerant and non-censorious atmosphere Brighton, apparently, remains the nation’s favourite destination for weekends dedicated to sensual pleasures.\n\nFull article\n\nProsperity and poverty, dereliction and rebuilding, the story of London Road\n\nPosted in History on Jan 01, 2009\n\nA valley running through downland fields. The first development in this area became Brighton’s first suburb, built on the open field known as the North Butts, an area which we can now identify as between London Road, Viaduct Road and Ditchling Road, a triangle ending in the south at what is now St Peter’s church. The first roads to be developed there were Queen’s Place, Marshall’s and Brunswick Rows.\n\nFull article\n\nThe Chattri\n\nPosted in History on Jan 01, 2009\n\nIt was not so much a New Year’s Resolution, more a need to break the invisible hold the kitchen had gained over me in the last couple of weeks, that made me think about visiting the Chattri. I have never been there before and, for someone who professes a keen interest in all things connected to the First World War, I felt that it was time to rectify this. I must say though that, as soon as I had parked the car and started across the fields, I did feel that perhaps I had made a bit of a mistake. But, in truth, the walk was easy, even for a “non-walker/townie” like me, and after about 30 minutes I came to the Chattri, the resting place of 53 Hindu and Sikh soldiers who died in Brighton and were cremated on the Sussex Downs near Patcham during the early part of the First World War.\n\nFull article\n\nWinter Solstice\n\nPosted in History on Dec 01, 2008\n\nAt this time our attention is once again taken up with Christmas preparations; what shall we eat, what to buy that ‘difficult’ man, will the wrapping paper co-ordinate with the chosen colour scheme and, perhaps this year more than ever, will the funds stretch?\n\nFull article\n\nUnknown Warriors\n\nPosted in History on Nov 01, 2008\n\nA few years ago I met a man who planned to write a book about all the war memorials in Sussex. He wanted to record where the county’s war memorials were and attempt to put faces and personalities to the names inscribed on them. A huge task and, as I found out when I tried to look at the Book of Remembrance at St Peter’s Church, not an easy one.\n\nFull article\n\nShine on Harvest Moon\n\nPosted in History on Sep 01, 2008\n\nMany moons ago I was a secretary, working for a man who would not normally be considered a traditionalist, but for reasons beyond my young-self, he liked to refer to the four quarter days of the year. For example, he would say ‘….after Lady’s Day’ or ‘when the Michaelmas term starts…’. At the time I thought he was completely bonkers, but now I have made the connection between quarter days and the time of year, particularly Michaelmas, September and our harvest festival customs and traditions.\n\nFull article\n\nThe Oldest Electric Railway in the World\n\nPosted in History on Aug 01, 2008\n\nI must confess that I am not a great fan of Brighton seafront during the summer months; in fact, I usually go out of my way to avoid it, humbug that I am. However, this August I might be tempted down to the Banjo Groyne to join in some of the celebrations being held to mark the 125th anniversary of Volk’s Electric Railway - the oldest working electric railway in the world according to the Guinness Book of Records.\n\nFull article\n\nWykeham Terrace - Home for “Fallen” Women\n\nPosted in History on Jul 01, 2008\n\nWykeham Terrace cannot escape attention, located as it is just down from St Nicholas’ Church and only seconds away from the city centre. Architecturally, it is one of the most striking terraces in the whole of Brighton, built in Regency Gothic style, possibly by A.H. Wilds or Henry Mew, between 1822 and 1830. Historically, it boasts a past that includes both squatters and a number of well-known residents; Dame Flora Robson and her two sisters lived at No 7 and, apparently, Leo Sayer and Adam Faith have occupied No 1 Wykeham Terrace at different times. Further back in time, the Terrace was simultaneously home to cavalry officers, an order of nuns and ex-prostitutes! This slightly odd arrangement coming about because the northern part of the Terrace served as the officer’s mess for cavalry based at Preston Park and St Mary’s Home for Female Penitents was located in the southern part.\n\nFull article\n\nWhitsun 1964 - Battle of Brighton\n\nPosted in History on May 01, 2008\n\nWhitsun has the feel of one of those long forgotten events, like Lady Day or Michaelmas. As a child growing up in a seaside town, Whitsun was the time when the B&B sign went up in the front window and my sister and I vacated our bedrooms for ‘the visitors’. Later I realised that Whitsun could be a far more exciting time. Being too young to remember newspaper headlines like the Evening Argus’s ‘Battle of Brighton’, this revelation came to me via The Who and Quadrophenia; first the 1973 album and then in 1979 the film which immortalised the clashes between Mods and Rockers on Brighton seafront over the Whitsun Bank Holiday of May 1964.\n\nFull article\n\nBrighton’s Poorest\n\nPosted in History on Apr 01, 2008\n\nPoor relief in Brighton began in the early 1600s with the building of almshouses in Bartholemew’s Square, Market Street, where the Town Hall is today. By 1723, they were too small and a new workhouse was erected on the site. Its inmates included the town’s sick, aged, and impoverished children who, in addition to cooking and making their own clothes, collected and crushed oyster shells for use as fertiliser. Later, when the poorhouse Commissioners became responsible for maintaining highways, workhouse inmates were used as town scavengers removing animal dung and rubbish from the streets.\n\nFull article\n\nThe Changing Face of Brighton’s Beer Houses and Gin Palaces\n\nPosted in History on Mar 01, 2008\n\nI have been thinking about pubs a lot recently, where to go for lunch on Mothering Sunday, possible venues for my “big” birthday party, places to meet friends. It seems to me that pubs and pub culture have changed a lot recently and I no longer have the comfort and certainty of old favourites to go to.\n\nFull article\n\nProposal of Marriage\n\nPosted in History on Feb 01, 2008\n\nLeap Year is the traditional time for women to propose marriage. It is believed that this tradition started in 5th century Ireland when St. Bridget complained to St. Patrick about women having to wait a long time for men to propose. According to legend, St. Patrick said the yearning females could propose on this one day, the 29th February.\n\nFull article\n\nMURDER MOST FOUL\n\nPosted in History on Jan 01, 2008\n\nIf your New Year’s resolution was to get out more and do different things then I may have just the thing for you. The Old Police Cells Museum in Brighton’s Town Hall. This is a fascinating place, originally dedicated to charting the history of policing in the city from the first days of the force in 1812 until 1967 when the local force merged with the Sussex Police. It has now been expanded to cover policing in Sussex up to the present day. The museum is staffed by volunteer workers all with a great deal of knowledge and all with a tale to tell.\n\nFull article\n\nChristmas Past - describes A Regency Christmas\n\nPosted in History on Dec 01, 2007\n\nChristmas in the late Georgian and Regency period was very different from festivities today. 200 years ago the ‘Season’ began on 24th December and ran until 12th Night on 6th January. It would be unseemly to begin celebrations before the end of the sombre pre-Christmas period of Advent. Christmas in the Eighteenth century was a restrained affair – a time for elegant entertaining and extending hospitality to family, friends and neighbours. Children today might be dismayed to learn that pre-Victorian Christmas was considered an adult occasion.\n\nFull article\n\nWe Shall Remember Them\n\nPosted in History on Nov 01, 2007\n\nWith a nephew in the British army my thoughts are never far from the fighting taking place in Iraq and Afghanistan at the moment, but the approach of 11th November will inevitably turn my thoughts outward to all those who have faced conflict, particularly during the Second World War.\n\nFull article\n\nVictorian Rubbish\n\nPosted in History on Oct 01, 2007\n\nPlanning Permission is being sought for a massive waste transfer and recycling depot.

All services are now delivered at the new children’s hospital, a ten-storey, custom designed building, in the grounds of the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Eastern Road. It is one of only seven dedicated paediatric hospitals in the UK and with more than three times the floor space of the former site; the new hospital provides massively improved accommodation for patients and their families.\n\nFull article\n\nThe Coach House, Clifton Hill, Brighton\n\nPosted in History on Aug 01, 2007\n\nIn recent weeks, I have seen articles in both local and national papers about possible plans to build next to the Coach House in Clifton Hill and I must say I have been shocked. Not so much by the idea of developers presuming to build near a historic site, but by what a wonderful site it is. Once the location of a windmill, an inspiration to Constable who, from 1824, painted it on four separate occasions.\n\nFull article\n\nAmon Wilds\n\nPosted in History on Jul 01, 2007\n\nThe petition to improve the Seven Dials roundabout is gathering steam.

Two hundred years on this event was marked by a range of different celebrations, which tried to address what, for many, is almost impossible to take in - the sheer scale of the transactions of slavery, men, women and children as cargo, people whose names, heritage and culture were stripped from them.\n\nFull article\n\nPRESTON MANOR\n\nPosted in History on Mar 01, 2007\n\nWhat is the attraction of Preston Manor? As a resident of Preston, I pass the house almost daily, but I really do not know what I feel about it. On sunny days and especially when the front lawn is covered with daffodils, I think it looks charming and I remind myself that I must visit its rooms again soon; but on grey days it almost disappears into the background, its architectural and family history lost from view.
