        "text": "Tuesday, June 13, 2023\n\nWhen it comes to blue plaques, or any kind of metallic heritage-based commemoration, London wins hands down.\n\nBy dint of being the capital city for a millennium, not to mention the largest city in the country by a considerable margin, anyone who's anyone has lived here, worked here or at least dropped by to do something important at some point in their life.\n\nOther towns and cities sometimes struggle in comparison, their plaques often making do with the fact that Queen Victoria visited, Charles Dickens once stayed, some famous person was born here but left to seek their fortune, or resorting instead to local dignitaries like the merchant who became an MP, the mayor who rebuilt the bank or the woman who wrote a nice poem.\n\nMelton Mowbray, for example, peaks here.\n\nEnglish Heritage run the longstanding blue plaque scheme in the capital, whereas outside London commemoration is mostly up to councils, civic societies and other organisations. But the number of blue plaques in the capital still hasn't quite reached a total of 1000, despite the fact they could appear on tens of thousands of frontages if the acceptance criteria were slightly more lax.\n\nSo I wondered which London building would have the most blue plaques if they were dished out willy-nilly to everyone who passed a basic importance threshold. What should be London's blue plaquiest building?\n\n19 houses currently have two blue plaques commemorating different people. Some are unsurprising couplings, given the context, such as 20 Maresfield Gardens (Sigmund Freud and Anna Freud) and 29 Fitzroy Square (George Bernard Shaw and Virginia Woolf). Others are more coincidental, such as 4 Carlton Gardens (Lord Palmerston and Charles de Gaulle), 58 Grafton Way (Francisco de Miranda and Andres Bello) and most recently 48 Paultons Square (Samuel Beckett and Patrick Blackett). No building has three blue plaques.\n\nBut we can do better than that. The Tesco Express on Southgate Road in Hackney was once the site of the 5th Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party which was attended by Joseph Stalin, Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky. That's three. George Lansbury, leader of the Labour Party, once lived on Bow Road and would have been visited there by his granddaughter Angela Lansbury, his grandson Oliver Postgate and the suffragette Sylvia Pankhurst. That's four. And the Spice Girls filmed their video for Wannabe at the Midland Grand Hotel, St Pancras, and OK officially you have to be dead to get a blue plaque but let's call that five.\n\nYes, I'm toying with you. Other London properties, due to their long-term importance, have been home to dozens of people you'll find in the history books, maybe even hundreds. Think of all the people who've lived, stayed or been incarcerated in the Tower of London, for example, not to mention those who lost their heads there. The gatehouse could easily sport blue plaques for William the Conqueror, Edward I and Henry VIII, and less happily Edward V, Anne Boleyn and the Kray Brothers. In the City the Mansion House could be emblazoned with plaques for oodles of Mayors of London, even if you restricted it to the important ones. And just think of all the famous people who've stepped into Broadcasting House over the years, not just much-loved presenters but all the VIPs who've sat down for an interview. Plaque overload would be possible at all of these.\n\nThere is a strong case that the London house with the most famous succession of occupants is 10 Downing Street. Ever since Robert Walpole knocked it about it's been the place where decisions of enormous consequence have taken place and, especially since the start of the 20th century, home to the Prime Minister of the day as well. When it comes to plaques saying \"X lived here\" as opposed to just worked or passed through, 10 Downing Street might be the most formidable contender of all. A fair few plaques could go up outside number 11 too, should you want to imagine the plague of plaques this might engender.\n\nOr perhaps it's Buckingham Palace, which since 1837 has been the principal London residence of the monarch. We've only had seven monarchs since then, so not an enormous total, but once you start adding in the other famous members of the family that total swiftly swells. Thousands more have visited, including multiple world leaders, and if you throw in all the knighthoods bestowed you could easily cover a whole wall with plaques.\n\nBut I'm going to assert that London's blue plaquiest building, potentially at least, is Westminster Abbey.\n\nEvery monarch since 1066 has been crowned here (bar the also-rans of Edward V, Lady Jane Grey and Edward VIII). Every member of the Royal family over the last nine centuries will have been here at some point, there always being some ceremony, wedding or funeral to draw them in. Then there's all the politicians who've been inside, including all the greats (and loads of the not-so-greats too), plus civic leaders, religious figureheads, military bigwigs, showbiz personalities and international guests. Just the congregation from the recent coronation of King Charles could fill a wall... not that I'm recommending plaquing over Hawksmoor's frontage with cumulative congregations over the years, but the West steps of the Abbey may have the densest concentration of famous footsteps anywhere in London, perhaps even anywhere in the world.\n\nAnd you may say \"Ant and Dec sat here\" is no reason for a blue plaque, but in some parts of the provinces \"Ant and Dec sat here\" is about as exciting as it gets.\n\nposted 07:00 :\n\n<< click for Newer posts\n\nclick for Older Posts >>\n\nclick to return to the main page\n\nLife viewed from London E3\n\n» email me\n\n» follow me on twitter\n\n» follow the blog on Twitter\n\n» follow the blog on RSS\n\n» my flickr photostream\n\ntwenty blogs\n\nour bow\n\narseblog\n\nian visits\n\nlondonist\n\nbroken tv\n\nblue witch\n\non london\n\nthe great wen\n\nedith's streets\n\nspitalfields life\n\nlinkmachinego\n\nround the island\n\nwanstead meteo\n\nchristopher fowler\n\nthe greenwich wire\n\nbus and train user\n\nruth's coastal walk\n\nround the rails we go\n\nlondon reconnections\n\nfrom the murky depths\n\nquick reference features\n\nThings to do in Outer London\n\nThings to do outside London\n\nLondon's waymarked walks\n\nInner London toilet map\n\n20 years of blog series\n\nThe DG Tour of Britain\n\nLondon's most...\n\nread the archive\n\nAug24 Jul24 Jun24 May24\n\nApr24 Mar24 Feb24 Jan24\n\nDec23 Nov23 Oct23 Sep23\n\nAug23 Jul23 Jun23 May23\n\nApr23 Mar23 Feb23 Jan23\n\nDec22 Nov22 Oct22 Sep22\n\nAug22 Jul22 Jun22 May22\n\nApr22 Mar22 Feb22 Jan22\n\nDec21 Nov21 Oct21 Sep21\n\nAug21 Jul21 Jun21 May21\n\nApr21 Mar21 Feb21 Jan21\n\nDec20 Nov20 Oct20 Sep20\n\nAug20 Jul20 Jun20 May20\n\nApr20 Mar20 Feb20 Jan20\n\nDec19 Nov19 Oct19 Sep19\n\nAug19 Jul19 Jun19 May19\n\nApr19 Mar19 Feb19 Jan19\n\nDec18 Nov18 Oct18 Sep18\n\nAug18 Jul18 Jun18 May18\n\nApr18 Mar18 Feb18 Jan18\n\nDec17 Nov17 Oct17 Sep17\n\nAug17 Jul17 Jun17 May17\n\nApr17 Mar17 Feb17 Jan17\n\nDec16 Nov16 Oct16 Sep16\n\nAug16 Jul16 Jun16 May16\n\nApr16 Mar16 Feb16 Jan16\n\nDec15 Nov15 Oct15 Sep15\n\nAug15 Jul15 Jun15 May15\n\nApr15 Mar15 Feb15 Jan15\n\nDec14 Nov14 Oct14 Sep14\n\nAug14 Jul14 Jun14 May14\n\nApr14 Mar14 Feb14 Jan14\n\nDec13 Nov13 Oct13 Sep13\n\nAug13 Jul13 Jun13 May13\n\nApr13 Mar13 Feb13 Jan13\n\nDec12 Nov12 Oct12 Sep12\n\nAug12 Jul12 Jun12 May12\n\nApr12 Mar12 Feb12 Jan12\n\nDec11 Nov11 Oct11 Sep11\n\nAug11 Jul11 Jun11 May11\n\nApr11 Mar11 Feb11 Jan11\n\nDec10 Nov10 Oct10 Sep10\n\nAug10 Jul10 Jun10 May10\n\nApr10 Mar10 Feb10 Jan10\n\nDec09 Nov09 Oct09 Sep09\n\nAug09 Jul09 Jun09 May09\n\nApr09 Mar09 Feb09 Jan09\n\nDec08 Nov08 Oct08 Sep08\n\nAug08 Jul08 Jun08 May08\n\nApr08 Mar08 Feb08 Jan08\n\nDec07 Nov07 Oct07 Sep07\n\nAug07 Jul07 Jun07 May07\n\nApr07 Mar07 Feb07 Jan07\n\nDec06 Nov06 Oct06 Sep06\n\nAug06 Jul06 Jun06 May06\n\nApr06 Mar06 Feb06 Jan06\n\nDec05 Nov05 Oct05 Sep05\n\nAug05 Jul05 Jun05 May05\n\nApr05 Mar05 Feb05 Jan05\n\nDec04 Nov04 Oct04 Sep04\n\nAug04 Jul04 Jun04 May04\n\nApr04 Mar04 Feb04 Jan04\n\nDec03 Nov03 Oct03 Sep03\n\nAug03 Jul03 Jun03 May03\n\nApr03 Mar03 Feb03 Jan03\n\nDec02 Nov02 Oct02 Sep02\n\nback to main page\n\nthe diamond geezer index\n\n2023 2022\n\n2021 2020 2019 2018 2017\n\n2016 2015 2014 2013 2012\n\n2011 2010 2009 2008 2007\n\n2006 2005 2004 2003 2002\n\nmy special London features\n\na-z of london museums\n\nE3 -
