The scheme includes a small number of plaques that were erected privately and subsequently absorbed.\n\nThe scheme began in 1866.[1] It was originally administered by the Royal Society of Arts until 1901 when it was taken over the London County Council. The LCC ran the scheme until its abolition in 1965 when its successor body the Greater London Council (GLC) took charge. With the abolition of the GLC in 1986, the blue plaque scheme has been administered by English Heritage."
