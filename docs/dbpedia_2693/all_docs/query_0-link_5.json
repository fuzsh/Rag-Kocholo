        "text": "THE ‘TELEVISOR’ REVEALED\n\nOn 26 January 1926 Baird repeated his experiment, this time making a formal demonstration of his ‘televisor’ in front of 40 members of the Royal Institution. A Times journalist reported that the image was:\n\nfaint and often blurred, but substantiated a claim that through the ‘Televisor’ … it is possible to transmit and reproduce instantly the details of movement, and such things as the play of expression on the face.\n\nIn early 1927 the world’s first television sets were offered for sale in Selfridge’s and in 1928 Baird sent a television picture across the Atlantic and also demonstrated colour television for the first time. The BBC inaugurated the country’s first 30-line television service in August 1932 using Baird’s mechanical system, but it was replaced in 1937 by a rival electronic system developed by the Marconi–EMI corporation."
