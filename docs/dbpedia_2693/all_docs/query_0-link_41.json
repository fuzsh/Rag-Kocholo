        "text": "Roland and Caroline where part-owners of White Lodge, which was next door to Graiseley House. They moved to London, where Roland was a schoolmaster, but at the age of 38 he became secretary of the South Australia Commission, an association which helped with the colonisation of the country. He became interested in postal reform and produced a pamphlet on the subject. He proposed that letters should be charged by weight, not distance and that the sender should pay the postage. The scheme went before Parliament in 1837 and an Act of Parliament gave the Royal Assent in 1839. From January 10th, 1840, a letter not exceeding half an ounce could be sent to any part of the country for one penny. Roland was given a two year post in the Treasury to help with the introduction of the new postal service. The famous Penny Black stamp soon had to be changed to the Penny Red because of forgeries. Roland lost his job in 1842 after the change of Government and joined the London and Brighton Railway Company.\n\nAfter the next change of Government he was given the job of Secretary to the Post Master General in 1854. At the age of 59 he was offered the post of secretary to the Post Office, a position he held until his retirement in 1864. During this time he introduced money orders, travelling post offices, the Post Office Savings Bank and improved rural services. On his retirement he was awarded his full salary as a pension for life and given a special parliamentary grant of Â£20,000. He was knighted in 1860 and was granted the freedom of London in 1879. A few months later he died at the age of 84 and was buried in Westminster Abbey. Roland and Caroline had one son and three daughters."
