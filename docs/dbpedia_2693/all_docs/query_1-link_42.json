        "text": "Data reveals dog breeds are inspiring road names across the UK\n\nLarger dogs are more popular than smaller breeds and the Great Dane is the most popular breed\n\nLondon, Liverpool and Leeds are home to the most dog inspired street names\n\nHaving a dog themed street name could increase property value by up to Â£32K\n\nFrom inventors and entertainers to historic and religious buildings, English cities have it all, but certain places appear to hold more heritage than others.\n\nNew research by the UKâs largest delivery service, Evri, has analysed the amount of heritage plaques in each city across the UK, and unsurprisingly London has come out on top.\n\nThe original blue plaque scheme started in the capital by English Heritage, placed plaques honouring the likes of actor, Charlie Chaplain, novelist, Charles Dickens and prime minister, Sir Winston Churchill.\n\nHeritage plaques are dotted across the country, highlighting historical landmarks, yet, many people donât know they may be living near a piece of history.\n\nLiverpool, Norwich and Leeds also score high for heritage taking the next top spots, with 735 plaques combined.\n\nIn Liverpool you can find plaques for Titanic captain, Edward John Smith and the iconic English band, The Beatles. Whilst in Norwich, English prison reformer, Elizabeth Fry and author, Amelia Opie have been honoured.\n\nThe research also revealed that the south of England has the most heritage, with 2035 plaques in total, followed by the north with 1337 and then the midlands with 577 plaques honouring historical sites and people.\n\nEach city has their own official plaque scheme made from a variety of green, blue, stone and brown colours, and can generally be found mounted to walls and historic buildings.\n\nSome cities have specific heritage, with Cambridge known for its academia and home to various ground-breaking research, such as the discovery of DNA, and intellectuals, such as Charles Darwin.\n\nWhilst York is known for its Viking and Romans heritage, with large numbers of plaques pinpointing historical archaeological sites, such as Stonegate, and the Roman Walls."
