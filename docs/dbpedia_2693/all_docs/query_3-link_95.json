        "text": "A resounding thump breaks the silence as Jaulia Land drops a lump of grey-brown clay onto the slab roller before Ned Heywood cranks it through the machine once, twice, three times, creating a rectangle about an inch thick.\n\nLaying a pattern on top of the slab, Heywood slices through the clay to create a disc the size of an extra-large pizza that will become one of the blue plaques that dot the walls of buildings throughout London, marking the places where scientists, artists, politicians and activists have made history.\n\nAs English Heritage unveiled its 1,000th blue plaque on Tuesday, the charity was working to broaden the program to include more women, people from minority ethnic backgrounds and community groups so that it better reflects the diversity of the capital.\n\nThe latest installation marks the offices where the Women's Freedom League \"campaigned for women's equality\" in the early 20th century, satisfying at least two of those goals.\n\n\"The names are no longer just English names, which is significant because, you know, the people who've come to this country from all over the world have made a disproportionately large contribution,\" Heywood said at his workshop, a converted 18th century pub in the Welsh town of Chepstow, 180 kilometers (110 miles) west of London. \"It's changing now, which is very much for the good.\"\n\nThe blue plaque program, which began in 1866 and is believed to be the first of its kind, provides an informal historical walking tour of London that commemorates notable people and their accomplishments by highlighting the places where they lived and worked.\n\nThe honorees include famous figures from wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill to communist pioneer Karl Marx, as well as lesser-known figures such as theatrical wigmaker Willy Clarkson and civil engineer William Lindley, who built water and sewage systems around the world. There are also plaques honoring foreigners including India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, and American rock star Jimi Hendrix, who lived in London only briefly.\n\nBut English Heritage, which has sponsored the program since 1986, is concerned that past honorees were overwhelmingly white and male. Just 15% of the plaques honor women and less than 5% celebrate people from Black and Asian backgrounds.\n\nThe charity, which manages some 400 monuments, medieval castles, Roman forts and country houses around England, is trying to encourage more nominations of women and people from minority ethnic groups while retaining high standards for entry into the exclusive club, said Anna Eavis, the curatorial director.\n\nPlaques unveiled recently include Princess Sophia Duleep Singh, a suffragette and critic of British rule in India; Ottobah Cugoano, a native of present-day Ghana who was enslaved in Grenada and campaigned against slavery after gaining his freedom; and Ada Salter, the first woman to be elected mayor of a London borough.\n\n\"London is hugely diverse and it has always been, hasn't it?\" Eavis said. \"And so it is important to ensure that we're reflecting that diversity, that richness of contribution on London streets.\"\n\nDiana Yeh, a senior lecturer in sociology at City University of London, said broadening the reach of programs like the blue plaques is \"an essential part of remembering invisible histories.\" But heritage organizations must do more to discuss the \"troubling aspects\" of English history, including slavery and colonialism, she added.\n\n\"In a way it's very easy to celebrate well-known figures who are marginalized, but it's much harder to do that difficult work of acknowledging Britain's difficult past,\" said Yeh, whose work focuses on race, racism and cultural politics. \"But this needs to be done for the benefit of future generations.\"\n\nEnglish Heritage installs a dozen blue plaques each year, selected from about 100 nominations. A committee reviews the nominees to decide which ones warrant commemoration and to ensure there is a real connection between each honoree and the site where the plaque is to be installed.\n\nOnce a decision is made, the order goes out to Heywood's studio, which has been making plaques for English Heritage since 2016.\n\nOver a period of six weeks, Heywood and Land roll and cut the clay, inscribe the disc with the honoree's name and accomplishments, then apply the characteristic blue glaze and fire it in a kiln. It's a process that creates an almost indestructible monument that should last as long as the building to which it's attached — as long as the plaques don't crack when they're baked at 1,300° C (2,370° F).\n\n\"We pray to gods of the kiln,\" Heywood said.\n\nWhile the first plaque, honoring the poet Lord Byron, was destroyed when the building it adorned was demolished, the second, installed in 1867, still marks the house where Napoleon III, the last French emperor, lived in exile.\n\nPlaque number 1,000 honors the Women's Freedom League, a suffragist organization that used 1 Robert Street in central London as its base of operations during its most active period.\n\nThe group, which had the motto \"Dare to be free,\" aimed for total emancipation for women. It advocated nonpayment of taxes and backed a boycott of the 1911 census as ways to pressure the government to allow women to vote.\n\nHeywood and Land feel the responsibility of the blue plaques intensely.\n\nHeywood has a soft spot for scientists, who he says are the real heroes in improving people's lives. Politicians? Not so much. They come and go.\n\n\"Blue plaques are carefully considered, the people are thoroughly researched, and the plaques are there for a reason,\" he added. \"And will be there forever.\""
