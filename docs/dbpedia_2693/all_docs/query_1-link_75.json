        "text": "Teresa Deevy\n\nTeresa Deevy was born in Waterford in 1894, the youngest child of business man Edward Deevy and his wife Mary. Â Having attended the Ursuline Convent in the City, Teresa went on to study at University College Dublin. Â However, her studies in Dublin were curtailed as she developed the hereditary MÃ©niÃ©res disease which eventually rendered her totally deaf. Â She had transferred to University College Cork as the deafness progressed but eventually moved to London in 1914 to learn lip reading. It was in London that she developed her interest in drama. Â Although she was totally deaf by now, she would read play scripts before attending the performance and lip read the actors as they performed. Â When she returned to Waterford in 1919 she was already writing plays and contributing articles and stories to local and national press. In the mid-1920s she began submitting her work to the Abbey Theatre where eventually in 1930 they staged her three-act play, âReapersâ. Â This was followed in 1931 by a one-act play, âA Discipleâ and in1932 her award winning play, âTemporal Powersâ was produced. Â âThe King of Spain's Daughterâ followed in 1935, âKatie Rocheâ and âThe Wild Gooseâ came in 1936. Â Her play âWife to James Whelanâ was rejected by the Abbey in 1937. Â It was an amazing achievement for a woman at that time in Ireland, let alone a profoundly deaf woman, to break through the glass ceiling and become an established nationally recognised playwright. In the late thirties she became interested in writing for the radio and for the next twenty years many of her plays were broadcast on Radio Eireann and BBC Northern Ireland. Â In 1939 two of her plays were shown on the new BBC Television service. Â She died in 1963 at the age of 68.\n\nAfter her death in 1963 her plays were neglected by theatre managers and it seemed that the theatre world had forgotten her, but, in April 1994, the Abbey Theatre revived her play, Katie Roche to critical acclaim and this has led to a slow but steady renaissance. Â Her canon of plays is now becoming the subject of literary conferences and University theses and in very recent times some of her works have been revived and performed in New York and London. Â It has also come to the attention of the Deevy family that an increasing number of Irish amateur companies are also applying for the rights to perform her plays.\n\nFredrick Douglass\n\nFredrick Douglass (1818-1895) is renowned as a nineteenth century equality and anti-slavery campaigner. During his tour of Ireland, Douglass spoke in the Large Room, City Hall, on the evening of Thursday 9th October 1845.\n\nOn Monday 7th October 2013 the Mayor of Waterford unveiled a Blue Plaque on the faÃ§ade of Waterford City Hall to commemorate the visit to Waterford City of Frederick Douglass in October 1845.\n\nFrederick Douglass (1818-1895), was a former slave, abolitionist and human rights activist.Â He visited Ireland and Britain for an extended lecture tour during 1845-47.Â During his time in Ireland, he met and befriended Daniel OâConnell (himself a convinced abolitionist), who was to prove to be a great inspiration in his later career.\n\nDuring his tour of Ireland, Douglass spoke in the Large Room, City hall, on the evening of Thursday the 9th of October 1845.Â It appears that he arrived in Waterford from Wexford on the 8th of October, and left for Cork that day after his speech.Â Unfortunately, the details of his speech in Waterford and its reception are scant.Â However, a local newspaper recorded that the attendance at the meeting was âboth numerous and respectableâ¦â and that âthe cause he so ably advocates deserves the support of every friend to humanityâ¦â\n\nIn later years, Douglass credited his visit to Ireland, and especially his contacts with OâConnell, with broadening his political position from campaigning for the end of slavery to campaigning for freedom for all, equality and an end to poverty â ââ¦the greatest enemyâ¦â.Â This link between OâConnell and Douglass was explicitly referred to by President Obama in his speech in College Green, Dublin on the 23rd of May 2011 â ââ¦Frederick Douglass, and escaped slave, and our great abolitionist, forged an unlikely friendship right here in Dublin, with your great liberator, Daniel OâConnell.Â His time here [in Ireland], Frederick Douglass said, defined him not as a colour, but as a man, and it strengthened the non-violent campaign he would return home to wage.\n\nAfter returning to the US, Douglass subsequently had a long and distinguished career as a writer, speaker, civil rights campaigner, presidential adviser, and diplomat.Â He died in Washington DC on the 20th of February 1895, and is buried in Mount Hope Cemetery, Rochester, New York; the city which had been his home for twenty-five years.\n\nDouglass is a very highly regarded and respected figure in the United States, frequently appearing on lists of greatest Americans.Â\n\nA bust of him is to be erected within the US Capitol building.âA Book on the Black OâConnellâ was published in 2014, and it gives an account of his time in Ireland.\n\nPaddy Coad\n\nBlue Plaque erected on 27th September 2014 to honour Paddy Coad, Waterford footballer. Waterford Civic Trust, the FAI and Shamrock Rovers unveiled a blue plaque to honour the great footballer, Paddy Coad, on Saturday, 27th September. Paddy Coad (1920-1992) is remembered as an extraordinarily gifted footballer who played for Waterford, Glenavon, Shamrock Rovers and Ireland. Matt Busby said of him âWish I could have seen him as a boy, what abilityâ in 1957 when Paddy was 37.\n\nPaddy Coad: - The Greatest League of Ireland player of the 20th Century\n\nâTerms of Reference: This report will investigate why Paddy Coad is claimed to be the greatest League of Ireland player of the 20th Century. His playing career spanned the period 1937 to 1962 with Waterford United and Shamrock Rovers and also included 11 International Caps.\n\nMethod of Procedure: The researcher will use primary and secondary research. Primary research will include meetings with players who played with and against Coad during his career. Secondary research will include official websites such as www.fai.ie, www.shamrockrovers.ie and relative newspaper archives from the local press. It should also be noted that Paddy Coad is the uncle of this researcher and I accept possible bias in this report.\n\nFindings: Paddy Coad was born in 1920 and was sent to De La Salle School, Stephen Street. His first sporting distinction was Table Tennis where he became champion of Munster in the early 1930s. Â His main sporting love however was soccer and he joined the local junior club Corinthians, based primarily on the Lower Yellow Road area. His exceptional talent was quickly realised by the local League of Ireland team and he played his first game for the 'Blues' in 1937. He moved to the Northern Ireland club Glenavon in the following year but he was there only a short while when WWII broke out and Paddy returned to Waterford to continue his career with the local club. (www.shamrockrovers.ie)\n\nAfter a couple of seasons with the Blues Coad signed for the famous Dublin club Shamrock Rovers in 1942 and it was with Rovers that he transformed play in the League with his tremendous skills; his passing of the ball and his overall leadership showed other clubs the way football should be played and he was responsible, almost single-handedly, for a general rise in standards. ( www.fai.ie)\n\nEvery team tried to match Rovers in the new way forward. Â At the time nobody could have envisaged the impact that Coad was to have on the Milltown club, he was to win every honour in the game including eleven international caps and he was to captain the Hoops to unprecedented success in the next decade. The Rovers team of this area became known as âCoads Coltsâ due to number of young players and by the time Rovers won the League title in 1953/54 he had put together what many old supporters believe now to be the best Hoops team ever. ( www.shamrockrovers.ie)\n\nAfter he was made their coach, in 1949, Rovers became the dominant force in Irish football. Coad was the master-general and it was said of him that he did everything at the club but drive the bus. As a midfield general he was known, primarily, as a maker of goals but he did score 126 League of Ireland goals and 41 FAI Cup goals in his career. Â As player-manager Shamrock Rovers won the League title on 3 occasions (1954, 1957 and 1959); Â and were also Â FAI Cup Winners on 4 occasions (in 1944, 1945, 1948 and 1956). He was selected eleven times for Ireland between 1946 and 1952 scoring 3 goals. He also played in twenty-four representative games (a record) for the League of Ireland, the last in 1955. These Inter-league representative matches were usually played on St. Patricks Day in Dalymount Park, where crowds in excess of 25000 gathered to see their heroes.\n\nShamrock Rovers entered the European Cup in 1957(the first time an Irish team had done so) and it was in this competition that Coad reserved one of his greatest performances for Rovers. That night Â he dominated the European cup tie against the famous Busby Babes of Â Manchester United at Old Trafford. His display that night had to be seen to be believed and it was described as the greatest by an Irish player in England up to that time. And remember - he was 37 years old. Â Sir Matt Busby said after the game â What a performance, I just wish I could have seen him as a young boyâ. (www.shamrockrovers.ie and Waterford Soccer Monthly)Comments about Coad John Giles:âMy schoolboy hero, the player we all wanted to be.Alfie Hale: âA true Football legendâLiam Touhy: âLoved the man, A geniusâ\n\nPlayers such as Roy Keane, Kevin Doyle and Noel Hunt have gone on to make careers in England but none had the longevity of Coad in the League of Ireland. Respected figures in the game such as former internationals Peter Fitzgerald, Alfie Hale and John Giles have been involved in League of Ireland Football since the 1940âs and all are of the opinion that no player has come close to the ability that Paddy Coad showed during the height of his career.\n\nWaterford-born Coad won eleven international caps, scored three goals and found fame in the domestic game. He was a gifted striker of the ball as his record of 126 League of Ireland goals and 41 FAI Cup goals proved. Â His tally of 126 League goals ensures to this day his appearance in the top 10 goal scorers in League of Ireland history while his 41 FAI Cup goals makes him still the record goalscorer in the competitions history. (Source www.fai.ie)\n\nâ\n\nCoad also had the distinction of scoring Ireland's winner in the 3-2 victory over Norway at the Ullevaal Stadium on May 30 1951. What was unique about this occasion was that it was the first time that a substitute had scored for Ireland in an International match. Â (www.fai.ie)\n\nâ\n\nâConclusion: This report found that Paddy Coad is widely accepted as being the greatest player to play in the League of Ireland, choosing not to grace his magnificent skills at the highest level with those who crossed the Irish Sea to further their careers at English clubs but to stay at home and leave his legacy as the greatest League of Ireland player of the 20th Century. Â is today regarded, not only as the greatest Shamrock Rovers player of all time, but as the greatest League of Ireland player of the 20th century. Â There are many, in Dublin as well as in Waterford, who will say that there never was anyone as good as Coad. Â He was a true legend.

Many of the women were widowed and this was their only source of income.â\n\nCoordinator of Waterford Womenâs Centre, Breda Murphy is a descendent of two cockle women â her aunt Molly and grandmother Ellie.â\n\nAs members of the Womenâs History Project and through her involvement in a storytelling project in Passage East and Cheekpoint, Breda has a great interest in social history and stories passed down through generations.â\n\nâDuring the story telling nights there were a number of stories told about the cockle women. I recalled the stories my aunt Molly had told me about her mother Ellie.ââ\n\nMolly spoke of the hardship her mother endured and often felt sad about what she had to go through. Ellieâs husband died under the age of 40 leaving her with four very young children.â\n\nâShe was already a cockle picker as a single woman. In the 1911 census she had her occupation down as cockle picker. She had a three-month-old baby â Molly â at that stage, which was remarkable at that time because it wasnât traditional particularly for a married woman to put down her occupation,â Breda said.â\n\nBreda felt the cockle women were never recognised as a substantial part of Waterfordâs history, and thatâs why she proposed that they be awarded the Civic Trust Blue Plaque.â\n\nAs part of the Womenâs Centre Pink Plaque campaign they nominate a deserving woman or women for a Blue Plaque, which is unveiled each year on International Womenâs Day. Since the plaque was unveiled on March 8 a few more names of cockle women have been identified. In Passage East there were the three Kelly sisters, Masher (Mary Cleere), Nana (Ellen Robinson) and Maggie Furlong, Katty Dwyer, Janie Organ, Ellie Murphy, Mary Ivory and Elizabeth Hearne. Some of the womenâs daughters also picked cockles, including Kitty and Johanna.â\n\nThe pride for the cockle women is ingrained through the generations. Many have contributed to the project including Maggie Furlongâs grandson John and great-grandson Sean, and Masherâs grandsons James and John. Janie Organâs grandson and Stasia Ryanâs son Paddy Ryan provided the music at the unveiling ceremony, while Maura Power nee Robinson, granddaughter of Nana Ellen Robinson, Grainne Flanagan, great granddaughter, and Saoirse Flanagan, great great granddaughter of Katty Dwyer, unveiled the blue plaque. All in all, over 40 family members attended the event.\n\nââIâd love to hear if there are any more out there. The story is much bigger than I expected it to be,â Breda said. âCertainly from the numbers of people who came forward it is forming a big part of history.\n\nââAn exhibition called âWomen at Workâ featuring the cockle women, which is the work of Ann Fitzgerald and Andy Kelly, continues in Central Library until March 30. The collection of photographs is being constantly updated with unseen photographs generously provided by the families of the cockle women.\n\nJohn Coghlan\n\nA Doctor of Famine times was remembered by Waterford Civic Trust earlier this month with a Heritage Blue Plaque unveiled at Coach House Coffee in Kilmacthomas.\n\nThe plaque honours Dr. John Coghlan, a distinguished doctor and humanitarian who arrived in Dungarvan in 1832, as a dispensary doctor, transferring to Kilmacthomas on February 1, 1833. He was to serve the community for forty years, winning their deep appreciation and respect as a highly regarded medical practitioner.\n\nIn 1845, famine broke out in Ireland and Dr. Coghlan advocated for a fever hospital in Kilmacthomas, serving as its medical officer when it opened. He also championed the workhouse and infirmary, which opened in 1851.\n\nA great humanitarian, who was deeply concerned about the welfare of those entrusted to his care, he was active in projects tackling the poverty, squalor, disease and starvation prevalent in the district. These included a soup kitchen, the planting of vegetable gardens, the supply of clothing and blankets, improvements to housing conditions and the cultivation of a textile industry.\n\nAt times, his concern found him in conflict with the Board of Guardians, which was responsible for the management of the fever hospital and workhouse. Dr. Coghlan did not consider the diet in the hospital as adequate and informed the Guardians of his opinion. They were not willing to incur additional expense to remedy the situation. They pointed out to him a list of hospitals which were run more cheaply.\n\nThis prompted Coghlan, who died in 1874, to observe: âIf it became the practice to put one hospital against another merely for the cheapness at which it carried out its duties, I know of nothing which could prove more destructive to the objects for which hospitals have been instituted.\n\nâDes Griffin, Chair of Waterford Civic Trust, said he believes that it is important to record the actions and achievements of a person who did so much to improve the lives of others.\n\nâDuring times of famine and great distress Dr. John Coghlan served the people of Kilmacthomas and the adjoining areas with great professionalism and real compassion. An unsung hero, the Heritage Blue Plaque gives him the public recognition he richly deservesâ.Â\n\nCarnegie Library\n\nBuilt in 1910, Convent Street, Tallow, the Carnegie Library is one of a group of five in County Waterford and one of over 2,500 worldwide, donated by Scottish philanthropist and business man Andrew Carnegie (1835-1919), at the turn of the twentieth century. (Des Griffin Waterford Civic Trust).\n\nBorn in Scotland, Carnegie emigrated with his family to the US in search of a better life. At 12 he began working in the cotton industry and through his natural ability and application became one of the worldâs richest men.\n\nBetween 1897 and 1913, Carnegie promised over â¬179,000 to pay for the building of some 80 libraries in Ireland, 60 of which survive today. (Bray People article by Mary Fogarty August 24th 2019 via www.independent.ie )\n\nScotland-born industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie amassed an early 20th century steel industry fortune estimated at $309 billion in todayâs money, more than double the $136 billion of Bill Gates software wealth. More importantly, Carnegie was the âfather of modern philanthropyâ, including the funding of 2509 public libraries in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand.In Ireland, 80 Carnegie library branches were opened between 1897 and 1913, a decade before the islandâs political partition and civil war. Carnegie died 11 August 1919, at age 83.Â Â\n\nOn the centenary of Andrew Carnegieâs death, An Post issued some new stamps to commemorate four of the libraries in the Republic of Ireland.Â At the unveiling of these stamps on the 14th of August 2019, Felix M Larkin, Chairman of An Postâs Philatelic Advisory Committee, and founding member of the Newspaper and periodical History Forum of Ireland said in his speech:\n\nâA characteristic of the Carnegie libraries is that, apart from their contribution to scholarship and learning, they were invariably housed in beautiful buildings â architectural ornaments in the towns and cities in which they were locatedâ¦Libraries are the foundation of all scholarship, where books, newspapers, photographs, prints and drawings â and now digital material too â are lovingly preserved for posterity. And they are preserved not only for use by the elite scholar laboring away in a university, in an ivory tower (so to speak), but for everyone with the curiosity to want to learn more about history, literature and a host of other things - or indeed just to enjoy the pleasure of reading and be enriched by it. Libraries are fundamentally democratic centers of learning, open to everyone â and free.â¦\n\nCarnegie funded libraries, museums, and other cultural institutions in the region that directly contributed to my ability to learn about history, literature and a host of other thingsâ. (Mark Holan Irish American Blog www.markholan.org).Â\n\nJames Upton\n\nJames W Upton was an Irish journalist who participated in the 1916 Easter Rising, but whose contribution to Ireland and dedication to the freedom of speech is largely forgotten today.\n\nUpton started working as a reporter for the Waterford Star newspaper in 1904, after several years of writing Gaelic reports for various regional newspapers under the pseudonym âValiant.â Â The Sinn FÃ©iner was forced to resign from the paper in 1914 as a result of his nationalist activity and became the editor of the Kilkenny Journal. He also wrote and edited for Joseph Stanleyâs Gaelic Press, providing copy for the Gaelic Athlete and editing Honesty and the Spark under the pen names Gilbert Galbraith and Ed Dalton.\n\nIn March 1916, the British authorities raided the Gaelic Press. Afterwards, Stanley and Upton continued publication of the Spark in the basement of Liberty Hall, under a guard provided by the Irish Citizen Army.\n\nA recent piece in the Irish Times recounts Uptonâs contribution to the 1916 Easter Rising: âOn Monday, April 24th, following a meeting with Pearse and Connolly in the GPO, Stanley commandeered a small printing works in Halston Street in order to print and distribute Pearseâs bulletins. Upton remained with Stanley throughout the Easter Rising, jointly authoring several articles in Irish War News and assisting with printing and distribution of subsequent bulletins. In the aftermath of the Rising, Upton slipped back to Kilkenny to continue his editorial role and republican agitation; activities that earned him a Black and Tan 'death warrant' in 1921.\n\nâUpton has never received recognition for his role, in part due to his own reticence in seeking credit. He refused to claim a pension or medal, saying that what he did was for Ireland and he did not want a reward for a job âonly half done.â\n\nAfter leaving the Kilkenny Journal in 1922, Upton spent and number of years working as a freelancer and served six years as editor of the radical national weekly journal Honesty.\n\nThe Irish Times writes: âUpton, who had a lifetime commitment to freedom of speech, offered a platform in Honesty to political views from across the spectrum, a policy that would eventually bring him into conflict with the leadership of Fianna FÃ¡il. In July 1929, Upton published an article by Patrick Belton that attacked the leadership of the party, accusing them, among other things, of lying in the DÃ¡il. Boland and Lemass cited Beltonâs article as justification for surreptitiously instructing the party membership to boycott Honesty, an action that effectively sounded its death knell.\n\nâHowever, the attack on Honesty was as much about de Valeraâs interest in the flagging Nation and the soon to be launched Irish Press, as it was about their ire at Uptonâs editorial policy. Honesty struggled on for another couple of years but eventually closed in February 1931. In May of the same year Upton launched a new publication, Publicity; however, it failed after just eight months, ultimately ending Uptonâs career as an editor.\n\nâUpton would continue to work as a freelance journalist until 1945, when he was forced to take up employment as a reference librarian with Waterford City Library.\n\nHe died in Waterford, in 1956, at the age of 84.Â\n\nPatrick O'Keeffe\n\nOn the 15th of April 2019 (the 107th anniversary of the exact day the Titanic sank), Waterford Civic Trust unveiled a Heritage Blue Plaque remembering Waterford man, Patrick OâKeeffe, who was a survivor of one of the greatest maritime disasters of all time, the sinking of the RMS Titanic, on the 15th of April 1912.Â Â\n\nPatrick OâKeeffe was born on the 11th of July 1890 in Little Michael Street; the first of eight children born to John and Catherine OâKeeffe.Â He received his education from the Sisters of Charity and the De La Salle Brothers.\n\nAt the age of nineteen â or even younger â Patrick went to America.Â In 1912 he decided to return to Waterford and spend a holiday with his family, now living at 2, Spring Garden Alley.Â It was during this visit that one of his brothers persuaded him to stay a week longer.Â This required that Patrick change his ticket from the Baltic to one for the maiden voyage of the Titanic\n\n.On the 11th of April he boarded the liner at Queenstown (Cobh), County Cork.Â As a third class passenger on the âunsinkable shipâ, he was assigned a cabin, which he shared with other single men, on one of the lower decks.\n\nWhen the Titanic struck an iceberg just before midnight on the 14th of April, Patrick was quick to react when water started to come into his cabin.Â He jumped off the sinking ship; fortunately, he was a strong swimmer, and reached the famous overturned âCollapsible Bâ life raft, that âbecame the last refuge from death in the icy North Atlanticâ.Â He helped pull other passengers from the freezing water.Â The survivors were rescued by the ship Carpathia and taken to New York.Â Patrick never again returned to Ireland, and died in 1939.\n\nWriting to his father from New York, shortly after his rescue, he told of a premonition he had of the disaster. âI dreamt myself she [Titanic], was going down before I left Queenstown, and I thought to sell my passage, but I thought if I went back to Waterford again the boys would be laughing at me.Â I lost everything I had on the Titanic, but thank God, my life was spared.â\n\nLike other survivors, he put in a claim against the shipâs owners, the White Star Line, for his losses and injuries.Â The compensation offered him was a third class passage back to Ireland, provided that he did not take any legal action against the company.Â This offer was declined by Patrick.Â Lawsuits continued until 1916 when a final settlement of $663,000 was made to six-hundred and fifty-one claimants.Â As a steerage passenger, Patrick only received a small amount of this money.Â Â\n\nPatrick OâKeeffe was the only Waterford person on board the doomed Titanic, and only one of sixty-nine third class passengers to survive out of over five hundred men.Â"
