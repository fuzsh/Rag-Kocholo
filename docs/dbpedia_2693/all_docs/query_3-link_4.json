From Bob Marley to Alan Turing, Virginia Woolf to Vincent Van Gogh, Mahatma Gandhi to Emmeline Pankhurst, the plaques celebrate an incredible range of London's past residents.\n\nWhether they be scientists, sports stars, artists, actors, inventors or politicians this revised and updated English Heritage guide reveals, with wit and insight, the stories of London's most extraordinary men and women and the homes in which they lived.\n\n'The blue plaque helps us make poetry from the everyday, infusing the hard materials of the city with the feeling of lives lived: a memory of the past making the present richer.' The Guardian\n\nKey Features:"
