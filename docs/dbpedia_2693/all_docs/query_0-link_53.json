        "text": "LONDON — An 18th-century antislavery campaigner and author, Ottobah Cugoano, has become the earliest Black figure to be honored with one of London’s iconic blue plaques, the heritage organization that manages the program said on Friday.\n\nThe plaques, dotted on buildings around the city for the past 154 years, offer tiny tributes to the men and women who have made the British capital what it is. But more often than not, they have been dominated by the tales of white men.\n\nIn recent years, English Heritage, which manages what is now a nationwide program to celebrate notable figures and the places they lived and worked, has been trying to change that.\n\nMr. Cugoano, considered a hero of the antislavery movement in Britain, was enslaved as a teenager and later became a prominent campaigner and writer, denouncing the evils of slavery and making arguments against the slave trade that were considered radical for the time.\n\nThe historian David Olusoga, who serves on the panel that commissions new plaques, called Mr. Cugoano a “remarkable man” who had known and survived the horrors of slavery and then “used words and arguments to fight against the slave trade and slavery.”\n\n“Cugoano was a true pioneer — the first African to demand the total abolition of slavery and one of the leaders” of London’s Black community, Mr. Olusoga said in a statement. “I am delighted that English Heritage is celebrating his life with a blue plaque.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
