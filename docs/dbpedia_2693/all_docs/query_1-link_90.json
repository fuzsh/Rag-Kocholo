        "text": "An enthusiast has looked at the value of blue plaque properties in west London ahead of the English Heritage scheme’s 150th anniversary.\n\nIt exclusively features properties from Kensington and Chelsea and Westminster, and the includes the abodes of poets, a Prime Ministers, writers and roaylty. It also indicates the extra value one of the famous plaques can add to a property in the capital.\n\nBlue plaques mark current buildings that have a connection to famous figures from history, and there are 888 in London.\n\nTamir Davies, a content provider at a house buying service in Hertfordshire, decided to delve into the history of the scheme ahead English Heritage celebrations, which are due to take place in May.\n\nHer employer, Fast Sale Today, helped design infographics to illustrate her findings.\n\nThe list comes as English Heritage look to celebrate its landmark anniversary by unveiling new plaques through the country, with several in west London.\n\nThe most expensive property on her list belongs to Second World War Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill, who lived in Kensington for four years between 1909-1913.\n\nHis home, in Hyde Park Gate, near a new bronze statue in Hyde Park , is valued at £14.8 million, well above the average £5.2m property value on the road.\n\nNext on the 23-year-old’s list is philosopher John Stuart Mill, who lived in Kensington Square, South Kensington. The average property price in Kensington Square is £7m.\n\nPoet Sylvia Plath’s Primrose Hill property is valued at £4.5m and completes her top three.\n\nSuffragettes Emmeline and Christable Pankhurst lived in Clarendon Road, Notting Hill, where the average property costs £2.56m.\n\nAlso representing Notting Hill is George Orwell , who lived on Portobello Road. His former home is worth £2.75m.\n\nFellow writer Oscar Wilde’s home in Tite Street, Chelsea was on the market in 2012 for £1.15m , while the average price of a property in Kensington Court Gardens, where T.S Eliot lived, is now £3.64m.\n\nElsewhere King Charles X of France (£2.36m) lived in Mayfair, and the Soho home lived in by father of communism Karl Marx is worth £2.53m, compared to the average £1.98m.\n\nFinally, Sir Isaac Newton’s home in Jermyn Street, near Piccadillly could be worth £2.7m.\n\nHowever, none of these can compare to the most expensive private Blue Plaque home in the capital. President John F Kennedy’s extravagant former home in Knightsbridge sold for a price tag of £70m, the home is estimated to be worth up to £300m once renovated.\n\nSpeaking about her list, Tamir, said: “I research a lot of events coming up in London and the blue plaques is celebrating its 150th anniversary in May. I spoke to English Heritage and Visit London and they were able to give me stats on houses and property prices.\n\n“Most are in Kensington and Chelsea and Westminster and they are still standing. I didn’t know much about blue plaques but it was really interesting learning about them and I enjoyed putting the list together.”\n\nEnglish Heritage is due to celebrate the official weekend May 7-8 which will include walking tours around some of the capital’s most famous blue plaques.\n\nOne of its new plaques due to be unveiled this year will be in Feltham at the childhood Queen singer Freddie Mercury ."
