        "meta_description": "OBJECTIVE Appropriately chosen candidates with medically refractory epilepsy may benefit from hemispheric disconnection. Traditionally, this involves a large surgical exposure with significant associated morbidity. Minimally invasive approaches using endoscopic assistance have been described by only a few centers. Here, the authors report on the feasibility of endoscope-assisted functional hemispherotomy in a cadaver model and its first translation into clinical practice in appropriately selected patients. METHODS Three silicone-injected, formalin-fixed cadaver heads were used to establish the steps of the procedure in the laboratory. The steps of disconnection were performed using standard surgical instruments and a straight endoscope. The technique was then applied in two patients who had been referred for hemispherectomy and had favorable anatomy for an endoscope-assisted approach. RESULTS All disconnections were performed in the cadaver model via a 4 × 2–cm paramedian keyhole craniotomy using endoscopic assistance. An additional temporal burr hole approach was marked in case the authors were unable to completely visualize the frontobasal and insular cuts from the paramedian vertical view. Their protocol was subsequently used successfully in two pediatric patients. Full disconnection was verified with postoperative tractography. CONCLUSIONS Full hemispheric disconnection can be accomplished with minimally invasive endoscope-assisted functional hemispherotomy. The procedure is technically feasible and can be safely applied in patients with favorable anatomy and pathology; it may lead to less surgical morbidity and faster recovery.",

        "text": "Hemispheric disconnection is an effective surgical option for carefully selected patients with disabling, medically refractory epilepsy. Ideal candidates are typically those with an etiology attributable to diffuse abnormalities of one hemisphere. This can include perinatal strokes, developmental or migration disorders, syndromes such as Sturge-Weber, or progressive processes such as Rasmussen’s encephalitis.8,21,30 Seizure freedom rates can be as high as 90% in the long term, depending on the pathology treated and the technique of hemisphere disconnection.3,8,10,14,16,29\n\nA progression of disconnection techniques has been described over the past century, each addressing efforts to minimize exposure and complications while still accessing target deep structures. Anatomical hemispherectomy involved full exposure and removal of an entire hemisphere6,12,17 but yielded an unacceptable complication profile including superficial cerebral hemosiderosis and hydrocephalus.9,20,23 Functional hemispherectomy reduced these complications by leaving some of the brain tissue in situ;22,32 the recognition that disconnection but not resection could produce results similar to those obtained with anatomical hemispherectomy provided the basis for Villemure’s periinsular hemisphereotomy31 and Delalande’s vertical hemisphereotomy.7 Many modifications have subsequently been described, all with the goal of minimizing both excision and exposure while maximizing disconnection.24–26 Regardless of the technique used, full hemispherotomy entails disconnection of the corpus callosum, frontobasal white matter, insular white matter, and medial temporal lobe structures, including the hippocampus and fornix (Fig. 1). These approaches require a potentially large craniotomy for an adequate operative corridor and good visualization of the anatomy. This extensive surgical exposure can lead to increased surgical morbidity, including hypothermia, coagulopathy and blood loss necessitating transfusion, pain and swelling at the surgical site, complicated wound infections/revisions, and prolonged patient recovery.15\n\nIn order to minimize the surgical exposure and decrease perioperative morbidity, several groups have reported the development of endoscope-assisted disconnection procedures ranging from corpus callosotomy to complete hemispherectomy (Fig. 2).2,4,5,19,27 The evolution of surgical instruments and techniques has made cranial surgery possible through smaller operative corridors. We aimed to investigate the anatomical feasibility of an endoscope-assisted surgical technique for hemispherotomy at our institution by beginning with a cadaveric study. We then transitioned our technique into clinical practice, and here we present two patients in whom hemispherotomy with complete disconnection was performed via our minimally invasive endoscope-assisted approach.\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe demonstrated the anatomical feasibility of complete hemispheric disconnection via a minimally invasive endoscope-assisted technique in a cadaver study and subsequently translated this technique into clinical practice with encouraging preliminary results in carefully selected pediatric patients with intractable epilepsy.\n\nHemispherotomy has been a good surgical option in the treatment of medically refractory nonlesional epilepsy with seizures originating from one hemisphere. Classic techniques have required relatively extensive surgical exposure, which subjects children to the risks of bleeding, blood transfusion, fevers, postoperative aseptic meningitic symptoms, and prolonged recovery requiring extended hospitalization and inpatient rehabilitation stays. The advances of endoscopic and minimally invasive tools provide the opportunity for surgical techniques to also evolve in order to decrease perioperative morbidity and improve patient outcomes.\n\nThe anatomy of hemispherotomy has been well described.7,13,18,24,25,31 A thorough understanding of and comfort with this anatomy is essential, as the endoscopic approach uses trajectories and views structures from perspectives different from those previously described; thus, anatomical views may be unfamiliar and disorienting. However, we demonstrated that it is possible to clearly see and disconnect all critical structures using our cadaveric model. In that model, we also verified feasibility by developing back-up approaches to safely access required anatomical structures through additional burr holes and finally through standard craniotomy as necessary; these strategies were not needed in our two patients.\n\nThe callosotomy is the relatively straightforward component of the disconnection, as the working corridor is straight down along the falx, as in a standard interhemispheric approach to ventricular pathology.27 The anatomy is easily identified at the first ventricular entry into the ipsilateral ventricle, especially as most pediatric neurosurgeons are familiar with intraventricular neuroendoscopy. As the disconnection continues, maintaining orientation and identifying anatomical landmarks becomes imperative, as neuronavigation may lose accuracy with shifting of the brain tissue. A long rectangular cottonoid in the temporal horn serves as an indicator of this anatomical landmark, especially as the anatomy becomes distorted once CSF has been drained and the thin cortex of the affected hemisphere may be sagging from disconnection.\n\nOur experience in the cadaver models allowed optimization of the technique and instrument manipulation in a bloodless field. As subpial resection via microsurgical technique requires clear visualization of specific fields with a rigid endoscope (genu of corpus callosum anteriorly, splenium posteriorly, temporal horn of the lateral ventricle lateral and deep), a dynamic working relationship between surgeon and operative assistant is essential. For instance, certain portions of the surgery require the endoscope angled from the anterior margin of the craniotomy with the surgeon working from the posterior portion of the opening. Conversely, the frontobasal disconnection was most easily performed with the endoscope entering from the posterior edge of the craniotomy and aimed anteriorly, with the surgeon’s instruments working above the endoscope along the anterior edge of the craniotomy. All portions of the operative field were easily reached with our 4-cm craniotomy.\n\nSeveral modifications were made in the transition to clinical application. Optimal positioning is essential for visualization of critical structures with the rigid endoscope. The head should be sufficiently flexed to allow for the appropriate angles required to visualize the anterior and posterior disconnection, but with vigilant assessment of the airway in conjunction with the anesthesia team to avoid obstruction. It is essential to plan for and prepare the field for a possible full craniotomy in the event that endoscopic access is suboptimal and if the goals of the surgery cannot be achieved safely. Neuronavigation is used, but surgeons should always be cognizant that technology can be unreliable, especially as anatomy shifts during surgery. Intraoperative ultrasound can theoretically be a useful adjunct in identifying known landmarks. However, no surgical navigation technology can substitute for experienced, intimate knowledge of the surgical anatomy. An angled camera on the endoscope is useful for simplifying the limited working space for the traffic of instruments and hands in the surgical corridor.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that patients in whom hemispherectomy has failed are likely to have remaining hemispheric connections, particularly anteriorly, and can benefit from reoperation to complete the disconnection.11 This new technique may raise concerns that complete disconnection may be inadequately evaluated with the endoscopic view compared to the direct visualization provided by classic open procedures; therefore, we have high standards of close inspection and verification of every disconnection step. We also carefully reviewed the intraoperative endoscopic video of every surgery and verified disconnections radiographically with postoperative tractography in our patients.\n\nBlood transfusions were not required. Postoperatively, hemispherotomy patients have external ventricular drainage to allow egress of any postoperative intraventricular blood and protein in the CSF. In our two cases, the drains were weaned and removed without incident, with rapidly decreasing output and low intracranial pressures. Patients recovered quickly, without the postoperative frontotemporal scalp flap soft-tissue swelling and pain that typically accompany open craniotomy. The paramedian incisions obviated temporalis muscle disruption. Both patients were discharged home without new neurological deficits and without the need for inpatient rehabilitation.\n\nRecognizing limitations of the novel approach and equipment, as well as strengths and limitations of the operative team, is a crucial area of insight and understanding. For instance, patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome and hemimegalencephaly would not have been appropriate for initial deployment of this endoscope-assisted technology given our understanding that these cases are challenging even in standard open craniotomy approaches. Our first patients for this relatively novel technique had generously sized ventricles and thin cortical mantles. This allowed for a larger operative corridor and more working room than would be possible in the aforementioned pathologies. A learning curve is expected in the development of any new technique, and we expect to apply our technique to increasingly varied patients as workflow and surgical team skill improve.\n\nProper patient selection with thorough workup by a multidisciplinary epilepsy team is crucial in any epilepsy surgery. Careful patient selection is also essential in translating innovation in surgical technique into clinical practice. Establishing contingency plans to ensure the achievement of surgical goals, as well as head off any possible complications, is imperative. In surgery, the patients were positioned and marked for extending to standard open craniotomy, with defined intraoperative checkpoints for anatomy visualization and strict goals for complete disconnection. The surgical and anesthesia teams were prepared for possible complications as the surgeons worked around the venous sinuses and cranial vessels. Recognizing possible limitations and complications while applying rigor and safety to the development of this endoscopic surgical technique with subsequent translation into clinical care has been paramount to this process."
