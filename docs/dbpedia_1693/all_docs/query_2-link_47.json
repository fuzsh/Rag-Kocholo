        "text": "By Millicent Borges Accardi, Contributor (*)\n\nBorn and raised in Manteigas, mainland Portugal, the poet and sculptor João Martins earned a degree in Theology at the Catholic University of Lisbon where he dedicated himself to teaching and education. His father was an artist, and Martins was raised to value both the written word and visual arts.\n\nIn 1986, he arrived in the United States for a month-long visit, and he ended up relocating to New Jersey with his family. A Jury Casa de Cortes – Leiria prize winner, Martins’ literary influences include Ruy Belo, Pablo Neruda, José Luis Peixoto, Ted Koser, and Carlos Drumond Andrade.\n\nHe has published seven books:Exercício de Pintura (poetry); A Estrelinha da Serra (short stories);Cânticos Paralelos (poetry); Intervalo das Palavras (poetry); Quando toda a Esperança é Azul (biography); O Seu Nome Era Maria (illustrated poem); and Mãos Verdadeiras (poetry).\n\nA member of the Portuguese Writers Society and founder of ProVerbo – the cultural arm of the Portuguese Sport Club of Newark, NJ – Martins organizes cultural galas, literary events, and other club activities. Boavista Press recently published his bilingual poetry book, ‎Quando Menino Eu Lia – I Read as a Boy (October, 2014).\n\nIn this interview for Portuguese American Journal, Martins discusses poetry,his Portuguese heritage and his wood carvings of hands and books.\n\nYou relocated with your family to the US in 1986 after a vacation, why did you decide to stay?\n\nWe came for a family wedding and enjoyed a three month vacation in the US. Anticipating future opportunities for the kids, new perspectives, challenges, we decided to stay. But we always have kept close ties with the family overseas.\n\nYou have written a poem where you describe your relationship with being Portuguese. Would you mind sharing it with PAJ readers?\n\nbroken English\n\nmy speech and my accent may be broken\n\nmy dreams are intact.\n\neven if dreams can bed dreamt in any language\n\nit’s easier to dream\n\nwith the words we learned\n\nwith mother’s milk and dreams\n\nas universal as a heart\n\nat home we dream and speak polyphonically\n\nin my childhood language I taught my children\n\n(and here relying on the ties of distance and time)\n\nin their language I learned\n\nthe new colors of dreams\n\nand word by word, dreams by dream\n\nand with the words of the heart\n\ninstead of broken ties\n\nwe have tied arms\n\nsince the time that feelings remained\n\nfrom roots of other times\n\nand dreams bonded roots to fruit and future\n\nthis same future is like a book\n\nnow with new pages, new words\n\nnew shared dreams.\n\nold words will continue to be used\n\nand timeless emotions\n\nto build the dreams of tomorrow\n\nlike yesterday and beyond\n\nthe language and words\n\nrelating the hearts.\n\nFor our readers, can you describe the theme of your latest book: Quando Menino Eu Lia…– I Read as a Boy?\n\nA fascination with and a love for words….The book is about the menino, the young boy, who has lived inside me since I was a boy, from my early teens of reading the books that I borrowed from the book mobile. In a certain sense, some autobiographic appointments directed me within the writing, reflecting on them at a distance. And the menino keeps looking for the meaning of the words, trying to make sense of them, new meanings, new senses.\n\nWhat is the significance of the title I Read as a Boy?\n\nAs a boy, I read everything that came my way: history, stories for young kids, all the books that I was able to bring home from the mobile library, a max of six, I think, that I would read under the blanket at night with a flashlight to not disturb my parents and siblings.\n\nI was anxious to learn everything–literally–reading sports papers, religious books, stories, books from the library… Then I discovered the grownups’ vocabulary, and all this process of becoming an adult, flashbacks to a young age, toward the natural development of learning new words, discovering new worlds.\n\nCan you share an excerpt from the book?\n\nThe first verses in the beginning of the book set up the concept and the story unfolds:\n\nI read as a boy …\n\nBoy’s books in boy’s\n\nwords with boy’s tales\n\nas a boy I was in a hurry\n\nto walk to learn to run\n\nto read and do many other\n\nthings the grownups reserve for themselves.\n\nI went from dream to dream\n\ninching forward from tiny step onto tiny step\n\nas big as the age\n\nlate in coming.\n\nI read little tiny lines\n\nuppercase letters were\n\ngrownup letters\n\ntall words in the eyes of a boy.\n\non the sly I read the books\n\nI devoured in the library\n\nthat every week\n\nwaited for me wandering\n\nin the town square the square of ideas\n\nI read and read and more I wanted the\n\n[boy’s stories\n\nor of the boys\n\nsince poetry was to me still unknown\n\nof later verses\n\nwhich I would keep in memory’s pockets\n\nand recited even without knowing\n\nit was possible to write\n\ndifferently. and books aggregated\n\nambitions difficult words\n\nmeals of pleasure and writing\n\nas in my six year old postcard\n\nsent from far beyond the beach.\n\nThe book is bilingual. It could have been in Portuguese or English only. What made you decide to present the poems in both languages?\n\nAfter publishing seven books in Portuguese (the language I was born into and feel more comfortable writing in), I decided to share my poetry with the Portuguese American community where some readers are not so comfortable reading in Portuguese, as a way of trying to reach that audience and make new connections.\n\nWhat makes a great poem?\n\nThat readers find new meanings for the words. If someone, after reading my verses and, because of that, kisses the one she or he loves, and thinks — wow!–then, it was great for me to write that line. A poem must wake up the senses!\n\nCan you describe where you write?\n\nA table, a computer, my hands and pieces of paper where I write thoughts to digest and later reflect and develop.\n\nA small room, containing hundreds of books, hundreds of CDs, (classical and Portuguese folk music), hundreds of wood-carved sculptures, (my collection), some from my father’s pieces and some mine. A computer where I drop all the “small pieces of paper notes,” and where I can write, correct, change, without wasting too much paper…\n\nWhat major project are you working on now?\n\nFerry Street Rua da Palavra, a poetic vision of three friends on the iconic street of Newark, NJ, where you find a multicultural flow of words, colors, habits.\n\npalavra de rua palavras na rua\n\npalavra que é minha palavra que é tua\n\npalavra quebrada o corpo é que sua\n\npalavra da noite pintada na lua\n\npalavra de amor ou palavra nua\n\npalavra que é o nome da rua\n\nStreet word\n\nword on the street, street words\n\nword that is my word and yours\n\nword of a broken body that is yours\n\nwords of the night painted on the moon\n\nwords of love or nude words\n\nword that are the name of a street\n\nWhat are you reading?\n\nA desumanização by Valter Hugo Mãe; Os memoráveis by Lidia Jorge; (two novels of contemporary and renowned Portuguese writers) and poems by Charles Bukowski.\n\nDo you have any upcoming public readings?\n\nNot confirmed yet, but Rutgers University, Newark; Princeton University, both in NJ, Portuguese elementary schools in Newark, Long Branch, and Elizabeth, NJ, and… many, many more, I hope.\n\nWhat is your “day job”?\n\nAs a property manager, I deal with papers and construction projects. Poetic?No!. But it provides me with lots of human experience in dealing with different people, cultures, words. I would like to have more time available to write, but, at same time, I like being in touch with people to listen and share.\n\nBesides writing, you create sculptures. What attracts you to this art form?\n\nCall it passion, I’ll say: woodcarving, especially carvings of hands… and books. Always the poetic meaning of the hands, the richness of wood mixed with books and hands! The wood natural colors and grain, where you can read stories, and bring you memories and words.\n\nWhat inspires your wood carvings?\n\nMy father was a carpenter and, besides many beautiful pieces of furniture, in his late forties, he started doing “sculptures,” small animals and anthropomorphic figures with tree routes, later developing his technique and in bas relief and other figures.\n\nI never worked wood with my father before I went to carving school, but I grew up between tools, wood and sand paper… Even today, the smell of cutting fresh wood takes me to my young years, the sensibility of my hands caressing the wood, feeling the wood grain…is an incredible sensation.\n\nMy father gave me several pieces of his carvings. Not the tools… he used to say that he needed them!…I started collecting, buying sculptures, visiting antique shops, fairs, flea markets, until six years ago I said to myself: “It is time to try it…”\n\nWhat do you hope to achieve with your art?\n\nWhen I create on a piece of paper or wood, I expect to send a message to a potential reader or observer. Art is communication. What a craftsman creates, he expects that someone will be able to read behind the book or the object.\n\nWhat can a piece of wood give you when you work it? Peace, sensibility, power of creating, power of giving. Without thinking about the “eternity,”, will be a statement of what you think and believe.\n\nCan you describe your art practice?\n\nAfter a few years admiring and collecting carved pieces, a light went on my head: “Why don’t you try it yourself, with your own hands?”\n\nEvery Saturday morning, religiously, I drive to American Woodcarving and Art School (Wayne, New Jersey).\n\nUsually I work with pictures of what I want to do, using my own hands as a model, other times, I have a “picture” in mind, and I start creating, building my own path, until I’m happy with the physical results and the message. Not necessarily until is perfect (always subjective, you always can do more), but until I believe that the piece itself has a clear message and, why not, some poetry!?\n\nHave you had a gallery show?\n\nI had my first personal exhibit July 2014, in Newark, the community where I have been working and living for the last 27 years.\n\nIt was difficult to sell my first pieces. There is a sentimental value, a personal attachment you cannot quantify. It was a surprise for most of the people who know me, because they didn’t know I created art. On the other hand, the visitors’ presence and their love for my wood work was a surprise!. The show brought me a sense of personal accomplishment because of the general public’s acceptance and celebration of my artwork\n\nWhat inspired you to sculpt a series of hands?\n\nTo put your hands on a piece of wood can mean tenderness, softness, caring, power. There is always for me a poetic sensibility. Hands can reveal personality, weakness, pride.\n\nHow many pieces representing hands do you have?\n\nProbably around sixty: twelve “hands,” about forty wooden books, landscaping, and reliefs. Some take as long as one hundred hours, others fifteen or twenty. When I do a piece, it is not necessarily for sale. Sometimes it’s difficult to be separated from my work. My sculptures are like my own children. But if my work stays behind closed doors, nobody is able to see them and enjoy them. So, I decided to open my mind to the idea of selling…\n\nWhat is your favorite piece?\n\nI see all of the imperfections in my woodcarvings! The sculpture of my Mom’s hands making lace. It depicts real meaning. Also the hands of the Portuguese guitar player, honed more than hundred and twenty hours of dedicated work. But I consider myself a beginner, always eager to learn. I admire the sculptures of the Italian artist Remo Belletti and Brazilian Cicero D’Ávila, contemporary artists. Incredible sculptures.\n\nIs there a special place close to your heart?\n\nNothing like our home (a nossa casa)–how we keep calling today, the house where “we still live” in our small village in Portugal. My Mom still lives there. My dad has passed away, and the four remaining family members live thousands of miles apart. But, like [the novelist] José Luis Peixoto expresses it so beautifully, “The smells, feelings and laughs are the same.”\n\n____________\n\n(*) Millicent Borges Accardi is a contributor to the Portuguese American Journal.
