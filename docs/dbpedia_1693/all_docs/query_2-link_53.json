LIT 105E: Masterpieces in World Literature Page 3 The name behind the pen RESOUNDING ACCLAIM FOR LUIS VAZ DE CAMÕES “Camões’ mind was the product of Renaissance classicism and Portuguese imperialism.” “He is really one of the first great chroniclers, having himself sailed most of the routes he describes rather than cobbling together tales like the Greek historians.” “Camões is wholly, passionately present in most of what he wrote.” “He manifests the poetic sensibility of a people grown by an ocean: befitting a sailing people, the distinction between brine and freshwater are central to his imagination.” “Camões poem has something of the charm of the Odyssey and of the magnificence of the Aenied.” “That famous poet Luis de Camões – who, speaking in absolutes, was the prince of them all – was a tall man with broad shoulders and reddish hair. His face was freckled and he was blind in one eye. He was a man of sharp mind, clear judgement and rare wit. He was well-read in the humanities, well- versed in the sciences, skilled at arms and valiant of spirit.” - Anonymous, early 17th century memoir Discover with Camões\n\n4. LIT 105E: Masterpieces in World Literature Page 4 Period Portuguese Renaissance Genre Epic Poetry Literary Criticism Classicism Luis Vaz de Camões is considered Portugal’s and the Portuguese language’s greatest poet. His mastery of verse has been compared to that ofShakespeare, Vondel,Homer, Virgil,and Dante. He wrote a considerable amountoflyrical poetry and drama but is bestremembered for his epic work The Lusiads (Os Lusiadas). The life behind the epic Luis Vaz de Camões was the only child ofSimaõ Vaz de Camões and wife Ana de Sá de Macedo. He belongs to a Portuguese family at minor nobility. Camões as a traveler PLACE EVENT Coimbra He is assumed to have studied at the University of Coimbra. Morocco He lost an eye during combat as a soldier for the Portuguese army. India He served as a soldier for three years after he held administrative posts. Arabia and the East African Coasts He was on military expeditions launched from western, Portuguese-ruled India. Macao He was an employee of the Portuguese government. Mozambique He had no funds enough to continue the journey back home. Henry the Navigator Its curiosity as well as its economic considerations caused Portugal to look seaward from as early as the end of the thirteenth century. Among other interests, Portugal wanted to find Prester John, a mythical Christian leader who is thought to be living anywhere from northeastern Africa to Asia. Establishing contact with such a mysterious Christian leader had long intrigued most of Europe, for he would be an important ally in the Christian crusade against the infidel. In actual practice, Portuguese overseas expansion dates from at least 1415, when King John I attacked and conquered Ceuta on the northwest coast of Africa. The new possession would be as important as a symbol ofthe Portuguese presence in Africa as it was a trading post. King John’s renowned son Henry the Navigator (1394-1460) had participated in the conquest of Ceuta. Although he did not personally do much sailing, Henry showed avid interestin the theory and practice of navigation, especially during the last 20 years of his life from atop the Sagres promontory in southern Portugal. Gradually, he fastened on to the idea of finding a sea route to India. Sailing back to History\n\n5. LIT 105E: Masterpieces in World Literature Page 5 Why India? Across the Indian Ocean to Calicut, India, is a place that a number of historians have seen as the defining moment of the beginning of modernity. It shrank the globe, thereafter yoking Asia inseparably with Western Europe. It pulled commerce out of the Mediterranean Sea to the Atlantic Ocean. Christian and Moors The Christians had fought Moors for centuries. In 1492, the Christians were expelled from neighboring Granada in Spain. Over the years up to the time of Camões, Portugal had both initiated crusades and taken part in campaigns led by Christian allies against the Moors. One must remember that 15th century evangelical zeal often took the form of a crusade. Crusaders were much more Christian soldiers than preachers. They used their swords more readily than their Bibles. This form of evangelization sometimes became a “just war” against infidels. The idea was to eliminate resistance, even by bloodshed, establish the Church, and evangelize the inhabitants. RESOUNDING ACCLAIM FOR THE LUSIADS “The treasure of Portugal.” “The Lusiads is Portugal’s national epic and an Aenied of imperialism.” “Camões’ incorporation of Roman gods and goddesses into this tale of nautical adventure accords da Gama a heroic stature and imbues his journey, which is presented as the culmination of Portuguese history, with an aura of mythic and legendary.” “The Lusiads is a poem of national destiny, for Camões sees Portugal as the force that will bring Christianity and civilization to the rich lands of the East.” “Camões combines classical pagan and Christian figures in a way typical of much Renaissance literature.” “The Lusiads comprises of fantastical creatures, ocean journeys, moralistic sermons, and national foundations – in other words, the Gilgamesh, Iliad, Mahabharata, and Aeneid all rolled into one.” Written in Homeric fashion, The Lusiads (Os Lusiadas) focuses mainly on a fantastical interpretation of the Portuguese voyages ofdiscovery during the 15th and 16th centuries. It is often regarded as Portugal’s national epic, much in the way as Virgil’s Aenied was for the Ancient Romans, or Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey for the AncientGreeks. The influence of his masterpiece The Lusiads is so profound that Portuguese is called the “language of Camões.” It was first printed in 1572, three years after the author returned from the Indies. An EPIC Discovery\n\n6. LIT 105E: Masterpieces in World Literature Page 6 Why The Lusiads? The poem’s title derives from the name ‘Lusitania’, the Latin name for Portugal. Since Lusus is the mythical and eponymous hero of Lusitania, the title indicates that Camões is concerned with Portuguese history and achievements. Internal structure The poem consists of ten cantos, with a variable number of stanzas (1102 in total), written in the decasyllabic ottava rima in a total of 8816 lines of verse. The word ‘decasyllable’ means a line of a verse made up often syllables while the word ‘ottava rima’ means a verse form made up of eight lines in iambic pentameter with the rhyme scheme ABABABCC. The rhyme scheme, which is of Italian origin and used by Ariosto in his Orlando furioso, was commonly used in Renaissance epic poetry. It is a flowing meter that allows the narrative to move smoothly, and the long, assonant rhymes have a kind of lulling quality. The poem is made up of four sections:  An introduction (proposition – presentation of the theme and heroes of the poem)  Invocation – a prayer to the Tagides, the nymphs of the Tagus;  A dedication – (to Sebastian of Portugal), followed by narration (the epic itself)  An epilogue, (beginning at Canto X, stanza 145) The middle section contains the narration and a variety of scenes. The most important part of The Lusiads, the arrival in India, was placed at the point in the poem that divides the work according to the golden section at the beginning of Canto VII. TRIVIA During Camões’ return journey, near the Mekong River along the Cambodian coast, he was shipwrecked, saving his manuscript but losing his Chinese lover, Dinamene. His shipwreck survival in the Mekong Delta was enhanced by the legendary detail that he succeeded in swimming ashore while holding aloft the manuscript of his still-unfinished epic. Elements of an Epic “The Lusiads” OMNISCIENT NARRATION The vast majority of the narration in The Lusiads consists of grandiloquent speeches by various orators. LEGENDARY HERO Vasco da Gama is the chief character in The Lusiads, but he is not its hero. The true heroes of this patriotic epic are The Lusiads, the sons of Lusus – in other words, the Portuguese. For a hero in the Christian epic to attain a legendary degree of glory, there had to be an equally legendary “evil” to vanquish. The anti-Christian Moors of the 16th century easily filled that role. SUPERHUMAN STRENGTH OR VALOR The Lusus are beings of national importance and historical or legendary significance. The explorer Vasco da Gama is the discoverer of sea route to India and the first European to sail around the Cap of Good Hope at Africa’s southern tip. Both their wanderings and their face of extreme odds are deeds of great valor.\n\n7. LIT 105E: Masterpieces in World Literature Page 7 MULTIPLE SETTINGS The setting of The Lusiads involves a large number of places like Melinde, East Africa, India and the Isle of Love. SUPERNATURAL INVOLVEMENT Venus favors the Portuguese while Bacchus opposes. Mars intervenes passionately on Venus side and Jupiter states his support of the voyage. Neptune, on the other hand, aids Bacchus in failing the journey of the Portuguese. EPIC STYLE OF WRITING The use of actual historical events was used as the basis of the story. Although Virgilian in its broad scope, The Lusiads is Homeric in style. It was written in the decasyllabic ottava rima, which has the rhyme scheme ABABABCC. This heroic poem, which has most Christian and historical subject matter, frequently uses the elements taken from pagan mythology to enhance the epic stature of the Portuguese nation. MEDIAS RES Vasco da Gama and his crew have already rounded the Cape of Good Hope. The epic begins already on their voyage to India. INVOCATION A prayer to the Tagides and the nymphs of the Tagus. TRIVIA  It was rumored that Camões fell in love with Catherine of Ataide, lady-in-waiting to the Queen. She was presumably the inspiration for this epic. EXTENDED, FORMAL SPEECHES The vast majority of the narration in The Lusiads consists of grandiloquent speeches by various orators: the main narrator; Vasco da Gama who is recognized as eloquent captain; Paulo da Gama; Thetis; and the Siren who tells the future in Canto X. CATALOGUES OF WARRIORS, ARMIES, ETC. This was evident in the introduction of The Lusiads in which it presents the theme as well as the heroes of the poem.\n\n8. LIT 105E: Masterpieces in World Literature Page 8 Characters Description Vasco da Gama He is a Portuguese sailor and explorer.

Venus saves the ships.\n\n10. LIT 105E: Masterpieces in World Literature Page 10 The Cycle of an Epic Hero’s Journey “The Lusiads” Status Quo The epic begins with a dedication section with the poet paying homage to Virgil and Homer. The first line of this epic mimics the opening line of Aenied, and pays a hopeful tribute to the young king Sebastiao. Call to Adventure The people of Lusus have gone on to discover new worlds and impose its law in the concert of the nations. Jupiter says that their history proves it because they have emerged victorious against the Moors and Castilians. Assistance At a council of the gods on Olympus in Greece, Venus favors the Portuguese while Bacchus speaks against them. Mars intervenes passionately on Venus side and Jupiter states his support of the voyage. Neptune, on the other hand, aids Bacchus in failing the journey of the Portuguese. Departure The Lusiads has gone on a voyage to discover new worlds. The Roman gods and goddesses watch over the voyage lead by Vasco da Gama. Trials Two scouts, who were sent by da Gama to go to the east, are fooled by a fake altar created by Bacchus into thinking there are Christians among the Muslims. Consequently, the explorers are lured into ambush but successfully survived with the aid of Venus. During the voyage, the sailors see the Southern Cross, St. Elmo’s Fire (maritime whirlwind), and face a variety of dangers and obstacles such as the hostility of natives in the episode of Fernão Veloso, the fury of a monster in the episode of the giant Adamastor, and the disease and death caused by scurvy. Approach Bacchus, seeing that the Portuguese are about to arrive in India, asks for help of Neptune. Neptune, who supports Bacchus, unleashes powerful winds to sink the armada. Crisis Vasco da Gama, seeing the near destruction of his caravels, prays to his own God, but it is Venus who helps the Portuguese. She sends the Nymphs to seduce the winds and calm them down. Treasure The Portuguese reaches the Indian city of Calicut. Result Bacchus appears in a vision to a Muslim priest in Samorin’s court and convinces him that the explorers are a threat. So, the Muslims plot to detain the Portuguese so that the people of Mecca can arrive to attack them. However, a Muslim named Monsayeed tells da Gama of the conspiracy, and they escape from Calicut. Return To reward the explorers for their effort, Venus prepares the Isle of Love for them to rest on and asks her son Cupid to inspire the Nereids with desire for them. When the sailors arrive on the island, the ocean nymphs surrender quickly. New Life During a sumptuous feast on the Isle of love, Tethys, who is now the lover of da Gama, prophecies the future of Portuguese exploration and conquest. Resolution The sailors again set sail for home.\n\n11.
