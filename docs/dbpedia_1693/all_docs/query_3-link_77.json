        "text": "Logs ( 200 )\n\n2330hrs 05 Sep 2005 UTC 21’39”N 025’09”W Ref 333\n\nAll the forecasts predict severe thundersqualls ahead of us – for me the scariest part of sailing, probably irrationally – and I can see lightning flashes over the horizon. If we disappear from the airwaves without warning, don’t panic – probably just the electronics fried by static. A strike or near miss could take out every computer chip in the boat. That would certainly fix the USB problem. We have a metal box to protect the satphone and a handheld GPS but we haven’t tested it and it may not work. Highly unlikely, but if it does happen, it is possible that we could be out of touch for a couple of months unless we can talk to a ship.\n\nFrom Malcom C.\n\nJust an idle thought, do you listen to news via radio, e.g. BBC or do you rely purely on news people email you. How in touch are y’all with day to day events? Such as New Orleans crisis.\n\nMalcom, I have a tiny short wave radio (Chinese, of course) and I can sometimes get the BBC and sometimes other more exotic english speaking programs – was listening to Star Radio News from Monrovia, Liberia earlier this evening, and then got the BBC for a bit. IsabellaAlex's sister sends us news summaries as well, so we do know about Katrina. But please keep us posted about CoopersCoopers Sparkling Ale: - according to Alex: “brewed in the bottle, so a bit of sludge comes with it - best beer on the planet - beats a Pan Galactic Gargleblaster hands down”. Also a home brew from a Cooper’s Kit, perfected by onboard master-brewer Pete. See Pete’s interesting equation and anything else you think we might be hanging out for news of…\n\nHrungecomely BlurbleflunketHappy birthday Gra! 2 @ 60 in one week is overdoing things a bit. And 1 @ 63 on Thursday too. A week of birthdays.\n\n0900hrs 06 Sep 2005 UTC 20’49”N 025’16”W Ref 334\n\n2049 02516 06/0900 -3\n\nDB: 116, 11353 (GPS 120) slow day. Lightning seems to have moved westwards. We should pass close enough to see Santo Antao Island, the westernmost of the Cape Verdes, on Thursday morning if the wind holds.\n\n1533hrs 06 Sep 2005 UTC 20’17”N 025’29”W Ref 335\n\nAlthough where we are, local time is nearly 2 hours behind UTC. Very slow day – tooling along with the assyAsymetric spinnaker just filling and collapsing as the boat rolls. No fun – and hot, sticky, humid and hazy as well. The weather forecast says thundersqualls ahead south of the Cape Verdes and, ominously, has changed it’s terminology from ‘severe’ to ‘violent’ gustsShort increases in wind speed – or people who signed the Gust Book.. We’ll be down to the #5 and probably the engine if we get close to one of those.\n\nBut we’re still chiselling away at the old uncarved block – or, in a mirror concept, watching the road not travelled disappearing out of reach over the horizon. We’ve knocked off over 2000 miles from about 13 which is a decent chunk.\n\nThe satphone will be on on Friday from say 0600 UTC all day (Oz evening) so you can talk to the birthday old geezerDictionaries define a geezer as an old person, generally an eccentric old man. Its origin likely in the word masquerader (colloquially, guiser) from Middle English gysar. Go figure, as the Americans say.. It will cost you about $15 per minute, so you’d better work out what you want to say and then say it – no time for trivia!. The only possible showstopper might be those thundersqualls, in which case the satphone will be firmly tucked away in its box. Don’t leave messages – if we don’t answer, try again in a couple of minutes then give up. + 881 621 440078\n\n2130hrs 06 Sep 2005 UTC 19’56”N 025’32”W Ref 336\n\nWell Gra has joined the OGC whilst we, a nanospot upon the vast pachydermal curve, spent the day drenched in sweat battling for every metre – one down now is one less later. P,P,P & P with Pee the colour of best Darjeeling and a widdly dribble at that. There’s a tiny African moth running around on the screen as I write – Senegalese or Gambian perhaps. Spends its time running up the screen, flying to the bottom and running up again – Sisyphus the Moff? Or was it someone else condemned to roll a peanut up a slope with his nose?\n\nWas thinking, if that’s the word, about the Tao and uncarved blocks – Michaelangelo said that he released his figures from their blocks of marble and there’s an unfinished work in Florence where the figure is – amazingly – emerging from the surrounding marble. Stunning Renaissance magic, but the Taoist scholar might have asked ‘But, lao Mike, why that figure? Why did you choose that one from the infinite millions that were in the block before you started to mess with it? Wouldn’t it have been better to have left them all there?’ The yin and the yang approaches – the classical and the romantic, the road not travelled. Why do I foist this twaddle upon you all?\n\nI have carefully collected a sample of what it probably Mauretania – there was a film of dust on the solar panel and I have it in a bag – looks like mud, rather than the red dust that lives under the eyelids in remoter Oz.\n\nWe have the engine going again – sultry hazy night, still drenched in sweat, dripping into my lap as i sit here slaving away.\n\nFrom Allan FenwickA friend and clearly a colourful character\n\nI do hope you know I’m only having a bit of fun with you straight laced buggers, Now your knocking my spelling, yes the louisiades, don’t you know engrish when you see it. 6 months of sun and fun, and no I’m not taking Gordon, I still haven’t forgiven himfor the gay thing, but his broken nose has healed but a bit still a bit bent. Keep sailing ,Africa on the left and south America on the right for a little while yet then turn left, I will let you know when, email me if you get lost and I will send new instructions if you can understand my spelling.\n\nFenwickA friend and clearly a colourful character, I was really worried there for a moment – thought you really cared – ah well. Sorry to hear Gordo misbehaved yet again.\n\nTwo more USB crashes today – have worked out a slightly more effective procedure for rebuilding the thing – at least, I think I have. But desperately, screamingly, ragingly infuriatingly frustrating – and having to insert the bloody dongle every time to get CMap up seems so unnecessary and just another device to give it the yips. As it does. All y’all should be proud of my forbearance and tolerance – the temptation to hit it with my metaphorical rifle butt is very strong.\n\n0430hrs 07 Sep 2005 UTC 19’32”N 025’38”W Ref 337\n\nFrom Pete:\n\nHello out there,\n\nIt’s about 2,am the the engine has stopped and were now sailing goose-winged with about 8-10 kts from the north.\n\nTo the right across the pond you can hear the steel band playing outside the “Admiral’s Inn”, you can smell the rum as its poured over the ice in a long tall glass, the ice cracks as the warm rum hits it…..AAAAAHH….the tropics again. During the day the air is hazy, heavy, humid and hot but tonight we have a beautiful warm breeze helping the Berri slide along at a steady 3.5 – 4 knots. Not much has happened since we left Falmouth no disasters very little wind the engine rattling away sucking up the limited diesel supply so early in the trip. About 160 miles south and slightly to the left are the Cape Verde Islands further left on the African coast lies Senegal. We passed the Canary Islands a while back but were not close enough to see anything, before that though we sailed close to Medeira.\n\nNow that island looks interesting. We had a good view of the NW W and S sides passing the island during the late afternoon and night. The NW and W sides of the island have sheer cliffs dropping vertically to the water with deep valleys and faults breaking the line of this flat surface. Set on the very top of these cliffs were small villages connected by a road and joining the main road which was sited close to a sharp toothed ridge running east west along the island’s major axis. The S side of the island was not steep to, it was a more gentle slope with houses running down to the water’s edge. On the chart Medeira looked about 30 by 15 miles and egg shaped. Looking back at it later in the night the orange lights of the villages strung together by the house lights along the roads gave the impression of a gold necklace adorning the island.\n\nThe FastnetFastnet Race: 608 mile biennial race from Cowes, UK, Isle of Wight, to the Fastnet Rock off Southern Ireland, finishing in Plymouth. Berrimilla took part in 2005 and 2009. race how good was that result. I can only say it’s a great feeling to wake up after that, lie back and think ” How sweet it is “. We only missed out on the fairytale finish the top spot on the podium by 26 mins. not bad after nearly five and half days of racing. Berri’s 11th. out of 264 I think who finished in IRC division was a huge result, especially when you consider that over 90% of the boats we beat were fully crewed. Thanks for living the dream Alex.\n\nA while ago I had asked my youngest daughter Tessa if she could send me some cds for the trip home, when they arrived I noted that included amongst them was Pink Floyd’s The Wall. On the morning of the race I had a listen to it.\n\nThe opening track starts with a lilting acoustic guitar solo that I could barely hear so I upped the volume, a voice came in……”Hey you…… out there in the cold getting lonely getting old ..can you feel me…” the first stanza finished with ..”Don’t give in without a fight..”. Then the full volume hit me blasting the brain with soaring electric guitar riffs and mega bass drums. This was operatic stuff, this would lead us into battle, this was Berri’s anthem.\n\nI finished listening to the cd, had faint idea what it was all about and took from it what I needed, I was pumped up, feeling 20 years younger and hot to trot. This feeling continued throughout the race especially on the kiteSailors’ slang for a spinnaker ride home, it seemed we were always in this one right from the start. Now to other business. In a couple of days time on the ninth of September I turn 60. Everybody is invited to the party, space and access on the Berri is limited but I think we can overcome this by joining “Pete’s party network”. Select some area get a few friends ( or if you are like some of us who have no friends just yourself will do fine ) open a bottle of some suitable liquid refreshment and join the party, you just have to imagine the rest of us are in the next room, oh and try to keep the noise down I don’t want any raucous behavior disturbing the neighbors. That’s about it for now, I’ll get back to you after the party.\n\nCheers Pete.\n\nFrom Alex:\n\nSao Antao is about 140 miles ahead. Its westernmost point is at 02521W so we are already west of it. Once it is abeam, we can, geographically at least, gybeGybe - A sailing term for turning the boat so that the stern passes through the wind.

Would be nice to drop in for a demijohn or two of vinho tinto on The Birthday – but perhaps a project for the future. The course for the Cape of Good Hope will be 166M, distance about 4150 miles, about 35 days at 5 knots. That’s geographically. Meteorologically, while we could sail that course, it will be better to head (perhaps a pooptillionthA very little bit; see also MinipooptillionthA very, very, little bit, and definitely smaller than a pooptillionth, which is even smaller. east of) south to the equator and see what the SE tradesBands of NW and SW winds either side of the equator that blow with more or less constant speed and direction all year. will allow us to do. My waypointA fixed location with specified latitude and longtitude co-ordinates maintained by GPS at 23S 023W is the notional target, at the back of the high and a few degrees east.\n\nFrom Sao Antao, it is about 1025 miles to the equator, so about 9 days away if we can keep moving. We crossed going north on May 3rd at 029 41 39W. The FastnetFastnet Race: 608 mile biennial race from Cowes, UK, Isle of Wight, to the Fastnet Rock off Southern Ireland, finishing in Plymouth. Berrimilla took part in 2005 and 2009. is at 51 22N and Cape Horn is at 56S so we sailed 6442 miles up the Atlantic. We will sail down to about 40S, or about 5482 back down again. Then we really turn for home.\n\nA bit more on the satphone, in case anyone wants to call the old geezerDictionaries define a geezer as an old person, generally an eccentric old man. Its origin likely in the word masquerader (colloquially, guiser) from Middle English gysar. Go figure, as the Americans say. on Friday – be aware that it goes into messagebank after only about 3 rings. Usually we can grab it in that time but not always. If you get messagebank, don’t leave a message – it costs us too much to collect them – just try again in a couple of minutes and someone will be waiting near the phone unless it is in its thunder box. If you get messagebank twice, it probably is, so give up.\n\nI have a small present to get him over the hump, and a few balloons to liven up the messdecks and a card from H & K and a rude one from me.

In the last Daily Bull, the GPS distance was less than the calculated day’s run. If everything is working properly, this should not be possible.

Berrimilla took part in 2005 and 2009. – Pascal Loisin, the guy that beat us in the 2 hander, was 16 hours ahead and would have had a fair tide or slack water across Falmouth Bay over the last 40 miles to the finish – we were headbutting nearly 2 knots most of the way and that was the difference – about 2 miles on corrected time.

We will pass the island tomorrow morning and, Hugh, I’m pretty sure we will see it, blue mist or no. I don’t know whether the islands were inhabited when the Europeans first sighted them, but the first European was almost certainly one of Henry the Navigator’s Captains, who may have been lost or coming back from the other side of the Gulf of Guinea, or, perhaps, using the technique the Portugese developed of running southwards from Cape Blanc until they reached the required latitude and then running eastwards along the latitude until they reached a known spot on the African coast. The identity of the Captain who actually sighted them first, and his report, were probably lost when the Lisbon Archives burnt down in the great fire in, I think, the 1770’s. Not sure of my dates, but the Ming Admiral Cheng Ho was on the East African coast in the early 1400’s and Vasco da Gama would have been there within the next hundred years or so. It would have been an interesting meeting if they had coincided.\n\nWe will try to pick up as much easting as possible from here until we hook into the SE TradesBands of NW and SW winds either side of the equator that blow with more or less constant speed and direction all year. in about 600 miles.

It’s a big chunky hill – small mountain – too murky to describe any further. Later, as we pass through the plume and some reflected sunlight gets through, at about 5 miles, I can see that it is quite high – perhaps 2500-3000 feet, very steep, with a small settlement on a ridge about a third of the way up the western slope. The island is roughly circular, about 5 miles across. The Eastern side might be even steeper from the shape of one of the crags. There’s a small harbour marked on the NW corner but I could only see the steep headland that probably hides and protects it. No signs of cultivation, no boats.

Once a year or so, I sit in front of Michael G’s Field of Vision testing box and have tiny pinpoints of light flashed at me by a computer to check that the blind spot is stable. Michael, out here, I can do an instant FoV – just close the right eye and a lot of stars go out in that rather familiar comma shape that indicates the damage to the left retina. Good fun – and much nicer surroundings! The point being that I am especially conscious of both blind spots, but particularly the big one, as I sit here at the computer. There’s a row of blinking LED’s on the dreaded USB gizmoSome kind of gadget or other, normally infuriating at eye level to my left and if I look down at the keyboard and back up, one or more LED’s sometimes disappear into the blind spot and I have the momentary surge of doubt – did it really go out?

Bum bone?\n\nImperfections #2: The right side of my face is shored up with chicken wire and a handful of titanium screws – the result of the foredeck incident that Hugh talks about (and fixed up by another Michael G, by coincidence as I’ve just realised) – looks good in some dental xrays – and, because the injury distorted the original arrangement, I have an improvised tear duct drilled through a bit of face bone from the inboard end of the eye into the nasal passage. Makes for an interesting sensation when I blow my nose. In the local heat and humidity, I can actually feel all this stuff in my face – not as a painful sensation but I’m conscious that it’s there.

Meanwhile, the old bus shelterExplanation here gets sniffed and watered by all the local mongrels and we carry on fantasising about ocean voyages in our tiny concrete world.\n\nFrom SarahPete Crozier's daughter Crozier\n\nhi pet-eo, happy birthday and happy fathers day and all that jazz. all is good on the home front, not much to report. Do have some good news – Mel had a baby girl called Hannah, at about 10.15pm on friday, same birthday as you, 60 years apart. pretty cool, eh? I went to see them last night, very very cute. any way, hope all is well, take care, see you in 3 months. Have you caught any fish yet?\n\n—\n\nJust before the funeral services, the undertaker came up to the very elderly widow and asked, “”How old was your husband “”98,”” she replied.””Two years older than me.”” “”So you’re 96,”” the undertaker commented. She responded, “”Hardly worth going home is it?””\n\nA 97 year old man goes into his doctor’s office and says, “”Doc, I want my sex drive lowered.”” “”Sir””, replied the doctorGuinness, “”You’re 97. Don’t you think your sex drive is all in your head?”” “”You’re darned right it is!”” replied the old man. “”That’s why I want it lowered!””\n\nAn elderly woman from Brooklyn decided to prepare her will and make her final requests. She told her Rabbi she had two final requests. First, she wanted to be cremated, and second, she wanted her ashes scattered over Bloomingdales. “”Bloomingdales?”” the Rabbi exclaimed. “”Why Bloomingdales?”” “”Then I’ll be sure my daughters visit me twice a week.””\n\nThree old guys are out walking. First one says, “”Windy, isn’t it?”” Second one says, “”No, it’s Thursday!”” Third one says, “”So am I. Let’s go get a beer.””\n\nA man was telling his neighbour, “”I just bought a new hearing aid. It cost me four thousand dollars, but its state of the art. It’s perfect.”” “”Really,”” answered the neighbour. “”What kind is it?”” “”Twelve thirty.””\n\nFrom Jennifer\n\nOptic nerves:\n\nPete, just read your log entry about your eyes and face. Particularly interesting for me because I’m just finishing first year psych and spen the entire year doing experiments with vision and depth perception. That’s the first log I’ve read in a while, although Brian keeps me up to date with what’s happpening.\n\nClear skies and fair winds to you\n\nA bit of a catch up – thanks for the jokes, John H and SarahPete Crozier's daughter; Jen, how does that stuff fit into first year psych? I’ve taken part in lots of those experiments, mostly years ago and mostly for medical students. I hope you two are planning to come across for the Coming Home party.\n\nFrom John C.\n\nThe phone call mentioned in Sitrep: 0900hrs 09 Sep 2005 UTC Ref 342 was me. Very clear from my end but must have been difficult for Pete. I was sitting on the Bateman’s Bay yacht club mariner on my way south. Unfortunately driving – not sailing. Fascinating to think a mobile phone can talk to a bus shelterExplanation here in the mid Atlantic. Keep up the pretence for us land lubbers to dream about. Cheers and good sailing to you both\n\nJohn C, HilaryAlex’s partner and Katherine’s mother told us it must have been you – Pete just missed your name in the static.\n\nFrom Diana H.\n\nSubject: solar storm\n\n.. apprntly major inc in solar flare activty in recent days may affect computer equipment? effectively an electromagnetic pulse that goes on and on? dunno what it does to radios?\n\ntake care\n\nAnd, talking of static, thanks Diana, solar flares really mess up radio propagationIn the logs, this refers to the radiation of signal energy and is customarily qualified by the words abysmal, ratshit or lousy but I don’t think they harm the radio itself.

Have had to print out a few days of The Log (subject to Copyright 2005) to accompany me through the wilds of Warnie’s bowling tonight. Fine sailing to you. Cheers K.\n\nHi Kate – we heard about The Ashes – probably a Good Thing for cricket, tho it hurts. Hope the log was sufficiently interesting to overcome the loss.\n\nFrom Martin Z., Vienna, Austria\n\n“greetings from vancouver, canada and vienna, austria etc” “During my stay at at a medical congress in Vancouver last week I had the opportunity to have an evening party where Michael Giblin, an ophthalmologist from Australia, was present.\n\nWe talked about this and that and also about sailing. I told him that I recently had bought a small sailing boat which I now use for sailing in an Austrian lake close to Vienna.\n\nI told him that this ship type, SHARK 24, was already used to cross the Atlantic.\n\nSo it was not so far that Mr. Giblin told me about your journey and gave me your homepage address.\n\nI take the opportunity to send the best greetings of Mr. Giblin and me and we are looking forward to a good end of your journey.\n\nMichael Z from Vancouver and Vienna – thanks for your good wishes and glad you found us – welcome to the bus shelterExplanation here – a shark in a Vienna lake must frighten the locals a bit perhaps – happy sailing. It must be almost the end of your season – does the lake freeze? Michael G – a Junketeer? Hope you enjoyed it – Vancouver is spectacular. Send us a note when you get back and I’ll write to you.\n\nFrom Malcom RobinsonJoint (Hobart-based) Berri webmaster with Steve Jackson.\n\nHi guys – and very happy belateds to Pete! – keep the beard on Pete, otherwise nobody will believe that you’re 60\n\nWe celebrated Pete’s birthday by taking Wildfire in her first (semi)proper race down to North Bruny. We’re not sure who came second – by the time they got near the line (45 minutes later) we were too far away to see :-)) Total fluke of course – all the others stayed on the eastern shore while we went west and snuck along in our own little zephyr.\n\nI’ve just started watching the South Atlantic high and at the moment it looks really weird\n\n- sausage of high pressure NW to SE\n\n- current centre (1028) is at 45S 010E (SW of Cape Town) with ridge (1024) extending NW to 20S 025W\n\n- Low of 1004 at 35S 005W (W of Cape Town) has a fairly localised influence\n\n- looks like SE winds west of 015W and S winds east of there\n\n- yuk\n\nI been thinking seriously about the S/H and as honoured as I am to have been invited and as much fun as it would have been, have decided to give it a miss this year. There are several reasons but the biggy is that I reckon that I’ve had my turns and I’d love to see Catherine and/or Stephen have a go this time. I’m also really looking forward to coming out and meeting you and getting photos of you as you round Tasman Island.\n\nAnd irrespective of that, I’ll also come and say g’day as you go past Tassie on your way home, no matter which end of the island you decide to go past! Sail safely guys!\n\nMal, you’ll have to sandbag a bit – remember Dennis Conner? – so they don’t mess with your handicap. Sounds good – next stop LHILord Howe Island. LHI is situated 700 kilometres north east of Sydney. A race to from Gosford to LHI takes place every October and Berrimilla has taken part for several years - obviously not in 2005! lagoon? We’ll miss you on the S2HSydney-Hobart Race: often described as the most gruelling ocean race in the world, this annual race starts on 26th December from Sydney Harbour and ends in Hobart. The course is 628 nautical miles.. Thanks re SA high – we also have our own Oracle who has clocked in again, so with the 2 of you on side, we should crack it. If there happens to be a good ISSInternational Space Station pass any time, it’s pretty cloudless here at the mo – but don’t bother with regular updates – i don’t think they will talk to us again, but it’s nice to know they are up there. I think we may be closer to Africa than them at the mo.\n\nAnd Malcom did the numbers – seems we’ve crossed over a million primary wave crests since Sydney and we’ve only got 785455 to go 785454 785453…zzzz We could put numbers on the 2 Most Significant Waves, I suppose.\n\nFrom Roger W.\n\nSimon & I will get your application for entry in; once that’s accepted it will be the entry itself, which we will also handle. The application requires 50% of crew for crew experience so I have included John Van O, no probs if you have to change later. I will keep my eye on entry dates etc.\n\nRoger and Simon, many thanks – I’ll write separately.\n\nSqueeze the bag time – must keep up the fluids. Is S.W. Bag still out there Steve?\n\nG’day to the kids at BelmoreSydney School corresponding with Berri SouthSydney School corresponding with Berri Primary\n\n[from Alex] To 5/6 P and 5/6 S Hi from Pete and Alex in Berrimilla. This is Alex writing – Pete will have a go later, when he wakes up (we have to take it in turns to sleep) Its really good to know you’re out there. We are about 400 nautical miles off the coast of Guinea-Bissau in West Africa and it’s the middle of the night as I write. It’s hot and even this far out, I can smell the land – don’t know what the smell is but it’s there. Car fumes, dog poo, rotting leaves, the scent of flowers just like Sydney, I expect. The sea water is about as warm as an indoor pool in Sydney and it’s really sweaty even now at night. The Atlantic here is about 6 kilometres deep and it’s a funny feeling to be on top of that much water. There were dolphins all around us earlier – we could here them surfacing and snorting as they breathe and they make lovely phosphorescent trails in the water. Our actual position at this moment is 09 degrees 18 minutes North, 023 degrees 17 minutes West, which puts us 557 nautical miles north of the equator.\n\nWe’re in the Inter Tropical Convergence ZoneInter Tropical Convergence Zone, also known as The Doldrums or ITCZInter Tropical Convergence ZoneInter Tropical Convergence Zone, also known as The Doldrums, also known as The DoldrumsInter Tropical Convergence ZoneInter Tropical Convergence Zone, also known as The Doldrums, also known as The Doldrums which is just a fancy name for what old sailors used to call The DoldrumsInter Tropical Convergence ZoneInter Tropical Convergence Zone, also known as The Doldrums, also known as The Doldrums and where they hated going because there is never much wind and it’s always hot and unpleasant and they could be stuck here for weeks. We’re lucky because we have an engine so we can still move even when there’s no wind. The ITCZInter Tropical Convergence ZoneInter Tropical Convergence Zone, also known as The Doldrums, also known as The DoldrumsInter Tropical Convergence ZoneInter Tropical Convergence Zone, also known as The Doldrums, also known as The Doldrums is where the very hot air that moves around the earth on either side of the equator mixes with the cooler air coming down from the north. Because the air masses are moving in slightly different directions there are big swirls where the two masses mix – just like when cigarette smoke rises in the air – and these swirls, called tropical waves, sometimes go on to become tropical hurricanes like Katrina.\n\nSteve or Mal, any chance you could put up a link to relevant bit of the wind chart on one of the weather sites?\n\n[like this?]\n\nThat’s probably enough guff from me – we’d really like to hear from you if you would like to write to us with your news or questions. There’s not much happening out here and and it would give us something interesting to do.\n\nBest wishes to you all from\n\nAlex\n\n[from Pete]\n\nHi kids Pete here, it was good to learn that you are interested in what we are doing on the other side of the world.\n\nI’ve been on watch for about one and a half hours now, I didn’t get much sleep in my 3 hours off, probably because I went to bed all hot and sweaty. Just before Alex took over we had to pull down the big spinnaker sail which had been slowly hauling us across the water in very little wind. Putting everything away after we drop this sail takes some time and running around the rolling deck in the dark to do this work makes you very hot. I should have stayed on deck and cooled off before going below as it’s very hot in the cabin with the engine running, too late to worry about that now I’ll try to catch up on my sleep later.\n\nAbout half an hour ago the sun came up at about 7.30 am. UTC. This means that the sun was going down in Sydney at about this time, perhaps you could work out for me what time sunrise and sunset are in Sydney using UTC timeCo-ordinated Univeral Time, formerly Greenwich Mean Time. UTC (sometimes known as Zulu time) uses precise atomic clocks, shortwave time signals and satellites to ensure it remains a totally reliable and accurate standard for scientific and navigational purposes. (UTC used to be known as Greenwich Mean Time). I couldn’t see the sun till it was about 5 degrees above the horizon due to the heavy haze over the water. Time gets a little complicated when you’re at sea. We have to keep our watches on UTC because all our information (weather etc.) is transmitted at certain times during the day in UTC timeCo-ordinated Univeral Time, formerly Greenwich Mean Time. UTC (sometimes known as Zulu time) uses precise atomic clocks, shortwave time signals and satellites to ensure it remains a totally reliable and accurate standard for scientific and navigational purposes.. At the moment local time and UTC are about one and a half to two hours apart which is ok but once we get past the bottom of Africa and start sailing due east the two time frames start to separate quickly and you end up having your breakfast with your watch saying it’s midnight.\n\nSorry if I’ve been waffling on about this time problem but I think it’s important. With international communications so easy these days via the internet business is going on 24 hours a day and that’s the way of the future.\n\nI just went out to see if there were any ships about and there was this pure white ( except for its black tail feathers ) bird,circling around the boat. Sometimes they hitch a ride on the boat for a few hours and have a rest. We have not seen that many birds recently, it will be good to get further south where once again we will meet up with the big beautiful albatross. Did you know that they sleep while flying, how efficient is that bird.\n\nCheers for now, hope to hear from you soon…….Pete.\n\nps. I’ve just been up on deck again and that bird did stop for a rest, it was up on the bow of the boat. Had a good look at it this time, it has long thin legs like a shallow water feeder. It also has a long orange coloured beak and the top of its head is an orange colour.\n\n1030hrs 13 Sep 2005 UTC 09’01”N 023’10”W Ref 357\n\nDB: 96, 10603 (gps 99) Slow, but we’re creeping south out of the ITCZInter Tropical Convergence ZoneInter Tropical Convergence Zone, also known as The Doldrums, also known as The DoldrumsInter Tropical Convergence ZoneInter Tropical Convergence Zone, also known as The Doldrums, also known as The Doldrums so it’s progress.\n\nApologies – it should have been Martin, not Michael Z. from Vienna in my last note – good sailing Martin.\n\nBack with the tractorThe engine - as in “running the tractor”. The Kubota engine by WitchardWitchard, John: Berri has one of his 22hp engines, much praised for its reliability. See also Tractor. Marine was described by Alex as being “made of tractor parts, not expensive marine parts”. – just transferred fuel from Jerries into tank – very messy business and hot and sweaty too. We’re both pretty cheesy – same clothes for days, but you don’t seem to get really smelly – just that sensual Havarti/ Gorgonzola/ Roquefort/ Parmesan whiff around the pits and crutch every now and again. Clothes permanently damp – no point whatever in changing them because in 10 minutes, the next lot will be just as bad. I rinse mine in fresh water every ten days or so and I’ve got two sets going – one ready for use and one cheesy. The water goes an interesting colour – maybe one for Kim or Jude to analyse?\n\nWe have a lovely visitor – an Egret or Heron – about 30 cm high, sturdy legs with huge four toed feet with big claws, wider that its body, a beigey gold crest and with a touch of the same colour on its breast feathers, golden beak, about 4-5 cm long, bright golden irises with brown rings around the edges and brown pupils and the brightest snowy white feathers. It stands on the foredeck and flies off if we approach but doesn’t go far and returns. We’ve put water up there, but it seems to be a very long way from home and sadly, I don’t like it’s chances of finding its way back. It can only stay with us until we start sailing to windward again, so it will get a rest anyway. Looks like one of those birds that walk on water-lily leaves and catch tiny fish.\n\n1530hrs 13 Sep 2005 UTC 08’48”N 023’03”W Ref 358\n\nA Snowy Egret perhaps? – it is very firmly still with us and seems to be getting used to having us around – it just flies from one end of the boat to the other as we do sail changes (we’ve had the assyAsymetric spinnaker up and down twice and the #1 once since this morning – hot and dripping work and ones eyes start to get filled with sweat and sting). It drinks water from a dogbowl, but doesn’t seem to go for biscuits. It would probably prefer something slimy – a worm or a snail or small fish and insects. All of which we ain’t got – anyone have any suggestions? Perhaps dissolve biscuits in the water bowl? Boot feralsInteresting biological colonies that grow and fester in seaboots.

Amazing Egret has stood on the foredeck under tacking #1 – has real sea legs and just sways with the boat’s motion on those huge feet.

It’s like that awful time in a marathon – usually hits me at about 12k – where I think I feel dreadful, want to stop, go home, anything but run another 30k. So I have to tell myself that I started so I’ve got to finish and anyway what’s wrong with a bit of pain and perseverance – it will end eventually. And it does.

I won’t make comments about what it is doing with you two. So, you are right that it needs a diet of insects and worms. What is it doing where there are no cattle of the four-legged kind?

Cattle egrets do cross the Atlantic from Africa to South America on rare occasions, although normally they are happier among the lowing herds.\n\n0915hrs 15 Sep 2005 UTC 06’34”N 022’08”W Ref 364\n\nHave just spoken to Steve after one of the worst nights ever in my sailing career.

We are surrounded by big storm clouds and heavy rain and it’s hot and sweaty even at night. We have just started to get a steady wind from the south, so we are hoping that we can sail over towards Brazil and then down the coast of South America. We are heading to pass close to a tiny island called TrindadeTrindade and Martim Vaz is an archipelago located about 1,200 kilometers (740 mi) east of Vitória in the Southern Atlantic Ocean, belonging to Brazil.

We are going to be sailing towards Australia for another 90 days or so. We send these emails over a high frequency radio – a bit stone age these days with satellite phones and other high tech goodies, but it works. Unfortunately, we can’t send photos. Probably just as well – we’re not the prettiest – I’ve worn the same clothes for 10 days now and they are damp and cheesy, but it saves water if we don’t wash them.

I think what you’re doing is sensational and I wish I was doing one of the legs with you both. I’m a composer and conductor and also run a music publishing company. My main hobby was flying for the past 25 years or so but I did my yachting exams at night school a few years ago just to keep learning something new. Last year my partner Lyn (Kiwi) and I bought a 36′ Legend at the boat show, enlisted the help of Tom Wilkinson, a well known RYARoyal Yachting Association.

On the morning Tom arrived it was blowing a hooley and he asked if we still wanted to do it, of course we did and 5 days later, after going through hail, rain, thunder, heaving toSetting the boat so that it lies roughly parallel to the waves and at right angles to the wind and moves slowly forwards. This movement is known as ‘fore-reaching’ and is usually achieved by backing the jib, freeing or lowering the mainsail and lashing the helm to leeward. It is often an effective way of slowing everything down and sitting out bad weather but some boats will not heave to because of their underwater shape or other factors and must be sailed out of trouble. Heaving-to is not the same as lying a-hull where all sail is dropped and the boat is left more or less to its own devices. off Felixstowe because we lost the engine and had a jam with the Jib we were handed our bit of paper and went straight back out. We sailed all through last winter, loved it, no one around and made masses of mistakes but learned as we went on. Our passages are now as far as Ramsgate which is pathetic compared to you two but we don’t take crew and work as a team. Next year we’ll get across the channel and I’d like to think keep heading south for ever.\n\nWe’re both now dreaming of the time when we can hopefully sell our companies and follow your path, (Lyn is a film producer with all the stresses that that brings).\n\nThank you both for the inspiration, you’re doing what lot’s of us want to do and I just can’t imagine, after sailing for the past year, how you get all the skills you both must have to do the passages that you’ve done, I’m full of admiration for you.\n\nIf you’re able to get onto web sites and like music go on to www.northstarmusic.co.uk – this division of the company sells relaxation music, if there are any titles that take your fancy let me know your next port of call and I’ll send, they may just calm the passage to Hobart a little next time.\n\nGrahame Mac thanks for your note of some days ago – you have clearly worked out that you have to make these things happen. Best of luck with the channel crossing and please feel free if there’s anything we can do to help as you and Lyn move on to bigger things. Thanks to for offer of music – we can’t get the internet and don’t intend to stop anyway so won’t be able to take you up.\n\nWe’ve had a wearying few days but we seem to be south of the nasties and pointing more or less at the hump of Brazil instead of the Amazon. We hope that we will be lifted around to head for Trinidade as we move south.\n\nOur difficulties were capped by some unintended man overboard practice yesterday. We’d just finished one of the many headsail changes and put in a reef-- As a verb – to shorten sail, to use reefing lines or other techniques to make the working part of a sail smaller and so reduce its power as the wind rises. --- As a noun, (1) the part of the sail that has been shortened, folded or rolled.

The boat parked beam on with the sails feathered – essentially hove to – and I pulled him in on the line. At which point it became clear just how hard it is to get someone heavy, wet and slippery back into a tossing heaving boat. We managed – Pete has a big graze on his shin but otherwise undamaged and we’re both much wiser and less complacent.
