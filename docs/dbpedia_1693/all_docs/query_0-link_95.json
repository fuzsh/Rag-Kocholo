        "text": "Lessons from Ancient Greece: üåøPublic Speaking. This is a 'clepsydra' - a water clock. It was used to time the public speeches in ancient Athena's Law Court. ‚åõ The speaker must make the case by the time the upper vessels empties into the lower vessel. ‚åõ This means 6 minutes! Only 6 minutes to say everything important, and deliver it in a compelling way. ‚åõ This is an actual water clock which was used in the Athenian Agora, 26 centuries ago. It has an inscription: ‚ÄúŒëŒùŒ§ŒôŒü...\" (it belonged to the Antiochis people) and its capacity, 2 choes = 6.4 litres (the duration of the speaking slot). I have attended so many events where the speakers completely ignore the assigned time slot. 10 minutes become 20, and 30... Consequently, one of the following happens: ‚è± The next speakers are cut short, or ‚è± The networking break is reduced, or ‚è± The event is awfully late, and people leave way before the closing notes. In all cases, the audience loses. A piece of advice to all public speaker, which comes from ancient Athens... and from my TEDx coaching experience: Rehearse! Yes, rehearse! Make sure your talk is informative, compelling, and will finish on time. You owe it to your audience! #publicspeaking #culturematters #historylessons\n\n\"Remember the Kenyan runner Abel Mutai who was just a few feet from the finish line, but became confused with the signage and stopped, thinking he had completed the race. A Spanish runner, Ivan Fernandez, was right behind him and, realizing what was happening, started shouting at the Kenyan to continue running. Mutai didn't know Spanish and didn't understand. Realizing what was taking place, Fernandez pushed Mutai to victory. A journalist asked Ivan, \"Why did you do that?\" Ivan replied, \"My dream is that someday we can have a kind of community life where we push and help each other to win.\" The journalist insisted, \"But why did you let the Kenyan win?\" Ivan replied, \"I didn't let him win, he was going to win. The race was his.\" The journalist insisted again, \"But you could have won!\" Ivan looked at him and replied, \"But what would be the merit of my victory? What would be the honor in that medal? What would my mother think of that?\" Values are part of our life, the expression is all over including the professional world. Let‚Äôs aim to create a world where we value our teams, our professions, our work ethics as well. Together we can create a world of happiness. Because honesty and ethics are winning!\" #workethics #values #team #sucess #teambuilding #mindset #coaching This incident happened on 02 Dec 2012 in at cross-country race Spain.\n\nCroatians love their unique traditions, art, and customs, so folklore plays a vital role in Croatia‚Äôs cultural heritage. üá≠üá∑ If you have ever met a Croatian, you know how proud they are about their way of life. Through folklore, Croatians connect with their ancestors and the way of life they once knew. When you learn folklore dances and songs or read about them, you get an insight into people‚Äôs daily lives in the past, creating a unique connection between the past and the present.
