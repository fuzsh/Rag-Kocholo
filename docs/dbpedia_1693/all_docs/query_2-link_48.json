        "text": "Book Summary\n\nA dazzling new novel of friendship and redemption in the face of tragedy and loss set in 1980s Chicago and contemporary Paris, by the acclaimed and award-winning author Rebecca Makkai.\n\nIn 1985, Yale Tishman, the development director for an art gallery in Chicago, is about to pull off an amazing coup, bringing in an extraordinary collection of 1920s paintings as a gift to the gallery. Yet as his career begins to flourish, the carnage of the AIDS epidemic grows around him. One by one, his friends are dying and after his friend Nico's funeral, the virus circles closer and closer to Yale himself. Soon the only person he has left is Fiona, Nico's little sister.\n\nThirty years later, Fiona is in Paris tracking down her estranged daughter who disappeared into a cult. While staying with an old friend, a famous photographer who documented the Chicago crisis, she finds herself finally grappling with the devastating ways AIDS affected her life and her relationship with her daughter. The two intertwining stories take us through the heartbreak of the eighties and the chaos of the modern world, as both Yale and Fiona struggle to find goodness in the midst of disaster.\n\nMedia Reviews\n\nBookBrowse Review\n\n\"Unfortunately, I found The Great Believers hard going. While I enjoyed the 1980s strand, there's a near-contemporary story-line that's not compelling; additionally, there are a lot of secondary characters we don't get to know very well and the details of Yale's art deal slows down the narrative.\" - Rebecca Foster, BookBrowse\n\nOther Reviews\n\n\"Starred Review. Another ambitious change of pace for the versatile and accomplished [Rebecca] Makkai . her rich portraits of an array of big personalities and her affecting depiction of random, horrific death faced with varying degrees of gallantry make this tender, keening novel an impressive act of imaginative empathy. As compulsively readable as it is thoughtful and moving: an unbeatable fictional combination.\" - Kirkus\n\n\"Starred Review. A tribute to the enduring forces of love and art, over everything.\" - Booklist\n\n\"Starred Review. This novel will undoubtedly touch the hearts and minds of readers.\" - Publishers Weekly\n\n\"Makkai's sweeping fourth novel (after Music for Wartime) shows the compassion of chosen families and the tension and distance that can exist in our birth ones. This should strike a chord with the Gen Xers who came of age, and then aged, in these tumultuous years.\" - Library Journal\n\n\"Stirring, spellbinding and full of life.\" - TÃ©a Obreht, New York Times bestselling author of The Tiger's Wife\n\n\"Makkai has created a moving story about Chicago and Paris, the past and present, the young men lost to AIDS and the ones who survived. And just as her novel evokes art's power to commemorate the departed, The Great Believers is itself a poignant work of memory.\" - Viet Thanh Nguyen, Pulitzer-prize winning author of The Sympathizer\n\n\"The Great Believers is by turns funny, harrowing, tender, devastating, and always hugely suspenseful. It reminds us, poignantly, of how many people, mostly young, often brilliant, were lost to the AIDS epidemic, and of how those who survived were marked by that struggle. This is Rebecca Makkai at the height of her powers.\" - Margot Livesey, New York Times bestselling author of Mercury\n\nThis information about The Great Believers was first featured in \"The BookBrowse Review\" - BookBrowse's membership magazine, and in our weekly \"Publishing This Week\" newsletter.
