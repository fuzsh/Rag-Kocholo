        "text": "Memory is not my strength per se. However, when it comes to emotion, feeling and personal meaning, it becomes much stronger and, of course, I know Clynx‚Äôs pitch pretty much by üíô When I need to significantly adapt my pitch, either in terms of length, context or framing, I try to train it at least a couple times and some of my favorite tricks are: ‚ö°Ô∏èrecording it on #voice while preparing the text - I basically record the first script sketch and listen to it on my walks. While walking, I am not actively training but I do not have distractions and I am particularly critical to improve the text, so it both helps memorizing and refining the message. ‚ö°Ô∏èrecording it on #video while preparing delivery of the pitch - to watch my expressions/movements as I talk! I will admit: not always I analyze it as much as I should, but it still forces me to be aware of the importance of the physical behavior (from posture, to gestures and use of space) during the speech. On #pitch‚Äôs mornings, my phone‚Äôs camera roll becomes even funnier, as I train 2 to 3 times - in between the moment I wake up until I get my makeup and am fully ready to be at the stage üòÖ When I leave the house, I suddenly do not want to review any of the text, audios or videos. Then, nothing is more important than focusing on being relaxed and confident to deliver our message. A couple weeks ago I was in Madrid üá™üá∏for the final of Cuatrecasas Acelera and the pitch required a few twists. The biggest challenge was the fact that everyone in the room would pitch in Spanish. I considered trying to as well, but realized it would make no sense. So I went for the English version of our pitch, but not before giving everyone a good laugh as I used my spanish for the first 15 seconds! üìå The pitch‚Äôs video was recorded and is made available by Cuatrecasas, feel free to reach out to me to access it. üí¨ As I finished, I received a whatsapp from Nancy Brito who was in the audience watching the pitches and texted me ‚ÄúExcellent! üòä‚Äù. Nancy is Clynx‚Äôs business mentor and I know she is one of those strong #businessWomen who are not easy to impress, so it made me especially proud! Thank you also to our legal mentors Joana Silveira Botelho, S√≥nia Queiroz Vaz and to everyone making this program happen, for giving us the opportunity to grow and give our first steps towards digital #Physiotherapy in #Espa√±a!"
