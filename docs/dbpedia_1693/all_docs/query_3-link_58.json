        "text": "Confederation of Student Services PI This project aims to understand the impact that differing student support services have on the transition and retention of students entering two institutions through alternative entry routes. In phase one of the project the Trinity Access Programmes, and Maynooth Access programme, will partner to establish, in a systematic way, the support structures available to students who progress into University through alternative access routes; creating an exhaustive list of what is offered across the academic, social, financial and personal spheres. The access offices, through a facilitated research session, will develop together a report which specifies the suite of supports available and information on what is considered best practice across the institutions. In phase two of the project the student groups in both institutions who have entered through these alternative entry routes will be surveyed about their experiences with the support services and their sense of belonging in the institution, as an indicator of transition, will be established alongside their indicative retention rate. Twenty students will be randomly sampled from both and invited to participate in small focus groups, to explore their 'lived' experiences of the support structures and how these experiences interact with belongingness and retention. In phase three of the project the data from student and staff will be compiled to produce a short report on the lived experiences of these students and their views on how the support services in the HEIs impact upon their transition and retention. It is the aim of the project to establish the processes which support students in differing institutions and to share this information within the CSSI network and nationally. 06/08/2018 31/01/2019 2000 An international examination of the impact that different access routes to higher education have on student capability to participate PI A higher education qualification has never been more important. For low socio-economic status students higher education participation is implicated in upward social mobility and the alleviation of poverty (Keane, 2016; HEA, 2015). Over the last 20 years Irish policy makers have taken positive steps to widen the participation rates of these students; including providing extra school provision where needed and supporting the development of national and institutional access routes into higher education. To-date, evaluations of these activities have varied greatly (HEFCE 2013; Keane 2011), which means there is not currently a coherent evidence base to draw on in the development of policy The current research will develop a systematic evaluation of the differing access routes into higher education. It aims to establish the key variables that support students’ capability to participate in higher education. This research will perform an international comparison of the experiences and outcomes of students participating in a Irish and UK Foundation Course for higher education, with students who have entered university through the Higher Education Access Route (HEAR). The overarching objective is to strengthen the existing evidence base through systematically evaluating the impact that differing access routes to higher education have on students’ capability to participate in higher education. It is envisioned that this work will contribute to national policy on equity of access, through the identification of practices that support student aspiration, development, performance and retention. 09/01/2017 09/07/2019 73434"
