        "text": "To ensure an applicant tracking system reads content on the right side of your résumé and does not assume you created a column, use the \"right tab stop”. This also ensures your locations and dates are aligned perfectly.\n\nYou adjust the position of tab stops in Microsoft Word using the ruler section at the top of the page. The ruler section is the series of vertical lines and numbers running across the top. The tab stop icon at the top left of the window displays the symbol for a left tab (L) by default. If you cannot see the ruler, go to the \"View\" tab at the top of the screen and click the check box beside \"Ruler\" in the \"Show/Hide\" group.\n\nWhen you click the tab stop icon at the top left of a document, it cycles through the available tab stop options. They are the left tab, center tab for text centered around the tab stop, right tab for text that's right aligned and extends to the left, decimal tab that aligns the position of a decimal point, and the bar tab, which inserts a vertical bar at the position of the tab marker.\n\nClick the tab stop icon at the top left of the window just below the ribbon and select the right tab (backward L). Then, click the ruler where you want the right-align tab to be placed (ideally on the right margin). Then use tab to move the content you want right aligned over to the right margin."
