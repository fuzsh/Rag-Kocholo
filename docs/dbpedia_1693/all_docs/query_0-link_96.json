To achieve the SDGs, governments, private sector and civil society must work together. The UN is actively driving global discussions on how to harness the power of the data revolution to achieve this ambitious agenda. The work of the UN includes providing food and assistance to 80 million people, supplying vaccines to 45% of the world's children and assisting 65 million people fleeing war, famine and persecution. In this talk, UN Global Pulse will present applications of social data and other big data sources for sustainable development and humanitarian action. Examples of innovation projects will include: using social media to understand perceptions on refugees; using mobile data to map population movement in the aftermath of natural disasters; understanding recovery from shocks with financial transaction data; using satellite data to inform humanitarian operations in conflict zones or monitoring public radio to give voice to citizens in unconnected areas. Based on these examples, the session will discuss open challenges and opportunities for the research community to ensure that academic work can be translated into social impact. With the big data and the AI revolution, it is time to propose a shift to a rights-based approach to research and innovation.\n\n10:15 - 10:30 AM\n\nCoffee Break\n\n10:30 - 11:45 AM\n\nPaper Session VI: Sociology of Hate\n\nAbuSniff: Automatic Detection and Defenses Against Abusive Facebook Friends\n\nSajedul Talukder, Bogdan Carbunar\n\nThe Effect of Extremist Violence on Hateful Speech Online\n\nAlexandra Olteanu, Carlos Castillo, Jeremy Boy, Kush R.

As the community matures into its second decade, it is a good time to reflect on how that abundance has shaped our scholarship. This talk will examine what is missing when we focus on social media data generated by clicks and posts. Using experience sampling and eye-tracking methods, we are learning about people's internal states when they use social media, including how people feel when they post to social media, what they decide to share when posts are ephemeral, how they pay attention to other users' profiles, and what they pay attention to but do not click on. This talk will critically examine popular theories about social media use and will explore emerging research opportunities.\n\n9:30 - 10:06 AM\n\nPaper Session IX: Best Papers\n\n\"I'm Never Happy with What I Write\": Challenges and Strategies of People with Dyslexia on Social Media\n\nLindsay Reynolds, Shaomei Wu\n\nThe Tower of Babel.jpg: Diversity of Visual Encyclopedic Knowledge Across Wikipedia Language Editions\n\nShiqing He, Allen Yilun Lin, Eytan Adar, Brent Hecht\n\n10:06 - 10:30 AM\n\nCoffee Break\n\n10:30 AM - 11:45 PM\n\nPaper Session X: Health\n\nUsing Longitudinal Social Media Analysis to Understand the Effects of Early College Alcohol Use\n\nEmre Kiciman, Scott Counts, Melissa Gasser\n\nA Social Media Based Examination of the Effects of Counseling Recommendations After Student Deaths on College Campuses\n\nKoustuv Saha, Ingmar Weber, Munmun De Choudhury\n\nThe Impact of Recipe Features, Social Cues and Demographics on Estimating the Healthiness of Online Recipes\n\nMarkus Rokicki, Christoph Trattner, Eelco Herder\n\nCharacterizing Audience Engagement and Assessing its Impact on Social Media Disclosures of Mental Illnesses\n\nSindhu Kiranmai Ernala, Tristan Labetoulle, Fred Bane, Michael L.
