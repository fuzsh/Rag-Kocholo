The conference general chair was Jeff Hancock. The conference program cochairs were Kate Starbird and Ingmar Weber. The conference was sponsored by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.\n\nThe social and community-driven aspects of our digital lives continue to rapidly increase, resulting in transformative behaviors and, significantly, publishing and distributing huge amounts of fascinating data. The International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media provides an intellectual hub and a stimulating and inspiring environment for researchers in the computational social sciences who are interested in exploring social phenomena with algorithmic methods and new kinds of data. ICWSM-18 met at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California USA. The conference received a total of 295 full paper submissions, out of which 48 were accepted for oral presentation and 30 were accepted as posters, resulting in a full paper acceptance rate of 16 percent. In addition to the full papers, ICWSM-18 also received 18 data set papers (10 accepted), 71 poster papers (18 accepted), and 10 demo submissions (3 accepted)."
