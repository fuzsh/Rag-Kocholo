        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nThe SARS-COV2 Coronavirus (COVID-19) disease quickly reached a pandemic level1 with 82.100.010 million global cases and 1.793.150 deaths by December 30th, 2020.2 In Brazil, the first COVID-19 patient was diagnosed on February 26th, 2020.3 Brazil is a large country with a 210 million population,4 divided into five large regions: Southeast, Northeast, South, North, and Central- West with respectively 42.04%, 27.09%, 14.26%, 8.83%, and 7.79% of the total population and significant variation in socio-economic status and access to health care.5 In the Northeast, 51% of the population receive less than a minimum wage montly while in Southeast it is only 18%. Regarding access to heathcare, the percentages of population that have a private health insurance plan are: In the Southeast: 37.5%, Northeast: 16.6%, South: 32.8%, North: 14.7%, and Central-West: 28.9%.6\n\nDiabetes is the second most prevalent comorbidity in COVID-19 patients7 and individuals with suboptimal glycemic control and diabetes complications are more likely to develop severe forms of infection by SARS-COV2.8., 9. Diabetes is a significant public health concern in Brazil. Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is increasing by almost 3% every year. Brazil ranks third in the number of T1D cases in the world.10\n\nIn order to keep glycemic control, people with T1D (PWT1D) need to follow many steps to control their glucose levels. This involves strict insulin adjustment according to food intake, physical exercise, and the presence of infections or other medical conditions.11 The complexity of T1D requirements is extremely stressful12., 13 and any disruption that affects T1D management routines can be even more challenging.14\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic brought a profound and rapid change in people's lives in Brazil.15 It added several new challenges to PWT1D regarding availability of diabetes care, access to medications, supplies, healthy food, safe places to exercise, and mental health support. Many Brazilian hospitals were overwhelmed and cancelled their routine appointments. Quarantine, social isolation, and persons' fear to visit diabetes facilities also negatively affected diabetes outcomes.15., 16., 17.\n\nQuarantine mobility restrictions, lack of access to space for physical activity, and working at home are often associated with changes in eating, drinking, and sleeping habits that can affect glycemic levels. The pandemic triggered a higher level of stress related to social isolation, loss of loved ones, unemployment, and changes in daily routine.18., 19., 20., 21., 22., 23. Stressful situations, financial problems, and loneliness are well-known aspects associated with anxiety disorders, depression, suicide attempts, and substance abuse.24 Literature shows that people affected by life-threatening situations are at higher risks of developing psychological and psychiatric disorders.24\n\nDepressive symptoms (DS), diabetes burnout (DB), and diabetes distress (DD) are very frequent among PWT1D13, 25, 26., 27. and they are related to difficulties in diabetes self-management and suboptimal glycemic control.13, 25, 27., 28. Psychological aspects and psychiatric comorbidities related to T1D negatively impact diabetes management and screening for them is highly recommended, especially at diagnosis, when treatment is changed, and when there is a modification in the individuals' lifestyle.29 Therefore, screening DS, DB, and DD among PWT1D is an important goal during such a disruptive event like the COVID-19 pandemic scenario. As there is no Brazilian national data in T1D and mental health aspects using reliable instruments, this study aims to 1- measure DB, DD, and DS levels among adults with T1D during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, and 2- evaluate which COVID-19 associated changes, sociodemographic characteristics, and diabetes outcomes are related to DB, DD, and DS.\n\n5. Discussion\n\nThe current study demonstrated that levels of DB, DD, and depressive symptoms in all Brazilian regions were relatively high during the first months of the COVID- 19 pandemic. There was no difference in DD and DS levels among different regions. Differently, DB levels were higher in participants from the CW/N/NE region. Perceived burnout was reported as moderate or high for a great part of the study participants (32.3% in CW/North/Northeast; 30.9% in Southeast, and 25% in South). The mean DD during the pandemic was higher than 2, which indicates a clinically meaningful DD.34 DD levels were moderate or high in approximately one-third of participants (30.8%) in this current study, compared to 57.0% in Iran, and 13.4% in the USA.37 In Denmark, at the beginning of the pandemic, the levels of DD were 25%, but this study included both T1D and T2D participants.38\n\nMore than 50% of PWT1D reported moderate-severe or severe DS in this current study. In the South region, the difficulty of accessing diabetes supplies predicts the depressive symptoms scores. Prior to the pandemic, Brazilian data have documented a DS frequency of 34.9%.27 Studies have shown that DS levels in PWT1D range from 3.8% to 35% before the COVID-19 pandemic.13, 25, 27.\n\nProbably, differences in DD and DS levels among PWT1D from different countries can be accounted for differences in socioeconomic status, access to technology, diabetes education, and health support that facilitate diabetes management, since in populations from low and middle income countries DD, and DS levels were substantially higher.27., 37.\n\nA substantial number of the study participants experienced negative changes in diabetes care (CW/N/NE: 39.0%, Southeast: 38.8%, South: 48.9%), and difficulty accessing diabetes supplies and medications (CW/N/NE: 34.8%, Southeast: 39.2%, South: 31.1%, respectively). The literature has shown that the initial Brazilian plan to protect individuals living with diabetes has not covered the majority of the population.14 The strategy to distribute medical supplies and medications for 90 days, recommended by institutions was effective for only 21% of the 64.5% of the population who received their medications and supplies from SUS, the Brazilian Unified Heath System, a public healthcare system providing primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare for the population.14\n\nAlmost 75% of PWT1D in Brazil received their care from SUS.39 This population depends on governmental politics and investments to access diabetes care, including health care professionals, diabetes education, supplies, and medicines. Unfortunately, SUS was not able to respond appropriately to the COVID-19 pandemic and most of this vulnerable population had their diabetes care hampered.14 Also, Brazil had a broad range of political issues during the pandemic, with a lack of unified health decisions throughout the country, which prevented authorities from taking measures aligned with the global recommendations.3., 40.\n\nThis current study revealed that 12% of people reported fear of losing insurance during the pandemic, which could overload public services even more if it had occurred. The percentages of the population that have a private insurance plan, prior to the pandemic are small among the Brazilian regions (Southeast: 37.5%, Northeast: 16.6%, South: 32.8%, North: 14.7%, and Central-West: 28.9%).6 Therefore, the economic issues caused by the pandemic could increase the challenges to underserved populations.\n\nMost of the study participants avoided visiting diabetes facilities due to the fear of being infected by COVID-19 (70.3% in CW/North/NE, 67.4% in Southeast, and 82.2% in South). Previous data demonstrated that almost 40% of diabetes patients had their medical appointments cancelled or postponed.16 Fortunately, the Brazilian responsible agency regulated telemedicine in the country during the pandemic, which facilitated remote medical appointments. However, not all patients and health care professionals were familiar with this system. This new reality has been challenging for many patients including the elderly, those with little education, and low-income populations.\n\nPrivate initiatives, such as those from Juvenile Diabetes Association-(ADJ), an institution that offered remote emergency support for patients to make insulin adjustments during the pandemic were a very important resource for many PWT1D.41\n\nOur results demonstrated that T1D specific subgroups had even more risks of experiencing worse psychosocial outcomes. Females with lower income and higher Hb1Ac had increased levels of DB. Regarding DD, the T1D male participants without a partner had a higher odds ratio of experiencing high levels of distress. For each 1% increase in HbA1c there was a raise in almost 40% the chances of experiencing clinically meaningful DD. When it comes to DS, HbA1c was a strong predictor of high depressive levels in this current study.\n\nWe suggest that subgroups identified as at higher risk for worse psychosocial outcomes should have priority in emotional support and behavioral interventions. The levels of DB, DD, and DS in PWT1D can be used as parameters for psychosocial support and psychological and psychiatric referral when necessary. We also encourage action planning for assistance and guidance on safe places to exercise as well as an effective plan to make it easier for individuals to access diabetes supplies.\n\nThe literature has demonstrated the impact of the emotional burden of diabetes self-management and glycemic control.13, 25, 27. The current study demonstrated that T1D individuals with higher HbA1c experienced high DB, DD, and DS levels in most of the Brazilian regions. This reinforces the need for strategies to mitigate and treat mental health conditions and improve glycemic control in PWT1D in Brazil.\n\nThe small number of T1D people who meet recommended glycemic targets is a hard reality in Brazil.42 In addition, there is a lack of structured educational programs as Diabetes Self-Management Education (DSME) protocols in the country. Diabetes education is offered in few centers without official national numbers, and psychological and psychiatric support for PWT1D is still scarce in Brazil.27\n\nRemote and online service needs to be developed, evaluated, and implemented. The training of diabetes teams to recognize the pathological levels of the psychosocial comorbidities is needed and the proper referral of patients to the mental health system is crucial. Telemedicine was highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic and became one of the forefront of diabetes management. Besides decreasing the risk of virus transmission, it's effective in alleviating the emotional burden of T1D individuals.43\n\nThis study has some strengths: to our knowledge this is the first national study comparing emotional burden from different Brazilian regions during the pandemic, using valid and reliable instruments that allow the evaluation of data in a trusted way. A considerable number of T1D participants took part in this study, and it increased the reliability of the results. Our study identifies subgroups at risk for worse psychosocial outcomes, which could provide evidence for target interventions. The study limitations are: the data were collected in the first months of the pandemic, therefore we could not draw conclusions about the emotional burden over time. The bias in the study sample should also be considered. The flyers were displayed on social media and web diabetes groups thus, a great part of the sample was composed of female participants with high education, and highly community-engaged, which could underestimate the DB, DD, and depressive levels."
