        "text": "Taylor was born Spangler Arlington Brugh in Filley, Nebraska. (No, really.) When Clark Gable left MGM in the early '50s, Taylor was tapped as \"the next big thing,\" but his film career had already reached its peak in the '40s. He turned to television, where he headlined 'The Detectives Starring Robert Taylor' and hosted 'Death Valley Days'.\n\nAsked by Beth Sederstrom · Last updated 3 years ago · 23.1K views · SOURCE"
