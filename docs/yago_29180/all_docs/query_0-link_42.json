        "text": "MUNICH, Germany, April 22 (UPI)â€”A. West German juvenile court today sentenced Michael Thiess, son of Ursula Thiess, the actress, and stepson of Robert Taylor, to a year in a reformatory for trying to poison his real father.\n\nThe court convicted Michael, 18 years old, of trying to poison George Thiess, 49, West German movie producer, by pouring a chemical into his tea on Feb. 5. Mr. Thiess did not drink the tea because it had a peculiar odor.\n\nThe marriage between Ursula and George Thiess ended when Michael was 2. His mother married Mr. Taylor, the American actor, several years ago."
