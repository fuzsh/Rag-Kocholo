        "text": "When Robert Taylor married Barbara Stanwyck, the marriage came as something of a relief to MGM, who had been distinctly worried about Taylor's seeming lack of interest in women. Taylor's overbearing mother was not impressed and went on hunger strike to protest at the wedding which referred to as 'it'. Taylor spent his wedding night with his mother.\n\nHe didn't enjoy spending time with his wife and claimed to have fallen in love with Lana Turner, during the filming of 'Johnny Eager' (1941). He went so far as to boast that their passion had been consummated, a claim Lana refuted. Taylor told Stanwyck he was in love with Turner and they had a brief break-up.\n\nWhen he befriended MGM worker Ralph Couser, Stanwyck became convicted the two men were having an affair. When Couser telephoned the Taylor home, Stanwyck would call out, 'Hey, Bob, your wife wants to speak to you.' Taylor became convinced he was gay and went to visit a psychologist. He was told that he saw Stanwyck as a mother figure, and, therefore, could not become aroused by her. He later let it be known that he had an affair with Ava Gardner. He and Stanwyck were divorced in 1951. In 1954, he married divorced actress Ursula Theiss aboard a boat in Jackosn Lane, Jackson, Wyoming. With her, he found a new lease of life and felt his attraction to men almost disappear. It is said that he once yelled at Stanwyck:'At least, i can get it up with her.' With Theiss, they had two children.\n\nSal Mineo once said of him: 'I'd always heard around town that Robert Taylor was bisexual, that his marriage to Barbara Stanwyck was arranged, and that she was also gay. So when i met Taylor, i figured we'd have something in common, right? Wrong! I was open, he was not only closeted, he was right wing and a witch hunter, not at all friendly, or honest, or even smiling.'\n\nDataLounge, what do you think, or feel about Robert Taylor?\n\nStanwyck carried a torch for him, long after they divorced. When he died, his wife Ursula graciously allowed Stanwyck to sit with the family during his funeral. She made something of a spectacle of herself. She arrived, late, with two attendants supporting her. She wore a bright yellow dress that jarred with the attire of the other mourners. She said that Taylor had told her he didn't want people wearing black at his funeral, hence the yellow dress. During the funeral she sobbed and carried on. Despite all this Ursula invited her back to their house where everybody was having \"a drink on Bob.\" When Stanwyck was ready to leave, she and Ursula were seen deep in conversation in the middle of the driveway. No one knows what was said, but the two women betrayed no emotion, there was no comforting hand touching an arm, no hug or handshake. Then Barbara took her leave, getting into her limousine and slowly driving away. She never got over Robert Taylor, even though their relationship was unfulfilling and unsatisfying for both of them.\n\nWell, I was looking for something else, but came across this, and needed to share it with DL (about Joan Crawford and Elizabeth Taylor).\n\n[quote]Apparently all was not calm between the two during the filming of Torch: A frequent visitor to the set, Liz snubbed Joan one day by not saying \"hello\"; Joan then accosted publicity man Dore Freeman and said \"You tell that little bitch never to walk in here without acknowledging me. I want you to teach her some manners.\" Joan also allegedly suggested to Wilding that he put a harness on his wife. Liz later told reporters that her husband was very fortunate to be playing a blind man in his first American film: \"That way he doesn't have to look at Joan Crawford throughout the entire movie.\"\n\nThere's a good biography of Barbara Stanwyck by Axel Madsen. In her later years, confined to her home by illness, she \"let her mind drift to the past.\" And it was obvious she never let go of Robert Taylor:\n\nHer sickroom became a dimly lit shrine to Bob Taylor and herself. Photos of them together were everywhere. On the night table stood her honorary Oscar. It was almost twenty years since Bob had died, but she talked of her late husband as if he were there yesterday, and she came to believe she could communicate with him through the Oscar. If anyone asked why she was clutching the statue in bed, she said \"It brings Bob to me.\"\n\n\"When I hold this Oscar and I'm very quiet, I feel young and beautiful again. I discovered some time ago that Bob is still with me and that our love for each other will continue on the other side. Bob comes to me in the early hours of each morning. I wasn't frightened when he first appeared, just pleased and grateful. That was a year ago, and I was tossing and turning in my sleep. I turned on the light and saw the Oscar gleaming on the table. Something told me to pick it up. As I touched it there was a little electric shock, and then my beloved Bob was standing by me. A look of incredible tenderness was on his face. We were together again, and I knew he was there to help me to the other side\"\n\nPoor Barbara. Her mind was not just \"drifting\"; it had gone soft. She sounds like she'd gone totally loony, thinking she could communicate with the deceased Robert Taylor through an Oscar.\n\n\"I did too until I found out that Power was the bisexual into scat as opposed to the normal bisexual?\"\n\nWhere did you hear Tyrone Power was \"into scat?\" From Scotty Bowers? Only an idiot would believe anything that crazy old coot says.\n\nTyrone Power was one of Judy Garland's boyfriends. According the Gerald Clarke (Clarke is a big old Judy queen) he was smitten with her and wanted to marry her. But evil people told her the lie that he was reading her love letters to his army buddies so she ended the relationship. Actually, the relationship was nothing more than an affair for both of them. To say that marriage was in the cards for them was really stretching it.\n\nR117 I believe that Bette Davis has a tiny supporting role in the 1931 \"Waterloo Bridge\" as Douglass Montgomery/Kent Douglass' sister. BTW: Douglass Montgomery really pings. Montgomery married later in middle age - 45 years old. Mae Clarke's character in the 1931 \"Waterloo Bridge\" is pretty much flat out a prostitute/ex-chorus girl right from the beginning of the movie - the hero is too naive to know what she is. There is a great scene with Mae Clarke and Enid Bennett as the hero's mother where she very gently and sympathetically tells Clarke that she isn't going to marry her son and they both know why.... No fooling mother.\n\nStanwyck really seemed to look for beauty in men. Taylor, RJ Wagner and the scenes she has with Richard Chamberlain in \"The Thorn Birds\" are sizzling. She is in her 70's and she is burning up the screen with her sexuality. Also, Stanwyck continued to play seductive sexually powerful women all through her forties and into her fifties.\n\nI can't get worked up about the sexuality of Robert Taylor in general because I have a feeling he was as stiff and boring in bed as he was onscreen.\n\nI'm very glad that it was suggested to watch the Feelin'/Foolin' number. I loved it because it reminded me how old Hollywood made practically every one sing and dance - whether they wanted to or not. And they did! Thats's the way it was but I am always amazed that they were able to muster the talent (although with varying results) to be able to pull it off. To me that is astonishing.\n\nAlso thank you to R81 for that clip. I actually started to cry. I'm kind of embarrassed to (Mary!) admit it but it's true. It was just the magic of Hollywood in those days. With the sets, not to mention the absurdity of a bunch of strangers dancing in the dark. But the beauty of Leigh and Taylor and the belief that a sap like me would sit in the audience convinced there was a place like that - that pulled off a stunt like that. It all kind of came together and worked me over.\n\nThank you DL. It's threads like these that remind me there are still many of the old gang around and still can produce wonderful, wonderful threads."
