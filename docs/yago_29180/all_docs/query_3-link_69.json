        "text": "Synopsis\n\nRobert Taylor was one of Hollywood's biggest stars for over thirty-years and starred in such classic films as Magnificent Obsession, Camille, A Yank at Oxford, Waterloo Bridge, Johnny Eager, Quo Vadis, Ivanhoe and The Last Hunt. He worked with the cream of Hollywood leading ladies: Irene Dunne, Joan Crawford, Greta Garbo, Vivien Leigh,Lana Turner, Katharine Hepburn and Barbara Stanwyck, who he later married, just to name a few. An open and friendly man who usually tried to avoid controversy, Taylor stepped into it when he became a so-called friendly witness appearing before the House Un-American Activities Committee during the height of the Washington investigations into alleged Communism in Hollywood. It has haunted his reputation to this day. A happy second marriage to actress Ursula Thiess produced two children and gave Taylor a contentment he lacked in his earlier marriage. Author Charles Tranberg takes a fresh look at the actor who was once called, \"The man with the perfect profile.\" This book also takes a fascinating look at the Hollywood Studio system which existed during Taylor's hey-day.\n\n\"synopsis\" may belong to another edition of this title.\n\nFrom the Publisher\n\nROBERT TAYLOR: A BIOGRAPHY by Charles Tranberg (the author of the highly praised and best selling I LOVE THE ILLUSION: THE LIFE AND CAREER OF AGNES MOOREHEAD & FRED MACMURRAY: A BIOGRAPHY) takes a look at the man born in Nebraska as Spangler Arlington Brugh and came to Hollywood and was renamed Robert Taylor. In his early years he was known as a heart throb in films like MAGNIFICENT OBSESSION, CAMILLE, A YANK AT OXFORD, WATERLOO BRIDGE & JOHNNY EAGER. But Taylor was eager to shed the typecasting and perform in meatier roles--and he succeeded in films like UNDERCURRENT, THE HIGH WALL, QUO VADIS, WESTWARD THE WOMEN, ABOVE AND BEYOND, IVANHOE, and THE LAST HUNT. Taylor was one of the last survivors of the studio system--under contract to MGM for an incredible 24-years--outlasting contemporaries like Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy. He worked with the cream of Hollywood leading ladies: Greta Garbo,Joan Crawford, Myrna Loy, Loretta Young, Irene Dunne, Jean Harlow, Vivien Leigh and Katharine Hepburn, just to name a few. He married Barbara Stanwyck, a union which lasted over a decade, but led to a bitter divorce over infidelity. He later married the actress Ursula Thiess and had two children--a happy union. He was widely considered a nice, easy-going man but his life included controversy--his testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) in 1947 would haunt him for the rest of his life and even after his death. His son, Terry, writes in the preface,\"Chuck Tranberg meticulously and painstakingly researched, explored, and carefully chronicled this fascinating time in history. He offers us a glimpse into early Hollywood where the studio system incubated and dominated so many stars, Robert Taylor among them.\""
