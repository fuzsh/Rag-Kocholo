The first was a callow youth, stiff and unformed as an actor, but so very handsome that his stock soared for over a decade after his film debut in the mid-1930s. This young Taylor was earnest in Magnificent Obsession, snide and shallow in Small Town Girl, the epitome of the naive dream lover in Camille. MGM, where Taylor spent most of his career, was a glamour factory and he was groomed to be the perfect leading man: smooth, charming, boyishly sincere.\n\nThe other Taylor was less a studio creation than the inevitable assertion of the actor's capabilities and nature. Early in the 1940s, a hard, cold aspect of his personality began to emerge: in Johnny Eager he is an unsympathetic racketeer, in Undercurrent an unscrupulous, dangerous husband, in The Bribe a tough federal agent. Taylor's increasingly craggy countenance made him a natural for Westerns; the Pretty-Boy played the title role in the glamorized Billy the Kid but the tougher, more humorless Taylor took things firmly in hand in Ambush, Westward the Women, Devil's Doorway, and Ride Vaquero! His willingness to take on harsh characters, as in The High Wall, Rogue Cop, and The Last Hunt, exhibits his desire to transform himself into a player of greater versatility. Unfortunately, either he did not have it in him or MGM never gave him the chance to stretch. That he had a way with comedy is evidenced by his witty cameo in I Love Melvin and some boisterous scenes in Westward the Women, but his comedic talents went otherwise unexplored.\n\nTaylor's only respite from the hard, often villainous roles of his later career came in splashy costume dramas—Ivanhoe, Knights of the Round Table, Quo Vadis—in which his dash could be displayed in technicolor opposite such leading ladies as Elizabeth Taylor, Ava Gardner, and Deborah Kerr.\n\nHis last decade in films was spent treading water, but Party Girl, The House of the Seven Hawks, and Cattle King are indications of what he could accomplish with a good director and an offbeat setting. He and his ex-wife, Barbara Stanwyck, even accomplished that rarity of rarities in The Night Walker: they make it a pretty good William Castle film.\n\n—Frank Thompson"
