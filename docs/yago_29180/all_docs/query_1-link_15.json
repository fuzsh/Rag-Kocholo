        "text": "Lana Turner\n\nSpouses:\n\nBarbara Stanwyck: actress\n\nUrsula Theiss: German actress\n\nRumors of homosexuality dogged Robert Taylor's career from the outset, and he supposedly begged Louis B. Mayer to cast him in rugged, he-man parts, and to engineer a macho image for him off-screen. The publicity machine revved up to burnish Taylor's image by planting stories in the tabloids of his love of manly pursuits like hunting and his relationships with actresses, most notably about his set \"romance\" with frequent co-star Barbara Stanwyck. Many deemed Stanwyck the most famous closeted lesbian in Hollywood--besides Garbo--so their studio-engineered relationship served both Taylor and Stanwyck well. The studio whisked the two friends off for a civil wedding in 1939, and both got a career boost from the legal union: Stanwyck enjoyed the cachet of marrying one of the most devastatingly handsome matinee idols of Hollywood's Golden Era and Taylor earned the social acceptance afforded by marriage. Taylor had always battled his pretty-boy image and despaired over his lack of critical acclaim--marriage to Stanwyck and the new assertively masculine assignments it delivered proved him a passing good actor and a dedicated professional. Some of his finer performances came in Quo Vadis (1951), Ivanhoe (1952), Knights of the Round Table (1953), The Hangman (1959), and Return of the Gunfighter (1966). Taylor grew increasingly more conservative in the 1950s (he took part in the McCarthy witch-hunts), and eventually took a second, much younger wife, German actress Ursula Thiess."
