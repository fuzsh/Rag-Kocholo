Pulitzer Prize-winning US author Cormac McCarthy, known for his novels including The Road and No Country For Old Men, has died at the age of 89 at his home in Santa Fe, Mexico, his agent has confirmed.

McCarthy died at his home on Tuesday from natural causes, according to a statement from publisher Penguin Random House that cited his son, John McCarthy.

Though he published his first book The Orchard Keeper in 1965, commercial success eluded McCarthy until 1992’s All the Pretty Horses, which received rapturous reviews and reversed his fortunes overnight.

The book was made into a film – as were 2005’s No Country for Old Men and 2006’s Pulitzer Prize-winning The Road. The adaptation of No Country for Old Men, starring Tommy Lee Jones and Javier Bardem, won four Oscars including Best Picture.

Throughout his career, McCarthy penned multiple novels, screenplays and short stories spanning the Western and post-apocalyptic genres.

An intensely private man, McCarthy almost never gave interviews. He granted a rare exception for Oprah Winfrey in 2007, telling her: “I don’t think (interviews) are good for your head. If you spend a lot of time thinking about how to write a book, you probably shouldn’t be thinking about it, you probably should be doing it.”

But he was known to have been married and divorced three times, and had two sons – Cullen McCarthy, via first wife Lee Holleman, and John McCarthy, via third wife, Jennifer Winkley.

In a statement, Nihar Malaviya, CEO of Penguin Random House, said, “Cormac McCarthy changed the course of literature. For sixty years, he demonstrated an unwavering dedication to his craft, and to exploring the infinite possibilities and power of the written word.”

Stephen King wrote: “Cormac McCarthy, maybe the greatest American novelist of my time, has passed away at 89. He was full of years and created a fine body of work, but I still mourn his passing.”
