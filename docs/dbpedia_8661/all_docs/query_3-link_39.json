While he is best known for The Road, All the Pretty Horses, and No Country for Old Men, both of the latter two made into motion pictures, most consider Blood Meridian his magnum opus. The novel, based on historical events, is violent and difficult. And yet, this is a work that lends itself to a myriad of observations and conversation. “Words are things. The words he is in possession of he cannot be deprived of. Their authority transcends this ignorance of their meaning.”\n\nThis group is designed for readers who want to explore and engage in the work and think about the influences of Faulkner and Melville via historical references and Biblical passages.\n\nThe book will be divided into four sections, assigned before the first class.\n\nSession I-IV: Blood Meridian: Or the Evening Redness in the West"
