        "text": "No Country For Old Men.\n\nMCCARTHY, Cormac.\n\n$8,800.00\n\nItem Number: 125722\n\nNew Orleans: B.E. Trice Publishing, 2005.\n\nSigned limited first edition of this “harrowing, propulsive drama… about a stone-cold killer, a small-town sheriff, and an average Joe” (New York Times), one of only 75 copies. Octavo, bound in three quarters leather over marbled boards, gilt titles to the spine. Signed by Cormac McCarthy. Additionally signed twice with a note by the legendary dust jacket designer Chip Kidd below McCarthy’s signature which reads, “The dust jacket is meant to represent the killer Chigurh, but in reality is a stock shot of a guy out jogging at sunrise- Chip Kidd Chip Kidd.” Fine in a fine slipcase. A unique example explaining the iconic dust jacket design by Chip Kidd on the trade edition of this volume.\n\n\"Cormac McCarthy has said, in interviews, that there is no such thing as life without bloodshed, and that the novelists proper occupation is with death. His work gives eloquent witness to this vision McCarthy is a colossally gifted writer\" (The New Yorker). Basis for the Coen brothers' 2007 film with Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin, and Javier Bardem that won four Oscars, including Best Picture."
