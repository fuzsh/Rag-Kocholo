        "text": "Much more than expected from the title\n\nThis book has violence, insight, humor, love, respect, honor and depth beyond the story line. Narrator: Tom Stechschulte is excellent. He makes the characters come to life.\n\nI could not put it down. This book will make you rethink some of your own values and appreciate your life for what it is. At least it did for me. The \"country\" wisdom is put in a take it or leave it fashion that does not seem forced on you but lets you draw your own conclusion. Very enjoyable listen.\n\nAwesome Listen\n\nI recently saw the movie and couldn't stop thinking about it. I decided to check out the audio book even though i was a bit worried that since I knew how it ended that I would find it boring. I was not disappointed even though the Movie was an excellent adapation of the book there was still alot of content and dialog the book offered that made it very enjoyable and difficult to tear myself away.\n\nMr Mcarthy has a gift with words and storys I am totally in awe of how of how he can pull the reader into the story with the detail and dialog of the characters while at the same time forcing the reader to use the reader to think and use their imagination.\n\nThere is a lot of action and violence in the book to keep you interested but its the dialog of the characters that make it great!\n\nThe Narrator is great as well he does a fantistic Job of making the book feel authentic. He also makes it easy for you to tell the diffence between characters with the tone and style of his voice which not all narrators can do. I will now look for him on future books I pick.\n\nTook a while to understand this story\n\nAt first, this story really bored me. It just had descriptions of a psycho-killer killing everyone to get some money. What was the point? Later, this turned into a struggle between one man (the killer) and all the forces that went after him, many just as determined as he was.\n\nThe sheriff evolves as a philosophical character. In the book, he acknowledges that he is probably only alive because the killer doesn't think much of him. Then he discusses something that happened in WWII (the setting is 1970s) and some of the characters were also in Vietnam. Right after reading this, I watched to movie again. Some of the subtlety of the book is lost in the movie. It would have been hard to put it in, but it is a loss in the movie and makes the book worthwhile, even if you have seen the movie.\n\nI often had trouble determining who the narrator was at various points. I'm not sure if this was in the original book, or if it is a difficulty peculiar to the narration. The voices also were not very distinctive, so that made it more difficult, as one has to figure out who is speaking from the context- and that can take a while.\n\nworth reading even after movie\n\nWhat made the experience of listening to No Country for Old Men the most enjoyable?\n\nThe narrative skills of the author are excellent. I had seen the movie a few years ago, and I thought perhaps the book wouldn't be as exciting as the movie, but I was mistaken, the book is another experience altogether.\n\nDid the plot keep you on the edge of your seat? How?\n\nI knew the plot from the movie, but more than the plot what kept me hooked was the ability of the narrator to tell the story, to create characters, dialogue that are interesting to imagine and experience.\n\nWhich character – as performed by Tom Stechschulte – was your favorite?\n\nChigurh no doubt is a very strong character. He comes across as a real being, a very strange fellow, but very credible. Ed Tom, the Sheriff, who is the narrator of the book is also very interesting since it is through his point of view that we experience the action.\n\nDid you have an extreme reaction to this book? Did it make you laugh or cry?\n\nI don't think it is the kind of books which makes one cry or laugh. Yes, at the end there is some reflexion on evil and wars and the difficulties of life; all these things can sort of get you into a melancholic mood, but all of it very much part of the deal; one knows these sort of things are on the writers mind, specially if one has read other of his books, or seen the films.\n\nAny additional comments?\n\nI was hooked from the first paragraph to the last. I don't recall ever being bored throughout the narration. If anything, I had wished the book to be longer.\n\nPure Texas\n\nI'm a big fan of Cormac McCarthy and his rich story telling. His settings in Texas ring true to my experiences and memories. And the narration here is superb. The written word and expressions used are pure to the common dialogue of the good old boys in Texas.\n\nThe outlook and acceptance of circumstances are so spot on to the mentality and culture of the people that scrabble an existence in the hot and dry and dangerous environment of Texas.\n\nThere are seeds of brilliance and depth of thought cloaked in the common sense and unpretentious language and cadence. This is not the King's English, but who needs it when the good people of Texas are just as smart but express themselves simply."
