        "text": "Description\n\nOriginally published in 1993, this was the first volume of essays devoted to the works of Cormac McCarthy. Immediately it was recognized as a major contribution to studies of this acclaimed American author. American Literary Scholarship hailed it as “a model of its kind.” It has since established itself as an essential source for any McCarthy scholar, student, or serious reader.\n\nIn 1993, McCarthy had recently published All the Pretty Horses (1992), the award-winning first volume of the “Border Trilogy.” The second volume, The Crossing, appeared in 1994, and the concluding novel, Cities of the Plain, in 1998. The completion of the trilogy, one of the most significant artistic achievements in recent American literature, calls for further consideration of McCarthy's career. This revised volume, therefore, contains in addition to the original essays an updated version of Gail Morrison's article on All the Pretty Horses, plus two original essays by the editors of The Crossing (Luce) and Cities of the Plain (Arnold). Except for McCarthy's drama, The Stonemason (1994), all the major publications are covered in this collection."
