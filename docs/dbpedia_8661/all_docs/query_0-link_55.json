        "text": "2022 Update:\n\nJust shy of ten years since I first read it, No Country for Old Men is every bit as grim as I remember, and then some. One thing shifted for me on my second reading: I used to think of this book as an ultra-gritty crime story, but this time around, it felt more like a horror novel. Llewellyn Moss and Carla Jean are horrified by his inability to turn away from his fate, Sheriff Bell is horrified by what the world has become and what it may yet become, and Anton Chigurh is the horror itself––the bottomless black maw into which America is slowly but inevitably crumbling.\n\nOriginal Review from 2012:\n\nExceptional book. I liked this much better than Blood Meridian, even though I’d say the latter is technically superior. This book displayed much simpler language without loosing the ability to make me furrow my brow in all the right ways. I especially loved Sheriff Bell’s internal monologues that opened each chapter. The writing is strong and simple and thought provoking, and McCarthy uses those moments to tackle very difficult ideas in an open, questioning voice that shies away from being dogmatic while still putting forth a strong moral foundation for Bell’s character. Also, in general, this book contains some of the best dialogue I’ve ever read.\n\nAnother thought I had after reading this was that the Coen Brothers’ screenplay based on this book may be one of the best book to film adaptations of all time. They captured the feel of the novel perfectly and stayed as true to the story as anyone could hope. I didn’t feel like the small differences between the book and film detracted from my experience of either one."
