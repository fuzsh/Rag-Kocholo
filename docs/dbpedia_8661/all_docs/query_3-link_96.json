Howard\n\nTitle: Woolmer Collection of Cormac McCarthy\n\nDates: 1969-2006\n\nAbstract: The Woolmer Collection of Cormac McCarthy spans 1969-2006 and\n\ndocuments the professional and personal friendship between the book\n\ncollector and McCarthy. The collection is arranged in four series:\n\nCorrespondence, Writings by McCarthy, Writings about McCarthy, and\n\nWoolmer’s Bibliography Files.\n\nIdentification: Collection 092\n\nExtent: 5 boxes (2.5 linear feet)\n\nLanguage: English.\n\nRepository: Southwestern Writers Collection, The Wittliff Collections, Alkek Library, Texas State University-San Marcos\n\nBackground Sketch\n\nBook collector and bibliographer, J. Howard Woolmer, wrote to Cormac McCarthy praising both Outer Dark (1968) and McCarthy’s first novel, The Orchard Keeper (1965) after reading Robert Coles’ review of Outer Dark published in the March 22, 1969 issue of The New Yorker. In his July 29, 1969 letter, Woolmer states his intent to begin collecting all of McCarthy’s work and asks if the author would be willing to sign copies of his books. In his August 16 reply, McCarthy agrees. These letters mark the first of over 120 sent between the two men from 1969 to 2006.\n\nBy 1969, Woolmer had been in the book selling business for almost ten years. Operating out of the literary Mecca of New York City, he issued his first catalogue in 1961. His early catalogues were of modern first editions and on the works of literary giants such as James Joyce. Woolmer soon began issuing catalogues based on single subjects; the first on the Imagist Poets (1966) and then, in 1969, on the novelist Malcolm Lowry, author of Under the Volcano. He has since published a bibliography on Malcolm Lowry; A Checklist of the Hogarth Press; and a bibliography of the Leonard L. Milberg Irish Theatre Collection.\n\nIn a 2007 interview, Woolmer stated that he had initially moved away from modern firsts because “I didn’t get enough of a kick from the books of contemporary writers.” However, with Cormac McCarthy he had discovered an exception, and over the next thirty years he amassed a remarkable collection of signed first editions, advance proofs, and foreign imprints of McCarthy’s books. The Wittliff Collections purchased these books in 2006 along with the collection of letters between McCarthy and Woolmer.\n\nScope and Content Note\n\nThe Woolmer Collection of Cormac McCarthy spans 1969-2006 and documents the professional and personal friendship between the book collector and McCarthy. The collection is arranged in four series: Correspondence, Writings by McCarthy, Writings about McCarthy, and Woolmer’s Bibliography Files.\n\nSeries I: Correspondence, 1996-2006 (box 1), contains 120 letters between McCarthy and Woolmer. The letters are arranged chronologically. The majority of the letters discuss McCarthy’s writing, but other topics include recommendations of books to read, reviews of McCarthy’s work, and the book collecting world. More detailed descriptions of each letter are found in the container list beginning on page 5.\n\nSeries II: Writings by McCarthy, 1982-1994 (boxes 1-4), includes photocopies of drafts of Blood Meridian, The Crossing, Cities of the Plain, The Road, The Stonemason, and The Gardener’s Son. The works are arranged into following subseries: Novels, Plays, and Screenplays.\n\nSeries III: Writings about McCarthy, 1974-2006 (boxes 4-5), comprises reviews and articles about McCarthy from Esquire, The New Yorker, Southern Literary Journal, Texas Monthly, and other publications. The writings are arranged alphabetically by author. Also included are a number off clippings files about McCarthy and a small collection of ephemera such as publishers catalogs, flyers, and press packets.\n\nSeries IV: J. Howard Woolmer bibliography files, 1986-2006, (box 5), consists of Woolmer’s files and notes on a possible bibliography on McCarthy. Of note are Woolmer’s correspondence files regarding collecting McCarthy.\n\nResearch access by appointment only.\n\nAdministrative Information\n\nAccess Restrictions\n\nNone.\n\nPreferred Citation\n\nWoolmer Collection of Cormac McCarthy, Southwestern Writers Collection, Texas State University-San Marcos\n\nAcquisition Information\n\nPurchased in 2006.\n\nProcessing Information\n\nProcessed by Katie Salzmann, 2007.\n\nNotes to Researchers\n\nBooks in the Woolmer Collection have been cataloged and the records are searchable through the Alkek Library online catalog, http://catalog.library.txstate.edu/.\n\nDetailed Description of the Collection\n\nBox Folder\n\nSeries I: Correspondence, 1969-2006.\n\n1 1 Woolmer to McCarthy.

This was the only one of Millers books I didnt have and I’ve been looking forward to reading it for years…” Mentions his early publications: “I’m afraid theres not much research to do in the way of bibliography. Think I published a story once in a college rag…When I started writing novels I stopped writing anything else. Never wrote no poetry.” Ends with “I’m in Tucson working on my ‘western’ [Blood Meridian] Long book supposed to be out this year but maybe not.”\n\n1 3 Woolmer to McCarthy. January 9, 1979.

ALS, 1 p.\n\n“Thank you for the note. Letter, I guess…” Mentions he did not know that Antaeus had published an excerpt from Suttree. “I dont like to find my name in little magazines, but the idea of a limited edition sounds interesting.

The book is essentially finished (300 pp) but needs to be completely rewritten…”\n\n1 3 Woolmer to McCarthy. March 10, 1979.

Also the cartoonist managed to get all the words spelled right.” Answers Woolmer’s question about his writing process: “I normally use a typewriter (you asked) and I think you can see why.” Mentions that Random House has publishing rights for “the western” but that maybe Woolmer can publish an excerpt.\n\n1 3 Woolmer to McCarthy.

TLS, 1 p.\n\n“Thank you for your very nice letter…” Mentions that Robert Penn Warren and he share the same editor at Random House [Erskine]. “Interesting that he [Warren] liked Child of God. Some people think it a most peculiar book, but lately it has been receiving a sort of belated enthusiasm in the form of reviews and theses and such.” Mentions that Wise Blood actors Brad Dourif and Ned Beatty were also both in The Gardner’s Son.\n\n1 4 Woolmer to McCarthy.

My agent for several years was Candida Donadio...she expressed her satisfaction at representing me personally and negotiated the contract for the book with which I am now occupied. That was the last I ever heard of her…I wrote and told her I’d like to make official what already existed in fact and we amicably parted…After this I wrote some other agents who’d been recommended to me by a friend but the one or two who wrote back seemed less than jubilant about the prospects of representing me. So Random House is now my agent…”\n\n1 4 Woolmer to McCarthy. October 6, 1981.
