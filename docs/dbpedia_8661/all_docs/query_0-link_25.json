        "text": "Josh Brolin is one of the most well-recognized actors in Hollywood at present. Brolin’s career has been through the wringer, but he did not give up, and he is now reaping the rewards for his persistence. His career took a bit of a nosedive, but the one film that helped him get back on track was No Country for Old Men. The film holds a special place in Brolin’s heart, and even the author of the book, Cormac McCarthy, honored him in a special way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJosh Brolin has starred in some of the biggest film franchises of all time. From playing Thanos in the Marvel Cinematic Universe to donning the role of Gurney Halleck in the Dune series, Brolin has found unprecedented success as an actor. And he owes it to the film adaptation of Cormac McCarthy’s No Country for Old Men.\n\nMcCarthy’s works have been adapted a few times, but No Country for Old Men remains the most faithful one to date. Set in the deserts of Texas, the film tells the story of Anton Chigurh, an escaped convict, and Llewelyn Moss, who is being pursued by Chigurh after he steals a briefcase containing money. Hailed as a masterpiece, and rightly so, the film nabbed four Oscars as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJosh Brolin recalls the gift he got from Cormac McCarthy\n\nRecently, Josh Brolin invited Megan Lovallo to his home in Malibu. The Dune actor fondly spoke of the various art pieces in his living room and memorabilia he collected from the films he has been a part of in his career.\n\nDuring the course of the interview, Josh Brolin touched upon the film that saw the resurgence of his career. Brolin shared interesting anecdotes as well, before delving into what McCarthy did for him as a gift.\n\nJosh Brolin played Moss in the film, and the film saw a lot of bloodshed. So when McCarthy was present on set, he signed the book for Brolin. Moreover, he also left his fingerprints with the fake blood that was used for filming, as revealed by the star himself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow Josh Brolin landed the role in No Country for Old Men\n\nJoel and Ethan Coen, also known as the Coen brothers, helmed No Country for Old Men, which was a critically acclaimed film in 2007. The public was very receptive to the film, and in addition to the Oscar wins, Josh Brolin benefited the most from it.\n\nThe part of Llewelyn Moss won Josh Brolin a lot of accolades. Most importantly, though, it helped nudge his career towards an upward trajectory. Brolin once explained how he landed the part in the film.\n\n“I was doing Grindhouse with Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. I said to Robert, ‘There’s this Coen brothers movie that’s happening.’ I had read the book a long time ago. I asked Robert if he would videotape me, and he said, ‘Why don’t we just use the camera we have?’” recalled Brolin (via Far Out Magazine).\n\nAdvertisement"
