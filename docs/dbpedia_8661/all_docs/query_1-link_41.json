        "meta_description": "\"No Country for Old Men\" is a mesmerizing new thriller from Academy Award® winning filmmakers Joel Coen and Ethan Coen, based on the acclaimed novel by Pulitzer Prize winning American master Cormac McCarthy. The time is our own, when rustlers have given way to drug-runners and small towns have become free-fire zones. The story begins when Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) finds a pickup truck surrounded by a sentry of dead men. A load of heroin and two million dollars in cash are still in the back. When Moss takes the money, he sets off a chain reaction of catastrophic violence that not even the law - in the person of aging, disillusioned Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) - can contain. As Moss tries to evade his pursuers - in particular a mysterious mastermind who flips coins for human lives (Javier Bardem) - the film simultaneously strips down the American crime drama and broadens its concerns to encompass themes as ancient as the Bible and as bloodily contemporary as this morning's headlines.",

        "text": "The Bible states the love of money is the root of all evil, not money itself. It is certainly true in this film, in which a character named Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) puts his life in danger as well as his wife’s to hold on to some blood money he stumbles across. Javier Bardem plays the man bent on recovering the money, as he was the mastermind behind the drug deal which went awry. He is a ruthless killer who does not like to be back talked. The story foretells an obvious fact, that these two characters will eventually meet and one of them will not walk away. In a clever plot device, a tracking device is in the money bag Llewelyn is carrying, making it easy for the killer to track him. The audience waits to see if Llewelyn figures this out.\n\nTommy Lee Jones is in fine form as usual as the weary sheriff who has seen it all, and he attempts to save Llewelyn and his wife from the cold-hearted murderer. Unfortunately, a lot of bloody violence and strong language prevent us from awarding our Dove “Family-Approved” Seal to this movie."
