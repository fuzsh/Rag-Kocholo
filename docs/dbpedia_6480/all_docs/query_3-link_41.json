        "text": "Hokkaidō Expressway 道央自動車道 Route information Length: 413.6 km (257.0 mi) Existed: 1971[1] – present Major junctions From: Otoshibe Interchange in Yakumo, Hokkaidō\n\nPref. Route 1155 To: Shibetsu-Kenbuchi Interchange in Kenbuchi, Hokkaidō\n\nNational Route 40 Location Major cities: Muroran, Tomakomai, Chitose, Sapporo, Fukagawa, Asahikawa Highway system\n\nNational highways of Japan\n\nExpressways of Japan\n\nThe Hokkaidō Expressway (道央自動車道, Dōō Jidōsha-dō?) is a national expressway in Hokkaidō, Japan. It is owned and operated by East Nippon Expressway Company.\n\nContents\n\n1 Naming\n\n2 Overview\n\n3 History\n\n4 List of interchanges and features\n\n4.1 Southern route (Sapporo JCT - Nanae IC)\n\n4.2 Northern route (Sapporo JCT - Nayoro IC)\n\n5 References\n\n6 External links\n\nNaming\n\nThe expressway is named the Dōō Expressway (lit. Central Hokkaidō Expressway) in Japanese, however its official English name is the Hokkaidō Expressway. It is the only national expressway in Japan whose English name is not a direct romanization of the Japanese name.\n\nOfficially the expressway is designated as the Hokkaidō Jūkan Expressway.[2]\n\nOverview\n\nThe expressway connects the north of Hokkaidō with the south via the city of Sapporo. Extension of the expressway in the north towards the city of Wakkanai and in the south towards the city of Hakodate is underway; although the Hokkaidō Expressway itself is not planned to extend as far as these two cities, various expressway-standard roads (bypasses of National Route 40 to the north and National Route 5 to the south) will cover the remaining distances.\n\nSome unfinished sections of the expressway (Shibetsu-Kenbuchi Interchange to Nayoro Interchange in the north and Ōnuma Interchange to Nanae Interchange in the south) will be constructed according to the New Direct Control System.[3] These sections are expected to operate toll-free upon completion.\n\nThe section from Sapporo-minami Interchange through Sapporo Junction to Sapporo-nishi Interchange on the Sasson Expressway is built to an urban expressway standard and tolls are charged at a flat rate. As of March 2008 the toll on this section is 400 yen for regular passenger cars. Tolls on all other sections of the expressway are assessed according to distance travelled in the same manner as most other national expressways.[4]\n\nHistory\n\nDecember 4, 1971 - Kitahiroshima Interchange - Chitose Interchange section opened.\n\nSeptember 19, 1972 - Kitahiroshima Interchange - Chitose Interchange section expanded to 4 lanes.\n\nOctober 24, 1978 - Chitose Interchange - Tomakomai-higashi Interchange section opened.\n\nOctober 29, 1979 - Sapporo-minami Interchange - Kitahiroshima Interchange section opened.\n\nOctober 29, 1980 - Tomakomai-higashi Interchange - Tomakomai-nishi Interchange section opened.\n\nNovember 9, 1983 - Sapporo Interchange - Iwamizawa Interchange section opened.\n\nNovember 30, 1983 - Tomakomai-nishi Interchange - Shiraoi Interchange section opened.\n\nOctober 18, 1985 - Shiraoi Interchange - Noboribetsu-higashi Interchange section opened.\n\nOctober 25, 1985 - Sapporo Interchange - Sapporo-minami Interchange section opened.\n\nOctober 9, 1986 - Noboribetsu-higashi Interchange - Noboribetsu Muroran Interchange section opened.\n\nSeptember 18, 1987 - Iwamizawa Interchange - Bibai Interchange section opened.
