        "text": "History\n\nUntil after the Meiji Restoration, the area that is now Niigata Prefecture was divided into Echigo Province (on the mainland) and Sado Province. During the Sengoku period, the Nagao clan, who were at times vassals to the Uesugi, ruled a fief in the western part of modern Niigata from Kasugayama Castle. The most notable member of the Nagao clan was Nagao Kagetora, later and better known as Uesugi Kenshin. He unified the leaders of Echigo Province and became its sole ruler. By taking the surname Uesugi, he also became the head of the Uesugi clan and effectively brought their realm under his control.\n\nThe city of Niigata is now the third largest Japanese city facing the Sea of Japan, after Fukuoka and Kitakyushu. It was the first Japanese port on the Sea of Japan to be opened to foreign trade following the opening of Japan by Matthew Perry. It has since played an important role in trade with Russia and Korea. A freighter from North Korea visits Niigata once a month, in one of the few forms of direct contact between Japan and that country.\n\nThe Etsuzankai organization, led by the politician Kakuei Tanaka, was highly influential in bringing infrastructure improvements to Niigata Prefecture in the 1960s and 1970s. These included the Jōetsu Shinkansen high-speed rail line and the Kanetsu Expressway to Tokyo.\n\nOn October 23, 2004, the Chūetsu earthquake struck Niigata Prefecture and was measured at Shindo 6+ at Ojiya.\n\nOn January 9, 2006, a heavy winter storm struck the prefecture and its neighbors. At least 71 people died and more than 1,000 were injured. Also in 2006, a massive tsunami and earthquake damaged homes and caused casualties in the maritime areas of Niigata Prefecture, especially near Sado Island.\n\nOn July 16, 2007, another earthquake hit the area.\n\nNiigata Prefecture hosts the Fuji Rock Festival, an annual event held at the Naeba ski resort. The three-day event, organized by Smash Japan, features more than 200 Japanese and international musicians. It is one of the largest outdoor music events in Japan, with more than 100,000 people attending in 2005.\n\nGeography\n\nNiigata Prefecture stretches about 240 km along the Sea of Japan, from the southwest to the northeast, with a coastal plain between the mountains and the sea. It also includes Sado Island. Niigata Prefecture could be placed in either the Hokuriku or the Kōshinetsu, both of which are considered parts of the Chūbu region. The prefecture is generally divided into four geographical areas: Jōetsu region (上越) in the south, Chūetsu (中越) in the center, Kaetsu (下越) in the north, and Sado Island. The mouth of the Shinano River, the longest river in Japan, is located in Niigata Prefecture.\n\nAs of 1 April 2014, 25% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as Natural Parks, namely Bandai-Asahi, Chūbu-Sangaku, Nikkō, and Oze National Parks; Echigo Sanzan-Tadami and Sado-Yahiko-Yoneyama Quasi-National Parks; and thirteen Prefectural Natural Parks.\n\nCities\n\nTwenty cities are located in Niigata Prefecture:\n\nTowns and villages\n\nThese are the towns and villages in each district:\n\nAgriculture, forestry and fishing\n\nThe major industry in Niigata Prefecture is agriculture. Rice is the principal product, and among the prefectures of Japan Niigata is second only to Hokkaidō in rice output. The area around Uonuma is known for producing the Koshihikari variety, widely considered to be the highest-quality rice produced in Japan.\n\nRice-related industries are also very important to the prefectural economy. Niigata Prefecture is known throughout Japan for its high-quality sake, senbei, mochi, and arare. In sake production, the prefecture comes third after Gunma and Kyoto prefectures.\n\nThe prefecture was also the place of origin of the ornamental carp known as koi.\n\nNiigata Prefecture produces the highest volume of azaleas and cut lilies in Japan, and is increasing production of cut flowers and flower bulbs. Along with Toyama Prefecture, it produces the highest volume of tulips in the country.\n\nMining and manufacturing\n\nCrude oil is produced in Niigata Prefecture, although Japan relies heavily on petroleum imported from other countries. Kerosene heaters are also produced for use in the cold Niigata winters.\n\nKinzan, on Sado Island, was an active gold mine until it was closed in 1989.\n\nSanjō and Tsubame produce 9 percent of all the silverware made in Japan. The two cities are second after Osaka in the production of scissors, kitchen knives, and wrenches.\n\nNiigata Prefecture may have been the first area in Japan to produce knitted textiles, although the earliest products may have been imported from China. The nuclear power plant which formerly had highest energy output in the world is located in the tiny village of Kariwa. It has been closed since the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.\n\nDemographics\n\nIn the Census of 2003, Niigata ranked as the 14th most populous.\n\nFood\n\nNiigata is known for the following regional specialities:\n\nUonuma Koshihikari rice\n\nShoyu (soy sauce) and Yofu (western-style) katsudon\n\nShoyu sekihan\n\nNoppe stew\n\nWappa-meshi (seafood and rice steamed in a bamboo basket)\n\nSasa-dango (mochi balls filled with red bean paste, seasoned with mugwort and wrapped in bamboo leaves)\n\nPoppo-yaki (steamed bread flavored with brown sugar)\n\nHegi-soba (soba from the Uonuma and Ojiya areas, which uses a special kind of seaweed)\n\n\"Tsubame-Sanjō ramen\" (ramen made using thick udon-style noodles)\n\nTochio aburage (aburaage is called \"aburage\" in Tochio)\n\nKirazu (dishes using okara)\n\nKakinomoto (edible chrysanthemums)\n\nKanzuri (a special seasoning from Myōkō made by leaving chili peppers exposed on snow, then adding flour, salt and yuzu)\n\nYasuda yogurt\n\nNiigata in popular culture\n\nSnow Country (1947): a novel by Nobel laureate Yasunari Kawabata set in Yuzawa\n\n\"Niigata Snow\": a track on the LP Aida, released by Derek Bailey in 1980\n\nKura: a film and TV series (1995) based on the 1993 book by Tomiko Miyao, an award-winning period piece about a Niigata family and its sake brewery\n\nBlue (1996): a manga about high school girls, set in Niigata City, adapted as a film in 2001\n\nWhiteout: an action film based on a novel published in 1995\n\nUnited States of Tara (2011): a comedy-drama series on Showtime; Kate is about to embark on a trip to teach English in Niigata when a flight attendant tells her that the only thing she will hopefully find in Niigata is \"a life lesson and a bullet train back to Tokyo.\"\n\nTourism and sports\n\nMuch of the tourism in Niigata centers around skiing, especially in the alpine areas of Myōkō and Yuzawa, and going to onsen. Sado Island off the west coast of Niigata is accessible via ferry (taking one to two and a half hours) from Naoetsu or Niigata City.\n\nProfessional sports clubs include Albirex Niigata, a J-League
