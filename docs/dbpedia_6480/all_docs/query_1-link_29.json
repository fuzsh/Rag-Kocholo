The landlocked prefecture is in Kanto in the Tokyo area of central Honshu island and has two districts and, 26 municipalities. Located in the center of the prefecture is the largest open plain in the Kanto region. Shirane (2,578 metres (8,458 feet)), Nantai (2,484 metres (8,150 feet)) and Nasudake (1,917 metres (6,289 ft)) mountain are in the northern part of the area. Kinugawa, Nakagawa, and Watarase River originate in this region, which flow across the Kanto plain before emptying into the Pacific Ocean.\n\nUtsunomiya (100 kilometers north of Tokyo) is the capital and largest city in Tochigi Prefecture, with about 520,000 people. Previously known as Ikebenogo and Otabashi Station, it was an important stop on the road to northeastern Japan and served as a processing center for the grain and tobacco and later manufacturing area of knit goods, wood products, and paper. Today, Utsunomiya is known for gyoza dumplings, available at many specialty restaurants. Oya-ji Temple northwest of the city center, has a huge statue of the goddess Kannon carved from the area’s distinctive green stone. A former underground quarry is home to the Oya History Museum. Utsunomiya Museum of Art exhibits works by Chagall, Klee and other modernists. The ruins of Utsunomiya Castle may be seen on the south side of the city.

Ryuzo Suzuki wrote in the Yomiuri Shimbun: “We entered one by one and went down into darkness. After about 150 meters, orange lights suddenly came on. Spread in front of us was an underground lake in a defunct stone quarry in the Oya district of Utsunomiya. I was taking part in a tour called Ohya Underground, which was launched in 2014 to attract visitors to a former quarry and related sites to which access is usually restricted. Wearing helmets and life jackets, 16 people boarded two inflatable boats before sliding them slowly onto the green surface of the lake. [Source: Ryuzo Suzuki, Yomiuri Shimbun, December 22, 2016]\n\n“The boats cruised along, relying on the pale lights set up on the walls made of what is known as Oya stone. The sound of dripping water echoed through the cold air, while the surrounding walls showed their beautiful surfaces. I felt as if we were in an underground shrine. From 1910, Oya stone was quarried for building materials at this site. After production was shut down in the ’70s, rain and underground water accumulated to create an underground lake, with a depth of more than six meters at some points. There are about 250 defunct stone quarries in and around the Oya district, but it is rare for underground lakes to form in them.\n\n“I guessed the space spreading in front of us measured about seven meters high, 10 meters wide and 50 meters long. “In the old days, stone was quarried by hand,” said guide Tomoji Kamiyama, 39. “To produce a piece of stone measuring 15 centimeters thick, 30 centimeters wide and 90 centimeters long, a craftsman would strike more than 2,000 times with his pickaxe. One worker was able to produce seven or eight such pieces per day.”\n\n“Our boats turned left to cruise deep into the cavern and the ceiling closed in on our heads. We were able to see water droplets on the wall when Kamiyama turned a light on it. “You can see how beautifully and evenly the wall has been pickaxed. This is proof of how skillful the craftsmen were.” Our boats turned to the right and we got off at a landing. Walking on a narrow path for a while, we found natural light coming in from a huge shaft. We got on the boats again and returned to the starting point of the cruise. Kamiyama then guided us to a place where a number of pieces of Oya stone cut to the same size still stood, along with a rest area for craftsmen with helmets and sake bottles on a table...During Oya’s heyday in the 1970s, there were more than 100 quarry operators with nearly 1,700 workers. However, the number of these companies has fallen sharply to just a handful today because they faced the rise of cement and challenges from cheaper imported stone.\n\nThe Ohya Underground tour is run by Chiikikachi Project, a limited liability partnership established by four local companies. It runs about 10 times a month, only after confirming safety using an observation system featuring seismometers. A half-day tour costs ¥7,560 per person and a one-day tour is priced at ¥12,960 per person, including lunch. For details, visit https://enishi-travel.jp/tour/ in Japanese Participants in a one-day tour can also enjoy a French-style lunch.\n\nMashiko\n\ncedars on the road to Nikko\n\nMashiko (110 kilometers north of Tokyo, 25 miles east of Nikko, one hour by bus from Utsunomiya Station) is the home of the distinctive Mashiko-yaki folk pottery, which is admired for its simplicity and fresh beauty. The late Shoji Hamada (1897-1978) introduced Mashiko ware throughout Japan, and today there are some 150 kilns produced pottery that emulates his style. Some of the kilns offer pottery lessons, where people can use the wheel to make a tea cup or tray.\n\nMashiko and Kasama (another pottery town 12 miles from Mashiko) have a combined population of 55,000 people, and have prospered because they are near thick beds of pottery-making clay and pine forests that supply lumber to feed the pottery kilns. The wooded hills around the towns are freckled with traditional black- and blue-tile roof houses.\n\n\"The pottery,\" writes Denise Couture in the New York Times, \"is characterized by a rustic simplicity: hearty forms, uncomplicated designs and glazes whose colors echo the rural landscape — rich reddish brown, derived from local stone, greens and creams made from rice husk ash and brownish-black resembling freshly turned earth.\"\n\nMashiko has about 300 kilns, while Kasama has 170, but Kasama pottery offers a wider range of shapes, colors and materials. Most if the stuff is very expensive. Single tea cups that sell for $50 are not unusual and fine pieces made by well-known potters can go for as much as $40,000. Many of the big kilns welcome guests who want to watch the potters at work.\n\nThere is a good display of works by Hamada and local and foreign ceramics as the Mashiko Reference Collection Museum. It is a 10 minute bus ride from Mashiko Station. The Mashiko Pottery Club, a seven minute walk from the museum, offers classes and allows visitors to use the pottery wheels and tools and materials for a fee. Mashiko’s other museum, Ceramic Art Messe Mashio, contains a Japanese “climbing kiln” and works by Hamada and local and Japanese artists.\n\nJonai-zaka Streets is lined with dozens of pottery shops. Mashiko hosts a pottery fair in early November and early May, when tents selling ceramic are set up all over town. Mashiko is also famous its delicious greenhouse strawberries.

The Tsukuba Space Center opened in 1972 and has special openings of the Kibo Flight Control Room and the Astronaut Training Facility every year. If you are interested in learning about Japanese space development this is one of the best places to do so\n\nThe Tsukuba Space Center is JAXA’s core facility for Japan’s space development. It covers 530,000 square meters and features areas such as the Astronaut Training Facility. The Space Dome, which opened in 2010, comprehensively introduces how satellites and rockets work. The 13 meter Space Chamber is where satellites and rockets are disassembled, and their parts and systems are tested to ensure their endurance in a vacuum and in the thermal environment of space. In the Large Scale Vibration Test Facility satellites or launch vehicles undergo vibration tests by separating them into each unit or system. The Radio Wave Test Facility facility is used to evaluate the conduct radiowave performance of spacecraft, properties tests of antennas and radiowave sensors, and measure their radiowave characteristics.\n\nYusuke Sano wrote in in the Japan News: “First, take a look at Rocket Square outside the dome, where an H-2 rocket is displayed. The H-2, the country’s first fully domestically produced rocket, carried the geostationary meteorological satellite Himawari-5 and other objects into space. The rocket, 50 meters long and four meters in diameter, is not a replica-it was assembled using a test body used when the rocket was developed, and other parts. Even adults will delight in seeing it. The square is also the best spot for a picture. [Source: Yusuke Sanom Japan News, April 18, 2017]\n\n“A one-millionth scale model of the Earth welcomes visitors to the Space Dome. In the middle of the dome there is a full-size replica of the Japanese experiment module Kibo, part of the International Space Station. Kibo’s on-board experiment facility is cylindrical, at 11.2 meters long and 4.4 meters in diameter. The voice of Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata communicating with the Tsukuba Space Center fills the module, making visitors feel as though they have been launched into space.\n\n“Devices and equipment covering the walls, such as a robotic arm, are arranged just as they are in the actual module. Along with the replica module in the dome, the test model of the H-2 Transfer Vehicle Kounotori, which carries supplies to the ISS, is visually appealing, and the one-twentieth scale models of Japanese rockets ranging from the currently active H-2A to the H-3 rocket now under development are spectacular. A shop in a separate building sells ice cream that is not cold. It was made the same way as meals served aboard the ISS, allowing visitors to enjoy a “taste of space.”\n\nThe Space Dome is a popular facility visited by about 300,000 people a year.

The Tomioka Silk Mill was built in 1872 as a government-run factory that served as a model for other mills in Japan, which eventually came to play a leading role in the global silk industry.\n\nThe related sites are the Tajima Yahei sericulture farmhouse in the city of Isesaki, the Takayama-sha sericulture school in the city of Fujioka and the Arafune cold storage for silkworm eggs in the town of Shimonita.\n\nAccording to UNESCO: “This property is a historic sericulture and silk mill complex established in 1872 in the Gunma prefecture north-west of Tokyo. Built by the Japanese Government with machinery imported from France, it consists of four sites that attest to the different stages in the production of raw silk: production of cocoons in an experimental farm; a cold-storage facility for silkworm eggs; reeling of cocoons and spinning of raw silk in a mill; and a school for the dissemination of sericulture knowledge. It illustrates Japan’s desire to rapidly adopt the best mass production techniques, and became a decisive element in the renewal of sericulture and the Japanese silk industry in the last quarter of the 19th century. It marked Japan’s entry into the modern, industrialized era, and propelled it to become the world’s leading exporter of raw silk, notably to France and Italy.\n\n“The Tomioka Silk Mill dates from the early Meiji period. With its related sites including two sericulture schools and an egg storage site, it illustrates the desire of Japan, a traditional silk producer, to rapidly access the best mass production techniques. The Japanese government imported French machinery and industrial expertise to create an integrated system in Gunma Prefecture. It included egg production, silkworm farming and the construction of a large mechanised raw silk reeling and spinning plant. In turn, the Tomioka model complex and its related sites became a decisive component in the renewal of sericulture and the Japanese silk industry, in the last quarter of the 19th century, and a key element in Japan’s entry into the modern industrialised world.\n\n“The Tomioka mill illustrates the early and entirely successful transfer of French industrial sericultural techniques to Japan. This technological transfer took place in the context of a long regional tradition of silkworm farming, which it profoundly renewed. In turn, Tomioka became a centre for technical improvements and a model that enshrined Japan’s role in the global raw silk market at the beginning of the 20th century, and which bears witness to the early advent of a shared international culture of sericulture.\n\n“Tomioka and its related sites form an outstanding example of an integrated ensemble for the mass production of raw silk. The extent of the plant, from its initial design, and the deliberate adoption of the best Western techniques illustrate a decisive period for the spread of industrial methods to Japan and the Far East. Its large, late 19th century buildings provide an eminent example of the emergence of a style of industrial architecture specific to Japan, combining foreign and local elements.\n\nTomioka Silk Mill Tourism and Tours\n\nTomioka Silk Mill Tours became quite popular after it was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Masanao Umezaki wrote in the Yomiuri Shimbun: “The Tomioka Silk Mill is currently the most popular modernization heritage site and is flooded with visitors every day. According to the Tomioka city government, the number of visitors has soared since April, when it became certain the site would be added to the World Heritage list. The registration was officially announced in June, and 110,000 people visited in that month alone.

The town’s central plaza is dominated by the Yubatake, a bizarre-looking aggregate of pools, fountains, waterfalls, chutes and wooden ducts filled with hot, steaming water. More than 37,000 liters of water gushes out the spring ever minute (54 million gallons a day), an amount that far exceeds any other hot spring in Japan. The whole area reeks of sulfurous water but that doesn’t seem to bother the 3 million visitors that flock to the onsen every year.\n\nThe water varies in temperature between 55̊ and 95̊C and has a pH of 1.5, almost equal to gastric acid. The waters contain enough natural chemicals to dissolve a ¥1 coin in a week and produce encrustation of sulfuric geyesite that are collected and sold as souvenirs. For Japanese this also means that water kills bacteria and virus and thus has potent healing powers. There are plans to use electricity-generating turbines to harness steam from the hot springs to generate power for 1,800 households.\n\nThe water flows into dozens of hotels and 18 free public baths. Twelve different kinds of baths are offered: 1) water-striking bath; 2) steam bath; 3) drinking bath; 4) eye-washing bath; 5) shallow bath; 6) deep bath; 7) lukewarm bath; 8) hot bath; 9) cold-and-hot bath; 10) timed bath. The latter is used as a treatment for heart problems, sexually transmitted diseases and other ailments. Bathers must stand for three minutes in very hot 48̊C water and pour water over their head 30 times under the direction of a stern instructor. Before the bath, bathers ritually stir the white, cloudy water while praying and singing special songs. The treatment has reportedly helped paralyzed people walk again.\n\nFor people that want to stay overnight there are cheap inns, Western-style hotels and Japanese-style hotels with long histories. The rates range from $40 to $400 a night. In addition to the baths, there are lots of shops and restaurants. Folklore shows are held four times a day at the Netsuno-yu entertainment hall. Kusatsu Nettaiken is a domed garden, with tropical plants and animals, heated by waters from the spring.\n\nWebsites:Kusatsu Onsen site kusatsu-onsen.ne.jp Map: hotelboun.com Hotel Websites: Ryokan and Minshuku Japanese Guest Houses Japanese Guest Houses Budget Accommodation: Japan Youth Hostels (click hostels for good map and description of hostels) Japan Youth Hostels Check Lonely Planet books Getting There : Kusatsu Onsen is accessible by bus and train from Tokyo.\n\nImage Sources: 1) 2) 8) Visualizing Culture, MIT Education 3) 5) Nikko City 6) 7) Japan National Parks 9) Honda 10) 11) Kusatsu onsen site\n\nText Sources: JNTO (Japan National Tourist Organization), Japan.org, Japan News, Japan Times, Yomiuri Shimbun, UNESCO, Lonely Planet guides, New York Times, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, National Geographic, The New Yorker, Bloomberg, Reuters, Associated Press, AFP, Compton's Encyclopedia and various books and other publications.\n\nUpdated in July 2020"
