        "text": "By plane\n\n[edit]\n\nThe nearest airport is at Niigata, which is a little over an hour away by car. By public transport, take a bus to Niigata station (25 min, ¥410), then take the train or bus (details below).\n\nTokyo's two airports, Narita and Haneda, are both at least three hours away by train.\n\nBy train\n\n[edit]\n\nThe main way into Nagaoka is on the Jōetsu Shinkansen. There is at least one Toki train per hour to Tokyo (about 1hr 40min, ¥8950) and Niigata (25 minutes, ¥3500).\n\nFrom Niigata, one can instead take a local train, which takes about 1hr 15mins and costs ¥1140, or one of the five Shirayuki Limited Express trains a day, which is more expensive (¥2640) but brings the travel time down to about 55 minutes.\n\nJR East offer some deals for travel within Niigata prefecture:\n\nIf you buy an Echigo One-Day Pass at ¥1540, you can save ¥740 on the price of a day trip to Niigata. The ticket is even better value if you use it to go as far as Shibata or Murakami. However, it does not cover the supplementary fare for Shinkansen or Limited Express trains; for this, consider buying the Echigo Ryōkin Kaisūken, which gives you four tickets for travel to or from Niigata on the Shinkansen or Limited Expresses, valid for a month, for ¥3920. (There is no child version of this ticket, but two children aged 6-11 can use one of these tickets).\n\nThe Shinkansen Double Kippu gives you two tickets for the Shinkansen to and from Niigata, again valid for a month, for ¥4200 (¥2100 for children).\n\nFrom Kanazawa and Toyama there used to be a one-seat service to Nagaoka, but this has changed with the opening of the Hokuriku Shinkansen. The fastest way to travel between these areas is to take the Hokuriku Shinkansen's Hakutaka service to Jōetsu-myōkō, and change to the Shirayuki Limited Express which operates five times per day. The journey from Kanazawa using this route takes around 2 hr 20 min and costs ¥8840 each way; from Toyama, 2 hr and ¥7760. If you use a Japan Rail Pass, a small surcharge of ¥450 will have to be paid for the 10-km journey between Jōetsu-myōkō and Naoetsu which operates over non-JR tracks.\n\nBoth the Japan Rail Pass and the JR East Pass (Nagano/Niigata area) fully cover the Shinkansen journey from Tokyo, travel to Narita and Haneda Airports via the Narita Express and Tokyo Monorail, and travel on most trains in Niigata prefecture, amongst other things.\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\n(Where fares are quoted as being 'up to' a price, they are cheaper outside peak periods.)\n\nThe following highway buses serve Nagaoka station each day:\n\nEight buses to Kawagoe station, Nerima station, Ikebukuro station, and Shinjuku, taking 5 hr 30 min and costing up to ¥6900. Jointly operated by Seibu Bus, Echigo Kōtsu and Niigata Kōtsu.\n\nAn overnight bus running to Kyoto station, Kōsoku-Kyōtanabe, Osaka (Osaka station and Namba) and Sakai (Sakai station, Sakai-higashi station and JR Sakaishi station), taking between 7 hr 40 min (to Kyoto) and 10 hr 10 min (to Sakai) and costing up to ¥9520. Jointly operated by Nankai Bus and Echigo Kōtsu. If taking the bus from Kansai, look for the bus to Kashiwazaki, Nagaoka, and Sanjō.\n\nMore than 20 buses to Niigata, taking about 1 hr 20 min and costing ¥980. Jointly operated by Echigo Kōtsu and Niigata Kōtsu.\n\nWiller Express also run buses between Nagaoka and various places in Kantō and Kansai.\n\nThe following serve Nagaoka-Kita Bus Stop on the Hokuriku Expressway, on the way to and from Niigata:\n\n16 buses (14 day, 1 night, 1 ladies-only night) to Kawagoe-Matoba Bus Stop, Nerima, Shimo-Ochiai station, and Ikebukuro, taking 4 hr 20 min and costing up to ¥5700. The night buses also serve Shinjuku. Operated by Seibu Bus, Echigo Kōtsu [dead link] , and Niigata Kōtsu [dead link] .\n\n2 buses (1 day, 1 night) to Meitetsu Bus Center in Nagoya, taking a little over 6 hours and costing up to ¥8200. Operated by Meitetsu Bus and Niigata Kōtsu [dead link] .\n\n4 buses to Nagano station and Gondō, also serving several stops on the Jōshin-etsu Expressway, taking about 2 hr 30 min and costing ¥2470. Operated by Nagaden Bus and Niigata Kōtsu [dead link] .\n\n2 buses to Toyama station, also serving several stops in Toyama and on the Hokuriku Expressway, taking about 2 hr 40 min and costing ¥3290. Operated by Toyama Chitetsu and Niigata Kōtsu [dead link] .\n\n2 buses to Kanazawa station, taking about 3 hr 40 min and costing ¥3810. Operated by Hokuriku Railroad and Niigata Kōtsu [dead link] .\n\nThere are also highway buses to destinations within Niigata Prefecture [dead link] (Tōkamachi, Kashiwazaki, and Jōetsu).\n\nTo get to Nagaoka Station from Nagaoka-Kita Bus Stop, take either one of the highway buses between Niigata and Nagaoka via Chōseibashi (about 20 min, ¥280) or a local bus from Fukumichi-Iriguchi Bus Stop heading into Nagaoka from Fukuto and Wakino-machi (about 25 min, ¥310)."
