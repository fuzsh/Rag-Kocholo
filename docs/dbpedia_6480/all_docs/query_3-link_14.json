        "text": "Japan is an outdoor adventure haven year-round, with plenty of unique spots to practice forest bathing, hiking, and rock climbing in the summer, and amazing powder snow for ski enthusiasts in the winter. If you are traveling to Tokyo and want a fuller flavor of the country, going on a short getaway to visit some of the amazing spots in the mountains, in the forests, and in the countryside will give you a greater scope of what Japan is all about. Plus, the impeccable Japanese railway system will allow you to access these places fairly easily.\n\nBelow, we share some of our favorite summer adventures in Japan near Tokyo, and a few ideas that are a little further away too.\n\nShort Outdoor Adventures on Honshu Island\n\nTokyo is located in the Kantō region in the southeast of the island of Honshu, one of the five main islands of Japan. Honshu is 1,300 km (810 mi) long and 50 to 230 km (31 to 143 mi) wide. It is home to the highest peak in Japan, Mount Fuji, and to the Shinano River, the longest river in the country. Furthermore, the Sea of Japan and the Pacific both lap onto Honshu's shores which are bridged by the Japanese Alps that stretch across the island offering a wide variety of landscapes and terrains for all kinds of adventure sports.\n\nThe Kantō region is one of the 5 regions that the island is divided into and is split into seven prefectures including Tokyo. Although they may be at a relative distance, wilderness areas are easy to reach from the city, due to the great transport system, and are ideal for practicing mountaineering, rock climbing, hiking, rafting, and more.\n\n1. Climbing Mount Fuji\n\nMount Fuji is a national emblem and climbing to the top of Japan's tallest and most sacred peak is an unparalleled experience. Also known as Fuji-san, this beautiful volcano stands at an altitude of 3,776.24 m. (12,389.2 ft), is one of the country's three holy mountains, along with Tateyama and Hakusan, and is a UNESCO World Heritage site, as well as a top spot in Japan to watch the sunrise. The Japanese even have a word, \"Goraiko\", to describe the awe-inspiring sensation of catching the Fuji sunrise.\n\nClimbing Mount Fuji is usually done in the summer season, although off-season climbs, which are slightly more challenging due to the weather, are also an option. On average, most climbs take 2-days. If you are a less experienced climber, you might want to try a 3-day climb, while if you are an expert, you could do it in one.\n\nThere are four routes to the Fuji summit: the Yoshida Trail is the most popular and a favorite for \"Goraiko\", Subarishi is a little longer and less crowded, Gotemba is the longest and most remote, and Fujinomya is the shortest. There are ten stations from the base to the summit and you can climb from station 1 at the base to 10 at the top, or from station 5, which you can drive up or take a bus to.\n\nWe recommend: a 2-day Mount Fuji guided ascent, round trip from Tokyo with Yusuke. Why do we like it? In this program, you will meet the guide in Tokyo and set off to Mount Fuji with him. Before climbing, you also get to stop at the Fuji Shrine to ask for a safe climb, and you can add an optional stop at a Japanese Onsen (hot spring) to recover when you're done. Furthermore, Yusuke offers this program for the extended Fuji season, from April to October.\n\nDuration: On average, 2 days.\n\nLevel: Intermediate, you need a good fitness level to tackle Fuji, but no special technical climbing skills.\n\nOfficial climbing season: 1 July to 14 September.\n\nHow to get to Mount Fuji from Tokyo: Mount Fuji is located around 100 km away from Tokyo, in the Chubu region of Honshu. Options to get there include taking a 2-hour highway bus from Shinjuku, Shibuya, or Tokyo to Kawaguchiko Station (the most popular for Fuji climbs), Fuji-Q Highland, Fuji-San Station or Lake Yamanakako. There is also a wide option of train services to the Fuji region with differences in terms of speed, frequency, and cost.\n\nRead more about climbing Mount Fuji and start planning your Fuji-san climb now!\n\n2. Rock climbing on Mount Ogawa\n\nOne of the best places for rock climbing in Japan is Mount Ogawayama, which lies on the border of Nagano and Yamanashi in the Chubu region. Mount Ogawa, as it is also known, boasts an altitude of 2,418 m (7,933 ft) and has amazing granite slabs, cracks, boulders, and both single and multi-pitch routes for all levels.\n\nThe best time for rock climbing on Mt. Ogawa is during the late summer, from late July to September. Furthermore, weekends can get crowded, so if you go on a weekday, you will enjoy Ogawa's nature more fully.\n\nWe recommend: Crack climbing and Face climbing on Mount Ogawayama with certified guide Masayuki. Why do we like this program? This two-day program focuses on a different rock climbing technique each day and on using the natural features of the rock to help you climb. Furthermore, you can decide to join for just 1 or both of the days.\n\nDuration: Mount Ogawa rock climbing trips are usually 1-day long, although you can also plan for longer adventures and stay in Nagano or at the Ogawa Mawarime Daira campsite.\n\nLevel: There are climbing options for all levels.\n\nMeeting point: JR Kobuchizawa Station which is a 2 and 1/2 hour drive, 3 and 1/2 hour bus ride or a 2-hour train ride away from Tokyo.\n\nHow to get to Mount Ogawa from Tokyo: Mount Ogawa is located in the Nagano prefecture, in the Chūbu region (not to be confused with Ogawa station in Tokyo). The easiest way to get to Mount Ogawa is by taking the Shinkansen Kagayaki train to Nagano, which takes around 1 hour and 1/2, and then from there, take a short taxi ride or make local transport arrangements to the actual mountain. You can also enjoy a 3 and 1/2 hour drive, or a longer 5 to 6-hour bus ride to arrive at Mount Ogawa from Tokyo.\n\n3. Rafting on the Tone River in Minakami\n\nMinakami is a hot spring mountain town in the Gunma prefecture of the Kantō region. Much of Minakami is located in the Jōshin'etsu-kōgen National Park and it is traversed by the Tone River, which is a popular place for rafting and kayaking adventures.\n\nThe Tone River is one of the \"Three Greatest Rivers of Japan\", which is why we decided that rafting down this stunning body of water should make it on our list. The 322-kilometer (200 mi) river has its source near Minakami and its mouth in the Pacific. During the snowmelt season, between May and June, the river swells in the Minakami region and grade 4 rapids stretch for 12 kilometers (7.5 mi). Then, in the later summer months, they calm back down to a grade 2 pace, ideal for beginners.\n\nWe recommend: Beginner pack rafting or advanced pack rafting on the Tone River with JMGA mountain guide Hiroko. Why do we like this program? Hiroko always gets good reviews from Explore-Share clients and her programs will also give you the chance to explore a bit of Minakami and enjoy the hot springs in the region once the proper rafting is done.\n\nDuration: 1 day.\n\nLevel: The Tone River in Minakami has rapids for all levels and you can find both beginner and advanced pack rafting programs.\n\nHow to get to Minakami from Tokyo: Minakami is located in the Gunma prefecture of the Kantō region and takes between 2 and 3 hours to get to from Tokyo. If you take the Shinkansen, you will need to go first to Takasaki and then from there to Minakami.\n\n4. \"Sawanobori\" in the Suzuka Mountains\n\nThe Suzuka Mountains are located in the Mie Prefecture in the Kansai region and are home to the Suzuka Quasi-National Park and the Yunoyama Onsen. The range boasts limestone formations in the north and granite in the south and receives abundant rainfall, which makes it ideal for canyoning, or as the Japanese call it, \"sawanobori\". Furthermore, the range is covered in deep green forests that provide welcome shade in summer and are also the breeding and hunting grounds of stunning wildlife including deer, monkeys, bears, birds, small mammals, and a native mountain goat known as kamoshika. You might just catch sight of some of them as you traverse upstream in search of an emerald-green pool to jump into!\n\nWe recommend: a to1/2 Day Sawanobori Adventure in the Suzuka Mountains guided by JMGA mountain guide Naoki. Why do we like this program? This short and fun adventure will give you an exciting taste of the Japanese waterfalls and pristine nature away from the crowds in an unexpected location.\n\nDuration: Most canyoning programs are short half-day or 1-day adventures.\n\nLevel: All levels, although participants should be at least 15 and if they are minors, accompanied by an adult. Additionally, participants with physical conditions should check with the guide before joining.\n\nMeeting point: Misato Station (Sangi Railway) in the Mie prefecture and you can get there by taking the Shinkansen to Nagoya Station (Kintetsu Nagoya Station) and transferring to the Kintetsu Line. From there, transfer at Kintetsu Tomita Station to Sangi Railway.\n\nHow to get to the Suzuka Mountains from Tokyo: The Suzuka Mountains are located in the Mie Prefecture in the Kansai region, located to the southeast of Honshu. To get there, you need to take the Shinkansen to Nagoya, and from there, transfer to the Kintetsu Line. From there, transfer at Kintetsu Tomita Station to Sangi Railway. In total, it should take around 3 hours, while driving there takes around 4 hours.\n\n5. Cycling in Azumino\n\nRice fields and wasabi farms, sake breweries and silkworms, as well as art galleries, temples, and onsen, come together in Azumino in the Nagano Prefecture, located in the Chūbu region of the Honshu island. This beautiful location on the northwest of the Matsumoto Basin is flanked by mountains to the east and west, and pierced by freshwater rivers and streams clean enough to drink from. The Asumino National Park at the foot of the famous Mount Jōnen, the renowned Daio Wasabi Farm, and Hotaka Shrine are some of the most popular attractions in the region.\n\nCycling in Azumino is a great way to access many of the awe-inspiring landmarks in the area and enjoy the fresh summer air while contemplating the landscapes. It is a popular outdoor adventure in the region that is open to everyone and will give you a taste of the sweetest Japan.\n\nWe recommend: an Azumino Matsukawa half-day cycling tour led by NPOMG hiking guide Yasuyuki. Why do we like this program? Not only will you get to explore rice fields and the Azumino basin, but you will also spend some time learning to cook Japanese rice balls, and then eating them, of course, at the end of your trip.\n\nDuration: The trip lasts 3 and 1/2 hours.\n\nLevel: Everyone is welcome to join.\n\nMeeting point: Shinano-Matsukawa Station.\n\nHow to get to Azumino from Tokyo: Take the Shinkansen from Tokyo to Nagano and from Nagano to Matsumoto and be there in around 2 and 1/2 hours.\n\n6. Hiking in the Northern Japan Alps\n\nJapan is a top hiking destination and the Japan Alps offer a wide variety of options for those who want to spend a few days immersed in nature, exploring flowery fields, and deep green forests, discovering shrines and temples, and relaxing at some of the famous Japanese Onsen.\n\nThe Northern Japan Alps, known as the Hiba Mountains, boast a wide variety of options. Some of the most important hiking areas in the northern strip of the Japan Alps include the Tateyama region, which surrounds the highest of the Hida Mountains. The Tateyama Alpine Route is one of the most popular in Japan and takes you to the summit of this peak, at an altitude of 3,015 m (9,892 ft). In the Hakuba region, you can join the famous Three Peaks of Hakuba trek a.k.a ‘Hakuba-Sanzan**’**, that takes you to the top of Mt Shirouma, Mt Shakushi, and Mt Hakuba-yari. And, the Kamikochi region in the Chūbu-Sangaku National Park is home to the Hotaka Range, among other great trekking locations.\n\nSummer is the perfect season to go trekking in the Japan Alps as the mountains are covered in alpine flowers. The Hiba Mountains are also a top spot for hot springing which is a great way to recover from a long trek.\n\nRead more about hiking in the Japan Alps and start planning your adventure!\n\nWe recommend: a 2-day Mount Maehodaka Hike guided by Junichiro. Why do we like this program? This hike involves some rock as well, and exploring one of the lesser crowded and remote peaks that belong to the Hotaka Range which has been dubbed the \"Leader of the Northern Alps\". Plus, Junichiro always gets a smile out of those who climb with him, as he has a great sense of humor and great English too.\n\nDuration: 2 days\n\nLevel: Beginner/intermediate, no prior technical skills are required but you need to be physically fit.\n\nMeeting point: Kamikochi\n\nHow to get to Kamikochi from Tokyo: Take the Shinkansen from Tokyo to Shinshimashima and a taxi from there. Or take the Shinkansen from Tokyo to Nagano and a bus from there. The total travel time is approximately 4 hours.\n\nTop Outdoor Adventures Outside of Honshu\n\nIf you're up for exploring a bit more of Japan, then heading to some of the country's other islands to explore their awe-inspiring natural and cultural wonders is a good idea. Japan has 5 main islands including Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku, and Okinawa, and in total 6,852 islands!\n\nHokkaido\n\nOf the Japanese main islands, Hokkaido is the northernmost and is framed by the Sea of Japan, the Sea of Okhotsk, and the Pacific Ocean. It is a place of unique natural beauty. The amazing colorful blooms and striking Blue Pond of Biei Town, Japan's largest lavender field, and Daisetsuzan, its largest national park, are all in Hokkaido and make for top options to enjoy the wild outdoors. Rock climbing in Hokkaido is an exciting way to experience both the mainland and the coasts of the island, while hiking is a pleasure on this colorful and vibrant island.\n\nWhile in the Hokkaido region, don't miss the chance to visit Rishiri Island, which is 20km (12 mi) west of its coast and home to Mount Rishiri, a top spot for mountain climbing and hiking.\n\nWe recommend: a Express 4-day hiking tour in Daisetsuzan with Takao. Why do we like this program? Takao is one of our top guides and has a long track record of guiding in Hokkaido, which means he knows the island like the palm of his hand. Going with him on a 4-day adventure in Daisetsuzan will allow you to truly appreciate the beauty of this breathtaking place.\n\nDuration: 4 days\n\nLevel: Intermediate\n\nMeeting point: airport or hotel pickup\n\nHow to get to Hokkaido from Tokyo: Options to get to Hokkaido include taking a 90-minute flight to Sapporo, Hokkaido's capital; taking the Shinkansen to Shin-Hakodate-Hokuto and from there the Hokuto limited express to Sapporo; or taking a ferry from some other Honshu locations to Hokkaido.\n\nYakushima\n\nYakushima is one of the Ōsumi Islands located in the East China Sea to the very south of Japan. It is famous for its inspiring cedar forests and for being home to the largest nesting ground for loggerhead sea turtles in the Pacific. Exploring its World Heritage Site forests is a must for nature lovers.\n\nRead more about hiking in Yakushima and start planning your adventure!\n\nWe recommend: Yakusugi-Land and Mt Tachu Hike with Junichi. Why do we like this trip? Junichi has been living in Yakushima for over twenty years and knows the best places to go. On this tour, he takes you to the island's traditional cedar forests, and also to the lesser-known Mt Tachu away from the crowds. Plus, you can combine this tour with some of his other adventures such as canyoning and kayaking.\n\nDuration: 1 day.\n\nLevel: Basic/intermediate.\n\nMeeting Point: Hotel pick up.\n\nHow to get to Yakushima from Tokyo: Take a 1 and 1/2 hr. flight to Kagoshima first and then approach the island by plane (30 min), high-speed ship (2.30 hrs), or ferry (4 hrs).\n\nDon't want to travel far?
