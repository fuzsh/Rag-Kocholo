Naming

The expressway is named the Dōō Expressway (lit. Central Hokkaidō Expressway) in Japanese, however its official English name is the Hokkaidō Expressway. It is the only national expressway in Japan whose English name is not a direct romanization of the Japanese name.

Officially the expressway is designated as the Hokkaidō Jūkan Expressway.[2]

Overview

The expressway connects the north of Hokkaidō with the south via the city of Sapporo. Extension of the expressway in the north towards the city of Wakkanai and in the south towards the city of Hakodate is underway; although the Hokkaidō Expressway itself is not planned to extend as far as these two cities, various expressway-standard roads (bypasses of National Route 40 to the north and National Route 5 to the south) will cover the remaining distances.

Some unfinished sections of the expressway (Shibetsu-Kenbuchi Interchange to Nayoro Interchange in the north and Ōnuma Interchange to Nanae Interchange in the south) will be constructed according to the New Direct Control System.[3] These sections are expected to operate toll-free upon completion.

The section from Sapporo-minami Interchange through Sapporo Junction to Sapporo-nishi Interchange on the Sasson Expressway is built to an urban expressway standard and tolls are charged at a flat rate. As of March 2008 the toll on this section is 400 yen for regular passenger cars. Tolls on all other sections of the expressway are assessed according to distance travelled in the same manner as most other national expressways.[4]
