Political profile

Edward Garnier is a Conservative MP of a slightly old-fashioned sort - a hunting and shooting barrister rather than a Thatcherite ideologue.

Soon after his election in 1992 he became a Parliamentary Private Secretary to the law officers, and in the Hague Shadow Cabinet became Shadow Attorney General.

He earned wide acclaim for a thoughtful performance in that role, in which he demonstrated his legal expertise without becomingly excessively partisan.

He is on the socially liberal wing of the Conservative party, as befits the only Tory MP who used to work for The Guardian (as a night lawyer).

He is also broadly pro-European, and is a former treasurer of the Macleod Group of Tory MPs.
