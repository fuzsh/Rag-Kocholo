        "text": "PARIS, June 14 - France fell for Pina Bausch's German-based dance company when it first traveled here in 1977. Twenty years later, a different affair began between Ms. Bausch and the Paris Opera Ballet when, for the first time, she allowed a troupe other than her Tanztheater Wuppertal to perform one of her early creations, in that case her raucous rendering of Stravinsky's \"Rite of Spring.\"\n\nIn fact, so happy were choreographer, dancers, public and critics with the experience that she has now introduced another 1975 work to the repertory of the Paris Opera Ballet. With 15 performances of her interpretation of Gluck's opera \"Orfeo ed Euridice,\" at the Palais Garnier here through June 19, the Paris company is still the only one outside Wuppertal to have been entrusted with her work.\n\nThe result has again been hailed. One recent evening, Parisians were heard whispering \"magnifique\" and \"sublime,\" praise echoed by French dance critics. Within the ballet corps, there is similar delight. \"It's so nice dancing Pina that it would be nice to do only this,\" said Eleonora Abbagnato, one of three Eurydices. Kader Belarbi, who dances opposite her as Orpheus, added: \"It's one of the most beautiful experiences I have known.\"\n\nAdmiration is evidently mutual. \"It's a love story with the dancers that began with 'The Rite of Spring,\"' Ms. Bausch said in an interview with Le Figaro. \"Their spiritual openness and their appetite for a profound experience made me want to work again with them. After 'Orfeo ed Euridice,' I still have a strong desire to return here.\"\n\nDance is, of course, only part of the show. Gluck wrote the opera in 1762 to include ballet, but the story of Orpheus' heroic bid to rescue his dead bride, Eurydice, from the underworld is told in recitatives, arias and choruses. And as in George Balanchine's 1936 and Mark Morris's 1996 versions of the work, here again the roles of Orpheus, Eurydice, Cupid and chorus are doubled by dancers and singers.\n\nMs. Bausch has placed the 26-member chorus behind the musicians in the orchestra pit, which has been raised higher than usual for the occasion. (The Balthasar-Neumann Ensemble and Choir are conducted by Thomas Hengelbrock.) But the singing Orpheus, Eurydice and Cupid -- all women -- are onstage and interact with the dancers, creating the impression that while divided in body and voice, each personality is in fact one.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
