        "text": "Brief oral abstracts\n\nFollowing state-of-the-art lectures\n\nThe effect of chlortracycline treatment on enteric bacteria in pigs SoA1.3\n\nDelsol AAa, Anjum Mb, Cooles Sb, Woodward MJb, Roe JMa a Department of Clinical Veterinary Science, University of Bristol, Langford, UK, b Department of Bacterial Diseases, Veterinary Laboratories Agency, New Haw, Addlestone, UK\n\nPurpose: There are concerns within the medical profession that antimicrobial agents used in livestock production contribute to the increased antibiotic resistance observed in zoonotic bacterial pathogens. To minimise this risk, evidence-based control strategies need to be implemented. We investigated the effect of chlortetracycline treatment on a tetracycline resistant population of Salmonella typhimurium DT104 and the commensal Escherichia coli population in pigs.\n\nResults: Our results show that pigs treated with chlortetracycline consistently shed higher numbers of resistant S. typhimurium DT104 than untreated pigs for up to 6 weeks post-treatment. We also identified a 30% increase in E. coli with a chlortetracycline MIC>16 mg/l and a 10% increase in E. coli with an MIC>50 mg/l. These effects persisted for up to 2 weeks post-treatment. The tetracycline resistance gene was characterised by gene probing and PCR. The level of chlortetracycline in the pig faeces, as measured by HPLC, fell below our detection limit 5 days after treatment.\n\nConclusion: This study provides direct evidence that oral administration of chlortetracycline to pigs significantly increases the proportion of resistant enteric bacteria, and this shift in resistance outlasts any residual chlortetracycline in the pig faeces.\n\nAnalysis of Helicobacter pylori resistance to antimicrobial agents in Polish children SoA4.2\n\nDzierzanowska-Fangrat Ka, Rozynek Eb, Celinska-Cedro Dc, Jozwiak Pa, Madalinski Ka, Dzierzanowska Db. a Children's Memorial Health Institute, Clinical Immunology, Warsaw, Poland, b Children's Memorial Health Institute, Clinical Microbiology, Warsaw, Poland, c Children's Memorial Health Institute, Gastroenterology, Warsaw, Poland\n\nBackground: Helicobacter pylori resistance to antimicrobial agents is an important factor compromising the efficacy of therapy. Since initial treatment for H. pylori infection is often empirical, therefore it is very important to monitor the local resistance pattern. Objectives: The aims of our study were: to determine the prevalence of H. pylori resistance to clarithromycin, metronidazole and amoxycillin in children prior to eradication therapy, and to detect mutations responsible for clarithromycin resistance. Material and methods: During 2000–2001, 57 H. pylori strains were isolated from gastric biopsies. Susceptibility to antimicrobials was determined by the E-test. Mutations in the 23S rRNA gene associated with clarithromycin resistance were analysed by PCR-RFLP and direct sequencing. Results: Overall, 24 strains (42%) were resistant to metronidazole, 25 strains (44%) were resistant to clarithromycin, and 14 strains (25%) were simultaneously resistant to both drugs. All cultured isolates were sensitive to amoxicillin. Primary resistance to clarithromycin was mainly associated with an A2143G mutation in the 23S rRNA gene of H. pylori. However, isolates containing an A2142G mutation had higher MICs of clarithromycin. Conclusion: Our results show the high prevalence of H. pylori resistance to clarithromycin in Polish children, which implies a need for pretreatment susceptibility testing.\n\n23S rRNA genotype in Helicobacter pylori strains resistant to clarithromycin in children SoA4.3\n\nAlarcon T, Vega AE, Domingo D, Lopez-Brea M. H.U. la Princesa, Microbiology, Madrid, Spain\n\nObjectives: To study the primary resistance to clarithromycin (CLA) in children, to analyse the point mutations associated with CLA resistance and to compare these data with the resistance obtained from adults.\n\nMethods: Thirty-six resistant strains from children and 30 from adults were obtained from gastric biopsies. In vitro susceptibility to CLA was determined by an agar dilution method. DNA from the isolates was extracted by the Ge and Taylor method. A2142G and A2143G mutations were determined by PCR-RFLP (Versalovic, 1996). A 1.4 kpb of the 23S rRNA gene was amplified and digested with BsaI or MboII.\n\nResults: The MICs obtained from children strains were: five with MIC 1.5–2 mg/l; four with MIC 4 mg/l; nine with MIC 8 mg/l; nine with MIC 16 mg/l; six with MIC 32 mg/l and three with MIC 64 mg/l and the MICs obtained from adults were: 12 with MIC 8 mg/l; eight with MIC 16 mg/l; seven with MIC 32 mg/l and three with MIC 64 mg/l. The A–G transition mutation at position 2143 was higher in children (80.55%) that in adult patients (46.66%) (P<0.05); while at position 2142 was higher in adults than in children, 36.66 vs 5.55% (P<0.05).\n\nConclusion: The prevalence of the A2143G>A2142G mutation in H. pylori population of children showed significant statistical differences respecting to H. pylori isolates of adult patients. A higher level of resistance (16–64 mg/l) in children was observed when A–G mutation in 2143 was detected. However, in adult patient higher MICs were observed when mutation in 2142 (A–G) was detected.\n\nContribution of rdxA and frxA mutations to metronidazole resistance in Helicobacter pylori : an examination of multiple-isolate patient sets SoA4.4\n\nChisholm SA, Owen RJ. Central Public Health Laboratory, Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens, London, UK\n\nPurpose: Mutations in rdxA and frxA genes, encoding NADPH nitroreductase and NADPH flavin oxidoreductase, respectively, reportedly lead to metronidazole (Mtz) resistance in Helicobacter pylori. As no single mutation type has been identified that directly correlates with resistance acquisition, we examined rdxA and frxA in paired Mtz sensitive (S) and resistant (R) isolates and in mixed Mtz-S/R strain populations. Isolates from nine dyspeptic patients that had different Mtz susceptibilities (S and R) before and after therapy and mixed Mtz-S/R subpopulations that were separated were tested. Both rdxA and frxA from each isolate population was sequenced. Results: Several different mutations were identified in rdxA, but rarely in frxA, of Mtz-R strains (post-treatment) that were absent in matched Mtz-S strains (pre-treatment). In contrast, sequences from pre-treatment Mtz-R sub-populations were identical to Mtz-S strains in 5/9 cases for rdxA and in 8/9 cases for frxA. Conclusions: Data suggest mutations in rdxA were not always essential for acquisition of Mtz resistance. Observed mutations in the post-treatment Mtz-R isolates may therefore be coincidental and not contributing to the Mtz-R phenotype. For most strains, frxA mutations were not a factor in Mtz resistance of these isolates. Other mechanisms therefore may contribute to Mtz resistance in H. pylori.\n\nAccuracy of 23S ribosomal RNA gene mutation analysis for predicting high level clarithromycin resistance in Helicobacter pylori in the United Kingdom SoA4.5\n\nElviss NC, Owen RJ. Central Public Health Labortory, Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens, London, UK\n\nPre-treatment resistance of Helicobacter pylori to clarithromycin (CLA) and metronidazole (MTZ) is a key factor in eradication therapy failure. Adenine (A) to guanine (G) or A to cytosine (C) mutations at nucleotide 2142, or A to G at 2143 in the 23S rDNA confer in vitro CLA resistance. Our aims were to determine if mutation type and high level CLA resistance was linked and to test for cross-associations with high level MTZ resistance. One thousand one hundred and fifty-one UK isolates from routine endoscopies were tested for susceptibility to CLA and MTZ using E-test. PCR-RFLP identified rDNA mutations in the 92 CLA resistant isolates using MboII and BsaI, respectively for the A2142G and A2143G mutations, and by PCR assay for the A2142C mutation. Mutation frequency was: A2142G, 22.8%; A2143G, 63.0%; and A2142C, 3.3%. In addition, 3.3% were heterozygous for A2142G and A2143G. No mutation was detected in 7.6% of resistant strains (confirmed by sequencing). High level CLA resistance (MIC >256 μg/ml) occurred in 43.3% strains representing 17/21 A2142G mutations. Fifty-six isolates were both CLA and MTZ resistant, of these 30 strains had high level CLA resistance and 27 high level MTZ resistance. No single mutation predominated in dual resistant strains. Our findings indicate that an A2142G mutation predicts a 81.4% likelihood of high level CLA resistance. Our mutation assays provide a specific basis to obtain CLA resistance data for treatment and surveillance.\n\nReal-time PCR detection of 23S rDNA mutations conferring clarithromycin resistance in Helicobacter pylori using the Roche LightCycler SoA4.6\n\nLawson AJ, Elviss NC, Owen RJ. Central Public Health Laboratory, Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens, London, UK\n\nHelicobacter pylori colonizes the gastric mucosa of ∼50% of the worlds human population. In a significant subgroup of infected hosts, H. pylori is associated with the aetiology of a number of gastric diseases, most notably gastric and duodenal ulceration. The macrolide antibiotic clarithromycin is a key component of many combination therapies used to eradicate H. pylori infection. However, resistance to clarithromycin is an important cause of treatment failure. Clarithromycin resistance is associated with mutations in 23S rRNA nucleotides 2142 and 2143 that inhibit the binding of the drug to the ribosome. A rapid, real-time PCR assay for the detection of 23S rDNA mutations conferring clarithromycin resistance was developed using the Roche LightCycler. The assay utilized a pair of biprobes, one specific for the A2142G mutation and one for the wild type sequence (A2142C and A2143G mutations were detected by characteristic reduction in biprobe Tm). The PCR assay was applied to DNA extracted from 150 selected H. pylori isolates from UK patients and identified the 23S rDNA as wild type (45), A2142G (17), A2142C (3), A2143G (70) and heterozygous (15). These results correlated (95%) with those obtained by disk diffusion sensitivity testing and PCR-RFLP based methodologies. The LightCycler assay was successfully applied to DNA extracted from 20 gastric biopsy samples, thus offering the potential to inform patient management without the necessity of culture.\n\nEfficacy and tolerability of different triple macrolide-containing anti- Helicobacter pylori treatment regimens in children SoA4.7\n\nGratsianskaya ANa, Belousov YBa, Safonov ABb, Semin SGb, Semina SVb, Tatarinov PAa. a Russian State Medical University, Clinical Pharmacology, Moskva, Russian Federation, b Russian State Medical University, Children Diseases, Moskva, Russian Federation\n\nPurpose of this open, non-randomized study was to compare efficacy and tolerability of five triple macrolide-containing anti-Helicobacter pylori treatment regimens in children with upper gastrointestinal tract disorders. Methods: Eighty-one patients aged from 9 to 15 years with endoscopically confirmed H. pylori-associated (by urease test and PCR) upper gastrointestinal tract disorders were divided into five comparable groups treated with: roxithromycin, metronidazole, omeprazole—RMO-group (15); clarithromycin, metronidazole, omeprazole—CMO-group (18); azithromycin, amoxicillin, omeprazole—AAmO3-group (15); azithromycin, furazolidone, omeprazole—AFO-group (16); azitromycin, amoxicillin, omeprazole—AAmO7-group (17). RMO, CMO, AFO regimens were 7 days long; AAmO3—3 days long; AAmO7—7 days long, but azythromycin was given during first 3 days only. Results: In 6 weeks after completion of treatment H. pylori eradication (by urease test and PCR) was achieved in 60 (9/15), 94.4 (17/18), 46.7 (7/15), 75 (12/16) and 88.2% (15/17) in groups RMO, CMO, AAmO3, AFO, AAmO7, respectively. Mild gastrointestinal side effects were recorded in 6.7 (1/15), 11.1 (2/18), 12.5 (2/16), 13.3 (2/15), 17.6% (3/17), in groups RMO, CMO, AAmO3, AFO, AAmO7, respectively without significant difference between groups (P>0.05) and with no treatment discontinuation. Conclusion: CMO, AFO and AAmO7 regimens are well-tolerated and more effective (without significant difference between them, P>0.05).\n\nHelicobacter pylori culture and histological susceptibility from pediatric patients with gastrointestinal tract disorders SoA4.8\n\nAlabaz Da, Yýlmaz HLa, Tuncer Rb, Kocabaþ Ea, Uguz Ac, Alhan Ea, Aksaray Na. a Department of Pediatric Infection, University of Cukurova, Adana, Turkey, b Department of Pediatric Surgery, University of Cukurova, Adana, Turkey, c Department of Patology, University of Cukurova, Adana, Turkey\n\nHelicobacter pylori (Hp), that effects half of the population, is known to be an etiological agent of chronic gastritis and peptic ulcer disease. Childhood appears to be a high risk period for H. pylori infection.\n\nThe children included to the study had admitted to the hospital with upper gastrointestinal tract disorders. All underwent biopsies for histology, while undergoing an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and also detected for H. pylori antigens in stools (HpSA) and anti-Hp anticors in blood using serology.\n\nNineteen children (aged between 1.5 and 5 years) were included in the study. The application symptoms in the children were recurrent abdominal pain (100%), nausea-vomiting (84.2%), anorexia (94.7%), weight lose (94.7%), regurgitation (21%), dyspepsia (73.6%), GIS bleeding (2%) and anemia (68.4%).\n\nThe diagnosis were chronic gastritis in nine, duodenitis in four and both gastritis and duodenitis in six patients. Sixteen patients were Hp-positive in the stool test and 11 patients had evidence of H. pylori seropositivity.\n\nBased on these results, the Hp stool test has a sensitivity of 96%. The HpSA is a non-invasive test that can be easily performed in all routine laboratories and can be used in epidemiological studies.\n\nClinical significance of Helicobacter pylori detection in gastric juice by polimerase chain reaction in children SoA4.9\n\nSemin SGa, Gratsianskaya ANb, Semina SVa, Scherbakov PLa, Schipulin GAa, Belousov YBb, Safonov ABb, Filin VAa. a Russian State Medical University, Children Diseases, Moskva, Russian Federation, b Russian State Medical University, Clinical Pharmacology, Moskva, Russian Federation\n\nPurpose of the study was to evaluate clinical significance of Helicobacter pylori detection in gastric juice by polimerase chain reaction (PCR) in children with upper gastrointestinal tract disorders.\n\nMethods: Two groups of patients aged from 9 to 15 years (mean age 13.5 years) were included. I Group—20 children with chronic gastritis before anti-H. pylori treatment. II Group—20 children in 6 weeks after the end of anti-H. pylori treatment. During endoscopy performed to all children, gastric juice and antral biopsy (I group) or gastric juice, antral and fundal biopsies (II group) for PCR were taken.\n\nResults: In I group H. pylori presence in gastric juice was obtained in 80% (16/20) patients and in antral biopsy specimens—in 18/20 (90%) patients; in II group H. pylori presence in gastric juice and in antral biopsy specimens was not obtained (0/20), but in fundal biopsy specimens H. pylori presence was obtained in 4/20 (20%) patients.\n\nConclusion: There was no significant difference in PCR susceptibility in gastric juice and in antral biopsies (P>0.05). Thus, gastric juice, which extraction is less traumatic, then biopsy, may be used for H. pylori detection, but not for eradication control in children.\n\nLeucocytes in Helicobacter pylori infections SoA4.10\n\nOzyilkan Ea, Yilmaz ASb, Sezer Sc, Akbulut Sc, Ustun Hd. a Ankara State Hospital, Gastroenterology, Ankara, Turkey, b Ankara State Hospital, Hermatology, Ankara, Turkey, c Ankara State Hospital, Internist, Ankara, Turkey, d Ankara State Hospital, Phatology, Ankara, Turkey\n\nHelicobacter pylori (H. pylori) has generally been accepted as a pathogen in gastritis, peptic ulcer, gastric cancer and mucosa associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relation between H. pylori infection and white blood cell (WBC) counts and leucocyte subgroups.\n\nA total of 81 subjects (52 female and 29 male) with dyspepsia were evaluated by upper gastrointestinal system endoscopy (CH-2 Olympus). Histopathological assessment for H. pylori was conducted using biopsy samples from antrum and corpus. Biopsy specimens were also evaluated for local neutrophil and mononuclear cell infiltrations. WBC count was analysed by Coulter GEN System. Peripheral blood smears were stained by May Grünwald and examined by an experienced haematologist.\n\nH. pylori infection was detected in 67 subjects. There was no significant difference in age, sex, and smoking habits between H. pylori positive and negative patients (P>0.05). We did not find difference in total WBC counts, neutrophil, monocyte, lymphocyte, and basophil counts between H. pylori positive and negative cases (P>0.05). Peripheral blood eosinophil counts were significantly increased in H. pylori negative subjects compared to positive subjects (P<0.01). Superficial and lamina propria neutrophil grades, intraepithelial lymphocyte grades, and lamina propria eosinophil grades in antral biopsy specimens were found increased in H. pylori positive patients compared to negatives (P<0.001).\n\nWe concluded the H. pylori is a local infection and does not affect peripheral blood total WBC counts and differentials. The statistically found difference in eosinophil counts could not be explained and must be further evaluated in larger patient groups.\n\nDistribution of Streptococcus pyogenes M types in Spain by sequencing emm -specific PCR products and its relationship with erythromycin susceptibility SoA5.2\n\nAlberti Sa, Garcia-Rey Cb, Aguilar Lb, Cercenado Ec, Gobernado Md, Garcia-Perea Ae, the Spanish Surveillance Group for Respiratory Pathogensf. a Medical Department, Hospital Son Dureta, Research Unit, Palma de Mallorca, Spain, b GlaxoSmithKline, Tres Cantos, Madrid, Spain, c Microbiology Department, Hospital Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain, d Microbiology Department, Hospital La Fe, Valencia, Spain, e Microbiology Department, Hospital La Paz, Madrid, Spain, f Spain\n\nIntroduction: The prevalence of erythromycin resistance (ER-R) in group A streptococci (GAS) has increased in Spain since early 90s with current rates exceeding 40% in some regions. This study determined the emm-types associated to erythromycin resistance in Spain.\n\nMaterial and methods: Isolates belonged to the SAUCE* surveillance collection. Rapid sequence analysis of specific PCR products was used to deduce emm-types corresponding to the majority of the known GAS M serotypes. PCR primers used: GASM1 (5′-TATTGCGCTTAGAAAATTAA-3′) and GASM2 (5′-GCAAGTTCTTCAGCTTGTTT-3′). Sequencing was done with the Big Dye terminator mix and autosequenator (Applied Biosystems). DNA sequences were subjected to homology searches against the bacterial DNA database.\n\nResults: Overall, 670 GAS isolates (345 ER-R) were analysed. Three M-types (M4, ST1812 and M12) accounted for 66.4% of the ER-R isolates, whereas they just represented a 16.7% of the Ery-S. For ER-R isolates the strongest association was seen with M4 (OR=12; 95% CI 6.7–22.1), and M75 was second after M4 only in the last temporal period of the study (1998–1999). No homogeneous distribution of ER-R M-types by centres was seen.\n\nConclusions: Few M-types (leading by M4) are responsible for the ER-R in Spain. But for M4, the remaining ER-R M types (ST1815, M12 and M75) did not show a temporally nor geographically homogeneous distribution.\n\n*SAUCE is an acronym standing for ‘Sensibilidad a los Antimicrobianos Utilizados en la Comunidad en Espana' (Susceptibility to the Antimicrobials Commonly Used in the Community in Spain) and is the Spanish word for the willow tree.\n\nSignificant increase in the prevalence of erythromycin-resistant, clindamycin and miocamycin-susceptible (M-Phenotype) Streptococcus pyogenes in Spain (1998–2001) SoA5.3\n\nAlós JI, Aracil B, Oteo J, Gómez-Garcés JL, I Spanish Group IAP-SEIMC. Hospital de Móstoles, Servicio de Microbiología, Madrid, Spain\n\nUsing the standard agar dilution method we studied the prevalence of susceptibility to 14, 15, and 16-membered macrolides, and clindamycin in Streptococcus pyogenes isolated in Spain in 2001 in 21 laboratories. We also determined the different susceptibility phenotypes. The results were compared with those obtained by the same methodology in 1998 (Alós et al. J Antimicrob Chemother 2000;45:605–609). A total of 529 nonduplicated isolates was used. Throat swab samples provided 383 (72.4%). One hundred and fifty-seven (29.7%) was resistant to erythromycin (MIC breakpoint 1 μg/ml). Resistance to azithromycin, a 15-membered macrolide, was also 29.7%, whereas to miocamycin, a 16-membered macrolide, this was 1.5%. Prevalence of resistance to clindamycin was 1.3%. One hundred and forty-nine (94.9%) of the 157 erythromycin-resistant strains were susceptible to clindamycin and miocamycin, a 16-C membered macrolide (M-phenotype). The remaining eight erythromycin-resistant strains had an MLSB phenotype. If we compared the results obtained in 1998 and 2001 we observed a statistically significant increase in the prevalence of resistance to erythromycin and azithromycin (P=0.02, χ 2-test). Our study provides one of the highest erythromycin resistance, clindamycin and miocamycin susceptibility rates for a country in the world for S. pyogenes. Strains with the M-phenotype account for the great majority of these isolates, and have significantly increased since 1998.\n\nMacrolide, lincosamide, oxazolidinone and ketolid resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae SoA5.4\n\nKöseoðlu Ö, Özenen Ý, Hasçelik G, Sener B. Department of Clinical Microbiology, Hacettepe University Medical Faculty, Ankara, Turkey\n\nPenicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains are frequently resistant to other unrelated antimicrobials and resistance to macrolides is also emerging.\n\nIn this study, the in-vitro activities of penicillin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, clindamycin, linezolid and telithromycin were tested against 264 S. pneumoniae isolates. Susceptibility testing was carried out by agar dilution, according to NCCLS guidelines. The overall intermediate+resistance rates, MIC50 and MIC90 (μg/ml) values were as follows, respectively: penicillin 44.7, 0.06, 1%; erythromycin 16.3, 0.125, 4%; clarithromycin 14.1, 0.125, 4%; clindamycin 15.2, 0.125, 16%; telithromycin 1.2, 0.03, 0.125%. For linezolid MIC range was 0.03–16 μg/ml, MIC50 1 μg/ml, MIC90 2 μg/ml. Among the erythromycin resistant 42 isolates, five were susceptible to clarithromycin, 15 susceptible or intermediate to clindamycin, all except one were susceptible to telithromycin.\n\nAccording to these results telithromycin seems to have the best in-vitro activity against macrolide resistant pneumocci.\n\nAddition of fusidic acid in bone cement to systemic teicoplanin treatment of rat osteomyelitis SoA6.3\n\nErsoz Ga, Oztuna Vb, Coskun Bc, Eskandari MMb, Bayarslan Ca, Kaya Aa. a Faculty of Medicine, Mersin University, Clinical Microbiology and Infectious diseases, Icel, Turkey, b Faculty of Medicine, Mersin University, Orthopaedic Surgery, Icel, Turkey, c Faculty of Medicine, Mersin University, Histology and Embryology, Icel, Turkey\n\nThis study investigates the effect of local fusidic acid in bone cement besides systemic teicoplanin therapy in rat osteomyelitis model. Methicilline-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was given on cortex of tibia of rats, then foreign bodies were placed on cortices. Macroscopic and microbiologic evaluation of infected areas was performed at 21st day. CMW1 bone cements, which contained fusidic acid at 1/10 g ratio, were administered proximal to the area where foreign bodies placed in 15 rats. Other 15 rats were used as the control group. Teicoplanin was given intramuscularly at 20 mg/kg/day doses bid for 14 days in both groups. At the end of treatment, rats were sacrificed and infected tibias were examined macroscopically, microbiologically and histopathologically. Ten rats were excluded because of no growth or polimicrobial growth. Intramedullar polimorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration, granulation tissue at surrounding soft tissues and bone marrow vasculature were evaluated histopathologically. Statistical analyses were performed using Fisher's exact test. Recovery rates were 81.8% in teicoplanin+fusidic acid group and 55.6% in teicoplanin only group (P=0.33). There were no significant differences between study and control groups with respect to histopathologic changes. In conclusion, local fusidic acid besides the systemic teicoplanin therapy for osteomyelitis caused by prosthesis has no significant therapeutic effect.\n\nFunction of the transmembrane domain of VanT serine racemase from vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus gallinarum BM4174 SoA7.2\n\nArias CAa, Pena Ja, Reynolds PEb. a Bacterial Molecular Genetics Unit, Centro de Investigaciones, Universidad El Bosque, Bogota, D.C., Colombia, b Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK\n\nPurpose of study: Investigation of the role of the transmembrane domain of VanT.\n\nMethods: Enterococcus gallinarum BM4175 (a vancomycin-susceptible derivative with insertional inactivation of the vanC-1 gene) was transformed with plasmid constructs pJP1 (containing the genes necessary for resistance, C1-XYc-T) or pJP2 (with a fragment lacking the transmembrane region of VanT-C1-XYc-δT-). Minimal inhibitory concentrations and analysis of accumulated peptidoglycan precursors were performed on BM4175, BM4175/pJP1 and BM4175/pJP2 grown in the presence of l-Ser, d-Ser or in the absence of any supplement. Uptake of 0.1 mM [14C]-l-serine was determined in all strains over a 240 s time course.\n\nResults: Vancomycin resistance was restored in BM4175 transformed with pJP1(C1-XYc-T). Peptidoglycan precursors were similar to those in BM4174 under all conditions. pJP2(C1-XYc-δT) failed to restore resistance in BM4175. Pentapeptide[d-Ser] was detected only when l-Ser (50 mM) was present in the growth medium. A 40% decrease in uptake of [14C]-l-Ser at 240 s was observed in BM4175 compared to BM4174. pJP1 restored uptake of [14C]-l-Ser at 240 s in BM4175 similar to values obtained with BM4174, whereas pJP2 did not have any effect.\n\nConclusions: The results indicate that the transmembrane domain of VanT is necessary for resistance and that it is likely to function as an l-Ser transporter.\n\nInfluence of conjugative plasmids from Enterococcus faecium on the outcome of typing methods SoA7.3\n\nWerner Ga, Willems RJLb, Hildebrandt Ba, Klare Ia, Witte Wa. a Department of Nosocomial Infections, Robert Koch Institute, Wernigerode Branch, Germany, b Research Laboratory for Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Public Health and the Environment, Bilthoven, The Netherlands\n\nPurpose: A variety of methods is used for a molecular typing of Enterococcus spp. and related gram-positive bacteria. These include DNA-based methods such as macrorestriction analysis using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), ribotyping, and amplification-based methods such as rapid amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP). We used a homogeneous strain collection of 24 transconjugants resulting from filter-matings with different antibiotic-resistant E. faecium and a recipient isolate from our lab. The influence of transferred antibiotic-resistance determinants on the outcome of different typing methods was investigated. Results: Fragment patterns resulting from PFGE indicated minor differences between the transconjugants and the recipient. In respect to different primers used for RAPD, none or only a single fragment shift was detected in the resulting fragment patterns. AFLP clusters all transconjugants into a group of major relatedness, but the result was strongly dependent on the mathematical method used for cluster analysis. Fragment patterns of digested plasmids showed the possession of different or only widely related plasmids in the transconjugants. Conclusions: The results of this study clearly show that under certain situations typing methods commonly used for enterococci and related gram-positive bacteria come to their limits.\n\nBacteremia due to vancomycin resistant enterococci in Slovakia SoA7.4\n\nHanzen Ja, Roidova Ab, Trupl Jb, Bilikova Ec, Lamosova Jd, Liskova Ae, Macekova Jf, Szevenyova Zg, Svetlansky Ie, Krcmery Vc. a Department of microbiology, University Hospital, Bratislava, Slovakia, b Department of microbiology, St. Elizabeth Cancer Institute and National Cancer Institute, Bratislava, Slovakia, c Department of Pharmacology, St. Elizabeth Cancer Institute, Bratislava, Slovakia, d Department of Pharmacology, National Institute of Respiratory Diseases, Bratislava, Slovakia, e Department of Microbiology, University Hospital, Nitra, Slovakia, f Department of Microbiology, University Hospital, Trnava, Slovakia, g Department of Microbiology, University Hospital, Kosice, Slovakia\n\nMethods: We performed a nation-wide survey of enterococcal bacteremia. All 132 episodes of enterococcal bacteremia between 3 years (1997–1999) in all six University Hospitals were described by a prospective protocol. Enterococci were tested in six laboratories and reconfirmed in National Reference Laboratory of Antibiotic Resistance of the Ministry of Health. National Committee for Clinical and Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) recommended disk diffusion method for testing of antibiotics was used in all local and in the reference laboratory. Strains from blood cultures were isolated through semi-automated system Bactec or Bact-Alert (Becton–Dickinson) and identified with Vitek Jr. system (Bio Mérieux, Hazelwood, MU, USA). Enterococcus faecium were reconfirmed with API 20 STREP (Bio Mérieux, Mercy Etoile, France). We used univariate analysis to assess risk factors for enterococcal bacteremia. Results: Among 132 enterococcal bacteremias, VRE appeared in 6.8% and teicoplanin resistance in 5.3% of all enterococcal bloodstream isolates (88.6% E. faecalis, 9.1% E. faecium, 4.3 E. gallinarum). However, vancomycin resistance in E. faecium was 33.3% and teicoplanin resistance 16.7%. Also resistance to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, ampicillin and gentamicin was higher among E. faecium than in E. faecalis. Conclusion: In conclusion, VRE among enterococci is increasing also in CEE from 0.1 to 6.8%. Our survey showed 6.8% vancomycin resistance and 5.3% teicoplanin resistance among bloodstream isolates.\n\nThe incidence of the CTX-M-15 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) in Poland SoA8.2\n\nBaraniak Aa, Fiett Ja, Nordmann Pb, Gniadkowski Ma. a Sera and Vaccines Central Research Laboratory, Molecular Microbiology, 00725 Warsaw, Poland, b Hopital de Bicetre, Faculte de Medecine Paris-Sud, 94275 Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France\n\nCTX-M-15 was recently identified in Enterobacteriaceae isolates in India and demonstrated the increased activity against ceftazidime when compared to other CTX-M enzymes. CTX-M-15 differs by a single amino acid (ABL238 aspartate to glycine) from CTX-M-3, which is widely spread in Poland. In this work, the first CTX-M-15 producers from Polish hospitals were analyzed. Eighteen cefotaxime-resistant, ESBL-producing enterobacterial isolates were collected in 1998 and 2000 in two hospitals in different cities. The majority of them expressed CTX-M-3 but a single Escherichia coli isolate from one center, and two Serratia marcescens isolates from the other produced CTX-M-15. These isolates demonstrated clearly higher ceftazidime MICs than CTX-M-3 producers, which was also observed when the transconjugants were compared. Apart from the coding sequence mutation, the E. coli blaCTX-M-15 gene differed from blaCTX-M-3 only by a single mutation in the upstream region of approximately 350 bp. Although the isolates were discriminated from CTX-M-3-producing E. coli and S. marcescens isolates from the same and other hospitals, they contained plasmids that were related to blaCTX-M-3-carrying molecules. CTX-M-15 probably appeared in the hospitals due to independent events of convergent evolution, which modified CTX-M-3 into an enzyme with a significant ceftazidime-hydrolyzing activity. This data, together with other recent findings, demonstrate the danger of the use of ceftazidime against CTX-M-producing strains.\n\nAntimicrobial resistance and molecular epidemiology of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia SoA8.3\n\nKöseoölu Öa, Sener Ba, Gür Db, Günalp Aa. a Department of Clinical Microbiology, Hacettepe University Medical Faculty, Ankara, Turkey, b Hacettepe University Medical Faculty, Yhsan Doöramacy Children's Hospital, Ankara, Turkey\n\nNosocomial colonization and subsequent infection by multiresistant strains of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia have resulted in outbreaks that require epidemiologic characterization. The specific aim of this study was to determine the genetic relatedness between S. maltophilia strains isolated from our paediatric wards to compare these genotypes with the antibiotic susceptibility patterns.\n\nA total of 38 S. maltophilia strains were included to the study. The in-vitro susceptibilites were determined by agar dilution method, according to NCCLS guidelines. The genotypes of the isolates were included by ERIC-PCR.\n\nThe rates of resistance, when intermediate concentrations included, were as follows: piperacillin 86.9%, piperacillin/tazobactam 73.7%, ceftriaxone 97.4%, ceftazidime 50%, cefepime 81.6%, ciprofloxacine 97.4%, imipenem 97.4%, meropenem 39.5%, amikacin 73.7%, gentamycin 68.4% and trimetophrim/sulfamethoxazole 5.3%. The strains revealed 11 different susceptibility patterns. When these phenotypically similar isolates were genotype, 25 different DNA patterns existed, indicating the presence of many patient-unique strains, but also clustering of infections due to isolates of the same DNA type.\n\nThe results suggested possible nosocomial transmission of S. maltophilia, indicating the need to enforce infection control and antimicrobial use policies to limit the spread of S. maltophilia.\n\nImipenem resistance in infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Greek hospitals SoA8.4\n\nGiakkoupi Pa, Vatopoulos Ab, Tzouvelekis Lc, Tsonas Sb, Legakis Nc, I WHONET networkb, Petrikkos Ga. a Medical School, Athens University, Infectious Diseases and Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, Athens, Greece, b Medical School, Athens University, Hygiene and Epidemiology, Athens, Greece, c Medical School, Athens University, Microbiology, Athens, Greece\n\nData from the Greek System for the Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance (WHONET, Greece) revealed that imipenem resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa are isolated all over Greece with increasing frequency (from 4.7% in 1996, up to 12.1% in 2001 [January–June]). In this study the possible contribution of VIM metallo-â-lactamases in the increase of imipenem resistance in P. aeruginosa is investigated. All imipenem resistant strains of P. aeruginosa isolated during a 1-month period (May 2001) in the hospitals of the System were collected and tested for the presence of blaVIM and the respective integron by PCR. VIM(+) strains were typed by Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. Seventeen laboratories from all over Greece participated in this study and 59 multiresistant P. aeruginosa strains were isolated. Strains resistant to imipenem were always found resistant to meropenem, penicillins/inhibitors and aminoglycosides. Moreover, resistance to ceftazidime, aztreonam and cefepime was detected in most isolates. blaVIM was detected in 36 strains from nine hospitals. Spread of blaVIM was clonal in four hospitals and horizontal through the spread of the same integron in different clones in two cases. The spread of type VIM metallo-â-lactamases seems to be an important mechanism for P. aeruginosa resistance in carbapenems in Greece. This fact underlines the necessity and the urgency for developing a strategy for the containment of resistance.\n\nSurvey of extended spectrum beta-lactamases in a paediatric oncology unit, first report of a cefotaxime hydrolysing beta-lactamase in a Klebsiella oxytoca isolate from the United Kingdom SoA8.5\n\nAlobwede Ia, Todd Nb, Hawkey Pc, Allen Md, M'Zali FHa. a University of Leeds, Microbiology, Leeds, UK, b Leeds General Infirmary, Microbiology, Leeds, UK, c Division of Immunity, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK, d Wyeth Laboratories, Clinical Trials, Maidenhead, UK\n\nPurpose of this study: During a survey investigating the prevalence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in the Paediatric Oncology Ward in St. James's University Hospital, Leeds (UK), a clinical isolate of Klebsiella oxytoca T6768 was found to harbour an ESBL conferring a higher Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) to cefotaxime (16 mg/l) than to ceftazidime (2 mg/l).\n\nResults: Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) revealed the presence of an SHV-type enzyme as well as a cefotaxime hydrolysing beta-lactamase (CTX-M-like enzyme) in this isolate. Molecular characterisation of the resistant determinants using Southern blotting, PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism and nucleotide sequence determination showed the presence of a chromosomal bla SHV-1 and a plasmid-mediated bla CTX-M-9 genes.\n\nConclusion: CTX-M-9 beta-lactamase has been reported in Spain and China. This is the first report of a CTX-M ESBL in the United Kingdom and thus highlights the continuing global emergence of this new group of class A beta-lactamases.\n\nThree year study on an incidence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases-producing strains of Enterobacteria at University Hospital in Košice, Slovakia SoA8.6\n\nSiegfried La, Kmetova Ma, Sandorcinova Za, Molokacova Mb, Bober Jc, Andrasina Id. a Institute of Medical Microbiology, Kosice, Slovakia, Faculty of Medicine, University of P.J.

Safarik, University Hospital Tr.SNP, 1st Clinic of Surgery, Kosice, Slovakia, d Faculty of Medicine, University of P.J. Safarik, L. Pasteur University Hospital, Clinic of Radiotherapy and Oncology, Kosice, Slovakia\n\nThe purpose of the study was to get information on an incidence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) in 1125 strains of gram-negative bacteria (870 Klebsiella spp., 115 Escherichia coli, 60 Enterobacter spp., 45 Serratia spp. and 35 Pseudomonas spp.) isolated from patients of three Intensive Care Units, Clinic of Anesthesiology and Intensive Medicine and Clinic of Radiotherapy and Oncology at University Hospital in Košice, Slovakia. ESBL production was determined based on both phenotype characteristics (double disk synergy test, three dimensional test, and E-test) and the presence of specific blaSHV and blaTEM gene sequences by PCR in isolated bacteria. The results obtained. Of 870 Klebsiella spp. isolates the production of ESBL was detected in 120 strains (13.79%) and five E. coli strains. In majority of ESBL producing isolates blaSHV sequences were detected. In our collection of strains any Enterobacter, Serratia and Pseudomonas clinical isolate was detected to produce ESBL. In our work we demonstrated that the most important ESBL producers at the University Hospital were Klebsiella spp. isolates carrying blaSHV genes.\n\nNationwide surveillance of antibiotic resistance in Saudi Arabia Saudi Antibiotic Susceptibility Surveillance Study (SASSS) SoA8.7\n\nOhaly Ya, Ishaq ARa, Memish ZAb, Kambal AAc, Al Balla SRd, Shibl AMd. a Ministry of Health, Microbiology, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, b King Fahd National Guard, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, c King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, d King Saud University, Microbiology, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia\n\nThe SASSS network aims to set up a national surveillance study to obtain standardized information on antimicrobial susceptibility to various bacterial pathogens. Currently, 25 hospitals are participating in the project from different geographical regions in Saudi Arabia. During the 1st year (2001), the SASSS focused on setting up this network.\n\nOverall, high frequencies of resistance to antibiotics to different bacterial pathogens in Saudi Arabia were seen. Geographical variations of resistance were noticed, which could be related to different prescribing practices. Approximately, 9 and 32% of Escherichia coli and K. pneumoniae, respectively, were Extended Spectrum â-Lactamases (EBLs) producers. Resistance of Enterobacteriacae group to Carbapenem and Pipracillin/tazobactam is low. Resistance of Pseudomonas aeurginosa to various anti-Pseudomonal antibiotics including Carbapenem is high and alarming. Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) comprised 36% of S. aureus isolates. No Vancomycin Intermediate S. aureus (visa) was detected. High level resistance to Gentamicin in Enterococcus were seen in 12% of the isolates and only 2% of Enterococcus facieum were glycopeptide resistant. Resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae to penicillin ranged between 2% to almost 52%.\n\nSurveillance of antibiotic resistance on a national level is necessarily to give guidance to practicing physicians on the best agents to use.\n\nEvolution of antibiotic resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp) in France from 1995 to 1999 SoA8.8\n\nRoussel Delvallez Ma, Dupont MJb, Fauchère JLc, Fosse Td, Laberki MFe, Lemozy Jf, Maugein Jg, Péchinot Ah, Ploy MCi, Vaucel Jj, Vergnaud Mk, Vernet-Garnier Vl, Weber Mm, Laurans Gn, Murbach Vo, Cattier Bp, Chardon Hp, Chomarat Mp, Cottin Jp, Demachy MCp, Romaszko JPp. a Laboratoire de Bactériologie, Hôpital Calmette, Lille, France, b Laboratoire de Bactériologie, CHU, Besançon, France, c Laboratoire de Bactériologie, CHU, Poitiers, France, d Laboratoire de Bactériologie, CHU, Nice, France, e Laboratoire de Bactériologie, CHU, Montpellier, France, f Laboratoire de Bactériologie, CHU, Toulouse, France, g Laboratoire de Bactériologie, CHU, Bordeaux, France, h Laboratoire de Bactériologie, CHU, Dijon, France, i Laboratoire de Bactériologie, CHU, Limoges, France, j Laboratoire de Bactériologie, CH, Saint-Brieuc, France, k Laboratoire de Bactériologie, CHU, Caen, France, l Laboratoire de Bactériologie, CHU, Reims, France, m Laboraroire de Bactériologie, CHU, Nancy, France, n Laboratoire de Bactériologie, CHU, Amiens, France, o Institut de Bactériologie, CHU, Strasbourg, France, p Laboratoire de Bactériologie, CHU, Tours, France\n\nEvery 2 years from 1995, Pneumococcal Regional Observatories (PROs) carried out a prospective study on pneumococcal resistance to antibiotics. The studies required a multicenter collecting of strains sent to one of the Regional Coordinating Centers (CCRs). Erythromycin (ERY), tetracycline (TET) and cotrimoxazole (SXT) were tested locally and interpreted according to the CA-SFM criteria. MICs for penicillin G (P), amoxicillin (AMX) and cefotaxime (CTX) were determined locally and confirmed by the CCRs using the agar dilution reference method. All pneumococci with diminished susceptibility to P (PSDP; MIC>0.06 mg/l) were serotyped by the CCRs. In 1995, 1997, and 1999, 4.575, 13.471 and 16.909 strains were tested by 8, 18 and 21 PROs, respectively. In 1995, 1997, and 1999, the percentages of intermediate and resistant strains increased steadily: ERY: 30, 46.9, 53; TET: 19, 27.9, 32.9; SXT: 28, 40.2, 42; P: 23, 40.5, 44; AMX: 16, 25.4, 26; CTX: 8, 17.9, 17.1. For β-lactam agents strains exhibiting a high level of resistance were rare (P<15%, AMX<5%, CTX<0.5%). The study of the results by specimen and by age showed that the evolution of resistance seemed to be constant for invasive strains while a stationary level was reached in 1997 for non-invasive strains. For example, in adults, the percentage of PSDP in blood cultures was 20 in 1995, 29 in 1997 and 37 in 1999; for strains isolated in respiratory samples, the percentages were 23, 44.6 and 41.5.\n\nTherapeutic failure and drug resistance in invasive pneumococcal infection SoA8.9\n\nDalhoff Ka, Schaaf BMa, Boehnke Fa, Maass Mb. a Medical University Luebeck, Medicine, Luebeck, Germany, b Medical University Luebeck, Microbiology, Luebeck, Germany\n\nPurpose: Drug resistant pneumococcal infection (DRPI) is a growing problem. Clinical data regarding the association between resistance and the development of invasive infections are limited. We evaluated the incidence of penicillin and macrolide resistance and of unsuccessful antibiotic pretreatment in patients with invasive pneumococcal infections. Results: Sixty-four hospitalized patients with culture proven pneumococcal infections (pneumonia: n=56, meningitis: n=5, pneumonia and meningitis: n=3) were prospectively enrolled in the study. Susceptibility testing of isolates was performed according to NCCLS. Comorbidities, disease severity, antibiotic treatment and complications were assessed in a standardized manner. Resistance to penicillin was found in 2/64 patients, to macrolides in 4/64 patients, one of them showing multidrug resistance. Oral antimicrobial chemotherapy of >48 h duration before admission had been delivered to 8/64 patients, most frequently with ciprofloxacin (n=3). DRPI was found in 3/8 cases with therapeutic failure (37.5%) and 2/56 cases without antibiotic pretreatment (3.6%, P<0.05). Conclusion: A history of unsuccessful antibiotic pretreatment was associated with penicillin and/or macrolide resistance in patients with invasive pneumococcal infections. In addition, an important reason for therapeutic failure was suboptimal choice of ambulatory chemotherapy.\n\nPenicillin and Fluoroquinolone resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae : a joint venture? SoA8.10\n\nCarsenti H, Dunais B, Pradier CH, Mancini G, Sabah M, Dellamonica P. Infectious Disease Department, Archet Hospital, Nice, France\n\nThe world-wide problem of betalactam resistance (R) in Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) has been complicated by increasing R to macrolides and some older fluoroquinolones (FQ) (ciprofloxacin CIP). Aim of our study was to evaluate rate of acquisition of resistance to different FQ: CIP, sparfloxacin (SPX) and levofloxacin (LEV) of SP strains with different levels of susceptibility to penicillin (P). Fifteen strains were serially and daily passaged in subinhibitory concentrations of these four antibiotics by a gradient plate method until acquisition of resistance. Clinical strains isolated from children in day-care centers were used. Five strains were susceptible (S) to penicillin (P) (one reference strain, four clinical isolates: P MICs<0.064 mg/l): five were intermediate (I) to P (one reference strain: P MIC 0.19 mg/l, four clinical strains P MICs: 0.5–1 mg/l), five were resistant (R) to P (P MICs 1.5 mg/l). Mean of number of passages (n) necessary to reach I or R level with each FQ as selecting agent are in the following table:\n\nSPX and LEV induced resistance but more slowly than CIP. Our results show that rate of acquisition of resistance to FQ is strongly related to alteration of susceptibility to P, probably by modification of cell wall. These results are concordant with clinical results.\n\nClinical relevance of phase variation in pneumococcal opacity: nasopharyngeal (NP) colonization in children from day care centers (DCC) SoA8.11\n\nCarsenti H, Mancini G, Bensoussan M, Dunais B, Pradier CH, Dellamonica P. Archet Hospital, Infectious Disease, Nice, France\n\nStreptococcus pneumoniae (SP) adherence to nasopharyngeal (NP) epithelium is a prerequisite for induction of otitis Transparent SP (T) have been shown to colonize the NP of infant rats better than opaque (O) SP. Opaque SP has proven more virulent than the T form during systemic infection in a mouse model. Aim of this study was to evaluate phase variation in the nasopharynx of children. SP strains were isolated during a winter epidemiology study of NP samples in children from family DCC. MICs determinations were performed by E-test for penicillin (P), amoxicilline (AMX) and ceftriaxone (CRO). Serotypes were performed using the Quellung reaction. Upon oil immersion microscopic examination short chains of six to eight cocci were noted as 0, +, ++, +++ for absence, 1, 2, >3 chains by field, respectively. Phase variation was detected on catalase Trypticase Soja plates, AMX and CRO MICs and bactericidal activity was determined for 10 pairs of O and T variants with different serotypes and susceptibility to penicillin. Seventy strains of SP were screened for phase variation. Nine out of 42 with chain length 0, + had O variants while 23 out of 28 strains with chain length ++ or +++ showed O variants. Proportion of O variants was predominant when chain length increased. Serotype 23F was prevalent. Bactericidal activity of O variants showed a four- to eightfold increase of MBC. O variants may be present in NP of children while T are predominant form for colonization. These virulent variants with lower level of autolysis showed less susceptibility to killing by antibiotics. They may persist in NP and explain the absence of eradication by active molecules.\n\nAntimicrobial resistance among clinical strains of S. pneumoniae isolated from patients with community-acquired respiratory tract infections (CARTI) in Russia SoA8.12\n\nKozlov RSa, Bogdanovitch TMa, Sivaya OVa, Agapova EDb, Ahmetova LIb, Furletovab, Gudkova LVb, Gugutsidgeb, Ilyina VNb, Marusinab, Multich IGb, Ortenberg EAb, Schetinin EVb, Shturmina SMb, Tseneva GYb. a Institute of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, Smolensk, Russian Federation, b PeGASus Study Group, Russian Federation\n\nPurpose: To determine the antimicrobial resistance of pneumococci causing CARTI in different Russian cities. Methods: A total of 142 non-duplicate strains isolated in 14 Russian cities in 2001 were studied. Antimicrobials tested included penicillin (PEN), amoxicillin (AMO), erythromycin (ERY), azithromycin (AZI), clarithromycin (CLA), midecamycin (MID), spiramycin (SPI), clindamycin (CLI), levofloxacin (LEV), vancomycin (VAN), rifampicin (RIF), tetracycline (TET) and co-trimoxazole (SXT). Susceptibility testing was performed by broth microdilution with interpretation of the results according to NCCLS guidelines (2001) were applicable. Results: Results are presented in the table.\n\n*CA-SFM 1996.\n\nConclusions: Penicillins, LEV and VAN retained high activity against Streptococcus pneumonia tested. High resistance to macrolides, TET and SXT was also noted.\n\nA multi-centric surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in staphylococci and enterococci in Colombian hospitals SoA8.13\n\nArias CAa, Reyes Ja, Cortes La, Cruz Ca, Rico CLb, Zuniga Ma, Yepes Fa, Pena Aa. a Bacterial Molecular Genetics Unit, Universidad El Bosque, Centro de Investigaciones, Bogota, D.C., Colombia, b Department of Surgery, Surgical Microbiology Service, Fundacion Santa Fe de Bogota, Bogota, D.C., Colombia\n\nInvasive isolates of staphylococci and enterococci were collected from 14 tertiary care centres. Identification was confirmed by both automated methods and multiplex PCR. MICs of various antibiotics were performed by standard methods. Detection of mecA and van genes was performed by PCR in resistant staphylococci and enterococci, respectively. Four hundred and eighty-two isolates were collected; Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) corresponded to 47.3 and 29.6% of them, respectively. 25.4% were identified as enterococci. Resistance to oxacillin in S. aureus and CNS was 46 and 76.2%, respectively. The mecA gene was detected in 96.2% of MRSA isolates. In S. aureus and CNS other antibiotic resistance profiles were as follows: chloramphenicol, 21 and 11.8%; gentamicin, 44.7 and 51%; ciprofloxacin, 42.1 and 28.7%; erythromycin, 44.7 and 60.8%; tetracyclin, 28.5 and 31.5%; TMS, 7 and 54.5%; rifampin 11.4 and 16.8%, respectively. All staphylococci were susceptible to vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid. No VISA isolates were found. In enterococci, resistance to glycopeptides was 10.8%: vanA (58.3%) and vanB (41.7%) were found. Resistance to ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, and rifampin was 12.6, 28.8, 7.2, 69.4, 46.8%, respectively. All enterococci were susceptible to linezolid. In summary, linezolid, glycopeptides, and chloramphenicol showed the best activity against all isolates.\n\nAntimicrobial resistance and consumption of antibiotics—the first results of National Resistance Monitoring Network (OPTY) in Poland SoA8.14\n\nGrzesiowski P, Karynski M, Hryniewicz W. Sera and Vaccines Central Research Lab, Immunology and Prevention of Infections, Warsaw, Poland\n\nPurpose of the study: OPTY network was established as a ongoing national surveillance system to monitor antimicrobial resistance linked to antibiotic consumption in order to promote prudent use of antiinfective agents. The network is co-ordinated by National Reference Centre fore Antimicrobial Resistance (SVCRL). All laboratories have been using standardized methodology and participated in the National and International Quality Assessment Schemes (POLMICRO, UK NEQAS). Results: A total of 1200 isolates were collected from 20 hospitals with about 400,000 admissions during year 2000. The overall percentage of multi-resistant pathogens were 12% for MRSA, 19% for high level aminoglycoside-resistant Enterococci and 15% Enterobacteriaceae producing ESBLs. Utilisation of microbiology was relatively low with an average of eight tests/hospital bed per year. Antibiotic consumption measured as percentage of total cost for all pharmaceuticals utilised in hospitals varied between 12 and 36%, mean 25%. The consumption measured by daily defined doses reviled two major groups of antibiotics used, as cephalosporines and aminopenicillines with beta-lactamase inhibitors. Conclusions: The incidence of selected resistance mechanisms in participating hospitals was moderate. The consumption of antimicrobial agents in some centres was high and differed from hospitals of the same level of care. Microbiology was underutilised thus most of therapeutic regimens was of empirical character.\n\nAnaerobes: lessons from a french multicentric survey SoA8.15\n\nBehra-Miellet J, Dubreuil LJ. Faculté de Pharmacie, Microbiology, Lille, France\n\nBackground: This study surveyed the antibiotic susceptibilities of 434 nonduplicate gram negative isolates collected from nine large university hospitals including B. fragilis group species (359), Prevotella spp. (40), Fusobacterium spp. (23). Methods: The NCCLS-approved M11-A4 was used. Drugs tested were: amoxicillin (AMX), AMX+clavulanic acid (AMC), ticarcillin (TC) TC+clavulanic acid (TCC), cefoxitin (FOX), cefotetan (CTT), imipenem (IMP), clindamycin (CM) and metronidazole (MOL). Results: Resistance rates within the B. fragilis group were: AMC 5.6%, TIC 33%, TCC 2%, FOX 13%, CTT 44%, CM 33%, IMP 1% and MOL <1%, respectively. Only one strain of B. fragilis was resistant to metronidazole (MIC=64 μg/ml); nimA gene was present. Resistance to imipenem or metronidazole was only found among the B. fragilis species, whereas B. fragilis was less resistant to the other drugs than the non-fragilis species. β-Lactamase production was detected for 26/40 Prevotella and 3/23 Fusobacterium. Conclusion: Dynamic changes of antimicrobial resistance are occuring within the B. fragilis group: FOX, CTT, CM continues to increase. Further antibiotic surveys are needed as a source of information to guide the empiric therapy of anaerobic infections.\n\nA map of bacterial resistance in a Hungarian region SoA8.16\n\nFarkas Aa, Juhasz Ab, Orosi Pa, Miszti Cc, Balogh Md. a Kenezy Teaching Hospital, Hygienie, Debrecen, Hungary, b Kenezy Teaching Hospital, Laboratory, Debrecen, Hungary, c University of Debrecen, Microbiology Lab, Debrecen, Hungary, d Regional Hospital Berettyóújfalu, Laboratory, Debrecen, Hungary\n\nBackground: Regional trends of microbiological resistance pattern constitute basic data and qualifying criteria for effective infection control. Purpose: The aim of our study was to establish an internationally compatible regional database in a Hungarian county Hajdú-Bihar. Methods: Our model is the National Nosocomial Infections Society publications' format from the U.S. published in 2001. It contains data regarding various ICU types, ambulatory patients and hospitalised patients. The same format is used for antibiotic utilisation data and device related infections' rates as well. We collected cleaned data of years 2000–2001 from all the microbiological laboratories of our county. Results:\n\nSusceptibilities not significantly different from U.S. data were as follows: MR CNS, Streptococcus pneumoniae/penicillin and 3rd generation cephalosporin, Pseudomonas aeruginosa/piperacillin and Enterobacter spp. and Escherichia coli/ceftriaxon. Conclusions: This database proved to be a very useful tool for choosing primary wards of active surveillance including places for infectious disease physician's visit (ICU, rehabilitation unit). Additional analysis is needed at an individual institution's level for other heavily used (or useable) antibiotics and bacteria as well (aminoglycosides, beta-lactam–beta lactamase inhibitor combinations, 2nd generation cephalosporins, corynebacteria.\n\nAIDS-defining diseases (ADD) and HIV-related immunodeficiency in patients developing AIDS during the HAART era: what is changing? SoA9.2\n\nManfredi R, Calza L, Chiodo F. University of Bologna, Infectious Diseases, Bologna, Italy\n\nTo compare epidemiological, clinical, and immunological features of ADD before and after HAART introduction, between the 436 patients (p) diagnosed in 1985–1995, and the 103 p detected since 1997, in a case-control study. Though the mean number of newly diagnosed AIDS p had a sharp drop in the HAART era, from 65 p/year in 1991–1995 to 22 p/year since 1997 (P<0.001), the distribution of ADD and underlying immunodeficiency showed limited changes. When excluding a greater frequency of tuberculosis (TB) (P<0.001) and wasting syndrome (P<0.04), all other ADD did not show a different frequency before and after 1997. A tendency towards a higher mean CD4 count at AIDS disease was noticed: 78 vs 61 cells/μl (P<0.003), with a significant difference for Candida esophagitis, toxoplasmosis, Kaposi sarcoma and TB (P<0.002–<0.03). The limited variation of clinical and immunological presentation are attributable to the poor impact of HAART before AIDS recognition: 88.4% of p detected since 1997 did not receive HAART or had insufficient compliance to antiretrovirals, so that 58.2% of p were AIDS presenters. During the HAART era, an increase of mean age and sexual transmission was found (P<0.001). Notwithstanding the effects of HAART on the natural history of HIV disease, the consequences on ADD distribution and related immunodeficiency were negligible, since most p could not benefit from HAART before AIDS onset. A high clinical suspicion for ADD should be maintained when facing p with missed or undertreated HIV disease.\n\nRadata—communication internet platform management of resistance analysis guided haart switch for implementation in clinical practice of HIV-infected individuals SoA9.3\n\nPaech V, Lorenzen T, Stoehr A, Plettenberg A. IFI, interdisciplinary Infectiology and Immunology, Hamburg, Germany\n\nPurpose: HIV-resistance analyses are indicated to prepare switch of HAART in HIV-infected individuals with failure to ongoing HAART regimen. Specialists at several responsible sites often feel lack of complementary informations if interpretation of resistance analyses is done independent from each other. Clinical benefits from resistance analysis assays are sigfnificantly higher for those physicians, who can access external advice from HIV-experts for possible treatment options. The database concept ‘Radata’ (www.radata.de) was developed in Germany to generate expert advice for implementation in HAART switch. Results: Fifteen HIV-treatment centres, seven laboratories and 15 high ranked authorities in HIV-Medicine contribute to Radata database since it is started in January 2002 in Germany. HIV-infected subjects are eligible to participate at the project after presentation of failure to HAART (viral load >1000 c/ml). Expert advice is generated after all data are evaluated and based on recommendations of 2–4 external HIV-experts. Observation after therapy switch is scheduled for a period of 12 months. Conclusions: Radata is a novel database concept with features for evaluation of data and availability of complementary information to participating sites. The project is designed to provide its proficiency to patients and centres from Germany and foreign countries. Further information will be provided after the number enclosed subjects have enlarged.\n\nIn vitro effects of HIV infection on ABC transporter expression and antiretroviral drug efficacy SoA9.4\n\nJorajuria S, Dereuddre-Bosquet N, Dormont D, Clayette P. CEA, DRM, Fontenay-aux-roses, France\n\nBackground: Intracellular concentrations of anti-HIV drugs are determinant for their efficacy. ABC transporters such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRP) are reported to limit protease inhibitor (IP) and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) access to their targets. Moreover, HIV may regulate the expression and activity of these host cell factors. Therefore, we evaluate in primary cultures of human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) and lymphocytes, effects: (1) of retroviral infection and HAART on the expression and activity of P-gp and MRP; and (2) of specific inhibitors of these host proteins on antiretroviral activities of NRTI, non-NRTI and IP. Results: On the one hand, we evidenced a transitory increase of P-gp mRNA expression in lymphocytes and MDM in response to in vitro HIV infection. This was correlated to an increased P-gp cell surface expression and activity, and an increased TNF-alpha production and mRNA. In contrast, no significant modulation of MRP was observed. On the other hand, PSC833 and probenecid potentiated in vitro the anti-HIV activity of AZT and indinavir. These effects were accentuated when PSC833 and probenecid were combined. Conclusion: These results showed that: (1) HIV infection by increasing ABC transporter expression could favorise the efflux of antiretroviral drugs and decrease their pharmacological effects; and (2) specific inhibitors of these transporters could reverse these deleterious effects.\n\nEffects of Interferon alpha plus ribavirine therapy on frequencies of HCV, HIV and CMV specific CD4-T-cell responses in peripheral blood of HIV/HCV coinfected patients after 6 months of treatment SoA9.5\n\nAlatrakchi Na, Di Martino Vb, Thibault Vc, Benhamou Yb, Baude Ca, Bochet Md, Katlama Cd, Poynard Tb, Autran Ba. a Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Laboratoire d'Immunologie Cellulaire, Paris, France, b Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Service d'Hepato-Gastrologie, Paris, France, c Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Laboratoire de Virologie, Paris, France, d Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Service de Maladies Infectieuses, Paris, France\n\nObjectives: To investigate the consequences of HIV-related immune defects on HCV-specific T-cell responses and the influence of IFN-alpha+ribavirine therapy on these responses. Methods: Two groups of patients with chronic HCV infection were studied: 26 HIV coinfected progressors with antiretroviral therapy and 13 HIV-negative controls. Twelve HCV/HIV and 9 HCV patients have already reached 6 months of IFN-alpha+ribavirine therapy. Virus-specific CD4-T-cells in peripheral blood were analyzed by IFN-gamma-ELISPOT-assays using HIV-p24, one CMV and three HCV (Core, NS3, NS4) antigens. Results: (1) at baseline, HCV-specific CD4-Th1-cells frequencies were significantly lower than HIV- and CMV-specific ones; (2) frequencies of CD4-Th1-cells against HCV as well as against CMV were similar in the two groups; (3) in HCV+/HIV+, HCV specific CD4-T-cell frequencies did not change between baseline and 6th month of anti-HCV treatment, decreased in three and increased in only one case. HIV- and CMV-specific frequencies were decreased in seven patients. Similar results were observed in HIV-negative group. Conclusion: (1) HCV-specific immune responses might be more prone to tissue compartmentalization than HIV-specific ones; (2) immune defects induced by HIV infection might not be responsible for the low level of HCV-specific responses observed in HIV-progressors; (3) IFN-alpha+ribavirine therapy influence on HCV- and HIV- specific CD4-T-cell frequencies after 6 months of treatment will be discussed.\n\nFrequencies of HIV-1-p24 specific Th1 cells (ELISPOT) are correlated with plasma HIV-1 viral load in a cohort of LT-NP and slow progressors SoA9.6\n\nMartinez Va, Alatrakchi Na, Costagliola Db, Bonduelle Oa, Agut Hc, Autran Ba, ALT Study Groupa. a Hopital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Laboratoire d'Immunologie Cellulaire, Paris, France, b Faculté de Medecine Saint-Antoine, INSERM SC4, Paris, France, c Hopital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Laboratoire de Virologie, Paris, France\n\nBackground: HIV-1-specific T helper-1 cell responses have been associated with long-term-non-progression (LT-NP) in HIV infection but the correlation between frequencies of HIV-1-p24-specific Th1 cells and viral load has not yet been studied. We prospectively quantified these frequencies by using an IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay in a cohort of LT-NP. Methods: A cohort of 62 LT-NP and slow progressors (infection >8 years and CD4 counts >600/mm3) was analysable. HIV-1-p24-specific T cells were analyzed using: proliferation, IFN-gamma ELISPOT assays and IFN-gamma production in cell supernatants. Results: Wide ranges were observed in the frequencies of HIV-1-p24-specific CD4 Th1 cells as assessed by ELISPOT (0-3770 SFC/106 PBMC) with a median of 70 SFC/106 PBMC. These frequencies were negatively correlated with viral load (r=−0.304, P=0.026) but not with CD4 counts and associated with a low level of T cell activation assessed by CD71 on CD4 cells (r=−0.266, P=0.035). Similar results were obtained with T cell proliferation and IFN-gamma production. Conclusion: Interestingly, the numbers of HIV-1-p24-specific Th1 cells correlate with plasma viral load, independently of CD4 counts indicating that: (1) the defect in HIV-1-specific CD4 Th1 cells does not reflect the global CD4 depletion; and (2) these responses are strongly correlated to the control of virus replication.\n\nImpact of drug–drug interactions on therapeutical management of active tuberculosis in HIV infected patients SoA9.7\n\nMartinez Va, Truffot Cb, Caumes Ec, Katlama Cc, Jarlier Vb, Bricaire Fc, Jouan Md. a Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Pitié Salpêtrière Hospital, Institut Pasteur, Unité de Génétique Mycobactérienne, Paris, France, b Department of Bacteriology, Pitié Salpêtrière Hospital, Paris, France, c Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Pitié Salpêtrière Hospital, Paris, France, d Institut Pasteur, Unité de Génétique Mycobactérienne, Paris, France\n\nSince 1996 and the use of HAART, management of HIV patients with active tuberculosis raised the question of drug–drug interactions and therapeutical management of both infections. Retrospective cohort study: Follow-up of 43 HIV patients with active tuberculosis diagnosed between 1996 and 2000. Studied data included evolution of tuberculosis and HIV, CD4 cell counts, plasma HIV viral loads, antituberculosis and antiretroviral regimens. Ninety-four percent of patients were treated by quadruple combination antituberculosis drug with rifabutin for five patients. Fourteen patients were treated by double antiretroviral therapy of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and 29 by triple or more drugs (NRTIs and/or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors NNRTIs and/or protease inhibitors PIs). The median follow-up was 24 months. There was no difference on CD4 cell counts and viral loads in the two groups and between the patients treated by NNRTIs and PIs at the diagnosis of tuberculosis, at the time of antituberculosis drug discontinuation and concerning cure rates of tuberculosis. On the other hand, the plasma HIV viral load was significantly better controlled in patients with NNRTIs than with PIs (P<0.005). In HIV patients with active tuberculosis receiving HAART, antiretroviral combination including NNRTIs allows a better control of viral replication than regimen including PIs without impact of the use of rifampin or rifabutin.\n\nPrevious survey to the settlement of pharmacy visit among HIV-infected patients SoA9.8\n\nGuerrault MNa, Langevin Sa, Merian-Brosse La, Leclerc Cb, Brossard Da, Welker Yb. a Pharmacy CHI Poissy-Saint-Germain-En-Laye, France, b Unité des Maladies Infectieuses et Tropicales (U.M.I.T.), CHI Poissy-Saint-Germain-En-Laye, France\n\nAdherence is essential to the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy. A pharmacy visit would improve the patient advisement. A survey was carried out over a period of 3 months in the U.M.I.T. A self-report was distributed to 150 patients. Ninety were evaluated. For 66%, information's given by the clinician were sufficient and for 76% the treatment advice cards were useful. However, 72% of them would like to attend a pharmacy visit. The topics they would prefer to be tackled were drug interactions (51%), side effects (49%) and effect of forgetting (44%). The treatment was well accepted and tolerated for, respectively 91 and 65% of the patients. The viral load and the CD4 count were well known by, respectively 52 and 46%. However, inaccurate pattern of treatment was frequent (>50%) and bad adherence was observed: treatment forgotten occasionally (60%), regularly (30%) or inadequate attitude when the treatment was forgotten (76%). Number of pills, dose frequency, length of the treatment would be risk factors of nonadherence. For the majority of patients, a pharmacy visit is necessary and beneficial. The first result shows a better understanding of the treatment, an improvement of the adherence and an enhancement of plasma concentration of antiretroviral drugs.\n\nIn vivo activity of glycopeptides against S. aureus infection in a rabbit endocarditis model: is MIC predictive for in vivo efficacy? SoA10.3\n\nAsseray N, Caillon J, Lemabecque V, Jacqueline C, Batard E, Potel G, Bugnon D. Laboratoire Antibiologie, Faculte de Medecine, Nantes, France\n\nWe have studied the in vivo efficacy of vancomycin (V) and teicoplanin (T) against five Staphylococcus aureus (SA) strains: two methicillin-susceptible (MSSA 1 and 2), two methicillin-resistant (MRSA 3 and 4) and one glycopeptide-intermediate (GISA 5) strain, in a rabbit endocarditis model. MICs of V and T (V/T) were 0.5/0.25, 1/0.5, 1/1, 0.5/0.5, and 4/8, for MSSA 1, MSSA 2, MRSA 3, MRSA 4, and GISA 5, respectively. The animals were randomly infected with one of these strains, then treated for 2 days by V or T. A continuous infusion of V, simulating a 30 mg/kg/24 h human dose was used. T was infused as a continuous infusion allowing simulating a 6 mg/kg human dose, following an initial bolus. These regimens achieved clinically relevant serum steady-state concentrations of glycopeptides (>20 mg/l). Results were as follows: expressed in log CFU/g of vegetations (mean±SD, followed in parenthesis by the number of rabbits used).\n\n*P<0.05 vs controls.\n\nConclusion: In vivo activity of V and T in this model were different from one strain to another, whatever the in vitro susceptibility to glycopeptides could be. Apparent susceptibility measured by MIC could not predict the in vivo therapeutic effect of glycopeptides at the early stage of treatment in severe SA infections.\n\nSusceptibility to glycopeptides of Staphylococcus aureus in Strasbourg University Hospital SoA10.4\n\nDe Almeida Na, Hennebelle Ba, Heckendorn Ra, Klein Ca, Prevost Gb, Linger Lb, Monteil Hb, Bientz Ma, Jehl Fb, Meunier Oa. a Hygiene Institute, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France, b Bacteriology Institute, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France\n\nPurpose: To determine the prevalence of the decreased glycopeptides susceptibility among 187 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus collected from patients hospitalized in Strasbourg University Hospital between 15/01/2000 and 01/03/2000. The susceptibility to glycopeptides of 38 S. aureus isolates collected from hospital environment during approximately the same period was also investigated.\n\nMethods: The susceptibility to glycopeptides was studied among the MRSA isolates, using:\n\n–\n\ndetection of the decreased susceptibility to glycopeptides using agar plates containing 6 mg/l teicoplanin,\n\n–\n\ndetection of hetero-VISA strains using agar plates containing 4 mg/l vancomycin,\n\n–\n\ndetermination of the MICs of vancomycin and teicoplanin using the agar dilution and the E-test strips methods.\n\nResults: Thirty-nine percent of S. aureus clinical isolates (74 out of 187 strains) are MRSA. No VISA or hetero-VISA strain was detected. Six percent MRSA isolates are teicoplanin intermediate S. aureus strains. In the environment, 13% S. aureus isolates are methicillin-resistant (five out of 38). The five strains are all susceptible to glycopeptides.\n\nConclusion: The results regarding vancomycin are reassuring. However, the high rate of MRSA and the presence of teicoplanin intermediate S. aureus isolates prove that prevention and control measures need to be improved.\n\nComparative investigation of polymerase chain reaction and a conventional methods for detection of methicilin resistant Staphylococcus amont clinical isolates SoA10.5\n\nKantardjiev TVa, Vacheva-Dobrevski RSb, Panajotov SVa, Bachvarova AMa, Velinov TIa, Levterova VSa. a National Center of Infectious and parasitic Diseases, Microbiology, Sofia, Bulgaria, b Military Medical Academy, Clinical Microbiology, Sofia, Bulgaria\n\nPurpose: Identification on methicillin resistant Staphylococci has a great clinical implication and significant impact of antibiotic therapy. The aim of this study is to compare the disc-diffusion test (DDT), oxacillin agar screen test (OAST) and PCR for detection of mec A gene. Fifty selective clinical isolates (41 Staphylococcus aureus and nine S. epidermidis) determined as methicillin resistant by DDT were enrolled in the study. DDT was performed with oxacillin disk (1 mkg/ml) on Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA) without NaCl (NCCLS, 2000). OAST was performed on MHA with 4% NaCl, oxacillin 6 mkg/ml, T 35 °C. These strains was genotypically characterized for the mec A gene presence by PCR method using the mec A 1-5′-AAA ATC CAT GGT AAA GGT TGG C-3′ and the mec A 2–5′-AGT TCT GCA GTA CCG GAT TTG C-3′ primers (GIBCO, BRL).\n\nResults: In the group of 50 MRS isolates, detected by PCR, positive results were as follow: 23 S. aureus and six S. epidermidis. For six S. aureus isolates DDT and OAST were positive; PCR-negative. For two S. aureus and two S. epidermidis isolates PCR was positive; phenotypic methods-negative.\n\nConclusions: Accurate and rapid detection of MRS is a constant challenge for laboratories. The PCR assay (first time in our country) appears to be more reliable than routine susceptibility testing for the rapid diagnosis of MRSA infections at hospitals, particularly due to the heterogeneous resistance of many strains.\n\nDistribution and antibiotic susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from suspected urinary tract infections of inpatients in Hungary SoA13.2\n\nRozgonyi F, Csukás Z, Kamotsay K, Szabó D, Ostorházi E, Berek Z, Maródi C. Institute of Medical Microbiology, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary\n\nBetween l January 1997 and 31 December 2000, a total of 12, 143 urine samples were cultured 40% as native urine (NU) and 60% as Uricult-Plus (UP) (Orion Diagnostica, Finland). Cultivations were negative in 39% of NU and 42% of UP specimens, while contamination was revealed in 20% of NU and 30% of UP. In the clinical bacteriologically evaluable positive 1726 NU and 1656 UP cultures, the distribution of the Gram-negatives was very similar with the predominance of Escherichia coli (43 and 41%) followed by Enterobacter spp. The distribution of Gram-positives differed significantly according to the types of specimens. NU resulted in 13% Group-D and 6% group-B Streptococcus while UP did 22 and 1.5%, respectively. Third generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolons were equally very effective against E. coli strains, while ampicillin inhibited growth of 42% only. Carbapenems, cefepime and the fluoroquinolons were the most active against Enterobacter strains. Interestingly, trimethoprim+sulfarmetoxazole combination could inhibit more than 75% of Enterobacteriaceae strains. Piperacillin+tazobactam (89%), imipenem (83%), and ciprofloxacin (82%) could be the drog of choice against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Enterococcus strains were highly sensitive to glycopeptides (100%), nitrofurantoin (99%), imipenem (95%) and amoxicillin+clavulanic acid (94%).\n\nAntimicrobial susceptibility levels of Escherichia coli isolates cultured from urine at a tertiary care teaching hospital. Temporal trend and comparison between community-acquired and nosocomial urinary tract infection SoA13.3\n\nNanetti A, Manfredi R, Valentini R, Calza L, Chiodo F. University of Bologna, Infectious Diseases, Bologna, Italy\n\nIn order to assess the local temporal trend of antibiotic sensitivity of the most common urinary tract bacterial pathogen, all urine-cultured Escherichia coli isolates were reviewed as to susceptibility profile, and specimen source (community- versus hospital-acquired infection). When evaluating sensitivity levels of 2070 community-acquired pathogens (1999–2001), a significant resistance rise was limited to cotrimoxazole (P<0.01) and nalidixic acid (P<0.02), while a tendency towards increased resistance regarded norfloxacin (P=0.05) (Fig. 1). When 1570 community-acquired E. coli isolates were compared with 2687 nosocomial strains (tested in the years 2000–2001), a greater susceptibility of community-acquired E. coli isolates was limited to cotrimoxazole versus all other compounds in the year 2000 (P<0.03), while it was extended to amoxicillin, cephalotin, nitrofurantoin and piperacillin in the year 2001 (P<0.0001) (Fig. 2). On the whole, E. coli showed an elevated sensitivity rate (>90% of tested strains) to nitrofurantoin, gentamicin, amikacin, and 2nd- and 3rd-generation cephalosporins, while only amoxicillin and piperacillin had a mean resistance rate >30%, regardless of the community or nosocomial origin. A permanent surveillance of sensitivity levels of the most common pathogens responsible for infectious diseases enables to identify local antimicrobial activity and its temporal variations, and plays a key role in starting empiric therapy, pending bacterial identification and in vitro assays.\n\nSensitivity to antimicrobial compounds strains isolated by urine culture of outpatients referring to our tertiary care hospital.\n\nSensitivity to antimicrobial compounds of E. coli isolated by urine culture in outpatients (OUT) and (IN) referring to our hospital (years 2000–2002).\n\nTreatment of urinary tract infections: a report of 100 cases SoA13.4\n\nAmari AL, Tiouiri HT, Kilani BK, Goubontini AG, Zouiten FZ, Kanoun FK, Ben Chaabène TBC. Rabta Hospital, Infectious Diseases, Tunis, Tunisia\n\nObjectives: To evaluate the therapeutic management of urinary tract infections (UTI) in adults.\n\nPatients and methods: The study is carried out from July 1999 to December 2000. We included all patients that have signs of UTI. The predisposing factors of UTI are noted, as well as the susceptibility profile of the pathogens. Antibiotic treatment, the clinical and bacteriological course are reported.\n\nResults: One hundred cases of UTI are observed. Thirty men and 70 women with a mean age of 48.5 years are included. Diabetes is a common predisposing factor for UTI reported in 37% followed by n prostatic hyperplasia (40%) andurolithiasis (7%). The most prevalent pathogens are Escherichia coli (75%), followed by K. pneumoniae (9%). Of the E. coli isolates, 76% are susceptible to the 1st CG, 100% to the 3rd CG and 45.5% to ampicilin. Moreover, this pathogen is susceptible to ciprofloxacin in 98.6% and to trimethroprim–sulphamethoxazole (TMP–SMZ) in 60%. Cefalotine is used in 40 cases, alone in 6 cases and with gentamicin in 34 cases. Cefotaxim is prescribed in 31 cases. The mean duration of treatment is 5.79 days. The recovery is reported in all cases. Recurrence of UTI in 25% but six patients lost sight 7 months with hindsight.\n\nConclusion: In UTI, the antimicrobial agents such as 1st CG combined with aminoglycosides are recommended as initial treatment as well as the 3rd cephalosporin generation at monotherapy. In addition, the fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides are effective in UTI.\n\nFollowing symposia\n\nPrevalence of resistance mutations to antirretrovirals and relation to virological failure S3.4\n\nGarcia Fa, Suarez Sa, Alvarez Ma, Martinez NMa, Valera Bb, Pasquau Jb, Hernandez Quero Ja, Maroto MCa. a Hospital San Cecilio, Microbiology, Granada, Spain, b Hospital Virgen Nieves, Microbiology, Granada, Spain\n\nPurpose: To investigate the prevalence of resistance mutations in the reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease (P) genes of HIV and to relate it with the type of virological failure (VF), we have studied 88 patients (11% naïve or pregnant women, 31% were first VF, 23% were second VF, 35% more than two VF. Resistance mutations were investigated using Trugene HIV-1 Genotyping Kit (Visible Genetics). Results: Global prevalence of resistance mutations for RT Inhibitors (RTI) has been >20% for M41L, D67N, K103N, M184V, L210W, T215YF, and for L10I, M36I, L63P, A71VT, L90M for P Inhibitors (PI). The prevalence of resistance mutations for the naïve patients studied was very low (A98G, V118I for RTI and L10I, M36I, M46I—all n=1—and L63P n=4 for PI). For patients on first VF only K103N, M184V, T215YF (RTI) were >20%, as well as L10I, D30N, L63P (PI); when patients on second VF were studied, then M41L, E44D, K103N, M184V, G190A, L210W, T215YF, K219QE (RTI) and M36I, L63P, A71T (PI) were >20% prevalence; finally, when patients with more than two VF were studied, the following resistance mutations were >20%: M41L, D67N, K70R, K103N, V118I, Y181C, M184V, G190A, L210W, T215YF (RTI), and L10I, M36I, M46IL, L63P, A71T, L90M (PI). Conclusions: The prevalence of primary resistance in the population studied is very low; the prevalence of mutations in the reverse transcriptase and protease genes increase in parallel to the type of virological failure.\n\nGenotypic resistance in HIV-1 RNA from patient plasma compared with rapid virus isolation and phenotypic resistance in patient PBMCs S3.5\n\nStuermer M, Groeschel B, Cinatl J, Doerr HW. Institute for Medical Virology, University Clinic Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany\n\nObjective: To compare HIV-1 virus isolation in the presence of antiretroviral drugs with plasma HIV-1 genotyping. Materials and methods: HIV-1 genotyping was performed using the ViroSeqTM Vers. 2 from Applied Biosystems. Interpretation of genotype was done according to international standards. CD4-cells were purified from patient plasma and cultivated in microtiter plates coated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies in the presence of different concentrations of antiretroviral drugs. Virus production was measured using a p24 antigen assay. Phenotypic activity was expressed as 50% reduction of p24 concentrations. Results: Seventeen samples were analyzed. For 11 samples results were obtained from both methods, two samples could not be analysed by phenotyping and four samples not by genotyping. Only 3/11 samples showed total and 2/11 samples partial concordance, 6/11 samples showed discordance between the two assays. In discordant samples the genotype gave a definite interpretation. Conclusion: HIV-1 virus isolation and phenotyping from PBMCs may overcome the problem of currently used resistance assays, which analyse only the Reverse Transcriptase and the Protease gene of HIV-1. Possible mutations in other regions may influence viral fitness and therefore contribute to the growth of the virus population present. The lack of concordance between the two assays is related to the different blood compartments used. The clinical value of resistance tests using PBMCs is under investigation.\n\nInterleukin-6 co-operates with a new type I IFN, IFN-tau to inhibit early steps of HIV-I biological cycle S3.6\n\nRogez Ca, Clayette Pa, Martin Ma, Dereuddre-Bosquet Na, Martal Jb, Dormont Dc. a CEA, DRM, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France, b INRA, Physiologie Animale, Jouy-en-Josas, France, c CEA, CRSSA, EPHE, DRM, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France\n\nBackground: Type I interferons (IFN) exhibit efficient antiviral activities notably against HIV, but severe side effects restrict their clinical uses. IFN-tau is an ovine or bovine non-cytotoxic type I IFN which displays higher inhibitory effects towards HIV replication than IFN-alpha, particularly in human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). The antiretroviral activity of IFN-tau seems to involve antiviral and immunomodulatory mechanisms: IL-6 synthesis is increased in dose-dependent manner in MDM treated with IFN-tau and a specific inhibition of IL-6 biological activity decreases its antiretroviral efficiency. Results: After a 1-h infection, a significant decrease of intracellular HIV RNA amount was found in MDM treated with IFN-tau. In parallel, no additive inhibition was observed with IFN-tau during the elongation of proviral DNA. These results suggest either an inhibition of HIV nucleocapsid uptake or an immediate HIV RNA degradation, and the expression of 2′,5′-OAS, MxA protein and PKR was then measured. IFN-tau induced the expression of these three host cell factors. The role of IL-6 on these different steps was evaluated and we showed that IL-6 co-operates with IFN-tau during the very early step of HIV biological cycle. Conclusion: Altogether, these results evidence that IFN-tau uses the same antiretroviral pathway as others type I IFN in MDM, and that IL-6 takes part to its inhibition of early steps of HIV biological cycle.\n\nActinomycin-D as a modulator of resistances due to cell-wall active agents like Bacitracin (Bc) and lysozyme (Lz) S4.7\n\nChakrabarty ANa, Dastidar SGb. a Calcutta University, Medical Microbiology, Calcutta, India, b Jadavpur University, Pharmaceutical Technology, Calcutta, India\n\nIt was observed that development of Lzr in the Lzr mutants took placed at three different levels and was accompanied with unselected, distinctive and elevated levels of Bcr. Similarly, Bcr in Bcr-mutants were also detected at three different levels. Although the levels of Bcr (100/200 μg/ml) in the Bcr mutants could be raised only by persistent efforts, an increase in the levels of Lzr (as cross-resistance) in the same mutants could be easily achieved. A correlation of actinomycin-D resistance with Lzr and Bcr of the mutant bacteria and the effects of lipase treatment on the same showed a 4–20-fold rise in actinomycin-D resistance of the Lzr and Bcr mutants of Gram-positive bacteria compared with their correspondence wild-types. These findings suggest that Lzr and Bcr are controlled by several genes accounting for reduced cell-wall and cell-membrane permeability and indirectly, by phenotypic alteration of the lipid content of the cell-wall. Thus, the alteration of cell-walls and membranes and a phenotypic extra lipid layer can work in conjunction with the efflux pump mechanisms finally determining the levels of drug-resistance.\n\nExperimental development of drug resistance to non-antibiotics: a role of alteration of membrane fluidity and efflux systems S4.8\n\nDastidar SGa, Mazumdar Ka, Asok Kumar Ka, Chakrabarty ANb. a Jadavpur University, Pharmaceutical Technology, Calcutta, India, b Department of Medical Microbiology, Calcutta University, Calcutta, India\n\nDrug resistance among clinical strains was studied by selecting mutants resistant to promazine (Pr) and methdilazine (Md). The results showed that successive step-up mutants of Pr and Md developed cross-resistance to several unrelated drugs, which in subsequent steps had broader resistance spectra with higher levels of resistance. Experiments on the membrane fluidity or permeability of bacterial cells using diphenyl hexatrine (DPH), a fluorescent probe on Md-mutants showed that three was marked reduction in the membrane fluidity and permeability. When several analogues of the basic phenothiazine structure, e.g. 2-chlor-methyl-N-methyl-pyrrolidine (CMP), methyl-1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone-4-carboxylate (MMPC), 3 hydroxymethyl-N-methyl-pyrrolidine (HMP) and Md with final substitution were tested for antibacterial function on different strains, highest activity was observed with respect to Md. With anaerobic bacteria the resistance(s) dependent on efflux pumps showed higher levels of resistance even to Md. We have found the non-antibiotic agents triflupromazine, trimeprazine and diclofenac sodium have high degree of activity against vibrios, staphylococci and pseudomonads. The explanation of such a phenomenon in terms of possible efflux pumps will be discussed.\n\nCSF, plasma and urine PCR in Lyme neuroborreliosis S7.3\n\nPícha Da, Moravcová La, Lásiková Ša, Marešová Va, Žïárský Eb. a Charles University, 2nd Medical School, 1st Clinic for Infectious Diseases, Prague, Czech Republic, b Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Charles University, 3rd Medical School, 1st Clinic for Infectious Diseases, Prague, Czech Republic\n\nThe main reason for high diagnostic value of PCR in neuroborreliosis (NB) is the direct way of spirochete detection. Two sets of primers in nested PCR were used: one for plasmide gene encoding OspC protein and second for chromosomal gene 16S rDNA. So far 25 patients with clinically manifested involvement in NB were enrolled into the prospective designed study (being continued). The main including criterion was positive prove of intrathecal specific antibody secretion (in 22 patients) and PCR positivity in CSF (in 3). All patients were repeatedly examined by neurologist and samples of CSF, plasma and urine were taken: (1) before treatment; (2) after treatment; (3) after 3 months. Before treatment were 12 patients PCR positive in CSF, six in plasma, and 10 in urine. Five were parallel positive in CSF and plasma and four in all three body fluids. Urine after treatment was positive in seven (28%) cases and completely negative after 3 months. The PCR has had relative high sensitivity (44 %), but does not rich the sensitivity of antibody index (88%). Supported by grant MZCR 6244; 111300003.\n\nConsumption of imipenem correlates with β-lactam resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa S12.5\n\nLepper PMa, Högel Jb, Trautmann Ma, Grusa Ec. a Department of Medical Microbiology and Hygiene, University of ULM, ULM, Germany, b Department of Biostatistics, University of ULM, ULM, Germany, c Hospital Memmingen, Central Pharmacy, Memmingen, Germany\n\nPurpose: In the present study we investigated the monthly consume of three anti-pseudomonas-active antibiotics, namely imipenem, piperacillin/tazobactam (PT) and ceftazidime during a period of 3 years (1997–2000). The use of these antibiotics was correlated to the rate of resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Results: Inspection of the time series for use of imipenem, ceftazidime, and PT, and the corresponding time series for resistance (each available from July 1997 to July 2000) indicates a remarkable coincidence between use of imipenem and resistance against the three antibiotics mentioned. Pearsons's coefficient of correlation for the use of imipenem and the resistance against imipenem was 0.62 (P<0.001), between imipenem use and PT resistance was 0.57 (P<0.005), and between imipenem use and ceftazidim resistance 0.56 (P<0.005). We found positive regression coefficients quantifying an association with imipenem use in the same month (P<0.01) and with the use during the preceding month (P<0.05). The same was true when checking dependence of ceftadizime resistance (P<0.05) and PT resistance (P<0.01) on imipenem use observed during the same month. Neither the use of ceftadizime nor of PT could be identified as factors creating resistance to one of the three antibiotics under consideration within a reasonable period of time. Conclusion: There might be a strong pressure towards resistance created by carbapenems. This could limit the use of carbapenems for initial empiric therapy.\n\nTreat hard and fast: short course antibiotic treatment and its relation with patient compliance and effectiveness S12.6\n\nPerez-Gorricho BPGa, Ripoll Mb, Pechere JCc. a Niño Jesus Hospital, Infectious Diseases, Madrid, Spain, b INSALUD, Outpatient Consult, Madrid, Spain, c University of Geneve, Microbiology, Geneve, Switzerland\n\n‘Treat hard and fast’: Short course antibiotic treatment and its relation with patient compliance and effectiveness. Finding the important implications for the way in which physicians manage patients with mild–moderate respiratory tract infections, and the relation of this management with the perception of antibiotic effectiveness, and the compliance with the antibiotic regimen has been the main purpose of the research. In a pan-European market research study of more than 3000 patients, designed to determine behaviour to the antibiotic management of mild-moderate respiratory tract infections, patient expectations of antibiotic therapy were identified, particularly those aspects that relate to efficacy and compliance. The study identifies three key drivers of patients perceived antibiotic efficacy: length of antibiotic course, time to onset of symptom relief and time to complete resolution of symptoms. The results demonstrate that once daily treatment for short periods is perceived by patients to be significantly more effective than longer antibiotic courses and thus better meets patient expectations of therapy. In this study, a macrolide, azithromycin, was selected as the drug therapy of shortest course, being the antibiotic with the shortest dosage schedule for common outpatient infections. The perception of efficacy with short course therapy also correlates with overall satisfaction with management by the physician and with patient compliance with antibiotic therapy.\n\nConsequences of the prophylaxis by amoxicillin on the colonization of the gastrointestinal tract of newborns S12.7\n\nJaureguy Fa, Carton Mb, Butel MJa, Panel Pc, Ghnassia JCd, Doucet-Populaire Fa. a Université Paris5, Microbiologie, Paris, France, b INSERM, U88, St. Maurice, France, c CH Versailles, Gynecologie, Le Chesnay, France, d CH Versailles, Microbiologie, Le Chesnay, France\n\nPurpose of the study: Group B streptococci (GBS) remain a major cause of neonatal infections. Consensus guidelines have recommended an intrapartum antibioprophylaxis by amoxicillin, which has reduced the incidence of early-onset neonatal GBS infections. However, an increased incidence of beta-lactam-resistant Gram-negative neonatal sepsis has been reported. The aim of our study was to analyse the consequences of this antibioprophylaxis on the intestinal microbial colonization of newborns. A study of the fecal flora was carried out on 50 stools samples from 3 days-old newborns divided into groups: group A intrapartum treated mothers (n=25); and group B untreated mothers (n=25). Both groups were matched with regards to known factors affecting intestinal microbial colonization: gestational age, type of delivery and feeding.\n\nResults: Colonization by enterobacteria and enterococci was not significantly different and occurrence of amoxicillin-resistant enterobacteria was similar (11/13 and 13/16 in groups A and B, respectively). However, the colonization by clostridia was modified: the number of newborns colonized was significantly less important in group A than in group B (group A: 3/25 and group B: 10/25 P<0.05).\n\nConclusion: In our study, intrapartum antibioprophylaxis did not affect intestinal colonization by aerobes but reduced significantly colonization by clostridia, potentially anaerobic pathogens.\n\nImpact of an antibiotic policy restricting the use of β-lactams and macrolides on the incidence of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhoea in general medical, renal and elderly patients S12.8\n\nBoswell TCa, Pacey Sb, Broomfield Sc, Westmoreland Dc, Yates Cc. a Nottingham City Hospital, Microbiology, Nottingham, UK, b Nottingham City Hospital, Pharmacy, Nottingham, UK, c Nottingham City Hospital, Infection Control, Nottingham, UK\n\nThe purpose of the study: To investigate the short-term impact of a new antibiotic policy for the treatment of urinary and respiratory infections on the incidence of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhoea (CDAD) in hospitalised medical, elderly care and renal patients. The results obtained: A policy restricting the use of β-lactams (except parenteral penicillin), and promoting alternative antibiotics including levofloxacin for pneumonia, and doxycycline for non-pneumonic respiratory infections, was launched in July 2000. As a result there was a significant and sustained reduction in use of aminopenicillins, cefuroxime and macrolides, with a corresponding increase in doxycycline and levofloxacin. The incidence of CDAD was determined during the 1st 12 months of the new policy and compared to the last 12 months of the old policy. The incidence of CDAD fell from 10.02 to 4.91 per 1000 patients, and from 1.2 to 0.59 per 1000 in-patient days (P<0.00001). In contrast, there was no change in the incidence of CDAD in other specialties (surgery, oncology etc.) that had not introduced the new policy. There was no change in the incidence of nosocomial bacteraemia with quinolone-resistant coliforms or MRSA, despite the increased use of levofloxacin. Conclusions: Hospital-wide reduction of β-lactam and macrolide use in medical patients can result in a significant and immediate reduction in CDAD. Longer follow-up will determine if this effect is sustained.\n\nOutcome of patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia treated according to infectious disease society of america guidelines S12.9\n\nHershberger E, Zervos MJ. William Beaumont Hospital, Research Institute, Royal Oak, USA\n\nWe conducted a retrospective study to evaluate the outcome of hospitalized patients with documented Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia based on IDSA guidelines. From 1996 to 1999, patients with documented S. pneumoniae pneumonia were identified through microbiology reports. Medical records were reviewed for outcome based on IDSA guidelines. Two hundred and thirty-one patients were identified, 137 with diagnosis of CAP were evaluated. Outcome based on antimicrobial therapy, Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI), and pathogen susceptibility was evaluated. The treatment groups evaluated were: cephalosporin (C) (n=19), fluoroquinolone (FQ) (n=54), C+macrolide (M) (n=19), C+FQ (n=14), and macrolide (n=31). The percent cure rate for each group was 89, 91, 89, 93, and 90%, respectively. Sixty-five patients had penicillin non-susceptible S. pneumoniae (PNSSP), 24 intermediate (MIC=0.1–1 mcg/ml) and 41 resistant (MIC>2 mcg/ml). The overall cure rate in the PNSSP group was 46%, with success rate of 80% in FQ group, 38% in C+M, 36% in penicillin (PCN), 13% in M, and 50% in C. In patients with multi-drug resistant S. pneumoniae (n=47) (MDRSP), the cure rates were 83, 36, 14, 25, and 15% for patients receiving FQ, PCN, C+M, C+FQ, and M, respectively. Patients in the FQ group had significantly higher cure rate (P=0.0049). Patients with MDRSP had significantly better outcome with FQ compared to the other treatment regimens.\n\nUse of imipenem/cilastatin i.v.
