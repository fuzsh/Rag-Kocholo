        "text": "William Robert Young (born 20 January 1979) is a British singer-songwriter and actor from Wokingham, England, who came to prominence after winning the 2002 inaugural series of the ITV talent contest Pop Idol, making him the first winner of the worldwide Idol franchise. His double A-sided debut single \"Anything Is Possible\" / \"Evergreen\" was released two weeks after the show's finale and became the fastest-selling debut single in the UK. Young also came in fifth place in World Idol performing the single \"Light My Fire\" written by the band the Doors. As a teenager, Young studied politics at the University of Exeter before moving to London, where he studied musical theatre at Arts Educational School. Young put his studies on hold in late 2001 to become a contestant on Pop Idol. After winning the competition the following year, he released his debut album From Now On (2002) which went straight to number one. Friday's Child (2003) followed and enjoyed greater success, eventually going platinum five times in the UK and spawning three top five singles. His following albums Keep On (2005), Let It Go (2008) and Echoes (2011) also went multi-platinum and his most recent release 85% Proof (2015) became his fourth UK number-one album. His albums have spawned many songs that have achieved top ten positions in the UK, four of which went to the number one spot. Young has also undertaken numerous concert tours, and has accumulated multiple honours, including two Brit Awards from 12 nominations, and the estimated worldwide sale of over eight million albums. Young's net worth was estimated at Â£13.5 million in April 2012.Alongside his music career, Young has acted in film, on stage and in television. For his performance in the 2013 London revival of the musical Cabaret, he was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Musical. He has also participated in philanthropy and released books Anything is Possible (2002), On Camera, Off Duty (2004) and his autobiography Funny Peculiar (2012).\n\nChristopher Lee, born in Belgravia, London in 1922, was a multi-talented actor and singer who amassed a legendary career spanning nearly seven decades. His early life was marked by a rich cultural exposure, with schooling in Switzerland and later Wellington College. Unbeknownst to many, his first professional ambition was not acting; instead, he initially sought a career in diplomacy before the outbreak of World War II redirected his path. Lee served in the Royal Air Force and Special Forces during the war, an experience that honed his resilience and would later inform his gripping portrayals of complex characters. Lee's acting career launched in the late 1940s, but it wasn't until the late 1950s that he became synonymous with horror, playing the role of Count Dracula in a series of Hammer Horror films. These performances solidified him as a titan of the genre and earned him international acclaim. However, he was far from being typecast, displaying remarkable range across diverse roles. His tall stature, deep voice, and intense gaze made him an ideal choice for villainous characters, most notably Saruman in The Lord of the Rings trilogy and Count Dooku in the Star Wars prequels. In addition to his illustrious acting career, Lee also demonstrated a passion for music. He released several albums and singles in various genres, showcasing his deep, resonant voice. His musical endeavors ranged from opera to heavy metal, the latter of which earned him a place in the \"Metal Hammer\" Golden Gods Awards in 2010. Christopher Lee passed away in 2015, leaving behind a vast body of work that continues to inspire generations of actors and entertain audiences worldwide. His legacy is a testament to his versatility, dedication, and enduring influence in the entertainment industry."
