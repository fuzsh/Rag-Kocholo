The Asian monsoon anticyclone (AMA) represents one of the\nwettest regions in the lower stratosphere (LS) and is a key contributor to\nthe global annual maximum in LS water vapour. While the AMA wet pool is\nlinked with persistent convection in the region and horizontal confinement\nof the anticyclone, there remain ambiguities regarding the role of\ntropopause-overshooting convection in maintaining the regional LS water\nvapour maximum. This study tackles this issue using a unique set of\nobservations from aboard the high-altitude M55-Geophysica aircraft deployed\nin Nepal in summerÂ 2017 within the EU StratoClim project. We use a\ncombination of airborne measurements (water vapour, ice water, water\nisotopes, cloud backscatter) together with ensemble trajectory modelling\ncoupled with satellite observations to characterize the processes\ncontrolling water vapour and clouds in the confined lower stratosphere (CLS)\nof the AMA. Our analysis puts in evidence the dual role of overshooting\nconvection, which may lead to hydration or dehydration depending on the\nsynoptic-scale tropopause temperatures in the AMA. We show that all of the\nobserved CLS water vapour enhancements are traceable to convective events\nwithin the AMA and furthermore bear an isotopic signature of the overshooting\nprocess. A surprising result is that the plumes of moist air with mixing\nratios nearly twice the background level can persist for weeks whilst\nrecirculating within the anticyclone, without being subject to irreversible\ndehydration through ice settling. Our findings highlight the importance of\nconvection and recirculation within the AMA for the transport of water into the\nstratosphere.",

        "text": "Water vapour in the lower stratosphere has a direct impact on surface climate and stratospheric ozone chemistry (e.g.Â Dessler et al., 2013; Dvortsov and Solomon, 2001; Anderson et al., 2017). The variability of global lower stratospheric water vapour is, to first order, regulated by the minimum temperature in the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) â the main gateway for stratospheric entry of tropospheric moisture (e.g. Fueglistaler et al., 2009, and references therein). This way, the variation of stratospheric water vapour follows the annual cycle of TTL temperatures experiencing the minimum during Austral summer, when the TTL is coldest and driest above the western Pacific region (e.g. Randel and Jensen, 2013). During boreal summer, one of the primary contributors to the annual maximum of lower stratospheric water vapour is the Asian monsoon (e.g. Bannister et al., 2004; Fueglistaler and Haynes, 2005; Ueyama et al., 2018) and the associated Asian summer monsoon anticycloneÂ (AMA).\n\nThe AMA is one of the largest atmospheric circulation features on Earth, owing its existence to frequent deep convection above southern Asia and the Bay of Bengal, strong surface heating over the Tibetan Plateau, and orographic updraughts at the southern slopes of the Himalayas (e.g. Hoskins and Rodwell, 1995). The AMA is characterized by a persistent maximum of water vapour extending up to 68âhPa (Park et al., 2007; Santee et al., 2017), which makes it the wettest region in the boreal summer lower stratosphere. Generally, this large-scale maximum is conditioned by convective uplift of moist air in the Asian monsoon region and its horizontal confinement within the anticyclone (Dethof et al., 1999; Ploeger et al.,Â 2015).\n\nThe transport of moist air into the stratosphere occurs via different pathways: slow radiatively driven ascent (e.g. Garny and Randel, 2013), fast convective overshooting (e.g. Fu et al., 2006), and adiabatic transport across the horizontal boundaries of the AMA (e.g. Pan et al., 2016) into the tropical and midlatitude stratosphere (Randel et al., 2010; Wright et al., 2011; Dethof et al., 1999; Vogel et al., 2016; Rolf et al., 2018; NÃ¼tzel et al., 2019). The role of different transport pathways, particularly of the convective overshooting and its predominant source regions, is subject of ongoing debate.\n\nA relatively small impact of overshooting convection on AMA humidity is found by James et al.Â (2008), Wright et al.Â (2011), Randel et al.Â (2015) and Zhang et al.Â (2016), whereas Fu et al.Â (2006), Ueyama et al.Â (2018) and Brunamonti et al.Â (2018) suggest that this process can be an important contributor to the total water in the Asian TTL. The convective impact of different source regions (e.g. Bay of Bengal, Tibetan Plateau, southern slopes of the Himalayas or Sichuan Basin) is also under debate (Bannister et al., 2004; Bergman et al., 2012; Fu et al., 2006; Lelieveld et al., 2007; Wright et al., 2011; Devasthale and Fueglistaler, 2010; James et al., 2008; Park et al., 2007; Tissier and Legras, 2016; Legras and Bucci, 2020). In general, there is no consensus regarding the primary convective source regions, nor regarding the net convective effect of deep convection on the CLS water vapour, which points out the complexity of physical processes in the AMA system.\n\nNotably, most of the observational evidence regarding the mechanisms controlling AMA water is derived from passive satellite measurements, which due to their coarse vertical resolution cannot resolve the small-scale processes such as moistening produced by localized injections of ice. The high-resolution measurements of water vapour within the AMA using small balloons and research aircraft have only recently become available (Bian et al., 2012; Gottschaldt et al., 2018; Vernier et al., 2018; Brunamonti et al., 2018). The most extensive set of high-resolution measurements including water vapour, ice water, water isotopic ratio, aerosols and various tracers is provided by the StratoClim aircraft campaign, which was held in JulyâAugustÂ 2017 and involved the high-altitude M55-Geophysica aircraft deployed in Kathmandu, Nepal (Stroh et al., 2022; KrÃ¤mer et al., 2020).\n\nIn this study, we combine local airborne measurements with global satellite observations to characterize the mechanisms of convective impact on water vapour and clouds through both mass and energy transport above the cold point tropopause. We provide observational evidence of convectively induced lower stratosphere hydration and dehydration of both irreversible and reversible types. The link between the local variations and phase transitions of water with deep convection across the Asian anticyclone is investigated using ensemble trajectory modelling constrained by satellite detections of convective cloud tops. SectionÂ 2 of this article describes the experimental and modelling setup, and Sect.Â 3 provides the satellite view of synoptic-scale development in the TTL during the campaign period and presents the ensemble of airborne measurements. The convective source regions and their AMA-wide effects on water vapour are analysed in Sect.Â 4. SectionÂ 5 documents and analyses the observed processes controlling water vapour above the tropopause and is followed by the discussion and summary in Sect.Â 6.\n\nThe influence of overshooting convection on the observed water vapour variability was investigated using TRACZILLA ensemble trajectory modelling constrained by satellite cloud imaging and ERA5 reanalysis (see Sect.Â 2.4). FigureÂ 4a displays a binned ensemble of the measured water vapour mixing ratios colour-coded by the convective hits fraction. The trajectory analysis suggests that the convective origin is characteristic to anomalously wet and anomalously dry parcels, which points out the dual role of overshooting convection on the AMA water vapour, i.e.Â hydration/dehydration. The link to overshooting convection is particularly obvious for a strong water vapour enhancement peaking at the 399âK level, which corresponds to F2 of the warm/wet mode (see Sect.Â 5.1 for detailed analysis of this flight), and for a smaller enhancement at 403âK, corresponding to F7 (see Sect.Â 5.2). The results for the individual flights are provided in Fig.Â S3. The hydrated features (layers of enhanced water vapour, exceeding 1-Ï of the campaign ensemble) are denoted throughout the article as Ax or Bx, where x is the flight number.\n\nThe elevated convective hits fraction is also characteristic to the driest bins between 370â400âK, corresponding to F8 of the cold/dry mode with large-scale convection in the flight domain. While the driest parcels are linked with the local or nearby convective events, the wettest ones are traced back to distant convective events all along the circulation pattern of the anticyclone, which occurred several days before their outflows were sampled by the Geophysica aircraft. The only exception is F6, which was influenced by a young outflow of a large convective system in the vicinity of the flight (see Sect.Â 4.2 and Fig.Â S4).\n\nDownload\n\n4.1âIsotopic composition of convective plumes\n\nThe relation of moist layers with overshooting convection can be reliably diagnosed using the isotopic ratio of water (HDO/H2O ), which is enhanced for water vapour molecules sublimated from ice (Moyer et al., 1996; Hanisco et al., 2007). FigureÂ 4b clearly shows that the wetter parcels in the lower stratosphere are isotopically enhanced, and the wettest of them bear the strongest isotopic signature. This unambiguously points out that the hydrated layers have been produced by overshooting ice geysers. Remarkably, the wet and isotopically enhanced pixels in Fig.Â 4b are found as high as the 420âK level, which is 30â50âK above the cold point. Given the diabatic heating rate of 1.1âKâdâ1 in the AMA and the average recirculation time of 16âd within the anticyclone (Legras and Bucci, 2020), these hydrated parcels could, in principle, have recirculated twice before being sampled by the aircraft.\n\n4.2âGeographical distribution of convective sources\n\nFigureÂ 5 shows the composite map of convective clouds (highest cloud classes), which are linked by trajectories with the observed hydrated and isotopically enhanced wet-and-heavy parcels and thereby represent the most probable sources of the convectively processed CLS air sampled by the aircraft. The wet-and-heavy parcels are defined as those located above the local CPT with water mixing ratios exceeding 1Â standard deviation from the median (dashed curve in Fig.Â 4b) at a given potential temperature level and with isotopic ratios above â400ââ° (except for F1 and F5 where the HDO measurements are not available and the selection is done based on H2O only). The fraction of wet-and-heavy parcels to all parcels sampled above the local CPT varies from 0.5â% (F6) to 11â% (F2) between the different flights. No wet-and-heavy parcels have been detected in F8, which is why it is not displayed inÂ Fig.Â 5.\n\nDownload\n\nThe composite map suggests a broad geographical scatter of the convective clouds across the Asian anticyclone. The lifetime of hydrated parcels, as inferred from the back trajectories, ranges from â¼12âh (F6) to about 12.7âd (F7) (see Fig.Â S4 for convective age in individual flights). The wet-and-heavy parcels sampled during the warm/wet mode (F1 through F4) originate from various convective systems in northeastern China and the Korean Peninsula, all of them occurring north of 35ââN. The convective age for these parcels varies between 2.6 and 9.9âd. Sensibly, the shortest age corresponds to the lower-height moist layer at the 390âK level (F2), whereas the longest age is found for the wet-and-heavy parcels detected as high as at 410âK in F4. The moist features in the flight F2 (A2 and B2; see Sect.Â 5), found at 390 and 399âK levels, are sourced to different convective events that occurred 2.6 and 4.7âd before being sampled by the Geophysica aircraft. We note that while the 1ÏÂ error of the age estimates is generally less than an hour, the attribution of convective sources largely depends on the cloud top data. In particular, the improved v2018.1 trajectory product coupled with NWC SAF geostationary data analysis provided a qualitatively better correlation between the distribution of convective hits and wet-and-heavy parcels as compared with the product used by Bucci et al.Â (2020).\n\nWhile the warm/wet mode flights were largely influenced by convection in the northeastern part of the AMA, the wet-and-heavy parcels sampled during flights F5âF7 are sourced to various different locations. A large convective system over northeastern India in the vicinity of the flight on the same day is responsible for the hydration feature in F6 at the 380âK level. The convective source of the wet air sampled by F5 is found above western India, although we note that no isotopic data are available for this flight, whereas the number of parcels with a mixing ratio exceeding 1Â standard deviation is small for this flight. In flight F7, the enhanced water vapour features above 400âK (A7 and B7; see Sect.Â 5) originate from two different sources: the lower-level feature (A7) is traced back to a group of relatively small systems along the eastern Chinese coast that occurred 3.9âd before the measurement, whereas the upper one (B7) originates from a large cluster of small-scale convective systems in the centre of the Asian anticyclone above the northern foothills of the Himalayas. We note that this particular region is marked by enhanced water vapour amount according to MLS averages over the campaign period (cf.Â Fig.Â 1b). The B7 parcels have thus followed the anticyclonic circulation path for nearly a full loop before arriving to the flight domain, which tookÂ 12.7âd.\n\nDownload\n\nThe potential for a vapour-rich parcel travelling within the AMA CLS to permanently hydrate the stratosphere is determined by the Lagrangian temperature history. We did not analyse the RHi variation along the trajectories; however, we quantified the minimum temperatures encountered across AMA using high-resolution GPS-RO profiling. As follows from Fig.Â 1a, the subtropical part of the AMA has never cooled below the H2O saturation mixing ratios of around 8âppmv in JulyâAugustÂ 2017, enabling the vapour-rich patches to travel along the northern flank of the anticyclone without freezing. Remarkably, the majority of convective systems identified as the most probable sources of wet-and-heavy parcels (shown in Fig.Â 5 and marked by black pixels in Fig.Â 1a) have occurred within the warm tropopause environment in the northern subtropical part ofÂ AMA.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the probed wet-and-heavy parcels (shown along the flight tracks in Fig.Â 5) are all located in the northernmost part of the flight domain, i.e.Â nearer the centre of the AMA. This is consistent with the spatial distribution of AMA CLS water vapour inferred from MLS (Fig.Â 1b), showing the maxima above the Tibetan Plateau and Sichuan region, which is around the centre of the anticyclone. With that, the air circulating near the outer edge of the anticyclone is bound to pass the colder TTL above central India and the southern slopes, where the organized large-scale convection occurring during the second part of the campaign (cf.Â Fig.Â 1) has led to cooling and dehydration around the CPT level. The efficiency of the convectively induced dehydration, counteracting with the convective moistening in the warmer TTL regions of the AMA, is considered on a case-by-case basis in the next section.\n\nThe occurrence of water vapour enhancements in the lower stratosphere associated with overshooting convection has been reported in several studies based on in situ measurements in the deep tropics over western Africa (Khaykin et al., 2009; Schiller et al., 2009), northern Australia (Kley et al., 1982; Corti et al., 2008), South America (Khaykin et al., 2013), Central America (Sargent et al., 2014), and the western Pacific (Jensen et al., 2020), as well as at midlatitudes over the North American monsoon (Hanisco et al., 2007; Weinstock et al., 2007; Smith et al., 2017) and Asian monsoon (Vernier et al., 2018; Brunamonti et al., 2018; KrÃ¤mer et al., 2020). We note that the reported cases represent a small fraction of in situ measurements acquired; there is typically no more than one case of water vapour enhancement above the tropopause detected during a given field campaign.\n\nCompared to other field campaigns, the StratoClim aircraft deployment in Nepal provided an ample sampling of moist layers above the tropopause. Their convective overshooting origin is unambiguously supported by both the enhanced isotopic ratios in the moist plumes and by their traceability to convective events. Notably, the occurrence of lower stratospheric moist plumes above the monsoon regions is also supported by satellite observations (Fu et al., 2006; Schwartz et al., 2013; Werner et al., 2020), whereas the enhanced water isotopic ratios observed over these regions (Hanisco et al., 2007; Randel et al., 2012) support the role of overshooting convection in maintaining the water vapour maximum in the North American and Asian monsoon anticyclones. This process adds to the radiatively driven slow ascent of wet air through the warm tropopause in the northern part of the AMA. Another possible pathway of water into the CLS in addition to the slow ascent and overshooting may be the isentropic transport across the CPT from the Tibetan Plateau (characterized by highest CPT) to the southern slopes of the Himalayas.\n\nUsing MLS observations and OLR data, Randel et al.Â (2015) concluded that stronger convection in the Asian monsoon region leads to colder and drier lower stratosphere, whereas the opposite is true for the weaker convection. They also pointed out the importance of subseasonal variations of deep convection driving the water vapour amount near the tropopause. Interestingly, the composite maps of OLR anomalies for wet and dry modes (Fig.Â 5 in Randel et al., 2015) reveal an eastâwest dipole, and in both cases this dipole is centred exactly on the StratoClim flight domain. Furthermore, the evolution of the UTLS conditions in the flight domain, switching from warm/wet to cold/dry mode over the course of the campaign, allowed for sampling the opposite-sign effects of deep convection on the water vapour above the tropopause.\n\nThe warm/wet mode sampled during the early flights revealed substantial enhancements of the water vapour mixing ratio reaching above 10âppmv (twice the background) and as high as the 400âK (18.2âkm) level, but it revealed very little evidence for dehydration upstream. By contrast, the second (cold/dry mode) period of the campaign with organized large-scale convection inside and close to the flight domain led to synoptic-scale CPT cooling and a drastic drop of water vapour by â¼30â% near the tropopause. We note though that the dehydration layer did not extend above 395âK, whereas in the upper layers, the excess of water vapour was subject to a transient phase transition, resulting in an outbreak of cirrus at levels up to 415âK (18.9âkm). A similar inference was made by Brunamonti et al.Â (2018) on the basis of balloon soundings of water vapour and ozone in Nepal as part of StratoClim campaign in 2017. They argued that overshooting convection is responsible for an isolated maximum of H2O in the CLS observed in JulyÂ 2017, whereas the water vapour minimum at the CPT level is caused by synoptic-scale cold anomaly above the southern slopes that maximized around 9Â August.\n\nOur trajectory analysis suggests that convective origin is characteristic of the wettest and the driest parcels (Fig.Â 4a), which points out the dual role of overshooting convection on the AMA water vapour. With that, we note that the probability of dehydration decreases with the age of convective outflow, ascending within the AMA at an average 1.1âKâdâ1 rate in potential temperature (Legras and Bucci, 2020). This way, a hydrated air mass, circulating within the confined anticyclone, progressively moves up and away from the tropopause and becomes less likely to encounter permanent dehydration. A similar inference was made by Ueyama et al.Â (2018) on the basis of trajectory-based microphysical simulations. Although, as we showed here, the secondary clouds can form as high as the 410â415âK level, their lifetime is limited to a fraction of day, which does not enable a permanent removal of water vapour from the CLS. Thus, a hydrated plume that survived a full turnover within the AMA would retain its moisture and eventually loft it into the free stratosphere.\n\nThe question on the role of different AMA sub-regions in the cross-tropopause transport of water has been addressed by a number of studies quoted in the introduction. With that, there appears to be no consensus regarding the dominance of a particular sub-region. In this study, the majority of the observed wet plumes in the CLS are traced back to convective events in the northeastern part of the AMA, which influenced the flights during the first (warm/wet) period of the campaign. The other flights have sampled wet air originating from convection above the Tibetan Plateau as well as northeastern and northwestern India. Given the limited time period of the campaign and the large subseasonal variability of the Asian monsoon, this inference may not be fully representative of the climatological convective source regions. Nevertheless, it can be concluded that convection occurring in the northern and northeastern parts of the AMA, characterized by a warmer tropopause, is more likely to produce persistent moistening of the lower stratosphere.\n\nThe airborne measurements in the AMA within StratoClim have revealed the abundance of moist convective plumes in the CLS. In this respect, the Asian anticyclone is very similar to its North American counterpart. Indeed, both anticyclones extend well into the extratropics, where a warmer tropopause enables unimpeded transport of large amounts of water vapour. An important finding of our study is the persistence and recirculation of moist convective plumes in the confined LS of the AMA. To our knowledge, such phenomena were never before observed in the deep tropics. The recirculation of water-vapour-enhanced air masses was reported in the Antarctic and Arctic vortices (VÃ¶mel et al., 1995; Khaykin et al., 2013) where the hydration of the lower stratosphere occurs through sedimentation of ice polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs).\n\nOverall, our results suggest a complexity of processes controlling water abundance and its aggregate state in the lower stratosphere of the AMA. The strong isotopic enhancements specific to the moist layers in the CLS and their traceability to convective events consistently suggest that overshooting convection is an important contributor to the seasonal maximum of water vapour in the AMA lower stratosphere. At the same time, the large-scale organized convection in the southern part of the AMA is shown to cause synoptic-scale dehydration around the tropopause through radiative cooling. Another mechanism of dehydration is the overshooting of ice crystals into the supersaturated environment above the tropopause, which leads to their rapid growth and sedimentation. The evidence of such a process was obtained in a particular flight (F8) and will be a subject of a separate study.\n\nFurther insights into the AMA gaseous/particular composition and dynamics will be provided by an upcoming airborne campaign within the Asian summer monsoon Chemical and Climate Impact Project (ACCLIP; https://www2.acom.ucar.edu/acclip, last access: 28Â FebruaryÂ 2022), which will sample the western Pacific mode of the monsoon and eastward eddy shedding using NASA WB-57 and NCAR GV aircraft. The stratospheric impact of overshooting convection in the North American monsoon is a primary target of the Dynamics and Chemistry of the Summer Stratosphere (https://dcotss.org/, last access: 28Â FebruaryÂ 2022) project, involving ER-2 high-altitude aircraft.\n\nAfchine, A., Rolf, C., Costa, A., Spelten, N., Riese, M., Buchholz, B., Ebert, V., Heller, R., Kaufmann, S., Minikin, A., Voigt, C., ZÃ¶ger, M., Smith, J., Lawson, P., Lykov, A., Khaykin, S., and KrÃ¤mer, M.: Ice particle sampling from aircraft â influence of the probing position on the ice water content, Atmos.
