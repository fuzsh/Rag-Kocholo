        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nProgrammed antigenic variation is the ability of eukaryotic microbes to alter the antigenic molecules exposed on their surfaces by mutually exclusive expression of a multigene family of variant surface antigens (1). This phenomenon has been observed in a wide range of pathogenic microorganisms, where it enables them to escape attack by the hosts’ immune system. The free-living microbe Paramecium tetraurelia can also switch surface proteins. Early studies revealed the presence of different serotypes using antibodies raised by injection of paramecia into rabbits (2). The literature usually refers to the responsible proteins as surface antigens (SAgs), by analogy to the systems in related parasitic ciliates (3, 4), although a more precise term would be phenotypic variation. Several studies indicate that the phenotypic variation of SAgs may protect paramecia from predators, either by masking mechanisms or by jettisoning antigens during attacks (5, 6). It is not clear whether variation has other roles, as it can also be triggered by changing environmental factors, such as temperature or salinity, or changing biotic factors, such as availability of food or addition of homologous antibodies (7). Such phenotypic variation has been reported for many free-living fungi and protists as well as most pathogens, and common mechanisms seem to be involved for distantly related species (8). This makes it attractive to use nonpathogenic model organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Paramecium tetraurelia to study the genome organization and epigenetic mechanisms controlling antigenic variation (9, 10).\n\nA variety of mechanisms have been implicated in antigenic variation in different species. A well-studied example involving DNA rearrangements is Tryposonosma brucei, where gene conversion events copy entire genes or fragments of genes into active expression sites; segmental gene conversions also create new chimeric genes, thus increasing antigenic variability (11). However, even in T. brucei, in situ switches can occur with epigenetic chromatin modifications instead of DNA sequence alterations (11, 12). In many organisms, in situ switches seem to be the rule, e.g., the highly variable erythrocyte membrane protein 1 of Plasmodium falciparum (PfEMP1) and the variant surface proteins (VSPs) of Giardia lamblia. Interestingly, the silencing of nonexpressed surface antigens occurs at different levels, as P. falciparum regulates PfEMP1 at the level of transcription, whereas G. lamblia transcribes all VSP genes and then posttranscriptionally cleaves mRNA of the nonexpressed genes using the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway (13, 14).\n\nIn many species (e.g., free-living and parasitic fungi as well as P. falciparum and T. brucei), surface antigen genes have a subtelomeric location. It has been suggested that spreading of telomeric heterochromatin into subtelomeric regions might result in the transcriptional silencing of surface antigen genes (15). In P. falciparum, chromatin remodeling is involved in antigenic variation of the var gene family, as silent loci show high levels of H3K9 trimethylation, whereas active loci are characterized by H3 acetylation (reviewed in reference 16). In some organisms, such as T. brucei and P. falciparum, activation and silencing of the genes in association with epigenetic chromatin modifications were shown to involve transport of the genes into distinct subnuclear compartments, which allow active transcription (12, 17). In contrast, the posttranscriptionally controlled Giardia antigen genes do not show preferred subtelomeric localization. An involvement of transcription-regulating small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) comparable to the posttranscriptional Giardia system has not been shown for any organism exhibiting a telomere position effect of its antigen genes.\n\nThe serotype of Paramecium tetraurelia is due to the expression of a single surface antigen gene (SAg), and serotypes are inherited in a non-Mendelian manner, meaning that the gene expression pattern becomes transmitted to progeny by unknown epigenetic mechanisms (18). Serotype switches can occur at any time without the need for sexual recombination. Individual serotype proteins show highly variable sequence areas in their central regions, indicating that diversity plays a major role in protein function. Comparison of the genes indicated that all these surface antigen proteins have an extraordinarily high percentage of cysteine which is distributed throughout the polypeptide with a highly specific periodicity (19, 20) which is similar to the VSG in T. brucei (21). Both organisms were also reported to use GPI (glycosylphosphatidylinositol) anchors to tether the surface antigen to the outer leaflet of the external membrane (22, 23). Paramecium surface antigens share some similarity in their N- and C-terminal regions but have highly variable regions in the center (4, 19). Analysis of the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS ratio) showed a low proportion of nonsynonymous base changes in the terminal regions of the genes, indicating the action of purifying selection to conserve the amino acid sequence, whereas the central areas show high ratios of nonsynonymous substitutions (24). Interestingly, these central regions often consist of internal tandem repeats. This suggested that the central region was responsible for the diversity of the surface proteins, which would be selected for during evolution, whereas the conserved terminal regions might have roles in maintaining tertiary structure and membrane anchoring. Immunological analyses support this hypothesis, indicating that the variable central parts are exposed to the medium, whereas the N- and C-terminal areas are immunologically hidden close to the membrane (25).\n\nWe demonstrated that Paramecium serotypes are controlled by RNA interference (26). Knockdown of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Rdr3) resulted in a stable coexpression of all tested surface antigens rather than the exclusive expression of one surface antigen, as usually occurs during antigenic variation. This was accompanied by the disappearance of endogenous siRNAs. In contrast to the report of RNAi-controlled VSP regulation in Giardia, small RNAs seem to regulate Paramecium serotypes at a transcriptional level rather than through mRNA stability.\n\nIn this study, we used bioinformatics methods to characterize the genetic properties of the SAg multigene family. Surprisingly, most of the genes in this family are not ohnologous genes, and moreover, several of them show gene duplicates located on the same macronuclear chromosome. Because of three successive whole-genome duplications, Paramecium tetraurelia became a model to study the parameters forcing gene duplicate retention and loss (27), allowing us to interpret our data on SAg ohnologs and other gene duplicates in context with the requirements for subtelomeric localization to build a model for serotype evolution, which includes the crucial parameters for RNAi-mediated, mutually exclusive expression of SAg genes described here.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe SAg gene family encodes large surface membrane-located proteins.\n\nEleven serotypes have been described for P. tetraurelia using immunological methods, but until recently, sequence data were available only for genes corresponding to 6 serotypes: 51A (28), 51B (29), 51C (20), 51D (30), 51G (31), and fragments of 51H (32). Although the limited available sequence data for Paramecium serotypes indicate some conserved sequences in the 5′ and 3′ coding regions of genes (20), this was not sufficient to allow a similarity-based database mining approach. Therefore, we used another exclusive feature of these proteins to identify further SAg genes in the genome: all serotypes sequenced so far showed a highly conserved cysteine periodicity throughout the protein, and we used a Pfam domain that was built accordingly for a proteome-wide in silico search (Paramecium peptides at ParameciumDB [33]). We extracted 96 candidate serotypes from the proteome with intact cysteine periodicity (Pfam E value, ≤10−9); Fig. S1A in the supplemental material shows the cysteine periodicity of 51Hβ and SAg 94, representative of all other proteins.\n\nTo decide whether genes have intact open reading frames, we manually reassembled the sequencing reads of the genome project. This was done to correct errors of the automated assembly and to verify start and stop codons by successive translation verifying N-terminal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) translocation signals and C-terminal GPI-anchoring peptides or transmembrane domains (see below). This was possible for 65 genes. Because of the high similarity of the 5′ and 3′ coding regions and because of a low coverage of loci on very tiny macronuclear chromosomes, a complete reassembly of 31 of the genes failed. It is thus not clear whether these are intact (protein coding) genes. The subsequent analyses were confined to the 65 correctly reassembled genes; see Table S1 in the supplemental material for details.\n\nThe 65 verified sequences were analyzed in more detail. Sixty of the proteins had N-terminal ER translocation signals (ER-TLS), suggesting that the proteins entered the secretory pathway (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). Of these, 55 SAgs contained C-terminal signal peptides predicting GPI anchors (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material). One of these genes (SAg 83) was probably a pseudogene, because of the presence of a stop codon in the predicted reading frame. Thus, there were 54 genes with the 8-amino-acid cysteine periodicity, which could encode surface proteins with a GPI anchor. These included the four previously described sequences (51B, 51C, 51D, and 51G) as well as the complete sequence of the 51H gene (only segments were published earlier). In addition, the serotype genes 51I and 51J were identified using the unpublished sequences of cDNA fragments (A. Valatka and H. Schmidt, personal communication). The genome sequence used strain P. tetraurelia d4-2, which has the genetic background of wild-type stock 51 but has the 51A serotype allele replaced by the 29A allele from stock 29. Thus, genes corresponding to 8 of the 11 known serotypes could be identified.\n\nThe gene sequences were also analyzed for the presence of potential transmembrane domains. In eight cases, C-terminal transmembrane domains were predicted. These proteins did not contain signal peptides for GPI anchors, suggesting that there might be an alternative mechanism for anchoring SAgs. Three of the genes contained ER-TLS, suggesting that the proteins would enter the secretory pathway, but the other five genes did not contain a detectable ER-TLS.\n\nPutative SAg genes are large (the average length of the coding region is 6.6 kb, compared to an average of 1.4 kb for all protein-coding genes of P. tetraurelia), which is in agreement with the sizes of previously sequenced SAg genes (see Fig. S4A in the supplemental material). However, most of the SAg genes do not contain introns (four genes each contain a single intron), whereas P. tetraurelia protein-coding genes contain an average of 2.9 introns. The G+C content (34.4%) is also higher than that of the average gene (30.4%) (see Fig. S4B in the supplemental material). There are four large superantigen genes with an average coding region of about 12 kb.\n\nSerotype isoforms result from intrachromosomal gene duplications.\n\nshows a neighbor joining tree of proteins indicating three separated phylogenetic clusters, as indicated by the background shading: all proteins with transmembrane domains, a cluster containing the 51D and 51H serotypes with their individual isoforms (see below), and the largest cluster, which includes the 29A, 51B (and isoforms), 51G, 51C, and 51I serotype proteins as well as the superantigens. Only SAg 3 cannot be related to one of the clusters. This clustering is consistent with previous immunological studies describing serotype proteins 51A, 51B, 51G, and 51Q as well as a group immunologically related to serotypes 51D and 51J (34), although the gene for serotype 51Q remains to be annotated.\n\nNext to a close relationship between individual serotype proteins, e.g., proteins 51D and 51J or proteins 51A, 51B, and 51G, the tree shows isoforms for the genes encoding 51B, 51D, and 51H. These show a very high degree of identity, including 91% identity between 51Hα and 51Hβ, an average identity of 79% for the four 51D isoforms, and an average identity of 82% for the four 51B isoforms, so their identity is drastically higher than the average for all SAgs (~27% identity). Although isogenes of the 51D gene were reported earlier (35) this was not reported for any other serotype gene in P. tetraurelia. Because of their high similarity, these isogenes appear to result from very recent gene duplications.\n\nAury et al. described the sequencing of the macronuclear genome and its evolution by three successive whole-genome duplications (WGD); consequently, the genome consists of a high number of ohnologous gene duplicates (36). As mentioned above, serotype genes share an individual degree of homology, and therefore, it seemed tempting to speculate that gene duplication in the context of whole-genome duplication also contributed to serotype diversity. However, this is not the case, because our data indicate that only 25 ohnologs of the ancient and intermediary WGD exist, but none of the classically described surface antigen genes have ohnologs ( ). The neighbor joining tree indicates that the transmembrane antigens (TMA) are separated, whereas SAgs showing ohnologous duplicates build a cluster in the center of the tree which is surrounded by small clusters of highly similar gene copies of the classical surface antigens. To analyze the chromosomal distribution of these genes, we mapped them to the genome assembly; most of the assembled scaffolds do indeed represent macronuclear chromosomes, as telomere reads can be found at both scaffold ends (36). Surprisingly, mapping of the antigen genes to the genome annotation revealed that almost all of the individual isogenes are located on the same macronuclear chromosome ( ). This is true for the four 51B isogenes on scaffold 143 and two 51H isogenes on scaffold 142. In the case of the 51D isogenes, 51Dγ-1 and 51Dγ-2 are located on scaffold 159, and only 51J, which was originally described for the 51Dε isogene (30), is located on chromosome 128. Therefore, serotype isoforms appear to result from intrachromosomal duplication events. In contrast to these isogenes, chromosome 51 harbors four totally different SAg genes (51C, SAg 3, SAg 42, and 51G) which do not show any phylogenetic relationship. Most of the SAg genes do not show intrachromosomal isoforms, e.g., 29A on chromosome 106 (as well as all other genes not included in ).\n\nGenomic maps identify a subset of SAg genes close to telomere repeats.\n\nDuring the analysis of the gene maps, our attention was attracted to the gene position, as several genes appeared to be located close to the end of scaffolds, e.g., 29A and 51J ( ). To subsequently characterize chromosomal distribution, we had to consider the heterogeneity of Paramecium macronuclear chromosomes. In ciliates, there are two types of nuclei, because they show separation of germline and soma despite the fact that paramecia are unicellular organisms: the germline is represented by the micronuclei, which are responsible for sexual transmission, and the large macronuclei are responsible for somatic gene expression. During conjugation, macronuclei are generated from a zygotic nucleus by a complex process of DNA rearrangements and amplification to ~800n. During these processes, the large micronuclear chromosomes become shorter macronuclear chromosomes by two DNA elimination processes (reviewed in reference 37). Both precise elimination of IESs (internal elimination sequences) and the imprecise elimination of repeat sequences are responsible for heterogeneity of the macronuclear chromosomes (38). In other words, the macronuclear chromosomes exist in versions of different lengths. The published assembly ignores minority telomeres to obtain long scaffolds, so that the question of whether a particular surface antigen gene has a subtelomeric location cannot always be answered from the assembled genome sequence. To characterize SAg genes in the genomic context, we took advantage of the whole-genome sequence (36) data and extracted all reads from the genome project containing at least three telomeric repeats (CCC[CA]AA) and allowing a single mismatch. After removal of these repeats, the genomic part of the reads was mapped to the genome assembly similar to the approach described in reference 38. To confirm the position of the genomic part of these reads, we examined the linking information of the paired-end sequencing by extraction of read mates and their subsequent mapping (data not shown). We defined a telomeric site as a minimum of four overlapping reads within a range of 2 kb, and these telomeric sites together with the SAg genes are shown in . For our prediction of macronuclear heterogeneity, the literature reports molecular evidence by restriction mapping or pulsed-field electrophoresis for telomeric sites on scaffolds 51 and 106 (39, 40), which supports our approach and the further analysis of genome-wide telomeric sites. Surprisingly, telomeric sites often appeared close to SAg genes, and this was especially the case for the annotated antigens. To quantify this effect, we calculated the distance of the individual genes to the closest telomeric site and set this in relation to the E value of the alignment with the domain profiles from Pfam, thus representing the integrity of the cysteine periodicity of the individual genes. shows that the mean distance of the gene to telomeres increases drastically for proteins showing a less conserved cysteine periodicity (indicated by increasing Pfam E values). In fact, these genes show a more or less uniform distribution in the genome, comparable to that of the actin multigene family, which was used as a control. SAg genes encoding proteins with intact cysteine periodicity, reflected by low E value, e.g., the annotated antigens (SAgs 29A, 51Bα, 51C, 51Dα, 51Hα, 51I, and 51J), show close proximity to telomeric sites. This would indicate that selection pressure occurs on cysteine periodicity in subtelomeric regions, which would require telomere-dependent expression. However, to distinguish whether a correlation between ohnologs and nonohnolog SAg genes can also be identified, plots the mean distance of these two groups to either the closest telomeric site or the end of the scaffold, indicating a significantly closer proximity of the nonohnologous SAg genes to telomeres. It therefore seems tempting to speculate that gene duplication and gene position are important factors in evolution of distinct classes of SAg genes: subtelomeric and randomly distributed. Our data indicate that the two classes of SAg genes (subtelomeric and intrachromosomal) derive from different gene duplication mechanisms.\n\nPositive selection pressure acts on N- and C-terminal protein areas.\n\nAny further interpretation of the two factors of gene duplication mechanism and subtelomeric localization in the context of serotype evolution remains speculative without gene expression data for isoforms and ohnologs, which would allow characterization of the telomere position effect on individual gene classes. To get a first indication of whether the individual isoforms are under selective pressure for codon optimization similar to that of highly expressed genes, we compared the codon adaptation index (CAI) using the highly expressed actin gene family to calculate the relative codon usage table. shows the CAI (calculated in reference to the highly expressed actin gene family) for the whole genome and the alpha SAg genes (encoding classical antigens) as well as the remaining antigens and isogene families. The significantly higher CAI of all SAg genes in comparison to the whole genome indicates their adaptation for high expression levels. also shows that the classical SAg genes (alpha genes and their isogenes) have a higher CAI than the entire SAg family. This would indeed indicate that the classical SAg genes and their isogenes differ from the others not only in subtelomeric localization but also in adaptation to high expression levels because of different expression behavior. In terms of the isogenes, it is not clear whether the elevated CAI is due to a short time distance to duplication or to a similar expression pattern to the alpha SAg genes.\n\nUntil now, the comparison of the available sequence data of different alleles of the same gene as well as alignments of different serotype proteins has indicated conservative N-terminal and C-terminal areas of the proteins, while variable areas can be identified in the central region (reviewed in reference 4). The variable central regions were moreover assumed to contain the immunological relevant information; thus, the distribution of synonymous mutations in N- and C-terminal areas and the accumulation of nonsynonymous mutations in the central areas are in agreement with a diversification of immunological information (24). This can also be seen in the comparison of the 29A and 51G genes, which shows variable areas in the center region (alignment in ) and relatively low nonsynonymous mutations in the marginal regions ( ). In general, this distribution can be observed for all other comparisons of genes with other SAg genes or their individual isoforms. Of course, the degree of similarity and, as a prerequisite, the general level of substitutions vary, but a maximum dN/dS ratio exists in the central region for any analyzed gene pair ( ), suggesting that selection pressure acts on the marginal areas, which would subsequently indicate that isogenes are or were expressed to allow for selection pressure.\n\nIntrachromosomal gene duplicates can be cotranscribed.\n\nSeveral independent studies reported the exclusive presence of a single SAg mRNA species in the P. tetraurelia surface antigen system (reviewed in reference 4). Classical Northern blot analysis using long double-stranded probes ( , however, cannot discriminate between different isoforms. We therefore analyzed pure cultures of different serotypes for expression of isogenes using real-time PCR with primers designed to distinguish between isoforms. As shown in , serotype 51A shows expression of a single antigen gene, 51A. The pattern of serotype 51B is different: in addition to strong expression of the 51Bα gene, the 51Bβ gene shows transcription, but the isoforms 51Bδ and 51Bε do not; also, activation of the 51Dγ-2 gene can be observed (these cultures had a few contaminating 51A cells, explaining the slightly higher level of this gene). In serotype 51D, an upregulation of the 51Dα gene as well as both gamma genes can be observed; however, the 51J gene, which shows a much higher similarity to 51D than the gamma genes, does not show activation, indicating that cotranscription cannot be due solely to homology. Also, in serotype 51H, the beta isoform shows a slight upregulation together with strong activation of the 51Hα gene. The 51H cultures were only 95% pure and had ~5% contaminating 51B cells; this can also be seen in the elevated values of the 51Bα and the 51Bβ genes.\n\nThese data indicate that isoforms of surface antigens can be cotranscribed with their respective alpha gene, although they never reach the same transcription level. This can be observed for serotypes 51B, 51D, and 51H, where the 51Bβ, 51Dγ-1, 51Dγ-2, and 51Hβ genes show also transcriptional activation. The fact that 51Dγ-1 as well as 51Bδ and 51Dε shows no or less transcriptional activation might indicate that this cotranscription occurs in a homology-dependent manner, as these genes are those with the lowest similarity to the alpha genes within the individual isogene families.\n\nConsidering a homology-dependent coactivation of isoforms, the comparison with other SAg genes shows that this homology-dependent activation and cotranscription occur only on isoforms located on the same chromosome (arrows in the graphs of indicate genes located in the same macronuclear scaffold). This cotranscription does not occur if highly similar genes are located on different chromosomes: for instance, the 51J gene, which shows the highest similarity to the 51Dα gene, is not activated in serotype 51D cultures, and the 51G gene does not show any cotranscription with the 51A gene.\n\nInterestingly, the phylogenetic relationship of the gene pairs 51A/51G and 51D/51J is closer than that of other isoforms: the difference that distinguishes them from other isoforms and integrates them in the mutually exclusive mechanism is apparently their location on a different chromosome.\n\nSubtelomeric gene position is a prerequisite for RNAi-controlled mutually exclusive transcription.\n\nWe previously reported that mutually exclusive expression of SAg genes in Paramecium is controlled by an RNAi pathway. A divergent RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Rdr3) was shown to be involved in antigenic variation, because silencing of Rdr3 resulted in a phenotype of coexpression of different antigen genes. Some of them (51A, 51B, 51D, and 51H) could be identified by immunological methods, and it was also shown by single-cell immunofluorescence that these proteins are indeed present on the surfaces of individual cells (26). With the new knowledge about the genetic properties of the entire SAg family, it was now possible to characterize the Rdr3 knockdown phenotype of all SAg genes. To determine which of the genes identified here is controlled by this RNAi pathway, we analyzed wild-type-expressing (serotype 51A) cultures and Rdr3 knockdown cultures by cDNA microarrays. The following analysis combines the expression data from the microarray with the chromosomal localization of genes and distinguishes between the distance of genes to the closest telomeric site (thus including the data on chromosome heterogeneity) and the distance to the end of scaffolds (thus ignoring chromosome heterogeneity), as illustrated in .\n\nshows the intensity of SAg genes in wild-type cultures in reference to the ends of scaffolds, and shows the intensity in reference to the closest telomeric region. Both figures show one dominantly expressed SAg (51/29 A) and only four other genes (SAg 5, 3, 56, and 2) with intensities above background; however, the values were ~5 times lower than that of the activated 51A gene. SAg 3 is divergent from all other SAgs in the phylogenetic analysis; SAg 5 and 56 are ohnologs from last WGD, and SAg 2 shows an ohnolog of the intermediate WGD. All other genes do not show signals above threshold. Therefore, we conclude that the majority of newly identified SAg genes (ohnologs and nonohnologs) are not expressed during vegetative growth.\n\nshow the situation in Rdr3 knockdown cultures in reference to the wild type (the fold change relative to wild-type levels is shown in ). Again, shows the genes in reference to the end of scaffolds, and shows them in reference to the closest telomere. Both figures do not show a general coexpression of all genes but show only 14 genes above background level. As shows upregulated genes with no clear pattern, this can be identified in , which includes the information on chromosome heterogeneity, indicating that only genes with a short distance to telomeric repeats are upregulated in Rdr3 knockdown cells. Within this group of genes, the maximum distance to a predicted telomeric site is ~20 kb. Note that the 51A gene was also still highly expressed in these cultures but did not show any differential change in the microarray. shows the upregulated genes with decreasing levels: these are mostly represented by classical surface antigens and isoforms and two nonannotated genes, SAg 27 and SAg 32.\n\nHowever, silencing of SAg genes apparently involves two distinct mechanisms, as Rdr3-mediated silencing occurs exclusively in subtelomeric regions. SAg activation induced by Rdr3 knockdown also occurs only at subtelomeric loci. This is the first demonstration of RNAi-mediated subtelomeric silencing; this phenomenon is restricted to the surface antigens, as we do not see a general activation of subtelomeric genes in Rdr3 silencing: shows the remaining non-SAg genes which show significant upregulation in reference to the closest telomeric site. No preference for subtelomeric genes can be identified in .\n\nLinking telomere position effect and homology-dependent silencing.\n\nGene position cannot be the only parameter controlling silencing of mutually exclusive expressed SAg genes, because several SAg genes with close proximity to telomeric repeats are not upregulated during Rdr3 knockdown ( ). Also, we did not see a genome-wide upregulation of subtelomeric genes. As only particular subtelomeric genes are under the control of Rdr3, a general spreading of the heterochromatic state of telomeres cannot be responsible.\n\nHomology dependency of serotype expression was shown in a series of previous studies (reviewed in reference 19). As serotype expression requires a genetic cross talk between silent and active genes, the knowledge that RNAi controls serotype expression suggests that the trans-acting factor could be short RNAs. Further support comes from experiments in which the actively transcribed serotype gene is silenced: introduction of siRNAs against the active gene not only knocked down its expression in cis but also activated formerly silent SAg genes in trans (41). Although their function is still not clear, endogenous small RNAs of silent as well as active SAg genes can be demonstrated in Northern blots, thus indicating that a complex genetic cross talk is involved in serotype regulation (our unpublished observations). We extended the analysis to predict possible trans-acting siRNAs from the sequence data. shows a heat map of possible 20-nucleotide (nt) siRNAs, indicating a high degree of identity between individual SAg genes, which becomes apparent by the high numbers of potential trans-acting siRNAs. This length was chosen because ~20-nt siRNAs were observed in Northern blots probed with SAg-specific probes. For the heat map, we used the order of genes resulting from the phylogenetic analysis in . The heat map indicates two large clusters of potential trans-acting siRNA producing genes, one consisting of the 51A-51B-51G group and one consisting of the 51D-51J group. The latter also shows a large amount of potential siRNAs specific to both 51H genes and the 51C gene (arrows), although these are clearly separated in the phylogenetic tree ( ).\n\nWe combined siRNA analysis with the expression data, and the Rdr3-controlled SAg genes are indicated in by green boxes. Their pattern is in keeping with the above-mentioned clusters of potential trans-acting siRNA-producing genes, as Rdr3 knockdown-mediated SAg activation occurs exclusively at loci which share trans-acting siRNAs with others. Exceptions are SAg 41 in the first cluster and SAg 53 and 51Dγ-1 in the second large cluster ( ; red boxes). In agreement with our conclusion that subtelomeric gene position is a prerequisite for the underlying expression mechanism, both genes show the individual largest distance to telomeric repeats inside the cluster (SAg 41, ~42 kb; SAg 53, ~148 kb; 51Dγ-1, ~12.5 kb). The only upregulated gene for which does not give a satisfying explanation is SAg 32, because it does not show possible trans-acting siRNAs specific to any cluster.\n\nThe theoretical calculation of potential trans-acting siRNAs provides a potential explanation as to why these SAg genes in particular are controlled by the Rdr3-related RNAi mechanism and supports the hypothesis that trans-acting siRNAs are involved in serotype regulation, because the Rdr3-regulated SAg genes require subtelomeric localization and trans-acting siRNAs. In agreement with our hypothesis, all other SAg genes, even the subset of genes which also show close proximity to telomeric repeats (SAg genes 24, 89, 57, 99, 40, and 101) ( ; yellow boxes), show only a limited overlap with other SAg genes ( ) and do not show significant upregulation. In conclusion, our data indicate that Rdr3-mediated silencing occurs only in subtelomeric genes which share trans-acting siRNAs with other subtelomeric genes.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe SAg multigene family.\n\nIn order to understand the mechanisms of mutually exclusive expression of different SAg genes in P. tetraurelia, it was necessary to characterize all the SAg genes present in the genome. Sixty-five SAgs had the characteristic cysteine periodicity and included 8 classical serotype genes (alphas) and 6 isogenes. However, 8 potential SAgs did not possess a GPI anchor and instead had transmembrane domains. It is not known what the function of these genes is, but as five of them do not show an ER-TLS, their function may be intracellular. Sixty-four SAg genes seemed to have structures compatible with expression (i.e., they were probably not pseudogenes). The codon usage with high CAI values was suggestive of highly expressed genes. Although most SAg genes are silent at some time, this is also consistent with the alpha SAg genes and their isoforms; however, those in particular have a codon bias which seems optimized for high-level expression. In fact, this correlates with our finding that only those genes can be activated during Rdr3 silencing as well as in serotype pure wild-type cultures, and it also agrees with reports that serotype proteins contribute to ~3.5% of the total cellular proteins (42). With respect to the large open reading frames (ORFs), an efficient optimization of transcription and translation is indeed required to ensure high-level protein expression. SAgs are high-molecular-weight proteins encoded by very long genes. Introns are definitely underrepresented, which may be due to optimization of transcription, although the tiny introns of Paramecium, which have a size between 20 and 34 nt (43), would not create such a drastic increase in transcript size.\n\nIn some cases, in addition to the major alpha gene, there are neighboring isogenes in the chromosome, and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) experiments ( ) showed that some of these were also transcribed. An attractive explanation for intrachromosomal coexpression in wild-type cells comes from studies in Plasmodium indicating a nuclear organization which allows the subnuclear translocation of loci into euchromatic regions, which allow transcriptional activity (44). A similar locus repositioning in Paramecium macronuclei might explain cotranscription of close loci (isogenes) on the same macronuclear chromosomes, whereas other loci showing a comparable degree of identity and/or trans-acting siRNAs which are located on different chromosomes are not coactivated. In support of this hypothesis, in situ localization of SAg transcripts indicated local transcription spots in the macronucleus (45).\n\nA telomere position effect controls RNAi-dependent gene regulation.\n\nAlthough, in Paramecium, only one serotype is usually expressed, knockdown of Rdr3 results in expression of a mixture of SAgs (26). In this paper, we show that only SAg genes with a subtelomeric location show this Rdr3-dependent silencing ( ).\n\nOne possibility to explain subtelomeric position of the genes is the involvement of the telomeric heterochromatin state in the expression mechanism. Telomeric and subtelomeric chromatin is usually heterochromatic. It is likely that Rdr3-associated siRNAs are involved in transcriptional silencing in Paramecium (26), and the coding region has been shown to control transcriptional activity of SAg genes (46). A precise understanding of the mechanisms involved will require characterization of the siRNAs present during the mutually exclusive expression of SAg genes as well as the changes occurring during phenotypic variation. However, shows that there is a relationship between mutually exclusive expression and the occurrence of potential trans-acting siRNAs, thus suggesting that such siRNAs are involved in the genetic cross talk enabling mutually exclusive expression. The details of siRNA source and targets need to be characterized at the molecular level to get an impression of the RNA-mediated networks occurring in the nucleus.\n\nIn general, endogenous trans-acting siRNAs have great importance for the regulation of endogenous gene expression, as they allow genetic cross talk and therefore flexible adaptation of a single gene as well as alterations in gene expression patterns. Position effects in correlation with trans-acting mechanisms have been reported for Schizosaccharomyces pombe, where silencing depends on the position of the target gene: trans-silencing works efficient only in loci close to heterochromatic regions, such as centromeres (47). A different gene position effect was shown in Drosophila: transgenes inserted in subtelomeric regions repress expression of homologous genes in euchromatin, and this trans-silencing has also been shown to depend on components of the piRNA (piwi-interacting RNA) pathway, which is a germline-specific RNAi mechanism, and on heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1); interestingly, epigenetic inheritance has also been shown, and increasing data indicate cytoplasmically transmitted piRNAs responsible for maternal inheritance (48, 49). Although the two examples cannot be directly compared to each other, increasing evidence shows gene position effects as prerequisites for efficient trans-silencing; our example of SAg regulation in Paramecium would be one of the first examples in regulation of endogenous gene expression. Reports that these trans-silencing phenomena also allow epigenetic inheritance, as has also been reported for the Paramecium serotype system (10, 28), could give rise to speculations that the telomere position effect may also be necessary for stable inheritance of gene expression patterns.\n\nDiversification of serotypes by gene duplication and chromosome fragmentation.\n\nEpigenetic control of antigenic variation represents an exciting example combining Darwinian evolution of surface antigen genes as a kind of long-term adaptation with the capability for rapid phenotype alterations by epigenetic control of a variety of these genes and ciliate genetics and epigenetics heavily contributes to a better understanding of these rarely understood control mechanisms (10). Across kingdoms, phenotypic evolution was described as resulting from the creation of new genes, predominantly originating from duplication events (50). The example of variant surface antigens has another aspect: as the creation of a new functional surface antigen also requires consideration of the gene expression mechanism (to include the newly evolved gene into the genetic network of telomeric trans silencing), translocation of the gene copy into a subtelomeric region is required.\n\nOur analysis of the SAg family in Paramecium indicates its evolution by two different events of gene duplication: a subset of intrachromosomal genes show ohnologs from the Paramecium intermediate and recent WGD, and another subset of subtelomeric genes show intrachromosomal gene duplicates which need to result from a different mechanism. Strikingly, the latter subset of genes show (i) mutually exclusive transcription, (ii) intrachromosomal duplicates, and (iii) no ohnologs. As 68% of all genes in P. tetraurelia still have their ohnologs from the last WGD, we see only 25 ohnologs in the SAg family, which has 65 genes.\n\nWhy do the subtelomeric SAg genes not have ohnologs? They might be eliminated soon after the WGD event, or subtelomeric SAg genes might have appeared after the last WGD. Both possibilities may also occur together. A preferential deletion of subtelomeric SAg ohnologs might be selected due to problems in the mechanism for mutually exclusive expression. Our data indicate that closely related SAg genes on different chromosomes are usually mutually exclusively expressed, e.g., 51A-51G or 51D-51J, by the above-discussed trans-acting siRNAs. Previous studies showed allelic exclusion in cells which are heterozygous for SAg loci, meaning that one of the two alleles became inactivated: also, several crosses and backcrosses led to the hypothesis that this silencing was due to an “allelic interaction” (51). Allelic exclusion of very similar subtelomeric alleles or trans silencing of duplicates might explain a low retention rate of subtelomeric SAg ohnologs.\n\nNevertheless, our data suggest gene duplication events after the last WGD contributing to SAg diversity. The phylogenetic analysis indicates a closer relationship between intrachromosomal duplicates than ohnologs, indicating that intrachromosomal isoforms are younger than the last WGD, which is in agreement with the absence of ohnologs. As they show cotranscription at a certain level with the individual alpha gene, this might explain the still existing selection pressure on (i) cysteine periodicity and (ii) N- and C-terminal areas. As a consequence of cotranscription, the minor abundance of isoforms together with the alpha serotype protein might allow diversification of the central and variable area of the proteins with parallel positive selection of tertiary structure.\n\nThe finding of intrachromosomal gene duplicates on macronuclear chromosomes raises the question of their origin. As one would expect from highly expressed intronless genes, retroposition might meet several criteria of these isogenes, e.g., lack of introns and high conservation of coding sequences (CDS) but not of regulatory up- and downstream regions. However, retroposition can be excluded, as all isogenes are also present in the micronuclear genome and all of them contain IES elements, which themselves show a high degree of similarity (data not shown). In ciliates, the germline chromosomes are interrupted by noncoding internal-elimination elements (IESs) which are present in coding and noncoding regions: their precise elimination during assembly of the new somatic macronucleus is crucial for building intact genes (52). The data of a recent sequencing of Paramecium IESs (53) also show IESs in the isogenes which show great homology to the IESs of the individual alpha gene, thus indicating that duplication occurs on micronuclear chromosomes.\n\nWhat might be the biological significance of these intrachromosomal duplicates? Mutually exclusive transcription requires subtelomeric localizations; therefore, the evolution from intrachromsomal SAg isoforms into a new SAg would require gene repositioning. The observed gene position effects in context with macronuclear heterogeneity let us hypothesize that serotype evolution in ciliates involves a very elegant solution, as the heterogeneity of macronuclear chromosomes allows them to “move the telomere” instead of the gene. The appearance of the telomeric sites close to the SAg isoforms suggests that alterations of macronuclear chromosome heterogeneity by the creation/activation of new telomere addition sites on micronuclear chromosomes may be a mechanism to advance a SAg isoform to a new serotype gene by moving the gene into a subtelomeric region (see the model in ). As mentioned above, previous studies showed that imprecise elimination of repeated sequences (transposable elements or minisatellites) from micronuclear chromosomes leads to macronuclear chromosome polymorphisms: after deletion, the ends may be stabilized by telomere addition or religated (54, 55). These imprecise deletions are epigenetically controlled: they can be experimentally induced by prezygotic silencing (56), and a non-Mendelian mutant was described which still contains the 51A gene in the micronucleus but removes this locus during macronuclear development, showing an alternative telomere addition site upstream of the 51A gene (39). Although the detailed mechanisms remain to be clarified, these findings indicate that epigenetic mechanisms can contribute to the creation of macronuclear heterogeneity, which could move internal SAg duplicates into subtelomeric regions.\n\nAs gene conversion was shown to be involved in the creation of new variant antigen genes in many organisms, such as Trypanosoma spp. (57), cells may benefit from the intrachromosomal duplicates in different ways, because they offer a pool of new immunological information: as studies indicate the frequency of gene conversion to be inversely proportional to physical distance (58), this may be a mechanism to introduce new immunological data into the existing subtelomeric SAg."
