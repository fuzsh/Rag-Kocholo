She is the editor of artist-run 284 Publishing, which specializes in visual art, post- and non-human theory. Since 2016, she has been investigating how human relations to plants are colored by anthropomorphic projections. In areas of friction with plants, they tend to be described as animals (plant pets or plant monsters). This is the case for the two plants she has focused on, the fresh water algae Aegagrophila linnaei (or Marimo) and Fallopia japonica (Japanese Knotweed or Itadori). Her research combines theoretical writing, photography, and performance. She is currently part of a transdisciplinary group that explores the world of the Vampire Squid (based on Vilém Flusser´s scientific fable “Vampyrotheutes Infernalis”), which will collaborate to produce a theater play, visual art, and performances.

His research areas are environmental literary history and Renaissance literature. He published Wooden Os: Shakespeare’s Theatres and England’s Trees (University of Toronto Press 2013; paperback 2018). Forthcoming publications include a collection of essays, co-edited with Tiffany Jo Werth for the University of Toronto Press, about how contemporary environmental matters have shaped the ways that scholars of Middle English and Renaissance literatures conduct their research and teach courses; and, with Robert W. Barrett, Jr., a special issue of the journal postmedieval called “Premodern Plants.” His current book-length project, “Marvellous Vegetables in Renaissance Poetry,” explores wondrous representations of plant life in Renaissance poetry, especially (though not exclusively) in the verse of the seventeenth-century English poet Andrew Marvell. Here, vegetable is an umbrella term for all forms of plant life, but the book’s more specific objects of study are leeks, laurel trees, tulips, mandrakes, potatoes, and tobacco. Something of a poetic natural history, “Marvellous Vegetables” leverages seventeenth-century vegetable figures to articulate fundamentally new questions about the surprising array of vegetable capacities, deprivations, desires, essences, histories, and materialities that shaped ideas about humanness in Renaissance poetry and the visual arts. He is also a founding member of the research collective called “Oecologies: Inhabiting Premodern Worlds.” You can contact him at nardizzi@mail.ubc.ca.\n\nSolvejg Nitzke is interim professor for comparative literature at Ruhr-Universität Bochum.

She has studied and taught in Bochum, Charlottesville, Vienna and at TU Dresden and published on catastrophes, myth, the whole earth, detective & science fiction, climate, forests, idylls, monster plants and literary and cultural theories of human-nature relationships. Her research follows the questions of how knowledge is produced under precarious circumstances, what role narrative plays in dis/connecting humans and nonhumans, and how material consequences of stories (and vice versa) might be conceptualized. She makes a point of taking research out of the University and talks about trees and texts wherever she gets the chance. Her portrait of ferns (in German) will be published with Matthes & Seitz in October 2024.
