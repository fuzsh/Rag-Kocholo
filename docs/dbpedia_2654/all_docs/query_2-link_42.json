        "text": "Meow Meow’s unique brand of subversive and sublime entertainment has hypnotized, inspired, and terrified audiences globally from London’s West End to Lincoln Center, Berlin to Shanghai, the Hollywood Bowl to the Sydney Opera House. Named one of the “Top Performers of the Year” by The New Yorker, the crowd-surfing tragi-comedienne’s solo works have been commissioned by David Bowie, Pina Bausch, and Mikhail Baryshnikov, among others.\n\nMeow Meow specializes in Weimar repertoire and French chanson, as well as jump-cut explorations of Schubert, Schumann, and contemporary composers. She has played Jenny in Weill’s The Threepenny Opera with the London Philharmonic Orchestra, Anna in Weill’s Seven Deadly Sins with Berlin’s United Ensemble, and performed Andriessen’s de Materie with the LA Philharmonic. She has performed her Pandemonium concerts in the US with the San Francisco, Seattle, and Oregon Symphonies; and internationally with the Sydney Symphony, Melbourne Symphony, and Bergen Philharmonic. She has toured with the Australian Chamber Orchestra performing Barry Humphries’ Weimar program at Tanglewood, the Barbican, and at concert halls across the UK and Australia\n\nThe 2023-24 season includes debuts with the Toronto and Vancouver Symphonies; a concert tour across the US; and a collaboration with the Royal Ballet's Edward Watson and choreographer Arthur Pita. Recent seasons have included concerts at the Kennedy Center, Die Sieben Todsünden, and Façade conducted by Vladimir Jurowski at the Berlin Konzerthaus.\n\nMeow Meow’s theater credits include Titania in A Midsummer Night’s Dream at Shakespeare’s Globe in London, Miss Adelaide in Guys and Dolls at Royal Albert Hall, La Maîtresse in The Umbrellas of Cherbourg on London's West End, and Pegleg in Tom Waits’ The Black Rider. She is a guest artist with Pina Bausch Tanztheater Wuppertal.\n\nMeow Meow’s original music theater work Apocalypse Meow was performed at BAM’s Next Wave Festival in 2019, having premiered at London’s Southbank Centre. She has created numerous “fantastical history” song cycles for crumbling theatres in Australia and the UK, and bespoke civic events – most recently in Liverpool involving the city’s brass bands and a requiem in a graveyard.\n\nHer latest album, Hotel Amour with Pink Martini’s Thomas Lauderdale was named one of the top 100 albums of the year by The Times (UK) and features duets with Rufus Wainwright, Michel Legrand, and the von Trapps. She is a frequent guest artist with Pink Martini performing at the Berlin Philharmonie, Royal Albert Hall, Opéra Garnier Monte-Carlo, the Hollywood Bowl, and across Europe and North America.\n\n2023/24"
