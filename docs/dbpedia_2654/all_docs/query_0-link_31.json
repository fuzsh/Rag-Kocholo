Arminius was understood to be the famous writer, Junius a rather obscure professor of theology in Leiden. When the epistolary conference took place, however, Arminius was a little-known minister in Amsterdam, and Junius was one of the most highly regarded Reformed theologians in Europe. Junius was renowned for his labors as an exegete and translator of the New Testament and for a series of major treatises, the most influential of which, De theologia vera (True Theology), is here for the first time translated into English. Had Junius written nothing else, True Theology would have assured his place in the minds of his contemporaries. It provided several generations of Protestant theologians with the first fully developed prolegomena to theology and, in it, a paradigm for understanding the nature of human theology, based on revelation and formulated in the context of human sinfulness. Junius’s approach was not only much admired but also much borrowed, sometimes verbatim, by numerous of his contemporaries.\n\nThe present volume is a significant effort on several counts. It presents an invaluable and highly influential work to contemporary students of Reformed thought. It offers the first English translation of Junius’s autobiography, a work published posthumously in the seventeenth-century edition of Junius’s complete works. It also offers, by way of the introduction, a perspective on the treatise and on Junius’s life and work in the context of the rise of Reformed scholasticism and orthodoxy.\n\nDavid Noe’s translations represent significant efforts both in carefully rendering the complexities of late Renaissance classicism, as found primarily in the autobiography, and in finely presenting the grammatically simpler but intellectually more complex scholastic Latin of the treatise. Willem van Asselt’s introduction offers a view of Junius’s work in the light both of his researches into the era and of much current scholarship, of which he was a master. It is with sadness that we note the passing of Professor van Asselt, a superb scholar and good friend, who completed the introduction not long before his untimely death. The man and his work will be long remembered.\n\nRichard A. Muller\n\nSenior Fellow, Junius Institute\n\nCalvin Theological Seminary\n\nAugust 2014\n\nIntroduction\n\nWillem J. van Asselt\n\nAlthough the importance of Franciscus Junius (1545–1602) for the history of Protestant theology is increasingly valued by contemporary historians of theology, most of his impressive oeuvre is unavailable to the English-speaking reader. This English translation of one of his most influential works, A Treatise on True Theology (1594), accompanied by a translation of his autobiography, will certainly help to rectify this deficit.\n\nIn this introduction I attempt to sketch the important role Junius played in helping shape the Reformed tradition and illustrate the significance of his True Theology for the development of Reformed dogmatics. To do so, I offer a brief biographical sketch of Junius, followed by a description and analysis of the context, genre, purpose, and main arguments of his True Theology. In a final section I focus on the reception and appropriation of this work by his successors. It will become evident that Junius’s investigations into the nature of theology rapidly became standard fare in post-Reformation Protestant theology (both Lutheran and Reformed), thus setting a pattern for theological studies for generations to come. Moreover, its theological and ecclesial settings reveal that True Theology should be read within the context of his entire oeuvre. This further means this work must be read against the backdrop of confessionalization, a period in which the religious scene in Europe grew increasingly polarized. In this respect Junius’s oeuvre, including his treatise on the nature of true theology, can be best characterized as one of the first attempts to resolve the ecclesial and theological disputes plaguing Protestant Christendom in Europe through serious dialogue.\n\nBrief Biographical Sketch\n\nThe first source for our knowledge of the life of Franciscus Junius (or François du Jon) is his autobiography, which contains the deeply moving story of his adventurous life until 1593, the year he arrived at Leiden. With Junius’s permission, this autobiography was published in 1595 by Petrus Merula. Born at Bourges on May 1, 1545, Junius was one of nine children of a local nobleman. He studied law at Bourges and Lyon and theology at Geneva during Calvin’s final years (1562–1565). In 1565 Junius accepted a call to be the pastor of the Walloon congregation of Antwerp. Here he was associated with Marnix of St. Aldegonde in a committee to spread political and religious literature; for this activity the authorities put a price of three hundred guilders on his head. Junius escaped capture, fleeing to Breda only a half hour before his house was raided. For the next few years he was forced to move to Ghent (1566), and, after a short stay there, he fled to Germany, where he was appointed minister of the church of Reformed refugees at Schönau by the elector Frederick III. He left Schönau for Heidelberg when the elector commissioned him and Immanuel Tremellius, a Jew converted to the Reformed religion, to write a new Latin translation of the Hebrew Old Testament, first published in Frankfurt in 1579. The Sacra Biblia of Tremellius and Junius gained tremendous influence, and its exegetical annotations were highly valued. Published together with Beza’s Latin translation of the Greek New Testament, it was reprinted well into the seventeenth and even the eighteenth century.\n\nDue to the restoration of Lutheranism at Heidelberg in 1576 by Frederick’s son Louis IV, Junius was forced to go to Neustadt an der Haardt, where he became professor of Hebrew at the Casimirianum, a theological school founded by John Casimir. Casimir was also a son of Frederick III, but he remained loyal to the Reformed religion. During his stay at Neustadt, Junius taught alongside Zacharias Ursinus, the author of the Heidelberg Catechism, and even delivered Ursinus’s funeral oration when he died in 1583. After the reintroduction of Reformed religion in the Palatinate, Junius returned to Heidelberg and in 1584 became a professor of theology there.\n\nIn 1591 the French king, Henry IV, asked Junius to come to Paris to be his advisor in Protestant affairs. On his trip to France he visited Leiden where, in 1592, he accepted an appointment as professor of theology. In 1594 Franciscus Gomarus arrived at Leiden to be his colleague and stayed there until 1611. Junius declined invitations to be a minister at La Rochelle and professor in the new university of Franeker. In 1598 the Company of Pastors at Geneva invited Junius to come to assist the Dutch students there. Junius refused, however, perhaps due to increasing ecclesiological differences with Beza after his publication of the Eirenicum.\n\nOn October 23, 1602, at the age of fifty-seven, Junius died, a victim of the Black Death. Gomarus conducted the funeral oration, which was published in 1602 at Leiden under the title Oratio in obitum F. Junii. Throughout his life Junius married four times. His two most well-known children were from his second and third marriages: his daughter Elisabeth, who married the famous humanist scholar Gerardus Johannes Vossius (1577–1649); and his son Franciscus Junius (the younger) (1589–1677), who was the first Reformed minister with Remonstrant sympathies at Hillegersberg.\n\nJunius as Scholar\n\nOne can easily conclude from Junius’s biography that the dark events surrounding the Reformation history of Germany and Flanders profoundly and emotionally affected him until the end of his life. This memory, together with other dramatic events of his Huguenot and family history, colored his identity and personality. As an academic, Junius can be categorized as a scholar who worked in the tradition of advanced humanist scholarship and Protestant theology. In early modern Protestant thought, and especially during the beginning period of confessionalization in which the religious scene in Europe grew more and more polarized, Junius was one of the foremost and creative voices addressing themes and challenging questions of his day throughout his writings. This is evident in that soon after his death in 1602 most of his writings were published as a collected work (his Opera Theologica), which saw three editions: Geneva (1607), Heidelberg (1608), and again Geneva (1613).\n\nBrowsing through the two tomes of his Opera Theologica (comprising more than five thousand pages), one is impressed by the great diversity of subjects. This impression was shared by the nineteenth-century theologian Abraham Kuyper, who in 1882 published an edition of selected works of Junius. In the preface, Kuyper pointed to the international reputation of Junius, stating, “Junius taught everywhere, in France, Switzerland, Germany, and in the Netherlands (apud nostrates).” According to Kuyper, Junius was a preeminent teacher and scholar as well as a strong defender of Augustine’s and Calvin’s teachings.\n\nJunius was a prolific and versatile author. Besides several commentaries on the Pentateuch, the Old Testament prophets Ezekiel and Daniel, and a commentary on Revelation, he wrote on Hebrew grammar, exegesis, dogmatics, and ecclesiastical and natural law as well as other political issues that seemed to influence thinkers such as Hugo Grotius. Junius’s polemical writings include works against the Controversiae of the Jesuit Robert Bellarmine, consisting of seven Animadversiones in which he discussed (among other things) Bellarmine’s views on Holy Scripture and the authority of church councils and the pope. Most of these were published during the last years of his life. He also wrote against the Polish Socinians Christophorus Ostorodt and Andreas Voidovius, who arrived at Leiden in 1598 determined to study there. While Junius cordially received them, he refused to discuss their views as he thought them to be dangerous and heretical. In part owing to his instigation, Ostorodt and Voidovius were later forced to leave the Netherlands.\n\nJunius also wrote noteworthy pieces on federal theology. In 1585 he began his academic career in Heidelberg with two orations on federal theology, and just before his death in 1602 he addressed the same subject in chapters 25 and 26 of his Leiden Theological Theses (respectively entitled De foederibus et testamentis divinis and De veteri et novo Dei foedere); in these writings he offered an extensive examination of federal terminology and salvation in its historical setting. Although Junius did not develop a full-blown federal system within these pieces, he did mention the divine covenants with Adam, Noah, Abraham, Israel, and the church and further argued that God’s revelation in various times and periods took place in the context of a covenant. This covenant of God is a gracious “disposition of God and offers the only way of salvation without which no one can or will ever attain grace with God.” But Junius did not confine his understanding of covenant to its theological and ecclesiastical dimensions. It was especially the Noahic covenant that he used in political and juridical areas, proposing a civil or state covenant (foedus civile) on which the political commonwealth had to be based. This suggests Junius’s possible impact on the federal political philosophy of Johannes Althusius (ca. 1557–1638), the Herborn school of federalism, and even the federal theology of Johannes Cocceius (1603–1669).\n\nAs a respected Reformed orthodox theologian, Junius provided leadership under which the Leiden theological faculty could thrive. Together with Gomarus and Lucas Trelcatius Sr. (1542–1602), Junius made an important contribution to the development of the theological faculty of Leiden University, where he finished out his career. Remarkably, the humanist scholar and philologist Joseph Justus Scaliger (1540–1609) was of another opinion, calling Junius an ingenium desultorium (a superficial mind). In his letters to colleagues, Scaliger wrote rude and insulting things about the Leiden theology professor, even jotting down invective marginal notes such as “ape” (simia) and “donkey” (asinus) while studying Junius’s philological works. Scaliger, who was a rather conceited and narrow-minded person, thought little of Junius’s philological scholarship perhaps because he envied Junius’s position as professor primarius at Leiden University. Scaliger’s dislike of Junius may also have been the result of the latter daring to contest Scaliger’s views of biblical chronology.\n\nAccording to most of his colleagues, however, Junius’s scholarship was greatly valued; the renowned humanist scholar Gerardus Johannes Vossius (1577–1649) defended Junius, his father-in-law, against Scaliger’s negative comments, as did Hugo Grotius and Franciscus Gomarus, who both studied at Leiden University under the tutelage of Junius. Christiaan Sepp rightly observes that Scaliger appears to have retracted his insults in the memorial poem he wrote after the death of Junius:\n\nFor you a wailing school her master mourns,\n\nAn orphan church weeps for you her father,\n\nAnd for her doctor groans the whole wide world.\n\nMention should also be made of Junius’s long-standing correspondence with the humanist scholar Justus Lipsius (1547–1606), a prominent representative of the Stoa-reception (Tacitus) in the second half of the sixteenth century. This exchange of letters clearly shows that Junius fully participated in the Republic of Letters (respublica literaria) in Europe during his professorship at Leiden. It was a stimulating factor for the development of his own ideas on social and political issues.\n\nIt is also important to comment on Junius’s relationship with Jacobus Arminius, who became professor at Leiden University in 1603. Junius carried on a correspondence with Arminius after meeting him at Leiden in 1596 at the wedding of Geertje Jacobsdochter (Arminius’s aunt) and Johannes Cuchlinus, who had been regent of the Saten­college since 1592. During the wedding celebration, Arminius and Junius discussed the doctrine of predestination and agreed to exchange letters on the subject. They promised to keep the correspondence confidential lest it cause trouble in the church. In this correspondence Arminius complained that Junius’s position on predestination required the existence of sin for the execution of the decree of election. Junius responded to this complaint with twenty-eight propositions in which he refuted Arminius and defended his own view. Although he did not defend full supralapsarianism like Beza, Junius emphatically denied that his views made God the author of sin. When this correspondence was publicized by one of Junius’s students, Arminius continued the debate, but Junius refused any further discussion. In 1613 the correspondence between Arminius and Junius was posthumously published under the title Amica Collatio cum Francisco Junio. In order to prevent Arminius’s appointment at Leiden, Gomarus—then the senior member of the theological faculty—told the story that on his deathbed Junius had warned him against appointing Arminius as his successor at Leiden University. The curators of the university did not believe the story, however, telling Gomarus that he had no authority to speak on the matter.\n\nIt seems that the relationship between Junius and Arminius was somewhat ambivalent. While they could appreciate each other, theologically they disagreed. Despite the fact that Junius and his family had cordial relationships with the Remonstrants, it cannot be inferred that he shared the opinions of Arminius and later Remonstrants. The words of praise that the Remonstrant historian Geeraert Brandt dedicated to Junius in a Dutch poem show that he was admired for his peaceable disposition even by his theological opponents:\n\nFamous Junius, virtuous pastor, and fourfold nobleman, by origin, intellect, science, and virtue, you are unlike the cruel torture of the Spanish fury.\n\nYour weapons were words, the power of Holy Scripture, the sharp sword of the Spirit, and the shield of endurance.\n\nYou have contended falsehood by truth, hatred by love.\n\nPopish strong-arm tactics must make way for reason’s gentle power.\n\nThree Major Works\n\nJunius’s three most influential writings were his Theological Theses, the Eirenicum, and True Theology. The Theological Theses, composed during his time at Leiden, cover in short, numbered paragraphs the principal topics of theology. Consisting of fifty-seven heads of doctrine, these theses deal with theology, Scripture, tradition, God, predestination, the Trinity, creation, sin, law, gospel, covenant, Christ, faith, the Christian life, the church, sacraments, and the state of the soul after death. At the end of the Leiden theses, the editor of the first volume of Junius’s Opera Theologica added several sets of theological theses that had been disputed under Junius at the University of Heidelberg—fifteen disputations referred to as the Heidelberg Theses. Both sets of theological theses belong to the genre of the disputatio, the most celebrated genre of academic discourse since the middle of the thirteenth century. The academic background to this disputatio genre was the scholastic method. Both in his Heidelberg and Leiden theses Junius fully participated in this tradition, demonstrating an increasing precision in determining the context and content of theological concepts and terms by means of logical analysis.\n\nA second important work published shortly after Junius’s arrival at Leiden was his Eirenicum on the Peace of the Catholic Church among Christians (1593). This work appeared almost simultaneously in both French and Latin editions. The French edition was addressed to the Catholic clergy in France (â Messiers du Clergé, qui sont au Royaume de France). According to Cuno, this French edition must have been published before July 1593, the month of King Henry IV’s conversion to the Roman Catholic Church. As Junius expressed hope that the Gallican Catholic Church in France would free itself from the Holy See in Rome, a dedication of this kind to the French Catholic clergy after July 1593 would have been meaningless. As can be further verified from Junius’s correspondence with H. Smetius, the Eirenicum was indeed published before Henry IV’s transition in March of 1593. The Latin edition was addressed to Maurice, landgrave of Hesse, who was deeply involved in the Lutheran and Reformed disputes in his county.\n\nIn short, the Eirenicum consists of meditations on Psalms 122 and 133 in which Junius warmly urges cultivating a spirit of peace and unity in the churches, especially in Germany and France. For this reason Junius is often considered a representative of the so-called Reformed irenicism. While the religious scene in Europe grew more and more polarized as a result of confessionalization, Junius called for ecclesiastical peace. If resolution could not be immediately reached over theological disputes, Junius called on Christians to at least join forces. His irenic attitude emphasized how much common ground confessional enemies actually shared. He expressed appreciation for this by saying that although no confessions were equal, all were forms of Christianity with a common belief in the same Savior; likewise, those who professed Christ were all Christians. If they as brothers (fratres) would engage in constructive dialogue, abandoning all ambition to rule over one another, he was sure they could one day unite as members of a church that was catholic in the original meaning of the word: a universal church.\n\nIn this respect Junius was one of the first Reformed theologians who hoped that the disputes plaguing European Christendom might be resolved through serious dialogue. In the following decades, eminent scholars of every confession—such as George Cassander (Roman Catholic), George Callixtus (Lutheran), Hugo Grotius (Remonstrant), and David Pareus and John Dury (Reformed)—adopted the same approach.\n\nJunius’s mediation was further sought on the local level. He was frequently asked by church governments and city magistrates to mediate between conflicting religious parties. Thus, for example, the Utrecht magistrate requested him to mediate in a conflict involving one of Utrecht’s parish churches, the Jacobskerk. The conflict was between the Reformed consistory and the followers of the “liberal” pastor Huibert Duifhuis (1531–1581), who rejected any form of ecclesiastical discipline introduced by the local government. Although Junius did not agree with an Erastian model of church government, he counseled against separation of the Jacobi parish because right doctrine was not at stake. At the request of Arminius and Jean Taffin, then ministers of the Walloon church in Amsterdam, Junius also became involved in the English separatist movement of the Brownists in Middelburg and Amsterdam led by Francis Johnson and Henry Ainsworth. In 1598 these English separatists published a confession of faith (Confessio Fidei Anglorum in Belgio exulantium) both to express their theological convictions shared with the Reformed churches but also to enumerate their objections against the Anglican Church. This confession was sent to the universities of Leiden, St. Andrews, Heidelberg, and Geneva, and the authors invited each theological faculty to respond with feedback. Junius felt forced to intervene, and by means of several letters he responded saying that this consensus was not reason for the crafting of a new confession of faith, and their separation was not warranted due to the deviating doctrines they listed. Therefore, the accusations directed against the Anglican Church (and the Amsterdam congregation) were unnecessary. Consequently, Junius argued their separated congregation was unnecessary and even illegitimate. In both cases—Utrecht and Amsterdam—Junius strove to uphold the peace of the churches (pax ecclesiarum) as he had in his Eirenicum.\n\nA Treatise on True Theology: Its Historical Context, Genre, and Purpose\n\nJunius’s most influential Latin work, A Treatise on True Theology, was first published in 1594. Junius dedicated this work to the curators of Leiden University and consuls of the city of Leiden. The full force of this treatise can be correctly determined only when it is considered together with his Eirenicum, published one year earlier. The historical value of True Theology is most evident when it is considered as a demonstration of the connection between humanist scholarship and the Reformed tradition in Junius’s thought. It also demonstrates his attempt to establish a well-defined confessional identity of Reformed theology, one that at the same time was open to points of conversation with representatives of other confessions.\n\nIn this respect True Theology must be placed in the context of the confessional debates of the late sixteenth century. In Junius’s estimation, the primary cause of these confessional conflicts was the imperfect nature of every human being, which indicated that this was not simply the fault of theologians and believers of other confessions but also of those in the Reformed church. What mattered most was not the issue of labeling something as orthodox as opposed to heresy, but the inadequacy of theological thinking. Junius did not expect a complete consensus in theology, for no theologian can claim that he has fully understood and grasped theology in an absolute sense (theologia absoluta). In this life theological knowledge remains imperfect pilgrim theology (theologia viatorum). Junius thus expected humility of his colleagues, urging them to be aware of their own imperfections and limitations when doing theology. Echoing his Eirenicum, in the last chapter of True Theology Junius outlines the two main concerns of this work: “The goal set before us in this life is the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God. We all must strive together for this unity in the communion of the saints and stretch every muscle, to the utmost of our ability, to lay hold of the fruit of that unity.”\n\nIn the preface to True Theology, Junius noted that this work was written due to the request of some of his “good men and my most devoted colleagues” (bonorum et amantissimorum collegarum meorum postulatione). His main goal in writing this treatise was to explain both what theology and a theologian are in order to inform all Christians about the value of theology in Jesus Christ (de dignitate sua in Christo Iesu) and to convince them of the seriousness of their task (de sui muneris gravitate), “avoiding other concerns as though they were sheer cliffs and the most treacherous Syrtes.” Junius thus expressed his hope that his expositions on true theology would help Christians to “spend their time in these duties day and night with utmost zeal in the presence of the Lord (who through the Spirit instructs those who reflect upon and read these works).” In this preface he also expressed his gratitude that the curators of the university had called him to Leiden, as he could now entirely devote himself to private study and public lectures. Leiden was for him “like Sparta”; here he was free from other all other occupations and troubles, things he had abhorred for so many years.\n\nDuring his teaching years at Heidelberg, Junius had already addressed the question of the nature of theology. At the end of the first volume of his Opera Theologica is a set of twenty-seven theses, with the first one entitled “On the Definition of Theology.” Moreover, during his teaching period at Leiden, Junius also discussed the topic, which is evident from the Leiden theses also printed in his Opera Theologica. The question of the nature of theology was also included in the cycle of disputations at Leiden University presided over by Junius, Gomarus, and Trelcatius (published as Compendium Theologiae). Its first disputation, presided over by Junius and defended by Antonius Walaeus, consisted of twelve theses and was entitled De vera theologia (1597). A final indication of Junius’s longstanding reflections on the nature of theology can be found in a three-volume dogmatic handbook entitled Sum of several commonplaces of Sacred Theology, printed in the Genevan 1613 edition of his Opera Theologica.\n\nAlthough comparison of these publications does not reveal any novel insights on the part of Junius, Donald Sinnema is of the opinion that Junius’s various reflections on the nature of true theology reveal a developing position that came to maturation in True Theology. While Sinnema notes some areas where divergent formulations appear, a detailed comparison of these, though certainly worthwhile, exceeds the purpose of this introduction. It is sufficient to say here that Sinnema has shown that in some respects the Leiden reflections mark a change in Junius’s thinking regarding the genus of true theology. Whereas in the Leiden theses Junius defined theology’s genus as “the divine wisdom of things,” in the earlier Heidelberg theses he distinguished theology as scientia for the following reason: “[Theology] alone has a just knowledge (cognitionem) of demonstrative conclusions concerning God and divine things, which conclusions are necessary, and they cannot be otherwise. It renders the mind of the knower steadfast and is content with contemplation of the truth by itself.” Sinnema further argues that the Heidelberg formulations reflect the arguments of Thomas Aquinas on this subject.\n\nTrue Theology is comprised of thirty-eight chapters and is preceded by thirty-nine theses in which Junius defines his terms and essential theological concern for understanding the task of theology. The work belongs to the so-called locus of prolegomena in which a rationale for the systematic organization of doctrine was presented. This organization became necessary in the later institutional and academic setting of Reformed theology. It was only when Reformed academies and universities were established that formal discussion of the status and task of theology as well as its connection with other disciplines (especially philosophy) became urgent. These prolegomena set out the premises, presuppositions, or principles of their system of thought, providing an interpretative paradigm. One of the fundamental issues in the prolegomena of the Reformed orthodox systems was the meaning and usage of the term theology; considered as part of prolegomena were theology’s parts and divisions, genus, subject, and object. For this reason Junius’s teaching on this topic is of considerable interest. As will become clear when reading this piece, the importance of this treatise is that it clarifies the Reformed concept of Christian theology as fundamentally a relational enterprise, determined by and determinative of the divine–human relationship. In what follows I present a short overview of the main issues and arguments of True Theology.\n\nThe Existence of True Theology\n\nThe presentation of theology according to its origin, nature, forms, and parts occupies a central position in early orthodox prolegomena. In his presentation of the subject matter, Junius follows the standard scholastic pattern of argumentation as given in the following three questions: An sit? (Whether it is?), Quid sit? (What is it?), Qualis sit? (Of what sort is it?). Junius answers the first question in the affirmative: theology does exist. According to Junius, the existence of theology can be demonstrated not only from the etymology of the word theology but also from natural light (naturae lux), the consensus of all people (consensus omnium populorum), and the subject matter of theology itself (res ipsa). If God is the principle of all good things, then the conclusion can be made that all mankind has some knowledge of God and consequently knows the possibility and existence of theology.\n\nJunius’s affirmation of the existence of theology leads him to consider the second question concerning the nature of theology. Before answering this question, however, Junius desires that the reader know the distinction between false and true theology:\n\nThesis 3: Even if all believe that theology exists, nevertheless it is commonly spoken of in two ways. For one theology is true, the other is false and subject to opinion.\n\nThe truth of the matter has produced this equivocation which we have here established, when compared with our own vitiated and erroneous judgment and perception. For indeed it arises from the truth of the subject that the wisdom of divine matters exists, whatever in the final analysis it is and of what sort, and is also said to be true. But as a consequence of the perversion of our judgment and, with the sediment of our senses, so to speak, removing spiritual tastes from our minds, it happens that in this very serious matter also (as in other things) we embrace something false in place of what is true.\n\nWhile Junius is of the opinion that a full discussion of false theology is not useful for Christian theology, he does provide a short definition and classification of it. False theology, he says, is duplex: it can be either common (vulgaris) or philosophical (philosophica). False theology that is vulgar subsists in the imperfect principles of our nature, whereas philosophical false theology—the root of the three branches of mythical, physical, and political theology—is comprised of false conclusions made by erroneous arguments. This division is essentially an assimilation of the distinction made by Stoic philosopher Marcus Terentius Varro (116–27 BC), one that is generally followed by most Reformed scholastics. According to Junius, it was Augustine who transmitted this threefold division to the Christian tradition. Nevertheless, Junius bypasses a thorough discussion of this paradigm because he wants to concentrate on the truth of theology as it leads to salvation. Since Junius’s object is limited at this point—that is, true theology—pagan or natural theology does not play a role in his treatise on true theology. This is also true for much of later Reformed orthodoxy.\n\nTrue Theology as Sapientia\n\nAs Junius’s audience does not deny the existence of true theology, he proceeds immediately to answer the question, What is theology? (Quid sit?) Determinative of Junius’s answer to this question are his answers to two other questions: first, whether our theology is a science and, second, whether this theology is theoretical (contemplative) or practical. First, Junius asks whether theology is intelligentia, scientia, ars, prudentia, or sapientia—namely, intelligence, knowledge, art, prudence, or wisdom. This fivefold classification comes from an important discussion in Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics; from the early thirteenth century onward the medieval doctors assimilated this paradigm, using it in their discussions of the genus of theology. Because it was not specifically addressed in the theology of the Reformers, the Reformed scholastics drew upon this Aristotelian classification in order to identify their view of the genus of theology. According to the Aristotelian paradigm, academic disciplines are intellectual dispositions (habitus intellectuales) that are included within the basic disposition for knowing (habitus sciendi). Using Aristotle’s five basic ways of knowing (intelligentia, scientia, ars, prudentia, and sapientia), Junius next asks whether true theology can be best correlated with any of the recognized genus of academic discipline. Theology, he argues, is unlike intelligentia since intelligentia is identified as knowledge of principles but not of conclusions; theology, however, consists both in principles and conclusions drawn from them. Junius further argues that theology cannot be identified with scientia (discipline of drawing conclusions), nor is theology best identified with ars, which proceeds from intelligentia and scientia and terminates in some external work. Thus, Junius makes the case that theology must be viewed as sapientia. As seen in the following quotation, theology is wisdom in the sense that it combines theoretical and moral dispositions or capacities:\n\nBut our definition of theology encompasses all of these simultaneously. It includes the intellection of first principles, the knowledge of conclusions and ends, and it is the most beneficial skill of our work, by which we strive toward God. Clearly there is nothing that can pass judgment on all these matters with reliability except for wisdom, nothing else that can arrange them appropriately or set them forth in a saving manner. Now since this is the case, there is no other genus that can be established for theology than wisdom, since it makes judgments about the first principles of the sciences in the understanding and about the conclusions from these, as well as embracing by its power all things that are necessary for the perfection of every good, and making use of them all most wisely.\n\nFrom this discussion it appears that Junius was profoundly aware of the importance of the medieval debate over this issue. Although he did not cite the medieval theologians directly, it is apparent that he drew substantively upon them. Moreover, his words seem to suggest that this debate originated in Augustine’s distinction of sapientia from scientia according to which sciences dealt with temporal things and wisdom with eternal things.\n\nThe second question Junius discusses under the section Quid sit theologia? is whether theology is contemplative or practical. Although he believes the issue is important, he deals with it briefly because his conclusions concerning the genus of theology entail the position that theology must be viewed as both theoretical and practical—that is, theology consists of things to be believed and things to be done. Theology defined as wisdom is “the most reliable indicator of principles, the most complete starting point of all sciences both theoretical and practical, and the wisest judge of all actions and reasons, greater than every limitation.”\n\nThe Divisions of True Theology\n\nHaving discussed the definition of theology, including the possibility or existence of true theology and its demarcation from false theology (including the discussion of the genus of true theology), Junius proceeds to elaborate the third question, Qualis sit? In his answer Junius was the first Reformed theologian to use the influential and basic division of theologia archetypa and theologia ectypa. This division is perhaps best clarified by quoting theses 6 through 10 (theses that immediately follow his discussion of true theology as sapientia as expressed in thesis 5):\n\n5. [True] theology is wisdom concerning divine matters (chapter 2).\n\n6. This theology is either archetypal, undoubtedly the wisdom of God Himself, or it is ectypal, having been fashioned by God (chapter 3).\n\n7. Archetypal theology is the divine wisdom of divine matters. Indeed, we stand in awe before this and do not seek to trace it out (chapter 4).\n\n8. Ectypal theology, whether taken in itself, as they say, or relatively in relation to something else, is the wisdom of divine matters, fashioned by God from the archetype of Himself, through the communication of grace for His own glory (chapter 5).\n\n9. And so this so-called theology taken in itself, in fact, is the whole wisdom of divine matters, communicable with what has been created according to the capacity of the one communicating it.\n\n10. But the theology that is relative is the wisdom of divine matters communicated to things created, according to the capacity of the created things themselves. It is, moreover, communicated by union, vision, or revelation.\n\nArchetypal and Ectypal Theology\n\nIn his comments on thesis 7, Junius introduces the distinction between archetypal and ectypal theology. He defines archetypal theology as the theology of God in Himself. It is the theology according to which the triune God knows Himself and everything that is outside Him by an indivisible act of knowing. It is God’s eternal and essential wisdom and therefore God’s essence itself in which all things are present without being the result of a discursive process. Because the topic de theologia was not methodologically treated by Luther, Calvin, or their contemporaries, later generations of Protestant theologians like Junius fell back on the theological prolegomena of the medieval scholastics. According to Junius, the concept of archetypal and ectypal theology can be traced back to the medieval scholastic distinction between divine self-knowledge and human knowledge of God. Junius’s use of this distinction is a good example of the critical reception of the Christian tradition by Reformed theology. He refers to the orthodox fathers who used the term archetypos to indicate a theologia exemplaris of divine and immutable character, and the term ectypa to distinguish a theology that God accommodated to human understanding. More recent theologians (recentiores) call the first theology secundum se, or absolute, the latter theology secundum quid, or theology in relation to human creatures. Archetypal theology, however, is theology in its proper sense; that is, it is the infinite wisdom of God concerning Himself and His works ad intra as they are necessary to Him and ordered by Him in a perpetual relationship according to His infinite reason. On the other hand, ectypal theology is the wisdom creatures have concerning God and about the things that are ordered toward God, all communicated by Him. The two are so disparate that it is impossible to subsume them under one common chapter. Therefore, for Junius archetypal and ectypal theology cannot be placed under one genus since archetypal theology is identical with the divine essence, which by definition cannot be shared with anything else. There is then a radical disjunction between God’s own infinite and necessary (Trinitarian) wisdom and knowledge of Himself and man’s finite and contingent wisdom and knowledge of God.\n\nAccording to Junius’s contemporary Amandus Polanus (1561–1610), professor of theology in Basel, the distinction between divine and human knowledge can be traced back to Scotus’s commentary on the Sententiae, where he introduced the concepts of theologia in se and theologia nostra. In his own systematic formulation of Reformed theology, Polanus references this medieval author’s definition. Not surprisingly, Junius’s discussion of archetypal and ectypal theology is reminiscent of Scotus’s definition of theology. Arguably, the distinction of archetypal and ectypal theology also stands in continuity with early Protestant thought. According to Muller, traces of it can be found in Luther’s distinction between theologia gloriae and theologia crucis and in Calvin’s distinction between the eternal word of God and the revealed Word of God.\n\nFor Junius, archetypal theology is uncreated and identical with the divine being itself. It is essential to God, and thus it is most simple, eternal, intuitive, nondiscursive, absolute, incommunicable, infinite, and most perfect. It is infinite because as principle of all things it pertains to every universal and particular; before God nothing is hidden, but all things are open and laid bare to His eyes (Heb. 4:13). It is incommunicable for it belongs to God alone (propria Dei); as such it cannot be comprehended by any creature, and so we are not called to search it out, but to adore it.\n\nAlthough similar statements are found in later Reformed scholastics, this use of the term theology for divine knowledge was not supported unanimously. According to Muller, Lucas Trelcatius (1573–1603) and Franciscus Turrettinus (1623–1678) developed a simpler division of theology, limiting the proper use of the term theology to human knowledge of God. Junius, however, does not hesitate to use the term theology both for God’s knowledge of Himself and for human knowledge of God. Nevertheless, Junius stressed that God’s uncreated and essential archetypal theology differs entirely from ectypal theology, the latter being accidental and finite and a sort of outflow and efflux (aporroè) of the former. Junius explains:\n\nThesis 8: Ectypal theology, whether taken in itself, as they say, or relatively in relation to something else, is the wisdom of divine matters, fashioned by God from the archetype of Himself, through the communication of grace for His own glory.\n\nWith this definition Junius clarifies the different causes of ectypal theology. Although theology is preeminently in the mind of God Himself, this divine self-knowledge is the causal basis for human theology. Ectypal theology is thus created by God, its efficient cause. Just as the moon receives its light from the sun, so God, in ectypal theology, communicates His true light to creatures. But not only is God the efficient cause (causa efficiens) of ectypal theology, He is at the same time its final cause (causa finalis) because theology is meant to glorify God. Junius further explains that the material cause (or subject matter) of ectypal theology concerns the res divinae, and the formal cause is indicated by the phrase “[Ectypal theology] is fashioned from the archetypal one through the communication of grace (ex archetypo illa informatam per communicationem gratiae).”\n\nJunius’s use of Aristotelian aetiology raises the issue of the Protestant scholastic use of causal language. The popular response has been that this language is symptomatic of an excessive Aristotelianism and, in the case of the Reformed orthodox, is evidence of a betrayal of the more biblical approaches to theology as given by the Reformers. Some have claimed this is evidence of a Protestant scholastic metaphysical and deterministic interest. But Junius introduces the causal terminology of Aristotle simply to explain the origin of ectypal theology. In this way he formalized and nuanced the discussion, providing a context within which the arguments concerning the distinction between archetypal and ectypal theology could be understood. As evident in this work, Junius used causal language not as an overarching pattern, but as a heuristic tool designed to ground a whole series of issues explaining his theological epistemology. This especially becomes clear when we note Junius’s distinction regarding the causes of ectypal theology; he differentiates between the internal concept of ectypal theology in the mind of God and the external form in which God communicates this concept to human beings. The internal concept in the mind of God is His divine will and grace; the external form is the body of knowledge that God decided to reveal to mankind. Junius compares God’s internal concept of ectypal knowledge to a source (fons), whereas the external form he likens to a lake (lacus) derived from the source.\n\nFurthermore, the concept of ectypal knowledge existing in the mind of God must be distinguished from archetypal theology. Junius calls the former theologia simpliciter dicta or theology absolutely considered; this differs from archetypal theology in that the latter is incommunicable while the former is communicable. When communication of ectypal knowledge takes place then theologia simpliciter dicta becomes theologia secundum quid (i.e., relational theology), for it depends upon God’s gracious accommodation of Himself to a form that finite beings are capable of understanding. Junius calls this accommodated theology a second-order theology, whereas he considered theologia simpliciter dicta to be a first-order theology.\n\nThis does not mean, however, that for Junius the identity of archetypal theology with the divine essence of God renders Him incapable of communicating to the created order. God Himself bridges the gap by graciously revealing ectypal theology to His creatures by an act of His free and contingent will ad extra. At the same time, the distinction between archetypal and ectypal theology underscores the fact that human beings do not have direct access to the knowledge of God. Thus, humans are dependent on God’s external self-disclosure. In other words, there is no way of access from man to God, but only from God to man.\n\nFinally, Junius stresses that both forms of ectypal theology (theologia simpliciter dicta and secundum quid) equal the distinction between theologia in se and theologia in subjectis, namely, theology in itself and theology in finite knowing subjects. While the former (theologia in se) is communicable by God—but cannot be grasped by human effort—ectypal theology in subjectis is a mediated and communicated theology. It is an act of God’s will without which He would remain unknown and unknowable. Therefore, the main interest of theologians, Junius comments, should not be focused on ectypal theology that is theologia in se, but on the theology secundum quid or in subjectis (that is, the relational and communicated form of ectypal theology). Junius concludes this section emphasizing that “this theology is particularly ours, the one by the communication of which we drink from the abundance of God in Christ Jesus (John 1:16).”\n\nThree Kinds of Ectypal Theology\n\nHaving discussed the fundamental distinctions between archetypal and ectypal theology, Junius discusses next the three genera of ectypal theology (in subjecto), each distinguished from the next as it can be communicated in different ways and to different subjects: by union (unione) to Christ, by vision (visione) to the beatified, and by revelation (revelatione) to the pilgrim or viator. In descending order, ectypal theology can thus be communicated to Jesus Christ, to the spirits in heaven, and to people on earth. When ectypal theology is communicated by union, the result is the theology of Christ as the God-man (theanthropos) or the theology of the Mediator (theologia unionis in Christo); when communicated to the blessed in heaven, the result is theologia visionis; and when communicated to men on earth it results in theologia revelationis. Junius’s discussion of this threefold communication of ectypal theology is worth quoting at length:\n\nThe first theology is the highest and most complete of them all, from which we all draw (John 1:16). And it exists in Christ according to His humanity. The second theology is perfect, by which blessed spirits acquire in the heavens the glorious vision of God and by which we ourselves will, in the same way, see God (1 John 3:2). The third, finally, is not perfect in its own right, but rather through the revelation of faith it has been so endowed with the principles of the same truth that it can conveniently be called full and complete from our perspective. Yet it is incomplete if it should be compared with that heavenly theology for which we hope, as the apostle taught the Corinthians (1 Cor. 13:12). And so this, in sum, is our theology.\n\nIt is particularly interesting that Junius’s subdivisions of ectypal theology in subjecto are dominated by a christological emphasis. This christological framework is unmistakably present as Junius makes the point that the theology of union in Christ is the principle of the two other forms of ectypal theology—the theology of vision and revelation. Whereas archetypal theology is the matrix of all forms of theology, the theology of union is the mother (mater) of the two other forms of ectypal theology, that is, the theology of vision and revealed theology. Junius concludes:\n\nThe archetypal is the fount of them all, but the ectypal is, as it were, the common reservoir or storage vessel. From the divine fullness of this saving vessel, created things draw in two ways: One group of them by sight in God’s presence, the other by revelation, though they are of course absent and on pilgrimage away from the Lord (2 Cor. 5:6–7). From these two modalities the two other genera of ectypal theology have proceeded: One of these the orthodox fathers called the theology of the blessed, the other, that of pilgrims. Therefore the second form of the ectypal theology is the theology of the blessed, or the exalted theology. The third we can call that of pilgrims or the humble type. And so Christ sanctified both these types of theology in His own person, since He both experienced the humble theology in the humiliation of the flesh, and now enjoys the exalted type in that very exaltation by which He now has been exalted above every name, evidently so that He might show that the common principle of each theology resides in Himself.\n\nThe conclusion seems to be justified that in True Theology Christology undergirds the presuppositions and approach to the nature of true theology.\n\nPilgrim Theology\n\nThe last category of ectypal theology is that of pilgrims on earth or theologia viatorum—a theology preceding the theology of the beatified in heaven. Here Junius draws upon the traditional distinction between pilgrims and blessed, along with the corresponding in via and in patria, a concept that dates back to at least Augustine and was used extensively by medieval theologians. Commenting on 1 Corinthians 13:8–9, Junius declares that in contrast to the perfection and permanence of both the theology of union and vision, the theology of the “viator” is “mixed with our weakness and imperfection because it comprehends only the basic principles of that most perfect theology in heaven. By these principles that are indeed perfect in and of themselves but rendered imperfect in a certain way [they] are carried up to heavenly perfection.” The language of in via and in patria further indicate a strong teleological and eschatological orientation of theology. Theology on earth is thus always a pilgrim theology and, therefore, an imperfect theology.\n\nAccording to Junius, nature and grace are the two basic forms for the communication of revealed or pilgrim theology. Nature represents an internal or immanent ground for the communication of divine knowledge, whereas grace represents an external ground for its communication. On the basis of the former a natural (revealed) theology is constructed, and on the basis of the latter is built a supernatural (also revealed) theology.\n\nA final comment should also be made about Junius’s identification of theology as a mixed discipline (i.e., that it is both speculative/contemplative and practical). Although Junius’s distinctions between archetypal and ectypal theology can be traced back to Scotist origins, this does not mean he held the Scotist view of theology as an essentially practical discipline. Like most of the Reformed orthodox, Junius assumed that theology was a mixed discipline in its approach to the knowledge of God; it is both contemplative and practical.\n\nThe Significance of Junius’s True Theology for Reformed Dogmatics\n\nAfter its introduction by Junius, the distinction between archetypal and ectypal theology (along with its subdivisions) became commonplace in Protestant orthodoxy and was treated in every systematic work of note. Whereas Junius offered a thorough and at times original investigation of the fundamental meaning of theology and its scientific foundations, his successors primarily presented a summary of his main results. This is true not only of the Reformed theologians but also of Lutheran dogmaticians. Thus Johannes Gerhard (1582–1637), generally considered to be the most prominent orthodox Lutheran theologian after Luther, followed (at times verbatim) the order of Junius’s discussions. In fact, there is little difference between the Lutheran and Reformed orthodox on these points, except on the matter of the theologia unionis.\n\nAccording to Junius and his Reformed colleagues, and contrary to most Lutheran scholastics, the theology of union did not involve the communication of archetypal theology to Christ’s human nature. While Gerhard simply stated that the theology of union was, by virtue of the personal union, a perfect knowledge of God and divine things, the Wittenberg professor Abraham Calov (1612–1686) went a step further, asserting that Christ, according to His human nature, possessed archetypal theology by virtue of the exchange of properties between the two natures of Christ (communicatio idiomatum). According to Calov, this rested on the supposition that the unity of the two natures in Christ’s person demanded a real communication or sharing of attributes. Consequently the Lutherans stated that Christ was in possession of the archetypal knowledge of God as it was communicated to His human nature. Junius and the Reformed scholastics emphatically denied this, arguing that the finitude of the human nature cannot grasp the infinity of God (finitum non capax infiniti). Furthermore, they argued Christ’s humanity did not get lost in His divinity. Christ was like us in all things—also with respect to knowledge—and because His human nature has certain limitations, there was room for it to develop (cf. Luke 2:52). Thus, for Junius and the Reformed, Christ could not possess archetypal theology; the theology of union did not involve the communication of archetypal theology to Christ’s human nature. Secondly, against the Lutheran doctrine of the genus majestaticum—a doctrine stating that the human nature of Christ participates in the divine glory and majesty—Junius and his Reformed colleagues argued that this would imply a change in God’s essence. Rather, they argued the properties or attributes of each of the two natures coincide in the one person of Christ and could only be predicated of Him personally. The exchange of properties, therefore, exists from the two natures to the person, and not between the two natures. Because the communicatio idiomatum does not take place in the abstract (i.e., between the natures), but in the concrete (i.e., at the level of the person), Jesus Christ does not possess archetypal theology. Although a detailed description of this debate exceeds the limits of this introduction, arguably the results of Reformed and Lutheran Christology played a signifcant role in shaping the form and contents of Reformed prolegomena.\n\nAs indicated earlier, during the first half of the seventeenth century the distinction between archetypal and ectypal theology was assumed by nearly every Reformed author. To give only a few examples: Amandus Polanus concisely summarized Junius’s paradigm in his Syntagma (1609); Johannes Alsted, professor of philosophy and theology at Herborn (Germany) and later in Weissenburg (Transylvania), used Junius’s distinctions in his Methodus Sacrosanctae Theologiae (1614); Johannes Polyander addressed the topic in the Synopsis purioris theologiae (1625), an influential compendium of the period; and Johannes Wollebius cited Junius’s distinctions almost verbatim in his Christianae Theologiae Compendium (1626).\n\nDuring the second half of the seventeenth century, Junius’s classification became normative for many Reformed theologians in their study of theology as a discipline. It is found not only in the high orthodox systems of Gisbertus Voetius (1589–1676), Melchior Leydecker (1642–1721), Petrus van Mastricht (1630–1706), and Francis Turrettin (1623–1687) but also in the prolegomena of federal systems like those of Johannes Cocceius (1603–1669), Franciscus Burman (1628–1679), Johann Heinrich Heidegger (1633–1698), Abraham Heidanus (1597–1678), and Johannes Braun (1628–1708). It is important to note the great variety of theologians who followed Junius’s divisions and classification of theology as found in his True Theology. This should warn us against making a facile juxtaposition of federal–biblical theology with scholastic–dogmatic theology, an error found in many of the discussions of federal theology.\n\nFurthermore, the archetypal/ectypal distinction was not confined to Continental Reformed theology, but can also be found in English Puritan theologians such as John Owen and Richard Baxter. Jacobus Arminius also endorsed Junius’s distinction between archetypal and ectypal theology, but later Arminian theologians like Simon Episcopius (1583–1643) and Philippus van Limborch (1633–1712) vehemently rejected this distinction as “vain subleties without solidity and utility.” By giving up this distinction, however, their theological systems proved to be more open to seventeenth-century rationalism, whereas the Reformed system—due to its archetypal and ectypal paradigm—presented a vital opposition to it.\n\nThe divisions and classifications of True Theology were still prominent into the eighteenth century, evident in the prolegomena of late orthodox theologians. Johannes à Marck (1656–1731) and Bernardinus de Moor (1709–1780) carefully worked through Junius’s classifications. De Moor emphasized that the archetypa–ectypa distinction is founded on biblical grounds (e.g., Matt. 11: 27; 1 Cor. 2:10–11) and that it is conducive for thoughtful meditation on God’s revelation in conjunction with the practice of piety.\n\nFinally, some nineteenth- and twentieth-century authors, such as Abraham Kuyper, Herman Bavinck, Louis Berkhof, and Wolfhart Pannenberg, commented on Junius’s arrangement of theology. It is somewhat ironic that at the end of his career Karl Barth—more than once a severe critic of early modern Reformed theology—highlighted the importance of Junius’s distinction by stating in his Einführung in die evangelische Theologie (1962) that the history of Neo-Protestant theology would have been quite different and much better “if these seemingly abstruse distinctions [theologia archetypa and ectypa] were not qualified as a ‘dogmatische Antiquität’ by the theologians of the fateful turn (‘verhängnisvollen Wende) around the eighteenth century.”\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nFrom this survey it becomes clear that Junius and early modern Reformed theologians utilized the insights of patristic, medieval, and Reformation theologians when framing their concept of theology. This is especially evident in True Theology. The use of the archetypal/ectypal distinction and the crucial significance of the theology of union in its relation to the two other forms of ectypal theology was, for the Reformed orthodox, a means of developing the principles and task of theology, a discipline to be determined by a strong Trinitarian and christological framework. In this context it is important to note here that natural theology is seen by the Reformed as a category of revealed theology; it is not an autonomous and independent source of knowledge. What is more, the archetypal/ectypal paradigm clearly differentiates between two entirely different forms of natural theology, forms often confused in contemporary literature: a pagan form and a Christian form. As Junius makes clear, the first form of natural theology belongs to the category of false theology, whereas the latter is designated as true theology (placed under the category of ectypal theology with its clear christological orientation).\n\nThis further indicates that the Reformed orthodox never used the term Deus (as the principium essendi of theology) in a neutral or unqualified sense in order to construe a rationalistic natural theology. From the very outset the prolegomena of the Reformed orthodox envisaged the triune God, or Deus foederatus in Christo, as the object of theology. Christian theology, they argued, deals with God as covenanted in Christ not only in order to know Him but, first and foremost, to worship Him.\n\nThis contradicts the thesis of nineteenth- and twentieth-century scholarship that argued that post-Reformation Reformed theology was instrumental in the rise of Enlightenment rationalism. According to this argument, post-Reformation Reformed theologians came to view special revelation as simply a completion of our natural knowledge of God, and thus Christian knowledge is able to fit well with a rationally based knowledge.\n\nJunius’s True Theology gives enough evidence to falsify the claim that post-Reformation Reformed theology presented a doctrine of a distant and unknowable God (the Deus nudus absconditus) as the axiomatic governing principle of the entire theological enterprise. Instead, as evident in this work, the overarching paradigm for understanding the principles and task of theology was the archetypal/ectypal distinction, and the parallel distinction between the essential or ad intra dimension and the contingent or ad extra dimension of divine agency. Furthermore, True Theology is an excellent example that early modern Reformed theology was not a rationalistic, deterministic, or decretal system, but rather a relational enterprise, determined by and determinative of the divine–human relationship. The important role Junius played in helping shape this Reformed tradition and the significance of his True Theology for the development of Reformed dogmatics cannot be overestimated.\n\nNotes\n\nTranslator’s Preface\n\nWhen in May of 2013 I began working in earnest on this translation of Junius, I was largely unaware not only of the great joy that would accrue to me through the task of rendering his dense and stylized prose into manageable English, but also of the prominent position that Junius holds in the development of Reformed thought. Though I counted myself as having good familiarity with the theological and philosophical currents of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries for someone trained as a classicist, I soon realized how far deficient was my knowledge when I began to survey the literature surrounding the figure of Franciscus Junius and the events of his life and work. The many narrows through which Junius providentially squeezed himself, the close scrapes with death, the political intrigue and conspiracies—all of these were surprising to read from the pen of a man known, if at all, for developing the Leiden theology as a synthesis of medieval and Protestant exegetical and philosophical concerns. As I read more broadly, moreover, I began to see the wide-ranging influence that Junius exercised on subsequent generations of Reformed theologians and how his formulations were crucial to the work of Arminius and other Remonstrants, as well as to Francis Turretin, John Owen, and other Reformed scholars.\n\nBefore discussing briefly the translation and acknowledging those who helped me, I would like to comment on two aspects of Junius’s writing that were, as a translator, quite pleasing to encounter. First, his Latin style is thoroughly Ciceronian, bearing all the marks of the late Renaissance obsession with rhetorical argumentation. It shows deep knowledge of Cicero’s philosophical works (especially De Officiis, De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum, and De Natura Deorum) and familiarity with his letters. In addition, Junius borrows phrases from the classical authors Caesar, Horace, Livy, Lucretius, Pliny, Terence, and Vergil, as well as the fathers Augustine and Tertullian. On the Greek side, he is grounded in Aristotle, of course, and alludes to Plato and Plutarch as well. It is impossible to know, except in the case of Cicero (whose works he mentions reading in the Life), whether Junius knew all these authors directly or via florilegia (i.e., handbooks) and as commonplaces learned from his own teachers (primarily, it would seem, in childhood and early youth). In addition, it is somewhat surprising that there are no allusions to the philosophical writings of Seneca, with which Calvin himself, and presumably other Reformers, was deeply familiar. The only reference to Seneca is in the definition of theology that Junius cites Augustine as having borrowed from him and Varro.\n\nThe second observation I would like to make is that, despite the incredibly dense and difficult prose arguments that Junius at times constructs (with commendable consistency)—necessitated, no doubt, by the complexity of his subject—it is evident that he is working diligently to edify his readers and even to allure them with metaphors, examples, and illustrations. Junius’s use of analogies is not quite deft, in my estimation, but it is nevertheless a welcome respite to the packed scholastic reasoning, and winsome in its own way. His careful weaving together of biblical citations also adds a level of piety to the work that, while not like reading Calvin’s Institutes, is genuinely pastoral and engaging.\n\nIn addition to the comments I make throughout the work on particular construals and concepts, it seems appropriate to set out briefly my overall approach to the task of translation, so that readers who may wish to compare (as I hope they will) Junius’s Latin to my rendering will be better equipped to find points of disagreement and even consent. As Junius himself would no doubt be careful to assert, translation derives from the combination of the Latin verb fero, “to carry or to bear,” with the prefix trans-, most easily rendered as “across.” Though seldom considered, we must ask ourselves what is being “carried across” in any given translation.\n\nCertainly it is not merely the words, for such would yield not a translation but a transliteration. For example “baptism” is not a translation of the Greek word βάπτισμα but a transliteration, in which the Greek letter beta is represented by English b, alpha by a, pi by p, etc. Sometimes transliteration can be very helpful, especially when the word in question is a term of art. Thus, I have retained archetypal and ectypal as transliterations of their Greek originals, as Junius himself does when bringing them into Latin.\n\nOther terms of art, specifically the important trio of concepts secundum se, secundum quid, and simpliciter, as well as in obiecto and in subiecto, I have translated, thanks to Willem van Asselt’s guidance, as follows. Secundum se has been rendered “in relation to itself” or “in relation to themselves” as the context requires; secundum quid has been construed as “according to something else” and “relative”; and simpliciter, composed of no parts, I have taken as “in itself.” In obiecto stands as “in the object” or “in an object” and in subiecto as “in the subject” or “in a subject.” Van Asselt also suggested “specifying characteristic” for differentia, which I have adopted throughout.\n\nBut transliteration, or word-for-word representation, of an author in another language is not truly translation. Rather, the goal of the translator is to convey unaltered and without comment the thought of the author as he has represented it in his own words, for it is the thought that one seeks to “carry across.” This usually means not searching for a single English word to stand for one Latin word, nor seeking to retain the order of the original clauses in an artificial or strained fashion in the target language. Instead, the translator must strive to capture the thought of the author and present it with utmost accuracy in English. The most difficult aspects of this task are (1) ensuring that the author’s thought is truly conveyed, not an admixture of the author’s thought with the translator’s understanding; and (2) conveying in the target language puns and other artful structures that are more pleasing in the original. Examples of this would be figura etymologica (various plays on words) and the preference Latin shows for dense repetition as a mark of precision and good style, whereas English favors variety sometimes to the detriment of clarity. In translating Junius, I am more confident that I have succeeded in overcoming the first difficulty than the second, though the reader must judge for himself.\n\nIn closing, I wish to acknowledge the many individuals who contributed to the success of this work. First, I thank my friend Jonathon Beeke who originally suggested that I consider translating Junius and put me in contact with Jay Collier. Richard Muller provided generous early encouragement and clarification of some important concepts and also graciously agreed to write the foreword. I owe a large debt to Willem van Asselt as well, whose 2002 essay on Junius both sparked my interest in the author and taught me much. That his introduction would also grace this volume was good news indeed. Calvin College supported this project by granting me a Calvin Research Fellowship as a Diekema Fellow and a one-course release in the fall of 2013 to work on the translation. My colleagues in the classics department, Young Kim, Mark Williams, and Jeff Winkle, offered helpful suggestions, as did Frans and Kate van Liere from the history department. Todd Rester also provided encouragement and helpful review. Lastly, Lia Gelder, as a Calvin College McGregor Research Fellow, helped considerably with the final edits and suggested the subject headings for the Vita.\n\nThe lion’s share of thanks, however, is owed to my emeritus colleague Ken Bratt, who generously read every word of both the Vita and Tractatus with great care, providing meticulous and copious comments. His efforts not only improved the style and readability of the work considerably, but also helped to identify a few errors in my own construals. With much gratitude, this work is dedicated to him.\n\nMay God grant spiritual fruit from this endeavor to my wife, Tara, whose wit and wisdom are to me a constant source of joy and instruction, and to my four loving children, Freddie, Jillian, Lucius, and Sophia, whose graces and service to me are clear evidence of God’s unfailing mercy. And may He continue to secure His church militant in that true and heavenly theology that will in His time bring all His children to maturity. Soli Deo gloria.\n\nThe Life of the Noble and Learned\n\nFranciscus Junius, Doctor of Sacred Theology and\n\nDistinguished Professor\n\nat Leiden University\n\nas written by himself and published by\n\nPaullus G. F. P. N. Merula, Esq.,\n\nwho is also the chronicler of the events in Leiden.\n\nPreface\n\nI, Paullus G.F.P.N. Merula, Esq., send greetings\n\nto the French churches of Jesus Christ throughout Belgium.\n\nNot long ago the thought entered my mind, most Christian gentlemen, that it is shameful and unworthy of any man whom God has made both to aid others and also his own country, that he know the deeds wrought by Romans, Greeks, and other nations many centuries past down to the last sliver. But when it comes to those deeds which were wrought at home and in his own country very recently, that he should not only display a deplorable ignorance, but even hold them in disregard and contemptuously turn aside his face. Lest I seem marred by that stain that afflicts many others, two years ago I conceived the desire to gather up from every source all of the events that had to do with the condition of our commonwealth and which pertained to the war which is being waged, partly from published sources and partly from public and private writings. My intention then was to read through what I had collected and very carefully enter what I had read into the Public Register with a few well-chosen yet vigorous words, once I had noted the proper order of events. This was the goal I set for such great expense and trouble, and it will become evident with God’s help in the passage of time. My talent, however (which as I freely confess, for this should not be considered a fault), has always been so disposed that it would never, and in no way, match my prayers and what I had begun. I had read very broadly from many authors (the total was seven thousand and climbing). I had made endless notes from such a great storehouse of principals and authors. Already I lay really overwhelmed beneath such a mountain of annotations, for I could barely recognize the actual sources of the waves of public events by which we have been inundated for almost thirty years to an incredible extent. This reason compelled me to approach various men whose forays into these topics I had remembered were very precisely executed, and who I had heard had taken a great part—since they were equipped with a unique authority—in the completion of those tasks. I sought their advice, to ask that they kindly make clear to me whatever they knew about the beginning of these disturbances. Without a doubt the foremost of this group was the worthy and noble man, our revered Franciscus Junius. For as many asserted, he had stood at the very sources of these perturbations and had recorded very carefully how great were the storms and how extensive and treacherous was the sea on which the ship of state had been cast, and on which we are now borne peacefully and a little separated from all hazard we now coast, while that most experienced Helmsman keeps watch over the rudder, his eyes fixed on all dangers. I appealed, I urged, I prayed that he would, to the extent that his memory afforded, explain something of those times. Without difficulty I obtained from that man what I sought, so learned is he and indeed born for the task of instructing others. The great man explained faithfully and without pretense the true and chief cause of this most destructive war: (1) about the birth of the Inquisition in Spain when Ferdinand was in power; (2) the expansion of that same effort (the work of Pope Sixtus IV); (3) Sixtus’s unbending domination of freedom, privilege, the common people, the nobles, and even the king himself; and, finally, Sixtus’s propagation of the Inquisition beyond the sizable borders of the Iberians. He explained many details of the virulent bitterness of the Edicts against those who were confessing the Reformed faith: about the publication of the Edicts without waiting for the approval of the states-general, as well as their violent enforcement, which took from many poor men their fortunes, tortured consciences, stripped civil governments of their privileges, and with scarcely any consideration for age nor sex hauled off all levels of society, to the slaughterhouse, chopping block, and torture chambers. This enforcement, in a monstrous fashion, raged against all kinds of persons with prison, chains, the rack, the sword, the cross, fire, burial, and drowning, with no stated charge, on any day whatsoever, often even during the dark of night. Junius recalled countless crimes of these new bishops who, as Inquisitors of the Faith, were wielding and exercising the power of the sword under the specious excuse of preserving the Catholic religion. This was done without the government or king’s knowledge, or certainly without him giving it his attention, against all the traditions and customs of our ancestors, against the charters of the ancient monasteries, against the legal claims of the rest of the bishoprics. All this was done through the treacherous craft of Granvelle (there was nothing he was unwilling or unable to do for the destruction of the Belgians). Junius also explained that the leading citizens had finally intervened in all these affairs to some extent, as they saw by clear signs that if these first starts were not opposed and quickly guarded against, the people, who in other respects were very long-suffering and very loyal to their ruler, could not be held any longer in their place and that some sure disaster was threatening all of Belgium.\n\nThe people had attempted nothing by violence, nothing by wicked device (though they were, quite unfairly, charged with such actions). The Baron à Montigny was dispatched to Spain to seek relief from the severity of the edicts. He returned shortly thereafter, his mission a failure when the mind of the good prince was beset by the Inquisitors and torn in two directions. Thereupon he called down curses on the treachery toward the most peaceful king, the deceit perpetrated against the nobility, the contempt and outrages shown to the free states, the cruelty toward a people obedient and submissive to his rule, and finally, the conspiracy of a few not only to crush Belgium, but even to snuff out all the remnants of the peace and tranquility of the rest of the Christian world. Junius explained further that, since Granvelle was more and more producing his offspring of new bishops, the Spaniard Armenter was sent to Spain again by the design of the governess and of the nobles, to explain to the prince that the people could not be held to their duty any longer, that the leading citizens after that were no longer willing to guard his place in the management of the state unless Granvelle’s unbridled boldness were checked. Junius was saying that the embassage had these powers so that the man, incredibly good at insinuating his wiles, would be recalled from Belgium by the prince. He was predicting that the Belgians would indeed catch their breath a little with the departure of this man who was engineering such awful tragedies. But, when scarcely a few months had passed, this very good prince had again been compelled to impose the yoke of the Inquisition on his own citizens. He forced upon them the bishops, edicts, and even the Council of Trent. For those who had been dedicated to the Evangelical teaching he decreed forms of barbaric torture. Everyone had foreseen in these punishments a severe uprising of the people, and the complete destruction of all Belgium. In order to avert this catastrophe, the Count of Egmont was dispatched to Spain in the name of the prefect and leading citizens to try to calm the mind of the prince, to lessen a little the bitterness of the edicts, in a word to remove the Inquisition. The prince responded mildly through Egmont: he had promised everything for the sake of Belgium; he had demanded that the sovereigns of the whole province make it their business to see to it carefully that no harm come to the Republic and set down some plan by which it might be possible to avoid such great dangers while keeping the Catholic religion intact. When Egmont returned to Belgium, the task of putting together this plan had been entrusted to three bishops and to the same number of theologians, likewise to three experts in canon law, and to an equal number of those skilled in civil law. At this point, all these plans had been thrown into confusion by the partisans of the pope, of Granvelle, and of the Inquisitors. Afterward, letters had been obtained from the king by force, in which the Inquisition was given reign, as though by his supreme will, throughout all Belgium; the obeying of the edicts was imposed down to the tiniest point; the rule of the bishops was inaugurated in all the states, and the declaration and publication of the Decrees of the Council of Trent were ordered.\n\nAs Junius came to the end of his discourse, he added that so many tears had arisen especially for this reason; from this thread had begun the greatest dismay of everyone, the overwhelming sorrow of individuals, and the public grief of the provinces. From this had resulted the many different meetings of the nobles, their alliances, the suppliant books, and finally those wars most deadly, and more than civil.\n\nHe was detailing these and other events which it would be tedious to record while I gazed at him with my eyes fixed. As I asked which of these events he had in his writings, he said there were none. Never­theless, he nodded toward something noted in a certain brief little commentary which he had once written about his own life, following the pattern of M. Aemilius Scaurus and great men of a more remote time. When he realized that I wanted to see it and skim through it, so kind is he, he brought it out. The beginning of the work so delighted me that I got his permission to look over it for a few days. I read it, reread it; I evaluated it with no little care. I was amazed that the life of one man was so varied. I was astounded by the difficult origins of so great a man, of a childhood disturbed by so many woes, an adolescence spent so dangerously, even an atheism that attacked him from the Devil in his schemes. I stood amazed at a youth almost given up to public life, consecrated by God and set apart for His church—a man called to the arena; so faithfully and with such a keen mind had he conducted himself, suffusing the minds of the young with knowledge of true doctrine concerning God and glittering with his own examples of all the virtues for his listeners. Finally, in fact, I was astounded at a man who had wrestled through the most arduous contests and had been snatched miraculously from an ocean of countless very savage tumults. I grieved that the knowledge of such great kindnesses of God, which had been conferred upon one man, would lie hidden with that one man and should be unknown to so many. I asked to get back the work that I had already returned, not with any other purpose than to make a copy for others to read. Concerning this publication, he shared not even one word when he was writing the account of his own life. If he had denied my request, the Christian church, which has a very keen interest in not disregarding these events, would have been compelled to suffer this loss. Or if he had agreed, those who wished him ill would have objected that this great man was hunting for his own glory. Surely different people will be instructed in different ways from this. The governing authorities, the protectors of our bodies, the caretakers of our possessions, will discover how great were the dangers when the foundations of this very beautiful building were laid, a building to which they are applying all their effort to preserve now that its roof is restored. They will learn with how much blood the roof peak that was going to be demolished now stands fast; they will find out how much effort was employed stirring up almost all the components for the destruction and eradication of the craftsmen. The shepherds of souls will see how numerous are the difficulties to which ministers of the church will be led. They will see how many crises, how many sorrows, how many slanders accompany all forms of leadership, even in the church. Here they will see, as in a mirror, that the unique quality of ministers is faithfulness; that of this there are so to speak three jewels: true acknowledgment of God, which is the font and measure of all virtues, constancy, and diligence in executing one’s office. They will see that these three are aided by the highest zeal for God’s glory and by a most burning desire for that glory to be promoted. Parents will understand what their duty is in training their children: that they must be taught true religion and equipped above all for divine worship, so that they might both honor religion and learn from their earliest years to speak of God; that they must be kept from the habit of taking oaths, and guarded from indecent speech and action, prevented from the company of the wicked, that they be filled with good habits through habituation, warning, training, and in examples. They will understand that when, at a more advanced age, they will have to be dedicated to a particular vocation, the inborn nature of these same children must be discerned and their talents carefully recognized wherever their minds more incline them. They will understand at what age boys should be put to the task of learning literature, how much they should be burdened with the labor of learning, and to what kinds of tutors and teachers they should be entrusted to be educated.\n\nChildren from this publication will learn to submit themselves willingly to their parents’ judgment, by a kind of love and respect for them. They will learn to show them obedience and gratitude and that their blemishes and weaknesses must be borne with patience. Teachers will understand that those whom they have received as entrusted to their care must be attended with all care and love; that consistency is necessary in imparting these skills, in order for doctrine and the knowledge of different subjects to be carefully poured into tender little minds more deeply and with greater fruit. Repetition and examinations must be carefully supervised, so that the students’ judgment may be shaped and strengthened, their talents sharpened, their memory supported, the course of their studies confined with fixed limits, and they become accustomed to learning, leaving aside useless interests, to learn useful things. They will come to understand that everything must be done with moderation, lest, weighed down by the load of studies, they be ruined. Teachers will see that they must refrain from applying the rod; that there should be no blazing anger, no raging like Orbilius. For students’ vices are hardened by the brutality which is typically meted out for a fault, while their virtues grow weak and are destroyed. A more harsh form of instruction should be taken away. The students’ mistakes, especially those of the rather gentle-minded, should more often be ignored or mildly corrected and pointed out with a calm expression, so that a harsher rebuke may not reduce their love for literature and produce in them both a hopelessness for arriving where their nature was raising them and a hatred of that subject for which earlier they burned with the highest love. From this workshop, as it were, the students will come to share their instructors’ love of literature and devotion, their precision, their industry; they will show obedience and gratitude finally toward their instructors, by whose effort and loyalty they have become better scholars, and have received instruction.\n\nIn this Life the duties of spouses are also observed: love, faithfulness, companionship, and so forth. From here all will drink in for themselves, to speak briefly, instances of the chief virtues, i.e., piety, justice, perseverance, sobriety, propriety, gratitude, long-suffering, courage, sincerity, kindness, chastity, decency, moderation, carefulness in speech, friendliness, and other things. From all these one can note how much difference there is between the publication of the life of a man who always acted privately, and one on whom God placed a public office either in the church or in political life. Some of the first group conducted themselves in such a way, and do now, that their actions are worth being noted by many. But the second group were the kind of persons that it was necessary to know almost anything they did: either to imitate it, if it was something good, if it was evident, if it was consistent with justice and noble character; or otherwise to avoid it. God is at work in one way in private matters and in another in public, and He wishes the deeds of public officials to affect everyone. And if only more writings of this kind were brought to light, we certainly would see greater proofs of God’s divine kindness toward His church, though we do notice these very great indications everywhere.\n\nNow I commit this work to you, most Christian gentlemen, of one who is your countryman, who was born in your midst, who was to you a guide and shepherd when you were in the greatest danger, whose work that great Shepherd made famous and brilliant in the reformation of His church and in cleansing it of all human filth. Exercise sound judgment, good gentlemen, and hold before God in your prayers both the one who is thus committed, and He who does the committing. Farewell.\n\nLeiden, the Netherlands, December 13, 1594\n\nNotes\n\nThe Life of Franciscus Junius\n\nThe Lord’s mercies I shall relate, when I give an account of my poor life, that the Lord who made me may be glorified in me. Yet Thou, O Lord, open my lips, that my mouth may proclaim Thy praise. Guide my spirit, that now and in my whole life I may make known Thy faithfulness and truth. In Thy presence, O Lord, I shall speak of myself. And I would rather speak of Thee, O Lord, at work within me; so I will proclaim the truth which by Thy careful providence Thou didst want to be revealed in me by Thine endless mercy. Thus my friends, when they inquire, may see, and the children, whom Thou hast granted me, may remember that truth of Thine displayed toward me; and all the righteous who seek Thy mercy, by which Thou hast reached me, may be led along with me to the innermost places of Thy truth. So I shall weave together, starting with my ancestors, the origin of my life. And to the warp of the present hour I shall draw out its woof, while Thou who seest all things look on, that a unique proof of Thy kindness and glory may be shown in the presence of Thy children.\n\nFamily History\n\nMy grandfather was William, the son of John and the grandson of William. He was Lord of Boffardiniere at Vayrac (Sigebertus calls it Issoudun, as do the common people). He served in the guard and livery of King Louis the Twelfth, the most Christian King of France, and in the Navarre War eighty-one years past he gave distinguished service, when Ferdinand the King of Spain, supported by the condemnation of that openly volatile Pope Julius II, had taken over the greater part of the rule of Navarre, which had been wrested from John d’Albret. In view of these services, the title of the nobility itself was bestowed upon my grandfather and our family by the King. As a boy, moreover, I saw the trophies of my grandfather’s exploits that he had dedicated in the great church at Vayrac, named for St. Cyrus. He had three sons and two daughters. The eldest of these sons was named John. He was groomed for life in the army, a career which he fulfilled though not very happily. The second son, Francis, was pledged to the church, while the third, Denys, was bound to the pursuits of scholarship and public life. All this was in accordance with the custom at the time whereby in larger families the parents typically exercised a great deal of influence over their sons.\n\nDenys was my father, and he studied law at the best known academies of France, namely at Bourges, Poitiers, and Toulouse. He was under no compulsion in this study but discharged it carelessly nevertheless, through the fault of others. For because he was a man unmatched in courage, and physically very strong, and exceptionally fast with his fists, there was hardly any tussle among the boys that he did not get foolishly dragged into, even against his will. Now one group would enlist him as an ally for their battles on their side, then another group for their side. I often heard my father complaining bitterly about this particular injustice. From that time there is a letter from my grandfather which he sent to his son Denys with a sober and yet witty salutation, namely, “To my dear son Denys, whom I sent there to study.” He wrote this for Denys instead of what others commonly write, namely, “to him as he studies there.” Finally, my father earned at Toulouse the degree of Licentiate (as they call it), and when he had returned home he was drawn quite to his surprise, though by the most remarkable providence of God, into public service. I will explain the details of this event as an indicator of that divine providence which by this development equally disturbed my father and greatly exalted him.\n\nThere is in one of the outlying towns of Vayrac (this is the name of the second-most famous town near Bourges for production of wine and wool) a Franciscan monastery. The abbot over this monastery was a certain friar named Hémard (as he is commonly called) Toussaint, a man known for the great foulness of his speech and body, and most eager to do anything disgraceful. That man had not shrunk from even publicly haranguing Marguerite the Queen of Navarre and sister of Francis the First (she was also Duchess of Bourges) on the ground that she was a Lutheran, that she deserved to be wrapped up in a sack and cast into the sewer, and other things of that sort. When this Hémard continued making these charges for quite some time, although he had been warned not to, the local authority was unable in good conscience to cover up the affair. An investigation was opened, witnesses were adduced, and the matter was referred to the king. At this point the king was offended and directly required the very punishment that Hémard had prescribed for the king’s sister. The case was sent back to the local magistrate for the offender to be arrested and brought to the king as soon as possible.\n\nThen the queen intervened with her mercy and succeeded in having a less severe punishment leveled against the man who had treated her so abysmally. But no one was found who would dare to take the man from the royal locked garrison to the king, evidently because the townspeople were madly approving the monk’s folly. And thus in vain was the magistrate repeatedly summoned by the king’s attendants and with weighty entreaties. My father, who by chance at that time was newly arrived from the schools, was neither inexperienced in arms nor unaware of the things that had taken place before he arrived. He boldly promised the king’s attendants that he himself would take care of the matter if an order of the king could be sent to him by name. When this matter was conveyed to the king, a decree was put into effect for this purpose, and it was sent to Vayrac. When it reached the monastery, the Franciscan priest was arrested, and with difficulty he was extracted from the clutches of the raging townspeople (who were stirring up mob action and a hail of stones at the worst possible time), so that he could serve two years, by the king’s decree, on a prison barge on the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nSo this was the first official act that brought my father into the good graces of the king and his sister the queen. But among that untutored rabble and the Franciscan order, he earned unending animosity. They brought forward against my father crass slanders, threats, false charges, harassments, slights, and, finally, cruel death. It would certainly have been more profitable and useful, when about to embark upon a public career and involvement in the care of the state if, after so bold an undertaking, he had looked to his own interests by an honorable and wise change of residence. This sort of plan the Queen of Navarre and some of the leading citizens often desired, so that my father might provide service to the commonwealth somewhere else.\n\nHe married Jacoba Hugalda, a very upright young woman from a devout family and with a character completely dedicated to tranquility. With her he fathered nine children, four sons and five daughters. When only two of the daughters had been born, Father harvested the bitterest fruit of that bold deed of his. For he was attacked partly by the craft of the Franciscans, and partly by the recklessness and extreme hatred of the common people, and brought up on the charge of Lutheran religion (as they designated it at the time). The maid who had served our home was enlisted for the plot. She gave false testimony, as I have often heard my mother affirm, that she had witnessed Father consuming meat on days that it was forbidden. My father went into exile at this charge, lest he be compelled to plead his case from prison in the midst of so many hostile townspeople. He was supported by the Queen of Navarre herself for almost an entire year. Meanwhile there was a general rush on my father’s property, and certain men, especially from his relatives, stole from him on the pretext of reclaiming the money that they had supplied to him as he fled. In this they acted with the greatest diligence, looking much to their own advantage and not at all to my father’s. While he was absent, the Franciscan monk returned from the sea after his two-year term was completed. He was received into town with the heartiest applause and welcome of his order and of the common people. A crowd gathered together at the doors of our family home. My mother, pregnant at the time, was terrified and overcome, especially when many began to shout into her ears, as though in competition, “Our sainted hero has returned, has returned! The devil has carried off the wicked ones who arose in opposition.” This was the gist of their shouting. A second hardship arose at that time which grieved my mother in no small measure. For my exiled fath"
