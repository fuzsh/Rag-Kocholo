Famed pianist Liberace was at the baths that night, as he often was, and immediately took her under his wing (and towel). Her rise in opera mounted as she performed throughout the United States, South America, Great Britain, Spain, The Netherlands, West Berlin, and the Eastern-Bloc (when those things existed); And, with such legendary artists as soprano Vera Galupe-Borszkh, and tenor Juan Pondalinguini. However, fame was cut short when Amanda met and married her first husband, millionaire Paulo Ferdinand Castrato, who, soon after their honeymoon, was arrested as one of Columbia’s most notorious drug lords. After his untimely (and purely accidental) death, Amanda withdrew from performing in an effort to “let the dust settle.” Returning to the stage, after the Castrato years, Amanda decimated both her completion and her audience, in roles like Aida, Madama Butterfly, and Lakme with her own eunuch vocal style and dramatic flair. However, several subsequent marriages (and children) proved too much for Amanda, who once again withdrew from public life in 2002, making her one of “Time-less” magazine’s “Most Notorious people” of the century. Now, (legally allowed to return to stage) after a 20-year retirement/rest cure, (and rumored incarceration) Amanda is considered the world’s most beloved “Spento” soprano, (known on Broadway as a “belter.”) Touring the world with her partner in music, Maestro Marco Carouomo, she continues to transport audiences and transcend taste with her eunuch interpretations of Broadway, Great American Songbook, Popular favorites and opera.\n\nYvonne Gonzales Redman\n\nYvonne Gonzales Redman is an Associate Professor of Voice at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

Her proprietary, technology-driven educational tools, including the “Matrix of Intersectionality©” and “impact©,” form the foundation of her work. While she initially created these tools for her own classroom, their popularity soared as their effectiveness became widely recognized, leading to increased demand.
