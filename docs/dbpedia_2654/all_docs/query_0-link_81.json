        "text": "Jay Scheib\n\nFebruary 1, 2022 | 2:45 PM | ZOOM\n\nInternationally known for genre-defying works of daring physicality and the integration of new (and used) technologies in live performance, Scheib’s upcoming productions include Richard Wagner’s Parsifal, for the Bayreuth Festspiele and the Philip K. Dick inspired opera by Tod Machover, Valis, to premiere at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Named Best New York Theater Director by Time Out New York in 2009, and one of the 25 theater artists shaping the next 25 years of American theater by American Theater Magazine, Scheib is a recipient of the MIT Edgerton Award, The Richard Sherwood Award, a National Endowment for the Arts/TCG fellowship, an OBIE Award for Best Direction, and the prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship. He is a Professor for Music and Theater Arts at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he teaches in the Program for Theater Arts — classes include: Motion Theater, Live Cinema Performance, Directing, Performance Media, and Performance Scenography.\n\nRecent productions include the VR staging Sei Siegfried, as part of Der Ring des Nibelungen — Diskurs Ring 20.21 for the Bayreuth Festspiele. Other productions include the West End musical Bat Out of Hell after the album by Jim Steinman & Meat Loaf at the London Coliseum/English National Opera and a new opera based on Ingmar Bergman’s film Persona, which was produced by Beth Morrison Projects and premiered at National Sawdust in New York, followed by performances at the Isabella Stuart Gardner Museum in Boston and with LA Opera at RedCat in 2017. Scheib's recent mashup of Heiner Goebbels' Surrogate Cities with Richard Wagner's Götterdämmerung played the Wuppertal Opera House in Germany. Other recent works include the world premiere opera by Israeli composer Na’ama Zisser, Mamzer/Bastard at the Royal Opera House in London/Hackney Empire, the multi-platform Platonov, or the Disinherited, which premiered as part of the Without Walls Festival at La Jolla Playhouse, followed by performances at The Kitchen in New York City. Conceived as a 100 minute single-take feature film, Scheib’s adaptation of Chekhov’s play was broadcast live from The Kitchen to the AMC Empire 25 Cinema in Times Square and to BAM Rose Cinema in Brooklyn.\n\nYet more recent works include Luigi Nono’s No hay camino hay que caminar as ouverture to Monteverdi’s Il Ritorno d’Ulisse under the title Odyssee at the Staatstheater Darmstadt in Germany.

Other recent works for the stage have included a new contemporary ballet collaboration with choreographer Yin Mei and the Hong Kong Dance Company titled Seven Sages, which premiered in March 2012; a new staging of Fassbinder’s controversial play Garbage, the City and Death with the Norwegian Theater Academy in Oslo, Norway; and Scheib’s own original Fassbinder adaptation World of Wires, which premiered at The Kitchen in New York City, for which Scheib was awarded a 2012 OBIE Award for Best Direction. Subsequent performances of World of Wires included presentations in Krakow, Poland, as part of the KRT Festival, the Institute of Contemporary Art/Boston, Lieu Unique in Nantes, and Festival d’Automne in Paris, France, at the Maison des Arts Cretéil (MAC). Also having toured in France and Boston was the recent adaptation of Samuel R. Delany’s novel Dhalgren, titled Bellona, Destroyer of Cities, which played the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston and the MAC Exit Festival in Paris, following its New York City premiere at the Kitchen. As a frequent director of operas and works for music theater, Scheib staged Evan Ziporyn’s A House in Bali, as part of BAM’s Next Wave Festival 2010; Beethoven’s Fidelio at the Saarländisches Staatstheater; and an original collaboration with punk band World Inferno Friendship Society titled Addicted to Bad Ideas, which toured eight cities internationally.\n\nwww.jayscheib.org\n\nUrs Schönebaum\n\nOctober 15, 2020 | 11:30 AM – 12:30 PM\n\nUrs Schönebaum Studied photography in Munich.
