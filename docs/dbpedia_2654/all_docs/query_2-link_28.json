During the StratoClim Geophysica campaign, air with total water mixing ratios up to 200âppmv and ozone up to 250âppbv was observed within the Asian summer monsoon anticyclone up to 1.7âkm above the local cold-point tropopause (CPT). To investigate the temporal evolution of enhanced water vapor being transported into the stratosphere, we conduct forward trajectory simulations using both a microphysical and an idealized freeze-drying model. The models are initialized at the measurement locations and the evolution of water vapor and ice is compared with satellite observations of MLS and CALIPSO. Our results show that these extremely high water vapor values observed above the CPT are very likely to undergo significant further freeze-drying due to experiencing extremely cold temperatures while circulating in the anticyclonic âdehydration carouselâ. We also use the Lagrangian dry point (LDP) of the merged back-and-forward trajectories to reconstruct the water vapor fields. The results show that the extremely high water vapor mixed with the stratospheric air has a negligible impact on the overall water vapor budget. The LDP mixing ratios are a better proxy for the large-scale water vapor distributions in the stratosphere during this period.",

The transport of AMFs from the ABL to the polar vortex primarily occurs above 20 km and over timescales exceeding 2 years. Our analysis reveals a strong correlation between the polar pollutants and the AMFs from the ABL. About 20 % of SF6 in the polar stratosphere originates from the ABL.\n\nVariability and trends in the PV-gradient dynamical tropopause\n\nKatharina Turhal, Felix PlÃ¶ger, Jan Clemens, Thomas Birner, Franziska Weyland, Paul Konopka, and Peter Hoor\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-471,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-471, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe tropopause separates the troposphere, the lowest atmospheric layer where weather occurs, from the stratosphere. We computed the PV-gradient (PVG) tropopause, which is based on transport barriers between both layers. In 1980–2017, the PVG tropopause shifted poleward at lower altitudes and equatorward above. These shifts may signify height-dependent changes in atmospheric transport, influencing the distribution of pollutants and, e.g., greenhouse gases responsible for global warming.\n\nMoist bias in the Pacific upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) in climate models affects regional circulation patterns\n\nFelix Ploeger, Thomas Birner, Edward Charlesworth, Paul Konopka, and Rolf MÃ¼ller\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 2033–2043, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-2033-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-2033-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a novel mechanism of how regional anomalies in water vapour concentrations in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere impact regional atmospheric circulation systems. These impacts include a displaced upper-level Asian monsoon circulation and strengthened prevailing westerlies in the Pacific region. Current climate models have biases in simulating these regional water vapour anomalies and circulation impacts, but the biases can be avoided by improving the model transport.\n\nLagrangian transport simulations using the extreme convection parameterization: an assessment for the ECMWF reanalyses\n\nLars Hoffmann, Paul Konopka, Jan Clemens, and BÃ¤rbel Vogel\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 7589–7609, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-7589-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-7589-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAtmospheric convection plays a key role in tracer transport in the troposphere. Global meteorological forecasts and reanalyses typically have a coarse spatiotemporal resolution that does not adequately resolve the dynamics, transport, and mixing of air associated with storm systems or deep convection. We discuss the application of the extreme convection parameterization in a Lagrangian transport model to improve simulations of tracer transport from the boundary layer into the free troposphere.\n\nTropospheric transport and unresolved convection: numerical experiments with CLaMS 2.0/MESSy\n\nPaul Konopka, Mengchu Tao, Marc von Hobe, Lars Hoffmann, Corinna Kloss, Fabrizio Ravegnani, C. Michael Volk, Valentin Lauther, Andreas Zahn, Peter Hoor, and Felix Ploeger\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 7471–7487, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-7471-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-7471-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPure trajectory-based transport models driven by meteorology derived from reanalysis products (ERA5) take into account only the resolved, advective part of transport. That means neither mixing processes nor unresolved subgrid-scale advective processes like convection are included. The Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere (CLaMS) includes these processes. We show that isentropic mixing dominates unresolved transport. The second most important transport process is unresolved convection.\n\nCharacterization of transport from the Asian summer monsoon anticyclone into the UTLS via shedding of low potential vorticity cutoffs\n\nJan Clemens, Felix Ploeger, Paul Konopka, Raphael Portmann, Michael Sprenger, and Heini Wernli\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 3841–3860, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-3841-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-3841-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHighly polluted air flows from the surface to higher levels of the atmosphere during the Asian summer monsoon. At high levels, the air is trapped within eddies. Here, we study how air masses can leave the eddy within its cutoff, how they distribute, and how their chemical composition changes. We found evidence for transport from the eddy to higher latitudes over the North Pacific and even Alaska. During transport, trace gas concentrations within cutoffs changed gradually, showing steady mixing.\n\nA case study on the impact of severe convective storms on the water vapor mixing ratio in the lower mid-latitude stratosphere observed in 2019 over Europe\n\nDina Khordakova, Christian Rolf, Jens-Uwe GrooÃ, Rolf MÃ¼ller, Paul Konopka, Andreas Wieser, Martina KrÃ¤mer, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 1059–1079, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-1059-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-1059-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nExtreme storms transport humidity from the troposphere to the stratosphere. Here it has a strong impact on the climate. With ongoing global warming, we expect more storms and, hence, an enhancement of this effect. A case study was performed in order to measure the impact of the direct injection of water vapor into the lower stratosphere. The measurements displayed a significant transport of water vapor into the lower stratosphere, and this was supported by satellite and reanalysis data.\n\n3-D tomographic observations of Rossby wave breaking over the North Atlantic during the WISE aircraft campaign in 2017\n\nLukas Krasauskas, JÃ¶rn Ungermann, Peter Preusse, Felix Friedl-Vallon, Andreas Zahn, Helmut Ziereis, Christian Rolf, Felix PlÃ¶ger, Paul Konopka, BÃ¤rbel Vogel, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos.

Infrared limb sounding measurements of trace gases in the lower stratosphere, including high-resolution 3-D tomographic reconstruction, revealed complex spatial structures in stratospheric tracers near the polar jet related to previous RW breaking events. Backward-trajectory analysis and tracer correlations were used to study mixing and stratosphere–troposphere exchange.\n\nThe stratospheric BrewerâDobson circulation inferred from age of air in the ERA5 reanalysis\n\nFelix Ploeger, Mohamadou Diallo, Edward Charlesworth, Paul Konopka, Bernard Legras, Johannes C. Laube, Jens-Uwe GrooÃ, Gebhard GÃ¼nther, Andreas Engel, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 8393–8412, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-8393-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-8393-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigate the global stratospheric circulation (Brewer–Dobson circulation) in the new ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis based on age of air simulations, and we compare it to results from the preceding ERA-Interim reanalysis. Our results show a slower stratospheric circulation and higher age for ERA5. The age of air trend in ERA5 over the 1989–2018 period is negative throughout the stratosphere, related to multi-annual variability and a potential contribution from changes in the reanalysis system.\n\nAsymmetry and pathways of inter-hemispheric transport in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere\n\nXiaolu Yan, Paul Konopka, Marius Hauck, AurÃ©lien Podglajen, and Felix Ploeger\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 6627–6645, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-6627-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-6627-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nInter-hemispheric transport is important for understanding atmospheric tracers because of the asymmetry in emissions between the Southern Hemisphere (SH) and Northern Hemisphere (NH). This study finds that the air masses from the NH extratropics to the atmosphere are about 5 times larger than those from the SH extratropics. The interplay between the Asian summer monsoon and westerly ducts triggers the cross-Equator transport from the NH to the SH in boreal summer and fall.\n\nUpward transport into and within the Asian monsoon anticyclone as inferred from StratoClim trace gas observations\n\nMarc von Hobe, Felix Ploeger, Paul Konopka, Corinna Kloss, Alexey Ulanowski, Vladimir Yushkov, Fabrizio Ravegnani, C. Michael Volk, Laura L. Pan, Shawn B. Honomichl, Simone Tilmes, Douglas E. Kinnison, Rolando R. Garcia, and Jonathon S. Wright\n\nAtmos. Chem.

To test and amend our picture of ASM vertical transport, we analyse distributions of airborne trace gas observations up to 20 km altitude near the main ASM vertical conduit south of the Himalayas. We also show that a new high-resolution version of the global chemistry climate model WACCM is able to reproduce the observations well.\n\nLong-term variations in ozone levels in the troposphere and lower stratosphere over Beijing: observations and model simulations\n\nYuli Zhang, Mengchu Tao, Jinqiang Zhang, Yi Liu, Hongbin Chen, Zhaonan Cai, and Paul Konopka\n\nAtmos.

Wright, Xiaoyi Sun, Paul Konopka, Kirstin KrÃ¼ger, Bernard Legras, Andrea M. Molod, Susann Tegtmeier, Guang J. Zhang, and Xi Zhao\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 8989–9030, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-8989-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-8989-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHigh clouds are influential in tropical climate. Although reanalysis cloud fields are essentially model products, they are indirectly constrained by observations and offer global coverage with direct links to advanced water and energy cycle metrics, giving them many useful applications. We describe how high cloud fields are generated in reanalyses, assess their realism and reliability in the tropics, and evaluate how differences in these fields affect other aspects of the reanalysis state.\n\nThe efficiency of transport into the stratosphere via the Asian and North American summer monsoon circulations\n\nXiaolu Yan, Paul Konopka, Felix Ploeger, AurÃ©lien Podglajen, Jonathon S. Wright, Rolf MÃ¼ller, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 15629–15649, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-15629-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-15629-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Asian and North American summer monsoons (ASM and NASM) have considerable influence on stratospheric chemistry and physics. More air mass is transported from the monsoon regions to the tropical stratosphere when the tracers are released clearly below the tropopause than when they are released close to the tropopause. Results for different altitudes of air origin reveal two transport pathways (monsoon and tropical) from the upper troposphere over the monsoon regions to the tropical pipe.\n\nTropospheric mixing and parametrization of unresolved convective updrafts as implemented in the Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere (CLaMS v2.0)\n\nPaul Konopka, Mengchu Tao, Felix Ploeger, Mohamadou Diallo, and Martin Riese\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 12, 2441–2462, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-2441-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-2441-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCLaMS is a Lagrangian transport model suitable for simulating atmospheric transport and chemistry. The novel approach of CLaMS is its description of atmospheric mixing. Whereas the common approach is to minimize the numerical diffusion ever present in the modeling of transport, CLaMS is a first attempt to apply this undesirable disturbing effect to parametrize the true physical mixing. In this paper, we show how this concept works both in the stratosphere and in the troposphere.\n\nMultitimescale variations in modeled stratospheric water vapor derived from three modern reanalysis products\n\nMengchu Tao, Paul Konopka, Felix Ploeger, Xiaolu Yan, Jonathon S. Wright, Mohamadou Diallo, Stephan Fueglistaler, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 6509–6534, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-6509-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-6509-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper examines the annual and interannual variations as well as long-term trend of modeled stratospheric water vapor with a Lagrangian chemical transport model driven by ERA-I, MERRA-2 and JRA-55. We find reasonable consistency among the annual cycle, QBO and the variabilities induced by ENSO and volcanic aerosols. The main discrepancies are linked to the differences in reanalysis upwelling rates in the lower stratosphere. The trends are sensitive to the reanalyses that drives the model.\n\nHow robust are stratospheric age of air trends from different reanalyses?\n\nFelix Ploeger, Bernard Legras, Edward Charlesworth, Xiaolu Yan, Mohamadou Diallo, Paul Konopka, Thomas Birner, Mengchu Tao, Andreas Engel, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 6085–6105, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-6085-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-6085-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe analyse the change in the circulation of the middle atmosphere based on current generation meteorological reanalysis data sets. We find that long-term changes from 1989 to 2015 are similar for the chosen reanalyses, mainly resembling the forced response in climate model simulations to climate change. For shorter periods circulation changes are less robust, and the representation of decadal variability appears to be a major uncertainty for modelling the circulation of the middle atmosphere.\n\nFrom ERA-Interim to ERA5: the considerable impact of ECMWF's next-generation reanalysis on Lagrangian transport simulations\n\nLars Hoffmann, Gebhard GÃ¼nther, Dan Li, Olaf Stein, Xue Wu, Sabine Griessbach, Yi Heng, Paul Konopka, Rolf MÃ¼ller, BÃ¤rbel Vogel, and Jonathon S. Wright\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 3097–3124, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-3097-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-3097-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nECMWF's new ERA5 reanalysis provides higher spatiotemporal resolution, yielding an improved representation of meso- and synoptic-scale features of the atmosphere. We assessed the impact of this challenging new data set on Lagrangian trajectory calculations for the free troposphere and stratosphere. Key findings are considerable transport deviations between the ERA5 and ERA-Interim simulations as well as significantly improved conservation of potential temperature in the stratosphere for ERA5.\n\nStructural changes in the shallow and transition branch of the BrewerâDobson circulation induced by El NiÃ±o\n\nMohamadou Diallo, Paul Konopka, Michelle L. Santee, Rolf MÃ¼ller, Mengchu Tao, Kaley A. Walker, Bernard Legras, Martin Riese, Manfred Ern, and Felix Ploeger\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 425–446, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-425-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-425-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper assesses the structural changes in the shallow and transition branches of the BDC induced by El Nino using the Lagrangian model simulations driven by ERAi and JRA-55 combined with MLS observations. We found a clear evidence of a weakening of the transition branch due to an upward shift in the dissipation height of the planetary and gravity waves and a strengthening of the shallow branch due to enhanced GW breaking in the tropics–subtropics and PW breaking at high latitudes.\n\nResponse of stratospheric water vapor and ozone to the unusual timing of El NiÃ±o and the QBO disruption in 2015â2016\n\nMohamadou Diallo, Martin Riese, Thomas Birner, Paul Konopka, Rolf MÃ¼ller, Michaela I. Hegglin, Michelle L. Santee, Mark Baldwin, Bernard Legras, and Felix Ploeger\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 13055–13073, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-13055-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-13055-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe unprecedented timing of an El NiÃ±o event aligned with the disrupted QBO in 2015–2016 caused a perturbation to the stratospheric circulation, affecting trace gases. This paper resolves the puzzling response of the lower stratospheric water vapor by showing that the QBO disruption reversed the lower stratosphere moistening triggered by the alignment of the El NiÃ±o event with a westerly QBO in early boreal winter.\n\nSensitivities of modelled water vapour in the lower stratosphere: temperature uncertainty, effects of horizontal transport and small-scale mixing\n\nLiubov Poshyvailo, Rolf MÃ¼ller, Paul Konopka, Gebhard GÃ¼nther, Martin Riese, AurÃ©lien Podglajen, and Felix Ploeger\n\nAtmos.

We investigate the effects of current uncertainties in tropopause temperature, horizontal transport and small-scale mixing on simulated H2O, using the Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere. Our sensitivity studies provide new insights into the leading processes controlling stratospheric H2O, important for assessing and improving climate model projections.\n\nEl NiÃ±o Southern Oscillation influence on the Asian summer monsoon anticyclone\n\nXiaolu Yan, Paul Konopka, Felix Ploeger, Mengchu Tao, Rolf MÃ¼ller, Michelle L. Santee, Jianchun Bian, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Chem.

However, only a few works check the impact of ENSO at higher altitudes. Here, we analyse the impact of ENSO on the vicinity of the tropopause using reanalysis, satellite, in situ and model data. We find that ENSO shows the strongest signal in winter, but its impact can last until early the next summer. The ENSO anomaly is insignificant in late summer. Our study can help to understand the atmosphere propagation after ENSO.\n\nIn situ temperature measurements in the upper troposphere and lowermost stratosphere from 2Â decades of IAGOS long-term routine observation\n\nFlorian Berkes, Patrick Neis, Martin G.

Here we investigated temperature trends over different regions within a climate-sensitive area of the atmosphere and demonstrated the value of the IAGOS temperature observations as an anchor point for the evaluation of reanalyses.\n\nQuantifying pollution transport from the Asian monsoon anticyclone into the lower stratosphere\n\nFelix Ploeger, Paul Konopka, Kaley Walker, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 17, 7055–7066, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-7055-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-7055-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPollution transport from the surface to the stratosphere within the Asian summer monsoon circulation may cause harmful effects on stratospheric chemistry and climate. We investigate air mass transport from the monsoon anticyclone into the stratosphere, combining model simulations with satellite trace gas measurements. We show evidence for two transport pathways from the monsoon: (i) into the tropical stratosphere and (ii) into the Northern Hemisphere extratropical lower stratosphere.\n\nKinematic and diabatic vertical velocity climatologies from aÂ chemistry climate model\n\nCharlotte Marinke Hoppe, Felix Ploeger, Paul Konopka, and Rolf MÃ¼ller\n\nAtmos.

This transport is characterized by deep convection and steady upwelling, combined with confinement inside a large-scale anticyclonic circulation in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. In this paper, we show that a barrier to horizontal transport in the monsoon can be determined from a local maximum in the gradient of potential vorticity.\n\nTransport of Antarctic stratospheric strongly dehydrated air into the troposphere observed during the HALO-ESMVal campaign 2012\n\nC.

We investigate how mixing triggered by this event correlates the wave forcing and how transport and mixing affect the composition of the whole stratosphere in the Northern Hemisphere, by using the tracer-tracer correlation technique.\n\nTropical troposphere to stratosphere transport of carbon monoxide and long-lived trace species in the Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere (CLaMS)\n\nR.

The model results using this version of CLaMS show a good representation of anomaly fields of CO, CH4, N2O, and CFC-11 in the lower stratosphere.

Biases in the IAGOS water vapor dataset are adjusted, based on the more accurate IAGOS-CARIBIC data. The resulting highly resolved H2O climatologies will contribute to a better understanding of the H2O variability in the UT/LS and its connection to various transport and mixing processes.\n\nAge of air from ACE-FTS measurements of sulfur hexafluoride\n\nLaura N.

This is the longest continuous, global, and vertically resolved age of air time series available to date. In this paper, we show that this dataset agrees well with age of air datasets based on measurements from other instruments. We also present trends in the midlatitude lower stratosphere that indicate changes in the global circulation that are predicted by climate models.\n\nHemispheric asymmetry in recent stratospheric age of air changes\n\nKimberlee Dube, Susann Tegtmeier, Felix Ploeger, and Kaley A.

This transport rate can be approximated using measurements of long-lived traces gases. We use observations and model results to derive anomalies and trends in the mean rate of stratospheric air transport. We find that air in the northern hemisphere aged by up to 0.3 years/decade relative to air in the southern hemisphere over 2004–2017.\n\nEvidence of a dual African and Australian biomass burning influence on the vertical distribution of aerosol and carbon monoxide over the southwest Indian Ocean basin in early 2020\n\nNelson BÃ¨gue, Alexandre Baron, GisÃ¨le Krysztofiak, GwenaÃ«l Berthet, Corinna Kloss, Fabrice JÃ©gou, Sergey Khaykin, Marion Ranaivombola, Tristan Millet, Thierry Portafaix, Valentin Duflot, Philippe Keckhut, HÃ©lÃ¨ne VÃ©rÃ¨mes, Guillaume Payen, Mahesh Kumar Sha, Pierre-FranÃ§ois Coheur, Cathy Clerbaux, MichaÃ«l Sicard, Tetsu Sakai, Richard Querel, Ben Liley, Dan Smale, Isamu Morino, Osamu Uchino, Tomohiro Nagai, Penny Smale, John Robinson, and Hassan Bencherif\n\nAtmos.

Numerical models indicated that the lower-stratospheric aerosol content was influenced by the intense and persistent stratospheric aerosol layer generated during the 2019–2020 extreme Australian bushfire events. Ground-based observations at Réunion confirmed the simultaneous presence of African and Australian aerosol layers.\n\nLong-term changes in the thermodynamic structure of the lowermost stratosphere inferred from ERA5 reanalysis data\n\nFranziska Weyland, Peter Hoor, Daniel Kunkel, Thomas Birner, Felix PlÃ¶ger, and Katharina Turhal\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1700,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1700, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe lowermost stratosphere (LMS) plays an important role for the Earth’s climate, containing strong gradients of ozone and water vapor. Our results indicate that the thermodynamic structure of the LMS has been changing between 1979–2019 in response to anthropogenic climate change and the recovery of stratospheric ozone, also hinting towards large scale circulation changes. We find that both the upper and lower LMS boundaries show an (upward) trend, which has implications on the LMS mass.\n\nComparison of scanning aerosol lidar and in situ measurements of aerosol physical properties and boundary layer heights\n\nHengheng Zhang, Christian Rolf, Ralf Tillmann, Christian Wesolek, Frank Gunther Wienhold, Thomas Leisner, and Harald Saathoff\n\nAerosol Research, 2, 135–151, https://doi.org/10.5194/ar-2-135-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/ar-2-135-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur study employs advanced tools, including scanning lidar, balloons, and UAVs, to explore aerosol particles in the atmosphere. The scanning lidar offers distinctive near-ground-level insights, enriching our comprehension of aerosol distribution from ground level to the free troposphere. This research provides valuable data for comparing remote sensing and in situ aerosol measurements, advancing our understanding of aerosol impacts on radiative transfer, clouds, and air quality.\n\nCombined assimilation of NOAA surface and MIPAS satellite observations to constrain the global budget of carbonyl sulfide\n\nJin Ma, Linda M.

We found reduced COS biosphere uptake from inversions and improved land and ocean separation using MIPAS satellite data assimilation. Further improvements are expected from better quantification of COS ocean and biosphere fluxes.\n\nQuasi-biennial oscillation modulation of stratospheric water vapour in the Asian monsoon\n\nCristina PeÃ±a-Ortiz, Nuria Pilar Plaza, David Gallego, and Felix Ploeger\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 5457–5478, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-5457-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-5457-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAlthough water vapour (H2O) in the lower stratosphere is only a few molecules among 1 million air molecules, atmospheric radiative forcing and surface temperature are sensitive to changes in its concentration. Monsoon regions play a key role in H2O transport and its concentration in the lower stratosphere. We show how the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) has a major impact on H2O over the Asian monsoon during August through changes in temperature caused by QBO modulation of tropical clouds.\n\nCharacterization of refractory aerosol particles collected in the tropical upper troposphereâlower stratosphere (UTLS) within the Asian tropopause aerosol layer (ATAL)\n\nMartin Ebert, Ralf Weigel, Stephan Weinbruch, Lisa Schneider, Konrad Kandler, Stefan Lauterbach, Franziska KÃ¶llner, Felix PlÃ¶ger, Gebhard GÃ¼nther, BÃ¤rbel Vogel, and Stephan Borrmann\n\nAtmos.

Refractory particles from seven different flights were characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM, TEM). The most abundant refractory particles are silicates and non-volatile organics. The most important sources are combustion processes at the ground and the agitation of soil material. During one flight, small cinnabar particles (HgS) were also detected.\n\nResponse of cirrus clouds to idealised perturbations from aviation\n\nElla Gilbert, Jhaswantsing Purseed, Yun Li, Martina KrÃ¤mer, Beatrice Altamura, and Nicolas Bellouin\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-821,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-821, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use a simple experiment to explore the non-CO2 impacts of aviation on climate, which are considerably larger than the impact of the sector’s carbon emissions alone. We show that the main effect of our experiments – which intend to mimic the effect of aircraft soot emissions reaching existing high-altitude cirrus clouds – is to extend cloud lifetime, thereby enhancing their effect on climate.\n\nTransport into the polar stratosphere from the Asian monsoon region\n\nXiaolu Yan, Paul Konopka, Felix Ploeger, and AurÃ©lien Podglajen\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-782,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-782, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur study finds that the air mass fractions (AMFs) from the Asian boundary layer (ABL) to the polar regions are about 1.5 times larger than those from the same latitude band in the Southern Hemisphere. The transport of AMFs from the ABL to the polar vortex primarily occurs above 20 km and over timescales exceeding 2 years. Our analysis reveals a strong correlation between the polar pollutants and the AMFs from the ABL. About 20 % of SF6 in the polar stratosphere originates from the ABL.\n\nVariability and trends in the PV-gradient dynamical tropopause\n\nKatharina Turhal, Felix PlÃ¶ger, Jan Clemens, Thomas Birner, Franziska Weyland, Paul Konopka, and Peter Hoor\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-471,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-471, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe tropopause separates the troposphere, the lowest atmospheric layer where weather occurs, from the stratosphere. We computed the PV-gradient (PVG) tropopause, which is based on transport barriers between both layers. In 1980–2017, the PVG tropopause shifted poleward at lower altitudes and equatorward above. These shifts may signify height-dependent changes in atmospheric transport, influencing the distribution of pollutants and, e.g., greenhouse gases responsible for global warming.\n\nMoist bias in the Pacific upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) in climate models affects regional circulation patterns\n\nFelix Ploeger, Thomas Birner, Edward Charlesworth, Paul Konopka, and Rolf MÃ¼ller\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 2033–2043, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-2033-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-2033-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a novel mechanism of how regional anomalies in water vapour concentrations in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere impact regional atmospheric circulation systems. These impacts include a displaced upper-level Asian monsoon circulation and strengthened prevailing westerlies in the Pacific region. Current climate models have biases in simulating these regional water vapour anomalies and circulation impacts, but the biases can be avoided by improving the model transport.\n\nDerivation of depolarization ratios of aerosol fluorescence and water vapor Raman backscatters from lidar measurements\n\nIgor Veselovskii, Qiaoyun Hu, Philippe Goloub, Thierry Podvin, William Boissiere, Mikhail Korenskiy, Nikita Kasianik, Sergey Khaykyn, and Robin Miri\n\nAtmos.

Results show the peak of fluorescence in the boundary layer is at 438 nm, while in the smoke layer it shifts to longer wavelengths. The fluorescence depolarization is 45 % to 55 %. The depolarization ratio of the water vapor channel is low (2 ± 0.5 %) in the absence of fluorescence and can be used to evaluate the contribution of fluorescence to water vapor signal.\n\nTechnical note: Bimodal parameterizations of in situ ice cloud particle size distributions\n\nIrene BartolomÃ© GarcÃ­a, Odran Sourdeval, Reinhold Spang, and Martina KrÃ¤mer\n\nAtmos.

The distribution of ice crystals is obtained from in situ measurements and used to create parameterizations that can be used when analyzing the remote-sensing data. Current parameterizations are based on data sets that do not include reliable measurements of small crystals, but in our study we use a data set that includes very small ice crystals to improve these parameterizations.\n\nA multi-scenario Lagrangian trajectory analysis to identify source regions of the Asian tropopause aerosol layer on the Indian subcontinent in August 2016\n\nJan Clemens, BÃ¤rbel Vogel, Lars Hoffmann, Sabine Griessbach, Nicole Thomas, Suvarna Fadnavis, Rolf MÃ¼ller, Thomas Peter, and Felix Ploeger\n\nAtmos.

Phys., 24, 763–787, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-763-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-763-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe source regions of the Asian tropopause aerosol layer (ATAL) are debated. We use balloon-borne measurements of the layer above Nainital (India) in August 2016 and atmospheric transport models to find ATAL source regions. Most air originated from the Tibetan plateau. However, the measured ATAL was stronger when more air originated from the Indo-Gangetic Plain and weaker when more air originated from the Pacific. Hence, the results indicate important anthropogenic contributions to the ATAL.\n\nEvaluation of vertical transport in ERA5 and ERA-Interim reanalysis using high-altitude aircraft measurements in the Asian summer monsoonÂ 2017\n\nBÃ¤rbel Vogel, C. Michael Volk, Johannes Wintel, Valentin Lauther, Jan Clemens, Jens-Uwe GrooÃ, Gebhard GÃ¼nther, Lars Hoffmann, Johannes C. Laube, Rolf MÃ¼ller, Felix Ploeger, and Fred Stroh\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 317–343, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-317-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-317-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOver the Indian subcontinent, polluted air is rapidly uplifted to higher altitudes during the Asian monsoon season. We present an assessment of vertical transport in this region using different wind data provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), as well as high-resolution aircraft measurements. In general, our findings confirm that the newest ECMWF reanalysis product, ERA5, yields a better representation of transport compared to the predecessor, ERA-Interim.\n\nLocal comparisons of tropospheric ozone: vertical soundings at two neighbouring stations in southern Bavaria\n\nThomas Trickl, Martin Adelwart, Dina Khordakova, Ludwig Ries, Christian Rolf, Michael Sprenger, Wolfgang Steinbrecht, and Hannes Vogelmann\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 16, 5145–5165, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-5145-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-5145-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTropospheric ozone have been measured for more than a century. Highly quantitative ozone measurements have been made at monitoring stations. However, deficits have been reported for vertical sounding systems. Here, we report a thorough intercomparison effort between a differential-absorption lidar system and two types of balloon-borne ozone sondes, also using ozone sensors at nearby mountain sites as references. The sondes agree very well with the lidar after offset corrections.\n\nA comparative analysis of in situ measurements of high-altitude cirrus in the tropics\n\nFrancesco Cairo, Martina KrÃ¤mer, Armin Afchine, Guido Di Donfrancesco, Luca Di Liberto, Sergey Khaykin, Lorenza Lucaferri, Valentin Mitev, Max Port, Christian Rolf, Marcel Snels, Nicole Spelten, Ralf Weigel, and Stephan Borrmann\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 16, 4899–4925, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-4899-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-4899-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCirrus clouds have been observed over the Himalayan region between 10 km and the tropopause at 17–18 km. Data from backscattersonde, hygrometers, and particle cloud spectrometers have been compared to assess their consistency. Empirical relationships between optical parameters accessible with remote sensing lidars and cloud microphysical parameters (such as ice water content, particle number and surface area density, and particle aspherical fraction) have been established.\n\nDifferences in microphysical properties of cirrus at high and mid-latitudes\n\nElena De La Torre Castro, Tina Jurkat-Witschas, Armin Afchine, Volker Grewe, Valerian Hahn, Simon Kirschler, Martina KrÃ¤mer, Johannes Lucke, Nicole Spelten, Heini Wernli, Martin ZÃ¶ger, and Christiane Voigt\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 13167–13189, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-13167-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-13167-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we show the differences in the microphysical properties between high-latitude (HL) cirrus and mid-latitude (ML) cirrus over the Arctic, North Atlantic, and central Europe during summer. The in situ measurements are combined with backward trajectories to investigate the influence of the region on cloud formation. We show that HL cirrus are characterized by a lower concentration of larger ice crystals when compared to ML cirrus.\n\nOn the pattern of interannual polar vortexâozone co-variability during northern hemispheric winter\n\nFrederik Harzer, Hella Garny, Felix Ploeger, Harald BÃ¶nisch, Peter Hoor, and Thomas Birner\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 10661–10675, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-10661-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-10661-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe study the statistical relation between year-by-year fluctuations in winter-mean ozone and the strength of the stratospheric polar vortex. In the latitude–pressure plane, regression analysis shows that anomalously weak polar vortex years are associated with three pronounced local ozone maxima over the polar cap relative to the winter climatology. These response maxima primarily reflect the non-trivial combination of different ozone transport processes with varying relative contributions.\n\nMeasurement report: Carbonyl sulfide production during dimethyl sulfide oxidation in the atmospheric simulation chamber SAPHIR\n\nMarc von Hobe, Domenico Taraborrelli, Sascha Alber, Birger Bohn, Hans-Peter Dorn, Hendrik Fuchs, Yun Li, Chenxi Qiu, Franz Rohrer, Roberto Sommariva, Fred Stroh, Zhaofeng Tan, Sergej Wedel, and Anna Novelli\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 10609–10623, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-10609-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-10609-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe trace gas carbonyl sulfide (OCS) transports sulfur from the troposphere to the stratosphere, where sulfate aerosols are formed that influence climate and stratospheric chemistry. An uncertain OCS source in the troposphere is chemical production form dimethyl sulfide (DMS), a gas released in large quantities from the oceans. We carried out experiments in a large atmospheric simulation chamber to further elucidate the chemical mechanism of OCS production from DMS.\n\nInvestigating an indirect aviation effect on mid-latitude cirrus clouds â linking lidar-derived optical properties to in situ measurements\n\nSilke GroÃ, Tina Jurkat-Witschas, Qiang Li, Martin Wirth, Benedikt Urbanek, Martina KrÃ¤mer, Ralf Weigel, and Christiane Voigt\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 8369–8381, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-8369-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-8369-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAviation-emitted aerosol can have an impact on cirrus clouds. We present optical and microphysical properties of mid-latitude cirrus clouds which were formed under the influence of aviation-emitted aerosol or which were formed under rather pristine conditions. We find that cirrus clouds affected by aviation-emitted aerosol show larger values of the particle linear depolarization ratio, larger mean effective ice particle diameters and decreased ice particle number concentrations.\n\nLagrangian transport simulations using the extreme convection parameterization: an assessment for the ECMWF reanalyses\n\nLars Hoffmann, Paul Konopka, Jan Clemens, and BÃ¤rbel Vogel\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 7589–7609, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-7589-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-7589-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAtmospheric convection plays a key role in tracer transport in the troposphere. Global meteorological forecasts and reanalyses typically have a coarse spatiotemporal resolution that does not adequately resolve the dynamics, transport, and mixing of air associated with storm systems or deep convection. We discuss the application of the extreme convection parameterization in a Lagrangian transport model to improve simulations of tracer transport from the boundary layer into the free troposphere.\n\nComment on âAn approach to sulfate geoengineering with surface emissions of carbonyl sulfideâ by Quaglia et al. (2022)\n\nMarc von Hobe, Christoph BrÃ¼hl, Sinikka T. Lennartz, Mary E. Whelan, and Aleya Kaushik\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 6591–6598, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-6591-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-6591-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCarbonyl sulfide plays a role in the climate system as a greenhouse gas and as the major non-volcanic precursor of particles reflecting sunlight. Here, we comment on a proposal to increase the number of particles by emitting extra carbonyl sulfide at the surface. We show that the balance between aerosol cooling and greenhouse gas warming may not be as favorable as suggested and also that much of the carbonyl sulfide emissions will actually be taken up by the biosphere and the oceans.\n\nRe-evaluating cloud chamber constraints on depositional ice growth in cirrus clouds â Part 1: Model description and sensitivity tests\n\nKara D. Lamb, Jerry Y. Harrington, Benjamin W. Clouser, Elisabeth J. Moyer, Laszlo Sarkozy, Volker Ebert, Ottmar MÃ¶hler, and Harald Saathoff\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 6043–6064, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-6043-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-6043-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study investigates how ice grows directly from vapor in cirrus clouds by comparing observations of populations of ice crystals growing in a cloud chamber against models developed in the context of single-crystal laboratory studies. We demonstrate that previous discrepancies between different experimental measurements do not necessarily point to different physical interpretations but are rather due to assumptions that were made in terms of how experiments were modeled in previous studies.\n\nThe Far-Infrared Radiation Mobile Observation System (FIRMOS) for spectral characterization of the atmospheric emission\n\nClaudio Belotti, Flavio Barbara, Marco Barucci, Giovanni Bianchini, Francesco D'Amato, Samuele Del Bianco, Gianluca Di Natale, Marco Gai, Alessio Montori, Filippo Pratesi, Markus Rettinger, Christian Rolf, Ralf Sussmann, Thomas Trickl, Silvia Viciani, Hannes Vogelmann, and Luca Palchetti\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 16, 2511–2529, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-2511-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-2511-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFIRMOS (Far-Infrared Radiation Mobile Observation System) is a spectroradiometer measuring in the far-infrared, developed to support the preparation of the FORUM (Far-infrared Outgoing Radiation Understanding and Monitoring) satellite mission. In this paper, we describe the instrument, its data products, and the results of the comparison with a suite of observations made from a high-altitude site during a field campaign, in winter 2018–2019.\n\nCharacteristics of supersaturation in midlatitude cirrus clouds and their adjacent cloud-free air\n\nGeorgios Dekoutsidis, Silke GroÃ, Martin Wirth, Martina KrÃ¤mer, and Christian Rolf\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 3103–3117, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-3103-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-3103-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCirrus clouds affect Earth's atmosphere, deeming our study important. Here we use water vapor measurements by lidar and study the relative humidity (RHi) within and around midlatitude cirrus clouds. We find high supersaturations in the cloud-free air and within the clouds, especially near the cloud top. We study two cloud types with different formation processes. Finally, we conclude that the shape of the distribution of RHi can be used as an indicator of different cloud evolutionary stages.\n\nValidation of Aeolus wind profiles using ground-based lidar and radiosonde observations at RÃ©union island and the Observatoire de Haute-Provence\n\nMathieu Ratynski, Sergey Khaykin, Alain Hauchecorne, Robin Wing, Jean-Pierre Cammas, Yann Hello, and Philippe Keckhut\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 16, 997–1016, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-997-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-997-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAeolus is the first spaceborne wind lidar providing global wind measurements since 2018. This study offers a comprehensive analysis of Aeolus instrument performance, using ground-based wind lidars and meteorological radiosondes, at tropical and mid-latitudes sites. The analysis allows assessing the long-term evolution of the satellite's performance for more than 3 years. The results will help further elaborate the understanding of the error sources and the behavior of the Doppler wind lidar.\n\nSensitivity of convectively driven tropical tropopauseÂ cirrus properties to ice habits in high-resolution simulations\n\nFayÃ§al Lamraoui, Martina KrÃ¤mer, Armin Afchine, Adam B. Sokol, Sergey Khaykin, Apoorva Pandey, and Zhiming Kuang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 2393–2419, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-2393-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-2393-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCirrus in the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) can play a key role in vertical transport. We investigate the role of different cloud regimes and the associated ice habits in regulating the properties of the TTL. We use high-resolution numerical experiments at the scales of large-eddy simulations (LESs) and aircraft measurements. We found that LES-scale parameterizations that predict ice shape are crucial for an accurate representation of TTL cirrus and thus the associated (de)hydration process.\n\nUpper-tropospheric slightly ice-subsaturated regions: frequency of occurrence and statistical evidence for the appearance of contrail cirrus\n\nYun Li, Christoph Mahnke, Susanne Rohs, Ulrich Bundke, Nicole Spelten, Georgios Dekoutsidis, Silke GroÃ, Christiane Voigt, Ulrich Schumann, Andreas Petzold, and Martina KrÃ¤mer\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 2251–2271, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-2251-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-2251-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe radiative effect of aviation-induced cirrus is closely related to ambient conditions and its microphysical properties. Our study investigated the occurrence of contrail and natural cirrus measured above central Europe in spring 2014. It finds that contrail cirrus appears frequently in the pressure range 200 to 245 hPa and occurs more often in slightly ice-subsaturated environments than expected. Avoiding slightly ice-subsaturated regions by aviation might help mitigate contrail cirrus.\n\nInvestigating the radiative effect of Arctic cirrus measured in situ during the winter 2015â2016\n\nAndreas Marsing, Ralf MeerkÃ¶tter, Romy Heller, Stefan Kaufmann, Tina Jurkat-Witschas, Martina KrÃ¤mer, Christian Rolf, and Christiane Voigt\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 587–609, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-587-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-587-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe employ highly resolved aircraft measurements of profiles of the ice water content (IWC) in Arctic cirrus clouds in winter and spring, when solar irradiation is low. Using radiation transfer calculations, we assess the cloud radiative effect over different surfaces like snow or ocean. The variability in the IWC of the clouds affects their overall radiative effect and drives internal processes. This helps understand the role of cirrus in a rapidly changing Arctic environment.\n\nThe evolution and dynamics of the Hunga TongaâHunga Ha'apai sulfate aerosol plume in the stratosphere\n\nBernard Legras, Clair Duchamp, Pasquale Sellitto, AurÃ©lien Podglajen, Elisa Carboni, Richard Siddans, Jens-Uwe GrooÃ, Sergey Khaykin, and Felix Ploeger\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 14957–14970, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-14957-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-14957-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe long-duration atmospheric impact of the Tonga eruption in January 2022 is a plume of water and sulfate aerosols in the stratosphere that persisted for more than 6 months. We study this evolution using several satellite instruments and analyse the unusual behaviour of this plume as sulfates and water first moved down rapidly and then separated into two layers. We also report the self-organization in compact and long-lived patches.\n\nStratospheric water vapour and ozone response to the quasi-biennial oscillation disruptions in 2016 and 2020\n\nMohamadou A. Diallo, Felix Ploeger, Michaela I. Hegglin, Manfred Ern, Jens-Uwe GrooÃ, Sergey Khaykin, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 14303–14321, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-14303-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-14303-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe quasi-biennial oacillation disruption events in both 2016 and 2020 decreased lower-stratospheric water vapour and ozone. Differences in the strength and depth of the anomalous lower-stratospheric circulation and ozone are due to differences in tropical upwelling and cold-point temperature induced by lower-stratospheric planetary and gravity wave breaking. The differences in water vapour are due to higher cold-point temperature in 2020 induced by Australian wildfire.\n\nChemical analysis of the Asian tropopause aerosol layer (ATAL) with emphasis on secondary aerosol particles using aircraft-based in situ aerosol mass spectrometry\n\nOliver Appel, Franziska KÃ¶llner, Antonis Dragoneas, Andreas HÃ¼nig, Sergej Molleker, Hans Schlager, Christoph Mahnke, Ralf Weigel, Max Port, Christiane Schulz, Frank Drewnick, BÃ¤rbel Vogel, Fred Stroh, and Stephan Borrmann\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 13607–13630, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-13607-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-13607-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper clarifies the chemical composition of the Asian tropopause aerosol layer (ATAL) by means of airborne in situ aerosol mass spectrometry (AMS). Ammonium nitrate and organics are found to significantly contribute to the particle layer, while sulfate does not show a layered structure. An analysis of the single-particle mass spectra suggests that secondary particle formation and subsequent growth dominate the particle composition, rather than condensation on pre-existing primary particles.\n\nTropospheric transport and unresolved convection: numerical experiments with CLaMS 2.0/MESSy\n\nPaul Konopka, Mengchu Tao, Marc von Hobe, Lars Hoffmann, Corinna Kloss, Fabrizio Ravegnani, C. Michael Volk, Valentin Lauther, Andreas Zahn, Peter Hoor, and Felix Ploeger\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 7471–7487, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-7471-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-7471-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPure trajectory-based transport models driven by meteorology derived from reanalysis products (ERA5) take into account only the resolved, advective part of transport. That means neither mixing processes nor unresolved subgrid-scale advective processes like convection are included. The Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere (CLaMS) includes these processes. We show that isentropic mixing dominates unresolved transport. The second most important transport process is unresolved convection.\n\nIntercomparison of upper tropospheric and lower stratospheric water vapor measurements over the Asian Summer Monsoon during the StratoClim campaign\n\nClare E. Singer, Benjamin W. Clouser, Sergey M. Khaykin, Martina KrÃ¤mer, Francesco Cairo, Thomas Peter, Alexey Lykov, Christian Rolf, Nicole Spelten, Armin Afchine, Simone Brunamonti, and Elisabeth J. Moyer\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 4767–4783, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-4767-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-4767-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn situ measurements of water vapor in the upper troposphere are necessary to study cloud formation and hydration of the stratosphere but challenging due to cold–dry conditions. We compare measurements from three water vapor instruments from the StratoClim campaign in 2017. In clear sky (clouds), point-by-point differences were <1.5Â±8 % (<1Â±8 %). This excellent agreement allows detection of fine-scale structures required to understand the impact of convection on stratospheric water vapor.\n\nHow can BrewerâDobson circulation trends be estimated from changes in stratospheric water vapour and methane?\n\nLiubov Poshyvailo-Strube, Rolf MÃ¼ller, Stephan Fueglistaler, Michaela I. Hegglin, Johannes C. Laube, C. Michael Volk, and Felix Ploeger\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 9895–9914, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-9895-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-9895-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBrewer–Dobson circulation (BDC) controls the composition of the stratosphere, which in turn affects radiation and climate. As the BDC cannot be measured directly, it is necessary to infer its strength and trends indirectly. In this study, we test in the model world different methods for estimating the mean age of air trends based on a combination of stratospheric water vapour and methane data. We also provide simple practical advice of a more reliable estimation of the mean age of air trends.\n\nTropospheric warming over the northern Indian Ocean caused by South Asian anthropogenic aerosols: possible impact on the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere\n\nSuvarna Fadnavis, Prashant Chavan, Akash Joshi, Sunil M. Sonbawne, Asutosh Acharya, Panuganti C. S. Devara, Alexandru Rap, Felix Ploeger, and Rolf MÃ¼ller\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 7179–7191, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-7179-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-7179-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe show that large amounts of anthropogenic aerosols are transported from South Asia to the northern Indian Ocean. These aerosols are then lifted into the UTLS by the ascending branch of the Hadley circulation. They are further transported to the Southern Hemisphere and downward via westerly ducts over the tropical Atlantic and Pacific. These aerosols increase tropospheric heating, resulting in an increase in water vapor, which is then transported to the UTLS.\n\nFirst implementation of a new cross-disciplinary observation strategy for heavy precipitation events from formation to flooding\n\nAndreas Wieser, Andreas GÃ¼ntner, Peter Dietrich, Jan Handwerker, Dina Khordakova, Uta KÃ¶del, Martin Kohler, Hannes Mollenhauer, Bernhard MÃ¼hr, Erik Nixdorf, Marvin Reich, Christian Rolf, Martin SchrÃ¶n, Claudia SchÃ¼tze, and Ute Weber\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2022-131,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2022-131, 2022\n\nPreprint withdrawn\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present an event-triggered observation concept which covers the entire process chain from heavy precipitation to flooding at the catchment scale. It combines flexible and mobile observing systems out of the fields of meteorology, hydrology and geophysics with stationary networks to capture atmospheric transport processes, heterogeneous precipitation patterns, land surface and subsurface storage processes, and runoff dynamics.\n\nHemispheric asymmetries in recent changes in the stratospheric circulation\n\nFelix Ploeger and Hella Garny\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 5559–5576, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-5559-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-5559-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigate hemispheric asymmetries in stratospheric circulation changes in the last 2 decades in model simulations and atmospheric observations. We find that observed trace gas changes can be explained by a structural circulation change related to a deepening circulation in the Northern Hemisphere relative to the Southern Hemisphere. As this asymmetric signal is small compared to internal variability observed circulation trends over the recent past are not in contradiction to climate models.\n\nProcess-based microphysical characterization of a strong mid-latitude convective system using aircraft in situ cloud measurements\n\nMireia Papke Chica, Valerian Hahn, Tiziana Braeuer, Elena de la Torre Castro, Florian Ewald, Mathias Gergely, Simon Kirschler, Luca Bugliaro Goggia, Stefanie Knobloch, Martina Kraemer, Johannes Lucke, Johanna Mayer, Raphael Maerkl, Manuel Moser, Laura Tomsche, Tina Jurkat-Witschas, Martin Zoeger, Christian von Savigny, and Christiane Voigt\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2022-255,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2022-255, 2022\n\nPreprint withdrawn\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe mixed-phase temperature regime in convective clouds challenges our understanding of microphysical and radiative cloud properties. We provide a rare and unique dataset of aircraft in situ measurements in a strong mid-latitude convective system. We find that mechanisms initiating ice nucleation and growth strongly depend on temperature, relative humidity, and vertical velocity and variate within the measured system, resulting in altitude dependent changes of the cloud liquid and ice fraction.\n\nCharacterization of transport from the Asian summer monsoon anticyclone into the UTLS via shedding of low potential vorticity cutoffs\n\nJan Clemens, Felix Ploeger, Paul Konopka, Raphael Portmann, Michael Sprenger, and Heini Wernli\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 3841–3860, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-3841-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-3841-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHighly polluted air flows from the surface to higher levels of the atmosphere during the Asian summer monsoon. At high levels, the air is trapped within eddies. Here, we study how air masses can leave the eddy within its cutoff, how they distribute, and how their chemical composition changes. We found evidence for transport from the eddy to higher latitudes over the North Pacific and even Alaska. During transport, trace gas concentrations within cutoffs changed gradually, showing steady mixing.\n\nRedistribution of total reactive nitrogen in the lowermost Arctic stratosphere during the cold winter 2015/2016\n\nHelmut Ziereis, Peter Hoor, Jens-Uwe GrooÃ, Andreas Zahn, Greta Stratmann, Paul Stock, Michael Lichtenstern, Jens Krause, Vera Bense, Armin Afchine, Christian Rolf, Wolfgang Woiwode, Marleen Braun, JÃ¶rn Ungermann, Andreas Marsing, Christiane Voigt, Andreas Engel, BjÃ¶rn-Martin Sinnhuber, and Hermann Oelhaf\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 3631–3654, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-3631-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-3631-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAirborne observations were conducted in the lowermost Arctic stratosphere during the winter of 2015/2016. The observed distribution of reactive nitrogen shows clear indications of nitrification in mid-winter and denitrification in late winter. This was caused by the formation of polar stratospheric cloud particles, which were observed during several flights. The sedimentation and evaporation of these particles and the descent of air masses cause a redistribution of reactive nitrogen.\n\nPersistence of moist plumes from overshooting convection in the Asian monsoon anticyclone\n\nSergey M. Khaykin, Elizabeth Moyer, Martina KrÃ¤mer, Benjamin Clouser, Silvia Bucci, Bernard Legras, Alexey Lykov, Armin Afchine, Francesco Cairo, Ivan Formanyuk, Valentin Mitev, Renaud Matthey, Christian Rolf, Clare E. Singer, Nicole Spelten, Vasiliy Volkov, Vladimir Yushkov, and Fred Stroh\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 3169–3189, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-3169-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-3169-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Asian monsoon anticyclone is the key contributor to the global annual maximum in lower stratospheric water vapour. We investigate the impact of deep convection on the lower stratospheric water using a unique set of observations aboard the high-altitude M55-Geophysica aircraft deployed in Nepal in summer 2017 within the EU StratoClim project. We find that convective plumes of wet air can persist within the Asian anticyclone for weeks, thereby enhancing the occurrence of high-level clouds.\n\nA case study on the impact of severe convective storms on the water vapor mixing ratio in the lower mid-latitude stratosphere observed in 2019 over Europe\n\nDina Khordakova, Christian Rolf, Jens-Uwe GrooÃ, Rolf MÃ¼ller, Paul Konopka, Andreas Wieser, Martina KrÃ¤mer, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 1059–1079, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-1059-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-1059-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nExtreme storms transport humidity from the troposphere to the stratosphere. Here it has a strong impact on the climate. With ongoing global warming, we expect more storms and, hence, an enhancement of this effect. A case study was performed in order to measure the impact of the direct injection of water vapor into the lower stratosphere. The measurements displayed a significant transport of water vapor into the lower stratosphere, and this was supported by satellite and reanalysis data.\n\nOn the cross-tropopause transport of water by tropical convective overshoots: a mesoscale modelling study constrained by in situ observations during the TRO-Pico field campaign in Brazil\n\nAbhinna K. Behera, Emmanuel D. RiviÃ¨re, Sergey M. Khaykin, Virginie MarÃ©cal, MÃ©lanie Ghysels, JÃ©rÃ©mie Burgalat, and Gerhard Held\n\nAtmos. Chem.

We ran three different cloud-resolving simulations of an observed case of overshoots in Bauru during the TRO-Pico balloon campaign in the context of upscaling the impact of overshoots at a large scale. These simulations, which have been validated with balloon-borne and S-band radar measurements, shed light on the local-scale variability and composition of overshoots.\n\nNew investigations on homogeneous ice nucleation: the effects of water activity and water saturation formulations\n\nManuel Baumgartner, Christian Rolf, Jens-Uwe GrooÃ, Julia Schneider, Tobias Schorr, Ottmar MÃ¶hler, Peter Spichtinger, and Martina KrÃ¤mer\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 65–91, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-65-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-65-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAn important mechanism for the appearance of ice particles in the upper troposphere at low temperatures is homogeneous nucleation. This process is commonly described by the Koop line, predicting the humidity at freezing. However, laboratory measurements suggest that the freezing humidities are above the Koop line, motivating the present study to investigate the influence of different physical parameterizations on the homogeneous freezing with the help of a detailed numerical model.\n\nComparison of mid-latitude single- and mixed-phase cloud optical depth from co-located infrared spectrometer and backscatter lidar measurements\n\nGianluca Di Natale, Marco Barucci, Claudio Belotti, Giovanni Bianchini, Francesco D'Amato, Samuele Del Bianco, Marco Gai, Alessio Montori, Ralf Sussmann, Silvia Viciani, Hannes Vogelmann, and Luca Palchetti\n\nAtmos.

In this paper the properties that characterize these clouds are retrieved from lidar and far-infrared spectral measurements performed in winter 2018/19 on the Zugspitze (Germany). The synergy of lidar and spectrometer measurements allowed us to assess the exponent k of the power-law relationship between the backscattering and the extinction coefficients.\n\nThe Asian tropopause aerosol layer within the 2017 monsoon anticyclone: microphysical properties derived from aircraft-borne in situ measurements\n\nChristoph Mahnke, Ralf Weigel, Francesco Cairo, Jean-Paul Vernier, Armin Afchine, Martina KrÃ¤mer, Valentin Mitev, Renaud Matthey, Silvia Viciani, Francesco D'Amato, Felix Ploeger, Terry Deshler, and Stephan Borrmann\n\nAtmos.

The vertical particle mixing ratio profiles show a distinct layer (15–18.5 km), the Asian tropopause aerosol layer (ATAL). The backscatter ratio (BR) was calculated based on the aerosol size distributions and compared with the BRs detected by a backscatter probe and a lidar aboard M55, and by the CALIOP lidar. All four methods show enhanced BRs in the ATAL altitude range (max. at 17.5 km).\n\nHigh homogeneous freezing onsets of sulfuric acid aerosol at cirrus temperatures\n\nJulia Schneider, Kristina HÃ¶hler, Robert Wagner, Harald Saathoff, Martin Schnaiter, Tobias Schorr, Isabelle Steinke, Stefan Benz, Manuel Baumgartner, Christian Rolf, Martina KrÃ¤mer, Thomas Leisner, and Ottmar MÃ¶hler\n\nAtmos.

Based on an extensive set of homogeneous freezing experiments at the AIDA chamber with aqueous sulfuric acid aerosol, we provide a new fit line for homogeneous freezing onset conditions of sulfuric acid aerosol focusing on cirrus temperatures. In the atmosphere, homogeneous freezing thresholds have important implications on the cirrus cloud occurrence and related cloud radiative effects.\n\nIn situ observation of new particle formation (NPF) in the tropical tropopause layer of the 2017 Asian monsoon anticyclone â Part 2: NPF inside ice clouds\n\nRalf Weigel, Christoph Mahnke, Manuel Baumgartner, Martina KrÃ¤mer, Peter Spichtinger, Nicole Spelten, Armin Afchine, Christian Rolf, Silvia Viciani, Francesco D'Amato, Holger Tost, and Stephan Borrmann\n\nAtmos.

New particle formation (NPF) next to cloud ice was detected in situ by abundant nucleation-mode aerosols (> 6 nm) along with ice particles (> 3 Âµm). NPF was observed mainly below the tropopause, down to 15 % being non-volatile residues. Observed intra-cloud NPF indicates its importance for the composition in the tropical tropopause layer.\n\nObservations of the downwelling far-infrared atmospheric emission at the Zugspitze observatory\n\nLuca Palchetti, Marco Barucci, Claudio Belotti, Giovanni Bianchini, Bertrand Cluzet, Francesco D'Amato, Samuele Del Bianco, Gianluca Di Natale, Marco Gai, Dina Khordakova, Alessio Montori, Hilke Oetjen, Markus Rettinger, Christian Rolf, Dirk Schuettemeyer, Ralf Sussmann, Silvia Viciani, Hannes Vogelmann, and Frank Gunther Wienhold\n\nEarth Syst.

Zugspitze at 3000 m altitude to measure the far-IR spectrum of atmospheric emissions. The measurements, including co-located radiometers, lidars, radio soundings, weather, and surface properties, provide a unique dataset to study radiative properties of water vapour, cirrus clouds, and snow emissivity over the IR emissions, including the under-explored far-IR.\n\nIn situ observation of new particle formation (NPF) in the tropical tropopause layer of the 2017Â Asian monsoon anticyclone â PartÂ 1: Summary of StratoClim results\n\nRalf Weigel, Christoph Mahnke, Manuel Baumgartner, Antonis Dragoneas, BÃ¤rbel Vogel, Felix Ploeger, Silvia Viciani, Francesco D'Amato, Silvia Bucci, Bernard Legras, Beiping Luo, and Stephan Borrmann\n\nAtmos.

New particle formation (NPF) was identified in situ by abundant nucleation-mode aerosols (6–15 nm in diameter) with mixing ratios of up to 50 000 mg−1. NPF occurred most frequently at 12–16 km with fractions of non-volatile residues of down to 15 %. Abundance and productivity of observed NPF indicate its ability to promote the Asian tropopause aerosol layer.\n\nAirborne Mid-Infrared Cavity enhanced Absorption spectrometer (AMICA)\n\nCorinna Kloss, Vicheith Tan, J. Brian Leen, Garrett L. Madsen, Aaron Gardner, Xu Du, Thomas Kulessa, Johannes Schillings, Herbert Schneider, Stefanie Schrade, Chenxi Qiu, and Marc von Hobe\n\nAtmos. Meas.

Its design makes it robust and allows for sensitive measurements. AMICA has been used on two different aircraft for measuring gases including carbonyl sulfide, carbon monoxide and ozone. With fairly simple adaptions, AMICA can measure many stable trace gases that absorb light in the infrared.\n\n3-D tomographic observations of Rossby wave breaking over the North Atlantic during the WISE aircraft campaign in 2017\n\nLukas Krasauskas, JÃ¶rn Ungermann, Peter Preusse, Felix Friedl-Vallon, Andreas Zahn, Helmut Ziereis, Christian Rolf, Felix PlÃ¶ger, Paul Konopka, BÃ¤rbel Vogel, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos.

Infrared limb sounding measurements of trace gases in the lower stratosphere, including high-resolution 3-D tomographic reconstruction, revealed complex spatial structures in stratospheric tracers near the polar jet related to previous RW breaking events. Backward-trajectory analysis and tracer correlations were used to study mixing and stratosphere–troposphere exchange.\n\nSouthern Ocean cloud and aerosol data: a compilation of measurements from the 2018 Southern Ocean Ross Sea Marine Ecosystems and Environment voyage\n\nStefanie Kremser, Mike Harvey, Peter Kuma, Sean Hartery, Alexia Saint-Macary, John McGregor, Alex Schuddeboom, Marc von Hobe, Sinikka T.

This study presents ship-borne measurements, collected during a 6-week voyage into the Southern Ocean in 2018, that are an important supplement to satellite-based measurements. For example, these measurements include data on low-level clouds and aerosol composition in the marine boundary layer, which can be used in climate model evaluation efforts.\n\nProcesses influencing lower stratospheric water vapour in monsoon anticyclones: insights from Lagrangian modelling\n\nNuria Pilar Plaza, AurÃ©lien Podglajen, Cristina PeÃ±a-Ortiz, and Felix Ploeger\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 9585–9607, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-9585-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-9585-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe study the role of different processes in setting the lower stratospheric water vapour. We find that mechanisms involving ice microphysics and small-scale mixing produce the strongest increase in water vapour, in particular over the Asian Monsoon. Small-scale mixing has a special relevance as it improves the agreement with observations at seasonal and intra-seasonal timescales, contrary to the North American Monsoon case, in which large-scale temperatures still dominate its variability.\n\nThe stratospheric BrewerâDobson circulation inferred from age of air in the ERA5 reanalysis\n\nFelix Ploeger, Mohamadou Diallo, Edward Charlesworth, Paul Konopka, Bernard Legras, Johannes C. Laube, Jens-Uwe GrooÃ, Gebhard GÃ¼nther, Andreas Engel, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Chem.

Our results show a slower stratospheric circulation and higher age for ERA5. The age of air trend in ERA5 over the 1989–2018 period is negative throughout the stratosphere, related to multi-annual variability and a potential contribution from changes in the reanalysis system.\n\nEvaluation of the new DWD ozone and temperature lidar during the HohenpeiÃenberg Ozone Profiling Study (HOPS) and comparison of results with previous NDACC campaigns\n\nRobin Wing, Sophie Godin-Beekmann, Wolfgang Steinbrecht, Thomas J. McGee, John T. Sullivan, Sergey Khaykin, Grant Sumnicht, and Laurence Twigg\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 3773–3794, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-3773-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-3773-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper is a validation study of the newly installed ozone and temperature lidar at HohenpeiÃenberg, Germany. As part of the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC), lidar stations are routinely compared against a travelling reference lidar operated by NASA. We have also attempted to assess potential biases in the reference lidar by comparing the results of this validation campaign with a previous campaign at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence, France.\n\nThe advective BrewerâDobson circulation in the ERA5 reanalysis: climatology, variability, and trends\n\nMohamadou Diallo, Manfred Ern, and Felix Ploeger\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 7515–7544, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-7515-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-7515-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDespite good agreement in the spatial structure, there are substantial differences in the strength of the Brewer–Dobson circulation (BDC) and its modulations in the UTLS and upper stratosphere. The tropical upwelling is generally weaker in ERA5 than in ERAI due to weaker planetary and gravity wave breaking in the UTLS. Analysis of the BDC trend shows an acceleration of the BDC of about 1.5 % decade-1 due to the long-term intensification in wave breaking, consistent with climate predictions.\n\nMonthly resolved modelled oceanic emissions of carbonyl sulphide and carbon disulphide for the period 2000â2019\n\nSinikka T. Lennartz, Michael Gauss, Marc von Hobe, and Christa A. Marandino\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 13, 2095–2110, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-2095-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-2095-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study provides a marine emission inventory for the sulphur gases carbonyl sulphide (OCS) and carbon disulphide (CS2), derived from a numerical model of the surface ocean at monthly resolution for the period 2000–2019. Comparison with a database of seaborne observations reveals very good agreement for OCS. Interannual variability in both gases seems to be mainly driven by the amount of chromophoric dissolved organic matter present in surface water.\n\nAsymmetry and pathways of inter-hemispheric transport in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere\n\nXiaolu Yan, Paul Konopka, Marius Hauck, AurÃ©lien Podglajen, and Felix Ploeger\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 6627–6645, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-6627-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-6627-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nInter-hemispheric transport is important for understanding atmospheric tracers because of the asymmetry in emissions between the Southern Hemisphere (SH) and Northern Hemisphere (NH). This study finds that the air masses from the NH extratropics to the atmosphere are about 5 times larger than those from the SH extratropics. The interplay between the Asian summer monsoon and westerly ducts triggers the cross-Equator transport from the NH to the SH in boreal summer and fall.\n\nObservation of cirrus clouds with GLORIA during the WISE campaign: detection methods and cirrus characterization\n\nIrene Bartolome Garcia, Reinhold Spang, JÃ¶rn Ungermann, Sabine Griessbach, Martina KrÃ¤mer, Michael HÃ¶pfner, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos.

Measuring optically thin clouds is challenging but the IR limb sounder GLORIA possesses the necessary technical characteristics to make it possible. This study analyses data from the WISE campaign obtained with GLORIA. We developed a cloud detection method and derived characteristics of the observed cirrus-like cloud top, cloud bottom or position with respect to the tropopause.\n\nA reel-down instrument system for profile measurements of water vapor, temperature, clouds, and aerosol beneath constant-altitude scientific balloons\n\nLars E. Kalnajs, Sean M. Davis, J. Douglas Goetz, Terry Deshler, Sergey Khaykin, Alex St. Clair, Albert Hertzog, Jerome Bordereau, and Alexey Lykov\n\nAtmos. Meas.

Analysis of various other data indicates that the observed enhanced particle levels are due to eastward-shedding vortices from the anticyclone, originating from pollutants emitted in Asian countries and transported vertically by convection in the Asian summer monsoon region.\n\nUpward transport into and within the Asian monsoon anticyclone as inferred from StratoClim trace gas observations\n\nMarc von Hobe, Felix Ploeger, Paul Konopka, Corinna Kloss, Alexey Ulanowski, Vladimir Yushkov, Fabrizio Ravegnani, C. Michael Volk, Laura L. Pan, Shawn B. Honomichl, Simone Tilmes, Douglas E. Kinnison, Rolando R. Garcia, and Jonathon S. Wright\n\nAtmos. Chem.

To test and amend our picture of ASM vertical transport, we analyse distributions of airborne trace gas observations up to 20 km altitude near the main ASM vertical conduit south of the Himalayas. We also show that a new high-resolution version of the global chemistry climate model WACCM is able to reproduce the observations well.\n\nA powerful lidar system capable of 1 h measurements of water vapour in the troposphere and the lower stratosphere as well as the temperature in the upper stratosphere and mesosphere\n\nLisa Klanner, Katharina HÃ¶veler, Dina Khordakova, Matthias Perfahl, Christian Rolf, Thomas Trickl, and Hannes Vogelmann\n\nAtmos.

The details of the highly inhomogeneous distribution of water vapour can be determined with lidar, the very low concentrations at high altitudes imposing a major challenge. An existing water-vapour lidar in the Bavarian Alps was recently complemented by a powerful Raman lidar that provides water vapour up to 20 km and temperature up to 90 km within just 1 h.\n\nAircraft-based observation of meteoric material in lower-stratospheric aerosol particles between 15 and 68Â° N\n\nJohannes Schneider, Ralf Weigel, Thomas Klimach, Antonis Dragoneas, Oliver Appel, Andreas HÃ¼nig, Sergej Molleker, Franziska KÃ¶llner, Hans-Christian Clemen, Oliver Eppers, Peter Hoppe, Peter Hoor, Christoph Mahnke, Martina KrÃ¤mer, Christian Rolf, Jens-Uwe GrooÃ, Andreas Zahn, Florian Obersteiner, Fabrizio Ravegnani, Alexey Ulanovsky, Hans Schlager, Monika Scheibe, Glenn S.

The stratospheric measurements span a latitude range from 15 to 68° N, and we find that at potential temperature levels of more than 40 K above the tropopause; particles containing meteoric material occur at similar abundance fractions across latitudes and seasons. We conclude that meteoric material is efficiently distributed between high and low latitudes by isentropic mixing.\n\nStratospheric aerosol layer perturbation caused by the 2019Â Raikoke and Ulawun eruptions and their radiative forcing\n\nCorinna Kloss, GwenaÃ«l Berthet, Pasquale Sellitto, Felix Ploeger, Ghassan Taha, Mariam Tidiga, Maxim Eremenko, Adriana Bossolasco, Fabrice JÃ©gou, Jean-Baptiste Renard, and Bernard Legras\n\nAtmos.

With satellite observations and models, we describe the exceptionally complex situation following the Raikoke eruption. The respective plume overwhelmed the Northern Hemisphere stratosphere in terms of aerosol load and resulted in the highest climate impact throughout the past decade.\n\nCirrus cloud shape detection by tomographic extinction retrievals from infrared limb emission sounder measurements\n\nJÃ¶rn Ungermann, Irene Bartolome, Sabine Griessbach, Reinhold Spang, Christian Rolf, Martina KrÃ¤mer, Michael HÃ¶pfner, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos.

Simple color-ratio-based methods are examined and compared against more involved nonlinear convex optimization. In a second part, 3-D measurements of the airborne limb sounder GLORIA taken during the Wave-driven ISentropic Exchange campaign are used to exemplarily derive the location and extent of small-scale cirrus clouds with high spatial accuracy.\n\nReappraising the appropriate calculation of a common meteorological quantity: potential temperature\n\nManuel Baumgartner, Ralf Weigel, Allan H. Harvey, Felix PlÃ¶ger, Ulrich Achatz, and Peter Spichtinger\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 15585–15616, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-15585-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-15585-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe potential temperature is routinely used in atmospheric science. We review its derivation and suggest a new potential temperature, based on a temperature-dependent parameterization of the dry air's specific heat capacity. Moreover, we compare the new potential temperature to the common one and discuss the differences which become more important at higher altitudes. Finally, we indicate some consequences of using the new potential temperature in typical applications.\n\nImpact of Lagrangian transport on lower-stratospheric transport timescales in a climate model\n\nEdward J. Charlesworth, Ann-Kristin Dugstad, Frauke Fritsch, Patrick JÃ¶ckel, and Felix PlÃ¶ger\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 15227–15245, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-15227-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-15227-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nModeling the stratosphere requires models with good representations of chemical transport. To do this, nearly all models divide the atmosphere into boxes. This creates some unwanted problems. However, the only other option is to divide the atmosphere into balloons, and this method is very complicated. Here, we use a model which uses this balloon-like method to estimate the impacts of this method on chemical transport. We find significant differences in sensitive regions of the stratosphere.\n\nLong-term variations in ozone levels in the troposphere and lower stratosphere over Beijing: observations and model simulations\n\nYuli Zhang, Mengchu Tao, Jinqiang Zhang, Yi Liu, Hongbin Chen, Zhaonan Cai, and Paul Konopka\n\nAtmos.

This study presents extensive airborne in situ and satellite remote sensing climatologies of cirrus and humidity, which serve as a guide to cirrus clouds. Further, exemplary radiative characteristics of cirrus types and also in situ observations of tropical tropopause layer cirrus and humidity in the Asian monsoon anticyclone are shown.\n\nDeep-convective influence on the upper troposphereâlower stratosphere composition in the Asian monsoon anticyclone region: 2017 StratoClim campaign results\n\nSilvia Bucci, Bernard Legras, Pasquale Sellitto, Francesco D'Amato, Silvia Viciani, Alessio Montori, Antonio Chiarugi, Fabrizio Ravegnani, Alexey Ulanovsky, Francesco Cairo, and Fred Stroh\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 12193–12210, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-12193-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-12193-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe paper presents and evaluates a transport analysis method to study the convective injection of air in the upper troposphere–lower stratosphere of the Asian monsoon anticyclone region. The approach is thereby used to analyse the trace gas data collected during the StratoClim aircraft campaign. The results showed that fresh convective air can be injected fast at a high level of the atmosphere (above 17 km), with potential impacts on the stratospheric chemistry of the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nIntercomparison and evaluation of ground- and satellite-based stratospheric ozone and temperature profiles above Observatoire de Haute-Provence during the Lidar Validation NDACC Experiment (LAVANDE)\n\nRobin Wing, Wolfgang Steinbrecht, Sophie Godin-Beekmann, Thomas J. McGee, John T. Sullivan, Grant Sumnicht, GÃ©rard Ancellet, Alain Hauchecorne, Sergey Khaykin, and Philippe Keckhut\n\nAtmos. Meas.

The objective is to validate the ozone and temperature profiles at OHP to ensure the quality of data submitted to the NDACC database remains high. A mobile reference lidar operated by NASA was transported to OHP and operated concurrently with the French lidars. Agreement for ozone was better than 5 % between 20 and 40 km, and temperatures were equal within 3 K.\n\nAn Estimate of Global, Regional and Seasonal Cirrus Cloud Radiative Effects Contributed by Homogeneous Ice Nucleation\n\nDavid L.

This is achieved by constraining an atmospheric global climate model with measured cirrus cloud properties via satellite remote sensing. The results show that the overall radiative warming contributed by homogeneous ice nucleation"
