        "text": "Q. Your progression has been steady in terms of work. How is that adventure?\n\nA. Personally, I feel every individual has a unique journey. The way I am perceiving my career can't be compared to someone else. The experiences will be different. My approach has been slow and steady. I have always opted for roles which gave me fun. I wanted to be a part of Indubala Bhaater Hotel because it’s a fantastic story. So was Srikanto. I believe in slowly making something instead of achieving feats overnight and being unable to manage it. So the stepwise progression has always been important for me. Growth is important for me, as an actor.\n\nImage by Avishek Mitra/IBNS\n\nQ. How did your success in the web space help you in exploring diverse roles?\n\nA. Ah… I never intended to keep on doing work to stay relevant. It was never a case for me. I wanted to explore myself as an actor and create an impact. I believe in my capabilities. I am proud of my growth as an individual and an actor. I feel happy for the fact that I have been noticed for every role I played so far.\n\nQ. How was your reunion with Vikram Chatterjee Pariah, which deals with the atrocities dogs face?\n\nA. This is my third project with Vikram Chatterjee. In Tansener Tanpura, I played his mother on a different timeline. I was his cousin sister in Roktokorobi. In Pariah, I am his heroine. Pariah is special to me because this is my first film where I am the female lead. The experience has been massive. After watching Bhotbhoti, I wanted to work with Tatha-da (Tathagata Mukherjee). I got this opportunity. I was very pepped when I was asked for the role because the issue needs to be discussed.\n\nAngana Roy in Pariah | Photo courtesy: Screenshot grab from trailer\n\nQ. How was the bonding among the lead actors who are dog lovers?\n\nA. It was great. It was a film set where all were dog lovers. Moreover, Sreelekha-di (Sreelekha Mitra, co-actor) and Tatha-da actively work for dogs. The rest of us were dog lovers. From Sreelekha-di and Tatha-da, we came to know about the real picture of the kind of atrocities dogs face. Those stories helped me a lot in slipping into the role. It has been a heavy, awakening and fulfilling experience.\n\nQ. How do you manage works in other media while working on TV which consumes a lot of an actor?\n\nA. It's tough in the initial months during which episodes are banked. I will get breaks in the middle if I get opt for some projects. I hope to get better works on the web and in films. I will create the space as and when work comes to me. It won’t be a problem.\n\nAngana Roy (L) with Vikram Chatterjee (R) | Photo courtesy: Instagram/Angana Roy\n\nQ. Do you intend to consider TV as a base?\n\nA. No, I haven't thought about it. I feel like it's the time for television, where I wanted to work at some point. In future, I will again do a daily soap if I feel it will bring a change in the present style of storytelling. But it's not that my primary work will be TV and rest will revolve around it. I want to do web and films as well.\n\nQ. Last time you told IBNS that you were not prompt on social media. Did you progress?\n\nA. I am not prompt even now. My manager does the posts. I hardly get any time. I am trying to reach there. My social media is all about work."
