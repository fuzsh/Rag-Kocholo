        "text": "Dhruv : \"Someone from this society of yours had given birth to me and left me on the streets to fend for myself. Then I was told that I cannot choose my family. Why can't I? Who made this rule?\"\n\nSociety often labels people with whom you have blood-relations as your family but unfortunately when you are abandoned by the family who brought you on this earth, you don't get to choose a family for you instead you are either sent to an orphanage or hired to do child labour to earn for your survival. Dhruv had been a victim of the same. He used to work in a roadside dhaba as a child and always dreamt of having a family of his own, while the owner of the dhaba Purshottam aka Premi chacha fuelled him to acquire economic self-sufficiency by studying so that he can built his own family and that might have served as the driving force behind his success.\n\nWhen Dhruv fell in love with Anya, he couldn't muster up the courage to confide in her the truth about his childhood because of the fear of rejection as the society in which Dhruv resided made him believe that an orphan or a person who is estranged from his family is a misfit according to stereotypical societal norms expected of a bridegroom and that served as one the sole reasons behind Dhruv's quest to search for fake parents.\n\nBeing an orphan Dhruv was deprived of parental love and care therefore deep down he always yearned to have that love which he received when he finally convinced Purshottam and Dipti to enact the roles of his mother and father. From a worker in the Dhaba to a successful entrepreneur, Dhruv's journey wasn't enough to present himself as a suitable groom infront of Anya's household because in order to be suitable as per the society, he ought to have a family of his own and that made him desperate to make a fake one.\n\nSometimes strangers can turn into family and family can turn into strangers in the due course of time. This can be reflected in a certain conversation between Dhruv and Dipti when Dipti in a remorseful tone tells him how her son Varun distanced himself from her because of a small misunderstanding regarding his marriage and how she found her son in Dhruv playing the role of his mother.\n\nWhen Dhruv's truth was finally divulged a day before his marriage, his monologue to justfy his reason behind the decision to choose a fake family, redefined the whole concept of family. He represented those unfortunate souls whose responsibilities are shrugged off by their parents right after their birth and therefore Dhruv asserts his right to choose his own family because family doesn't always revolve around people with whom we are connected through blood or genes, sometimes it means those with whom we can equally share our grief and happiness and who will stand with us through thick and thin of life just as Dipti and Purshottam stood for Dhruv. Family should be not part of your reputation to be maintained in a superficial society rather it should be your haven with whom you can be yourself and who will embrace you just the way you are.\n\nAt times in life we don't get the love and support we desire from our family just like Dipti and we have all the right to choose people from whom we get that love and care as our family, just as Dipti, Purshottam and Dhruv chose each other to form a happy family because in the end what matters is the happiness and being around people who can give you that happiness.\n\nSrilekha Mitra"
