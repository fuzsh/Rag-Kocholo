However, they aspire to learn digital skills and work in local and global markets to earn a handsome amount and get better opportunities.\"\n\n\"Rahitul offers an exceptional example of a fighter's journey, showcasing the transformation of traditional Bangladesh to Digital Bangladesh that we dream of, which is very inspiring,\" he added."
