        "text": "Anik Dutta's upcoming movie, Borunbabur Bondhu is about a scrupulous, upright old man who doesn’t spare even his family when it comes to matters of principle. Played by veteran actor Soumitra Chattopadhyay, the film has an ensemble cast comprising Arpita Chatterjee, Ritwick Chakraborty, Kaushik Sen, Bidipta Chakraborty, Paran Bandyopadhyay, Sreelekha Mitra and Anusha Viswanathan among others. The film, which releases today, has already garnered praise from audiences and critics alike at the Kolkata International Film Festival, held in November last year.\n\nWe caught up with actors Sreelekha and Anusha, who play mother and daughter respectively in the film. Sreelekha recently impressed the audience with her performance as an independent and assertive woman in Sweater, and is known for choosing quality films. The 22-year-old Anusha too has done a couple of web series including Water Bottle and Do Not Disturb, apart from the film Dhananjoy. We sat with the bubbly, outspoken actors for a chat at Awadhi fine diner Oudh 1590 over some Galouti kebabs and other delicacies on work and more. Excerpts:\n\nSreelekha, you recently impressed the audience with your convincing acting in Rainbow Jelly and Sweater. You have a small, but an impressive role in Borunbabur Bondhu. Do you ever consider the length of your role in a film?\n\nSreelekha Mitra: For me, it has always been about the character in a film. Even in Bhooter Bhobishyot, where I passed out seeing the ghost played by Swastika Mukherjee, I got noticed by the audience in that blink-and-you-miss role. Anik Dutta is one of the few genuine people in the industry, and I have never refused any role that he has offered me so far. Borunbabur Bondhu is no exception.\n\nSM: That’s for the industry to answer. I don’t believe in begging, and I don’t have any numbers of producers or directors saved on my phone. I know that not mingling beyond work does hamper one’s career, but I don’t have the energy to hang out after work with my colleagues.\n\nAV: I believe that any artiste who joins politics loses the right to be a part of the actor’s collective since the constitution states that once a person joins politics, he or she has to leave their jobs. Isn’t acting a job?\n\nSM: I am in Aditya Bikram Sengupta’s next untitled movie, which is an experimental film. I play Ela, who is the illegitimate daughter of a cabaret dancer and the owner of a theatre company. It shows how she copes with the realities of her life. She is married, but though her husband is a good man, there is no spark in their relationship. She’s ambitious and also dabbles in acting, though her films don’t work. Aditya creates situations where there are no dialogues at all, making his films even more refined. There’s also Subhrajit Mitra’s Avijatrik, where I play Ranu di. Supratim has done a splendid job as DoP of the film. I am also a part of Indranil Roychowdhury’s next untitled project.\n\nAV: I want a character that attracts me. But I am still studying, and I think I have enough time to make choices. Currently, I am doing a play Protyasha, directed by Kheyali Dastidar, and reading a few interesting scripts."
