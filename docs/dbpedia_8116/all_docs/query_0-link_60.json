        "text": "The present wave of scams isn’t discriminating, affecting both celebrities and common individuals. This time, Bengali actress Sreelekha Mitra fell victim, losing nearly ₹1 lakh.\n\nReportedly, the actress was suffering from a fever when she received a call from an unknown number. The caller persuaded her to download an application on her phone, and she claims she was too weak to even have suspicions.\n\nAlso Read – Arijit Surpasses Taylor Swift To Become Most Followed On Spotify\n\nBy the time she regained her senses, it was too late; the scammer had transferred around ₹1 lakh to their own account, and the actress lost access to her own account.\n\nUpon realizing what happened, she left a note on social media to raise awareness about the issue. She also acknowledged her own mistake and urged people not to trust such calls or texts.\n\nAlso Read – Indian Rapper’s Success Making Many Jealous\n\nSreelekha also appreciated the swift action taken by the police and cyber cell.\n\nRecently, India has become a hub for such scams, with 56% of scams occurring on the internet. There have been reports of a man from Maharashtra being scammed for ₹12 lakhs in an online part-time job scam. It’s not just the older generations who are victims; most of those affected are young and should be more cautious."
