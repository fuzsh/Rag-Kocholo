Research findings have shown that using pomegranate extracts can positively affect a variety of signaling pathways, including those involved in angiogenesis, inflammation, hyperproliferation, cellular transformation, the beginning stages of tumorigenesis, and lastly, a reduction in the final stages of metastasis and tumorigenesis. This is due to the fact that pomegranate extracts are rich in polyphenols, which are known to inhibit the activity of certain signaling pathways. In the United States, cancer is the second biggest cause of death after heart disease. The number of fatalities caused by cancer in the United States escalates yearly. Altering one's diet, getting involved in regular physical activity, and sustaining a healthy body weight are three easy steps an individual may follow to lower their cancer risk. Simply garnishing one's diet with vegetables and fruits has the potential to avert at least 20% of all cancer diagnoses and around 200,000 deaths caused by cancer each year. Vegetables, fruits, and other dietary constituents, such as minerals and phytochemicals, are currently being researched for their potential to prevent cancer. It is being done because they are safe, have minimal toxicity, possess antioxidant properties, and are universally accepted as dietary supplements. Ancient civilizations used the fruit of pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) to prevent and cure a number of diseases. The anti-tumorigenic, anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative qualities of pomegranate have been shown in studies with the fruit, juice, extract, and oil of the pomegranate. Pomegranate has the capacity to affect several signaling pathways, which implies that it may have the potential to be employed not only as a chemopreventive agent but also as a chemotherapeutic drug. This article elaborates on some recent preclinical and clinical research which shows that pomegranate seems to have a role in the prevention and treatment of a number of cancers, including but not limited to breast, bladder, skin, prostate, colon, and lung cancer, among others.\n\nKeywords: Pomegranate, Neoplastic, Cell dedifferentiation, Angiogenesis, Apoptosis, Metastasis\n\n1. Introduction\n\nCancer is still recognized as one of the most life-threatening and aggressive diseases despite the many diagnostics and therapeutic rationales that have been developed [1]. Early intervention, effective treatments of indigenously metastatic melanoma, and proper management of non-localized cancer are some of the credible approaches that can be used to regulate the incidence and progression of cancer which will consequently decrease mortality and morbidity affiliated with cancer disease. Other options include early detection and treatment, efficient non-localized cancer care, and effective cancer medicines that do not target a specific area. In order to lower the incidence and burden of cancer, prevention seems to be the most effective technique [2]. Chemoprevention employs naturally occurring and artificial bioactive compounds to inhibit, halt, reverse, or defer carcinogenesis [3]. A certain dietary pattern that includes a high vegetable and fruit intake has been linked to a significant reduction in the risk of cancer development and progression [4], which epidemiological research has proven [5]. Phytochemicals such as flavonoids, isoflavones, and lycopene, as well as minerals, vitamins, and fiber, are found in these foods. All these elements are part of promoting good health and preventing sickness [5]. It is well-known that fruits and vegetables contain antioxidants that differ in structure, amount, and function. In the human body, oxidative stress can occur to these antioxidants [6]. The pomegranate fruit, scientifically known as pomegranate, belongs to the Lythraceae family. It is deciduous, and according to the information that we have, it was first planted in what is now Iran, but it has also been grown in Northern India and across the Mediterranean area for a very long period [7]. It is presently cultivated throughout North America, Europe, South America, and tropical Africa to produce its fruit yield as well as beautiful shrubs and trees. The pomegranate berry is sphere-shaped with a thick, crimson skin covering and protecting the seeds, which may be colored white, deep red, or purple. Because of the presence of hydrolyzable substances in huge quantities, such as anthocyanins and tannins in pomegranate seeds, they are easily digested and have powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant qualities [8]. Pomegranate antioxidant and polyphenol combinations seem to offer a larger range of activity against a variety of free radicals. This feature has made pomegranate unique among other antioxidants, like beta-carotene and ascorbic acid [9]. Pomegranate anthocyanins are known to have a much higher level of antioxidant activity compared to the antioxidants found in green tea and red wine [10]. It has been deployed in a number of medicinal systems to manage and cure a variety of diseases. In Ayurvedic medicine which is a historic Indian medicinal practice, it was suggested that pomegranate can be utilized as an anthelmintic medicine together with the treatment of ulcers and diarrhea [11,12]. The Unani medical system has implied the use of pomegranate for diabetes control, and according to this practice, blood sugar levels have been demonstrated to be reduced by pomegranate extract [13]. According to research on pomegranate's health benefits that have been published over the last few decades, the medicinal properties of pomegranate have aroused the attention of today's scientific community [14,15]. Interestingly, not only the pomegranate fruit but also other parts, such as the leaves, barks, and roots, have a high concentration of molecular elements that have the potential to be used in medicinal applications [12,16]. It has been discovered that pomegranate and the components that makeup pomegranate can effectively alter a wide variety of signaling pathways that are all associated with hyperproliferation, cellular transformation, inflammation, angiogenesis, tumorigenesis, and metastasis [12,16]. Pro-inflammatory mediators, cell adhesion molecules, anti-apoptotic proteins, and growth factors have all been shown to be regulated by the pomegranate fruit's contents . In the first part of this overview essay, we discussed about some of the mineral ions and polyphenolic components of pomegranate. Following that, we discussed research on pomegranate's effects on different types of cancer in cell culture systems, animal models, and human beings. These effects were chemo preventive or chemotherapeutic, and the malignancies include but are not limited to breast, bladder, skin, prostate, colon, and lung cancer. This article concluded by discussing some of the potential fallout that might arise as a consequence of these studies.\n\nTable 1\n\nCancersCellular TargetsIn vitro/in vivo/clinicalExtract/PhytochemicalMechanismReferencesSkinMAPK activation (UVB-mediated), STAT3, and NFκB signaling pathway inhibitionIn vitro, in vivoGalactomannan (PSP001) isolated from the fruit rind, Fruit extractDown-regulation of VEGF & MMPs[[17], [18], [19], [20], [21]]BreastAnti-estrogenic and anti-aromatase properties are shown by this compoundIn vitroExtract (peel)Decreased expression of β-catenin & EMT markers[22,23]Estrogen-responsive genes inhibitionIn vitroExtract (peel oil)Down-regulation of metastasis-related genes[24,25]Pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as chemokines and vascular endothelial growth factors, are reducedIn vitroExtract (seed)Reduced secretion of inflammatory cytokines[[26], [27], [28], [29], [30]]ProstateReduce the serum PSA rangesIn vitro, in vivoFruit extractNF-κB blockade[31,32]NF-κB activation and STAT3 phosphorylation is regulated and reducedIn vitro, in vivoFruit extractDecreased expression of HIF-1α &VEGF[[32], [33], [34], [35]]IGF-1/Akt/mTOR signaling inhibitionin vivoLuteolin Ellagic acid + Punicic acidDecreased expression of oncogenic miRNAs & inhibition of the CXCR4/SDF1α chemotaxis axis, changes in the expression of cell adhesion & cytoskeletal proteins[[36], [37], [38]]LungReduce p27 and p21 protein transformation\n\nPCNA, Ki-67, and cyclins/CDKs transformation downregulation\n\nPI3K/Akt, MAPK, and NF-κB signaling pathways inhibitionIn vitroExtract (leaves)Reduction of MMP-2 & MMP-9 expression[39,40]It prevents the production of DNA adducts.In vitroGalactomannan (PSP001) isolated from the fruit rindDown-regulation of VEGF & MMPs[21,41,42]Proliferative, inflammation, and angiogenesis-related indicators are all reduced. c-Met and MAPK phosphorylation preventionIn vivoFruit extractInformation not available[43,44]ColonCyclooxygenase-2 transformation, the binding activity of NFκB DNA, and Akt phosphorylation preventionIn vitro, In vivoJuiceTargeting miR-126-regulated pathways which contribute in anti-inflammatory & anti-angiogenic mechanisms[42,45]Hepatic GST action is reducedIn vitro, in vivoJuice, Tannin, PunicalaginAbolish TNFα-induced AKT activation resulting modulation of inflammatory cell signaling[46,47]miR-18a-3p, miR-181c-3p, miR-1249, miR-765, miR-646, miR-496 modulationInformation not availableInformation not availableInformation not available[48]\n\n2. Chemical constituents\n\nThe fruit is divided into three parts: (i) the seeds that make up three percent of its weight, (ii) the peel that contains the fruit's inner membranes, and (iii) the juice, which makes up 30% of its weight [49]. The predominant isomer of conjugated linolenic acid in seed oil is punicic acid (18:3 cis-9, trans-11, cis-13). The oil contains sterols, cerebrosides, and steroids [9]. Pomegranate juice's polyphenolic concentration gives it more antioxidant action compared to green tea and red wine [50]. Peel, mesocarp, and arils include hydroxybenzoic acids, gallagyl esters, gallotannins, anthocyanins, ellagitannins, and hydroxycinnamic acids. Recent discoveries include vanillic acid glucoside, brevifolin carboxylic acid, valoneic acid bilactone, and dihydrokaempferol hexoside. Punicalagin, the most frequent pomegranate ellagitannin, ranges from 11 to 20 g/kg in the peel and mesocarp and 4–565 mg/L in the juice [51]. Commercial and lab-extracted juices have varied phenolic contents. Juice prepared from arils alone, or the entire fruit has a high polyphenol content [50,51]. Extraction temperatures and solvents also matter. It is recommended to extract phenolic components with methanol at 60 °C. For anthocyanins, distilled water is preferred [52]. Because most of the phenolic compounds in pomegranate fruit are concentrated in the peel and pericarp, commercial juices produced by squeezing the whole fruits contain large quantities of gallic acid, punicalagin, and ellagic acid, particularly in comparison to hand-squeezed smoothies made from the arils alone. The pomegranate marc, comprised of seed tissues, pericarp, and peel, contains polyphenols (20.1%). One investigation tested sterilized pomegranate marc from aqueous extracts for 180 days. The study found that high pH affects antioxidant and spectral properties. Light made the extracts less clear and pallid. Low pH (3.5) and dark storage retained 58% of antioxidant activity and 67% of total soluble phenolic content [53]. Antifungal ellagitannins, mainly punicalagin, are present in pomegranate peels and peel extracts. It has been recommended as a synthetic fungicide alternative during storage [53].\n\n3. Pomegranate phyto-molecules and their bioavailability\n\nPomegranate's antioxidant action is connected to its polyphenolic compounds, especially ellagitannins. The bioavailability of dietary ellagitannins is not properly elucidated, and so is the metabolism. These compounds must be linked to antioxidant health effects. Human and animal studies have examined pomegranate's bioavailability, absorption, and metabolism. One hour after drinking 180 mL pomegranate juice (PJ), ellagic acid was found in plasma at a concentration of 31.9 ng per milliliter. Plasma is cleared 4 h after consuming food-derived ellagic acid [54]. A follow-up investigation verified that ellagitannins absorption, plasma clearance, and urolithin metabolites excretion is prolonged for two days following PJ consumption [55]. When tests were performed in the laboratory and outside the living body, these compounds exhibited antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities [56,57]. Ellagic acid bioavailability in plasma was similar for PJ and its extracts (both liquid and powdered). Identical results were obtained for its metabolites as well [58]. Drinking 1 L of PJ containing 0.49 g/L anthocyanins and 4.37 g/L punicalagins for 13 days, it was found that plasma was free from punicalagin, ellagic acid, anthocyanins, or their breakdown products [59]. However, PJ metabolites, such as urolithin A and urolithin B, in addition to an additional metabolite that could not be identified, were found in plasma. After a period of 24 h, these three metabolites, together with a matching aglycone metabolite, were found in the urine. Based on the timing of metabolites' emergence in plasma and urine samples following three to four days of PJ administration, the researchers suggested that PJ polyphenols were metabolized by gut microbes [60,61]. In another study, healthy adults were put on a diet free from polyphenols and antioxidants for three days. After that, they were given an 800 mg pomegranate extract in capsule form [62] containing 21.6 mg ellagic acid and 330.4 mg punicalagin. In the third study, ellagic acid levels in plasma rose 1 h after extract administration, and antioxidant capacity enhanced 0.5, 1, and 2 h later. Only dimethyl ellagic acid, urolithin A and B, and their associated metabolites were detected in plasma [63]. Animal models absorb urolithin metabolites, which accumulate in the colon, prostate, and other tissues [64]. Three days after PJ therapy, human prostate tissues contained dimethyl ellagic acid, urolithin A glucuronide, and urolithin B glucuronide [65]. Pomegranate polyphenolic components may be absorbed and reach the circulation as antioxidants or degraded by gut microbes to produce other physiologically active chemicals [65].\n\n4. Mechanism of action of pomegranate-specific phytochemicals as an anticancer agent\n\nIt has been demonstrated that not only pomegranate juice but also its peel and seed oil have anti-cancer properties, including the ability to suppress angiogenesis and cancer cell proliferation. Amin et al. had found that those parts of pomegranate are beneficial due to the antiproliferative and antioxidant properties (cell cycle disruption, growth inhibition, and apoptosis) and can be used in skin, breast, lung cancer [66,67]. Pomegranate fruit, juice, seed, and seed oil were found to be beneficial. Despite the tremendous complexity and diversity of cancer illnesses, researchers have uncovered many characteristics shared by the majority of different forms of neoplasia. According to Hanahan and Weinberg [68,69], some of the hallmarks of cancer include replicative immortality, prolonged proliferative signaling, resistance to cell death, deregulation of cellular energetics, activation of invasion, and metastasis, avoiding immune destruction, inducing angiogenesis, and evasion of growth suppressors. The development of these features is brought about by genomic instability, which speeds up the pace at which mutations occur, as well as inflammation that encourages the growth of tumors. Senga and Grose have elaborated on this concept by adding four more features that explain the pathogenesis of cancer. These qualities include epigenetic dysregulation, dedifferentiation (or trans differentiation), an altered microbiome, and disrupted neural signaling [70]. Pomegranate is a potent anticancer agent which inhibits carcinogenesis in animal models of different carcinomas. It does this by inhibiting several signaling pathways in cancer cells, inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in cancer cells [5,63]. Some of the cancer cell signaling pathways include Jak/STAT, NF-κB, and MAPK/ERK. They are continuously overactivated or downregulated, which leads to dedifferentiation, proliferation, persistent angiogenesis, and metastasis in many types of cancer cells. Using synthetic or natural medicines to modify these signaling pathways offers a rational basis for preventing or treating cancer.\n\n4.1. Modulation of STAT3 pathway\n\nThe abbreviation STAT refers to a protein group known as signal transducers and activators of transcription. This protein group is comprised of dormant cytosolic or intracellular transcription factors. These transcription factors are active participants in cell signaling pathways that are triggered by internal and external stimuli. As a result of the activation of these proteins [71,72], a number of key biological genes linked with angiogenesis, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and inflammation are either expressed or inhibited. In humans, the STAT protein family has seven subtypes. These members are denoted by the acronyms STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5a, STAT5b, and STAT6. The most well-known oncogenic protein is STAT3, which is expressed by the STAT3 gene. Its action is controlled by phosphorylation, acetylation, and the redox pathway [73]. The STAT3 protein consists of six key structural motifs revealed by structural biology research. One of them is the trans-activation domain. The confrontation of certain tyrosine kinase receptors that are positioned in the trans-activation domain is made easier by the binding of many stimuli or ligands. These include receptors for epidermal growth factors (EGFs), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), transforming growth factor-1 (TGF-1), vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs), or receptors that are lacking inherent tyrosine kinase [74,75]. However, healthy cells are able to operate even without the STAT3 gene being active [76], but malignant cells cannot. Malignant cells need the activation of the STAT3 protein. In normal cells, STAT3 activation is controlled, but it is abnormally dysregulated in cancer cells because of the overexpression of the STAT3 gene. Therefore, cancerous cells experience a disruption in the mechanisms that are involved in angiogenesis, cell proliferation, autophagy, differentiation, metabolic changes, immunosuppression, and programmed cell death, as well as in cell survival [[76], [77], [78]]. It has been shown that some compounds belonging to the family of natural substances known as pomegranate-specific phytochemicals display either chemoprotective or chemopreventive properties [79,80]. A wide variety of pomegranate-specific phytochemicals have been carefully researched in various cancers. It is estimated that these phytochemicals have the potential and specific capacity to inhibit uncontrolled STAT3 signaling pathways [[81], [82], [83]]. Because of this, developing new therapies that are more secure and effective has become a challenging undertaking. In this review, we address natural pomegranate-specific phytochemical compounds which act on STAT3 and its target genes for the treatment of cancer.\n\n4.2. Targeting PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in oncology\n\nResearch on anti-cancer treatments also focused heavily on the PI3K/Akt pathway, where PI3K stands for phosphoinositide 3-kinase and Akt stands for protein kinase B. This prototype survival pathway also receives external signals from a large number of membrane receptors (such as EGFR), and it plays a crucial role in the survival of cells and the formation of new blood vessels in a variety of different ways. The glycolytic phenotype can be seen in most forms of cancer. In most cases, this glycolytic phenotype of cancer cells can be traced back to the PI3K pathway, which in turn may be traced back to the serine/threonine kinase Akt. The PI3Ks are a distinct kinase family that is composed of three subtypes. Phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate (PIP2) is the most important subtype. It results in the production of PIP3. This results in changes in the function of downstream proteins, which are controlled by the quantities of PIP3 that are found inside the cell [84,85]. This kinase interacts with diversified membrane receptors. Hence, this helps explain its role in various illnesses, such as cancer and type 2 diabetes mellitus [84,86]. The fact that PI3K signaling is the most common route implicated in cancer provides the impetus for targeting the PI3K pathway in cancer treatment. This impetus comes from research that has shown that PI3K signaling is the most prevalent route implicated in cancer. As was mentioned before, the PI3K signaling pathway has the capacity to have an effect on each step of the carcinogenesis process. In addition, involvement of this pathway has been shown as a marker for determining prognosis and predicting how well a patient would respond to chemotherapy [87]. Nevertheless, aiming for this pathway is not straightforward but rather full of obstacles, as shown in different study results. Some of these drawbacks are (i) PI3K targeting is seldom lethal, (ii) in response to PI3K signaling suppression, cancerous cells have evolved inherent strategies to withstand treatment, (iii) inhibition has not been properly observed as per expectation from the treatment, and (iv) treatment has caused an elevated level of insulin owing to PI3K's influence on metabolism, resulting in hyperglycemia and more [88]. PI3K signaling pathway is blocked by six distinct classes of pharmaceuticals, each of which has a unique mode of action [89,90]. These drugs include PI3K blockers, pan-class I PI3K inhibitors, inhibitors of isoform-selective PI3K, inhibitors of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase, inhibitors of pan-PI3K/mTOR, and Akt inhibitors. Polyphenols have the ability to influence many PI3K signaling molecules, such as PDK1, Akt, and mTOR [91,92]. The mechanism by which the pharmaceuticals achieve their anti-carcinogenic effects is illustrated in .\n\nIt has been shown that the expression of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt is changed in a variety of different cancers. In prior research, it was shown that drinking pomegranate juice (PJ) might reduce the amount of NF-κB and VCAM-1 mRNA that was produced. Additionally, it was able to increase the expression of miR-126 while simultaneously decreasing the phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt and mTOR. PJ consumption was shown to be effective in reversing each and every one of these effects. PJ, according to the results of another study, is able to prevent the activation of the protein TNF-α, which is required for the proper functioning of the NF-κB transcription factor. In a recent study, researchers examined the effects of pomegranate peel extracts and juice on two prostate cancer cell lines, DU-145 and PC-3. Punicalagin and ellagic acid are the principal phenolic components in the peel extract. The findings showed that extracts from pomegranate peel caused changes in the mTOR/S6K signaling pathway in prostate cancer cells. This, in turn, had a potent anti-cancer impact on the cells. It has been shown that ellagic acid, which is a metabolite of punicalagin, may be able to prevent the development of cancers. A therapy with 2.5 μM ellagic acid was shown to impair the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in a study including cervical cancer. In order to achieve this goal, the expression level of IGFBP7 was increased, which may have stopped HeLa cells from entering the tissue.\n\n4.3. Targeting NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways in oncology\n\nMAPKs are serine/threonine kinases that modulate the activation of NF-κB and AP-1 in response to a wide range of extracellular stimuli. The MAPK family includes the ERK1/2 and JNK kinases, as well as the p38 kinases [98,99]. MAPK family members, including ERK1/2 and p38, have been shown to modulate NF-κB activation via the IKK-NF-κB pathway, according to research [100]. The transcription element NF-κB is an essential modulator of cellular functions to inflammation, proliferation, survival, and cellular stress [[101], [102], [103]]. Punicalagin therapy resulted in a reduction in p-JNK levels, indicating that punicalagin inhibited MAPK pathway activation. Punicalagin's anti-inflammatory properties were also demonstrated in cattle. To explore the impact of punicalagin on bovine endometritis, researchers used lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to stimulate bovine endometrial epithelial cells. Punicalagin pretreatment considerably reduced the production of IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8, according to the research [100]. Punicalagin decreased the phosphorylation of p38, c-JNK, and ERK in mechanistic molecular tests, suggesting that it might prevent LPS-induced MAPK activation [[101], [102], [103]]. Both lipooxygenase (LOX) and cyclooxygenase (COX) are required for the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins and leukotrienes, which are essential inflammatory mediators. Pomegranate inhibits the enzymes lipooxygenase (LOX) and cyclooxygenase (COX) [104,105]. In studies, the researchers found that administering pomegranate led to a substantial reduction in the production of cytokines, which are proteins that contribute to inflammation. According to the results of this research, pomegranate is capable of inhibiting not only the p38-MAPK pathway but also the NF-κB transcription factor [[106], [107], [108]]. There is a correlation between the activation of NF-κB and p38-MAPK with an increase in the gene expression of important inflammatory mediators such as COX-2, IL-1, TNF-α, iNOS, and MCP1 [109]. This increase in gene expression is connected to the activation of p38-MAPK. Several studies have found these substances to have a connection with increased gene expression. The use of punicalagin proved successful in repressing the NF-κB pathway activation in ME-180 cervical cancer cells. In papillary thyroid carcinoma, which is the most frequent kind of endocrine carcinoma, it was shown that punicalagin has anti-cancer potential. In other investigations on papillary thyroid cancer, exposure to punicalagin triggered the phosphorylation of IB, which was followed by its destruction, as well as the translocation of p65 into the nuclear compartment. Therefore, the indicated studies advocate for the regulatory role of punicalagin in the NF-κB signaling cascade. Mukherjee and his colleagues found that providing tumor-bearing rats with pomegranate polyphenols such as punicalagin and ellagic acid reduced the amount of liver damage and cell death that was caused by the tumor. Modulating Nrf2 and NF-κB helped achieve this goal, which in turn led to a reduction in the amount of liver damage and cell death that was caused by the tumor. The NF-κB transcription factor class is in charge of regulating the expression of genes that are involved in a wide variety of physiological processes, such as differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and inflammatory responses. This class of transcription factors is responsible for the expression of genes that are involved in a wide variety of physiological processes [110]. There are many different kinds of cancer, and researchers have discovered that all of them are connected to the activation or overexpression of NF-κB. Research conducted in vitro indicated that prostate cancer cell lines that had been treated with pomegranate extract had decreased levels of the protein NF-κB as well as enhanced levels of apoptosis that had been caused by the extract to its maximum level. A halt in the progression of lung cancer cells derived from humans that had been treated with an extract of pomegranate fruit caused the cell cycle to get stuck in the G0-G1 phase. In addition, the findings of the study indicated that treating cells with extract was effective in decreasing the ability of NF-κB to bind to DNA [111]. The generation of COX-2 protein that is generated by TNF-α was shown to be significantly suppressed by pomegranates, according to one research. Additionally, an extract of the fruit was found to potentially inhibit cell growth in carcinoma cells, according to another study [47,112,113].\n\n4.4. Inhibition of invasion and metastasis\n\nIn order to achieve the capacity to invade (expansion into the local host environment) and metastasis (migration to a new place and creation of a new tumor lesion), cancer cells need to disrupt typical biological pathways. The process known as metastasis is the stage in the development of cancer that is considered to be the most significant, and it is also the primary factor that decides whether or not treatment is successful [114]. It has been demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the signaling pathway that includes PI3K, Akt, and mTOR does, in fact, play a part in the promotion of metastasis. Numerous papers, such as those on glioblastomas, osteosarcomas, and prostate cancer, amongst others, have shed light on the role that this route plays in the dissemination of cancer [115]. The malignant behavior of a tumor is characterized by epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) a process where epithelial cells are transferred into mesenchymal cells. This transition causes epithelial cells to change both their function and their appearance. The process is partly mediated by several distinct signaling pathways, including the PI3K/Akt route, the TGF-signaling pathway, the NF-κB pathway, the Ras pathway, and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway [116]. During this phase, there is a rise in the expression of Vimentin, SMA, N-cadherin, and Fibronectin, while there is a decrease in the amount of E-cadherin and β-catenin, as well as CK18 and CK8 [117]. In an effort to reduce the number of instances of metastasis, researchers have focused their attention on this particular signaling system. This is because of PI3K's role in the extracellular matrix (ECM) in addition to other pre-apoptotic events that encourage apoptosis. It has been found that luteolin can prevent breast cancer from spreading in miscellaneous ways by exerting an influence on the processes of angiogenesis, proliferation, and invasion [118]. It accomplishes this by reducing the levels of VGEF, lowering the rate of EMT, raising the rate of apoptosis, and lowering the rate of proliferation. It has been discovered that a decrease in PI3K signaling is connected with a significant number of these unfavorable effects. As a result of Luteolin's ability to block the interaction of Akt with GSK3, Ras with ERK, and PI3K with Akt, the output of the pathways in which these proteins are involved is reduced [119]. Out of all the malignancies, breast cancer carries a significant chance of metastasizing or spreading to the bones. Patients who have been diagnosed with this and have metastases are believed to suffer from an incurable form of the disease. P-hydroxycinnamic acid, which is a flavonoid, was proven to display anti-metastatic properties when tested on MDA-MB-231 cells. For a cancerous cell to invade healthy bone tissue, it must enlist the assistance of osteoclasts and osteoblasts. These two cell types both produce growth factors that are essential to the process, and the malignant cell must coax them into helping it. When cultivated with MDA-MB231 cells in bone marrow co-cultures, this flavonoid is able to block these actions and prevent them from occurring [119]. It is speculated that the effects of p-hydroxycinnamic acid on the signaling pathways of NF-κB and PI3K are what is responsible for the alteration of these effects. It has been discovered that some phytochemicals present in pomegranates have the ability to inhibit Akt signaling while concurrently elevating the expression of miR-101. This miR-101 has been shown to have a relationship with TNM staging that is diametrically opposed to that of Akt [119].\n\n4.5. Induction of cancer cell apoptosis\n\nApoptosis, often called programmed cell death, is a process that takes place in tissue to ensure that cellular physiology and function remain normal. Apoptosis is triggered when cells have accumulated a significant amount of unrepairable DNA damage. On the other hand, cancerous cells have the ability to bypass apoptosis and remain in the body, which becomes detrimental over time. An example of this is the P53 gene and caspases, two important modulators for apoptosis, which are mutated and downregulated in cancerous cells, respectively [90]. The binding of Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3)-only proteins to pro-apoptotic proteins like p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), NADPH oxidase activator (NOXA), and Bim can also initiate the process of apoptosis. Epigallocatechin-3 gallate, also known as EGCG, was found to induce programmed cell death (apoptosis) in tumor cells such as those found in nasopharyngeal, breast, prostate, and bladder carcinomas. It did this by inhibiting the production of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins and encouraging the production of pro-apoptotic Bax. The p53 gene is a tumor inhibitor that works by altering the cell cycle, activating checkpoints in the cell cycle, causing apoptosis, repairing DNA, and preventing tumor growth. The Bax protein, which encourages cells to commit suicide, is a target that lies downstream of the p35 gene. Anticancer phytochemicals are primarily responsible for inducing apoptosis in breast and prostate carcinoma cells. This is performed by maintaining and boosting p53 function, which is often accomplished by suppressing tumor suppressive microRNA (miR-34a). In clinical research, it has been discovered that one effective strategy in the fight against cancer is to focus on apoptosis as the primary point of attack. One technique to target apoptosis is by focusing on the peripheral pathways that are implicated in both cell survival and death. These pathways include Akt and its downstream signaling, known as the P13K-Akt-FOxO axis [120,121]. Because polyphenols can target this route, they may be able to influence apoptosis as well [122]. Various phytochemicals cause apoptosis via caspase-dependent and caspase-independent mechanisms. Punicalagin, a phytochemical derived from the pomegranate, has been demonstrated to cause apoptosis in small cell lung carcinoma and human colorectal lymph node by boosting caspase 9 and 3 activity, respectively [123,124]. The anticancer phytochemicals' target locations for inducing apoptosis are depicted in the diagram .\n\nThere is thought to be a correlation between cancer development and modification of protein expression. This includes both pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax) and antiapoptotic proteins (Bcl-2). Ellagic acid was evaluated on human neuroblastoma cells, and the findings show that it promoted cell separation, impaired cell viability, and triggered apoptosis in the neuroblastoma cells [126]. According to the findings of the study, the inclusion of pomegranate extract for treating prostate cancer cells led to the suppression of cell growth and the activation of apoptosis [37]. The findings of a research that was undertaken to investigate the chemopreventive capability of a pomegranate emulsion against mammary tumorigenesis showed that the emulsion had an anti-carcinogenic influence by deducing cell proliferation and triggering apoptosis in the mammary cancer cells [127]. In the past, it was shown that some medications, such as genistein and pomegranate extracts, may have a role in the apoptosis activation in MCF-7 cells. These medications can be used alone or in combination therapy [128]. It has been shown that the bioactive chemicals in pomegranate have a preventive role in cellular growth by modifying the progression of the cell cycle and the activation of apoptosis [129].\n\n4.6. Induction of cell cycle arrest\n\nThe activities that take place inside a cell and that ultimately lead to cell division and replication are collectively referred to as the cell cycle. The G1 phase, the S phase (synthesis), the G2 phase (interphase), and the M phase are the four distinct stages that make up this process (mitosis). Cell cycle arrest is one of the essential strategies that may be taken to prevent cancer. Several research studies showed that pomegranates and their constituents have an important role to play in the control of cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. It has been observed that pomegranate peel extract has a contribution to the growth inhibition of K562 cells, primarily via the cell cycle arrest during the G2/M phase [130]. In order to guarantee that the tasks carried out during each phase of the cell cycle are carried out appropriately before progressing to the next phase, researchers have identified a number of checkpoints. Several investigations revealed that pomegranate extract inhibited the G0/G1 phase of cell cycle progression. It subsequently reduced the breast cancer cell line (WA4) development in the mouse as well. Previous studies have pointed out a range of possible mechanisms behind these effects, one of which involves the cell signaling molecules and machinery involved in the cell cycle being altered. Ellagitannin and its metabolite urolithin, which is produced from the juice of pomegranate, inhibit cell proliferation and clonogenic efficiency in HT-29 cells in a dosage- and time-dependent manner. This takes place during the G0/G1 and G2/M phases of the cell cycle. The exact mechanism follows cell cycle arrest, which is then succeeded by the induction of apoptosis. According to the findings of flow cytometry, the plant extract induced apoptosis by inhibiting cell cycle progression, which had an impact on the H1299 cell growth [40]. Pomegranate extracts were tested on multiple myeloma cells, and the findings showed that they had cytotoxic and apoptotic effects. These effects were achieved by altering the potential of the mitochondrial membrane and producing cell cycle arrest [131]. A test of the DNA cell cycle showed that pomegranate treatment caused cell cycle arrest in the lung cancer cell line. The G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle was affected. The severity of the arrest was shown to be dose-dependent. Furthermore, there is an increase in the amount of UVA-induced cell cycle arrest that takes place in the G1 phase of the cell cycle when normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) have been pretreated with pomegranate. Ellagic acid is a phenolic compound that, when tested in vitro on T24 human bladder cancer cells, induces cell cycle arrest and death. This was discovered via research conducted on ellagic acid. This is accomplished by triggering an arrest in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, boosting the expression of the p53 and p21 genes, and lowering the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK2) gene. At a stage of the cell cycle referred to as the G1-S phase restriction point, the molecule known as CDK4 plays an essential part in controlling the movement of the cell cycle along with its development. CDK4 is the most important CDKs to be inhibited by the tumor suppressor p16Ink4a, which is responsible for all of the inhibition. It was revealed that the N-terminal section of some truncated p16Ink4a molecules is not significant to the interaction that these molecules have with CDK4; this discovery was made possible by the fact that the N-terminal portion of the full-length molecule is irrelevant. On the other hand, Ostad and colleagues have shown in the past that the C-terminal domain of p16Ink4a is sufficient for cell cycle arrest, growth inhibition, and interaction with CDK4/6. This was proved to be the case in a study that was conducted on mice.\n\n5. Onco-preventive and onco-therapeutic potential of pomegranate natural compounds\n\nPomegranate is an excellent source of polyphenols, including ellagitannins like punicalagin and punicalin and flavonoids like quercetin and kaempferol [132]. Pomegranate juice is also a good source of flavonoids. The AKT pathway is one of the many signaling pathways that may be targeted by these chemicals, which have been found to contain anti-cancer activities and can target a variety of signaling pathways that are implicated in the genesis and progression of cancer. Research have shown that the compounds punicalagin and punicalin, which may be found in both the juice and the peel of pomegranate, have the ability to block the AKT pathway in cancer cells. It has been demonstrated that punicalagin may reduce AKT activation via inhibiting PDK1, which is an upstream regulator of AKT. On the other hand, punicalin can directly inhibit AKT activity by binding to its active site [[133], [134], [135]].\n\n5.1. Breast cancer\n\nThe second leading cause of death from cancer in women all over the world is breast cancer [[136], [137], [138], [139]]. It is common for malignancies to develop across the body without displaying any physical signs. There is a substantial likelihood that metastatic abnormalities will be formed by the time a tumor is diagnosed [[140], [141], [142], [143]]. This revelation has sparked considerable interest in the quest for new anticancer drugs [140,141,143]. In an effort to dramatically reduce undesirable side effects, researchers are presently concentrating their efforts on targeted therapies that are largely based on cancerous cell apoptosis. The primary emphasis has been made on natural resources and plant-based substances to treat this disease. When it comes to breast cancer cell growth, estrogen and its catalyzing enzymes are the primary factors responsible for the disease's progression. As androgen is converted into estrogen, the enzyme aromatase assists in the process. Therefore, blocking this enzyme may promote breast cancer therapy even more. Researchers performed in vitro experiments on the aromatase enzyme inhibitory effects of ellagic acid extract, together with urolithins A and B, two key pomegranate components. The aromatase-inhibiting effect of pomegranate extracts was also shown in a placental microsome aromatase test using ellagitannin-derived compounds, such as methylated urolithin A which in turn inhibits the multiplication of breast cancer cells [144]. Pomegranate seed oil and fermented fruit extracts were shown to reduce the number of tumors produced during in vivo investigations on mammary organ culture in mice. This suggests the effectiveness of pomegranate compounds as a therapy for breast cancer [145]. In vitro experiments on cancer stem cells generated from MMTV-Wnt-1 demonstrated that pomegranate extraction suppressed cancer cell growth by stopping the premature cell cycle and triggering apoptosis in the cancer cells. The enzyme caspase 3, which assists in apoptosis, was increased in response to pomegranate compounds. Cell growth was shown to be inhibited by ellagic acid and ursolic acid, as well as luteolin, among the numerous samples. In addition, pomegranate preparations inhibited the growth of breast cancer cells in molecular experiments done on MCF-7 cells. The anti-cancer effectiveness in MCF-7 cells was shown to be attributable to induction of apoptosis, downregulation of genes that promote tumorigenesis, and overexpression of genes that are benefited in the management of proliferation and differentiation. As a result, pomegranate extracts may be useful and alternative in the treatment of breast cancer, particularly in situations when conventional treatments are ineffective [146].\n\n5.2. Prostate cancer\n\nThe prostate gland is a male reproductive supplementary organ that is placed underneath the bladder and around the urethral [147]. The primary role of the prostate is to produce and sustain sperm viability by supplying the semen with critical ejaculate-forming substances [148]. The prostate gland's cells typically give rise to tumors, most commonly in the middle to late stages of life [149]. Adult men's prostates may be subdivided into three distinct areas: primary, transitional, and peripheral [150,151]. On average, in young adult males, 70% of the prostate glandular tissue comes from this peripheral zone, and this region is crucial to maintaining a healthy and functional prostate. Nearly 80% of all prostate tumors originate in this region, making it the most likely place for them to grow in older men [151,152]. It is estimated that more than a million men worldwide are diagnosed with prostate cancer each year [153]. According to recent research, patients with localized illness who are at low to moderate risk of relapse have a better prognosis with a 99% overall life expectancy of 10 years if the cancer is identified and addressed at an early stage [154,155]. The incidence rate of prostate cancer is higher than 30 on a global scale, making it the most common form of cancer found in men [156]. If a person has a history of cancer in their family, they are at an increased risk of developing prostate cancer [157].\n\n5.3. Colon cancer\n\nRecently, colorectal cancer has been diagnosed in both males and females at one of the highest rates. It is distinguished by the excessive growth of epithelial cells and the prevention of their apoptotic, which refers to the process by which cells die in their normal environment [158]. Pomegranate contains ellagitannin and urolithin, which is one of its key components and is one of the primary components of the process that impedes colon cancer cell growth. This is achieved by pausing the cell cycle and blocking MAPK pathway [159]. Both of these processes are necessary to achieve the desired result. Because the CYP1 enzymes are responsible for the translation of inert carcinogens into cancer-causing substances in the body, it is critical for colon cancer that urolithin and ellagitannins have an impact on them. The activity of the CYP1 enzyme was evaluated using EROD assay (ethoxy resorufin-O-demethylase assay), which revealed a decrease in the number of CYP1 enzymes that were induced in the cell line study. This assay was observed in the context of the cell line study that used HT-29 colon cancer cells. The EROD assay was the method that led to the discovery of this fact. It was found that the extracts selectively exhibited a dose-dependent pattern of limiting the development of cancer cells whereas keeping the proliferation of non-cancerous cells untouched. This was accomplished without affecting the growth of the cells that did not develop into cancer. Moreover, ellagitannin and urolithin increased cell line apoptosis, which reduced cell colony number [160]. Rats were treated with N-methyl nitrosourea and induced with colon cancer. This resulted in Bcl2 and TGF plasma level elevation, as well as an increase in the number of antigens that were unique to colon cancer. In another artificially created mice model, it was shown that extracts from pomegranate peel produced a reduction in the cancer-specific characteristics. The outcomes of these animal studies, which were carried out on rats, suggested using pomegranate in cancer therapy. The in vivo research offers more evidence that pomegranate is beneficial in the treatment of colon cancer by decreasing cell proliferation and raising the rate at which malignant cells commit suicide (apoptosis). This was shown by a drop in cancer cell markers CCSA-4 and CEA, as well as β-catenin genes, which are critical to colon cancer growth. The downregulation of that specific gene is what causes the disruption in the signaling pathway that includes Wnt/β-catenin [161,162]. According to the findings of research carried out using HT-29 and HCT116 colon cancer cell lines, extracts from pomegranate revealed a substantial antiproliferative activity. This activity resulted in the total suppression of the cell's capacity to divide and multiply, and the results varied depending on the amount of the extract. It turned out that the extract was the one that was responsible for triggering apoptosis in the selected cell lines. In addition to this, it was found that the extracts had an impact on colon cancer cells that had not yet spread to other parts of the body (metastasized). Studies that were done on cell lines give an additional indication that ellagic acid, punicalagin, and pomegranate tannins all have a role in the cancer-preventative activity that was demonstrated in colon cancer [163].\n\n5.4. Bladder cancer\n\nPatients who are identified with advanced stages of bladder cancer have a little probability of surviving the disease [23,46]. One of the most prevalent forms of cancer that affect the urinary system and may ultimately be lethal is bladder cancer. A prolonged period of asymptomatic clinical progression is one of the defining characteristics of this condition. The underlying cause of this disease is determined by three primary risk factors: (i) family history, (ii) genetic abnormalities, and (iii) exposure to a carcinogen (from chemicals or surroundings). People suffering from genitourinary tract diseases are also susceptible to this type of cancer [164]. Because of the many positive effects that pomegranate has on a person's health, it is common knowledge that pomegranate is a functional food that carries a great deal of importance. In several studies [165,166], it was shown that pomegranate played a significant part in the treatment of bladder cancer. In recent years, pomegranate juice has proved to possess a number of positive effects on human health. The HPLC-MS investigation of pomegranate rind extract (PRE) revealed that the ellagic acid, punicalagin A, and punicalagin B were the most significant phytocompounds present in the sample. PRE was revealed to have a selectively suppressive impact on the human bladder cancer cell viability in comparison to pRE-resistant rat urinary bladder epithelial cells (EJ cells). In order to test the efficiency of caspases in the EJ cell viability, a pan-caspase inhibitor known as z-VAD-FMK was used in this study. The EJ cells were administered PRE. The findings of this research indicated that the overall effect on caspases that was produced by the use of this strategy was positive. Apparently, caspase-10 (out of caspase-3, -8, and -10) did not have any influence throughout the process of apoptosis in EJ cells, which revealed the function that caspase-3 plays in triggering cell death. During the process of cell death, there was an increase in both the levels of the proteins: poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and caspase-3. During the process of cell death, PRE was also able to increase the production of miR-34a by using a method that included the switching of c-Jun and protein p53. Through their interaction with the p53/miR-34a axis, the polyphenols that were a part of PRE were able to reduce the bladder cancer cell proliferation [167]. Pomegranate fruit ethanol extract (PEE), according to the results of Lee ST and colleagues, was able to limit the growth of UBUC tumor cells by producing an arrest in the cell cycle in the S phase. This was accomplished by forcing the cell cycle to pause and elevating cyclin A levels while simultaneously lowering CDK-1 levels [168]. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the presence of PEE led to the activation of pro-caspase-3, -8, and 9, in addition to an increase in the ratio of Bax to Bcl-2. PEE was shown to trigger the synthesis of procaspase-12, which resulted in an increase in the endoplasmic reticulum stress indicator, such as CHOP expression [167]. This was the most significant realization that came from carrying out the research. In addition, Wu TF and his colleagues discovered that an extract of ethanol exhibited effects that were both anti-proliferative and apoptotic. They were able to do this by inhibiting activity along the PTEN/Akt/mTORC1 pathway, which was achieved by increased synthesis of profilin 1 [167].\n\n5.5. Pancreatic cancer\n\nThe conventional treatment for cancer has very little effect on the progression of the disease, which is one of the primary reasons why the cancer of the pancreas is one of the most crucial health issues. A patient diagnosed with pancreatic cancer dies after developing metastases and experiencing the progression of the disease [23]. At least one study has been done to investigate whether or not drinking pomegranate juice can have an impact on the cells that make up pancreatic cancer. Once human pancreatic cancer cells (PANC-1 cells) are treated with pomegranate extract (PE), it reaches a condition in which the cell cycle is stopped, and controlled cell proliferation takes place. PE treatment elevated the number of cells lacking CD44 and CD24 expression, both of which are linked with greater tumor-initiating capacity. This discovery provides evidence that PE altered the phenotypic of the cells. It has been shown that the effectiveness of PE in inhibiting the proliferation of PANC-1 cells is much higher than that of the gold standard medicine paclitaxel in this regard. Nonetheless, only a minor degree of activity was proven by the pomegranate components that were discovered. As a consequence of this, more study into the finding of other components in PE that are involved in the mechanism of its anticancer impact in pancreatic cancer is required. According to the conclusions of this study, PE is an efficient PANC-1 cells inhibitor when tested in vitro. It achieves this result by concentrating on the progression of the cell cycle in test tube [169]. Pomegranate extracts treatment resulted in inhibition of PNAC-1 cell proliferation and cell cycle arrest. Moreover, pomegranate extract elevated the content of cells deficient in CD24 and CD44 expressions revealing that pomegranate extract changed cell phenotype. As compared to paclitaxel, the pomegranate extract significantly inhibited the cellular proliferation of PNAC-1 cells. They suggested that pomegranate phytochemicals were responsible for the anticancer potential of pomegranate extracts [170].\n\n5.6. Liver cancer\n\nThe liver in our body is the third most common site for cancer, and liver cancer is the fifth most dominant reason behind cancer-related mortality, making hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) a major health concern [171]. Oxidative stress causes this type of cancer [172]. Pomegranate contains antioxidant and anti-inflammatory phytochemicals [173,174]. Pomegranate-derived chemicals have been studied in hepatocellular carcinoma in vitro. After a 24-h intervention, while the seed oil from this fruit failed to alter human liver cancer cells (Huh7 and HepG2) development [173]. On the other hand, its peel extract formulation galactomannan polysaccharide (PSP001) [29] was able to exert its effect, and so does a new formulation of PSP001 (SNP@PSP) [175]. Li et al. found four polyphenols in pomegranate: peels, seeds, juice, and leaves [176]. Out of all the sections of pomegranate, the peel extract showed stronger cytotoxicity against HepG2 cells than other sections. Probably this effect was visible because of having high phenolic content of those extracts, as much as 83%. Cytotoxic effects were initiated in the S-phase of the cell cycle leading to cell cycle arrest and death, followed by increasing ROSs, elevated activity of caspase-3 and caspase-9, inducing p53 expression, inducing Bax expression, and Bcl-2 expression downregulation [177]. Saratale et al. established a green synthesis of AgNPs employing pomegranate leaf extract (PGE) [178]. This combination inhibited HepG2 cells more than PGE alone, perhaps owing to free-radical shielding. Likewise, when the extract was combined with solid lipid nanoparticles, it exhibited much better cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells compared to PGE [179]. In vivo research has not shown that pomegranate juice affects medication metabolism and clearance [180]. At protein and mRNA levels, pomegranate extract (PE) lowered hepatic β-catenin and raised glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) in a dose-dependent manner. This demonstrates that PE bioactive components chemoprevent HCC by proapoptotic and antiproliferative processes through regulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. El-Ashmawy et al. [172] verified the liver cancer-preventive efficacy of pomegranate ingredients and different modes of action [129,173,174].\n\n5.7. Skin cancer\n\nCancer of the skin is quite common since the skin is the body's primary protective barrier against elements such as heat, sunlight, damage, and infection [181]. In SK-MEL human malignant melanoma cells, several ellagitannins from pomegranate juice demonstrated considerable antiproliferative activity [161]. These ellaginatinns included punicalin, ellagic acid, gallic acid, punicalagin, and hexahydroxy diphenic acid. PSP001, a galactomannan polysaccharide produced from pomegranate peel, has proved to be cytotoxic against other human cancerous melanoma (A375) cells, probably via inducing apoptosis [182]. Several different animal models have been subjected to in vivo research, and the results have shown that pomegranate extract has anti-skin tumor-promoting characteristics [183,184]. In SKH-1 hairless mouse epidermis, researchers have demonstrated that pomegranate fruit ethanol extract (PFE) can inhibit UVB radiation-induced carcinogenesis [185]. Additionally, a reduction in lipid peroxidation, skin edema, H2O2 synthesis, hyperplasia, COX-2 expression, and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity have been discovered and are thought to be associated with PFE. Along with that, the repair of UVB-mediated formation of 8-Oxo-7,8-Dihydro-2′-Deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers was significantly improved [185]. A double-stage mouse skin tumorigenesis model was examined to evaluate the activity of PFE. It was found that PFE and diallyl sulfide were able to produce a synergistic effect on reducing the incidence of tumors and causing a relapse in tumor volume. Perhaps because of the ERK1/2 and JNK1 expression down-regulation, as well as a reduction in the NF-κB/p65 expression, were the reasons behind it [186]. Studies have been conducted to support these findings. In addition, there was an increase in the expression of the tumor suppressor p53 and the cyclin kinase inhibitor p21. This was observed in conjunction with downregulation of NF-κB and IKK, as well as phosphorylation inhibition and degradation of IKK [17,185]. Moreover, the expression of these genes was found to be increased. PFE was also able to prevent the phosphorylation of MAPK that was caused by UVB, and it was able to prevent the production of p38 protein [17]. Hora JJ et al. conducted one in vivo research to show that 5% pomegranate seed oil significantly decreased the expression of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) induced ODC activity, which has a part to play in skin cancer progression [183]. In general, it has been discovered that pomegranate has powerful and effective chemo preventative qualities against skin cancer without displaying any negative side effects.\n\n5.8. Ovarian cancer\n\nIt is one of the fatal gynecological cancers, and new therapies are needed against the backdrop of chemoresistance. The SKOV3 human ovarian cancer cells were unaffected by a methanolic preparation of the pomegranate pericarp [187]. However, using the same cancer cells, different studies reported that methanolic peel extract has antiproliferative activity [188]. So do ellagitannins, that is derived from pomegranate juice [161]. Nonetheless, the exact mechanism of action was not described in any of those. The seed extract from this fruit was also proven to suppress the development of SKOV3 cells in an unidentified method [189]. Pomegranate juice resulted in MMP-2 and MMP-9 production downregulation. The growth of the human ovarian cancer cell line, A2780, was inhibited due to the presence of some of the components, such as luteolin and ellagic acid [190]. The multiplication of HeLa, SiHa, and C33A cells may be reduced by ellagic acid. When HeLa cells were treated with ellagic acid, apoptosis was induced, the G1 phase stopped, and JAK2/STAT3 phosphorylation was avoided [191].\n\n5.9. Brain cancer\n\nGliomas, although being a very common kind of brain tumor, have a dismal prognosis due to their resistance to both surgical and pharmacological therapy. This makes the prognosis for glioma patients quite bleak. It is noteworthy that in U87MG human glioma cells, the punicalagin found in pomegranate might potentially trigger cell death [192]. The decrease in cell viability was shown to have a correlation with the increased expression of cyclin E, while at the same time, the cyclin A and B expressions were discovered to have decreased. Punicalagin caused the U87MG cell line to undergo apoptosis, which was proven by an enhanced activity of caspase-9 and caspase-3, breakdown of PARP, and an escalated LC3-II cleavage in the affected cells. Either by the ectopic synthesis of p27kip1 or through the phosphorylation of Thr198, autophagy may be stimulated to a greater degree. Nevertheless, it is yet to be known whether or not AMPK plays a function in controlling autophagy. This is because autophagy is a relatively new discovery. Apart from this, it was shown that punicalagin was able to raise the total amount of phosphorylated AMPK, in addition to elevating the level of phosphorylated p27 at the Thr198 location. The fact that chloroquine treatment caused a dose-dependent decrease in the amount of punicalagin-induced cell death is additional evidence that punicalagin is capable of inducing autophagic cell death. This was displayed by the fact that the reduction in the amount of punicalagin-induced cell death occurred. The antimalarial drug chloroquine inhibits the process of autophagy. These results, despite the fact that they are preliminary, are encouraging, and they provide support to the need for more study on the anticancer effectiveness of punicalagin in gliomas.\n\n5.10. Thyroid cancer\n\nThyroid cancer is the most common type of endocrine tumor seen in humans and is responsible for one percent of all malignancies diagnosed worldwide. In the last fifty years, thyroid cancer diagnoses have risen dramatically [193,194]. A chemical known as punicalagin is obtained from the peel or seeds of pomegranate, which contains gallic acid and ellagic acid [195]. This is the primary phenolic component in the juice, and accounts for the majority of antioxidant properties. Additionally, the antiproliferative activity of punicalagin has been observed in several malignancies, such as lung, prostate, cervical, and breast cancer [15,196]. This has been shown by multiple studies. At a concentration of 25, 50, and 100 μM for 24 h, punicalagin was administered to the BCPAP cell line. The outcome of this experiment showed that there was a concentration-dependent reduction in both the number of cells and their viability. Noteworthy is the fact that punicalagin was able to cause autophagic cell death despite the absence of apoptosis, caspase-3, or PARP cleavage in the target cells [197]. In human BCPAP cells, the NF-κB signaling pathway was responsible for the cell cycle arrest that occurred in the G0/G1 phase as well as the induction of the senescent growth arrest that occurred when the incubation time was increased to 72 h [198]. In human BCPAP cells, further research revealed that punicalagin induced cell death by inducing the ATM-mediated (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) DDR (DNA damage response), which occurred independently of ROS and DNA conformational change [195]. An extract of pomegranate peel high in punicalagin was tested for its potential to inhibit the growth of thyroid carcinoma cells in both in vitro and in vivo settings. Apoptosis was triggered in cancer cells by punicalagin, which also strongly inhibited the multiplication of cancer cells in two different thyroid cancer cell lines (BCPAP and TPC-1). This punicalagin was shown to have the ability to lower the mitochondrial membrane potential, which is an indication that this tannin has the capacity to trigger apoptosis via a mitochondria-mediated mechanism. As a result of the various levels of exposure that each cell had to punicalagin, the scientists found that autophagy and apoptosis did not contrast with one another. Punicalagin was administered to BCPAP tumor-bearing mice once daily at doses of 62.5 mg/kg and 125 mg/kg for a combination of 24 days before and after the tumors were inoculated. This was done in order to assess the anticancer activity of punicalagin. Punicalagin dramatically reduced cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in the BCPAP-bearing mice model of cancer, which led to a considerable reduction in tumor development [199].\n\n5.11. Cervical cancer\n\nCervical cancer is the fourth most prevalent form of cancer in women, and it is also the fourth leading cause of mortality in women. The development of warts around the vaginal regions is occurred due to this malignancy [200]. There are several cytotoxic elements, including polyphenols, found in pomegranate peel extract, making it a promising anticancer agent. Different doses of ellagic acid were observed to influence cervical cancer HeLa cells, stimulating the production of IGFBP7 and inhibiting the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. A substantial dose-effect connection was established between the three concentrations of the compound. The findings of the research demonstrated that the invasiveness of HeLa cells in the 3 ellagic acid-treated and IGFBP7 groups was much lesser than in the NC and BL categories. Cell invasion ability was shown to be considerably reduced by amplification of IGFBP7, amplification of HeLa, and amplification of ellagic acid, and the molecular basis of these findings was investigated in more depth [201]. In another piece of research, green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) was performed utilizing aqueous pomegranate extract from the leaves. The anticancer potential of these nanoparticles was studied using human cervical cancer cells (HeLa). A dose-response curve was obtained, which signified that a rise in the dosage concentration of AgNPs leads to an increase in the amount of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) generated, with the quantity of LDH increasing between 50 and 250 μg/mL. This research gives more proof that AgNPs have a deleterious influence on the HeLa cell line that was investigated, as demonstrated by the release of lactate dehydrogenase into the medium. In addition, researchers observed that AgNPs exhibited a response curve and cytotoxic effects that were remarkably equivalent when tested on primary hepatocytes and rainbow trout cell lines. The findings of the MTT cell viability experiment illustrated that AgNPs suppressed the development of human cervical cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. The assay was performed on human cervical cancer cells. In a dose-dependent way, the findings of the LDH cell cytotoxicity test indicated that AgNPs enhanced the proportion of human cervical cancer cells that were hazardous. These two sets of findings point to the fact that the impact of AgNPs on human cervical cancer cells is proportional to the amount of exposure they get. After that, the findings of the experiment concerning the fragmentation of DNA indicated that AgNPs at a concentration of 100 μg/mL were able to induce apoptosis in cells by means of the fragmentation of DNA [186]. According to the findings of this study, an aqueous extract of pomegranate leaves might be used to synthesize AgNPs, which could subsequently be employed for the delivery of drugs.\n\n5.12. Uterine or endometrial cancer\n\nOne of the preliminary studies showed that a high-polyphenol extract of entire pomegranate fruit had no impact on human cervical cancer cells (HeLa) [202]. An exceptionally elevated pomegranate pericarp concentration exhibited an inhibiting impact on SiHa human cervical cancer cells, but it had no effect on HeLa or HEC-1A cells. This pomegranate was extracted from organic solvents, such as methanol [187]. Although the extracts of pomegranate peel considerably hindered HeLa cell proliferation, the extracts of pomegranate seeds, leaves, and juice had a less significant impact [176]. Later, Fazio et al. examined that pomegranate peel extracts in acetone and methanol suppressed HeLa and Ishikawa (human endometrial cancer) cell multiplication [203]. In HeLa cells, the methanolic extract boosted caspase-9, caspase-7, and caspase-3 activity, as well as PARP breakdown and death. Another polyphenol from this fruit– ellagic acid, was obtained from the peel. It boosted apoptosis while concurrently raising IGFBP7 expression in HeLa cells. This was accomplished by lowering Akt/mTOR signaling. Ellagic acid also reduced invasiveness [201]. The growth of three cervical cell lines– CaSki, SiHa, and HeLa was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by the compound punicalagin, which was obtained from pomegranate husks. CaSki was the most sensitive of the three cervical cell lines [124]. In further research, the antiproliferative effect of punicalagin in HeLa cells was demonstrated, in addition to the suppression of cancer cell migration, TIMP-2 and TIMP-3 upregulation, MMP-2 and MMP-9 downregulation, G1 phase cell cycle arrest, the activation of apoptosis via the overexpression of Bax, Bcl-2 and β-catenin downregulation [204].\n\n5.13. Oral cancer\n\nSeeram et al. conducted their in vitro research in a laboratory using human oral cancer cells [5]. They found that punicalagin, total pomegranate tannin extract, and pomegranate juice (PJ) generated from pomegranate husk all exhibited cytotoxic effects on the cancer cells where PJ was the most effective of the three. In the following study, it was determined that the cytotoxic effects of PJ-derived ellagitannins on KB cells were, in fact, validated [161]. Weisburg et al. observed that a pomegranate polyphenol extract that was high in ellagitannin cleaved PARP, boosted caspase-3 activity, and decreased glutathione (GSH) levels in multiple oral cancer cells (HSC-2, CAL-27, and SCC-1483). This was discovered in a research reasonably similar to the one we just discussed in Ref. [205].\n\n5.14. Lung cancer\n\nThe most prevalent kind of cancer-related mortality that may be attributed to the disease is lung cancer. According to the available information in 2016, lung and bronchus tumors were expected to be the cause of 158,080 deaths in the people of the United States [206]. According to the findings of recent investigations, pomegranate fruit ethanol extract (PFE) is able to inhibit the development of malignant cells when they are grown in culture. PFE reduced the number of viable human lung carcinoma epithelial A549 cells. However, it had no effect on normal bronchial epithelial cells. The administration of PFE to A549 cells caused the G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest. This was dose-dependent and linked to the elevation of p27kip1 and p21WAF1, in addition to a decline in cyclins and CDKs expression. In addition, PFE was successful in inhibiting many distinct signaling pathways, including NFB and MAPK [111]. Aqil et al. used punicalagin that was extracted from the pomegranate husk to show that punicalagin has a powerful antioxidant effect by lowering the oxidative DNA product aggregation [124]. He also proved that punicalagin had powerful anti-proliferative activity over lung carcinoma cells. It has been shown that the primary component of pomegranate peel– punicalagin and ellagic acid, possess powerful anti-proliferative activities. Both the A549 and the H1299 lung cancer cell lines exhibited the same level of sensitivity to the compounds under investigation [41]. In recent research, the skin of pomegranate was put through tests to determine whether or not it has anti-proliferative qualities against various cancer cells, including lung cancer cells. The results of this study showed that pomegranate's anti-proliferative capabilities are not limited to the edible fruits but rather much more than that [188]. In a separate experiment, it was shown that pomegranate leaf extract (PLE) has the ability to decrease cell growth in lung cancer cell lines (A549, H1299) as well as mice Lewis lung carcinoma cell line (LL/2). The PLE treatment was able to stop H1299 cells from migrating and invading, which is an indication that the PLE may aid in the prevention of metastasis [40]. PFE's chemopreventive potential was tested in A/J mice with benzo(a)pyrene [B(a)P] and N-nitroso-tris-chloroethylurea (N-nitroso-TCE)-induced lung tumors (NTCU). The number of lung cancers in PFE-treated mice was substantially lower than in B(a)P-treated and NTCU-treated animals. PFE-treated animals displayed decreased NFB, MAPK, and PI3K activation, leading to lower cell proliferation and angiogenesis in the lungs of B(a)P and NTCU-treated mice [43]. According to another study, PFE-treated water reduced tumors in A549-implanted athymic nude mice [111]. When evaluated in a model of B(a)P-induced lung cancer, both punicalagin and ellagic acid were seen to possess significant anti-proliferative and anti-mutagenic properties [41]. These results show that PFE could be used as either a chemopreventive or a chemotherapeutic drug to treat lung cancer in humans. Researchers looking into the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of an aqueous extract of pomegranate peel found that the extract stopped the activity of neutrophil myeloperoxidase (MPO). Even though it did not stop superoxide from being made, it did reduce the inflammation in the lungs of mice that lipopolysaccharide caused. It is possible that the anti-inflammatory effects of pomegranate peel aqueous extract have something to do with its ability to stop MPO from working [44]. Husari et al. looked into how hyperoxia affected the antioxidant activity of pomegranate juice (PJ) [207]. He found that rats exposed to hyperoxia made more ROSs and had more pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 and IL-6) in their lungs. The harmful consequences of hyperoxia were significantly mitigated once PJ was added to people's drinking water. This demonstrates that PJ has powerful anti-inflammatory capabilities, in addition to powerful antioxidant characteristics. PFE was recently proven to have a powerful antioxidant impact when tested on rats that were administered methotrexate. Methotrexate administration resulted in substantial increases in the levels of malondialdehyde, total oxidant status, and the oxidative stress index in both the serum and the lungs of the rats. On the other hand, pretreatment with PFE was able to counteract these effects [208].\n\n6. Human clinical studies\n\nClinical studies on humans have assessed pomegranate. In a four-week study consisting of seventy prostate cancer patients, the extract of pomegranate was able to reduce oxidative stress biomarkers. An example of such a biomarker is 8-hydroxy-20-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG). Pomegranate metabolite was identified in normal and malignant prostate tissue. In normal and cancerous prostate tissue, pomegranate reduced 8-OHdG by 16 and 23%, respectively [209]. Following prostate surgery, drinking pomegranate juice (PJ) at a rate of 8 ounces per day, which is comparable to 570 mg of polyphenol gallic acid, reduced the production of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in men. With PJ treatment, the mean time it took for PSA levels to double increased to 54 months from 15 months. Also, the serum oxidative state was reduced by 40%. Combining the patient's serum with a mammalian PC cell line and incubating the mixture, the results of the experiment indicated that PJ caused a 13% reduction in cell proliferation and a 17% rise in apoptosis nine months after the trial had begun [210]. Because they have few side effects and are rich in phytochemicals, medicinal plants attract a lot of interest from researchers working on the discovery and development of new drugs [211]. Hence, to assess the efficacy and safety of plants and to prepare the way for the development of applicable treatments, clinical studies based on natural products, such as medicinal plants, are helpful [212]. According to a review by Eghbali et al. [213], P. granatum is a good source of bioactive chemicals that can be employed in the creation of novel medications. In order to develop drug delivery and formulation that could be used to treat diabetes, dermatological disorders, and other neuropsychiatric disorders, several clinical studies on the efficacy of P. granatum as a natural product have been conducted and COVID-19 [213,214]. Several clinical studies on the effects of P. granatum and ellagic acid on the metabolic syndrome, cancer (prostate and colorectal), physical activity, skin pigmentation, and sexual hormonal disorders were reviewed in a study by Baradaran Rahimi et al. [215]. Further studies are required, according to the study's findings, to assess the pomegranate's potential for protection and to identify the molecule ellagic acid. A 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) 2,5-diphenyl-2 H-tetrazolium bromide assay was used to compare the cytotoxicity of pomegranate seed oils against colon cancer cell lines and human lung cancer cell lines. Yoghurt prepared from pomegranate seed oil based nanoparticles showed significant cancer lowering properties against HT-29 and A549 cell lines with cell viability in range of 83.3–28.4% and 80.3–25.4%, respectively [216]. In addition, a study by Sun et al. found that fruit peel extracts have anti-cancerous qualities that stop the growth of tumor cells [217]. Another comparative investigation was done by Aumeeruddy and Mahomoodally [218], who assessed the efficiency of fruit extracts, root peels, and fruit rinds on various cancer cells. The present paper compiles and provides an update on pomegranate L's molecular mechanisms, pharmacological properties, and ethnomedicinal usage. The creation of novel natural medications for the treatment of different illnesses will depend heavily on this knowledge in the future [219,220].\n\n7. Comparison of pre-clinical/clinical vs pomegranate/pomegranate compounds: Inhibitory action on STAT-3, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, NF-κB, and MAPK signaling pathways.\n\nSTAT-3 plays an important role in induction of cellular proliferation and apoptotic conditions, therefore, is considered as a central mediator in development of cancer related drugs [221]. Since last couple of decades, development of cancer therapeutics through targeting STAT-3 is being studied extensively, but this area remains mainly unexplored. Generally, disrupting the Src homology-2, N-domain, DNA-binding domain, and transcriptional activation domain to retard the STAT-3 functional dimers formation is a well-known approach in inhibiting STAT-3 [222,223]. Majority of the present inhibitors either natural or synthetic, prevents from tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-3 as they directly attach to Src homology-2 domain inhibit the STAT-3 tyrosine phosphorylation through activation of PTPase (protein tyrosine phosphatase) [224]. Pomegranate extract, which is rich source of punicalagin and ellagic acid, downregulated the phosphorylation of STAT3 at Ser727 and Tyr705, hence led to inactivity of STAT-3 mediated transcription in PC-3 and C4-2 prostate cancer cells [33]. Likewise, ellagic acid momentously inhibited the growth of cervical cancer (HeLa cells) due to induction of apoptotic conditions through downregulation of STAT3 pathway [225]. Moreover, studies have shown photo-chemopreventive potential of pomegranate fruit extract in decreasing the UVA-dependent STAT3 phosphorylation at Tyr705 [226]. shows the comparison of pre-clinical/clinical inhibitors and pomegranate/pomegranate compounds responsible for STAT3 inhibition.\n\nTable 2\n\nInhibitor nameCancerResultsReferencesPre-clinical/clinical STAT3 inhibitorsPY*LKTKNIH3T3/v-SrcInduce apoptosis, reduce cell proliferation, and decrease metastasis[227]StatticBreast cancer[228]IS3-295Colon cancer[229]S3I-1757Lung cancer[230]Breast cancerAZD9150Advanced/metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma[231]AZD0530Melanoma[232]DBD-1Melanoma[233,234]NapabucasinHepatocellular carcinoma[235]Colorectal carcinomaGPA512Prostate cancer[236]Pomegranate STAT3 inhibitorsPomegranate extractProstate cancerReduce metastasis induce apoptosis, and inhibited cell proliferation[33]Ellagic acidCervical cancer[225]Pomegranate fruit extractSkin cancer[226]\n\nPI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway is considered as one of the key pathways responsible for induction of malignancies in cancer patients [237]. PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathways have been reported to be accountable for cellular proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and motility. Therefore, targeting PI3K/AKT/mTOR is being studied as an emergent approach is development of potent cancer therapeutics [[238], [239], [240]]. Downregulation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway is found to inhibit tumor growth [241]. Natural compounds have been reported to target PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway therefore plays a vital role in prevention and treatment of various cancers [242]. Pomegranate and its natural bioactive compounds have found to modulate inflammatory cell signaling through inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway [47]. In PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells, pomegranate juice and peel extract have demonstrated inhibitory effect on cell proliferation due to inhibition of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway [243]. Moreover, pomegranate fruit extract has also found to suppress the lung cancer cell growth by downregulation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways [43]. shows the comparison of pre-clinical/clinical inhibitors and pomegranate/pomegranate compounds responsible for PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibition.\n\nTable 3\n\nInhibitor nameCancerResultsReferencesPre-clinical/clinical PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitorsAZD5363Breast cancerInhibited cell proliferation, induced apoptotic conditions, and Inhibited tumorigenesis[[244], [245], [246]]Prostate cancerGastric cancerCCI-779Renal carcinoma[[247], [248], [249]]Breast cancerGDC0980Advanced solid tumors[250]BKM120Breast cancer[251]CAL-101Leukemia[252,253]B cell malignanciesXL-147Advanced solid tumors[254,255]Advanced endometrial carcinomaPF-04691502Advanced solid tumors[256]Endometrial cancerPomegranate PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitorsPomegranate juiceColon cancerModulated inflammatory cell signaling[47]Pomegranate total tannin extractPunicalaginPomegranate juiceProstate CancerInhibited cell proliferation[243]Pomegranate peel extractPomegranate fruit extractLung cancerInhibited tumorigenesis[43]Pomegranate polyphenolicsBreast cancerReduced inflammation[257]Induced cytotoxicity in cancer cellsPomegranate juiceColon cancerDecreased cell proliferation[42]Urolithin APancreatic CancerReduced cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis[258]\n\nNF-κB signaling pathway is responsible for induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antiapoptotic proteins. In cancer, the NF-κB signaling pathway is activated and is known for increasing the malignancies [259]. On the other hand, activated MAPK signaling pathway is also linked with progression of cancer and drug resistance [260,261]. In cancer therapeutics, suppression of activated NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways is classified as an efficient and promising approach [261,262]. Plant natural constituents are being investigated to reduce the activity of NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways [263,264]. shows the comparison of pre-clinical/clinical inhibitors and pomegranate/pomegranate compounds responsible for inhibition of NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways.\n\nTable 4\n\nInhibitor nameCancerResultsReferencesPre-clinical/clinical NF-κB and MAPK inhibitorsBortezomibLung cancerSuppress inflammation, reduce metastasis, retarded cell proliferation, and induced apoptotic conditions[265,266]BevacizumabLung cancer[267]DabrafenibLung cancer[268]SB202190Gastric cancer[260]TalmapimodMultiple myeloma[260]PimasertibMetastatic pancreatic cancer[269]Pomegranate NF-κB and MAPK inhibitorsTannin rich pomegranate fruit extractSkin cancerInhibits cancer cell proliferation, induce apoptosis, decrease inflammation and metastasis[175]Pomegranate fruit extractSkin cancer[93]Pomegranate fruit extractSkin cancer[177]Pomegranate fruit extractLung cancer[106]Pomegranate fruit extractBreast cancer[270]PunicalaginColon cancer[47]Ellagic acidColorectal cancer[151]\n\n7. Conclusion and future perspectives\n\nDietary nutrients have universal accessibility that possesses the capacity to protect or suppress cancer at a reasonable price. It is indeed an alluring sector of cancer therapy that has captured the attention of fundamental and clinical biologists, as well as the general public. Identifying the core component of nutritional supplements that provides therapeutic advantages and the processes by which they suppress cancer are the biggest challenges. Anticancer research on pomegranate-derived compounds is ongoing. Pomegranate fruit (juice and oil) has been suggested as a chemopreventive or chemotherapeutic drug because it alters signal transduction pathways, resulting in antitumorigenic, anti-proliferative, and anti-inflammatory actions. In vitro and in vivo research on pomegranate can be conducted to identify whether its effects, in combination with those of other substances, are complementary, synergistic, or antagonistic. Together with this, human clinical studies are required to evaluate its in vitro and in vivo antineoplastic effectiveness. Some animal and laboratory studies have already shown that pomegranate may reduce cancer growth [228]. Pomegranate components are cytotoxic and antiproliferative on cancer cells. Pomegranate-based products also suppressed xenografted or chemically-induced tumor growth in mice. Pomegranate phytochemicals may have anti-inflammatory, immune-modulatory, antioxidant, anti-invasive, and antiangiogenic properties, as well as modulate oncosuppressive signaling pathways. According to that research, pomegranate phytochemicals may suppress tumor cell proliferation and reduce tumor genesis and development. Pomegranate phytochemicals work synergistically with their own phytochemicals, other phytochemicals, and even chemotherapeutic medications, delivering greater anticancer activity compared to any single molecule, proving pomegranate's potential as a chemotherapy adjuvant. A clinical study found that oral pomegranate extract increased its active metabolite in colorectal and prostate cancer target organs. Oral pomegranate extract alters cancer-related molecular markers, validating preclinical results. However, it has been shown in several randomized controlled studies that pomegranate treatment does not significantly outperform placebo. Later subgroup research showed that pomegranate treatment might help certain cancer patients more than others. Before concluding, further in vivo and clinical data is needed. We found weaknesses in pomegranate research as well. First, pomegranate phytochemical uptake may hinder therapy. According to clinical studies, the restricted bioavailability of pomegranate phytochemicals after supplementation may explain the difference between preclinical and clinical results. Second, most in vitro studies involve breast, prostate, and GI cancer cells, signaling that additional study is required on pomegranate and other cancers. Few clinical studies have limited sample numbers and cancer aims, and numerous preclinical discoveries (mechanisms and anticancer effects) have not been replicated. In spite of these drawbacks, pomegranate continues to have a great deal of potential as a source of chemo preventive and chemotherapeutic medicine. In vivo and in vitro testing pointed to the safety of pomegranate products. This demonstrates that research on pomegranates may increase the efficacy of conventional chemotherapy while simultaneously deducing its negative side effects. We urge further investigation into discovering other anticancer molecular targets of pomegranate to explain its anticancer benefits, identifying the synergistic effects of its phytochemicals as an anticancer agent, comparing the effects of pomegranate across many organ systems, and performing randomized clinical trials with bigger sample sizes. Additionally, modified drug delivery methods, inclusive of nanoparticles, nano emulsions, and liposomes, as well as novel formulations, should be adopted to enhance the rate of phytochemical absorption [229]. According to this study, pomegranate components show prospective as chemo preventive and chemotherapeutic medicines. Future researchers must build on prior experiments to properly comprehend the medicinal potential of this complex fruit in fighting cancer.\n\nAuthor contribution statement\n\nAll authors listed have significantly contributed to the development and the writing of this article.\n\nData availability statement\n\nData will be made available on request.\n\nDeclaration of competing interest\n\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nFunding for open access charge: Universidade de Vigo/CISUG.\n\nReferences\n\n1.
