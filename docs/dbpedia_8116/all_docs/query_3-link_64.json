        "text": "Srijit Mukherjee and Chiranjit Chakravarty promoted Chatuskon in Zee Mirakkel Program.\n\nSrijit Mukherjee and Chiranjit Chakravarty stormed Zee Bangla Mirakkel Program. On 6th October, 2014, Mir Afsar Ali and the entire team of Zee Bangla Mirakkel Program invited director Srijit Mukherjee and Bengali superstar Chiranjit Chakravarty in the program. In the same program the film Chatushkon was promoted. The great thing about the film Chatuskon was that renowned directors were taken in the film. The film had been released on 26th September, 2014. It has been directed by Srijit Mukherjee. The renowned directors who acted in the film included Aparna Sen, Chiranjit Chakravarty, Goutam Ghosh and others. Parambrata Chatterjee played an important role in the film. The music had been composed by Anupam Roy. In the show Mir Afsar Ali asked the question to Srijit Mukherjee about his experience of working with a veteran actor like Chiranjit Chakravarty. He said that he had not seen such a sporting person like Chiranjit Chakravarty in his life. Everyone in the sets of Chatuskon had the habit of imitating the style of dialogue throwing of Chiranjit. One day when the crew members were telling his famous dialogue, “bou gele bou pawoya jai re pagla, maa gele maa pawoya jai na,” he entered the sets. He said the word pagla, meaning mad person was added by the followers. In his dialogue he never used the word pagla. But he laughed at everyone. Mir was so moved by the experience that he asked all the judges Rajatavo Dutta, Paran Banerjee and Srilekha Mitra to tell the dialogue “bou gele bou pawoya jai re pagla, maa gele maa pawoya jaina.” Everyone said the dialogues in their own way. Both Srijit Mukherjee and Chiranjit Chakravarty admired the performances of the contestants of Mirakkel. Mir and the judges wished their best for the success of the film Chatuskon saying that it was great credit of Srijit Mukherjee to cast legends in the film.\n\nApurbo Roy performance as Joddha in Zee Bangla Mirakkel Program was awesome.\n\nApurbo Roy stormed Zee Bangla Mirakkel Program. On 14th October, 2014, Apurbo Roy, one of the veterans of Zee Bangla Mirakkel Program gave a remarkable performance. He was the star performer and performed at the end. Apurbo Roy played the character of Joddha meaning warrior. Recently Deb (Deepak Adhikari) with Mimi acted in the film Joddha which was related the life of a warrior. Apurbo Roy borrowed the concept from there but gave a comedy angle to the entire play. He said that he had 4 brothers borda, mejda, chorda and joddha. Two children gave a remarkable performance with the subject of selling joynagarer moya. They did a marvelous job. The judge Paran Banerjee appreciated their accent which was said in the places Jessore and Khulna and it sounds very sweet. The other judges Rajatavo Dutta and Srilekha Mitra also appreciated their performance. An old performer Mr Dhar did a great job. He always made a signature entry by saying “namakar, namaskar, namaskar and namaskar, ekti meye”. Mir Afsar Ali, the anchor of the show, imitated him. Mr Dhar had wit of his own. He made the signature entry and then said the joke was over. Incidentally he won the prize of the best performer along with a performer of Bankura. One lady also did a great job by showing a play related to dieting. She said when Srilekha Mitra was asked what type of dieting she did, she answered see food diet. Meaning whatever came before her eyes, she ate them. Everyone laughed at the remark. Mir told everyone that they were flying to the Moon in a comedy andaz. He anchored the program very well.\n\nRekha Bhardwaj came to Zee Bangla Saregamapa Program in October, 2014.\n\nRekha Bhardwaj stormed Zee Bangla Saregamapa Program. Rekha Bhardwaj was invited as guest judge in Zee Bangla Saregamapa Program on 25th October, 2014. She was the additional judge in addition to the judges Kumar Shanu, Alka Yagnik and Hariharan. The participants sang excellent songs on 25th October. Alka Yagnik in her comment mentioned the way the contestants performed it became difficult for them to eliminate anyone. Kumar Shanu was so pleased with the singing of the contestants that he went on giving Goggles and Sunglasses to the contestants. One of the contestants sang Manna Dey’s song “Jodi kagoje lekho naam kagaj ure jabe”. It was a song with a lot of emotions. The contestant did justice to the song. Another contestant sang Manna Dey’s song ‘baje go bina” from the film Marjina Abdulla, composed by Salil Choudhury. There was huge amount of classical touch in the song. The contestant did well too. One of the contestants sang Shyamal Mitra’s song “jiban khatar proti patay jotoi lekho hishab nikash kichui robena” from the film Deya Neya. It was composed by Shyamal Mitra himself. The contestant did well. Other contestants sang songs like “zaara zaara” which were difficult to sing. Jishu Sengupta and the contestants requested Rekha Bhardwaj to sing her hit songs. She sang the song “sasural genda phool” from the film Dilli 6. She also sang the song “fakira maan ja” from the film Yeh Jawaani Hai Diwani. Everyone were moved with her presentation. She was also requested to sing the song “namak ishq ka” from the film Omkara. It was composed by Vishal Bhardwaj. She also sung the song “phir le aya dil majbur kya kije” from the film Barfi. Pritam composed the music and Rekha Bhardwaj made everyone mesmerized with the performance.\n\nHappy New Year made great start in 2014.\n\nShahrukh Khan every year comes up with a new blockbuster and breaks all the records. Last year Chennai Express broke all the records. In 2014, Salman Khan’s Kick had the record of doing business of 235 crores and ended up being blockbuster. Hrithik Roshan’s Bang Bang was second blockbuster doing business of 180 crores. But Shahrukh Khan’s Happy New Year did business worth 108 crores in 3 days. The Diwali festival helped Shahrukh Khan for the success. The film had been been produced by Gauri Khan and directed by Farah Khan. The music of the film had been composed by Vishal Shekhar. In the film Jackie Shroff wrongly implicated Anupam Kher, the father of Shahrukh in robbery case, where the locker was made by Anupam Kher. Jackie bribed the witnesses and won the case and Anupam Kher committed suicide. Shahrukh Khan hatched a plan to rob the Shalimar Diamond from Jackie Shroff’s locker in Dubai. So made a team with Sonu Sood, Deepika Padukone, Abhishek Bacchan, Boman Irani and Vivaan Shah. They participated in an international dance competition and took the help of a bard dancer played by Deepika Padukone. Computer was hacked to get the final entry and they went to the final in Dubai. The planned operation worked out. Dubai police arrested Jackie Shroff. Deepika Padukone did not leave the dance floor and everyone reluctantly danced with her and India won the competition. The entire film had been Shahrukh Khan show. At time Farah Khan had been repetitive. Boman Irani’s parsi acting now had become repetitive. Sonu Sood was used but few comedy things like making him deaf from one year was unnnecesary. As Farah Khan herself was a famous choreographer, she had the scope of showing brilliant dancing by different dance groups across the world. The dance performances of the Koreans and other groups were not that impressive. But the fight sequences were good, specially the action of Shahrukh Khan with Korean dancer on rooftop of skyscraper in Dubai. If story and direction is examined Bang Bang had a better story compared to Happy New Year. But Shahrukh Khan has his own committed fan base, that superstar charisma made the difference and Happy New Year has the potential of breaking the records of Dhoom 3 as well.\n\nIn 2014 Amrita Chatterji Biswanath Basu came to promote Janla Diye Bou Palalo in Mirakkel.\n\nAmrita Chatterjee, Biswanath Basu, Arjun, Manashi rocked Mirakkel Program.

All the celebrities appreciated the participants in Mirakkel and the judges Rajatavo Dutta, Srilekha Mitra and Paran Banerjee wished best of the luck for the upcoming film Janla Diye Bou Palalo.\n\nRabin Majumdar was successful as a hero but his singing skills were equally good.\n\nRobin Majumdar was successful both as actor and singer. Robin Mojumdar was a very successful singer of the 1940s and 1950s. His basic discs were very romantic and became popular. Eminent composer Robin Chatterjee composed landmark songs for Robin Majumdar. The song “ amar adhar gharer pradip” and “mor premogan” had beautiful melody. Robin Mojumdar sang the song very well. The use of piano by Robin Chatterjee was brilliant. Also Robin Chatterjee composed song “ami rajanigandhar moto” was liked by the audience.

The other hit songs of Robin Mojumdar in Bengali films include “nabik amar ogo nabik amar”, “dekha holo kon logone” to name a few. He acted with many heroines of that time including Sandha Rani. In the mid-1950s Uttam Kumar, Basanta Choudhury, Asit Boron, Bikash Roy came up as the other heroes of Bengali films. Robin Mojumdar from the role of hero switched of to character roles. But his acting performance was at par with the other actors. He did a great job opposite Asit Boron in the film Joydeb. He also acted very well in the role of a bayul singer in Basanta Choudhury’s film Bodhu in 1962. Premendra Mitra, an eminent author of the Kollol era directed few of the films in which stories were written by him. He directed the film Chupi Chupi Ashe.

On a rainy day the house got flooded and the criminal went on killing guests one after the other. At the end of the film it was found that the investigating officer played by Tarun Kumar was the actual villain and the murderer. The film stood out as one of the brilliant crime thriller films of the late 1950s. When Robin Majumdar attended old age, Oscar winning director Satyajit Ray gave him a good role in the film Hirak Rajar Deshe. He gave lips in the song “kotoi ranga dekhi duniyay, o bhai re”. His films and the songs require restoration.\n\nIn end of 2014, Sudesh Bhosle stormed Zee Bangla Saregama Program\n\nSudesh Bhosle stormed Zee Bangla Saregamapa Program.

He imitated the deep voice of Hemant Kumar and made the crowd spell bound. He also sang one of the songs of SD Burman in style. After the songs were sung by Sudesh Bhosle he was asked to imitate big actors. He acted the way Asrani had acted and used the lyrics of the song “yashoda ka nandlala” for acting in the manner of Asrani. The he imitated Sanjeev Kumar in the style he delivered his dialogue in the film Aandhi. Then he imitated Amitabh Bacchan both in the song “shawa shawa” and also told the dialogues of Agneepath. One of the participants sang Manna Dey’s song and everyone appreciated his effort.

He was born on 11th May, 2050. He was brought up in Ahmednagar. In 1981 he acted in the play Hands Up. He was a great break by director Govind Nihalini in the film Ardh Satya in 1983. He acted in the role of a Mafia Don and balanced the brilliant performances of other stalwarts like Om Puri and Amrish Puri. He also received the filmfare best supporting actor award for the performance in the film Ardh Satya. From that time onwards his image as a villain was recognized. He played notable characters in Jackie Shroff Film Teri Meherbaniya, Amitabh Bacchan’s film Akhree Rasta, Amitabh Bacchan’s film Indrajeet, to name a few. In 1991 his performance in Sanjay Dutt’s film Sadak in role of a eunuck Maharani, made him a big star. The negative role not only gave him the filmfare award for the best villain in the same year but created a new dimension in the world of negative roles. He also acted in many relief roles and comedy roles. In films like Amir Khan’s Ishq, Bobby Deol’s Gupt, Akshay Kumar Sunil Shetty’s Mohra he played positive roles and comedy characters. His ease in respect of getting into the character of the different models helped me to get important character roles for more than 30 years. The list of his successful films are very long. Right from Dil Ne Phir Yaad Kiya to Khatarnak, Insaniyat to Mohra, Janam Samjha Karo to Ankhe. The list of heroes against whom he played the role of villains is also very long including Salman Khan, Amir Khan, Sanjay Dutt, Bobby Deol, Amitabh Bacchan, Sunny Deol, Anil Kapoor, Jackie Shroff, Mithun Chakravarty and others.

The 20th Kolkata International Film Festival 2014, started off with a brilliant inauguration in Netaji Indoor Stadium on 10th November, 2014. It was a brilliant occasion by every standard. Mamta Banerjee, the Chief Minister of West Bengal managed to invite the major dignitaries from different parts of the world and especially India. The 8 day film festival started with the inauguration on 10th November, 2014. The legends who graced the occasion included Amitabh Bacchan, Jaya Bacchan, Aishwarya Rai Bacchan, Abhishek Bacchan, Tanuja, Shahrukh Khan and many others. The August gathering also saw Bengali legends like Ranjit Mullick, Madhabi Mukherjee, Moushumi Chatterjee, Moonmoon Sen and others. Shahrukh Khan in his short speech made sure that he could say something in Bengali. This is the third time he had inaugurated a film festival and he said in his own words that honest creation is what the spectators expect from the creators. Amitabh Bacchan gave an extended speech. He did huge homework for that. He emphasized on women empowerment. He mentioned that both in Bengali films and hindi films, the directors and writers emphasized on women’s social standing. Sarat Chandra Chatterjee’s Parineeta, Biraj Bahu told the same. Tagore’s stories also reflected them. While directors like Bimal Roy with films like Bandini, Sujata, Mehboob Khan with films like Mother India showed women’s individuality in Indian society, renowned Bengali directors like Satyajit Ray in his films Charulata, Pather Panchali had showed the different facets of women characters and also it was shown in films of other giants like Tapan Sinha who showed it in films like Jotugriha. Amitabh Bacchan’s speech was par excellence. Australian Filmmaker Paul Cox gave a brilliant speech explaining the importance of film festivals which brings expression of different countries and connects the countries together. Amol Palekar, Irfan Khan, Tanuja, Jaya Bacchan all congratulated the Bengali audience and the love for films in Bengal. Mamta Banerjee invited everyone and talked about the film festival showing films of 60 countries in Kolkata for the next 8 days. She also said what Bengal thinks today India thinks tomorrow.

Actress June Maliya and Sayani Ghosh came to Zee Bangla Mirakkel Program to promote their new film Ekla Cholo. Incidentally the film was also shown in Zee Bangla Cinema on 18th January. 2015. Director Sudeshna Roy also came in the show to tell the story of the film Ekla Cholo. The film had been directed jointly by Sudeshna Roy and Abhijit Guha. It has produced by Nideas Creations and Production Pvt. Ltd. Sayani Ghosh played the lead role in the film. She portrayed the character of a single mother. June Maliya played the role of the mother of Sayani Ghosh who was also a single mother. But significantly it had been a comedy film. Thinking about single mother, the first impression which into mind is that the film must have talked about struggle of a mother. But it was not the case. When Mir Afsar Ali asked Sudeshna Roy to tell the story of the film, she said Sayani Ghosh wanted to be a single mother without marrying any male husband. So she searched sperm donors and with artificial implant became pregnant and gave birth to a child. But in the process she got a lot of help from her boyfriend played by Koushik Roy. So eventually Sayani Ghosh came to know about her father and the husband of June Maliya and agreed to marry Koushik Roy after giving birth to the baby. All the judges in the show namely Paran Banerjee, Rajatavo Dutta and Srilekha Mitra appreciated the unique subject of the film. They also said that Sudeshna Roy always had done good work and she made the team of artists act very well in the film. The film had been released and is expected to do good business.\n\nDev, Koel and others promoted Herogiri in Zee Bangla Dadagiri Program\n\nDev, Koel and others came in Zee Bangla Dadagiri Program to promote film Herogiri. The entire team of Bengali film Herogiri came in Sourav Ganguly’s Dadagiri Program on 21st January, 2015. Actress Sayantani Banerjee, Bharat Kaul, and the script writer of the film came in the program. Sourav Ganguly asked Dev about the experience of acting with Mithun Chakravarty in the film. Incidentally Mithun Chakravarty played the role of the father of Dev in the film. Dev said in reply that Mithun Chakravarty was one of the brightest international Bengali icon. He also said Mithun Chakravarty during the peak of his career he acted in Bengali films and restored the profits of the industry. Sourav Ganguly asked Dev, Koel, Sayantani and others who is the boss in respect of film making, is it the director or the producer? All of them replied in the sets the actors, actresses follow the directives of the directors, in shooting zones and discussion relating to projects producers also play important role. This film Herogiri had been shot at different places including Kolkata, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Paris and Bangkok. When asked by Sourav Ganguly who dictates the actors fees, the actors or the producers, Dev and Koel gave reasonable answers. Whenever actors wanted to act in films of reputed directors they ignored the payment and acted with low remuneration also. Sourav Ganguly asked Koel after giving a clipping of song “pagla garod kothae ache nei ko setha jana” in Rankit Mullick and Uttam Kumar’s film Mouchak, the name of the film and the singer. Koel gave right answer saying the song being sung by Manna Dey and name of the film being Mouchak. Dev became the champion at the end of the show. Sourav Ganguly gave his best wishes and told everyone to continue the good work.\n\nRaqib and Rafi should have been the actual champtions of Zee Bangla Mirakkel 8 Finals.\n\nRaqib and Rafi should have been champions of Zee Bangla Mirakkel 8 Finals. The Zee Bangla Mirakkel Program 8 end on 8th February, 2015 with a colourful final. Eminent singer Hariharan glorified the finals with his excellent singing. Hariharan sang super hit songs like “tu hi re” from the film Bombay. He sat in the guest judges chair as on of the visiting judges in addition to the existing judges Paran Banerjee, Rajatavo Dutta and Sreelekha Mitra. Eminent singer and composer Jeet Ganguly also came and sang his super hit songs. But the judgement in the finals was wrong. The child contestants Raqib and Rafi were best. Inspite of that they were not selected as the best 3 finalists. Kaju became first, Parash became the first runners and Imon, Sandeep and Aniket shared the second runner up prize. Generally two types of performers perform in laughter shows and comedy shows. One category includes the performers who have strong script and make people laugh with the content. The other category acts out characters to impress the audience. The performers of the second category require more talent. Raqib and Rafi were probably the best actors in the show. They played out different characters and always did justice to them. Imon and Sandeep were the other two actors who always experimented with new roles. It is shocking that they became third. Kaju used to imitate Mridul Bhattacharya and always spoke on jokes relating to a drunkard. Just because his style was effortless who got the best prize. Always it had happened during the history of Mirakkel that the performers who were liked by the audience the most never got the first prize. Apurbo Roy was a sensation. He never won any title. Palash Adhikari was brilliant. He never won any title.\n\nViewers should see Sriman Satyawadi for excellence of Raj Kapoor and Shakila.\n\nRaj Kapoor and Shakila were brilliant in Shriman Satyawadi. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, due to high box office of blockbusters, the hit films did not get that recognition. For example, in 1960, Raj Kapoor’s film Shriman Satywadi was released. Due to super hit box office report of Jis Desh Me Ganga Behti Hai and all time blockbuster Dilip Kumar’s Mugha-i- azam, Shriman Satyawadi got lost in the crowd of brilliant films. But the film was successful. SM Abbas directed the film. Mahipatray Shah produced the film. The music was composed by Dattaram. Raj Kapoor was shown as an honest man whose father was an honest medicine seller. His father was falsely implicated by Mehmood’s father Radhakrishan. He deliberately kept narcotic drugs in his shop so that police could arrest him. He got a heart attack and died. Raj Kapoor was brought up by his neighbor uncle who send him to industrialist Nazir Hussain for job in Mumbai. Nazir Hussain and his daughter Shakila allowed Raj Kapoor to work in their advertisement company. Mehmood joined the same company and created a cream and pharmaceutical products which adulterated content. Consumers got skin diseases and one person died. Raj Kapoor left the company and did other jobs and finally worked as journalist in the Newspaper company owned by Moni Chatterjee. In the last scene Raj Kapoor went with Moni Chatterjee in the house of Radhakrishan to tell the truth relating to adulterated products. His son Mehmood shot a bullet on Moni Chatterjee. In a tassle with Raj Kapoor, Mehmood fell in an acidic pool and died. The film proved that honesty was the right policy. The music of the film became super hit. Mukesh’s songs “haal-e-dil hamara”, “ai dil dekhe hai humne” became bumper hit. Rafi’s song “rang birangi botal ka kaisa hai jadoo” was as big hit as Suman Kalyanpur’s song “kyun ura jata hai anchal” and Manna Dey’s bheegi “hawaano me” as well as Mahendra Kumar’s song “ek baat kahoon vallah”. Dattaram’s music was as brilliant as lyrics of Hasrat Jaipuri. Mehmood in a comedy cum villainish role was impressive. Nazir Hussain and Radhakrishan played very impressive roles. Raj Kapoor probably acted only in one film opposite Shakila. Both the artists matched each other. They should have been cast in more roles. The film and the music require restoration.\n\nIt was sad that Detective Byomkesh Bakshi did low business but Sushant and Dibakar Banerjee did a great job.\n\nSushant and Dipakar Banerjee were excellent in Detective Byomkesh Bakshi. Director Dibakar Banerjee started with a bang in the film Detective Byomkesh Bakshi. The film had been released recently and is doing extremely well. With Yash Raj Productions the film was shot in Kolkata and had a medium budget. On the first day the film did business of 7 crores. If the film can finally do business of 50 crores it will be a successful film. Saradindu Banerjee’s character Byomkesh Bakshi is known to everyone in India. Satyajit Ray used superstar Uttam Kumar to play the role of Detective Byomkesh Bakshi in the film Chiriakhana in 1967. Basu Chatterjee used Rajat Kapoor to play the role of Byomkesh Bakshi for Doordarshan. Anjan Dutta used Abir Chatterjee for three different films related to Byomkesh Bakshi. Recently Dipankar Banerjee had got a new Byomkesh in the form of Sushant Singh Rajput related to the Saradindu Banerjee’s story of Satyaneshi and Pather Kanta. In the film the story reveals Kolkata of 1940s. It was during the 2nd world War. Byomkesh completed studies. At that time he found his friend Ajit’s father missing who was a chemist. Ajit was played by Anand Tiwari. Ajit’s father created a new version of heroine which could be mixed in pan masala but not detected till it entered the blood of human being. Dr Anukul Guha instigated him to create it. In the film the role of Dr Anukul Guha was played by Neeraj Kabi. Then Ajit’s father was killed. Satyawati’s mesho was also killed after that. It was because the dead body of Ajit’s father was kept in the factory of Satyawati’s mesho. In this film the role of Satyawati was played by Divya Menon. Swastika Mukherjee played the role of Anguri Devi. She loved Dr Anukul Guha. Under his instruction she set poison in the soup of Satyawati’s mesho and killed him. Byomkesh unearthed the mystery. He found that the drug racket run by Young Chang from Shanghai operated in Kolkata as well. Dr Anukul Guha created a plan whereby he had given information to the Japanesh soldiers to penetrate into Kolkata from the Ganga ghats, in return he could dominate the drug racket to transport drugs via waterways across South East Asia. For achieving his target he befooled the Chinese mafias, Japanese soldiers and even the British Deputy Commissioner played by Mark Bennington. Byomkesh found the deadbodies of related persons including a student and a Japanese lady teacher, all killed by Dr Anukul Guha. At the end Byomkesh called all the parties and disclosed the truth and left Dr Anukul before the drug peddlars before he killed Anguri Devi. The performance of Neeraj Kabi was the best. He terrified and astonished everyone with his weird performance. Sushant Singh Rajput was excellent in his role. His eyebrows were joined together to give a detective’s look. Swastika Mukherjee did a great job for her seductive role. Chang did well for his role in the China Town within Kolkata. Divya Menon and Anand Tiwari were impressive in their roles. The entire credit goes to the director Dipakar Banerjee who had a herculean task of reproducing Kolkata of 1940s. The trams of those days, the vintage cars gave a vintage look to the city at the time of 2nd World War. Viewers should watch the film.\n\nKumar Shanu gave excellent interview before Dev Shankar Halder in April, 2015.\n\nKumar Shanu gave excellent interview in Zee Bangla Happy Parents Day Program. Kumar Shanu, the successful Bengali singer was the guest in the program Zee Bangla Happy Parents Day on 24th April, 2015. He gave a splendid interview before Devshankar Halder. Kumar Shanu firstly appreciated Zee Bangla’s effort to organize a great program which pays tributes to parents of different individuals. There had not been any program like this before. He then said that he had seen many people worshipping different Gods by using flowers, fruits and incense sticks. But he realized that there is no bigger God than father and mother in life. So he worshiped his father Kedarnath Bhattacharya and mother. He said his father Kedarnath Bhattacharya was a great Bengali singer. But he was very strict person. He got a lot of beating in his childhood. But he understood his father’s love for him. When Shanu became a superstar in Mumbai between 1989 to 1995 he took his father and mother in helicopter and showed every part of Mumbai flying at low distance. He took his mother in flight and when she held his hand once the flight took over, he said the memory was so grand. He said whenever his father used to scold him in the morning, when he returned back at night he used to wake up Shanu and give him rasogolla. Shanu could realize the immense love of his father and mother in life. He said that he grew up in extreme poverty. But he rose to fame with the blessings of father and mother. He had only one grief that he could not save his parents when they were hospitalized. He himself was not a doctor. He spend money for best treatment. But lifespan is determined by God so he could do nothing. He also said that whenever his father used to ask him to help a poor person he did so. Once his father asked him to pay a needy person one lakh rupees. He did so. In the program the two old gentleman and lady were neighbours of him, not his own parents. He played for them. They had a daughter who lived at a distance. Both the old persons lived in an old age home. Shanu gave right answers one after the other and earned money for the medical treatment of the these parents and tour of Goa for the old persons. Shanu sang a number of his hit songs including “kuch na kaho kuch bhi na kaho”, “tujhe dekha to yeh jana sanam”, to name a few. The old couple blessed Kumar Shanu. Dev Shankar Halder said the new generation should learn a lot from Kumar Shanu.\n\nRemembering Satyajit Ray on 2nd May, 2016.\n\nRemembering Satyajit Ray on 2nd May, 2016. Viewers of international films all across the world remember Oscar Winning Director Satyajit Ray on his birth anniversary on 2nd May and death anniversary 23rd April, 2016. Ray was born on 2nd May, 1921, and critics feel it was the birth of legend of legends and probably one of the greatest talents the world has ever produced after Rabindranath Tagore. Ray showed his excellence in every different of film making including script writing, costumes, music direction, costume designing, etc. My father, Chitta Ranjan Chatterji, Ex-Chief Public Prosecutor, Bankshall Court, North, Calcutta, represented Sandip Ray, the son of Satyajit Ray, in a case relating to recovery of manuscripts from Uday Acharya, the brother of Nirmal Acharya, a renowned critic. When the manuscripts of Ray’s films were seized from Udai Acharya’s house and opened from sealed trunk it was seen that they were pictographic in nature. Script of the film Pather Panchali, Gonoshotru had illustrations at every part which showed the secret of Ray’s brilliant characterization in films. Probably some of the actors and actresses in Ray’s films rose to stardom through the images portrayed by Ray. Chabi Biswas mesmerized the film lovers with his dignified performance in the role of Bishambhar Roy in the film Jalsaghar. Charu Prakash Ghosh was unparallel in the role of Birinchibaba in the film Kapurush Mahapurush. Anil Chatterji was unparallel in the role of Post Master in the film Teen Kanya. Utpal Dutt gave his performance for his life in the character Maganlal Meghraj in the film Joy Baba Felunath. Similarly Om Puri and Smita Patil were sublime in their roles in the film Sadgati. Sanjeev Kumar entered the skin of the character played in the film Shatranj Ki Khiladi. Uttam Kumar could not have been replaced by any other actor in the film Nayak. Karuna Banerjee had made the role of mother of Apu immortal in the film Pather Panchali. Sharmila Tagore was outstanding in the film Debi. Tapen Chatterji and Robi Ghosh are still remembered by filmlovers through their character Goopi Bagha. All the Indian directors like Shyam Benegal, Adoor Gopalakrishnan ,had agreed that they learnt the art of story-telling from Ray’ films. Even the theme music of the legendary director had moved the directors all across the world. Audrey Hepburn, the Oscar winning actress while awarding the Oscar award for lifetime contribution of Ray, said in her speech that Ray’s direction had the soul of Apu in the Apu Trilogy march out from the village of West Bengal and explored India and expressed the struggle for existence of every middle-class individual of the country. Whenever classic literature of novelists and writers were used in films, Ray created his own dimension in those films, including the standard of excellence in the films Charulata and Ghare Baire which were based on the epic literature of Tagore. Films made by Ray from his own literature like Sonar Kella, Joy Baba Felunath, Agantuk, etc., were equally brilliant. The films of Ray should be preserved to disseminate the art of script writing, costume designing, theme music, camera work, neat direction, etc. Satyajit Ray is remembered on 23rd April, 2012, his death anniversary. Oscar winning Director Satyajit Ray had been remembered all over the country on 23rd April, 2012. He had died on this day in 1992 at the age of 71 years. He was considered to be a legend of legends. Right from his first film Pather Panchali he changed the world of story telling in Indian films. He used classic literature of noted novelists like Rabindranath Tagore, Munshi Premchand, Bibhutibhushan Banerjee, Tarashankar Banerjee, and others and created a new dimension in the films with those classic stories. He changed the views of directors from shooting within studios and ventured out and captured the different moods of nature. He made crime thrillers like Joy Baba Felunath, Sonar Kella which were written by him and became popular with the children with the name of Feluda series. His use of theme music in films had been a learning experience for noted directors of the 70s like Shyam Benegal, Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Govind Nihalini and others. His Apu Trilogi showed the path of a middle-class Indian who travelled the roads of villages and ventured into the urbanized town. Most of his films including Pather Panchali, Jalsaghar, Teen Kanya, Mahanagar, Nayak, were masterpieces. His films and literature should be preserved for their immense artistic value. A big section of intellectuals feel that he was the greatest creator in India to have born after Rabindranath Tagore. His Son Sandip Ray had directed many of the films based on his father’s literature including Bombaiyer Bombete, Tintoretor Jishu, Royal Bengal Rahasya, etc.\n\nHappy birth anniversary to Manna Dey.\n\nHappy birth anniversary to Manna Dey. The viewers of bollywood films and music lovers all across the country wish happy birthday to Manna Dey on 1st May 2016.

He was awarded the dadasaheb phalke award for his immense contribution to music in India. Manna Dey learned music from Ustad Aman Ali Khan and Ustad Abdul Rahman Khan. He stormed bollywood films with super hit songs in Raj Kapoor’s film Shree 420 in 1955, with immortal songs composed by Shankar Jaikishan like “ramaiya vasta maiyya”, “pyar hua ikraar hua”, “mur mur ke na dekh”. During the golden Manna Dey was probably the only singer other than Mohammad Rafi who had been used by all the leading composers of bollywood music including Shankar Jaikishan in Basant Bahar, the song being “sur na saje”, Madanmohan in Dekh Kabira Roya, the song being “kaun aya mere man ke sware”, Roshan in Dil Hi To Hai, the song being “laga chunari me daag”, SD Burman in Meri Surat Teri Ankhen, the song being “pucho na kaise”, to name a few. Manna Dey had a very sweet relationship with Sudhin Dasgupta. He was used by almost all the leading composers of Bengal namely Anil Bagchi, Nochiketa Ghosh, Salil Choudhury and others. But probably his westernized andaz was used to the limit by Sudhin Dasgupta. Sudhin Dasgupta used Manna Dey in Uttam Kumar’s film Goli Theke Rajpoth with the song “lag lag lag lag bhelkir khela”. Manna Dey’s songs “ami agantuk” and “ke prothom kache esechi” composed by Sudhin Dasgupta in Uttam Kumar’s film Shankhabela created sensation in Bengali celluloid in 1966. Manna Dey’s songs “ami kon pothe je choli” and “bachao ke acho” in Uttam Kumar’s film Choddobeshi became super hit as well. In the 70s, Manna Dey’s songs “esechi ami esechi”, “lekha porata shikhe phele” and “paye paye joriye rakho” in Uttam Kumar’s film Har Mana Har created sensation as well. Uttam Kumar gave the lips of his lifetime in the film Har Mana Har. While major success of Sudhin Dasgupta came in Uttam Kumar’s films, he made major contribution in Soumitra Chatterji’s films as well. The songs “ei shohor theke aro anek dure”, “hoyto tomari jonyo”, “jibone ki pabona” in the film Teen Bhubaner Pare, composed by Sudhin Dasgupta and sung by Manna Dey showed the westernized orchestration of the giant composer. Sudhin Dasupta’s songs in Soumitra’s films Prothom Kodom Phul and Bosonto Bilaap were equally successful. Manna Dey’s all round musical skills were used to perfection in these films. Even the song “ogo tomar sesh bichare asay” sung by Manna Dey in bayul andaz in Kali Banerjee’s legendary film Dak Horkora, and composed by Sudhin Dasgupta made the viewers speechless. Manna Dey sang many numbers of solo numbers as basic discs under the compositions of Sudhin Dasgupta. One of the notable songs included “ami taar thikana rakhini”. The songs of Sudhin Dasgupta and Manna Dey combination should be preserved and restored. Music-lovers wish Manna Dey to continue singing till his last day of life.\n\nIn 2015 Shahid Kapoor won the best actor Star Guild Awards.\n\nShahid Kapoor won best actor award in Star Guild Awards 2015.

It was a great gesture of Filmfare group to award her.\n\nThe film Maine Pyar Kyun Kiya was a trend setter.\n\nThe film Maine Pyar Kyun Kiya was a trend setter. The film Maine Pyar Kyun Kiya was another brilliant venture of David Dhawan. It was a multi-starrer film produced by Sohail Khan. Three sets of pairs were experimented with in the year 2005, and from that time onwards it has become a trend setter. The actors and actresses who performed in the film included Salman Khan, Katrina kaif , Sushmita Sen ,Sohail Khan, Arshad Warsi , Isha Koppikar, Rajpal Yadav and others. Salman Khan was an orthopedic surgeon in the film. He had an affair with Katrina Kaif, who was a model. To stop the female patients from flirting with him, Salman told everyone that he was married. Katrina also believed in the fact. She asked Salman Khan to introduce her with his wife. He convinced Sushmita Sen, his nurse, to pretend as his wife. Sushmita met Katrina with two children of her relative and spoke about her relationship with Salman. Katrina thought the children were Salman’s children and wanted to meet them. When the children were introduced Katrina came to know that her previous wife had a boy friend. Then she wanted to meet him and for that matter Salman Khan had to ask Arshad Warsi to act with Sushmita Sen. Then came the artificial divorce scene, where Salman Khan’s mother stepped in from Punjab and accepted Sushmita Sen as the wife of Salman Khan. At the end of the film Sushmita Sen went to Karina Kaif and told the truth. Katrina asked Salman Khan to marry Sushmita Sen who agreed to pretend as his wife. Katrina Kaif married Sohail Khan who was struggling actor in the film. The entire story was depicted with comedy sequences. Himmesh Reshamiya’s music composition was very impressive. All the songs in the film became super hits including “just chill chill”, “saajan, tumse pyar ki larayi me”, “teri meri love story ka angle”, etc. Sonu Nigam, Udit Narayan and other singers contributed well in the film. The performance of Rajpal Yadav in the role of soldier who lost his legs in Cargill War requires special mention. Rajpal Yadav’s legs were normal, yet he used to come to Salman Khan’s clinic only to meet Sushmita Sen. He helped Salman Khan to reach the airport to stop Sushmita Sen to leave the country at the end of the film. Arshad Warsi’s acting as lawyer in the divorce scene was phenomenal. Isha Koppikar did not get proper scope of dialogue throwing in the film but her dance performance in the song “saajan, tujhse pyar ki ladayi me” was very impressive. The performance of Salman Khan’s mother by the actress who was also an Officer in the Ministry of Tourism, Rajasthan was extraordinary. Katrina Kaif and Sushmita Sen looked the beautiful in the film if compared with any other film in their career. Sohail Khan spend most of his career in production and direction of films, but in respect of his performance probably he did his best in the comedy role which was as important as Salman’s role. Day by day Salman Khan also has matured as a good comedian, because these days producers and directors rank him after Anil Kapoor and Govinda, whenever they think about comedy films. David Dhawan should continue with brilliant ventures like Maine Pyar Kyun Kiya in future also.\n\nHappy birthday to Jaya Bacchan.\n\nHappy birthday to Jaya Bacchan. The viewers of bollywood films wish happy birthday to Jaya Bacchan on 9th April, 2016. She was considered to be one of the most powerful actresses of films during the 70s and 80s. Her effortless performance in different types of roles had inspired other actresses to follow her later on. Jaya Bacchan started her career with an impressive role in Satyajit Ray’s film Mahanagar in 1965. She played the role of younger sister of Anil Chatterji and adapted herself in the role of realistic actress who show least amount of mannerisms in that film. In the bollywood film Guddi, she played the role of a common girl who was inspired by bollywood films. Utpal Dutta, her uncle took her to film studios to show that actors like Dharmender and others were made stars by the sheer effort of the cameraman, make-up man, director, producer and others and larger than life image is created by the technicians. Jaya Bacchan showed the innocence required from the role of a common teenager in the film. In the 70s, Jaya Bacchan acted in refined commercial films opposite Sanjeev Kumar and got appreciation from the mass and the critics. She was sublime in Gulzar’s film Koshish, where she herself along with Sanjeev Kumar played the role of a deaf and dumb couple who educated their child and learned communication by attending classes in deaf and dumb schools. She acted in the film Naya din nayi raat, opposite Sanjeev Kumar, where Sanjeev Kumar played 9 roles of 9 different persons. She left her house and met all the nine separate persons and met her husband which was also played by Sanjeev Kumar. She had very peculiar experiences of meeting drunkards, persons suffering from leprosy, smugglers, etc. and expressed her emotions very well. She was sublime in Gulzar’s film Parichay in 1972, where she played the role of the eldest sister of Sanjeev Kumar. She and her brothers and sisters became orphans after the death of their parents and were brought by Pran, their grandfather to their ancestral house. Jeetender was invited to teach the children and she got involved with Jeetender at the end of the film. She expressed her love for her father and hatred towards grandfather for not accepting her mother in the house like any intellectual actress. Her lips in the song “biti na bitai rehna” sung by Lata and Bhupinder Singh require special mention. Jaya Bachhan was equally sublime in commercial films like Sholay, Zanjeer, etc., opposite Big B. If her performance opposite Sanjeev Kumar in films like Anamika, Nauker, showed her class of acting, her performance opposite Big B in films like Bangsi Aur Birju or Abhimaan or Milli showed her spontaneous presence before the commercial crowd. In Abhimaan, all the songs of Lata like “teri bindiya re”, “tere mere Milan ki yeh raina”, etc., almost appeared like songs of Jaya Bacchan. Critics feel that she even did better than Big B in Hrishikesh Mukherjee’s classic film. She became a myth in the 70s, after performing in any time of film including Manoj Kumar’s Shor to Yash Chopra’s Silsila. Even the medium-budget films like Piya Ka Ghar did business due to sheer brilliance of performance of Jaya Bacchan. In the late 90s, she again made a comeback in character roles in films like Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham, Fiza, etc., and showed the audience that she had not lost her touch in acting. The viewers expect her to continue the great work in bollywood films, as there is no doubt that she had equal potentiality like Shabana Azmi or Smita Patil and could have been chosen for any art film made by Shyam Benegal, Govind Nihalini and others during the 80s, had she not left films for bringing up Abhishek Bacchan and her daughter.\n\nHappy birthday to Lara Dutta.\n\nApril is the birthday month of Lara Dutta. She was born on 16th April, 1978. Lara Dutta is perhaps one of the most underrated actress of bollywood films in recent years. She possessed same amount of talent like that of Priyanka Chopra, yet could not attain the level that Priyanka attained within the short time. During the month of her birthday, viewers wonder whether any of new films will bring back the stardom of the attractive actress. She started her career with Priyanka and Akshay Kumar in Andaz and showed a lot of promise. But after doing great job in films like Bardasht opposite Bobby Deol, Zinda opposite Sanjay Dutt, Bombai Se Aya Mera Dost with Abhishek Bacchan, some way or the other lost focus. She was also not as lucky in respect of bagging important roles like Priyanka Chopra. She showed her standard of smartness and comedy instincts in films like No Entry and Partner. No Entry is probably one of the greatest hits of Lara Dutta till now. She balanced the comedy instincts of Anil Kapoor and did outcast Bipasha Basu, Celina Jaitley and Esha Deol in the film. Her lips in the main songs in the film were also appreciated. She was sublime in Partner opposite Salman Khan. Her lips in the songs “maria maria” and others did attract the viewers. Her acting was equally realistic. In 2009, she even showed her daring nature in accepting a role of village girl opposite Irfan Khan in the film Billu Barber. She acted hardly without any make up and brought out the innocence of a village girl in the film. The big question lies in the minds of people whether Lara Dutta can get her stardom back with her performance in the film Housefull. She had learned scuva diving and showed acrobatic stunts which hardly any actress had done in Indian celluloid till now for the performance in the film Blue. Besides she had acted with Katrina Kaif, the reigning queen of bollywood in the same film. But inspite of her performance opposite her in that film being appreciated by the viewers, Blue was considered the biggest flop of Akshay Kumar and bollywood films released in 2009. After huge amount money being spend in underwater shooting the viewers could not appreciate the great pains taken by the entire team of Blue. Let us hope that Lara Dutta retains her popularity with the film No Entry Main Phir Entry and provide stiff competition to Priyanka Chopra and Katrina Kaif in future.\n\nHappy birthday to Arshad Warsi\n\nHappy birthday to Arshad Warsi. The viewers of bollywood films wish happy birthday to Arshad Warsi on 19th April, 2016. During the last few years he had featured in one successful bollywood film out of every four films released during that period. In 2011, Arshad Warsi was successful in the film Double Dhamaal. He acted alongside Sanjay Dutt, Ritesh Deshmukh, Javed Jaffery and others. Although the film did not do great business, his performance was appreciated by the audience. His greatest recognition came in the role of circuit in the film Munnabhai MBBS and Lageraho Munnabhai. In both of these films he had played the role of the assistant of Sanjay Dutt and used his gundas to evict tenants and other persons when they were paid for doing so. Both the films were serio-comic in nature and in that respect Arshad Warsi’s comedy conception entertained the viewers. In Munnabhai MBBS he used his muscle power to help Sanjay Dutt for giving exam on medical science and also for treating patients. In Lageraho Munnabhai, he compelled the academicians to give answers to Vidya Balan on questions related to Mahatma Gandhi on behalf of Sanjay Dutt. Sanjay Dutt knew nothing about the questions but due to the help of the academicians proved before Vidya Balan that he was a learned Professor. Arshad Warsi’s lips in the songs “lage raho munnabhai”, and “munnabhai mbbs” in both these films require special mention. Arshad Warsi had been great asset to the bollywood industry for his comedy skills especially due to the fact that in the last few years the only type of films which did steady business includes comedy films. His performance in the film Maine Pyar Kyun Kiya, with Sanjay Dutt and Isha Koppikar requires special mention. While Sanjay Dutt was an orthopedic surgeon in the film Arshad Warsi was an actor. He made an excellent submission in an artificial courtroom where the divorce of Salman Khan with Sushmita Sen was organized to impress Katrina Kaif. His comparison of Salman’s relationship with Sushmita Sen with a car whose break had failed and which dashed with every object on the road made everyone laugh. His lips in the song “saajan” along with Isha Koppikar, was equally impressive. Similarly he had done a great job in the film Salaam Namaste with Saif Ali Khan in the role of a lawyer. Whenever Saif Ali Khan required legal assistance during fight against Preeti Zinta he took the help of Arshad Warsi and he gave a witty answer. His performance in the film Dhamaal was equally brilliant. He was one of the four friends including Ritesh Deshmukh, Javed Jaffery and other who went to Goa to get treasure. They were stopped at every point by Sanjay Dutt, the police officer who also went to Goa for the treasure. At the end of the film the money had to be given for the cause of orphan children. In 2010, he had already showed his metal in the film Ishqiya, with Vidya Balan and Naseeruddin Shah and the film You, me and ghost. Ishqiya had got both commercial success and critical acclamation. Arshad Warsi had started his own production and is committed to do well there too. In 2014 he acted in the film Ishqiya 2, with Naseeruddin Shah and Madhuri Dixit. Although the film did not do great business but the film was appreciated. Arshad Warsi was sublime in many films including Golmaal and Golmaal Returns and viewers expect the ever-smiling talented actor to continue his brilliant work in future also."
