        "text": "The case of 'nepotism', which has become hot due to the suicide of Bollywood's famous actor Sushant Singh Rajput, is still getting hotter. The atmosphere in the Tollywood industry has started to heat up about this matter, not only that since the case of nepotism, Tollywood has been divided into two parts. But one section is openly supporting actress Sreelekha Mitra, and the other strongly opposing it. The era of accusation and counter-accusation is constantly increasing, and new names are being added to it directly and indirectly.\n\nAccording to media reports, Sreelekha had raised serious allegations against Bangla films superstar Prasenjit Chatterjee and noted actress Rituparna Sengupta while raising the issue of nepotism on her YouTube channel. Opposing his talk, senior actor Shashwat Chatterjee said - 'It is natural to suffer from depression in the difficult phase we are going through now. We have to be vigilant and stop the negativity from happening. Shashwat further supported this by saying - 'There are some people in every profession who feel that there has been an attempt to hinder their progress. We have to get out of this mental state. It is not good to stay in your mind for a long time.\n\nDirector Anik Dutta, while supporting Srilekha, said - 'Everyone is aware of nepotism. It is like an open secret. Sreelekha has opened her mouth on this issue earlier also. I think Sreelekha has forgotten to disclose the names of some other people. If those names also come to the fore, then you will not be able to run anywhere. I know the names of those people but would not like to tell because I do not want to get into such dirty things. ' While on the other hand, taking the side of Prasenjit, producer Ashok Dhanuka said that he never interfered in the casting of any film. Actress Swastika Mukherjee also hit out at Srilekha and said - 'If an actress does more than one film with a director, the news of affair with her starts flying. If so, what will be said in the case of actors?\n\nFor information, Let us tell you that similarly actress Priya Karfa accused Srlekha of snatching her work. At one time, a serial called Trishna used to appear on Doordarshan. Sreelekha became popular by playing her main character. I was the first choice for that character. I even shot for the first day. Meanwhile, actor Chiranjit Chakraborty said that nepotism does not work in Tollywood. The son of Bengali film megastar Uttam Kumar and daughter of Mahanayika Suchitra Sen never got much facility in Tollywood due to her parents. In Tollywood, there is favor, but in which profession it is not done?\n\nAmidst the case of 'nepotism', actor Tathagata Mukherjee has raised a new controversy by raising the issue of homosexuality. Tathagata said that 'casting couch' is present not only in Bollywood but also in Tollywood. Even male artists are not spared here. A famous Tollywood writer and director used to force male actors to sleep with him to give him a chance in films.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nRRR: Junior NTR will share screen with Bollywood actor Ajay Devgn\n\nRajamouli cancelled shooting of his film 'RRR'\n\nThis Bollywood actress will be seen in Malayalam films"
