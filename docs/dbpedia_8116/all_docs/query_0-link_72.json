        "text": "Bengali actress Sreelekha Mitra was cheated of more than Rs 1 lakh by fraudsters through an online electricity scam. The incident unfolded on her birthday which took place on August 29. She informed her fans about this event through social media. She has already filed the complaint at the police station and has recorded her case to the cyber police department as well. The actress hasn’t revealed the exact amount that she lost but said that it is more than one lakh rupees. She asked her fans to stay clear and remain aware of online fraud.\n\nActress Sreelekha Mitra received a phone call from the scammer regarding the payment of her electricity bill. She was suffering from a fever at that time and was feeling weak. She said that during the call she didn’t realise that she was talking to cybercriminals. They asked her to download a mobile app to complete the payment. She downloaded the app without suspecting too much about the cause. Later, when she realised that she had been cheated, the actress had already lost money from her bank account.\n\nWhile talking about the incident in an interview, Sreelekha said, “I thought I was being smart but I ended up making a foolish mistake. I urge everyone to be cautious to avoid falling into a similar trap. I won’t disclose the exact amount I lost, but it’s more than a lakh. I have reported the incident to the police and contacted the cyber cell,” as quoted by a report by Indian Today.\n\nOnline frauds have increased with the advent of modern technology. The government has cautioned people from time to time to not share their bank details with unknown organisations and people. Now, people can carry out online scams through WhatsApp messages. Identity theft is one of the ways through which scammers try to extort money.\n\nLast year, veteran Bollywood actor Annu Kapoor lost Rs 4.36 lakh in an online scam when the scammers asked him to update his KYC details. The culprit was later arrested by Mumbai Police after two months of investigation."
