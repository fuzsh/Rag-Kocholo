        "text": "Michael Rapaport revealed which Bravo reality stars are in his “power rankings” this year — including “controversial” names such as Tom Sandoval and Shannon Beador.\n\nIn a new video with Bilt Rewards founder and CEO Ankur Jain, the self-proclaimed Bravo “super fan” listed Mary Cosby, Ariana Madix, Sandoval, Beador and Teresa Giudice in his top five.\n\nThe comedian, 53, also revealed which “Real Housewives” star is climbing the ranks.\n\n“The person who is moving up the Bravo power rankings as we speak — Erika Jayne,” he said. “She’s got her residency in Vegas.”\n\nHowever, Rapaport’s choice of top Bravolebrities may raise some eyebrows given their recent headlines.\n\nMost recently, Beador has been garnering media attention for her DUI arrest.\n\nPage Six confirmed the “Real Housewives of Orange County” star was arrested on Sept. 16 after crashing into a Newport Beach, Calif., home and fleeing the scene.\n\nBeador, 59, was booked on two misdemeanors: hit-and-run and DUI alcohol.\n\nHer lawyer, Michael Fell, later told Page Six that the reality star is “extremely apologetic and remorseful” and “prepared to accept full responsibility” for the accident.\n\nGiudice — another one of Rapaport’s favorites — has also faced legal trouble.\n\nThe “Real Housewives of New Jersey” star, 51, previously served 11 months behind bars after she and her ex-husband, Joe Giudice, were convicted on fraud charges.\n\nShe was released in December 2015 and later wrote a memoir on her experience in prison.\n\nMeanwhile, “Vanderpump Rules” stars Sandoval, 40, and Madix, 38, were at the center of a highly publicized cheating scandal earlier this year.\n\nThe former couple ended their nine-year relationship in March after Sandoval’s affair with Raquel Levis was revealed.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nSince the split, the Something About Her sandwich shop owner has acquired various deals and sponsorships, including one with SoFi in which she pretended to move out of the home she still shares with her ex.\n\nOn Tuesday, Madix made her debut on “Dancing with the Stars” in a costume version of the red-hot revenge dress she wore during the explosive “Pump Rules” Season 10 reunion episodes.\n\nAfter sharing his Bravo rankings, Rapaport revealed that he would be attending BravoCon this year.\n\n“BravoCon in Vegas should be a documentary,” he said. “That should be its own show unto itself. BravoCon is three days — I’m going for five.”\n\nBravoCon 2023 will take place in Las Vegas from Nov. 3-5."
