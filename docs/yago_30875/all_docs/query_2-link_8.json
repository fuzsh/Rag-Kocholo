        "text": "Michael Rapaport gushed about Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston having a “wall of caviar” at their star-studded wedding back in 2000.\n\n“I was at Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston’s wedding. They had a wall of caviar. I still have some saved over,” the actor, 53, spilled on Sunday’s episode of “Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen.”\n\nRapaport raved that the wedding was “beautiful,” adding that the caviar wall was “generous” of the newlyweds.\n\n“How have you been on this show 87 times, and I’ve never talked to you about Aniston and Pitt’s wedding?” a stunned Cohen asked his frequent guest star.\n\nThe stand-up comedian joked that the now-divorced couple have “dropped it now” – though he’s “still eating the caviar” from the lavish nuptials.\n\n“I was shoving it down!” he exclaimed.\n\n“Billy Preston performed – lot of bucks there,” Rapaport added, before moving on to the next topic.\n\nRapaport and Pitt have been industry pals for years, first starring together in the 1993 movie “True Romance.” The former also guest-starred on Aniston’s beloved show “Friends” for a few episodes in 1999.\n\nPitt, 59, and Aniston, 54, famously tied the knot in a Malibu private estate filled with 50,000 roses, tulips and miscellaneous flowers in front of 200 guests on July 29, 2000, according to Brides.\n\nSeveral A-listers stepped out for the event, including Aniston’s “Friends” co-stars Matthew Perry, David Schwimmer, Lisa Kudrow and Courteney Cox (with her then-husband, David Arquette).\n\nPitt’s “Fight Club” co-star Edward Norton and his then-girlfriend Salma Hayek also made the cut, as well as David Spade, Dermot Mulroney and Cameron Diaz.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nThe wedding reportedly cost the couple a whopping $1 million and featured a firework display, several bands and choir performances and Melissa Etheridge singing “Whole Lotta Love.”\n\nUnfortunately, the marriage didn’t last as long as Rapaport’s caviar – as Aniston and Pitt broke up five years later.\n\n“We would like to announce that after seven years together, we have decided to formally separate,” the former couple said in a joint statement at the time. “This decision is the result of much thoughtful consideration. We happily remain committed and caring friends with great love and admiration for one another.”\n\nPitt went on to wed his “Mr. & Mrs. Smith” co-star Angelina Jolie in 2014 after speculation the two had an affair while he was still married to Aniston. The former lovebirds – who share six kids: Maddox, Pax, Zahara, Shiloh, Knox and Vivienne – split in 2016 but remain in an ongoing custody battle."
