        "text": "Columns compiled by your class correspondents\n\n1940s\n\n1946\n\nThe editors of Cornellians should be blowing horns and sending up fireworks. Congratulations to you all. Now, so many more Cornellians will be in touch—except some nonagenarians with whom I have recently spoken. Those of us in our 90s do not always have access to computers, iPhones, etc., or perhaps are just not interested.\n\nHere is the list of those in our class who registered for our virtual 75th Reunion in 2021: James Beckett Jr., Barbara Schaefer Colbert, Jean Carnell Conner, Clara Heffernan Ferguson, Jerrold Finch, BME ’48, Joyce Lee Fletcher, Philip Gisser, Paul Levine, BS ’49, Steven Marder, Sylvia Mayer Helbert Paul, and me, Dottie Taylor Prey. Many alumni also invited family members to register and attend events. Our class sponsored a meet-and-greet memorial tribute to Lloyd Slaughter, our past president, on Thursday, June 10, as well as a virtual wine tasting with the Johnson Estate Winery, New York’s oldest estate winery, on Friday, June 11. It was a memorable weekend with many interesting and worthy events.\n\nPriscilla Alden Clement (gmcpac431@gmail.com) sent a message via email that she has survived COVID and is “retiring from retirement” as a librarian. She is enjoying life with cocktails and neighbors three nights a week. Great satisfaction comes from prayer, church, reading, and her third-floor social hours. For Dorothy Van Vleet Hicks, BS ’45, not much has changed. She is lucky so far to be free from canes and walkers—just slowing down a lot. Dottie still enjoys bridge, reading, and light exercise classes. Staying active and able takes lots of naps! Her biggest takeaway from the pandemic is learning to be patient and wearing a mask.\n\nSend me your current info, using whatever carrier is best for you—slow mail (it really is!), email, or telephone. ❖ Dorothy Taylor Prey, 1 Baldwin Ave., #501, San Mateo, CA, 94401; tel., (650) 342-1196; email, dmprey@aol.com. Class website. Online news form.\n\n1947\n\nJoan Dall Patton, BArch ’47, writes, “I have been living in Chico, CA, since my husband, Ed, BArch ’49, died. I live in Sycamore Glen, an ‘active senior community.’” The recent pandemic has put a hold on many things, including the weekly watercolor class that Joan had been attending before the pandemic began, “but I am still able to play golf about once a week. Needless to say, I am the grandma of the club. My son and wife live in Chico and my granddaughter just started college. My daughter lives in Ashland, OR, and is able to visit frequently.”\n\nMurray Rosenblatt writes, “I’ve been tutoring math and physics at Rowen College at Burlington County for about 20 years—and online for the last year.” Murray gets great satisfaction from his 10-year-old yorkie (Holly), cooking, tutoring, friends, and family—which includes his two great-granddaughters, Adeline and Ava. ❖ Class of 1947, c/o Alexandra Bond ’12, abb83@cornell.edu. Online news form.\n\n1948\n\nHaving had a full column last time, I now have news to share from only one classmate: Leon Hammer, MD ’52. He reports being confined to a wheelchair the last several months (not unusual at our age, says your correspondent). But that does not stop him from continuing his writing and publishing, which provides him much satisfaction. He is also a devotee of history and reads extensively. He makes a very perceptive comment about the pandemic: “Freedom without responsibility is not freedom.” And on that, I close. ❖ Ray Tuttle, 65 Oyster Reef Dr., Hilton Head Island, SC 29926; email, RayTutt@aol.com. Online news form.\n\n1949\n\nHappy New Year! We would love to hear from you. Please submit an online news form or send your news to: ❖ Dorothy Mulhoffer Solow, 50 Grant St., Wellsboro, PA 16901; tel., (570) 948-9107 or (412) 215-1435; email, winspeck@yahoo.com; or Class of 1949, c/o Alexandra Bond ’12, abb83@cornell.edu.\n\nBack to the top\n\n1950s\n\n1950\n\nThe new University-sponsored alumni publication has been launched. Our former Cornell Alumni Magazine was owned by the alumni association. It was reaching only about 10% of alumni, while the new publication will be available to all. It is called Cornellians. Our class column and others can be found under the Alumni Community tab in the navigation bar. The online news form makes it easier to submit news for our class column. Also, there is a section titled Updates from Alumni, also under Alumni Community, where readers can make comments not usually submitted to our class column. With all our classmates now able to read our column, we hope communication among us will be much improved.\n\nI received a short note from Dick Silver, MD ’53 (New York City): “I am now professor emeritus. I don’t see patients anymore, but I am still active and involved with our hematology-oncology group at Weill Cornell Medicine (leukemia/myeloproliferative diseases). I’ve just written a couple of papers and hopefully will be attending some congresses in the fall. Old age is coming at a bad time!” I also heard from Bill Atkinson (Cambridge, MA), who is in his fifth year in assisted living at Youville House. Bill reports that he remains mentally active with a family Zoom every Sunday—and on email (atkinsopht@gmail.com) and Twitter (@Atkinsopht), where he “spends far too much time flogging the sorry state of the US press and the mainstream media, the climate deniers, and the ‘covidiots.’” He invites classmates to visit his webpage, where you can find memoirs, family history, and information on the climate crisis. “There’s also at least one Cornell reminiscence there, plus my latest post: My life in cars!”\n\nIt’s a pleasure to continue reporting bios of our accomplished class officers. Previous columns have featured vice president Nels Schaenen, MBA ’51, and past-president Dick Pogue. It’s now a pleasure report on class president Jim Brandt (Chicago). At our 65th Reunion in 2015, Jim and his wife, Nancy (Hubbard), were elected class co-presidents. Then, given the interference of COVID-19 on our 70th Reunion, Jim and our other officers graciously agreed to continue in office until our next Reunion in 2025. However, Jim and Ben Williams are working on a 2022 Reunion to replace the lost 2020 one.\n\nJim grew up in Birmingham, MI, a suburb of Detroit, where his father was an engineer with his own firm that had consulting work in many places—in 1929, he designed and oversaw construction of the world’s largest truck plant, outside Moscow, Russia. During WWII, while working for Consolidated Vultee, Jim’s father was responsible for increasing the production of B-24 four-engine bombers, the most produced aircraft ever. Observing his father’s work inspired Jim to become a manufacturing engineer.\n\nAfter preparatory school at Cranbrook, Jim joined the Navy and remained in the Naval Reserve for 19 years, attaining the rank of lieutenant. With the rest of us, he entered Cornell in fall 1946—as you will recall, a rather tumultuous time. On campus he played JV baseball, was a varsity cheerleader for football and basketball, and was wearer of the “C.” Jim was president of Chi Psi fraternity and was active in the Interfraternity Council (IFC), Sphinx Head, Red Key, Atmos, Campus Chest, Freshman Camp, and CURW. He had the good fortune to meet his future wife, Nancy. They were married in 1951, in what Jim calls “the best decision I ever made.” Nancy died in December 2019 after 68 years of marriage.\n\nAfter graduation Jim went to work for Reliance Electric in Cleveland, where he also worked recruiting secondary school students for Cornell and interviewed candidates for McMullen Scholarships in Mechanical Engineering. Subsequent work took him to Dayton, OH, for Master Vibrator, then to Chicago as VP for Nachman Corp. Then he became president of Saville Organ Co., which built custom-designed instruments, including a large electronic organ for Chicago’s Auditorium Theatre, where it was dedicated by well-known organist Virgil Fox. After Saville he joined Zurn Industries as VP and general manager working with president Frank Zurn, a Cornell classmate, on projects worldwide. Following retirement in 1992, he was asked in 1999 to start what became the very successful Ringspann USA, remaining on the board for another 13 years.\n\nHis interest in music has stayed with him his whole life. In 1973, the trumpet he had played in high school, and in the Bugle Corps at the Great Lakes Naval Base, was brought out of the attic to be played in the Lake Forest Symphony. He continues to play, and currently is the oldest horn player in the Windy City Winds, a 65-piece wind band that started six years ago. Moreover, Jim has sung in church choirs for over 60 years.\n\nIn retirement, Jim has stayed active in community activities and world travel. He was president of his church congregation, and for 25 years he was active with the Executive Service Corps of Chicago, helping not-for-profit organizations improve their operations. He and Nancy developed an intense interest in ancient history, specifically cultures of the Mideast. They traveled four times to Greece, three times to Turkey, and two to Egypt, plus visits to Syria and Israel, as well as studying at the U. of Chicago’s Oriental Inst. Other travels took them yearly to Germany for business/pleasure trips—in all, a total of 40 different countries.\n\nJim and Nancy had four children, three living: Barbara (Boston U.) is a preschool music teacher; Doug (Washington U.) is an editor for the Journal of the American Medical Association; and Doug’s twin, Carolyn (Rice U., Baylor MD), is a pediatrician and mother of Jim’s two grandchildren. ❖ Paul Joslin, 13731 Hickman Rd. #4207, Urbandale, IA 50323; email, phjoslin@aol.com. Online news form.\n\n1951\n\nYour correspondent, Brad Bond, turned 92 in October. He has his first great-grandchild, Miriam, born in September in New Mexico. Brad recently traveled to Upstate New York, accompanied by his son, his daughter-in-law, and two of his three daughters, to his brother’s second wife’s funeral. He still lives in his house in Marietta, OH, with one of his twin daughters.\n\nHoward Hyde recently moved into assisted living. He gets great satisfaction these days from reading, and he turned 102 in January 2021! David Werdegar, MA ’53, is a retired physician and professor emeritus of family and community medicine at UC San Francisco School of Medicine, a department he was the founding chairman of. “We live in a beautiful ‘suburb’ of San Francisco, 15 miles north of the city, across the Golden Gate Bridge. My wife, Kathy, retired after 23 years as a justice of the California Supreme Court. We have two sons, each married, and five grandchildren.” His biggest takeaway from the pandemic is that “science is amazing—to have a vaccine in one year.”\n\nWinifred Bergin Hart is “still getting used to the outside world after a COVID year of isolation. I live in a continuing care retirement community, Kendal at Lexington, VA, so we are super careful. Bit by bit we are returning to normal, whatever normal may be. I have audited classes at Washington and Lee U. and participated in a memoir class at VMI. I also volunteer as a docent at Stonewall Jackson House. In summer, I garden; in winter, I catch up on my reading, lift weights, and loaf. I am alive and in good health at 90. I have four children (one set of twins), eight grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren—all Virginia born and bred!” What brings her satisfaction? “The beauty of my surroundings in the Shenandoah Valley; the birds outside my window; my garden and its surprises; and, of course, my family.” Wallace Rich keeps it short and sweet: “Just getting older!” ❖ Brad Bond, email c/o Alexandra Bond ’12, abb83@cornell.edu. Online news form.\n\n1952\n\nAs I write this, it is mid-October and not a leaf has turned. First, some brief notes: You can find Class Notes online by googling Cornellians; I believe new news forms will be sent out with dues notices—be sure to check the small box on the form if you want your email address online.\n\nNow the big news: Our 70th Reunion is June 9–12 at the Statler on campus. All ’52 class events will be at the Statler, which is handicap accessible. There will be a shuttle if you need it, and provisions will be made for the mobility challenged. There are about 500 of us left. Think seriously of joining the party. Details will follow, but this should start your thinking.\n\nNow for news from you, almost all of which arrived in late spring. John Orr ’51, BME ’52 (Newtown, PA) is still in a continuing care retirement community. He is “steaming as before—but somewhat slower at 91.” His fraternity brother, friend, and boss, Jim O’Brien ’51, BCE ’52, died in December 2020. John had his COVID shots in March, followed by his “first dinner out in a year. I’m selling my boats—have had two from 1977 until 2021.” In retirement, he has been writing. His first great-grandchild was born in January 2021. These days, he finds the most satisfaction in his 17 years of marriage with his second wife. Takeaway from the pandemic? “It was right to stay at my New Jersey lagoon front ‘shore house’ from May to October.” When asked about any changes, C.V. Noyes, MBA ’55 (Adamstown, MD; cvnoyes@gmail.com) notes, “My handwriting has gotten much worse.” C.V. has been sorting and scanning thousands of photo slides. His most satisfaction comes from friends and travel. His takeaway from the pandemic? “Me!” Frank Laimbeer, BS ’55 (flaimbeer@aol.com), whose life has changed recently, is doing nothing in retirement. His family comes to see him in his apartment, and his grandchildren bring him great satisfaction.\n\nLewis Ward-Baker (Rochester, NY; patnlew@rochester.rr.com) on change: “I’ve lost a few friends and feel sad that I didn’t have a chance to thank them for their contribution to my life.” Lewis is currently working on writing a play. Life and family? “There has been a distinct warming of all the relationships as we all realize with great clarity how much we mean to each other.” What brings the most satisfaction? “1) My wife’s loving support and encouragement. 2) Connecting by Zoom with a large group of friends.” Biggest takeaways from the pandemic: “1) How strong we all are. 2) We all will deal with a kind of PTSD for the next few years as fear abates and sadness heals.” Rik Clark (Osterville, MA; capeclarks@aol.com) writes, “The presence of the COVID-19 pandemic has changed everyone’s life. Before the pandemic started, we moved. Since moving, we have remained safe and well.” Rik has been volunteer fundraising for the Pan-Mass Challenge and the Dana-Farber Cancer Inst., and staying as fit as possible at the YMCA and with walks. He derives the most satisfaction from thinking about and playing golf, enjoying Cape Cod, and being very grateful for family and friends. Takeaways from the pandemic? “Gratefulness for those on the front lines, fighting COVID-19 and caring for those sickened by it. Sadness for all who have died.” Ted, MS ’53, and Trudy Krueger Winsberg (Boynton Beach, FL; tandtwinsberg@gmail.com) say that daily life is very much the same. “We continue to live here on the farm surrounded by a Palm Beach County park. Green Cay Wetlands is scheduled to be enlarged by 70 acres starting this summer, which will shrink our farm to 45 acres.” Ted and Trudy’s four “children” are all in the middle to top end of their 60s now. All are well, as are their five grands. These days, Ted gets the most satisfaction from “waking up every morning (at 5 a.m.) and knowing I have another day to enjoy.” His biggest takeaway from the pandemic? “That working people, documented or undocumented, are the engine that drives the economy.”\n\nHazel Lowe von Rosenvinge (Peabody, MA; hvonr3@gmail.com) has moved to a senior living community. She is a museum guide. “Being alive!” brings her the most satisfaction these days. Murray Wigsten, MA ’54 (who is somewhere in England) is still the “poorly paid supervisor” at his home farm, where they have been logging and having annual events. In retirement, he is “wintering at our prehistoric English cottage.” Judy Winter Burger (New York, NY; judyburger@verizon.net) is living on the Upper East Side. She sends a big kiss. Her most satisfaction comes from “friends, family, and all the things NYC has to offer! The pandemic changed that, but I hope it returns soon!” Alice Warshaw Forman (New York, NY) is also on the Upper East Side. Her life has been changed by the virus: “NYC is less vibrant, but it’s now reviving.” She exhibited some of her early work—abstractions that were in the Whitney—last summer in Southampton. Alice’s granddaughter “graduated from Oberlin with high honors and received an internship in medieval art from the Metropolitan Museum.” What brings her the most satisfaction? “Being in relatively good shape and enjoying this spring.” Biggest takeaway from the pandemic? “Remembering to obey all rules!” ❖ Joan Boffa Gaul, joangaul@mac.com. Online news form.\n\n1953\n\nThanks to everyone who responded to our call for news. The University’s new, digital-first publication should help make it easier to stay in touch.\n\nJack Brophy (johnbrophy@aol.com) writes about the stroke he suffered last year. “They did an MRI of my brain, which showed a white, dime-sized ‘snowflake’ identified as the blockage that caused the stroke. I began thinking about the human brain and its computer-like memory capacity. Is the capacity limited? Will it reach ‘full’ and reject new thoughts, or selectively delete some old insignificant data to make room for the present flow of information? I find that if I read an old memoir written 20 years ago, I can begin to recall more details than I had recorded on paper. The brain has a great recall capability. Well, my brain is old but still working, a bit slower than I would like, but for all of the above, I consider myself lucky and blessed. A New Year’s wish for all my ’53 friends: try to stay well!”\n\nJanice Button-Shafer (jbuttonshafer@gmail.com) shares that the highlight of her year was a family reunion celebrating her 90th birthday. “My daughter, Christina, who lives nearby in Sierra Madre, arranged for all of my family to gather in Palm Springs for a three-day celebration. The house she rented was once owned by Bing Crosby (and now belongs to Francis Ford Coppola). Furniture and pictures were rather ancient, but there were modern appliances … and even a small home theater inside and a large swimming pool outside. My twin Cornell sons—Charles ’92 and John ’92—joined us, along with two granddaughters. We all had a great time!” Some years ago, Janice made an investment in Cornell’s Pooled Life Income Fund and specified that it be used, after her death, to establish a scholarship for a woman studying in the School of Engineering Physics (now called Applied & Engineering Physics). Thank you, Janice, for helping pave the way for a future female scientist.\n\nRuth Burns Cowan (ruthcowan@aol.com), senior research fellow, Ralph Bunche Inst. for International Studies, is pleased to report that her documentary, Tribal Justice, will be shown at Cornell twice in December and then twice in January off-campus in Arizona. “Tribal Justice features two Native American judges who reach back to the traditional concepts of justice, which aim at rehabilitation rather than punishment and imprisonment. They address the root causes of crime, offering effective and far less costly responses. The film has been shown in colleges and universities in the US and throughout the world, so I am especially pleased that Cornell will join the ranks. State and federal judges in the US have embraced the film and have hosted events featuring it. Their support reflects a belief widely held by those engaged in our criminal justice system: the system is broken.”\n\nRose Carpenter Gernon (jdgernon@aol.com) says she and her husband, Dean ’51, are “very happy living in a large retirement community not far from one of our five daughters in Lacey, WA. When I retired from my teaching job, I was science department head and taught chemistry and biology in the El Monte Union High School District.”\n\nJoan Pennell Grant (joankiaora69@gmail.com) says, “I’m still living contentedly in my apartment in Melbourne, Australia, and am long retired from university lecturing in Asian politics and from volunteer work with refugees, although I still contribute to their support. My adult children and grandchildren generously assist when necessary for shopping, repairs, etc., and provide welcome friendship and humor.” Like many of us, Joan has enjoyed online meetings with her book club and friends and looks forward to the end of COVID restrictions. “I pass the time with lots of reading, sitting in the sun, and a little streaming—which my eyes don’t like! And I feel very lucky. Apart from a sister in New York, my American contacts have become pretty slim, but my memories of beautiful Cornell are still vivid. I send all classmates the warmest wishes.”\n\nDiane Johnston Graziano (coelhen2@frontiernet.net) and her husband, Calvin, MBA ’54, still live in Pittsford, NY, where Diane enjoys digging into family history and genealogy. “As the family historian and genealogist, I dig into our past and track down ancestors, which is good exercise for my brain,” she says. She finds the German language classes she took at Cornell useful when searching through genealogy records written in German. “I’ve discovered 1,700 surnames of students who were at Cornell in my time—probably we are all distant cousins. And I doubt that any one of us was aware of the very severe hardships our ancestors dealt with as white ‘serfs’ under a descendant of the original Dutch Patroon Van Rensselaer—who was also a relative of Martha Van Rensselaer.” Diane and her husband are currently reorganizing a longtime church group that lapsed during the COVID shutdown and finds email a useful way to keep in touch with friends and relatives. “With perseverance, we do what we can with the talents, health, and years dealt to us.”\n\nIrene Selmer Griffith, BA ’52 (irenesgriffith3@gmail.com) writes from her new address in New Horizons apartments in Torrance, CA, that her husband, Owen ’50, PhD ’58, died in 2020, the same year she had a broken hip surgically repaired. “I now use a walker,” she reports. “Fortunately, my family is very supportive, meeting with me regularly in person and via Zoom.” Irene serves on the Torrance Commission on Aging, providing inspiration to seniors, assisting with funerals, and providing grief counseling. “I am grateful for living so richly these past 89 years and being able to continue with my practice of lifelong learning.”\n\nClaire Moran Ford, the first female president of the Class of 1953, died in Connecticut on July 28, and a memorial service, ending with “The Evening Song,” was held in November. Claire and her late husband, Clark, were married for 53 years and raised three children at their longtime home in Westport, CT. In addition to serving as ’53 president and Reunion chair, Claire was president of the Cornell Club of Fairfield County and a member of the Cornell council. She is survived by her children, Jeff ’79, Suzy, and Chris ’89, and four grandchildren, including Blair ’11. Memorial donations “in memory of Claire Moran Ford” can be made to the Cornell Annual Fund online and condolences can be sent to clairefordfamily@gmail.com.

Online news form.\n\n1954\n\nMason and Patricia Jerome Colby have been living in a retirement community in Naples, FL, since 2013. Mason is coordinator of his local men’s book club. At Cornell he sang in a choir, the Glee Club, and Cayuga’s Waiters—who he still frequently meets and sings with via Zoom. Let’s hope he and some of his fellow Waiters can entertain us at our next Reunion.\n\nAnother Floridian is Jane Gregory Wilson, who lives in Sun City Center, FL. Having learned to play bridge as a Cornell freshman, she continues to play avidly in her senior living community. Aline Nitzsche Ashkin is retired and living in Rumson, NJ, where she enjoys oil painting and reading German literature. Her late husband, Arthur, PhD ’52, won the Nobel Prize in physics in 2018 for the invention of laser tweezers.\n\nPhila Staines Slade is retired and living in North Andover, MA, with her husband, Dick, in the house they bought in 1957. How is that for longevity? She is active in her community’s improvement society and chairs the committee that has restored and maintains Olmsted Park. Phila writes that her Zoology major at Cornell was “surprisingly helpful” in raising their three girls. Retired architect John Fodor Jr., BArch ’57, lives with his wife, Jacqueline, a French citizen, in Huntington, CT, where he enjoys gardening and woodworking. In his younger years he was close friends with Peter Noyes of Cornell varsity football and recruited over 30 student athletes into the program. He was also president, director, and an original charter member of the Cornell Club of Fairfield County, CT. Since 1994 John has served as trustee of St. Thomas Aquinas Parish Church in Fairfield.\n\nBetty Wagler Striso and her husband, Clem, have been cocooning in their home in Glen Cove, NY, throughout most of last year. Betty is an avid reader, having gone through more than 1,000 books since she started counting a few years ago. Son Andy Striso ’78 (Chemical Engineering) has retired from Colgate Palmolive and spends his time golfing and skiing. Daughter Claire Striso Wilkinson ’79 (Arts & Sciences) is assistant registrar at Middlebury College in Vermont.\n\nBarbara Jones Jenkins (barbjenkins16@charter.net) lives in Northfield, MN. Until retiring, she served as finance director for Cannon Valley Elder Collegium. The collegium administers classes for Northfield residents age 50-plus, taking advantage of having two local colleges with retired professors still eager to teach. Barbara’s bucket list item: “Perfecting my tennis serve.” At our age—wow! Last year she went to Tokyo to visit her grandson Stewart, his Japanese wife, and two great-grandsons. Barbara writes, “And to think that their great-great-grandfather earned the Navy Cross fighting the Japanese in World War II!”\n\nOne of our classmates who has not retired is Robert Greenwald (bobsellsflowers@gmail.com) of Monroe Township, NJ. As you can guess from his email address, Bob is in the business of selling flowers online. He loves his work because, as he says, “It keeps me upright.” Bob claims to have moved 22 times since leaving Cornell. We suspect this may be close to a record.\n\nMerrill Hessel, BChemE ’56, a retired chemical engineer living in Gaithersburg, MD, recently remotely engineered an audiobook with his good friend Maurice Martinez, a professor in North Carolina, titled Blackcreole: Too White to be Black, Too Black to be White. The 500-page book describes the racism Martinez faced as a Black Creole from New Orleans through graduate school at the U. of Michigan and in the academic workplace. The project took them one and a half years working from their homes in two different states via computers. ❖ Bill Waters, billwaters@optonline.net; Ruth Carpenter Bailey, rcbhtb@gmail.com. Class website. Online news form.\n\n1955\n\nSteve Clingan, president of Clingan Steel Inc., reports, “We worked right through COVID as an essential industry. We were really slow at first, but then since November 2020 we got busier than we have ever been. I’m now on dialysis four hours a day, three days a week after work, which is a pain but necessary. High blood pressure took its toll.” And now, Steve says, “I’m working harder than I ever did in my life.” His wife died three years ago, which we are very sorry to hear. His takeaway from the pandemic: “I can’t understand the reluctance to get the vaccine, but that seems to tie into a general malaise in our country.”\n\nBarbara Balsam Brown sold her home of 59 years and moved to Lantern Hill, a continuing care retirement community. “It was a great move!” Her other good news was becoming a great-grandmother to Theo.\n\nFred Antil has had a very active life. “Because of Chuck Feeney ’56, I returned in 1983 as special assistant to Hotel school dean John Clark. After retiring, I became very involved with the Ithaca community and the University, serving on the Ithaca school board and the Cayuga Heights village board, plus serving on the Cornell Council and the Executive Council of Cornell Academics & Professors Emeriti.” New chapter: In the ’90s Fred began researching Abraham Lincoln and giving hundreds of presentations dressed as Lincoln. He kicked off the annual CACO meeting when it moved to Philadelphia after 100 years in New York, and completed his well-received book, A Lincoln Treasure Trove, which is available on Amazon.\n\nDonna Jean Avery Darling, MS ’61, says she’s “been doing a lot of 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzles lately,” and reading too. Nancy Eisenberg Grabow has moved to New Jersey to be nearer to her children and adds, “I would love to work on a project for Cornell!” ❖ Nancy Savage Petrie, 85 Brook St., Noank, CT 06340; email, nancysavagepetrie@yahoo.com.

They want you to know that they love it. “No cooking, country living, perfect weather.” Shirley continues to do her calligraphy for pleasure and/or money, and she also enjoys her garden. When they sent in their news form, the Loomises were looking forward to an upcoming vacation with their family in the Grand Tetons in Wyoming. Allen Unger (Bronx, NY) continues in the practice of cardiology. “The grandchildren are growing and are happy, despite the pandemic.”\n\nDiana Motycka Day (Wooster, OH) enjoyed seeing a few classmates on Zoom recently and misses her husband, Robert, who passed away. Margot Mahoney Haddock (Lebanon, NH) is recently widowed; her husband, Harold, passed away from complications of COVID-19 in December 2020. Margot moved to an assisted living facility last fall to be near three of her four children. She’s grateful for good health and good friends. Judy Morse Jones (West Dover, VT) continues her charity work in her community and with her church. She and her husband developed syringes over the years for various pharmaceutical companies—and they have been put to good use during the pandemic!\n\nPatricia Hamm Finstad (Sarasota, FL) writes, “I’m as busy as ever. I still attend a variety of classes and meetings, but they’re mostly online. So instead of zooming around town, I’m ‘Zooming in place!’” She continues teaching Tai Chi Chih meditation, which she has been doing for the past 18 years in many venues—adult education programs, retirement centers, health clubs, and martial arts studios. “The form I teach is not a martial art, but a moving meditation. It’s great for health and wellbeing and has been life-changing for many of my students. I love it.” Patricia is also enjoying the newest addition to her family: her great-grandson. She publishes a weekly newsletter geared to the spiritual community in Sarasota and just completed issue number 974.\n\nShelby Singleton Fillingane and husband Hugh have moved to a retirement home in Ashburn, VA. Hugh is a retired naval officer. His muscle disease confines him to a wheelchair, while Shelby sometimes uses a cane. She is grateful that they were able to get vaccinated on site! Betsy Jennings Rutledge (Wilmette, IL) and Dick ’55 are doing well. “Retirement is busier even than work, it seems. Family—including three adult offspring, eight grandchildren, and six great-grandkids—occupy us a lot.” Their civic activities have reduced, but Betsy remains active with a charitable organization (working alongside a “great group of women”) offering scholarships.\n\nSad news: Jean Willman Scott (Venice, FL) passed away on September 14, 2020. Jean was past president of Pi Beta Phi, and her father was a professor in the Ag school. And John Hoare Jr., MBA ’57 (Basking Ridge, NJ), retired CPA, passed away this past June. They will both be missed. Keep your news coming. Best: ❖ Phyllis Bosworth, phylboz@aol.com. Online news form.\n\n1957\n\nEmita Brady Hill has had no grass grow under her feet. Chancellor emerita, Indiana U. Kokomo, former vice president, Lehman College, City University of New York, author, dancer, grandmother and great-grandmother, diver, oral historian, and blogger, she planned to take the train into the city from her home in New Rochelle, NY, to attend the class dinner organized by Judy Richter Levy, LLB ’59, each year on the Saturday after Thanksgiving prior to the Cornell-Boston U. hockey game at Madison Square Garden.\n\nOne person who was not at the dinner is Gerald Dulin, who answered the question “How has your life changed recently?” with this: “With COVID, are you kidding?” During the height of the pandemic, he hunkered down with family, similar to most or all of us. One exception is Stu Fischman, who in retirement has moved to Israel and would have had to quarantine both ways in order to attend the dinner and game. In his absence, he instructed Judy to “Have one for me!” ❖ John Seiler, suitcase2@aol.com. Online news form.\n\n1958\n\nDavid Brown, MBA ’60, lost his wife several years ago from Parkinson’s disease.

He still loves reading and attending concerts. He also loves seeing friends old and new and has a significant other who was a teacher for 35 years. She was in charge of the school musicals and sings all the time! Hugh still fears getting the virus and doesn’t get to see his four great-granddaughters.\n\nCharles “Sandy” Burton, MS ’63, was diagnosed with Parkinson’s a few years ago; he can no longer drive and his activities are limited. He lost one of his daughters in fall 2020, but notes that his grandchildren are all doing well. Neil MacCormick passed away in Scotland in August 2021. One of his sons and one of his granddaughters are classes of ’83 and ’21! His love of Cornell was always evident and, after his return to campus in the mid-1970s, it rubbed off on some offspring.\n\nCynthia Rau Sears writes that her life has not really changed that much. She enjoys Zoom meetings for now, and she’s masking and being very careful, but she still enjoys going out for dinner and being with friends as much as she can! Ann Gaffey Coyne has been staying home and keeping safe knitting hats for newborns at the hospital. She is retired and lives in a cottage at Kendal at Ithaca with lots of other Cornellians nearby. Her son Tom died at age 60 just before Christmas 2020 of a seizure disorder. Ann enjoys reading and listening to books and hiking the many trails near Ithaca.\n\nDean Danzer (dedanzer@sbcglobal.com) is slowly recovering from amyloidosis—getting better, but still walking with a cane. His house is in the woods, so he and his wife enjoy watching wildlife. They are getting ready to begin trips to nearby parks in the Ozarks! He retired in 1997 after 38 years with Monsanto, where he designed and built chemical plants around the world. He has three sons and five grandchildren. Laurence Pringle has not yet retired.

Online news form.\n\n1959\n\nNorman Brockmeier (ib703exP@comcast.net), a vice president at the Seal & Serpent Society during his undergraduate years, was among alumni members attending the group’s virtual Homecoming this past September. In addition to updates from the board and from individual members, the event recognized Seal & Serpent’s new alumni member sisters, previously “little” or “honorary” sisters. (In 2020, the house club voted to become gender neutral and to admit graduate students.) Norman and his wife, Sharon, divide their time between homes in Wheaton, IL, and Green Valley, AZ. “I am retired, healthy, and fully vaccinated against COVID, and I enjoy playing nine holes of golf once a week,” writes Norman. After graduating from Cornell, he worked in industry for three years, then went to MIT, earning a PhD in microwave plasma discharge. “Max Deibert and several others from my days at Cornell were also working on their doctorates at MIT—we joked that the place was Cornell’s finishing school in the field of chemical and metallurgical engineering.” Norman went on to teach at the U. of Texas in Austin and the U. of Ohio; in 1995 he incorporated Oakwood Consulting to offer services to the petrochemical industry.\n\n“My grandson, John Megrue III ’22, a senior in the Dyson School, adores Cornell,” says Brooke Morrison Megrue (Bmegrue@gmail.com). Brooke has been enjoying condo living in the John’s Island community in Vero Beach, FL, for the past 13 years. She also has a condo in Darien, CT, convenient to three of her children and her granddaughter Brooke, who have houses nearby. “I spend as much time with my kids and grandkids as possible. However, happily, they are all so busy with life and careers, so I have also developed my love of golf, duplicate bridge, travel, and friends to keep my life overflowing with joy and fun. So much to be thankful for!”\n\nNew on the Hill is Sam Fulmer ’25, also in the Dyson School. He’s the grandson of Carole Kenyon (carolekenyon59@verizon.net), who helped Sam move onto campus on a rainy August day: “I’ve been wearing the red rain jacket with ’59 on the back—a class favor from one of our Reunions—which has started some wonderful conversations, including one with a freshman from Texas who asked if Ithaca winters are really so cold.” He’ll learn—as will grandson Sam, who left a cotton sweater with Carole in case he needs something “heavy” for winter use.\n\nDuring the pandemic, nine Alpha Delta Phi members and widows from our class have relied on Zoom sessions to stay in touch. Here’s an update on them. Since retirement, Bill Dring, BArch ’61 (billdring@comcast.net) and his wife, Jan, have lived in Steamboat Springs, CO, enjoying winter sports and wonderful summers in a great community. They feel lucky that Colorado is such an attraction that their kids and grandkids visit fairly frequently, but they also dearly miss their own travels. Rick Dyer, MD ’63, is still at his farm in Watertown, CT, enjoying the area’s natural beauty as well as having his family nearby. He continues to row to stay fit. Like the Drings, Dan and Ann Hall, BA ’61, in Andover, MA, are hoping to travel again soon. They enjoy retirement, support worthy local causes, and share their dog’s therapy with others. Cal Carr stays in close touch with his Cornell fraternity brothers, although he transferred to Tufts as a junior and later graduated from that university. He and Ginger have lived in Boothbay, ME, for the past 26 years. Hans and Barbara Lawaetz are still on St. Croix, which Hans calls “a paradise with occasional hurricanes.” He recently became a great-grandfather to a young charmer named Ana. His herd of Senepol cattle has been reduced to a hobby herd of 20, surrounding the house to graze and search for human attention. The original herd of 1,500 can be traced to countries worldwide.\n\nContinuing with Alpha Delta Phi updates, New Jersey native Tom Martin retired in 2009 and returned with his wife, Margret, to her small town of Heppenheim in Germany’s Hessische Bergstrasse region, one of its smallest wine-growing regions. “We don’t export much of our excellent wine because we like to drink it ourselves,” Tom notes. Stan Lomax, JD ’62, has moved to Mystic, CT, after retiring from teaching at the U. of South Carolina, and says he still enjoys life because his two daughters are nearby. Penny Nelson, widow of Bob Nelson, also lives in Mystic near their three children. She continues to support High Hopes Therapeutic Riding. Sally Eaton Vrooman, widow of Dave Vrooman, lives in Canton, NY, advocating for more public tennis courts, and traveling to Ethiopia and Rwanda to teach SAT prep skills to students who want to attend an American university.\n\n“COVID-19 notwithstanding, I have been quite busy,” writes Rolf Barth (rolf.barth@osumc.edu), professor in the Dept. of Pathology at Ohio State U. Among his recent publications is one that relates to the illness and death of England’s King George VI (was it really a blood clot that stilled his “valiant heart”?). Another is a review of three coronavirus diseases, SARS, MERS, and COVID-19: “Ending on a positive note, the development of a number of vaccines, at least six of which now are in clinical use, should mitigate and eventually control the devastating COVID-19 pandemic.” ❖ Jenny Tesar, jet24@cornell.edu. Online news form.\n\nBack to the top\n\n1960s\n\n1960\n\nCongratulations to Barbara Baillet Moran (bbmoran1@gmail.com), who announced in October that she has published her second book, What Just Happened: Stories in Verse (Bonventura Press), and already received an enthusiastic review that her writing is “intelligent and poignant, yet approachable, and full of wit and cleverness, but never condescending.” Barbara notes that all her profits from book sales go to Plan International USA, which she has been involved in for 50 years. The organization serves children living in small villages in the world’s poorest countries, focusing on their nutrition and education while also guiding adults to improve their villages and thus their children’s lives. Barbara concludes her note by saying: “I will soon swap with Ron Pereira for his book, Porch Conversations, and I greatly enjoyed reading Becky Quinn Morgan’s fine autobiography, Life in Three Acts: Farm Girl, Public Servant, Philanthropist. It seems the Class of 1960 has been looking back—and writing about it!”\n\nAt the end of 2020, Becky and Jim Morgan ’60, BME ’62, MBA ’63, sent news about their family’s activities, noting that they missed two Cornellian weddings because of the pandemic, one in France of their grandson Julien ’19, the other of their son, Jeffrey ’84, in California. Their granddaughter Sophie ’24 happily began her college life in Ithaca in fall 2020; there, said Becky, “incredible planning, the signing of behavioral contracts, and twice-weekly testing with a one-day turnaround kept the COVID caseload very low.” Becky and Jim’s travel during a nine-month period consisted of just one three-day trip to Jackson, WY, where they visited their daughter, Mary, and her husband, Dave, who had both luckily recovered from a bout with COVID-19 in March, allowing the four of them to take hikes and enjoy their time together.\n\nIn October, Leigh Buchanan Bienen (lbbienen@law.northwestern.edu) proudly announced that she and Henry ’60 have a grandson, Henry Rogers ’24, who “entered Cornell in the College of Arts & Sciences and seems to be very much enjoying it, which pleases us immensely.” Meantime, Carl Volckmann wrote from Florida that “both Linda and I tested positive for COVID-19 in October. Linda had no symptoms, but I ended up in the hospital for seven days. Remdesivir and a son on the university hospital staff fortunately made for a quick recovery. Having retired from IBM and several smaller companies a while back and then selling our Connecticut house, my wife and I now divide our time between Park City, UT, and Stuart, FL.” Carl is grateful these days for “good health and seven grandchildren.”\n\nRetired as president of Sawmill Creek Vineyards, from which he generously donated wine for our 55th Reunion, James Hazlitt (Hector, NY) clearly retains his dedication to the grape: he describes himself as a “retired grape grower” and says that his activity in retirement is “pruning grape vines and enjoying R&R and wine.” What brings him the most satisfaction these days is “golf and good wine,” and his biggest takeaway from the pandemic is that it had “no effect on wine grapes.” Alan Krech, MA ’63, who lives with his wife, Louise, in Columbia, SC, writes that he is “busy teaching round dance in a co-ed ballroom, bowling, and gardening, if the rain ever stops.” What now brings him the most satisfaction is “58 years in a healthy marriage and staying active.”\n\nCynthia Golomb Dettelbach (cindydett@gmail.com) reports from Pepper Pike, OH: “Since my retirement as a newspaper editor, I’ve tried my hand at writing plays. When my one-act play scheduled at a local theater was canceled last year due to the pandemic, I helped organize a Zoom series of ten-minute plays provided by the Stagewrights Workshop. Three of my plays have had readings since the program’s inception. It’s been a great outlet and a wonderful way to connect with family and friends throughout the country. I’m still adjusting to life without my beloved husband, John ’58, but I realize that you’ve got to learn to pivot, adjust, and try to nurture relationships as best you can.”\n\nBarbara Anderson Everett says her daily life changed “much the same as others, I suspect. We had wonderful travel in Canada, Portugal, and Panama, and visits with family and distant friends until March 2020 and the shutdown.” Her takeaways from the pandemic are to “savor every moment and be grateful for everything—in this year, especially Zoom!” Fortunately for Barbara and husband John, when the danger abated in fall 2021, they managed to spend two weeks on a Maine island with children and grandchildren and were beginning to plan other travel.\n\nHeartfelt condolences to classmates who have experienced grievous loss during these past many months. Margaret Osmer McQuade lost her wonderful husband, Lawrence, to pneumonia in late 2020, and Daniel Martin ’58 lost his beloved wife, Barbara (Cyrus), who died suddenly in March. Recently Elaine Smith Schwartz sadly reported the September death of her husband, Stuart ’58; they had been married for 61 years, “during which,” she says, “we shared many memories of our days at Cornell and enjoyed an active life together.” Send your news directly to me, or fill out an online news form. ❖ Judy Bryant Wittenberg, jw275@cornell.edu.\n\n1961\n\nThis column reflects the life transitions of our classmates, as well as the overhang of our many months dealing with the COVID pandemic. Ever the optimist, I, along with you, hope for better days. Keep sending your updates to us so we can share them with your classmates.\n\nEleanor Stanford Erskine (eleanorerskine@gmail.com) writes that she has lived in a retirement community for two years and is enjoying it very much. “COVID caused restrictions, but activities are coming back. Plenty of time for reading and storytelling. I have four grandchildren in undergraduate or graduate programs and one who is a second lieutenant in the Army.” Final thought: “Have an attitude of gratitude.”\n\nTherese Elzas Baker-Degler writes from Stanford, CA, and her long-term residence on Mears Court, one of the faculty housing streets on the Stanford campus. “I’m trying to finish a study of the original Mears Court leaseholders. My late husband, Carl Degler, was one of them. I and another original owner interviewed 15 of the original 32 in 2003, after they had been in their houses since 1968, the year the street was built. I will prepare a text describing how the original owners felt about the street after 35 years. I’ve now lived on this street since 1989.” She further lamented the effects of the coronavirus in curtailing family and travel activities. However, she has been unscathed.\n\nMost of us know David Lipsky from his lengthy tenure as dean of the ILR school. “I was a member of the Cornell faculty for 50 years; I retired in 2018. I was the Anne Evans Estabrook Professor of Dispute Resolution and served as dean from 1988 to 1997. Regrettably my wife, Sandy, died in early 2020. We were high school sweethearts and met in 1956. We were married in 1962, 58 years. I maintain an office at the ILR school and do my best to stay up to date in my field. Obviously 2020 was a terrible year, especially for me, but we must persevere and do our best.”\n\nWe heard again from Gail Kweller Ripans (gkripans@gmail.com) in Atlanta, GA. “I moved to a senior community, Lenbrook, in January 2020. I still lecture about international relations, especially the Middle East. My twin grandsons will have their bar mitzvah in November in Atlanta.” Gail comments that the pandemic is “a Biblical plague and can happen again.” She further adds that she remains in regular contact with a group of five of her fellow Cornellians.\n\nWillard Reed has moved to Rensselaer, NY, and writes, “My wife passed away in October 2017. I sold the house in Ocala and purchased a doublewide in a trailer park. When the pandemic struck, I eventually caught the virus, lost 30 pounds, and had a memory problem. Both are getting better a little at a time. Now I have relocated to Rensselaer near one of my sons. My pandemic takeaways include some loss of memory, learning, and strength.”\n\nGerrit White (gerritwhite@yahoo.com): “Elizabeth and I have gotten our COVID shots and are happy to resume our traveling again after a long-inspired drought. Playing golf and pickleball, gardening, and swimming on The Villages Aquatic Swim Team has kept me busy, along with the active lifestyle here at The Villages. We have a reunion scheduled in August at the Jersey Shore for our family of 12, including our five grandchildren. Our oldest grandson will start college this fall in the nearby city of St. Petersburg, FL. I wish everyone would take their vaccine shot so this pandemic can be eradicated worldwide.”\n\nAs you are aware, after publication of the May/June 2021 issue, CAM closed. Cornellians is a new, digital-first alumni publication. For those who prefer a more traditional magazine, there will be a paid print option in the future; details on its content and timing are still being discussed.

Online news form.\n\n1962\n\nDavid Green, PhD ’67, writes, “Greetings across the decades. My wife, Arlene Goldstrom ’64, and I have, for the last 18 years, lived in Toronto, Canada, whence we observe the American scene with a mixture of trepidation and hope. As you may be aware, in Canada we have had Medicare for All since 1961 and it works just fine. We wonder what the big deal is about it down there. We have four very happily married kids and six beautiful grandkids. Unfortunately, because of the pandemic, the only ones we have seen in the last year are our middle daughter and family, who live an hour and a half away in Waterloo, Ontario. The others—who are in Saskatchewan and Vermont—we see on FaceTime and Zoom. We are anxiously looking forward to better times. Arlene is now fully retired from a very rewarding career as an arts curator. After my Cornell BA, I did an MA at Stanford, then returned to Cornell, where I completed my PhD in History in 1967. Although I left full-time academia several years ago, I continue to write and teach on a part-time basis. My book, The Language of Politics in America: Shaping Political Consciousness from McKinley to Reagan, was published by Cornell University Press in 1992. Since then, I have written several articles on the subject for the American Interest. I presently hold the position of visiting professor of history at Cornell, where I teach a summer session course titled Words as Weapons: Political Vocabulary, Mass Media, and the Evolution of Political Consciousness. While in previous years I taught on campus, this past summer I had to teach via Zoom. Loving Ithaca and Cornell as we do, that is one more reason to look forward to better times.”\n\nFrom Frances Denn Gallogly: “We are retired and now split our time between condos in Bridgeport, CT, and Fort Pierce, FL. Our three children live in L.A. and Brooklyn, and we have two grandchildren in L.A. Our granddaughter may apply to Cornell Engineering as an undergrad next year. I have been doing a great deal of photography—landscape and nature. My work has appeared in shows, won awards, and been sold on Pixels.com (formerly Fine Art America) and by stock agency Tandem Stills + Motion. My husband, Vin, has taken up birding and often uses Cornell’s ornithology sites in identifying birds. In recent years I have often reflected on the wisdom imparted by special professors I encountered during my time at Cornell: George Healy (poetry), Urie Bronfenbrenner ’38 (children and families and research techniques), and Ted Lowi and Clinton Rossiter ’39 (both government).”\n\nBetty Kopsco Bennett writes, “I have so many fond memories of my four years at Cornell that it is hard to pinpoint just a few. The beautiful campus and its surrounding gorges and other natural scenery, the stimulation of ideas presented in various classes by outstanding professors, field trips for some of my natural science courses, meeting people from many states and countries, and the opportunity to grow and develop both mentally and emotionally are just a few of the highlights of my Cornell experience. Although I have not been able to return to campus for more than 20 years, I still retain vivid memories of my time spent on the Hill. Those four years were some of the most formative and valuable of my life, and I am forever grateful for the experiences I gained from them. Even today, as an 80-year-old still teaching part time as an adjunct (remotely due to the pandemic), I continue to draw upon the knowledge and ideas I accrued while at Cornell.”\n\nFrom Margaret Sandelin Benson, MS ’66: “In State College, PA, my husband, Tom, PhD ’66, and I have been very isolated during the pandemic. Our daughters live far away: Daisy in Vermont, and Sarah, PhD ’01, and her husband, Rick Ruth, PhD ’06, and their daughter in Maryland. Like other families, we have turned to Zoom for get-togethers, and one of the things we decided to do last summer was to read plays together. We had just started reading Sheridan’s The Rivals when the request for memories of the years at Cornell arrived. At once I was transported back to fall ’58 on the Hill, and the Cornell Dramatic Club’s production of The Rivals, in which I played a part. It was the second CDC production of the term. The first was Bell, Book, and Candle, for which I worked lights. I had gravitated to the dramatic club like a homing pigeon, and it became a central part of my life for the next five years. Even after Tom and I were married (fall ’60) I still worked on several plays and worked the front of the house for all the rest. Those years, all those productions, represented work, fun, and camaraderie. I have a sweeping collage of memories, which I hope others share—The Taming of the Shrew, Under Milk Wood, My Three Angels, The Boy Friend, Death of a Salesman, O’Casey’s Pictures in the Hallway, Volpone, Stephen Vincent Benét’s dramatic poem John Brown’s Body, and The Fantasticks. I was in As You Like It the spring before Tom and I left Ithaca, and Cornell.”\n\nFred Hart (fchart22@gmail.com) writes: “I read my copy of Cornell Alumni Magazine today. I thought as I read it how many I’ve read over the last nearly 60 years. Frankly, I got emotional about it. The Cornell story is special. The class column is special. Our friends are special. It hit me when I read the tribute to Jan McClayton Crites, BS ’61, from Anne Ginsberg Hoffman ’63, MA ’64. There are many special people we know because of Cornell—particularly being in the same class. The wonderful thing is that we have influenced many others—in ways we can’t imagine, like Mrs. Hoffman. I occasionally get a compliment from a former associate, and it is wonderful to know you’ve impacted someone in a positive way. (Emphasis on the occasional.) We treasure them. The column is such a great place to read those stories. Thanks for your column and including those tributes.”\n\nFrom Neil Schilke, MS ’64: “Ro and I were married on June 8, 1963, after I received my bachelor’s degree (Engineering was a five-year program) and before I went on to get a master’s. I was named head resident of U-Hall 3, so Ro and I moved into the basement apartment and had 150 ‘kids’ the first year we were married! Tom ’63, MBA ’64, and Nancy Williams Clark, MS ’64, Phil and Nancy Halsey Young, and Bill Wilson, BEE ’64, and Kiki were also married on June 8, 1963. Ken Blanchard ’61, PhD ’67, was head resident of U-Hall 4, so Ro and I saw him and his wife, Margie (McKee), MA ’65, quite a bit during the 1963–64 academic year.”\n\nFrom Jacqueline Browne Bugnion (jackie@bugnion.org): “We have recently moved to a new home in Switzerland. The only change to our life is semi-confinement due to COVID-19. We received our vaccination. We are doing lots of reading, walking, and traveling (before COVID). I recently completed an independent study recommending that Switzerland plant more trees in their forests and reduce the herd of cattle. We follow the interesting careers of our two children: our son involved in high-tech database work at the EPFL in Lausanne; our daughter running her own company in the US dealing with environmental issues. We would like to travel again but have to wait for COVID-19 to go away.”\n\nMari Stachenfeld (mstachenfeld@gmail.com) writes, “My ‘new news’ is that I am retiring from college teaching at long last. It’s been fun and it’s time for an ending.” ❖ Evelyn Eskin, evelyneskin@mac.com. Online news form.\n\n1963\n\nI hope all of you have adapted to our new online alumni publication, Cornellians. The intention is that this new form of distributing the Class Notes columns reaches a lot more classmates, as it is free and available to all alumni. We are a year and a half away from our 60th Reunion, which will be June 8–11, 2023. It will be wonderful if the world has returned to normal by then and we can celebrate in person.\n\nMary Falvey wrote in August that she was spending as much time as possible at her country home in Calistoga, CA. She added, “I’m hoping fires don’t chase me back to San Francisco. In August 2020, I had to evacuate and didn’t get back until December. We’re not as locked down now as we were a year ago, but fire season started earlier this year so it could happen at any time. I had a massive job of cleaning small trees and brush around my home as attempted fire protection—you do the best you can and pray.” Linda Goldstein Towbin writes from Bethany, CT, “I’m amazed by the number of people who pop up to help those of us stuck at home. (I’m going into year number two without my husband, Alan ’50.) I’m also grateful for the outstanding webinars, etc., offered by Cornell’s Inst. of Politics and Global Affairs and by the Cornell Club–New York, which keep us informed and engaged.”\n\nJim McArdle writes from Cos Cob, CT, that he and his wife, Carolyn, have been wintering in Florida. “We still enjoy our vacation home in Vermont but find winters too harsh for us now. We have been enjoying the activities of our ten grandchildren and try to attend all of their school and sports activities. Seeing all the groups that are helping those in need during the pandemic has given me great satisfaction. I am still trying to improve my golf game—without much success, unfortunately.”\n\nFrank and Susan Waldo Baker (susanwbaker@mac.com) wrote, “We moved from our home in Colt’s Neck, NJ, in February 2020 to Applewood, which is an assisted living retirement community that locked down because of the pandemic a few weeks after we moved in. After becoming vaccinated in 2021, we can attend lectures and meet friends for socially distant dinners or bridge games. I’ve also taken up jigsaw puzzles. We are both grateful for good health and many friends.”\n\nChanning, BS ’65, and Mary Jones live in Aiken, SC. Channing writes that he is in an investment club, a member of the South Carolina Bluebird Society (associated with the Cornell Lab of Ornithology), and involved in club activities such as golf and other sports. “Two out of our three granddaughters graduated from Cornell—Emily ’18 and Claire ’21. A third granddaughter graduated from the U. of Pennsylvania.” Channing feels that family brings him the most satisfaction in life these days.\n\nRuss and Margie Axtell Stevenson ’66 (rstevenson@pobox.com) live in Severna Park, MD. Russ said, “I will retire again, this time from the law faculty at Georgetown U., where I have been teaching for 12 years—after retiring the first time as general counsel of Ciena Corp. Twelve years ago I founded the Chesapeake Legal Alliance, a nonprofit that provides free legal support for efforts to clean up the Chesapeake Bay. I remain chair of the board and an active volunteer. Margie and I have two daughters, Lauren and Amanda ’99, and four wonderful grandchildren. We are about to visit Amanda and her family in the Bahamas, where they are finishing up two years of cruising on a sailboat.” Steve and Marjorie Walker Sayer are still in Bradenton, FL. Marjorie, like so many of us this year, turned 80 years of age. She sent a photo of her celebration with a great cake.\n\nWe lost Marcy Bergren Pine in August after a long battle with cancer. She was an active volunteer in Los Angeles. Constant “Connie” Queller passed away this summer; he lived in Hudson, FL. A memorial service for Dick Lynham, BME ’65, was finally held on August 27 in Medina, OH. Betty (Card) sent the following story: “Daughter Jennifer Lynham Cunningham ’92 took Dick’s ashes to campus last week when she was there visiting friends. She ‘walked him’ around the Arts Quad and up onto Libe Slope and tried to go into Sage Chapel but it was locked. There was a thunderstorm looming and it started to rain, so she put him under her raincoat and walked toward the car. The Chimes had been playing but had finished. All of a sudden, the rain stopped, and the Chimes started up again—playing our ‘Alma Mater’! Jennifer and her husband, Sean, stood there swaying, very emotional of course, while the wonderful chimesmasters, surely inspired by Dick from ‘Far Above,’ played all six verses! As soon as they ended, the rain started coming down again. Incredible!”\n\nHope everyone is staying well.

Winter’s here seasonally (if not skewed climatologically), the pandemic seems in retreat, and I’ve got news to report from classmates we haven’t heard from lately—beginning with John Rumble (jumbleusa@earthlink.net), who is in this column for the first time in 37 years! John lives in Gaithersburg, MD, with wife Diane (Smith) ’67 and writes, “I’m not near retirement. I am now editor-in-chief of the Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, am still publishing research papers, and have a career coaching business.” John adds, “During the pandemic, one grandson did virtual schooling from our house. My brother-in-law and track-mate James Sims retired from the National Inst. of Standards and Technology and has moved to Seattle.”\n\nDavid Slepyan, MD ’68, who lives in Langley, WA, with wife Judith, is retired from his plastic surgery practice—and also from being the team physician for the U. of Washington rowing team, a takeoff from his Cornell days when he was coxswain for the eight-oared boat. David now enjoys spending his time bike riding, growing begonias, dog walking, and visiting grandchildren. Family activities include the beach, a water park, and recently going to Atlanta to visit grandchildren.\n\nRandall Odza, LLB ’67 (rodza@bsk.com), last here a decade ago, is still working as an attorney. Randall lives in East Amherst, NY, with wife Rita. Their most recent trip was to Japan. Joan Nathanson Tosici has retired after 37 years as a New York City high school teacher. She now lives in Asbury Park, NJ, where she has joined the Woman’s Club of Spring Lake, which is “dedicated to service projects. Our emphasis has been assisting homeless veterans to find housing support services.” Joan also writes that she’s “enjoying all the activities offered at my new community; I bought a home at Rolling Meadows, an above-55 adult community.” Last April, she went to Seattle to visit her daughter.\n\nCarol Wiley Bossard, last here six years ago, still lives in Spencer, NY, with Kermit ’63, and catches us up in several areas. She writes, “In retirement, I write a bi-weekly essay that goes out to more than 100 people who seem to enjoy thinking and occasionally reminiscing. I sing with a church choir and with an independent sextet. I enjoy two granddaughters, when we are fortunate enough to see them. And I facilitate a weekly women’s group that is ostensibly a Bible study but really discusses life in general.” Carol also notes, “Daily life has not changed a lot, but after two years of semi-isolating, activities and travel are beginning to be part of our lives again. Our older son began working at Cornell last spring, which delighted us. Our younger son is working remotely for a Chicago firm and also, with his wife, home-schooling two daughters and sort of homesteading.” Carol notes she gets satisfaction from writing, “expressing ideas and sending them out for discussion and/or feedback, and also from family, good friends, and gardening. And I have enjoyed all of the Cornell information that has come via computer during this time of remote-everything.” Carol’s even trying flute-playing while “trying to deal creatively with increasingly bad eyesight.”\n\nStephen Abramson, who lives in Hauppauge, NY, with wife Phyllis, was last here just two years ago. He’s moved his company, APS Pension & Financial Services, to larger offices in Melville, NY. He remains active in volunteer activities: vice president of Hadassah Assocs.; treasurer of the Chatham, NY, synagogue and of the Hamlet Wind Watch Homeowners Assn.; and on the board of the Family Service League of Huntington, NY. Stephen also continues to play tennis “at least once a week,” notes he’s reading “more than ever,” works on their country house in New Lebanon, NY, and even took up painting again. He noted, “COVID has kept us from traveling, a favorite activity. Our next destinations will be the Snake and Columbia rivers; a Lewis and Clark expedition in America’s Northwest; Morocco; and New Orleans.” He goes on to say how their two children, their spouses, and five grandchildren keep them busy. And he hopes to make it to our 60th Reunion.\n\nThat’s it for now. I could always use more of your news, so please update me by email, regular mail, our class website, or our class Facebook page. ❖ Bev Johns Lamont, 720 Chestnut St., Deerfield, IL 60015; email, blamont64@comcast.net. Online news form.\n\n1965\n\nWilliam Brothers, BS ’68 (Ojai, CA; bill@hsiforanimals.com) reports that he and Susie still spend summer and fall in Ithaca at their pre-Civil War home just off campus, with their sailboat in the Cornell marina. The other half of the year they live in “the bucolic Ojai Valley of California.” Bill notes that quite a few other Cornellians live in Ojai. He is on the boards of two environmental groups based there, dedicated to land preservation and improvement; he works on hiking-trail building and maintenance. Bill and Susie occasionally take trips in California and the Southwest in their RV. Bill considers that Cornell has managed the pandemic crisis “superbly well.”\n\nDave Wilson (Palo Alto, CA; dwilson99@gmail.com) has in recent times been contracted to serve as an expert witness in a patent infringement case, analyzing a computer source code. Sadly, his wife, Cheryl, passed away in 2018, after over 50 years of marriage. Dave has five grandchildren, two situated in San Jose and three in Ohio. He also enjoys the company of his cat, Junior, and driving his relatively new mid-engine Corvette.\n\nLawrence Lombard (Birmingham, MI; L.B.Lombard@wayne.edu) is still teaching philosophy at Wayne State U., as he has now done for 52 years. He has more recently been on a half-time schedule: one semester on, one off. He and his wife, Nancy, spent the month of October 2019 in Paris. Earlier, they acquired a fox-red Labrador retriever, which has given them great joy. Lawrence notes that this “connected us to all the other dogs and their humans in the neighborhood.” He wryly describes his lesson from the pandemic to be “that it does take a village, even if the villagers stand at least six feet from each other.”\n\nJulianna Ricci (Derby, NY; julricnow@roadrunner.com) had to suspend travel with the pandemic, except for the annual winter sojourn in Florida. She finds she has “an increased sense of gratitude for health and mobility.” Julianna published her first novel at the end of 2019 and has been working on a second. She also helps friends edit and revise their work, and she writes holy icons in the Eastern Orthodox tradition at a yearly workshop. She enjoys communicating with her daughters and reading. Her biggest takeaways from the pandemic are “not to take anything or anyone for granted and to help those in need even more than before.” ❖ Joan Hens Johnson, joanipat@gmail.com; Stephen Appell, bigred1965@aol.com.

Joe Polacco (polaccoj@missouri.edu) is professor emeritus in biochemistry at the U. of Missouri, Columbia. For a few years after retirement, he was a visiting professor in Porto Alegre, Brazil. At Missouri, he advised research projects by undergrads and visiting Brazilian grad students. He was also a Fulbright advisor/evaluator, a Goldwater Scholarship evaluator, and a reviewer of manuscripts for peer-reviewed journals. He taught a problem-based course for biochemistry seniors. These days Joe volunteers for the Columbia, MO, food bank and is a past secretary of his local Missouri writers guild. He enjoys writing prose and poetry and has some fluency in several languages. He recently published a collection of Spanish/English poetry. This past August, Joe and his wife, Nancy, took a tour in Portugal. He had spent time living and working in Spanish Iberia, but this was his first time in Luso-Iberia. Joe and Nancy have three children and three grandchildren. Son Ben (at UCSF) was involved in two papers identifying approved drugs and pharmaceuticals that can be repurposed as antivirals against COVID-19.\n\nLochie Emerson Musso has been secretary to the Committee on Teaching About the United Nations (CTAUN). Since COVID shut down the UN for conferencing, the committee has been doing webinars (more info here). She devotes her free time to reading, and she celebrated her 75th birthday in Tibet with her two sons.\n\nKiyoshi Murata (kiyoshi.murata@gmail.com) was so inspired by Bill Gates’s book How to Avoid a Climate Disaster, that he is actively working to get others involved. In this book, Gates assembled information and suggestions for actions we may take, and presented it in an easy-to-understand format. Kiyoshi hopes to get this book distributed to as many people as possible and is personally sponsoring the cost of the books. He hopes classmates will get the book and spread the word to others. You can receive a copy by emailing him your address at AvoidClimateDisaster@gmail.com. On a personal note, Kiyoshi and his family did a six-week tour of several western states. They started in Denver then went to Las Vegas, Palo Alto, L.A., Davis, Bend, Seattle, Spokane, Bozeman, Casper, Cheyenne, and back to Denver. He visited many friends and family and spent time with his grandchildren.\n\nJohn Monroe, PhD ’70 (monroe.jw@gmail.com) and his wife, Meg (Warne), MS ’68, made the decision to move to a life plan community last March. They are now in a lovely villa at the Forum at Rancho San Antonio in Cupertino, CA, seven miles from their old Palo Alto home. They have traded proximity to Stanford, full attics, and a small yard for a smaller home with air conditioning, a bigger master bath, and a 4,000-acre nature preserve as their backyard. They both continue their pre-move activities including raising almonds, trombone playing (John), quilting (Meg), and enjoying their British grandchildren thanks to the internet and FaceTime. John is also enjoying meeting with classmates as your Class of ’66 co-president. After a 55th Reunion year, John and co-president Rolf Frantz, ME ’67 (nrfrantz@verizon.net) are thinking forward to keep the class together and engaged.\n\nPatrick Eggleston, MS ’66 (eggleston4444@hotmail.com) retired from Keene State College in New Hampshire in 2010 after teaching biology and environmental studies for 35 years. Patrick and his wife, Penny, have been active working to elect candidates at the state and national level. He does lawn and garden work and tries to protect bees, butterflies, and birds. He is studying climate change and is working to slow the change. Past travels included a family trip to Colorado and Utah and a trip to South Carolina and Georgia as well as a week in New Hampshire at Squam Lake. Patrick gets satisfaction from family and science research and safe travel. His new hobbies include species protection, reading Scientific American, and bird watching.\n\nJoan Ratner and Alice Katz Berglas shared the news that their SDT sorority sister Laura Fisher passed away in late September after several illnesses. Laura’s life took a spectacular turn mid-career, when she left her job working for Eleanor Holmes Norton at the NYC Human Rights Commission, after winning a Channel 13 (PBS) auction that gave Laura a gallery space in an antiques and art building on Second Ave. and 56th St. in NYC (later on 61st St.). Laura transformed herself, acquired new expertise, and created a business of Americana quilts and folk art—becoming a highly respected voice and author in the field. Her antique quilts were stunning; it was a gift to witness her curated collection. Over the years, Laura became a frequent lecturer on folk art and wrote several books on the subject. Her fabulous smile, even more fabulous laugh, spirit, and friendship will be missed—as will her quick edgy wit that added spice to it all. ❖ Susan Rockford Bittker, ladyscienc@aol.com; Pete Salinger, petersalinger95@gmail.com.

It’s a collaboration with His Holiness the Dalai Lama and is available on Amazon as both paperback and e-book.”\n\nDavid Simon (Zurich, Switzerland; simon.md@gmx.ch) writes: “As an undergrad I was a member of the Glee Club, the Savoyards, and a musical comedy group (did Li’l Abner my junior year). After ten years of pediatric academic practice in the Bronx, I joined the pharmaceutical industry in clinical development and research (orthopedic pharmacology) in New Jersey and later in Zurich, Switzerland, where I transferred to Wyeth Pharmaceuticals (now a subsidiary of Pfizer), where I was European research director. I am now retired after five years of international consulting work, living in Zurich and enjoying the good life. Still in contact with several Cornellians via email and occasional visits to the US.”\n\nWhile it will likely not be practicable to include full accounts here of all departed classmates, I will try to provide more depth, space permitting, about some classmates’ multifaceted lives. Jacqueline Hoeppner-Freitas died last March 7 in Garden Valley, CA, of metastatic breast cancer. Her obit in the Placerville, CA, Mountain Democrat reads, in part: “Jackie graduated with a major in English. In 1969 Jackie received an MA in English education from the U. of Wisconsin, Madison and by the fall was teaching English at the College Preparatory School in Oakland, CA. In 1973 she returned to Madison and obtained another MA in English linguistics. From 1974­–85 she taught English to foreign students at UC Berkeley. She organized a faculty committee to research UC labor practices and took the university to court several times, arguing that it needed to provide faculty benefits for the teachers in the program. As a result, nine UC extension teachers were awarded yearly contracts, healthcare, and retirement benefits.\n\n“In 1981 Jackie married Jay Garcia, and after his early death, she went traveling along the coast on Highway 1 in California, coming upon a car that was precariously balanced on the side of a steep slope. She singlehandedly rescued the family from their car. Due to this life-changing incident, and with the desire to help and rescue people, she went through training with the Reserve Unit of the Oakland Police Force, received the Standards and Training Certificate, and was awarded ‘Rookie of the Year.’ There she met officer Tony Freitas, one of her trainers. She and Tony often worked together, not only in regular police calls but also in undercover operations, including prostitution sting operations. Although initially Tony thought of her only as a ‘Berkeley Broad,’ Jackie overcame his prejudices. They married in 1984, but only after Jackie finished watching a wild card playoff game between the Seattle Seahawks and the Los Angeles Raiders. They were late to their own wedding.\n\n“She was a lover of football and baseball and won the lottery to throw out the opening pitch for the Oakland As on Breast Cancer Awareness Day. One of her goals was to visit every baseball stadium in the US. She was a lover of travel, traveling with family and friends to France, Italy, Turkey, and Spain, and through Central America.” Jackie received her JD in 1988 from the UC Berkeley School of Law (then known as Boalt Hall) and was admitted to the California Bar. In May 1993 Jackie was responsible for a landmark California Court of Appeals decision (Jamshid-Negad v. Kessler), holding a Connecticut couple personally liable for damages caused by their teenage son, a freshman student at UC Berkeley.”\n\nPhoebe McGuire Nichols died at her home in Davis, CA, on February 21, 2021. Her obit in the Newcastle, ME, Lincoln County News reads, in part: “She studied printmaking and received a BFA from Cornell. She worked as a graphic designer for many years in New York, Boston, Virginia, and Maine. Her favorite job was in New York City, where she was an art editor on the American Heritage Dictionary in the 1960s. Being there, she said, was like encountering an early, human-based version of the internet: whatever your question, one of the dictionary’s experts could answer it. Phoebe was briefly married to Peter Hedblom of Annisquam, MA, and together they had a son, Sam. After her marriage to Peter ended, Phoebe met and fell in love with John Nichols. They were married for 38 years, until his death from cancer in 2012.\n\n“Phoebe and John were peripatetic and energetic, filled with wanderlust, and always itching to tackle new things. Among many other adventures, they opened a successful computer store in Waterville, made a foray into the antiques business, and eventually found their way to the local public school system, where Phoebe worked as a librarian. Designing, building, and rehabbing a chain of houses, they were both fearless in taking on big projects.\n\n“She was a richly talented visual artist. She showed her unique collages at local galleries; portraits of quirky, imaginary characters were a big hit, and many of them still hang on her friends’ walls. Phoebe was a writer as well, and crafted a vivid series of personal essays. She was justifiably proud of her sense of humor, which was generous, often sly, and sometimes downright dark. Active as a volunteer, she worked at the Skidompha Secondhand Book Shop and joined a hospice choir, among many other activities. She joined a quartet of ‘Ukeladies,’ four close friends whose musical stylings were heard up and down Lincoln County.” ❖ Richard Hoffman, 2925 28th St., NW, Washington, DC 20008; email, derhoff@yahoo.com. Online news form.\n\n1968\n\nThis is it—three-quarters of a century, or near that milestone, for those of us in the Class of ’68. I celebrated with family and longtime friends, but in a funny way I didn’t feel it was much of an accomplishment. Just like 65 is the new 55, I’m feeling like 75 is the new 65. I don’t think it’s old enough yet to have earned priority at the Statler. The moral is, keep yourself in shape, exercising and eating wisely, use all the gifts modern medicine offers, inherit longevity genes, and stay lucky, and perhaps we’ll be reading ’68 Class Notes online for quite some time.\n\nJames Kelly (JimXXJim@mac.com) and his siblings still care for their 101-year-old mom so she can remain in her home. But he wasn’t so lucky in the past year, as two of his beloved family pets died during the pandemic (unrelated to COVID, of course). Jim was productive in the face of the pandemic, writing 150 poems, now in a collection titled “The COVID Year.” Email Jim if you’re interested in reading some of them. With the prescribed safety precautions, he’s now beginning to resume his social life. Henry and Ellen Schaum Korn (HK@henrykorn.com) live in Larchmont, NY. They suggest that getting through the pandemic works best if you are resilient and creative and use your time productively.\n\nLinda Jacobsen lives in Groveland, FL, where she celebrated her 75th with her husband, children, brother, and sister-in-law—all vaccinated and observing the safety protocols. The pandemic interrupted her ideal retirement, which included river cruises through Europe along with ocean cruises to many spots around the world. Linda still finds time to post on Facebook the activities for her church. She passes on this insight about the morality of some people when dealing with COVID: while her family and close friends strictly adhere to the guidelines for social interactions, some people are willing to lie about their vaccination status and they really don’t care what happens to others. She credits many of the lessons she learned during her time at Cornell with teaching her tolerance and the need to explore all aspects of an issue before making a decision. I would add that we wish Linda well as she deals with the treatment of a glioblastoma diagnosed last January.\n\nHappily married and retired couple John and Mary Ann Tencza Landmesser (MaryannLandmesser@gmail.com) live in North Wales, PA. John retired in 2011 then went to work for their son, which was a great help to the business. John and Mary Ann recently bought a shore home in Stone Harbor, NJ, only two hours from their home in North Wales. They hope and plan that the Stone Harbor home will be a family summer retreat, much the same way as John’s parents’ home in Maine was years ago—and it’s nine hours closer than the Maine retreat, which should be an attraction, especially for their grandchildren. In normal times, John and Mary Ann have many activities with their family and friends. The pandemic allowed them more quiet time for reflection, and they are now ready for busier and better days.\n\nSad news was reported with the passing of Neal Sher. Neal is being noted in this column for the exemplary service he performed as the head of the federal department that rooted out WWII Nazis who illegally took up residence in the US. Of particular interest was the case of John Demjanjuk, who was caught while working for a major automobile company and who was believed to be “Ivan the Terrible,” the sadistic guard at Treblinka, a death camp in Poland. Tried and convicted in Israel, he was ultimately released by the Israeli Supreme Court for insufficient evidence of his identity, and he was returned to the US. For a more complete story and others, you can read this New York Times piece. Good to hear from so many of our classmates. ❖ Chuck Levitan, CLevitan22@comcast.net. Online news form.\n\n1969\n\nGuest columnist Tom Jones, MRP ’72, was asked to say a few words about himself. Tom entered the business world after graduation, with stints at “Big Eight” accounting firm Arthur Young & Co. and John Hancock Insurance Co., then he became president of pension manager TIAA-CREF and CEO of global investment management at Citigroup. Tom founded his own investment firm in 2005, where he continues to work. He says his greatest pleasures in life are his 46-year marriage to life partner Adelaide, four wonderful children, and four beautiful grandchildren. Tom authored a memoir, From Willard Straight to Wall Street, published by Cornell University Press in 2019, and he writes a blog on “Race in America,” which can be found at his website. Tom spoke at classmate Homer “Skip” Meade’s memorial service in August 2021; Skip passed on July 2, 2021. Tom’s remarks can be seen here.\n\nJohn Rees, ME ’70, writes that he and daughter Ashley discovered some new Cornell trivia: David “Doc” Robinson, PhD ’82, the lead singer in King Harvest, was a Government major and member of Delta Phi in the Cornell Class of ’69, and their hit song “Dancing in the Moonlight” (which reached as high as number ten on the pop charts) was written by Cornellian Sherman Kelly ’66, BA ’68! Bart Lubow says he’s retired from the Annie E. Casey Foundation and living in Southwest Louisiana. Ronald Schildge writes that he’s enjoying the beach, tennis, and golf on Seabrook Island while splitting time at his house in Asheville, NC. Ron is an elder at Johns Island Presbyterian Church, is ex-president of the Exchange Club of Kiawah-Seabrook, and was expecting his 16th grandchild when he wrote! Ronald especially values time spent with friends and family—“either remotely or directly.”\n\nT. Shepard Burr is retired as a CPA but continuing to work part time managing his real estate and mortgage broker businesses. He and spouse Fern are enjoying their quiet and beautiful five acres in the woods at Lake Mary, FL, where they’ve also been doing a lot of rehab and improvements on their 30-year-old house. They “look forward to excessive travel in the near future—and miss Broadway shows most.” Ann Goldsholl Varsano and spouse/classmate Samuel write that they’ve learned it’s better to have too little to do than too much; they’ve done both and less is best! “We love YouTube and Zoom lately,” says Ann. “I love to cook and have tried some vegetarian recipes. Luckily, Sam loves them!” Their oldest granddaughter, Logan ’23, is a junior at Cornell.\n\nDiane King writes that, while COVID has drastically limited available places to visit and local events, she has happily stayed healthy. She is staying in contact with friends and family through phone and text, and shares that she gets the most satisfaction in life from donating to agencies that help those most affected by COVID. Jerry Greene (jerry@bakedintel.com) is enjoying his second home in Catlin Valley, VT. He is retired from owning and operating Baked in Telluride, a bakery and casual dining and pizza restaurant in Colorado.\n\nSteve and Joan Wolfers Belkin write that they’re 50% retired and working on staying healthy. Their biggest takeaway from the pandemic is appreciation of health, family, and friends. Susan Owre Gelberg and spouse Howard, DVM ’71, PhD ’80, have moved to New Hampshire from Oregon, in part because of wildfires in Oregon, and are building a new home in Eastman Lakes Community. Susan is a retired psychologist and continues to write professionally, with one textbook on cultural competency for psychologists published in 2018 by Lexington Books. Susan and Howard write that they derive the most satisfaction from their marriage of 51 years and time with children and grandchildren.\n\nElizabeth Oshry Dietz (drlizrn@aol.com) turned “75 years young” last March. “I’m now in the last column of ages when filling out surveys. In fall 2021, I will return to San Jose State U. as a retired annuitant to teach the community health nursing clinical. I volunteer for the American Red Cross as disaster health services manager and disability integration regional lead in Silicon Valley, CA. I am also the disaster health services manager for the Virtual Family Assistance Center for families with COVID deaths and social service issues. I’ve been on ten virtual disaster assignments since 2020—the current one for four months.” Elizabeth and Larry have been married for 51 years and are now living in a condo in a retirement village in San Jose, CA. They have two sons, one nearby in San Jose and one in Pocatello, ID. Elizabeth happily reports four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.\n\nAndy Grundberg has written a new book, How Photography Became Contemporary Art, from Yale University Press, which was released in early April 2021. Scott Abramson tells us that he gets the most satisfaction from being alive and able to walk, talk, eat, see, smell, and touch! Stephen Goldberger writes, “I have a new life partner, Marylee Smith. We met on a dating site and are having a ball together! She’s a retired accountant and nurse, very well-traveled, and very well-informed. Can’t wait to show her Cornell at the next Reunion.” ❖ Tom Jones, twjones@optonline.net. Online news form.\n\nBack to the top\n\n1970s\n\n1970\n\nAs I sat down to write this column in early October, and looked at my saved previous efforts, I realized that it has been over a year that I have been the correspondent for our class. And a stressful yet amazing year it has been, as these notes will show. The most amazing change in this small world of alumni correspondents is the debut of the new Cornellians website, and the expansion of reach of these Class Notes to a much larger audience, as subscription is no longer required. If you are reading this, you already know how to find the Class Notes. However, here is the link for the new site, and where to find notes, so you can pass this along to the Cornellians in your life. The Class Notes are under the “Alumni Community” tab at cornellians.cornell.edu.\n\nSuzanne Grisez Martin (Cranbury, NJ; suzannegmartin@gmail.com) writes in late March that to help survive the pandemic, she took on a major house renovation of kitchen, laundry room, and a half bath, with hopes of completion by April. She is still working half time in her own business, as management consultant for healthcare systems and presentation skills. As with many classmates, Suzanne’s satisfaction in life comes from her grandchildren, Maddie, 10, and Xavier, 7. The pandemic has taught her that “keeping in touch with friends and family can get you through most anything.” R. Daniel Ladd Jr. (Bethesda, MD) has seen no change in work life due to already being retired. He has, however, had to stop gym visits. He is planning future trips and is proud of the newest grandson.\n\nArthur Litowitz (New Smyrna Beach, FL; arthur.litowitz@gmail.com), in addition to excellent daily physical and psychological exercises, begins each day by awakening to “Oblivion,” a tango. His energies are now focused on nonprofit organizations, Riverside Conservancy Inc., and Seat of the Soul Chair Yoga Inc. He mentions connecting with siblings—Susan Litowitz ’75 in Massachusetts and Budd Litowitz ’71 in North Carolina—and finding satisfaction in myriad art and creative activities, along with family and friends. Arthur’s takeaway from the pandemic is as follows: “Our species is part of nature and ‘all life on earth (including viruses),’ and we all need to be mindful of the sanctity of life and care for the condition of our planet Earth.”\n\nNicholas Adams (Amenia, NY) writes in early April that, unable to travel, he has used his time to explore the natural resources of Dutchess and Litchfield counties, walking daily one to two hours. He is still researching, reading, and writing, while having ended 40 years of teaching. Negative things have followed his son: first a lost job, then thyroid cancer. The positive has been surgery, and then finding a local job. What brings Nicholas the most satisfaction these days are a good night’s sleep, walking, reading, writing, and dinner with his wife. Facetiously, he says, the biggest takeaway from the pandemic has been “two large pizzas.”\n\nBob Gordon (Oakland, NJ; rgordondvm@gmail.com) writes in early April that his daily life is unchanged, as he continues to do veterinary medicine for companion animals. As with many classmates, he finds great satisfaction being busily in contact with his children and grandchildren, all nearby in northern New Jersey. Grandchild number six was recently born, and number seven is on the way! Bob finds satisfaction through frequent telephone conversations with classmate John Orduna Jr., now in Nebraska.\n\nPatrick Kelly (Ottawa, ON; pkelly42@sympatico.ca) writes again, in late March, that he has not worked in person as a mental health counselor since March 2020. One of his memorable efforts was in providing support for repatriated cruise passengers who were quarantined for 14 days before going home. All of this has been as a mental health professional with Health Canada. He is also part of a psychosocial emergency response team in support of public health nurses and federal employees, and he volunteers on a pro bono basis with the Canadian Red Cross and the Salvation Army. In his daily life, home renovation, bread-making, “walkabouts,” and doing random acts of kindness take up free time. Patrick’s largest takeaway from the pandemic has been as follows: “We are all in the same school—only different classes.” Ken Finch (Sacramento, CA; Ax2h22p.p@gmail.com) has moved to Sacramento, where he is now in adult independent living. He has been making web movies, while his daughter is doing well in Silicon Valley, and Ken finds that the most satisfaction in his life comes from his church friendship group.\n\nAgain, I am very grateful to have plenty of material from so many of you! And yes, there is a gap between receipt and publication. I attempt to do them all in chronological order, oldest first, up to my word limit. (This is so much like the old Cornell Daily Sun days!) After finishing up this month’s column, the remaining stack of responses begins with May and currently ends with last Tuesday (October 12). All will appear in future columns! Given all the uncertainty due to the pandemic as it surges and recedes, themes will change. So keep sending your notes! You may contact me directly, at my email or phone below. If I don’t answer, do leave a voicemail, and I will call you back. Or you may use the online news form. ❖ John Cecilia, jlcecilia96@gmail.com; tel., (312) 524-2912.\n\n1971\n\nI (Elisabeth Kaplan Boas) did some reporting for you, as Cara Nash Iason insists we mustn’t invent. Do send material about classmates—and yourself. NB: I am capable of fiction. Just sayin’…. Also: We publish email addresses only with permission.\n\nJay Kaplan posts on our Facebook page! Check these out! Share them as some classmates (e.g., Marc Cohen) have. Roaring Brook Nature Center (Canton, CT) director for 47-plus years, Jay posted daily essays on their page during the darkest days of the pandemic, scaling back after a year. Married for 39 years, he’s pleased that his two kids are “fully functioning adults with their own spouses,” living on their own. He has one grandchild. Jay is also longtime director of the Canton Land Conservation Trust and current member (and former chair) of its Conservation Commission, of the Hartford Audubon Society (where he’s also past president), and of the Connecticut Ornithological Assn.\n\nFrom Ithaca, Janis Kelly shares a summer highlight: seeing their daughter off for South Korea. Irena’s on Ithaca College’s fast-track Doctor of Physical Therapy program. For fall, she attended Hanyang U.’s biz school and danced with 1MILLION Dance Studio. (In this YouTube video, at around the 1:40 mark, look for a dancer in white hat and pants, dark hoodie.) “Not bad for a visiting Cambodian-American!” Janis adds, “With my spouse, the lovely and talented Ellie Rosenberg, we overnighted from JFK at the Cornell Club–New York and caught the Met’s Medici exhibition, Portraits and Politics, 1512–1570, which posits that Cosimo I was, essentially, an early ‘influencer,’ using art to promote Florence.” More information here. Take-home message? To become a Renaissance influencer: build your brand, grow your reach, secure your legacy. Lastly, “Bravo Cornell,” she shares, impressed by the University’s COVID response. Also from Ithaca, news from Richard Keyser: His life remains relatively unchanged. Having never had a wife or family of his own, he is free to work, mostly at odd hours and at night, doing jobs to which he’s easily adapted. He is not looking to retire.\n\nNaomi Katz Mintz has lived near Boston since attending Harvard Graduate School of Education. She and her husband, Lewis, have been in Acton, MA, since 1990. Their son’s family lives in NYC, with a kindergartener. Retired five years from teaching young kids (primarily kindergarten in public and private schools), Naomi credits Cornell’s Octagon with having propelled her onto the stage—and she’s been a performer and board president of community theater and directed eighth-grade musicals. (Fun fact: being completely in Hebrew added to the challenge and fun.) She’s still teaching Sunday School. (Fun fact: it’s a habit she began at Cornell!) That’s not all. She’s an active watercolorist, singer in the synagogue choir and Threshold Singers, and volunteer at Virginia Thurston Healing Garden. Attention ’71-ers: Naomi is reinventing the role of class historian, inaugurating a project for classmates to share first-person accounts of Cornell experiences. The intent is to transform our class’s experiences into a lasting part of the Cornell archives. Contact her for details or to participate. Naomi stays in close contact with Linda Fairchild Cushman and is in touch with Susan Devins Rubenstein, me, and the other class officers, Sue Smith Korbel, Sue Anderson Geise, Cindy Ross Timmerman, Daiva Tucker Woodworth, Kristin Vandenberg Whitfield, Susan Deitz Milmoe, and Martha Hurd Meredith.\n\nNearby in Brookline, MA, Thomas Nally (with wife Susan) is happily vaccinated, now able to do more with other people. He continues to work, although he’s finding it harder to keep his organization going as the pandemic ebbs. In addition to work at A Better City (coordinating infrastructure planning on HUGE projects), he enjoys Brookline-based civic work. And from Wayland, MA, Linda Davis Harrar (with husband George) shares her ambition to find ways to work together toward solving big problems like COVID-19 and climate change. She works for Boston’s WGBH (public broadcasting) currently trying to launch a climate solutions program out of NOVA Sciences series. Linda can be reached at lindaharrar@gmail.com.\n\nGilda Klein Linden (Fair Lawn, NJ; GKL4@cornell.edu) reminds us that “human connections are so important, including lots of hugs and smiles.” Many have benefitted from her gifts—30 years with the Fair Lawn Volunteer Ambulance Corps and as a volunteer at vaccine centers near her hometown! Last year, she and her husband began traveling the country in their camper—19 states as of last summer—and have a plan for getting to the remaining states. She loves time with family and has fun tallying overs"
