        "text": "Jessica Morris has been turning heads since she first stepped onto the streets of Llanview, Pennsylvania as Jennifer Rappaport on One Life to Live. Since then, she’s built an illustrious career which includes appearances on CSI: NY, Lucifier, Rosewood, The Other Hef, and dozens more. Currently, she’s starring as Crystal Amhurst, a trophy wife who’s willing to do just about anything to get her husband’s attention, on the Daytime Emmy-nominated mini-series, Ladies of the Lake. Pop Culturalist caught up with Jessica to chat about the show and learned about her exciting new project.\n\nPC: Tell us about Ladies of the Lake, your character, and what drew you to this project.\n\nJessica: When I first read the season one script for Ladies of the Lake, it reminded me a little of Desperate Housewives. A story of unhappy housewives told in a very fun and entertaining way. My character, Crystal, is quite good at keeping up appearances, while her world is falling apart around her. I was excited to play her so that I could show both sides of her. The side behind closed doors, and the one that the rest of the world sees. Also, producer Michael Caruso has an eye for details and a strong vision for all of his projects. I knew that he would make sure that everything from the set design to the wardrobe would be sophisticated and gorgeous.\n\nPC: How did you prepare to step into Crystal’s shoes?\n\nJessica: I like to daydream as my characters sometimes. I thought about Crystal’s desires and challenges and found ways that I could personally relate to her core needs.\n\nPC: As we head into season two, what can fans expect?\n\nJessica: They can expect this season to be darker, edgier and more action-packed.\n\nPC: What are some of the major differences between season one and season two?\n\nJessica: Season one was more about introducing the characters and showing how the women really come together and emotionally connect. Season two is more about the fallout after the women commit their crimes.\n\nPC: If you had to describe season two in five words, what would they be?\n\nJessica: Thrilling, exciting, fun, sexy, and mysterious.\n\nPC: How has Crystal changed since we last seen her?\n\nJessica: She is stronger and more capable of speaking up for herself.\n\nPC: Besides Ladies of the Lake, do you have any other upcoming projects that you can chat about?\n\nJessica: This fall, I have a thriller/horror coming out. I lead Tom Six’s (Director of The Human Centipede trilogy) The Onania Club, which is a very dark and shocking film. I look forward to its theatrical release. It has many societal messages that we are hoping will create a stir.\n\nPop Culturalist Speed Round\n\nPC: Guilty pleasure TV show?\n\nJessica: The Handmaid’s Tale\n\nPC: Guilty pleasure movie?\n\nJessica: Forrest Gump\n\nPC: Favorite book?\n\nJessica: Many Lives, Many Masters\n\nPC: Favorite play or musical?\n\nJessica: Annie\n\nPC: Favorite social media platform?\n\nJessica: Instagram\n\nPC: A band or artist that fans would be surprised to learn is on your playlist?\n\nJessica: I love Miranda Lambert\n\nPC: Last show you binge-watched?\n\nJessica: Mom\n\nPC: Hidden talent?\n\nJessica: I do a great impression of Falkor from The Neverending Story.\n\nMake sure to follow Jessica on Twitter and Instagram, and catch season two of Ladies of the Lake on Amazon Prime today!\n\nPhoto Credit: Tim Schaeffer"
