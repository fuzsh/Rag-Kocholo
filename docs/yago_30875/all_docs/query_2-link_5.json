        "text": "❤️ (Non-work post Friday!) In the Spring of 2018 I was wandering the UES of Manhattan when I bumped into an old college friend. She asked if I was single (I was) and then told me she was introducing me to her best friend - who owned a matchmaking service. My first thought was to say \"hell no.\" I had every app on my phone, and I didn't need a matchmaking service...but I'm also very much the type of person who likes to give everything a shot. I grabbed a breakfast with Lori Glover Zaslow - told her what I was looking for in a partner, and figured \"why not!\" Within a week I was set up with this girl who lived 2 blocks away from me. We were from the same hometown but had never crossed paths. How did I know she was the one? Midway through the first date, she pulled out her phone and said - \"so sorry, I need to check the score of the NBA Finals.\" 5+ years later and a ten-month old...here we are. Give everything a shot. Step outside your comfort zone. Try something you never ever imagined you'd ever do. Watch what happens. My little testimonial for Project Soulmate below! Happy Friday https://lnkd.in/eTCTTMfU #life #love"
