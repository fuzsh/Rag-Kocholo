        "text": "A married veterinarian accused of killing his pregnant girlfriend was sentenced to life in prison after pleading guilty to homicide and homicide of an unborn child.\n\nIn exchange for the plea, prosecutors agreed not to pursue the death penalty against\n\n, 31, of Upper Gwynedd Township in Montgomery County.\n\nDuring today's hearing in Lehigh County Court, Rapoport also agreed to waive all of his appeal rights during today's hearing.The sentences are consecutive. Rapoport's been held in Lehigh County Prison without bail since his March arrest.\n\nRapoport, who was married at the time of the murder, admitted to killing his pregnant girlfriend,\n\n27, of Lower Macungie Township.\n\nthe day before she was to have her first ultrasound appointment.\n\nthat Rapoport killed two people - Snyder and his unborn child - and that he knew Snyder was pregnant, according to Martin's office.\n\nPolice allege Rapoport carried on a lengthy affair with Snyder after meeting her at the Maple Hills Veterinary Clinic in Lower Macungie Township. But the affair cooled when Rapoport, who is married, learned Snyder was pregnant.\n\nRapoport put a pistol in Snyder's mouth and shooting her twice, then shot her a third time through the middle of her back, police said. He then wrapped her body in a bleach-soaked Eagles blanket and dumped her along Game Preserve Road in North Whitehall Township. Police said Rapoport left Snyder's car in a nearby dental office parking lot, along with a bottle of bleach and her OB/GYN paperwork.\n\nSnyder was 10 to 12 weeks pregnant with a boy, an autopsy showed.\n\nPolice began searching for Snyder when her abandoned car was found in the parking lot with bullet casings inside, blood on the seat and a shattered rear window.\n\nSnyder's roommate, Hilary Schiavone, told police she had last seen Snyder the morning of March 16 and she was going to see her boyfriend, Rapoport, and spend the night with him, court records say.\n\nWhen police went to Rapoport's home to question him, he initially denied recent contact with Snyder but later admitted he was trying to hide the affair from his wife, Elizabeth Rapoport, records state.\n\nRapoport consented to a search of his car, which turned up his gun, ammunition and a backpack containing blood-smeared duct tape and a blood-spotted box of baby wipes, records say.\n\nRapoport told police he planned to use the wipes to clean his car, police said.\n\nRapoport purchased the duct tape, bleach, a towel and baby wipes at a Target near his home the morning of March 16, records say."
