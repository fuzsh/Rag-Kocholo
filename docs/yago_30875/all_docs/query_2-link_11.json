        "text": "Brian was walking on his block in May of 2018 when an old college friend bumped into him and asked if he was seeing anyone. He wasn't - so she introduced him to her close friend, Lori (who happens to be REAL good at setting people up). 1 Week later he was on a blind date - and that was what brought Jenn and Brian together. She lived on 63rd & 2nd, he was on 65th & 2nd - yet they never once met. They went to Felice Wine Bar and realized they grew up in the same town, knew the same people, and shared the same interests. This was evident when Jenn (midway through their first date) said \"I don't mean to be rude, but I need to check the score of the NBA Finals.\" They both shared true love for The Knicks (yes...the Knicks) and the NBA. Over the next few months they got to know each other better, got to know each other's families, and had some truly memorable times...from cooking classes to lots of breakfasts at Silver Star to trips down to Florida to a quick trip to The Grammys. Because Brian first said \"I Love You\" to Jenn in MSG - he figured his proposal needed to incorporate a place that meant so much to the both of them. Early in the Fall of 2019, he told Jenn that they were getting a private tour of MSG (a work perk of his) and they'd get to check out the whole arena, along with the Knicks' locker room. She was psyched. On November 15th, 2019, when they got to the Knicks' locker room, there were roses surrounding the logo on the carpet, and there was one locker with a jersey in it....it had \"J. Rappaport\" on the back. We still don't know to this day if Jenn was laughing or crying (video provided upon request) - but she said \"Yes.\" This is what happens when \"Class Clown\" meets \"Most Hysterical Laugh.\" High School superlatives really do mean something!"
