        "text": "I think the big ones for me are Vicky/Marley AW and Brad ATWT.\n\nVicky/Marley AW, Ellen Wheeler really got Marley's heart. Her Vicky was more of a caricature, from what I've seen. Anne Heche, on the other hand, played everything of Vicky, she seemed to make her fly. She was also good as Marley (Marley's rape aftermath scenes were a particular highlight), but it took her several years to make Marley more than Vicky's boring sister with a bad wig. Jensen Buchanan seemed to be a caricature as Vicky and barely there as Marley. JB had little interest in Marley or a dual role, and in the long term this had a debilitating effect on Vicky's character. Marley disappeared and Vicky basically BECAME Marley.\n\nATWT Brad. Geez louise, talk about changes. Nick K's Brad was a rough around the edges guy who didn't mind taking the morally questionable way but was generally a decent man with scars. John Loprieno's Brad came across as a scuzzy con artist. Austin Peck's Brad was a goofy kid and at other times a self-righteous shouter.\n\nOthers...\n\nSarah Roberts OLTL. She went from being a \"punk\" and \"edgy\" scarred young woman to a dreary ingenue who instantly forgave her mother for years of neglect. The only thing they had in common was singing.\n\nCassie Callison OLTL. This was a big issue for longtime fans when I started watching OLTL 15 years ago. They would complain every time anyone mentioned the Holly Gagnier Cassie. They said she stole Dorian's boyfriend and she went around with her boobs hanging out a lot of the time.\n\nJoey Buchanan OLTL. Chris McKenna's Joey was very earnest. Nathan Fillion was much more humorous, at least until he began to lose his personality. Don Jeffcoat's Joey was a wimp, and a punching bag, the GV Lucky of his day. Bruce Michael Hall's Joey was back to being extremely earnest, and...he had nice nipples. That's about it.\n\nOLTL Todd Manning. This would take all day.\n\nOLTL Tina Andrea's Tina was ditzy but had a strong will and could do anything. Karen Witter's Tina was slightly quirky but much more mainstream. Krista Tesreau's Tina was very weak and dumb.\n\nOLTL\n\nClint - from Clint Ritchie to Jerry verDorn. I think the differences are too obvious to need description.\n\nJessica - BW has more of a \"sexpot\" air than ET ever did.\n\nCassie - Cusi Cram was the first and just a teen. Ava Haddad came next and Cassie was a likeable young woman. When Holly Gagnier took over, Cassie did indeed become sluttier, crasser and louder. More of a Crassie.\n\nMax - With J DePaiva, Max always seemed more the ladies' man. With Nicholas Walker, he just seemed more serious\n\nRyan's Hope had quite a few glaring ones:\n\nJoe Novak - Richard Muenz's Joe wanted out of the mob but was torn between his love for Siobhan and his love and loyalty for his uncle. For a long time you didn't even know how extensive his involvement was because they focused more on the romantic story, where he came off somewhat boyish and charming. When Roscoe Born took over, the writing for Joe turned more sinister. His was a slimier Joe.\n\nFrank Ryan - Michael Hawkins was wooden and almost his father Johnny's age yet he was reasonably good looking. Andrew Robinson was a better actor but a miscast as the handsome young politician. Daniel Hugh-Kelly brought the looks and the acting ability to the role. In this case it seemed the character of Frank was written pretty consistently all along and it was more a question of how successfully the actors pulled it off.\n\nSiobhan - Sarah Felder's was more of an in-your-face, rebellious, unglamorous type. Ann Gillespie's was more watered down.\n\nFaith - Faith Catlin was gawky and not beautiful. Catherine Hicks was cute/pretty and girlish. KMG was ice-Faith and hated her sister.\n\nAnd the famous Mary Ryan recasts were so unsuccessful, they finally killed the character off. By that time, the strong-willed heroine had morphed into more of a workaholic shrew.\n\nI do think Bree was cast as a sexpot but it's so hard to take her Jessica as a serious woman, she has been so victimized and most of her sexuality has been passed off to Tess, where it's cartoonlike. I thought that had changed with Brody but apparently not.\n\nThe RH recasts were often jarring.\n\nPat Ryan:\n\nMalcolm Groome Pat was goofy, edgy. John Blazo Pat was much more quiet and serious, and droll. I liked them both. Then we got the third Pat, briefly, who was just awful, like some Brady sibling with a bad attitude. Then the fourth Pat, who seemed to just be a generic hunk.\n\nDelia Reid Ryan Ryan Coleridge:\n\nIlene Kristen's Delia was more of a strong force, whereas Randall Edwards's Delia was ditzier and more vulnerable, at least when the show bothered to write for her.\n\nI have never really seen Robin Mattson's Delia.\n\nDAYS\n\nKate Roberts under Deborah Adair was very much a lady of dignity who took herself very seriously. She worked hard to create a life for herself and she worked to maintain the image, she was careful and smart and confident. That Kate lasted 2 years...Lauren Koslow's Kate is far more sexual, fun, devious and fiery. Koslow's Kate knows what life on the skids is like, loathes the idea of going back to it and will be damned before she hits the skids again.\n\nEssentially, Adair went for understated while Koslow has gone for aggressive. I feel Koslow's interpretation is why Kate is still around...I feel Adair's Kate would have developed into Marlena 2.0 and would have been killed off ages ago. I mean, could you ever believe that Deborah Adair's Kate could have been a hooker? I can't. I remember Koslow having to do a flashback to Kate working as a stripper and she pulled it off perfectly.\n\nY&R\n\nJill Abbott changed radically when Jess Walton took over from Brenda Dickson. The magic of Dickson's first run as Jill was long gone when she came back in the mid 80s...she played Jill like a midwestern Alexis Carrington and it just didn't work. Walton's Jill is angrier, harder, sadder, more ferocious and above all wiser. Her Jill is a far more layered character and I found the writing reflected that. Jill was still Jill, but the angles changed."
