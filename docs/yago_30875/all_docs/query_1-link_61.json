Meme was born to Joseph Stark and Rella Herman Stark in Brooklyn, NY, was their youngest child, and last of her generation. Predeceased by her husband Hyman Serchuk, her parents and siblings Libby & Sol and her precious son, Robert Jonathan Morris. She is survived by her daughters, Andrea Ribner (Michael Landau) and Cindy Morris, her stepsons, Peter Serchuk (Michele), Steve Serchuk (Nancy), and Fred Serchuk (Sandra). Her grandchildren, Jordan, Jennifer, Jessica (Ryan), Joni (Brian), Erica, and Robbi (Matt), Justin (Jess), AJ (Cailey). Big Meme leaves behind her pride and joy, her great-grandchildren Tatashaints, Mamashaints, and Tatie, from whom she schlepped much nachas. Also, nieces, nephews, and many, many friends who are family. Services were reluctantly but respectfully held at Gutterman’s Memorial Chapel followed by burial at Wellwood Cemetery.\n\nShe was our best friend, confidante, senior advisor, maven, and CEO. Shirley was always wise and loving, loving, loving. Mom was our sun and we were her planets. Our universe is forever broken. Her constant guidance led us and many friends and family to make what would become fateful decisions at life’s crossroads, twists and turns.\n\nA Life Recipe from Shirley’s Kitchen: Ingredients:\n\nAn ounce of Pleasure\n\n• An ounce of Love\n\n• An ounce of Contentment • An ounce of Happiness\n\n• An ounce of Family\n\nInstructions:\n\nNever wait to say I love you, I love you, I love you\n\nAlways ask: How are you? How is your family? How is business?\n\nSee the world with your glass always full. Not half empty or half full.\n\nStay positive throughout life’s challenges.\n\nMom highly recommends you try it.\n\nHad you met Mom in the lobby of the Empire State Building, when she was employed on the 78th floor, by Floor 35 she would have known your life story, been your new best friend, and given you her strong (unsolicited) advice on how to resolve your problems. She advised all to “Never put the bar too low. Always reach extra high for your life’s goals.” Mom always made friends with everyone and loved them regardless of their status in life.\n\nAs an avid bookworm, she loved reading all the best sellers from the New York Times on her Kindle, and downloaded hundreds of books. She loved all things antique, including clocks, depression glass, and all manner of dishes, serving platters, silverware and barware in order to serve 45 persons per day holidays. (This included all two-day Jewish holidays; Mom was capable of shopping, cooking, preparing and serving up to 90 people.).\n\nOur parents and grandparents were founding members of the Ozone Park Jewish Center, and Mom has been a continuous member for more than 75 years. She was extremely proud of her Jewish heritage and supported many Jewish philanthropic organizations and the Cystic Fibrosis (65 Roses) Foundation.\n\nMeme could make any dish from a rock. It could be chicken, meat or fish and she cooked it into something delicious, and delectable. Well known for her matzo ball soup with sinkers, (just kidding, Ma!—they were always floaters!), and her homemade gefilte fish, fresh caught from Lake Superior, chopped liver and brisket. Mom had an incredible palate and the ability to taste anything then go home and duplicate the recipe.\n\nDuring the 2020 COVID pandemic, Mom had to endure strict lockdown procedures. We were unable to see her in person, hug or kiss her, but Mom adapted and used modern technology to avoid isolation and separation from us. She learned to FaceTime, and meet on her iPhone. She joined the Facebook Yiddish Group and added her interpretations, meanings and idioms to the chat. Her responses were hilarious and spot on accurate. Mom never got COVID, however she broke her right hip during the lockdown. Please advocate for the best healthcare for your older loved ones whenever necessary.\n\nWe felt lucky to have celebrated her 95th birthday party, with 40 of her closest friends and family. We played games, distributed “Famous Facts about Shirley” questions, generally teased and roasted Mom to uproarious laughter. And sang, what was to be her last, “Happy Birthday, Dear Shirley.” We are very sad that the Save the Date Poster we wrote: Coming Soon: Shirley’s 96th Birthday: March 23, 2023 will not be celebrated with a party in her honor.\n\nMeme had a presence in all of our lives, including her nieces and nephews, Fredy Selss (Fred), Randy Brooks (Bonnie), Jon Brooks, Ronni Greenberg (Bruce), Jane Berger (Stu) and their children and grandchildren, and her adored cousins, Harold Goodman (Fern), Robin Ingram (Steve), and their families.\n\nMeme will be forever missed. To all who knew her, we’re sure she made you smile and laugh.\n\nOur family would like to thank Mom’s wonderful caregivers throughout her years. Mom always appreciated their kindness and attentiveness. And always said “Thank you.”\n\nAs gracious, generous and giving as she was in life, she was blessed to have\n\nthe words of the Shema on her lips, as she passed away. Her last word in this world was “amen”. She passed away while holding both her daughter’s hands. She will always be our “conduit” to eternity, never to break the electricity we held between and within us.\n\nIn honor and memory of our dear Hawaiian Girl, we feel very blessed to answer and all say, amen.\n\nDonations can be made in memory of our beloved mother, grandmother and great-grandmother to:\n\nWindow Fund, Ozone Park Jewish Center, 107-01 Crossbay Boulevard Ozone Park, New York, 11417.\n\nOur synagogue thanks you, as a once thriving congregation it has shrunk due to changing demographics. A break-in last year caused major damage, and dry rot was discovered around the stained glass windows of the sanctuary. Fortunately, our Grandmother Rella’s window suffered no direct damage. We have taken on this mission to fund the repairs, in honor and memory of our Dear Mother.\n\nOur family continues to lovingly support our synagogue with our membership, in honor of our multigenerational heritage and history. Three generations of names of our beloved family adorn the sanctuary, the lob- by and other places of honor in the building that our family’s blood, sweat and tears assisted in erecting about 75 years ago.\n\nOur family thanks you in advance for your thoughtfulness and generosity.\n\nFinally, we will miss our “Shirleyisms” that our family has joyfully heard and cherished all through the years: “I love you. I love you. I love you.” “You are my heart of hearts.” “Are you hungry?” “Did ya help?”\n\nOf great comfort to us, is the feeling that Mom is reunited with our Brother Robert, her parents, siblings and husband, and all whom she dearly loved.\n\nWe thank all who predeceased her for their “patience” while waiting for Mom.\n\nWe will selfishly miss her.\n\n5/26/22\n\nDr. RICHARD FELCH80, of Delmar, May 20, 2022; survived by wife Bernadette Felch; sons Jonathan (Gigi) Felch and Andrew (Emily Kriss) Felch; and sister Deborah Buglisi.\n\nDUFFY KIVORT80, of Rexford, May 18, 2022; survived by husband Adrian; son Jody; and grandchild Jacob.\n\nESTELLE LEVITT83, of Albany, May 18, 2022; widow of Aaron Levitt; survived by daughters, Layne (Rich) Zagorski, Amy (Dan) Rosenberg and Sherry Tim) Sullivan; grandchildren Erin Sullivan, Lexi Zagorski, Caitlyn Sullivan, Skye Zagorski and Jonah Rosenberg.\n\nJACK NEWMAN96, of Florida, May 22, 2022.\n\nMARK PLAAT72, of Albany, May 13, 2022; survived by wife Nancy (Leicht) Plaat; sons Louis (Holly Proper-Plaat) Plaat and Daniel Plaat; grandchildren Adelaide, Ellanora, Seraphina, and Rosetta; and sister Tina Ponzo.\n\nROBIN RAPAPORT81, of Sarasota, Fla., formerly of Loudonville, May 14, 2022; survived by wife Linda Rosenblatt Rapaport; daughter Lisa (Charles S.
