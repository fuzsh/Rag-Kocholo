        "text": "On December 20, 2023, Aaron Buchanan and his family received some tough news at UVA Medical Center in Charlottesville. Aaron immediately made it clear to all the loves of his life with him at that moment that although he's going to heaven, he wasn't going that day. He was letting his family know that he intended to enjoy what he had, with all of them, while he could, and he did...while holding onto his faith in God and his security in eternal salvation. Aaron was called to his Lord's side on February 16, 2024, from UVA Medical ICU, with his family by his side. Over the past two months he went to baseball practices at VMI for his youngest son as well as volleyball tournaments for his daughter, and returned to work, where he loved being around his students and coworkers. He further busied himself making plans to attend every baseball game and track meet possible for his sons and daughter, as he prepared their RV to hit the road...it's ready to go.\n\nAaron's top vocation was sharing his love with everyone, as well as his pranks. Over his working career he worked several jobs in which he devoted himself completely at each career stop, from insurance sales to contract sales at 84 Lumber, to finally his favorite career stop by far...teaching at the Russell County Career and Technology Center, while he also drove a school bus. He cared for all of his students in his classroom who lovingly referred to him as \"Bucky,\" for those that were fortunate enough to ride the magic school bus his personality and love for those children shined through. He would continuously push them to not get bogged down with the little things and to remain focused on where they wanted to go, to dream big, and always go forward with a great attitude. Aaron's vocational classes' projects, their work, are scattered all over Lebanon. If there was a need in the community that he felt his classes could meet, they were taken on. In that, his students learned the personal value of contributing to their community. Of course, the job that he was the greatest at was being a loving father to his four children, and husband to his favorite person in his world.\n\nAaron was also very involved in his church and community. He and his family are devoted members of the Free Hill Baptist Church in Nickelsville, VA, where everyone who attended were extended members of their family. Over the past few decades, the place he and his family were, perhaps even more than their home, was the ball fields and gyms all over SWVA and the US following his kids while encouraging them to â€˜Live life every day and make as many friends as possible. Aaron also followed in his great grandfather's, grandfather's, and father-in-law's footsteps by becoming a member of the Freemasons.\n\nBorn on November 25, 1968, Aaron was the oldest child of Aaron 'Dean' and Olga Buchanan of Lebanon, VA. He is survived by both of his parents, as well as his brother, Eric (Holly) Buchanan, and sister, Deana (Joe) Jessee. Aaron is also survived by his wife of 31 years, Stephanie Buchanan, his perfect teammate, and companion in all things. Aaron and Stephanie have four beautiful children, Cole, Matthew, Seth, and Rileigh; as well as one addition the whole family loves as their own, Caitlynn Dye. Aaron was welcomed with open arms by his father and mother-in-law, Andrew and Becky Hartsock, as well as his brother-in-law, Brian Hartsock, who loved him as one of their own\n\nA Celebration of life service will be conducted Tuesday February 20, 2024, at Gracewood Community Church in Lebanon, VA at 11 am with the Rev. Darrell Fletcher, Rev. Larry Beavers, and Pastor Chris Musick officiating. Burial will follow in the Free Hill Baptist Church Cemetery. The family will receive friends from 5-8 pm on Monday February 19th also at Gracewood. A Masonic Service will be conducted at 7 pm. The family will continue to receive friends following the service.\n\nPallbearers will be Cole Buchanan, Matthew Buchanan, Seth Buchanan, Eric Buchanan, Shannon Brooks, Chuck Farmer, Brian Hartsock, and Eric Steele.\n\nHonorary pallbearers will be the staff of the Russell County Career and Technology Center.\n\nExpressions of sympathy may be made on Combs-Hess Funeral Service Facebook page and our website at www.chfunerals.com. Combs-Hess Funeral Service, 291 Hwy 71 Fincastle Road, Lebanon, VA 24266, (276) 889-4444, is serving the Buchanan family."
