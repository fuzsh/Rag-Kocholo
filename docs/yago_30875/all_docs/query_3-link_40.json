        "text": "Did you know that One Life to Live was Elisabeth Rhm's big break? Yep, her first acting role was playing Dorothy Hayes on the show from 1997 to 1998. Funny fact: She had an on-screen romance with Nathan Fillion's Joey! Elisabeth later moved on to the role we all probably know her best for, ADA Serena Southerlyn on Law & Order.\n\nBefore he was playing crime novelist Richard Castle on ABC's dramedy Castle, Nathan Fillion stirred up trouble as Joey Buchanan, son of the popular main character Victoria Lord. One of his more memorable stories was when he romanced a much older woman—his mother's nemesis. His mom became so enraged that during a recurrence of her dissociative identity disorder (natch!) she kidnapped her son's lover and held her hostage until she promised to end the May-December romance.\n\nLong before Beyoncé and Jay-Z's baby became the most famous person ever named Blue, Blair Underwood played the character Bobby Blue on One Life to Live from 1985 to 1986. He went on to bigger roles on L.A. Law and The New Adventures of Old Christine and, of course, playing Miranda's doctor boyfriend Robert Leeds on Sex and the City.\n\nBetween her roles as Bree Van de Kamp on Desperate Housewives and Dr. Kimberly Shaw on Melrose Place, Marcia Cross has acted out countless dramatic moments on TV. But one of the best ever took place during her tenure playing Kate Sanders on OLTL from 1986 to 1987. She was marrying the man of her dreams, Cord Roberts, when his \"dead\" wife busted in on the ceremony to announce she was alive and pregnant with his baby.\n\nThese days Bryan Cranston is mixing up trouble on Breaking Bad—and winning loads of awards for it—but back in 1985 he had a short-lived role playing Dean Stella on One Life to Live. Between the soaps and his role on Malcolm in the Middle, he appeared in a potpourri of other shows through the years, including Baywatch, CHiPs and Touched by an Angel.\n\nSure, Ryan Phillippe's acting skills were a little rough back in 1992 and 1993 when he appeared in his first role ever as Billy Douglas on One Life to Live. But the part will remain unforgettable because the character was one of the first gay teenagers on a daytime show. Although Ryan has gone on to movie roles (including the Oscar-winning Crash), the episode in which Billy came out on OLTL is still one of daytime TV's most memorable moments.\n\nKelly McGillis' role on One Life to Live, playing Glenda Livingston in 1984, didn't go so well—she was ultimately replaced! But that freed her up for bigger and better projects...like a primo part in a little movie called Top Gun, which hit theaters just two years later. Like the old saying goes: Things happen for a reason.\n\nNathan Fillion wasn't the only actor to play Joey in the 43 years the daytime show was on the air. There were at least five other actors, including Kyle Chandler. While his stay in Llanview was brief, it helped prepare Kyle for prime-time and his best role yet as Coach on Friday Night Lights. We're sure his shiny new Emmy that he won last year for FNL makes up for getting axed from a soap.\n\nIt's a bird...It's a plane...It's Brandon Routh on One Life to Live! Before he got to don superhero tights as the title character in the 2006 flick Superman Returns, Brandon was troublemaker Seth Anderson on One Life from 2001 to 2002. Tights weren't part of his daytime job.\n\nWhen Hayden Panettiere was just five, she made her acting debut as Sarah Roberts on OLTL. She stuck around on the show until 1997, when she hopped over to a competing show, Guiding Light. She broke out of daytime and later landed a role on TV's Heroes as well as a bunch of movies, including Scream 4.\n\nWe love Krysten Ritter from Breaking Bad, Veronica Mars and Confessions of a Shopaholic, to name a few, and we can't wait for her new TV comedy, Don't Trust the B---h in Apartment 23, slated to debut this spring. But did you know that the raven-haired model turned actress has a soap background? One of her credits includes a small role playing an investigator named Kay on the show in 2004.\n\nBefore she was a reality-TV star, Alex McCord was an actress, appearing as a recurring character named McCarthy on One Life to Live. Of course, that was a bit part compared with her large role today on Bravo's The Real Housewives of New York City.\n\nBack in 1997, Rainn Wilson was already making people LOL. The funnyman had a brief but memorable role in 1997 on OLTL—it was also his first TV gig—playing an aspiring standup comedian named Casey Keegan. Of course, he went on to star in Almost Famous and, his role of roles, playing Dwight Schrute in NBC's The Office.\n\nAfter having a supporting role in the classic movie Love Story, Tommy Lee Jones was looking for steady work and found it playing Dr. Mark Toland on One Life from 1971 to 1975. He went on to a stellar movie career and received three Academy Award nominations, winning one as best supporting actor for The Fugitive. Coming soon, you'll be able to see him partnering with Will Smith again for Men in Black III."
