Morris told PEOPLE: “Finding true love is not always easy.” She added, “We complete each other. We have always felt that we were each other’s missing puzzle piece, and when we are together, our puzzle is complete and we are happy.”

Taking to her Instagram, Jessica expressed: “It’s official! I’m so happy to announce that I am now Mrs. Hillis! 😃❤️#newlymarried #newlyweds #wedidit #peoplemagazine #exclusive”
