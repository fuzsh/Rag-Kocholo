SANTA MONICA, Calif. – James L. White, who wrote the screenplay for “Ray,” the 2004 movie about singer Ray Charles, has died in California. He was 67.

His attorney, Matthew Saver, says in a statement that White died Thursday from cancer at his home in Santa Monica.

“Ray” received a best-picture Oscar nomination. It was White’s only feature credit, although he worked on unproduced screenplays.

White told the Los Angeles Times (http://lat.ms/1JoJuBw ) that he and Ray Charles bonded while he was working on the screenplay after the singer learned that they both had grown up in the rural, segregated South.

Both at one time also had been heroin addicts.

White is survived by his wife, Elizabeth, and three children.

There will be no funeral services at White’s request.
