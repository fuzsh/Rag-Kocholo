        "text": "U.S. # 4807\n\n2013 46¢ Ray Charles\n\nMusic Icons\n\nHandicapped by blindness, burdened by racism, and orphaned at age 15, Ray Charles (1930-2004) overcame these immense challenges to become a music pioneer. His fusion of rhythm and blues with gospel and jazz helped give birth to rock ”˜n’ roll, prompting Frank Sinatra to call Charles “the only true genius in show business.”\n\nGlaucoma robbed Charles of his vision by age seven, but his mother pushed him to be self-sufficient. Charles chopped wood and even drove a motorcycle. His real love was music, a talent he honed while attending the Florida School for the Deaf and Blind.\n\nQuitting school after his mother died, Charles moved to Seattle at 17 and began recording. Two years later, he had his first hit with Confession Blues. A decade of hits followed before Charles scored his first country music chart topper, helping to integrate that style. His signature tune, Georgia On My Mind, became that state’s official song.\n\nFollowing a series of high profile appearances in the 1990s, Charles died at the age of 73. Over 1,500 fans attended his funeral, which featured performances by B.B. King, Willie Nelson, and Stevie Wonder... stars whose careers benefited because Charles had already broken barriers of race and physical handicap.\n\nThe 2013 Ray Charles stamp features a photo by Yves CarrÃ©re taken late in his career. The stamp and full pane were designed to resemble a 45rpm record sleeve, with the pane picturing part of a record peeking through the top.\n\nValue: 46¢ 1-ounce first-class letter rate\n\nIssued: September 23, 2013\n\nFirst Day City: Los Angeles, CA and Atlanta, GA\n\nType of Stamp: Commemorative Printed by: Banknote Corporation of America for Sennett Security Products\n\nMethod: Offset printing in sheets of 144 in 9 panes of 16\n\nPerforation: Serpentine Die Cut 10 ½\n\nSelf-Adhesive\n\nQuantity Printed: 60,000,000 stamps\n\nFirst Inductees In Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame\n\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame was the brainchild of businessman, Atlantic Records co-founder, songwriter, and philanthropist Ahmet Ertegun. He, Rolling Stone publisher Jann Wenner, and several record executives established the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation on April 20, 1983.\n\nNearly a decade later, the museum officially opened on September 2, 1995, with performances by Chuck Berry, Bob Dylan, Al Green, Jerry Lee Lewis, Aretha Franklin, Bruce Springsteen, Iggy Pop, John Fogerty, John Mellencamp, and many others. While the museum is located in Cleveland, most of the induction ceremonies (26) have been held in New York City, while two have been in Los Angeles and four in Cleveland.\n\nClick here for more about the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."
