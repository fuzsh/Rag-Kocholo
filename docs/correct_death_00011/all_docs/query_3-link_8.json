That I don‚Äôt wonder what he would have thought of today‚Äôs world, the events, the music. Even though I was barely 10 when he passed, I could still hear the way he would call me ‚Äúlittle Johnny‚Äù in that way that was more like a buddy than a dad but with the unconditional love that only a parent can give.\n\nI‚Äôm not sure what Heaven looks like but I am sure it plays salsa music and you‚Äôre there with that smile and those dance moves, making sure everyone is having a good time. Love you Pop!‚Äù ‚Äî by John Lugo-Trebble @jlugotrebblewriter #worldaidsday #worldaidsday2023 #whatisrememberedlives\".",
