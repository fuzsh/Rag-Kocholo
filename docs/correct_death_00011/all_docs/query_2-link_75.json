        "text": "We use scientific methods to learn how and why a person has died. The information we gather can influence the outcome of court cases, and help surviving family members protect their own health.\n\nAutopsy and results\n\nAn autopsy is a thorough physical examination of a body to determine how and why a person died. The examination can also identify disease, injury and other conditions that might not have been obvious when the person was alive. Upon request, certain family members (spouse, children, parents and siblings) may be entitled to an autopsy report.\n\nRequest an autopsy report\n\nIn some cases, an autopsy is required by law. If you think your loved one would object to an autopsy based on their religious beliefs, tell the medical examiner right away. We will work with you to find a solution.\n\nAlso, sometimes the medical examiner must keep larger portions of tissues or even whole organs to fully examine them. If you want those returned, write to our office within two weeks of the autopsy and make arrangements through a funeral director. Otherwise, the tissues and organs are destroyed.\n\nOrgan and tissue donation\n\nAn investigator or hospital staff may have already approached you about donating your loved one’s tissues or organs. If not, and you’re interested in donation, tell the medical examiner staff right away.\n\nClothing and property\n\nThe medical examiner will account for all the property and clothing brought into the office and store them in a secure area. In most cases, we release clothing and property to the funeral home. The police might hold items that could affect a criminal case.\n\nPublic and nonpublic information\n\nCertain information about the death is available to the public, including full name; age; race; gender; home address; date, time and location of injury; date, time and location of death, and brief descriptive comments. Other information about the death is available only to next-of-kin (usually a spouse, children, parents and siblings), and personal lawyers and doctors. We release some information about the death to the public, but most is protected and only available to next of kin.\n\nMake an information request\n\nAuthorization for release of records form\n\nRequest a death certificate\n\nHennepin County\n\nDakota County\n\nScott County\n\nFor deaths occurring in other Minnesota counties, request a death certificate from state vital records.\n\nRelease of the body\n\nThe funeral home may receive the body only with permission from the person with the legal right to decide what happens to the body. In most cases, this is next of kin, but it could also be a health care agent or a member of the extended family. This person must inform the medical examiner’s office if someone else will be making decisions about the body.\n\nInformation on Minnesota Funeral Homes\n\nNext of Kin (NOK) Authorization for Removal\n\nNext of Kin (NOK) Relinquishment of Rights to Make Funeral Arrangements\n\nAffidavit of Religious Beliefs\n\nBurial assistance\n\nWhen families can’t afford burial or cremation, the county may be able to help with those expenses.\n\nHomicide or violent crime deaths - contact victim services at the county attorney's office\n\nOther deaths - contact the county's burial assistance program\n\nBurial assistance for Dakota County residents\n\nBurial assistance for Scott County residents\n\nFEMA disaster funeral assistance\n\nFEMA COVID-19 funeral assistance\n\nForms for genetic and paternity testing\n\nPaternity specimen release form\n\nGenetic testing consent form\n\nRequest a death certificate\n\nAccess to death certificates is limited.\n\nLearn who can get one and how to apply.\n\nRequest data\n\nOn request, certain data about death investigations are available.\n\nMake a data request.\n\nType and cost of reports\n\nFor a fee, you can request several standard reports from the medical examiner's office, if you're allowed to do so under state law. Send fees by check or money order to the Hennepin County Medical Examiner.\n\nAutopsy Report $50\n\nOnly the deceased person's next of kin, treating physicians and authorized attorneys can request an autopsy report. Next of kin is usually a spouse, children, parents or siblings. Autopsy reports may also become part of a court record, or released by court order. The fee for an autopsy report may be waived for the next-of-kin.\n\nCause of death hierarchy $30\n\nThis report provides the cause and manner of death, and toxicology results. This report has non-public data and the person requesting it must get legal authorization.\n\nMedical Examiner Final $30\n\nThis is a summary of case details including cause and manner of death, brief history, summary concerning the demise. This report has non-public data and the person requesting it must get legal authorization.\n\nMedical Examiner Investigative Reports $60\n\nInvestigative reports contain the deceased person’s name, age, race, gender, home address, the legal next of kin, location of death, injury detail, narrative and additional reports. This report has non-public data and the person requesting it must get legal authorization.\n\nPhotos $100\n\nWhen photos are available, next of kin, treating physicians and authorized attorneys can request photos of the death scene and autopsy. Next of kin are usually a spouse, children, parents and siblings. Photos may also become part of a court record, or released by court order.\n\nComplete Medical Examiner file $325\n\nThis report has non-public data and the person requesting it must have legal authorization.\n\nPublic data form (No charge)\n\nThis form has all the public data on a deceased person.\n\nThank you for your interest in learning more about the field of forensic science. We have linked some information below where you may find answers to your questions — at least enough to get you started thinking about forensics. Good luck in your future pursuits.\n\nEducational opportunities\n\nWe have a strong educational mission to train future medical doctors and forensic pathologists. Our office has an accredited fellowship program in forensic pathology, and collaborates with the University of Minnesota and Hennepin County Medical Center to provide rotational opportunities for medical students and residents.\n\nWe also partner with the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension to provide specialized training to law enforcement officers.\n\nJob classifications for medical examiner jobs in Hennepin County\n\nOur staff is a team of professionals with varied skills and educational backgrounds. Some of the careers that are utilized in our office include those listed below, where you can learn more about these careers and what knowledge, skills and abilities we look for when hiring new team members.\n\nAssistant Medical Examiner (PDF, 1MB)\n\nMedical Examiner Investigator (PDF, 1MB)\n\nMedical Examiner Technician (PDF, 1MB)\n\nResources\n\nSo you want to be a medical detective?\n\nAAFS – American Academy of Forensic Sciences\n\nABMDI – American Board of Medicolegal Death Investigators\n\nCitizens Academy\n\nInterview with Hennepin County medical examiner, Andrew Baker\n\nWhat educational qualifications do you need to become a medical examiner?\n\nBeing a medical examiner in the United States requires a college degree, a medical degree (MD or DO), residency training in anatomical or anatomical and clinical pathology (generally 3-4 years), and a year-long fellowship in forensic pathology. Both the pathology residency and the forensic pathology fellowship are followed by board certification examinations.\n\nHow would you describe what your job entails?\n\nA typical day in the life of a medical examiner usually starts with reading new cases and deciding which cases need autopsies or other further investigation. Depending on the day of the week, a medical examiner might next perform one or more autopsies. Later in the day, after autopsies are completed, you would find the medical examiner returning phone calls to families, editing autopsy reports, signing death certificates, teaching, or meeting with attorneys in preparation for an upcoming trial.\n\nWhat is the most rewarding part of your job?\n\nThe most rewarding part of being a medical examiner is using medical skills to solve mysteries. Many of the deaths we investigate are not fully explained until a complete autopsy and extensive laboratory work are done. Our skills provide answers to families, the public, and the courts that they would otherwise not have.\n\nWhat is a common misconception people have about what you do?\n\nMedical examiners on TV are often portrayed as an arm of law enforcement or the criminal justice system. In reality, we are completely independent of those. Medical examiners are doctors whose work happens to sometimes overlap with the law enforcement or the criminal justice systems, and we use our medical skills to inform them.\n\nWhat is the most memorable experience you’ve had as a medical examiner?\n\nI was one of the core team of forensic pathologists that identified and autopsied all the people killed in the September 11, 2001, attack on American Airlines Flight 77 and the Pentagon in Washington DC.\n\nWhat are you the most proud of?\n\nIn 2017, I worked pro bono on a case for the Innocence Project. My work and my testimony helped secure the exoneration of a woman who spent 15 years in prison for a murder she could not possibly have committed.\n\nIf I wanted to be a medical examiner, what courses should I take to prepare?\n\nThe most important thing a young person can do is make sure your college advisor knows, on day one, that you are planning to apply to medical school. Your premedical advisor will make sure you take all the courses required for medical school admission. Beyond those courses, there is nothing specific you need to do to prepare for a future as a medical examiner. My personal advice would be to take as many courses outside the sciences as you can — the arts, humanities, literature, history, social sciences — that will make you a well-rounded person and physician. Honing your writing and public speaking skills will serve you well as a medical examiner."
