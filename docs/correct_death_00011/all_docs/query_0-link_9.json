        "text": "American singer-songwriter and record producer\n\nThis article is about the singer. For his eponymous album, see Brian McKnight (album).\n\nBrian Kainoa Makoa McKnight Sr.[1] (born Brian Kelly McKnight; June 5, 1969) is an American singer, songwriter, actor, record producer, radio personality, and multi-instrumentalist.[2][3] An R&B performer, he is recognized for his strong head voice, high belting range, and melisma.\n\nHis first hit song, \"Love Is\" (with Vanessa Williams) was recorded for the Beverly Hills, 90210 soundtrack in 1993, and peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100. That same year, his single \"One Last Cry\" peaked at number 13 on the chart and spawned from his eponymous debut studio album (1992), which was released by Mercury Records the year prior and received platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). His 1997 single, \"You Should Be Mine (Don't Waste Your Time)\" (featuring Mase) peaked within the top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100 and led his third album, Anytime (1997)—his final release with Mercury before he signed with Motown. His 1999 single, \"Back at One\" peaked at number two on the chart and remains his highest-charting song; it preceded the album of the same name (1999), which was the first of four of his albums—Superhero (2001), U Turn (2003), and Gemini (2005)—to consecutively debut within the top ten of the Billboard 200. His ninth album, Ten (2006) marked his final major label release.\n\nHis work has earned him 16 Grammy Award nominations,[4] third only to Zubin Mehta and Snoop Dogg for the record of most nominations for the award without a win.[5]\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nMcKnight was born in Buffalo, New York to Claude McKnight, Jr. and Ruth Elaine Willis. His music experience began in childhood when he became a member of his church choir, which was directed by his grandfather. McKnight explored different genres of music, and in his early teens he started musical ambitions by composing instrumental material while learning to play several instruments. McKnight formed a band and began performing his original songs at local venues. By the age of 18, he was offered a publishing deal.[6]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nMercury Records: Brian McKnight and Anytime (1990–1997)\n\n[edit]\n\nMcKnight's older brother, Claude V. McKnight III (and his band Take 6), signed a record deal with Warner Brothers subsidiary Reprise Records in 1987, releasing their self-titled debut in the Spring of 1988. This encouraged McKnight to shop his own demo tapes, and by the age of 19 he signed his first recording deal with Mercury Records subsidiary, Wing Records.[7] His self-titled debut album Brian McKnight was released in 1992, and peaked at number 58 on the Billboard 200 chart. His first release was \"The Way Love Goes\", which peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.[8] The album also featured the ballad and Top 20 single, \"One Last Cry\". It was followed by two more albums for Mercury, I Remember You (1995) and Anytime (1997). Anytime, McKnight's final album with Mercury, sold over two million copies and was nominated for a Grammy. The video for \"Anytime\", directed by Darren Grant, was nominated for Best Male Video at the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards. In 1997, McKnight recorded \"Remember the Magic\" for Walt Disney World's 25th anniversary.[citation needed] After the release of his self-titled debut album, McKnight was part of the group Black Men United alongside Gerald Levert, his then-labelmate Joe, Christopher Williams, Boyz II Men, and others for the song \"U Will Know\", featured on the soundtrack to the film Jason's Lyric, released in late 1994, in which he produced it with D'Angelo.\n\nMotown Records: Bethlehem and Back at One (1998–2004)\n\n[edit]\n\nMcKnight signed with Motown in 1998 and released a Christmas album, Bethlehem, the first of five albums he released on Motown.\n\nIn 1998, McKnight was a guest star on the show Sister Sister. He appeared in multiple episodes, as Tia and Tamera's college professor.\n\nIn 1999, McKnight released Back at One, his most successful album to date, which eventually went on to sell over three million copies. Additionally, Back at One is one of four of McKnight's studio albums to reach the Top 10 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, reaching number 7 on October 9, 1999.[9]\n\nIn 2004, McKnight co-wrote the song \"Wait\" with Australian soul artist Guy Sebastian, which appeared on Sebastian's Beautiful Life album.\n\nWarner Brothers: Ten and media/radio gigs (2005–2014)\n\n[edit]\n\nIn late 2005, McKnight signed with Warner Bros. Records and released the album Ten during December 2006. It was his only studio album with the label. Three singles were released from the album: \"Find Myself in You\" (which originally appeared on the soundtrack to the 2006 Tyler Perry movie Madea's Family Reunion), \"Used to Be My Girl\" and \"What's My Name\".\n\nIn October 2007, McKnight made his Broadway debut in the show Chicago.[citation needed]\n\nBetween 2006 and 2010, McKnight hosted The Brian McKnight Morning Show, a radio show with Pat Prescott on KTWV The Wave in Los Angeles. The show was briefly simulcast on KHJZ-FM, Smooth Jazz 95.7 The Wave in Houston, Texas. In January 2009, McKnight hosted \"The Brian McKnight Show\" on 98.7 KISS FM in New York City.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2009, McKnight appeared in the eighth season of Celebrity Apprentice.[10] Each celebrity played to raise money for the charity of his or her choice. McKnight elected to play for Youthville USA.[citation needed]\n\nBetween September 2009 and May 2010, McKnight served as the media personality and hosted[11] The Brian McKnight Show, a late night talk show billed as a combination of talk and variety which aired in syndication.\n\nMcKnight sang the National Anthem for MLB Opening Day in Cincinnati, Ohio with his sons Brian, Jr. and Niko on March 31, 2011. He had previously sung the National Anthem for the 1997 NBA All-Star Game in Cleveland, Game 6 of the 2002 World Series in Anaheim, California (near his Los Angeles home), and the 2005 Major League Baseball All-Star Game in Detroit. He has also made numerous other \"National Anthem\" appearances throughout his career. Additionally, McKnight sang \"God Bless America\" in the 7th inning of Game 7 of the National League Champion Series in San Francisco on October 22, 2012.[citation needed]\n\nOn April 23, 2012, McKnight posted to YouTube \"If You're Ready To Learn\", which has been characterized by Billboard as a \"filthy jam\". Billboard selected this lyric from the work to quote: \"Let me show you how your p—y works / Since you didn't bring it to me first.\"[12] Other media outlets such as MTV, the Toronto Sun, and NewMediaRockstars[13] have also written about McKnight's recent, more adult-oriented efforts.[14][15] Shortly after the single's release, McKnight and Funny or Die revealed that the single was a collaboration between the two. McKnight later explained that he wrote the parody as a commentary on the state of R&B, which he noted was in a period of degradation overall with famous radio station 98.7 Kiss FM shuttering and hit singles being inferior quality music, among other ailments.[16]\n\nBrian McKnight Music and Kobalt: Better (2015–2016)\n\n[edit]\n\nOn August 14, 2015, McKnight released the single \"Uh Oh Feeling\", the first track from his album Better. It was released on his own label, Brian McKnight Music LLC via Kobalt Label Services.[17] Better was released on February 26, 2016. The album received positive reviews.[18]\n\nSoNo Recording: An Evening with... and Genesis (2016–present)\n\n[edit]\n\nOn September 23, 2016 (twenty years from the date of his studio album Anytime), McKnight released his first live CD, DVD and Blu-ray collection entitled An Evening with Brian McKnight (in partnership with independent recording label, SoNo Recording Group, via the Universal Music Group). The concert was recorded in Los Angeles, at the historic Saban Theatre. The release includes fourteen songs performed live with his full band, plus three newly written and recorded songs. The first single, \"Everything\", reached the Top 20 on the national Adult Contemporary charts in September 2016. The CD version of the concert debuted on the Billboard R&B chart at number 13, as a Hot Shot Debut. Also included, is a duet with Gino Vannelli, on the song \"Brothers in the End\". The Blu-ray and DVD version of the release premiered on the Billboard Music DVD chart at number 9.[citation needed]\n\nMcKnight released the album Genesis on August 25, 2017.[19] It featured three Top 30 Urban AC and AC hits: \"Everything\", \"Forever\" and \"I Want U\". Genesis premiered on the Nielsen SoundScan Top 10 Current R&B Albums and Top 20 Current Hip Hop/R&B Albums. The album was produced by Tim Kelley, part of the legendary duo Tim & Bob.[citation needed]\n\nIn January 2018, McKnight was nominated for two NAACP Image Awards. He was nominated for Outstanding Male Artist and Outstanding Album for Genesis (alongside Bruno Mars, Charlie Wilson, Kendrick Lamar, Jay-Z and Mary J Blige).[citation needed]\n\nIn May 2018, McKnight announced he was working on his next studio album tentatively titled Bedtime Story, which would be 60 minutes of music \"for the bedroom aka baby-making music\".[20]\n\nIn 2021, Brian McKnight competed on The Masked Singer spin-off The Masked Dancer as \"Cricket\".\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nMcKnight was married from 1990-2003 to singer-songwriter, Julie McKnight, and they have two sons together.[21] McKnight also has a daughter he fathered from a previous relationship.[21]\n\nIn 2014, he began dating Dr. Leilani Malia Mendoza, a pediatric neurophysiologist, and they announced their engagement in May 2017.[22] On December 29, 2017, McKnight and Mendoza were married.[23] Mendoza has two children from a previous relationship. McKnight and Mendoza had a son who died in infancy.[24] In December 2022, McKnight and Mendoza had another son, Brian Kainoa Makoa Jr.[1] McKnight legally changed his name to Brian Kainoa Makoa McKnight Sr. to match his new son's name.[1]\n\nReligion\n\n[edit]\n\nBrian McKnight was raised a Seventh-day Adventist. Religion was important in the McKnight family, with many generations being Seventh-day Adventists. His grandfather was a pastor of a church, and his mother played the piano and sang in a gospel choir in Buffalo's Emanuel Temple. Being the youngest of four boys, McKnight became a member of an a cappella gospel quartet with his brothers. He also attended Oakwood College, a Seventh-day Adventist university in Huntsville, Alabama, from 1987 to 1989. In his second year, McKnight got into trouble for violating Oakwood's rules about dormitory visitors for having his girlfriend in his dorm room. They were both expelled.[25][26]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Brian McKnight discography\n\nStudio albums\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2000 A Diva's
