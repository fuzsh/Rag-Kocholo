        "text": "American rock'n'roll star Eddie Cochran died during the afternoon of Easter Sunday 17th April 1960.\n\nHis death in St. Martin's Hospital in Bath, came as a result of injuries sustained in a car crash just outside Chippenham, late the night before.\n\nEddie and his great friend Gene Vincent had been touring the UK since mid-January, on a package tour that had created a sensation amongst UK rock n roll fans.\n\nNot one, but two genuine American rock'n'roll stars, criss-crossing the UK and even making TV and radio appearances!\n\nBy then, the first flush of raw rock'n'roll was long gone, so the sight and sound of Gene and Eddie was an antidote to the blandness of much pop music at that time. They were nothing short of a revelationâ€¦ Eddie in particular.\n\nOften described as 'James Dean with a guitar', Eddie Cochran had everything going for him.\n\nA young, good-looking guy, a hugely talented musician, who as well playing stunning guitar, could also handle bass and drums and most unusually for those times, also wrote his own songs.\n\nTwo of which - 'Summertime Blues' and 'C'mon Everybody', had been huge hits and today - nearly 50 years on - are regarded as classics of the genre.\n\nEddie had arrived in the UK on 10th January 1960, to join a UK tour with Gene Vincent which had already been on the road since before Christmas.\n\nIt was promoted by top pop impresario Larry Parnes and the support acts and musicians were all young UK rock'n'rollers that Parnes had under contract.\n\nThese included at various times along the tour - Billy Fury, Joe Brown, Georgie Fame, Vince Eager and Johnny Gentle.\n\nIt was a long tour with a punishing schedule, and the British winter was not something that California-resident Cochran was used to.\n\nSo by the time they all rolled up at the Bristol Hippodrome on Monday 11th April for a week-long residency, Eddie (and his accompanying girlfriend, songwriter Sharon Sheeley) were looking forward to returning to the USA immediately afterwards.\n\nFor this last week of the tour, Billy and Joe were off playing elsewhere and the support acts included Georgie Fame, Johnny Gentle and also Tony Sheridan - who a year later would make a record in Germany, with an unknown Liverpool group called The Beatles.\n\nAfter the final show on Saturday 16th April - and back at the Royal Hotel to collect their things - Eddie wanted a lift back to London with Johnny Gentle, who had driven himself to Bristol, but his car was full.\n\nThere were no more trains at that time of night, so a taxi was called. Sometime after 11.00pm, a Ford Consul driven by George Martin, with Eddie, Gene, Sharon and tour-manager Pat Thompkins, set off for London.\n\nEddie, Sharon and Gene sat in the back, with Thompkins next to the driver.\n\nThese were pre-M4 days, so Martin initially chose the old A4 down through Bath, but with this being a bad road, especially at night, he decided on a short cut on the outskirts of Chippenham.\n\n\"On your right is the A4 and then the bridge and on your left is the A4 to London.\n\n\"Well, he saw the A4 and turned right, going the wrong way. When he saw the milestone, he realized he was going the wrong way and hit the brakes.\"\n\nIt appears that as the car sped out of Chippenham trying to get back on the right route, Martin lost control on the bend at Rowden Hill, (then a notorious accident black-spot) and spun backwards into a concrete lamp post.\n\nThe impact sent Eddie up into the roof and forced the rear door open, throwing him onto the road.\n\nAfter the car had come to a halt, Martin and Thompkins were able to walk away from the wreckage uninjured. But Gene and Sharon, along with Eddie were lying on the grass verge.\n\nGene had broken his collarbone, but fortunately for Sharon, she only suffered shock and bruising.\n\nHowever, the injuries to Eddie would prove fatal.\n\nThe noise had brought local residents onto the scene. Dave Chivers told the Wiltshire Times: \"I was getting into bed when I heard a whistling outside, followed by a series of bumps and smashes.\n\n\"I went outside and saw the wrecked car, several people lying about, a large guitar and scattered photographs, which had come from the open boot. I telephoned for an ambulance from the kiosk nearby.\"\n\nThe first police on the scene included a young Wiltshire cadet called Dave Harman, who with a name change to Dave Dee, become a highly successful pop star himself.\n\nThe time of the accident can be accurately pinpointed. In those days the street lights went out at midnight and the ambulance from Chippenham arrived soon after, in total darkness.\n\nThe three were taken to St Martin's hospital, but Eddie had suffered severe brain damage. He never regained consciousness and died at 4.10pm that afternoon.\n\nLike Buddy Holly who came our way two years earlier, Eddie Cochran also had a profound influence on young aspiring British musicians.\n\nJoe Brown has often said what a great and innovative guitar player Eddie was, introducing styles and techniques that had never been seen here before.\n\nGeorgie Fame totally credits Eddie with introducing the music of Ray Charles to a mainstream UK audience, through his playing of Charles' songs in his stage act.\n\nShadows drummer Brian Bennett backed Eddie on the tour, as a member of Marty Wilde's band, who were loaned out to Cochran for some of the live dates and also his BBC radio sessions for the Saturday Club show.\n\nBrian recalls Eddie showing him some great drum tricks and said what a great player he was.\n\nPete Townshend and Roger Daltrey both idolised Eddie and of course, 'Summertime Blues' was for years a Who stage-favourite.\n\nIronically, the biggest UK hits for Eddie's songs 'C'mon Everybody' and 'Somethin' Else', came in 1979, when The Sex Pistols took them both to number three in the charts.\n\nGeorge Harrison had seen Eddie when the tour played Liverpool and even acquired an important piece of Eddie memorabilia; In 1999 I worked on a radio series for the BBC World Service with Paul McCartney, looking back at his early rock'n'roll years.\n\nPaul recalled the-then unknown Beatles touring Scotland backing Johnny Gentle in 1960.\n\nEddie had given Gentle his stage shirt after the Bristol show and following a week of pestering by the young Beatle, Johnny eventually passed it to George.\n\nJohnny came to one of the Eddie Cochran Weekender events in Chippenham, where I interviewed him live on air. He too said what an amazing talent Eddie was, and also said he wished he'd kept that shirt!\n\nIn the case of Eddie Cochran, I think there can be little doubt he would have been the first 'guitar-hero' of the sixties, with Clapton, Beck, Page and Hendrix queuing up to play with him.\n\nJimi always said he wanted Eddie Cochran played at his funeral, and he got his wish.\n\nWhat makes this whole story even more poignant, is how young Eddie was when he took his seat in the car that night - just 21.\n\nToday, that dangerous bend at Rowden Hill, Chippenham has long since been made safe. There is no longer any physical reminder of the tragedy, except for one thing - a plaque on the grass verge in memory of Eddie.\n\nIt was erected by fans and unveiled at one of Chippenham's Eddie Cochran Weekender events by Sharon Sheeley, on what was her first visit since that fateful night at Easter 1960."
