Feb. 6, 1957\n\nCarl Bauserman, 46, of Geneva Dies Suddenly\n\nWilliam Carl Bauserman, 46, prominent Geneva man and lineman for the Indiana and Michigan Electric Company for 27 years, died suddenly Monday afternoon while on top of a 20-foot utility pole at the west edge of Poneto, on State Highway 118, 14 miles west of Berne. Death was attributed to a coronary occlusion. Dr. Joy Buckner, Wells County Coroner conducted an autopsy of the body and announced the verdict. First reports were that Bauserman had been electrocuted but no burns were found on the body and the autopsy disclosed the coronary occlusion. Mr. Bauserman was known to have a heart ailment and he was asked by his physician to curtail some of his activities. However, the ailment had not been believed serious. Bauserman had been in Berne shortly before his death. While here he received word to go to Poneto to help on a project there. Another electrical company workman, Robert Rose, 4306 Anthony Wayne Drive, was with Bauserman at the time. Rose had been installing capacitor control equipment at the base of the pole when he experienced difficulty. He called for assistance and Bauserman ws sent to assist. While Rose remained on the ground, Bauserman climbed the pole. When the climber was near the pole top, Rose turned away and walked to his truck. Suddenly, he heard a groan and turned. He saw Bauserman, supported by his safety belt, slumped over a cross bar of the pole. Rose dashed to a nearby farm home and called for help (rest is missing) [Buried Monroeville Memorial Cemetery; Monroeville, Allen County, Indiana]\n\nAdams County (IN) Historical Museum 1955 March-April 1958 Scrapbook, image 91\n\nContributed by Janice Vasilovski\n\nKeith Stuart Beltz\n\nKeith Stuart Beltz, 58, passed away Saturday September 24, 2016 at Lutheran Hospital in Ft Wayne, IN.

Born Aug. 20, 1932, in Bronx, N.Y., along with twin sister Janet, she was a daughter of the late Florence and Dallas Marquardt. In the late 30's, the family moved back to their parent's family state of Indiana and settled in Gary. She and Janet attended Lew Wallace High School and were one set of five twins in their graduating class of 1950! Both twins attended and graduated from Purdue University. She then began a teaching career working with special education students. Later, she married Milford Creed, a U.S. Steel design engineer, and together they had four children. She was a \"professional mom\" in every way, making her family the most important priority of her life. In 1970, she and her family moved to Walkerton. She enjoyed flower gardening and fine art, among so many things. She was always thankful for the little things the most, like a good cup of coffee and a phone call from a friend. After her children were all out of the house, she provided home care services to many in the Northern Indiana community. Her sincere compassion for others in need was endless. Twenty years after her youngest child had graduated high school, she was still getting hugs from grown-ups that would see her in the local grocery store and would stop to say that they remembered coming over to her house as kids. She would always sweetly put her arm around their shoulders and ask them \"If they had had enough to eat today\". Her kitchen was always open and well stocked! She is survived by her loving family: twin sister, Janet McCarty of Dunlap, Ill.; daughter, Lisa Creed Much of Dallas, Texas; son, Stuart Creed of San Diego, Calif.; daughter, Amy Creed of Dallas, Texas; son, David Creed of Chicago, Ill.; ex-husband of 42 years, Milford Creed of Kerrville, Texas; and one loving and handsome grandson, William Creed, who fondly called her \"Grandma Jane\". Of course, there are many kind in-laws and dear lifelong friends all over the world that will miss her big smile and big heart. She will be buried next to her parents in Monroeville at 2 p.m. (EST) today, with a short service beforehand.
