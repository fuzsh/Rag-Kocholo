My info was from Lloyd Bates so you have everything that I have. Motherâs Father was an Atwater so we arenât Burnham's but Iâve enjoyed learning the family history of Margaret Carter Atwater Burnham, especially the English side. I do have a picture of Bernard Boucher Carter if youâre interested. Margaret wrote: Hi I received your email from Uncle Alan. Delighted to keep in touch with family members. I do have the copied of family line Auntie kept. Lloyd I think had those copies from Auntie. He had put lots of info on Family Search. I have found so much more with Ancestory.com. I linked an English site and they found information. My husband Mikel and Kristen and Ryan live in Reno. Since I have been working on the family line about 1 year I have enjoyed connecting with family members I have never met, and emailing as well. Karen Meyer\n\nDate: Monday, October 2004 9;25;38 PM\n\nHi, I received a e Mail from Margaret Macom, Subject below, and told her I would check with you. âHi just returned from a visit with Aunt Virg who still lives in Corona del Mar. We were going over the Carter history--and she said that Aunt Emily had the family bible and some letters from the relatives in England. She wondered if you have any idea where they ended up. She had copies of a letter that she said sheâd gotten from Emily. Anyway, I told her iâd check with you. If you have any idea let me know and Iâll pass it on to her. So I am!!!! if you know let me know and Iâll get back to Maggie.
