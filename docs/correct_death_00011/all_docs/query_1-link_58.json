        "text": "Every album comes with a backstory, but not many come with two. Rakim's new project G.O.D's Network (REB7RTH), out July 26, came together in a few quick months, from signing a deal in February 2024 to completion in June. The process was spurred by one dedicated A&R person frantically combing through his network of rappers to get guest verses over beats produced by the God MC himself.\n\nBut to hear that A&R man, Matt \"M80\" Markoff, tell it, creating the seven-song project didn't take four months. It took four years.\n\n\"I've known [Rakim's longtime manager] Matt [Kemp] and Rakim since 2007,\" Markoff tells me when I get him on the phone in late June. \"They're used to getting calls from me a couple of times a year just for, like, show referrals, verse referrals, things of that nature.\"\n\nBack at the beginning of the pandemic, Markoff had been talking to the folks at Fat Beats, the venerable record store-turned-distributor that's a huge name in independent hip-hop. He mentioned Rakim's name to the company, and Fat Beats responded that they'd love a project from the God MC. The original pitch, Markoff remembers, was \"a three or four song EP with some remixes.\"\n\nRakim quoted his price, Fat Beats agreed, and the project was underway, with the emcee meeting with producers to look for beats. But Rakim, who hasn't released a solo album since 2009's The Seventh Seal, is not one to be hurried.\n\n\"Ra was having [DJ] Premier and Pete Rock and Ninth Wonder and some of these people come to the studio,\" Markoff says. \"Because of scheduling conflicts and stuff and, you know, normal course of life, it just wasn't right. The vibe wasn't there.\"\n\nThat's where Jazzy Jeff came into play. Rakim and the legendary DJ began working together and, per Markoff, it \"just meshed.\" It seemed like, instead of a handful of songs, a full-length record was in the offing.\n\n\"As soon as they finish the first song, I walk into Fat Beats and say, ‘Hey, this is what we're doing now,'\" the A&R man recalls. \"Instead of Rakim with random producers, it's Rakim/Jazzy Jeff. That'll be huge.\"\n\nThen…nothing.\n\nA few years pass, and the Rakim and Jazzy Jeff project is still unfinished. (Rakim described its status as \"We have a couple records already done.\") Fat Beats, which was on the auction block (it was eventually sold in March 2024), wants its money back. Rakim obliges, and everyone seems set to forget about the whole thing.\n\nMarkoff, however, was not about to give up on working with the man he calls \"my favorite emcee of all time.\"\n\nThe revamped album started its life as not an album at all. Instead, the original conception was a model Markoff had used before: licensing beats by people not typically thought of as producers. In this case, he'd be offering aspiring rappers the chance to get beats by arguably the most influential rapper of all time.\n\n\"He's taken people who are not necessarily known as producers and put together beat packages for them,\" manager Matt Kemp says of Markoff. \"And then, one of the things he does is he goes out and he licenses those beats through a company that he has. If you're a European artist that wouldn't necessarily have access to things like that, you can get it.\"\n\nSo that, as of February of this year, was the (revamped) plan: have Rakim do six beats and one verse, and sell non-exclusive licenses, so that any rapper, anywhere in the world, who wants to use them in a song of their own could do so. This, indeed, was a vision that was followed through all the way to the finish line — you can see the end result released July 12, priced between $700-$1,050 depending on what you want to do with the beats and the rhyme, here.\n\nBut along the way to creating that package, things got significantly more complicated. As Rakim was making the beats, he found he really liked them. In some cases, he even wanted to rhyme on them himself.\n\n\"As the beats started coming together and Rakim was really in the studio and we started putting the rhymes onto them, we realized that it was bigger just than that [original vision],\" Matt Kemp said.\n\nThe wheels started turning. Rakim, the God MC, as a producer? That would be a project worth sharing with the world, not just a few aspiring artists.\n\nAs it turns out, unbeknownst even to many Ra fans, the rapper has been making beats since the beginning. In fact, he produced — and played drums on — one of Eric B and Rakim's classic songs, 1992's \"Juice (Know the Ledge).\" So producing an entire project didn't seem like such a big stretch after all.\n\nFor the project's lead single, \"BE ILL,\" he got in plenty of internal rhymes. And the song's tempo allowed him to come up with different rhythms.\n\n\"When tracks are at that speed, I'm able to manipulate time and space to come up with different rhythms because I have so much time and space to deal with,\" he says. \"It was one of them songs I loved rhyming to. Just having fun with words and phrases, and at the same time having so much on my mind to say.\"\n\n\"I'm trying to say a lot of things,\" Ra admits when discussing his writing on the album. \"It's hard to just come back and say a verse when you've been gone so long. So I tried to be very specific and cautious with the words that I chose, and try to be entertaining at the same time. So it was a little nerve wracking.\"\n\nEven with Rakim's vocal contributions (he ends up with either verses or hooks on six of the project's seven tracks), more was needed to complete the songs. That's where Markoff really got going.\n\n\"Literally, I didn't waste a single day,\" he remembers. \"I was calling the artists in my network. I reached out to each artist one by one, and let each artist go through the folder [of beats] with me and make their picks.\"\n\nAmong the artists Markoff reached out to were several members of the Wu-Tang Clan. He has a long relationship with the crew, having worked with them on several projects including the well-regarded 2005 album Wu-Tang Meet the Indie Culture.\n\nMarkoff recalls the exact moment when he lined up Wu member Masta Killa for his appearance on what became \"BE ILL.\"\n\n\"I was at the first ever Wu-Tang Clan residency in Vegas, and I told Masta Killa, ‘Dude, I just got these Rakim beats 10 minutes ago.' I played 10 seconds of the second beat, which was the beat for ‘BE ILL.' And he was like, ‘That's the one.'\"\n\nA different Wu-Tang show was responsible for one of the album's other notable guest appearances, Cash Money stalwart B.G. The two met at the concert, and the Louisiana rapper was in the studio \"48 hours later,\" Markoff recalls.\n\nFor a handful of artists he had good long-term relationships with, Markoff let them choose which of Rakim's beats they wanted to rap over. In addition to Masta Killa, he names Chino XL, Hus Kingpin, 38 Spesh, and TriState as being on that short list. After that, he says, it was all his decision.\n\nThe end result is a list of some of the top rappers in his Rolodex: Kool G. Rap, Method Man, Kurupt, Canibus, KXNG Crooked, Skyzoo, Joell Ortiz, and many more — including an outro from Snoop Dogg. But one of the most surprising things on the tracklist is that a number of the guests aren't alive anymore.\n\nNipsey Hussle, Prodigy, DMX, and Fred the Godson have verses on the record. All of them were people Markoff had worked with in some capacity over the course of his career. He says that all of the verses were \"in my stash or under my ownership.\" So when he was looking for material for the Rakim project, they were a perfect fit.\n\nThe Nipsey Hussle contribution in particular stood out so much that the entire song, \"Love Is the Message,\" was designed around it. The project's engineer placed Neighborhood Nip's verse first, and everyone else listened to that when recording.\n\n\"We kind of glorified who he is, and came up with the title ‘Love Is the Message' to put everything in perspective,\" Rakim tells me. \"So everybody vibed off of that and everything that we implemented had to have that feel or had to be in that direction.\"\n\nOne thing Rakim noticed as he was listening to the contributions coming in? Many of them were paying tribute to him. In particular, B.G. says in his verse that he's \"on a song with the greatest.\"\n\n\"To hear things like that from my peers is a beautiful thing,\" says Rakim, who also admits to tearing up when hearing Snoop Dogg praise him on the outro of one of the album's songs. \"Hip-hop is one of the more, I guess, feisty genres. It's hard to get that love from your peers. So it's a real blessing to hear it from people like that, to hear what they think of you and to say that on records. A lot of people might think that of you, but would never say it on a record.\"\n\nFor Markoff, B.G.'s tribute was particularly meaningful because of the rapper's history. He began his career in a duo, and later a quartet, with another rapper sometimes considered the greatest of all time, Lil Wayne.\n\n\"For B.G. to have that history, but acknowledge Rakim — I was speechless,\" Markoff confides. \"It was really cool to see. It's like, ‘I'm not just going to say my partner, my friend, my confidant Lil Wayne's the best because we grew up together.'\"\n\nFinally, after all the guest verses came in, the project was ready. Seven songs, entirely produced by Rakim, with raps by him and a broad cross-section of artists. The question, then: what exactly is this project? An album? An EP? Rakim's big comeback? A teaser for his eventual full-length return?\n\nTo Markoff, none of these labels are important. He's not concerned about fans being disappointed that a project under Rakim's name features only a handful of the rapper's verses.\n\n\"The fan is going to look at it however they want to look at it,\" he says. \"The negative people will stay negative. It wouldn't matter if it was the greatest album of all time. The positive people that are so grateful that I stepped up to the plate to help bring new Rakim music to the world are going to love it.\"\n\nAfter all, he continues, \"The whole point originally when we started making it was letting his peers shine on Rakim beats. The fact that this project morphed into something that Rakim literally is on 95% of, I couldn't have asked for more of a blessing.\"\n\nSo Matt Markoff, the boy who fell in love with Rakim's music at 12 is now, three decades later, putting out music from his hero.\n\n\"Dream fulfilled,\" he says right before we hang up. \"Now I gotta figure out what I'm going to do for the rest of my life.\"\n\nDr. Dog arrives during a critical year for Slick. An active solo artist on top of Dr. Dog, session work and other group efforts, he released an eccentric new album, New Age Rage, back in April. Naturally, working with Dr. Dog has incontrovertibly influenced his solo work.\n\nPlus, Dr. Dog's last show at press time — a sold-out Colorado amphitheater gig — was a watershed for Slick, as the historically timid singer got to sing his first-ever lead vocal on a Dr. Dog album — the lovely \"Tell Your Friends\" — live onstage for the first time, the crowd singing every word.\n\nRead on for Slick's account of that special moment, as well as all things Dr. Dog.\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity.\n\nYou've written about not being able to catch a break from the critics, but Dr. Dog just performed a sold-out show at Red Rocks. What does that tell you about music critics' authority — or lack thereof?\n\nI mean, with Dr. Dog, I feel like our fan base has gotten riled up by the fact that critics don't tend to like us. Even when they do like us, there's usually some sort of backhanded compliment or there's some issue that is taken with the band's reluctance to change, or at least what it seems like on the surface.\n\nI think the constant criticism that we get is that our albums don't tend to show a lot of growth. Maybe if you're not paying attention that might seem true, but I feel like we put a lot of emphasis on trying new things. It's just like we sound the way that we sound.\n\n[Founding member] Scott McMicken is kind of a musical genius, isn't he?\n\nScott is extremely prolific, and I used to live with him back in West Philadelphia in, like, 2010. I would go to bed, and then there'd be a CD slipped underneath my door of the 12 songs he wrote that night.\n\nHe's just one of those people. He's kind of like Robert Pollard in that way. He has no filter, and he's so prolific, and loves to record. He loves to record on his Portastudio. It's his life, and he's so good at it, and he's so good at tricking himself into creating new context for his art, and it's really inspiring to be around.\n\nI could tell certain directions he was pulling things from. Like, some deep Stax Records vibes…\n\nOh, yes, yes, big time. He's been really into Stax and also Sun Records the last couple of years. He's just been diving into the production values on that stuff. He also loves all the Studio One stuff, too, like super into dub and the late '60s, early '70s era of Jamaican music. He's way, way into it.\n\n[Bassist and co-founder] Toby Leaman is so good, too. For those less familiar with the band: how would you describe their push and pull as writers?\n\nScott, I think, always gets sort of pegged as freewheeling — lots of colorful chords and production. It's more kaleidoscopic. And Toby's songs are sort of classic — very open-chorded, \"you can hear them in a big space\" kind of songs. And I think Toby has also gotten really good at designing songs for the road — for big sing-alongs.\n\nI think they're just so talented at what they do. I used to say that Scott's songs were kind of like a rocket taking off. They would start really small, and then by the end they're huge. And with Toby it's like a big emotion for the whole thing, if that makes sense.\n\nAnd maybe Toby's songs are a little bit more even-keeled in how they're put together, and how they're structured, but that emotion is really felt throughout the whole thing — whereas Scott's more of the story guy.\n\nTo The Ghosts captures everything fans adore about Cults and they'll have ample opportunity to catch them performing live this year. The duo are set to return to Lollapalooza opening for Vampire Weekend on Aug. 4, followed by their own headlining U.S. tour the same month.\n\nAhead of their intensive touring schedule, the duo joined GRAMMY.com on a group video chat from their respective homes in New York’s East Village one evening, to discuss their upcoming release.\n\nThis interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nYou began working on this album during the pandemic. Tell me where you wrote and recorded material, and whether you did that together or separately?\n\nMadeline Follin: We were writing and recording in Brian's spare room. Can you see him?\n\nBrian Oblivion: This tiny room! [directs the camera around a room not much bigger than 7 x 10 feet].\n\nFollin: I sat on that couch right there, and we spent a lot of time in that little room [laughs]. For the most part we were together for the entire thing.\n\n**Madeline, you revealed that before making your fourth album Host, you were too shy to show your own music to Brian and producer Shane Stoneback. What broke that barrier down for you to fully participate in the creative process?**\n\nIt was really hard to get it out of me. I had really strong imposter syndrome. Even though Brian was just starting out, he had taken a few recording classes in college, so he knew a lot more of the recording lingo and ways of communicating technically. I didn't know, so I felt so nervous to even communicate what I wanted. Shane helped with that a lot in terms of translating what I wanted into the language of studio speak. Shane is unlike any other producer we've worked with. He heard me out.\n\nTell me about working with Shane Stoneback in terms of what you came into the conversation with, and what he contributed to shaping this album.\n\nFollin: We thought that we were not going to work with Shane again because he'd largely gotten out of the business. During [the] pandemic he switched careers and began working in the movie business. So, we started working with a few other people, we were feeling it out, and it just wasn't working. We reached out to [Shane], and he randomly happened to have 30 days off and said if we can finish it in 30 days, we can do it. We said, \"we're coming out tomorrow.\"\n\nWhat were the creative decisions you made in the earliest stages, and how much did you change your mind or allow outside ideas in as you were working on this album?\n\nOblivion: It took us a really long time. We definitely wrote over 100 songs. I put it all on an iTunes playlist and it was over 6 hours of music. This time we got a lot of confidence from some of our older songs being popular with young people. We thought, maybe the time has come around where we can do exactly what we do, and that's kinda 'new' again. Once we went through all the permutations and landed on \"Crybaby,\" which was the first song on the record, we just thought \"this just feels like us, so let's lean into what makes us unique.\" The messing around period was just trying out new tricks and trying to expand our possibilities.\n\nJohn Congleton has a real knack for guitar sounds and finding a rawness to live instruments. How did he come to mix this album?\n\nOblivion: I've been a fan of John's going back to Xiu Xiu and my high school days. He's a master of distortion, him and Dave Fridmann, that's their thing. They can make things really fuzzy and interesting, but also fit it all in the speakers in a way that's like a weird magic trick. We have kind of a vintage sound, and he gets that but he's also smart at highlighting things that are new. He mixed our last record too and from the first conversation, in which he said he thinks like a musician and wants to do something strange, we knew we wanted him.\n\nFollin: We'd mixed with other people before but when we got a mix back from John, he was bringing out parts of the song that we hadn't even recalled leaving in there. He makes our songs sound new to us again. We have a lot of trust and respect in him, and we were trying for so long to get our schedules lined up.\n\nOblivion: We work on our music for so long that by the time it's ready for the mix, we really want to hear something new. It's refreshing for us that John hears something new in us.\n\nTell me about \"Crybaby,\" the first single. What were you going for in terms of the music, the mood and the message?\n\nFollin: We'd been working on that song as part of the 100 songs that didn't make it. Brian started working on that song and I had never heard anything like that come out of his computer before, and I was shocked. It's funny because people say it's so \"Cults sounding\", but I thought it was unlike anything we'd done before. It's got a '60s vibe, an island vibe, to me and I thought we needed to zone in on it.\n\nOblivion: That was at the point where we decided \"let's see if we can still make Cults songs that hark back to the earliest record.\" I love the lyrics, they're simple and there's no hidden meaning, which is great. A lot of the music that we love and that inspired the start of our band, is really obvious but also really weird in terms of lyrics. \"Crybaby\" is a fun, whacky diss track.\n\nLet's talk about what inspires you musically.\n\nOblivion: What gets me excited is spending a lot of time sharpening my Spotify algorithm, so every Monday I get a collection of weirdo emotional love songs about heartbreak, these obscure, catchy B-sides, and whenever I find a song like that, I'm so inspired. Something that has kitsch, gravitas, and a bit of humour, that John waters, David Lynch combination lights me up.\n\nFollin: Right now, I'm really into a lot of Fontaines D.C. I felt a 'Cults' vibe from them even though they probably have no idea who we are. It's been a while since I've put on a song, and then I want to put it on again right away.\n\n\"Left My Keys\" is an anthem for growing up. Tell me about your experience growing up in this band.\n\nOblivion: What makes this record different is that historically, we'd do all the music together over a span of two years, then Maddy would squirrel away to take a month or two to write all the lyrics, and that made the records very reflective of that moment, that time. For this record, because we had a protracted work schedule with nothing else to do, we took the time to slow down and look back. \"Left My Keys'' is about being a teenager, and \"Crybaby\" is about things that happened a long time ago. Growing up is being comfortable enough to address your own past and realizing everything turned out okay so far. It's the first album where we're looking backwards and processing stuff from the last 15 years and before.\n\nThis album feels brighter than 'Host.' What happened between 'Host' and 'To the Ghosts' that explains the transition?\n\nOblivion: There's a lot of stuff we got out of our system. Host and Offering were both dark records, to me. It's wild to see that young people have picked up on \"Gilded Lily\" and that was such a crazy, cathartic song for us, so now it is crazy and cathartic for them. Most of my favorite bands are dark, sad bands, but that's not the totality of who we are. Being able to explore both sides of who we are was refreshing for us.\n\nFollin: Personally, we were both feeling a lot better in our lives. We worked through a lot of anxiety, and because of the pandemic there was less partying, clubs, and bars. We had time to get healthier.\n\nOblivion: In a lot of ways our band is defined by our limitations. We have made music for 15 years, just the two of us with the same producer. But every time we make something new and interesting and all the things we think of as roadblocks help to provide a framework for what we do.\n\nYou released 'Host B-Sides & Remixes' in 2022, two years after 'Host.' Are there outtakes, or planned remixes, that are planned for this album too?\n\nFollin: Definitely. 100 percent, we will be having something, but I'm not saying.\n\nOblivion: It's been really fun with the last few albums to put out songs that showed what would have happened if we went in a different direction. Sharing that part of the process with listeners has been fun.\n\nYou have a huge schedule of touring. Tell me about the plans and how you mentally and physically endure all the travel and performances. Does it get easier the more you do it?\n\nFollin: No. Every single night, even if we're in the middle of nowhere, whether there's 15 people or 1000, I almost have a heart attack before walking on stage each night. You're crammed in a box with 7 people every night, there's a lot of emotions…\n\nOblivion: …and something is always breaking at soundcheck, it's like arghhhh! It's really hard, but when we put out Host and we didn't get to tour for two years, we missed that connection. The feeling of sharing your music with people allows us to move past it and get into something new. It's a big part of our personal growth and experience. We love touring.\n\nFollin: In normal daily life, we hang out together. We hang out on weekends. It's not a forced thing. It feels so good to meet fans every single night, too, and hearing stories of how you affected somebody's life.\n\nMost of the tracks on this album fall at around the three minute mark, and many end quite abruptly without fading out or dwindling down. Was that a deliberate strategy, and then why did \"Hung The Moon\" require that extended time as the finale?\n\nOblivion: It's verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus and you're done in three minutes!\n\nFollin: Brian is very concerned about time, and I don't think it matters. I like shorter, he likes longer. We're compromising.\n\nOblivion: \"Hung The Moon\" is the big epic ballad that ends the record. We have had one on every record, it always ends with a big power ballad. In a storytelling way, that's the only ending that makes sense to us, a melancholy resolution. I love that song because it starts off as a sweet love song then it gets tense and spooky towards the end, but the lyrics stay really loving. It's that transition between the rush of an initial relationship and then the long game, where it's sweet and delicate, but it's also real life, so you're afraid that you'll lose things and you're trying to hold on to that original thing. So, the album ends on a bittersweet note."
