Per Charles: \"that would really be flying blind, baby.\"\n\nNow, whether or not he ever flew is a different story, and you'll notice that Charles gets a bit cagey when asked in the second clip here (Slide 9), but according to the Smithsonian, Charles' first pilot Tom McGarrity (then one of the very few black Air Force veterans) would indeed let the singer take the controls on occasion back in the early 1960s just to let him get a feel for it while in flight. \n\nCharles' real interest, though, was in being able to land the plane, and he believed that with a skilled air traffic controller in his ear, he'd be able to crash safely enough that he'd be able to survive. \"I'm sure I'll probably break my leg or arm or something, but I don't think I would kill myself and that's the important thing.\"\n\nFor years, nothing happened, and Charles eventually felt comfortable leaving the cockpit, moving to the back where he would play chess with his entourage to pass the time. Then, in October of 1985, this same plane was coming in for a landing in Bloomington, Indiana, when it slid off the runway, crashing in a field hard enough to break it to pieces. Of 28 people on board, 26 were taken to the hospital to be treated for minor injuries, while Charles walked away unscathed, probably wondering if he could have done a better job putting it down.\n\n—\n\nPhotos were taken for LIFE in 1966 by the great Bill Ray.\n\nClips are from “The Dick Cavett Show” in 1972 & 1973.\".",
