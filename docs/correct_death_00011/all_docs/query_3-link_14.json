        "text": "Timmy84\n\nNow this is where things get interesting (read on):\n\nInterview with Erik Greene I\n\nNot long after singer Sam Cooke was killed in a cheap Los Angeles motel, his father, the Rev. Charles (Papa) Cook, called a family meeting to suggest that the singer's loved ones would have to learn to let go of anxiety about the circumstances of his demise.\n\n\"People are going to believe what they're going to believe,\" the Chicago minister said.\n\nThat attitude prevailed in Cooke's vast family for more than 40 years, even as one biographer after another portrayed the soul singer as a wanton womanizer whose final hot-sheets romp on Dec. 11, 1964, at the Hacienda Motel led directly to his death.\n\nThis changed in 2006 with the publication of Our Uncle Sam, a biography of Cooke written by his great-nephew, Erik Greene. Greene says publication of Our Uncle Sam was \"necessary\" to add his family's perspective to the singer's life story. (The book is available at www.ourunclesam.com.) Greene, a financial advisor in the Chicago area, was born about a year after Cooke's death to Gwendolyn Greene, the daughter of Sam Cooke's oldest sister, Mary. Our Uncle Sam paints a portrait of Cooke that is often at odds with that of other biographers. Perhaps most importantly, the book questions the official account of Cooke's death.\n\n\"There was a lot going on in the last few months of Sam's life,\" Greene says. \"He had discovered irregularities in the way his businesses were set up and was planning to fire his accountant-turned-manager and his long-time business partner. He had made up his mind to divorce his wife. Not to mention, it wasn't uncommon at the time to see start-up record labels with large insurance policies on their artists—policies which could be 'cashed in' in times of economic need.\"\n\nGreene was interviewed by the Crime Library's David J. Krajicek.\n\nCrime Library: What motivated you to write this book?\n\nErik Greene: So much has been written about Sam from outsiders—some things accurate, others wildly inaccurate—but over the past 40-plus years, my family's voice for the most part hasn't been heard. Sam Cooke's life was truly one of perseverance, determination, foresight and tragedy. In my estimation, he was such an important figure in American music history; his saga deserves to be told in the correct light.\n\nCL: Can you describe your family's relationship with Sam as he found fame?\n\nGreene: My grandmother was Sam's oldest sister, so quite naturally my mom was the oldest niece. My mother's memories of Sam were a part of my growing up, and I describe the deep effect her memories had on me in Our Uncle Sam. Even at the height of Sam's stardom, he was never too big for friends and family.\n\nSam spent much of his pop career in Los Angeles, so the fondest memories occurred when he came home to Chicago. Even as young children, my cousins remember how special they felt in Sam's presence. His family would have front row seats when he played the Regal Theater on Chicago's South Side, and there's a famous picture of Sam on stage doing the \"Twist\" with his niece, Ophelia. After dinner at Sam's mother's house, the kids would gather around and he would make up competitive games for them to play and songs for them to sing. My mom remembered one of the songs he made up on the spot and sang only one time.\n\nSince Cowboys and Indians were a popular theme, Sam's nieces and nephews formed a circle as he told the story of two young braves wooing an Indian maiden. \"I took in every last word and remembered it,\" she said. \"He would just make it up right there on the spot. And that's what impressed us the most. We had an uncle that could do anything.\"\n\nInterview with Erik Greene II\n\nCL: What objections do Cooke's loved ones have to the way his demise has been portrayed in the media?\n\nGreene: The \"Twist\" picture of Sam dancing onstage with his niece is a perfect example of how slipshod the coverage of Sam's life has been. In a recent biography, my cousin Ophelia was misidentified as my mother even though there's an eight year age difference between them! Sam's younger brother L.C. was mistakenly identified as Sam in the early pages of the same book. How credible are the book's intimate details if the subject can't be identified correctly?\n\nAnother book had a picture of Sam getting dressed backstage in 1968—four years after his death! Though the corrections in the first book were eventually made, shoddy attention to the simplest details is why there needed to be clarification in Sam's story, a reference source which would bring things \"back to center.\"\n\nSince December of 1964, the sketchy facts surrounding Sam Cooke's death have been a topic of discussion by fans worldwide. Some see him as \"being in the wrong place at the wrong time,\" or \"a victim of his lifestyle catching up with him,\" or any one of a number of open-and-shut explanations. Some hint at a conspiracy to make an example out of an outspoken black entrepreneur. Others have insisted the hit was mob-related.\n\nCL: And what does the family believe?\n\nGreene: Since Sam's untimely death, the Cook family has commonly held the belief that the whole scenario was a set-up. They immediately dismissed the \"facts\" as presented because they knew certain things about his nature: Sam would never have to force himself on a woman—any woman. While he was known to have his trysts, he would routinely turn down dozens of propositions from women who threw themselves at him. The family knew the actions as described weren't in Sam's nature. Sam always did everything first class. As a successful entertainer and businessman, his clothes were tailor-made and he drove the finest cars (he was sporting a new, 1965 Ferrari the night of his murder). The thought of him checking into a $3-a-night motel would be laughable if the situation weren't so gravely serious.\n\nSam Cooke is remembered by my family and colleagues alike with love and admiration. When in public, his nieces and nephews remembered how their Uncle Sam would acknowledge fans, but still keep his family top priority. He found out a childhood friend was having trouble raising a family and going to school at the same time, so he stepped in paid his friend's tuition. Aretha Franklin described Sam Cooke as \"a fabulous humanitarian, a dynamite artist, and a prince of a man.\" Lou Adler, who co-wrote Sam's 1959 classic \"(What a) Wonderful World,\" called him \"the greatest guy I ever met.\" Etta James said \"he gave you the feeling he was very glad and blessed to be Sam Cooke.\"\n\nThe fact that Sam was portrayed as an over-sexed potential rapist deeply disturbed those that knew him best. Not only was this far from the truth, it was the kind of accusation that was almost impossible to disprove. On the other hand, a black entertainer taking advantage of a defenseless, star-struck Eurasian girl was much more plausible in the public's eyes, especially if it's been reported alcohol was involved. But just how innocent was the victim?\n\nThe question of Elisa Boyer's character and occupation was quickly suppressed by the coroner in the inquest, and the fact that she was indeed a prostitute didn't come out until she was arrested in a LAPD sting operation a month later. Had the question been allowed, it would've made inquiring minds ask, \"Why would a well-known entertainer with a pocket full of money attempt to rape a prostitute?\" These inconsistencies, as well as others, are discussed in detail in Our Uncle Sam.\n\nInterview with Erik Greene III\n\nCL: What is your family's perspective on the events of the night that Sam Cooke was killed?\n\nGreene: Personal feelings from the family aside, Sam's shooting didn't make sense from several common-sense angles. First of all, why would Sam to drive that far out of his way (and Boyer's, for that matter) to go to the seedy Hacienda Motel, especially since he would've had to pass several quality motels in order to do so? In the coroner's inquest, Boyer claimed she was held against her will, yet Sam allegedly left her in the car alone as he checked into the motel. During questioning, she testified she asked Sam if she could go to the bathroom as he was ripping off her clothes, and he stopped assaulting her so she could take a bathroom break. When she was done, he left her alone again and used the bathroom himself—finally giving her the opportunity to escape!\n\nBertha Franklin (the motel attendant) testified that Sam broke down her door, searched her apartment, and then came back into the living room demanding to know where Boyer went. Franklin claimed Sam twisted her arm and pinned her down on the floor, demanding to know more information, yet she managed to escape the hold—an interesting scenario that was never questioned. During their tussle, she grabbed her gun from atop the television and shot Sam. Why hadn't Franklin remembered her gun when he was trying to break down the door? Why didn't she go for the gun while Sam was searching the apartment? In Our Uncle Sam, I point out how many things don't make sense and were never questioned in the \"official\" explanation of events that night.\n\nPersonally, I believe Sam was killed because he was worth more dead than alive to certain parties.\n\nCL: To whom?\n\nGreene: First of all, there were details in Sam's death that were strikingly similar to that of singer Bobby \"I Fought the Law\" Fuller. Both had at one time been artists signed to record labels owned by Bob Keane. Both died in absurd manners whose evidence was largely ignored. (Fuller's death was ruled a suicide even though his autopsy revealed gasoline was poured down his throat after he died). The last place both were seen alive was PJ's—the Los Angeles nightclub owned by reputed mobsters. It was rumored Keane had a $1 million insurance policy on Fuller at the time of his death, though I haven't found evidence of a similar policy on Sam. It is unclear if this incident had a direct correlation with Sam's homicide, but it's interesting enough to note just the same.\n\nWhat's of more significance is that within six months of his death, Sam's ex-Manager Allen Klein sat as president of Tracey Records Limited, the parent company of Sam's enterprises named after his daughter. J.W. Alexander, Sam's long-time business partner, assumed the role of Tracey's vice president. Sam's will was never found, so his wife, at one time facing the humiliation of divorce, now found herself executor of his estate. Sam's parents, brothers and sisters got nothing and still don't receive royalties from his estate or his music catalog to this day.\n\nAfter my first edition was released, I was contacted by persons who had knowledge pertaining to his business dealings, as well as someone who offered a chilling account of what happened that night. I go into more detail in the second edition.\n\nInterview with Erik Greene IV\n\nCL: So you believe Boyer and Franklin were acting on behalf of someone else? That would seem a strange way to commit a planned murder.\n\nGreene: You're right. As reported, it would've been a strange way to plan a murder, but apparently things went awry from the original script. First of all, Boyer was a prop. She was used to get Sam from Martoni's restaurant to PJ's night club. Bertha Franklin's inclusion was accidental; the murder scene was supposed to be the motel room. My source insists Sam was brought to a room in the Hacienda for an arranged \"meeting.\" The meeting in the motel room was meant to encourage Sam to take his career in another direction, but after Sam refused he was subdued with a blunt object, shot, and left for dead. My source says what happened next was never part of the plan: Sam stumbled out of the room and made his way to the motel manager's office. Behind the office window was a one-bedroom apartment in which Franklin lived. The killer, realizing the job wasn't done, dragged Sam inside and shot him again—the second time in Franklin's apartment. This alternate scenario makes sense, since evidence showed the gun had been fired three times, yet only the fatal bullet and a ricochet were found inside Franklin's apartment. The first shot occurred in the motel room itself. The way it was explained to me, Franklin and Boyer were both compensated for their involvement, but neither one pulled the trigger. Tables were overturned and the room disheveled to give the impression of a struggle. \"The whole thing was like a movie,\" is how my source describes the staged cover-up.\n\nCL: Do you feel the popular portrayal of Sam Cooke's death denigrates his musical and personal legacy?\n\nGreene: I definitely feel the negative details surrounding Sam's death helped suppress his legacy. Also because the family does not control the Sam Cooke music catalog (how this came to pass and why are also discussed in my book), his music isn't as widely distributed as it should be. And while many entertainers before and after Sam had active sex lives, Sam's exploits have been overdramatized because of how he reportedly died.\n\nAs far as his legacy is concerned, it was once said, \"Sunlight is the best disinfectant,\" and I believe the time has come for my uncle to enjoy his day in the sun. Despite the actions of others, the timeless classics and warm memories Sam Cooke left behind have created a global following that ensures his time on earth is never forgotten.\n\nCL: The lingering questions about Sam Cooke's death must be a load to bear for his loved ones.\n\nGreene: The Cook family always believed that Sam did not die as reported. However, it was hard to convince persons outside the family how many inconsistencies with Sam's nature the \"official\" version contained. At one point, Sam's father called a family forum to say \"Let it go. People are going to believe what they're going to believe, so it's futile to try to convince them otherwise.\" Now, 43 years after his death, I tried to gain greater insight to the mystery of Sam's death in Our Uncle Sam. I've analyzed available medical reports and legal documents, and I've sifted through the inconsistencies to try to piece together what happened in Sam's final hours. The length of time that's passed since his death may seem extreme to some, but I truly believe that all things come together in time. Now is that time.\n\nCL: What goes through your mind when you hear 'Cupid' or 'Wonderful World' on the radio?\n\nGreene: I feel an enormous sense of pride because my uncle was an amazing talent. He wrote most of his major hits—You Send Me, Chain Gang, Only Sixteen, Cupid, Twistin' the Night Away, Having a Party, Another Saturday Night, A Change is Gonna Come—I could go on and on. He was the first African-American artist to own a record label, and he would write, arrange, and produce songs for the artists on his label. At a time when someone had to take a stand, he became the first artist to refuse to sing to segregated audiences.\n\nSam Cooke recognized the business end of the record industry and negotiated ownership of his publishing rights when he signed his contract with RCA. Very few entertainers, black or white, could have successfully made such a demand. Ray Charles had sold millions of records on the Atlantic label but was refused his publishing rights when he confronted the label's owners. Sam recognized how important it was to take control of one's career, and he wouldn't hesitate to share such sacred knowledge to anyone who was willing to listen.\n\nBesides being a tremendous talent, he was a tremendous human being. He never forgot where he came from and blended in with the common man despite his superstar status. His generosity came from his father, Reverend Charles Cook Sr. During Sam's formative years, Papa Cook would often house and feed hungry children in the neighborhood, citing the fact that his children may be in need one day when he wasn't around. Sam never forgot the lessons learned as a child and carried them forward in his short but memorable lifetime.\n\nIt warms me to hear a Sam Cooke song at an unexpected time because it brings back all the loving memories of my early childhood. My mom would play his records and tell me stories about how special Sam made her and the rest of the family feel. This is the side of Sam Cooke I remember growing up, and the Sam Cooke I chose to share with the world in Our Uncle Sam."
