        "text": "The GRAMMY Museum kicked off 2024 GRAMMY Week with a feelgoodribbon-cutting celebration at its newly renamed Ray Charles Terrace on Jan. 29.\n\nThe uncharacteristically temperate evening added to the welcoming vibe of the gathering, which was further enhanced by on-point selections from GRAMMY winnerDJ Khalil. Attendees were all smiles, reconnecting with each other in this congenial setting, generating a positive party tone for the slew of events GRAMMY Week brings.\n\nFormer Recording Academy Chairman Jimmy Jam proved to be a gracious and natural host. In his signature shades and slick suit, the multiple GRAMMY-winning producer brought attention to the Ray Charles Foundation’s and the GRAMMY Museum Foundation’s joint focus on empowering young people through education. A generous $2 million donation from the Ray Charles Foundation will further enable the Museum's educational focus.\n\nGRAMMY Museum’s President and CEO Michael Sticka took to the podium and quantified Jam’s introduction with some solid statistics. These included 500,000 students served over the course of the museum’s 15 years and $500,000 donated to school music programs in the last 11 years.\n\n\"We’re committed to ensuring that every student who walks through our doors, or participates in one of our nationwide programs has an opportunity to discover music, and perhaps a career in music, in a new way,\" Sticka said.\n\nThe Ray Charles Foundation President Valerie Ervin — arriving fresh from a proclamation from the City of Los Angeles for the foundation — added, \"It’s our great honor to invest in a shared vision of fostering the next generation of musical talent.\"\n\n(L-R) Rita George, John Burk, Yakub Hazzard, Clarence Daniels, Wes Coleman, Michael Sticka, Valerie Erviin, Jimmy Jam, Tammy Hurt, Harvey Mason Jr, and Tim Bucher ┃Timothy Norris/Getty Images for The Recording Academy\n\n\"A museum is a 'look and don’t touch' type of thing. That isn’t what this place is,\" Jam told GRAMMY.com. \"I remember the day we did the ribbon cutting on the actual museum, I was chairman of the Recording Academy at that time. The first thing we did was let 300 kids in. The docents who talked to the kids were Jermaine Dupri and Ludacris.\n\n\"To me, it’s really about the other 364 days of the year besides the one day of the show. That’s what this museum is all about,\" Jimmy Jam continued.\n\nUp-and-coming Darkchild artist Jac Ross performed Charles’ \"You Don’t Know Me.\" A gifted vocalist with innate stage presence, he prefaced the song — and instantly won over the crowd by asking, \"Please give me another round of applause to make me feel good.\" Ross’ heart wrenching rendition ended with a well-deserved standing ovation and hoots and hollers from the crowd.\n\n\"It’s more of [Charles’] country side,\" Ross told GRAMMY.com of his song choice. \"I wanted to show and display that because I’m a country and soul artist and it’s a perfect leeway to that side of Ray Charles.\"\n\nGRAMMY nominee Aloe Blacc described Ross as \"a generational voice,\" then put a distinctly sassy and languorous spin on Charles’ hit, \"Georgia.\" He had the crowd accompanying him with claps and snaps during \"I Got a Woman.\"\n\nSpeaking of Charles’ influence on him, Blacc told GRAMMY.com, \"As a businessman, I loved how Ray Charles worked. When I talked to Quincy Jones, he said he and Ray Charles only had a handshake. They never wrote a contract. That, to me, is inspiring about how to do business with your friends and make art and navigate such a difficult industry. As a songwriter, energy and melody, that’s what Ray Charles gave to me.\"\n\nGRAMMY Museum Announces 2024 GRAMMY Week Programming Schedule\n\nOn July 20, K-pop boy group ATEEZ stepped foot onto one of their largest stages yet for their first U.S. stadium show. The scene at Los Angeles’ open-air BMO Stadium was a far cry from the group's L.A. performance in 2019 — their first tour stop ever — at the petite Globe Theater, a former movie palace with a tenth of BMO’s capacity.\n\nEven then, as a five-month-old rookie group, fans (called ATINYs) saw a remarkable promise in Hongjoong, Seonghwa, Yunho, Yeosang, San, Mingi, Wooyoung, and Jongho. In the years since, ATEEZ has developed a growing presence in the States, even being the subject of a first-of-its-kind GRAMMY Museum pop-up. If the BMO Stadium performance was any indication, ATEEZ have officially hit their stride.\n\nRead more: Inside The GRAMMY Museum's ATEEZ & Xikers Pop-Up: 5 Things We Learned\n\nThe nearly sold-out July 20 show felt like a level up, and not just because of the size of the venue. \"As we performed, I really felt like ATEEZ has grown so much,\" singer Yunho said near the end of the night. He’s not wrong: they’re undoubtedly more confident than ever. Perhaps that’s because the octet made history earlier this year as the first K-pop boy group to perform at Coachella. Regardless, ATEEZ's growth in both production and showmanship was palpable.\n\nIf you missed ATEEZ’s two nights in L.A., don’t worry: K-pop’s resident pirate kings (more on that title later) have more up their billowy sleeves. In the spirit of their never-ending grind, the Towards the Light: Will to Power tour has nine more North American stops, including New York’s Citi Field. Read on to find out why you won’t want to miss these fast-rising K-pop idols.\n\nThe Members Are As Good Apart As Together\n\nATEEZ’s motto is \"eight makes one team\" for good reason. Individually, their talents and tastes are prismatic, yet complement each other perfectly — a fact that comes into startling clarity midway through the show, when the group breaks off into units and solos.\n\nEqual parts erotic and controlled, trap banger \"IT’S You\" gives Yeosang, San, and Wooyoung room to deploy their enigmatic charms as a trio; ATEEZ’s purveyor of belted high notes, Jongho, dips into his deeper register on solo ballad \"Everything\"; diametric duo Hongjoong and Seonghwa spit fire about the rapport that arises from their differences on red-hot cypher \"MATZ\": \"M-A-T-Z like allergy, we don’t really fit together / Yeah, yeah, but on stage, reacting to that synergy.\"\n\nThen there’s the wistful \"Youth\" from dance class pals Yunho and Mingi. The two go way back — something they reminded audiences of by acting out a fictionalized version of a real phone call they shared the day before auditioning for KQ Entertainment. \"Imagine us taking the stage together someday,\" Yunho said. \"Sounds amazing, right?\"\n\nRead more: ATEEZ Are Here To Win The Hearts Of K-Pop Fans\n\nATEEZ Know How To Turn Up The Drama\n\nATEEZ's lore runs deep. In their conceptual universe, what began as a swashbuckling tale of pirates in search of treasure evolved into an anarchic manifesto about toppling the world order. Recently, in a Wild West turn, they’ve been masquerading as cowboys dedicated to the daily hustle.\n\nEvery ATEEZ performance has a story; on this tour, the theme is light. But, as always in ATEEZ’s oeuvre, that light can’t exist without a darkness seeking to quash it. The way they convey this narrative — acting, stage decoration, extras — is a masterclass in drama, fit for the theater as much as a stadium.\n\nWatch: Global Spin: Watch Ateez Represent South Korea With Kinetic Performance Of \"The Real\"\n\nThey’re In Their Element Onstage\n\nThe success of ATEEZ’s storytelling is bolstered by the group’s unearthly stage presence. In that regard, Seonghwa led the pack, moving like a man possessed. Whether crawling on his knees, rolling his eyes back, or slinging a sword to symphonic backing, the lithe dancer never let the air-tight facade slip — except, of course, when it came time to offer a couple of warm words to fans.\n\nLike Seonghwa, the rest are also shockingly versatile. San effortlessly switches between agile body rolls and thigh caresses in the dangerously sensual \"Cyberpunk,\" then vigorously glides his arms through air at the climax of \"Say My Name,\" a gesture that has only grown in power and potency over time.\n\nATINYs Do Their Best To Match ATEEZ’s Energy\n\n\"There [are] more than 20,000 singers in here,\" Hongjoong said as the lead-in to the soaring \"Dance Like Butterfly Wings.\" \"Can you show me your singing?\"\n\nSing they did: All night, the crowd brought an energy as fierce and passionate as ATEEZ, especially when barking at charismatic rapper Mingi, much to his apparent enjoyment.\n\nBut the single noisiest moment came during \"Guerilla.\" At a certain point, Yunho shouted a ferocious \"Make some noise!\" as a cue and ATINYs know it’s time to warm up their vocal chords; while Jongho belts some of his highest notes yet, fans roared \"Break the wall!\" at the top of their lungs, loud enough to rise above the stadium enclosure.\n\nFan chants and cheers are a mainstay of K-pop shows in South Korea, but due to differences in concert etiquette and language barriers, most don’t make their way overseas. ATEEZ and their fans broke that wall, and built a bridge in its place.\n\nMúsica Mexicana isn't the only sound of Mexico that's blowing up; the country's artists are now starting to make their mark in reggaeton. Imbued with the essence, swagger, and lingo of Mexico, reggaeton Mexa is the next big Latin sound that's going global.\n\nOriginating in the Caribbean, reggaeton evolved from Panama’s reggae en español and Jamaican dancehall of the 1980s. Puerto Rican acts like DJ Playero and DJ Nelson shaped the sound of reggaeton in the island's underground scene during the '90s, while Daddy Yankee, Tego Calderón, Don Omar, and Ivy Queen pushed the genre into the mainstream at the dawn of the new millennium.\n\nBoricua acts Tainy, Bad Bunny, and Ozuna pushed reggaeton into the next decade, though Colombia also brought about the genre's second wind. J Balvin's success solidified Medellín as a reggaeton hotbed, spawning Maluma, Karol G, and Feid as global stars.\n\nLearn more: The Sonic And Cultural Evolution Of Reggaeton In 10 Songs\n\nIn the 2020s, Mexico is becoming the next hub for reggaeton as artists who grew up listening to the Puerto Rican OGs — as well as Mexican acts Ghetto Kids and Pablito Mix — are now putting their own stamp on the genre. In late 2022, Bellakath put a spotlight on reggaeton Mexa with her viral hit \"Gatita\"; the following year, Yng Lvcas took the sound to new heights with his \"La Bebé\" remix featuring Peso Pluma, which reached No. 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\nReggaeton Mexa pulls from the genre's underground roots in Puerto Rico, infusing its songs with Mexican culture and grit. Lyrics are full of Mexican slang that reflect life in the barrios.\n\n\"Reggaeton Mexa is reminiscent of the sounds of the '90s and 2000s from Puerto Rican DJs like Playero and Joe,\" El Mallila, one of the reggaeton Mexa leaders, tells GRAMMY.com. \"The songs, the beats, and rhythms are more or less similar to that flow. The difference here is the Mexican jargon. Reggaeton Mexa is spicy. We play with Mexican profanities without being offensive.\"\n\nThe emerging genre has gained traction among the larger reggaeton community with Jowell y Randy, Maldy, and J Balvin recently featuring on their songs. Following the success of Yng Lvcas, Bellakath, and El Malilla, Mexican acts like Peso Pluma (who dedicated part of his Éxodo album to reggaeton) and pop star Kenia Os are embracing the wave. As the tide continues to rise for reggaeton Mexa, GRAMMY.com is highlighting seven of the sound's leading artists.\n\nLet’s not bury the lede here: Café Tacvba’s Re is one of the pantheon rock albums in the Spanish language. And arguably one of the greatest rock albums in any language.\n\nSince its release 30 years ago on July 22, it’s been held up as one of the most ambitious and eclectic albums of its time, elevating the standard by which almost every rock en español band would be held to ever since — including its own creators. As a song cycle, Re is a whirlwind, with genre exercises and mini-suites scattered seemingly at random. Many pop critics liken its sonic diversity to the Beatles’ White Album, which is true if you’re just counting musical styles. But whereas the Fab Four were indulging their personalities within the group context, Café Tacvba conveyed solidarity in putting together an almost sui generis collection of madcap melodies.\n\nAs a whole, Re was a great leap forward for Latin American rock music, and a landmark for Mexican music in general.\n\nIt's important to consider the context of Café Tacvba in 1994. Despite its large population and long history as a Latin American cultural center, Mexico City lagged in establishing serious rock acts aside from outliers such as El Tri. Part of this is due to the politics of the age — including the Mexican government’s notorious crackdown on public rock concerts after several clashes between rock fans and police during the '70s — leaving the majority of Mexican rock bands resigned to playing in shady, underground clubs.\n\nHowever, the 1980s saw the birth of BMG’s \"Rock de tu Idioma\" marketing blitz, and Mexican record companies finally began to put efforts into finding a national equivalent to South American-born stadium bands like Soda Stereo and Los Enanitos Verdes. On their second album, El Circo, Madilta Vecindad brought Mexico City to the forefront of the modern rock en español movement with their innovative mix of rock n’roll and ska crossed with pachuco subculture. Other bands that emerged around this time — from the gothic Caifanes (whom the band is currently touring with across the United States) to the arena rockers Maná — began building large audiences across the continent, but the scene still lacked a singular act that could elevate Mexican rock to the forefront.\n\nRead more: Revisiting 'El Nervio Del Volcán' At 30: How Caifanes' Final Album Became A Classic In Latin American Rock\n\nEnter los Tacvbos. Aligning based on their shared passion for English new wave music, Café Tacvba was formed in the late '80s by college friends Rubén Albarrán and Joselo Rangel, who would serve as vocalist and guitarist, respectively. In time, they were joined by Joselo’s brother (and bassist) Quique and the multi-instrumentalist Emmanuel \"Meme\" de Real, choosing to name their band after a historic Mexico City café. Café Tacvba spent the late '80s evolving from a college garage band into one of Mexico’s most exciting live acts. After the release of their seminal 1992 self-titled debut — a frantic collection of ska-punk mayhem and colorful pop songs — expectations were high that the band could deliver a follow-up that would mirror their electric live show. What the band delivered would end up altering the entire scene completely.\n\nRe is impactful and unique for many reasons, the first and most immediate being its adventurous studio production. Working again with rock en español superproducer Gustavo Santaolalla, Café Tacvba decided against continuing with the ska-punk foundations of El Circo and their own debut and embraced their own eclecticism. You can hear it from the jump with the huapango-via-jarana opening chords of \"El Aparato,\" a sound previously unheard of on a pop record. Within its three-and-a-half minute runtime are layers of percussion and synthesizers complemented by glorious indigenous chants and one of Albarrán’s greatest vocals, rising and falling as the song demands. The movement in the final 45 seconds is ethereal, with its sheer sonic force sounding more apropos for the end of the world than the beginning of a double album.\n\nSantaolalla revealed to Rolling Stone that he challenged the band, who responded with two batches of new songs for a sprawling double disc. Re is where a song like the sophisti-funk of \"El Ciclón\" is followed by two minutes of unadulterated thrash in \"El Borrego.\" \"24 Horas,\" meanwhile, mixes Beach Boys harmonies, Latin American lounge music, and post-punk beats. And that’s not even getting to the pure WTF of \"El Puñal y El Corazón,\" with its multiple sections finding the middle ground between Pedro Infante and the Beatles, albeit with a merengue coda thrown in.\n\nPerhaps the best testament to Santaolalla's production is \"El Baile y El Salon,\" Re’s most popular song (and frequent concert encore for the band). It’s one of a string of great duets from Albarrán and Meme, perhaps the most earnest song in the band’s catalog with sweetly sincere lyrics. Santaolalla lets the music aid the storytelling: Meme’s vocals ride against stomping percussion and a grooving bass line, while Albarrán sings against a wave of synthesizers. In lesser hands, the song would be an easy paint-by-numbers arena rock anthem. Thankfully, Café Tacvba leaned into their own indulgences, and came out with something immortal.\n\nRe did not sell well in Mexico upon release, though the band fermented interest during a sold out tour of Chile and Argentina. This, along with exposure from the recent launch of MTV in Mexico, was the major catalyst for the album’s fortunes taking an upturn. As the Mexican music listening public soon gathered, Re had something for everyone: From the smooth bolero of \"Esa Noche,\" the frenetic banda of \"El Fin de la Infancia,\" and the glittery Mexican pop of \"Las Flores.\" Lyrically the band was speaking to its compadres, most notably on \"El Metro,\" a bizarre short story of a lovelorn man trapped inside the Mexico City subway.\n\nDespite its madcap sound and unabashed orgullo Mexicano, Re’s deepest theme is about the cyclical nature of life. There’s an obvious hint to it within the album art’s spiral conch shell, and more allusions in the song title \"El Ciclón\" and the reflexivity of \"Pez\" and \"Verde,\" which bleed in-and-out of each other.\n\nBut dig deeper and the album is rife with references to life, death, rebirth, and natural law. \"Ixtepec\" sounds like a buoyant pop number but is really a cryptic tale about Death coming to collect his bounty, underlined with the refrain that \"life is a cycle.\" Multiple songs, including \"Trópico de Cáncer\" and closer \"El Balcón,\" reference reclamation of their birth land from the conquistadors, with the former song in particular telling a heartbreaking story of a civil engineer encountering the ecological damage to which he’s complicit. And there’s also the understated elegance of \"El Tlatoani del Barrio,\" which recounts a love story in a pre-Columbian world soundtracked by Indigenous chants and a disco boogie.\n\nUnlike many bands in a similar position, Café Tacvba never tried to replicate the magic of Re. Their next release was the covers album Alalancha de Éxitos, itself born out of their label’s reaction about Re’s lack of commercial hits (this bet paid off; the album was nominated for Best Latin Rock/Alternative Performance at the 40th GRAMMY Awards). Their visionary, hyper-experimental 1999 release Revés/Yo Soy, solidified their critical standing by winning a Latin GRAMMY for Best Rock Album and earning a GRAMMY nod. Today, it's a cult item currently unavailable on any streaming service due to label in-fighting.\n\nAfter the turn of the century came Cuatro Caminos, a much more traditional sounding rock album, which led them to new critical and commercial heights, including their only GRAMMY win for Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album, and their career ever since has seen them find their groove as the thinking person’s favorite Mexican rock band. But within their exceptional catalog, Re remains a glorious outlier.\n\nEven if Café Tacvba had never released another record after Re, their legacy would have remained secure. Re was among the major catalysts for the second wave of Mexican alterna-rock, which saw the likes of Julieta Venegas and Kinky elevating the genre with new sounds and perspectives. All modern rock owes a debt to the freewheeling spirit of Re, and the album’s continued influence and criticalaccolades are proof-positive of that.\n\nIn a sense, it’s almost poetic that Café Tacvba — a band formed through their shared idolization of David Bowie, the Clash, and the Cure — ended up proving to be as essential and venerable to rock history as any of their influences.\n\nGRAMMY Camp is almost a wrap — but the musical memories will last a lifetime. On Saturday, July 19, the weeklong summit for students interested in music careers will wrap after six enlightening days.\n\nHeld at the Village Recording Studios in Los Angeles, GRAMMY Camp's faculty of music professionals — along with guest professionals — have offered precious insight to give campers the best chance at succeeding in their career of choice.\n\nThe available Camp tracks include Audio Engineering, Electronic Music Production, Songwriting, Music & Media, Music Business, and much more. Many alumni of this enriching crash course have risen to prestigious positions across the musical landscape.\n\nAs the Recording Academy signs off on yet another elevating GRAMMY Camp, check out this list of five major artists who cut their teeth at the almost 20-year institution.\n\nMaren Morris\n\nThe future country wunderkind attended GRAMMY Camp for its very first iteration, back in 2005. There, the then 15-year-old met undisputed leaders in the music community, like Jimmy Jam and Paul Williams — which set the course for her incredible career to come.\n\nIn the years since, Morris has won a GRAMMY, received 17 GRAMMY nominations, and topped the Billboard country charts. She also joined the country supergroup the Highwomen with fellow juggernauts Brandi Carlile, Natalie Hemby and Amanda Shires.\n\nAt this year's GRAMMY Camp, Morris returned as a guest artist. What's her advice to budding artists? \"Just stick to being authentic,\" she told RecordingAcademy.com, \"and people see that, no matter what time they arrive to the party for you.\"\n\nAlong the way, \"Find people that listen to you,\" Morris added, \"but also push you and your creativity to new areas of yourself.\"\n\nRead more: Maren Morris On 20 Years Of GRAMMY Camp & Her Advice To The Next Generation Of Music Industry Professionals\n\nJahaan Sweet\n\nIn 2009 — four years after Morris' GRAMMY camp tutelage — the formidable Jacksonville, Florida, producer, songwriter and pianist Jahaan Sweet attended GRAMMY Camp.\n\nAt the outset, he was thrilled to come to L.A. for the first time and network with like-minded folks in music. \"I knew that my skill set wasn't that great,\" he told GRAMMY.com a decade later, \"but it was just so good to be around people who were all there to learn and create together.\n\n\"I feel like that's the biggest takeback I have of GRAMMY Camp,\" he continued. \"It was amazing to have all those people together under one roof, all in the same vicinity, all doing creative things.\" Working with GRAMMY Camp Faculty Director Jason Goldman was one clear highlight for him: \"He's a great guy, and he was such a good, carefree band director.\"\n\nBy now, Sweet has worked with Kehlani, Kendrick Lamar, Drake, Eminem, the Carters, Ty Dolla $ign, A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie, and many more; he's been nominated for three GRAMMYs and won one. And as a launchpad, GRAMMY Camp helped make all these accomplishments possible.\n\nWatch now: Producer Jahaan Sweet Talks Making Records With Boi-1da, Drake & More | Behind The Board\n\nChappell Roan\n\nIn 2024, Chappell Roan is very, very famous — as she admits, a little more famous than she would like right now.\n\nRegardless, the self-christened \"Midwest Princess\" — whose moniker was ensconced in the title of her 2024 breakout album — has wholly earned her plaudits, including opening for Olivia Rodrigo on her GUTS tour. And she can trace a line directly back to a decade ago, in 2014, when she attended GRAMMY Camp.\n\n\"I didn't do my senior year. I didn't go to prom. I didn't go to graduation,\" Roan explained to Rolling Stone in 2022, about her early musical life. \"I missed a lot of what would have been the end of my childhood to do this job,\" she says.\n\nFor those like Roan, who are dead serious about making the music thing work, GRAMMY Camp is an ideal fount of experience and inspiration.\n\nRead more: Chappell Roan's Big Year: The Midwest Princess Examines How She Became A Pop \"Feminomenon\"\n\nJensen McCrae\n\nAnother shout out to GRAMMY Camp's Class of 2014: that's the year that indie-folk-pop favorite Jensen McCrae put in her time, at the tender age of 16.\n\n\"I started playing and writing music as a little kid, and I've known I've wanted to be creative for my whole life,\" McCrae told VoyageLA, adding that she began taking songwriting and performing seriously in high school.\n\n\"[Being a] half-white, half-Black girl who spent her whole life in academically cutthroat private schools while trying to pursue a career in the arts gives me a unique perspective on the world,\" she explained. Which made McCrae an live antenna at GRAMMY Camp, picking up signals left and right.\n\nThe 10-day experience cemented the Angeleno's desire to attend college at the University of Southern California's Thornton School of Music — where she got a full ride, and was off to the races. These days, she's fresh off an opening slot for Noah Kahan on the We're All Be Here Forever Tour.\n\nBlu DeTiger\n\n\"I remember thinking 'So many girls play guitar and sing,'\" the TikTok-flourishing bass phenom Blu DeTiger told Spin in 2022. \"I was like, 'I want to be different. I want to do something unique.' And I've never looked back.\"\n\nPart of GRAMMY Camp's message is: dare to be different, to be you. Which made DeTiger an ideal student, when she enrolled in 2015; today, she's leading the charge for a generation of young, innovative bassists of all backgrounds.\n\nRead more: Love Thundercat? Check Out These 5 Contemporary Bassists Keeping The Flame\n\nAlong with Morris and New Jerseyan singer/songwriter Jeremy Zucker, DeTiger returned in 2024 as a guest artist — bringing the musical education process full circle, as she continues to redefine how the bass is presented in the social media era of music.\n\nThe 20th annual GRAMMY Camp celebration is running now and concludes with the GRAMMY Camp Finale Student Showcase on Saturday, July 20, at the Ray Charles Terrace at the GRAMMY Museum.\n\nLearn more about GRAMMY Camp here — and we'll see you next year in Los Angeles!"
