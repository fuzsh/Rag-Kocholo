        "text": "I hadn't seen Dierks Bentley in concert longer than I care to admit.\n\nI last saw a Dierks Bentley show at the Ralph in Grand Forks twenty-plus years ago when he opened for Sugarland. He was just starting out. I've always been a big fan. His music really resonates with so many of his fans including myself.\n\nThis was the show I was looking forward to the most at this year's ND Country Fest and I must not have been the only one.\n\nIt's estimated that over 20,000 people were in New Salem, North Dakota to witness Dierks Bentley's return to North Dakota in blistering heat. Temps were sitting around 90 degrees and muggy conditions for most of the day.\n\nThat brought some severe weather to the area that set the shows back about an hour. Diamond Rio was forced to cut their set short before Dierks Bentley because of the thunderstorms.\n\nBy the time Dierks Bentley took the stage, it was pushing 11:30 pm.\n\nIt didn't matter to the jam-packed crowd at ND Country Fest as Dierks Bentley played hit after hit.\n\nI was lucky enough to work my way to the front of the stage and captured some pretty sweet images and video of the show. Dierks even threw me a beer in the middle of the concert. It's a good thing I still have my shortstop hands.\n\nIf you were at the show, you know how awesome it was. If you missed it, you truly did miss a special concert. Here are a few shots I snapped for y'all!\n\nDierks Bentley Concert-ND Country Fest 7-12-24"
