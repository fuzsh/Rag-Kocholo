        "text": "(Gray News) - Police in California say the body of a missing 3-year-old girl was found at a recycling facility shortly after her father was found dead in another city. Her death is now being investigated as a homicide.\n\nFremont Police say 3-year-old Ellie Lorenzo was reported missing Friday afternoon by her mother, Chrystal Obi. The girl had been in the custody of her father, Jared Lorenzo, who was found dead in San Francisco, according to KPIX.\n\nPolice began searching for Ellie, but she was nowhere to be found. She was last seen around 6 p.m. Thursday at the Casa Arroyo Apartments in Fremont, where Lorenzo reportedly lived.\n\nThe search ended in tragedy about 4:30 a.m. Saturday when police learned a child’s body was discovered at a recycling facility in San Jose, SFGate.com reports. Police later confirmed the deceased was Ellie.\n\n“Our department is saddened to learn Ellie has not survived. Our hearts are heavy for Ellie’s family, and we will continue to support them during this difficult time,” said Police Chief Sean Washington in a statement.\n\nObi also confirmed her daughter’s death in a statement released by KGO that called the 3-year-old “the most charming, funny, smart, friendly little girl.”\n\n“We are heartbroken at the loss of our dear sweet Ellie,” read the statement in part. “She will be remembered for her smart and curious mind, her big smile, and her warm loving heart. Ellie’s life was full of so many people who loved her so much and will miss her beyond words can explain.”\n\nEllie’s death is being investigated as a homicide by the San Jose Police Department. It’s unclear at this time how her father’s death may be connected.\n\nA GoFundMe has been set up to help Ellie’s family with funeral and other expenses. It had raised more than $80,000, as of early Monday."
