Records show my client was born in Jackson county, KC in May, 1947. She was given the name Hazel Millward. Her mother's name was Phyllis. We are not sure if Millwards is the mothe's name or the father as they were not married. She was born at the Willows Maternity Sanitarium which may have been associated with a Willows Hospital. The address for the adoption agency was Nursery of the Willows, 2929 Main Street, KC, MO.\n\nWe have gotten a partial social history with names blacked out. Phyllis was 27 at the time of the birth which would make her 78 if she is still alive. Phyllis was born and lived in town of 80,000 (at the time). I assume in Jackson county. The father was also 27 at the time. Phyllis was of Scotch and English nationality. She graduated from high school in January 1937 and attended 3 years of college and 6 mnths of secretarial school. She began work in 1940 as a stenographer. She was a member of the Congregational Church and stated she was very active in young people's groups and the chuch choir. She was active in choir and sports in high school also. In college she majored in Home Economics and was active in several Home Ec. clubs.\n\nShe told the social worker that her parents were to elderly to help care for the child and although the father had proposed marriage she was not completely interested in the man. The father was of German and French nationality and was a college graduate (1940). He had served in the Army and was discharged in 1946 as an officer. He was managing a theatre at the time, presumably in their home town (again this has been blacked out on the copy we obtained.)\n\nIf anyone can help out with the name Phyllis Millward or the last name Millwqrd or any other contacts for me, I'd appreciate the help.\n\nJim Quickstad\n\nAvantGuard Security\n\n303 First Street\n\nLos Altos, CA 94022\n\n8/21/1998\n\nJohn & Audrey McCall\n\nSeeking proof of marriage for Ora May Francis (Walters) who was married to Walt Taylor on March 21, 1902 in KC.

The last place I found this couple was in Kansas City, MO in 1915 when their children were enrolled in public school there. I have death dates of 4 April 1937 for Albert Stout and 31 May 1927 for his wife, Elizabeth Oswalt Stout. Is th3re a Missouri State Death Index and, if so, how do I access it? One of their grand-daughters thinks this couple (who died before she was born) died in California or Oregon or Washington, however, I have checked all three of those death index and haven't found them, so Missouri may be my next choice. Many thanks for any advice you can offer.\n\n10/5/1998\n\nTim Parrott\n\nI am searching for info concerning Isaish James Hevern b. 8 May 1860 in Iowa City, IA., who disappeared in Kansas City, MO in or around 1905. He was married to Effie Luella Wilson in 1892, and had four children, with a fifth one on the way, at the time of his disappearance. According to family tradition, Isiah J. Hevern was returning home from a bar in KC, hit his head while getting off the street car, walked right past his home, and was never seen again. I assume the local newspaper would have some information about the disappearance, but I don't know the precise date, and don't know if the newspapers of that era have been indexed. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.\n\n10/5/1998\n\nSandra McKinley\n\nSearching for my lost sisters. Charlotte, Patty and Becky Sandlin. Born mid to late 1940's in Oregon, Portland area, to Clayton Chocie and Dollie Sandlin. The family moved from Oregon to Joplin, MO, when the girls were small and ran a cafe at the airport. I have been told by an older brother that Dollie and Clayton divorced, she remarried and with her new family moved to Kansas, Topeka or Wichita area to work at an airport or an airplane factory. I am from Clayton's first marriage to Jessie Pearl Cook. I have not seen my sisters for 50 years and am searching all eastern Kansas and western Missouri. Has anyone heard of these sisters? I would like to meet them and to get to know them. Thanks.\n\n10/5/1998\n\nApril Robbins\n\nI am seeking info on the family of Jim Reeder b. ca. 1860/where? who m.

The Thiele family were German immigrants who settled in KC about 1870. Bertha married James Harvey and had four children, James Harvey died abt. 1905 and Bertha remarried.

This lady was married to my father beforee he met my mother, they were married before 1960 somewhere in Jackson county (we think) they were married and then divorced, and then re-married, she passed away in KC, MO., at the Old Lakeside Hospital in April 23, 1963. She was born on December 26, 1919, her name was Alice Kay (maiden name unknown). It seems that everyone in my family has or had heard her maiden name but none seem to remember it. She was married to my father, Glen Eldon Couch b. 5/23/1925, d. 4/6/1995. If you have access to this information and can find it I would be forever in your debt. Thanks.\n\nBack"
