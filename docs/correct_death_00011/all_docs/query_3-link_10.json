good talent.\n\nAnd he had recorded the talent, and he was gonna put out his own record label.\n\nHe had Derby Records and SAR Records.\n\nHe also had Kags Music publishing.\n\nAnd so the Kags Music publishing, same thing.\n\nHe was ready.\n\nHe was really gonna take on the world, and he would have been a lot bigger than Motown Records because he had really a leg up on Motown.\n\nIf you're somebody in the music business at the time, you would have been really threatened with that and you would have been really threatened with his empowerment.\n\nHe wanted success.\n\nHe wanted to be famous.\n\nHe wanted to own a record company.\n\nYou know, he wanted to become like a businessman as well and have money, a lot of money.\n\nHe did not have a lot of money.\n\nCooke: ♪ Since I met

during the '50s.\n\nJ.W.\n\nAlexander had the presence of mind to form his own music company, and he didn't have any songs in his music company.\n\nSo Sam wanted to piggyback off of that idea to have a company which he can assign his songs to so that he had eventual ownership and royalty.\n\nThe music of Sam Cooke continues with a song that he recorded on his SAR label and made the charts in 1962.\n\nHere's Mel Carter and \"When a Boy Falls In Love.\"\n\nCarter: ♪ I heard them say love ♪ ♪ Is a wonderful thing ♪ ♪ Something ♪ Jamison: The only person in Sam's office and businesses that

created studios throughout Los Angeles -- the soul stations.\n\nSoul stations were an idea of Sam's where he could -- He could have local artists come and they can record music.\n\nSo they were actually recording studios set up around Los Angeles, where musicians could come in and meet one another and collaborate with one another, could use the instruments, can use the recording equipment.\n\nIt was essentially, \"Let's have a little Motown records, two or three places all over L.A., and we'll find local talent and we'll have this great band to back them.\n\nAnd the records that come out will be owned by a black guy, Sam Cooke, and it will benefit everybody.\n\nIt'll give people jobs.\n\nIt'll, you know, help him.\"\n\nSo I think that was the idea behind the soul

of his life was his manager, was because Allen Klein could get him out, he thought, from under RCA to where he controlled the music and the publishing.\n\nNarrator: The assertive and charismatic accountant accomplished what many artists of the early pop era failed to.\n\nHe collected what the artists were due from the all-powerful record companies.\n\nSam Cooke sees him as the perfect partner.\n\nSam met Allen Klein in the spring of '63.\n\nAnd Allen Klein supposedly approached Sam and said that \"I'm an accountant and what I specialize in is finding royalties from -- from the record labels that artists weren't aware that they may have been entitled to.\"\n\nAnd eventually he found that RCA had had some money that they owed Sam, and that's where their relationship started.\n\nNarrator: In 1963, Allen Klein wants to renegotiate the contracts with the record company RCA to Sam Cooke's advantage.\n\nHe proposes establishing a new company, Tracey Limited, a company with an unclear ownership structure.\n\nGreene: Allen Klein set up a tax shelter, Tracey Limited, for Sam.\n\nTracey was one of Sam's daughters, and it was Sam's understanding that this was set up as his record label.\n\nBut it -- it ended up that Allen Klein actually owned Tracey, whereas Sam didn't.\n\nAnd Sam was under the impression that he owned it.\n\n[ Voices overlapping ] -Corporation...

for almost 30 years.\n\nI've done a lot of investigative work.\n\nAnd I was just very curious from my background about how that came to be that Sam was on RCA and they obviously had the rights to his music, but as of this time, Abkco had the rights.\n\nSo I endeavored to do a copyright search of the Copyright Office to discover how that happened.\n\n♪♪ Tracey Limited is a Nevada corporation.\n\nIt was created in 1963.\n\nIt was presented to Sam as a company that would own his produced records.\n\nThe company would own all of the rights to Sam's music, and there would be a separate agreement between Tracey and RCA to distribute the music.\n\n♪♪ What's missing from the articles of incorporation that were filed was a statement about the shareholders of the company.\n\nThe articles speak to

person could change.\n\nThe board of directors could name a different person as president at any time.\n\nAnd that person was Allen Klein.\n\n♪♪ Narrator: The shareholders of Tracey Limited have never been disclosed, and under American law, are not required to be.\n\nNevertheless, from his study of the documents and changes to the board of directors, Donald Piper believes that Allen Klein was the main shareholder.\n\nSam believed everything Allen Klein told him.\n\nHe would stand at my desk and say, \"Oh, mm-hmm, hmm.\n\nYou know, we're doing this now, and Klein is gonna do this now and, you know...\" He was so impressed with Klein.\n\n[ Camera shutter clicks ] I had no respect for him.\n\nI thought he was a thief.\n\nI heard nothing but bad things about him.\n\nMy friend Florence

was dead.\n\nAnd it couldn't just be a screw-up.\n\nIt couldn't just be the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\nSo elaborate conspiracies are constructed around his death.\n\nAnd, you know, in my research, whenever I talk to somebody, they would talk about the mob or fellow musicians or jealous women or this or that, or his manager or his old manager.\n\nYou know, at the end of the day, you could never find any evidence that actually proved that.\n\nAnd my position on this has been all along that the reason we care is because of what he made in his life.\n\nAnd while it's a dramatic ending, how he died, the only reason we keep coming back to it is, \"Wait, that was the guy who sang 'You Send Me,' that was the guy who wrote 'A Change Is Gonna Come.'\"\n\nAnd that's really what's getting to people, I think.\n\nNarrator: The Sam Cooke case can be closed for now, but the Tracey Limited documents remain pertinent.\n\nDonald Piper not only believes that Allen Klein cleverly disguised his ownership, but he also doubts the legality of the notarial authentication of the Certificate of Incorporation.\n\nContrary to the legal requirement, the signatories were apparently not even present at the time of signing.\n\nAccording to the Articles of Incorporation of Tracey Limited, this document was signed by Sam Cooke, J.W.\n\nAlexander, S.R.\n\nCrane, on September 27, 1963, in New York.\n\nAccording to this advertisement in a New Orleans newspaper, Sam Cooke was a headliner at a show in New Orleans on Thursday night, September 26, 1963.\n\nSo it's highly unlikely that all three gentlemen went from New Orleans on Thursday night and flew up to New York to sign this document.\n\nIt made no sense to do that since Allen Klein and his lawyer were in New Orleans the night of the 26th.\n\nBut this notarial certificate on this document states that these three gentlemen personally appeared in New York City on September 27th.\n\nIt brings up a question of when and where and how was this document really signed?\n\nIt's totally possible that the notary wrote in this date here and these three gentlemen signed the document undated and it was notarized later.\n\nSo there is a question about this document, about its authenticity as to signature when and how.\n\n[ Camera shutter clicks ] Narrator: Sam Cooke biographer Peter Guralnick, who had the consent of Abkco for his book, describes the event from Allen Klein's perspective.\n\nA $110,000 check from the record company, which Klein and his lawyer gave Sam Cooke in New Orleans, is a strong argument for authenticating his signature on the contract.\n\nIt is doubtful whether the obligatory meeting with the notary took place in New York the next day with all participants present.\n\nIt is also notable that the notary who certified these and other Abkco contracts was also Allen Klein's longtime secretary, Adrienne Theresa Zanghi Goldfarb.\n\nAlthough it is not conclusively proven that Allen Klein was the sole shareholder of Tracey Limited, the facts speak for themselves.\n\nEven before Sam Cooke's death, Allen Klein gradually expanded his control of Tracey Limited.\n\nHe then quickly took complete control and Tracey Limited eventually merged with other companies to form Abkco.\n\nOur next change is the following year.\n\nThis is June 17, 1965, which is after Sam's -- six months after Sam has passed away.\n\nAnd now look who is the president of Tracey Records Limited.\n\nAllen Klein is the president.\n\nAnd Betty Klein, Allen's wife, is the secretary.\n\n♪♪ The final link in the chain filed in March of 1970.\n\nAmong other music companies, Tracey Records Limited is being merged into Abkco-Klein Corporation.\n\nThis now explains to you how Sam's music was transferred and ended up with Abkco.\n\nCooke: ♪ I lost ♪ ♪ Everything ♪ Narrator: Based on the Tracey Limited contract, the music label Abkco collects highly lucrative royalties to this day.\n\nOur interview requests for this film were not answered.\n\nCooke: ♪ Now my heart ♪ Samad: Nobody ever studies entertainers in American society from the business side.\n\nThe aspect that is probably most unpublicized about Sam Cooke is the ownership of his music.\n\nHe understood that -- that that was how those in the record industry were beating other artists, and he refused to allow himself to be beat that way.\n\nIt became more encouraging for another black artist to start his own company.\n\nThey never thought of it in those days.\n\nThat's how he changed it.\n\nAnd he left us with his music, his sound.\n\nA lot of people tried to imitate.\n\nRod Stewart's favorite singer is Sam.\n\nHe tries to sound like him.\n\nIf you go down a list of singers that are around today, how many of them imitate Sam and Sam's way of phrasing and -- and Sam's style?\n\nCooke: ♪ They don't seem ♪ Schmitt: I miss him still.\n\nYou know?\n\nI miss that smile.\n\nHe had an incredible smile.\n\nUm... Cooke: ♪ Love ♪ Yeah.\n\nHe was a great guy.\n\nGardner: Sam Cooke meant more to us.\n\nHe was a symbol of direction.\n\nIf we work hard and we went to school and did the right thing, we could prevail whether there was segregation or anything, that nothing could really hold us back if we really tried.\n\n[ Sam Cooke's \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" playing ] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪ I was born ♪ Students: ♪ By the river ♪ ♪ In a little tent ♪ ♪ Oh, and just like the river ♪ ♪ I've been running ♪ ♪ Ever since ♪ Elliott Bell: They wanted to revitalize the music program here at Wendell Phillips High School because they've had some very prominent and influential musicians that have come through here.\n\nOf course, the main person, Sam Cooke.\n\nWe did a little trivia about Sam Cooke, maybe how many kids were in the family?\n\nWhat group did he first start with?\n\nWe are actually starting a choir.\n\nIt's going to be gospel-based initially, just again so we could recognize the Thomas A.
