Now imagine if that rollercoaster breaks down. This ain't Disney World. They can't afford to get the ride fixed with outside help so the owners do it themselves. They know they'll get the job done, and probably do it better than an outside company, who only care about profits, and not what the punters want from their ride. So... in our movie world the coaster has had a little glitch as it got pulled up to the last drop, the big one. We are so very close, we can see over the dip... and the view looks very good indeed.\"\n\nMeanwhile Emily Booth, presenter of Channel 4's late night computer games show Bits who plays Melissa in the first segment of the flick, has started working on a film of her own - a behind the scenes documentary of Cradle Of Fear.\n\n\"I don't know why no one else has done this before,\" she told the 'Hammer. \"Stuff that goes on behind the scenes is probably more interesting that what actually goes on on camera!\"\n\nDaniel Lane - Metal Hammer\n\n29.4.2001 New album will be an include cd-rom music video of the new song on the album \"Born In A Burial Gown\".

I have listened it 4 times now in 1 hour and guess what ???? Its a f**ing great. It f**ks your brain out and then you will eat your brain and then you s*it them out of you a** hole. Its so f**king great that I have to curse a lot. Its kind of FTCTE song mixed with Cruelty and the beast album. Dani is singing beautifully as always and he has even more tricks to shown as before. Suffrons Curse is fucking great not fastest COF but surely f**ing beautiful song, sometimes its slow and easy and then BOW ! Screams and screams and f**king slamming. Female vocals included. Lord Abortion starts very slowly and then starts very \"black metal\" style. This song sounds lots of Covenant (with more black atmosphere) song, but of course in COF style. Her Ghost In The Fog (edit) has great drumming. VERY F**ing beautifully female vocal parts. Its hard to compare this song of anything before released COF. But its also very f**ing great song.\n\nI must say all people who is barking COF come and kiss my hairy a**. These 3 songs are f**ing great songs and COF isnt going down they are coming f**ing up and high. If you liked From The Cradle To Enslave song (not the E.P) but that video song and if you liked Cruelty and the Beast album. Then you cannot sleep before you got this album in your hands. This is something f**ing great. Just count the days.... Midian will come....\n\n06.10.2000 Confirmed track listing of Midian is:\n\nAt The Gates Of Midian\n\nCthulhu Dawn\n\nSaffron's Curse\n\nDeath Magick for Adepts\n\nLord Abortion\n\nAmor E Morte\n\nKissed in Cold Mirrors\n\nHer Ghost in The Fog\n\nSatanic Mantra\n\nTearing The Veil From Grace\n\nTortured Soul Asylum\n\nMidian is scheduled for release October,31\n\n21.09.2000\n\nCradle Of Filth prepares their next full-length attack...\n\nUK-based twisted metal freaks Cradle Of Filth have completed the recording and mixing of their forthcoming full-length album, 'Midian.' Though the band have been through several confusing lineup shifts since the release of the previous full-length, 'Cruelty And The Beast,' the 'Midian' lineup is, according to vocalist Dani Davey, in a word, \"perfect.\" The lineup is: Dani Davey (vocals), Robin Eaglestone (bass), Gian Piras (guitar), Paul Allender (guitar), Adrian Erlandsson (drums), and Martin Powell (keyboards). Dani and Robin have been in the band since its formation, while Gian joined for the 'Dusk And Her Embrace' album (he departed briefly last year, but has since returned full-time). Paul, having left after the band's 1994 debut, 'The Principle Of Evil Made Flesh,' makes his return with 'Midian,' while ex-At The Gates/-The Haunted drummer Adrian and ex-My Dying Bride member Martin make their debut in C.O.F. with 'Midian.' The album will include the following song selection, though not necessarily in this order: \"Her Ghost In The Fog,\" \"Saffron's Curse,\" \"Amor E Morte,\" \"Death Magick For Adepts,\" \"Lord Abortion,\" \"Tortured Soul Asylum,\" \"At The Gates Of Midian,\" \"Cthulhu Dawn,\" \"Creatures That Kissed In Cold Mirrors,\" and \"Tearing The Veil From Grace.\" As a Japanese bonus track, the band have recorded a Sabbat cover, \"For Those Who Died,\" which features Dani trading vocals with original Sabbat and current Skyclad frontman Martin Walkyier!\n\n18.09.2000\n\nCradle: weve heard the album!\n\nCRADLE OF FILTH invited Kerrang! To their Hastings recording studio last week, to her exclusive excerpts from their new album Midian. The band played us two new tracks: Her Ghost In The Fog and Saffrons Curse which strongly suggest that fans wont be disappointed by the first material to be recorded by the bands latest incarnation. Her Ghost In The Fog is more commercial than previous Filth offerings. Tumultuous and epic, it features plenty of double-bass drumming, intense screeches from singer Dani, haunting female backing vocals and a narration passage from Hellraiserstar Doug Bradley. `Saffrons Curse kicks off in classic speed metal mode, before slowing down for an atmospheric, operatic middle secion. While less complicated and erratic than previous efforts, it still clocks in at over six minutes. Dani tells Kerrang!: \"Midianprobably has more simple arrangements than last years EP (From The Cradle To Enslave), but what differs mostly is that its properly produced. Its monster! Weve brought in additional musicans like a cellist, some choir stuff and of course Doug Bradley who plays Pinhead. Hes a nice guy once you get past all the nails in his face. Only joking, hes a true thespian.\" He adds: \"Thers a fine balance on this album. A couple of songs are quite death metal in terms of riff structures, rather that gothic. God, I hate that word.\" While the final track-listing has yet to be decided, Midian will include: Tortured Soul Asylum, Death Magic For A Depht, Amour Morte (\"F**k know hows to spell that one,\" admits Dani. \"Its Portuguese, so were still working it out\"), Saffrons Curse, Creatures That Kissed In Cold Mirrors, Lord Abortion, Her Ghost In The Fog and Cthulhus Dawn. Midian will be released on the appropriately evil October 31 through Music For Nations. Cradle Of Filth will play three Kerrang!-sponsored X-Fest shows on December - two of which will break the annual event out of its traditional London setting. The dates are London Astoria December 15, Wolverhampton Wulfren Hall 16 and Manchester MDH 17.\n\n31.08.2000 Midian Track Listing\n\nHer Ghost in the Fog\n\nSaffron's Curse\n\nAmore Morte\n\nDeath Magik for Adepts\n\nLord Abortion\n\nTortured Soul Asylum\n\nCthulu Dawn\n\nRaven (Sous Reserve)\n\nSatanic Mantra (instrumental)\n\nRumor is that COF will cover a Black Sabbath song called 'For those Who Died'. That is not fully correct. The cover song is entitled 'For Those Who Died' but it's by a band called Sabbat. Black Sabbath never recorded a song entilted as that one but Sabbat did. This cover will be on the special edition and Japanese verion of 'Midian'.\n\n20.08.2000 Fan(g) Club Up And Running...\n\nYes the COF Fan(g) Club has people now contracted to handle the fan club properly.If you're interested in joining the fan club for COF you'll have to send a self addressed envelope(sorry it's not online yet) to the following address below:\n\nTHE ORDER OF THE DRAGON\n\nP.O. BOX 666\n\nCOLNE\n\nLANCS BB8 9GL\n\n18.08.2000 Adrian Erlandsson says:\n\nThe new stuff sounds really promising, John Fryer is doing a great job with the mixes. We did a cover for the japanese/special edition of the album of a Sabbath song called 'For those who died', which is sounding great. So far we have done mixes of 4 songs, 'Her ghost in the fog', 'Saffron's curse', 'Lord abortion', 'For those who died'(cover), the whole thing should be ready by the end of next week.\n\nWe have lined up some European tourdates starting on the 20th nov going through to 18th of Dec, support comes from Usurper and Christian death... then early 2001 we will do a U.S tour including south america (dates are currently beeing booked)\n\n15.08.2000 JK Potter is who will be doing the artwork for Cradle of Filth's upcoming release 'Midian'.Those who are not familiar with his work,as Dani calls it 'Some Really Fucked Up Shit'.And fucked up it is but in a good way though,just imagine a woman who posesed a leg as a huge human thumb,or the back of your head being that of a crocodile's,sound interesting yet?Indeed it should being how he will be putting his master touches to 'Midian'.\n\nJK Potter's work has been known on many book cover's and inserts for such author's as Stephen King,Joe Lansdale, Poppy Z. Brite , Dennis Etchison, and Ramsey Campbell.It looks as if Cradle of Filth should have an interesting look as with feel to their new release.If you're interested in more art and photography just head over to his site which is dedicated to his work of 'Embrace the Mutation' below. Visit JK Potter's Site Here\n\n08.08.2000Recording of new album 'Midian' is going full steam ahead with John Fryer on production duties. However, Diamanda Galas who was due to contribute to a track on the album is now unable to partake due to touring commitments. The band are disappointed, but look forward to working with her in the future, time and commitments allowing. Continuing their penchant for appearances by horror icons on their albums, Cradle Of Filth have recruited the vocal talents of Doug Bradley, 'Pinhead' from the Hellraiser movie. He will perform a spoken word for one of the 'Midian' tracks.\n\nAlso currently in production is the full length movie 'Cradle Of Fear' which features Dani Filth as a character, who believes he's a vampire, called The Man. The Film will feature the Cradle Of Filth track 'Lord Abortion' which is taken from their forthcoming 'Midian' album. The film is due to be released simultaneously along with 'Midian' and will only be available to watch on the Internet where classification rules and regulations do not apply.\n\n08.08.2000 If any one has been writing their letters to 'The Order Of The Dragon' which is Cradle of Filth's Fan(g) Club and wondered why they haven't got any thing back yet is because of some buisness complications.Cradle of Filth apologize on the fact that the Fan(g) Club isn't up and running.They're trying to get this resolved by the time the new album is expected to be released. Again COF apologize that they can't get the fans that have submitted in their letters to be joined on yet.\n\nIf you didn't know they had a Fan(g) Club,the address is featured in the back booklets of the Cradle of Filth Albums.If you Don;t have access to the address then you can read it below.The only thing is you won't get any recived joined membership until their complications have been resolved.\n\nTHE ORDER OF THE DRAGON\n\nP.O.

However, at the time we flippantly came up with the idea we could nothave expected quite so many people to takethe story seriously. Not only were the band's own label and management temporarily taken in, but a certain weekly rockmag was apparently aghast at missing such a significant scoop. Until, that is, the call went through to the band's pressofficer who suggested that these confused scribes might benefit from actually reading the offending piece. Former bandmembers and label bosses were also seen to place stunned phone calls... Back in the real world, the Filth themselves are working feverishly on material for their forthcoming studio album, the recording of which is set to begin at the end of this month. Although both studio and producer have yet to be finalised, the album is expected late this year. The bandwill break from recording to appear at a number of summer festivals including Wacken in Germany, Euro Rock in Belgium and a prestigious support slot with Iron Maiden in Athens during July.\n\nIs it april fools day???
