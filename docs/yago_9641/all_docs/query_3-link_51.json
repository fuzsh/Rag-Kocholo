        "text": "François Evans is a French/English feature film composer. He recently completed the chilling score for American director Cradeaux Alexander’s horror-thriller: Inherit the Witch (2023) released by Summer Hill Entertainment in the USA.\n\nBorn in London, classically-trained in piano and orchestral percussion, with a PhD in electro-acoustic music, he’s the composer of the distinctive soundtracks to Edgar Wright’s first movie A Fistful of Fingers, Alex Chandon’s cult adventure Pervirella, Shaun Mosley’s biblical drama The 3 Kings (featuring Ron Moody & Vanessa Redgrave), Roberto Roarke’s thriller Hitman and the darkly-pulsating score to Darren Ward’s action feature: Sudden Fury.\n\nHis music for Stefan Archetti’s critically acclaimed Italian children’s feature Il fungo sirena (The Mermaid Mushroom), helped the film win its Special Mention Award at the 2011 Granada Film Festival.\n\nIn West France he runs the unusual La.M.P. film music recording studio, designing surreal combinations for live instruments sometimes with rare vintage synthesizers.\n\nFrançois Evans conducting the Philharmonia Orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall, London, 2008\n\nReel Life\n\nFrançois Evans cut his teeth on fourteen short films for the London International Film School, the National Film & Television School and the Fondation Européenne pour la maîtrise de l’image et du son (FÉMIS) in Paris. His short film scores include 29 Days in February starring Jim Broadbent and Lysette Anthony, Simon Hunter’s Click and John Dower’s The Secret Songs of Butterfish, which won the Gold Plaque Award at the Chicago Film Festival and was shortlisted for Best Soundtrack at the San Francisco ‘Golden Reels’ Film Soundtrack Awards.\n\nDescribed as ‘A Midsummer Night’s Dream for synthesizers?’ (Mastodon), his first concept album of pop ballads: The Lunatic, the Lover & the Poet with lyrics by John Porter under the duo name: After Magritte, has been released worldwide.\n\nIn 2014 François performed on ondes Martenot at the Glastonbury Festival in a concert of film music by 1960s’ Thunderbirds composer Barry Gray, conducted by Charles Hazlewood and members of the bands Portishead and Goldfrapp. He had already multi-tracked all three ondes Martenot parts for the first, complete stereo re-recording of Maurice Jarre’s score for David Lean’s 1962 film Lawrence of Arabia, with the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\nFrançois Evans at the ondes Martenot, Colston Hall, Bristol, 2015\n\nIn 2008 he co-produced and conducted the 81-piece Philharmonia Orchestra with live electronics for the Barry Gray Centenary Concert of film music at London’s Royal Festival Hall, a charity gala in aid of the Cinema & Television Benevolent Fund.\n\nIn 1999, François arranged music for the wedding of David & Victoria Beckham.\n\nIn 1992 he assisted British composer Jonathan Harvey in the studio realization of the electronic part for Harvey’s opera Inquest of Love, commissioned by English National Opera.\n\nDuring the 1990s he was Associate Conductor of the London Gay Symphony Orchestra, conducting charity concerts including the world première of Wilfred Josephs’s Violin Concerto (soloist Michael Davis from Ohio, US) and the European public première of Josephs’s poignant Mortales, for 216 live musicians.\n\nFrançois Evans is a former voting member of BAFTA, a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, a member of the UK Music Producers’ Guild and the Royal Society of Musicians.\n\nWinning a scholarship from the Ralph Vaughan Williams Trust, Evans researched in spectral composition techniques for a year at IRCAM in Paris, tutored under Tristan Murail and other notable contemporary composers including Kaija Saariaho. Spectral composition techniques bring an otherworldly dimension to his music, by unifying timbre, sound identity and musical harmony.\n\nFrançois Evans studied ondes Martenot playing under Pascale Rousse-Lacordaire (pupil of Maurice Martenot) at the Conservatoire de musique, Boulogne Billancourt in Paris. – Rousse-Lacordaire was a member of the sextuor Jeanne Loriod – principal exponent of the instrument. He inherited an early modèle 6 (valve) instrument from the family of the late British film & TV composer Barry Gray, and occasionally uses this unique instrument in his scoring.\n\nEvans sang on the soundtracks to Barbra Streisand and Michel Legrand’s Yentl (1983) and Vangelis Papathanassiou’s 1492: Conquest of Paradise (1992) directed by Ridley Scott.\n\nBefore childhood experience singing with the chorus at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, Evans studied classical piano from age 6. He trained in harmony and counterpoint at the Watford School of Music. He read Music at the University of Ulster (‘first’ in composition under David Morris), was tutored in piano under Donald Cullington and orchestral percussion with David Openshaw (principal timpanist of the Ulster Orchestra). Evans attended music summer schools in Ennis, Ireland (under John Buckley), Dartington in Devon as apprentice to British film composer Wilfred Josephs and at Goldsmiths’ College, London in film music under Los Angeles composer Don Ray (former Chief Music Supervisor, CBS/MTM Studios). Evans gained a PhD in electroacoustic composition at City University of London under Prof. Simon Emmerson, receiving tutorials from British composers Simon Holt and Prof. Robert Saxton at the Guildhall School of Music, London."
