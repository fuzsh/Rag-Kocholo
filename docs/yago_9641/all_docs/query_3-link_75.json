        "text": "Source Name:\n\nNIFFF\n\nPost Thumb:\n\n/may12/nifff.jpg\n\nThe 2012 Neuchâtel International Fantastic Film Festival (NIFFF) runs July 6th-14th in Switzerland, and the first few details of what they have planned this year are trickling out. Read on if you plan to be in the area this summer!\n\nBarely two months before the celebrations begin, the NIFFF is announcing details of more of the festivities planned for between 6 and 14 July 2012: P.O.V. – POINT OF VIEW, a retrospective of FOUND FOOTAGE and the very first films to be presented in the ULTRA MOVIES and FILMS OF THE THIRD KIND sections!\n\nPOV (Point of View) Retrospective:\n\nFOUND FOOTAGE – discover fictional films composed of supposedly documentary video footage, currently proving very popular at the box office thanks to films such as PARANORMAL ACTIVITY and REC.\n\nPOINT OF VIEW explores this form of cinematography which simulates reality in order to bewitch viewers more effectively. The boundaries between reality and fiction will therefore become blurred in around 20 film projections that will celebrate the classics of the genre and unveil the most stupefying previews of the season!\n\nNIFFFF Unlimited\n\nIn 2012 the NIFFF is once again embellishing its panorama of fantasy production with two new sections that have become indispensable. ULTRA MOVIES will include the most exuberant examples of the genre at explosive midnight screenings with titles such as INBRED (Alex Chandon, UK, 2011) and BLIND ALLEY (Antonio Trashorras, Spain, 2011). Meanwhile FILMS OF THE THIRD KIND will include thrillers such as SONS OF NORWAY (Jens Lien, Norway, 2011) to be watched unreservedly!\n\nWHEN MUSICAL ROCKS: When Musical Films Become Subversive\n\nThis year’s festival is launching a project to be spread over three editions, exploring the links between fantasy cinema and music. The retrospective programme will be devoted to subversive musicals. From the late 1950s, a generation of filmmakers emerged whose anti-establishment fervour blew a real wind of rebellion through the genre. Through guitar riffs the rules, aesthetics, and unconventional themes of fantasy film gave rise to corrosive and provocative productions. The NIFFF is giving you the chance to discover some of the best of these cult films!\n\nMetropolis Live Performance – A masterpiece written by Fritz Lang with music by Gottfried Huppertz, Metropolis (1927) left a permanent mark on the history of cinema and film music. The NIFFF, in collaboration with the Nouvel Ensemble Contemporain (NEC), is offering you the opportunity to discover the whole film, accompanied by a live performance of the original music score. A spectacle never seen in Switzerland before and not to be missed on Sunday 8 July!\n\nRocky Horror Picture Show Live – In order to celebrate Couleur 3’s 30th birthday, the NIFFF and the third RTS radio station are joining forces to present a stupefying performance. An extraordinary production and plenty of other surprises to discover on Thursday 12 July!\n\nThe full programme will be available on 20 June 2012!
