        "text": "Eldorado, a low-budget British horror film with a cast including Peter O'Toole, Daryl Hannah and Sylvester McCoy, makes most of this year's Razzie nominees look like Citizen Kane. But why did it land its director in jail? In this feature from 2014, Chris Bell investigates...\n\nThere’s a scene roughly three quarters of the way through the film Eldorado – a British made horror-stroke-western-stroke-musical released in 2012 – that really stands out. It features comic Rik Mayall as Chef Mario, a mustachioed cannibal cook, prancing gaily around a dark, blood-splattered kitchen while vaguely lip-synching to a recording of Verdi’s La Traviata.\n\nBut what makes the scene remarkable is not the bubbling stew of human body parts. Or the visibly shaking Wild West set, built from scaffolding and inflatable palm trees in a field in Cornwall. Or the fact there is zero context for this scene existing at all. No, the scene stands out because it’s fairly watchable.\n\nEldorado, you see, is weapons-grade awful. By turns toe-curling and wholly baffling, this is 116 minutes of laughable prosthetics, shifting sets and appalling CGI. But while it never troubled the box office or the Academy upon its short-lived release, the story of how the film was made, and how it landed its director in jail, could be a film in itself.\n\nTrue: the subject matter – cannibalism, strippers, neo-Nazis – bore little resemblance to the fables of the Spanish Conquistadors suggested by the title. And yet the same thirst for glory, the same grand ambitions, were present here too. The film boasted a huge cast list of star performers – Daryl Hannah, David Carradine, Michael Madsen and Steve Guttenberg – and even a former Doctor Who. It represented one of the final films of screen legend Peter O’Toole. It was shot on location in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, London and Cornwall. It was the searing vision of just one determined man. And it would be realised with a budget of £9 million.\n\nOr, at least, that is what the man in question – writer, director and lead actor Richard Driscoll – reported to HM Revenue & Customs. But by June 2013, HMRC investigators had “unravelled a complex and organised VAT fraud” – one that had used film-making incentives to attempt to defraud the treasury of £1.5m. And Driscoll, one of the most colourful characters in the British film industry, would be standing in the dock.\n\nAs an actor (under the name Steven Craine), Driscoll had enjoyed only moderate success. After being trained, he claimed, at Rada (where he says he was a protégé of the late Richard Burton), he boasted he’d played an X-Wing pilot in Return Of The Jedi, and enjoyed walk-on parts in TV comedies such as It Ain’t Half Hot Mum and Boon. For a while he also claimed he was managing the band Wings (albeit without the involvement of any McCartneys).\n\nBut an unprecedented resurgence in one of the UK film industry’s more eccentric genres would see his star rise. The British horror movie industry had been in decline since the 1960s heyday of Hammer Films, and the later success of companies like Tigon-British and Amicus. But over the last decade a thriving cottage industry in slashing and gothic gore has emerged. One with a devoted following and healthy business plan, according to MJ Simpson, author of Urban Terrors: New British Horror Cinema.\n\n“The vast majority of films are produced for well under £100,000 – and most for five figures,” says Simpson. “Some are good and some are bad. But they can make decent money from people buying them on DVD or renting them off services like Netflix.”\n\nHence why, since 2008, there have been more than 60 full-length horror movies receiving a commercial release every year – all made here in the UK. From the likes of Stuart Brennan’s The Reverend, starring Rutger Hauer, to Alex Chandon’s Inbred (Tagline: “They came in peace. They left in pieces”).\n\nDriscoll, as a horror director and producer, saw huge potential in the low-budget homage. His gruesome 2001 “tribute” Kannibal, for example, lifted scenes, shots and dialogue wholesale from Silence Of The Lambs. And 2011’s Evil Calls: The Raven, part of a two-part trilogy (don’t ask), borrowed heavily from The Shining, Reservoir Dogs, and The Blair Witch Project, and starred Rik Mayall, Jason Donovan and, in his last film appearance, Norman Wisdom.\n\nSuch a notorious oeuvre drew Simpson into contact with Driscoll, when the latter emailed Simpson threatening him with legal action unless he took down some negative reviews. “I’ve watched a lot of terrible films over the years,” says Simpson. “And even by these standards, Driscoll’s output is atrocious. But whereas directors like [German] Uwe Boll will happily revel in a ‘worst film director ever’ title, Richard has absolutely no sense of humour about it. He genuinely thinks he’s creating art.”\n\nAnd Eldorado, announced in 2008, was to be his masterwork. Like many of his films, it would be filmed largely at Higher Nanpean Farm in Cornwall (Driscoll’s home and that of his only other visible source of income, a herd of llamas) – but also in Los Angeles, London and Las Vegas.\n\nIt was also billed as the first British movie ever filmed in 3D – or, as Driscoll’s self-penned press release put it, “Britons first £D film”. And it would combine several vivid genres in one kaleidoscopic package: horror, thriller, western and musical. The tag-line described it as “Mamma Mia for horror fans”.\n\nFilming began in June 2009, with external shots at “The Spirit of the West”, a now-bankrupt Wild West tourist attraction near Padstow. At its copyright-taunting heart is a homage to the 1980 comedy The Blues Brothers, the story of a road-trip by Oliver and Stanley Rosenblum, a musical act known as “The Jews Brothers” who flee an angry crowd of neo-Nazis and reach their next gig at the town of Eldorado – unaware that the town is filled with inbred cannibals who’ve just slaughtered a busload of tourists.\n\nAt least, this is what the film’s blurb suggests. In reality, thanks to a cheerful lack of continuity or coherent editing, none of the movie actually makes any sense. One explanation is that Driscoll was dating the film’s female lead, Rebecca Linley, but they split up halfway through filming. She left the project, forcing him to rescript without his main protagonist as he went.\n\nAs such, the dialogue, when not being inaudibly mumbled, seems to be largely improvised (sample line: “She’s going to die fast and hard. Like sperm hitting a condom.”). And there’s even a segment lasting two full minutes where the sound cuts out entirely, and is replaced by instrumental music while the actors mouth soundlessly at each other.\n\nAnd then there’s the cast. As the Narrator, Peter O’Toole’s stretched, elderly face appears sporadically through the film, visibly reading his lines off a typed A4 sheet. But almost as heartbreaking is the final film appearance of David Carradine, the beloved US martial arts actor. Previously best known for playing the titular assassin in Tarantino’s Kill Bill, here his role is a kind of ethereal monk, playing a flute in space-heaven. “As cinematic epitaphs go, both have to be worse than Raúl Juliá appearing in Streetfighter,” says MJ Simpson. “Or even Orson Welles’ last foray in Transformers: The Movie.”\n\nYet they were just the tip of the iceberg. While Driscoll had charitably given himself the lead role of Oliver Rosenblum, he’d also managed to amass an admirable cast list of ageing US cinema talent willing to debase themselves. Thus we’re treated to Steve Guttenberg (Cocoon, Police Academy) making his cinematic return as talent agent JJ, singing along to Tammy Wynette’s Stand By Your Man while surrounded by CGI flies.\n\nThen there’s Daryl Hannah, in a badly-fitting silver wig, sat reciting Edgar Allan Poe next to a surprised-looking vulture. And then there’s her Kill Bill co-star Michael Madsen singing a rockabilly version of “So Glad We Made It” by Steve Winwood, accompanied by two strippers naked except for Mexican wrestler masks. Had this film been made in, says, 1986, it may have detonated the box office.\n\n(Of course, none of the stars are actually singing themselves. “They’re lip-synching,” says MJ Simpson. “Driscoll went down to his working men’s club in Cornwall and got local pub singers to record cover versions.”)\n\nBut Britain is represented too. As well as Rik Mayall, there’s former Dr Who Sylvester McCoy as the neo-Nazi General Zwick who, due to sound problems, only has one line of audible dialogue. Joining them is former Bond girl Caroline Munro, Robert Llewellyn – best known as Kryten from Red Dwarf – and the perennial Robin Asquith. And as a non-celebrity sorbet, there’s also the World's Number One Johnny Depp Impersonator, Danny Lopez, and his girlfriend Lorna Bliss – a Britney Spears impersonator best known for once appearing topless on Britain’s Got Talent.\n\n“The fact is that most actors, if you pay them some money, will come and act in your film,” says Simpson. “Most people will appear at your birthday party if you pay them enough money. And US actors especially like the idea of coming over to Britain.”\n\nAnd come they did. As the filming continued from September to December 2009, the entire cast made the trip to the makeshift studios built in barns on Driscoll’s farm in Cornwall (all except for Daryl Hannah, who refused to leave LA). Brigitte Nielsen, for example, played Angel, a stripper who sings Aretha Franklin’s Respect in a barbershop while surrounded by topless lesbians. For her, it was the other big names that convinced her to take the role.\n\n“Everything happened very quickly,” she recalls. “I was travelling back to the States when they sent me the script and a list of the other actors taking part. I liked the strange storyline and the rest of the cast.”\n\nDespite later suffering the mild indignity of having her name spelt wrongly on the trailer, the DVD sleeve and the film’s end credits – in three different ways, too – Ms Nielsen was the only cast member we contacted who was happy to talk about her role. And for her, the experience was a happy one.\n\n“They sent a helicopter to pick me up in London,” she remembers. “The location was inside the director's private facilities, kind of small \"movie-studios\" owned by him. It was definitely a low budget production but I remember them accommodating me in a very nice dressing room. Everybody was so nice to me and the director was very kind.”\n\nBut while the cast were busy being helicoptered to set, behind the scenes, the crew were starting to mutiny. Freezing temperatures, delays, allegations of directorial bullying from Driscoll and a paucity of wages were beginning to take their toll. Douglas Shrock, for example, was employed as Computer Graphics Director by House of Fear, Driscoll’s production house, to create animations for the movie’s titles.\n\n“I had moved from the USA to the UK for the job,” he recalls. “Driscoll had promised housing, an office and a car – but instead I arrived to find the ‘studio’ was this rundown old farm. I worked in a freezing cold outbuilding, with a warped wooden door as my ‘desk’.” Driscoll also promised to arrange his work and residency permits, but failed to get around to it.\n\nAfter three months, Shrock called Driscoll to resign. “He drove round to where I was living, started yelling at me in the street and tried to put me in a headlock,” he tells me. “I flew back to the USA a few days later. He still owes me the airfare and two weeks pay.”\n\nLee Fenton-Wilkinson can empathise. He was 25 when originally employed by Driscoll as a propmaker. “But I ended up heading up the build of the sets when the Art Director walked off the film,” he remembers. “He paid me £700 a month but it was awful, awful, awful. Everyone wanted to do their best – and Richard would just thwart them at every turn.”\n\nThen how did he get so many talented people to work for him? “He was this incredibly charming guy,” says Fenton-Wilkinson. “He could get people to do the most ridiculous things. In fact, I’d say that was his one skill. The money wasn’t there. The script certainly wasn’t there. But we all carried on, for some reason. The whole crew seemed to bond together in adversity. In fact, I know three couples who met onset who are still together today.”\n\nBut it would only be after principal photography finally wrapped, in January 2010, that things really went off the rails. A swish London premiere – including an afterparty with entertainment by Wings and the Britney Spears impersonator – failed to materialise. A trailer was cut, then Driscoll announced the British Board of Film Classification had rejected Eldorado as “too strong for an 18 certificate”.\n\nStranger still, the movie then appeared for sale on DVD – as a 15 certificate – before being withdrawn almost immediately. It was then re-released a few months later by a newly-formed company, Moviola 3D, with a new title (“Highway To Hell”) and around 30 minutes of scenes missing. Curiously, all the vocals for the musical numbers had been re-recorded too – but with different lyrics.\n\nThe film’s financiers, meanwhile, were starting to panic. Keith Howell, director of Breakdown Films Ltd (who owned the sole distribution rights), desperately tried to track down Driscoll to obtain the master tapes. But by then Driscoll had put Higher Nanpean Farm on the market, and had disappeared.\n\nHowell would pass away before Driscoll’s fraud case came to trial. But his emails at the time reveal his anger: “Richard Driscoll is withholding the film material to either blackmail us or to try to illegally release the film for gain,” he wrote. “…Whilst I have no involvement in these releases it just indictifies [sic] Richard Driscoll as the sharliton [sic] that he is … the man has an ego the size of an elephant with the ability of a mouse.”\n\nIn June 2011 the hammer finally fell, as Driscoll was arrested on charges of tax fraud. At the centre of the case was an abuse of Film Tax Relief (FTR), introduced under the last Labour government, that allows any film with at least 25% of its production costs in the UK to claim relief on that expenditure (the system has now been changed).\n\nAccording to the HMRC, Driscoll had “falsified invoices for the costs of making films in order to reclaim VAT that he was not entitled to, and set up a number of associated companies that were used solely to commit the crime.\"\n\n“It wasn’t entirely surprising,” says Lee Fenton-Wilkinson. “No one knew where he was getting the money from. The figures just didn’t add up.”\n\nIndeed they didn’t. The scam included a bogus invoice suggesting Daryl Hannah was paid £570,000 for seven days' filming in Cornwall, when she’d never left the US. Other paperwork stated David Carradine was paid more than £400,000 for 13 days worth of work. However, it emerged the footage of him was actually “borrowed” from a 2008 TV miniseries called Kung Fu Killer. And at any rate, he had died two weeks prior to the date stamped on the invoice.\n\nAt Southwark Crown Court, Driscoll was duly found guilty of defrauding the Inland Revenue to the tune of £1.5 million – the VAT repayments on £9 million of costs, even though Eldorado only cost £1 million to make. On July 1st he was sentenced to three years in prison. “As part of the judgment, he was also banned from being a director,” says MJ Simpson. “Some people were disappointed to learn this meant a company director – not a film director.”\n\nThe case was the third in a series of high-profile investigations by the HMRC on movie-related tax fraud. In April, five British movie industry executives – Keith Hayley, Robert Bevan, Charles Savill, Cyril Mégret and Norman Leighton – were charged with allegedly defrauding £125 million.\n\nAnd in March, five people were jailed for a £2.8m tax credits scam involving an entirely fake film, Landscape of Lies, which had been claimed to cost £19.6m. In the latter case, however, the movie was never made – merely seven minutes of unusable footage filmed in a flat for £5,000. And this is where Driscoll was different, says Simpson.\n\n“Driscoll didn’t do it to make money – he did it to make a film,” he says. “Despite the fact he’s absolutely awful at it, at the heart of the scam was his desire to make the biggest movie he’d ever made. And that’s why there’s something of the myth about him even now. When people discover him – they want to find out more about his work. As cult filmmakers go, he’s the cultest you can get.”\n\nAnd true to the hubris of the original El Dorado myth, it was only his desire to keep going until the bitter end that was his undoing. Well, that and the fraud. “Even now in prison,” says Simpson, “I fully expect that he’s working on his next big project for when he’s released.”\n\nHe may be right. “I got a call from Driscoll a few days before he went to prison,” says Lee Fenton-Wilkinson. “He said he’d be away for a while, but asked if I’d knock up a few visuals for a new TV project he’d be working on. A cover for the DVD, that kind of thing.” It was a medieval fantasy romp. The title? Games Of The Thorns.\n\n[Originally published on 8 April 2014]"
