        "text": "Welcome back, after an extended hiatus, to my series on the film careers of certain Australian actresses and actors. This page looks at 50 of the best Australian actors who made their first feature film in the 2000s*. (It only looks at male actors, since we previously looked at the best new Australian film actresses of the 2000s here.) It includes actors born in Australia, as well as those who migrated to live in Australia (from NZ, Canada, the UK and elsewhere). While many of these actors also have important careers in television (and theatre), we will concentrate on the film roles these actors have played.\n\nThe 2000s saw two trends which affected new Australian actors:\n\nAmerica became a bigger option for young Australian actors. The success of the best of the 90s Aussie actors in America (Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, Heath Ledger, Hugh Jackman and others) blazed the trail, which many other Australian actors (the rest of the 90s generation, as well as younger actors here) were able to follow. Some of the young actors established themselves in Australian film and television before they moved to Hollywood, but others headed for Hollywood to start their careers in US television or movies. America became a magnet which was much harder to ignore.\n\nTelevision, which had always been an important career path for actors, became more accessible, more rewarding, more prestigious and more lucrative, throughout the 2000s, as the rise in streaming services, with their proliferation of new shows, accompanied by the rise in quality drama series made by HBO (and later Netflix and others), created many more opportunities for actors. Australian actors found themselves landing good roles in prestigious American TV series in greater numbers than ever, and many used their television exposure to create film careers for themselves.\n\nFor information on the following actors who made their film debuts before 2000: Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, Heath Ledger, Hugh Jackman, Eric Bana, David Wenham, Joel Edgerton, Richard Roxburgh, Simon Baker, Jason Clarke, William McInnes, Damon Herriman, David Roberts, Aden Young, Andrew S. Gilbert, John Brumpton, Paul Mercurio, Julian McMahon, Alex Dimitriades, Nicholas Hope, Robert Taylor, Matt Day, Jeremy Sims, Tom Long, Anthony Hayes, Stephen Curry, Aaron Pedersen, Sullivan Stapleton, Steve Le Marquand, Ewen Leslie, and Russell Dykstra; see Australian Film Actors of the 1990s.\n\nFor information on Geoffrey Rush, Hugo Weaving, Paul Hogan, Yahoo Serious, Ben Mendelsohn, Noah Taylor, Anthony LaPaglia, Colin Friels, but Barry Otto, Vince Colosimo, John Howard, Gary Sweet, Kim Gyngell, Robert Menzies, Mark Lee, David Argue, Tony Martin, Vernon Wells, Tom Burlinson, Steve Bastoni, Peter Phelps, Steven Vidler, John Polson, Ernie Dingo, and David Field, see Australian Film Actors of the 1980s.]\n\nI realise that this page is very long. The reason is that, not only are there more actors covered (since it covers two decades instead of one), but I have also included details about the television careers of each actor as well as their film careers. I expect many people will skim the page, looking only for certain actors of interest, rather than reading everything. I hope you find something of interest here. If you spot any mistakes, or omissions, please let me know.\n\nThe Top Ten\n\nChris Hemsworth\n\nChris Hemsworth was born in Melbourne in 1983, and grew up in Melbourne and the Northern Territory outback.
