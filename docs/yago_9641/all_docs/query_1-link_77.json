        "text": "Our new series on small film festivals is kicked off by Neil Mitchell, a freelance writer and editor of World Film Locations: London, among other publications. He also blogs here, and you can follow him on Twitter @nrm1972.\n\nDo you know of any festivals that deserve more attention? If so, email adam.boult@guardian.co.uk.\n\nFestival name: Frighten Brighton 2012\n\nLocation: Komedia, 44-47 Gardner Street, Brighton and Hove\n\nDate: 11 August 2012\n\nAbout: What better way to spend a gloriously sunny day on the south coast than to head into the bowels of Brighton's Komedia and sit it a darkened room watching five classic horror movies back to back? That's what was on offer for the scandalously low price of £5 a film or £15 for the day at the wonderfully named Frighten Brighton, the brainchild of genial co-hosts Rick Gladman and Sarah James. Assisting the co-hosts in their compering duties during the bijou, one day film festival was British Scream Queen Emily Booth, who has carved out a cult B-movie career appearing in the likes of Alex Chandon's Cradle of Fear (2001) and Jake West's Evil Aliens (2006). Close to 100 horror movie lovers eschewed the fresh air, baking temperatures and temptations afforded by the city in favour of a psychotic surgeon, mutated insects and numerous other nightmarish entities.\n\nInspired by memories of the BBC's long since defunct classic horror double bills, Gladman and James, aka Cyberschizoid and Scare Sarah, launched the Classic Horror Campaign: a grassroots, online and social media led, attempt to convince the powers that be to bring the aforementioned late night screenings back to the small screen. With regular event screenings held in Brighton and around the UK, the Classic Horror Campaign is both a celebration for those of us familiar with the movies and an introduction for those curious about them.\n\nA varied bill, with a movie culled from each decade between the 30s and the 70s, offered up an insight into the changing themes and visual styles the genre evolved through during the eras represented. Karl Freund's unhinged tale of obsession, Mad Love (1935), Jacques Tournier's atmospheric, psycho-sexual Cat People (1942), Gordon Douglas's Atomic age creature feature Them! (1954), Hammer's rural, class driven The Plague of the Zombies (Jack Gilling, 1966) and Don Coscarelli's loopy Phantasm (1979) took the assembled patrons from proto-body horror to inter-dimensional grave robbers in a blaze of striking imagery, allegorical narratives and evocative soundtracks. It's fair to say that these movies have long since lost the power to scare, if they ever truly held that position, and suffer in hindsight in terms of hammy acting and dated scripts, but their themes remain undeniably potent and contextually they are all fine examples of their respective production eras.\n\nResolutely unpretentious and with an inclusive family feel, Frighten Brighton, sponsored by Shock Horror magazine and attended by purveyors of cult and genre cinema reading, Hemlock Books, drew a laid-back, appreciative audience that, like the movies themselves, spanned numerous generations. Two years into the Classic Horror Campaign and Frighten Brighton 2012 shows that a simple idea backed with dedicated enthusiasm can reap highly pleasurable dividends. Now then BBC, about about those double bills."
