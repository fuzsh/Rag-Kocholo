        "text": "40 odd years ago, Tobe Hooper’s phenomenal The Texas Chain Saw Massacre created its own vague subgenre of backwoods slashers and hillbilly cannibals. Presently, this little subgenre is rather popular. Texas Chain Saw… has been remade into a big, money spinning franchise, along with The Hills Have Eyes and ‘..Chain Saw.. pretender Wrong Turn, which has already spawned four sequels of wildly varying quality. I’ve often wondered why there aren’t more British equivalents to these movies? Why have we been left out? We have plenty of untamed, hostile wilderness. We have inbreeding and drooling, toothless simpletons. I find it all rather insulting. Fortunately, Inbred has arrived to address the balance for proud, blood crazed, flesh eating Brits everywhere.\n\nWhat little story there is concerns a group of four young offenders being accompanied by two guardians on a team building retreat in the countryside. The first half hour of Inbred is far from promising, the younger four cast members are uniformly poor, though they aren’t catered for well by the terribly clunky script. Spending time with these characters would be unbearable were it not for James Doherty as their priggish, killjoy guardian Jeff. The script actually serves this character well and Doherty plays Jeff as a fully rounded character rather than a one note buffoon and it’s a blessed relief to have one likeable character during this half hour stretch.\n\nAfter a trip to the local pub (in a scene cribbed directly from An American Werewolf in London), the group make their way into the countryside for a little team building and, wouldn’t you know it, fall afoul of some less than friendly locals.\n\nIt’s at this point that Inbred improves dramatically. While what comes next is never entirely original (there are elements of The League of Gentlemen and 2001 Maniacs, but it most resembles Christopher Smith’s Severance, sharing some of that movie’s tonal issues), it is however imbued with tons of energy, jet black humour and grisly, eye-popping gore (all CGI enhanced, but the digital elements aren’t too jarring). It’s consistently great fun from here on out, helped a great deal by the hugely enjoyable performances from the actors playing the nutcase locals. Seamus O’Neill and Neil Leiper are both excellent as a seriously unhinged father and son duo, while Emmerdale actor Dominic Brunt (featured prominently on the Blu-ray cover, as if his presence will somehow appeal to horror-heads) puts in an amusing, dialogue free cameo as a chainsaw weilding, simpleton butcher named Podge.\n\nIt’s by no means perfect of course. As I said previously the four young cast members are utterly disposable (but that’s forgivable given how imaginatively they’re disposed of). The script is uninspired and full of irritating dialogue, especially in the case of the young ‘uns. The CGI, while used sparingly, seems unnecessary given the quality of the practical effects on display. The soundtrack misses an opportunity, it features one incessantly catchy folk number called ‘Ee by gum’, but otherwise adds little in terms of atmosphere or energy.\n\nAll in all though, once you power through that weak first half hour, Inbred is a whole lot of silly, strange and gory fun.\n\nDIRECTOR: ALEX CHANDON\n\nWRITER: ALEX CHANDON, PAUL SHRIMPTON\n\nSTARS: JO HARTLEY, JAMES DOHERTY, SEAMUS O’NEILL, JAMES BURROWS, NADINE ROSE MULKERRIN, TERRY HAYWOOD, NEIL LEIPER, CHRIS WALLER, DOMINIC BRUNT, EMILY BOOTH\n\nRUNTIME: 94 MINS APPROX\n\nCOUNTRY: UK/GERMANY"
