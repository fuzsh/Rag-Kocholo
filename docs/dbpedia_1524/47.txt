Sharon Brown brings over 14 years of experience as a paralegal to Abrenio Law. Originally from North Carolina, Sharon is the wife of a retired military officer who served over 28 years in the United States Air Force.

Being a paralegal is a second career for Sharon. Prior to the career change, Sharon taught elementary school. She headed a program that targeted second graders who were behind in reading and language to get them at grade level by the end of the school year. She says, “I found this most rewarding…when you actually see the light in a child’s eyes brighten because they “got it”. When you see a child who was literally afraid of a book because it was difficult to read, excited about going to the library and choosing a book to take home…amazing

Sharon attended North Carolina Central University where she majored in Elementary Education. After several years in the school system and military moves, she decided to get a paralegal degree as she was always intrigued with the law and the criminal justice system.

Sharon has worked on “both sides” of the criminal justice system, she was the paralegal and administrative assistant for the Circuit Solicitor in Greenville, South Carolina for 5 years. She also worked for a criminal defense attorney prior to her stint at the Solicitor’s Office. “Working on both sides of the judicial system, really gives you a broader perspective and a much better understanding of how the law works in general”.

“I am excited to be a part of Abrenio Law, each client, each phone call, gives me the opportunity to help someone get through a most challenging time in their lives.”

Sharon lives in Fairfax, Virginia with her husband Stanley. They are the parents of two sons, Morgan (Anna) and Daniel (Aviance), and grandparents to Aubrey!
