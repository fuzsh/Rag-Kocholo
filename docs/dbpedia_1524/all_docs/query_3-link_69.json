        "text": "With a career in the U.S. Army that spanned 30 years across three continents, the service demonstrated by Brown is exemplary. She not only served at the bedside but is responsible for educating thousands of U.S. Army Nurses throughout her career. Following retirement, Brown has found great purpose in serving communities in Kenya and Haiti by way of medical mission trips. She is still practicing as a nurse practitioner in the Jacksonville, Florida area."
