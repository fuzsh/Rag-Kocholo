        "text": "I hold a PhD in animal breeding and genetics since 2011. I have experience and interest in a broad range of activities related to the selective breeding and genetic improvement of performance, health and welfare of aquaculture species and livestock animals. My research interests include analyzing phenotypic and genomic data of different animal species (Fish, Pigs, Cattle, Buffalo, Sheep, Goat, and Rabbits), using Bayesian and Frequentist statistics; beside working in molecular genetics laboratories.\n\nMy current research activities encompass the integration of social network analysis, quantitative genetics, and machine/deep learning to improve animal performance, welfare, and health.\n\nThe aim of my research is to understand the interactions between large DNA viruses and their host, and translate this knowledge into clinical outcomes. My research team focuses on the three capripoxvirus species (lumpy skin disease virus, sheeppox virus and goatpox virus) which each cause severe disease in livestock in Africa, Asia and the Middle East.\n\nIn addition to my research I am the OIE laboratory expert for capripoxviruses at the Pirbright Institute and provide advice to international agencies on the control of these viruses. I lead the European Commission funded project DEFEND which is tackling the emergence of African swine fever and lumpy skin disease in Europe in partnership with 31 other consortium members including industry partners ID-VET and Zoetis. (EU H2020 research programme 773701).\n\nMy research interests are in molecular pathways that become dysregulated in cancer and dysregulation of osteoclasts in bone. I have a particluar interest in oral tumours in cats, and how they invade the bone of the mandible as well as feline tooth resorption. Osteoclasts are my favourite cell, so anything related to osteoclasts and I am interested!\n\nI am a behavioural ecologist interested in within species variation in individual behaviour. I use a combination of sensor technology, experimental design and statistical techniques to answer questions about how an individualâ€™s environment and past experiences can influence variability, both within themselves and amongst each other as well as at a group level.\n\nDuring my PhD, I used amphibian tadpoles as model organism to understand the how individual variation in behaviour is influenced by environmental factors such as competition, food availability and human disturbance.\n\nMy post-doctoral research is on the behaviour of commercially bred Pekin ducks. I use multiple sources of environmental, sensor, genomic and phenotypes collected on individual ducks to improve both understanding of individuals and flock performance.\n\nPrion diseases are prototypical protein-misfolding neurodegenerative disorders. Using this model we study how protein-misfolding within the brain results in activation of the supporting glia cells, impacts upon brain function and ultimately leads to loss of the connections (synapses) and death of brain cells (neurons). The goal of my research is to understand how this happens and how other infections and activation of the immune system may influence neurodegeneration. the ultimate goal of my research is to identify potential therapeutic treatments for these currently untreatable conditions.\n\nTo date my main research interest has been in mixed (or multilevel) models. These involve identifying and accounting for sources of variation and correlation structures in the data and offer potential advantages over conventional modelling methods including: improved efficiency, more appropriate variances and correlations, wider inference and offer the potential to overcome problems caused by missing data.\n\nAt The Roslin Institute my research will involve providing the statistical contribution to collaborative scientific research using a range of methods and developing novel statistical approaches to particular problems arising where appropriate. I expect to develop my research in mixed models further in addressing applications arising within the Institute.\n\nThe Doeschl-Wilson group investigates how the genetics of individuals affects the spread of infectious disease, both within an animal and between animals. We are an interdisciplinary group of scientists aiming to effectively combine field and laboratory experiments with mathematical modelling and quantitative genetics theory, with the ultimate aim to improve livestock health and resilience.\n\nI lead a research group working in the areas of Stem Cell biology and Reproductive Biology in large animal species. We are interested in these species both from a veterinary perspective and as disease models. Work in my laboratory spans from hypothesis-led studies to understand basic cell, organ and whole animal biology and physiology, all the way through to translational studies with industry to develop novel molecular diagnostics and cell-based tools to address specific key challenges faced by the livestock (cattle and pigs) industry and companion animal sectors, in addition to applications for cellular agriculture. My laboratory is best known for pioneering work on 1) the use of miRNAs as novel diagnostic biomarkers for cattle, and 2) the characterization and application of stem cells (iPSCs and MSCs) in farm species (horse, cattle, pigs).\n\nResearch projects:\n\n- Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal cells (MSCs) as novel tools for combating antimicrobial resistance in companion animals (horses and dogs) and livestock (cattle)\n\n- Developing novel stem cell approaches towards next-generation regenerative therapies\n\n- Involvement of Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal cells in Mycobacterium infection\n\n- Exploiting stem cell and gene editing technologies towards discovery of genetic variants important for muscle development and meat production\n\n- Isolation and characterisation of myogenic precursor cells in pigs: towards development of an in vitro model for the study of muscle growth\n\nOur research has been to understand how E. coli causes disease, and then based on that knowledge develop interventions including vaccines and more recently phage therapy - the killing of bacteria with viruses that predate on them. We are striving for a 'predictive' understanding of E. coli genomes, so that based on the sequence of any E. coli we can infer where it has come from, its threat to animal or human health, and how to successfully treat it with antibiotics or phage.\n\nOur research group is interested in how embryonic patterns are produced during development, with a particular focus on interrogating the influences of the molecular and mechanoceullar environment on these processes. We take a multidisciplinary approach incorporating aspects of several fields including cell biology, developmental biology, mathematics and engineering, using the chick embryo as our primary model. Our goal is to understand the core processes which drive vertebrate periodic pattern formation to provide insight into the causality of associated birth disorders and help guide future regenerative medicine strategies.\n\nI lead the HighlanderLab, which focuses on managing and improving populations using data science, genetics, and breeding.\n\nWe focus on populations used for food, feed, and fibre production with some spillover into other populations.\n\nWe are particularly interested in:\n\n(i) methods for genetics and breeding,\n\n(ii) design and optimisation of breeding programmes, and\n\n(iii) analysis of data to unravel biology and to find new ways of improving populations.\n\nMy lab is interested in the role of RNA regulators and RNA binding proteins in the regulation of gene expression. Most of our research has focussed on the assembly of large macromolecular complexes, such as the yeast ribosome. However, more recently, we have also been working on understanding the role of RNA surveillance factors in the regulation of mRNA transcription and translation in both yeast and pathogenic bacteria. The goal of our research is to obtain detailed mechanistic insights into the strategies that organisms use for regulating gene expression during rapid adaptive responses. For our research we use highly innovative methodologies such as CRAC and CLASH and high-throughput structure probing methods. Our work is funded by the BBSRC, SULSA, the Wellcome Trust and the Medical Research Council.\n\nBroadly speaking, my interests lie in the relationships between pathogens and their hosts, the evolution of traits such as resistance, virulence and host preference, and how an understanding of these processes can be used to inform disease control and intervention strategies. Much of my research career has been focused on the evolution of influenza viruses.\n\nThe overall interest of the Lynskey Lab is the study of virulence factor regulation and innate immune modulation by pathogenic streptococci. Our work is currently focused on two important pathogens, Streptococcus agalactiae (group B Streptococcus), the causative agent of economically important infections in multiple animal hosts which has also emerged as a major human pathogen, and the human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus). We seek to identify regulatory genes that enable the bacteria to switch from a benign to invasive disease state and characterise their mechanism of action and impact on host immune defences. We are also interested to use this information to better understand and characterise the factors driving host-species adaptation of S. agalactiae, which causes significant disease in humans, cattle and fish.\n\nMy interests span genomics and genome biology, evolutionary biology, animal health, immunology, and pathogens. I apply my research towards improvements in the aquaculture sector. I work on mostly on fish and their pathogens, and am particularly interested in the salmonid family, where all species share an ancestral whole genome duplication.\n\nI am interested in the infection biology of protozoan parasites of livestock. I am particularly attracted to integrated approaches where we can learn about both host and parasite processes that are key to infection/disease progression â€“ especially in the clinically relevant host, the cow. I work primarily on African trypanosomes, but also on Theileria parva , which together are the most significant pathogens affecting livestock in sub-Saharan Africa. I also work on Cryptosporidium parvum, a worldwide enteric pathogen of humans and livestock. My work aims to identify key host-parasite interactions that determine disease outcome, further our understanding of bovine immunobiology, and identify targets for interventions (e.g. drug & vaccine development).\n\nI'm interested in applying machine learning methods and other computational tools to real world data. I use my computational background and software engineering skills to answer research questions from various disciplines including neuroscience, cognitive science and biology. The overarching theme of my research programme can be summarised as quantifying contribution of finely-tuned genetic regulation to emergence of complex function at the synapse using cutting edge computational tools. In the future it will also include tackling the question of the evolution of molecular etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders\n\nAetiopathogenesis of equine airway disease and characterising the equine pulmonary innate immune response. Equine dysautonomia, primarily in relation to the investigation of aetiologic pathways.\n\nScotts currently active areas of reseach include the following:\n\n(1) studies on equine grass sickness with a particular focus on the potential aetiological role of ingested pasture-derived mycotoxins;\n\n(2) studies of the innate immunity of the equine airway, with a particular focus on the role of the alveolar macrophage in determining disease susceptibility;\n\n(3) studies on the role of intestinal macrophage activation in the initiation and maintenance of gut motility disturbances following gastrointestinal surgery (post-operative ileus).\n\nMy main research interest is in the development of novel breeding methodologies and tools. This work involves a synergy between theoretical quantitative genetics and practical animal breeding. My main expertise is the application of genomic selection on big datasets for various species (pig, chicken, cattle, etc.) and various models, with emphasis on single-step genomic prediction.\n\nOur group investigates epithelial tissue fusion and related human disorders. Disruptions to how tissues fuse together during human development is a common cause of birth defects, affecting approximately 1 in 500 people in the UK. Our research has been prompted because despite our best efforts, most patients born with problems such as cleft palate, spina bifida, and heart defects still don't have the genetic cause of their disorder identified. This often impacts genetic counselling and efforts towards prevention. We also remain unsure what impacts maternal environment have on these conditions (e.g. illness, vitamin deficiency, or substance abuse). We aim to address these by performing transformative research to reveal the key genes, cell behaviours, and molecular systems required for normal tissue fusion, and provide a step-change in our knowledge of how these can be perturbed.\n\nDr. Regan's lab is concerned with exploring immune systems of invertebrate aquaculture species in the context of industry relevant diseases. This includes interactions with host-associated microbiomes, environmental stressors and environmental microbiota.\n\nIn the foreseeable future, much of this work will focus on how host genetics and environmental stressors affect blue mussel immunology using a whole range of molecular biology and â€“omics technologies.\n\nMy clinical and research interest is neonatal brain injury and neuroprotection of the term and near-term baby, working both as a consultant neonatologist and research group lead at UCL over the past 20 years. The journey has been exciting and fast-moving, with therapeutic hypothermia (HT) for neonatal encephalopathy (NE) being a significant advance in newborn care. However, as HT is only partially protective, we are searching for adjunct therapies which can complement and synergize with HT. We study mechanisms of brain injury using MR techniques and NIRS. With the aim to move therapies along the translational pipeline, we have studied the following neuroprotective agents: melatonin, noble gases (xenon and argon), amiloride, erythropoeitin, remote ischemic post conditioning. We have shown that proton MRS is a robust marker of neurodevelopmental outcome in NE and we use this biomarker both in our pre-clinical models and for clinical prognosis.\n\nI work in the field of avian genomics with a particular interest in â€˜resilienceâ€™ of birds, whether that be with respect to disease resistance (with a focus on Marek's disease and avian flu) or environmental adaptation. I also work as part of the Centre for Livestock Genetics and Health (CTLGH), investigating the genetics of indigenous African chickens.\n\nThe Sutton lab is dedicated to delving into the intricate workings of the chicken's immune system. Leveraging state-of-the-art transgenic technologies pioneered at the Roslin Institute, our research hones in on elucidating the pivotal roles played by innate immune cells, specifically macrophages and dendritic cells, in host responses. Employing a blend of cutting-edge in vivo and in vitro models, our objective is to comprehensively grasp how these cells orchestrate immune responses to infections and vaccines within mucosal tissues. Using this knowledge we can devise more effective strategies to control disease and to enhance poultry health and productivity.\n\nThe research in the Sutton lab is geared towards not only deepening our understanding of the chicken's immune system but also translating this knowledge into practical applications that can significantly benefit the poultry industry, promoting healthier and more productive poultry farming.\n\nHer research focuses on understanding how porcine and zoonotic viruses interact with their hosts and how this understanding can be used to identify genetic susceptibility/resistance and develop diagnostics and treatments. Braving the split between human and animal viruses and technologies Christine is, for example, involved in the generation of genome edited pigs resistant towards one of the most costly pig viruses but also part of the IMI CARE consortium aiming to identify and repurpose drugs against SARS-CoV-2 infection causing COVID-19.\n\nThe understanding on how vertebrate genes are switched on and off during differentiation to control cell fate and to specify different lineages is the molecular basis for any biological phenomenon. My research area is focused on many aspects of chromatin biology with a specific focus on epigenetic regulators. Chromatin Biology is a very strong research area at the University of Edinburgh and the research conducted at the Roslin Institute will take advantage of using many species to develop comparative (epi)genomics approaches to understand the complexity of gene regulation during evolution.\n\nWe are trying to understand how aquatic animals respond to challenges such as disease and environmental stressors, and the molecular regulation of those pathways to make them more resilient to those challenges. The ways in which fish and prawns respond to stressors might be shared with other animals, while many others will be unique and itâ€™s understanding those mechanisms, and understanding how these amazing creatures respond and thrive in a dynamic marine environment, that Iâ€™m passionate about.\n\nHave you ever wondered how the bacteria that live on and inside of us influence how our bodies function? That is the question that the Williams lab aims to answer, with a specific focus on the female reproductive tract and the mammary gland. By identifying the mechanisms by which the microbiome influences female reproductive health and fertility, and how this is altered during disease, our aim is to develop diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to combat the most common and debilitating mammalian reproductive health issues and disorders of lactation.\n\nIn a complementary theme, our lab also investigates the social and political factors influencing infant feeding in the UK, and the barriers that women face when it comes to feeding their babies.\n\nMy postdoctoral project examines the resilience of wild birds to climate change, where I study their genomics and genetics using transcriptomic/epigenetic approaches to understand seasonality.\n\nMy Ph.D. project focuses on functional genomics in chicken, including the genotype-phenotype mapping, population genetics of human-mediated introgression, comparative genomics, and transcriptomics.\n\nExperience in whole-genome sequence data, RNA-seq data, and genome editing techniques (CRISPR-Cas9 in zebrafish).\n\nMy passion and interest are growing in bioinformatics to develop computational tools; understanding the function of the genome, and using genomics to study the demography and evolution of populations."
