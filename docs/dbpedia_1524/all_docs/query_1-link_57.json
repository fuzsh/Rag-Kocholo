        "text": "At Baillie Gifford we don’t provide financial advice, but we do try our best to provide you with all the information we think you might need to make investment decisions. Of course, we realise there are occasions when you may want the advice of an expert.\n\nUsing professional financial advice\n\nAn authorised intermediary can give you advice and help on how best to manage your financial affairs based on your circumstances and investment aspirations. They can also help keep track of all your different investment interests, saving you a lot of time and bookkeeping.\n\nFinding a financial adviser near you\n\nIf you want to use an authorised intermediary, MyLocalAdviser is a website that allows you to search for authorised intermediaries in your area. You can visit their site on www.mylocaladviser.co.uk\n\nAny investment in an investment trust involves risk. You should be aware of the following risks when considering investing.\n\nPast performance\n\nPast performance is not a guide to future performance.\n\nThe value of your investment\n\nThe investment trusts managed by Baillie Gifford & Co Limited are listed UK companies and are not authorised or regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. The value of their shares, and any income from them, can fall as well as rise and investors may not get back the amount invested.\n\nOverseas investment\n\nThe Trust invests in overseas securities. Changes in the rates of exchange may also cause the value of your investment (and any income it may pay) to go down or up.\n\nGearing\n\nThe Trust can borrow money to make further investments (sometimes known as “gearing” or “leverage”). The risk is that when this money is repaid by the Trust, the value of the investments may not be enough to cover the borrowing and interest costs, and the Trust will make a loss. If the Trust's investments fall in value, any invested borrowings will increase the amount of this loss.\n\nShare buy-backs\n\nThe Trust can buy back its own shares. The risks from borrowing, referred to above, are increased when a trust buys back its own shares.\n\nLiquidity\n\nMarket values for securities which have become difficult to trade may not be readily available and there can be no assurance that any value assigned to such securities will accurately reflect the price the Trust might receive upon their sale.\n\nDerivatives\n\nThe Trust can make use of derivatives to obtain, increase or reduce exposure to assets and may result in the Trust being leveraged. Derivatives are most often used to compensate for possible unfavourable currency and market movements. This may result in greater movements (down or up) in the net asset value of the Trust. It is not our intention that the use of derivatives will significantly alter the overall risk profile of the Trust. A further risk exists in respect of the counterparty with whom the derivative transaction is made. Due care and diligence is exercised in the selection of counterparties, however, the possibility of the counterparty failing to pay sums due to the Trust still remains.\n\nInvestment in smaller companies\n\nInvestment in smaller companies is generally considered higher risk as changes in their share prices may be greater and the shares may be harder to sell. Smaller companies may do less well in periods of unfavourable economic conditions.\n\nSingle country trust\n\nThe Trust’s exposure to a single market and currency may increase risk.\n\nCharges to income\n\nCharges are deducted from income. Where income is low, the expenses may be greater than the total income received, meaning the Trust may not pay a dividend and the capital value would be reduced.\n\nIncome is less important\n\nThe aim of the Trust is to achieve capital growth. You should not expect a significant, or steady, annual income from the Trust.\n\nContinuation vote\n\nShareholders in the Trust have the right to vote at the Annual General Meeting on whether to continue the Trust or wind it up. If the shareholders decide to wind the Trust up, the assets will be sold and you will receive a cash sum in relation to your shareholding.\n\nTax Rates\n\nYou should note that tax rates and reliefs may change at any time and their value depends on your circumstances.\n\nRegulation\n\nThe Trust is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is not authorised or regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority.\n\nInformation subject to change\n\nThe information and opinions expressed within this website are subject to change without notice.\n\nNot Investment Advice\n\nThis information has been issued and approved by Baillie Gifford & Co Limited and does not in any way constitute investment advice.\n\nSuitability for retail distribution\n\nPlease note that the Company currently conducts its affairs, and intends to continue to conduct its affairs, so that the Company’s ordinary shares can be recommended by Independent Financial Advisers to ordinary retail investors in accordance with the FCA’s rules in relation to non-mainstream pooled investment products (NMPI). The Company’s ordinary shares are excluded from the FCA’s restrictions which apply to non-mainstream pooled investment products because they are shares in an investment trust."
