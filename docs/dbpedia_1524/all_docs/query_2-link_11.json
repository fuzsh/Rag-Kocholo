        "text": "Born Jan 11, in NYC, This BELTY DIVA made her Broadway Debut in Maggie Flynn at the age of 5. At 13, she was the youngest actress to play the role of Dorothy in the National Tour of THE WIZ.\n\nIn 1983, She was the second woman in the WORLD to play the Narrator of Joseph And The Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat taking over when Original DIVA Laurie Beechman left in 1982. They both belted such songs as \"Pharoah Story\" and the infamous \"Letting Out A Mighty Roar!\" She won the Carbonell Award for Best Actress in a Musical.\n\nAfter this amazing run, Michael Bennet, choreographer of the ever famous A CHORUS LINE, then hand picked her to play Effie in the 1985 National Tour of Dreamgirls.\n\n(Following in the footsteps of Laurie Beechman, Jennifer Holliday, and Linda Eder is pretty tuff to do. But when will Sharon create her own roles?)\n\nShe was Sir Richard Attenborough's first choice to play the specially-written-in, non-musical role of Kim, Zack's assistant in A Chorus Line: The Movie.\n\nShe also played various ensemble roles in the first national tour of RENT including: Joanne's Mom, Bum, Season's of Love Soloist and Mimi's Mom\n\nSharon was also the first African American woman to play the tragic Lucy Harris, in the first National Tour of Jekyll & Hyde singing such amazing belt songs as \"Bring On The Men\", \"A New Life\", \"In His Eyes\", \"Dangerous Game\" and \"Someone Like You\".\n\nSharon is currently set to star in a brand new musical, Tymothy, that's already been slated as the one of the most gripping black musical's since DREAMGIRLS."
