I love caring for adults over the age of 65. My practice is focused on adults and the geriatric population. I hope to weave palliative medicine into my patient contacts, focusing on the individual patient’s goals of care.\n\nHello, I’m Sharon\n\nAfter living in the high desert of Northern Nevada for 20+ years, the weather, people, tulips and especially Salish Sea are welcome changes. I enjoy traveling and exploring our beautiful island with my husband and two elderly dogs and brand-new puppy."
