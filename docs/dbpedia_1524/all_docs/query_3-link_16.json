Today is my two year, second-day anniversary! ðŸ’™ The biggest blessing about Jobot is the opportunity for flex hours and a remote working environment. I'm so grateful for the chance to be there for my kids while working at this awesome place I now call home! Thank you, Heidi Golledge and Tonya Ghanbari for this fantastic work environment! #thatjobotlife #remoteworking #grateful\n\nSee more comments\n\nTo view or add a comment, sign in"
