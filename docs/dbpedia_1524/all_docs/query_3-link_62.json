        "text": "What are your primary job responsibilities?\n\nAs a member of Assurant, Inc.'s Risk Management team, I am responsible for the placement of reinsurance and corporate insurance.\n\nWhy did you choose the MS-RMI Program at FSU?\n\nI chose the program based on its top-rate reputation, the depth and expertise of the program’s professors; the practical, thought-provoking, and forward-looking curriculum; and the strength of the FSU educational franchise generally. Also, I thought the program offered good value.\n\nHow did your graduate education help shape your professional experiences?\n\nI've been in the industry a long time, but I had knowledge gaps particularly in the area of data, modeling and analytics. The graduate education allowed me to fill-in these gaps, which has been helpful in my role.\n\nHow has working in your industry changed the way you look at the world?\n\nI tend to apply the risk versus reward view, which I first began applying as an insurance underwriter many years ago to many different types of problems. For example, what is the risk of not driving back to the house to get the single school shoe my then six year-old daughter left at home – one shoe on, one left at home.\n\nHow have you stayed connected to the FSU MS-RMI Program?\n\nI have stayed connected via all forms of social media and electronic capabilities. I am fortunate to have met several of the RMI professors and some of my classmates in-person at pre-COVID events!\n\nWho do you look to for inspiration?\n\nWhen perseverance is needed, I paraphrase Winston Churchill to myself: “Never, ever give up!”\n\nWhat would someone be surprised to learn about you?\n\nI’m shy at heart.\n\nWhat’s the one thing you couldn’t do without at work?\n\nCoffee.\n\nBest piece of advice you’ve received?\n\n“Think of yourself as a customer – how would you like to be treated?”"
