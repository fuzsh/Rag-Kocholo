        "text": "Detroit Opera President and CEO Wayne S. Brown doesn’t like the term “workaholic.”\n\n“I don’t necessarily think of turning a switch: I’m working, then turn the switch and I’m not working,” Brown said during a recent interview. \"I spend more time in my office and in the theater versus time at home. It’s just a sense of ongoing presence, ongoing involvement. There are times I try to detach because I think it’s important that we do that. But what I do, I don’t consider work. I consider it my charge.”\n\nThat sense of duty has been a hallmark of Brown’s work with arts nonprofits for 50 years, nine of them at Detroit Opera. The organization recently announced that he would be stepping down from his position at the end of the 2023-24 season. Brown’s run has been marked by tremendous growth for the company, and it has captured international attention as Detroit Opera has become a top tastemaker in the rapidly changing opera world.\n\nEthan Davidson, board chair for Detroit Opera, referenced some of the company’s recent successes while praising Brown’s work.\n\n“Under Wayne’s leadership, Detroit Opera has become one of the nation’s most vibrant nonprofit organizations,” said Davidson, “telling stories that resonate with the Detroit community, from ‘Twilight: Gods’ to ‘X: The Life and Times of Malcolm X,’ ‘The Passenger,’ ‘Fountain of Tears,’ and more. This has been an extraordinary era for opera in Detroit, thanks in large part to Wayne’s contributions.”\n\nIn his youth, Wayne Stanley Brown was a newspaper carrier for the Detroit News. He ran his route so efficiently that he was soon offered an additional route. The enterprising Brown would eventually pay someone else to operate his second route.\n\n“The whole notion was to keep the options going,” he recalled with a laugh.\n\nAnd options were plenty. Young Brown was extremely active in the community, with involvement in Junior Achievement, the Boy Scouts, school choir and at his church, St. Paul AME. He also studied violin and cello.\n\nLater, at the University of Michigan, he joined that school’s glee club as well, serving in multiple roles at different points including business manager, assistant conductor, vice president, and president. This impressed Allen Britton, dean of the School of Music, who invited Brown to manage the university’s summer opera program. He then managed the School of Music’s annual fundraiser and turned a good profit.\n\n“I was really getting curious about the whole nature of how to make these kinds of productions and businesses work,” said Brown, who received an honorary doctorate in music Thursday from the Manhattan School of Music, along with violinist Bing Wang and jazz legend Herbie Hancock. “My interest, therefore, in the art form was triggered in terms of not only what happens on the stage, but what’s required to make any given event happen.”\n\nAs a result of Brown's success, Britton recommended him to the then-executive director of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, where Brown would serve as administrative assistant for two years, then as assistant manager. In 1979, he helped co-found Classical Roots, one of the symphony’s first community engagement initiatives, which showcases music by African American composers and musicians and has gone on to be a major part of the DSO’s annual programming. The Classical Roots model developed in Detroit is now used in cities across the country.\n\nMusic, love and marriage\n\nAt U-M, Brown met pianist Brenda Kee. The two fell in love.\n\n“I had just completed my bachelor’s degree at U-M,” Brown said, “and she was a doctoral student moving to Ann Arbor. And I knew that she would be joining the school music network. She was practicing one day, and I happened to know which practice room she was in. She was focusing her attention, so I waited for a pause, knocked on the door, and said: ‘Hello, I’m Wayne Brown. Welcome to campus. What are you doing on Friday night?’”\n\nThat Friday night dinner, years later, would lead to their marriage in Springfield, Massachusetts, where the young couple worked and took full advantage of their proximity to the great arts scenes of Tanglewood, Boston and New York.\n\nWhen they married, Kee retained her surname.\n\n“I frequently respond to the query ‘Are you Mr. Kee?’ with ‘Yes, I am,” said Brown.\n\nBrown was serving as executive director of the Springfield Symphony Orchestra and would go on to do the same with the Louisville Orchestra in Kentucky, where he led a $10 million endowment campaign, established a significant regional touring program and produced two international music festivals featuring composers and performers from 14 countries.\n\nAlongside his symphony leaderships, Brown was also a founding member of the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation’s Magic in Music Advisory Committee and served on advisory boards for the Mellon and Ford foundations, as vice chairman of Opera America and the League of American Orchestras, and as a member of the American Arts Alliance Board.\n\nIn 1996, Brown served as producer of music programs for the Cultural Olympiad in Atlanta, where he managed music events held in association with the 1996 Olympic Games. The following year, he became director of music and opera for the National Endowment for the Arts. In that role, he managed NEA grants and directed the NEA Jazz Masters Fellowships, the nation’s highest honor in jazz.\n\nBrown was named president and CEO of Michigan Opera Theatre in 2014 when company founder David DiChiera stepped down to the role of artistic director. DiChiera and Brown had known each other since Brown’s work with the DSO in the 1970s, and the two worked closely together to guide the opera through a smooth transition until DiChiera’s 2017 retirement. DiChiera died the following year.\n\n“My father felt he was handing over the reins of the company he spent his life building to the most qualified person,” said Lisa DiChiera, DiChiera's daughter. “The fact that Wayne was a native Detroiter with deep connections to the city and region was an added bonus.”\n\nDetroit Opera music director Roberto Kalb seconded her praise.\n\n“Under Wayne Brown’s leadership, Detroit Opera has embraced a relevant, progressive and creative future while still honoring David DiChiera’s original vision for the company. Wayne has led with thoughtfulness, vision and compassion through one of the toughest periods in art history.”\n\nA career-changing challenge\n\nNo one in or out of the art world was prepared for what March 2020 would deliver. Organizations around the world scrambled to adjust their offerings and profit opportunities as the COVID-19 pandemic arrived. Other opera companies closed their doors temporarily or altogether, but under Brown, Detroit Opera pivoted by breaking through the walls of tradition and ushering in a new era not only for the outfit but also for the art form.\n\nBrown guided his charge through the pandemic with a gentle smile and a steady hand, securing record-breaking financial grants and gifts, taking advantage of the shutdown with renovations to the historic Detroit Opera House and, most notably, recruiting MacArthur “Genius” Fellow Yuval Sharon to take on the artistic director position once held by founder DiChiera.\n\nBeginning with the genre-busting “Twilight: Gods” — a revelatory, magical revamp of Wagner’s “Götterdämmerung” staged in the Opera House parking garage that drew international headlines and saw guests arrive in tuxes and evening gowns for an experience where they never left their cars — Brown and Sharon threw out a lightning bolt that announced opera in Detroit would never be the same. The pandemic had become culture’s ultimate villain, cutting humans off from the art that sustained them. Their postmodern, drive-through take on Wagner struck a tremendous blow for creativity in a time of death and despair.\n\nBut the adventure didn’t stop there. As the pandemic rolled on, innovative, outdoor productions continued until it was safe to gather crowds indoors again. 2022 brought a name change, from Michigan Opera Theatre to Detroit Opera because Brown wanted pride in the city reflected in its moniker. Many wondered whether the same magic could be recaptured within the four walls of the opera house, but leadership continued to reach for the skies and produce thoughtful, sometimes even radical works that led the New York Times to ask: “Is the future of American opera unfolding in Detroit?”\n\nMore: Michigan Opera Theatre drives into the pandemic era with a fresh take on a classic\n\nMore: Spectacular Spanish-language 'Fountain of Tears' is Detroit Opera's best production in years\n\nMore: Michigan Opera Theatre changing its name to Detroit Opera under rebranding\n\n“Wayne recognized that our art form and our company needs to evolve, and in the middle of a pandemic, he methodically built a new artistic team at Detroit Opera to do just that,” said Sharon. “Centering this city in the name of the organization — taking pride in our company being in and of the city of Detroit — was only possible due to Wayne’s ability to build consensus around a common vision. It has been an honor to have Wayne’s trust and encouragement in bringing new voices to the table and bringing new audiences to opera.”\n\nAssociate artistic director Christine Goerke, also hired during this period, added: “Wayne … reimagined and assembled an entirely new artistic team during incredibly challenging times. He is one of the kindest colleagues in this business, always there to listen and welcome ideas. He will be sorely missed as the heart of Detroit Opera.”\n\nThe company's 2022-23 opera season wrapped in April with the searing \"Ainadamar (Fountain of Tears).\" Puccini's legendary \"Madame Butterfly\" will open the 2023-24 season, Brown's last, in October.\n\nFamously reticent to discuss his achievements across a five-decade career, Brown speaks about his years at the opera in terms of “we” instead of “I,” and deflects the accolades back onto his team.\n\n“I think, as an organization, we have managed to raise the profile of the company and its work,” he said. “I’m proud of the artistic leadership team that we are fortunate to benefit from. Yuval Sharon, Christine Goerke, Roberto Kalb…I’m pleased to say that they all individually are in high demand, and we’re very fortunate to have that team in place. I’m encouraged by the number of longstanding supporters and subscribers who’ve played a key role in our governance. Our previous board chair was in that role for 17 years — kind of unprecedented, not typical for a significant arts organization — and our current chair, Ethan Davidson, has been phenomenal.\n\n“It’s that community of artists, volunteers, audiences, staff, that have made a difference here in Detroit, keeping David DiChiera’s aspiration for opera and Detroit to be highly visible, be relevant, and to be fully engaged. So may we have the opportunity as an organization to continue that work ... because it’s not about us; it’s about the art form. It’s about the community.”\n\nContact Free Press arts and culture reporter Duante Beddingfield at dbeddingfield@freepress.com."
