        "text": "This site attempts to reconstruct a family tree of early British Colonial Settlers [pre 1776] of Southern Maryland and Virginia's Northern Neck Counties along the Potomac and Rappahannock River Valleys and is a work in progress.\n\nI use Family Tree Maker where 99.99% of the relationships in my file have biological parents. When I export from Family Tree Maker to a GED file for importing and updating the TNG Web database structure, the relationships are changed from \"biological\" to \"natural\". This is an issue with how the GED version 5.5 specification handles exported data and not with Family Tree Maker.\n\nUses published works by: Jane B. Cotton, Marleen Strawser Bates, F.
