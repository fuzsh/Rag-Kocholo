She was very knowledgeable every step of the way, and handled the inevitable bumps in the road with skill. My place sold quickly at the right price in a changing market, thanks to Sharon's hard work and experience. I can't recommend her highly enough!\" - Kim Binsted\n\n★★★★★\n\n\"Sharon has been great to work with in the sale of our Alii Drive condo. She has been patient and professional and answered our questions as well as doing a great job in keeping us informed throughout the sale process. Her knowledge and experience in the Kona area market was evident & greatly appreciated. We would highly recommend her as a realtor.\" - Tom Tatum\n\n★★★★★\n\n\"Sharon bent over backwards to help us purchase our new home! She truly cares about helping people make their dreams come true and works very hard to make it happen. We had very specific needs and she found the perfect property for us. She patiently guided us through a complicated process from beginning to end. I would definitely use her again!\" - Laura Nelson\n\n★★★★★\n\n\"Sharon really listened to us in determining what our search was for and surprised us by finding it in a much shorter timeframe than expected. She was so easy to work with and very knowledgeable about the Big Island. I would greatly recommend her as a realtor.\" - Sheila Goodwin\n\n★★★★★\n\n\"We worked with Sharon to both buy and sell our house in Keauhou Estates. Sharon has been great to work with. While our relationship with Sharon started as a realtor, through her advice and guidance over the years Sharon has also become a friend. We would happily recommend Sharon as a realtor.\" -Damir Tanovic\n\n★★★★★\n\n\"Sharon Brown is one of the few people who exhibit excellence in everything she does. I have worked with Sharon in both home sales and large land purchases and she is very patient in the negotiation process, as well as being thorough. She thinks of everything and I am grateful for that because these are multi-million dollar deals that require a person who is sharp to oversee them. In addition to that Sharon is always the cool head in the room when it comes to negotiation. She is kind and totally professional so we have managed to manifest my dreams. It has been a privilege to work with Sharon. Anyone who has the opportunity to work with her will be uplifted and fully taken care of. I have referred her to friends and they say the same thing. There is no one else I know who rises to her standards of excellence.\" - Jill Wagner\n\n★★★★★\n\n\"We were so happy to find Sharon! She was very thorough while helping us find and purchase our dream home. She is extremely knowledgeable about the area. Sharon went above and beyond to help us handle the transfer of ownership by giving us information on excellent local service providers and even meeting with them when we were not available. She was very attentive in following up with us on every aspect of the purchase, even 2 months later. We would highly recommend Sharon!!\" - Shelly Ho\n\n★★★★★\n\n\"We have had Sharon as our realtor many times over the past dozen or so years and I would never consider anyone else. Sharon went above and beyond as our Real Estate person in our last transaction. She is very communicative and keeps the contractual timeline moving along. She spent a tremendous amount of time showing us houses and condos until we found the one that was a perfect fit. She always had a positive attitude even on the days I was not sure we were going to find our home here in Kona on our time schedule. Once we found our property, she interacted with our loan broker, the inspector, the title company, the seller's agent, and numerous other individuals. She always found answers for our questions on a timely manner. I highly recommend Sharon if you are looking for that A+ realtor for your next purchase or sale. Mahalo Sharon for all of your hard work and efforts.\" - Toni and Palmer Vaughn\n\n★★★★★\n\n\"Sharon Brown is the best. There is no one who could be more quickly responsive, upbeat, steadfast, patient and professional than Sharon. She has changed my life. She worked 200% for me and I am eternally grateful for having her as my agent. Buying and selling property are the largest purchases in most people's lives. Sharon can manage transactions and negotiate the entire process with the highest skill. This takes a lot of stress out for the buyer and seller. I have bought and sold with Sharon.\" - Jill Wagner\n\n★★★★★\n\n\"Sharon listened to what we were looking for and only showed us what we had outlined for amenities and price. The whole process was comfortable and enjoyable. We found exactly what we needed and within our price goals.\" - Jim Spear\n\n★★★★★\n\n\"Very professional. Easiest real estate transaction I have ever had. She was on top of everything. We really appreciate everything she did for us. She kept on top of everything and let us know every day how things were going.\" - Karen and Jim Conlay\n\n★★★★★\n\n\"It was a true pleasure working with Sharon. She was totally knowledgeable of real estate on the Big Island. She took us to a number of properties exactly what we were interested in. She was extremely helpful in finalizing our purchase, and extremely helpful in assisting our efforts for financing. There was never any pressure put on us from her and we appreciated that.\" - Dave and Mary Jean R."
