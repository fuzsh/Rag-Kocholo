Sarah Kirsch Biography

Sarah Kirsch was a German poet. She was born Ingrid Bernstein in Limlingerode, Prussian Saxony. She changed her first name to Sarah in order to protest against her father's anti-semitism. She studied biology in Halle and literature at the Johannes R. Becher Institute for Literature in Leipzig. In 1965, she married the writer Rainer Kirsch. She protested against East Germany's expulsion of Wolf Biermann in 1976, which led to her exclusion from the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED). One year later she left the country herself, nevertheless being critical of the west as well. She is mainly known for her poetry, but she also wrote prose and has translated children's books into German. According to complete review, "the great German-language post-war poets were largely East German (or Austrian) born in the mid to late 1930s which included towering figures such as Volker Braun, Heinz Czechowski" and Sarah Kirsch who was "the most prominent female representative of that generation." She won many prizes and honors including the German international literary Petrarca-Preis in 1976, the Peter-Huchel Prize in 1993 and the Georg BÃ¼chner Prize in 1996. Kirsch died in May 2013 following a brief but serious illness.)

The Best Poem Of Sarah Kirsch

Breath Pause

The sky is smoke grey ash grey mouse grey

lead grey stone grey in the land

of sudden showers of continuous thunder

the bloated meadows the gardens

rotting and dogs during the night

have grown fins they dive

after every silver spoon that

falls from the window when instantly

portly marmalades are being made

in kitchens flown through in fine weather

by farmers' wives with hay in their pants

steam in their bums on turnip fields at noon.
