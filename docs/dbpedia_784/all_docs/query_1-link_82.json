        "text": "ISBN:978-1859731321\n\nSince German unification, there have been many reports about xenophobia in Germany and the government has attempted to stem the new wave of racism. In contrast, the voices of the victims of racism — refugees, asylum seekers, immigrants — are seldom heard.\n\nThis first anthology of essays by significant writers from minority groups in Germany — Turks, Afro-Germans, German Jews, Eastern Europeans and others — sheds new light on the diverse experiences of minority groups living in Germany today. It also introduces to English-speaking audiences innovative literary talents whose contribution to German culture has not yet received the attention it deserves.\n\nStudents of contemporary German culture who wish to increase their understanding of the changing nature of German society will find this book invaluable. It will also be of interest to anyone following the rise of xenophobia in Germany, its possible causes, and the changing politics of immigration.\n\n“A kaleidoscopic picture builds up, not just of racism, but of resistance as well. Again and again, the stereotypes of Germany and the Germans are broken down. This is a well constructed selection. The translators and editors have carried out a valuable service making these writings available to an English speaking public.” — Socialist Review\n\n“An eye-opener . . . The editors and translators have made an enormous contribution to German and European Studies.” — World Literature Today\n\n“Fringe Voices is a spirited contribution to the contemporary debate about immigration and citizenship rights.” — German Politics"
