        "text": "In recent years, the question of ‘minor-ness’ has been widely debated in the field of Translation Studies. After the acknowledgment of the paramount role of translation in establishing, sustaining and rebalancing relations of power, translation practices have been examined from different angles thus contributing to post-modern criticism of gender-related prejudices (Godard 1984) (von Flotow 1991) (Simon 1996), Eurocentric biases or hegemonic traditions (Cheyfitz 1991) (Niranjana 1992) (Bassnett and Trivedi 1999). However, despite recent efforts to broaden the spectre of theoretical approaches to translation in order to overcome traditional Eurocentrism and to avoid an excessive Westernization of the field, Translation Studies still seem to gravitate towards approaches build around ‘Western’ concepts, like Derridean deconstruction and différance (Arrojo 1992). At the same time, the paradigms originating outside of the theoretical mainstream of Western Translation Studies, such as those developed in Russia under Soviet rule, still face exclusion and fall into the gap between the West and the Rest (Hall 1996). In our presentation, we propose to explore the Theory of Realistic Translation developed in the Soviet Union the early 1950s as an attempt to incorporate the official Soviet ideology into literary translation theory (Kashkin 1953,1954). Unimaginable outside the cultural doctrine of Socialist Realism, the Theory of Realistic Translation was soon defeated by the linguistic approach (Fedorov 1953) which, with personal support of Stalin, became the official theoretical framework for Soviet translation. Resulting from the defeat of “Realist” translation was the fact that almost all literary translation practices in the Soviet Union were pushed to the periphery of the Soviet literary system. In our presentation, we will examine these ‘minor’ translation practices, which in the context of the post-Stalinist Soviet State were almost equal to political dissidence.\n\nThis essentially academic book and its author are daring companions of poetry translators in their dance on a rope while searching for the best solutions and shifting boundaries between the possible and impossible, and the insights have at least three main directions: first, the artistic and aesthetic nature of the activity, second, those specific skills which are necessary to complete the task, and, third, the pre-requisites of failure or acclaim. The artistic and complex nature of both poetry and its translation suggests the necessity of specific inclusive approaches though, whatever the technique, there always remain some blurred, inaccessible zones of inexplicable elements. The book aims at studying the linguistic aspects of poetry translation theories and practice in order to define the main theoretical principles of an integrated approach to poetry translation. Practical insights are based on an analysis of the translation of Joseph Brodsky’s poems into English and Latvian. While under way, we experience all the cause-effect aspects of poetic texts representing author’s intention both to express and to hide, to intensify/highlight and to disguise. At times, we really feel – similarly to poetry translators themselves – like investigators either in the complex networks of theoretical insights or in even more risky endeavours to discuss and outline the practical aspects of poetry translation. A balance of theoretical and practical aspects is one of the main features and main benefits of the study. A detailed analysis of Brodsky’s poetic and philosophical heritage is another contribution. A unique opportunity for the international audience to gain insights into the Western/Russian/Latvian approaches to poetry translation theories and practices by also observing their mutual impacts and interaction, provides more added value.\n\nThe Bilingual Muse analyzes the work of seven Russian poets who translated their own poems into English, French, German, or Italian. Investigating the parallel versions of self-translated poetic texts by Vladimir Nabokov, Joseph Brodsky, Andrey Gritsman, Katia Kapovich, Marina Tsvetaeva, Wassily Kandinsky, and Elizaveta Kul’man, Adrian Wanner considers how verbal creativity functions in different languages, the conundrum of translation, and the vagaries of bilingual identities. Wanner argues that the perceived marginality of self-translation stems from a romantic privileging of the mother tongue and the original text. The unprecedented recent dispersion of Russian speakers over three continents has led to the emergence of a new generation of diasporic Russians who provide a more receptive milieu for multilingual creativity. The book will be of interest to scholars in Russian literature, comparative literature, applied linguistics, translation studies, and the rapidly developing field of self-translation studies.\n\nThe article is dedicated to problems of the Russian literature translation into the English language, and, in particular, to the question of differences both in the content and forms transferring, which are caused by asymmetry within cross-cultural and cross-lingual communication. The author considers the reasons for loss of information which possesses special features of a fiction text, and in particular, of its esthetic, evaluational, emotive and expressive components. The difference between the Russian and English poetic traditions which in many cases explains the nature of transformation in translations of the 20th century is analyzed: when rhythmic and metric canon, sound imaginary, rhyme and other methods for the organization of artistic information in the poem are considered as something secondary, then the translated text seems to be a reproduction of lexis, i.e., in fact, poems are translated through prose or reconstructed with changes in original means of expression.
