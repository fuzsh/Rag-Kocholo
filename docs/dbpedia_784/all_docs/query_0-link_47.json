        "text": "Considered by many to be the father of German lieder, Franz Schubert was one of the most prolific of all German art song composers. His three published song cycles traverse the full spectrum of human emotion from hope to despair, obsession to anguish, life to death, and unrequited love. Known as one of todayâ€™s foremost interpreters of German art songs, the esteemed baritone Benjamin Appl makes his North American recital debut with a unique residency exploring the extraordinary emotional depths of the human psyche found in these cornerstones of the genre."
