We will read from plays and poetry written during the periods of \"Storm and Stress\" and \"Weimar Classicism\" in the 1770s to early 1800s, and learn about how European art and intellectual & political history at that time shaped these German writers: popular French and English literature, a renaissance of Greco-Roman antiquity in visual art and architecture, the beginnings of a political push for democracy and an independent nation-state, and the efforts to translate an Enlightened, universal appreciation of the individual into social justice.\n\nLanguage of instruction: German\n\nPrerequisite: GER 022, or consent of instructor\n\nGE credit: AH, WC, WE\n\nGER 143: Language and the Media\n\nProfessor Carlee Arnett\n\nMWF from 12:10-1:00pm\n\nThis course will focus on the various types of media in the German-speaking world.

We will address such questions as who makes films and what are they trying to show about Germany. What role to contemporary writers play on talk shows structuring discourse about current political events or societal concerns? What social critique is made in television programs and who controls the programming? Why has radio fallen out of favor or who is listening and to what? What role in society do blogs, cabaret, hip-hop and other creative expressions play and what is their media outlet?\n\nThe course will be taught in German.\n\nPrerequisite: German 22, placement test or permission of instructor\n\nTextbook: Course reader\n\nGraduate Courses\n\nGER 297: Special Topics in German Literature, Graduate Film Studies: The Case of Cinema in Germany\n\nJaimey Fisher- Tuesdays 1:10-4:00"
