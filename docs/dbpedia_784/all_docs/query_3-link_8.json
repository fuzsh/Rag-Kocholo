        "text": "A sad day today, as we see the passing punk rock musician, Sarah Kirsch. Born Mike Kirsch, Sarah was hugely involved with the Bay Area scene, as well as underground scene at large. She was a member of many bands including, but not limited to, The Skinflutes, Fuel (the emo-core band from the early 90â€™s), Torches to Rome, Bread and Circuits, Baader Brains, and Pinhead Gunpowder (of which she was a founding member but left due to conflicts with Billie Joe Armstrong after Green Day signed to a major label).\n\nUnfortunately not too long ago, Kirsch was diagnosed with Fanconi anemia, a rare genetic disorder that causes leukemia and other cancers. No official statement has been released regarding her passing as of this writing."
