        "text": "Abstract\n\nComparative analyses of poetry by the German Sarah Kirsch, the Emirati Ahmed Rashid Thani, and the St Lucian Derek Walcott identify three distinct ecopoetic elements their work has in common. The three poets, born before the origin of ecocriticism, favour metaphors that represent natural landscapes. These metaphors express a certain “nature-centrism,” and explicit references to environmental threats provoke approaches informed by ecocriticism to the oeuvres of all three poets alike. While the analyses highlight stylistic and culture-related differences, they manifest the urgency of an awareness for the global in the context of sustainability.\n\nHambuch, Doris. \"Ecopoetic Elements in the Work of Sarah Kirsch, Ahmed Rashid Thani, and Derek Walcott\".
