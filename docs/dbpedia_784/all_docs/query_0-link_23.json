Since then, boundary conditions have changed. International energy markets are characterized by growing demand and rising energy prices. This has influenced Germany as well. Further, sustainable power supply and global climate change have become relevant issues during the past few years. Against this background, Sachsen-Anhalt intends to modify its energy concept. The first step will be the provision of a current information and data base on all aspects of world, national and state energy supply and all relevant boundary conditions. The 'Energiestudie 2007' was prepared by Institut fuer Energetik und Umwelt gGmbH. The contents are based on current studies and investigations. The 'Energiestudie' will provide an information base which may be maintained and updated by actors of Sachsen-Anhalt.

Situation, focal areas, examples; Energiebericht Schleswig-Holstein 1995. Situation, Schwerpunkte, Beispiele\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nNONE\n\n1995-09-01\n\nSince 1988 the Land of Schleswig Holstein has been going new ways in its energy policy. Its declared aims are energy saving in heat and electricity supply, efficient energy utilisation, a greater utilisation of renewable energy resources, and, of principal importance, the phase-out of nuclear energy. As the legislative competence of the Laender is very restricted in matters relating to energy, the new policy has primarily been designed as a means of demonstrating by way of example that there actually are considerable potentials for saving energy and that they can be exploited. The present report gives an overview of the results of Schleswig Holstein`s energy policy of the last seven years. (orig./RHM) [Deutsch] Seit 1988 geht das Land Schleswig-Holstein energiepolitisch neue Wege. Das erklaerte Ziel: Energieeinsparung im Waerme- und Strombereich, rationelle Energieverwendung, staerkere Nutzung erneuerbarer Energien. Und grundsaetzlich: Ausstieg aus der Kernenergie. Da die Bundeslaender nur ueber eine sehr eingeschraenkte Gesetzgebungskompetenz im Energiebereich verfuegen, zielte die neue Energiepolitik zunaechst darauf ab, durch Foerderprogramme beispielhaft zu zeigen, dass tatsaechlich erhebliche Einsparpotentiale bestehen und auch umsetzbar sind. Der Bericht gibt einen Ueberblick ueber die Ergebnisse der Energiepolitik der letzten sieben Jahre in Schleswig-Holstein. (orig./RHM)\n\n1991 measurement report. Air pollution monitoring in Schleswig-Holstein\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\n1992-01-01\n\nThis article provides a report of the immission situation for 1991 in Schleswig-Holstein on the basis of the continuously processing measuring stations of the Air Hygienic Monitoring Schleswig-Holstein and the special measuring programs at selected sites. The measuring results of the Air Hygienic Monitoring determined for Schleswig-Holstein in 1991 can be summarized as follows: - The basic load of air by pollutants such as sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ), nitrogen monoxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) and airborne particles in relatively small in the entires region of the nation; Schleswig-Holstein is, therefore, continues to be ranked as one of the regions in the Federal Republic of Germany least burden to air contaminates. - A slight increase compared to the previous year could be determined for the components of sulphur dioxide and airborne particles. - The limit values defined by the European Community (EG) were adhered to at the time of the report; the admittance values for SO 2 and NO 2 were, however, exceeded.

Due to the fact that large regions of the Land are situated in strong breeze zones, wind power plays the most important role. Almost 50% of the overall German wind current is gained in Schleswig-Holstein. Furthermore solar energy and water power are also used directly. (orig.)

As an example case study, the December 2014 flood in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, was investigated. Atmospheric conditions at the onset of the flood event are described and evaluated with respect to the general weather circulation, initial wetness, and event precipitation. Persistent, predominantly westerly general weather circulations (GWCs) directed several low-pressure systems over the North Sea to Schleswig-Holstein during December 2014, accompanied by prolonged rainfall and finally a strong precipitation event in southern Schleswig-Holstein, causing several inland gauges to exceed their, by then maximum, water levels. Results show that the antecedent precipitation index (API) is able to reflect the soil moisture conditions and, in combination with the maximum 3-day precipitation sum (R3d), to capture the two main drivers finally leading to the flood: (1) the initial wetness of north-western Schleswig-Holstein and (2) strong event precipitation in southern and eastern Schleswig-Holstein from 21 to 23 December; at the same time, both indices exceeded their respective 5-year return periods. Further, trend analyses show that both API and R3d have been increasing during recent years, while regional patterns match the north-eastward shift of cyclone pathways, leading to a higher risk of flooding in Schleswig-Holstein. Within the network of experts, investigations of these and further indices/drivers for earth system changes (e.g. wind surge and sea level rise) derived from observations, reanalyses, and regional climate model data are planned for all German coastal areas. Results can be expected to lead to improved adaptation measures to floods\n\nThe energy-political programmes of the parties in the State Parliament of Sachsen-Anhalt prior to the State election\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGrupe, H.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nThis is the first in a series of articles taking a close look at the essential statements in the energy and environmental policy programmes of the politically relevant parties and comparing them with one another.

A detailed analysis of mortality time trends in Schleswig-Holstein and Germany.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nStang, Andreas; JÃ¶ckel, Karl-Heinz\n\n2016-02-01\n\nAfter a pilot study on skin cancer screening was performed between 2003 and 2004 in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, the country implemented what to the authors' knowledge is the first nationwide skin cancer screening program in the world in 2008. The objective of the current study was to provide details regarding mortality trends in Schleswig-Holstein and Germany in relation to the screening. Annual age-standardized mortality rates for skin melanoma (using the 10th Revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems [ICD-10] code C43) and malignant neoplasms of ill-defined, secondary, and unspecified sites (ICD-10 code C76-C80) were analyzed. The European Standard population was used for age standardization. A bias analysis was performed to estimate the number of skin melanoma deaths that may have been incorrectly counted as ICD-10 code C76-C80 when the skin melanoma mortality declined in Schleswig-Holstein. The observed mortality decline in Schleswig-Holstein 5 years after the pilot study was accompanied by a considerable increase in the number of deaths due to malignant neoplasms of ill-defined, secondary, and unspecified sites (ICD-10 code C76-C80) that is not explainable by an increase in the incidence of these neoplasms. Incorrect assignment of 8 to 35 and 12 to 23 skin melanoma deaths per year among men and women, respectively, as ICD-10 code C76-C80 during 2007 through 2010 could explain the transient skin melanoma mortality decline observed in Schleswig-Holstein. Five years after implementation of the program, the nationwide skin melanoma mortality increased (age-standardized rate change of +0.4 per 100,000 person-years [95% confidence interval, 0.2-0.6] in men and +0.1 per 100,000 person-years [95% confidence interval, -0.1 to 0.2] in women). Although the current analyses raise doubts that the skin cancer screening program in Germany can reduce the skin cancer mortality rate, the authors do not believe the program\n\nEnergy crops for biogas plants.

Rather, they are intended to mark the energy-political frame of action within which the government of the Land will more. At the same time their purpose is to provide a medium-term orientation for politics and the power economy, consumers and producers. They are thus consciously made to contrast with political trends conceiving energy policy first of all as a plan-dependent activity. With these guiding principles the government of the Land consistantly continues an energy policy it has exposed in detail in its answer to the Question submitted by the CDU parliamentary party on December 8, 1980.

Part B investigates the technical feasibility of an immediate, complete reactor shut-down in Schleswig-Holstein (in 1987). Part C deals with the framework conditions of a nuclear power shut-off and with accompanying measures on the energy market. According to the order, the main goal of the study was to prove that a nuclear power shut-off is technically feasible. So this study presents assessments with a view to technical feasibility, legal scope of action, costs, ecological effects, and alternative strategies for efficient energy policy on the Land level. This relatively restricted framework, considering exclusively the possibilities of the Land Schleswig-Holstein, necessarily brings about a reduction of the scope of action or optimisation. It is therefore recommended to have an analysis prepared that considers the country as a whole, in order to enhance perspectives and the scope of action. The study does not deal with aspects such as political acceptability and feasibility, or concrete legal processes or procedural steps that would have to be taken in case of backing out and making the turn in energy. The study to a great part relies on assumptions and framework conditions defined in another study by the authors Mueller-Reissmann and Schaffner, entitled 'Power generation without nuclear energy - consequences of backing out of nuclear power'. A brief summary of this study is given in the appendix to the study in hand. (orig./UA) [de\n\nWeser river water quality report 2002. Flussgebietsgemeinschaft Weser; Flussgebietsgemeinschaft Weser.

[Landesamt fuer soziale Dienste, Kiel (Germany). Dezernat Umweltbezogener Gesundheitsschutz\n\n2015-07-01\n\nIn this study the drinking water of 212 small-scale water supplies, mainly situated in areas with intensive agriculture or fruit-growing, was analysed for uranium. The median uranium concentration amounted to 0.04 Î¼g/lL, the 95th percentile was 2.5 Î¼g/L. The maximum level was 14 Î¼g/L. This sample exceeded the guideline value for uranium in drinking water. The uranium concentration in small-scale water supplies was found to be slightly higher than that in central water works in Schleswig-Holstein. Water containing more than 10 mg/L nitrate showed significantly higher uranium contents. The results indicate that the uranium burden in drinking water from small wells is mainly determined by geological factors. An additional anthropogenic effect of soil management cannot be excluded. Overall uranium concentrations were low and not causing health concerns. However, in specific cases higher concentrations may occur.\n\nGerman Grocery Discounters: Dynamics and Regional Impact. the Case of Schleswig-Holstein (Germany\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJÃ¼rgens Ulrich\n\n2014-12-01\n\nFull Text Available Grocery discount stores have long dominated developments in the German food retail sector, and they continue to grow.

The present documentation contains standardised reports on environmental medical case histories and their course of development. 916 documentation sheets and 508 environmental medical progress sheets were included in the evaluation. In 36% of cases a causal connection between patients' symptoms and their exposure to a noxious substance was found to be ''probable'' on the strength of the available exposure data and/or information on patients' course of development. 27% of patients' case histories were found to amount to a ''clear suspicion'' of their health complaints being attributable to environmental influences. In 13% of documented cases the existence of a causal connection was found to be ''uncertain''. In 15% of documented cases there was an allergy or hypersensitivity to agents relevant to environmental medicine. In 10% of cases the medical examination either led to a diagnosis attributing the complaints in question to other than environmental causes or gave no indication of a relevant exposure to noxious substances. In each case the patient's age, sex, symptoms as well as presumed or proven exposure factors and the course of development following remediation measures or the end of exposure were documented and evaluated both generally and specifically to the type of exposure in question. The most frequently documented exposure factors of relevance to environmental medicine were biocides (32%), fungus (27%), amalgam (22%), solvents (21%), formaldehyde (16%). In 52% of the total of the 508 patients whose course of development was documented the diagnostic assumption of an environmental cause was confirmed completely in the further course of development while in 23% of cases it was only partially confirmed.

This leads to the location and year-specific optimised control of the pathogen and of the associated yield performance. After several years of development in Bavaria (from 1985 on) and Schleswig-Holstein (1993-1999), the model was tested as part of a project involving the Universities of Bonn and Kiel and the plant protection services of the German states of Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia and Schleswig-Holstein in a three-year study (1999-2001) in interregional locations (usually nine per state) with the winter wheat variety Ritmo (interregional indicator variety) and a further variety of regional importance in different variations (untreated control, three to four times growth stage-oriented variants for the determination of the absolute damage potential, IPM-variant). In exact records (approx. 12 dates per vegetation period), the disease epidemics were recorded weekly. With the genetically uniform indicator variety Ritmo, the results documented substantially differing year- and location-specific disease and yield patterns.

The aim of the research work was to develop a methodical concept which includes proposals for an alternate design of shore lines considering the qualities demanded by species of flora and fauna. One of the most important issues is the use of engineer-biology rather than technical methods to stabilise and design the slopes. Soil, vegetation and species of different sections of six mining lakes were therefore analysed. Certain species of animal were selected in order to plan a current recultivation project on the island called Baerenhofinsel, part of the Goitzsche (Bitterfeld/Sachsen-Anhalt). A design concept to create conditions needed by these aim species was developed and also partly realised. Unfortunately the project could not be finished completely as there was non-predictable delay in the flooding regime. Nevertheless it is an important base for the future revitalisation process of former mining areas. (orig.)

Diabetes prevalence was already analyzed in multiple complex studies. The goal of this analysis was the determination of the regional drug treatment prevalence and medication of diabetes mellitus in Germany. Simultaneously, we examined and validated the applicability of prescription data of the German statutory health insurance (SHI) as the basis for reliable and comparable prevalence estimations. For the analysis, we used anonymized data from a prescription database as well as the member statistics of the German federal Ministry of Health. By using defined prescription profiles with anti-diabetic medication, we determined the diabetic patients and treatment schemes per Association of SHI Physicians. Subsequently, we calculated and described the drug treatment prevalence and medication. A differentiation between type 1 and type 2 diabetes was not possible. The total prevalence of drug-treated patients in Germany was 7.77%. The regional values ranged from 6.40% in Schleswig-Holstein until 11.37% in Saxony-Anhalt. The highest numbers of drug treatment prevalence were found in the East of Germany. Insulin treatment was frequent in Hamburg, but rare in Bavaria. Insulin combined with oral anti-diabetic medication was mainly dispensed in Saxony-Anhalt and Brandenburg, least in Hamburg. A treatment with one or more oral anti-diabetics was most common in Bavaria and Bremen, lowest in Rhineland-Palatinate and Mecklenburg-West Pomerania. We developed an easy to use evaluation algorithm for prescription data to estimate the drug treatment prevalence of a chronic disease. The estimated prevalence confirms the increasing trend reported from other studies and appears to be plausible in comparison. More research is required to validate and enhance the method.

[GeoForschungsZentrum Potsdam (Germany)\n\n2008-10-23\n\nCoupled fluid flow, heat and mass transport (i.e. thermohaline flow) simulations have been carried out in order to study the interactions between shallow and deep brine flow in an aquifer system which includes a salt dome close to the surface. Particular attention has been given to the role of young processes (i.e., faults, Quaternary channels, and shallow salt structures) in affecting groundwater flow at basin scale. The results show that beside topography-driven flow, different convective regimes play a role for extensive solute exchange between shallow and deep aquifers. Particularly, heavy brines sink from the shallow salt dome crest into deeper aquifers. Furthermore, the young basin features strongly control discharge and recharge processes. At this state, the issues to be solved are the role of a transition zone along the salt flank, the effects of variable fluid viscosity in affecting the system dynamics and the impact of anthropogenic activities such as pumping stations on brine migration and heat transport. So far, viscosity effects are well described for rising hot plumes, while their influence on sinking brines are not studied yet. With regard to anthropogenic impact, pumping groundwater in saline environment can provide severe problems. For instance, brines up-coning can disturb wells and pollute the freshwater resources. Although the presented studies focus on the Schleswig-Holstein region (Germany), the results are of great interest for many sedimentary basins in which the described features are commonly encountered. Investigations concerning the potential impact of anthropogenic activities on the dynamics of deep and shallow groundwater processes will provide additional knowledge concerning key factors controlling the formation and evolution of saline waters within basins. At the same time, this research has an important practical use for water resource management.

Stephen Briggs\n\n2005-11-01\n\nFull Text Available Between 1789 and 1815 Europe was devastated by a series of intermittent Wars waged by the French. The first part came about through the French Revolution, the second, the Napoleonic Wars, were about Bonaparteâs thirst for conquest. Almost at the end of them, Denmarkâs attempted neutrality was to cost her the loss of Norway by cessation to Sweden under the Treaty of Kiel in 1814. The Norwegians felt particularly aggrieved by this, a ploy on the part of the British to disarm the Scandinavians and retain British Naval access to the Baltic. Thus began a half a century of particular national insecurity for Denmark, during which she felt under constant threat from German ambition through an increasingly powerful, predatory Prussia. Schleswig-Holstein was particularly at risk of annexation, because though much of Slesvig was culturally and ethnically Danish, southern Jutland had been strongly infiltrated by German influences unchecked for many decades (Sandiford 1975: 21. With a small population (2,225,000 in 1848 and now detached from those potentially sympathetic in Scandinavia, Denmark would have difficulty effectively opposing any major industrial power. Britain and Germany aside, there was also Russia, still largely undeveloped, but a power with strong Baltic interests. Maintaining Denmarkâs borders through this delicately balanced neutrality was not going to be easy for such a small nation state. Would it be remotely possible to achieve this passively by developing trade? Could enduring borders otherwise be protected by influencing perceptions of Denmarkâs historic cultural identity and ethnicity?\n\nPÃ¥ vej til region SÃ¸nderjylland-Schleswig\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nKlatt, Martin\n\n2004-01-01\n\nOm udviklingen af det dansk-tyske grÃ¦nseoverskridende samarbejde, der blev formaliseret i Region SÃ¸nderjylland-Schleswig i 1997 Udgivelsesdato: december......Om udviklingen af det dansk-tyske grÃ¦nseoverskridende samarbejde, der blev formaliseret i Region SÃ¸nderjylland-Schleswig i 1997 Udgivelsesdato: december...\n\nBewÃ¤sserung in Sachsen\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nGramm, Marina\n\n2014-01-01\n\nDer Bericht gibt einen Ãberblick Ã¼ber den Umfang der bewÃ¤sserten landwirtschaftlichen FlÃ¤che in Sachsen und die bewÃ¤sserten Kulturarten.

Because of the occurrence of random extreme values of rates, mapping without prior spatial-statistical data analysis is problematic from aÂ methodological and risk-communicative viewpoint - the extreme values easily mislead the card reader and obscure actual spatial patterns.The problem of data instability can generally be met by aggregation or by smoothing. The cancer atlas for Schleswig-Holstein is based on data from 1142 municipalities (median population: 721) for the diagnostic years 2001-2010. Maps for incidence (as aÂ standardized incidence ratio), mortality (as aÂ standardized mortality ratio), and relative survival (as aÂ relative excess risk) were smoothed by using aÂ Bayesian method (BYM model). The maps show that spatial differences can be made visible by smoothing.Data aggregation is the methodically simpler way, but means aÂ loss of information. The atlas shows that small-scale mapping is possible while preserving the entire spatial information. The method of smoothing is complex, but useful for generating hypotheses. The spatial patterns found are complex, difficult to interpret, and require the collaboration of specialists from different professions, because of the diverse influencing factors (data collection, lifestyle factors, early detection, risk factors, etc.). The effort required to explain the methodology in aÂ language easy to understand should not be underestimated.\n\nThe Second Schleswig War 1864.

This was obviously not enough for the parliamentary groups of the SPD and Die Gruenen (Green party) of the Bremen City Parliament. With an Act dated 25 January 2012, the Bremen Parliament decided to amend the Harbour Operation Act insofar as '..the turnover of nuclear fuels in the sense of paragraph 2 Para. 1 of the Nuclear Act is excluded..'. This means that the turnover of nuclear fuels in the Bremer harbours is principally forbidden, unless the senate grants an explicit exception. However: Can a federal legislator enforce its energy policies like that? In order to receive an answer to this question, the representatives of the CDU parliamentary group of the Bremen Parliament lodged a complaint of unconstitutionality at the Bremen State Court of Justice. The decision was delivered on 12 April 2013 (AZ: St 1/12). And what answer did the CDU parliamentary group receive to their question? None. The Bremen State Court of Justice did not make a decision on this politically controversial issue. As its position, the State Court stated that the rules of the Basic Law on the limitations for the legislative jurisdiction between the Federation and the federal states do not constitute a component of the Bremen federal state constitution. And the legal criterion of the State Court of Justice is solely the Bremen constitution, not however, the Basic Law. In short: The State Court of Justice declares itself de facto not competent.

The ASR-reaction causes the expansion of altered aggregates by the formation of a swelling gel. This gel consists of calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) that increases in volume with water, which exerts an expansive pressure inside the material. The cathedral of Schleswig is one of the oldest in northern Germany. The first church was built in 985-965. The Romanesque building part was erected around 1180 and the Gothic nave at the end of the 13th century. The central tower was constructed between 1888 and 1894 with brick and cement mortar. With 112 meters, the tower is the second-largest church spire of the country of Schleswig-Holstein in northern Germany. Due to the formation of cracks and damages from 1953 to 1956 first restoration works took place. Further developments of cracks are making restoration necessary again today. For developing a suitable conservation strategy, different investigations were done. The investigation included the determination of the pore space properties, the hygric and thermal dilatation and mercury porosimetry measurements. Furthermore, the application of cathodoluminescence microscopy may give information about the alteration process and microstructures present and reveal the differences between unaltered and altered mortars. An obvious relation between the porosity and the swelling intensity could be detected. Furthermore it becomes apparent, that a clear zonation of the mortar took place. The mortar near the surface is denser with a lower porosity and has a significantly lower swelling or dilatation.\n\nEnergy Foundation Schleswig-Holstein.

Peatland drainage leads to increased peat oxidization and changes peatlands from carbon sinks to net carbon sources. Especially, the emissions of the important greenhouse gases (GHG) carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide are increased due to drainage. The currently ongoing restoration in the bog Himmelmoor (N 53Â° 44'20\", E 9Â° 51'00\", Quickborn) with an extent of about 6 km2 one of the largest raised bogs in Schleswig-Holstein, offers the possibility to characterize and to document the development of the fluxes at different sites before, during and after rewetting, using a method of small-scale closed chambers. Six subsites with differing water level and land use were identified: an area that was rewetted 30 years ago with Sphagnum vegetation, an area rewetted in 2009, an area with on-going peat extraction, deep peat cutting ditches refilled with peat with and without Eriophorum angustifolium vegetation and a comparatively dry peat dam. We determined that in the course of years 2014-2015 the measured N2O and CO2 fluxes varied between -0,1 and 1,9 mg m-2 h-1 and between -0,12 and 1,09 g m-2 h-1, respectively, and the highest nitrous oxide as well as carbon dioxide fluxes are typical for the dry peat dam study site. The measured CH4 fluxes were between -1,8 and 22,7 mg m-2 h-1, where the highest rates were found on the area rewetted 30 years ago and on the peat cutting ditches with Eriophorum angustifolium. Accounting for the different global warming potentials (GWP) of the measured greenhouse gases, the annual GHG balance was calculated. Emissions from all study sites ranged between 5,2 and 36 t CO2-eq ha-1 year-1 and were dominated by high emissions of CO2 (2,5 up to 25,5 t CO2-eq ha-1 year-1). Highest emission rates were found at the dry peat dam site and at the area rewetted 30 years ago.

Elementary health care offered in the reception centre and transitory facilities is based on voluntary acceptance by the refugees. At the same time, legal requirements for the medical reception of refugees are observed. In addition, doctors performing the initial medical examination are enabled to cover acute care on the spot. During the preliminary phase of immigration refugees are allowed to see a doctor in their facility repeatedly. After aÂ certain time, they are provided with aÂ health card permitting limited access to regular care outside of their facility. The current rise of refugee numbers affects the situation of Bremen health care for adult as well as juvenile refugees.

The paper describes a statistical method for determining geogenic metal concentrations in rivers based on the concept of âaggregated riverine landscapesâ (ARLs, which applies to all rivers in the Federal State of Saxony-Anhalt (Germany. The methodology includes the pre-selection of existing data by eliminating all sampling locations from the database which have anthropogenic influence, the GIS-based allocation of the sampling locations with respect to the respective ARL being the evaluation units, and the assessment of the geogenic background by statistical calculation of the 90th percentile. After validation of the methodology, the existing database was complemented by additional measurements for regions with data gaps. About 85,000 records of water samples, 1400 records of sediment samples, and 920 records of suspended particulate samples were used for the determination of the geogenic metal concentrations in the rivers of Saxony-Anhalt. The investigation included the parameters Al, Ag, As, B, Ba, Be, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Se, Ti, U, V, and Zn. The investigation results offer the determination of regions with increased background levels for certain metals or metalloids in Saxony-Anhalt.\n\nPractical experience with phaseout-oriented execution of law\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nHellenschmidt, J.G.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nThe result of two years of experience with phaseout-oriented execution of law is that the original political target of the new head of the authorities - abandonment of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy in Schleswig-Holstein within 2 years on the basis of the law in force - was unachievable despite considerable efforts. This interim result can be seen as positive for the operators of nuclear power plants in Schleswig-Holstein, because despite the stringency of the nuclear supervisory authorities, which could hardly be more severe, no deficits in safety, which would have warranted decommissioning, have appeared to become obvious.

Material and Methods: A representative sample of physicians in private practice in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, was surveyed according to a 2-year longitudinal design (T1 â 2008, N = 549 and T2 â 2010, N = 414. The study included 22 items regarding the attractiveness of establishing and working in private practice, and the questionnaires: the Short Form-12 Health Survey (SF-12, and Work-related Behavior and Experience Pattern (Arbeitsbezogenes Verhaltens- und Erlebensmuster â AVEM. Results: Job satisfaction among those private practitioners decreased over time but their willingness to choose the profession once again remained unchanged. Patient care and the continuity of physician-patient relationship encouraged establishing and working in private practice; state regulation, financial risk, and administrative effort weighed against it. At both T1 and T2, physicians scored significantly lower for mental health than general population. About 20% of physicians showed a healthy behavior and experience pattern but 40% of them showed the pattern of reduced working motivation. About 20% of participants were at elevated risk for overexertion and for burnout. Physical and mental health as well as the total distribution of patterns did not change significantly during the 2-year observation period. Physicians at higher burnout risk rated tasks related to patient care considerably less positively than those with healthy pattern. Conclusions: In order to improve job satisfaction and quality of life, and to make private practice more attractive, those German physicians require a improved legislation, b educational programs that promote the attractiveness of private practice\n\nDigitalisierung der vollstÃ¤ndigen deutschsprachigen Zeitungen des 17.

For both, ionizing radiations and chemicals, concepts and models exists to assess possible health effects for the population living in such areas. However, these assessment models were developed independently for both kinds of contaminants. Therefore, the 9{sup th} Conference of the State Ministers for Environmental Protection have claimed that for the evaluation of contaminated sites the radiological and chemical contaminants should be integrated into a joint assessment. This feasibility study describes the state of the art of the concepts and models used for the evaluation of radiological and chemical contaminants.

In this way ZARM`s european unique ground-based microgravity laboratory displays an excellent economic alternative for research in space-related conditions at low costs comparable to orbital platforms. Many national and international ex-perimentalists motivated by these prospects decide to benefit from the high-quality and easy accessible microgravity environment only provided by the Drop Tower Bremen. Corresponding experiments in reduced gravity could open new perspectives of investigation methods and give scientists an impressive potential for a future technology and multidisciplinary applications on different research fields like Fundamental Physics, Astrophysics, Fluid Dynamics, Combus-tion, Material Science, Chemistry and Biology. Generally, realizing microgravity experiments at ZARM`s drop tower facility meet new requirements of the experimental hardware and may lead to some technical constraints in the setups. In any case the ZARM Drop Tower Operation and Service Company (ZARM FAB mbH) maintaining the drop tower facility is prepared to as-sist experimentalists by offering own air-conditioned laboratories, clean rooms, workshops and consulting engineers, as well as scientific personal. Furthermore, ZARM`s on-site apartment can be used for accommodations during the experiment campaigns. In terms of approaching drop tower experimenting, consulting of experimentalists is mandatory to successfully accomplish the pursued drop or catapult capsule experiment. For this purpose there will be a lot of expertise and help given by ZARM FAB mbH in strong cooperation to-gether with the experimentalists. However, in comparison to standard laboratory setups the drop or catapult capsule setup seems to be completely different at first view.

The aim was to compare the reproductive performance and survival of Holstein and Holstein Ã Simmental crossbred cows. Data from two farms were used as follows: one located in Bom Retiro, in the state of Santa Catarina, Brazil. and another in CarambeÃ­, ParanÃ¡ state. Information concerning birth, inseminations, and parity date were obtained from the management software of the farms, generating information regarding the calving interval, days between calving to first service, conception rate, and age at first calving. At one of the farms, calving was monitoring to quantify dystocia. Live weight as well as body condition score (BCS) of cows and information of culling were obtained to determine the survival rate. Data were analyzed by variance analysis and by logistic regression. Crossbred Holstein Ã Simmental cows had better reproductive performance than the Holstein cows, characterized by lower calving interval (381 vs. 445Â days), higher conception rate (37.3 vs. 33.6Â %), and shorter calving to first service interval (65 vs. 89Â days). These results were related to a higher BCS in crossbred cows (3.63 vs. 2.94 points). Crossbred Holstein Ã Simmental cows had higher survival rate than Holstein cows on the second parity (83 vs. 92Â %). No differences between genetic groups were observed (Pâ>â0.05) for body weight and dystocia. In conclusion, Holstein Ã Simmental crossbred cows have better reproductive performance and higher survival rate than Holstein cows.\n\nFuture disposal of sewage sludge in Saxony; Zukuenftige Klaerschlammentsorgung im Freistaat Sachsen\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nKowalski, H.D, [Saechsisches Staatsministerium fuer Umwelt und Landesentwicklung, Dresden (Germany)\n\n1995-11-01\n\nEarly in 1994, the Saxonian ministry of environment and regional development (SMU) commissioned an expertise with the preliminary title ``Concept for long-term strategies for sewage sludge disposal from municipal sewage treatment plants in Saxony``.

Reflections on attempts to prohibit the transport of radioactive material in Germany with special consideration of the Bremen Port Operation Act\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nFeldmann, U.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nIrrespective of the fact that about 95% of all nuclear transports are not related to the nuclear fuel cycle but are needed among others in medicine, research, agriculture, non-destructive testing of material and in the non-nuclear industry the number of protests against transports of all sorts of radioactive material have increased, especially the attempts to prohibit nuclear transports or - e.g. by delay - to hamper them. Such attempts come from citizens' initiatives as well as out of the political area. However, prohibition of nuclear transports can also be prescribed by law. A striking example for such a prohibition is the ban of loading and unloading of nuclear fuel in the ports of Bremen which was inserted in the Bremen Port Operation Act in 2012. Because of the unconstitutionality of this ban (Breach of exclusive federal competence and breach of loyalty to the federal state) but also because of the ban setting a precedent it was indispensable to take action before court against the ban. Several actions were brought to the administration court of Bremen in 2013 by three companies being active in the nuclear fuel cycle. The aim of the actions is to get a decision by the Federal Constitutional Court attesting the unconstitutionality of paragraph 2 subpara 3 of Bremens Port Operation Act.\n\nModern completion and start-up techniques for petroleum wells on Mittelplate: Mittelplate A 3a and 8b; Moderne Komplettierung und Inproduktionssetzung von Erdoelbohrungen auf Mittelplate am Beispiel Mittelplate A 3a und 8b\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nSauer, P.

In view of the large number of overburden dumps in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia caused the authors to restrict their investigations to ore mines and to select elements characteristic of the worked deposits and their potential environmental effects. The following problems were investigated: Are overburden dumps significant emitters of elements at all? Which elements are emitted in what concentrations, in what form and up to what distance from the dump? Are there really different patterns for gangue and impregnation types? How big is the real reaction space of the dump? Should the whole dump be assumed to be a reservoir of elements for emission or just parts of it? What are the factors that most strongly influence element mobilisation and/or retention? What measures should be recommended for emission reduction "
