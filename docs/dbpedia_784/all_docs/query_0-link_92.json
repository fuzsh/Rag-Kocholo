While I cannot personally thank the historical muses who put me “in the right place, at the right time” with regard to this project on East German identity, I can express my gratitude to many earth-bound actors who contributed to the production of this book. For starters, I acknowledge the Ford Foundation which financed my initial Fellowship in GDR Studies at the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies (AICGS), 1989–1990, then extended my grant for two months commensurate with the increasing complexity of the topic. I also recognize the BMW Center for German and European Studies at Georgetown University which enabled me to start analyzing my data as its first research fellow, 1990–1991. Likewise included in my thanks are the German Marshall Fund of the United States, the German Academic Exchange Service, the GDR Studies Association of the United States and the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, whose financial support made it possible for me to travel to the German Dramatic Republic at critical turning points, as well as to continue my investigation regarding the fates of eastern residents over the next few decades. Completion of this book would not have been possible without the sustained support of multiple colleagues at different stages of my research, though some of us have drifted apart since the 1990s. My interactions with “regulars” and visitors at the AICGS ensured access to a broad spectrum of political perspectives on the course of unification, a never-ending flow of newspaper and journal articles, as well as unanticipated v\n\nvi\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nopportunities to view the making of history from a front-row seat. I enjoyed the company and friendly assistance of AICGS “co-workers,” especially the late Dr. Manfred Stassen (DAAD), well beyond my year in residence. Co-fellow and subsequent Research Director, Lily Gardner Feldman, provided detailed readings of my work, countless recommendation letters and years of Frauensolidarität well beyond the institute walls. Other intellectual compatriots gratefully discovered by way of my earlier affiliations included Friederike Eigler, Daniela Dahn, Christiane Lemke, Jonathan Olsen, Ann Phillips, Helga Welsh, Pastor Bernd Wrede and Jennifer Yoder. I extend heartfelt thanks to Judith and Reinhard Maiworm (Goethe Institute), who sustained me for years (actually decades) with their professional enthusiasm, private hospitality, personal friendship and a shared belief that it is possible to build a permanently peaceful, democratic German nation. Nor could I have completed core components of my fieldwork without the assistance and candor of several GDR facilitators, especially my 1990 hosts at the former Central Institute for Youth Research in Leipzig, Wilfried Schubarth, Ulrich Heublein and Rudolf Dennhardt. Siegfried Sach at the GDR Institute for International Relations helped me to secure a number of appointments with leading SED officials (rarely granted to academics from a capitalist-imperialist “enemy state”) during the critical twelve months preceding the 1989 Wende. Klaus Richter, Marianne Eschenbach and Herr Viererbe, wherever he may be, arranged invaluable interviews with parliamentarians from Bundnis ’90, the SPD and the CDU, in the wake of the first truly democratic Volkskammer elections. Gisela Richter, Ruth and Hans Misselwitz, Marianne Birthler, Eckhard Priller, Heinrich Bortfeldt and Detlef Pollack provided updates with respect to post-unity currents in the East-Länder during my annual summer sojourns. The University of Missouri-St. Louis accorded me flexible research leave opportunities, while the late Jan Frantzen, Linda Miller and Lana Vierdag helped with successive grant deadlines, allowing me to commit many extraordinary experiences to paper while I still remembered them. My son Joshua provided me with the opportunity to experience the eastern child-care system first-hand in Erfurt. His time at Zwergenland, in turn, supplied him with the German language skills that enabled him to pursue two internships at Schiffshebewerk Niederfinow, as well as a master’s degree at the University of Stuttgart. My particular thanks to German taxpayers for funding not only my research projects but also two years of my son’s graduate education.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nvii\n\nMarriage, motherhood and four intervening books delayed the completion of this work, but those years blessed me with new colleague-friends who urged me to continue with this academic equivalent of a painstaking archeological dig. Gabriele Abels and Sabine Lang, especially, extended countless speaking invitations and fantastic hospitality, which kept me going through good times and bad. The wonderful facilities and cheerful assistance of my favorite librarians at the Bundestag Bibliothek in Berlin made sure that the final draft of this book materialized in accordance with the Humboldtian tradition of Einsamkeit und Freiheit. Strange as it sounds, I also owe a certain debt to the otherwise devastating COVID pandemic. The latter kept me seated at my dining room table in front of a laptop for months on end, pulling together a wide assortment of old and new books, government reports, journal articles, newspaper clippings, critical re-reflections and personal memories. This book is dedicated to the millions of “essential workers,” worldwide, who did not enjoy that luxury but whose devotion and hard work made it possible for me to emerge from this difficult time in good health, a little bit older and possibly wiser.\n\nContents\n\n1 Introduction: Prelude to a German Revolution 1 Methodology 9 Part I Dimensions of the Dialectical Identity 17 2 Exit, Voice, and

In less than two weeks, I would be moving to Washington, D.C., where I planned to investigate GDR-identity as it had crystallized across a span of four decades since its founding in 1949. I had already spent four years exploring the contours of postwar German identity as it had evolved among the cohorts born into the Western state, 1949–1989.1 I secured funding and outlined a research agenda in late 1988, uncertain at the time what barriers I would encounter in trying to unearth the official and unofficial dimensions of GDR state-consciousness in a closed socialist society, the German Democratic Republic. As one of my last formal duties in St. Louis, I attended a dinner hosted by the Goethe Institute featuring the prominent if querulous West German author, Günther Grass. Seated next to the guest of honor, I briefly described my upcoming project, to which Grass immediately responded: “Identity? Homeland? I believe that a homeland is something one can only define as that which one has lost.”2 Our casual dinner-party exchange came back to haunt me six months later. On November 9, 1989—that chaotic, champagne-drenched night during which the Berlin Wall suddenly came tumbling down—Grass’s definition of identity wedded to homeland assumed the status of a self-fulfilling prophecy. Nearly twenty years of living and researching abroad have confirmed my belief that the concepts of Heimat and Identität are most easily defined from a distance. The pressures and distractions of day-to-day living at close range tend to obscure the contours of the larger picture. By contrast, © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023 J. M. Mushaben, What Remains?, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-18888-6_1\n\n1\n\n2\n\nJ. M. MUSHABEN\n\nthe ability to look back on past relationships and dependencies helps an individual to accord new weights to the influence each has exercised on her personal development. The opportunity to return to a place of origin, and possibly reminisce with those who stayed behind, yields a sense of the permanent and the transitional, the core and the peripheral elements of one’s personal identity. Time, distance, and lapses of memory usually render one critical of certain aspects and laudatory toward others, although the truth usually lies somewhere in between. Homeland is, more often than not, a place one “comes from.” Serving as Berlin’s Reigning Mayor, Willy Brandt sustained the moral courage of his people when the Wall suddenly went up in August 1961. As Germany’s first social-democratic Chancellor, he just as courageously dared to pursue East-West rapprochement under the rubric of Ostpolitik. The day after the Wall fell in 1989, he eloquently summarized the hopes of millions of postwar European citizens with the words, “Now that which belongs together can grow together.” My initial aim in writing this book was to challenge that proposition, to persuade the reader that the search for “German identity” did not end with unification. I argued back then that while the former SPD Chancellor had been a brilliant statesman, he was not an expert demographer: Had he reflected on generational change, his prognosis would have been a lot more pessimistic. By 1989, two-thirds of Westerners and three-fourths of Easterners had been born after World War II, meaning that most had never experienced a whole nation. Once the Wall fell, 16.4 million GDR citizens were expected to jettison the lives they had known, and to reassess how they had “arranged” themselves with the SED regime, how they may have suffered as its victims, and how they might best adapt to a new world. Over 61 million FRG citizens were ostensibly free to pursue business and politics as usual. My earlier study of generational differences in the old Federal Republic of Germany had nonetheless persuaded me that rather than ending a search for shared feelings of national belonging, the formal merger of two ideologically opposed states marked only the beginning of a new quest for deutsche Identität. This story of East German identity before and after the opening of the Wall is a study of identity lost, found, and reconfigured. But history is not a soliloquy. Any national narrative involves characters, places, events, multiple plot twists, a climax, and sometimes a denouement. The German Democratic Republic had all of these, but “the rest of the story” cannot\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: PRELUDE TO A GERMAN REVOLUTION\n\n3\n\nbe told unless and/or until Western Germans come to recognize that their own past and future is intricately connected to the experiences of the other side. Assessing the strengths and weaknesses of what used to be GDR-­ identity has been rendered no easier by the curious nature of my discipline: political science pits the scientific against the political, the normative against the empirical, and institutional imperatives against human components. In 1906 Arthur L. Bowley at the Royal Statistical Society (London) prescribed the first rules for determining a “representative sample,” a mechanism that has become the lifeline of political behaviorists everywhere. German identity nonetheless predates the existence of survey research techniques by a few hundred years, its core elements having been established by countless wars and regime changes. The relatively closed nature of GDR society made it virtually impossible for scholars to employ standard methodologies used to test the attitudinal waters in the West. This does not mean that East German officials prohibited any and all forms of public opinion data; it does imply, however, that one cannot take the existing data at face value. I was the first US-American to be accorded unlimited access to archival materials at the GDR’s Central Institute for Youth Research (ZIJ) in Leipzig. Prior to the so-called Turn-around (Wende) of 1989, the survey data generated there could only be accessed by SED Politburo members, select Central Committee departments, the Office for Youth Affairs in the Council of Ministers, and top officials of the Free German Youth League (FDJ). For better or worse (given the outdated copying facilities I encountered during my first two-week stay), I was also the last American to enjoy this privilege as a formal guest “during GDR times.” In accordance with provisions appended to the Unity Treaty, the ZIJ was abgewickelt, “wound down” and dissolved in December 1990. Several works drawing on the Leipzig data have been published since 1991, usually by former ZIJ researchers, but most texts have appeared only in German. This book attempts, inter alia, to provide a broader picture of the Institute’s longitudinal findings than is usually accessible to English-speaking readers. The experience of having both one’s “target-group” and “data base” officially cease to exist halfway through a research project is but one of the occupational hazards which have tested the mettle of East European analysts since 1990. Feeling quite blessed not by my “late birth” but rather by my good fortune at landing in the GDR when I did, mine was a very moving but also an extraordinarily chaotic research experience from the start.\n\n4\n\nJ. M. MUSHABEN\n\nI had expected to encounter much distrust, if not outright official hostility toward a project as controversial as mine. Since its inception, GDR leaders had viewed the constructs of nation and nationality as very touchy issues, subjecting them to many ideological revisions. My contacts quickly trained me to employ the term DDR-Staatsbewußtsein [GDR state-consciousness] in all “identity” discussions with public officials. I arrived in East Berlin for preliminary talks the very week that hundreds of vacationing GDR citizens began to seek refuge at West German embassies in Budapest, Prague, and Warsaw, August 5–12, 1989. To my great surprise, office doors opened, prominent SED officials offered to supply me with critical background materials and a few of them even treated me to lunch. The conditions I experienced during the exhilarating yet chaotic months of August 1989 through December 1990 have been replaced by routine archival visits on the part of younger scholars interested in GDR life. Though over thirty years have passed, I find it useful, on occasion, to remind ourselves just how fundamentally German conditions and life-styles have changed—not only in the eastern Länder but also in the “old” federal states. With amazing speed, an overwhelming majority of Eastern Germans embraced democratic processes as natural and good, despite forty years of socialization under an authoritarian regime. This book gives them long-overdue credit for this achievement. I can best illustrate these points by recounting my initial experiences in the field. On November 26, 1989, two weeks after the Wall had opened, I was escorted along the labyrinthine hallways of the building housing the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party. I passed by numerous uniformed armed guards en route to a prescheduled interview with Klaus Hoepcke, the then-Minister for Cultural Affairs serving the Politburo. Promised only half an hour to discuss the historical evolution and contemporary significance of “GDR state-consciousness,” I took the risk of addressing the obvious collective-identity crisis highlighted by the crowded embassy compounds. To my astonishment, Hoepke responded in a very personal manner to my questions about identity, extending the interview to an hour. Seven months later, as a PDS delegate in the first democratically elected parliament (Volkskammer, VK), he invited me to visit him at home in order to continue our discussion along with his wife and daughter. I did not receive his letter (which he had hand-delivered to the Academy for Social Sciences where I was occupying a dorm room) until four days after the proposed meeting. This was but the first of many “communication breakdowns” impeding my plan to conduct over sixty official discussions in the still-existing GDR.\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: PRELUDE TO A GERMAN REVOLUTION\n\n5\n\nMy efforts to secure interviews with members of the new parliament were Kafkaesque at best. Anticipating a dearth of xeroxing facilities at the Academy, I had brought along a hundred copies of a letter explaining my project and requesting interviews with VK delegates. Supported by the German Marshall Fund, I had been able to observe the elections first-hand in March 1990, but no comprehensive list of the new parliamentarians had been published prior to my April return. To compile a somewhat representative sample of prospective interviewees, I needed the names and addresses of all the new legislators. Landing in East Berlin on Tuesday, April 24, 1990, I headed for “the Palace of the Republic” on Wednesday, certain that such a list would be available six weeks after the election. Notified that the Volkskammer would convene at the end of the week (April 26), I hoped to post my letters before the legislators left the capital-city for a long holiday break. The uniformed men at the reception desk were unable to offer direct assistance, but they indicated that the delegates’ offices were located in the former Central Committee building. I rushed over to that once-intimidating complex that had been rechristened the House of Parliamentarians. Three uniformed men at the reception desk immediately demanded my “identification.” I handed over my passport, explaining in German who I was (a university professor from the USA, officially invited by the Academy of Social Sciences) and what I needed (a list of the new VK representatives and their contact addresses). They told me that the entire building was undergoing renovation; few MPs had moved into the offices, hence no such list was available. They urged me to return to the Volkskammer, housed in the (asbestos-­ permeated) “Palace,” colloquially known as the Ballast of the Republic. The guards there were surprised to see me back. Having “no information,” they felt no further obligation toward me and resumed their own conversation, though I did not leave. My outsider status afforded me a degree of courage: I insisted that someone in the building had to have some way of informing the people’s democratically elected representatives about upcoming committee meetings and plenary sessions. All I wanted was access to that person. They rang up a press liaison who agreed to meet me in the cloakroom. After twenty minutes, the young man consented to share his own list which classified the MPs by party only. Lacking access to a xerox machine himself, he graciously allowed me to hand-copy all 400+ names into my notebook. Two hours later I reappeared at the Palace reception desk with forty letters in care of selected members. Lacking\n\n6\n\nJ. M. MUSHABEN\n\nspecific addresses, I requested that they be placed in the parliamentarians’ mailboxes prior to the next plenum, set to convene a day later. One functionary accepted the letters, though the in-house mailroom was closed for the afternoon. It had been, I thought, a very productive day. The next morning I registered with the city police for my temporary residency permit, exchanged D-Marks for East Marks at the official 1-to-1 rate, and returned to the People’s Chamber. Given my need to track down each letter-recipient to set up individual meeting dates, I reiterated my request for phone numbers and contact addresses. The VK guards sent me back to the House of Parliamentarians, where that crew was likewise surprised to see me again. I re-explained the situation at length. Insisting they had no such list, they advised me to check with die Fraktionen [caucuses] at the headquarters of the individual parties. I spent all day Thursday being shunted back and forth from one site to another under the following refrains: ★★★ At the central CDU office: “You want addresses and phone numbers of our VK members? We’d like to have them ourselves! Try the House of Parliamentarians.” ★★★ Back at the HoP reception desk: “We don’t have ‘em. You have to go back to the party caucuses.” ★★★ At the now smaller, back-door office of the SED-turned-PDS: “As you can see, they made us move. Maybe Herr-So-und-So can help you.” Herr-So-und-So found my project very interesting and told me he hoped to receive a copy of my book when it came out. Regretfully he had no addresses and phone numbers for his party’s VK delegates. ★★★ Back at the People’s Chamber: “No, [they] didn’t know where the Liberal Party had moved to. Maybe the SPD could help.” ★★★ Returning to the SPD headquarters: I had a long conversation with an amiable office worker, Marianne Eschenbach who, in addition to offering me coffee, cookies and a place to stay, promised to arrange an interview with “her” MP, Angelika Barbe, confirmed the next day. Utterly frustrated, I returned to the House of Parliamentarians on Friday morning prior to appointments with Michael Brie (Humboldt University), the Wiens (two dissident film-makers from Pankow who were sheltering a Romanian refugee family in their three-room apartment), and\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: PRELUDE TO A GERMAN REVOLUTION\n\n7\n\nJens Reich, a cofounder of New Forum. Adopting a more Teutonic tone, I demanded access to MP addresses/phone numbers and remained at the reception desk for forty-five minutes. Now constituting something of a security risk, I was assured that an official responsible for “international relations” was on his way to appease (and/or dismiss) me. After another forty-five minutes of circular arguments, I squeezed out one name and (wonder of wonders) the room number for the managing officer of the CDU-caucus, Herr Viererber. I thanked the guards for their “assistance,” noting that I would return on Monday to contact the CDU. “You can’t do that,” they responded; “the holiday is coming up.” Yes, I noted, “May First (International Workers’ Day) falls on Tuesday, but I’ll be back on Monday.” They repeated: “You can’t do that. We will be closed. Wir haben vorgearbeitet” [“We’ve worked our hours ahead of time”]. Two and a half months after the elections, parliamentarians had no offices, no phones, no contact addresses. The building itself was a hazardous construction site, with old bugging devices openly visible in the walls—yet the “workers” would take an extra day off because they had built up “compensatory” time! It is easy to see why the interim government of Lothar de Maizière did not occupy a particularly strong bargaining position vis-à-vis FRG officials in Bonn during the critical phase of negotiations over the conditions for accession. When I reappeared at the reception desk at 8:00 a.m. on Wednesday after the holiday, I announced (disingenuously) that I had an appointment with Herr Viererber, located in Room 4135. Not knowing his actual whereabouts and having no phone contact, the guards presumed that I did have an officially scheduled meeting and allowed me to ascend in the pater-noster unaccompanied. I spent the next two hours roaming the halls of the former Central Committee, encountering huge piles of plaster and scaffolding materials but nary a worker. I eventually discovered not only the “real-existing” Herr Viererber but also Klaus Richter, Managing Officer for Bündnis’ 90, who immediately agreed to locate prospective interview partners in his party. Another chance discovery, a kindly secretary for the FDP, Frau Wagner, agreed to schedule interviews with three of “her” parliamentarians, after disclosing many of her own economic fears and identity concerns linked to the so-called Wende. A few days later, a CDU parliamentarian already back home in Dresden called to say he had seen his name atop a large stack of envelopes left in a reception room after the Friday VK plenum. My letters had not been distributed, much less on\n\n8\n\nJ. M. MUSHABEN\n\ntime, to legislative delegates; those who eventually did respond to my interview request would not reach me until weeks later. In short, each interview referenced in this book usually entailed serious detective work, as well as many hours underway with the decrepit DDR Reichsbahn. Colleagues who established their own scientific reputations in the field of GDR Studies prior to 1989 will appreciate the valiance of my struggle as well as the numerous historical and psychological ironies depicted herein. The need to “read between the lines” prior to 1989 infused all GDR-analyses with a higher degree of subjectivity than Western number-crunching analysts are inclined to tolerate. That special breed known as “GDR researchers” had to seek confirmation for their hypotheses across many sub-fields ranging from literature and history to social-­ psychology, organizational theory, and even psycho-therapy, resulting in a kind of multi-dimensional “validation” not enjoyed by those committed to quantitative analyses. Many survey experts unfamiliar with GDR history and culture nonetheless headed eastwards during the final months of the regime, hoping to ply their trade. Armed with batteries of questionnaires—a real improvement over the tanks and missiles of old—they sought to record the historical moment, to compare the identities of Western and Eastern Germans at their respective peaks, and to capture the essence of DDR-Identität before it assumed its proper place (as Friedrich Engels opined) in the “museum of human history, next to the bronze ax and the spinning wheel.” Having found what they deemed to be “statistically significant” political similarities (e.g., electoral preferences), too many underestimated the long-term impact of other socio-psychological variables. Their methodologies often precluded them from looking in the “right places” for deep-seated differences between the Germans of East and West, analogous to the proverbial town drunk looking for his wristwatch under the streetlamp, not because that is where he lost it but because that is where the light happens to be. My investigations over the last three decades began with a single, albeit complex question: Had forty years of division resulted in the formation of separate identities for the Germans of East and West, or was it possible that the historical bonds of “national consciousness” had transcended the horrors of war, the ignominy of defeat and the imposition of diametrically opposed socio-­ economic systems? This is the second of two books focusing on that question, based on my belief that separate identities had indeed emerged in the two Germanys as early as 1972. I remain convinced that one must first comprehend how far the peoples of a divided nation had grown apart\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: PRELUDE TO A GERMAN REVOLUTION\n\n9\n\nbetween 1949 and 1989, before one can begin to figure out (with all due respect to Humpty-Dumpty) how to put them back together again. This book is divided into three parts. The first part (Chaps. 2 and 3) explores the historical and “national” components of GDR-Identity as it was officially defined and propagated over a span of forty years. The second part (Chaps. 4, 5, and 6) analyzes major factors that contributed to a growing gap between the national consciousness espoused by the Socialist leadership and average citizens’ willingness to embrace the official version prior to the fall of the Berlin Wall. It explores the transformation of identity among former GDR state officials, party functionaries and “true-­ believers.” Fired or forced into early retirement, many came to perceive themselves as outright “losers” following unification, though a few became surprisingly successful capitalists. The third part (Chaps. 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11) investigates the unofficial dimensions of East German identity which imprinted themselves on the personal consciousness of specific subsets of citizens, as a key to understanding, in the words of Christa Wolf, what remains.3 It explores an array of often erroneously conflated subcultures—writers, intellectuals, pastors, dissidents, women and youth—along with working-class men, whose identities have been marked by alienation and hostility since the political implosion of 1989, attracting them to the rightwing populist Alternative for Germany party.4 The concluding chapter is devoted to speculations about the orientations and identities of post-Wall youth (Third Generation East), and the curious failure of West Germans to recognize the extent to which their own identities have been reconfigured in the wake of unification.\n\nMethodology Although my Ford Foundation grant had been approved in mid-1988, I was unable to commence work on this project exploring DDR-Identität until June 1989. My initial experiences in the field provided many important lessons about the lives and mind-sets of citizens made-in-the-GDR, a number of which can be used retrospectively to “defend” the eclectic methodological approach adopted here (see Box 1.1). For younger scholars whose curiosity has been piqued by the collapse of the GDR, my account will call forth the image of an academic stone-age or, at a minimum, tales of a Great Depression they did not personally witness. They may find it hard to imagine an industrialized country unable to provide visiting professors with the names of elected officials, much less to supply\n\n10\n\nJ. M. MUSHABEN\n\nits citizens adequately with women’s underwear and other personal hygiene articles as late as the 1970s. As Holcolm noted in reference to “the perils of qualitative research,” the nine-to-five set need not have applied for an adventure such as this. Box 1.1 On the Perils of “Collecting Qualitative Data”: Holcolm’s Evaluation Laws\n\n☺ Always be suspicious of data collection that goes according to plan. ☺ Research subjects have also been known to be people. ☺ The evaluator’s scientific observation is some person’s real life experience.

Scholars who study authoritarian regimes recognize the methodological limitations inherent in the conduct of empirical research, irrespective of its specific ideological orientation. It is difficult to accumulate quantifiable data in countries which regularly prohibit opinion polls, falsify governmental statistics to glorify their own achievements, bar foreign researchers from their territory, and utilize secret police or criminal statutes to intimidate prospective interview partners. Scholars compelled by circumstances to rely upon qualitative methods are frequently called upon to “defend”\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: PRELUDE TO A GERMAN REVOLUTION\n\n11\n\ntheir sources and strategies by quantitative experts whose objects of study are open, liberal-democratic systems. Decades after unification, I still view the findings of Western pollsters who “discovered” the East European states in 1989/1990 with skepticism. Individuals continuously socialized into hiding their real feelings about leaders and policies will not automatically shift to candid expressions of political self-interest, no matter how delighted they are to be asked, at long last, about their personal preferences. Recently liberated citizens usually have too much at stake to reveal their innermost political feelings, seeking to avoid charges of complicity with the old regimes or due to their collective need to please would-be foreign investors. My pre-1989 experiences in the realm of GDR research taught me to integrate many kinds of data, ranging from official parade slogans to anti-­ state jokes circulated among members of the underground. This study draws on books, newspapers, radio broadcasts, official documents, opposition leaflets, campaign materials, hand-copied surveys from the ZIJ, and on-site observations. My findings also derive from an exhausting yet exhilarating array of personal discussions, including 50+ in-depth interviews (lasting one to three hours each), executed at five key points throughout the transformational process. They included: the period of mass emigration in August 1989; the opening of the Wall, November 1989; the first free elections in March 1990; communal elections and preparations for the arrival of the D-Mark, April-June 1990; and the first all-German elections of December 1990. I completed roughly thirty interviews with members of the first democratically elected Volkskammer, two of whom subsequently became Ministers in the first all-German government under Chancellor Helmut Kohl: Rainer Ortlebb (Education), and Claudia Nolta (Women and Family). De Maizière’s Deputy Press-speaker, Angela Merkel, became Minister for Women and Youth, later responsible for the Environment and Nuclear Safety. Merkel then moved on to become Germany’s first woman Chancellor (2005–2021), while another interviewee, Joachim Gauck, subsequently served as Federal-President (2012–2017), after directing the agency responsible for processing Stasi files for ten years. More than half of my VK sample moved on to seats in the all-German Bundestag or assumed positions in the new Länder governments after 1990, though several then left the political arena to pursue other careers. The realization that all investigators respond to political phenomena on the basis of their own values and interests is not a barrier to solid empirical\n\n12\n\nJ. M. MUSHABEN\n\nresearch. The questions I judge most essential to an understanding of GDR-identity cannot, for the most part, be answered on a quantitative basis. But hard data do have their place in a longitudinal study of this sort; this text utilizes insights compiled by Eastern experts of a quantitative bent, formerly employed by the Zentralinstitut für Jugendforschung in Leipzig. The Central Institute for Youth Research was created in 1966 under the direction of psychology professor Dr. Walter Friedrich, who remained at the helm until its December 1990 dissolution. Subordinated to the Office for Youth Questions in the GDR Council of Ministers, the ZIJ’s tasks and structure were defined by way of the Ministerial Resolution of 26 February 1968. The Socialist Unity Party (SED), in cooperation with the Free German Youth (FDJ), retained for itself the power to approve the development of research emphases, the formulation of research plans, as well as the establishment of contacts between commissioned researchers and participating institutions. Scholars sought to influence the choice of methodologies by way of a limited number of seats on the Scientific Council. The latter consisted of delegates from the ZIJ, the communist youth league and the SED, named by the Director of the Office for Youth Questions. Resident scholars conducted over 400 investigations from the time of the Institute’s inception until its dissolution, including a battery of studies which sampled the mood of youth throughout the critical periods of 1989/1990.5 Administrators at both the Academy in Berlin and the Central Institute in Leipzig had learned one thing about the “free market economy” immediately prior to the arrival of the western D-Mark under the Currency Union (scheduled to take effect on July 1, 1990). They informed me that I would have to pay an “organizational use fee,” but neither was willing to accept the still-valid coin of the realm, the East-­Mark. My costs ranged from $100 for “tuition,” plus DM50 per night for lodgings at the desolate-looking Academy, to a charge of DM60 per week at the ZIJ. Never mind the fact that I had to cross paths with Academy employees to get to the restroom/shower at 6:30 a.m., and that all the lights in the building were shut off on weekends. When the concierge took a break, or left his/ her post for unexplained reasons, the overnight “house-guests” found themselves locked in for lengthier periods. This also happened to two of my very surprised West Berlin friends who had come to meet me there. I had neither a typewriter nor a xerox machine at my disposal during my initial stay in Leipzig, meaning that I had to copy most of statistical tables by hand—even though the ZIJ, according to official reports, met\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: PRELUDE TO A GERMAN REVOLUTION\n\n13\n\n“all the requirements of modern social research.” Institute researchers relied on a typing-pool, allowing the government to control the dispersal of a potentially controversial document. I was never treated to a tour of the “computer facilities,” but it was easy to conjure up the image of “Hal” from the classic film, 2001, sitting in a basement next to the winter supply of coal brickets. The Institute’s unisex water-closet on our floor, always to be locked after use, afforded interesting insights into pre-war German plumbing techniques. Most of the materials placed at my disposal were in the process of being declassified, though they still bore the labels “Confidential Document,” “Confidential-Classified” or “Top-Secret Document.” Unfortunately, ZIJ co-workers had not yet completed the task of re-cataloguing newly declassified documents during my May 1990 visit. It was therefore difficult to locate many of the “top secret” documents, based on the registry of titles I was given. By the time I returned in November, the Institute’s dissolution was already imminent under the Unity Treaty. Realizing that they would be unemployed by mid-December, some 90% of the support staff no longer subscribed to the principle of a full working day. Only once did I succeed in locating the librarian at her designated workspace (7:30 to 11:30 a.m. on Wednesdays); when I requested access to the top-secret documents from the basement archives, she expressed surprise regarding my interest in “that old stuff.” I had less than twenty-four hours to examine several “historical” studies, uncovered two weeks before the Central Institute officially ceased to exist. Its data were transferred to the Deutsches Jugendforschungsinstitut (German Institute for Youth Research) in Munich and the Central Archive for Empirical Social Research in Cologne. The services of some eighteen former institute members were retained only through 1994. The perils of relying on official GDR-data, in general, and ZIJ data, in particular, are self-evident. First, there is the “non-representative” nature of earlier GDR-youth surveys. To some degree, this deficit reflects the state-of-the-art problems confronting behavioralists of decades past. For the most part, the ZIJ evaluators included an appropriate caveat regarding problems of statistical sampling in the introductory sections of their studies. Second, there is the politically “loaded” nature of the questions researchers were expected to pose (see Chap. 10). In addition to facing questions heavy with official terminology—as opposed to colloquial formulations which might have more clearly reflected their real feelings— young participants were limited to SED-sanctioned response options.\n\n14\n\nJ. M. MUSHABEN\n\nAnother qualification regarding ZIJ data stems from the fact that responses were solicited under a command system rather than on the basis of voluntary participation. Though researchers sought to guarantee anonymity by collecting classroom surveys into a large pile, it was always difficult to assess the sincerity of the answers provided, the contents of which may have been motivated by fear, by a concern for one’s university or career prospects, by a sense of duty-consciousness, or by direct teacher supervision. Attempts to verify individual responses with follow-up interviews would have resulted in further distrust, multiplying the number of disingenuous replies, although this method was used on occasion. Added to this dilemma is the fact that most GDR-youth would have been well-­ versed in “double-speak” by the time they were teenagers. Last but not least, there were the formidable problems of interpretation, replication, publication, and, ultimately, open discussion of the results. Consistent with its general self-glorification tendencies, the regime tolerated only those interpretations of data stressing that “the glass was almost full,” as ominous as the signs of youth discontent had become by the early 1980s. Though regularly denied permission to publish any data suggesting an erosion of systemic support, Institute members could, on occasion, lecture on their findings among “selected” publics permitted to discuss them, for example, FDJ functionaries. By the summer of 1989, a direct order from the Chief of the Office for Youth Affairs in the Council of Ministers barred all ZIJ analysts from discussing the deteriorating political climate publicly. That muzzle was only removed in the wake of the dramatic events of October/November, by which point it had already become impossible to reverse the course of GDR history. These serious qualifications notwithstanding, the Leipzig data do tell a rather astounding story. More important than the extent to which young survey participants protected themselves by voicing the party-line is the degree to which they did not, despite the negative repercussions most realized they might face. Surveys of the late 1970s testify to a consciously articulated loss of faith in the system, especially among young members of the working class. A comparable decline in support would not be observed among university students and party-political youth until the mid-1980s. Educational Minister Margot Honecker, along with the Politburo members who were privy to these data, might have undertaken policy changes at the onset of the decade to ensure the system’s survival, yet they refused to see the handwriting on the Wall, real and proverbial. Thus, the\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: PRELUDE TO A GERMAN REVOLUTION\n\n15\n\nbeginning of the end of the German Democratic Republic was rooted in the hearts and minds of East German youth almost a decade prior to the Party’s “great fall.” This book is, to a large extent, an effort to tell youth’s side of the story (citizens now in their 40s and 50s), as well as to assess the role of generational change in precipitating the system’s collapse. My work challenges many Western publications which “explain” the GDR’s demise solely in terms of dictatorship and command-economy rationalizations. Drawing on Hirschman’s oft-cited framework of exit, voice, and loyalty, I attempt to determine which elements of East German identity have persisted under unification as a function of GDR-specific socialization mechanisms, the critical dimension of loyalty having been ignored by most authors exploring the exit-voice dynamics of the short-lived Wende phase. My analysis is grounded in the belief that residents of the young Länder need not abandon “East German” identity in its entirety in order to embrace new democratic institutions and values cultivated under the Western-dominated Federal Republic. I contend that the rediscovery of personal East German identities, a process mockingly referred to as Ostalgie [East-nostalgia], should not be viewed as an attempt to paint the GDR past as a golden one, nor as an attempt by former citizens to exonerate themselves from complicity with what was admittedly an authoritarian regime. As my earlier study of West German identity attested, residents of the old Länder have cultivated a Nestalgie of their own, that is, a yearning for the well-feathered western nest in the “unsullied” economic-miracle state they used to know. I see the rediscovery of differences among German citizens today as fulfilling a fundamentally necessary purpose: the renewed search for an East-identity is one phase of a process of taking pieces of the old-life—a multitude of familiar cultural norms, practices, behaviors, and tastes (their habitus, as Bourdieu would say)—and reassembling or reconfiguring them into new networks. In other words, it is a search for mixed modes of social capital—another way of describing one’s “loyalty” to old norms, behaviors, interpersonal relationships, and even tastes—that lend themselves to more effective use under new institutional conditions and new socio-psychological imperatives. As was true throughout the socialist bloc, the slightest changes in official terminology oftentimes signaled fundamental shifts in doctrine. Certain German terms are so fraught with historical significance that an English translation may render them trivial, however. The German term\n\n16\n\nJ. M. MUSHABEN\n\ndas Volk, for example, bears “organic” connotations ideologically at odds with its American equivalent “the people,” just as Heimat is culturally more significant than “home” as understood by geographically mobile Americans. Terms like this have been left as is, with profound apologies to non-German readers. I otherwise provide original East German terms, accompanied by an English equivalent; all translations, unless otherwise noted, are my own. It is to the official, historical, and ideological dimensions of DDR-Identität, propagated by the Socialist Unity Party across a span of four decades, that we now turn.\n\nNotes 1.

It was the “so-called DDR.” Like other countries throughout history and across the globe, this one was created to pursue a specific set of ideals, derived from the not-so-happy history of the big and powerful country that had preceded it, which had also been German. It wanted to guarantee that this horrible history would never be repeated, so it adopted a new model for a perfect, peaceful society—and for a brief period it showed the promise of becoming die deutsche (anti-faschistische) demokratische Republik, 1945–1948. But human leaders aren’t perfect and, like so many countries, this one had a hard time living up to its ideals. Step by step, the theory became alienated from the praxis so, like many other governments, this one tried to win the hearts and minds of its citizens by using ever more boasting, propaganda and even coercion. Its rulers wanted the country to give birth to millions of “socialist personalities” in their own image and likeness. But the message became stale, the schools became authoritarian and the goods were not always delivered, during this phase of die deutsche demagogische Republik, 1949–1970. As a result, the people became more apolitical, as they pulled into their private niches; the state grew ever more distant, but they found a quiet middle ground. They invented an historical compromise they called an “arrangement.” The people would go to May Day and Founders’ Day parades (most big governments love parades on their birthdays) and the state would leave them more or less alone to struggle through the periods of scarce consumer goods, albeit with lots of subsidies. Contradictions were, after all, just part of\n\n18\n\nDimensions of the Dialectical Identity\n\nthe process of growing up to be real-existing socialists, and this was clearly the phase of die deutsche dialektische Republik, 1971–1987. The contradictions worsened, however, when the people in the Land of Resistance Fighters woke up one day, turned on their televisions to watch the evening news, on West-TV, and discovered that other countries were changing all around them, opening their borders, even printing real-news in their newspapers. DDR citizens wanted to know why they couldn’t at least be as free as the Hungarians if they couldn’t be as rich as “the other” Germans. So they headed out, in many new places, for a different kind of parade with lots of candles; with lots of candles; only this time their children—actually the children of the children of the comrades who had built the country in the first place—pointed their fingers and called out loud that the emperor was wearing no clothes. Their parents were a little ashamed, not of their leaders’ nakedness (after all, they had fought for nudist beaches) but of their own silence all those years, and suddenly they became “the people” in die deutsche dramatische Republik, 1988–1990. Now some people wanted to ask important, theoretical questions, after their own local parades, to talk about rebuilding their country based on a new set of ideals. Most of their neighbors didn’t want to wait around for the answers, however. Instead they packed their camping gear, got into their funny little cars called Trabis (for Traurige Arbeiter und Bauern Initiative/ The Sad Initiative of Workers and Peasants), and following the wisdom of a famous cigarette commercial, they shouted “Let’s go West.” Though our story does not end here, this phase could be labeled die deutsche demolierte Republik, which dominated the headlines from March 18 to October 3, 1990. Not too long after the Wall came tumbling down, some people who looked into their academic crystal balls and psychology textbooks predicted it would take at least a decade for our sheroes and heroes to learn how to live happily ever after in their glittery new republic. Five years into the internationally celebrated marriage of the richly attired Western King and the somewhat haggard-looking Eastern princess, the new people living in the Bigger (though not totally Better) Kingdom started to ask, in the words of their own Cassandra, “What remains?” They started to wonder ostagically, so to speak, why they were being treated like strangers in a strange land. Too many had lost their jobs, their benefits, their Heimat and often, quite literally, “a home of their own,” in this new, deutsche däprimierte Republik, 1991–1998. Now Old King Kohl was not such a merry, bold soul by the end of his reign, so he and his minions hardly noticed that something amazing was taking place in the far-away parts of his kingdom. The people started talking out\n\nDimensions of the Dialectical Identity\n\n19\n\nloud, or talking to each other, while thinking about tactics and tricks they had used to make their homeland better “in GDR times,” as they were wont to say. Remembering their clubs, their grill- and other kinds of parties, their Handys, their days and (k)nights of the Round Table, they took one last look in the Spiegel (surveys); although the photo still wasn’t very flattering, they suddenly realized that they had lost their ugly Duckmäuser demeanor and were anxious to become a deutsche dynamische Region, 1999–2007.1 That would have been a happy ending, but the dark clouds of an EU financial “shit-storm” (as the Germans say) spread across the land. Shortly thereafter many new people from foreign lands began pouring into the Kingdom in search of peace and freedom, just like these Germans had done many years ago. But some of the citizens grew afraid and resentful, so they took to the streets once again, chanting “we are the people.” But this time they started voting for angry, taboo-breaking politicians who reminded too many others at home and abroad of the deutsches dämonisches Reich that had caused them to be divided in the first place. Unlike most fairy tales, this is not the end of his- or her-story, so let us continue the tale.\n\nNote 1.

MUSHABEN\n\nThis book began as a narrowly defined effort, prior to the fall of the Berlin Wall, to pinpoint the quintessential components of a divided national identity that rendered the German Democratic Republic a separate state across a span of four decades. Its initial purpose was to determine the extent to which specific elements of that identity contributed to, or worked against, the leadership’s efforts to legitimize the GDR’s existence in the eyes of its own citizens between its founding in 1949 and the 1989 Wende [Turn-around]. In the mid-1990s, I expanded my framework to investigate not only the officially mandated “GDR-identity” but also key features of a little studied, unofficial “eastern” (ostdeutsche) identity likely to shape the formation of a new all-German identity following unification, a topic I have followed for three decades. While the German Democratic Republic ceased to exist as a political entity on October 3, 1990, a de facto merging of the Eastern and Western cultures had yet to occur by the time of the 2017 national elections. Ironically, it took the rise of a rightwing populist party, the Alternative for Germany (AfD), to force prominent elites in the “old” Federal Republic to recognize the import of psychological factors in the unification process. The potential sources of ongoing division I had emphasized in 1990–1991 resurfaced in public debates around 2014, following the rise of the PEGIDA movement (Patriotic Europeans against the Islamization of the Occident) in Dresden.3 The fact that the official GDR-identity lacked deep roots among average citizens no doubt contributed to the state’s rapid demise after the dramatic opening of the Wall on November 9, 1989. The extraordinary pace of unification denied Easterners a chance to assess their attachment to familiar elements of everyday GDR culture and values, however, undercutting their ability to voice mounting dissatisfaction with the path that “unity” had taken. The GDR’s forty-year history embodies a complex interplay of continuity and change, successes and failures. Like every society, this one was fraught with contradictions and conflicts, both class- and gender-based. But eastern political culture also evinced its own forms of accommodation, bargaining, and social solidarity. Its dissolution was simplistically characterized in many quarters as the triumph of capitalism over communism, and/or freedom over dictatorship. But identities do not die as a consequence of new borders and a new currency alone. Were this the case, there would have been no rational basis, and certainly no socio-cultural foundation for a “reaffirmation” of national unity after forty years of German division.\n\n2 EXIT, VOICE, AND LOYALTY: THE THEORETICAL PARAMETERS\n\n23\n\nAt issue in this work is the staying-power of political culture. In his classic exploration of the Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy, Barrington Moore Jr. ascertained that human beings have frequently been “punched, bullied, sent to jail, thrown into concentration camps, cajoled, bribed, made into heroes, encouraged to read newspapers, stood up against a wall and shot, and sometimes even taught sociology,” under many types of regimes seeking to preserve or transmit a particular value system.4 This eclectic array of socialization methods, some more coercive than others, implies that the goal of any state is not only to promote its official political culture but also to have it internalized at the level of individual consciousness. Political culture and national identity are synergistically linked, but the de jure elimination of the former does not produce the immediate disappearance of the latter. Indeed, the difficulties inherent in the inculcation of a new identity tell us how hard it must be to wipe out old ones propagated by regimes of some duration. The significance of political culture has been emphasized by political theorists and would-be social engineers of many ideological persuasions, ranging from Vladimir Lenin, Sidney and Beatrice Webb, Margarete Mead, and Ruth Benedict, to Max Weber, Karl Mannheim, Talcott Parsons, Gabriel Almond, and Sydney Verba. This is not to imply that analysts share a consensus as to its content and role in processes of societal change. At a minimum, a country’s political culture can be understood as the cumulative impact of identities developed at multiple levels of “citizen consciousness.” Devoting significant energy to the study of communist states, Archie Brown defined political culture as “the subjective perception of history and politics, the fundamental beliefs and values, the foci of identification and loyalty, and the political knowledge and expectations which are the product of the specific historical experience of nations and groups.”5 Created after 1945 as a consequence of World War II, the socialist states of Eastern Europe were extremely ambitious in their efforts to redefine political culture “from above.” Seeking the total transformation of political, economic, and cultural values, the fledgling regimes faced the awesome task of introducing new historical-cultural traditions and “personalities” consonant with their own ideologies, in hopes of securing popular recognition of their new borders and institutions. The extent to which they were successful remains an open question, given the electoral comebacks of “reformed” socialist parties across Central/East Europe through the 1990s, followed by shifts to the radical right over the last decade. As one skeptical observer cautioned decades ago,\n\n24\n\nJ. M. MUSHABEN\n\nwhat the scholarship of comparative communism has been telling us is that the political cultures are not easily transformed. A sophisticated political movement ready to manipulate, penetrate, organize, indoctrinate, and coerce and given an opportunity to do so for a generation or longer ends up as much or more transformed than transforming.6\n\nWhile efforts to induce political-cultural change from above often fall short of the founders’ ideals, this does not preclude the possibility of fundamental, albeit incremental changes entrenching themselves from below over a period of many decades. Focusing on post-war Eastern Europe, Frank Parkin emphasized the transformation of values as a function of institutional power: “Values are much more likely to flow in a ‘downward’ than an ‘upward’ direction; consequently moral assumptions which originate within the subordinate class tend to win little acceptance among the dominant class.”7 Moore disputed this claim, maintaining that a complete set of values does “not descend from heaven to influence the course of history.” Political culture never serves as “more than an intervening variable’ [operating as a filter] between people and an ‘objective’ situation’, made up of all sorts of wants, expectations, and other ideas derived from the past.”8 It does so in ways that emphasize certain aspects of the objective situation by screening out others, a process involving selective memory. Alternatively, Brown posited that the ostensible (in)effectiveness of measures to secure political-cultural change may not be a question of an upward/downward flow but rather the result of minimal interaction between one (official) value system and another dominant or “peer” culture. New values, particularly those conducive to official aims, may be fused with old ones, while old ones might be reinterpreted and renamed. One should not presume that all cases of ostensible continuity involve processes of direct transmission. Indeed, revolutionary change in the political system opens up the possibility of dissonance between the political culture and the political system… That is to say, there may be a prolonged failure on the part of the controllers of institutional power to socialise the population into acceptance of the official political culture. In such a case, a crisis triggered off by other stimuli ­(frequently but by no means always economic) may produce a more open political situation in which the strength and direction of political change may be strongly influenced by the dominant—and no longer dormant— political culture.9\n\n2 EXIT, VOICE, AND LOYALTY: THE THEORETICAL PARAMETERS\n\n25\n\nThe speed of “acceptance” and the degree to which the parameters of a new political culture will be internalized depends, in part, on the nature of citizens’ historical break with the pre-existing culture. Mary McAuley stresses the interactive patterns between “past” and “present” factors, including but not limited to “the speed of economic change, the type of economic change, the role of the state, the relationship with other states, intellectual movements within and outside the country, historical memories,” as well as collective religious orientations.10 A third variable influencing this process derives from the forces of demography, that is, the proportion of a population that has reached political consciousness before, during and after transformative events have occurred. Last but not least, widespread absorption of a new paradigm of values, expectations, and behaviors may well depend upon the methods of inculcation employed in political (re)socialization. This study is rooted in a concept of identity that is explicitly multi-­ dimensional in character, incorporating objective as well as subjective features of East German political culture. It does not equate identity with the sentimentally driven “love it or leave it” mentality (alias patriotism) that typifies many US-American discussions of this topic. The construct utilized here covers a much wider range of behaviors and attitudes, some more inwardly directed than others. Like political socialization, identity-formation is an ongoing process, subject to many agents and environmental influences. Although this process takes place at many levels simultaneously, two are particularly important for the purposes of this study. The first entails official, collective culture which determines that dimension of identity best understood as “state consciousness.” This is the meaning ascribed to the term GDR-identity throughout this book. Secondly, identity is shaped at the unofficial, individual or personal level, in the realm Christiane Lemke and others have labeled “peer culture.”11 In this context, I apply the label East German identity. Both identity types usually encompass a spectrum of distinctive or competing sub-identities (women vs. men), ranging from an “all-German identity” or a specific “GDR-consciousness,” to regional and/or local micro-identities (e.g., as Saxonians or Berliners). The identity traits acquired at each level are interactive as well as cumulative; while distinguishable in theory, they are much harder to disaggregate in practice. This investigation nonetheless rests on these analytical distinctions, highlighting the key components of GDR-identity as it was officially defined, collectively cultivated and individually experienced throughout the\n\n26\n\nJ. M. MUSHABEN\n\ncourse of East German history. Although I do not posit a perfect correspondence between identity variables mandated at the political-systemic level and those observed at the level of human psychology, I believe that it is only by establishing linkages between the two that one can understand persistent tensions between Eastern and Western Germans, which is essential to facilitating their alleviation. Identity paradigms developed by social-psychologists can serve as effective heuristic devices in untangling the processes of national identity-­ formation.12 Observing in 1935 “how often in the last few years has one heard… that it is quite inexplicable how the Germans could have changed so completely in so short a time,” Karl Mannheim noted that an analyst misinterprets psychological trends when he (sic) speaks of a sudden change in national character… The most serious mistake… is to select a single man as his criterion, and then to regard him as the incarnation of all the changes that have taken place. If the different phases of the psychological changes that have been diffused throughout a large community are projected onto a single individual, one has only to multiply this figure a millionfold in order to pride oneself on being a social psychologist. In this case it is clear that the cardinal mistake was in creating the fiction of a uniform change passing steadily over an entire nation, instead of making a concrete analysis of social mechanisms. If we are to avoid mistakes of this kind we must divide this complex transformation into its successive phases, with a different social mechanism at work in each. [my emphasis]13\n\nMannheim’s caveat remains relevant for any scholar seeking to capture the essence of German national character in the post-war and post-Wall eras. We cannot assume that the GDR’s past efforts to instill a new “national” identity by fiat were uniformly effective among various segments of its population. Nor can we presume, as many post-unity prognoses did, that market forces will move Eastern Germans in equal measure to embrace the prevailing western or FRG-identity as their own. This chapter begins by outlining a concentric model of identity developed in conjunction with my earlier work on West German identity, before and after the fall of the Wall.14 Building on developmental and “operant conditioning” theories advanced by Abraham Maslow and B. F. Skinner, I explore key dimensions of individual-psychological, social-interactive and national-collective identity. I then consider the ways in which the abrupt demise of an official GDR-identity—but not its day-to-day counterpart, East German identity—has redefined the significance assigned to each dimension over the last three decades.\n\n2 EXIT, VOICE, AND LOYALTY: THE THEORETICAL PARAMETERS\n\n27\n\nI then revisit the exit/voice/loyalty paradigm first espoused by Albert O. Hirschman in 1970 and revived after 1989/1990 to explain the sudden collapse of the GDR. I argue that Hirschman’s analytical framework, rooted in Western, market-oriented and liberal-democratic assumptions, overlooks critical forms of social communication stressed by Karl Deutsch, that is, other types of exit and voice which evolved in response to the GDR’s one-party dominant, command-economy system.15 I contend further that Western bias led many post-Wall analysts, including Hirschman, to neglect the paradigm’s critical third dimension, loyalty. As a result, many scholars and political officials seriously underestimated the “staying power” of eastern identities at the level of peer culture. I attempt to remedy that miscalculation by linking loyalty to the concept of social capital, an ingredient I view as absolutely essential to the internalization of democracy among East German citizens in the nation united.\n\nA Concentric Approach to Identity Theory Identity begins with the individual, adding “layers” as it moves into the larger communities of family, neighborhood, city, state, and nation. To grasp the phenomenon of national identity in its entirety, it is helpful to imagine it as concentric in nature (Fig. 2.1). The innermost circle encompasses the psychological needs of the individual. The second circle involving specific patterns of social interaction may impose external limits on individual identity but can also provide alternate sources of self-worth. The outer circle finds identity moving beyond a personalized “community” to a legal or historical collectivity known as the nation-state. Academic scholarship often construes the forces operating within each of these circles as the province of a particular social science. There is nonetheless much to be gained by exploring competing or complementary frameworks for “identity” borrowed from more than one field. My search for East German identity therefore builds upon the works of political scientists, literary critics, social-psychologists, psycho-historians, and even psycho-therapists. Circle One: Identity as the Bio-Psychology of the Individual The acquisition of cognitive and affective orientations toward the self has long occupied the attention of psychologists and psycho-analysts ranging from Piaget to Freud. Theories regarding the contextual and interactional components of self-identity are less well-developed yet all the more\n\n28\n\nJ. M. MUSHABEN\n\nFig. 2.1 Concentric model of identity\n\ninteresting because of their inherently dynamic character. A broader interdisciplinary perspective helps to bridge the gap between individual and collective identification processes. An individual’s search for identity involves questions of personal as well as political motivation. In his classical work on motivational theory, Abraham Maslow posited five categories of human needs comprising a “hierarchy of relative prepotency.” Once each class of needs is satisfied, new and higher needs are expected to emerge which then come to dominate the individual [or collective] organism.16 In ascending order, the scale consists of basic physiological or sustenance needs, safety or security needs, belonging and love needs, esteem or status and independence needs and, finally, the need for self-actualization. Implicit in Maslow’s theory is the notion that neither woman nor man can be satisfied “by bread alone.” Humankind possesses an innate desire to advance from one level of the scale to another, but the quest for a sense of belonging is not inherently at odds with a striving for greater independence; the former serves as a precondition for the latter. Maslow anticipated the rise of a “new discontent and restlessness” in the face of a\n\n2 EXIT, VOICE, AND LOYALTY: THE THEORETICAL PARAMETERS\n\n29\n\nrepressed “desire to become more and more what one is, to become everything that one is capable of becoming.”17 A fundamental thwarting of these needs would “give rise to either basic discouragement or else compensatory or neurotic needs,” and possibly to severe traumatic neurosis.18 The latter is reflected in certain psychological “deformations” affecting particularly sensitive or politically persecuted individuals (but certainly not all citizens) under the old GDR regime.19 Desire alone will not enable an individual to attain a state of physical and psychological well-being. Each person must discover and engage in “functions furthering the interchange between organism and environment,” known as behavior.20 Not all behaviors move people toward their desired end of self-actualization; some can even prove counter-productive, causing humans to pursue a strategy B. F. Skinner characterized as “selection by consequences.” Drawing on patterns of biological evolution, Skinner traced persistent modes of human behavior back to the first molecule that managed to reproduce itself and prevail against the rest. Other organisms followed, whose reproduction occurred under ever more diverse and, in part, adverse conditions. The environment played a determining role in the genetic endowment of biological functions, rendering an organism most likely to survive/thrive under conditions equivalent to those underlying its selection. Hence, “the definition or identity of a species, person, or culture” is transmitted from one generation to the next to the degree that select behaviors are reproduced as part of an individual’s repertoire.21 Skinner held that successful reproduction over time depends on two processes enabling organisms to acquire behaviors appropriate to subsequent changes in the environment. The first is known as respondent (Pavlovian) conditioning, whereby responses pre-programmed by natural selection can be redirected and controlled by new stimuli. The second process is operant conditioning, whereby events immediately following new stimuli serve to strengthen or reinforce new responses. This method amounts to “selection in progress, resembling a hundred million years of natural selection or a thousand years of the evolution of a culture compressed into a very short period of time.”22 To the extent that human behavior is primarily social in nature, other members of the species provide one of the most stable fixtures within a given environment. “Imitation” of others is critical to reinforcement and thus to the perpetuation of a behavioral repertoire; contingencies inducing one “organism” to perform in a certain way will generally impel others\n\n30\n\nJ. M. MUSHABEN\n\nto behave in the same manner. Thus, “by taking advice, heeding warnings, following instructions, and observing rules, [humans] profit from what others have already learned. Ethical practices are codified in laws, and special techniques of ethical and intellectual self-management are devised and taught.”23 Codification of behavioral rules, based on the collective experiences of preceding generations, secures the survival of the species. Human beings nonetheless differ from other species by virtue of their verbal capabilities. Their capacity for voice, Skinner observes, gives rise to a further mode of selection by consequences embodied in social environments: “A culture evolves when practices originating in this way contribute to the success of the practicing group in solving its problems. It is the effect on the group, not the reinforcing consequences for individual members, that is responsible for the evolution of culture.”24 The quality of voice may be subject to modification under operant conditioning insofar as “the consequences of verbal behavior… are mediated by other people.”25 Skinner stressed that selection by consequences has not been sufficiently recognized as a “causal mode” of behavior in the realm of psychology or anthropology, an insight that also applies to political science. The reluctance to embrace operant conditioning as a societal determinant owes to modern scholars’ belief in the “voluntary” nature of human behavior, as a product of free will; nowhere is this image more evident than in the rational actor model which dominates many schools of political-economic thought. The notion that behavior is controllable without reference to a biologically imprinted “principle of mind” infers that a socio-cultural environment generates self-knowledge without the assistance of a collective consciousness. Stripped of gender, race, and class, the rational actor model presumes “the expendability of essences,” which political ideologies and religions nonetheless use to define “the significance of living.”26 For Skinner, the human variable assumes the form of an “initiating agent”: a constellation of individuals seeks to introduce new modes of behavior, either by instructing people how to respond to relevant contingencies or by imposing new “selective contingencies.” Skinner attributes a certain purposiveness to such intervention (Weberian Zweckrationalität), while setting aside the ethical questions it may pose: Contingencies are needed first of all to teach people to follow rules. People must first become effective listeners, and that means they must acquire all behavior that can be specified in rules if they are to do what the rules describe. Much more important are the contingencies under which they will continue to follow the rules once they have learned them.27\n\n2 EXIT, VOICE, AND LOYALTY: THE THEORETICAL PARAMETERS\n\n31\n\nHere Skinner introduces the concept of the contrived reinforcer. Historically speaking, there exist two fields in which general agreement has been reached that “contrived contingencies” are persistent if not imperative. The first pertains to the economic domain, the second to the political arena. Regarding economics, Skinner contends that early forms of production engendered “natural consequences”: Pay by the day or week is often mistakenly called reinforcement; its real function is to establish a standard of living from which the worker can be cut off … [insofar as] production in industry “depends in part on subordination, discipline, and acceptance of managerial authority”… The contrived reinforcer called money remains effective only when it has been exchanged for strongly reinforcing goods.28\n\nContrived reinforcement in the political realm can produce “frankly aversive” consequences: “when the power to punish is assigned to the government, the contingencies are more likely to be contrived and their shortcomings evident… Governmental practices tend to move farther and farther from natural, face-to-face contingencies.”29 The contrasting approaches adopted by Maslow and Skinner reflect the age-old debate as to the preeminence of “nature versus nurture.” For Maslow, the individual’s search for identity is internally driven, a basic component of human nature. For Skinner, the first step toward establishing personal identity is a reactive one, a function of external forces which accord more weight to the nurturing process. A third school, considered below, looks to identity-formation as a discrete process of individual unfolding that is embedded in a reciprocal relationship with the environment. Circle Two: Identity as Social Interaction According to Richard Logan, an “individual’s sense of self inevitably and necessarily reflects the general world views prevailing in a given era,” while a collectively shared sense of self can, over time, become “a ‘cause’ of subsequent cultural change.”30 From this contextual perspective, individual identity is rooted in developments through which “mental and behavioral events” come to be viewed as “historically situated constructions emerging from social process.”31\n\n32\n\nJ. M. MUSHABEN\n\nRecognizing that identity-formation requires a differentiation between self and other, Sheldon Stryker holds that the perceived distance between the two derives from one’s commitment to a unique configuration of “particulars.” One’s relationship “to particular others depends upon his or her being a given kind of person, i.e., occupying a particular position in a network of relationships, playing a particular role, and having a particular identity.”32 Neither the direction nor the intensity of one’s commitment to significant others must remain constant. What appears to be a change in identity (e.g., as individuals advance through the life cycle) may actually be a reflection of changes in the relationships between self and other. As befits the nature of the variable human, identity combines (and conflates) actual and ideal states of being in its efforts to link past, present, and future states of consciousness. Individuals who have experienced deep-­ seated identity problems in the past will sooner engage in a “problemistic search” for self than persons for whom identity implies a steady state. The more problematic that search has been in the past, the higher the degree of salience accorded to one’s present identity, and the more sensitive its bearer will remain to external or contextual evidence confirming or refuting that identity. As the German case illustrates, the link between “salience” and “self-consciousness” may (paradoxically) deny the bearer of a particular identity the chance to achieve a steady state. Circle Three: Identity as National Consciousness Likewise grounded in social interaction, national consciousness affords a more advanced manifestation of a prevailing “world view.” Psychologically linked and historically intertwined self-identity and national consciousness become mutually reinforcing. Stressing the interdependence of personal and political identity-formation, Mildred Schwarz argues: Out of the interaction of historical events, actions of government, activities, personalities, and ideologies of leaders, and conflicts and accommodations between interests, a nation emerges, and in so doing, acquires a distinctive character. This image of a nation then provides the focus for the personal identities of its members, sometimes lying dormant and other times becoming mobilized in the self-definitions of citizens.33\n\nIn a path-breaking study of post-war Germany, Alexander and Margret Mitscherlich addressed essential links between the character of the political system created in the Western state and the psychological orientations\n\n2 EXIT, VOICE, AND LOYALTY: THE THEORETICAL PARAMETERS\n\n33\n\nof individual citizens whose behavior had determined its substance prior to 1989.34 For these analysts, a sincere passion for democracy is rooted in a presumption of individual responsibility and tolerance. The stability of a democratic “consciousness” depends on the collective grasp of and citizens’ self-placement in history. Echoing elements of Skinner’s theory, the Mitscherlichs held that human history begins “way down below” and very early on. What is collectively defined as acceptable behavior becomes automatic over the course of a generation as morality becomes institutionalized. Once ensconced within the larger collective qua normative framework, an individual can only exercise freedom of thought to the extent that she exhibits an adequately developed “ego.”35 This does not mean that a stable society is atomistic in nature. On the contrary: the Mitscherlichs stressed that an individual can only develop self-sufficiency to the extent that her efforts to exercise self-initiative are grounded in a sense of empathy and participation, that is, in a willingness to share good times and bad times with those in one’s own environment. How an individual relates to her country at the socio-psychological level may or may not converge with the identification possibilities presented at the political-systemic level. The “identity” projected onto a given state by external actors, allies, and adversaries may be largely at odds with that state’s conception of itself. Herbert Kelman describes the theoretical linkage between these two levels of analysis, observing that a nation goes beyond the conception of “this is the way we do things” to a conception of “there is something unique, special and valuable about our way of doing things.” It is ideologizing of this sort that makes it possible to develop allegiance to and invest one’s identity in a collectivity that goes beyond in both space and time one’s primary group, face-to-face contacts.36\n\nExplicitly “nationalist” sentiments are but one aspect of an individual’s relationship to the state, however. Even if nationalism is rejected or discounted at the affective level, citizens need to develop modes of personal involvement with the political system in order to satisfy a broad spectrum of material, institutional, and integrational needs. Involvement with the national system may range from symbolic and/or normative modes of identification, to functional types of commitment, respectively. Kelman outlines six patterns of personal involvement with the nation-­ state, grounded in what he believes to be sentimental or instrumental\n\n34\n\nJ. M. MUSHABEN\n\nsources of “attachment” to the system, providing a foundation for “loyalty.” Sentimentally motivated individuals recognize the state’s right to allocate roles and impose duties based on their commitment to shared cultural values; this type projects a collective identity overlapping with one’s own value preferences. Secondly, citizens may derive identity from a commitment to the national system, perceived as an extension or enhancement of personal identity. A third form of identification stems from a commitment to the “sacredness” of the state, as an embodiment of an organic, holistic community. Alternatively, instrumental attachment emerges as a function of one’s commitment to particular socio-economic institutions. Another mode of national identification may result from a commitment to the institutionalization and effective performance of specific social roles. Finally, instrumental involvement with the system can also find roots in one’s commitment to “law and order” as desirable ends in and of themselves.37 The stability of the nation-state is secured through a balance of different types of “commitment,” more or less randomly distributed throughout the population. Personal attachment ensures a measure of political legitimacy and continuity to the extent that it stimulates further involvement with the system. Correspondingly, “involvement” or participation may generate a greater sense of collective consciousness, enhancing the likelihood that mobilized individuals will identify with the state that has provided participatory opportunities. As conventionally understood, the bonds of collective qua national consciousness are rooted in a common language, ethnicity, religion, and matching customs, usually within the framework of a shared history.38 The uniqueness of the German search for identity after 1945 owes to the fact that the creation of two separate states required not the evolution of common bonds but rather the dissolution of pre-existing ethnic, cultural, and historical ties. In this respect, the stages of collective consciousness-building in the two post-war states of Germany were reversed, or at least subject to a qualitatively different dynamic than the one usually projected by classical theories. As Kelman observes, the push from state to nation may violate the ideal model of the modern nation-state, which is presumably based on an already existing sense of national identity, but it is not all that inconsistent with historical precedents. Whether such a push will succeed… depends on the extent to which the state contains a well-functioning society with members who are interdependent and whose needs and interests are adequately met.39\n\n2 EXIT, VOICE, AND LOYALTY: THE THEORETICAL PARAMETERS\n\n35\n\nThis implies that instrumental forms of “attachment” can provide a measure of stability in the absence of sentimental ties during the initial stages of nation-building. It moreover suggests the existence of a symbiotic relationship between the processes of identity-formation and political legitimation, as mirrored in the diverging experiences of the two Germanys from the 1950s through the 1970s. On the one hand, the perception of the state as representative of national unity can compensate for failures to meet people’s needs and interests [GDR]. On the other hand, the perception of the state as meeting the people’s needs and interests can compensate for a lacking sense of national identity, and can in fact help to create such an identity [FRG].40\n\nIn most cases, the nation-state serves as the institutional embodiment of a common national consciousness, albeit one encompassing many types of collective consciousness within a given territory. The German language is replete with terms seeking to draw fine yet significant lines among competing modes of collective consciousness or, alternatively, to blur ultimate distinctions among those types. At different points in their separate histories, the leaders of both post-war states invoked the terms Kulturnation [cultural nation], Staatsnation [state-nation], Nationalbew"
