        "text": "German poet\n\nThis article is about the poet. For the musician, see Pinhead Gunpowder.\n\nSarah Kirsch (German: [ˈzaː.ʁa ˈkɪʁʃ] ⓘ; 16 April 1935 – 5 May 2013) was a German poet.[1]\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nSarah Kirsch was originally born Ingrid Bernstein in Limlingerode, Prussian Saxony but had changed her first name to Sarah in order to protest against her father's antisemitism.[1] She studied biology in Halle and literature at the Johannes R. Becher Institute for Literature in Leipzig.[1] In 1965, she co-wrote a book of poems with writer Rainer Kirsch, to whom she was married for ten years.[2] She protested against East Germany's expulsion of Wolf Biermann in 1976, which led to her exclusion from the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED).[1] One year later she left the country herself, nevertheless being critical of the West as well. She is mainly known for her poetry, but she also wrote prose and translated children's books into German.[3]\n\nAccording to complete review, \"the great German-language post-war poets were largely East German (or Austrian) born in the mid to late 1930s which included towering figures such as Volker Braun, Heinz Czechowski\" and Sarah Kirsch who was \"the most prominent female representative of that generation.\"[4]\n\nShe won many prizes and honours including the German international literary Petrarca-Preis in 1976, the Peter-Huchel Prize in 1993 and the Georg Büchner Prize in 1996.[1] From 1960-1968 she was married to lyricist Rainer Kirsch. Sarah Kirsch died in May 2013 following a brief illness.[1][5]\n\nBibliography (selection)\n\n[edit]\n\nResources\n\n[edit]\n\nSarah Kirsch by Mererid Hopwood (1997)\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
