When literary scholars historicise immigrant and ethnic-minority writing in their respective national contexts, they usually only focus on how this writing has become visible and how it has come to challenge the respective national literatures; they rarely tell us why this writing has remained invisible for such a long time in many of the contexts discussed here. Yet, as soon as we move beyond national contexts, this is the first question which comes to mind: How can we explain these differences, especially between countries that have very similar immigration histories? With this question in mind, we developed a comparative framework that would bring to light both of these perspectives in each chapter. The introduction serves to explain this framework as well as the selection of countries included in this volume.\n\nThis volume studies immigrant and ethnic-minority writers in fourteen national contexts from a comparative perspective.

Thus, it analyses their role in the framework of the ‘hybrid’ literary production of the 21st century in Europe, such as Spain and Italy. Moving away from the idea of national literatures, this paper investigates literature as a geographical and emotional inquiry point and friction between languages, ideas, practices, literary institutions, female authors, and female voices in today’s markets. Hybrid literature written by first and second-generation migrants and displaced people is part of a huger concept of transnational literature, which breaks down with the idea of national identity and transiting towards a new conceptualization of hybridity in the literary production, also based on the translation of writings to other languages. Based on the concept of ‘the location of culture’ and the conceptualization of the Bhabha’s ‘third space’, I wil...\n\nThis paper focuses on the transnationalisation of literary fields that has been taking place since the emergence of literature by migrant writers. This development occurred earlier in some national contexts and later in others. Independent of the historical evolution, however, the presence of migrant authors and their writings caused major changes in literary fields: authors have different cultural and linguistic backgrounds than the majority of their readers, the texts are set in faraway places; thus, also literary critics and scholars start to look into new topics and regions and readers are eventually confronted with new worlds. Consequently, transnationalisation also has political implications. However, it has not encompassed all aspects of the literary field. In fact, the individual and different histories of literature and migration in various national contexts show that the national frame is still a powerful and influential aspect. This paper discusses two examples-Austria and Great Britain-of the described transnationalisation and examines the role still held by national frames in literary fields."
