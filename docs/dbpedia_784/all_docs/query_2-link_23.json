Oh, the clouds\n\nLike mountains they fly over the forests.\n\nIf you don’t subscribe to a newspaper here\n\nThe world is in order.\n\nYour face is beautifully reflected\n\nIn the plum-jelly kettles and\n\nThe fields glow fire-red.\n\nEnd of the Year\n\nThis autumn the mushroom clouds\n\nBecame such a normal sight in the magazines\n\nThat aesthetic categories began arising\n\nWhile viewing the photographs\n\nThe condition of the blue planet was foreseeable\n\nThe term neutron bomb frequently appeared\n\nLike its brothers petrol prices weather report\n\nIt became as everyday as peace demands.\n\nMy child has come home with a D\n\nWhat should I say it’s hard\n\nLooking at him to bear his innocence\n\nAnd we are living our improbable\n\nAdventurous lives correcting the D\n\nHe goes to school we plant trees\n\nHear the emergency alarm ABC weapon warnings\n\nKnow the speeches of everyone’s generals.\n\nEarthsmoke\n\nAnd at different times it happens\n\nThat we’re very happy about\n\nSomething or other a message\n\nThe new lover the child\n\nCan move about then\n\nThe dreariest task pleases us\n\nWe cook the most wonderful\n\nRecipes clean the windows\n\nAnd sing kiss\n\nThe newly opened blossom\n\nOn the bush by the door talk\n\nTo strangers across the street\n\nAnd ignore the sun\n\nThe lightly dancing snow\n\nEverything is known and familiar\n\nWe think it will always be like this\n\nAnd even the terrible images\n\nIn the TVs reaffirm to us\n\nAt least here it will stay like this we tidily\n\nPile up the newspapers that allow us to sleep well\n\nUntil they’re collected\n\nWe are quite lively hop and jump about\n\nIn the furnished apartments of death\n\nEvening\n\nExuberantly the green changes\n\nFrom lighter to darker loveliness\n\nStrongly the sun now extracts\n\nThe light from the trees\n\nBefore it slinks off, the flowers\n\nVillage cocks in the morning, welcome\n\nThe evening with velvet colours\n\nIn the floods of ripe fields\n\nTardy tractors lurch\n\nThe sky grows plum blue\n\nAnd on the tongue still burns\n\nThe bite into the fly agaric\n\nO you good sunken cities\n\nHere things are cheerful and happy\n\nEven the dark begins\n\nIn glow and splendour.\n\nSnow\n\nHow before our accustomed eye\n\nEverything is transformed the village flies\n\nCenturies backwards in the snow\n\nA few crows are needed\n\nCoppiced willows along the path old fashioned dogs\n\nLove and loyalty reign you pull me over\n\nDitches carry my stolen\n\nLittle bundle of wood into the evening\n\nLiving smoke envelopes the roofs.\n\nMotionless\n\nThe day arrives out of the forests\n\nInvisible it is snowing in the boundaries\n\nOf yesterday and today I cannot\n\nDistinguish anything on earth\n\nEverything is indistinguishable and equal\n\nThe tracks of the wolves the lambs\n\nThe frozen hares are covered in snow\n\nIt settles on blown-over trees\n\nIt seeks to suffocate the living ones\n\nIt disappears the streams\n\nMoors and ponds everything is\n\nEqually dead and buried in the twilight\n\nOf sinking turning snow the eyes\n\nGet confused black flakes\n\nAsh does not fall rises or the sky\n\nAllows itself down since creatures are cowering\n\nBreathless motionless the silence without being or moon\n\nIt isn’t light or becoming dark\n\nNo one is walking the fields the fields\n\nFields of the dead growing shepherdless by the hour\n\nThe snowfall is as long as my life\n\nI have forgotten the name of the place\n\nAnd the streets kept squares\n\nWe are now shortly after the peace\n\nWe can’t remember everything\n\nThat happened erased awareness\n\nDevoid of people thoughtless no light\n\nNo shade pixellated images and only\n\nThe strength to not move.\n\nTrees"
