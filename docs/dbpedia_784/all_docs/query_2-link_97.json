        "text": "In early June 1977, shortly after the conclusion of Oberlin College’s spring semester, I returned to Berlin for a week. I stayed with friends in West Berlin, Brigitte and Hellfried Kellner, who kindly let me use the guest bedroom in the basement of their lovely villa in the district of Lichterfelde. During this time, I made several day trips to East Berlin, where I visited some friends and writers. A report in my file dated June 6, 1977 refreshes my memory of this visit and its purpose. According to the Stasi, I was interested as an operative or provocateur in meeting with GDR writers they viewed as enemies of the state.\n\nUnofficially, it became known that the USA citizen\n\nDr. ZIPSER, Richard\n\nborn: 1/23/1943\n\nresidence: Oberlin, Ohio 44074 (USA)\n\nemployed as: Assistant Prof. German Dept. Oberlin College\n\nknown operatively as active contact of hostile-\n\noppositional GDR writers\n\nwho for about a week now, since 6/4/1977, has been staying with the KELLNER family (Tel. [blacked out]) in Westberlin, is trying to set up meetings with GDR writers\n\nJurek BECKER\n\nUlrich PLENZDORF and\n\nSarah KIRSCH.\n\nOn 6/5/1977 ZIPSER got together with Sarah KIRSCH in her apartment.\n\nZIPSER has arranged to meet with Ulrich PLENZDORF on 6/6/1977, at noon, in the capital of the GDR.\n\nThe specific reason for ZIPSER’S discussions with Sarah KIRSCH and Ulrich PLENZDORF could not be determined.\n\nZIPSER wants to invite Jurek BECKER to visit the USA in 1978 and have preliminary discussions about that now.\n\n[ . . . ]"
