        "text": "Sad news: influential Bay Area musician Sarah Kirsch (formerly known as Mike Kirsch) died Monday, December 5, 2012. Shortly coming out as a trans-woman, Kirsch was diagnosed in summer 2011 with Fanconi anemia, a rare genetic disorder that causes leukemia and other cancers, and ultimately went through chemotherapy, bone marrow transplants, and lengthy hospital stays over the past year and a half.\n\nKirsch was the original guitarist of Pinhead Gunpowder, and played in a ton of Bay Area bands including Torches To Rome, Bread and Circuits, John Henry West, Fuel, Sawhorse, and many more. Most recently she was in Mothercountry Motherfuckers."
