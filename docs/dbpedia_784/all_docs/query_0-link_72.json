        "text": "King John V of Portugal, who ruled between 1707 and 1750, adopted an ambitious diplomatic policy towards the Holy See in order to project an image of Portugal abroad that could match the great European powers. In accordance with this procedure, arts and music assumed a key role in the representation of the Portuguese Crown in the Papal City. The conclave that following the death of Clement XI in 1721, which elected Michelangelo Conti — apostolic nuncio in Lisbon between 1698 and 1709 — as Pope Innocent XIII, contributed to strengthen these actions. Cardinals Nuno da Cunha e Ataíde and José Pereira de Lacerda travelled to Rome and remained some years in the city. Like the ambassadors and other diplomatic agents, they quickly assimilated the main features of Roman polycentric society and its courtly culture. Besides the artistic and ceremonial investment related to their titular churches (Sant’Anastasia and Santa Susanna), they became members of Accademia dell’Arcadia and were promoters and commissioners of musical works performed in their residences and in other venues (the national church of Sant’Antonio dei Portoghesi, the Collegio Romano, the Collegio Clementino and the Teatro Capranica), involving composers such as Alessandro Scarlatti, Carlo Cesarini, Francesco Gasparini, Giuseppe Orlandini and Giuseppe Amadori. At that time, some of the most talented Portuguese composers of the Baroque era (that is Francisco António de Almeida, António Teixeira and João Rodrigues Esteves) were studying in Rome. The musical activities fostered by the Portuguese cardinals were firstly pointed out in the context of wider studies by Saverio Franchi and Manuel Carlos de Brito, but a research directly focused on their musical patronage has not been carried out so far. New historical sources, found recently in Rome, Lisbon and Toledo, may provide a more accurate picture in order to clarify the main artistic networks and the role of music within the cardinals’ duties regarding political and ecclesiastical representation. Moreover, the study will consider the impact of the Roman experience after their return to Lisbon, in terms of cultural and musical transfer."
