        "text": "This book is the first full-length account in English of women’s writing in Germany, Austria and Switzerland to offer both an introduction to and a chronological overview of women’s writing in German-speaking countries from the Middle Ages to the present day. It will appeal both to students and to scholars of German literature, and to a wider readership interested in women’s writing and gender studies wishing to learn about the diversity and development of writing by women in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The sixteen chapters, written by experts in their field, are designed to dovetail into a comprehensive account of women’s writing over a thousand-year period. Extensive guides to further reading, and a detailed guide to more than three hundred writers and their works, together with an index for crossreferencing, form an integral part of the volume.

I am grateful to the University, and my colleagues there, for allowing me the time and space to establish the connections without which such a collaborative volume could not have been produced. In particular I should like to thank Professor Patrick Bridgwater, Waltraud Coles, Jo Tudor, and Catherine and Kevin Hilliard, not forgetting their son Sam, without whom we should never have met Eva Ibbotson. Among the many other friends and colleagues who helped to make my years in Durham ‘eine kurze / Goldene Zeit beinah der Gerechtigkeit’ (to quote Brecht) I am grateful to Lynne Pearce; Pat Waugh; and last but by no means least, Caroline Mason. A special mention is due to WIGS (Women in German Studies), founded in 1988, without which this project would have been unimaginable, and which by its very existence has had a profound impact on German studies in the UK today; in particular I should like to thank Margaret Ives for her continued interest and support, and for the Day Schools in Women Writers of the Age of Goethe at the University of Lancaster, at one of which this project in its present collaborative form may be said to have been conceived; Helen Watanabe-O’Kelly, for supporting the idea and putting me in touch with Cambridge University Press; Patricia Howe and Ricarda Schmidt, for providing congenial spaces in London and Manchester for us to ‘meet and talk’ about the initial shape of the project; Elizabeth Boa, for continued enthusiasm and, when faced with the thankless task of providing a Postscript, for her willingness continually to update as we were overtaken by events in German-speaking countries – not least German reunification ! I am grateful too to Joyce Crick and to Juliet Wig-\n\n[xiv]\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nmore for their active and supportive interest in the project. The US-based WiG (Women in German) has also been an invaluable source of contacts and information; and I am grateful to Professor Linda Dietrick at the University of Winnipeg, Canada for her interest in the project, and especially for generously making available her list of works in English translation, not all of which were known or accessible to me in the UK. I should further like to thank Eva Ibbotson of Newcastle, daughter of Anna Gmeyner and well-known author in her own right, for her spontaneous hospitality at our fortuitous meeting in Jesmond, for the books of Exilliteratur, and for putting me in touch with Lisette Buchholz of the Persona-Verlag and thus with Heike Klapdor-Kops, both of whom I should like to thank here for their interest and support. Thanks are also due to Beate Schmeichel-Falkenberg (whose acquaintance I owe to a similarly serendipitious meeting with her late mother); her active engagement in the field of Exilliteratur enabled her to put me in touch with Sonja Hilzinger, for whose swift response I remain extremely grateful. In Norwich, I should like to acknowledge the assistance of the EUR Research Committee Special Travel Fund at the University of East Anglia for funding to attend the WiG Special Session in Potsdam and the opportunity this presented to meet like-minded American colleagues, and for supporting research trips to the Deutsches Literaturarchiv in Marbach and the Europäisches Übersetzer-Kollegium in Straelen. I should like to take this opportunity to thank Klaus Birkenhauer, Regina Peeters and Karin Heinz at the EÜK, and all the ever-helpful MitarbeiterInnen at the Deutsches Literaturarchiv – particularly Jutta Bendt for her interest in the project. Special thanks are also due to Sabine Werner-Birkenbach for all the Frauengespräche and her generous hospitality in Marbach on numerous occasions. I am further grateful to the EUR Research Fund, and especially to the British Centre for Literary Translation at UEA, for financial support for the translation of the three German chapters in the book, and particularly to the translator Anthony Vivis for agreeing to undertake it, for his continued interest and support for the project as a whole, and his assistance in tracking down elusive translations (especially of contemporary drama) for the bibliography. Thanks are also due to the former and current directors of the BCLT, Terry Hale and Peter Bush, for information on recent English translations of German women’s writing. Less formally, I should like to thank my EUR colleagues Professors Max Sebald and Clive Scott, Keith Harvey, and Christine Wilson of the\n\nxv\n\nxvi\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nBCLT for their encouragement and support during difficult times. I am also grateful to my students at UEA, particularly the Contemporary German Women’s Writing class of 1996, for their consideration, understanding and enthusiasm during the later stages of the project. Thanks also to Serena Inskip for making springtime workspace and other home comforts available; Margot Paterson deserves a special mention here for her continuing support and interest as well as practical help. I should also like to thank Camilla Ullmann (daughter of Regina Ullmann); Joachim W. Storck and Evelyn Grill; in Oxford Ray Ockenden, Richard Sheppard, and Jill Hughes of the Taylorian; Gene Rogers and Derek Krueger in the US; Liz Harvey, Margaret Dériaz, and all the other friends and colleagues who have been supportive and encouraging of this project during its many stages. At Cambridge University Press, I am extremely grateful to Kate Brett and Linda Bree for their initial and continuing enthusiasm for the project, and especially for their patience and perseverance, as well as for their practical and editorial support and many valuable comments and suggestions.

C h r i s t a W o l f (ed.), Karoline von Günderrode: Der Schatten eines Traumes (1981), p. 5\n\nWomen lived for a long time without writing; then they began to write . . . with their lives and for their lives.\n\nA History of Women’s Writing in Germany, Austria and Switzerland – the title for this volume is at once both self-explanatory and controversial, ambitious yet necessarily modest in terms of what can be achieved in the scope of one volume. It cannot of course claim to provide an exhaustive analysis; where it breaks new ground for the English-speaking reader is in offering both an introduction to and an overview of the whole field, from the medieval mystic setting down her visions in Latin on the banks of the Rhine, to the immigrant writers of postunification Germany and beyond, whose mother tongue may not necessarily be German, but Turkish or Czech. It is intended to appeal not only to students and scholars of German literature, who I hope by now no longer have to ask – as previous generations have done, contemplating their reading lists or library shelves – ‘why are there no women authors in German?’ (sic), but also to a wider readership interested in women’s writing and gender studies wishing to inform themselves about the diversity and development of writing by women in Germanspeaking countries. This definition, which formed part of the original working title of the project, is intended to cover not only literature from Austria and Switzerland, as well as the former GDR and West Germany, but also writing by women from earlier periods when the\n\n[1]\n\n2\n\njo catling\n\nboundaries of the German-speaking world were very different from what they are today. In the present volume, individual chapters are designed to dovetail in such a way as to provide a chronological overview of writing by women in the German-speaking world, divided into four broad chronological sections. The markers used, for reasons of convenience rather than ideology, as Elizabeth Boa discusses in the postscript to this volume, are landmarks familiar from more conventional German literary history. (This has the advantage of providing points of orientation, which coincide with classification systems in most humanities libraries, thus facilitating further research.) As one of the purposes of this volume is to open up the field of women’s writing in German for further research, an extensive – though necessarily select – bibliography of secondary and background works, and suggestions for further reading, has been provided by the contributors to accompany their chapters. Footnotes and references within individual chapters, meanwhile, have been kept to a minimum; all bibliographical material has been grouped together at the end of the volume. The bibliographies by subject and by chapter are followed by a ‘bio-bibliography’ of individual writers, arranged alphabetically rather than chronologically. This gives details of dates and principal works by individual writers, together with translations where available, and (where appropriate) references to secondary material; finally, the index provides the necessary cross-referencing. The genesis of this volume may be traced back to a series of lectures I devised one summer term in Oxford in the late 1980s on ‘German Women Authors’. This was in turn provoked by the notable, even glaring, absence of books by German women writers on the otherwise generously stocked shelves of the college libraries with which I was most familiar. Those eight introductory lectures (which rapidly developed into a participatory seminar), spanning the period from the Middle Ages to the present day, are present as a kind of ghost or palimpsest beneath the chronological layout of the present volume. Conversations with colleagues and contacts at conferences of the then recently founded Women in German Studies (WIGS) and at Margaret Ives’s ‘Women Writers of the Age of Goethe’ Day Schools in Lancaster, and subsequently in the Deutsches Literaturarchiv in Marbach, and in the USA, created the initial concept of a collaborative and multi-perspective project, with contributors from Britain, the USA and Germany, both East and West. This project was code-named\n\nIntroduction\n\n‘“Invisible Writing”: German Women of Letters Through the Ages’, a programmatic working title which has, happily, been superseded as women’s writing has acquired a higher profile and greater visibility, both with its readers and within the academy. Things have changed, then, and for the better; the study of women’s writing is now an accepted (if not established) part of the curriculum, feminist scholarship in English- and German-speaking countries has moved on apace, and women writers are no longer systematically overlooked in standard works of reference and literary history. In this context it is gratifying to note that both Helen Watanabe-O’Kelly’s Cambridge History of German Literature and Eda Sagarra and Peter Skrine’s Companion to German Literature: From 1500 to the Present include significant numbers of women writers, in stark contrast to earlier volumes of this kind; furthermore, the relevant volumes devoted to German literature in the Dictionary of Literary Biography also contain substantial entries on individual women writers. Along the way, too, the Berlin Wall fell; the concept of Germany, and thus ‘German literature’, acquired a new dimension, and the book an extra chapter, reflecting the momentous historical changes and the ‘elation and despair’ (to use the original working title for that chapter) which German (re)unification has meant for women, and for women writers, particularly those from the former GDR. While the title of the volume and indeed its constituency of contributors have undergone modification, the project has remained faithful to the original aim of providing an introduction to, and survey of, writing by women in German-speaking countries from the Middle Ages to the present day. Its purpose is twofold: firstly to give the lie to the idea – based on the necessarily restricted range of ‘masterpieces’ (sic) which tends to make up the canon of German literature studied outside German-speaking countries – that ‘there are no German women authors’, by examining the works of women writers who seem by definition to be ‘little known’; and, secondly, to examine why this should be so. Was it the case, for example, that women in nineteenth-century Germany did not produce literary works (in contrast to their counterparts in, say, nineteenth-century England)? – or is there, rather, a problem of reception, so that the literary output is present, but has remained undiscovered or been deliberately ignored or suppressed? A survey of writers such as the present one does not of itself necessarily imply a feminist approach: however, in setting out to answer these questions, any gender-orientated study inevitably touches on the issue of what\n\n3\n\n4\n\njo catling\n\nToril Moi calls Sexual/ Textual Politics. A number of German and American scholars, mostly (though not exclusively) women, for example Silvia Bovenschen, Gisela Brinker-Gabler, Inge Stephan and Sigrid Weigel, Barbara Becker-Cantarino, Ruth-Ellen Boetcher-Joeres, Elke Frederiksen (to name but a few), have been devoting themselves to these questions since the 1980s, establishing the basis for an alternative or parallel ‘FrauenLiteraturGeschichte’ (women(’s) literature history) – to use the inevitable, and somewhat unwieldy, German compound which has arisen as a kind of shorthand for this activity. While there are some excellent compilations of specialist articles in German on women’s writing through the ages, on both German and other literatures – notably Gisela BrinkerGabler’s admirable two-volume Deutsche Literatur von Frauen (1988) and Hiltrud Gnüg and Renate Möhrmann’s Frauen-Literatur-Geschichte (1985) – there is no work which attempts a survey of all periods of German literature from this viewpoint in English at present. The present volume does not seek to produce an alternative, feminist, canon, but rather – as the original project title suggests – to make visible German women of letters to a wider audience. In this spirit, it fleshes out the bare bones of the indispensable bibliographical tools now available, such as the Lexikon deutschsprachiger Schriftstellerinnen 1800–1945 (edited by Gisela Brinker-Gabler, Karola Ludwig and Angela Wöffen) and Elke Frederiksen’s Bio-bibliographical Guide to Women Writers of Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The present volume should provide a complement to existing anthologies of German women’s writing in both German and English, such as Gisela Brinker-Gabler’s pioneering 1978 anthology of German women’s poetry, Deutsche Dichterinnen vom 16. Jahrhundert bis zur Gegenwart and Jeannine Blackwell and Susanne Zantop’s Bitter Healing, which makes selected works of German Women Writers 1700–1830 (its subtitle) available to an English-speaking readership, many for the first time. It is to be hoped that the general outline which this volume seeks to present will be filled out in due course by more detailed studies of particular periods, such as Chris Weedon’s 1997 Postwar Women’s Writing in German, or Margaret Ives and Tony Harper’s volume on the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Sappho in the Shadows, as well as by volumes with a more European or comparative perspective, such as Helena Forsås-Scott’s Textual Liberation. The term ‘FrauenLiteraturGeschichte’, like the title of this volume, raises the question of history. While the use made of historical landmarks and epochs of conventional literary history as a kind of guiding thread running through this volume might suggest otherwise, in fact, inasmuch\n\nIntroduction\n\nas the concept of history is taken to mean a continuous narrative of development, or diachronic progress, the ‘history of women’s writing’ cannot be said to be a history at all. As Elizabeth Boa notes in the Postscript, the attempt to compile a history of women’s writing is more like the ‘crisscross work of darning’, or the making of a patchwork quilt (as Elaine Showalter notes in a different context) than the spinning of a continuous thread. Any ‘development’, if this term applies at all, proceeds by fits and starts. Tracing a history of women’s writing is, then, an enterprise of continual recovery, of teasing out threads or picking up pieces, a work of making and mending: at all events, a slow and laborious process seemingly undertaken by each age afresh, sometimes, though not always, accompanying significant historical or political developments. Thus, for example, the plethora of anthologies of women’s writing in the early years of the twentieth century may be explained by the growing awareness of ‘the woman question’ which precedes and accompanies the women’s suffrage movements. In similar vein, what would in earlier ages no doubt have been referred to as the flowering of women’s writing in recent decades has its origins in the emancipatory women’s movements from the 1970s onwards. The struggle to find a voice of their own (it is no accident that the German for voice, Stimme, also means vote) is evoked in the title of Barbara Becker-Cantarino’s investigation of the development of women’s literature – and literacy – between 1500 and 1800, Der lange Weg zur Mündigkeit (The long road: coming of age), where Mündigkeit (the age of majority) appears to be cognate with Mund, meaning ‘mouth’. The foundations for the reclamation or perhaps reconstruction of a female literary tradition have, however, been laid by German women writers themselves. As an illustration of this, it may be worth tracing briefly here one example, that which gives rise to the epigraph by Christa Wolf above: Karoline von Günderrode. Born in Karlsruhe in 1780, she published a number of poems and dramas under a male pseudonym – Tian – before committing suicide in Winkel am Rhein in 1806. Part of the loose grouping of Romantic writers, including the Arnims and Brentanos, she was engaged in a correspondence with her friend Bettine Brentano (better known after her marriage to a fellow writer as Bettina von Arnim), which Bettine used as the basis for her epistolatory biographical novel Die Günderode. The letter form, which she also used for her similarly fictionalized Briefbiographien of Goethe (whom she almost literally worshipped as a young woman) and of her brother, the poet Clemens Brentano, is a genre\n\n5\n\n6\n\njo catling\n\nwhich she virtually inherited from her grandmother Sophie von La Roche, a ‘founding mother’ of the novel in Germany. Her Die Geschichte des Fräuleins von Sternheim (The History of Lady Sophia Sternheim) pre-dates – and had a major influence on – Goethe’s Die Leiden des jungen Werther (The Sorrows of Young Werther) as an epistolatory novel in the Richardson style. If Bettine, with all the advantages that coming from a literary family meant for an aspiring woman writer, played a large part in rescuing the work of her less fortunate, though arguably more talented, friend Günderrode from an undeserved oblivion, it is to the scholarly enterprises of a later generation of writers from the GDR that we owe, at least in part, the current reputation of that generation of Romantic writers. Christa Wolf, together with her husband Gerhard, has edited works by, and written about, Bettine, Günderrode and others; an essay on Bettine, ‘Nun ja! Das nächste Leben geht aber heute an’, accompanies a 1983 Insel reissue of Die Günderode, and this is preceded by her own work of compiling and editing a volume of Karoline von Günderrode’s works, Der Schatten eines Traumes (1979). This volume is prefaced by an essay with the same evocative title (‘the shadow of a dream’), from which the epigraph above is quoted. Wolf’s interest in this constellation of Romantic poets, who have been compared with the Bloomsbury group in the complexity of their interrelationships, although the Lake poets might provide a more contemporary comparison, is also reflected directly in her own 1979 narrative, Kein Ort Nirgends (No Place on Earth). She in turn cites the older GDR writer Anna Seghers’s mentioning of Günderrode in letters as a source of her own fascination with this era. Nor is such interest in women writers of an earlier generation an isolated example; further instances are Sigrid Damm’s recent biographical novels, or Sarah Kirsch and Elke Erb’s editions of Annette von Droste-Hülshoff in 1986 and 1989 respectively. Kirsch indeed goes further, weaving into her own poetry references to her literary antecedents: Bettina von Arnim, ‘die Droste’ and even the Brontë sisters, giving rise to the title of a volume of English translations of her poems, The Brontës Hats. The work of reclamation and recovery, and the conscious establishing of a ‘weibliche (= female) Tradition’, is thus nothing new. Nevertheless, the examples of Bettine and Günderrode raise a number of points about gender, genre and literary recognition, or ‘finding a voice’. One problem facing women writers until very recently was the difficulty of being recognized – and thus of being published – in their own right, or indeed under their own name: like Karoline von Günderrode, or\n\nIntroduction\n\nindeed George Eliot and George Sand, many took refuge behind a male pseudonym. There are two interrelated problems here: finding a voice, and finding an appropriate literary form in which to express it. The relatively restricted, narrowly circumscribed social roles women ‘enjoyed’ for much of the time-span covered by this volume makes the notion of selfexpression, taken for granted by writers today, somewhat ambivalent. For long periods of history, women were not expected – or indeed allowed – to participate in the public sphere, so that the whole notion of ‘publication’, presenting oneself to a literary (or literal) audience, becomes fraught with ambiguity. There is, then, a question of genre, as well as of gender, to be addressed here. The most ‘public’ of the three traditional literary genres – epic, lyric and dramatic – is the drama, a form which has traditionally dominated the German literary canon from the mid-eighteenth to the close of the nineteenth century. It will come as no surprise, then, that drama is the hardest sphere for women to penetrate, and, as a number of the contributors to this volume have pointed out, it is the sphere in which the smallest number of women have been active as writers, with fewer still achieving lasting recognition. Traditionally, women’s sphere has been seen as the private or domestic one, and accordingly, women writers are seen to fare better in prose fiction, which in nineteenth-century English literature becomes almost a female prerogative, and which gives much more scope to the depiction of a ‘private sphere’. In the ‘Age of Goethe’ (an epithet which speaks volumes!), as we have seen, Sophie La Roche and Bettine Brentano achieve a certain prominence in this genre; however, the form the novel takes on in Bettine’s hands, with its quasi-autobiographical diary- and letter-like outpourings, is perhaps indicative of where the women of the Romantic generations, at least, found their true medium. It is in the intimate yet practical sphere of this Briefkultur (letter-writing culture) that German women writers of the ‘modern’ era first achieve a form of eminence, communicating without primary thought of publication, and yet writing for a select readership of like-minded individuals. The epistolatory form, then, gives scope for blending autobiography with philosophy, conversation with criticism, and allows for a variety of perspectives to be presented via an ‘invisible’ narrator: it is small wonder that it proved such a popular form among women novelists of the eighteenth and early nineteenth century. The most intimate genre of all, of course, is generally considered to be\n\n7\n\n8\n\njo catling\n\nlyric poetry, although as an essentially personal genre, it is also arguably the most difficult in which to achieve recognition. Indeed, almost the only woman writer represented in the canon – Annette von Droste-Hülshoff (1797–1848), or ‘die Droste’, as she is affectionately but perhaps patronisingly known – typically owes her position to a short story rather than to her main activity, poetry. One may conjecture that, given the obstacles they encounter and the disincentives to seeking publicity, women writers through the ages have tended to favour more intimate forms and less traditional genres, such as letters and diaries, fragmentary or more ‘open’ forms, which may be seen as indicative of a (subconscious) unease with the prevailing traditional genres of their age. On the one hand, such unconscious unconventionality may go some way towards accounting for the lack of recognition experienced by many writers – male as well as female – who find themselves excluded or marginalized by the dominant cultural code; on the other hand, however, such cutting across the boundaries of traditional genres may be seen as an opportunity for opening up new, less formal possibilities of expression, some of which may only now be bearing fruit. In attempting to explain the apparent dearth of women authors in the German literary canon, then, we find ourselves somewhat in the position of Virginia Woolf contemplating women and fiction in A Room of One’s Own, inevitably led beyond a merely literary evaluation of well-known works to an inquiry into the social and historical circumstances governing the production and reception, and thus the ‘visibility’ or otherwise, of women’s writing. Furthermore, the role of patriarchal culture in the suppression or ignoring of women’s writing, together with the limited opportunities open to women, is now more widely acknowledged than has often been the case in the past, and is perhaps also more readily articulated by women writers themselves, as the superficially light-hearted example below demonstrates. In these introductory remarks I have tried to draw attention to some of the obstacles which the women writers whose works will be discussed in this volume have faced, and – to the extent that their works are available for us to read today – overcome. By way of illustration, and in answer to the question which formed the starting point for this project, we may quote the Jewish writer Mascha Kaléko. Writing in American exile in the mid-twentieth century, she comments on the problem of Die Leistungen der Frau in der Kultur (women’s cultural achievements) thus:\n\nIntroduction\n\nZu deutsch: ‘Die klägliche Leistung der Frau’. Meine Herren, wir sind im Bilde. Nun, Wagner hatte seine Cosima Und Heine seine Mathilde. Die Herren vom Fach haben allemal Einen vorwiegend weiblichen Schatz Was uns Frauen fehlt, ist ‘Des Künstlers Frau’ Oder gleichwertiger Ersatz. (K a l é k o , In meinen Träumen läutet es Sturm, 1981, p. 96)\n\nI.e.: ‘A woman’s pitiful contribution’. Yes, gentlemen, we’re in the picture. Well now, Wagner had his Cosima And Heine his Mathilde. All professional men can call upon A mainly female helpmate We women, though, have no ‘artist’s wife’ Or any substitute of equal weight. (translated by Anthony Vivis)\n\nThat this is not a new problem, or one which has entirely disappeared, should emerge as one of the recurring and unifying threads in the ‘patchwork quilt’ of the varied and multifaceted history of women’s writing in German-speaking countries from the Middle Ages to the present day which this volume seeks to present.\n\nNote on translations\n\nAs this book is aimed not just at GermanistInnen but at non-readers of German, care has been taken to include translations wherever possible. However, the ‘making visible’ of translations is a task even more complex than the uncovering of ‘invisible writing’, and as translation is both a continuous and a continual enterprise, some omissions are inevitable. The practice followed in this volume is to provide a translation of every German term or title mentioned in the text. Where a work has been translated into English, this is denoted by italicization of the translated title (in the case of poems and short stories, where a title would not normally be italicized, it is shown by the use of inverted commas and upper case). Where no translation is available, an English equivalent is given, in lower case and without inverted commas. As far as possible, details of available translations are listed in the\n\n9\n\n10\n\njo catling\n\nbibliography under the entry for the writer in question. It must be stressed, however, that this cannot claim to be comprehensive; there is a likelihood that some translations (particularly those published in the United States) will have slipped through the net. All translations of quotations in the text are by the author of that chapter, or, in rare cases, by the editor, except where otherwise stated.\n\nPart I\n\nBeginnings to 1700\n\nm a r g a r e t i v e s and almut suerbaum\n\n1\n\nThe Middle Ages\n\nAccording to Katharina M. Wilson in her excellent anthology Medieval Women Writers, for both men and women in the Middle Ages several conditions had to be fulfilled before literary productivity could take place. These included at least a certain level of education, leisure, access to the materials necessary for writing, patronage or other means of financial independence, and – true for writers in every century – something to communicate. ‘For women writers’, continues Wilson, ‘an added pre-requisite often entails the freedom from childbearing and repeated pregnancies’ (Wilson, p. ix). It is not therefore surprising that many of the earliest achievements by women of letters in German-speaking countries, whether in Latin or the vernacular, should spring from the ambience of the cloister. In the convents of the religious orders girls were taught to read the Psalter and to copy passages from the Bible, both of which presupposed instruction in Latin. In the seclusion of her cell or during the silences of the daily office a nun would have ample time to reflect on her own life and the mysteries of religion and, with a little encouragement, might indeed begin to write. In some cases, the convents produced highly trained female scribes, some of whom emerge as rather striking personalities. One of the earliest known female scribes who copied a book of Latin sermons in the second half of the twelfth century, known as the Guda-Homiliar (now held in Frankfurt) identifies herself in a rubric: ‘Guda, peccatrix mulier, scripsit et pinxit hunc librum’ (Guda, a sinful woman, wrote and illuminated this book). Despite the self-deprecating humility, this is a confident statement at a time when most scribes, whether women or men, remained anonymous; Guda is clearly aware of the importance and value of her work, and adds a picture of herself in the illuminated initial D – one of the earliest self-portraits of an artist.\n\n[13]\n\n14\n\nmargaret ives and almut suerbaum\n\nA similar tribute to such an achievement, this time by a contemporary, is paid to Gisela von Kerssenbrock, a Cistercian nun from Rulle in Northern Germany, who must have spent years of her life producing a lavishly illustrated gradual, now commonly known as Codex Gisle in recognition of her achievement. On the first folio, one of her contemporaries noted shortly after her death: Istud egregium librum scripsit, illuminavit, notavit, impaginavit, aureis litteris et pulchris imaginibus decoravit venerabilis ac devota virgo Gysela de Kerzenbroeck in sui memoriam Anno Mccc cuius anima requiescat in sancta pace. Amen. The venerable and pious Gisela of Kerssenbrock wrote, illuminated, annotated, paginated this excellent book and decorated it with gold letters and beautiful pictures, so that she might be remembered. AD 1300. May her soul rest in holy peace. Amen.\n\nNot only this note but also the illuminations testify to the selfconfidence of the nun who trusted she would be remembered by her own work: on the pages for Christmas and Easter, the two most important feast days and therefore the most lavishly decorated, she inserts the figures of kneeling nuns, one of whom is clearly identified in a rubric as ‘Gisle’. Gisela of Kerssenbrock and Guda are thus examples of women with sufficient education to be able to produce Latin liturgical manuscripts, but despite the high degree of literacy shown here, women did not normally have access to Latin learned traditions, which were the prerogative of the monasteries and hence equally inaccessible to most lay men. Nevertheless, there are female writers who defy the general trend. The significance of Latin and a knowledge of the classical canon can be seen in the work of Hrotsvit (also known as Roswitha) von Gandersheim, who has the distinction of being the first known Christian dramatist. Probably born in the fourth decade of the tenth century, she was a Saxon of noble lineage who entered the religious life at an early age and became a canoness of the abbey of Gandersheim in the Harz mountains. Here she also became acquainted with the works of Horace, Ovid, Statius, Lucan, Boethius, Terence and Virgil as well as with the early Christian Fathers and the Vulgate. Then – following, as she tells us, an inner compulsion which she perceived to be a gift of God – she too sought to express herself\n\nThe Middle Ages\n\nin Latin, the language of liturgy, learning and culture, and wrote some eight legends, six plays, two epics and a short poem, all of them inspired by her Christian faith and sense of mission. Her two epics depict Otto the Great (912–73) as an exemplary Christian ruler and his queens Edith and Adelheid as embodiments of Christian virtue. Although she describes herself as a weak woman of little scholarship, she is in all probability adopting here again the traditional medieval modesty topos in such utterances, since her material is wide-ranging and possesses a selfconfident authority. The entry for Hrotsvit in the Oxford Companion to German Literature (p. 732, under the alternative version of her name, Roswitha) lists her as the author of six Latin plays ‘intended as a Christian substitute for the comedies of Terence’. This statement needs elucidation. In one very important aspect these plays – Gallicanus, Dulcitius, Callimachus, Abraham, Pafnutius and Sapientia – can all be regarded as anti-Terentian tirades, not so much in style and structure as in content and message. Hrotsvit was incensed by the portrayal of women by the Latin dramatist as lewd, lascivious creatures forever seeking the attention of men and certainly no strangers to seduction. Her aim, as she tells us in a preface, is to establish a countermodel, that of the chaste Christian virgin, who can withstand all temptation, preferring martyrdom to the sacrifice of her integrity. Thus, in Dulcitius, three Christian maidens – Agape, Chionia, and Irene – refuse to honour pagan gods at the request of the Emperor Diocletian and foil the advances of their torturer, Dulcitius, who consequently has them put to death. In Callimachus, Drusiana, a respectable married lady, prays for death when confronted by the lustful Callimachus, and her wish is immediately granted. In Abraham and Pafnutius the theme is varied slightly. Abraham here is not the Biblical patriarch, but a hermit who has brought up a niece, Maria, in the silence and solitude of the desert. Nevertheless, when temptation comes her way, she is deceived and dishonoured and becomes a prostitute. Having tracked her down to a brothel, Abraham dons a disguise and seeks to win her back, asserting that God’s grace and mercy are open to all who genuinely repent. In Pafnutius two harlots are similarly reclaimed for God by two saintly male anchorites. Christian women, then, should aspire to be pure vessels for the reception of the Holy Spirit after the example of the Blessed Virgin, but – failing that – can draw solace from the story of Mary Magdalene, do penance and find salvation. It must be emphasized that, for Hrotsvit, the figures of Mary and the\n\n15\n\n16\n\nmargaret ives and almut suerbaum\n\nreformed Mary Magdalene genuinely represented a higher concept of womanhood. This in itself was not so startlingly original, since Jerome (342–420) had influenced much medieval thinking with his well-known condemnation of women as daughters of Eve, and his famous dictum ‘mors per Evam, vita per Mariam’ was understood, when applied to women, to mean that through vows of chastity and abstinence they could indeed redeem their fallen nature. What is particularly striking about Hrotsvit’s work is the assurance with which she proclaims that women have undeservedly been cast in the role of sinners, their natural inclination being to value integrity in both the physical and moral sense. Although in Abraham and Pafnutius it is acknowledged that men, too, can be chaste, in other plays the male characters are depicted as being at the mercy of their carnal appetites. Dulcitius is so ablaze with passion that, attempting to enter the prison of the virtuous Christian sisters after nightfall, he mistakenly embraces pots, pans and culinary utensils and becomes covered in dirt and grime. Even worse, Callimachus plans to violate the tomb of Drusiana, although – of course – he is prevented from doing so. Elsewhere in Hrotsvit’s dramas it is the women who transform their would-be seducers and convert them into true Christians. A good example is Gallicanus, where the eponymous pagan general is inspired by Constantia, daughter of the Emperor Constantine, to give up his hopes of marrying her and, like her, adopt a vow of chastity. All this may not appeal greatly to modern tastes, but it has to be seen in the context of its time as a powerful campaign for the enhancement of the status of women. Such a campaign was not without its dangers. Hrotsvit tells us that she sometimes had to blush with shame because, in the course of her dramatic dialogues, she occasionally had to depict the distasteful passions of forbidden love and reproduce unseemly conversations. The hint of necrophilia in Callimachus is a case in point; there are also lines in Abraham that speak of the desire of an old man for a young woman, while in Dulcitius there are vivid descriptions of the hapless man’s encounter with the kettle ! From an inserted introductory letter to her benefactors it is evident that Hrotsvit only completed this collection of plays after she had gained the express approval of her mentors, who praised and encouraged her. Since there was no established theatre in the tenth century, her plays were probably not performed. That even these moves towards Christian drama were, however, highly controversial is highlighted by remarks included in the Hortus deliciarum (Garden of delights) by Herrad of Hohenburg in\n\nThe Middle Ages\n\nthe late twelfth century. A compendium of reading matter for the education of nuns, compiled by the abbess of a convent in Alsace and famous for the way in which it integrates text, illustration and musical notation into an overall programme of the essentials of Christian doctrine as well as for the many minute details of everyday life contained within its structure, it voices strong reservations against the introduction of religious drama on the grounds that there is potential here for liturgical seriousness to degenerate into frivolous play. Nevertheless, Hrotsvit may justifiably be seen as a pioneer of German drama. Her works were rediscovered in 1501 by the humanist Conrad Celtis, and it is interesting that her two major themes – the woman who cannot be forced to surrender her integrity, and the penitent who finds salvation – foreshadow well-known classical works, such as Lessing’s ‘domestic tragedy’ Emilia Galotti (1772) and the ‘Gretchen tragedy’ of Goethe’s Faust. Her own memory lives on in contemporary drama in Peter Hacks’s re-interpretation of her comedies, Rosie träumt (1975). She went on to compose a short history of the convent of Gandersheim, where she had spent most of her life, and a life of Emperor Otto I. This piece of commissioned official biography shows most clearly the esteem in which she must by then have been held, and in dealing with contemporary matters, Hrotsvit had to rely on her own individuality as a writer – an existence which, despite all acknowledged difficulties, she clearly enjoyed. The distinction of being the first woman to write in German whose name has come down to us belongs to ‘Frau Ava’; in an epilogue to her writings, she reveals that she is the mother of two sons, one of whom had predeceased her. She may be identical with the highly respected anchoress Ava whose death in 1127 is recorded in the annals of the monastery at Melk. If so, this is another example of a woman for whom the seclusion of the religious life offered the freedom to write, although the epilogue also stresses the encouragement and advice received from her sons. Her oeuvre, written for a lay audience interested in devotional reading, but unable to do so in Latin, consists of a group of five narrative poems which together form a history of human salvation through time. She begins with the life of St John the Baptist, the precursor of Christ, moves on to a vividly narrated life of Christ, and concludes – in short poems on the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit, the Anti-Christ and the Last Judgement – with a vista of the end of the world and the possibility of salvation. The centrepiece, the life of Christ, is based mainly on the accounts of the Gospels as they would have been read out in church during the year, but Ava’s\n\n17\n\n18\n\nmargaret ives and almut suerbaum\n\nnarrative has certain distinctive characteristics; she focuses, with obvious interest, on the female figures, selecting the Biblical stories of Christ’s encounters with women in preference to other episodes. Her narrative style is vivid, especially when she describes gestures and settings, giving us the first German account of the ox and ass surrounding the manger in the Nativity scene. At times, the way in which she evokes images appears reminiscent of religious drama. In an Age of Faith such as the Middle Ages, the claim that one had a God-given talent to depict the lives of the saints and martyrs or to proclaim the Gospel had to be respected. Similarly, a woman who claimed to be inspired by the Holy Spirit could not be dismissed out of hand, even if her revelations challenged traditional notions. An outstanding example of such inspiration is Hildegard von Bingen (1098–1179), sometimes known as the ‘Sibyl of the Rhine’. Of noble birth, she reports in an autobiographical fragment that she experienced her first visions at the age of three and, clearly a gifted child, she was placed by her parents at the age of eight in a convent of the Benedictine order where she received her education. In 1136 she was unanimously chosen as Mother Superior and some five years later, in 1141, took the decisive step of revealing her prophetic insights to the world. A voice told her to write down what she had seen in her visions: she was reluctant at first to do so, but then fell into a debilitating illness, from which she only recovered when she resolved to follow her inner compulsion. Employing a scholarly monk to help her with Latin grammar, she began work on her first book Scivias (Know the ways), and during a visit of Pope Eugene to Trier sent him some extracts from the manuscript, which obtained his blessing. Armed with this authority, she completed Scivias, which she divided into three parts, the first containing visions of God the Father as creator of the universe, the second concentrating on Christ and His message of salvation, and the third – on the analogy of the Trinity – focusing on the power of the Holy Spirit to shape and transform our lives. After this Hildegard went from strength to strength. Her second great religious work, the Liber vitae meritorum (Book of life’s merits), was finished between 1158 and 1163 and is a treatise on the Christian virtues in contrast to worldly sins and vices. The Liber divinorum operum (Book of divine works), compiled between 1163 and 1173, is, on the other hand, a mystic insight into the nature of the Universe, in which the fully harmonious human being, the crown of God’s creation, draws strength from the natural world which, in turn, is spiritualized and lifted back to God. Her interest in plants and animals, coupled with her keen\n\nThe Middle Ages\n\npowers of observation, also enabled her to produce two scientific manuals, the first, Physica (Physics), being a handbook on nature, while the second and better-known Causae et Curae (Causes and cures), a textbook on medicine, contributed to her reputation as a physician and healer. Recognized in her own lifetime as a person of great spirituality and wisdom, she did not hesitate to comment on contemporary events or to rebuke kings and princes. According to Hozeski, in the preface to his English translation of Scivias, Hildegard foresaw ‘that the abuse of political power and the corrupt government of the episcopal electors and princely abbots was exasperating the Germans and that the volatile situation would eventually burst into flames such as the Reformation or the Thirty Years War’ (Hozeski, p. xxx). Hozeski also quotes the opinion of the Dominican theologian Matthew Fox that, had she been a man, Hildegard would have been one of the most famous people in the history of humanity. Be that as it may, Scivias certainly has the authoritative tone of a new Revelation. The visions are followed by detailed commentaries: the finale is apocalyptic in its prophecy. At the end of the world, according to Hildegard, the elements will be destroyed: ‘fire will burst forth, the air will be dissolved, water will pour forth, the land will shake, flashes of lightning will seethe, claps of thunder will clash loudly, mountains will be torn asunder, forests will fall down, and whatever is mortal in the air or in the water or on the land will give back its life’ (Hozeski, p. 367). For all their force and power, however, Hildegard maintains that she received her messages not in a state of ecstasy, but from a deep source within her soul. As she writes in a famous letter, ‘I do not hear these things with my external ears; nor do I perceive them by the thoughts of my heart, nor by any combination of my five senses – but rather in my soul, with my external eyes open, so that I have never suffered the weakness of ecstasy in them, but alertly see them by day and by night’ (Wilson, p. 123). In this she differed from other religious women who, particularly in the following century, experienced in dreams or trance-like states what they describe as a rapturous union with Divine Love. Foremost among these ecstatic visionaries writing in Germany is Mechthild von Magdeburg, who was probably born sometime between 1207 and 1212 and who died at Helfta in 1282. Unlike Hildegard, she was not formally professed as a member of a religious order, but settled in Magdeburg as a beguine, and wrote not in Latin, but in the vernacular. Her sole work, Das fließende Licht der Gottheit (Flowing Light of the Divinity), is an extraordinary collection of poems, prayers, aphorisms and dialogues\n\n19\n\n20\n\nmargaret ives and almut suerbaum\n\nbetween the soul and her Divine Lover. Mechthild, too, writes out of a profound conviction that God Himself had chosen her as a new apostle. In answer to a monk who expressed astonishment at her audacity, she asked him if he could explain ‘how it came about that the apostles themselves, who were at first so timid and afraid, grew to be so bold after they had received the Holy Spirit’. Like Hildegard, she claims that she was commanded to write her book. It is not, however, an easy book to follow. It has, she says, to be read at least nine times, and always with due reverence and humility. Its central message is that it is natural for the soul to crave God, but God Himself also craves the human soul, and in the highest states of ecstasy a mystic union becomes possible. In such states, she writes, ‘eye shines to eye, spirit flows to spirit, hand seeks hand, mouth seeks mouth, and one heart greets another’. God’s love for the soul is indeed overwhelming, and Mechthild struggles to find adequate images. Thus, as her title suggests, God is an ever-flowing radiance, an ever-buoyant flood-tide, the Divine illuminates the soul as sunlight shining upon gold or water, the Divine music is a music to which all hearts must dance. This is, even for its time, bold and unconventional language, and it offended a good many people. Mechthild’s passionate evocation of the Divine courtship led to accusations of obscenity, and towards the end of her life she was obliged to seek refuge in the Cistercian convent at Helfta, where she found other mystics of a similar persuasion. Her work, originally written in Low German, was later translated into Middle High German by Heinrich von Nördlingen and in this form was undoubtedly known to both Margarete and Christine Ebner (see p. 23 below). Different though these two remarkable women were, Hildegard and Mechthild do share certain features. Like Hrotsvit, both denigrate their authorship. Hildegard tells us that she is ‘a poor little female’ and Mechthild often describes herself as ‘a sinful woman’ who is ashamed that she cannot find better words to express heavenly splendours. There may, however, be subtle irony at work here. By conceding their weakness, both women acknowledge the structure of the patriarchal society in which they lived, while at the same time evoking scriptural sanction for their activities. It is precisely because, as women, they are of low degree and thus more humble and obedient that the Holy Spirit has deigned to reveal to them new ways of truth and love. Both could cite here the words of the Magnificat (Luke 1: 46–55), and as Barbara Newman has pointed out in her excellent study on Hildegard, Sister of Wisdom (1987), Mary the Mother of God occupies a central place in Hildegard’s theology. Versed as she was\n\nThe Middle Ages\n\nin liturgy and Church tradition, Hildegard seems to have seen some of the topoi of theological debate not as abstract concepts, but as larger-than-life allegorical figures, many of them female. Sapientia (Wisdom), Caritas (Divine Love) and Ecclesia (the Church) are all personified in her writings, and all are grouped round the pivotal figure of Mary, by whom ‘the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth’ (John 1: 14). It is through the purity, humility and obedience of Mary that the Incarnation, and hence the Redemption, is possible. Following on from this it is only through a feminine response to the Divine Nature that Creation itself comes into being. Hence Sapientia is identified with the great creative force flowing throughout the universe which gives birth to all things; Caritas is depicted as a female figure responsive to God and, like Ecclesia, often pregnant with generations to come; and all three, together with Mary, can be taken as what Newman calls ‘cosmic theophanies of the feminine; and the purpose of the feminine is to manifest God in the world’ (Newman, p. 160). If Hildegard thus draws the attention of her contemporaries to the feminine principle inherent in the Divine mystery, Mechthild von Magdeburg personalizes it in the account of her own relationship with God. Her God is no stern authoritarian, sitting in judgement. He is, rather, an ardent wooer of the human soul, delighted if the latter reciprocates his feelings. As one of Mechthild’s poems expresses it, ‘You (i.e. the soul) are a light before my eyes, a harp to my ears.’ Or again, the soul is said by God to ‘taste like the grape, to have the fragrance of balm, to shine like the sun’ and to be ‘the rose on the thornbush’. Yet not all human souls surrender to these endearments. Indeed, only the truly humble can be truly receptive, and these are much more likely to be women rather than men. Mechthild is often quite emphatic that it is difficult for men per se to find God. ‘Alas!’ she laments in one of her frequent outbursts ‘here is one thing that many a man of excellent education and clever natural talent finds impossible, and that is to dare to surrender himself to the power of naked Divine Love. . .’ Although subsequently canonized by the Church, it is easy to see why Hildegard, Mechthild and other women mystics provoked so much controversy. Both Hildegard and Mechthild speak out very strongly against the male-dominated Church establishment of their day, which they condemn as corrupt and anti-Christian. One of Hildegard’s most terrifying visions concerns ‘a woman of such exquisite sweetness and of such rare and delightful beauty that the human mind could by no means comprehend it’.\n\n21\n\n22\n\nmargaret ives and almut suerbaum\n\nThis is Ecclesia, who is dressed ‘in a shining robe of white silk and wrapped in a mantle trimmed with the most precious gems – emerald, sapphire and pearls . . . Yet her face was spattered with dust and her robe torn . . . her mantle had lost its elegance, and her shoes were blackened with mud.’ In her anguish and distress Ecclesia complains that she has been betrayed by ‘my foster-fathers – the priests ! – they who should have made me beautiful in every part have despoiled me in all !’ (Newman, p. 241). Mechthild is no less extreme. ‘Alas ! Crown of Holy Church, how tarnished you have become ! Your precious stones have fallen from you because you are weak and you disgrace the holy Christian faith. Your gold is sullied in the filth of unchastity, for you have become destitute and do not know true love . . . Whoever does not know the way to hell, let him behold the depraved priesthood, how its path goes straight to hell with women and children and other public sins’ (Wilson, p. 170). Another vivid source of controversy is the explicit sexual language. It may well be that medieval times were not as prudish or as squeamish as our own. Hildegard, in her medical treatises, writes quite openly about menstruation and other gynaecological topics, although admittedly in Latin. Yet her vision of Ecclesia assaulted by Antichrist, again in Latin, verges on the pornographic. ‘That feminine figure which I had formerly seen before the altar in the sight of God now appeared to me again, so that this time I could see her below the navel as well. For from her navel down to the place where a woman’s sex is recognized, she had variegated scaly patches, and in place of her privy parts there appeared a monstrous black head with fiery eyes, asses’ ears, and the nose and mouth of a lion gaping wide, horribly gnashing and sharpening its terrible iron teeth’ (Newman, p. 245). Nevertheless, given the traditions of medieval iconography, this is probably less difficult to take than Mechthild’s erotic descriptions of divine love-play. ‘For He then steals away with her to a secret place . . . for He wishes to play games with her, games that the body does not understand, nor the peasant at his plough, nor the knight at his tournament, nor even his loving mother Mary. And after this ecstasy the soul sighs with all her might, so that the whole body is shaken.’ Neither Hildegard nor Mechthild is an isolated example. A book of visions by Hildegard’s contemporary and fellow Benedictine Elisabeth von Schönau extols Mary as a paradigm for all Christians, even portraying her at one point as a priest at the altar. Elisabeth also wrote a life of St Ursula which contributed to the widespread veneration of that saint in the Cologne area. In the convent of Helfta, as already mentioned, Gertrud\n\nThe Middle Ages\n\nvon Helfta, Gertrud von Hackeborn, and Mechthild von Hackeborn all wrote treatises on the religious life, stressing in particular the virtues of obedience and humility and initiating the adoration of the Sacred Heart as a special form of Christian devotion. All these works are in Latin. A little later, at Engelthal, the Dominican nun Christine Ebner recorded the lives and mystical visions of her sister nuns in a German work, Von der Gnaden Überlast (On the over-abundance of grace), while at the abbey of Medingen, near Donauwörth, Margarete Ebner – no relation of the former – corresponded with the priest Heinrich von Nördlingen on spiritual matters, and, through him, became very influential among the Gottesfreunde (friends of God), a religious community with adherents in Strasbourg and Basel. From all this it can be seen that women made a very substantial contribution to religious thought and practice during the medieval period and in doing so explored many forms of literary expression. History, biography, theology and medicine are among the scholarly topics covered by their works, while the prophetic visions and rhapsodic flights of the soul towards Heaven, whatever their cause or origin, resulted in devotional poetry and meditation of outstanding beauty and eloquence. Yet, as the Age of Faith receded, much was overlooked or forgotten. Even today, their views are not always regarded as acceptable. The attempt, from Hildegard onwards, to work out a theology of the feminine which sees certain aspects of the great drama of Creator and Creation as essentially female is still regarded in some circles as verging on heresy or even blasphemy. Nevertheless, its presence as an underground current in German mysticism, literature and thought cannot be questioned. When, at the end of Faust II, Goethe evokes ‘das Ewig-Weibliche’ (the Eternal Feminine) he is again acknowledging that receptivity to the divine Creator expressed in humility, reverence, loving-kindness and service – that is to say, those values which are held to be female prerogatives – is the only sure way of achieving spiritual significance. (It is of course ironic that Faust, in his very masculine goal-orientated striving, fails to understand this as he rushes headlong through life.) When, in the early twentieth century, Rilke speaks of ‘the eternal torrent’ (Leishman’s translation of ‘die ewige Strömung’) in the Duineser Elegien (Duino Elegies; 1923), or uses the metaphor of the dance in some of the Sonette an Orpheus (Sonnets to Orpheus), this may be seen as a continuation of a long line of contemplatives and charismatics, linking back to Mechthild von Magdeburg’s unequivocal assurance of God as the fountain-head of all being and inexhaustible source of joy. ‘I will dance if you will lead’ she exclaims. ‘I leap\n\n23\n\n24\n\nmargaret ives and almut suerbaum\n\nup into the Divine.’ It is a supreme expression of that superbly confident religious faith which must constantly find new outlets for itself in language and music. Apart from the religious houses, the secular courts are the other important sphere in which German literature developed, and again, women play their part, even if not in quite the same way as in France. From Carolingian times onwards, women exerted their influence as patrons of literature, and in the period of Hrotsvit’s life, we can see a whole group of important female patrons: Adelheid, the second wife of Otto I, supported Ekkehard IV of St Gall, while her daughter Mathilde, as abbess of Quedlinburg, commissioned important manuscripts and a chronicle of the Saxons, dedicated to her; Gerberga, the niece of Otto I, was not only Hrotsvit’s abbess, but also acted as her friend and adviser. In the twelfth century, with the rise of secular literature as courtly entertainment in France, it is again female patrons – often French-born wives of German noblemen – who are influential in introducing these new developments into Germany, but whereas in France, noblewomen are writers as well as patrons, there is no evidence for women taking such an active role as writers in Germany. Around 1170, the cleric Konrad was commissioned by Mathilde, wife of Henry of Brunswick (= Heinrich der Löwe) and daughter of Eleanor of Aquitaine, to translate the Chanson de Roland into German. This is more than the desire of an educated noblewoman for appropriate reading matter, since the genre of the chanson de geste had been used in France as a literary means to justify political power of the ruling family; through her mother, Mathilde was almost certainly aware of the way in which literary patronage could be used thus to enhance the importance of the secular courts. In the development of French courtly literature, the central concept is that of amour courtois (courtly love). The love-relationship is expressed in images and metaphors drawn from the contemporary social structures of feudal service, so that the lady assumes the part of the liege-lord in whose power it lies to grant favours and acknowledge the service of the vassal. Although the theme itself is quickly taken up in German literature, it is adapted only in forms which suppress the potential tension between such an elevated image of the all-powerful feudal lady, and the actual political and social reality of male domination over women. Whereas in France women could occasionally wield considerable political power in their own right, and were also able, as writers and poets (for\n\nThe Middle Ages\n\nexample Marie de France or the trobadora Beatriz de Diaz), to comment on the problems of women, or, as rulers and patrons, to feature as the supreme judge in cases of fictional amorous disputes, there is no evidence for parallel developments in Germany. On the whole, women appear to have been restricted to a more passive role until much later, so that the first woman to achieve similar independence within a courtly setting is Elisabeth von Nassau-Saarbrücken. After the death of her husband in 1429, she governed the duchy of Saarbrücken until 1438, when her son was old enough to take over. During the same period, she also engaged in literary activity and translated four French chansons de geste into German prose. Again, family connections provided the source and perhaps the inspiration, because the French versions of these chansons had been copied for Elisabeth’s mother, Margarethe of Vaudémont and Joinville, in 1405, and Elisabeth later revised and corrected her translation checking it against another French copy procured by her son in Paris. In literary terms, Elisabeth’s four epics are not much more than faithful renditions which follow her French – verse – sources closely in most details, even where references to rhyme and verse no longer make sense in German prose. While her prime interest was clearly to introduce these stories – about the knight Herpin and his sons, the two brothers Loher und Maller, Hug Schapel, the ficticious heir to the Carolingian throne, and Sibille, the innocent wife of Charlemagne maliciously persecuted by her husband – to the court at Saarbrücken, in so doing, she laid the foundations of a new genre which had already enjoyed a head start in France, that of the prose romance. These beginnings were developed further by Eleonore of Austria (also known as Eleonore of Scotland, since she is the daughter of James I of Scotland). Her translation of the French Pontus et Sidonie was undertaken ‘to please her husband Sigismund’, and to assist him in his attempt to emulate the example of the Italian courts by attracting humanist scholars and writers. Her achievements were acknowledged by Andreas Silvius Piccolomini, one of the most important German humanists at the time. Pontus und Sidonia, the love-story of the prince of Galicia and his future bride, quickly achieved widespread literary success, and its special appeal lies not so much in the adventures of the chivalrous hero as in the extended and often vivid depictions of courtly ceremony and everyday life. Pontus is well-bred, courteous and possesses exquisite table manners, and he marks the shift towards a truly modern novel which features an early aristocrat instead of the traditional knight.\n\n25\n\n26\n\nmargaret ives and almut suerbaum\n\nCompared to their French counterparts, German women took much longer to assert their creative influence, but when Elisabeth of NassauSaarbrücken and Eleonore of Austria began their work, they helped to introduce to German literature the genre of the prose romance, precursor of the novel which was to prove so overwhelmingly successful in centuries to come.\n\nhelen watanabe-o’kelly\n\n2\n\nWomen’s writing in the early modern period\n\nThe material\n\nOur picture of writing by women in this period is necessarily determined by the texts which have come down to us. In a period when only those manuscripts which had a legal, political or bureaucratic relevance were systematically preserved, it is a matter of pure chance if writing by women is preserved in manuscript form. While there are more manuscript letters, diaries and chronicles in court and convent archives than was formerly thought, it is published writing by women which had the greatest chance of survival. But women usually had no access to printers or publishers – indeed it is questionable whether it was considered suitable for them to publish their work at all – so it needed the agency of a male relative or mentor, often only after the writer’s death, for their work to get into print. The poetry of Catharina Regina von Greiffenberg was first published thanks to her guardian, step-uncle and later husband Hans Rudolf von Greiffenberg, Sibylle Schwarz was published thanks to her tutor Samuel Gerlach and it was a grandson who published the work of Margaretha Susanna von Kuntsch. In the two latter cases publication was posthumous, so the writers had no control whatever over the published form of their work. It is at least probable that the male relatives or mentors instrumental in the publication edited and emended the texts, so that the final product does not have the status of the oeuvre of a modern woman writer. We must also assume that these male editors selected which works to publish and that they may have suppressed material which did not conform to the forms and themes considered suitable for women. Sometimes a male writer gives an intimation of activity by women in an area where it is in general unsuspected. In his account of the\n\n[27]\n\n28\n\nhelen watanabe-o’kelly\n\nwork of the Mastersingers entitled Von der Musica and preserved in manuscript in Breslau, Wolfhart Spangenberg tells of one Susanna Granerin, the daughter of a Mastersinger, who composed a song each New Year and in her will left money to the Mastersingers’ guild in Strasbourg. Even where women published their work, it can be difficult nowadays to establish its authorship. Women took refuge under pseudonyms, for example Aramena, the still unknown author of the novel Die Durchlauchtigste Margaretha von Oesterreich which appeared in Hamburg in 1716. Women’s work also frequently appeared under men’s names, for example, the contributions of Sibylle Ursula von Braunschweig-Lüneburg to her more famous brother Anton Ulrich’s novels. One must in general be aware of the existence of a writer before either looking for or finding work by that writer – the problem of the invisibility of women. Until Birgit Neugebauer came on an occasional poem by an unknown poet who signed herself ‘Agnes Heinhold / Geborne Schickartin’ in the prefatory material to the published text of Sibylle Schuster’s play Ophiletes, no one knew of the existence of Heinhold. Neugebauer then unearthed a further sixteen, mostly published, writings by Heinhold and made them available in 1991, and it is likely, now that scholars are aware of Heinhold’s existence, that more will come to light. Systematic searching will undoubtedly reveal authors hitherto unknown to us. It can therefore be seen that the printed material actually known to us at present represents only an unknown proportion of what women actually wrote. Social and historical factors\n\nSince pregnancy accounted for the high mortality of women between the ages of twenty and fifty when compared to men, female biology must be taken into account when discussing literary production. The physical exhaustion caused by multiple pregnancies, miscarriages and difficult labours and the emotional exhaustion caused by the constant deaths of infants and children also account for the fact that most writing by women is the work either of childless women such as Greiffenberg or of widows such as Elisabeth von Braunschweig-Lüneburg or Anna Ovena Hoyers. Even those women who were childless were fully occupied with the endless tasks of early modern housekeeping. Many women, it is clear, simply did not have the leisure or the conditions in which to write.\n\nThe early modern period\n\nWe must also ask whether they were literate in the first place. Around five to ten per cent of the total population in sixteenth- and seventeenthcentury Germany is estimated as being literate, though it is not always easy to define what literate means. While this percentage varied from region to region and increased as the period progressed, we can assume that literacy was highest among upper-class men and lowest among lower-class women. In her pioneering study of reading material for German girls in this period, The Maiden’s Mirror, Cornelia Niekus-Moore shows how girls were educated with the sole aim of making them better wives and mothers. This was true of girls of all social classes. Girls of the aristocracy and middle class were more likely to be educated at home than sent to school and where girls did go to school – something which was usually only possible in the towns anyway – a few hours a day for a maximum of two years was often considered sufficient. Knowledge in general, apart from a knowledge of housekeeping, was considered unnecessary, indeed burdensome to girls. The only social class to provide a more thorough education for its daughters was, according to Niekus-Moore, ‘the educated and learned bourgeoisie, the families of pastors, teachers, scholars, and government officials’ (The Maidens’ Mirror, p. 50). There was furthermore the fact that Latin was the learned language of the age, the language of science, of educated discourse, even of literature, and that well into the eighteenth century the majority of all writing published in the German-speaking world was in Latin. Few women knew Latin and if they tried to learn it were told, as Kuntsch was by her parents in the 1660s, that this was more suitable for a great lady than for a middleclass girl, whereupon they had to give it up again. Since all educated men of the period wrote in Latin, sometimes instead of but virtually always as well as in German, one whole aspect of the literary life of the period was by definition closed to women. Women were also debarred from undertaking the kind of travel which was a standard part of the education of young men who aspired to learning. But what of the Renaissance? Surely this meant an opening up of learning and a dissemination of it via the printing-press, a new stress on the individual and his or her development and a questioning of timehonoured assumptions? Surely the ideals of learning for its own sake and artistic endeavour embraced both men and women equally? It is well known that the Renaissance in France, Italy, England, Spain and other countries produced numerous learned and cultivated women. But education only made women into writers if, as Katharina Wilson says, they had\n\n29\n\n30\n\nhelen watanabe-o’kelly\n\n‘some financial independence, access to source materials and books, some encouragement and/or religious, political or social zeal’ (Wilson, Women Writers of the Renaissance and Reformation, p. xvii). North of the Alps in the German-speaking world, Agrippa of Nettesheim (1486–1535) was the first German Humanist to sum up the debate on women, their abilities and their rights in his De nobilitate et praecellentia foeminei sexus (1509). His title, ‘On the Nobility and Pre-eminence of the Female Sex’, already announces his belief that women, far from being inferior beings to men, are in fact superior. Women are capable of learning and of literary production and Agrippa is able to support this with quotations from the Bible and the Ancients. A scholar of even greater prestige, namely Erasmus of Rotterdam (1467?-1536), took the debate further in such dialogues as The New Mother in which he has a feminist argue women’s superiority, A Girl with no Interest in Marriage, in which a girl wants to be a nun, and The Abbot and the Learned Lady, where a woman who loves learning is contrasted with a boorish ignorant abbot who wants to stamp out learning everywhere (Jordan, Renaissance Feminism, pp. 56f.). The learned lady of the dialogue is usually identified as Margaret More Roper, the daughter of Erasmus’s friend Thomas More, and among the examples of other learned women she mentions are the Pirckheimer girls in Germany. Barbara Pirckheimer was the eldest child of Dr Johannes Pirckheimer and the sister of the distinguished Humanist Willibald Pirckheimer. At the age of twelve she was sent to the convent of the sisters of St Clare in Nuremberg, the so-called Klarakloster, noted for its learning and holiness and as a school for patrician girls. Here she took the veil around 1483 and by 1485 at the latest she had adopted the name of Caritas. She was a woman of great learning, adept in Latin, well known to the Humanists of her day, with many of whom she corresponded. In 1503 she was elected abbess of the convent. Three of her younger sisters who had also become nuns served their convents in the same capacity. Willibald’s friend the Humanist Conrad Celtis saw Caritas, with whom he corresponded in Latin, as the German counterpart of the learned women he had encountered in Italy. Since the Latin writings of the medieval nun Hrotsvit von Gandersheim had been discovered in Regensburg in 1494, Celtis was able to refer to Caritas as the ‘new Hrotsvit’ as part of a German nationalist effort to prove Germany the equal of Italy intellectually. While Caritas was not the only German woman to be admitted to Humanist circles – we might mention Conrad Peutinger’s wife Margarethe and his two daugh-\n\nThe early modern period\n\nters Juliana and Konstanze – unlike the Peutinger women her position as a nun gave her an independence and a standing which they lacked. But in the German-speaking world the Renaissance led to the Reformation and Caritas Pirckheimer herself provides an excellent illustration of the negative effects of the Reformation on those women seeking an intellectual life. The Reformation was indeed a movement intended by Luther and other early Reformers to empower the ordinary person in the pew, to take religion out of the exclusive control of a priestly class and to open it up even to the unlettered believer, to put the Bible in the vernacular into the hands of all and to stress the importance of the laity over the clergy as enunciated in the doctrine of the priesthood of all believers. Such an apparently democratic movement, it seems, must have empowered women. But Luther’s radical ideas with regard to church organization did not necessarily extend to political or social structures, as can be seen in his condemnation of the Peasants’ Revolt in 1525. Luther gave marriage such a central importance in his moral and social teaching that he went so far as to present marriage and childbearing as the only destiny for women in Ein Sermon von dem ehlichen Stand (A sermon on the married estate; 1519); and Vom ehelichen Leben (On married life; 1522), though he was well aware that child-bearing could lead to the death of the mother, as the 1525 Predigt vom Ehestand (Sermon on the married estate) shows. The celibate life of clerics and nuns was frowned upon and the convents were to be thrown open. If we bear in mind that the convent was the only space available to women where they could be completely free of their biology and where they were not just allowed but encouraged to read, write, study and pray, we can see what a retrograde step this was for them. By 1524 the Klarakloster was fighting for its existence in Reformation Nuremberg. In the memoirs she wrote in German, the so-called Denkwürdigkeiten, Caritas Pirckheimer chronicles the pressures and harassment to which her convent was subjected and which she as abbess had to withstand. Through the agency of Melanchthon in 1525 the convent was allowed to continue in existence but was doomed to extinction because of a prohibition against the admission of novices. Nor could the nuns receive the sacraments according to the old rites. Caritas died there in 1532 aged sixty-six, a woman whose learning was made possible by her life as a nun. In general, the Reformation reduced women’s participation in public life, in the guilds, in trade, etc. and restricted their sphere to the home, to child-bearing and rearing and household management. Simultaneously\n\n31\n\n32\n\nhelen watanabe-o’kelly\n\nthe Reformation re-affirmed the father as head of the household, almost as the priest within his own household. He therefore was to be the sole fount of knowledge for his wife, should she need instruction. In consequence only those women who came from an intellectual family, in whose discussions and reading they were allowed to participate, had a chance of acquiring learning. Examples are Sibylle Schwarz, who was allowed access to the professors of Greifswald University who were her father’s friends, and Maria Cunitz (1610–64), the remarkable astronomer who was the daughter of an astronomer and clearly engaged in astronomical research with her husband. But were there not important women Reformers? Certainly there were women who worked and fought to further the cause of the Reformation. We might mention Katharina Zell (1497/8–1562) in Strasbourg, one of the first women to marry a Reformed priest, and Argula von Grumbach in Bavaria, who wrote a number of Reformation pamphlets in 1523–4. There was also Elisabeth, Duchess of Braunschweig-Lüneburg, who wrote and worked publicly for Reform during the years of her Regency, 1540–5, as did many lesser women, who tried to convert their friends, disseminate pamphlets, etc. As the sixteenth century progressed, however, the formation of theological faculties in the new Protestant universities meant that religious interpretation was taken back into professional and therefore male hands and was carried on in an institution to which women by definition were not admitted. One of the main complaints of Anna Ovena Hoyers was precisely the exclusion of women from theological debate. The Reformation in the German-speaking world ensured, however, that at least one book in the vernacular was accessible to women – the Bible. German women were never forbidden to read the Bible for themselves as English women were in the Act of Parliament promulgated in 1543. On the positive side, we might single out two institutions which actually fostered writing by women, particularly in the latter half of our period: these were the courts and, from the middle of the seventeenth century, the more progressive language academies or ‘Sprachgesellschaften’. Women and literature\n\nAs well as the social and historical factors mentioned above, there were literary constraints on women too. Apart from their lack of access to the\n\nThe early modern period\n\nclassics in an age which legitimized vernacular literature by basing it on that of the ancient world, which drew its forms and themes from ancient writers and which made constant elegant allusion to them, there was a series of prohibitions, both written and unwritten, as to what women might write, indeed as to what they might read (Niekus-Moore, The Maiden’s Mirror, p. 189). The drama, where it was not the province of such male institutions as the Catholic orders and the boys’ grammar schools, partook of the morally dubious nature of the stage. The novel purveyed lies and was furthermore a dangerous foreign import. Secular love poetry, based as it was on Petrarch or on the Latin poets, contravened conventions about the sexual purity of women. If we put all these factors together, it is obvious what the bulk of writing by women must consist of: predominantly verse and within that, religious verse and occasional poetry; in the realm of prose, non-fiction and autobiographical writing, with novels only making their appearance from the second half of the seventeenth century. Drama is the genre where women’s contribution is smallest. Let us now examine each of these areas in turn. As just mentioned, verse is the pre-eminent genre employed by women. Poems can be small in scale and unpretentious in theme and form; they do not need the long-term concentrated work of a novel or the co-operation of actors and the existence of a theatre before they can be realized. They are complete in themselves, they can be produced in private and even women had familiar models to emulate: Biblical psalms in translation, hymns in the vernacular, satirical verse on broadsheets, didactic verse in emblems and on gravestones, folksongs, as well as the occasional poetry familiar to all at weddings, christenings and in funeral sermons. Of all forms poetry was the one women could most easily practise in private and without censure. While the patchy nature of the known extant material must be taken into account, the multiplicity of forms which women’s verse takes in this period is indicative of the fact that each poet is embarking on a unique journey by an unauthorized route and without companions, with no sense of a tradition to fall back on. The family likeness, the common images, the line of development one can see from one generation of male poets to the next, from Opitz to Gryphius to Hofmannswaldau to Günther, for example, is wholly lacking from one female poet to the next. To illustrate this we shall look briefly at the work of four female poets: Anna Ovena Hoyers, Sibylle Schwarz, Catharina Regina von Greiffenberg and Margaretha Susanna von Kuntsch.\n\n33\n\n34\n\nhelen watanabe-o’kelly\n\nAs we know from Becker-Cantarino’s research, Anna Ovena Hoyers was born in the Duchy of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp as the daughter of Hans Ovens, was orphaned young and was a considerable heiress when she married Hermann Hoyers in 1599 at the age of fifteen. The marriage appears to have been a happy one and she bore her husband at least nine children. He died in 1622 and in the course of the next ten years, Hoyers lost a large part of her fortune through law-suits and taxes. It was, however, her deviant religious views which led to her unsettled existence from 1632 and her ultimate refuge in Sweden. Central to her life during the years after her husband’s death was her involvement with nonconformist groups. Such ‘alternative’ Christians, usually led by one charismatic figure, came together in small groups to practise a much more individualistic and mystical Christianity than the orthodox churches, of whatever persuasion, were prepared to allow. The movement towards Reform, itself so revolutionary and anti-orthodox in the early Reformation years, had hardened into two institutionalized churches, Lutheran and Calvinist. By Hoyers’s day, each of them had evolved a set of official beliefs and practices of which the theological faculties in the new Protestant universities were the guardians. The same faculties pronounced on which sects and writings were to be banned as heretical. It is clear that by the 1620s Hoyers was reading a great deal of such banned material which circulated secretly among believers. By 1623 a group of believers had collected round the lay preachers Nicolaus Knutzen Tetzing and Hartwig Lohmann on Hoyers’s estate at Hoyersworth. They were both called to order by the Lutheran authorities and had to flee, first to other towns in Schleswig-Holstein and afterwards to Denmark. Hoyers was able to remain in the area under the protection of the Dowager Duchess Augusta of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp and carried on holding private prayer meetings and worship as before. On the death of her uncle in 1630 she lost her last family protector and from 1632 seems to have moved around in North Germany. We know that she was in Sweden by 1643,"
