        "text": "Editor's note: This is the fourth in a series of stories, originally published in June 2020, chronicling the history of Washington County public high school volleyball.\n\nIn the second half of the 2000s, a new generation of coaches would begin to make their marks on Washington County volleyball.\n\nIn 2007, Megan Crawford — in her second season as head coach after playing on Williamsport's 1999 championship team — led a North Hagerstown squad featuring middle hitter Kate Zimmer and setter Hannah Boward to the Class 3A state final.\n\n“I came in and there was a good core group of girls there,” said Crawford. “I think my first two years, we had Zimmer and we had a great record. You're fortunate when you have athletes who are already there for you. It's just my job to put them in positions to be successful.”\n\nAlso in 2007, Boonsboro — coached by Andrea Parry — led a group including Tara Garver, Katie Gantz and Alison Griffith to the Class 1A state final. The Warriors defeated Williamsport in five sets in the region final after losing to the Wildcats in five sets twice in the regular season.\n\nRachel Bachtell, who played on Smithsburg's 1998 state title-winning team, returned as the Leopards' head coach in 2004 — “My biggest fear was I didn’t want to run Smithsburg volleyball into the ground,” she said.\n\nBachtell went 43-36 in her first five seasons (04-08), before a talented group that included Sara Rishell, Colleen Black, Taylor Belella and Katie Sprecher led the Leopards to back-to-back undefeated seasons in 2009-10.\n\n“When Sara was a freshman in the playoffs (in 2007), we upset Clear Spring and then lost at Fort Hill but played them tough,” said Bachtell. “I thought the tides were turning a little bit because I had seen those freshmen and I thought they were special.”\n\n“My first year I played (as a defensive specialist), and then I started setting,” said Belella, who would later lead South Hagerstown's program. “My freshman year, I think we were maybe .500, and the same my sophomore year, and then the last two years we didn't drop a match. That credits Rachel and her coaching a lot. All of us except for maybe one or two played club volleyball and played year-round, and Rachel just enhanced our skills. It's great when you can get players who are that committed to volleyball.”\n\nThe 2010 season featured an epic five-set battle against North Hagerstown that foreshadowed bigger things to come for the Hubs. In 2011, North Hagerstown — led by Autumn Fisher, Peyton Wallch and Brynne Kirsch — claimed its first state championship, edging River Hill in a thrilling five-set Class 3A final. The Hubs also captured the state title in 2012 and 2014, as Wallech, Zoe Schreiber, Jaila Bell, Tana McKinsey and Lexi McCarthy kept North rolling.\n\nSmithsburg also showed no signs of slowing down. The Leopards were expected to take a step back in 2011 following the graduations of Rishell and Belella, but seniors Danielle Harbaugh, Karah Knight and Sarah Shives led Smithsburg to a third straight 1A championship, and Haley Caudell and Amanda Snowden helped power the Leopards to a fourth straight title in 2012 as Smithsburg tied Williamsport's county record of four straight state crowns.\n\nFor all of the county's volleyball success, 2012 was a special year. Along with North and Smithsburg, Williamsport joined the party by claiming the Class 2A championship, giving Crabtree five titles as a coach. It's the only time that Washington County teams have won three state titles in the same year.\n\nThe Wildcats' championship — featuring by Stacey Christy, Courtney Malott, Emily Taylor, Lindsey Mowbray and Haley Wolff — had added meaning for two reasons: The dedication of the season to former player Samantha Rae Kelly, who was killed along with baseball standout Brendon Colliflower in a car accident following prom the previous spring; and redemption after getting upset by Middletown in the 2011 playoffs following an undefeated regular season.\n\n“The thing I took away from it was that life isn't all about volleyball, and it really changed our perspective knowing it can be taken away from you so quickly, so cherish the moments and the friendships — don't take anything for granted,” said Crabtree. “We were all fortunate to have people to lean on when it happened, too. That whole situation … it was a made-for movie.”\n\nSmithsburg's state title streak was snapped with a heartbreaking five-set loss at eventual state champion Fort Hill in 2013, but the Leopards quickly reclaimed the Class 1A throne for another four-year run from 2014-17, fueled by Sydney Scott, Megan Moran, Lauryn Daniels, Alaina Black, Hollee Winders, Payton Belella, Katie McCracken and Marissa Dangler.\n\nIn 2016, Crabtree took the job as Williamsport's athletic director and Karen Hampton — a senior on Crabtree's first championship squad in 1995 — became the head volleyball coach, completing a climb up the ladder that started at Springfield Middle and included time as the Wildcats' JV coach.\n\n“It was a really, really cool opportunity that I could come back and coach with Emily, because I always looked up to her and considered her a mentor,” Hampton said. “She had a solid program there, but she gave me the freedom to develop into my own as a coach.”\n\nThe 2016 season was a bit of a roller-coaster ride for the Wildcats, who entered the playoffs with five losses. But the squad — led by Devon Groesbeck, Brynn Lewis and Keara Lewis — peaked in the postseason and saved its best for the Class 2A state championship match against Rising Sun, stunning the previously-undefeated Tigers in a five-set thriller.\n\n“There was so much adversity that the girls worked through that year, and a lot of pressures as the new coach that year,” Hampton said. “The season was difficult. We had a lot of struggles, and part of what helped was we focused more on mental toughness and building this confidence within us to trust each other. That was a big turning point.”\n\nThe Wildcats followed a similar script in 2018, once again entering the playoffs with five losses. But led by Keara Lewis and Mackenzie Shank, they once again peaked when it mattered most and claimed their state-record 15th championship — along the way rallying from two sets down to stun Winters Mill on the road in the 2A West region final.\n\n“I believe it was the third set and Hayley Kendle ran all the way across the court and dug a ball way out of her position, and that sent chills down my spine because that girl was in it and wanted to win it so bad,” Hampton said. “That match felt like a championship game. The comeback and the momentum shifts, it was pretty intense.\n\n“I really treasure those state title runs. I reminded myself to be in every moment of that, because it goes fast. I came across the video of the 2016 trip down to the state final and it took me back to all the girls and the memories. It gives me goosebumps every time.”\n\nAnother Williamsport product — Jessica Custer, who played for the Wildcats in the late 1990s and had varsity and JV coaching experience at Thomas Johnson in Frederick County — took charge at Clear Spring in 2016.\n\n“All I had to instill was some confidence that had been lost and establish a winning mentality,” Custer said. “My assistant (Lindsay Plotner) was in the same boat, had won championships at Williamsport. We've got a lot of Williamsport mentality there, and I think we have managed to give the kids a taste of what winning is like and to know that they can do that.”\n\nThe Blazers entered the 2018 playoffs with a modest 8-7 record, but they went on their own memorable state championship run, including a stunning five-set upset of Smithsburg in the 1A West Section II final, ending the Leopards' four-year reign.\n\n“We played that season on emotion alone. (Senior Jordyn Smith's) grandfather had passed away and Jordyn played her guts out for him. Every match, she played with the most emotion she could play with and at one point I just looked at her and said, 'Have fun,'” Custer said. “We've established ourselves as one of the best teams in the county, now let's have fun and if we win a state championship, great. They let their guard down and did it, and it was fun to watch.”\n\nIt took a team effort — led by Olivia Kirby, Vallery Dean, Kylee McKenrick, Annemarie Kinman and McKenzie Slough — to bring Clear Spring its first state championship since 1994.\n\n“Of all my years, that was my first state championship, so that was a big deal,” Custer said. “It's very cool to watch kids achieve that and feel a sense of accomplishment that you helped them get to that point. … If you had told me at the beginning of the season or the middle of the season that we would win that state championship, I wouldn't have believed it.”\n\nSmithsburg made it nine Class 1A championships in 11 years when the Leopards peaked in the playoffs following a sub-.500 regular season to claim the 2019 state championship — led by Sydney Hammond, sisters Morgan and Megan Domenico and Hailey Daniels. As rare underdogs, the Leopards clipped Clear Spring in five sets in the region final, before securing the program's 14th title and the county's 36th in all.\n\n“Smithsburg didn't have anything to lose last year,” Custer said. “It flip-flopped.”\n\nCounty teams have added five more state championships over the last three seasons to bring the total to 41. North Hagerstown (Class 3A) and Clear Spring (Class 1A) each won back-to-back titles in 2022 and 2023. Williamsport captured the Class 1A crown in 2021.\n\nFrom 2007 through 2023"
