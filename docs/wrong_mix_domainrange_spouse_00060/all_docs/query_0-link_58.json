Is The Queen Engaged? Friday Rumors!\n\nHip-Hop Rumors: Akon To Leave Universal? Diddy Gushes Over Obama! Luda and Tommy Lee Get That Green!\n\nHip-Hop Rumors: OBAMA! Shawty Lo Gets Peaced? Rihanna The Skater? Lil’ Wayne To Rehab?\n\nHip-Hop Rumors: Pharrell Pushes Big Boy Off Stage! Is Lil’ Wayne A G.O.A.T?\n\nTODAY’S RUMORS\n\nIf you see this “button” on an article, it is apart of our Black Music Month gala! Also, click that for new/old/free music from iTunes.\n\nSUPERHEAD – ABUSIVE MOTHER?!\n\nThis book is probably already being written. But, after being run over by her man Darius McCrary, Karrine Steffans is recovering. She’s down, but not out. Also, she is reportedly going to make Eddie, I mean Darius pay. But Darius, who now has a spike of popularity, has gone on the offensive. He’s reportedly filed a restraining order of his own and claimed that Superhead abused her son. “I’ve also witnessed her abuse her soon. I’ve seen her slap her 10 year old son across the face with such force that her son fell to the ground in tears. She has called him names like monkey and stupid.” Now, if I am correct that is Kool G Rap’s son! She better not be beating down any kid, much less G Rap’s! Nevertheless, Karrine claims that Eddie ahs been physically and verbally abusive and has proof. Whew, more books, more problems.\n\nAMY WINEHOUSE IS OFFICIALLY FINISHED – RACIST, CRACK AND PUBLIC SEX\n\nMan, this chick and her career have been headed for the toilet for a long time and now we can say its official. I hope Nelson Mandela isn’t too old to realize this person has no business anywhere near her. Anyway, the chicks husband is somehow pulling strings from inside the bing, because he took a video of her having sex public place (as if her nasty body is worth anything sexual), mindlessly on crack with all types of drugs in her house and finally she was taped singing a real sweet racist song. Amy and a friend named Sarah get a laugh as they as they the lyrics to “Heads, Shoulders, Knees and Toes” and flip it into the racist words, “Blacks, Pakis, G#### and Nips, G#### and Nips” and then they say, “And deaf and dumb and blind and gay!” The husband Blake pretends he’s not taping, but records all the mess. This dumb broad needs to be pumped full of crack so we can just remember the music. I’m tired of this foolishness and I have no patience for racists. But a racist crackhead? That’s the worst.\n\nHere is the video:\n\nSomebody does us all a favor and gives Amy Winehouse a new face:\n\nAs if we care, I heard she has already said sorry. As far as I am concerned, toss her in there with KKKramer, Paris Hilton and the rest of them.\n\nSPEAKING OF LIL’ BOOSIE\n\nI don’t know, but chain-snatching rumors are pretty passé at this point. Even the 50 Cent one was like, “Ho Hum.” Nevertheless, let me tell you what I heard. Lil’ Boosie was apparently in New York for the DJ Khaled video shoot. I heard that he was on his way to the video, but not in New York, and was robbed of his chain. I don’t really have anything to sustain the rumor, but some seem to think it was somebody close to him that helped facilitate that. I haven’t looked at the pictures from the shoot to see if he didn’t have some chain he’s normally seen with. Why? I don’t really care. But, if anybody does look, let me know.\n\n40 GLOCC BULLIES LIL’ WAYNE’S ARTIST OUT OF CHAIN\n\nLook at this video. Infamous / G-Unit’s 40 Glocc and Village Boo went and took Young Money artist’s Tyga’s chains. Rumor has it Lil’ Wayne has since gotten the chains back. OK, so what is the point, if you are going to just give the chains back. Is it just to Debo somebody? Educate me.\n\nT.I. & SHAWTY LO IN BETTER TIMES…\n\n…Two months ago. Is the rap community just looking for beef, because there is none to mention of? Look at this and see T.I. and Shawty Lo in Bankhead Bliss:\n\nWEDDING BELLS FOR YOUNG DRO AND FANTASIA?\n\nMarriage is the new single and I heard that another couple is coming down the pipeline to jump the broom. It definitely is refreshing not to read about any mess from Young Dro and Fantasia. But, most recently I am hearing that this couple is looking to get married later this year. I think they can be the king and queen of the hood, because Dro’s truck is serious. The gas has to be murder! Anyway, I also heard Dro is coming out really soon and he is still down with T.I. Will T.I. be producing the entire album? I don’t know, but I heard Tip has had a bit of time to work on his beats and Dro might be the recipient of that.\n\nRemember these pics?\n\nILLSEED’S QUICKIES\n\nWhat’s Up! Shout out to my homey DJ Spazmat – Straight out of ATL and The Bumsquad DJ’s!\n\nBig Body Gal: Buffie Da Body is supposed to be on Tyra’s show for something tomorrow. I pray she doesn’t embarrass us.\n\nRita G Sex Tape? I heard there is a Rita G sex tape floating around. No worries – there is no Kanye in it. I got screen shots and the images are pretty risqué, but no video.\n\nCongrats To Chris Webber: I heard that Chris Webber tied the knot recently and he’s such a good dude that he donated over $10,000 to his new wife’s foundation, Social Butterflies Youth Services. Can I get a free beat?\n\nWHAT? Floyd Mayweather going to the UFC for $200 million? The math doesn’t add up. I think I’ll defer and say this is patently false, but if it is, Floyd will live up to his name “Money.”\n\nWho Cares Alert: Jay and B are rumored to be buying a house in Dubai. It actually makes a bit of sense. Dubai is on the rise.\n\nBoth Pushed Back? I am hearing that both The Game and G-Unit’s albums have been pushed back.\n\nFACT: Warren G and a buddy were arrested June 8 on marijuana charges. Like a G, Warren posted $20,000 bail. Smoking!\n\nReal Expensive Love: Singer Seal surprised wife Heidi Klum with a brand, new gold Bentley Flying Spur. Her version includes customized baby seats for the car. Her whip cost about $250,000 total.\n\nWTF? I heard there is a new energy drink called “Drank.” How does this work? “I drank that Drank and it made me stank?”\n\n50 Year Young! Did you know Prince turned 50 over the weekend? He looks the same as the 80s!\n\nRANDOM QUOTES\n\nColdplay’s Chris Martin rides for Jay-Z:\n\n“Anyone who isn’t into it is probably a c**t.”[I wonder if he rides like this when Peedi Crack starts poppin’ off.]\n\nPapa Snoop Dogg gives Jay and B some advice for life (People magazine).\n\n“I told them to go home and make babies. They should, that’s the next step as far as marriage, having kids … add on to the family, so hopefully that’s what they’ll do.”\n\nBobby Brown on his first violent encounter with Usher:\n\n“When I walked into the party I ran into Usher and we immediately gave each other a hug. While he was holding me, he turned to the side and kinda put my neck in a playful choke hold and started squeezing me. I tried to tell him that I couldn’t breathe but he couldn’t hear me because the music was loud. It didn’t help that he was drunk. I was yelling, ‘yo, yo, yo let me go! I can’t breathe!’ He was excited to see me and he was just expressing himself with this gesture. He was so drunk he didn’t realize what he was doing.”\n\n(In related rumors, some are suggesting that Bobby’s book has been deaded, but his reps say it it just being delayed. We’ll see.)\n\nSnoop is wild for this quote. He says crack > college. (Esquire).\n\n“A lot of people like to fool you and say that you’re not smart if you never went to college, but common sense rules over everything. That’s what I learned from selling crack.”\n\nSIGNS THE WORLD IS COMING TO AN END\n\nThere are so many metrics to measure the end of the world. It really is more than random acts of violence and conspiracy theories. Check out this song called “My P***y Is Magic.” WOW. This song is so bad, I had to bring it to the front so we can all put it to the back.\n\nBUYING LIL’ WAYNE\n\nWe will soon see how many people are going to be interested in Lil’ Wayne’s CD, The Carter III. Real Soon. My boy, Klean, has it and he’s not even in the continental United States!\n\nGREG STREET: “ JA-LAME DUPRI” and “SLOW SLOW DEF”\n\nUmmm…he sonned JD and then started putting his Hip-Hop doll line. No East Coast or Midwest on the chess set? Street is cool though – no hate.\n\nJD RETURNS FIRE – KINDA!\n\nCheck out JD showing how much he is balling out of control. Do you think he cares about what people think at this point?\n\nLOVE IS IN THE AIR – RICK ROSS AND FOXY BROWN!\n\n“They are in fact a couple. Rick Ross swept her off of her feet and this is gonna [be] the next Big Hip-Hop couple,” an inside source told AllHipHop.com. “They both are in love.”\n\nAlas, love is definitely in the air – along with dro and haze. It looks like Rick Ross and Foxy Brown are definitely a couple. I guess this is like the 08 version of Faith and Biggie? This happened so fast!\n\nAll I can say is read the full news story on Ricky Ross and Foxy Brown. Ladies, don’t hate.\n\nJ.A.G. – COME ON DOWN!\n\nJ.A.G. is the latest artist to be featured in Illseed’s “Come On Down.” The rapper hails from Greenville, NC. The song is called “My All” and here is the video. Let him and me now what you think.\n\nDOES NAS TAKE A TURN FOR THE HIP?\n\nThis is a recent photo shoot from Complex and features Nas looking more like Lupe Fiasco. I could be wrong.\n\nHILLARY CLINTON CALLS IT A DAY\n\nOK, let us put the BS to the side and RIDE for Barack Obama! It is the only thing to do to avoid Bush’s other daddy from getting into office. Hillary did pretty good. No hate.\n\nYOU LOVE KHIA, YOU HATE KHIA…HERE IS THE REPLY\n\nIf you checked in with us over the weekend, you know she had major beef down in ATL with a radio personality. Click here for that. Read the reply from Khia. I put it at the bottom since I know some of you grow tired of these posts.\n\nFirst, the on air battle and then Khia’s reply. I have to say, Khia had some validity to her claims. You will soon notice, I didn’t edit a word.\n\nWho is in the hot seat this weeeeeeeek? Poor-sha Foxx from Atlanta’s V-103 radio station….
