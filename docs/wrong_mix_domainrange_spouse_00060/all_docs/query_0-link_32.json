        "text": "Emmy Nominations Announced – 18 Black Actors NominatedPosted by Wilson Morales\n\nJuly 16, 2015\n\nRemember this day in history as the 2015 Primetime Emmy Awards were announced on July 16. While HBO’s “Game of Thrones” received the most nominations, the most important thing to know is that a record number of Black actors (18) were nominated, shattering last year’s record of 11.\n\nLet’s start with Viola Davis and Taraji P. Henson both nominated for Lead Actress in a Drama Series. Keep in mind that two or more black women have never been nominated in this category in the same year. Also, the two women are competing again for the first time since being nominated for Best Supporting Actress in 2008 for Doubt and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button respectively.\n\nWhen’s the last time you saw three Blacks nominated in the same category? Well, Congrats to Andre Braugher, Keegan Michael-Key & Tituss Burgess on their Emmys nods for Supporting Actor in a Comedy.\n\nHBO’s Bessie scored major nominations for director Dee Rees, Queen Latifah, Monique and Michael K. Wiliams among others. Rees scored another nomination for writing Bessie. As creator of ABC’s American Crime, Oscar winner John Ridley got two nominations for Best Limited Series and Best Writing of a Limited Series.\n\nNot listed in this list are Lawrence Davis on his Emmy nod for Hairstyling For A Limited Series Or Movie for HBO’s Bessie. He’s the Dept Head Hairstylist. Rashida Jones also received an Emmy nod for Exceptional Merit in Documentary Filmmaking as Co-Producer for the Netflix doc Hot Girls Wanted; Greg Phillinganes for serving as musical director ‘Stevie Wonder: Songs In The Key Of Life – An All-Star GRAMMY Salute.’\n\nAndy Samberg will host the 2015 Primetime Emmy Awards on September 20. Fox will broadcast them live from the Microsoft Theater in downtown Los Angeles.\n\nOutstanding Drama Series\n\nBetter Call Saul\n\nDownton Abbey\n\nGame of Thrones\n\nHomeland\n\nHouse of Cards\n\nMad Men\n\nOrange is the New Black\n\nOutstanding Comedy Series\n\nLouis\n\nModern Family\n\nParks and Recreation\n\nSilicon Valley\n\nTransparent\n\nUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\n\nVeep\n\nOutstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series\n\nKyle Chandler, Bloodline\n\nJeff Daniels, The Newsroom\n\nJon Hamm, Mad Men\n\nBob Odenkirk, Better Call Saul\n\nLiev Schreiber, Ray Donovan\n\nKevin Spacey, House of Cards\n\nOutstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series\n\nClaire Danes, Homeland\n\nViola Davis, How to Get Away with Murder\n\nTaraji P Henson, Empire\n\nTatiana Maslany, Orphan Black\n\nElisabeth Moss, Mad Men\n\nRobin Wright, House of Cards\n\nOutstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama\n\nJoanne Froggatt, Downton Abbey\n\nLena Headey, Game of Thrones\n\nEmilia Clarke, Game of Thrones\n\nChristina Hendricks, Mad Men\n\nUzo Aduba, Orange Is the New Black\n\nChristine Baranski, The Good Wife\n\nOutstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama\n\nJonathan Banks, Better Call Saul\n\nBen Mendelsohn, Bloodline\n\nJim Carter, Downton Abbey\n\nPeter Dinklage, Game of Thrones\n\nMichael Kelly, House of Cards\n\nAlan Cumming, The Good Wife\n\nOutstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy\n\nAnthony Anderson, Blackish\n\nLouis CK, Louis\n\nDon Ceheadle, House of Lies\n\nWill Forte, The Last Man on Earth\n\nMatt LeBlanc, Episodes\n\nWilliam H Macy, Shameless\n\nJeffrey Tambour, Transparent\n\nOutstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy\n\nEdie Falco, Nurse Jackie\n\nLisa Kudrow, The Comeback\n\nJulia Louis-Dreyfus, Veep\n\nAmy Poehler, Parks and Recreation\n\nAmy Schumer, Inside Amy Schumer\n\nLily Tomlin, Grace and Frankie\n\nOutstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy\n\nNiecy Nash, Getting On\n\nJulie Bowen, Modern Family\n\nAllison Janney, Mom\n\nKate McKinnon, Saturday Night Live\n\nMayim Bialik, The Big Bang Theory\n\nGaby Hoffmann, Transparent\n\nJane Krakowski, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\n\nAnna Chlumsky, Veep\n\nOutstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy\n\nAndre Braugher, Brooklyn Nine-Nine\n\nAdam Driver, Girls\n\nKeegan-Michael Key, Key & Peele\n\nTy Burrell, Modern Family\n\nTituss Burgess, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\n\nTony Hale, Veep\n\nOutstanding Actress in a Mini-series or Movie\n\nMaggie Gyllenhaal, The Honorable Woman\n\nJessica Lange, American Horror Story: Freak Show\n\nFelicity Huffman, American Crime\n\nQueen Latifah, Bessie\n\nFrances McDormand, Olive Kitteridge\n\nEmma Thompson, Sweeney Todd, The Demon Barber of Fleet Street Live from Lincoln Center\n\nOutstanding Actor in a Mini-series or Movie\n\nRichard Jenkins, Olive Kitteridge\n\nDavid Oyelowo, Nightingale\n\nAdrien Brody, Houdini\n\nMark Rylance, Wolf Hall\n\nRicky Gervias, Derek\n\nOutstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or a Movie\n\nRichard Cabral, American Crime\n\nDenise O’Hare, American Horror Story: Freak Show\n\nFinn Wittrock, American Horror Story: Freak Show\n\nMichael Kenneth Williams, Bessie\n\nBill Murray, Olive Kitteridge\n\nDamian Lewis, Wolf Hall\n\nOutstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or a Movie\n\nRegina King, American Crime\n\nSarah Paulson, American Horror Story: Freak Show\n\nAngela Bassett, American Horror Story: Freak Show\n\nMo’Nique, Bessie\n\nKathy Bates, American Horror Story: Freak Show\n\nZoe Kazan, Olive Kitteridge\n\nOutstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series\n\nAlan Alda, The Blacklist\n\nMichael J.
