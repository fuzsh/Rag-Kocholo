        "text": "Darius McCrary’s wife is ready to call it quits.\n\nThe actor’s wife, Tammy Brawner, filed for divorce in Los Angeles on Monday, citing irreconcilable differences, TMZ reports.\n\nBrawner, 30, is seeking spousal support from McCrary, 40, as well as full custody of the couple’s infant daughter, Zoey. She also requested McCrary’s visitation be suspended until he completes substance abuse and domestic violence education classes, the site reports.\n\nBrawner accused the former “Family Matters” star of domestic abuse, alleging that he threw a cellphone at her when she was eight months pregnant with their daughter, and that he “held [our daughter] over a hot stove with fire going and boiling water going” when Zoey was “no more than eight or nine months old.”"
