        "text": "Many people around the world find comfort in practicing a religion. In fact, there are over 4,000 religions recognized around the world.\n\nTwo common religious groups are the Baptists and the Southern Baptists. People often see these groups as the same, but they have differences that set them apart. Baptist vs. Southern Baptist churches each have their own backgrounds and religious ideas.\n\nIf you’re wondering what sets these groups apart, you’ve come to the right place. We explore the characteristics of these two faiths in our article below.\n\nThe History of Baptist Religious Groups\n\nYou can trace the history of the Baptist church to the very early 17th century. It was then that people started rebelling against the Church of England. These people started calling for religious reform.\n\nThe first Baptists emphasized baptism for all its members. They also wanted local church autonomy and leadership for all the believers.\n\nMany early Baptist people fled to the American colonies. Baptist groups started popping up amongst the colonists.\n\nThe Baptist faith grew and started merging into different branches. This is where the Southern Baptist church came from.\n\nThe Southern Baptist church has a darker history involving slavery. In the 1800s, debates over slavery caused a rift between Baptist groups. The Southern Baptist church had most of its locations in the slave states of the South.\n\nThe Southern Baptist church has since denounced slavery. The group has also publicly apologized for any involvement that members of its group have had during this horrifying time in history.\n\nBaptist Church\n\nThe Baptist religion stems from the Protestant Christian church. Baptists are Christian, so they share many beliefs of other Christian religious groups.\n\nAlthough there are several branches of the Baptist faith, there are some common beliefs held among this group. These beliefs are what set them apart from other Christian religions.\n\nBible\n\nThe fundamental belief of Baptist people is that the Bible is key to how they experience their life. Baptists believe that the Bible is the direct Word of God. This means it is the ultimate guide for how to practice and live as Baptists.\n\nThe Bible is the guide that Baptists use to live their life. It also gives information about God’s character and plans for salvation. By following the word of the Bible, people can get closer to God.\n\nMost Baptists encourage the study of the Bible. They see this as a way to deepen their understanding of the Word of God.\n\nBaptism\n\nAnother cornerstone of the Baptist faith is baptism. Baptize means a person has chosen to dedicate themselves fully to their faith. Baptists see the act of getting baptized as a spiritual rebirth.\n\nChurch Leaders\n\nBaptist followers don’t have traditional priests. They believe that each member of the Baptist faith can communicate with God directly. Each Baptist follower handles their relationship with God.\n\nSalvation Beliefs\n\nSalvation is another key belief in the Baptist faith. Baptists see salvation as the gift of God’s grace.\n\nIn this faith, salvation is not something you can gain through action. It, instead, comes from the personal decision to trust wholeheartedly in Jesus Christ. Salvation also means repenting of your sins using the conviction of the Holy Spirit.\n\nChurch Structure\n\nBaptists feel that their churches should get to make their own decisions. They run independently and are self-governed.\n\nBaptist churches also believe in democracy. Each member has a say in how the church is run.\n\nSouthern Baptist Church\n\nSouthern Baptist churches are part of the larger Baptist group. This means the difference between Baptist and Southern Baptist groups is subtle.\n\nSouthern Baptist churches tend to be stricter than other Baptist branches. There are several other beliefs that differ from the Baptist branch.\n\nSalvation\n\nSalvation is a key belief of Southern Baptists. The way to get salvation is through the grace of God.\n\nSouthern Baptists believe that all people need to put their faith in their belief in Christ. If they don’t, they are destined to spend eternity in Hell.\n\nBible\n\nAnother difference in the Southern Baptist church is that the Bible is not the only place to get the Word of God. Although the Bible is a great avenue for getting the Word of God, they can hear it in other places, too.\n\nFree Will\n\nFree will is a concept that Southern Baptists hold very highly. Free will means that God has granted people the freedom to make choices about their faith. People can choose to respond to the gospel messages that they get in the way they see fit.\n\nSouthern Baptists feel that the decisions that each person makes based on their free will shape their eternal destiny. It is up to each person to decide the choices they will make and how they will respond to the grace of God.\n\nPredestination\n\nPredestination is a concept that Southern Baptists believe in. The idea is that God already knows who He will choose for salvation.\n\nEven though God predestines those whom He will save, each person has the freedom to choose or reject God’s offer of salvation. Ultimately, it will be God who grants a person their salvation.\n\nBaptist vs. Southern Baptist Churches: Telling the Difference Can Be Tricky\n\nUnderstanding various religions can be challenging if you don’t practice them. When trying to figure out the difference between Baptist vs. Southern Baptist churches, it can be hard to tell how they differ. Although the variations are slight, they are there."
