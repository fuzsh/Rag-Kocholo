        "text": "Baptist churches differ from the Church of God on key points such as the doctrine of the Holy Spirit and the structure of church leadership. If you’re interested in joining a new church, you may be comparing different denominations to determine which one you want to align yourself with. At first glance, Baptist churches can look very similar to other denominations, including the Church of God. However, looking below the surface will reveal important differences between these two groups. It’s worthwhile to study these differences carefully before deciding between the two.\n\nHow Did The Church of God Originate?\n\nThe Church of God is headquartered in Tennessee, and it’s affiliated with both the Pentecostal and Holiness movements. In 1886, R. G. Spurling organized a meeting in Monroe County, Tennessee, for former Baptists who wanted to break away from the mainstream and form their own movement. These founders saw the Baptist denomination as too exclusionary and preferred to include a wider variety of beliefs and practices within their definition of biblical Christianity.\n\nSubsequent revival meetings led to growth in the movement, and today the Church of God has more than 7 million members in 178 different nations.\n\nWhat Does the Church of God Teach?\n\nThe Church of God defines itself as Pentecostal. Believing that the Holy Spirit baptizes believers at specific times and locations, Church of God members practice speaking in tongues. They believe this is evidence that a person is currently filled with the Holy Spirit. They describe it as a spiritual language or as the language of “angels” described in 1 Corinthians 13. What the Church of God means by speaking in tongues is uttering words or syllables that cannot be understood by anyone listening. The syllables and sounds are not part of any known language, and research has shown that the the brain’s frontal lobe, which controls speech, is not active while a person is speaking in tongues. Services that involve speaking in tongues are often highly emotional.\n\nThe Church of God is also connected to the Holiness movement, in that it teaches the doctrine of total sanctification. Sanctification refers to the process of becoming more holy and Christlike after a person becomes a Christian. The Church of God believes that members can become totally sanctified while living here on earth.\n\nHow is the Church of God Structured?\n\nThe Church of God is governed by a complex system of leadership. The highest decision-making body is the International General Assembly, which meets periodically to vote on official appointments and church practices. Three levels of local church leadership are recognized, including Exhorters, Ordained Ministers, and Ordained Bishops.\n\nHow Do Baptist Teachings Differ From The Church of God?\n\nFirst of all, many Baptist churches, like ours, do not practice speaking in tongues. In First Corinthians 14, Paul gives the Corinthian church clear directions about how church services should be conducted. He warns against confusion and disorder in a church service, and he explains that if someone is speaking in church and cannot be understood, the practice is not glorifying to God.\n\nHowever, Baptist churches like ours do teach that each believer is given spiritual gifts by the Holy Spirit. These include the gifts of teaching and serving others, etc. However, Baptists believe that language should be used to communicate clearly, with the goal of teaching and understanding more about God and who He is.\n\nIn a Baptist church service, strong emotional responses to spiritual truths are encouraged. However, emotions are displayed in an orderly way, and care is taken to maintain the focus on God and His goodness, not on believers themselves. Check out our “Sermons” page for a closer look at how our services are conducted.\n\nSecond, Baptist churches do not teach that a person can be entirely sanctified while on earth. Baptists look forward to complete sanctification in heaven, in the presence of Christ. However, no New Testament believer achieved entire sanctification on earth. Paul is very clear about his continued struggle with sin, despite his close walk with God. He describes the Christian life as a constant battle between the spirit and the flesh, and he tells every believer that this battle will be ongoing as long as we are alive on earth. On our “Our Beliefs” page, you can find more information about our doctrinal positions at Harmony Baptist Church.\n\nHow Are Baptist Churches Structured?\n\nBaptist churches emphasize the priesthood of the believer, a doctrine clearly laid out in Scripture, particularly in the book of Hebrews. The author of Hebrews explains that, following Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross, we no longer need other believers to intercede for our sins and serve as an intermediary between us and Christ. Each believer has the privilege of going directly to Christ to confess sins and receive forgiveness. Baptists also teach that each believer is empowered to understand the Bible for himself or herself, without the need for an interpreter.\n\nIn Baptist churches, the pastor’s role is one of teaching and shepherding the church members. Some Baptist churches look to conventions, such as the Southern Baptist Convention, to make certain decisions for the local church. Other Baptist churches, like Harmony Baptist Church, are independent, meaning that they don’t answer to any governing body outside the church. However, all Baptists recognize each believer’s ability to stand before God independently.\n\nWhich Denomination Should I Choose?"
