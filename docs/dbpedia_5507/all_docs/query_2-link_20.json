        "text": "The key difference is that in most other denominations (Anglicanism, Methodism, the United Reformed Church, etc) infant baptism is practised. Baptists believe that baptism is a public profession of personal faith - in other words, a public display of a decision someone has made themselves - and the notion of infant baptism is at odds with this.\n\nMost new churches (emergent, or whichever word you prefer - churches that were established in the last few decades) profess to be non-denominational but tend to accord with Baptist theology, at least in the respect of baptism.\n\nThe term \"baptists\" came from the fact that Baptists strongly believed that:\n\nBaptism is for believers only. (excluding infant baptism)\n\nBaptism must be by immersion, as opposed to sprinkling and effusion.\n\nBecause of their strong beliefs regarding baptism, they were given the name \"Baptists\".\n\nBaptists generally believe:\n\nBiblical authority (Mat 24:35; 1Pet 1:23; 2Tim 3:16-17)\n\nAutonomy of the local church (Mat 18:15-17; 1Cor 6:1-3)\n\nPriesthood of all believers (1Pet 2:5-9; 1Tim 5)\n\nTwo ordinances (believer's baptism and the Lord's Supper) (Acts 2:41-47; 1Cor 11:23-32)\n\nIndividual soul liberty (Rom 14:5-12)\n\nSeparation of Church and State (Mat 22:15-22)\n\nTwo offices of the church (pastor and deacon) (1Tim 3:1-13; Tit 1-2)\n\nMost Baptist traditions believe in the \"Four Freedoms\" articulated by Baptist historian Walter B. Shurden:\n\nSoul freedom: the soul is competent before God, and capable of making decisions in matters of faith without coercion or compulsion by any larger religious or civil body\n\nChurch freedom: freedom of the local church from outside interference, whether government or civilian (subject only to the law where it does not interfere with the religious teachings and practices of the church)\n\nBible freedom: the individual is free to interpret the Bible for himself or herself, using the best tools of scholarship and biblical study available to the individual\n\nReligious freedom: the individual is free to choose whether to practice their religion, another religion, or no religion; Separation of church and state is often called the \"civil corollary\" of religious freedom\n\nThere are a lot of other Christian Denominations that hold these beliefs as well, but what makes a Baptist distinctive, is the fact that they observe all of these, whereas other denominations may only observe some of these points. Another distinctive point, is Christian Education, which a lot of Baptists uphold.\n\nThe historic roots of Baptists go back to the Reformation. A key belief was that baptism of infants was invalid. Since infant baptism was almost universal at the time, the new churches required that converts to it be re-baptised. This came to be a distinctive mark of Baptists churches, although other Reformation sects such as the Mennonites also practiced it, without adopoting the Baptist name.\n\nThe complex history of Protestant denominations means that many denominations divided from the Baptist churches, and from the other Reformation churches that practiced adult baptism, many of which retained adult Baptism. The result is that while Baptist churches universally practice adult baptism, all churches that practice adult baptism are not necessarily Baptist churches.\n\nSee Wikipedia for a more detailed history.\n\nTechnically, the Baptists were not a part of the Reformation because like those of Luther, Calvin and Zwingli, the Baptists were never a part of the Catholic church. They never left the Catholic church because they were never in it. They were around long before the Reformation. Originally, they were known as Montanist's. This was around 150 AD. The Montanists were persecuted by the Roman ruled regions, fed to the lions, ect. Then they were known as Novatians 200AD-305AD. Same thing here, because they believed in things like baptism for believers only, and only praying to Jesus, they were persecuted and killed. When the Catholic Church was founded by Emperor Constantine around 300AD, they started hunting down these \"heresy\" cult people for not following the new Church. In 306AD they changed again to the Dontanist and then a few hundred years later they were referred as Albigenses. In 1170AD they were called Waldensians. They were most popular at this time, but still were not accepted by mainstream. Through the \"dark ages\" they were hunted down and killed. Even Martin Luther took part in this after the Reformation. Around the time of the Reformation they were known as Ana-baptists. This is actually a slang term given to them by those of the Catholic church, including Luther. When they were found, Luther and others would drown them, making fun of them because the had been \"rebatized\" You could search \"third baptism drowning\" and find out more on this. They would be called as they are known now as the Baptist Church in 1638. Technically they were the original church of the Apostles around 300 years before the Catholic church was invented. The thought that the Baptist church is part of the protestant sect is way off and even the protestant faith clashes very much in doctrine from the Baptist church.
