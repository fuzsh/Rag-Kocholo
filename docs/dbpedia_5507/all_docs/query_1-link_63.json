        "text": "The largest Protestant denomination in the United States is the\n\nSouthern Baptist Convention, a group of nearly 16 million members\n\nworshiping in more than 41,000 separate congregations. Unlike many\n\nother denominations, Southern Baptists have no church hierarchy\n\n– each congregation is autonomous and voluntarily affiliates\n\nwith others to accomplish shared goals.\n\nThe largest Protestant denomination in the United States is the Southern Baptist Convention, a group of nearly 16 million members worshiping in more than 41,000 separate congregations. Unlike many other denominations, Southern Baptists have no church hierarchy – each congregation is autonomous and voluntarily affiliates with others to accomplish shared goals.\n\nGilroy recently became home to an important regional Baptist agency, the Central Coast Baptist Association. A staff of 10 moved in January from its former San Jose office to a suite of offices on the campus of the Gilroy First Baptist Church.\n\nThis organization consists of 96 churches and missions stretching from King City to San Mateo, making it the largest group of churches in our area. South County’s central location, good freeway access, and comparatively moderate housing prices influenced the recent move.\n\nDr. Mike Stewart is Director of Missions for the group. During his six years in this position he helped guide the merger of two precursor associations to form the CCBA a year and a half ago.\n\nMerging the two groups has strengthened the assistance available to local churches. Donations from congregations (the goal is 3 percent of budgets) go to fund many programs.\n\n• Church Growth includes leadership training for pastors, evangelism training for lay people, and sponsorship of L.E.A.D. School of Ministry, a training program for future pastors and church leaders.\n\n• Church Planting consists of starting new congregations in partnership with local churches, re-starting struggling churches at their request, recruiting qualified pastors to serve these congregations. Seven new churches are planned for this year; currently there is special emphasis in the area of ministry to Korean, Spanish, and Persian language groups.\n\n• Fellowship Activities are numerous, for example, youth camps, student ministries, singles fellowships, All-Association Musicals and monthly Pastors’ Luncheons.\n\n• Mission Opportunities always are emphasized among Baptists: These include annual conferences, student rallies and organized missions trips. The CCBA also sponsors Operation Share, through which the outreach efforts of local churches provided food to 22,000 families last year.\n\n• An Affordable Housing Project is raising a $1.2 million endowment to help church staff and leadership become able to purchase homes in the high-priced housing market.\n\n• The CCBA offers a wide range of consulting services to member churches, things like conflict resolution, search committee training (for congregations seeking new pastors), advice in purchasing items like new sound systems and counseling to pastors and their families (who also need someone to talk to when troubles arise).\n\nMissions Director Stewart is a native of the Phoenix area who felt the call to ministry while an undergraduate at the University of Arizona. After graduating from Southwestern Baptist Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas, he served as a pastor at churches in Arizona and Texas before coming to his current position in South County.\n\nReflecting on his time in Gilroy, Dr. Stewart praises the atmosphere of the town and calls living here “a very positive experience for my family.” He considers it “an incredible privilege to serve the churches and pastors to this area,” and looks forward to assisting churches and their members become more involved in helping their communities.\n\nFor more information about the Central Coast Baptist Association call 846-6600."
