        "text": "A deep division within the nation's largest Protestant denomination, the Southern Baptist Convention, has developed to the point that a significant moderate minority has been creating a separate existence from the denomination's increasingly conservative leadership.\n\nReluctant to accept the conservatives' insistence that the Bible be interpreted literally and that women submit to their husbands and be barred from serving as pastors, the moderates have set up seminaries and a religious publishing house.\n\nThey have also sent out their own missionaries and created separate associations of congregations, like the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship, which by itself counts 1,800 churches as contributors to its budget.\n\nOne of those is First Baptist Church, which covers a city block here and whose members over the last century have donated considerable time and money to the convention's causes, said its pastor, the Rev. David Hughes.\n\nBut these days, Mr. Hughes likens the relationship between church and denomination to a marriage gone sour. The two are like a couple that ''still live under one roof, but they have very little to do with each other,'' he said.\n\nThe president of the Southern Baptist Convention, the Rev. Paige Patterson, acknowledged that moderates had ''formed a denomination within the denomination.'' Mr. Patterson said he would not be surprised if 1,500 or more moderate congregations were to leave the convention in the coming years out of the more than 40,000 total congregations that belong.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
