        "text": "Should, in the course of one’s life among Baptists, headlines like “Will New Calvinism Report Calm Tensions among Southern Baptists?” arise in Theological Articles; especially, in articles appearing in such credible news sources like that of Christianity Today? Of only one thing this Baptist can be certain is that the Truth will be set aside for the sake of some greater good. In this matter: “Cooperation.” Further, a highlight of the article stated: “After growing tensions over Calvinism within the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) culminated in heresy accusations last year, a 19-member advisory committee has issued a seven-page report on the soteriology struggle. It's primary finding? There's no reason that Calvinist and Arminian Baptists cannot overcome their differences for the sake of the Great Commission.” Retrieved from www.christianitytoday.com There we have it! After thirty years of personal computers, and as many years with the World Wide Web; elearning, and a new, online, virtual Seminary emerging every other day, the best that the Master can expect from Calvinist and Arminian Baptists is a “cooperative effort.” It presents itself as the most commendable of aspirations; for we all know that nothing beyond spreading the words of Calvin or Arminius was intended when Christ commissioned His Churches. Of course, one is taught by practitioners of Calvinism and Arminianism not to expect something bigger, better, more ancient, more accurate, more powerful, or more truthful than the traditional, systemic theological constructs offered by Calvinistic 2 | P a g e and Arminian Baptists today. Who would dare suggest that neither Calvinism nor Arminianism is the curriculum of the Great Commission? Why cooperate to disciple nations according to a doctrine, a theology, or a tradition that is not even inspired? Whatever one might think of Calvinism or Arminianism, neither are inspired sources of theology. That honor belongs only to the original texts of Scripture. Are we to join a cooperative effort to advance that which was never received according to grace for grace? Are we to move toward a “tradition for tradition” model for the Great Commission? What about the KOINE text? Does it contain the irreconcilable notions found within Calvinism and Arminianism? Do we have no better answer for the Hope that is among us, the Baptists, than Calvinism or Arminianism? Yes, we, the Baptists people do have something to say. Something that neither the world, nor its traditions have to say! It’s called KOINE. The KOINE “Common” Script is breathed out by the God and is profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness; consequently, then, the man of God is adequately equipped for every good work; even, the Great Commission.\n\nNew Calvinism is a theological movement that has significantly impacted evangelical Christianity and has served to weaken the influence of dispensationalism. New Calvinism portrays itself as the flagship of Reformed theology. Part of the attraction to New Calvinism is its claim to represent the historical position of the church; however, while retaining the primary weaknesses of Reformed theology, it also differs in some respects from historical Reformed theology. Like historical Reformed theology, New Calvinism’s priority on soteriology and forced Christocentric hermeneutic constrain it to conclusions that are contrary to a literal, grammatico-historical interpretation of Scripture. The theology of New Calvinism also produces a dangerous lack of assurance of salvation for the believer, at times approaching the same level of insecurity as is found in Arminian theology. This dissertation will focus on the teachings of the following influential New Calvinist “leaders”: John Piper, Wayne Grudem, Albert Mohler, Timothy Keller, Kevin DeYoung, D. A. Carson, and Mark Driscoll, while also considering the contributions of other New Calvinist preachers, teachers, and authors. Of particular importance will be what this author considers to be the sine qua non of New Calvinism, namely: (1) Dortian Calvinism, (2) eclecticism, (3) soteriocentric focus, (4) A supersessionist view of Israel and the Church, (5) a focus on the Reformed doctrine of the perseverance of the saints, and (6) a compromised practice regarding the authority of Scripture."
