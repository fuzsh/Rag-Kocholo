Green, Emily Katherine Green Scott, and Sandra Brenneman Oldendorf scripted Religious Diversity and Children's Literature: Strategies and Resources and said “All of these groups shared common ideas such as the belief that communion is symbolic and not the literal blood and body of Jesus.” Believing salvation is the highest importance; I have chosen to research it further. I want to recognize how different or similar the plan of salvation is for the three distinct denominations. Denominations start to differentiate and separate in their spiritual philosophies, and they are remarkably contrast about the permanence of salvation. Every sect teaches their creed with absolute certainty, without acknowledging how faithfully or not it follows the\n\nI pondered over this question for a few minutes, and I came to the conclusion that yes; some beliefs are better than other beliefs. There are several different types of beliefs some good and some bad, to name a couple. There are many different types of religious beliefs, like Baptist who believe that we should worship on Sunday and then there is Seventh Day Adventist who believes that we should serve the Lord on the Sabbath Day which is Saturday.\n\nThe dress code, in today’s times, is seen as strict. The men are expected to wear collared-shirts, no shorts or jeans. The women must wear dresses at least to the knee. If one breaks the dress code, they won’t be ostracized or anything of that nature. I have heard the preacher preach on how men and women should dress, I would imagine that it made some people feel awkward. In order to become a member of the church, one must be baptized by immersion. It’s usually done in a river or lake nearby. On Sunday’s Sunday school starts around 9:45, there’s a dismissal at 10:50 and the Sunday service starts at 11 o’clock. We go back to church for the 6 o’clock pm service and again on Wednesday at 7:30 pm. There are separate prayer meetings for men and women before the Sunday service and an altar call after every service. Members are expected to give a 10% tithe to the church each Sunday. The Bible is the King James Version and we follow the Ten Commandments. No decisions are made without being brought before the congregation at a business meeting. Also, one doesn’t ask for a church role, the pastor will assign them or be voted in. If asked, the pastor might not consider\n\nEdward John Carnell 28 June 1919 - 25 April 1967 was a prominent Christian theologian and apologist, was an ordained Baptist pastor, and served as President of Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California. He was the author of nine major books, several of which attempted to develop a fresh outlook in Christian apologetics. to preserve and propagate the glory of this seminary with a spirit of humility and joy. Abstract spiritual values must be avoided, for they can easily be used as a cover for irresolution and irresponsibleness. The glory of a theological seminary is expressed in concrete terms; such glory will have a dissatisfying plainness. The substance of love, for example. It is one thing to love humanity in the abstract; it is quite another thing to love one’s next-door neighbor.\n\nThere are approximately 38,000 different Christian churches today this can be very confusing to someone seeking a relationship with God, but in 1 Corinthians 14:33, it encourages those not to be confused because God is not the author of confusion but of peace. Denominations can be traced back to the first century, during the time of Paul Where he briefly talked about the divisions in his first letter to the Corinthians. Paul says how it is not okay to have divisions in the church. There are so many different Christian denominations and for someone who is interested in Christianity this maybe confusing and/or seem like a weak point. Most people who are venturing into the religion ask why does\n\nEver since the bible was translated many religions have been in debate with each other. Over the last six hundred years each religion has made their own distinct differences separating themselves apart from the other religions. Each of the religions seems to believe in the same basic beliefs, but they all differ in their own way. If we all believe in the same thing, why are there different religions? Why do we do things differently if we believe in the same principles? What don’t we understand amongst each other? All of these questions have gone unanswered for a very long time, but I’m going to thoroughly answer them today.\n\nThe Bible says in Matthew 28:19-20, “Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.” This is known as “the Great Commission.” The Great Commission is a joint mission between us and the Holy Spirit. Acts 1:4-8 says, “And being assembled together with them, He commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the Promise of the Father, 'which, ' He said, 'you have heard from Me; for John truly baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now. ' Therefore, when they had come together, they asked Him, saying, 'Lord, will You at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? ' and He said to them, 'It is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father has put in His own authority. But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the Earth. '” You cannot accomplish the Great Commission on your own, you have to have the Holy Spirit."
