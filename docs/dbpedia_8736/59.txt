Portugal, a country known for its rich culture, stunning landscapes, and significant maritime history, also has a fascinating and complex history of warfare. From the establishment of its independence in the 12th century to its participation in the global conflicts of the 20th century, Portuguese war history is replete with notable battles, strategic alliances, and influential military figures. For language learners, understanding this history not only provides context to the Portuguese culture but also enriches vocabulary knowledge, particularly terms related to war and conflict.

Early Conflicts and the Foundation of Portugal

The history of Portuguese warfare begins with the Reconquista, a series of military campaigns by Christian states to recapture territory taken by Muslims on the Iberian Peninsula. The most significant event in this period for Portugal was the Battle of Ourique in 1139, where Afonso I, also known as Afonso Henriques, defeated the Moors and declared himself the first King of Portugal.

Understanding these terms helps in grasping the importance of the early battles that established Portugal as an independent kingdom, distinct from the larger Spanish entities.

Portugal’s golden era, known as the Age of Discovery, began in the 15th century with explorers like Vasco da Gama and Pedro Álvares Cabral.
