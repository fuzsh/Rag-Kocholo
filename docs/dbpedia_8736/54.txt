History of Portugal Restoration of Independence Day

On December 1, 1640, a small group of conspirators stormed the royal palace in Lisbon and deposed the Vicereine of Portugal. Margaret of Savoy tried to calm the Portuguese people during demonstrations in the Terreiro do Paço, at the time, Lisbon’s main square, but her efforts failed. King João IV, the head of Portugal’s senior noble family, accepted the throne on the same day he was offered it. King João IV’s entire reign was dominated by his fight to keep Portugal from being conquered by Spain. On June 12, 1641, Portugal and the Dutch Republic signed a treaty of alliance. It was not respected by either party and had no effect on Brazil or Angola, which were under Dutch occupation at the time.

Shortly after Afonso VI came of age in 1662, Luís de Vasconcelos e Sousa, 3rd Count of Castelo Melhor, befriended the mentally deficient king. He convinced the king that his mother was plotting to steal his throne and exile him from Portugal. Afonso asserted himself as ruler, sending his mother to a convent and appointing Castelo Melhor as his secret notary. This position allowed Castelo Melhor to exercise the functions of the first minister. Because of Afonso’s weakness, Castelo Melhor became the virtual dictator of Portugal.

The Treaty of Lisbon with Spain, signed in 1668, ended 28 years of war. The regent of Spain, Mariana of Austria, acted in the name of her young son Charles II of Spain and, after a series of negotiations between representatives from both countries, finally recognized the legitimacy of the Portuguese monarch. Portugal kept all of its remaining overseas colonies, except Ceuta on the north African coast, which didn’t recognize the Bragança Dynasty during the war.
