        "text": "John IV (born March 18/19, 1604, Vila Viçosa, Port.—died Nov. 6, 1656, Lisbon) was the king of Portugal from 1640 as a result of the national revolution, or restoration, which ended 60 years of Spanish rule. He founded the dynasty of Bragança (Braganza), beat off Spanish attacks, and established a system of alliances.\n\nJohn, duke of Bragança, the wealthiest nobleman in Portugal, married Luisa de Guzmán, daughter of the Spanish duke of Medina Sidonia. The Bragança duchy, founded in 1461, was a collateral of the extinct royal House of Aviz; and, when the restorers of independence overthrew the Spanish governor on Dec. 1, 1640, they offered John the crown. On December 15 he was enthroned as John IV. Supported by the Cortes, the national assembly, he entrusted each province with its own defense and sent missions to seek recognition from France, England, and the Netherlands. His alliance with the English Stuarts (1642) was frustrated by the English Civil Wars, but in 1654 John made a new treaty with the English Commonwealth, which gained him military aid in return for trading privileges. The Dutch, already in possession of Pernambuco in northeastern Brazil, seized Angola but were expelled from both, while retaining their conquests in the East Indies. The Spanish were defeated at Montijo (May 26, 1644) and were blocked from further invasion.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nKings and Emperors (Part III) Quiz\n\nJohn IV and his Queen Leonor governed through a royal council and a committee of the Cortes, the Board of Three Estates, and instituted the Overseas Council. He survived attempts at assassination and Spanish attempts to influence the Vatican to isolate the Portuguese church. John was a notable composer."
