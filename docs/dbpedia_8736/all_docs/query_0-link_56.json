        "text": "Context and Background for the Warrior Women Ballads\n\nBy Robert Chapman-Morales\n\nThis compilation of conflicts and wars that England was involved in during the 17th and 18th centuries is meant to allow users a general understanding not only of the conflicts that are alluded to in the ballads, but also to understand the mindset of the ballads’ intended audience. Life during these centuries revolved around uncertainty, the subjugation of foreigners for the purposes of imperialization, and a rise in the need for soldiers and sailors to fight these increasingly violent and disparate conflicts. For a more expansive list of conflicts and wars that England has been involved in, see the Wikipedia article, “List of Wars Involving England,” from which the information in this resource can be found.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis compilation of conflicts and wars that England was involved in during the 17th and 18th centuries is meant to allow users a general understanding not only of the conflicts that are alluded to in the ballads, but also to understand the mindset of the ballads’ intended audience. Life during these centuries revolved around uncertainty, the subjugation of foreigners for the purposes of imperialization, and a rise in the need for soldiers and sailors to fight these increasingly violent and disparate conflicts. The following tables and information are a selective and condensed version of the Wikipedia site “List of Wars Involving England” that contains a full list of the wars and conflicts that England has been involved in.\n\nThis compilation is divided into two sections: the 17th Century and the 18th Century (the centuries of the Warrior Women Ballads). Each section of this resource has a link to the respective century on the Wikipedia site “List of Wars Involving England” from which the information provided is drawn from. All dates listed and information provided comes from the Wikipedia site, but for each section, the information has been condensed and focused to only those conflicts, and other information, that is directly applicable to the Warrior Women Battles. As such, this resource can be used while reading the ballads to quickly find information from these centuries that is applicable to the ballads. Each table shows the major conflicts for England and the important Allies and Enemies for England during that conflict. This table also includes an Outcomes section that is meant to show the important results of the battle and possible connections to themes seen in the ballads. After the tables, there is a section that briefly synthesizes the importance of these battles to an understanding of the Warrior Women Ballads produced during this time period. This section is drawn in part from the Wikipedia site, while also containing an analysis of the information on the Wikipedia site and how it relates to the context of the Warrior Women Ballads.\n\nBoth centuries continue to show the hostility between England and France and Spain. Conflicts between these nations occurred since before the middle ages as each country attempted to establish dominance over the other. Going into the 17th Century, Spain had the upper hand in its efforts to create an empire (“Spanish Empire“), but depending on the goal for any given conflict, these nations would become allies or enemies accordingly as can be seen in the following tables. The ultimate goal for each country was expansion through whatever means necessary.\n\nThe following tables are a highly simplified version of history drawn from the Wikipedia site “List of Wars Involving England” focusing on how naval life and Empire building became a normal way of life during the time of the ballads. The focus has also been to highlight events that are of primary importance for understanding the setting of the ballads. Furthermore, the constant desire to expand the growing English Empire led to a need to recruit sailors and soldiers. There was a level of desperation, especially as the wars financially drained England (for one such example, see “Peace of Ryswick“). This made it possible for the female to male crossdressing seen the ballads to be a very realistic possibility and the ballads explore the potential presented to citizens during these centuries of uncertainty and imperialization that left countries vulnerable at home.\n\n17th Century (1601-1700) Major Conflicts for England\n\nA more expansive list of conflicts in this century can be found at “List of Wars Involving England”\n\nEditorial Notes\n\n*Dutch-Portuguese War was ongoing through most of this century, but England was mostly involved until 1641\n\n**This conflict begins before the English Civil War that ended the Monarchy (the execution of Charles I) and ends after the Monarchy is restored (the crowning of Charles II after exile)\n\n***English Civil War occurred simultaneously with England’s quest for colonial conquest of other countries. Shows the difficulty of expansion while also maintaining peace at home.\n\n****More or less the same war for England as the Third Anglo-Dutch War. The outcome mainly differed for the other countries involved.\n\nImportance to the Warrior Women Ballads (17th Century)\n\nThis century was one of tumultuous change for England as it sought to establish itself as a viable Empire. Overall, this century was one in which prominent nations sought to establish themselves as an empire by expanding the territories they held for strategic purposes. The rise in commerce during this period meant a need for prominence as a naval power in order to control the seas (the trade routes for commerce during this time). Empires and the rise in naval powers became a normal way of life by the next century.\n\nThe 17th century also saw the rise in the armies of empires, which further shows the reason that enlisting for war is such a common theme during the 17th Century ballads. Armies usually were around 25,000 but as a result of these constant wars, the standard army rose to over 100,000 by the end of the century (to learn more about this statistic, see “Peace of Ryswick“). This was unsustainable in these economies because industrialization had not happened in which mass production of war materials would become possible (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Ryswick#Background).\n\nIt is also important to note that the naval power of Spain was unmatched during this century. Spain had control of New World (America) (for more about Spain’s imperial power, see “Spanish Empire“) – the setting of some of the Warrior Women Ballads when England eventually became more powerful than Spain and expanded there during the next century. The Spanish Empire reached its peak in the 18th Century and was surpassed by England at that time (“Spanish Empire“).\n\nOverall, this constant state of war for England and the uncertainty involving their home country led many citizens to have lives of uncertainty. This uncertainty in England made it impossible for the King and government to enforce laws against counterfeiting, so it was a ripe time for disguise and adventure. It also was a time in which propaganda was necessary in order to enlist soldiers for wars that were so costly that the government could not guarantee payment for sailors and instead relied on their sense of national pride. The class system became more apparent during this period as poverty forced many to enlist and put themselves in danger. Yet, even for the nobility the 17th century was a time of uncertainty. It thus makes sense that the ballads during this period were concerned with life on the sea, but also the uncertainty of existence.\n\n18th Century (1701-1800) Major Conflicts for England\n\nA more expansive list of conflicts in this century can be found in the Wikipedia article, “List of Wars Involving England in the 18th Century”\n\nImportance to the Warrior Women Ballads (18th Century)"
