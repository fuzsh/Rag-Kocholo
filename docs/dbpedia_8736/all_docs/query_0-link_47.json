What starts as a coup d'etat is transformed into a true revolution. A flower vendor begins distributing carnations, first to the soldiers, who place the stems in the muzzles of their rifles, then to civilians, who attach the flowers to their chests. Thus emerges the carnation revolution and the restoration of democracy. One year later, the Portuguese people vote freely for the first time.\n\n12 June 1985: Adhesion to the European Union\n\nPortugal signs a treaty to join the European Economic Community (EEC).
