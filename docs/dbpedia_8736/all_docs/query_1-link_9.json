        "text": "Restoration of Independence Day (PRT) History\n\nPortugal Restoration of Independence Day, or Dia da RestauraÃ§Ã£o da IndependÃªncia, celebrates the country's regained sovereignty from Spanish rule. The observance aims to commemorate the bravery and determination of the Portuguese people, who played a crucial role in restoring their nation's independence.\n\nThe roots of Portugal Restoration of Independence Day can be traced back to 1640 when a group of Portuguese nobles, instigated by the Duchess of Mantua, led a revolutionary movement against the Spanish governance of Habsburg rule. On December 1st, 1640, Portuguese rebels successfully overthrew the then Spanish-appointed governor, effectively establishing the sovereignty of the House of Braganza. This historical event embodies the spirit of unity and solidarity among European nations in advocating for independence, human rights, and democratic values.\n\nPortugal allows cities and towns across the EU to participate in various cultural and educational activities organized on Restoration of Independence Day. These activities provide an opportunity for EU citizens to learn more about Portugal's rich history and traditions while fostering cultural exchange and mutual understanding among member states. Portugal Restoration of Independence Day takes place annually on December 1st."
