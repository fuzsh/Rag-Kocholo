        "text": "The Kingdom of Portugal is a nation in Europe that is a Client State of the Spanish Empire located west of the Empire's mainland Spain.\n\nHistory[]\n\nEarly History[]\n\nIt was in existence from 1139 until 1910. After 1415, it was also known as the Kingdom of Portugal and the Algarves, and between 1815 and 1822, it was known as the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. The name is also often applied to the Portuguese Empire, the realm's extensive overseas colonies.\n\nThe nucleus of the Portuguese state was the County of Portugal, established in the 9th century as part of the Reconquista, by Vímara Peres, a vassal of the King of Asturias. The county became part of the Kingdom of León in 1097, and the Counts of Portugal established themselves as rulers of an independent kingdom in the 12th century, following the battle of São Mamede. The kingdom was ruled by the Alfonsine Dynasty until the 1383–85 Crisis, after which the monarchy passed to the House of Aviz.\n\nDuring the 15th and 16th century, Portuguese exploration established a vast colonial empire. From 1580 to 1640, the Kingdom of Portugal was in personal union with Habsburg Spain.\n\nAfter the Portuguese Restoration War of 1640–1668, the kingdom passed to the House of Braganza and thereafter to the House of Braganza-Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. From this time, the influence of Portugal declined, but it remained a major power due to its most valuable colony, Brazil. After the independence of Brazil, Portugal sought to establish itself in Africa, but was ultimately forced to halt its expansion due to the 1890 British Ultimatum, eventually leading to the collapse of the monarchy in the 5 October 1910 revolution and the establishment of the First Portuguese Republic.\n\nPortuguese Republic (Provisional Government Phase)[]\n\nOn 6 October 1910, newspaper Diário do Governo announced: \"To the Portuguese people — Constitution of the Provisional Government of the Republic — Today, 5 October 1910, at eleven o'clock in the morning, was proclaimed the Portuguese Republic in the grand hall of the Palaces of Lisbon Municipality, after the end of the National Revolution movement. The Provisional Government was constituted immediately: Presidency, Dr Joaquim Teófilo Braga. Interior, Dr. António José de Almeida. Justice, Dr. Afonso Costa. Treasury, Basílio Teles. War, António Xavier Correia Barreto. Navy, Amaro Justiniano de Azevedo Gomes. Foreign (Relations), Dr. Bernardino Luís Machado Guimarães. Public Works, Dr. António Luís Gomes.\"\n\nBy decree on 8 October, the Provisional Government determined the new names of the ministries, with the most important changes being made to the ministries of the Kingdom, Treasure and Public Works, which were renamed ministries of Interior, Finances and Development. However, Basílio Teles refused the position and, on the 12th, it was given to José Relvas. On 22 November, Brito Camacho entered government after the departure of António Luís Gomes, appointed Portuguese ambassador in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nDuring its time of power, the Provisional Government took a series of important measures that had long-lasting effects. To calm tempers and make reparations with the victims of the monarchy, a broad amnesty was granted for crimes against the security of the State, against religion, of disobedience, of forbidden weaponry usage, etc. The Catholic Church resented the measures taken by the Provisional Government. Among these were the expulsion of the Society of Jesus and other religious orders of the Regular clergy, the closure of convents, the prohibition of religious teaching in schools, the abolition of the religious oath in civil ceremonies and a secularisation of the State by the separation of Church and State. Divorce was institutionalised, as were the legality of civil marriage, the equality of the marriage rights of men and women, the legal regulation of \"natural children\"; the protection of childhood and old age, the reformulation of the Press laws, the elimination of royal and noble ranks and titles and the acknowledgment of right to strike action. The Provisional Government also opted for the dissolution of the then municipal guards of Lisbon and Porto, creating instead a new public body of defence an order, the National Republican Guard. For the colonies, new legislation was created in order to grant autonomy to overseas territories, an essential condition for their development. The national symbols were modified — the flag and the national anthem, a new monetary unit was adopted — the escudo, equivalent to a thousand réis, and even the Portuguese orthography was simplified and appropriately regulated through the Orthographic Reform of 1911.\n\nThe Provisional Government enjoyed extensive power until the official launch of the National Constituting Assembly on 19 June 1911, following the election of 28 May of the same year. At that time, the president of the Provisional Government, Teófilo Braga, handed over to the National Constituting Assembly the powers he had received on 5 October 1910. Nevertheless, the Assembly approved with acclaim the proposal presented by their president, Anselmo Braamcamp Freire to the congress: \"The National Constituting Assembly confirms, until future deliberation, the functions of the Executive Power to the Provisional Government of the Republic\".\n\nTwo months later, with the approval of the Political Constitution of the Portuguese Republic and the election of the first constitutional president of the Republic — Manuel de Arriaga — on 24 August, the Provisional Government presented its resignation, which was accepted by the president of the republic on 3 September 1911, marking the end of a government term of more than 10 months and the beginning of the First Portuguese Republic.\n\nPortuguese Republic (Second Phase)[]\n\nThe eight years of the First Republic saw nine presidents and 44 ministries, and were altogether more of a transition from Monarchy to Republic. The Republic was recognized by Britain which to Manuel II was an act of treachery.\n\nThe First Republic was intensely anti-clerical. The leaders of the Republic were secularists and, indeed, were following liberal tradition of disestablishing the powerful role the Catholic Church once held. Historian Stanley Payne points out, \"The majority of Republicans took the position that Catholicism was the number one enemy of individualist middle-class radicalism and must be completely broken as a source of influence in Portugal.\" Under the leadership of Afonso Costa, the justice minister, the revolution immediately targeted the Catholic Church: churches were plundered, convents were attacked and clergy were harassed. Scarcely had the provisional government been installed when it began devoting its entire attention to an anti-religious policy, in spite of the disastrous economic situation. On 10 October – five days after the inauguration of the Republic – the new government decreed that all convents, monasteries and religious orders were to be suppressed. All residents of religious institutions were expelled and their goods confiscated. The Jesuits were forced to forfeit their Portuguese citizenship. A series of anti-Catholic laws and decrees followed each other in rapid succession. On 3 November, a law legalizing divorce was passed and then there were laws to recognize the legitimacy of children born outside wedlock, authorize cremation, secularize cemeteries, suppress religious teaching in the schools and prohibit the wearing of the cassock. In addition, the ringing of church bells to signal times of worship was subjected to certain restraints, and the public celebration of religious feasts was suppressed. The government also interfered in the running of seminaries, reserving the right to appoint professors and determine curricula. This whole series of laws authored by Afonso Costa culminated in the law of Separation of Church and State, which was passed on 20 April 1911.\n\nThe republicans were anticlerical and had a \"hostile\" approach to the issue of church and state separation, like that of the French Revolution, and the future Mexican Constitution of 1917. On 24 May 1911, Pope Pius X issued the encyclical Iamdudum which condemned the anticlericalism of the new republic for its deprivation of religious civil liberties and the \"incredible series of excesses and crimes which has been enacted in Portugal for the oppression of the Church.\n\nWorld War I[]\n\nPortugal participated in World War I to protect it's colonies in Africa from falling into German hands, however they had trouble with the natives in those colonies fighting against them. Sadly the Republic had failed to serve it's purpose as the glorious government of the Portuguese as the Germans took Portugal's remaining African colonies and Japan took Macau (which fell into the hands of the Kuomintang). Sadly because of that the Republic then started to collapse as the war progressed and the Spanish gained more power. The Spanish then collaborated with the Monarchists in Portugal as they overthrew the Republic and replaced the Republic by restoring the Monarchy. Manuel II returned from exile and was declared King of Portugal as the country itself was exiting the war. The British fearing to loose an ally tried to help restore the Republic, but it failed as the British were bombarded resulting in the deaths of many in which the Republic failed to come back and the Portuguese Monarchy remained in power.\n\nAnti-Monarchist Revolution[]\n\nAfter the war the Monarchists and the Monarchy had troublesome rebellions against it by the Socialists who wanted to overthrow them to restore the Republic so the Socialists can represent their agenda. Sadly for them the Monarchy won and still continued, but the Socialists escaped to The Comintern Confederacy. Then hordes of Republicans tried to overthrow the Monarchy but they were put down immediately by the Spanish to keep the Monarchy in power. Manuel II was not pleased with the Spanish got involved and killed all the Republican rebels and their families fearing that he is not just the king of a worthless kingdom but also a Spanish proxy.\n\nDeath of Manuel II[]\n\nManuel II died in Lisbon in 1932 as his widow Augusta Victoria of Hohenzollern then retreaded to live with her aunt Princess Maria Immaculata of Bourbon-Two Sicilies and her uncle Prince Johann Georg of Saxony in their residence of Schloss Weesenstein. Duratre II (b. 1907) a distant cousin of Manuel II then became King and he married Princess Marie Luise (b. 1908) who is the adoptive daughter of Princess Dorothea Maria Henriette Auguste Louise of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and her husband Ernst Gunther, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein.\n\nGovernment[]\n\nPortugal is a Constitutional Monarchy ruled by a Monarch who is a Symbolic Figurehead since it's restoration as a Prime Minister appointed by the Monarch himself took charge of the Government. Other than that the Monarch is in charge of the Military and all institutions of Society and he is praised as the ruler of Portugal who's reign lasts eternal. The Government is under control of the National Union Party, Monarchists and Fascists who are all proxies of the Falange Española de las JONS which helped the Monarchists restore the Monarchy. Elections are banned to prevent Republicans from hijacking them and trying to restore the \"failed republic\" and prevent a civil war that might result in Portugal in entering Anarchy or loosing the Sovereignty it has left.\n\nAdministration of Portugal\n\nKing: Duarte II\n\nPrime Minister: A. Oliveira Salazar\n\nForeign Minister: Alfredo Pimenta\n\nArmament Minister: Alberto Monsaraz\n\nMinister of Defense: Mario Pais Sousa\n\nMinister of Intelligence: Aquilino Ribeiro\n\nChief of Staff: J.A.

The Army is being reorganized with Spanish, Imperial French and Italian Aid.\n\nArmy[]\n\nThe Army has 100 Infantry Brigades that have outdated Spanish, French and Italian equipment.\n\nNavy[]\n\nThe Navy only is large enough to cover the coast of Portugal and it only consists of Destroyers and Submarines.\n\nAir Force[]\n\nThe Air Force has 100 outdated Italian, French and Spanish warplanes.\n\nEconomy[]\n\nPortugal's economy was crap ever since the Revolution to oust the monarchy and the Revolution that restored the monarchy. The cities are poor and not well organized as there are constant street fights between soldiers loyal to the Monarchists, Nationalists, Militarists, Conservatives and Fascists and the Liberals, and Republicans.\n\nForeign Relations[]"
