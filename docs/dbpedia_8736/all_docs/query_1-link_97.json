        "text": "The tenth All-African Women's Conference took place in Dar es Salaam in 1972. Maria Luísa Costa Dias represented the Portuguese Movement of Democratic Women (Movimento Democrático de Mulheres, MDM), a “unitary, progressive, antifascist movement”,Footnote 1 which was founded at the end of the 1960s in the context of the mobilization of the unitary movement of democratic opposition, the Commission for Democratic Elections (CDE), against the Estado Novo dictatorship.Footnote 2 Costa Dias had a long history of political militancy against Portugal's Estado Novo, a conservative, authoritarian corporatist regime that launched in 1933. Arrested in 1953 and accused of membership of the Portuguese Communist Party (Partido Comunista Português, PCP), Costa Dias spent one year in prison. She was arrested again in 1958; and, after four years and an international campaign, she left Caxias prison in April 1962. She continued to be engaged in political activism from exile in Algeria, where a Patriotic Front of National Liberation (Frente Patriótica de Libertação Nacional, FPLN) had been constituted by various left-wing elements, including PCP members. Costa Dias became an internationally known personality, travelling across Europe, Africa, and Latin America, and denouncing the conditions of Estado Novo's political prisoners. She became the FPLN's delegate abroad and represented the MDM inside the Women's International Democratic Federation (WIDF). Costa Dias's presence at the All-African Women's Conference and the meeting's opening dedication to women struggling – and often fighting – against the Portuguese army in Angola, Guinea-Bissau, and Mozambique exemplify the existence of a larger history of global contacts and encounters among women (Figure 1)."
