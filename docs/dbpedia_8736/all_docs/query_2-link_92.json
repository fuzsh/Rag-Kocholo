        "text": "State Department and Foreign Affairs Records\n\nRecords of the Foreign Service Posts of the Department of State (RG 84)\n\nPortugal\n\nPortugal, under the rule of Antonio Salazar, remained a neutral throughout the war, despite the terms of her alliance with Great Britain. Portugal had a centuries-old alliance with the British, as well as close economic and trade relations (Great Britain was Portugal's leading trading partner), as well as Portugal's dependence on United States petroleum, coal, and chemical supplies, which influenced its conduct during the war, and thus could be described at one level as a pro-Allied neutral. And yet Portugal carefully maintained a balance in its trade between the Allies and the Axis. After all, Germany was Portugal's second largest trade partner, and enjoyed significant advantages, particularly after Germany's occupation of France gave it a direct overland route to the Iberian Peninsula, through which it could both supply Portugal with greater quantities of imports than the Allies and pose a military threat if Portugal attempted to curtail exports important to the German war effort.\n\nThe Germans had many financial interests and ties with the Portuguese. I.G. Farben and other major German concerns, such as E. Merck and Siemens, had fairly large interests in Portugal. The official German purchasing agency in Portugal during the war was Soc. Financiera Industrial Ltda .(SOFINDUS). This organization purchased Portuguese products for the Germans and coordinated the operations of various German firms in Portugal.\n\nPortugal allowed Great Britain to trade and receive credit backed by the pound, allowing the British to obtain vital goods at a time when it was short on gold and escudos. By 1945 the British owed Portugal over $322 million under this arrangement.\n\nPortugal provided the Axis less formal but also advantageous trade facilities, permitting Germany and Italy to incur sizable debts in their clearing agreements with Portugal and advancing them significant amounts of escudos in government and private contracts. Deficits under the Portuguese clearing agreement with Germany averaged between $5-9 million between 1943 and 1944. Also, Portuguese merchants were an important source of vital smuggled commodities to the Axis, including industrial diamonds and platinum from Africa and Latin America.\n\nThe heated competition between the belligerents for its important resources greatly benefited Portugal's economy and generated large profits for its businesses and banks. Although the Allies took a far greater share of Portugal's strategic goods during the war than the Axis did, Portugal exported one material to Germany without which, the Allies believed, Germany could not continue to wage war: wolfram, which when refined into tungsten and used in the steel-hardening process had myriad vital industrial and military uses. Germany and Portugal negotiated secret agreements in accordance with which Portugal exported an average of over 2,000 metric tons of wolfram to Germany annually between 1941 and mid-1944, about 60 percent of Germany's estimate minimum industrial requirement.\n\nGermany paid for its Portuguese imports, including wolfram, with German goods and escudos, as well as gold (most of which came through Switzerland) and Swiss francs purchased with gold. Estimates of the total amount of looted gold received by Portugal ranged from $50.5 million to $106.6 million. When pushed by the Allies for information about the gold it had received, Portugal did not respond.\n\nThe Allies' objective was to purchase enough of wolfram to satisfy Portugal's export demands and prevent as much as possible from going to the enemy. Portugal's trade with the Allies and Axis worked to its great advantage as both sides paid inflated prices for wolfram. Portugal profited so much from the wolfram trade that it maintained its wolfram exports to Germany well into 1944 in the face of growing from the Allies to curtail that trade, which was far more important to the German war effort than to that of the Allies.\n\nIn January 1944, the Allies began to pressure Salazar to embargo all wolfram sales, but Portugal resisted, defending its right as a neutral to sell to anyone and fearing that any reduction in its exports would prompt Germany to attack Portuguese shipping, bomb Portuguese cities, or even launch an invasion from occupied France across Spain. The United States could have used greater threat of an oil embargo to compel Portugal to end the trade with Germany, but they placed greater importance on negotiating access to air and naval bases on the Azores. Portugal, despite its neutrality, granted the British access to the Azores bases in October 1943 and extended such access to the United States a year later.\n\nOn the eve of the D-Day invasion in June 1944, after the Allies threatened economic sanctions, the Portuguese government imposed a complete embargo on wolfram exports to both the Allies and the Axis.\n\nAnticipating Germany's collapse, the Portuguese Government on March 18, 1945, issued a decree on \"movable property\" which recognized the United Nations' position on loot. On May 14, 1945, the full Safehaven objectives suggested to the Portuguese Government by the American Embassy were achieved. In an official decree Portugal declared adherence to Bretton Woods Resolution VI, froze all German assets regardless of custody or location, arranged for a census of German assets and nationals, and prohibited the importation and exportation of foreign currency. The Portuguese Government took over German official establishments in Portugal \"pending the emergence of a government in Germany.\"\n\nNegotiations with Portugal for the restoration of looted gold, estimated by the Allies in July 1946, at $139.3 million, and the disposition of German external assets, estimated in June 1946 at $36.8 million, began in September 1946. The Allies initially sought about $51 million (Investigations in 1947, however, indicated that the Bank of Portugal had received between $43 million and $53 million), but Portugal offered only $4.4 million for which it expected full compensation from liquidated German assets. The two sides reached a tentative accord in February 1947, in which the Portuguese agreed to give up roughly $4 million in liquidated German assets in exchange for as much as $7.2 million for their claims against Germany. But the accord was not implemented because of an impasse over looted gold.\n\nThe Allies lost some of their negotiating leverage when the United States unblocked Portuguese assets in the United States in August 1948.\n\nAs gold negotiations dragged on into the 1950s and the value of these assets depreciated the State Department grew frustrated and convinced a reluctant Treasury Department to agree to Portugal's terms. The Department of State also feared that the impasse might jeopardize what it considered to be the more important strategic goal of gaining United States access to an Azores air base and integrating Portugal into postwar Europe. Finally, in October 1958 the United States, Great Britain, France, Portugal and West Germany reached an agreement, and in December 1959 Portugal delivered $552,000 to the Allies and about $4.5 worth of gold to the Tripartite Gold Commission. In addition, Germany paid Portugal about $13.7 million to reimburse it for the gold and to cover its wartime damage claims, for which Germany received still-unliquidated German assets in Portugal. (Note 88)\n\nRecords of The U.S. Embassy, Lisbon, Portugal\n\nLisbon was the chief distribution port for International Red Cross Committee relief supplies to prisoner-of-war and internment camps; the main link for civilian flights between the United Kingdom and the United States; and, a notorious center for spies.\n\nLisbon became the center for tens of thousands of refugees from Central Europe, the Low Countries, and France. The Portuguese Government allowed Jewish organizations to relocate from occupied Europe to Lisbon during the war. Although Portugal sought in 1940 to halt the entry of refugees and the issuance of visas for them, many Portuguese disregarded their government's policies. Aristides de Sousa Mendes, a Portuguese diplomat in Bordeau, France, disobeyed his government's orders and issued 10,000 visas before he was recalled and dismissed. During 1941 and 1942 the Portuguese Government allowed 5,000 refugees to pass through Portugal to the United States.\n\nGeneral Records 1936-1945, 1950-1952 (Entry 3126)\n\nBoxes 1-137\n\n1941\n\nBox# File #
