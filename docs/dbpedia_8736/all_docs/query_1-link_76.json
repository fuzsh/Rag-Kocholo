        "text": "853B.7962/11–347: Telegram\n\nThe Ambassador in Portugal (Wiley) to the Secretary of State\n\n910. I saw Dr. Salazar for 1 hour 35 minutes this evening, discussed Lagens with him in greatest detail. He reverted to familiar theme song about necessity for finding “formula”. Tasked him what he had in mind. He replied that he hadn’t reached a decision; that he would immediately confer with Minister War on latter’s return Wednesday and would talk to General Cintra. He insisted that he wanted agreement that would permit no possibility of misunderstanding with US; he attached greatest importance to Portuguese relations with US and didn’t want them jeopardized; in formula it must be shown that Portugal had made “progress” from last agreement; that Portugal would be able to take additional technical services. He will communicate with me in course of present week.\n\nI urged continuation of present ideal situation existing in Lagens, insisted that exaggerated importance was being given to question of [Page 1046] formula, as when he raised question of Portugal susceptibilities (this always comes up) I suggested these were limited to a very few men in or near his government and did not preoccupy Portuguese public opinion. He replied this was true because public opinion had confidence he would take best decision to safeguard Portuguese interests. I replied that Portuguese public opinion had confidence in US. I repeatedly brought up December 2 deadline. He said and reiterated that he would try to work out acceptable formula as rapidly as possible. He hoped it would be done before December 2 but if he could not we could forget about December 2 and if we could not agree on a formula we could have “six, eight or twelve months, or whatever time we needed” for evacuation.\n\nI made strong plea for American personnel at Lagens to be able to bring families.\n\nMy conclusions are that in course of next week Salazar will gently place Azores baby in lap of General Cintra and will want an American general to come over in order to engage in long and very detailed negotiations. Salazar, I think, would prefer our staying in Azores for next millenium if Portuguese Government could dodge responsibility definite decision.\n\nThere is not the slightest manifestation of interest on part of Salazar with regard to any political guarantees (he is, I think, bright enough to know from realities of world situation Portugal already has in fact all guarantees in that he [that we?] could possibly give them). So far he has not shown the slightest interest in any agreement “for long-term base”. (ReDeptel 815, November 1, 2 p.m.)\n\nSalazar has excluded Foreign Minister from his conversations with me and has not even given Foreign Office copy of Cintra report.\n\n(ReEmbtel 889, October 291). I therefore urge that Department observe extreme reticence in talking with Pereira."
