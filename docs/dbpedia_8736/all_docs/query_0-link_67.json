        "text": "Spain and Portugal were united under King Philip II, King Philip III, and King Philip IV. The latter lost Portugal in the Portuguese Restoration War who were supported by France and England.\n\nNow the challenge is this: Keep Spain and Portugal united through King Philip's reign.\n\nNot hard. There would be more opportunities to secede but it was not an easy endeavour. The Count-Duke of Olivares dying, for instance, would be a good start.\n\nBonus if eventually Spain and Portugal unite like Aragon and Castille.\n\nHow so? Portugal did enter a dynastic union with the Spanish realms in a perfect analogue with Aragon and Castile's dynastic union...\n\nOr do you mean a de jure union like the Nueva Planta Decrees that scratched the autonomy of the realms of the Crown of Aragon and centralized Spain under the framework of what was previously the Crown of Castile?\n\nBonus if eventually Spain and Portugal unite like Aragon and Castille.\n\nI am not sure how to make Spain defeat Portugal's independence efforts and I feel that even if Spain won one war, the Portuguese would try again.\n\nBut as to uniting Spain and Portugal, that one is easy. If Portugal remains Spanish and some sort of French succession like the OTL War of Spanish Succession occurs, then any effort to unite Castile and Aragon into one monarchy would undoubtedly also involve Portugal.\n\nWhat I can't say is, ignoring butterflies, would Portugal's nationalist movement in a Spain with OTL style Autonomous Communities mirror the nationalist/independence movements of OTL Catalonia and the Basque Country.\n\nI am not sure how to make Spain defeat Portugal's independence efforts and I feel that even if Spain won one war, the Portuguese would try again.\n\nYeah. The key is avoiding this war. Removing Olivares like miguelrj suggests and having the king chose another \"valido\" that exerts less pressure on the non-Castillian kingdoms is a very good start. But of course, Portuguese and Catalonian resources were important for the wars of the crown, and it was not possible to press Castilla any further, so something had to give. A long term solution would be to give up on the northern territories like the United Provinces and the French Comte, and focus on the Ultramaritime and Mediterranean policies (after all, when Portugal joined the crown, it was with the approval of most of the Portuguese nobility, who saw in it a chance to improve the security of the Portuguese overseas colonies).\n\nBut as to uniting Spain and Portugal, that one is easy. If Portugal remains Spanish and some sort of French succession like the OTL War of Spanish Succession occurs, then any effort to unite Castile and Aragon into one monarchy would undoubtedly also involve Portugal.\n\nCorrect. But it's not unthinkable that Portugal could have supported the Borbon candidate, same as Castile (which would make the secession war shorter). In such a case, it's likely that Portugal could have kept their own institutions and laws, as the Borbons had ben adviced initially by the French monarchy, and as it indeed happened with the Basque country and Navarre.\n\nOn the other hand, if Portugal had supported the Austrian candidate, it might stall or turn around the result of the war. That could have meant the independence of Aragon and Portugal, or a more federal monarchy for a united peninsule, respectively."
