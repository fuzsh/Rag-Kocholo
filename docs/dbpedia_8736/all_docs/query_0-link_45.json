Click to download the free sample version Download sample\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe Portuguese Empire was the first and longest-lasting of the contemporary European colonial empires. It lasted over six centuries, from the seizure of Ceuta in 1415 to Macau’s restoration to China in 1999.\n\nSee the fact file below for more information about the Portuguese Empire, or download our 28-page Portuguese Empire worksheet pack for use in the classroom or home environment.\n\nKey Facts & Information\n\nHISTORICAL BACKGROUND\n\nPortugal began its expansion in 1415 by crossing the Gibraltar and seizing Ceuta from the Moors, who attempted unsuccessfully to retake it in 1418. In 1419, a storm drove two Prince Henry the Navigator’s captains, João Gonçalves Zarco and Tristão Vaz Teixeira, to Madeira. In 1427, another Portuguese navigator found the Azores.\n\nKing Edward of Portugal (1433–1438) led an expedition against Tangier in 1436 and was beaten, barely escaping destruction by releasing Prince Ferdinand, the king’s youngest brother. By sea, Prince Henry’s commanders continued to explore Africa and the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nIn 1434, Gil Eanes crossed Cape Bojador. The first cargo of enslaved people arrived in Lisbon in 1441, and the slave trade quickly became one of Portugal’s most successful industries.\n\nSenegal and Cape Verde were visited in 1445. António Fernandes nearly reached present-day Sierra Leone in 1446.\n\nIn 1474, an explorer named João Vaz Corte-Real gained a captaincy in the Azores for discovering Terra Nova dos Bacalhaus (New Land of Codfish) in 1472.\n\nAfonso V of Portugal claimed the Castilian-Leonese crown when he married Joanna, Princess of Castile, but Isabella declared herself queen. The Treaty of Alcáçovas, signed in 1479, granted Portugal exclusive navigation of the waters south of the Canary Islands. Under John II (1481–1495), the castle of São Jorge da Mina, now Elmina in Ghana, was erected to protect Guinea trading and served as Portugal’s West African base until 1637.\n\nTREATY OF TORDESILLAS\n\nThe idea of a maritime passage connecting Africa to India and the rest of Asia would provide Portugal with vast trading opportunities; therefore, it eagerly pushed the development of trade outposts and defensive bases.\n\nThe Papal Bull of 1493 and the Treaty of Tordesillas, signed on June 6, 1494, confirmed the Portuguese Empire. These two measures established an exclusive duopoly of the Portuguese and Spanish over the world outside of Europe.\n\nKing John II shifted the Pope’s initial recommendation for the line slightly west and accepted. However, in 1500, a new line was granted to Portugal, Brazil, and (what was then supposed to be) Newfoundland. Because John II’s projected distance was not “round” (370 leagues), some argue that Portugal was aware of those areas’ presence before the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494. John II died a year later, in 1495.\n\nHEIGHT OF THE EMPIRE\n\nPortugal ensured exclusive passage around Africa with the Treaty of Tordesillas, and Vasco da Gama arrived in India in 1498, establishing the first Portuguese settlements. Portugal soon became the focus of trade with the East.\n\nPortugal’s Empire grew from the Indian Ocean to the Persian Gulf as it competed with the Ottoman Empire to control the spice trade. Afonso de Albuquerque invaded the Huwala state of Hormuz at the Gulf’s head in 1515, making it a tributary state.\n\nWhile Portuguese ships explored Asia and South America, King Manuel I of Portugal granted authority to explore the North Atlantic to João Fernandes “Lavrador” in 1499 and the Corte-Real brothers in 1500 and 1501.\n\nLavrador discovered Greenland and most likely explored Labrador (which he named), while Miguel and Gaspar Corte-Real explored Newfoundland and Labrador, as well as potentially the majority, if not all, of Baffin Island’s east coast.\n\nIn 1516, João Álvares Fagundes surveyed the northern tip of Nova Scotia and the south coast of Newfoundland. In 1521, Fagundes was granted the captaincy of the territories he discovered and permission to establish a colony.\n\nIn 1530, John III arranged the colonization of Brazil with approximately 15 hereditary captain ships assigned to anyone who desired to oversee and explore them.\n\nHABSBURG KINGS\n\nIn 1583, Philip I of Portugal (also Philip II of Spain), a member of the House of Habsburg, sent his combined Iberian fleet to drive the French traders from the Azores, hanging his prisoners-of-war from the yardarms and adding to the Black Legend.\n\nPortugal launched a military expedition that conquered and evicted the French colonists of France Équinoxiale in 1615, less than four years after arriving there.\n\nOn the other hand, Spain’s adversaries, including the Netherlands and England, sought its overseas wealth and found it more straightforward to attack poorly fortified Portuguese outposts than Spanish ones. Between 1638 and 1640, the Netherlands took control of a portion of Brazil’s northeast, with Recife as their capital.\n\nEven though Dutch possessions in Brazil were destroyed, the Dutch could seize Ceylon, the Cape of Good Hope, the East Indies, and a portion of India and take over trade with Japan at Nagasaki throughout the seventeenth century. Portugal’s Asiatic colonies were reduced to bases in Macau, East Timor, and Portuguese India.\n\nWEALTH OF BRAZIL\n\nThe demise of the colonies was one factor that contributed to the dissolution of the private union with Spain. In 1640, John IV was proclaimed King of Portugal, and the Portuguese Restoration War commenced.\n\nThe Portuguese offered Bombay and Tangier to England as dowry in 1661. Over the next hundred years, the British progressively became the dominant trader in India, providing the foundations from which its empire would grow as the Mughal Empire disintegrated beginning in the second half of the eighteenth century, slowly excluding the trade of other powers in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.\n\nIn 1693, massive gold reserves were discovered in Minas Gerais, propelling Brazil to become the world’s most significant gold supplier in the 18th century. Voluntary immigration from Europe and the slave trade from Africa significantly boosted Brazil’s population; today, it is the world’s largest Portuguese-speaking country.\n\nDECLINE AND FALL\n\nThe cost and unpopularity of Portugal’s Colonial War (1961–1975), in which the country fought to crush growing nationalist movements in its African colonies, culminated in the Salazar regime’s demise in 1974. Defined as the “Carnation Revolution,” one of the initial acts of the democratic government that took power was to halt the wars and negotiate Portugal’s withdrawal from its African possessions.\n\nMoreover, the Community of Portuguese Language Countries includes Portugal and the seven former Portuguese colonies that have become autonomous countries with Portuguese as their official language.\n\nLEGACY\n\nPortugal’s dominion was frequently exploitative and harsh, as are most empires. It was intended to enrich Portugal, not to foster locally sustainable economies and political systems. Instead, Portugal opposed the process of decolonization until the expense of doing so became unbearable to the Army, the organization in charge of carrying out the colonial struggle. On the other side, the expertise of Portuguese navigators opened up many sea routes, allowing trade and commerce to flourish between the East and West.\n\nOn the other hand, the great voyages of exploration and colonialism, to which Portugal made substantial contributions, helped to weave the human family into a single global society. The world we live in today, which values respect for all people and increasingly accepts responsibility for their well-being and the health and completeness of the earth, is essentially the outcome of the Portuguese Empire’s legacy.\n\nPortuguese Empire Worksheets\n\nThis fantastic bundle includes everything you need to know about the Portuguese Empire across 28 in-depth pages.

They were the first Europeans to reach many regions, including Brazil and parts of Africa and Asia. Additionally, they facilitated cultural exchange, introducing European goods and ideas to new regions and vice versa.\n\nHow did the Portuguese Empire decline?\n\nThe decline of the Portuguese Empire can be attributed to various factors, including the rise of competing European powers, economic difficulties, and the loss of key territories. The 1755 Lisbon earthquake, which devastated the Portuguese capital, also had significant consequences. By the 19th century, many territories had gained independence or been seized by other colonial powers.\n\nWhat is the legacy of the Portuguese Empire today?\n\nThe Portuguese Empire left a lasting legacy, evident in the Portuguese language’s widespread use in former colonies, cultural influences, and architectural heritage. Additionally, it contributed to shaping global trade networks and intercontinental cultural exchanges. However, it also left complex legacies of colonization, including social, economic, and political challenges in many former colonies.\n\nLink/cite this page\n\nIf you reference any of the content on this page on your own website, please use the code below to cite this page as the original source.\n\nLink will appear as Portuguese Empire Facts & Worksheets: https://kidskonnect.com - KidsKonnect, June 19, 2024\n\nUse With Any Curriculum\n\nThese worksheets have been specifically designed for use with any international curriculum.
