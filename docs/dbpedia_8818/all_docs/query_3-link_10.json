        "text": "Bank of America Plaza is the tallest building in the Southeastern United States and is located within Atlanta’s Peachtree Corridor, the main commercial spine of the city leading northward from downtown. Originally constructed as the headquarters for NationsBank, the building’s name had changed twice as result of banking mergers. As a banking headquarters, an on-site retail bank was included in the design and is positioned in a 3 story podium arraigned as a westward extension from the main tower footprint which is centered into the middle of the block. The arraignment of the structure allows for two large landscaped plazas to flank the tower and serve as a transitioning element between the predominately commercial area to the south and a residential area to the north. The parks then serve as the main gateway for pedestrians reaching the tower, including those arriving from a subway station located across the street to the northwest.\n\nThe tower’s location on a hillside allows for different approaches towards the building as it interacts with the local streetscape, although all sides of the tower except the north end are set back from the property lines. Bank of America Plaza has four stories of below grade parking with vehicular entrances on all three boarding streets. The tower rises upward from the landscaped grounds with a granite façade and is rotated 45 degrees relative to the surrounding street network. The building has a series of small upper level setbacks and is crowned with an open framework pyramid and capped with a spire. The strong vertical lines of the stone piers which extend the full length of the façade recalls the Art-Deco style found skyscrapers of the 1920’s and early 1930’s before the onset of the Great Depression and was typical of skyscrapers designed in the postmodern design period.\n\nBank of America Plaza was constructed with a composite frame and was an early example of the use of supper columns, in which 2 large eight foot square columns are located at each of the edges of the tower as well as at the corners of the core, creating a structural grid offering a column free interior. The super columns are set into the façades of the tower and add exterior texture through 8 granite clad points extending continuously from the base of the tower towards the crown.\n\nBank of America Plaza has since its construction remained a key focal point of Atlanta’s linear skyline."
