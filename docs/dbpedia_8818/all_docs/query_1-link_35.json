Towering at 921 feet (280.7 meters) with 72 floors for commercial usage, this prestigious building is among the finest corporate addresses in the Central Business District (CBD). Completed in 1985, this iconic skyscraper has undergone several name changes in its existence. Its glistening modernist glass and steel facade is not only a landmark during the day but also during the night when it is luminous with colorful LED lights.",
