        "text": "55-story class-A office skyscraper on Bunker Hill, Los Angeles\n\nNot to be confused with Bank of America Building (Los Angeles).\n\nBank of America Plaza, formerly Security Pacific Plaza, is a 55-story, 224.03 m (735.0 ft) class-A office skyscraper on Bunker Hill, Los Angeles, California. It was completed in 1974 with the headquarters of Security Pacific National Bank, Capital Group Companies and Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton as its main tenants. The tower is the fifth tallest building in Los Angeles, and the 92nd-tallest building in the United States. In 2009 it had the highest assessed value of any office building in Los Angeles County. When it was constructed, Security Pacific Plaza was unique for Downtown Los Angeles, in that its four sides each faced true north, south, east and west. It has a total of 64 floors, 55 above ground and 9 basements, served by 30 elevators.[7]\n\nFrom when it opened in 1974 until 1992, it bore the Security Pacific Bank logo. This logo was removed when Bank of America acquired Security Pacific Bank. Featured in several motion pictures, such as being used as the fictional headquarters for Mattel in the film Barbie. Its plaza area was also filmed as that of the adjacent \"Peerless Building\" to the Glass Tower in The Towering Inferno (which was set in San Francisco), as well as the lawyer's office in the film Pretty Woman, and as Tex Richman's office headquarters in The Muppets. The tower was also used in establishing shots as the headquarters for the fictional company Denver-Carrington in the 1991 prime time soap opera Dynasty. The epilogue of Night of the Comet was filmed in the plaza, the tower having been prominently in the background of numerous scenes earlier in the film.\n\nThe building site is situated on 4.21 acres (1.70 ha) that features a formal garden with over 200 trees and three 24 ft (7.3 m) waterfalls. In front of the main entrance is the 42-foot (13 m) \"Four Arches\" sculpture by Alexander Calder.[8]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of tallest buildings in Los Angeles\n\nList of tallest buildings in the United States"
