        "text": "Bank of America is trading its longtime downtown office for new digs in Dallas’ Uptown district.\n\nThe bank plans to relocate about 1,000 workers from its signature Main Street skyscraper to an office tower to be built overlooking Klyde Warren Park.\n\nBank of America will be the lead tenant in the 30-story Parkside Uptown tower to be built by KDC and Pacific Elm Properties. The half-million-square-foot high-rise will be constructed at the northwest corner of Harwood Street and Woodall Rodgers Freeway.\n\nBank of America will occupy more than 238,000 square feet in the building. Construction on the high-rise is set to start before the end of the year.“This site overlooking Klyde Warren Park, amid an abundance of walkable Uptown Dallas amenities, is an ideal space to bring our team together in a central location where they can collaborate on behalf of our clients,” Bank of America’s Dallas President Jennifer Chandler said in a statement. “We look forward to being the signature tenant at the Bank of America Tower at Parkside as we provide a great place for our teammates to work as part of our longstanding commitment to Dallas.”\n\nBank of America and its predecessors in Dallas have occupied the 72-story Bank of America Plaza at 901 Main St. since the office tower opened in 1985. It’s Dallas’ tallest skyscraper.\n\nThe bank has leased about 500,000 square feet in the 1.85-million-square-foot tower.\n\nKDC has been working on the Uptown project since 2020. The building is planned in a partnership with site owner Miyama USA Texas.\n\n“This project’s start is a testament to Bank of America’s commitment to providing its employees with a best-in-class workplace in an unbeatable location,” Eric Hage, KDC executive vice president for development, said in a statement.\n\nPacific Elm Properties – which is downtown Dallas’ busiest developer with several projects underway – has joined development of the tower.\n\n“Bank of America Tower at Parkside is a reflection of Pacific Elm Properties’ commitment to developing exciting, Class-AA mixed-use projects in dynamic urban areas,” Tom Dundon, partner in Pacific Elm Properties, said in a statement. “The site is undoubtedly one of the best in all of Texas.”\n\nThe groundbreaking will add to the almost 2 million square feet of office space on the way in Dallas’ Uptown-Turtle Creek neighborhood. The area just north of downtown has the region’s highest office rents and is attracting companies moving from older buildings."
