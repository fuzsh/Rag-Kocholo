        "text": "The landlord of Dallas’ tallest skyscraper is looking to the future, while celebrating more than a quarter century ownership of the landmark downtown tower.\n\nThe 72-story Bank of America Plaza is Dallas’ biggest high-rise and one of the tallest buildings in the western United States.\n\nThe 1.85 million-square-foot Main Street office tower outlined with two miles of green lights has been owned since 1998 by Metropolis Investment Holdings, a Chicago-based real estate firm that manages assets for a German family investment group.\n\nAfter considering several offers to sell the building over the years, Metropolis Investment Holdings has hung onto what is its largest U.S. property.\n\n“Our flagship tower certainly is in Dallas. It’s our largest asset,” said Tom Dempsey, Metropolis Investment senior vice president.\n\nMetropolis Investment owns other landmark towers in downtown Houston, Chicago, San Francisco and Philadelphia. But none of them are as big as Bank of America Plaza.\n\n“We focus on trying to fill space in the building and it’s a big building,” Dempsey said.\n\nThe Dallas skyscraper is about 70% occupied.\n\nBut a recent announcement by namesake tenant Bank of America will leave multiple floors of the tower empty four years from now. That’s when Bank of America plans to move to a new tower being built in Uptown.\n\n“This wasn’t a surprise,” Dempsey said. “We’ve been very close to Bank of America and their decision-making process. We’re happy to see them stay through 2027.”\n\nIn the meantime, Dempsey said the owners plan to keep investing in upgrades in the downtown tower to keep other tenants and bring in new ones.\n\n“We have inked 750,000 square feet of transactions just in the last two years, which is more space leased than we have in our entire 6 million square-foot portfolio in the same time period,” he said.\n\nMetropolis Investment continues to put money into the almost 40-year-old tower.\n\nThe owners replaced Bank of America Plaza’s 9,000 feet of exterior lights with new LED bulbs in 2013. They also built a new entryway on Main Street.\n\n“We are always spending a lot of money on infrastructure. We added an outdoor area about a month ago,” said Russ Johnson, managing director with Jones Lang LaSalle, which leases and manages the tower. “It’s an ‘80s era building but because of the continuing annual investment it runs just as efficient as some of these brand new buildings.\n\n“No one owns a building for 25 years these days,” Johnson said. “It’s a generational long-term asset and they treat this like their home.”\n\nBank of America Plaza has also added a tenant lounge, training center and conference center on the 42nd floor.\n\nUnlike other office buildings facing debt challenges in the current capital markets, that isn’t an issue for Bank of America Plaza.\n\n“We have been debt free for the 25 years that we’ve owned Bank of America Plaza,” Dempsey said. “We bought it in cash. We fund it in cash. That gives us a position of strength in the market.”\n\nMetropolis Investment paid more than $300 million for the tower.\n\nThe building owner is already making plans for potential new uses for parts of the skyscraper.\n\n“We have done an analysis to convert to residential or to convert to hotel,” Dempsey said. “We think the hotel is a really viable prospect.\n\n“We’ve had interest in the hotel for a vacant block of floors between 23 and 32,” he said. “That has been reserved for a hotel. We would welcome a large tenant to take that space as well.”\n\nBank of America Plaza is one of Dallas’ most recognized buildings — still a standout on the growing skyline.\n\n“The building is an icon of the city,” Johnson said."
