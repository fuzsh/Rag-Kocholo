        "text": "Originally Posted by TeamLynn\n\nI think about 1/2 up there is/was a conference space. I doubt that is public, but maybe you can rent it. Don't remember any public viewing space, but then again don't remember any public viewing space in any of the buildings you mentioned besides Reunion, so what do I know.\n\nThere was a nice dining room in the Republic bank tower, high up, but not sure it was top floor. I believe that is apartments now.\n\nAt one time I think now what is Chase Tower, there was a catwalk on 1st floor where you could watch the trading room of whatever bank was there at the time. That was kind of cool. I think most of the building is getting ready to become a hotel and residence.\n\nI heard Bank of America is moving to uptown, so not sure if that is extra space or if they are vacating the \"green\" building. I guess some chance that could get turned into residential too, but it is a big building with not much parking, so not sure that would work or not."
