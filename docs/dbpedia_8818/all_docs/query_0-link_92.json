        "text": "Previously residing in the 72-story Bank of America Plaza on Main Street, the company is relocating to Parkside Uptown, a 30-story office tower in Uptown Dallas, bordering both the Arts District and Victory Park. Upon becoming the building’s signature tenant, Jennifer Chandler, Bank of America’s Dallas President, shared, “this site overlooking Klyde Warren Park, amid an abundance of walkable Uptown Dallas amenities, is an ideal space to bring our team together in a central location where they can collaborate on behalf of our clients.”\n\nDesigned to humanize the office building typology, the project features an amenity-filled podium, a sky lobby, and tenant-only fitness facilities. “This project’s start is a testament to Bank of America’s commitment to providing its employees with a best-in-class workplace in an unbeatable location,” Eric Hage, KDC executive vice president for development, said in a statement.\n\nDeveloped by KDC and Pacific Elm Properties, construction is scheduled to start before the end of the year, with the opening slated for 2027.\n\nRead the full article from The Dallas Morning News here."
