        "text": "Just a few steps away from downtown Dallas’ award-winning Klyde Warren Park will be a 500,000-square-foot Kohn Pederson Fox-designed trophy office tower. KDC and Pacific Elm Properties recently kicked off construction of the 30-story tower located at the corner of Woodall Rodgers Freeway and N Harwood Street.\n\nThe signature tenant, Bank of America, will occupy more than 238,000 square feet of the Class A office tower. Upon move-in, the tower will be known as Bank of America Tower at Parkside. Beneath this modern tower will be 8,000 square feet of ground-floor retail and a spectacular corner plaza.\n\nTenants will be able to enjoy the beauty of the five-acre Klyde Warren Park from any tower floor. One of the greatest vantage points will be on the 12th-floor Sky Lobby and Lounge, which will feature shared tenant space equipped with a coffee and cocktail bar, as well as outdoor terraces to encourage collaboration and relaxation. Bank of America Tower at Parkside will also incorporate an abundance of natural light with unobstructed downtown Dallas views.\n\nTenant safety and well-being were factored into the design plan. Parkside will feature the latest in safety standards and procedures throughout the building with touchless controls on doors, plumbing fixtures and elevators. Advanced air circulation and filtration methods along with an enhanced infection control mode of operations support a commitment to a healthy workplace.\n\nThe building’s location offers easy access to a variety of transportation options. Besides the abundant walking opportunities surrounding the future office building, the free M trolley runs down the street connecting to DART light rail and other Uptown locations. Commuters can utilize the Dallas North Tollway and Central Expressway, both minutes away offering easy access to Love Field and DFW Airport.\n\nParkside will perfectly tie amenities and innovative design with thoughtful practicality to create the ideal urban workplace in the heart of Dallas. KDC, Pacific Elm Properties, the Miyama Family, along with world-renowned architects Kohn Pedersen Fox and design firms Corgan and OJB Landscape Architecture, plan to complete the tower in the first half of 2027."
