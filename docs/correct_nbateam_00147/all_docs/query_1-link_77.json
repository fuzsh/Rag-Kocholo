        "text": "Ben Simmons wasn’t the only Sixer to walk out of Monday’s NBA awards ceremony with a trophy.\n\nTeammate Amir Johnson became the second-ever recipient of the league’s Hustle award.\n\n“This is definitely an honor,” Johnson said. “I pride myself on doing the little things on the court and I just want to say thank you to my teammates and coaches. This award means a lot.”\n\nThe Hustle award is given to the NBA player with the highest aggregate hustle score each year. The score is calculated on:\n\n• Players who played a minimum of 50 regular season games and at least 15 minutes per game.\n\n• Five hustle stats: screen assists, deflections, loose balls recovered, charges drawn and shot contests.\n\n• Players were compared by position (G/F/C) within each statistic on a per-minute basis.\n\nNBA\n\n• Within each statistic, a metric was calculated for each player based on his relative performance.\n\nJohnson, in his 14th season overall and first as a Sixer, averaged 2.5 screen assists, 1.0 deflections, 0.7 loose balls recovered, 0.08 charges drawn and 5.5 contested shots per game. He added 4.6 points and 4.5 rebounds a night as the team's primary reserve big man.\n\nThe veteran beat out Indiana’s Thaddeus Young, Cleveland’s Larry Nance Jr., Simmons and Anthony Davis to claim the award.\n\n“Amir Johnson is a true professional and meant so much to our team and locker room this past season,” Sixers head coach and interim general manager Brett Brown said in a statement. “His work ethic and grit had a significant positive impact on our program and culture, and I couldn’t be happier that he’s been recognized with this award.”\n\nMore on the Sixers\n\n• What LeBron wants in pitch from Sixers\n\n• Not a rookie? Try telling that to Ben Simmons' trophy case\n\n• Despite Embiid's claims, he's not league's best on defense\n\n• New branches on Sixers’ family tree built with character"
