        "text": "BOSTON — This is Amir Johnson’s time of year.\n\nWhile it’s not exactly fair to say that the Celtics starting power forward paces himself over the course of an 82-game regular season, it’s been clear over his two seasons in Boston that he ramps up his game as the games get bigger.\n\nSo it’s not surprising that Johnson delivered one of his best efforts of the season in one of the bigger games of the year when it comes to playoff seeding on Sunday, scoring 14 points on 6-of-6 shooting to go with seven rebounds and five assists in Boston’s 112-108 victory over the Miami Heat.\n\n“For me, it’s just recognizing it’s time to clean up our act,” Johnson said. “It’s been an up-and-down season for us all year. One thing we talk about as a group is that this is a time to really get better close to the postseason. We are focused on every game, getting better, cleaning up our act.”\n\nThe Celtics moved into a virtual tie for first place in the East, while remaining 2½ games clear of the third-place Washington Wizards, heading into Monday night’s action. While it hasn’t exactly been a smooth sail to the top in the East, the Celtics have been making steady progress on their course from the time they sat at 13-12 on Dec. 15.\n\nSince then, Boston has gone 35-14 — a .714 winning percentage. The Celtics enter Wednesday night’s game against the Milwaukee Bucks having won four in a row on their current six-game homestand, seven in a row overall at home, and 14 of their last 15 on the TD Garden parquet.\n\nMore and more often of late, Celtics coach Brad Stevens had cited the tone Johnson has set early as being key to the team’s play in victories. On Sunday, that active and aggressive play helped the Celtics stay in the game as they rallied from down 15 in the second quarter and burst ahead by 10 by the end of the third quarter.\n\n“He’s been great,” Stevens said. “He’s looking forward to a recovery day (Monday) because he’s played in the most games for us.\n\n“He’s been very reliable all season. He’s continued to get better as the season’s progressed.”\n\nUnlike the other four usual Boston starters, who have all taken their turns on the shelf at various stretches of the season, Johnson has had some reason to conserve energy at times this year since he’s been on the floor for all but one game with 70 starts.\n\nBoston is 24-7 this season when its preferred starting lineup of Avery Bradley, Jae Crowder, Al Horford, Isaiah Thomas, and Johnson has been healthy and available.\n\n“I’ve always said to myself that if I can play, I can play,” Johnson said. “Injuries definitely take full effect. Knock on wood, I haven’t really been hurt since that one time (Jan. 11 vs. Washington) I sat out because I rolled my ankle. The main key is just getting rest and staying healthy.”\n\nDespite being undersized at power forward — let alone center where he often plays alongside Horford — he is often charged with holding the other team’s best rebounder off the boards long enough for someone else to swoop in and grab the defensive rebound. That was the case on Sunday when he was forced to tangle with Miami’s 7-foot rebounding machine Hassan Whiteside.\n\nAlthough Whiteside was able to pull down 15 rebounds, the Celtics were able to draw fairly even (40-35) on the night.\n\nWhile Johnson’s contributions don’t always light up a stat sheet, his true impact is how the Celtics are generally a better team whenever he is on the court. He has an even or positive plus-minus in 11 of the past 12 games, including a plus-19 in a four-point win over the Heat Sunday, and a plus-26 in a 10-point win over the Phoenix Suns on Friday.\n\n“It’s just recognizing every win counts as it gets close to the postseason,” Johnson said. “I feel like I play hard every time I get on the floor. I am just getting opportunities where I’m running out, getting buckets, getting tip-ins, just playing hard.”"
