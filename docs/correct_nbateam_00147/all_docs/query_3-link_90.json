        "text": "Johnson finished in the top 10 overall in two of the five hustle categories (Charges Drawn and Screen Assists) and ranked fourth among players at his position in both categories. While he did not dominate one single category, his contributions across the board of hustle plays helped earn him this end-of-season honor.\n\nTo fully appreciate a player like Amir Johnson, you have to look deeper than the standard per game box score stats. On the surface, his 4.6 points, 4.5 rebounds, 1.6 assists, 0.6 steals and 0.6 blocks donâ€™t really stand out.\n\nBut if we look closer, we see that Johnson was one of only 31 players to hit those benchmarks this season while playing at least 50 games and he played by far the fewest minutes (15.8 per game) of any player on that list. In fact, he is one of just three players to average fewer than 26 minutes per game and average those numbers.\n\nWhen looking on a per-36 minute basis, Johnson led the Sixers in offensive rebounds, ranked second in blocks and fourth in steals among players that appeared in at least 15 regular season games."
