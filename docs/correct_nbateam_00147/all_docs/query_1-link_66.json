        "text": "One day after adding a wing off the bench by acquiring Wilson Chandler, the Sixers shored up their depth behind Joel Embiid.\n\nAmir Johnson is finalizing a one-year deal to return to the Sixers, according to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski. Johnson, 31, re-signed for the veteran's minimum, per Sports Illustrated's Jake Fischer, which would mean he will earn $2.39 million next season.\n\nLast offseason, the Sixers signed Johnson to a one-year, $11 million deal. The 13-year veteran would go on to appear in 74 games as Embiid's primary backup in 2017-18, averaging 4.6 points and 4.5 rebounds in 15.8 minutes per game.\n\nOther than Johnson, Richaun Holmes is the only other center option behind Embiid under contract. Though, 2017 draft-and-stash Jonah Bolden, who is expected to join the Sixers in summer league, could come over next season.\n\nIf Johnson did indeed sign for the minimum, the Sixers, who are hovering around the salary cap, would still have the room mid-level exception ($4.4 million) at their disposal. Although, Johnson re-signing puts the Sixers at 16 players under contract, and that doesn't include second-rounder Shake Milton or Bolden.\n\nMore on the Sixers"
