        "text": "2020 has been a good year for Detroit Pistons rookie Sekou Doumbouya so far. He moved into the starting lineup on Jan. 2 against the L.A. Clippers. In nine games as a starter, he’s averaging 12.9 points, 5.1 rebounds and 0.9 steals a game, a couple weeks after turning 19 on Dec. 23.\n\nDoumbouya is not only the NBA’s youngest player, but one of fewer than 150 NBA players to make the league before turning 20. Of those, five others have suited up for the Pistons during their Age 19 season. Here’s how they fared:\n\n1974-75: Eric Money\n\nMoney was a standout at Detroit Kettering before spending two seasons playing for Arizona. He was selected in the second round of the draft (back when the draft lasted 10 rounds), 33rd overall, by a Pistons team that already featured four guards, including Dave Bing and Chris Ford. Still, Pistons coach Ray Scott was optimistic about Money’s chances of making the roster, as he described playing against Money in a summer rec league to the Freep the night of the draft: “He caught my eye even then because he handled himself so well against the pros. At Arizona, even though he was playing under wraps &mldr; He’s a Dave Bing type.”\n\nMoney did indeed make the Pistons that season and played six seasons in the NBA. As a rookie, Money averaged 4.8 points, 1.3 rebounds and 1.5 assists over 13.5 minutes in 66 games. He scored in double figures 13 times, including a 21-point game against the New Orleans Jazz in the fifth game of his career. Money was traded after four seasons in Detroit after he clashed with then-Pistons coach Dick Vitale over the summer. That beef led to Money’s signature moment in Metro Detroit – as a member of the visiting Nets on Oct. 13, 1978. In the Pistons’ first game at the Pontiac Silverdome, Money hit two game-winning free throws with 41 seconds left – giving him six points on the night. After the game, he went to mid-court and “gestured defiantly,\" according to the Freep’s Charlie Vincent, at the record crowd for a Pistons game: 13,688.\n\n2003-05: Darko Milicic\n\nWhoops, probably should have had a trigger warning at the start of this piece for anyone who remembers Milicic’s days as Larry Brown’s “Human Victory Cigar.” And to think, it all started with such high hopes for Milicic, who at 18 years, 6 days, was the NBA’s youngest-ever draftee. Brown compared the Serbian forward to a former player of his, Danny Manning, on draft night. \"Darko's probably a better athlete than Danny at this stage and a little stronger and bigger, but I see a lot of similarities in there,” Brown told the Free Press after the Pistons took Milicic with the No. 2 pick. “If he develops bad habits, blame it on me because he doesn't have any right now, or blame it on our game.\n\n\"Any time you get the second pick in the draft you want to get a player who's going to be a fixture, who's going to be a contributor and hopefully a star.”\n\n[ From 2016: Darko now apparently living on a farm ]\n\nThe other four players drafted in the top five that year – LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade – became perennial All-Stars.\n\nThat &mldr; was not what happened with Milicic. He made it into just 34 games as a rookie, getting 4.7 minutes a game and averaging 1.4 points per game. That season, he had more scoreless appearances (16) than he did games with a field goal (14), and had just two games with multiple buckets from the field. At least he and the Pistons won the NBA title. Year 2 didn’t go better; Milicic upped his court time to 6.9 minutes a game, but still averaged less than two points a game in his 37 appearances. Brown was out as Pistons coach going into Milicic’s third year, but just 25 games into the season, Milicic was dealt to Orlando for Kelvin Cato (who appeared in just four games with the Pistons) and a 2007 first-round pick. With the Magic, Milicic finally saw some playing time and developed into a respectable journeyman who suited up for four other franchises and played until 2013.\n\n[ Opinion: Pistons passing on Donovan Mitchell isn't like Darko. It's worse ]\n\n2005-07: Amir Johnson\n\nThe Pistons went back to the teen well quickly, though this time they waited until the second round – pick No. 56 – to take Johnson, who had been named California’s Mr. Basketball as well as a McDonald’s All-American. The Los Angeles native was 18 years, 58 days old at the time of the pick and was rail-thin – just 210 pounds despite being 6-foot-9 – with a long wingspan.\n\nAt the time of the pick, Johnson drew comparisons to then-Piston Antonio McDyess due to his presence in the paint; Johnson averaged eight blocks a game in high school. A few weeks after the draft, Pistons exec Scott Perry was still raving about Johnson: “He's going to have a chance to be a big-time rebounder and shot-blocker in this league, and I think he's going to improve offensively, because when he gets the basketball inside, he does finish.”\n\nThe Pistons took their time with Johnson as a teen; he appeared in just 11 games over his first two seasons, averaging 6.1 points in 14.8 minutes a game. His shot-blocking skills were immediately apparent, however; his 1.4 blocks a game made him one of just 20 teens to average at least a block a game in NBA history.\n\nIn all, Johnson spent four seasons with the Pistons, making it into 135 games. Dealt to Toronto in 2009, Johnson developed into a solid big man who last saw action with the 76ers last season.\n\n2012-13: Andre Drummond\n\nEven with a year at Connecticut, Drummond was still the second-youngest player in the 2012 draft, and the Pistons knew they had a project on their hands. Then-GM Joe Dumars made that clear at his news conference after the pick: “Immediately, I'm going to be upfront with you, right now we're not overselling this kid at all.”\n\nDrummond played 60 games as a rookie, with 10 starts. Despite seeing the court for only 20.7 minutes a game, Drummond averaged 7.9 points, 7.6 rebounds and 1.6 blocks. He continued that production the next season, his Age 20 year, averaging 13.5 points and 13.2 rebounds as his playing time went up to 32.3 minutes a game.\n\nDrummond has been one of the most decorated Pistons of the past decade, with two All-Star berths and a third-team All-NBA nod in 2015-16, but he appears on his way out – either via trade or by declining his player option and becoming a free agent – in a modern NBA game different than it was when he was drafted. It was, in a way, a transition that Dumars saw when the Pistons drafted Drummond: “For big men in the NBA today, I think it's imperative that you really be athletic now,\" Dumars told the Free Press after the pick. \"It's really tough if you're a big man and you're not athletic, because the game has changed so much.\"\n\n2015-16: Stanley Johnson\n\nThe biggest surprise surrounding Johnson’s selection at eighth overall wasn’t the pick, or the passing on Duke’s Justise Winslow to do so. It was Johnson’s bright fuschia-colored suit, which he selected late in the draft process after switching suit designers. “I thought it was going to be more of a purple than this, but I guess it's pink, so it will work out for me,” Johnson said at his introductory news conference the following day. Unfortunately for the Pistons, the selection of Johnson didn’t quite work out.\n\nThe 19-year-old, who spent a season at Arizona, went right into the rotation, appearing in 73 games and averaging 23.1 minutes a game. But Johnson’s shooting touch never developed; he shot 37.5% from the field and 30.7% from 3-point range en route to averaging 8.1 points a game. And while he played solid defense – averaging 0.8 steals a game – he did little on the boards, with just 4.2 rebounds a game. Johnson finished his rookie year with three double-doubles and scored in double figures 24 times.\n\nJohnson spent just over 3½ seasons as a Piston; a new front office cut bait and dealt him to the New Orleans Pelicans in a three-team trade; he has appeared in just 14 games this season after signing with Toronto in the offseason, and is averaging 1.4 points in 5.2 minutes a game."
