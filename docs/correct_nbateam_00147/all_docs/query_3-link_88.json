        "text": "WALTHAM – Amir Johnson said he wasn’t sure if his phone was going to ring at midnight on July 1.\n\nThe 28-year-old power forward knew many of those free agency calls are reserved for some of the biggest names in the game. Although he’d been a productive player over his first nine NBA seasons with the Detroit Pistons and Toronto Raptors, he realized he certainly is not one of those.\n\nSince being a 2005 second-round pick out of Westchester High School in California, Johnson had never averaged more than 10.4 points or 7.5 rebounds a game. He’d never been a 30-minute-a-night guy. He was the type of player you had to watch play a lot to truly appreciate.\n\nShortly after midnight came a call from a guy who had watched Johnson play a lot for a very long time.\n\n“It was just the respect level that I got when I talked with (Celtics president of basketball operations) Danny Ainge and (coach) Brad (Stevens),” Johnson said of the biggest reason why he decided to sign with Boston on the first day of free agency. “Danny preached to me how he’d been watching me all through high school, and knew my game, and had a lot of respect for what I can do on the floor.”\n\nRather than wait and see if he could secure a long-term contract as a fallback option for a team that missed out on the top-tier free agents, Johnson bet on himself and what he might be able to do playing for Stevens in Boston. He signed for two years and $24 million – with the second year a club option.\n\nIn one respect, $12 million a year is a healthy sum for a player who averaged 9.3 points and 6.1 rebounds last year. But, in others, the team-friendly term of the contract made it look like one of the steals of free agency to those willing to look beyond flashy statistics.\n\n“I just think that there are little things that go into winning that you try to talk about, but just don’t get noticed and talked about enough,” Stevens said before practice Sunday afternoon. “We saw it (from him Saturday night) in a 10-minute scrimmage. I thought he was terrific defensively in a system he hasn’t played in yet. It was largely because he played with a motor regardless of whether he made mistakes or not.\n\n“Offensively, he is just a real good team player. He can catch the ball on a seam off a pick-and-roll and make the right pass. He can catch the ball on the seam and make a floater. He can catch it on the pick-and-roll and go in and dunk it. He’s a good rim runner.\n\n“When we looked at our list of bigs at that time – and certainly now (with the further addition of David Lee) – he fits with all of them. Being able to fit next to somebody is a big part of this.”\n\nJohnson said that adaptability is a skill developed over nearly a decade in the league.\n\n“It’s just the years I’ve played in the NBA learning how to adjust to certain players, knowing where to be at times, setting screens a certain way,” he said. “It’s basically just reads off the guards and through playing with certain bigs – bigs who like to pop, bigs who like to roll – you have to adjust.\n\n“If I know (a point guard like) Isaiah (Thomas) likes to come off a screen and shoot, or cut to the middle, (I can play off that). It’s basically all reads, and to know each other’s body language, and how each other will react.”\n\nIt’s that type of nuanced attention to the game that Stevens appreciates. It should help Johnson find plenty of time on the floor among a crowded frontcourt rotation whether or not he admits that’s a primary concern early in training camp.\n\n“Never been a player who worried about minutes,” Johnson said. “Whenever I get in the game, it’s whatever I can do to help the team win. I’m pretty much that guy.”"
