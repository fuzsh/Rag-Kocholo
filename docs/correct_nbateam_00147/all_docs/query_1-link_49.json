        "text": "BOSTON — Two years before the Celtics signed Gordon Hayward, and a year prior to luring four-time All-Star Al Horford to Boston, there was Amir Johnson.\n\nThe first major free-agent signing of the Brad Stevens era was hardly a big splash, and a bit of a head-scratcher, as the Celtics chose to use $12 million of their salary cap room on an NBA journeyman.\n\nBut the move had a two-fold benefit for Stevens and the Celtics. One was the one-year deal with one-year option that allowed the Celtics to spend up to the salary cap floor while allowing the greatest flexibility to go after free agents such as Kevin Durant, Horford and Hayward down the line. But the other benefit was in the locker room that was being rebuilt on the fly, and would soon include a lot of youth.\n\n“Excellent veteran player,” Stevens said of Johnson before Thursday night’s game against the Philadelphia 76ers. “Unselfish, which I thought showed in the playoffs as much as anywhere else last year when he was kind of going back and forth with not only being in the starting lineup, but then not playing at all.\n\n“Always positive. We always say that when Amir got on the plane he had a smile, and he made sure he acknowledged everybody and talked to everybody, and cheered up everybody whether you won or lost. That means a lot over an 82-game season.”\n\nSixers coach Brett Brown said that impact has been there in Philadelphia as well. He had Johnson in the starting lineup Thursday as Joel Embiid rested on the second night of a back-to-back.\n\n“I had a chance, because I have been around for a while, to call different people that would have coached or played with him,” Brown said. “I would have talked to Brad. I would have talked to [former Celtics guard] Evan Turner. Tell us how he ticks. It was amazing to a man when nobody pivoted out of a consistent description of Amir. Incredible person. Can handle a role. Comes into a locker room and can make a statement or point because he lives it.”\n\nJohnson said before the game that he uses some of the lessons he learned during Boston’s rebuild to help the young talent on the Philadelphia roster.\n\nHe added that a lot of what he learned in Boston came straight from Stevens.\n\n“Brad is amazing, man,” Johnson said. “It amazes me to see him with this new team that he has and transition this offense with a whole new team. To succeed with that, it shows you how good of a coach he is. He has everybody buying in to what they do here in Boston, which is great to see. The young guys here can learn from him, for sure.”\n\nJohnson said he has lost 22 pounds from last year as he continues to adapt to an ever-changing game in his 13th season. He was told he needed to bulk up his slender frame to bang with centers like Shaquille O'Neal over the first decade of his career, after being one of the last classes of players to come to the NBA straight from high school. Now he has tried to slim down to be able to guard the 3-point line.\n\nIt’s that attention he gives to fine tune his game, and do so with a steady attitude, that has made him worth much more in Philadelphia, and in Boston two years before that, than his statistics would ever indicate.\n\n“Just having that mindset of wanting to win and knowing the right things to do to win games,” Johnson said. “Playing my part and helping out the guys succeed.”\n\nFultz still rehabbing\n\nJayson Tatum was in the Boston starting lineup on Thursday. The No. 3 overall pick last year has made a case for himself as Rookie of the Year.\n\nMeanwhile, Boston's would-be No. 1 overall selection, which they swapped to the 76ers, Markelle Fultz continues to rehab a shoulder injury that has derailed his rookie year.\n\n“The defining moment is that we’re going to look at his shot,” 76ers coach Brown said when ashed when Fultz might return. “He’s going to go to the free-throw line and we’re all going to say: ‘Does it pass the eye test?’\n\n\"He’s not there yet. He’s moved forward. But it’s not anything that we’re going to rush. There has to be a confidence that he has, and a health-related confidence that our medical people have. As far as a timeline, and what all that means, we don’t know.”"
