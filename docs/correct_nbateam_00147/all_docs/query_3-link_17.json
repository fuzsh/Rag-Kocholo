        "text": "The first round of the NBA Draft concluded a few hours ago, bringing many unexpected yet memorable moments. Having secured a commendable record during the 2023-24 season, which allowed them to reach the playoffs, the Milwaukee Bucks were given the 23 overall pick during the process. The franchise made use of this opportunity to welcome the 6-foot-5 player AJ Johnson into their circle. Despite being a native Californian, Wilson gained prominence after serving as a player for the Australian National Basketball League. Serving in the point guard/shooting guard position, the 19-year-old is expected to be a prominent part of the Milwaukee Bucks’ rotation during the next season.\n\nThe Bucks had the option of selecting better-experienced players like Tyler Kolek, Terrance Shannon, Ryan Dunn, and/or Baylor Scheierman. Instead, they selected an individual to whom CBS Sports gave a C+ rating. With no better than now, let’s dive in to explore the history of this latest NBA recruit.\n\nWho is AJ Johnson?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nEarly Life\n\nContrary to what some people might think, AJ Johnson is not related to former Boston Celtics power forward Amir Johnson. While their initials may be similar, the relationship between the veteran and the rookie stops right there.\n\nNot much is known about Johnson’s early life or his parents. However, according to reports, the latest NBA rookie was raised in the city of Fresno, located about 350 km away from the city of Los Angeles. Fresno also happens to be the place where Houston Rockets star and ‘Young Kobe’ Jalen Green spent a significant part of his childhood. As fate would have it, Wilson met the future NBA player at the age of 9, and has been closely associated with him ever since. During an interview back in 2022, he would go on to bestow the ultimate honor on Green by stating “We’ve been best friends, I’ve always looked up to him. We’re not blood, but we’re from a small town near Fresno where everyone knows each other. We call each other ‘brother’. We’re family. Blood couldn’t make us any closer”.\n\nJohnson kept shifting between different high schools, but the interruptions did not allow any hindrance to his basketball career. Whether it was the Taft High School or the Donda Academy, he left a memorable impression amongst basketball enthusiasts, causing him to be named amongst his class’s best guards and combo guards.\n\nCollege Career and the NBL League\n\nThe skills that AJ Johnson developed during his high school tenure allowed him to take his talents to the University of Texas. However, he didn’t spend too much time in college, choosing to decommit and head straight to the National Basketball League (NBL) in Australia. According to Bucks general manager John Horst, the limited time that Johnson spent in his college tenure saw him emerge as a player who possesses elite speed, can change his pace, and has the mental capability of getting through a professional season.\n\nJohnson signed a contract with the Illawarra Hawks back in April 2023. In the 29 games that he participated in, he secured an average score of 2.86 points, 1.24 rebounds, and 0.79 assists per game. Despite his abysmal stats, Johnson was considered to be a lottery pick during the 2024 NBA Draft. The perception did not change once he applied his name for the same. Having excelled during his pre-draft workout with the Bucks, the player felt that the franchise is what he would like to call his home for the foreseeable future.\n\n“Even in the interviews at the combine and stuff like that, the interviews went really well,” said Johnson in a statement. “They just seemed like they had my best interests and they really liked me. So yeah, I kind of felt a little bit like Milwaukee would be the team that would want me.”\n\nAJ Johnson discusses transitioning from the Illawarra Hawks to the Milwaukee Bucks\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nGoing from the Australian Basketball League to the most dominating league in the world of basketball is a big transition. However, AJ Johnson has given his assurances that he is ready to meet the challenges head-on.\n\nIn the aftermath of his selection, the 19-year-old sat down for a Q&A session with ESPN’s Kane Pitman. During the conversation, Johnson highlighted how playing in Australia gave him a perspective on being around professionals and learning from what they have to offer. Therefore, while he may have to make a few attempts to adjust to the harsh weather that Milwaukee has to offer, he may do a better job of blending in with his new teammates.\n\n“I’ll definitely say um athleticism my playmaking ability, like just my athleticness” said Johnson when asked what he would bring to the Bucks roster. “I feel like I can do stuff out there that you might not see a lot, and I feel like I could just help any organization win”. From CBS Sports to Sports Illustrated, the media houses have not given a high rating to the Bucks’ recent pick. However, only time will tell just how far the player will go.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nBefore leaving, be sure to check out some insights that Shaquille O’Neal’s ex-agent, Leonard Armato, shared about the Lakers legend’s infamous feud with the late Kobe Bryant."
