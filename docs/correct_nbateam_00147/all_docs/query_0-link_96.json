        "text": "LAS VEGAS — As a graduate of Michigan State, a fine institution of higher education, Matt Costello knows basic math.\n\nHe can see the Detroit Pistons have 14 players under standard NBA contracts for next season.\n\nHe knows that leaves one open roster spot.\n\nAnd he knows the Pistons could sign a big man to that spot.\n\nCostello, who played four seasons with the Spartans, plays center and is seeking to land his first standard NBA contract. He played four games with the San Antonio Spurs during the 2017-18 season under a two-way deal.\n\nThat’s a major reason he decided to play for the Pistons’ summer league team.\n\n“That’s why we came here so hopefully they say something, and we get it going,” Costello said after scoring 18 points and grabbing seven rebounds Wednesday to help the Pistons move to 4-0 with a 96-81 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nThe Pistons easily clinched a spot in Saturday's quarterfinals. They have won four games by an average of 17.3 points.\n\nCostello, 25, has been a factor, scoring 14.8 points and grabbing 7.8 rebounds per game.\n\nLineups with Costello at center have outscored teams by a whopping 86 points in the four games.\n\nCostello credited playing with Bruce Brown, Khyri Thomas and Svi Mykhailiuk, players assured of roster spots on the Pistons next season.\n\n“We just play the right way and nobody’s selfish,” Costello said. “A lot of times at summer league, you get on a team and everybody’s getting there’s, trying to get their points.\n\n“This team isn’t like that at all. I think it helps that we have three guys with team contracts that are just trying to play the right way because they’re trying to get minutes in the league. Coach (Dwane) Casey makes everyone play the right way. It’s fun to play basketball the right way.”\n\nCould Costello's performance be enough to attract the attention of the Pistons front office? Possibly.\n\nGoing into free agency, frontcourt depth was a top priority.\n\nBut after being spurned by JaVale McGee, who re-signed with the Los Angeles Lakers, two people with firsthand knowledge of the situation told the Free Press the Pistons are exploring all options.\n\nThe sources didn’t reveal the options, but here are three scenarios.\n\n[ These scenarios could make sense for Pistons to get Russell Westbrook ]\n\nOne option: Sign a veteran\n\nA curious bit of news emerged this week from Vegas.\n\nESPN’s Jordan Schultz reported past-their-prime veterans Amar'e Stoudemire and Monta Ellis held a private workout for many NBA teams — including the Pistons — to scout.\n\nNeither has played in the NBA the past two seasons, but you can see a potential Pistons fit with Stoudemire, 36.\n\nHe hasn’t played in the NBA since 2016, and likely has nothing left, but the interest shows the Pistons are diligent in searching for a big man.\n\nThe Pistons targeted McGee on the first day of the free agency moratorium, but he re-signed with the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nAs a prototypical rim running center, the 7-foot McGee would have been a perfect match to soak up minutes behind Andre Drummond.\n\nBut after 11 days of free agency, are there any veteran centers left?\n\nJoakim Noah, the 2014 defensive player of the year with the Chicago Bulls, is still available.\n\nHe struggled with health and New York nightlife in his years with the Knicks, but was good in 42 games with the Memphis Grizzlies last season (7.1 points, 5.7 rebounds, 2.1 assists in 16.5 minutes per game). He's 34.\n\nAnother name to watch is Pau Gasol. The Pistons have interest in him, a person with firsthand knowledge of the situation told the Free Press. A partnership could be natural, considering Pistons vice chairman Arn Tellem is Gasol’s former agent. Tellem attended Gasol’s wedding last weekend.\n\nGasol, 39, is recovering from surgery to repair a stress fracture in his left foot, which ended his 2018-19 season after 30 games, and will impede him from playing in this summer's FIBA World Cup. He averaged 3.9 points and 4.6 rebounds in 12 minutes per game with San Antonio and Milwaukee.\n\nHe told ESPN.com recently he should be able to resume basketball activities in August.\n\nOther veterans available include former Pistons Amir Johnson and Greg Monroe. Nene’ and Marcin Gortat could also be options.\n\nSecond option: Roll with 14\n\nAccording to Basketball-Reference, Blake Griffin played 7% of his minutes at center during his All-Star 2018-19 season.\n\nThon Maker spent 27% of his minutes at center last season with the Pistons and Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nFree-agent pickup Markieff Morris spent 30% of his minutes at center last season with the Washington Wizards and Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nOne of the sources told the Free Press the Pistons front office is considering leaving the roster spot open.\n\nTeams like the flexibility of an open spot, which enables them to acquire a player in a trade for draft compensation; no need for a corresponding roster move.\n\nThe Pistons could decide Drummond will take 32 minutes per game at center and divvy up the remaining 16 minutes between Griffin, Morris and Maker.\n\nThe team is pushing up against the $132.9 million luxury tax, so such a move could save money for Pistons owner Tom Gores, although the front office isn’t under any such mandate.\n\nThe source said this option is easier said than done. A true center provides a level of security.\n\nThird option: Add young prospect\n\nCostello, the state’s Mr. Basketball in 2012 at Bay City Western, was undrafted in 2016 after a solid career at Michigan State.\n\nAfter two seasons in the Gatorade League, he spent last season playing overseas in Italy.\n\nAt 6-10, 240, he has solid size, although he’s limited physically. Taller, longer players have easily swatted some of his shot attempts.\n\nBut he’s a battler and displays good basketball I.Q.\n\nHe even showed off a 3-point shot against the 76ers, making two on consecutive possessions early in the game.\n\nIf Costello is signed, he would be taking a similar path as former Piston Eric Moreland.\n\nThe 6-10 Moreland signed to play for the Pistons at the Orlando Summer League in 2017. He performed well as a rebounding and shot-blocking presence, and earned a contract, playing the entire 2017-18 season with the Pistons.\n\nCostello could be next.\n\n“I just need someone to pull the trigger,” he said. “We’ll be there. Hopefully it’s Detroit, it’s at home.”\n\nPistons fans: Now you can own a piece of history from the Palace\n\nJamie: Credit Pistons for improving – but is it enough in revamped NBA East?"
