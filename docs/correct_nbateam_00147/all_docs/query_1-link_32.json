When Drake — a friend of Johnson's — dropped his album Nothing Was The Same, Johnson bought an entire record store's supply and gave them out downtown.\n\nHe also once took a group of his fans to Medieval Times.\n\n\"When I first got here, I didn't really know anything about Toronto, but just going out meeting the people, seeing different stuff. I love to do that type of stuff, like I said, that's how I am,\" Johnson told CBC Toronto in a previous interview.\n\nJohnson, who recorded 9 points per game, 6.1 rebounds per game and added 1.6 assists this season for the Raptors, also thanked the organization in his post."
