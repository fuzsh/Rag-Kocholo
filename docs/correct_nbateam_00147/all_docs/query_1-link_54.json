        "text": "Amir Johnson is going back to the Philadelphia 76ers for at least one more season.\n\nA person with knowledge of the negotiations said Wednesday that Johnson has agreed to a one-year contract with Philadelphia that could become official as soon as Friday, when the NBAâ€™s off-season moratorium on player movement ends.\n\nThe person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because of that moratorium.\n\nThe 6-foot-9 Johnson was primarily a reserve for the 76ers last season, when he averaged 4.6 points and 4.5 rebounds per game. Philadelphia is the fourth club for the 31-year-old, who will be entering his 14th NBA season this fall.\n\n[relatedlinks]"
