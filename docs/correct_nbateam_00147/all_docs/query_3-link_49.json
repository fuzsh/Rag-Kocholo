        "text": "“I really had no idea with free agency what was going to happen,” he said. “I had no clue. I like the situation I am in now. It was just the best decision to fit me and my family. That’s all that went through my head and what I was thinking about.”\n\nJohnson signed a one-year contract with the Celtics – with a team option for a second year – at $12 million annually. He indicated he didn’t bother checking to see whether Toronto would match it. “They talked to me,” he said. “But they obviously chose a different route.”\n\n“I like the vision, I like that we are young, and I like what they did last season coming into the playoffs,” said the 28-year-old Johnson, a veteran of 10 NBA seasons in Detroit and Toronto. “I felt like they were doing their best to get better. Just talking to [Celtics president of basketball operations] Danny [Ainge] and [coach Brad] Stevens, I love what they got going on here.”\n\nAccording to Synergy Sports data, Johnson has finished as the roll man in five pick-and-rolls with Thomas this preseason and generated 10 points (a ridiculous two points per play in a league where Boston’s 0.963 points per play overall ranks sixth in the NBA). A desire to play Johnson and Thomas together might mean Johnson has to settle for a reserve role (assuming Thomas remains in his sixth man spot). Johnson doesn’t seem worried about it, particularly with Stevens pledging to utilize Boston’s depth as a weapon. “I’ve been on both sides in my career, coming off the bench and starting so it really doesn’t matter,” Johnson said.\n\nThomas said they benefit mutually when they are on the floor together, and lauded how Johnson makes the game simpler for him. “He’s a player that just knows how to play,” said Thomas. “Sometimes he doesn’t even know what play we’re running, but his basketball IQ is so high that he knows what to do out there. He’s a talented basketball player offensively and defensively and he’s gonna definitely help us this season.”"
