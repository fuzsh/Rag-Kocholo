        "meta_description": "BOSTON – When the Toronto Raptors entered their preseason in October, there was a noticeable absence in their locker room. Amir Johnson was not in attendance for the first time in seven seasons, having signed with the rival Boston Celtics over the summer. It created an odd feeling among Toronto’s players, but tonight will be even stranger when the Raptors take on Johnson and the C’s for the first time.",
