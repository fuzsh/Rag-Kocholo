As such, many players on the roster for Team USA's mini-camp this week will not participate in the event.\n\nTo fill out the rosters for the showcase, Johnson was one of five players invited for just the scrimmage. The others were C.J. Watson, Arron Afflalo, Elfrid Payton and Terrence Jones. The additions may have been at least partially determined by proximity to the game. Johnson lives in Las Vegas, and Watson and Afflalo reportedly do too."
