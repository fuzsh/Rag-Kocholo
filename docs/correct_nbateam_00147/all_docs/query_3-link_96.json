        "text": "Amir Johnson, who according to Brad Stevens has suffered from plantar fasciitis in recent weeks, missed today's practice to get treatment. Should the big forward miss tomorrow's game against Minnesota in the Garden, then the Celtics coach would have an obvious direction to move as he ponders changes to his lineup.\n\n\"We’ve had him in a boot just to be conservative. But he’s — I don’t know what they’ll list him as for tomorrow — but I would say somewhere north of 50-percent likely that he plays,\" Stevens said after practice.\n\nAsked if the injury has been bothering Johnson for awhile, considering that the forward appears to have been playing only limited minutes, Stevens said, \"He’s been getting it treated, and he's had it for awhile. But I never know to what extent it affects each of these guys. But certainly that’s something that you just have to keep a good pulse on and treat well. A lot of these guys have little nagging things like that.”\n\nThough it appears that Johnson has been held to limited minutes, considering his 23-minute average, Stevens said he's not managing the forward's time on the floor.\n\n\"No. If (trainer Ed Lacerte) tells me that we need to based on where he’s at right now (then yes), but my impression is he’s either good to go or not,\" said Stevens. \"Anyone who’s ever had that tendon strain down there or plantar fascia knows that the hardest part is the morning when you wake up and walk around. And then once you get those orthotics in, you get moving, you get loose, it’s a little bit different.\n\n\"So hopefully he can feel good enough to go. And we’ll see. It's one of those things where I wanted to give him a couple of days to feel better.\""
