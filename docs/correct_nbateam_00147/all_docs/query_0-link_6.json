        "text": "The drafting miscues haven't been the only soft spot for the Pistons under Joe Dumars.\n\nAmir Johnson shines as a good example of how the Detroit Pistons do not do a good job of developing players.\n\nA 6-foot-9 kid out of high school is a blank canvas in the NBA. The Pistons drafted this broad-shouldered young man from LA and had an opportunity to develop him however they wanted.\n\nJohnson is very quick off of the floor, has a nose for the ball, and he effortlessly flies up and down the basketball court as fast as anyone his size in the NBA.\n\nThe Pistons were the elite team in the Eastern Conference when AJ got to town. He saw virtually NO playing time during his first couple seasons. No development.\n\nFunny thing is, the team was supposedly ‘running out of gas’ in the post-seasons, after the starters logged heavy minutes during the regular season.\n\nIt’s really odd.\n\nVery strange to watch a team supposedly run out of gas, when they have a bouncy 19-year-old kid who would love to get on the floor and hustle for them. He was in street clothes a lot of games.\n\nThey were the best team in the conference, but why not start to groom the young guy right away?\n\nIt would have cost you some leads and games perhaps, but the Eastern Conference was hideous back then. It wouldn’t have mattered much at all. He would gain experience. Plus most importantly, its saves gas for the games that count.\n\nBut there he sat.\n\nSuddenly this year the Pistons announced that they would start Amir Johnson at the power forward position. What? (Had they planned on this being a rebuilding year from the very beginning?)\n\nHe was clearly not ready to start. He hadn’t even been giving any consistent playing time at all in his career, now he’s going to be a starter in the NBA? WTH?\n\nThat’s not how it works.\n\nAfter being thrown to the wolves and chewed up, Johnson was eventually benched again. Amir finished this campaign in a familiar fashion, glued to the Detroit bench.\n\nIt is too bad for the young guy. I really hope he is moved in a deal this summer for his sake. He needs a real opportunity to develop his basketball game.\n\nHe certainly has the talent to play at a high level in this league.\n\nToo bad he didn’t land of a club like the Atlanta Hawks, or the 76ers, whose style of play is perfect for young athletic guys.\n\nThey both play a more up-tempo, attacking style game. Full court pressing after made baskets, Amir would fit quite well into a system like that.\n\nI think it would benefit Amir to work on his offensive game facing the basket. Develop more of a small forward’s game as opposed to a power forward’s.\n\nDespite the slow start to his career, he still has years to iron out his game.\n\nHe should aspire to be far more than just the rebounding, shot-blocking, hustle player role that this team carved out for him. The sky is the limit for the young man if he has a chance to learn the game."
