        "text": "PHILADELPHIA – Even the wealthiest professional athletes will often say they would have done it all just for the thrill of the sport. Few ever get around to doing what Amir Johnson did Friday. Few get around to providing the proof.\n\nThough he has earned more than $77 million playing pro basketball and no longer has much to prove, there was Johnson volunteering to play a G-League game in Delaware just for the enjoyment of the sport.\n\nVolunteering?\n\nA player with 50 games of NBA postseason experience?\n\n“Just staying professional,” Johnson was saying Saturday, before the Sixers’ 130-115 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers. “I am doing my part as a team player, just trying to stay in shape. As you know, I haven’t been playing much. I wanted to go out there and get a rhythm and get ready for when it is my time to go in and help the team.”\n\nJohnson helped the Sixers often last season, when he played in 74 games, largely as the backup center to Joel Embiid. But before playing 3:55 and contributing two points Saturday, he had played in just 37 games this season, none since Jan. 26. And with the Sixers having added 7-3 Boban Marjanovic at the trade deadline, and with Brett Brown determined to include rookie Jonah Bolden in his five-spot mix, Johnson has become lost on the depth chart.\n\nBut he so loves the sport that he has a basketball gym in his house, is as fit as any player in the locker room, and remains determined to continue playing in the NBA when his $2.3 million contract expires at the end of this season. For enough reasons, he could have the chance. Though a 14th-year pro, he is only 31, the last player to have gone directly from high school to the NBA. Combined with his legendary fitness and the desire to play that he showed in his recent cameo in Delaware, he could have value as a backup big man.\n\n“Guys like D-Wade (Dwyane Wade), Vince Carter and them, they are 36, 37,” Johnson said, though Carter is actually 42. “D-Wade has 15 years. I have 14, but I am 31. I look it like I want to play until I am their age.”\n\nAt the minimum, Johnson’s willingness to have played Friday in Delaware, where he scored 15 points in 27 minutes of a 112-109 loss to Maine, should be a useful boost to his value.\n\n“It’s unique,” Brown said. “It’s very, very rare. And I have tremendous respect for that he is even thinking like that. Think about it. He was our backup center last year. Sometimes I went with Richaun (Holmes). Sometimes I went with Amir. And this year I haven’t, for whatever reason.\n\n“But he’s been a pro. He’s a good human being. He is a tremendous person. And that is a snapshot of humility. That is a snapshot of somebody putting his ego and his resume on the shelf because he just wanted to play basketball. I thought he played well. I enjoyed sitting there watching him play.”\n\nWith the Sixers struggling Saturday without the injured Embiid, particularly on the defensive glass, Brown gave Johnson a rare opportunity in the third quarter. He shot 1-for-2, but was not of immediate rebounding help. After that, Brown went to a smaller lineup.\n\n“I enjoyed watching him play in Delaware,” Brown said. “I am not afraid to try to resurrect a 13-year NBA veteran. I have zero regrets about giving him that chance.”\n\nJohnson was formally returned to the Sixers earlier Saturday, with Zhaire Smith technically re-assigned to Delaware. But he insists he will volunteer for more Blue Coats shifts when it fits the Sixers’ schedule.\n\n“I had fun,” Johnson said. “It reminded me of when I was a kid, playing late-night basketball with my buddies as a youngster. They say it is a grind down there. And I respect every player down there for putting in the work and grinding.\n\n“We were just out there grinding, having fun, and playing basketball. I’ll do anything to stay in shape. Sometimes you have to do the stuff that got you here to this point. I will put in work no matter what the situation is. You constantly have to put in the work to make yourself better as a person and as an athlete.\n\n“It’s just the same grind at a different time.”"
