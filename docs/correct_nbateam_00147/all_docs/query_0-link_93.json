        "text": "Age: 28\n\nHometown: East Los Angeles\n\nDrafted: 56th overall by Detroit in 2005\n\nTwitter: @iamamirjohnson\n\nJohnson on his own style of play: “If you would describe myself: Very, very finesse player, but still busting your a-- and working hard.”\n\nRaptors coach Dwane Casey on Johnson: “I noticed his approach in practice. He was hard-nosed and always where he was supposed to be. You didn’t have to say ‘Giddy-up’ to him. A real self-starter, so I fell in love with that.”\n\n■ Johnson played just two years of high school basketball before the Detroit Pistons drafted him in 2005. He was the last player who went straight from high school into the NBA.\n\n■ He spent his freshman year at two high schools, starting at Pacific Hills in West Hollywood, Calif., and finishing at Narbonne in Harbor City. Neither team played him at any level. As a sophomore, he played at Verbum Dei in Watts, before becoming the subject of a recruiting violation that ultimately forced him to sit out his junior season at Westchester in Los Angeles. He continued to play travel ball during his high school suspension.\n\n■ Before the start of his senior year at Westchester, he broke his foot, but rehabbed quickly and helped the Comets capture the 2005 Division 1 state championship. He recorded a double-double of 15 points and 11 rebounds, to go along with five blocks, in the title game. He was named California’s Mr. Basketball and earned a spot in the McDonald’s All-American game in 2005.\n\n■ He committed to Louisville, but wound up entering the draft instead.\n\n■ Johnson’s defensive ability and work ethic caught the eye of Larry Brown, who was the coach of the Pistons at the time. Despite Brown’s desire to draft Johnson, who spent two years under the heralded Ed Azzam at Westchester, then-Pistons GM Joe Dumars drafted Jason Maxiell in the first round instead. He took Johnson in the second round.\n\n“I was angry with Joe and [the front office], to be honest,” Brown told SportsNet in 2014.\n\n■ During his rookie season, he was sent down to the Fayetteville Patriots in the NBA D-League before being called back up a couple months later. Johnson played the majority of the 2006-07 season with the Sioux Falls Skyforce of the D-League.\n\n■ Johnson signed a three-year, $12 million deal with the Pistons in 2007.\n\n■ Johnson seems comfortable expressing his personality off the court. He has an active YouTube channel, featuring a few comedy bits, including one that runs downs the different types of ballers that can be found in pickup games.\n\n■ He once shaved the Raptors logo into his hair, dying the claw red to boot.\n\n■ A trade in the offseason of 2009 sent Johnson to the Milwaukee Bucks. Before ever suiting up for the Bucks, he was shipped to the Raptors, where he had been until agreeing to a two-year deal with the Celtics.\n\n■ Johnson seems to offer locker room intangibles, reflecting a team-first mentality that rubs off on teammates.\n\n“When Amir is in tune and focused, being aggressive and physical, everybody follows suit,” Casey said last season. “He sets the tone as far as who we are and how we’re playing.”\n\n■ His career-high scoring night — a 32-point, 10-rebound output against the Lakers on Dec. 8, 2013 — came a week after re-entering the starting lineup following his suggestion that he come off the bench.\n\n“I felt like I didn’t have it going at the time and it would be good if I switched it up,” he said after his 32-point performance. “I was thinking, ‘What can we do as a team to be successful and start winning games?’ ”\n\nThat performance against the Lakers sparked a streak of seven straight double-digit performances for Johnson.\n\n■ He said he quickly fell in love with Toronto upon arriving in 2009.\n\n“Toronto is part of me,” Johnson said in 2013. “I’ve been around, the people are very kind, I love it here.”\n\n■ He became pals with rapper Drake. Johnson decided when the Toronto native’s last studio album — “Nothing Was The Same” — dropped in 2013, he would buy every copy in two stores and personally hand each one out.\n\n■ It seems Johnson was reluctant to leave Toronto after becoming fond of the city. After the Raptors were swept by the Washington Wizards in the first round of this year’s playoffs, he told reporters he hoped the whole roster would be back next season.\n\n“I’ve been with this team for six years now,” Johnson said. “I’ve seen the ups and downs of the team, and I really like where we are now, compared with the past. It just takes time. I feel like we have the chance to do something special. Keep a team together and they grow together, they get better, so I hope everyone comes back.”"
