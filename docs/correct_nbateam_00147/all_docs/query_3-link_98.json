        "text": "The NBA enforced their anti-flopping stance this week by issuing three separate warnings to notable players. Toronto Raptors power forward Amir Johnson received one of those cautions.\n\nThe NBA took exception to Johnson's embellishment of a Darrell Arthur bump that occurred in Monday night's game against the Denver Nuggets.\n\nCan't view on mobile? Watch it here.\n\nCleveland Cavaliers center Anderson Varejao was also warned for his actions in a Monday night game against the Brooklyn Nets. He's never been fined in the past, but Varejao appears to be a repeat offender. He's drawn the ire of players in the past for what appears to be flopping.\n\nCan't view on mobile? Watch it here.\n\nGolden State Warriors forward Draymond Green was the third player to receive a warning, and he wasn't the biggest fan of the NBA's call. On Thursday, Green tweeted the short form of \"shaking my head\" in response to his warning from an incident in a game Wednesday.\n\nCan't view Tweet on mobile? See it here.\n\nThe three players have avoided past warnings, but after an initial caution a fine will follow for any future infractions. Let us know who you think is this season's worst offender."
