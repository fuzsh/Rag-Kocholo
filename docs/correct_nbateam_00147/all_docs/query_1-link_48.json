When ESPN returned from break, analyst Doris Burke criticized Johnson and Joel Embiid, who was sitting next to Johnson, for having the phone on the bench.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers.

Their Game 1 loss was troubling because of how flat they came out.\n\nThe Nets lead the series 1-0, but the cause of Johnson's text message may become the central story of this series.\n\nRead next\n\nAdvertisement"
