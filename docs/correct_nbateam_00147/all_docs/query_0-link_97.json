        "text": "Too often during the regular season, Amir Johnson didn’t seem worth his $12 million salary, the second highest on the Celtics, trailing only the $15 million that the released David Lee received.\n\nSure, Johnson played tough defense, but his 7.3 points per game during the regular season ranked eighth on the team, and his 22.8 minutes ranked seventh. His 6.4 rebounds ranked second, but a distant second to Jared Sullinger’s 8.3.\n\nExercising the team option on the second year of Johnson’s contract didn’t appear to be a sure thing.\n\nBut in the Eastern Conference opening-round playoff series, Johnson has been closer to the player the Celtics expected when they signed him away from Toronto as a free agent last summer.\n\nThe 6-foot-9 forward has averaged 10.5 points, 8 boards and 2 blocks, while shooting a team-high 67.9 percent to help the Celtics earn a split of the first four games of their best-of-seven series with the Atlanta Hawks. Game 5 will be played at 8:30 p.m. Tuesday in Atlanta, with Game 6 on Thursday at the Garden at a time to be announced.\n\nJohnson has been especially effective offensively over the past three games, averaging 12.7 points, and a big reason why is he is no longer bothered by plantar fasciitis in his left foot. The pain sidelined him for two games in December and lingered for months afterward, forcing him to wear a walking boot.\n\nAfter the Celtics won Game 4 Sunday in overtime at the Garden, Johnson said his foot has felt better lately.\n\n“Probably near the end of the season,” he said, “where I guess the plantar just kind of went away. I still do treatment on it, I still sleep with a night boot on it just to make sure that doesn’t happen again, but my feet and ankles have been feeling good.”\n\nJohnson said he has rolled both ankles in previous years, but this was the first time he had been bothered by plantar fasciitis. With a slumping Sullinger dropped from the starting lineup in favor of the quicker Jonas Jerebko, Johnson is the only true big man who starts for the Green.\n\n“Really in the last two months,” Celtics coach Brad Stevens said, “I feel like (Johnson has) played at a high, high level. There’s two things that go with that. No. 1, his health is obviously a factor with his foot although he didn’t complain about it a ton other than those few games that he missed. He let it heal and let it rest. But I think the other thing is just getting used to a new system and getting used to a new style of play, getting used to new teammates and everything else, but he’s been impactful, and his mobility is critical against their bigs.”\n\nWhile the Celtics beat the Hawks the last two games in Boston, Johnson helped limit Hawks center Al Horford to a total of 13 points. Horford has also been slowed by a left groin strain.\n\n“Just paying off my man,” Johnson said. “I’m a better help defender more than a one-on-one defender and just reading plays where I’m able to get in the key or help my guys and get back to my man. I think that’s why coach likes me lot out there because I’m able to get back to my man and help at the same time.”\n\n“He’s really important to our offense too,” Stevens said, “with his rolling, getting to the rim, making himself available at the rim, those types of things.”\n\nIn Game 4, Marcus Smart found Johnson underneath for a layup and a dunk for the first four points of overtime. Johnson was wide open for the dunk.\n\n“During that last stretch in the fourth,” Johnson said, “I was on the bench, and I was definitely well rested. I was able to get a little energy coming off the bench starting that overtime, and I guess guys were too gassed to find out where I was on the floor, and I was wide open and able to hit the bucket.”\n\nJohnson turns 29 on Sunday. Jerebko, who turned 29 on March 2, is the only Celtic older than him, but Johnson has been in the NBA longer than any of his teammates. This is his 11th NBA season.\n\nJohnson hasn’t won a playoff series since 2008 when he played sparingly for the Detroit Pistons, who beat the Philadelphia Sixers and Orlando Magic before falling to the Celtics in the Eastern Conference finals.\n\nPrior to this season, Johnson played in the playoffs in only four of his 10 seasons, and three times his teams were eliminated by Paul Pierce’s teams. Pierce played for the Celtics in 2008 when he was voted MVP of the NBA Finals. Pierce and the Brooklyn Nets knocked out Johnson’s Raptors in 2014, despite Johnson’s 20 points and 10 rebounds in Game 7, and Pierce and the Washington Wizards swept Johnson’s Raptors in four games last year.\n\n“It’s funny,” Johnson said, “it’s just ironic how that happens.”\n\nIn 2009, Johnson and the Pistons were ousted by LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nJohnson hopes to finally win another playoff series.\n\n—Contact Bill Doyle at william.doyle@telegram.com.
