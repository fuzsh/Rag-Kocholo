        "text": "EL SEGUNDO – And now the Eastern Conference gets a chance.\n\nAfter blasting through five of the supposed best teams in the Western Conference on their way to their best start (7-0) since 2001-02, the Lakers meet up with one of Eastern Conference’s heavy hitters tonight, as the reconfiguring Detroit Pistons drop by Staples Center.\n\nBecause of the history of the rivalry, the national TV folks from ESPN will be in town. But these aren’t the Pistons of old. Or even the Pistons of two weeks ago.\n\nThe Pistons might have “The Answer” now that Allen Iverson is in their back court, but not many have the answers on how general manager Joe Dumars latest chemistry experiment will turn out.\n\n“I think they’re going to have good times and bad times while they adjust,” Lakers coach Phil Jackson said of the Iverson trade. “This is a team that’s been playing 80- or 90-point games and suddenly you get a player coming off a team that was playing 100-point games. His activity level is going to increase what they do.”\n\nThat, or decrease what the normally-freestyling Iverson does?\n\n“Iverson played a Georgetown, right?” Lakers forward Lamar Odom said.\n\n“That’s a half-court offense and he was getting 30 (points). He’s been getting 30 his whole life. I don’t expect anything else from him.”\n\nThat’s exactly what Iverson got Tuesday night in Detroit’s 100-92 victory over Sacramento. But in his previous two games – losses to New Jersey and Boston – he scored just 34 total points and had eight turnovers.\n\nIverson notwithstanding, this is still the Lakers and Pistons we’re talking about.\n\nOnly three current Lakers players -Kobe Bryant, Derek Fisher and Luke Walton – were around for the 2004 NBA Finals series between the two teams. But their memories are quite vivid.\n\n“I think there’s a lot of respect in terms of the talent on each team,” Fisher said. “But for me personally, losing to them in the Finals in 2004 still resonates strongly. So anything remotely related to Detroit or the Pistons, does not sit very well.”\n\nPhil Jackson held some of the starters out of Thursday’s light scrimmage, but everyone was required to show up and work out during practice. Why is that important?\n\n“We’re striving for perfection and to be perfect we have to be out here,” forward Lamar Odom said.\n\nIn other words, nobody’s stopping for a self-congratulatory pit stop after the team’s 7-0 start, its best since 2001-02.\n\n“It’s early in the season, we’re not thinking too much about what we’ve accomplished up until now,” Fisher said, when a reporter asked if the team was motivated to break any NBA records for best start, most wins in a season, longest-or winning streak.\n\n“We’re 7-0. If we get up to 27, 37, 47 in a row maybe we’ll start thinking about it,” he said, laughing.\n\nSO WHAT ABOUT\n\nTHAT RIVALRY? 70 WINS? REMEMBER KWAME\n\nThe Pistons will likely start Kwame Brown ahead of Amir Johnson (Westchester High) in tonight’s game. A report in the Detroit News said that head coach Michael Curry thinks forward Rasheed Wallace will be more productive playing alongside Brown than Johnson, because of Brown’s size. ———\n\nTONIGHT\n\nDetroit at Lakers\n\nTime: 7:30 p.m.\n\nTV: FSN, ESPN"
